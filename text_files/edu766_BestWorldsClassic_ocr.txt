ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE 
Born in Paris in 1805, died in 1859; studied law, taking 
his degree in 1826; traveled in Italy and Sicily; in 1831 
visited the United States under a commission to study the 
penitentiary system; returning published a book on the sub- 
ject which was crowned by the French Academy; from pri- 
vate notes taken in America then wrote his masterpiece, 
“Democracy in America,” which secured his election to the 
Academy in 1841; spent some years in public lite and then 
retired in order to travel and write. 
THE TYRANNY OF THE AMERICAN 
MAJORITY* 
I wot it to be an impious and execrable 
maxim that, politieally speaking, the people has 
a right to do whatever it pleases; and yet I have 
asserted that all authority originates in the will 
of the majority. Am I then in eontradietion with 
myself? 
A general law, which bears the name of justice, 
has been made and sanctioned not only by a 
majority of this or that people, but by a majority 
of mankind. The rights of every people are con- 
sequently confined within the limits of what is 
just. A nation may be considered in the light 
of a jury which is empowered to represent society 
at large and to apply the great and general law 
of justice. Ought such a jury, which represents 
society, to have more power than the society in 
which the law it applies originates?

lated by Henry Reeve.

  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  When I refuse to obey an unjust law, I do not 
contest the right which the majority has of com- 
manding, but I simply appeal from the sovereign- 
ty of the people to the sovereignty of mankind. 
It has been asserted that a people ean never en- 
tirely outstep the boundaries of justice and of 
reason in those affairs which are more peculiarly 
its own; and that consequently, full power may 
fegrlessly be given to the majority by which it 
“is represented. But this language is that of a 
slave. 
A majority, taken collectively, may be regarded 
as a being whose opinions, and most frequently 
whose interests are opposed to those of another 
being, which is styled a minority. If it be ad- 
mitted that a man possessing absolute power may 
misuse that power by wronging his adversaries, 
why should a majority not be liable to the same 
reproach? Men are not apt to change their char- 
acters by agglomerating; nor does their patience 
in the presence of obstacles increase with the con- 
sciousness of their strength. And for these rea- 
sons I can never willingly invest any number of 
my fellow creatures with that unlimited authority 
which I should refuse to any one of them. 
L do not think that it is possible to combine 
several principles in the same government so as 
at the same time to maintain freedom and really 
to oppose them to one another. The form of gov- 
ernment which is usually termed mixt has always 
appeared to me to be a mere chimera. Accurately 
speaking, there is no such thing as a mixt govern- 
ment, with the meaning usually given to that 
word; because in all communities some one prin- 
ciple of action may be discovered which prepon- 
4
-P-A-G-E-17
  ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE 
  derates over the others. England in the last cen- 
tury—which has been more especially cited as an 
example of this form of government—was in point 
of faet an essentially aristocratic state, altho it com- 
prized very powerful elements of democracy; for 
the laws and customs of the country were such that 
the aristocracy could not but preponderate in the 
end, and subject the direction of public affairs 
to its own will. The error arose from too much 
attention being paid to the actual struggle that 
was going on between the nobles and the people, 
without considering the probable issue of the con- 
test, which was really the important point. When 
a community actually has a mixt government— 
that is to say, when it is equally divided between 
two adverse principles—it must either pass 
through a revolution or fall into complete dis- 
solution. 
I am therefore of opinion that some one social 
power must always be made to predominate over 
the others; but I think that liberty is endangered 
when this power finds no obstacle which can 
retard its course, and force it to moderate its 
own vehemence. 
Unlimited power is in itself a bad and dan- 
gerous thing. Human beings are not competent 
to exercise it with discretion. God only can be 
omnipotent, because His wisdom and His justice 
are always equal to His power. But no power on 
earth is so worthy of honor for itself that I would 
consent to admit its uncontrolled and all-pre- 
dominant authority. When I see that the right 
and the means of absolute command or of rev- 
erential obedience to the right which it represents 
are conferred on a people or upon a king, upon 
5
-P-A-G-E-18
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  an aristoeracy or a democracy, a monarchy or 
a republic, I recognize the germ of tyranny; and 
I journey onward to a land of more hopeful in- 
stitutions. 
In my opinion, the main evil of the present 
democratic institutions of the United States does 
not arise, as is often asserted in Europe, from 
their weakness, but from their irresistible 
strength. I am not so much alarmed at the 
excessive liberty which reigns in that country 
as at the very inadequate securities which exist 
against tyranny. 
When an individual or a party is wronged in 
the United States, to whom can he apply for 
redress? If to public opinion, public opinion 
constitutes the majority; if to the legislature, it 
represents the majority, and implicitly obeys its 
instructions; if to the executive power, it is ap- 
pointed by the majority, and is a passive tool in 
its hands. The publie troops consist of the 
majority under arms; the jury is the majority 
invested with the right of hearing judicial cases; 
and in certain cases, even the judges are elected 
by the majority. However iniquitous or absurd 
the evil of which you complain may be, you must 
submit to it as well as you can. 
If, on the other hand, a legislative power could 
be so constituted as to represent the majority 
without necessarily being the slave of its passions, 
an executive so as to retain a certain degree of 
uncontrolled authority, and a judiciary so as to 
remain independent of the other two powers, a 
government’ would be formed which would still 
be democratic, without incurring any risk of 
tyranny. 
6
-P-A-G-E-19
ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE 
  I do not say that there is a frequent use of 
tyranny in America at the present day; but I 
maintain that no sure barrier is established 
against it, and that the causes whieh mitigate 
the government are to be found in the cireum- 
stanees and the manners of the country more 
than in its laws.

ALFRED DE MUSSET 
Born in 1810, died in 1857; educated at the College of 
Henry Ii in Paris; published “Tales of Spain and Italy,” 
a volume of verse, in 1829; followed by other collections of 
verse in 1831 and 1832; went to Italy in 1833 with George 
Sand, with whom he quarreled in Venice and returned to 
France; published “Confessions of a Child of the Century” 
jn 1836; wrote stories and plays as well as poems; elected 
to the Academy in 1852. 
TITIAN’S SON AFTER A NIGHT AT PLAY?* 
In the month of February of the year 1580 a 
young man was crossing the Piazzeta at Venice 
at early dawn. His clothes were in disorder, his 
eap, from which hung a beautiful searlet feather, 
was pulled down over his ears. He was walking 
with long strides toward the banks of the Sehia- 
voni, and his sword and cloak were dragging 
‘behind him, while with a somewhat disdainful 
foot he picked his way among the fishermen lying 
2¥rom De Musset’s story, “Titian’s Son.” Translated for 
this collection by Hric Arthur Bell. Titian’s son, who was 
named Pomponio, had been destined for the Church, but 
proving wasteful and dissipated, his father caused the ben- 
efice intended for him to be transferred to a nephew. 
Through the death of Titian’s other son Orazio, an artist of 
repute, who died soon after Titian and during the same 
plague, Pomponio inherited the handsome fortune his father 
had left and completely squandered it.

  asleep on the ground. Having arrived at the 
bridge of Paille, he stopt and looked around him. 
The moon was setting behind the Giudecca and 
the dawn was gilding the Ducal Palace. From 
time to time thick smoke or a brilliant light 
could be seen from some neighboring palace. 
Planks, stones, enormous blocks of marble, and 
debris of every kind obstructed the Canal of the 
Prisons. A recent fire had just destroyed the 
home of a patrician which lined its banks. A 
volley of sparks shot up from time to time, and 
by this sinister light an armed soldier could be 
seen keeping watch in the midst of the ruins. 
Our young man, however, did not seem to be 
imprest either with this spectacle of destruction 
or with the beauty of the sky, tinged with the 
rosy colors of the dawning day. He looked for 
some time at the horizon, as if to ease his tired 
eyes; but the brightness of the dawn seemed to 
produce in him a disagreeable effect, for he wrapt 
himself in his cloak and pursued his way at a 
run. . He soon stopt again at the door of a palace, 
where he knocked. A valet, holding a torch in 
his hand, admitted him immediately. As he en- 
tered he turned round, and casting one more 
glance at the sky, exclaimed, ‘‘By Bacchus! my 
earnival has cost me dear.’’ 
This young man was called Pomponio Filippo 
Necellio. He was the second son of Titian, a 
‘youth full of spirit and imagination who had 
aroused in his father the most lofty expectations, 
but whose passion for cards kept him in con- 
tinual dissipation. It was only four years before 
that the great painter and his eldest son, Orazio, 
had died almost at the same time, and young

  Pippo in those four years had already dissipated 
the best part of the immense fortune which the dou- 
ble heritage had given him. Instead of eul- 
tivating the talents which he possest by nature 
and sustaining the glory of his name, he passed 
his days in sleeping and his nights in playing 
at the house of a certain Countess Orsini, or at 
least so-called countess, who made a profession 
of ruining the gilded youth of Venice. Every 
night there assembled at her house a large com- 
pany composed of nobles and courtezans; there 
one supped and played, and as one did not pay 
for one’s supper, it goes without saying that the 
dice helped to indemnify the mistress of the 
house. Meanwhile, the sequins and the Cyprian 
wine began to fiow freely, loving glances were 
exchanged, and the victims, drunk with love and 
wine, lost their money and their reason. 
It is from this dangerous resort that we have 
seen the hero of this story emerge. He had met 
with more than one loss during the night. Be- 
sides having emptied his pockets at eards; the 
only picture he had ever finished, one that the 
connoisseurs had pronounced excellent, had just 
been destroyed in a fire in the Dolfino palace. 
It was an historical subject, treated with a spirit 
and a sureness of touch almost worthy of Titian 
himself. Sold to a rich Senator, this canvas had 
met with the same fate as a great number of 
other previous works of art; the carelessness of 
a valet had turned it to ashes. But this Pippo 
counted the least of his misfortunes; he was only 
thinking of the unlucky star that had lately been 
foliowing him with unusual insistenee and of the 
throws of dice it had made him lose. 
10
-P-A-G-E-23
  ALFRED DE MUSSET 
  Qn entering his house, he began by taking off 
the coverlet which lay on his table and counting 
the money left in his drawer; then, as he was 
of a nature naturally gay and optimistic, after 
he had undrest he sat at the window in his night 
robe. Seeing that it was almost daylight, he 
began to ponder whether he would close the shut- 
ters and get into bed, or get up like everybody 
else. It was a long time since he had seen the 
sun in the east, and he found the sky more 
beautiful than ever. Before deciding whether to 
wake up or go to sleep, he took his choeolate on 
the balcony, in an effort to fight off his drowsi- 
ness. The moment his eyes closed, he would see 
a table, many trembling hands and pale faces, and 
would hear again the sound of the cornets. 
“What fatal luck,’’? he murmured. ‘‘Is it pos- 
sible that one can lose with fifteen?’’? And he 
saw his habitual opponent, old Vespiano Memmo, 
throwing eighteen and taking up the money piled 
on the table. 
He promptly opened his eyelids to get rid of 
the bad dream, and looked at the young girls 
passing on the quay. He seemed to see in the 
distance a masked woman; and was astonished, 
altho it was the time of earnival, for poor people 
do not go masked, and it was strange that at 
such an hour a Venetian lady should be out alone 
on foot. He perceived, however, that what he 
had taken for a mask was the face of a negress. 
On getting a nearer look at her, he saw she was 
not badly formed. She walked very quickly, and 
a puff of wind which forced her checkered skirt 
elose to her limbs, showed her to have a graceful 
figure. Pippo leaned over the balcony and saw 
i
-P-A-G-E-24

  not without surprize that the negress knocked at 
his door. 
The porter failed to open it. 
‘What do you want?’’ cried the young man. 
‘Is it with me that your business lies, brunette? 
My name is Vecellio, and if they are going to 
keep you waiting, I will come and let you in 
myself’? 
‘The negress lifted her head. \ 
“¢Your name is Pomponio Vecellio?’? 
‘¢YVes, or Pippo, whichever you like.’” 
“‘You are the son of Titian?’’ 
“At your service. What can I do to please 
you?’” 
Having cast on Pippo a rapid and curious 
glance, the negress took a few steps backward, 
and skilfully threw up into the baleony a little 
box rolled in paper, and then promptly fied, 
turning round from time to time. Pippo picked 
up the box, opened it, and found a pretty purse 
wrapt in cotton. He rightly suspected that he 
might find under the cotton a note that would 
explain this adventure. The note was found in- 
deed, but it was as mysterious as the rest, for it 
contained only these words: ‘‘Do not spend too 
readily what I enclose herein; when you leave 
home, charge me with one piece of gold, It is 
enough for one day; and if in the evening you 
have any of it left, however little, it may be 
you will find some poor person who will thank 
you for it.’’ 
The young man examined the box in a hundred 
different ways, scrutinized the purse, looked once 
more on to the quay, and at length realized that 
he had learned all he could. ‘‘Of a truth,’’ 
12

  thought he, ‘‘this is a strange present, but it 
eomes at a cruelly awkward moment. The advice 
they give me is good, but it is too late to tell 
people to swim when they are already at the 
bottom of the Adriatic. Who the devil could have 
sent me this?’’

THEOPHILE GAUTIER 
Born in 1812, died in 1872; studied painting in Paris, but 
soon joined the romantic literary movement; his first book, 
“Podsies,” published in 1880; an art and dramatic critic 
1837-48; traveled in Spain, Holland, Italy, Greece and Rus- 
sia in 1840-58, publishing books describing those countries 
and novels with them for scenes; many other novels followed, 
with occasional collections of verse and criticism. 
PHARAOH’S ENTRY INTO THEBES* 
At length their chariot reached the maneuvering- 
ground, an immense enclosure, carefully leveled, 
used for splendid military displays. Terraces, 
one above the other, which must have employed 
for years the thirty nations led away into slavery, 
formed a frame en relief for the gigantic paral- 
lelogram; sloping walls built of erude bricks lined 
these terraces; their tops were covered, several 
rows deep, by hundreds of thousands of Egyp- 
tians,. whose white or brightly colored costumes 
blazed in the sun with that perpetually restless 
movement which characterizes a multitude, even 
when it appears motionless; behind this line of 
spectators the cars, chariots, and litters, with 
their drivers, grooms, and slaves, looked like the 
encampment of an emigrating nation, such was 
their immense number; for Thebes, the marvel of 
the ancient world, counted more inhabitants than 
did some kingdoms.

——  — 
The fine, even sand of the vast arena, bordered © 
with a million heads, gleamed like mica dust be- 
neath the light, falling from a sky as blue as 
the enamel on the statuettes of Osiris. On the 
south side of the field the terraces were broken, 
making way for a road which stretched toward 
Upper Ethiopia, the whole length of the Libyan 
chain. In the corresponding corner, the opening 
in the massive brick walls prolonged the roads 
to the Rhamses-Maiamoun palace. . . 
A frightful uproar, rumbling, deep, and ‘mighty 
as that of an approaching sea, arose in the dis- 
tance, and drowned the thousand murmurs of the 
crowd, like the roar of the lion which hushes the 
barking of the jackals. Soon the noise of instru- 
ments of musie could be distinguished amidst this 
terrestrial thunder, produced by the chariot 
wheels and the rhythmic pace of the foot-soldiers. 
A sort of reddening cloud, like that raised by the 
desert blasts, filled the sky in that direction, yet 
the wind had gone down; there was not a breath 
of air, and the smallest branches of the palm- 
trees hung motionless, as if they had been carved 
on a granite capital; not a hair moved on the 
women’s moist foreheads, and the fluted stream- 
ers of their head-dresses hung loosely down their 
backs. This powdery fog was caused by the 
marching army, and hung over it like a fallow 
eloud. q 
The tumult increased; the whirlwinds of dust ‘ 
opened, and the first files of musicians entered 
the immense arena, to the great satisfaction of 
the multitude, who in spite of its respect for his 
Majesty were beginning to tire of waiting beneath 
a sun which would have melted any other skulls

  than those of the Egyptians. The advance guard 
of musicians halted for several instants; colleges 
of priests, deputations of the principal inhab- 
itants of Thebes, crossed the maneuvering-ground 
to meet the Pharaoh, and arranged themselves in 
a row in postures of the most profound respect, 
in such manner as to give free passage to the 
procession. The band, which alone was a smali 
army, consisted of drums, tabors, trumpets, and 
sistras. . 
The first squad passed, blowing a deafening 
blast = their short clarions of polished brass 
which Sone like gold. Each of these trumpeters 
earried a second horn under his arm, as if the 
instrument might grow weary sooner than the 
man. The costume of these men consisted of 3. 
short tunic, fastened by a sash with ends falling 
in front; a small band, in which were stuck two 
ostrich-feathers hanging over on either side, 
bound their thick hair. These plumes, so worn, 
recalled to mind the antennw of scarabei, and 
gave the wearers an odd look of being insects. 
The drammers, clothed in a simple gathered 
skirt, and naked to the waist, beat the onagra- 
skin heads of their rounded drums with syeamore- 
wood drumsticks, their instruments suspended by 
leather shoulder-belts, and observed the time 
which a drum-major marked for them by re- 
peatedly turning toward them and clapping his 
hands. After the drummers came the sistra- 
players, who shook their instruments by a quick, 
abrupt motion, and made at measured interval: 
the metal links ring on the four bronze bars. 
The tabor-players carried their oblong instre- 
ments erosswise, held up by a scarf passed aronud

  the neck, and struck the lightly stretched parch- 
ment with both hands. 
Each company of musicians numbered at least 
two hundred men; but the hurricane of noise 
produced by trumpets, drums, tabors, and sistras, 
and which would have drawn blood from the ears 
. inside a palace, was none too loud or too un- 
- bearable beneath the vast cupola of heaven, in 
the midst of this immense open space, amongst 
this buzzing crowd, at the head of this army 
which would baffle nomenclators, and which was 
now advancing with a roar as of great waters. 
_After the musicians came the barbarian cap- 
tives, strangely formed, with brutish faces, black 
skins, woolly hair, resembling apes as much as 
men, and drest in the costume of their country, 
a short skirt above the hips, held by a single 
brace, embroidered in different colors. An in- 
genious and whimsical cruelty had suggested the 
way in which the prisoners were chained. Some 
were bound with their elbows drawn behind their 
baeks; others with their hands lifted above their 
heads, in a still more painful position; one had 
his wrists fastened in wooden cangs (instruments 
of torture, still used in China); another was half- 
strangled in a sort of pillory; or a chain of them 
were linked together by the same rope, each vic- 
tim. having a knot round his neck. It seemed as 
if those who had bound these unfortunates had 
found a pleasure in forcing them into unnatural 
positions; and they advaneed before their con- 
queror with awkward and tottering gait, rolling 
their large eyes and contorted with pain. Guards 
walked beside them, regulating their step by 
beating them with staves. .

  A wide gorget with seven rows of enamels, pre- 
cious stones, and golden beads fell over the 
Phsraoh’s chest and gleamed brightly in the sun- 
light. His upper garment was a sort of loose 
shirt, with pink and blaek squares; the ends, 
lengthening into narrow slips, were wound sev- 
eral times about his bust and bound it closely; 
the sleeves, cut short near the shoulder, and bor- 
dered with intersecting lines of gold, red, and 
blue, exposed his round, strong arms, the left 
furnished with a large metal wristband, meant 
to lessen the vibration of the string when he 
discharged an arrow from his triangular bow; and 
the right, ornamented by a bracelet in the form 
of a serpent in several coils, held a long gold 
scepter with a lotus bud at the end. The rest of 
his body was wrapt in drapery of the finest linen, 
minutely plaited, bound about the waist by a belt 
inlaid with small enamel and gold plates. Be- 
tween the band and the belt his torso appeared, 
shining and polished like pink granite shaped by 
a cunning workman. Sandals with returned toes, 
like skates, shod his long narrow feet, placed 
together like those of the gods on the temple 
walls. 
His smooth beardless face, with large clearly 
eut features, which it seemed beyond any human 
power to disturb, and which the blood of common 
life did not color, with its death-like pallor, sealed 
lips, enormous eyes enlarged with black lines, the 
lids no more lowered than those of the sacred 
hawk, inspired by its very immobility a feeling 
of respectful fear. One might have thought that 
these fixt eyes were searching for eternity and the 
Infinite; they never seemed to rest on surrounding 
18

  objects. The satiety of pleasures, the surfeit of 
wishes satisfied as soon as exprest, the isolation 
of a demigod who has no equal among mortals, 
the disgust for perpetual adoration, and as it 
were weariness of continual triumph, had forever 
frozen this face, implacably gentle and of granite 
serenity. Osiris judging the souls could not have 
had a more majestic and calm expression. A 
large tame lion, lying by his side, stretched out 
its enormous paws like a sphinx on its pedestal, 
and blinked its yellow eyes. 
A rope, attached to the litter, bound the war 
chariots of the vanquished chiefs to the Pharaoh. 
He dragged them behind him like animals in 
leash. These men, with fierce despairing faces, 
their elbows drawn together by a strap and form- 
ing an ungraceful angle, tottered awkwardly at 
every motion of the chariots, driven by Egyp- 
tians. 
Next came the chariots of the young princes 
royal, drawn by thoroughbred horses, elegantly 
and nobly formed, with slender legs, sinewy houghs, 
their manes eut short like a brush, harnessed 
by twos, tossing their red-plumed heads, with 
metal-bossed headstalls and frontlets. A curved 
pole, upheld on their withers, covered with scarlet 
panels, two collars surmounted by balls of polished 
brass, bound together by a light yoke bent like 
a bow with upturned ends; a bellyband and 
breastband elaborately stitched and embroidered, 
and rich housings with red or blue stripes and 
fringed with tassels, completed this strong, grace- 
ful, and ight harness, . 
Tn the wake of the princes followed the chari- 
ots, the Egyptian cavalry, twenty thousand in

  number, each drawn by two horses and holding 
three men. They advanced ten in a line, the 
axletrees perilously near together, but never com- 
ing in contact with each other, so great was the 
address of the drivers. 
The stamping of the horses, held in with dif- 
fieulty, the thundering of the bronze-covered 
wheels, the metallic clash of weapons, gave to 
this line something forinidable and imposing 
enough to raise terror in the most intrepid 
bosoms. The helmets, plumes, and breastplates 
dotted with red, green, and yellow, the gilded 
bows and brass swords, glittered and blazed ter- 
ribly in the light of the sun, open in the sky, 
above the Libyan chain, like a great Osirian eye; 
and it was felt that the onslaught of such an 
army must sweep away the nations like a whirl- 
wind which drives a light straw before it. 
Beneath these innumerable wheels the earth 
resounded and trembled, as if it had been moved 
by some convulsion of nature. 
To the chariots succeeded the battalions of in- 
fantry, marching in order, their shields on the 
left arm; in the right hand the lance, curved club, 
bow, sling, or ax, according as they were armed; 
the heads of these soldiers were covered with 
helmets, adorned with two horsehair tails, their 
bodies girded with a ecuirass belt of ecrocodile- 
skin. Their impassible look, the perfect reg- 
ularity of their movements, their reddish copper 
complexions, deepened by a recent expedition to 
the burning regions of Upper Ethiopia, their 
clothing powdered with the desert sand, they 
awoke admiration by their discipline and courage. 
With soldiers like those Egypt could conquer the

  world. After them came the allied troops, recog- 
nizable from the outlandish form of their head- 
pieces, which looked like truncated miters, or 
were surmounted by erescents spitted on sharp 
points. Their wide-bladed swords and jagged 
axes must-have produced. wounds which could 
not be healed. 
Slaves carried on their shoulders or on barrows 
the spoils enumerated by the herald, and wild- 
beast tamers dragged behind them leashed pan- 
thers, cheetahs, crouching down as if trying to 
hide themselves, ostriches fluttering their wings, 
giraffes which overtopped the crowd by the entire 
length of their necks, and even brown bears— 
taken, they said, in the Mountains of the Moon. 
The procession was still passing, long after the 
King had entered his palace.

YONGEVILLE AND ITS PEOPLE* 
Yonvinis-L’Appave— so called from an old 
Capuchin abbey of which not even the ruins re- 
main—is a market-town twenty-four miles from 
Rouen, between the Abbeville and Beauvais roads, 
at the foot of a valley watered by the Rieule, 
a little river that runs into the Andelle after 
turning three water-mills near its mouth, where 
there are a few trout that the lads amuse them- 
selves by fishing for on Sundays. 
We leave the highroad at a Boissiére and keep 
straight on to the top of Leux hill, whence the 
valley is seen. The river that runs through it 
makes of it, as it were, two regions with distinet 
physiognomies—all on the left is pasture land, 
all on the right arable. The meadow stretches 
under a bulge of low hills to join at the back 
with the pasture land of the Bray country, while 
on the eastern side the plain, gently rising, 
broadens out, showing as far as eye can follow 
its blonde eorn-fields. The water, flowing by the

  grass, divides with a white line the color of the 
roads and of the plains, and the country is like 
a great unfolded mantle with a green velvet cape 
bordered with a fringe of silver. . 
Before us, on the verge of the horizon, lie the 
oaks of the forest of Argueil, with the steeps of 
St. Jean hills scarred from top to bottom with 
red irregular lines; they are rain-tracks, and 
these brick tones, standing out in narrow streaks 
against the gray color of the mountain, are due 
to the quantity of iron springs that flow beyond 
in the neighboring country. 
Here we are on the confines of Normandy, 
Pieardy, and the Ile-de-France, a bastard land, 
whose language is without accent as its land- 
seape is without character. It is there that they 
make the worst Neuchatel cheeses of all the 
arrondissement; and, on the other hand, farming 
is costly because so much manure is needed to 
enrich this friable soil, full of sand and flints. 
Up to 1835 there was no practicable road for 
getting to Yonville; but about this time a cross- 
road was made which joins that of Abbeville 
to that of Amiens, and is oceasionally used by 
the Rouen wagoners on their way to Flanders. 
Yonville-l’Abbaye has remained stationary in 
spite of its ‘‘new outlet.’’ Instead of improving 
the soil, they persist in keeping up the pasture- 
lands, however depreciated they may be in value, 
and the lazy borough, growing away from the 
plain, has naturally spread riverward. It is seen 
from afar sprawling along the banks like a cow- 
herd taking a siesta by the water-side. 
At the foot of the hill beyond the bridge begins 
a roadway, planted with young aspens, that leads 
23
-P-A-G-E-36

  in a straight line to the first houses in the place. 
These, fenced in by hedges, are in the middle 
of courtyards full of straggling buildings, wine- 
presses, cart-sheds, and distilleries scattered un- 
der thick trees, with ladders, poles, or seythes 
hung on to the branches. The thatched roofs, 
like fur caps drawn over eyes, reach down over 
about a third of the low windows, whose coarse 
convex glasses have knots in the middle like the 
bottoms of bottles. Against the plaster wall, 
diagonally crossed by black joists, a meager pear- 
tree sometimes leans, and the ground floors have 
at their door a small swing-gate, to keep out 
the chicks that come pilfering erumbs of bread - 
steeped in cider on the threshold. But the court- 
yards grow narrower, the houses closer together, 
and the fences disappear; a bundle of ferns 
swings under a window from the end of a broom- 
stick; there is a blacksmith’s forge and then a 
wheelwright’s, with two or three new carts out~- 
side that partly block up the way. Then across 
an open space appears a white house beyond a 
grass mound ornamented by a cupid, his finger 
on his lips; two brass vases are at each end of 
a flight of steps; scutcheons blaze upon the door. 
It is the notary’s house, and the finest in the 
place. 
The church is on the other side of the street, 
twenty paces farther down, at the entrance of 
the square. The little cemetery that surrounds 
it, elosed in by a wall breast-high, is so full of 
graves that the old stones, level with the ground, 
form a continuous pavement, on which the grass 
of itself has marked out regular green squares. 
The ehurch was rebuilt during the last years of 
24

the reign of Charles X. The wooden roof is 
beginning to rot from the top, and here and there 
has black hollows in its blue color. Over the 
door, where the organ should be, is a loft for 
the men, with a spiral staircase that reverberates 
under their wooden shoes. 
The daylight coming through the plain glass 
windows falls obliquely upon the pews ranged 
along the walls, which are adorned here and there 
with a straw mat bearing beneath it the words 
in large letters, ‘‘Mr. So-and-So’s pew.’’ Far- 
ther on, at the spot where the building narrows, 
the confessional forms a pendant to a statuette 
of the Virgin, clothed in a satin robe, eoifed with 
a tulle veil sprinkled with silver stars, and with 
red cheeks, like an idol of the Sandwich Islands, 
and, finally, a copy of the ‘‘Holy Family, pre- 
sented by the Minister of the Interior,’’ over- 
looking the high altar, between four candlesticks, 
closes in the perspective. The choir stalls, of 
deal wood, have been left unpainted. 
The market—that is to say, a tiled roof sup- 
ported by some twenty posts—oecupies of itself 
about half the public square of Yonville. The 
town-hall, constructed ‘‘from the designs of a 
Paris architect,’’ is a sort of Greek temple that 
forms the corner next to the chemist’s shop. On 
the ground floor are three Ionic columns, and on 
the first floor is a semicircular gallery, while the 
dome that crowns it is occupied by a Gallic cock, 
resting one foot upon the ‘‘Charte’’ and holding 
in the other the scales of Justice. 
But that which most attracts the eye. is, op- 
posite the Lion d’Or inn, the chemist’s shop of 
Monsieur Homais. In the evening especially its 
25

a 
argand lamp is lighted up, and the red and green 
jars that embellish his shop-front throw far across 
the street their two streams of color; then across 
them, as if in Bengal lights, is seen the shadow 
of the chemist leaning over his desk. His house 
from top to bottom is placarded with inscriptions 
written in large hand, round hand, printed hand: 
‘‘Vichy, Seltzer, Barége waters, blood purifiers, 
Raspail patent medicine, Arabian racahout, Dar- 
eet lozenges, Regnault paste, trusses, baths, hy-~ 
gienie chocolate,’’ etc. And the signboard, which 
takes up all the breadth of the shop, bears, in 
gold letters, ‘‘Homais, Chemist.’’ Then, at the 
pack of the shop, behind the great scales fixt to 
the counter, the word ‘‘Laboratory’’ appears on 
a seroll above‘a glass door, which about half-way 
up once more repeats ‘‘Homais’’ in gold letters 
on a black ground. 
Beyond this there is nothing to see at Yonville. 
The street—the only one—a gunshot in length, 
and flanked by a few shops on each side, stops 
short at the turn of the highroad. If it is left to 
the right hand and the foot of the St. Jean hills 
followed, the cemetery is soon reached. 
At the time of the cholera, in order to enlarge 
this, a piece of wall was pulled down, and three 
acres of land by its side purchased; but all the 
new portion is almost tenantless; the tombs, as 
heretofore, continue to crowd together toward the 
gate. The keeper, who is at onee grave-digger 
and church-beadle—thus making a double profit 
out of the parish corpses—has taken advantage of 
the unused plot of ground to plant potatoes there. 
From year to year, however, his small field grows 
smaller, and when there is an epidemic, he does

at last said to him one day. This grim remark 
made him reflect; if checked him for some time; 
but to this day he carries on the cultivation of 
his little tubers, and even maintains stoutly that 
they grow naturally. 
Since the events about to be narrated, nothing 
in fact has changed at Yonville. The tin tricolor 
flag swings at the top of the church-steeple; the 
two chintz streamers still flutter in the wind 
from the linen-draper’s; the chemist’s fetuses, 
like lumps of white amadou, rot more and more 
in their turbid alcohol, and above the big door 
of the inn the old golden lion, faded by rain, still 
shows passers-by its poodle mane. 
On the evening when the Bovarys were to ar- 
rive at Yonville, Widow Lefrancois, the landlady 
of this inn, was so very busy that she sweated 
great drops as she moved her saucepans. To- 
morrow was market-day. The meat had to be 
cut beforehand, the fowls drawn, the soup and 
coffee made. Moreover, she had the boarders’ 
meal to see to, and that of the doctor, his wife, 
and their servant; the billiard-room was echoing 
with bursts of laughter; three millers in the small 
parlor were calling for brandy; the wood was 
blazing, the brazen pan was hissing, and on the 
long kitchen-table, amid the quarters of raw 
mutton, rose piles of plates that rattled with the 
shaking of the block on which spinach was being 
chopped. From the poultry-yard was heard the 
screaming of the fowls whom the servant was 
chasing in order to wring their necks.

A man slightly marked with smallpox, in green

a gold tassel was warming his back at the chim- 
ney. His face exprest nothing but self-satisfac- 
tion, and he appeared to take life as calmly as 
the goldfinch suspended over his head in its 
wicker cage—this was the chemist. 
‘‘Artémisel’’ shouted the landlady, ‘‘chop

to offer the guests you are expecting! Good 
heavens! Those furniture-movers are beginning 
their racket in the billiard-room again; and their

Call Polyte and tell bim to put it up. Only to 
think, Monsieur Homais, that since morning they 
have had about fifteen games and drunk eight 
jars of cider! Why, they’ll tear my cloth for 
me,’’ she went on, looking at them from a dis- 
tance, her strainer in her hand. 
“That wouldn’t be much of a loss,’’ replied 
Monsieur Homais. ‘‘You would buy another.’?’

“Since that one is coming to pieces, Madame 
Lefrancois. I tell you again you are doing your-

want narrow pockets and heavy cues. Hazards 
aren’t played now; everything is changed! One 
must keep pace with the times! Just look at

chemist went on:

interrupted the landlady, shrugging her fat shoul-

as the Lion d’Or exists people will come to it. 
We've feathered our nest; while one of these 
days you'll find the Café Frangais closed with a 
big placard on the shutters. Change my billiard-

table that comes in so handy for folding the 
washing, and on which, in the hunting season, I 
have slept six visitors! But that dawdler Hivert 
doesn’t come!’’ 
‘Are you waiting for him for your gentlemen’s

“Wait for him! And what about Monsieur

come in, for he hasn’t his equal under the sun 
for punctuality. He must always have his seat 
in the small parlor. He’d rather die than dine 
anywhere else. And so squeamish as he is, and 
so particular about the cider! Not like Monsieur 
Léon; he sometimes comes at seven, or even half- 
past, and he doesn’t so much as look at. what he 
eats. Such a nice young man! Never speaks a

AN EMPIRE IN ROBUST YOUTH* 
Tue political condition of the world was most 
melancholy. All power was concentrated at Rome 
and in the legions. The most shameful and de- 
grading scenes were daily enacted. The Roman 
aristocracy, which had conquered the world, and 
which alone of all the people had any voice in 
public business under the Cesays, had abandoned 
itself to a saturnalia of the most outrageous 
wickedness the human race ever witnessed. Cz-~- 
sar and Augustus, in establishing the imperial 
power, saw perfeetly the necessities of the age. 
The world was so low in its political relations 
that no other form of government was possible.

  inees, the ancient constitution, which was based 
upon the existence of a privileged patrician class, 
a kind of obstinate and malevolent Tories, could 
not continue. 
But Augustus had signally neglected every sug- 
gestion of true policy by leaving the future to 
chance. Destitute of any canon of hereditary 
succession, of any settled rules concerning adop- 
tion, and of any law regulating election, Cesar- 
ism was like an enormous load on the deck of 
a vessel without ballast. The most terrible shocks 
were inevitable. Three times in a century, under 
Caligula, Nero, and Domitian, the greatest power 
that was ever united in one person fell into the 
hands of most extravagant and execrable men. 
Horrors were enacted which have hardly been 
surpassed by the monsters of the Mongol dynas- 
ties. In that fatal list of monarchs one is re- 
dueed to apologizing for a Tiberius, who only at- 
tained thorough detestableness toward the close of 
his life; and for a Claudius, who was only eceen- 
tric, blundering, and badly advised. 
Rome beeame a school of vice and cruelty. It 
should be added that the vice came, in a great 
degree, from the East, from those parasites of 
low rank and those infamous men whom Egypt 
and Syria sent to Rome, and who, profiting by 
the oppression of the true Romans, succeeded in 
attaining great influence over the wretches who 
governed. The most disgusting ignominies of 
the empire, such as the apotheosis of the em- 
perors and their deification during life, came 
from the East, and particularly from Egypt, 
which was at that period one of the most corrupt 
countries on the face of the earth.

The lofty traditions of pride and virtue, which

true and noble natures as those of Quintilian,

need not be wholly despaired of. The corruption 
ofthe surface did not extend to the great mass 
of seriousness and honor which existed in the 
better Roman society, and many examples are

  but they had enjoyed but little influence, and had 
been cast into the shade by the freedmen and 
favorite slaves of the Emperor. Thus we find 
men of. the first ability occupying high posts un- 
der Nero. The framework was good. The acces- 
sion of bad emperors, disastrous as it was, could 
not change at once the general tendency of af- 
fairs, and the principles of the government. The 
empire, far from being in its decay, was in the 
full strength of vigorous youth. Decay will come, 
but two centuries later; and, strange to say, 
under much more worthy monarchs. In its po- 
litical phase the situation was analogous to that 
of France, which, deprived by the revolution of 
any established rule for the succession, has yet 
passed through so many perilous changes without 
greatly injuring its internal organization or its 
national strength. In its moral aspect, the period 
under consideration may be compared to the 
eighteenth century, an epoch entirely corrupt, if 
we form our judgment from the memoirs, manu- 
scripts, literature, and anecdotes of the time, but 
in which, nevertheless, some families maintained 
the greatest austerity of morals. 
Philosophy joined hands with the better fam- 
ilies of Rome, and resisted nobly. The stoic 
school produced the lofty characters of Cremutius 
Cordus, Thraseas, Arria, Helvidius Priseus, An- 
neus Cornutus, and Musonius Rufus, admirable 
masters of aristocratic virtue. The rigidity and 
exaggeration of this school arose from the hor- 
rible cruelty of the Caesars. The continual 
thought of a good man was how to inure himself 
to suffering, and prepare himself for death. Lu- 
cian, in bad taste, and Persius with superior

  talent, but gave utterance to the loftiest senti- 
ments of a great soul. Seneca the philosopher, 
Pliny the Elder, and Papirius Fabianus kept up 
a high standard of science and philosophy. Every 
one did not yield; there were a few wise men 
left. Too often, however, they had no resource 
but death. The ignoble portions of humanity at 
times got the upper hand. Then madness and 
eruelty ruled the hour, and made of Rome a 
veritable hell. 
The government, altho so fearfully unstable at 
Rome, was much better in the provinces. At a 
distance the shocks which agitated the capital 
were hardly felt. In spite of its defects, the 
Roman administration was far superior to the 
Kingdoms and commonuwealths it had supplanted. 
The time for sovereign municipalities had long 
gone by. Those little states had destroyed them- 
selves by their egotism, their jealousies, and their 
ignorance or neglect of individual freedom. The 
ancient life of Greece, all struggle, all external, 
no longer satisfied any one. It had been glorious 
in its day, but that brilliant democratic Olympus 
of demigods had lost its freshness, and become 
dry, cold, unmeaning, vain, superficial, and lack- 
ing in both head and heart. Hence the suceess 
of the Macedonian rule, and afterward of the 
Roman. The empire had not yet fallen into the 
error of excessive centralization. Until the time 
of Diocletian, the provinces and cities enjoyed 
much liberty. Kingdoms almost independent ex- 
isted in Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, Lesser Ar- 
menia, and Thrace, under the protection of Rome. 
These kingdoms became factions after Caligula 
only because the profound policy of Augustus 
34

concerning them was diverged from in sueceeding 
reigns, . : 
The numerous free cities were governed ac- 
cording to their own laws, and had the legislative 
power and magistracy of autonomic states. Until 
the third century their municipal decree com- 
menced with the formula, ‘‘The Senate and Peo- 
ple of—’’. The theaters were not simply placed 
for scenie amusement, but were foci of opinion 
and discussion. Most of the towns were, in dif- 
ferent ways, little commonwealths. The munici- 
pal spirit was very strong. They had lost only 
the power to declare war, a fatal power which 
made the world a field of carnage. ‘‘The benefits 
eonferred by Rome upon mankind’’ were the 
theme of adulatory addresses everywhere, to 
which, however, it would be unjust to deny some 
sincerity. The doctrine of ‘‘the Peace of Rome,’’ 
the idea of a vast democracy organized under 
Roman protection, lay at the bottom of all polit- 
ical speculations. A Greek rhetorician displays 
vast erudition in proving that Roman glory 
should be claimed by all the branches of the 
Hellenic race as a common patrimony. In regard 
to Syria, Asia Minor, and Egypt, we may say that 
the Roman conquest did not destroy any of their 
liberties. Those nations had either been already 
long dead to politieal life, or had never enjoyed it. 
Finally, in spite of the extortions of governors 
and of the violence which is inseparable from 
despotic sway, the world had in many respects 
never been so well off. An administration coming 
from a remote center was so great an advantage, 
that even the rapacious pretors of the latter days 
of the republic had failed to render it unpopular. 
35
-P-A-G-E-48

  The Julian law had also narrowed down the 
scope of abuses and peculations. The follies or 
ernelties of the emperor, except under Nero, 
reached only the Roman aristocracy and the im- 
mediate followers of the prince. Never had men 
who did not care to busy themselves about pol- 
ities been able to live more at ease. The ancient 
republics, in which every one was compelled to 
take part in the factions, were very uncomfort- 
able places of residence. There was continually 
going on-some disorganization or proscription. 
But under the empire the time seemed made 
expressly for great proselytism which should 
overrule both the quarrels of neighborhoods and 
the rivalry of dynasties. Attacks on liberty were 
much more frequently owing to the remnants of 
the provincial or communal authority than to the 
Roman administration. Of this truth we have 
had and shall have many occasions to take note. 
For those of the conquered -countries where 
political privileges had been unknown for ages, 
and which lost nothing but the right of destroying 
themselves by continual wars, the empire was 
such an era of prosperity and well-being as they 
had never before experienced; and we may add, 
without being paradoxical, that it was also for 
them an era of liberty. On the one hand, a 
freedom of ecommerce and industry, of which the 
Grecian state had no conception, became possible. 
On the other hand, the new régime could not 
but be favorable to freedom of thought. This 
freedom is always greater under a monarchy than 
under the rule of jealous and narrow-minded eiti- 
zens, and it was unknown in the ancient repub- 
lies. The Greeks accomplished great things with- 
36

  out it, thanks to the incomparable force of their 
genius; but we must uot forget that Athens had 
a complete inquisition. 
There was, indeed, under the empire more than 
one arbitrary decree against the philosophers, 
but it was always called forth by their entering 
into political sehemes. We may search in vain 
the Roman law before Constantine for a single 
passage against freedom of thought; and the his- 
tory of the imperial government furnishes no 
instance of a prosecution for entertaining an 
abstract doctrine. No scientific man was mo- 
lested. Men like Galen, Lucan, and Plotinus, 
who would have gone to the stake in the Middle 
Age, lived tranquilly under the protection of 
the law. The empire inaugurated liberty in this 
respect; it extinguished the despotic sovereignty 
of the family, the town, and the tribe, and re- 
placed or tempered it by that of the state. But 
despotie power is the more vexatious the nar- 
rower its sphere of action. The old republics 
and the feudal system opprest individuals much 
more than did the state. The empire at times 
persecuted Christianity most severely, but at least 
it did not arrest its progress. Republics, how- 
ever, would have overcome the new faith. Even 
Judaism would have smothered it but for the 
pressure of Roman authority. The Roman magis- 
trates were all that hindered the Pharisees from 
destroying Christianity at the outset.

THACKERAY AS A SATIRIST* 
Tue novel of manners in England multiplies, 
and for this there are several reasons: first, it 
is born there, and every plant thrives well in 
its own soil; secondly, it is a natural outlet: 
there is no music in England as in Germany, or 
‘conversation as in France; and men who must 
think and feel find in it a means of feeling and 
thinking. On the other hand, women take part 
in it with eagerness; amidst the stagnation of 
gallantry and the coldness of religion, it gives 
scope for imagination and dreams. Finally, by 
its minute details and practical counsels, it opens 
up a career to the precise and moral mind. The 
critic thus is, as it were, swamped in this copious- 
ness; he must select in order to grasp the whole,

  and confine himself to a few in order to em- 
brace all. 
In this crowd two men have appeared of supe- 
rior talent, original and contrasted, popular on 
the same grounds, ministers to the same cause, 
moralists in comedy and drama, defenders of nat- 
ural sentiments against social institutions; who, 
by the precision of their pictures, the depth of 
their observations, the succession and bitterness 
of their attacks, have renewed, with other views 
and in another style, the old combative spirit of 
Swift and Fielding. 
One, more ardent, more expansive, wholly given 
up to rapture, an impassioned painter of erude 
and dazzling pictures, a lyric prose-writer, omnip- 
otent in laughter and tears, plunged into fan- 
tastic invention, painful sensibility, vehement 
buffoonery; and by the boldness of bis style, the 
excess of his emotions, the grotesque familiarity 
of his caricatures, he has displayed all the forces 
and weaknesses of an artist, all the audacities, 
all the suecesses, and all the oddities of the 
imagination, 
The other, more contained, better informed and 
stronger, a lover of moral dissertations, a coun- 
selor of the public, a sort of lay preacher, less 
bent on defending the poor, more bent on cen- 
suring man, has brought to the aid of satire a 
sustained common sense, a great knowledge of 
the heart, consummate cleverness, powerful rea- 
soning, a treasure of meditated hatred, and has 
persecuted vice with all the weapons of reflec- 
tion. By this contrast the one completes the other; 
and we may form ‘an exact idea of English taste, 
by placing the portrait of William Makepeace

  Thackeray by the side of that of Charles Dickens. 
No wonder if in England a novelist writes 
satires. A gloomy and reflective man is impelled 
to it by his character; he is still further impelled 
by the surrounding manners. He is not permitted 
to contemplate passions as poetic powers; he is 
bidden to appreciate them as moral qualities. His 
pietures become sentences; he is a counselor 
rather than an observer, a judge rather than an 
artist. We see by what machinery Thackeray has 
changed novel into satire. . . . 
Who is he; and what is the value of this lit- 
erature of which he is one of the princes? At 
bottom, like every literature, it is a definition 
of man; and to judge it, we must compare it 
with man. We can do so now; we have just 
studied a mind, Thackeray himself; we have con- 
sidered his faculties, their connections, results, 
their different degrees; we have before our eyes 
a model of human nature. We have a right to 
judge of the copy by the model, and to control 
the definition which his novels lay down by the 
definition which his character furnishes. 
The two definitions are contrary, and his por- 
trait is a criticism on his talent. We have seen 
that in him the same faculties produce the beauti- 
ful and the ugly, foree and weakness, success 
and failure; that moral reflection, after having 
provided him with every satirical power, debases 
him in art; that, after having spread over his 
contemporary novels a tone of. vulgarity and 
falseness, it raises his historical novel to the 
level of the finest productions; that the same 
constitution of mind teaches him the sarcastie 
and violent, as well as the modulated and simple 
40

style, the bitterness and harshness of hate with 
the effusion and delicacy of love. The evil and 
the good, the beautiful and the ugly, the repul- 
sive and the agreeable, are in him then but re- 
moter effects, of slight importance, born of 
changing cireumstances, acquired and fortuitous 
qualities, not essential and primitive, different 
forms which different streams present in the same 
current. . 
So it is with other men. Doubtless moral 
qualities are of the first rank; they are the motive 
power of civilization, and constitute the nobleness 
of the individual; society exists by them alone, 
and by them alone man is great. But if they 
are the finest fruit of the human plant, they are 
not its root; they give us our value, but do not 
constitute our elements. Neither the vices nor 
the virtues of man are his nature; to praise or 
to blame him is not to know him; approbation 
or disapprobation does not define him; the names 
of good or bad tell us nothing of what he is. 
Put the robber Cartouche. in an Italian court 
of the fifteenth century; he would be a great 
statesman. Transport this nobleman, stingy and 
narrow-minded, into a shop; he will be an ex- 
emplary tradesman. This public man, of in- 
flexible probity, is in bis drawing-room an in- 
tolerable coxeomb. This father of a family, so 
humane, is an idiotie politician. Change a virtue 
in its eireumstances, and it becomes a vice; 
change a vice in its cireumstances, and it becomes 
a virtue. Regard the same quality from two 
sides; on one it is a fault, on the other a merit. 
The essential man is found concealed far below 
these moral badges; they only point out the use-

  ful or noxious effect of our inner constitution: 
they do not reveal our inner constitution. 
They are safety or advertising lights attached 
to our names, to warn the passer-by to avoid 
or approach us; they are not the explanatory 
chart of our being. 
Our true essence consists in the causes of our 
* good or bad qualities, and these causes are dis- 
eovered in the temperament, the species and 
degree of imagination, the amount and velocity 
of attention, the magnitude and direction of 
primitive passions. A character is a force, like 
gravity, or steam, capable, as it may happen, of 
pernicious or profitable effects, and which must 
be defined otherwise than by the amount of the 
weight it can lift or the havoc it can cause. It 
is therefore to ignore man, to reduce him, as 
Thackeray and English literature generally do, 
to an aggregate of virtues and vices; it is to 
lose sight in him of all but the exterior and 
ocial side; it is to neglect the inner and natural 
lement. We will find the same fault in English 
riticism, always moral, never psychological, bent 
n exactly measuring the degree of human hon- 
sty, ignorant of the mechanism of our sentiments 
ad faculties; we will find the same fault in 
inglish religion, which is but an emotion or a 
liseipline; im their philosophy, destitute of meta- 
shysies; and if we ascend to the source, according 
0 the rule which derives vices from virtues, and 
‘irtues from vices, we will see all these weak- 
1esses derived from their native energy, their 
practical education, and that kind of severe and 
religious poetic instinct which has in time past 
made them Protestant and Puritan.

WHEN THE KING GOT UP FOR THE DAY? 
Tue king is expected to keep the entire aris- 
tocracy busy; eonsequently, to make a display of 
himself, to pay back with his own person, at all 
hours even the most private, even on getting out 
of bed, and even in his bed. In the morning, at 
the hour named by himself beforehand, the head 
valet awakens him; five series of persons enter 
in turn to perform their duty, and, ‘‘altho very . 
‘large, there are days when the waiting-rooms can . 
hardly contain the crowd of courtiers.’’ The first 
one admitted is ‘‘l’entrée familiére,’’ consisting 
of the children of France, the prince and prin- 
eesses of the blood, and besides these, the chief 
physician, the chief surgeon, and other service- 
able persons. Next comes the ‘‘grande entrée,’’ 
which comprizes the grand chamberlain, the grand 
master and master of the wardrobe, the first 
gentlemen of the bedchamber, the dukes of Or- 
leans and. Penthiévre, some other highly favored 
seigniors, the ladies of honor and in waiting of 
the queen, mesdames, and other princesses, with- 
out enumerating barbers, tailors, and various de- 
scriptions of valets. Meanwhile spirits of wine 
are poured on the king’s hands from a service 
of plate, and he is then handed the basin of holy- 
water; he erosses himself and repeats a prayer. 
Then he gets out of bed before all these people,

  and puts on his slippers. The grand chamber- 
Jain and the first gentleman hand him his dress- 
ing-gown; he puts this on and seats himself in 
the chair in which he is to put on his clothes. 
At this moment the door opens, and a third group 
enters, which is the ‘‘entrée des brevets’’—the 
seigniors who compose this enjoy in addition the 
precious privilege of assisting at the ‘‘petit cou- 
cher’’; while at the same moment there enters 
a detachment of attendants, consisting of the 
physicians and surgeons in ordinary, the intend- 
ants of the amusements, readers, and others, 
and among the latter those who preside over phys- 
ieal requirements. The publicity of a royal life 
is so great that none of its functions can be 
exercised without witnesses. 
At the moment of the approach of the officers 
of the wardrobe to dress the king, the first gentle- 
man, notified by an usher, advances to read him 
the names of the grandees who are waiting at 
the door: this is the fourth entry, called ‘‘la 
chambre,’’ and larger than those preeeding it; 
for, not to mention the cloak-bearers, gun-bearers, 
rug-bearers, and other valets, it comprizes most 
of the superior officials, the grand almoner, the 
almoners on duty, the chaplain, the master of 
the oratory, the captain and major of the body- 
guard, the colonel-general and major of the 
French guards, the colonel of the king’s regiment, 
the captain of the Cent Suisses, the grand hunts- 
man, the grand wolf-huntsman, the grand provost, 
the grand master and master of ceremonies, the 
first butler, the grand master of the pantry, the 
foreign ambassadors, the ministers and seeretaries 
of state, the marshals of France, and most of 
44
-P-A-G-E-57
  HIPPOLITE ADOLPHE TAINE 
the seigniors and prelates of distinction. Ushers 
place the ranks in order, and if necessary, impose 
silence. 
Meanwhile the king washes his hands and be- 
gins his toilet. Two pages remove his slippers; 
the grand master of the wardrobe draws oif his 
night-shirt by the right arm, and the urst valet 
of the wardrobe by the left arm, and both of 
them hand it to an officer of the wardrobe, while 
a valet of the wardrobe fetches the shirt, wrapt 
up in white taffeta. Things have now reached 
the solemn point, the culmination of the cere- 
mony: the fifth entry has been introduced; and 
in a few moments, after the king has put his shirt 
on, all that is left of those who are known, with 
other household officers waiting in the gallery, 
complete the influx. 
There is quite a formality in regard to this 
shirt. The honor of handing it is reserved to 
the sons and grandsons of France; in default 
-of these, to the princes of the blood or those 
legitimated ; in their default, to the grand cham- 
berlain or to the first gentleman of the bedcham- 
ber; the’ latter case, it must be observed, being 
very rare, the princes being obliged to be present 
at the king’s lever as well as the princesses at 
that of the queen. At last the shirt is presented, 
and a valet carries off the old one; the first valet 
of the wardrobe and the first valet de chambre 
hold the fresh one, each by a right and left arm 
respectively; while two other valets, during this 
operation, extend his dressing-gown in front of 
him to serve.as a sereen. The shirt is now on 
his back, and the toilet commences. 
A valet de chambre supports a mirror before

  the king, while two others on the two sides light 
it up, if occasion requires with flambeaux. Valets 
of the wardrobe fetch the rest of the attire; the 
grand master of the wardrobe puts the vest on 
and the doublet, attaches the blue ribbon, and 
clasps his sword around him; then a valet as- 
signed to the cravats brings several of these in 
a basket, while the master of the wardrobe ar- 
ranges around the king’s neck that which the 
king selects. After this a valet assigned to the 
handkerchiefs brings three of these on a silver 
salver; while the grand master of the wardrobe 
offers the salver to the king, who chooses one. 
Finally the master of the wardrobe hands to the 
king his hat, his gloves, and his eane. The king 
then steps to the side of the bed, kneels on a 
cushion, and says his prayers; while an almoner 
in a low voice recites the orison Quesumus, deus 
omnipotens. This done, the king announces the 
order of the day, and passes with the leading 
persons of his court into his cabinet, where he 
sometimes gives audience. Meanwhile the rest 
of the company await him in the gallery, in order 
to accompany him to mass when he comes out. 
Such is the lever, a piece in five acts. Nothing 
eould be contrived better calculated to fill up 
the void of an aristocratic life: a hundred or 
thereabouts of notable seigniors dispose of a 
couple of hours in coming, in waiting, in entering, 
in defiling, in taking positions, in standing on 
their feet, in maintaining an air of respect and 
of ease suitable to a superior class of walking 
gentlemen, while those best qualified are about 
to do the same thing over in the queen’s apart- 
ment. The king, however, to offset this, suffers

  the same torture and the same inaction as he 
imposes. He also is playing a part: all his steps 
and all his gestures have been determined before- 
hand; he has been obliged to arrange. his physi- 
ognomy and his voice, never to depart from an 
affable and dignified air, to award judiciously 
his glances and his nods, to keep silent or to 
speak only of the chase, and to suppress his own 
thoughts if he has any. One ean not indulge 
in reverie, meditate, or be absent-minded when 
before the footlights: the part must have due

Tuy had no more than sat down at table when 
Delaherche, burning to relieve himself of the sub- 
ject that filled his mind, began to relate his ex- 
periences of the day before. 
‘You know I saw the Emperor at Baybel.’’ 
He was fairly started, and nothing could stop 
him. He began by describing the farmhouse; 
a large structure with an interior court, sur- 
rounded by an iron railing, and situated on a 
gentle eminence overlooking Mouzon, to the left 
of the Carignan road. Then he came back to 
the Twelfth Corps, whom he had visited in their 
eamp among the vines on the hillsides; splendid 
troops they were, with their equipments brightly 
shining in the sunlight, and the sight of them 
had caused his heart to beat with patriotie ardor. 
‘And there I was, sir, when the Emperor, who 
had alighted to breakfast and rest himself a bit,

  came out of the farmhouse. He wore a general’s 
uniform and carried an overcoat across his arm, 
altho the sun was very hot. He was followed 
by a servant bearing a camp-stool. He did not 
look to me like a well man; ah no, far from it: 
his stooping form, the sallowness of his com- 
plexion, the feebleness of his movements, all in- 
dicated him to be in a very bad way. I was not 
surprized; for the druggist at Mouzon, when he 
recommended me to drive on to Baybel, told me 
that an aide-de-camp had just been in his shop 
to get some medicine—you understand what I 
mean—medicine for—’’ 
The presence of his wife and mother prevented 
him from alluding more explicitly to the nature of 
the Emperor’s complaint, which was an obstinate 
diarrhea that he had contracted at Chéne, and which 
compelled him to make those frequent halts at 
houses along the road. ’ 
‘*Well, then the attendant opened the camp- 
stool and -placed it in the shade of a clump of 
trees at the edge of a field of wheat, and the 
Emperor sat down on it. Sitting there in a limp, 
dejected attitude, perfectly still, he looked for 
all the world like a small shopkeeper taking a 
sun-bath for his rheumatism. His dull eyes wan- 
dered over the wide horizon, the Meuse coursing 
through the valley at his feet, before him the 
range of wooded heights whose summits recede 
and are lost in the distance, on the left the 
waving tree-tops of Dieulet forest, on the right

reached the point where the dramatic interest of 
his story culminated, and it became necessary to 
reenforee words by gestures. 
‘CAll at once there was a succession of sharp

It produced on me no more effect than a display 
of fireworks in broad daylight, sir, upon my word 
it didn’t! The people about the Emperor, of 
course, showed a good deal of agitation and un- 
easiness. The colonel of dragoons comes running 
up again to ask if I can give them an idea whence 
the fire proceeds. I answer him offhand: ‘It is 
at Beaumont; there is not the slightest doubt 
about it.’ He returns to the Emperor, on whose 
knees an aide-de-eamp was unfolding a map. The 
Emperor was evidently of opinion that the fight- 
ing was not at Beaumont, for he sent the colonel 
baek to me a third time. But I couldn’t well 
do otherwise than stick to what I had said before, 
could I, now?—the more that the shells kept 
flying through the air, nearer and nearer, fol- 
lowing the line of the Mouzon road. And then, 
sir, as sure as I see you standing there, I saw 
the Emperor turn his pale face toward me. Yes, 
sir, he looked at me a moment with those dim 
eyes of his, that were filled with an expression of 
melancholy and distrust. And then his face de- 
clined upon his map again, and he made no fur- 
ther movement.’’ . .

  our early defeats that the government was re- 
sponsible for some mistakes; but he stood up for 
the dynasty, eompassionating and excusing Napo- 
leon III, deceived and betrayed as he was by 
every one. It was his firm opinion that the men 
at whose door should be laid the responsibility 
for all our disasters were none other than those 
Republican deputies of the opposition who had 
stood in the way of voting the necessary men 
and money. 
‘fAnd did the Emperor return to the farm- 
house?’’ asked Captain Beaudoin. 
“‘That’s more than I can say, my dear sir: 
I left him.sitting on his stool. It was midday, 
the battle was drawing nearer, and it oeeurred 
to me that it was time to be thinking of my own 
return. All that I can tell you besides is that 
a general to whom I pointed out the position of 
Carignan in the distance, in the plain to our 
rear, appeared greatly surprized to learn that 
the Belgian frontier lay in that direction, and 
was only a few miles away. Ah, that the poor 
Emperor should have to rely on such serv- 
ants!’? . 
While ‘Delaherche- was raising himself on tip- 
toe, and trying to peer through the windows of 
the rez-de-chaussée, an old woman at his side, 
some poor day-worker of the neighborhood, with 
shapeless form, and hands calloused and distorted 
by many years of toil, was mumbling between 
her teeth: 
*¢An emperor—I should like to see one once— 
just onee—so I could say I had seen him,’’ 
Suddenly Delaherche exclaimed, seizing Mau- 
rice by. the arm: 
51
-P-A-G-E-64

  ‘“See, there he is! at the window to the left. 
I had a good view of him yesterday; I can’t be 
mistaken. There, he has just raised the curtain; 
see, that pale face, close to the glass.’’ 
The old woman had overheard him, and stood 
staring with wide-open mouth and eyes; for there, 
full in the window, was an apparition that re- 
sembled a corpse more than a living being: its 
eyes were lifeless, its features distorted; even 
the mustache had assumed a ghastly whiteness 
in the final agony. The old woman was dum- 
founded; forthwith she turned her back and 
marched off with a look of supreme contempt. 
“That thing an emperor! a likely story!’’ 
A zouave was standing near—one of those fu- 
gitive soldiers who were in no haste to rejoin 
their commands. Brandishing his chassepot and 
expectorating threats and maledictions, he said 
to his companion: 
‘Wait! see me put a bullet in his head!’’ 
Delaherche remonstrated angrily; but by that 
time the Emperor had disappeared. The hoarse 
mourmur of the Meuse continued uninterruptedly ; 
a wailing lament, inexpressibly mournful, seemed 
to pass above them through the air, where the 
darkness was gathering intensity. Other sounds 
rose. in the distance, like the hollow muttering 
of the rising storm: were they the ‘‘March! 
march!’’—that terrible order from Paris which 
had driven that ill-starred man onward day by 
day, dragging behind him along the roads of his 
defeat the irony of his imperial! escort, until now 
_ he was brought face to face with the ruin he had 
foreseen and come forth to meet? What multi- 
tudes of brave men were to lay down their lives 
52

  for his mistakes; and how complete the wreck, in 
all his being, of that sick man—that sentimental 
dreamer, awaiting in sloomy silence the fulfilment 
of his destiny! . . 
‘¢O M. Delaherche! i isn ’%t this dreadful! Here, 
quick! this way, if you would like to see the 
Emperor.’ 
On the lett of the corridor a door stood ajar; 
and through the narrow opening a glimpse could 
be had of the sovereign, wlio had resumed his 
weary, anguished tramp between the fireplace and 
the window. Back and forth he shuffled with 
heavy, dragging steps, and ceased not, despite 
his unendurable suffering. An aide-de-eamp had 
just entered the room—it was he who had failed 
to close the door behind him—and Delaherche 
heard the Emperor ask him in a sorrowfully re- 
proachful voice: 
‘‘What is the reason of this continued firing, 
sir, after I gave orders to hoist the white flag?’’ 
The torture to him had become greater than 
he could bear—this never-ceasing cannonade that 
seemed to grow more furious with every minute. 
Every time he approached the window it pierced 
him to the heart. More spilling of blood, more 
useless squandering of human fe! At every 
moment the piles of corpses were rising higher 
on the battle-field, and his was the responsibility. 
The compassionate instincts that entered so 
largely into his nature revolted at it, and more 
than ten times already he had asked that question 
of those who approached him. 
“*T gave orders to raise the white flag: tell me, 
why do they continue firing?’’ 
The aide-de-camp made answer in a voice so 
53
-P-A-G-E-66
TY

  low that Delaherche failed to catch its purport. 
The Emperor, moreover, seemed not to pause to 
listen, drawn by some irresistible attraction to 
that window; at which, each time he approached 
it, he was greeted by that terrible salvo of artil- 
lery that rent and tore his being. His pallor was 
greater even than it had been before; his poor, 
pinched, wan face, on which were.still visible 
traces of the rouge which had been applied that 
morning, bore witness to his anguish. 
At that moment a short, quick-motioned man 
in dust-soiled uniform, whom Delaherche recog- 
nized as General Lebrun, hurriedly crossed the 
corridor and pushed open the door, without wait- 
ing to be announced. And scarcely was he in 
the room-when again was heard the Emperor’s 
80 oft-repeated question. 
‘Why do they continue to fire, General, when 
I have given orders to hoist the white flag?’’ 
The aide-de-camp left the apartment, shutting 
the door behind him, and Delaherche never knew 
what was the General’s answer. The vision had 
faded from his sight.

A GREAT MAN’S WIDOW? 
No one was astonished at hearing she was going 
to marry again. Notwithstanding all his genius, 
perhaps even on account of his genius, the great 
man had for fifteen years led her a hard life, full 
of eaprices and mad freaks that had attracted 
the attention of all Paris. On the highroad to 
fame, over which he had so triumphantly and 
hurriedly traveled, like those who are to die 
young, she had sat behind him, humbly and tim- 
idly, in a eorner of the chariot, ever fearful of 
collisions. Whenever she complained, relatives, 
friends, every one was against her: ‘‘Respect 
his weaknesses,’’ they would say to her, ‘‘they 
are the weaknesses of a god. Do not disturb 
him, do not worry him. Remember that your 
husband does not belong exclusively to you. He 
belongs much more to art, to his country, than 
to his family. And who knows if each of the 
faults you reproach him with has not given us

  some sublime creation?’’ At last, however, her 
patience was worn out, she rebelled, became in- 
dignant and even unjust, so much, indeed, that 
at the moment of the great man’s death, they 
were on the point of demanding a judicial separa- 
tion and ready to see their great and celebrated 
name dragged into the columns of a society paper. 
After the agitation of this unhappy mateh, the 
anxieties of the last illness, and the sudden death 
which for a moment revived her former affection, 
the first months of her widowhood acted on the 
young woman like a healthy calming water-eure. 
The enforced retirement, the quiet charm of mit- 
igated sorrow lent to her thirty-five years a 
second youth almost as attractive as the first. 
Moreover, black suited her, and then she had 
the responsible and rather proud look of a woman 
left alone in life, with all the weight of a great 
name to earry honorably. Mindful of the fame 
of the departed one, that wretched fame that had 
cost her so many tears, and now grew day by 
day, like a magnificent flower nourished by the 
black earth ef the tomb, she was to be seen 
draped in her long somber veils holding inter- 
views with theatrical managers and publishers, 
busying herself in getting her husband’s operas 
put again on the stage, superintending the print- 
ing of his posthumous works and unfinished man- 
useripts, bestowing on all these details a kind of 
solemn care and, as it were, the respect for a 
shrine. 
It was at this moment that her second husband 
met her. He, too, was a musician, ahmost un- 
known, it is true, the author of a few waltzes 
and songs, and of two little operas, of which 
56

  the scores, charmingly printed, were scarcely 
more played than sold. With a pleasant eoun- 
tenance, a handsome fortune that he owed to his 
exceedingly bourgeois family, he had above all 
an infinite respect for genius, a curiosity about 
famous men, and the ingenuous enthusiasm of 
a still youthful artist. Thus when he met the 
wife of the great man, he was dazzled and be- 
wildered. It was as tho the image of the glorious 
muse herself had appeared to him. He at once 
fell in love, and as the widow was beginning to 
receive a few friends, he had himself presented 
to her. There his passion grew in the atmosphere 
of genius that still lingered in all the corners of 
the drawing-room. There was the bust of the 
master, the piano he composed on, his scores 
spread over all the furniture, melodious even to 
look at, as tho from between their half-opened 
pages the written phrases reechoed musically. 
The actual and very real charm of the widow, 
surrounded by those austere memories as by a 
frame that became her, brought his love to a 
climax. 
After hesitating a long time, the poor fellow 
at last proposed, but in such humble and timid 
terms: ‘‘He knew how unworthy he was of her. 
He understood all the regret she would feel in 
exchanging her illustrious name for his, so un- 
known and insignificant.’’? And a thousand other 
artless phrases in the same style. In reality, 
the lady was indeed very much flattered by her 
conquest; however, she played the comedy of a 
broken heart, and assumed the disdainful, wearied 
airs of a woman whose life is ended without 
hopes of renewal. She, who had never in her

  life been so quiet and comfortable as since the 
death of her great man, actually found tears 
with which to mourn for him, and an enthusiastie 
ardor in speaking of him. ‘This, of course, only 
inflamed her youthful adorer the more and made 
him more eloquent and persuasive. . - 
In short, this severe widowhood ended in.a mar- 
riage; but the widow did not abdieate, and re- 
mained — altho married —more than ever the 
widow of a great man; well knowing that herein 
lay, in the eyes of her second husband, her real 
prestige. As she felt herself much older than 
he, to prevent his perceiving it, she overwhelmed 
him with her disdain, with a kind of vague pity, 
and unexprest and offensive regret at her con- 
descending marriage. However, he was not 
wounded by it, quite the contrary. He was so 
convinced of his inferiority and thought it so 
natural that the memory of such a man should 
_ reign despotically in her heart! In order the 
better to maintain in him this humble attitude, 
she would at times read over with him the letters 
the great man had written to her when he was 
courting her. This return toward the past re- 
juvenated her some fifteen years, lent her the 
assurance of a handsome and beloved woman, 
seen through all the wild love and delightful” 
exaggeration of written passion. That she since 
then had changed her young husband cared little, 
loving her on the faith of another, and drawing 
therefrom I know not what strange kind of 
vanity. It seemed to him that these passionate 
appeals added to his own, and that he inherited 
a whole past of love. 
A strange couple indeed! It was in society,

however, that they presented the most curious 
spectacle. I sometimes eaught sight of them 
at the theater. No one would have recognized 
the timid and shy young woman, who formerly 
accompanied the maestro, lost in the gigantie 
shadow he cast around him. Now, seated upright 
in the front of the box, she displayed herself, 
attracting all eyes by the pride of her own glance. 
It might be said that her head was surrounded 
by her first husband’s halo of glory, his name 
reechoing around her like a homage or a re- 
proach. The other one, seated a little behind 
her, with the subservient physiognomy of one 
ready for every abnegation in life, watched each 
of her movements, ready to attend to her slightest 
wis! : 
At home the peculiarity of their attitude was 
still more noticeable. I remember a certain eve- 
ning party they gave a year after their marriage. 
The husband moved about among the crowd of 
guests, proud but rather embarrassed at gather- 
ing together so many in his own house. The 
wife, disdainful, melancholy, and very superior, 
was on that evening more than ever the widow 
of a great man! She had a peculiar way of 
glancing at her husband from over her shoulder, 
of calling him ‘‘my poor dear friend,’’ of casting 
on him all the wearisome drudgery of the recep- 
tion, with an air of saying: ‘‘You are only fit for 
that.”?” Around her gathered a circle of former 
friends, those who had been spectators of the 
brilliant débuts of the great man, of his strug- 
gles, and his suecess. She simpered to them; 
played the young girl! They had known her 
when.so young! Nearly all of them called her

  by her Christian name, ‘‘Anais.’? They formed 
a kind of cenaculum, which the poor husband 
respectfully approached, to hear his predecessor 
spoken of. They recalled the glorious first nights, 
those evenings on which nearly every battle was 
won, and the great man’s manias, his way of 
working; how, in order to summon up inspira- 
tion, he insisted on his wife being by his side, 
decked out in full ball dress. ‘‘Do you remem- 
ber, Anais??? And Anais sighed and blushed. 
It was at that time that he had written his 
most tender pieces, above all ‘‘Savonarole,’’ the 
most passionate of his creations, with a grand 
duet, interwoven with rays of moonshine, the 
perfume of foses and the warbling of nightin- 
gales, An enthusiast sat down and played it on 
the piano, amid a silence of attentive emotion. 
At the last note of the magnificent piece, the 
lady burst into tears. ‘‘I can not help it,’’ she 
said, ‘‘I have never been able to hear it without 
weeping.’’ The great man’s old friends sur- 
rounded his unhappy widow with sympathetic 
expressions, coming up to her one by one, as 
at a funereal ceremony, to give a thrilling clasp 
to her hand. 
*‘Come, come, Anais, be courageous.’? And 
the drollest thing was to see the second husband, 
standing by the side of his wife, deeply touched 
and affected, shaking hands all round, and ac- 
eepting, he too, his share of sympathy. ‘‘What 
genius! what genius!’’ he repeated as he mopped 
his eyes. It was at the same time ridiculous and 
affecting. .

MY FIRST DRESS COAT?*® 
How did I come by it, that first dress coat? 
What primitive tailor, what confiding tradesman 
was it, trustful as Don Juan’s famous Monsieur 
Dimanche, who upon the faith of my fantastic 
promises, decided one fine morning on bringing 
it to me, brand new, and artistically pinned up 
in a square of shiny green calico? It would be 
dificult for me to tell. Of the honest tailor, I 
ean indeed recall nothing—so many tailors have 
since then crossed my path—save perhaps a 
vision, as in a luminous mist, of a thoughtful 
brow and a large mustache. The coat indeed is 
there, before my eyes. Its image after twenty 
years still remains indelibly graven on my mem- 
ory, as on imperishable brass. What a collar, my 
young friends! What lapels! And, above all, 
what skirts, shaped as the slimmest tail of the 
swallow! My brother, a man of experience, had 
said: ‘‘One must have a dress coat if one wishes 
to make one’s way in the world.’’ And the dear 
fellow counted much upon this piece of frippery 
for the advancement of my fame and for- 
fume, . .

  one else, that amiable institution of Providence, 
who, of no personal value in himself and a mere 
acquaintance in the house he frequents, yet goes 
everywhere, introduces you everywhere, is the 
friend of a day, of an hour, of whose name even 
you are ignorant, that essentially Parisian type. 
You may: imagine with what enthusiasm TI ac- 
cepted the proposal. To be invited to Augustine’s 
house! Augustine, the famous actress, Augus- 
tine, the laughing representative of Moliére’s 
comic. muse, softened somewhat by the more 
modern poetic smile of Musset’s genius — for 
while she acted the waiting maids at the Théatre 
Francais, Musset had written his comedy ‘‘Loui- 
son’’ at her house; Augustine Brohan, in short, 
in whom all Paris delighted, vaunting her wit, 
quoting her repartees; and who might already 
be said to have adorned herself with that swal- 
low’s plume, unsullied yet by ink, but already 
well sharpened, with which she was hereafter to 
sign those charming ‘‘Lettres de Suzanne!’’ 
‘“‘Lueky dog!’’ said my brother, helping me 
on with the coat; ‘‘your fortune is made.’? = - 
Nine o’elock was striking as I sallied forth. 
At that time Augustine Brohan was living in 
the Rue Lord Byron, at the top of the Champs 
Llysées, in one of those pretty coquettish little 
houses which seem to ignorant provircials the 
realization of the poetical dreams which they 
weave for themselves from the pages of the 
novelist. A railing, a tiny garden, four steps 
covered by an awning, an entrance hall filled with 
flowers, and then, opening immediately from it, 
the drawing-room, a brilliantly lighted room in 
green, which I ean see now vividly before me.

ALPHONSE DAUDET 
  How I managed to get up those steps, how I 
made my entry, and how I presented myself, I 
can not now remember. A footman announced my 
name, but this name, which he mumbled, produced 
no effect on the brilliant assembly. I can only recol- 
lect hearing a woman’s voice say: ‘‘So much the 
better, here is another dancer.’’ It appears they 
were short of dancers; but what an entry for 
a poet! 
Startled and humiliated, I tried to lose myself 
among the crowd. How can I describe my dis- 
may, when, a moment later, another mistake 
arose? My long hair, my dark and somber Jooks 
excited general curiosity. I heard them whis- 
pering near me: ‘‘Who is it? Do look,’’ and 
they langhed. At last some one said: 
“Tt is the Wallachian Prince!’’ 
“The Wallachian Prince? Oh yes, very like- ly.?? 
I suppose that a Wallachian prince had been 
expected that evening. My rank being thus set- 
tled for me, I was left in peace. But for all 
that, you can not imagine how heavily my usurped 
erown weighed upon me all that evening. First 
a daricing man! then a Wallachian prince! Could 
not these good people see my lyre? 
Fortunately for me, a startling piece of news 
flying from mouth to mouth, spread rapidly 
through the ballroem, casting into oblivion both 
the dancer and the Wallachian prince. Marriage 
was at that time much the fashion among the 
feminine portion of the Comédie company, and 
it was generally at Augustine Brohan’s Wednes- 
day receptions, where all the choicest talents of 
journalism, together with bankers and high gov-

  ernment officials gathered round the levely mem- 
bers. or associates of the Frangais, that the 
foundations were laid of most of these romantie 
unions. . . 
At last comparative ealm was restored and 
the quadrilles began. I danced. I was obliged 
té do so. I danced moreover somewhat badly for 
a Wallachian prince. The quadrille once ended, 
I became stationary; foolishly held back by my 
short sight—too shy to sport an eyeglass, too 
much of a poet to wear spectacles, and dreading 
lest, at the slightest movement, I should bruise 
my knee against the corner of some piece of 
furniture, or plunge my nose into the trimming 
of a bodice. Soon hunger and thirst interfered 
in the matter; but for a kingdom I should never 
have dared to approach the buffet with all the 
rest of the world. I anxiously watched for the 
moment when it should be deserted; and while 
waiting, I joined the groups of politieal talkers, 
assuming a serious air, and feigning to seorn 
the charms of the smaller salon, whence came 
to me,, with the pleasant sound of laughter and 
the tinkling of teaspoons against the porcelain, 
a delicate aroma of scented tea, of Spanish wines 
and cakes. At last they came back to danee, 
and I gathered up my courage. I entered, I 
was alone. 
What a dazzling sight was that buffet. A 
erystal pyramid under the blaze of the candles, 
brilliant with glasses and decanters, white and 
glittering as snow in the sunshine. I took up a 
glass as fragile as a flower, careful not to hold 
it too tightly lest I should break the stem. What 
should I pour into it? Come now, courage, T

  say to myself, since no one can see me. T 
stretched out my hand, and took at haphazard 
a decanter. It must be kirsch, I thought, from 
its diamond clearness. Well, I’ll try a glass of 
kirseh; I like its perfume, its bitter and wild 
perfume that reminds me of the forest. And so, 
like an epicure, I slowly poured out, drop by 
drop, the beautiful clear liquid. I raised. the 
glass to my lips. Oh, horror, it was only water. 
What a grimace I made. Suddenly a duet of 
laughter resounded from a black coat and a pink 
dress that I had not perceived flirting in the 
corner, and who were amused at my mistake. 
I endeavored to replace my glass, but I was 
nervous, my hand shook, and my sleeve caught 
I know not what. One glass, two glasses, three 
glasses fell. I turned round, my wretched coat 
tails swept a wild circle, and the white pyramid 
erashed to the ground, with all the sparkling, 
splintering, flashing uproar of an iceberg break- 
ing to pieces. 
At the noise of the catastrophe the mistress 
of the house rushed up. Luckily, she is as short- 
sighted as the Wallachian prince, and he is able 
to escape from the buffet without being recog- 
nized. All the same, my evening is spoiled. The 
massacre of small glasses and decanters weighs 
on my mind like a crime.. My one idea is to get 
away. But the Dubois mama, dazzled by my 
principality, catches hold of me and will not 
allow me to leave till I have danced with her 
daughter, or indeed with both her daughters. I 
excuse myself as best as I can; when a tall old 
man with a shrewd smile, stopt my egress. It 
is Doctor Ricord, with whom I had exchanged

  a few words previously and who, like the others, 
takes me for the Wallachian. ‘But, Prince, as 
you are inhabiting the Hotel du Senat, and as 
we are near neighbors, pray wait for me, I can 
offer you a seat in my earriage.’’ How willingly 
would I accept, but I have no overcoat~ What 
would Ricord think of a Wallachian prince with- 
out furs, and shivering in his dress coat? Let 
me escape quickly, and hurry home on foot, 
through the snow and fog, sooner than allow 
my poverty to be seen. Always half-blind and 
more confused than ever, I reach the door and 
slip out, not, however, without getting somehow 
entangled in the tapestries. ‘‘Won’t monsieur 
take his coat?’’ a footman calls after me. 
There I was, at two o’clock in. the morning, 
far from my home, alone in the streets, hungry 
and frozen, with the devil’s own self, a badly 
lined purse in my pocket. But hunger inspired 
me with a brilliant idea: ‘‘Suppose I go to the 
markets.’? I had often heard of the markets, 
and a certain Gaidras, whose establishment re- 
mained open all night, and where for the sum 
of three sous they provided a plateful of sue- 
eulent cabbage soup. By Jove, yes, to the mar- 
kets I would go. I would sit down at those tables 
like the veriest prowling vagabond. All my pride 
had vanished. The wind is icy cold; hunger 
makes me desperate. ‘‘My kingdom for a horse,’’ 
said another prince, and I say to myself as I 
tret along: ‘‘My principality, my Wallachian- 
principality, for a basin of good soup in a warm 
corner.’? 
Gaidras’ establishment looks a mere filthy 
hovel, all slimy and badly lighted, thrust bacic

beneath the colonnades of the old market-place. 
Often and often since then, when noctambulism 
was the fashion, have we, future great men, spent 
whole nights there, elbows on table, amidst to- 
bacco smoke and literary talk. But at the first 
I must own, notwithstanding my hunger, I almost 
drew back at the sight of those blackened dingy 
walls, that dense smoke, those late sitters, snoring 
with their backs against the wall or lapping their 
soup like dogs; the amazing caps.of the Don 
Juans of the gutter, the enormous drab felt hats 
of the market porters, and the healthy rough 
blouse of the market gardener side by side with 
the greasy tatters of the prowler of the night. 
Nevertheless I entered, and I may at once add 
that my black coat found its fellows. Black coats 
that own no great coat are not rare in Paris after 
midnight in the winter, and they are hungry 
enough to eat three sous’ worth of cabbage soup. 
The cabbage soup was, however, exquisite; full 
of perfume as a garden, and smoking like a 
crater. I had two helpings, altho a custom pecul- 
jar to the establishment—inspired by wholesome 
distrust—of fastening the forks and spoons with 
a chain to the table, hindered me a little. I paid, 
and fortified by my substantial mess, resumed 
my way to the Quartier Latin. 
What a picture my return home! The return 
of the poet, trotting up the Rue de Tournon, with 
his coat collar turned up, while dancing before 
his sleepy eyes are the elegant shadows of a 
fashionable evening party mingling with the fam- 
ished speeters of the market-place. He stands 
knoeking his boots against the eurbstone of the 
Hotel du Senat, to shake off the snow, while

opposite the bright lamps of a brougham light 
the, front of an ‘old mansion, and Doetor 
Ricord’s coachman cries out: ‘‘Gate, if you 
please.’’ Life in Paris is made up of these 
contrasts. 
‘*A wasted evening,’’ said my brother the next 
morning. ‘‘You have been taken for a Wal- 
lachian prince, and have not succeeded in launeh- 
ing your book. But all is not yet lost; you must 
-make up for it when you make your ‘digestion 
eall,’ as we say in Paris.’’ 
The digestion of a glass of water, what irony. 
Tt was quite two months before I made up my 
mind to pay that call. However, one day I sum- 
moned up courage. Besides her official receptions 
on Wednesdays, Augustine Brohan received more 
uneeremoniously on Sunday afternoon. J reso- 
lutely started off. . 
Even now I can recall the smallest details of 
that interview. But see how all depends upon 
our point of view. I had told Sarcey the comical 
story of my first appearance in society, and one 
day Sareey repeated it to Augustine Brohan. 
Well, the ungrateful Augustine—whom, it is true, 
I have not seen for thirty years—swore most 
sincerely that she knew nothing of me but my 
books. She had forgotten everything! Every- 
thing—ail that had played such an important 
part in my life—the broken glasses, the Wal- 
lachian prince, the rehearsal of ‘‘Lait d’Anesse,’” 
and the boots of the heavy dragoons.

GUY DE MAUPASSANT 
Born in 1850, died in 1898; educated at Rouen; trained in 
Niterary matters by Flaubert; wrote an unsuccessful play in 
1879 and then a short story, “Boule de Suif,” which at- 
tracted marked attention, and was followed by a great num- 
ber of short and long stories, including ‘Mademoiselle Fifi” in 
1882, “Pierre et Jean” in 1888, and “Notre Cwur” in 1890. 
MADAME JEANNE’S LAST DAYS* 
Jeanne did not go out any more. She hardly 
bestirred herself. She got up every morning at 
the same time; looked out of the window at the 
weather, and then went down-stairs, and sat be- 
fore the fire in the hall. Here she would think 
of the happy years of Paul’s childhood, when he 
had worked in the salad-bed, kneeling side by 
side in the soft ground with Aunt Lison, the two 
women rivals in their effort to amuse the child, 
and seeing who could root up the young plants 
most skilfully. 
So musing, her lips would murmur, ‘‘Poulet, 
Poulet! my little Poulet’’—as if she were speaking 
to him; and, her reverie broken as she spoke, she 
would try during whole hours to write in the 
air the letters which formed the boy’s name. She 
would trace them slowly before the fire; ink 
that she really saw them; then helievin’ 
eyes had deceived her, she would rewrite the

  eapital P again, her arm trembling with fatigue, 
foreing herself to trace the name to the end; 
then when she had finished it she would begin 
over again. At last she could not write it any 
more. She would muddle everything—~fgrm other 
words, and exhaust herself almost to idiocy. 
Ever since her childhood just one habit had 
elung to her—that of jumping up out of bed the 
moment she had drunk her morning coffee. She 
was inordinately fond of that way of breakfast- 
ing, and the privation would have been felt more 
than anything else. Each morning she would 
await Rosalie’s arrival with extraordinary im- 
patience; and as soon as the cup was put upon 
the table at her side, she would sit up and empty 
it almost greedily, and then, throwing off her 
robe, she would begin to dress herself at once. 
She thought she was directly pursued by ob- 
stinate misfortune against which she became as 
fatalistie as an Oriental: the habit of seeing her 
dreams fade away and destroy her hopes made 
her afraid to undertake anything; and she waited 
whole days to accomplish the most simple affair, 
convinced that she would always take the wrong 
way to do it, and that it would turn. out badly. 
She repeated continually, ‘‘I have never had any 
Inck in my life.’’ Then Rosalie would ery, ‘‘Sup- 
Posing you had had to work for your bread—and 
were obliged to get up every morning at six 
o’elock and prepare for your day’s doings? 
There are lots of people who are obliged to do 
that; and when such people become too old, they 
die of poverty.’’ 
She had checked certain memorable days in 
her life, and now and then she was able to re- 
70
-P-A-G-E-83
  GUY DE MAUPASSANT 
  member episodes of an entire month, bringing 
them up one by one, grouping them together, and 
connecting together all those little matters which 
had preceded or followed some important event. 
She succeeded by sheer force of attention, by 
foree of memory and of concentrated will power 
in bringing back to mind almost eompletely her 
two first years at Peuples. Distant memories of 
her life came back to her with a singular facility, 
bringing a kind of relief; but the later years 
seemed to lose themselves in a mist—to become 
mixt one with another: and sometimes she would 
stay for an indefinite time, her head bowed on one 
of the calendars, her mind full of the past, and 
yet not being able to remember whether it was in 
this or that ealendar that such or such a remem- 
branee ought to be tabulated. She placed them 
around the room like the pictures of the Way of 
the Cross—those tableaux of days that were no 
more. Then she would abruptly set down her 
chair before one of them; and there she would 
sit until night came, staring at it, immobile, 
buried in her dreams of remembrance. 
One morning Rosalie came earlier than usual 
into her room, and said, setting down upon the 
table the bowl of coffee: ‘‘Come now, drink this 
up quickly. Denis is down-stairs waiting for us 
at the door. We are going over to Peuples to- 
day: I’ve got some business over there.’ 
Jeanne thought that she was going to faint, 
so deep was her emotion. She drest herself, 
frightened and tremulous at the mere idea of 
‘Seeing again that dear house. 
A radiant sky spread out above over all the 
world, and the horse, in fits and starts of liveli-

  ness, sometimes broke into a gallop.- When they 
entered into the commune of Etouvent, Jeanne’s 
heart beat so fast that she could hardly breathe, 
and when she saw from a distance the brick 
pillars of the boundary-line of her old home, she 
exclaimed in a low voice two or three times, ‘‘Oh! 
~~oh!—oh!—’’ as if something had happened to 
change her whole heart. 
They left the wagon with the Couillards: then, 
while Rosalie and her son went off to attend to 
their business, the caretakers offered to take 
Jeanne over the chateau, the present owners of 
it being away; so they gave her the keys. 
She set out alone, and when she was fairly 
before the old manor-house by the seaside, she 
stopt to look at it once again. It had changed 
in nothing outside. The large, grayish building 
that day showed upon its old walls the smile of 
the brilliant sunshine. All the shutters were closed. 
_A bit of a dead branch fell on her dress. She 
raised her eyes. It came from the plane-tree. 
She drew near the big tree with its smooth, pale 
bark; she stroked it with her hand as if it had 
been an animal. Her foot struck something in 
the grass—a fragment of rotten wood; it was 
the last fragment of the very bench on which she 
had sat so often with those of her own family about 
» her; the very bench which had been seen set in 
place on the very day that Julien had made his first 
visit. 
She reached the double doors of the vestibule 
of the house, and she had great trouble to open 
them; for the heavy, rusty key refused to turn 
in the lock. At length the lock yielded with a 
heavy grinding of its springs; and the door, a 
72

  little obstinate itself, burst open with a cloud of 
dust. 
At once, and- almost running, she went up- 
stairs to her own room. She could recognize it, 
hung as it: was with a light new paper: but 
throwing open a window, she looked out and 
stood motionless, stirred even to the depth of 
her being at the sight of all that landscape, so 
zauch beloved; the shrubs, the elm-trees, the flat 
reaches, and the sea dotted with brown sails, 
motionless in the distance. 
Then she began prowling about the great empty 
dwelling. She even stopt to look at the diseolora- 
tions on the walis; spots familiar to her eyes. 
Once she stood before a little hole crusht in the 
plaster by the baron; who had often amused him- 
self, when he was young, with making passages 
at arms, cane in hand, against the partition wall, 
when he happend to be passing this spot. 
She went down-stairs to the drawing-room. — It 
was somber behind the closed shutters: for some 
time she could not distinguish anything; then her 
eyes became accustomed to the darkness. Little 
by little she recognized the wide tapestries with 
their patterns of birds flitting about. Two set- 
tees were set before the chimney as if people had 
just quitted them; and the very odor of the room, 
an odor which it had always kept—that old, 
vague, sweet odor belonging to some old houses— 
entered Jeanne’s very being, enwrapt her in sou- 
venirs, intoxicated her memory. She remained 
gasping, breathing in that breath of the past, 
her eyes fixt mpon those two chairs; for suddenly 
she saw-—~as she had so often seen them—her 
father and her mother, sitting there warming 
13

  their feet by the fire. She started back terrified, 
struek her back against the edge of the door, 
caught at it to keep herself from falling, but 
kepi her eyes still fixt upon the chairs. 
The vision disappeared. For some moments 
she remained forgetful of everything; then slowly 
she recovered her self-possession, and would have 
fled from the room, fearful of losing her self- 
eontrol. Her glance fell by chance on the door- 
post on which she was leaning; and there before 
her eyes were the marks that had been made to 
keep track of Poulet’s height as he was grow- 
ing up! 
The little marks climbed the painted wood at 
irregular intervals; figures traced with the pen- 
knife noted down the different ages with the 
month of the boy’s life. Sometimes the jottings 
were in the handwriting of the baron, a large 
hand; sometimes they were inher own smaller 
hand? sometimes in that of Aunt Lison, a little 
shaky. It seemed to her that the child of other 
days was actually there, before her, with his blond 
hair, pressing his little forehead against the wall 
so that his height could be measured. The baron 
was crying, ‘‘Jeanne! he has grown a whole 
centimeter in the last six weeks!’’ She began 
to kiss the piece of wood in a frenzy of love. 
But some one was calling her from outside. 
It was Rosalie’s voice: ‘‘Madame Jeanne, Ma- 
dame Jeanne, we are waiting for you, to have 
luncheon.’’ She went out in a trance. She 
hardly understood anything that the other said 
to her. She ate the things that they put on her 
plate; she listened without knowing what she 
heard, talking mechanically with the farming-

  women, who inquired about her health; she let 
them embrace her, and herself kissed the cheeks 
efered to her; and then got into the wagon again. 
When she caught her last glimpse of the high 
roof of the chateau across the trees, she felt a 
terrible sinking in her heart. It seemed to her 
ia her innermost being that she had said farewell 
ferever to her old home!

SOME OF HIS TABLE TALK AND 
SAYINGS* 
‘‘Berorn I translated the New Testament out of the Greek all longed after it; when it was 
done, their longing lasted scarce four weeks. 
Then they desired the books of Moses; when I 
had translated these, they had enough thereof 
in a short time. After that, they would have 
the Psalms; of these they were soon weary, and 
desired other books. So will it be with the Book 
of Ecclesiasticus, which they now long for, and 
about which I have taken great pains. All is

after it appeared in German. A notable later version was 
made by William Hazlitt. 79

  acceptable until our giddy brains be satisfied; 
afterward we let things lie, and seek after new.’’ 
Dr. Luther diseust at length eoncerning witch- 
eraft and charms. He said that his mother had 
had to undergo infinite annoyance from one of 
her neighbors, who was a witch and whom she 
was fain to conciliate with all sorts of attention, 
for this witch could throw a charm upon children 
which made them ery themselves to death. A 
pastor having punished her for some knavery, 
she cast a spel! upon him by means of some 
earth upon which he had walked, and which she 
bewitched. The poor man hereupon fell sick of 
a malady which no remedy could remove, and 
shortly after died. 
Dr. Luther said he had heard from the Elector 
of Saxony, John Frederic, that a powerful famiky 
in Germany was descended from the devil—the 
founder having been born of a succubus. He 
added this story: ‘‘A gentleman had a young 
and beautiful wife, who, dying, was buried. 
Shortly afterward, this gentleman and one of 
his servants sleeping in the same chamber, the 
wife who was dead came at night, bent over the 
bed of the gentleman as tho she were conversing 
with him, and after a while went away again. 
The servant, having twice observed this cireum- 
stance, asked his master whether he knew that 
every night a woman clothed in white stood by 
his bedside. The master replied that he had slept 
soundly, and had observed nothing of the sort. 
The next night he took care to remain awake. 
The woman came, and he asked her who she was 
and what she wanted. She answered that she 
was his wife. He returned, ‘My wife is dead 
80
-P-A-G-E-93

  and buried.’ She answered, she had died by 
reason of his sins; but that if he would receive 
her again, she would return to him in life. He 
said if it were possible, he should be well content. 
She told him he must undertake not to swear, as 
he was wont to do; for that if he ever did so, 
she should once more die, and permanently quit 
him. He promised this; and the dead woman, 
returning to seeming life, dwelt with him, ate, 
drank, and slept with him, and had children by 
him. One day that he had guests, his wife went 
to fetch some cakes from an adjoining apartment, 
and remained a long time absent. The gentleman 
grew impatient, and broke out into his old oaths. 
The wife not returning, the gentleman with his 
friends went to seek her, but she had disap- 
peared; only the clothes she had worn lay on 
the floor. She was never again seen.’’ 
‘‘Between husband and wife there should be no 
question as to meum and tuum. All things should 
be in-ecommon between them, without any dis- 
tinetion or means of distinguishing.’’ 
“St. Augustine said finely: ‘A marriage with- 
out children is the world without the sun.’ ’’ 
Dr. Luther said one day to his wife: ‘‘You 
make me do what you will; you have full sov- 
ereignty here, and I award you with all my heart 
the command in all household matters, reserving 
my rights in other points. Never any good came 
out of female domination. God created Adam 
master and lord of living creatures; but Eve 
spoilt all, when she persuaded him to set himself 
above God’s will. “Tis you women, with your 
tricks and artifices, that lead men into error.’’ 
‘eoTis a grand thing for a married pair to live

in perfect union, but the devil rarely permits 
this. When they are apart, they can not endure 
the separation; and when they are together, they 
can not endure the always seeing one another. 
"Tis as the poet says: ‘Nec tecum vivere possum, 
nec sine te,’ Married people must assiduously pray 
against these assaults of the devil. I have seen 
marriage where, at first, husband and wife 
_ seemed as tho they would eat one another up; 
in six months they have separated in mutual 
disgust. ’Tis the devil inspires this evanescent 
ardor, in order to divert the parties from 
prayer.’’ 
Dr. Luther said, in reference to those who 
write satirical attacks upon women, that such 
will not go unpunished. ‘‘If the author be one 
of high rank, rest assured he is not really of 
noble origin, but a-surreptitious intruder into the 
family. What defects women have, we must check 
them for in private, gently by word of mouth; 
for woman is a frail vessel.’? The doctor then 
turned round and said, ‘‘Let us talk of something 
else.’” 
There was at Frankfort-on-the-Oder 2 school- 
master, a pious and learned man, whose heart was 
fervently inelined to theology, and who had 
preached several times with great applause. He 
was called to the dignity of deacon; but his wife, 
a violent, fierce woman, would not consent to 
his accepting the charge, saying she would not 
be the wife of a minister. 
It became a question, what was the poor man 
to do? which was he to renounce, his preacher- 
ship or his wife? Luther at first said jocosely, 
‘*Oh, if he has married, as you tell me, a widow, 
82
-P-A-G-E-95
——— ee 
MARTIN LUTHER nr eR 
he must needs obey her.’’ But after a while 
he resumed severely: othe wife is bound to fol- 
Jow her husband, not the husband his wife. This 
must be an ill woman, nay, the devil incarnate, 
to be ashamed of a charge with which ouv Lord 
and his apostles were invested. If she were my 
wife, I should shortly say to her, ‘Wilt thou 
follow me, aye or no? Reply forthwith’; and 
if she replied, ‘No,’ I would leave her, and take 
another wife.’’ 
I have no pleasure in any man who despises 
music. It is no invention of ours: it is the gift 
of God. I place it next to theology. Satan 
hates musie: he knows how it drives the evil 
spirit out of us. 
The strength and glory of a town does not 
depend on its wealth, its walls, its great: man- 
sions, its powerful armaments; but on thé number 
of its learned, serious, kind, and well-educated 
citizens. 
Greek and Latin are the seabbard which holds 
the sword of the Spirit, the cases which enclose 
the precious jewels, the vessels which contain the 
old wine, the baskets which carry the loaves and 
fishes for the feeding of the multitude. 
Only a little of the first fruits of wisdom— 
only a few fragments of the boundless heights, 
breadths, and depths of truth—have I been able 
to gather.

It is a lighter sin to take pears and apples than 
to take money. I shudder when I think what 
I went through myself. My mother beat me 
about some nuts once till the blood came. I had a

Never be hard with children. Many a fine 
character has been ruined by the stupid brutality 
of pedagogs. The parts of speech are a boy’s

My being such a small creature was a mis-

POETRY AND PAINTING COMPARED* 
Tu first person who compared painting and 
poetry with one another was a man of refined 
feeling, who became aware of a similar effect 
produced upon himself by both arts. He felt 
both represent what is absent as if it were pres- 
ent, and appearance as if it were reality; that 
both deceived, and that the deception of both is 
pleasing. 
A second observer sought to penetrate below 
the surface of this pleasure, and discovered that 
in both it flowed from the same source. Beauty, 
the idea of which we first deduce from bodily 
1¥from the preface to the “Laocodn.” ‘Translated by E. 
©. Beasley and Helen Zimmern. An earlier translation ef

  objects, possesses universal laws, applicable to 
more things than one; to actions and to thoughts 
as well as to forms. : 
A third reflected upon the value and distribu- 
tion of these universal laws, and noticed that 
some are more predominant in painting, others 
in poetry; that thus, in the latter ease, poetry 
will help to explain and illustrate painting; in 
the former, painting will do the same for poetry, 
The first was the amateur, the second the phi- 
losopher, the third the critic, 
The first two could not easily make a wrong use 
of either their feelings or conclusions. On the other 
hand, the value of the critic’s observations mainly 
depends upon the correctness of their applica- 
tion to the individual case; and since for one 
elear-sighted critic ‘here have always been fifty 
ingenious ones, it would have been a wonder if 
this application had always been applied with all 
that caution which is required to hold the balance 
equally between the two arts. 
If Apelles and Protogenes, in their lost writings 
on painting, affirmed and illustrated its laws by 
the previously established rules of poetry, we 
may feel sure that they did it with that modera- 
tion and accuracy with which we now see, in 
the works of Aristotle, Cicero, Horace, and Quin- 
tilian, the principles and experience of painting 
applied to eloquence and poetry. It is the priv- 
ilege of the ancients never in any matter to do 
too much or too little. 
But in many points we moderns have imagined 
that we have advanced far beyond them, because 
we have changed their narrow lanes into high- 
ways, even tho the shorter and safer highways

  contract ‘into footpaths as they lead through 
deserts. 
The dazzling antithesis of the Greek Voltaire, 
‘‘Painting is dumb poetry, and poetry is speaking 
painting,’’ can never have been found in any 
didactic work; it was an idea, amongst others, 
of Simonides, and the truth it contains is so 
evident that we feel compelled to overlook the 
indistinetness and error which accompany it. 
And yet the ancients did not overlook them. 
They confined the expression of Simonides to the 
effeet of either art, but at the same time forgot 
not to ineuleate that, notwithstanding the com- 
plete similarity of this effect, the two were dif- 
ferent, both in the objects which they imitated, 
and in their mode of imitation. 
But, just as tho no such difference existed, 
many recent critics have drawn from this har- 
mony of poetry and painting the most ill-digested 
conclusions. At one time they compress poetry 
into the narrower limits of painting; at another 
they allow painting to occupy the whole wide 
sphere of poetry. Everything, say they, that the 
one is entitled to should be conceded to the other; 
everything that pleases or displeases in the one 
is necessarily pleasing or displeasing in the other. 
Full of this idea, they give utterance in the most 
confident tone to the most shallow decisions; 
when, criticizing the works of a poet and painter 
upon the same subject, they set down as faults 
any divergences they may observe, laying the 
blame upon the one or the other accordingly as 
they may have more taste for poetry or for 
painting. 
Indeed, this false criticism has misled in some

  degree the professors of art. It-has produced the 
love of description in poetry, and'of allegory in 
painting: while the critics strove to reduce poetry 
to a speaking painting, without properly knowing 
what it could and ought to paint;: and. painting 
to a dumb poem, without having considered in 
what degree it could express general ideas with- 
out alienating itself from its destiny, and de- 
generating into an arbitrary method of writing.

OF SUFFERING HELD IN RESTRAINT? 
Heer WINCKELMANN has pronounced a noble 
simplicity and quiet grandeur, displayed in the 
posture no less than in the expression, to be the 
characteristic features common to all the Greek 
masterpieces of painting and sculpture. ‘‘As,’? 
says he, ‘‘the depths of the sea always remain 
ealm, however much the surface may be raging, 
so the expression in the figures of the Greeks, 
under every form of passion, shows a great and 
self-collected soul. . 
“(This spirit is portrayed in the countenance 
of Laocoén, and not in the counteriance alone, 
under the most violent suffering; the pain dis- 
covers itself in every muscle and sinew of his 
body, and the beholder, while looking at the 
agonized contraction of the abdomen, without .

  viewing the face and the other parts, believes 
that he almost feels the pain himself. This pain 
expresses itself, however, without any violence, 
both in the features and in the whole posture. 
He raises no terrible shriek, such as Virgil makes 
his Laocoén utter, for the opening of the mouth 
does not admit it; it is rather an anxious and 
‘supprest sigh, as described by Sadoleto. The 
pain of body and grandeur of soul are, as it were, 
weighed out, and distributed with equal strength 
through the whole frame of the figure. Laocoén 
suffers, but he suffers as the Philoctetes of So- 
phocles; his misery pierces us to the very soul, 
but inspires us with a wish that we could endure 
misery like that great man. 
‘‘The expressing of so great a soul is far higher 
than the painting of beautiful nature. The artist 
roust have felt within himself that strength of 
spirit. which he imprinted upon his marble. 
Greece had philosophers and artists in one per- 
son, and more than one Metrodorus. Philosophy 
gave her hand to art, and breathed into its figures 
more than ordinary souls.’’ 
The cbservation on which the foregoing re- 
marks are founded, ‘‘that the pain in the face of 
Laocoén does not show itself with that foree 
which its intensity would have led us to expect,’’ 
is perfectly correct. Moreover, it is indisputable 
that it is in this very point where the half- 
eonnoisseur would have decided that the artist 
had fallen short of nature, and had not reached 
the true pathos of pain, that his wisdom is par- 
ticularly conspicuous. 
But I confess I differ from Winckelmann as 
to what is in his opinion the basis of this wisdom, 
90

GOTTHOLD EPHRAIM LESSING re 
and as to the universality of the rule which he 
deduces from it. 
I acknowledge that I was startled, first by the 
glance of disapproval which he casts upon Virgil, and secondly by the comparison with Philoctetes. ~ 
From this point then I shall set out, and write 
down my thoughts as they were developed in me. 
*(Laocoén suffers as Sophocles’ Philoetetes.’’ 
But how does the latter suffer? It is curious that 
his sufferings should Jeave such a different im- 
pression behind them. The cries, the shrieking, 
the wild impreeations, with which he filled the 
camp, and interrupted all the sacrifices and holy 
rites, resound no less horribly through his desert 
island, and were the cause of his being banished 
to it. The same sounds of despondeney, sorrow, 
and despair fill the theater in the poet’s imita- 
tion. It has been observed that the third. act of this piece is shorter than the others; from this it-may be gathered, say the critics, that the 
ancients took little pains to preserve a uniformity 
of length in the different acts. I quite agree 
with them, but I should rather ground my opinion 
upon another example than this. The sorrowful 
exelamations and the moanings, of which this act 
consists, must have been pronounced with ten- 
sions and breakings off altogether different from 
those required in a continuous speech, and doubt- 
less made this act last quite as long in the 
representation as the others. It appears much 
shorter to the reader, when seen on paper, than 
it must have done to the audience in a. theater. 
A cry is the natural expression of bodily pain. 
Homer’s wounded heroes frequently fall with 
eries to the ground. He makes Venus, when 
91
-P-A-G-E-104
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS   
merely scratched, shriek aloud; not that he may 
thereby paint the effeminacy of the goddess of 
pleasure, but rather that he may give suffering 
Nature her due; for even the iron Mars, when 
he feels the lance of Diomedes, shrieks so hor- 
ribly that his cries are like those of ten thousand 
furious warriors, and fill both armies with horror. 
Tho Homer, in other respects, raises his heroes 
. above human nature, they always remain faithful 
to it in matters connected with the feeling of 
pain and insult, or its expression through eries, 
tears, or reproaches. In their actions they are 
beings of a higher order, in their feelings true 
men. : 
I know that we, more refined Europeans, of 
a wiser and later age, know how to keep our 
mouths and eyes under closer. restraint. We are 
forbidden by courtesy and propriety to ery and 
weep; and with us the active bravery of the first 
rough age of the world has been changed into 
a passive. Yet even our own ancestors, tho bar- 
barians, were greater in the latter than in the 
former, To suppress all pain, to meet the stroke 
of death with unflinching eye, to die laughing 
under the bites of adders, to lament neither their 
sins nor the loss of their dearest friends—these 
were the characteristics of the old heroic courage 
of the north. Palnatoki forbade his Jomsburgers 
either to fear or so much as to mention the name 
of fear. 
Not so the Greek. He felt and feared. He 
gave utterance to his pain and sorrow. He was 
ashamed of no human weaknesses, only none of 
them must hold him back from the path of honor, 
or impede him in the fulfilment of his duty.

EL 
What in the barbarian sprang from habit and’ 
ferocity arose from principle in the Greek. With 
him heroism was as the spark concealed in flint, 
which, so long as no external force awakens it, 
sleeps in quiet, nor robs the stone either of its 
clearness or its coldness. With the barbarian 
it was a bright consuming flame, which was ever 
roaring, and devoured, or at least blackened, ev- 
ery other good quality. Thus, when Homer makes 
the Trojans march to the combat with wild cries, 
the Greeks, on the contrary, in resolute silence, 
the erities justly observe that the poet intended 
to depict the one as barbarians, the other as 
a civilized people. I wonder that they have not 
remarked a similar contrast of character in an- 
other passage. The hostile armies have made a 
truce; they are busied with burning their dead; 
and these rites are accompanied on both sides 
with the warm flow of tears. But Priam forbids 
the Trojans to weep. He forbade them to weep, 
says Dacier, because he feared the effect would 
be too softening, and that on the morrow they 
would go with less courage to the battle. True! 
But why, I ask, should Priam only fear this 
result? Why does not Agamemnon also lay the 
same prohibition on the Greeks? The poet has 
a deeper meaning; he wishes to teach us that the 
civilized Greek could be brave at the same time 
that he wept, while in the uncivilized Trojan all 
human feelings were to be previously stified. 
It is worth observing that among the few 
tragedies which have come down to us from an- 
tiquity two are found in which bodily pain con- 
stitutes not the lightest part of the misfortune 
which, befalls the suffering bheroes—the Philoc- 
93

tetes and the dying Hercules. Sophocles paints 
the. last also as moaning and shrieking, weeping 
and erying. Thanks to our polite neighbors, those 
masters of propriety, no such ridieulous and in- 
tolerable characters as a moaning Philoctetes or 
a shrieking Hercules will ever again appear upon 
the stage. One of their latest poets has indeed 
ventured upon a Philoctetes, but would he have 
dared to exhibit the true one? > 
Even a Laocodn is found among the lost plays 
of Sophocles. Would that fate had spared it to 
us! The slight mention which some old gram- 
marians have made of it affords us no ground 
for concluding how the poet had handled his 
subject; but of this I feel certain, that Laocoén 
would not have been drawn more stoically than 
‘Philoctetes and Hercules. All stoicism is un- 
dramatical; and our sympathy is always pro- 
portioned to the suffering exprest by the object 
which interests us. It is true if we see him bear 
his misery with a great soul, this grandeur of 
soul excites our admiration; but admiration is 
only a cold emotion, and its inactive astonishment 
excludes every warmer passion as well as every 
distinct idea. 
I now come to my inference; if it be true that 
a ery at the sensation of bodily pain, particularly 
aceording to the old Greek way of thinking, is 
quite compatible with greatness of soul, it can 
not have been for the sake of expressing such 
greatness that the artist avoided imitating this 
shriek in marble. Another reason therefore must 
be found for his here deviating from his rival, 
the poet, who expresses it with the highest pur- 
pose. ,

  dinary monsters, which appear to set probability 
and dignity alike at defiance.’’ 
‘‘T would advise you,’’ said the other, ‘‘to 
make a trial, notwithstanding: it ean do one no 
harm to look at what is extraordinary with one’s 
own eyes. I will lend you a volume or two; and 
you ean not better spend your time than by 
easting everything aside, and retiring to the soli- 
tude of your old habitation, to look into the magic 
lantern of that unknown world. It is sinful of 
_you to waste your hours in dressing out these 
apes to look more human, and teaching dogs to 
dance. One thing only I require—you must not 
cavil at the form; the rest I can leave to your 
own good sense and feeling.’’ 
The horses were standing at the door; and 
Jarno mounted with some other cavaliers to go 
and hunt. Wilhelm looked after him with sad- 
ness. He would fain have spoken much with this 
man who tho in a harsh, unfriendly way, gave 
him new ideas—ideas that he had need of. 
Oftentimes a man, when approaching some de- 
velopment of his powers, capacities, and concep- 
tions, gets into a perplexity from which a prudent 
friend might easily deliver him. He resembles 
a traveler, who, at but a short distance from 
the inn he is to rest at, falls into the water: were 
any one to catch him then and pull him to the 
bank, with one good wetting it were over; where- 
as, tho he struggles out himself, it is often at the 
side where he tumbled in, and he has to make a 
wide and weary circuit before’ reaching his ap- 
pointed object. 
Wilhelm now began to have an inkling that 
things went forward in the world differently from 
96
-P-A-G-E-109
—_—_— 
JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE 
  what he had supposed. He now viewed close at 
hand the solemn and imposing life of the great 
and. distinguished, and wondered at the easy dig- 
nity which they contrived to give it. An army 
on its march, a princely hero at the head of it, 
such a multitude of cooperating warriors, such 
a multitude of crowding. worshipers, exalted his 
imagination. In this mood he received the prom- 
ised books; and ere long, as may be easily sup- 
posed, the stream of that mighty genius laid hold of him and led him down to a shoreless ocean, where he soon completely forgot and lost him- 
self... 
Wilhelm had scarcely read one or two of Shake- 
speare’s plays till their effect on him became so 
strong that he could go-no further. His whole 
soul was in commotion. He sought an oppor- 
tunity to speak with Jarno; to whom, on meeting 
with him, he exprest his boundless gratitude for 
such delicious entertainment. 
“T clearly enough foresaw,’’ said Jarno, ‘‘that . 
you would not remain insensible to the charms 
of the most extraordinary and most admirable of 
all writers. ’” : . 
“Yes!?? exclaimed our friend: ‘‘I can not ree- 
ollect that any book, any man, any incident of 
my life, has produced such important effects on 
me as the precious works to which by your kind- 
ness I have been directed. They seem as if they 
were performances of some celestial genius de- 
scending among men, to make them by the mildest 
instructions acquainted with themselves. They 
are no fictions! You would think, while reading 
them, you stood before the enclosed awful Books 
of Fate, while the whirlwind of most impassioned.

  life was howling through the leaves, and tossing 
them fiercely to and fro. The strength and ten- 
derness, the power and peacefulness of this man 
have so astonished and transported me that I 
long vehemently for the time when I shall have 
it in my power to read further.’’ 
“‘Bravo!’’? said Jarno, holding out his hand, 
and squeezing our friend’s. ‘‘This is as it should 
be! And the consequences which I hope for will 
likewise surely follow.’’ 
**T wish,’’ said Wilhelm, ‘‘I could but disclose 
to you all that is going on within me even now. 
All the anticipations I have ever had regarding 
man and his destiny, which have aceompanied me 
from youth upward often unobserved by myself, 
I find developed and fulfilled in Shakespeare’s 
writings. It seems as if he cleared up every one 
of our enigmas to us, tho we can not say, Here 
or there is the word of solution. His men ap- 
pear like natural men, and yet they are not. 
These, the most mysterious and complex produc- 
tions of creation,’ here act before us as if they 
were watches, whose dial-plates and eases were 
of erystal, which pointed out according to their 
use their course of the hours and minutes; while 
at the same time you could discern the combina- 
tion of wheels and springs that turn them. The 
few glances I have cast over Shakespeare’s world 
ineitte me, more than anything beside, to quicken 
my footsteps forward into the actual world, to 
mingle in the flood of destinies that is suspended 
over it; and at length, if I shall prosper, to draw 
a few cups from the great ocean of true nature, 
and to distribute them from off the stage among 
the thirsting people of my native land.’’

THE CORONATION OF JOSEPH II* 
Tue coronation-day dawned at last, on the 34 
of April, 1764; the weather was favorable,.and 
everybody was in motion. I, with saveral/ of my 
relations and friends, had been: provided. with a good place in one of the upper. stories of ‘the: 
Rémer itself, where we might completely survey 
the whole. We betook ourselves'to the spot very 
early in the morning, and from above, as in a 
bird’s-eye view, contemplated the arrangements 
which we had inspected more closely the’ day 
before. There was the newly-erected fountain, 
with two large tubs on the left and right, into 
which the double-eagle on the post was to pour’. 
from its two beaks white wine on this side and: 
red wine on that. There, gathered into/a heap, 
lay the oats; here stood the large wooden hut, 
in which we had several days since seen the whole 
fat ox roasted and basted on a huge spit before 
a charcoal fire. All the avenues leading out from 
the Rémer, and from other streets back to the 
Romer, were secured on both sides by barriers 
and guards. The great square was gradually

  filled, and the waving and pressure grew every 
moment stronger and more in motion, as the 
multitude always, if possible, endeavored to reach 
the spot where some new scene arose, and some- 
thing particular was announeed. 
All this time there reigned a tolerable stillness, 
and when the alarm-bells were sounded, all the 
people.seemed struck with terror and amazement. 
4 first attracted the attention of all who 
could overlock the square from above was the 
train in which: the lords of Aix and Nuremberg 
brought the crown-jewels to the cathedral. These, 
as palladia, had been assigned the first place in 
the carriage, and the deputies sat before them 
on the back seat with becoming reverence. Now 
the three electors betake themselves to the cathe- 
dral. After the presentation of the insignia to 
the Elector of Mentz, the crown and sword are 
immediately earried to the imperial quarters. The 
further .arrangements and manifold ceremonies 
occupied, in the interim, the chief persons, as 
well as the spectators, in the church, as we other 
well-informed persons could well imagine. 
In the meanwhile before our eyes the ambas- 
sadors ascended to the Rémer, from which the 
eanopy is carried by the under-officers into the 
- imperial quarters. The Hereditary Marshal, 
Count von Pappenheim, instantly mounts his 
horse; he was a very handsome slender gentle- 
man, whom the Spanish costume, the rich doublet, 
the gold mantle, the high feathered hat, and the 
loose flying hair, became very well. He puts 
himself in motion, and amid the sound of all the 
bells, the ambassadors follow him on horseback 
to the quarters of the Emperor in still greater

  magnificence. than on the day of election. One 
would have liked to be there too, as indeed on 
this day it would have been altogether desirable 
to multiply one’s self. However, we told each 
other what was going on there. Now the Em-. 
peror is putting on his domestic robes, we said 
a new dress, and after the old Carolingian pat- 
tern, The hereditary officers receive the insignia, 
and with them get on horseback. . The Emperor 
in his robes, the Roman King in the Spanish 
habit, immediately mount their steeds; and while 
this is done, the endless procession which precedes 
them has already announced them. 
The eye was already wearied: by the multitude 
of riehly-drest attendants and magistrates, and 
by the nobility who, in stately fashion, were 
moving along; but when the electoral envoys, the 
hereditary officers, and at last, under the richly- 
embroidered canopy, borne by twelve Schéffen 
and senators, the Emperor, in romantic costume, 
and to the left, a little behind him, in the Spanish 
dress, his son, slowly floated along on magni- 
ficently adorned horses, the eye was no more 
sufficient for the sight. One would have liked 
to detain the scene, but for a moment, by a magic 
charm; but the glory passed on without stopping, 
and the space that was scarcely quitted was . 
immediately. filled again by the crowd, which 
poured in like billows. 
Bat now a new pressure took place; for another 
approach from the market to the Rémer gate had 
to be opened, and a road of planks to be bridged 
over it, on which the train returning from the 
eathedral was to walk. . 
What passed within the cathedral, the endless 
101

  ceremonies which precede and accompany the 
anointing, the crowning, the dubbing of knight- 
hood—all this we were glad to hear told after- 
ward by those who had sacrificed much else to 
be present in the church. 
The rest of us, in the interim, partook of a 
frugal repast; for in this festal day we had to 
be contented with cold meat. But, on the other 
hand, the best and oldest wine had been brought 
out of all the family-cellars, so that in this re- 
spect at least we celebrated the ancient festival 
in ancient style. 
In the square the sight most worth seeing was 
now the bridge, which had been finished and cov- 
ered with orange and white cloth; and we who 
had stared at the Emperor, first in his carriage 
and then on horseback, were now to admire him 
walking on foot. Singularly enough, the last 
pleased us the most; for we thought that in this 
way he exhibited himself both in the most natural 
and in the most dignified manner. 
Older persons, who were present at the corona- 
tion of Francis the First, related that Maria 
Theresa, beautiful beyond measure, had looked 
on this solemnity from a baleony window of the 
Frauenstein house, close to the Romer. As her 
consort returned from the cathedral in his strange 
eostume, and seemed to her, so to speak, like a 
ghost of Charlemagne, he had, as if in jest, raised 
both his hands, and shown her the imperial globe, 
the scepter, and the curious gloves, at which she 
had broken out into immoderate laughter, which 
served for the great delight and edification of 
the crowd, which was thus honored with a sight 
of the good and natural matrimonial understand-

ing between the most exalted couple of Christen- 
dom. But when the Empress, to greet her con- 
sort, waved her handkerchief, and even shouted 
a loud vivat to him, the enthusiasm and exulta- 
tion of the people was raised to the highest, so 
that there was no end to the cheers of joy. . . 
The rejoicings, which resounded from the. mar- 
ket-place, now spread likewise over the great 
square, and a boisterous vivat burst forth from 
thousands upon thousands of throats, and doubt- 
less from as many hearts. For this grand festival 
was to be the pledge of a lasting peace, which 
indeed for many a long year actually blest 
Germany. 
Several days before it had been made known ~ 
by public proclamation that neither the bridge 
nor the eagle over the fountain were to be ex- 
posed to the people, and were therefore not, as 
at other times, to be touched. ‘This was done to 
prevent the mischief inevitable with such a rush 
of persons. But in order to sacrifice in some 
degree to the genius of the mob persons expressly 
appointed went behind the procession, loosened 
the cloth from the bridge, wound it up like a 
flag, and threw it into the air. This gave rise to 
no disaster, but to a laughable mishap; for the 
eloth unrolled itself in the air, and, as it fell, 
covered a larger or smaller number of persons. 
Those now who took hold of the ends and 
drew them toward themselves, pulled all those 
in the middle to the ground, enveloped them and 
teased them till they tore or cut themselves 
through, and everybody, in his own way, had 
borne off a corner of the stuff made sacred by 
the footsteps of majesty. . . .

  It was precisely at the right time that I again 
took possession of my window; for the most 
remarkable part of all that was to be seen in 
publie was just about to take place. All the 
people had turned toward the’ Romer, and a re- 
iterated shout of vivat gave us to understand 
that the Emperor. and King in their vestments 
-were showing themselves to the populace from 
the baleony of the great hall. But they were 
not alone to serve as a spectacle, since another 
strange spectacle occurred before their eyes. 
First of all, the handsome slender Hereditary 
Marshal flung himself upon his steed; he had laid 
aside his sword; in his right hand he held a silver- 
handled vessel, and a tin spatula in his left. He 
rode within the barriers to the great heap of 
oats, sprang in, filled the vessel to overflow, 
smoothed it off, and carried it back again with 
great dignity. The imperial stable was now pro- 
vided for. The Hereditary Chamberlain then 
rode likewise to the spot, and brought back a 
basin with ewer and towel. But more entertain- 
ing for the spectators was the Hereditary Carver, 
who came to fetch a piece of the roasted ox. He 
also rode, with a silver dish, through the bar- 
riers, to the large wooden kitchen, and came 
forth again with his portion covered,.that he 
might. go back to the Romer. Now it was the 
turn of the Hereditary Cupbearer, who rode to 
- the fountain and fetched wine. Thus now was 
the imperial table furnished, and every eye waited 
upon the Hereditary Treasurer, who was to throw 
about the money. . . .

King would return from the cabinet whither

  they had retired from the balcony, and feast’ in 
the great hall of the Rémer. We had been able 
to admire the arrangements made for it the day 
before; and my most anaious wish was, if pos- 
sible, to look in to-day. I repaired, therefore, 
by the usual path, to the great stairease, which 
stands directly opposite the door of the hall. 
Here I gazed at the distinguished personages who 
this day acted as the servants of the head of 
the empire. Forty-four counts, all splendidly 
drest, passed me, carrying the dishes from the 
kitchen, so that the contrast between their dig- 
nity and their occupation might well be bewil- 
dering to a boy. The crowd was not great, but 
considering the little space, sufficiently pereep- 
tible. The hall-door was guarded, while those 
who were authorized went frequently in and out. 
I saw one of the Palatine domestic officials, whom 
I asked whether he could not. take me in with 
him. He did not deliberate long, but gave me 
one of the silver vessels he just then bore—which 
he could do so much the more as I was neatly 
clad; and thus I reached the sanctuary. The 
Palatine buffet stood to the left, directly by the 
door, and with some steps I placed myself on 
the elevation of it, behind the barriers. 
At the other end of the hall, immediately by 
the windows, raised on the steps of the throne, 
and under canopies, sat the Emperor and King 
in their robes; but the crown and scepter lay 
some distance behind them on gold eushions. The 
three spiritual electors, their buffets behind them, 
had taken their places on single elevations; the 
Elector of Mentz opposite their majesties, the 
Flector of Treves at the right, and the Elector of 
105

  Cologne at the left. This upper part of the 
hall was imposing and cheerful to behold, and 
excited the remark that the spiritual power likes 
to keep as long as possible with the ruler. On 
the contrary, the buffets and tables of all the 
temporal electors, which were, indeed, magnifi- 
cently ornamented, but without occupants, made 
one think of the misunderstanding which had 
gradually arisen for centuries between them and 
the head of the empire. Their ambassadors had 
already withdrawn to eat in a side-chamber; and 
if the greater part of the hall assumed a sort of 
spectral appearance, by so many invisible guests 
being so magnificently attended, a large unfur- 
nished table in the middle was still more sad to 
look upon; for there also many covers stood 
empty, because all those who had -certainly a 
right to sit there had, for appearance sake, kept 
away, that on the greatest day of honor they 
might not renounce any of their honor, if indeed 
they were then to be found in the eity.

THE BATTLE OF LUTZEN*

  ping on their knees, burst into a moving hymn, 
accompanied by the military musi¢. The King 
then mounted his horse, and, clad only in a leath- 
er doublet and surtout (for a wound he had 
formerly received prevented his wearing armor), 
rode along the ranks, to animate the courage of 
his troops with a joyful confidence, which, how- 
ever, the foreboding presentiment of his own 
bosom contradicted. ‘‘God with us!’’ was the war- 
ery of the Swedes; ‘‘Jesus Maria!’’ that of the 
Imperialists. About eleven the fog began to dis- 
perse, and the enemy became visible. At the 
same moment Lutzen was seen in flames, having 
been set on fire by command of the duke, to 
prevent his being outflanked on that side. The 
charge was now sounded; the cavalry rushed 
upon the enemy, and the infantry advanced 
against the trenches. 
Received by a tremendous fire of musketry and 
heavy artillery, these intrepid battalions main- 
tained the attack with undaunted courage, till 
the enemy’s musketeers abandoned their posts, 
the trenches were passed, the battery earried and 
turned against the enemy. They prest forward 
with irresistible impetuosity; the first of the five 
_ Imperial brigades was immediately routed, the 
second soon after, and the third put to flight. 
But here the genius of Wallenstein opposed itself 
to their progress. With the rapidity of lightning 
he was on the spot to rally his discomfited troops ; 
and his powerful word was sufficient to stop the 
flight of the fugitives. Supported by three regi- 
ments of cavalry, the vanquished brigades, form- 
ing anew, faced the enemy, and prest vigorously 
into the broken ranks of the Swedes. A mur-

  derous conflict ensued. The nearness of the en- 
emy left no room for firearms, the fury of the 
attack no time for loading; man was matched 
to man, the useless musket exchanged for the 
sword and pike, and science gave way to despera- 
tion. Overpowered by numbers, the wearied 
Swedes at last retire beyond the trenches, and the 
captured battery is again lost by the retreat. A 
thousand mangled bodies already strewed the 
plain, and as yet nota single step of ground 
had been won. 
In the mean time the King’s right wing, led by 
himself, had fallen upon the enemy’s left. The 
first impetuous shock of the heavy Finland cui- 
rassiers dispersed the lightly-mounted Poles and 
Croats who were posted here, and their disorderly 
flight spread terror and confusion among the rest. 
of the cavalry. At this moment notice was 
brought the King that his infantry were retreat- 
ing over the trenches, and also that his left wing, 
exposed to a severe fire from the enemy’s cannon 
posted at the windmills, was beginning to give 
way. With rapid decision he committed to Gen- 
eral Horn the pursuit of the enemy’s left, while 
he flew, at the head of the regiment of Steinbock, 
to repair the disorder of his right wing. His 
noble charger bore him with the velocity of 
lightning across the trenches, but the squadrons 
that followed could not come on with the same 
speed, and only a few horsemen, among whom 
was Francis Albert, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, 
were able to keep up with the King. He. rode 
directly to- the place where his infantry were 
most closely prest, and while he was recon- 
noitering the enemy’s line for an exposed point

  of attack, the shortness of his sight unfortunately 
led him too close to their ranks. 
An imperial Gefreiter remarking that every 
one respectfully made way for him as he rode 
along, immediately ordered a musketeer to take 
aim at him. ‘‘Fire at him yonder,’’ said he: 
“that must be a man of consequence.’’ The 
soldier fired, and the King’s left arm was shat- 
tered. At that moment his squadron came hur- 
rying up, and a confused ery of ‘‘The King 
bleeds! the King is shot!’’ spread terror and 
consternation through all the ranks. ‘‘It is noth- 
ing! follow me,’’ cried the King, collecting his 
whole strength; but, overcome by pain, and nearly 
fainting, he requested the Duke of Lauenburg, in 
Freneh to lead him unobserved out of the tumult. 
While the duke proceeded toward the right wing 
with the King, making a long cireuit to keep this 
diseouraging sight from the disordered infantry, 
his Majesty received a second shot through the 
back which deprived him of his remaining 
strength. ‘‘Brother,’’ said he, with a dying voice, 
“‘T have enough! look only to your own life.’? 
At the same moment he fell from his horse, 
pierced by several more shots; and, abandoned 
by all his attendants, he breathed his last amidst 
the plundering bands of the Croats. His charger, 
flying without its rider, and covered with blood, 
soon made known to the Swedish cavalry the 
fall of their King. They rushed madly forward 
to rescue his sacred remains from the hands of 
the eneniy. A murderous conflict ensued over 
the body, till his mangled remains were buried 
beneath a heap of slain. 
The mournful tidings soon ran through the

Swedish army; but, instead of destroying the 
courage of these brave troops, it but excited it 
into a new, a wild and consuming flame. Life 
had lessened in value, now that the most sacred 
life of all was gone; death had no terrors for 
the lowly since the anointed head was not spared. 
With the fury of lions the Upland, Smaland, Fin- 
land, East and West Gothland regiments rushed 
a second time upon the left wing of the enemy, 
which, already making but feeble resistance to 
General Horn, was now entirely beaten from the 
field. Bernard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, gave to 
the bereaved Swedes a noble leader in his own 
person; and the spirit of Gustavus led his vic- 
torious squadrons anew. The left wing quickly 
formed again and vigorously prest the right 
of the Imperialists. The artillery at the wind- 
mills, whieh had maintained so murderous a fire 
upon the Swedes, was captured and turned 
against the enemy. The center, also, of the Swe- 
dish infantry, commanded by the duke and Kuyp- 
hausen, advanced a second time against the 
trenches, which they successfully passed, and re- 
took the battery of seven cannons. The attack 
was now renewed with redoubled fury upon the 
heavy battalions of the enemy’s center; their 
resistance became gradually less, and ehance con- 
spired with Swedish valor to complete the defeat. 
The imperial powder-wagons took fire, and, with 
a tremendous explosion, grenades and bombs filled 
the air. The enemy, now in confusion, thought 
they were attacked in the rear, while the Swedish 
brigades prest them in front. Their courage 
began io fail them. Their left wing was already 
beaten, their right wavering, and their artillery

  in the enemy’s hands. The battle seemed to be 
almost decided; another moment would decide 
the fate of the day, when Pappenheim appeared 
on the field, with his euirassiers and dragoons: 
all the advantages already gained were lost, and 
the battle was to be fought anew. 
The order which recalled that general to Lutzen 
had reached him in Haile, while his troops were 
still plundering that town. It was impossible to 
collect the scattered infantry with that rapidity 
which the urgency of the order and Pappenheim’s 
impatience required. Without waiting for it, 
therefore, he ordered eight regiments of cavalry 
to. mount, and at their head he galloped at full 
speed for Lutzen, to share in the battle. He 
arrived in time to witness the flight of the Im- 
perial right wing, which Gustavus. Horn was 
driving from the field, and to be at first. involved 
in their rout. But with rapid presence of mind 
he rallied the flying troops, and led them once 
more against the enemy. Carried away by his 
wild bravery, and impatient to encounter the 
King, who he supposed was at the head of this 
wing, he burst furiously upon the Swedish ranks, 
whieh, exhausted by victory and inferior in num- 
bers were after a noble resistance, overpowered 
by this fresh body of enemies. Pappenheim’s 
unexpected appearance revived the drooping cour- 
age of the Imperialists, and the Duke of Fried 
land quickly availed himself of the favorable 
moment to reform his line. 
The closely-serried battalions of the Swedes 
were, after a tremendous conflict, again driven 
across the trenches, and the battery, which had 
been twice lost, again rescued from their hands.

  The whole yellow regiment, the finest of all that 
distinguished themselves in this dreadful day, lay 
dead on the field, covering the ground almost in 
the same excellent order which, when alive, they 
maintained with such unyielding courage. The 
same fate befell another regiment of Blues, which 
Count Piceolomini attacked with the imperial cav- 
alry and eut down after a desperate contest. 
Seven times did this intrepid general renew the 
attack; seven horses were shot under him, and 
he himself was pierced with six musket-balls; yet 
he would not leave the field until he was carried 
along in the general rout of the whole army. 
‘Wallenstein himself was seen riding through his 
ranks with cool intrepidity, amidst a shower of 
balls, assisting the distrest, encouraging the vali- 
ant with praise and the wavering by his fearful 
glance. Around and close by him his men were 
falling thick, and his own mantle was perforated 
by several shots. But avenging destiny this day 
protected that breast for which another weapon 
was reserved; on the same field where the noble 
Gustavus expired, Wallenstein was not allowed to 
terminate his guilty career. 
Less fortunate was Pappenheim, the Telamon 
of the army, the bravest soldier of Austria and 
the Church. An ardent desire to encounter the 
King in person earried this daring leader into the 
thickest of the fight, where he thought his noble 
opponent was most surely to be met. Gustavus 
had also exprest a wish to meet his brave antag- 
enist, but these hostile wishes remained ungrati- 
fied; death first brought together these two great” 
heroes. Two musket-balls pierced the breast of 
Pappenheim, and his men forcibly carried him 
vVili—8 113

  from the field. While they were conveying him 
to the rear, a murmur reached him that he whom 
he had sought lay dead upon the plain. When 
the truth of the report was confirmed to him, 
his look became brighter, his dying eye sparkled 
with a last gleam of joy. ‘‘Tell the Duke of 
Friedland,’’ said he, ‘‘that I lie without hope 
. of life, but that I die happy, since I know that 
the implacable enemy of my religion has fallen 
on the same day.’? 
With Pappenheim the good fortune of the 
Imperialists departed. The cavalry of the left 
wing, already beaten, and only rallied by his 
exertions, no sooner missed their victorious leader 
than they gave up everything for lost and aban- 
doned the field of battle in spiritless despair. 
The right field fell into the same confusion, with 
the exception of a few regiments which the 
bravery of their colonels, Gotz, Terzky, Colloredo, 
and Piccolomini, compelled to keep their ground. 
The Swedish infantry, with prompt determina- 
tion, profited by the enemy’s confusion. To fill 
up the gaps which death had made in the front 
line, they formed both lines into one, and with 
it made the final and decisive charge. A third 
time they crossed the trenches, and a third time 
they captured the battery. 
_ The sun was setting when the two lines elosed. 
The strife grew hotter as it drew to an end; 
the last efforts of strength were mutually exerted, 
and skill and courage did their utmost to repair 
in those precious moments the fortune of the 
day. It was in vain; despair endows every one 
with superhuman strength ; no one can conquer, 
no one will give way: The art of war seemed 
114
-P-A-G-E-127
  FRIEDRICH VON SCHILLER 
  to exhaust its powers on one side, only to unfold 
some new and untried masterpiece of skill on the 
other. Night and darkness at last put an end 
to the fight, before the fury of the combatants 
was exhausted; and the contest only ceased when 
no one could any longer find an antagonist. Both 
armies separated, as if by tacit agreement; the 
trumpets sounded, and each party, claiming the 
victory, quitted the field. . . . 
The Duke of Friedland’ had retreated thither, 
and was followed on the morrow by the scattered 
remains of his army, without artillery, without 
colors, and almost without arms. The Duke of 
Weimar, it appears, after the toils of this bloody. 
day, allowed the Swedish army some repose, be- 
tween Lutzen and Weissenfels, near enough to 
the field of battle to oppose any attempt the 
enemy might make to recover it. Of the two 
armies more than nine thousand men lay dead; 
a still greater number were wounded, and among 
the Imperialists scarcely a man escaped from the 
field uninjured. The entire plain from Lutzen 
to the Canal was strewed with the wounded, the - 
dying, and the dead. History says nothing of 
prisoners; a further proof of the animosity of 
the combatants, who neither gave nor took quar- 
tern 2. . 
Duke Bernard, by keeping possession of the 
field, and soon after by the capture of Leipsic, 
maintained indisputably his elaim to the title of 
vietor. But it was a dear conquest, a dearer 
triumph! It was not till the fury of the contest 
was over that the full weight of the loss sus- 
tained was felt, and the shout of triumph died

away into a silent gloom of despair. He who 
had led them to the charge returned not with 
them: there he lay upon the field which he had 
won, mingled with the dead bodies of the common 
erowd. After a long and almost fruitless search, 
the corpse of the King was discovered not very 
far from the great stone which, for a hundred 
years before, had stood between Lutzen and the 
Canal, and which, from the memorable disaster of 
that day, still bears the name of the ‘‘Stone of 
the Swede.’’? Covered with blood and wounds, 
so as scarcely to be recognized, trampled beneath 
the horses’ hoofs, stript by the rude hands of 
plunderers of its ornaments and clothes, his body 
was drawn from beneath a heap of dead, econ- 
veyed to Weissenfels, and there delivered up to 
the lamentations of his soldiers and the last 
embraces of his Queen. The first tribute had 
been paid to revenge, and blood had atoned for 
the blood of the monarch; but now affection as- 
sumed its rights, and tears of grief must flow for 
the man. The universal sorrow absorbs all in- 
dividual woes. The generals, still stupefied by 
the unexpected blow, stood speechless and motion- 
Jess around his bier, and no one trusted himself 
enough to contemplate the full extent of their 
loss.

PHILIP II AND THE NETHERLANDS? 
Or those important political events which make 
the sixteenth eentury to take rank among the 
brightest of the world’s epochs, the foundation 
of the freedom of the Netherlands appears to 
me one of the most remarkable. If the glittering 
exploits of ambition and the pernicious lust of 
power claim our admiration, how much more so 
should an event in which opprest humanity strug- 
gled for its noblest right, where with the good 
eause unwonted powers were united, and the 
resources of resolute despair triumphed in un- 
equal contest over the terrible arts of tyranny. 
Great and encouraging is the reflection that 
there is a resource left us against the arrogant 
usurpations of despotic power; that its hbest- 
contrived plans against the liberty of mankind 
may be frustrated; that resolute opposition can 
weaken even the outstretched arm of tyranny: 
and that heroie perseverance can eventually ex- 
haust its fearful resources. 
Never did this truth affect me so sensibly as 
in tracing the history of that memorable rebellion 
which forever severed the United Netherlands 
from the Spanish crown. Therefore I thought 
it not unworth the while to attempt to exhibit 
to the world this grand memorial of social union,

  in the hope that it may awaken in the breast of 
my reader a spirit-stirring consciousness of his 
own powers, and give a new and irrefragable 
example of what in a good cause men may both 
dare and venture, and what by union they may 
accomplish. It is not the extraordinary or heroic 
features of this event that induce me to describe 
it. The annals of the world record perhaps many 
similar enterprises, which may have been even 
bolder in the conception, and more brilliant in 
the execution. Some states have fallen after a 
nobler struggle, others have risen with more 
exalied strides. Nor are we here to look for 
eminent heroes; colossal talents, or those mar- 
velous exploits which the history of past times 
presents in such rich abundance. Those times 
are gone, such men are no more. In the soft 
lap of refinement, we have suffered the energetic 
powers to become enervated whieh those ages 
ealled into action and rendered indispensable. 
With admiring awe, we wonder at these gigantic 
images of the past, as a feeble old man gazes 
on the athletic sports of youth. 
Not so, however, in the history before us. The 
people here presented to our notice were the 
most peaceful in o:r quarter of the globe, and 
less capable than their neighbors of that heroic 
spirit which stamps a lofty charaeter even on the 
most insignificant actions. The pressure of cir- 
eumstances with its peculiar influence surprized 
them and forced a transitory greatness upon 
them, which they never could have possest, and 
perhaps will never possess again. It is, indeed, 
exactly this want of heroic grandeur which ren- 
ders this event peculiarly instructive; and while 
118
-P-A-G-E-131

  others aim at showing the superiority of genius 
over chance, I shall here paint a scene where 
necessity creates genius, and accident makes 
heroes. 
If, in any case, it be allowable to recognize 
the intervention of Providence in human affairs, 
it is certainly so in the present history, its course 
appears so contradictory to reason and expe- 
rience. Philip II, the most powerful sovereign 
of his time—whose dreaded supremacy menaced 
the independence of Europe—whose treasures 
surpassed the collective wealth of all the mon- 
archs of Christendom besides—whose ambitious 
projects were backed by numerous and well- 
disciplined armies—whose troops, hardened by 
long and bloody wars, and confident in past vic- 
tories and in the irresistible prowess of this 
nation, were eager for any enterprise that prom- 
ised glory and spoil, and ready to second with 
prompt obedience the daring genius of their 
jeaders—this dreaded potentate here appears be- 
fore us obstinately pursuing one favorite project, 
devoting to it the untiring efforts of a long reign, 
and bringing all these terrible resources to bear 
upon it; but foreed, in the evening of his days, 
to abandon it—here we see the mighty Philip I 
engaging in combat with a few weak and power- 
Jess adversaries, and retiring from it at last with 
disgrace. 
And with what adversaries? Here, a peaceful 
tribe of fishermen and shepherds, in an almost 
forgotten corner of Europe, which with difficulty 
they had reseued from the ocean; the sea their 
profession, and at onee their wealth and their 
plague; poverty with freedom their highest. bless-

ing, their glory, their virtue. There, a harmless, 
moral commercial people, reveling in the abun- 
dant fruits of thriving industry, and jealous of 
the maintenance of laws which had proved their 
benefactors. In the happy leisure of affluence, 
they forsake the narrow circle of immediate 
wants, and learn to thirst after higher and nobler 
gratifications. The new views of truth whose 
benignant dawn now broke over Europe cast a 
fertilizing beam on this favored clime, and the 
free burgher admitted with joy the light which 
opprest and miserable slaves shut out. A spirit 
of independence, which is the ordinary companion 
of prosperity and freedom, lured this people on 
to examine the authority of antiquated opinions 
and to break an ignominious chain. But the stern 
rod of despotism was held suspended over them; 
arbitrary power threatened to tear away the 
foundation of their happiness; the guardian of 
their laws became their tyrant. Simple in their 
stateeraft no less than in their manners, they 
dared to appeal to ancient treaties, and to remind 
the lord of both Indies of the right of nature. 
A name decides the whole issue of things. In 
Madrid that was called rebellion which in Brus- 
sels was simply styled a Jawful remonstrance. 
The complaints of Brabant required a prudent 
mediator, Philip II sent an executioner. The 
signal for war was given. An unparalleled tyr- 
anny assailed both property and life. The de- 
spairing citizens, to whom the choice of deaths 
was all that was left, chose the nobler one on 
the battle-field. A wealthy and luxurious nation 
loves peace, but becomes warlike as soon as it 
becomes poor. Then it ceases to tremble for a

  life which is deprived of everything that had 
made it desirable. In an instant, the contagion 
of rebellion seized at once the most distant prov- 
inces; trade and ecommerce are at a standstill, 
the ships disappear from the harbors, the artizan 
abandons his workshop, the rustie his uneul- 
tivated fields. Thousands fled to distant lands, 
a thousand victims fell on the bloody field, and 
fresh thousands prest on. Divine, indeed, must 
that doctrine be for which men could die so joy- 
fully. Ail that was wanting was the last finishing 
hand, the enlightened, enterprising spirit, to seize 
on this great political crisis, and to mold the 
offspring of chance into the ripe ereation of wis- 
dom. William the Silent, like a second Brutus, 
devoted himself to the great cause of liberty, 
Superior to all selfishness, he resigned honorable 
offices which entailed on him objectionable duties, 
and magnanimously divesting himself of all his 
princely dignities, he descended to a state of 
voluntary poverty, and became but a citizen of 
the world. . The cause of justice was staked upon 
the hazardous game of battle; but the newly 
raised levies of mercenaries and peaceful hus- 
bandmen were unable to withstand the terrible 
onset of an experienced force. Twice did the 
brave William lead his dispirited troops against 
the tyrant, twice was he abandoned by them, but 
not by his courage. 
Philip IT sent as many reenforcements as the 
dreadfal importunity of his viceroy demanded. 
Fugitives, whom their country rejected, sought 
a new home on the ocean, and turned to the ships 
of their enemy to satisfy the eravings both of 
vengeance and of want. Naval heroes were now

  formed out of corsairs, and a marine collected 
out of piratical vessels: out of morasses arose @& 
republic. Seven provinees threw off the yoke 
at the same time, to form a new, youthful state, 
powerful by its waters and its union and despair. 
A solemn decree of the whole nation deposed the 
tyrant, and the Spanish name was erased from 
all its laws. 
For such acts no forgiveness remained; the 
republic beeame formidable, only because it was 
impossible for her to retrace her steps. But fae- 
tions distracted her within; without, her terrible 
element, the sea itself, leaguing with her op-

premature grave. She felt herself succumb to 
the superior force of the enemy, and cast herself 
a suppliant before the most powerful thrones of 
Europe, begging them to accept a dominion which 
she herself could no longer protect. At last, but

Philip 11 missed the fruits of a deed which cost 
him his royal honor, and perhaps, also, his self- 
respect. Liberty struggled on still with des- 
potism, in obstinate and dubious contest; san- 
guinary battles were fought; a brilliant array of 
heroes sueceeded each other on the field of glory; 
and Flanders and Brabant were the schools which 
educated generals for the coming century. A 
long, devastating war laid waste the open coun- 
try; victor and vanquished alike waded through 
blood; while the rising republic cf the waters 
gave a weleome to fugitive industry, and out of 
the ruins of despotism erected the noble edifice of 
its own greatness. For forty years lasted the 
war whose happy termination was not to bless 
the dying eye of Philip; which destroyed one 
paradise in Europe, to form a new one out of 
its shattered fragments; which destroyed the 
choicest flower of military youth, and while it 
enriched more than a quarter of the globe, im- 
poverished the possessor of the golden Poru. This 
monarch, who could expend nine hundre:! tons of 
gold without oppressing his subjects, and by ty- 
rannical measure extorted far more, heaped more- 
over on his exhausted people a debt of one hun- 
dred and forty millions of ducats. An implacable 
hatred of liberty swallowed up all these treasures, 
and consumed on the fruitless task the labor of 
a royal life. But the Reformation throve amidst 
the devastations of the sword, and over the blood 
of her citizens the banner of the new republic 
floated victorious.

SHAKESPEARE’S MACBETH* 
Or ‘*Macbeth’’ I have already spoken once in 
passing; and who could exhaust the praises of 
this sublime work? Since the ‘‘Eumenides’’ of 
Z@sehylus nothing so grand and terrible has ever 
been written. The witches are not, it is true, 
divine Eumenides, and are not intended to be; 
they are ignoble and vulgar instruments of hell. 
A German poet, therefore, very ili understood 
their meaning when he transformed them into 
mongrel beings, a mixture of fates, furies, and 
enchantresses, and clothed them with tragic dig- 
nity. Let no man venture to lay hand on Shake- 
speare’s works hinking to improve anything es- 
sential: he will be sure to punish himself. The 
bad is radically odious, and to endeavor in any

manner to ennoble it, is to violate the laws of 
propriety. Hence, in my opinion, Dante, and 
even Tasso, have been much more successful in 
their portraiture of demons than Milton. 
Whether the age of Shakespeare still believed 
in ghosts and witches is a matter of perfect in- 
difference for the justification of the use which 
in ‘‘Hamlet’’ and ‘‘Macbeth’’ he has made of 
preexisting traditions. No superstition can be 
widely diffused without having a foundation in 
human nature: on this the poet builds; he calls 
up from their hidden abysses that dread of ‘the 
unknown, and presage of a dark side of nature, 
and a world of spirits, which philosophy now 
imagines it has altogether exploded. In this 
manner he is in some degree both the portrayer 
and the philosopher of superstition; that is, not 
the philosopher who denies and turns it into rid- 
ieule, but, what is still more diffieult, who dis- 
tinetly exhibits its origin in apparently irrational 
and yet natural opinions. But when he ventures 
to make arbitrary changes in these popular tradi- 
tions he altogether forfeits his right to them, 
and merely holds up his idle fancies to oar ridi- 
cule. Shakespeare’s picture of the witches is 
truly magical: in the short scenes where they 
enter he has created for them a peculiar lan- 
guage, which, altho composed of the usual ele- 
ments, still seems to be a collection of formule 
of incantation. The sound of the words, the 
accumulation of rimes, and the rhythm of the 
verse form, as it were, the hollow music of a 
dreary witch-dance. He has been abused for 
using the names of disgusting objects; but he

effective with agreeable aromatics is as wise as 
those who desire that hell should sincerely and 
honestly give good advice. These repulsive 
things, from which the imagination shrinks, are 
here emblems of the hostile powers which operate 
in nature; and the repugnance of our senses is 
outweighed by the mental horror. With one an- 
other the witches discourse like women of the 
very lowest class; for this was the class to which 
witches were ordinarily supposed to belong: 
when, however, they address Macbeth they as- 
sume a loftier tone: their predictions, which they 
either themselves pronounce, or allow their ap- 
paritions to deliver, have all the obseure brevity, 
the majestic solemnity, of oracles. 
We here see that the witches are merely instru- 
ments; they are governed by an invisible spirit, 
or the operation of such great and dreadful events 
would be above their sphere. With what intent 
did Shakespeare assign the same place to them 
in his play which they occupy in the history of 
Macbeth as related in the old chronicles? <A 
monstrous erime is committed: Duncan, a ven- 
erable old man, and the best of kings, is, in 
defenseless sleep, under the hospitable roof, mur- 
dered by his subject, whom he has loaded with 
honors and rewards. Natural motives alone seem 
imadequate, or the perpetrator must have been 
portrayed as a hardened villain. Shakespeare 
wished to exhibit a more sublime pieture—an 
ambitious but noble hero yielding to a deep-laid 
hellish temptation, and in whom all the erimes 
to which, in order to secure the fruits of his first 
erime, he is impelled by necessity, can not alto- 
gether eradicate the stamp of native heroism.

He has, therefore, given a threefold division to 
the guilt of that crime. The first idea comes 
from that being whose whole activity is guided 
by a lust of wickedness. 
The weird sisters surprize Macbeth in the mo- 
ment of intoxication of vietory, when his love 
of glory has been gratified; they cheat his eyes 
by exhibiting to him as the work of fate what 
n reality can be accomplished only by his own 
leed, and gain credence for all their words by 
he immediate fulfilment of the first prediction. 
Che opportunity of murdering the King imme- 
liately offers; the wife of Macbeth conjures him 
sot to let it slip; she urges him on with a fiery 
‘loquence which has at command all those soph- 
sms that serve to throw a false splendor over 
sxime. 
Little more than the mere execution falls to 
the share of Macbeth; he is driven into it, as it 
vere, in a tumult of fascination. Repentance 
mmediaiely follows, nay, even precedes, the deed, 
id the stings of conscience leave him rest neither‘ 
ight nor day. But he is now fairly entangled

ng anxiety to his earthly existence the more mis- 
srable it becomes, and pitilessly removing out of

seems to threaten danger. However much we 
nay abbor his actions, we can not altogether re- 
tase to compassionate the state of his mind; we

  admire the struggle of a brave will with a cow; 
ardly conscience. We might believe that we wit- 
ness in this tragedy the overruling destiny of. 
the ancients represented in perfect accordance 
with their ideas: the whole originates in a super-~ 
natural influence, to which the subsequent events 
seem inevitably linked. Moreover, we even find 
here the same ambiguous oracles which, by their 
literal fulfilment, deceive those who confide in 
them. 
Yet it may be easily shown that the poet has, 
in his work, displayed more enlightened views. 
He wishes to show that the conflict of good and 
evil in this world can only take place by the 
permission of Providence, which converts the 
eurse that individual mortals draw down on their 
heads into a blessing to others. An accurate 
seale is followed in the retaliation. . 
Lady Macbeth, who of all the human participa- 
tors in the King’s murder is the most guilty, .is 
thrown by the terrors of her conscience inte a 
state of incurable bodily and mental disease; - 
she dies, unlamented by her husband, with: all 
the symptoms of reprobation. Macbeth is still 
found worthy to die the death of a hero on the 
field of battle. The noble Macduff is allowed the 
satisfaction of saving his country by punishing 
with his own hand the tyrant who had murdered 
his wife and children. Banquo, by an early death, 
atones for the ambitious curiosity which prompt- 
ed the wish to know his glorious descendants, as. 
he thereby has roused Macheth’s jealousy; but 
he preserved his mind pure from the evil sug- 
gestions of the witches: his name is blest in his 
race, destined to enjoy for a long succession of

ages that royal dignity which Macbeth could only 
held for his own life. In the progress of the 
action, the piece is altogether the reverse of 
‘«Hamlet’’: it strides forward with amazing rap- 
idity, from the first catastrophe (for Dunean’s 
murder may be ealled a catastrophe) to the last. 
“‘Thought, and done!’’ is the general motto; for, 
as Macbeth says, 
‘‘The flighty purpose never is o’ertook 
Unless the deed go with it.’’ 
In every feature we see an energetic heroie 
age, in the hardy north which steels every nerve. 
The precise duration of the action can not be 
ascertained—years, perhaps, according to the 
story—but we know that tc the imagination the 
most crowded time appears always the shortest. 
Here we can hardly conceive how so very much 
could ever have been comprest into so narrow 
a space; not merely external events, the very 
inmost’ recesses of the minds of the dramatic 
personages are laid open to us. It is as if the 
drags were taken from the wheels of time and 
they roll along without interruption in their de- 
scent. Nothing can equal the picture in its power 
to excite terror. We need only allude to the 
circumstances attending the murder of Duncan, 
the dagger that hovers before the eyes of Mac- 
beth, the vision of Banquo at the feast, the mad- 
ness of Lady Macbeth: what can possibly be said 
on the subject that will not rather weaken the 
impression they naturally leave? Such scenes 
stand alone. and are to be found only in this 
poet; otherwise the tragic muse might exchange 
her mask for the head of Medusa.

I did not venture to trace a few of the most 
marked features of the human race, considered 
with reference to physical gradations—to the 
geographical distribution of contemporaneous 
types—to the influence exercised upon man by 
the forces of nature, and the reciprocal, altho 
weaker action which he, in his turn, exercises 
on these natural forces. Dependent, altho in a

forces by activity of mind and the advance. of 
intellectual cultivation no less than by his won- 
derful capacity of adapting himself to all climates 
—man everywhere becomes most. essentially as- 
sociated with terrestrial life. It is by these rela- 
tions that the obscure and much-contested prob- 
lem of the possibility of one common descent 
enters into the sphere embraced by a general 
physical, cosmography. The investigation of this 
problem will impart a nobler, and, if I may so 
express myself, more purely human interest to 
the closing pages of this section of my work. 
The Vast domain of language, in whose varied 
structure we see mysteriously reflected the des- 
tinies of nations, is most intimately associated 
with the affinity of races; arid what even slight 
differences of races may effect is strikingly man- 
ifested in the history of the Hellenie nations in 
the zenith of their intellectual cultivation. The 
most important questions of the civilization of 
mankind are connected with the ideas of races, 
community of language, and adherence to one 
original direction of the intellectual and moral 
faculties. 
As long as attention was directed solely to the 
extremes in varieties of color and-of form, and 
to the vividness of the first impression of the 
senses, the observer was naturally disposed to 
regard races rather as originally different species 
than as mere varieties. The permapence of cer- 
tain types in the midst of the most hostile in- 
fluences, especially of climate, appeared to favor 
such a view, notwithstanding the shortness of 
the interval of time from which the historical 
131
-P-A-G-E-144
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  evidence was derived. In my opinion 
more powerful reasons can be advanc 
port of the theory of the unity of ' 
race, as, for instance, in the many intermediate 
gradations in the color of the skin and in the 
form of the skull, which have been made known 
to us in recent times by the rapid progress of 
geographical knowledge—the analogies presented 
by the varieties in the species of many wild and 
domesticated animals—and the more eorrect obser- 
vations collected regarding the limits of fecundity 
in hybrids. The greater number of the contrasts 
which were formerly supposed to exist have dis- 
appeared before the laborious researches of Tiede- 
manp on the brain of negroes and of Europeans, 
and the anatomical investigations of Vrolik and 
Weber on the form of the pelvis. 
On comparing the dark-colored African na- 
tions, on whose physical history the admirable 
work of Prichard has thrown so much light, with 
the races inhabiting the islands of the South 
Indian and West Australian archipelago, and 
with the Papuas and Alfourous (Haroforas, En- 
damenes), we see that a black skin, woolly hair, 
and a negro-like cast of countenance are not 
necessarily connected together. So long as only 
a small portion of the earth was known to the 
Western nations, partial views necessarily pre- 
dominated, and tropical heat and a black skin 
eonsequently appeared inseparable. ‘‘The Ethi- 
opians,’’ said the ancient tragic poet Theodectes 
of Phaselis, ‘‘are colored by the near sun god 
in his course with a sooty luster, and their hair 
is dried and crisped with the heat of his rays.’’

  so many new ideas regarding physical geography, 
likewise first excited a discussion on the prob- 
lematical influence of climate on races. ‘‘Fam- 
ilies of animals and plants,’’ writes one of the 
greatest anatomists of the day, Johannes Miiller, 
in his noble and comprehensive work, ‘*Physio- 
logie des Menschen,’’ ‘‘undergo, within certain 
limitations peculiar to the different races and 
species, various modifications in their distribu- 
tion over the surface of the earth, propagating 
these variations as organic types of species, 
‘*The present races. of animals have been pro- 
duced by the combined aetion of many different 
internal as well as external conditions, the nature 
of which can not in all cases be defined, the most 
striking varieties being found in those families 
which are capable of the greatest distribution 
over the surface of the earth. The different races 
of mankind are forms of one sole species, by the 
union of two of whose members descendants are 
propagated. They are not different species of a 
genus, since in that case their hybrid descendants 
would remain unfruitful. But whether the hu- 
man races have descended from several primitive 
races of men, or from one alone, is a question 
that ean not be determined from experience.’’ 
Geographical investigations regarding the an- 
eient seat, the so-called cradle of the human race, 
are not devoid of a mythical character. ‘‘We 
do not know,’’ says Wilhelm von Humboldt, in 
an unpublished work, ‘‘On the Varieties of Lan- 
guages and Nations,’’ ‘‘either from history or 
from authentic tradition, any period of time in 
which the human race has not been divided into 
social groups. Whether the gregarious condition 
133
-P-A-G-E-146
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  was original, or of subsequent occurrence, we 
have no historic evidence to show. The separate 
mythical relations found to exist independently 
of one another in different parts of the earth 
appear to refute the first hypothesis, and concur 
in ascribing the generation of the whole human 
race to the union of one pair. The general prev- 
alence of this myth has eaused it to be regarded 
as a traditionary record transmitted from primi- 
tive man to his descendants. But this very cir- 
cumstance seems rather to prove that it has no 
historical foundation, but has simply arisen from 
an identity in the mode of intellectual conception, 
which has everywhere led man to adopt the same 
conclusion regarding identical phenomena; in the 
same manner as many myths have doubtless 
arisen, not from any historical connection existing 
between them, but rather from an identity in 
human thought and imagination. 
* Another evidence in favor of the purely myth- 
ical nature of this belief is afforded by the fact 
that the first origin of mankind—a phenomenon 
which is wholly beyond the sphere of experience — 
is explained in perfect conformity with existing 
views, being considered on the principle of the 
colonization of some desert island or’ remote 
mountainous valley at a period when mankind 
had already existed for thousands of years. It 
is in vain that we direct our thoughts to the 
solution of the great problem of the first origin, 
since man is too intimately associated with his 
own race and with the relations of time to con- 
ceive of the existence of an individual inde- 
pendently of a preceding generation and age. 
A solution of those difficult questions, which 
134
-P-A-G-E-147
  ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT 
  ean not be determined by inductive reasoning 
or by experience—whether the belief in this pre- 
sumed traditional condition be actually based on 
historical evidence, or whether ‘mankind inhab- 
ited the earth in gregarious associations from the 
origin of the race—can not, therefore, be deter- 
mined from philological data, and yet its elucida- 
tion ought not to be sought from other sources.’ 
The distribution of mankind is, therefore, only 
a distribution into varieties, wkich are commonly 
designated by the somewhat indefinite term races. 
As in the vegetable kingdom, and in the natural 
history of birds and fishes, a classification into 
many small families is based on a surer founda- 
tion than where large sections are separated into 
a few but large divisions, so it also appears to 
me that in the determination of races a prefer- 
ence should be given to the establishment of 
small families of nations. Whether we adopt the 
old classification of my master, Blumenbach, and 
admit. five races (the Caucasian, Mongolian, 
American, Ethiopian, and Malayan), or that of 
Prichard, into seven races (the Iranian, Turanian, 
American, Hottentots and Bushmen, Negroes, 
Papuas, and Alfourous), we fail to recognize any 
typical sharpness of definition, or any general 
or well-established principle in the division of 
these groups. The extremes of form and color 
are certainly separated, but without regard to 
the races, which can not be included in any of 
these classes, and which have been alternately 
termed Scythian and Allophyllic. Iranian is cer- 
tainly 2 less objectionable term for the European 
nations than Caucasian; but it may be maintained 
generally that geographical denominations are 
135
-P-A-G-E-148
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  
very vague when used to express the points of 
departure of races, more especially where the 
country which has given its name to the race, 
as, for instance, Turan (Mawerannahr), has been 
inhabited at different periods by Indo-Germanic 
and Finnish, and not by Mongolian tribes. 
Languages, as intellectual creations of man, 
and as closely interwoven with the development 
of mind, are, independently of the national form 
which they exhibit, of the greatest importance 
in the recognition of similarities or differences in 
races. This importance is especially owing to 
the elue which a community of descent affords 
. in treading that mysterious labyrinth in which 
the connection of physical powers and intelec- 
tual forces manifests itself in a thousand dif- 
ferent forms. The brilliant progress. made within 
the last half-century, in Germany, in philesoph- 
ical philology, has greatly facilitated our inves- 
tigations into the national character of languages 
and the influence exercised by descent. But here, 
as in all domains of ideal speculation, the dangers 
of deception are closely linked to the rich and 
certain profit to be derived. 
Positive ethnographical studies, based on a thor- 
ough knowledge of history, teach us that much 
eaution should be applied in entering into these 
comparisons of nations, and of the languages 
employed by them at certain epochs. Subjection, 
long association, the influence of a foreign relig- 
ion, the blending of races, even when only in- 
eluding a small number of the more influential 
and. cultivated of the immigrating tribes, have 
produced, in both eontinents, similarly recurring 
phenomena; as, for instance, in introducing total-

  ly different families of languages among one and 
the same race, and idioms, having one common 
root, among nations of the most different origin. 
Great Asiatic conquerors have exercised the most 
powerful influence on phenomena of this kind. 
But language is a-part and parcel of the history 
of the development of mind; and, however hap- 
pily the human intellect, under the most dissimilar 
Enysical conditions, may unfettered pursue a self- 
chosen track, and strive to free itself from the 
dominion of ‘terrestrial influences, this emancipa- 
tion is never perfect. There ever remains, in the 
natural capacities of the mind, a trace of some- 
thing that has been derived from the influences 
of race or of climate, whether they be associated 
with a land gladdened by cloudless azure skies, 
or with the vapory atmosphere of an insular 
region. As, therefore, richness and grace of lan- 
guage are unfolded from the most luxuriant 
depths of thought, we have been unwilling wholly 
to disregard the bond whieh so closely links to- 
gether the physical world with the sphere of intel- 
lect and of the feelings by depriving this general 
pieture of nature of those brighter lights and 
tints which may be borrowed from considerations, 
however slightly indicated, of the relations ex- 
isting between races and languages. . 
Let me close this general description of the 
natural phenomena of the universe. From the 
remotest nebulw and from the revolving double 
stars, we have descended to the minutest organ- 
isms of animal creation, whether manifested in 
the depths of ocean or on the surface of our 
globe, ond to the delicate vegetable germs which

to arrange these phenomena according to par- 
tially known laws; but other laws of a more 
mysterious nature rule the higher spheres of the 
organic world in which is comprized the human 
species in all its varied conformation, its creative 
intellectual power, and the languages to which it 
has given existence. <A physical delineation of 
nature terminates at the point where the sphere 
of intellect begins, and a new world of mind 
is open to our view. It marks the limit, but does

nodded to me with tender sensibility, the roses 
with wine-flushed cheeks laughed a weleome from 
afar, the night-stocks sighed—with myrtles and 
laurels I was not then acquainted, for they had 
no bright blossoms to attract me, but with mig- 
nonette (we have since quarreled) I was then on 
the most intimate terms. I am speaking of the 
palace gardens at Diisseldorf, where I used to lie 
on the grass reverently listening to Monsieur Le 
Grand as he told me of the great Emperor’s 
heroism, and beat the marches to which those 
heroic exploits were performed, so that my eyes 
and ears drank in the very life of it all. I saw 
the march across the Simplon—the Emperor in 
front and the brave grenadiers climbing up be- 
hind, while the startled eagles screamed and the 
glaciers thundered in the distance; I saw the 
Emperor clasping the standard on the bridge of 
Lodi; I saw the Emperor in his gray cloak at 
Marengo; I saw the Emperor on horseback at 
the battle of the Pyramids—nothing but smoke 
and Mamelukes—I saw the Emperor at Auster- 
litz—twing! how the bullets whizzed over the 
smooth ice—I saw, I heard the battle of Jena— 
dum, dum, dum—I saw, I heard the battle of 
Hilau, of Wagram—no, I could hardly stand it! 
Monsieur Le Grand drummed till my own ear- 
drum was nearly cracked. 
But what were my feelings when I saw him 
at last with my own eyes—O beatific vision !— 
himself, the Emperor. 
It was in the alley of the same palace gardens 
at Diisseldorf. As I shouldered my way through 
140

the gaping crowd I thought of the deeds and 
battles which Monsieur Le Grand had portrayed 
to me with his drum; my heart beat the grand 
march—and yet I thought at the same time of the 
police regulations which ordered that no one 
should ride through the alley under a penalty of 
five thalers. And the Emperor with his retinue 
rode right through the alley! The shuddering 
trees bowed down to him as he passed; the sun- 
beams peeped timidly through the green foliage, 
and in the blue heavens above there sailed in 
sight a golden star. He wore his plain green 
uniform, and his small world-famous eap. He 
rode a white palfrey, which stept with such calm 
pride, such assurance and dignity—had I been 
the Crown Prince of Prussia, I should still have 
envied that pony. Carelessly, with a loose seat, 
the Emperor held up the reins in one hand, and 
with the other patted good-temperedly his horse’s 
neck. It was a sunlit marble hand, a mighty 
hand, one of those two hands that had tamed 
the hydra of anarchy, and quelled the feud of 
nations; and now it patted good-temperedly his 
horse’s neck. His face, too, was of the same 
hue that we see in marble busts of Greeks and 
Romans; the features wore the same expression 
of calm dignity that the ancients have, and on 
it was written, ‘‘Thou shalt have none other gods 
but me.’’ A smile that warmed and calmed every 
heart played about his lips, and yet we know 
that those lips had only to whistle and—‘la 
Prusse n’existait plus’’; those lips had only to 
whistle, and elericalism died like an echo; those 
lips had only to whistle to set dancing the Holy 
Roman Empire. And now those lips smiled, and

  his eye smiled—an ¢ye clear as heaven, an eye 
that read men’s hearts, an eye that at a glanee 
embraced all earthly things, while we mortals 
see them only one by one, and only the painted 
shadows. The brow was not so clear; it was 
haunted by the ghosts of coming battles, and at 
times a frown passed across it; these frowns 
were the creative thoughts, seven-league-boot 
thoughts, with which the Emperor’s mind strode 
invisible over the world—and I fancy. each of 
these thoughts would have furnished a German 
writer with materials to employ his whole life. 
The Emperor rode calmly down the alley; no 
policeman stopt his way; behind him, on snorting 
chargers, bedizened with gold and jewels, rode 
his retinue; the drums beat, the trumpets blared ; 
at my side mad Aloysius spun round and round, 
and clattered out the names of his generals; 
close by drunken. Gumpertz bellowed, and the 
people shouted with a thousand voices, ‘‘Long 
live the Emperor!’’ 
The Emperor is dead. On a desolate island 
in the Atlantie is his lonely grave, and he for 
whom the earth was all too narrow rests peace- 
fully beneath the hillock where five weeping wil- 
lows droop their green tresses in agonized de- 
spair, and a tender-hearted rivulet ripples by 
with melancholy plaint. There is no inseription 
on the tombstone, but Clio has graven thereon, 
in invisible letters, her just sentence that will 
echo through the centuries like spirit voices.

extremely corrupt state. Written as it was about 250 years 
before the invention of printing, innumerable copies in manu- 
script form were put into circulation, some in French, some 
in Italian, some in German and some in Latin. French is

eighty copies in manuscript are still extant. A Latin version

we are to attribute the extraordinary richness 
of the sovereign’s palace, according to what we 
are told by those who have access to the place. 
The entire roof is covered with a plating of gold, 
- in the same manner as we cover houses, or more 
properly churches, with lead. The ceilings of 
the halls are of the same precious metal; many 
of the apartments have sma}! tables of pure gold, 
of considerable thickness; and the windows have 
also golden ornaments. So vast, indeed, are the 
riches of the palace that it is impossible to eon- 
vey an idea of them. In this island there are 
pearls also, in large quantities, of a red (pink) 
color, round in shape, and of great size, equal 
in value to, or even exceeding that of the white 
pearls. It is customary with one part of the 
inhabitants to bury their dead, and with another 
part to burn them. The former have a practise 
of putting one of these pearls into the mouth 
of the corpse. There are also found there a 
number of precious stones. 
Of so great celebrity was the wealth of. this 
island that a desire was excited in the breast of 
the grand Khan Kublai, now reigning, to make 
the conquest of it and to annex it to his do- 
minions. In order to effect this he fitted out a 
numerous fleet, and embarked a large body of 
troops, under the command of two of his prin- 
cipal officers, one of whom was named Abbaeatan,

  and the other Vonsaucin. The expedition sailed 
from the ports of Zai-tun and Kin-sai’ [probably 
Amoy and Ningpo], and, crossing the interme- 
diate sea, reached the island in safety; but in 
consequence of a jealousy that arose between 
the two commanders, one of whom treated the 
plans of the other with contempt and resisted 
the execution of his orders, they were unable to 
gain possession of any city or fortified place, 
with the exception of one only, which was car- 
ried by assault, the garrison having refused to 
surrender. Directions were given for putting 
the whole to the sword, and in obedience thereto 
the heads of all were cut off, excepting of eight 
persons, who, by the efficacy of a diabolical 
eharm, consisting of a jewel or amulet introduced 
into the right arm between the skin and the 
flesh, were rendered secure from the effects of 
iron, either to kill or to wound. Upon this dis- 
covery being made, they were beaten with a 
heavy wooden club, and presently died. 
It happened, after some time, that a north: 
wind began to blow with great force, and the 
ships of the Tatars which lay near the shore 
of the island were driven foul of each other. 
It was determined, therefore, in a council of the 
officers on board, that they ought to disengage 
themselves from the land; and accordingly, as 
soon as the troops were reembarked, they stood 
out to sea. The gale, however, increased to so 
violent a degree that a number of the vessels 
foundered. The people belonging to them, by 
floating on pieces of the wreck, saved themselves 
upon an island lying about four miles from the 
coast of Zipangu. The other shins, which, not,

    being so near to the land, did not suffer from| 
the storm, and in which the two chiefs were 
embarked, together with the principal officers, 
or those whose rank entitled them to command al 
hundred thousand or ten thousand men, directed 
their course homeward, and returned to the grand 
khan. Those of the Tatars who remained upon the 
island where they were wrecked, and who amounted 
to about thirty thousand men, finding themselves 
left without shipping, abandoned by their leaders, 
and having neither arms nor provisions, expected 
nothing less than to become eaptives or to perish ; 
especially as the island afforded no habitations 
where they could take shelter and refresh them- 
selves. As soon as the gale ceased, and the sea 
became smooth and calm, the people from the 
main island of Zipangu came over with a large 
foree, in numerous boats, in order to make pris- 
oners of these shipwrecked Tatars and, having 
landed, proceeded in search of them, but in a 
straggling, disorderly manner. The Tatars, on 
their part, acted with prudent cireumspection, 
_ and being concealed from view by some high 
land in the center of the island, while the enemy 
were hurrying in pursuit of them by one road, 
made a circuit of the coast by another, which 
brought them to the place where the fleet of boats 
was at anchor. Finding these all abandoned, 
but with their colors flying, they instantly seized 
them, and pushing off from the island, stood for 
the principal city of Zipangu, into which, from 
the appearance of the colors, they were suffered 
to enter unmolested. Here they found few of 
the inhabitants, besides women, whom they re- 
tained for their own use, and drove out all others.

  When the King was apprized of what had taken — 
place, he was much afflicted, and immediately 
gave directions for a strict blockade of the city, 
which was so effectual that not one person was 
permitted to enter or to eseape from it during 
six months that the siege continued. At the 
expiration of this time, the Tatars, despairing 
of succor, surrendered upon the condition of their 
lives being spared. These events took place in 
the course of the year 1264 [properly 1284]. The 
grand khan, having learned some years after that 
the unfortunate issue of the expedition was to 
be attributed to the dissensions between the two 
eommanders, caused the head of one of them 
to be eut off, and the other be sent to the savage 
island of Zorza, where it is the custom to exeeute 
criminals in the following manner. They are 
wrapt round both arms in the hide of a buffalo

Havine confuted the errors of others in so far 
as they related to riches themselves we have to 
confute those on the subject of time as a eause 
of nobility, in that part where it is defined as 
ancient riches, and this is done in the part that 
begins, ‘‘Nor will they admit that a man lowly 
born a noble can beeome.’’? And in the first 
place, this is refuted by an argument taken from 
the very people who are so mistaken; then to

written in his maturity, but was not completed. Dante's 
purpose appears to have been to produce a sort of hand-book, 
or commentary, on universal knowledge.

  ment, is destroyed; and this is done where it 
says, ‘‘And thus it comes from what I have said 
before.’’ Finally it sums up—their error being 
evident, and it being, therefore, time to learn 
the truth—and this it does where it says, ‘‘Be- 
eause to the healthy mind,’’ ete. . 
- Tsay then, ‘‘Nor will they admit that a man 
lowly born a noble can become.’’ Here we must 
observe that it is the opinion of these mistaken 
ones that a man originally a peasant can never 
be called a nobleman, and a man who is the 
son of a peasant can likewise never be called 
noble. And here they contradict their own state- 
ment when they say that time is required for 
nobility, by putting in this word ancient (riches) ; 
beeause it is impossible by a process of time to 
arrive at the generation of nobility; by the rea- 
son of theirs here given, which denies that a man 
of low birth ean become noble by anything he 
may do or by any accident; and denies the pos- 
sibility of a change from a low-born father to 
a noble son. For if the son of a peasant be 
still a peasant his son also will be a peasant, and 
thus we can never find a point at which nobility 
ean begin by process of time. 
And if our opponent, wishing to defend him- 
self, shall say that nobility begins at the moment 
when the low estate of our ancestors is forgotten, 
I answer that this tells against himself, because 
there must necessarily be a change here from 
the low estate to the noble, from one man to 
another, as from father to son, which is contrary 
to what they assert. 
And if our opponent defends himself pertina- 
ciously, saying that he maintains that the change 
153
-P-A-G-E-166
THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  may take place when the low estate of jone’s 
ancestors has fallen into oblivion, then altho the 
text takes no notice of this, it is fitting thatthe 
commentary should reply to it. And therefore 
I answer thus: that from what they say. four 
great difficulties would follow, so that theirs can 
not be a good reason. 
The first is that the better human nature might 
be the more difficult and the more tardy would 
be the generation of nobility, which is a great 
difficulty; since the better a thing is the more 
it is honored and the more good it causes; and 
nobility would be commemorated among the good 
things. And that this would be so is proved; 
for if rank or rather nobility (which is under- 
stood to be the same thing) is generated by ob- 
livion, then the sooner men are forgotten. the 
quicker is their nobility generated, for so much 
the sooner would nobility come for all. There- 
fore, the sooner men were forgotten, the sooner 
they would be ennobled, and, on the contrary, 
the better the memory of them the more tardy 
would be their nobility. 
The second difficulty is that in no case except 
man’s could such a distinction be made, that is, 
between noble and vile, which is a great difficulty. 
For in every kind of thing we see an appearanee 
of nobility or of vileness, whence we often call 
one horse noble and one vile, or one falcon noble 
and one vile, or one pearl noble and one vile. 
And that this distinction could not be made ‘is 
proved thus: If the forgetting of ignoble ances- 
tors is a cause of nobility, where the ancestors 
never were ignoble there could be no oblivion, 
since oblivion is the destruction of memory. And 
154
-P-A-G-E-167
nee 
DANTE ALIGHIERI 
a NY 
in the said animals and plants and minerals de- 
grees of higher and lower are not noted, because 
they spring from one nature and are of equal 
condition, and in their generation there ean be 
nothing of nobility or the reverse, seeing that 
both extremes must be regarded as a possession 
or privation possible to the same subject; and, 
therefore, in them no such distinction can exist. 
And if our opponent were to say that in other 
things nobility is understood to be the goodness 
therefore, but in man is understood as the for- 
getfulness of his low estate, one would like to 
answer not with words but with the knife to 
such stupidity as would give goodness to the cause 
of nobility in other things, but-in man forgetful- 
ness as its origin. 
The third difficulty is that those generated 
would often come before the generation, which 
is quite impossible; and this may be demonstrated 
thus: 
Let us suppose that Gherardo de Cammino was 
a grandson of the lowest peasant that ever drank 
of Sile or Cagnano, and that his grandfather 
were not yet buried in oblivion; who would dare 
to say that Gherardo de Cammino was not noble? 
And who would not agree with me in saying that 
he was noble? Certainly none, however presump- 
tuous they may wish to be, because he was noble 
and such will his memory ever be. And if his 
ignoble ancestors had not been utterly forgotten 
(as our opponent asserts) and he had become 
noble and his nobility were as evident as we see 
it to be, then it would have existed in him before 
its generation had existed, and this is perfectly 
impossible. . 
155
-P-A-G-E-168
  nt 
THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  The fourth difficulty is that sueh a man (as 
this supposed ancestor) would be considered no- 
ble, being dead, who was not noble when living; 
and a more impossible thing there could not be 
as may be demonstrated thus: 
Let us suppose that in the age of Dardanus 
there ‘remained a memory of his low-born ances- 
tors, and let us suppose that in the age of Lao- 
medon this memory had died out and oblivion 
taken its place. According to our opponent’s 
opinion, Laomedon was noble, and Dardanus ig- 
. noble during life. Should we, to whom the mem- 
ory of their ancestors (I mean beyond Dardanus) 
has not come down, should we say that Dardanus 
while alive was a common peasant, and dead 
pbeeame noble? And this is not contradicted by 
the story that he was the son of Jupiter (for 
this is a fable, of which, in a philosophical dis- 
eussion, we should take no heed); and yet if our 
opponent should wish to fall back on the fable, 
certainly that which is covered by the fable 
would upset all his arguments. 
And thus it is manifest that the argument of 
which who would make oblivion the eause of no- 
bility is false and erroneous.

OF BEATRICE AND HER DEATH?’ 
Nive times now, since my birth, the heaven of 
light had turned almost to the same point in its 
own gyration, when the glorious lady of my 
mind, who was called Beatrice by many who 
knew not why she was so ealled, first appeared 
before my eyes. She had already been in this 
life so long that in its course the starry heaven 
had moved toward the region of the East one of 
the twelve parts of a degree; so that at about 
the beginning of her ninth year she appeared 
to me, and I near the end of my ninth year saw 
her. She appeared to me clothed in a most noble 
color, a modest and becoming crimson, and she 
was girt and adorned in such wise as befitted 
her very youthful age. 
From that time forward Love lorded it. over 
my soul, which had been so speedily wedded to 
him:. and he began to exercise over me such 
eontrol and such lordship, through the power 
which my imagination gave to him, that it be- 
heoved me to do completely all his pleasure. He 
commanded me ofttimes that I should seek to see 
this youthful angel; so that I in my boyhood 
often went seeking her, and saw her of such 
noble and praiseworthy deportment that truly of 
her might be said that word of the poet Homer, 
From “The New Life.” Translated by Charles Eliot Nor- 
ton, Copyright, 1867, 1892, 1895, by Houghton Mifflin 
Company. 
157
-P-A-G-E-170
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  ‘She seems not the daughter of mortal man, but 
of God.’’? And tho her image, which stayed con- 
stantly with me, gave assurance to Love to hold 
lordship over me, yet it was of such noble virtue 
that it never suffered Love to rule me without 
the faithful counsel of the reason in those mat- 
ters in which it was useful to hear such counsel. 
And since to dwell upon the passions and actions 
of such early youth seems like telling an idle 
tale, I will leave them, and, passing over many 
things which might be drawn from the original 
where these lie hidden, I will come to those words 
which are written in my memory under larger 
paragraphs. 
When so many days had passed that nine years 
were exactly complete since the above-described 
apparition of this most gentle lady, on the last 
of these days it happened that this admirable 
lady appeared to me, clothed in purest white, 
between two gentle ladies, who were of greater 
age; and, passing along a street, she turned her 
eyes toward that place where I stood very tim- 
idly, and by her ineffable courtesy, which is to- 
day rewarded in the eternal world, saluted me 
with such virtue that it seemed to be then that 
I saw all the bounds of bliss. . . . And since 
it was the first time that her words came to 
my ears, I took in such sweetness that, as it 
were, intoxicated, I turned away from the folk, 
and betaking myself to the solitude of my own 
chamber, I sat myself down to think of this 
most courteous lady. 
Then it came to pass that, walking on a road 
alongside of which was flowing a very clear 
stream, 80 great a desire to say somewhat in verse 
158
-P-A-G-E-171
  DANTE ALIGHIERI 
  came upon me, that I began to consider the 
method I should observe; and I thought that to 
speak of her would not be becoming unless I 
were to speak to ladies in the second person; 
and not to every lady, but only to those who 
are gentle, and are not women merely. Then 
I say that my tongue spoke as if moved of its 
own accord, and said, Ladies that have the intel- 
ligence of Love. These words I laid up in my 
mind with great joy, thinking to take them for 
my beginning; wherefore then, having returned 
to the above-mentioned city, after some days of 
thought, I began a canzone with this beginning. 
This most gentle lady came into such. favor 
among the people that when she passed along 
the way, persons ran to see her; which gave me 
wonderful joy. And when she was near any one, 
such modesty came into his heart that he dared 
not raise his eyes, or return her salutation; and 
of this many, as having experienced it, could 
bear witness for me to whoso might not believe - 
it. She, crowned and clothed with humility, took 
her way, showing no pride in that which she 
saw and heard. Many said, when she had passed: 
“This is not a woman; rather she is one of the 
most beautiful angels of heaven.’’ And others 
said: ‘‘She is a marvel. Blest be the Lord who 
can work thus admirably!’’ I say that she 
showed herself so gentle and so full of all pleas- 
antness that those who looked on her compre- 
hended in themselves a pure and sweet delight, 
such ag they could not after tell in words; nor 
was there any who might look upon her but that 
at first he needs must sigh. These and more 
admirable things proceeded from her admirably

  and with power.. .Wherefore I, thinking upon 
this, desiring to resume the style of her praise, 
resolved to say words in which I would set forth 
her admirable and excellent influences, to the 
end that not only those who might actually be- 
hold her, but also others should know of her 
whatever words could tell. . . . 
I was yet fnll of the design of this eanzone, 
and had completed [one] stanza thereof, when 
the Lord of Justice called this most gentle one 
to glory, under the banner of that holy Queen 
Mary, whose name was ever spoken with greatest 
reverence by this blest Beatrice. 
On that day on which the year was complete 
since this lady was made one of the denizens of 
life eternal, I was seated in a place where, having 
her in mind, I was drawing an angel upon certain 
tablets. And while I was drawing it, I turned 
my eyes and saw at my side men to whom it 
was meet to do honor. They were looking on 
what I did, and, as was afterward toid me, they 
had been there already some time before I became 
aware of it. When I saw them I rose, and salu- 
ting them, said, ‘‘ Another was just now with me, 
and on that account I was in thought.’? And 
when they had gone away, I returned to my 
work, namely, that of drawing figures of angels; 
and while doing this, a thought came to me of 
saying words in rime, as if for an anniversary 
poem of her, and of addressing those persons 
who had come to me. 
After this, two gentle ladies sent to ask me 
to send them some cf these rimed words of mine; 
wherefore I, thinking on their nobleness, resolved 
to send to them and to make a new thing which 
160

SS 
I would send to them with these, in order that 
I might fulfil their prayers with the more honor. 
And I devised then a sonnet which relates my 
condition, and I sent it to them. 
After this a wonderful vision appeared to me, 
in which I saw things which made me resolve 
to speak no more of the blest one, until I could 
more wortbily treat of her. And to attain to 
this, I study to the utmost of my power, as she 
truly knows. So that, if it shall please Him 
through whom all things live that my life be 
prolonged for some years, I hope to say of her 
what was never said of any woman. 
And then may it please Him who is the Lord 
of Grace, that my soul may go to behold the 
glory of its lady, namely of that blest Beatrice, 
who in glory looks upon the face of Him qui 
est per omnia secula bénedictus [who is blest 
forever].

OF GOOD AND EVIL FORTUNE* 
Wuen I consider the instability of human 
affairs and the variations of fortune, I find noth- 
ing more uncertain or restless than the life of 
man. Nature has given to animals an excellent 
remedy under disasters, which is the ignorance 
of them. We seem better treated in intelligence, 
foresight, and memory. No doubt these are ad- 
mirable presents; but they often annoy more than 
they assist us. A prey to unuseful or distressing 
cares, we are tormented by the present, the 
past, and the future; and, as if we feared we 
should not be miserable enough, we join to the 
evil we suffer the remembrance of a former dis- 
tress and the apprehension of some frtrre a> 
+¥rom the “Treatise on the Remedies of Go 
Fortune.” An English translation of this wor

  lamity. This is the Cerberus with three heads 
we combat without ceasing. Our life might be 
gay and happy if we would; but we eagerly seek 
subjects of affliction to render it irksome end 
melancholy. We pass the first years of this life 
in the shades of ignorance, the succeeding ones 
in pain and labor, the latter part in grief and 
remorse, and the whole in error; nor do we suffer 
ourselves to possess one bright day without a 
cloud. . , 
Let us examine this matter with sineerity, and 
we shall agree that our distresses chiefly arise 
from ourselves. Jt is virtue alone which can 
render us superior to Fortune; we quit her stand- 
ard, and the combat is no longer equal. Fortune 
mocks us; she turns us on her wheel: she raises 
and abases us at her pleasure, but her power 
is founded on our weakness. This is an old- 
rooted evil, but it is not ineurable: there is noth- 
ing a firm and elevated mind can not accomplish. 
The discourse of the wise and the study of good 
books are the best remedies I know of; but to 
these we must join the consent of the soul, with- 
out which the best advice will be useless. What 
gratitude do we not owe to those great men 
who, tho dead many ages before us, live with 
us by their works, diseourse with us, are our 
masters and guides,-and serve us as pilots in 
the navigation of life, where our vessel is agitated 
without ceasing by the storms of our passions! 
It is here that true philosophy brings us to a 
safe port, by a sure and easy passage; not like 
that of the schools, which, raising us on its airy 
and deceitful wings, and causing us to hover on 
the clouds of frivolous dispute, let us fall without

  not discourse on these with my dear Azon? I 
would prepare for you, as in a little portable 
box, a friendly antidote against the poison of 
good and bad fortune. The one requires a rein 
to repress the sallies of a transported soul; the 
other a consolation to fortify the overwhelmed 
and afflicted spirit. 
Nature gave you, my friend, the heart of a 
king, but she gave you not a kingdom, of which 
therefore Fortune could not deprive you. But 
I doubt whether our ages can furnish an example 
of worse or better treatment from her than your- 
self. In the first part of your life you were 
blest with an admirable constitution and aston- 
ishing health and vigor: some years after we 
beheld you thrice abandoned by the physicians, 
who despaired of your life. The heavenly Phy- 
sician, who was your sole resource, restored your 
health, but not your former strength. You were 
then ealled iron-footed, for your singular force 
and agility; you are now bent, and lean upon 
the shoulders of those whom you formerly sup- 
ported. Your country beheld you one day its 
governor, the next an exile. Princes disputed 
for your friendship, and afterward conspired 
your ruin. You lost by death the greatest part 
of your friends; the rest, according to custom, 
deserted you in calamity. To these misfortunes 
was added a violent disease, which attacked you 
when destitute of all succors, al a distance from 
your country and family, in a strange land, in- 
vested by the troops of your enemies; so that 
those two or three friends whom fortune had 
left you could not come near to relieve you. In 
a word, you have experienced every hardship but 
165
-P-A-G-E-178

  imprisonment and death. But what do I say? 
You have felt all the horrors of the former, when 
your faithful wife and children ‘were shut up 
by your enemies; and even death followed you, 
and took one of those children, for whose life 
you would willingly have sacrificed your own. 
In you have been united the fortunes of Pom- 
pey and Marius; but you were neither arrogant 
im prosperity as the one, nor discouraged in 
adversity as the other. You have supported both 
in a manner that has made you loved by your 
friends and admired by your enemies. - There is 
a peculiar charm in the serene and tranquil air 
of virtue, which enlightens all around it, in the 
midst of the darkest scenes and the greatest 
calamities. My ancient friendship for you has 
caused me to quit everything for you to perform 
a work, in which, as in a glass, you may adjust 
and prepare your soul for all events; and be 
able to say, as Aineas did to the Sibyl, ‘‘Nothing 
of this is new to me; I have foreseen, and am 
prepared for it all.’? I am sensible that, in the 
disorders of the mind, as well as those of the 
body, discourses are not thought the most effica- 
cious remedies; but I am persuaded also that the 
malady of the soul ought to be eured by spiritual 
application. 
If we see a friend in distress, and give him 
all the consolation we are able, we perform the 
duties of friendship, which pays more attention 
to the disposition of the heart than the value of 
the gift. A small present may be the testimony 
of a great love. There is no good I do not wish 
you, and this is all I ean offer toward it. I wish 
this little treatise may be of use to you.

GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO 
Born in Italy probably in 1818, died in 1375; lived in 
Florence in his youth; settled at Naples in 1330; returned 
to Florence about 1341, where he lectured on Dante; several 
times sent abroad as ambassador; his chief work the “De- 
cameron,” comprising one hundred stories published collect- 
ively in 1353; wrote many other works of fiction and his- 
tory, some being in Latin. 
THE PATIENT GRISELDA* 
He [the Marquis of Saluzzo] had taken a 
faney, some time before, to the behavior of a 
poor country girl, who lived in a villdge not 
far from his palace; and thinking he might live 
eomfortably enough with her, he determined, 
*Qhis, the most famous of Boccaccio’s stories, is the last 
of those related on the tenth day. Lowndes’s “Manual” 
mentions under Boccaccio “the Booke called de John Bochas, 
descriving the Falle of Princis and Princessis and Other 
Nobles, traglated into Englisshe by John Lydgate, Folio, Lon- 
don, 1494.” ‘Another early translation appeared in 1560, 
but this appears to have contained parts only of the ‘‘De- 
cameron.” An edition issued in 1620-25 is called by Lown- 
des “the first English translation,” by which apparently is 
meant the first complete one, A translation by E. Dubois 
was issued in 1806. Boccaccio’s Tales were known in Eng- 
Jand before the invention of printing. Chaucer, who made 
‘use of the story of Griselda, has told as follows how he first 
obtained it from Petrarch in Padua.

  without seeking any further, to marry her. . . 
The people all declared themselves pleased, and 
promised to regard her in all things as their 
mistress. Afterward they made preparations for 
a most noble feast, and the like did the prince, 
inviting all his relations, and the great lords in 
all parts and provinces about him; he had also 
most rich and costly robes made, shaped by a 
person that seemed to be of the same size with 
his intended sponse; and provided a girdle, ring, 
and fine coronet, with everything requisite for 
a bride. And when the day appointed was come, 
about the third hour he mounted his horse, at- 
tended by all his friends and vassals, and, having 
everything in readiness, he said, ‘‘My lords and 
gentlemen, it is now time to go for my new 
spouse.’” 
So on they rode to the village, and when he 
was come near the father’s house he saw her 
carrying some water from the well, in great 
haste to go afterward with some of her acquaint- 
ances to see the new marchioness; when he called 
her by her name, which was Griselda, and in- 
quired where her father was. She modestly re- 
plied, ‘‘My gracious lord, be is in the house.’’ 
He then alighted from his horse, commanding 
them all to wait for him, and went alone into 
the ecttage, where he found the father, who. was 
ealled Giannucolo, and said to him, ‘‘Honest man, 
I am come to espouse thy daughter, but would 
first ask her some questions before thee.’? He 
then inquired whether she would make it her 
study to please him, and not be uneasy at any 
time, whatever he should do or say; and whether 
she would always be obedient; with more to that 
168
-P-A-G-E-181
  GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO 
  purpose. To which she answered, ‘‘Yes.’? He 
then led her out by the hand, and, ordering the 
rich apparel to be brought which he had provided, 
he had her clothed completely, and a coronet set 
upon her head, all disordered as her hair was; 
after which, every one being in amaze, he said, 
“Behold, this is the person whom J intend for 
my wife, provided she will accept of me for her 
husband.’’ Then, turning toward her, who stood 
quite abashed, ‘‘Will you,’’ said he, ‘‘have me 
for your husband?’’ She replied, ‘‘Yes, if it 
so please your lordship.’’ ‘‘Well,’’ he replied, 
‘and I take you for my wife.’’ 
So he espoused her in that public manner, and, 
mounting her on a palfrey, conducted her hon- 
orably to his palace, celebrating the nuptials with 
as much pomp and grandeur as tho he had been 
married to the daughter of the King of France; 
and the young bride showed apparently that with 
her garments she had changed both her mind and 
behavior. She had a most agreeable person, and 
was so amiable, and so good-natured withal, that 
she seemed rather a lord’s daughter than a poor 
shepherd’s; at which every one that knew her 
before was greatly surprized. She was so obe- 
dient, also, to her husband, and so obliging in 
all respects, that he thought himself the happiest 
man in the world; and to her subjects likewise 
so gracious and condescending that they all hon- 
ored and loved her as their own lives, praying 
for her health and prosperity, and declaring, con- 
trary to their former opinion, that Gualtieri was 
the most prudent and sharp-sighted prince in 
the whole world; for that no one could have 
discerned such virtues under a mean habit and 
169
-P-A-G-E-182
  THE BEST OF THE, WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  a country disguise but himself. In a very short 
time her disereet behavior and good works were 
the common subject of discourse, not in that 
country alone, but everywhere else; and what 
had been objected to the prince, with regard to 
his marrying her, now took a contrary turn. They 
had not lived long together before she proved 
with child, and at length brought forth a daugh- 
ter, for which he made great rejoicings. 
But soon afterward a new fancy came into his 
head, and that was to make trial of her patience 
by long and intolerable sufferings: so he began 
with harsh words and an appearance of great 
uneasiness—telling her that his subjects were 
greatly displeased with her for her mean parent- 
age, especially as they saw she bore children, 
and that they did nothing but murmur at the 
daughter already born. Which when she heard, 
without changing countenance or her resolution 
in any respect, she replied, ‘‘My lord, pray dis- 
pose of me as you think most for your honor 
and happiness: I shall entirely acquiesce, know~ 
ing myself to be meaner than the meanest of the 
people, and that I was altogether unworthy of 
that dignity to which your favor was pleased to 
advance me.’’ 
This was very agreeable to the prince, seeing 
that she was in no way elevated with the honor 
he had conferred upon her. Afterward, having 
often told her, in general terms, that his subjects 
eould not bear with the daughter that was born 
of her, he sent one of his servants, whom he 
had instructed what to do, who, with a very 
sorrowful countenance, said to her, ‘‘Madam, I 
must either lose my own life or obey my lord’s 
170
-P-A-G-E-183
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  commands; now he has ordered me to take your 
daughter, and—’’ without saying anything more. 
She, hearing these words, and noting the fellow’s 
looks, remembering also what she had heard be- 
fore from her lord, concluded that he had orders 
to destroy the child. So she took it out of the 
cradle, kissed it, avid gave it her blessing; when, 
without changing countenance, tho her heart 
throbbed with maternal affection, she tenderly 
laid it in the servant’s arms, and said, ‘‘Take 
it, and do what thy lord and mine has com- 
manded; but, prithee, leave it not to be devoured 
by the fowls or wild beasts, unless that be his 
will’? Taking the child, he acquainted the prince 
with what she said, who was greatly surprized 
at her constancy; and he sent the same person 
with it to a relation at Bologna, desiring her, 
without revealing whose child it was, to see it 
carefully brought up and educated. Afterward 
the lady became with child a second time, and 
was delivered of a son, at which he was extremely 
pleased. 
But, not satisfied with what he had already 
done, he began to grieve and persecute her still 
more, saying one day to her, seemingly much 
out of temper, ‘‘Since thou hast brought me this 
son, I am able to live no longer with my people; 
for they mutiny to that degree that a poor shep- 
herd’s grandson is to succeed, and be their lord 
after me, that, unless I would run the risk of 
being driven out of my dominions,,I must needs 
dispose of this child as I did of the other, and 
then send thee away, in order to take a wife more 
suitable to me.’’ She heard this with a great 
deal of resignation, making only this reply: ‘‘“My 
171
-P-A-G-E-184
    GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO 
  lord, study only your own ease and happiness, 
without the least care for me; for nothing is 
agreeable to me but what is pleasing to your- 
self.’’?. Not many days after he sent for the son 
in the same manner as he had done for the 
daughter, and seeming also as if he had procured 
him to be destroyed, had him conveyed to Bo-~ 
logna, to be taken care of with the daughter. 
This she bore with the same resolution as before, 
at which the prince wondered greatly, declaring 
to himself that no other woman was capable of 
doing the like. And were it not that he had 
observed her extremely fond of her children, 
while that was agreeable to him, he should have 
thought it want of affection in her; but he saw 
it was only her entire obedience and condescen- 
sion. The people, imagining that the children 
were both put to death, blamed him to the last 
degree, thinking him the most eruel and worst 
of men, and showing great compassion for the 
lady, who, whenever she was in company with 
the ladies of her acquaintance, and they condoled 
with her for her loss, would only say, ‘‘It was 
not my will, but his who begot them.’’ 
But more years being now passed, and he re- 
solving to make the last trial of her patience, 
declared, before many people, that he could no 
longer bear to keep Griselda as his wife, owning 
that he had done very foolishly, and like a young 
man, in marrying her, and that he meant to 
solicit the pope for a dispensation to take an- 
other and send her away; for which he was much 
blamed by many worthy persons; but he said 
nothing in return, only that it should beso. She, 
hearing this, and expecting to go home to her

father’s, and possibly tend the cattle as she had 
done before, while she saw some other lady pos- 
sest of him, whom she dearly loved and honored, 
was perhaps secretly grieved; but as she had 
withstood other strokes of fortune, so she deter- 
mined resolutely to do now. Soon afterward 
Gualtieri had counterfeit letters come to him, as 
from Rome, acquainting all his people that his 
holiness thereby dispensed with his marrying an- 
other and turning away Griselda. He then 
brought her before him, and said, ‘‘Woman, by 
the pope’s leave I may dispose of thee, and take 
another wife. As my ancestors, then, have been 
all sovereign princes of this country, and thine 
only peasants, I intend to keep thee no longer, 
but to send thee back to thy father’s cottage, 
with the same fortune which thou broughtest me, 
and afterward to make choice of one more suit- 
able in quality to myself.’’ It was with the 
utmost difficulty she could now refrain from 
tears; and she replied, ‘‘My lord, I was always 
sensible that my servile condition would no way 
accord with your high rank and descent. For 
what I have been, I own myself indebted to 
Providence and you; I considered it as a favor 
lent me: you are now pleased to demand it back; 
I therefore willingly restore it. Behold the ring 
with which you espoused me; I deliver it you. 
You bid me take the dowry back whieh I brought 
you; you will have no need for a teller to count 
it, nor I for a purse to put it in, much less a 
sumpter horse to carry it away.’’ . . . So 
she left his palace in that manner, and returned 
weeping to her father’s, to the great grief of 
all who saw her. 
173
-P-A-G-E-186

The poor man, never supposing that the prince 
would keep her so long as his wife, and expecting 
this thing.to happen every day, safely laid up 
the garments of which she had been despoiled 
the day he espoused her. He now brought them 
- to her, and she put them on, and went as usual 
about her father’s little household affairs, bearing 
this. fieree trial of adverse fortune with the great- 
est courage imaginable. The prince then gave 
out that he was to espouse a daughter of one 
of the counts of Panago; and, seeming as if he 
made great preparations for his nuptials, he sent 
for Griselda to come to him, and said to her, 
‘(IT am going to bring this lady home whom I 
have just married and intend to show her all 
possible respect at her first coming: thou knowest 
that I have no woman with me able to set out 
the rooms, and do many other things which are 
requisite on so solemn an occasion. As, therefore, 
thou art best acquainted with the state of the 
house, I would have thee make such provision as 
thou shalt judge proper, and invite what ladies 
thou wilt, even as tho thou wert mistress of the 
house, and when the marriage is ended get thee 
home to thy father’s again.’? Tho these words 
pierced like daggers to the heart of Griselda, 
who was unable to part with her love for the 
prinee so easily as she had done with her great 
fortune, yet she replied, ‘‘My lord, I am ready 
to fulfil all your commands.’’ She then went 
in her coarse attire into the palace, and with 
her own hands did she begin to sweep, and set 
all the rooms to rights, cleaning the stools and 
benches in the hall like the meanest servant, 
and direeting what was to be done in the kitchen, 
174 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  ‘GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO 
  never giving over till everything was in order 
and as it ought to be. After this was done she 
invited, in the prince’s name, all the ladies in 
the country to come to the feast. And on the day 
appointed for the marriage, meanly clad as she 
was, she received them in the most genteel and 
cheerful manner imaginable. 
Now, Gualtieri, who had his children earefully 
brought up at Bologna (the girl being about 
twelve years old, and one of the prettiest erea- 
tures that ever was seen, and--the boy six), had 
sent to his kinswoman there, to desire she would 
bring them, with an honorable retinue, to Saluzzo, 
giving it out all the way she came, that she was 
bringing the young lady to be married to him, 
without letting any one know to the contrary. 
Accordingly, they all three set forward, attended 
by a goodly train of gentry, and, after some days’ 
traveling, reached Saluzzo about dinner-time, 
when they found the whole company assembled, 
waiting to see their new lady. The young lady 
was most graciously received by all the women 
present, and being come into the hall where the 
tables were all eovered, Griselda, meanly drest 
as she was, went cheerfully to meet her, saying, 
‘*Your ladyship is most kindly welecome.’’ The 
ladies, who had greatly importuned the prince, 
tho to no purpose, to let Griselda be in a room 
by herself, or else that she might have some of 
her own clothes, and not appear before strangers 
in that manner, were now seated, and going to 
be served round, while the young lady was uni- 
versally admired, and every one said that the 
prince had made a good change; but Griselda, 
in partieular, highly commended both her and ~

  her brother. The marquis now thinking that he 
had seen enough with regard to his wife’s pa- 
tience, and perceiving that in all her trials she 
was still the same, being persuaded, likewise, that 
this proceeded from no want of understanding 
in her, because he knew her to be singularly 
prudent, he thought it time to take her from 
that anguish which he supposed she might con- 
ceal under her firm and constant deportment. 
So, making her come before all the company, he 
said, with a smile, ‘‘What thinkest thou, Gri- 
selda, of my bride?’’ ‘‘My lord,’’ she replied, 
“‘T like her extremely well; and if she be as 
prudent as she is fair, you may be the happiest 
man in the world with her: but I most humbly 
beg that you would not take those heart-breaking 
measures with this lady as you did with your 
last wife, because she is young and has been 
tenderly educated, whereas the other was inured 
to hardships from a child.’’ 
Gualtieri pereeiving that, tho Griselda thought 
that person was to be his wife, she nevertheless 
answered him with great humility and sweetness 
of temper, he made her sit down by him, and 
said, ‘‘Griselda, it is now time for you to reap 
the fruit of your long patience, and that they 
who have reputed me to be cruel, unjust, and 
a monster in nature may know that what I have 
done has been all along with a view to teach 
you how to behave as a wife; to show them how 
to choose and keep a wife; and, lastly, to seeure 
my own ease and quiet as long as we live to- 
gether, which I was apprehensive might have 
been endangered by my marrying. Therefore I

  treatment; and, not being sensible that you have 
ever transgrest my will, either in word or deed, 
I now seem to have met with that happiness I 
desired. I intend, then, to restore in one hour 
what I have taken away from you in many, and 
to make you the sweetest recompense for the 
many bitter pangs I have caused you to suffer. 
Accept, therefore, this young lady, whom thou 
thought my spouse, and her brother, as your chil- 
dren and mine. They are the same whom you . 
and many others believed that I had been the 
means of cruelly murdering; and I am your hus- 
band, who love and value you above all things, 
assuring myself that no person in the world can 
be happier in a wife than I am.’’ 
With this he embraced her most affectionately, 
when, rising up together (she weeping for jey), 
they went where their daughter was sitting, quite 
astonished with these things, and tenderly saluted 
both her and her brother, undeceiving them and 
the whole company. At this the wumen all arose, 
overjoyed, from the tables, and, taking Griselda 
into the chamber, they clothed her with her own 
noble apparel, and as a marchioness, resembling 
such a one even in rags, and brought her into 
the hall, And being extremely rejoiced with her 
son and daughter, and every one expressing the 
utmost satisfaction at what had come to pass, 
the feasting was prolonged many days. The mar- 
quis was adjudged a very wise man, tho abun- 
dantly too severe, and the trial of his lady most 
intolerable; but as for Griselda, she was beyond 
compare.

OUGHT PRINCES TO KEEP THEIR 
PROMISES* 
Ir is unquestionably very praiseworthy in 
princes to be faithful to their engagements; but 
among those of the present day, who have been 
distinguished for great exploits, few indeed have 
been remarkable for this virtue, or have scrupled 
1From Chapter XVIII of ‘The Prince.” Machiavelli’s 
writings appear not to have been translated into English 
until some years had elapsed after his death. The first work 
mentioned by Lowndes is “The Arte of Warre,” as ‘“‘set 
forth in Englisshe” by Peter Whitehaorne, published in 1560. 
Another translation appeared in 1608, under the title ‘“‘Dis- 
course upon the Meanes of wel Governing and Maintaining 
in good peace a Kingdome.” A more modern translation 
is by Ellis Farnsworth, The most recent of all, by Chris- 
tian E. Detmold, was published in Boston in 1882. 
The earliest English translation of the “History of Flor- 
ence” appears to be one made by Thomas Bedingfield, pub- 
lished in 1594. Another early translation was issued in 
1675. In 1752 the translation by Ellis Farnsworth waa

  to deceive others who may have relied on their 
good faith. 
It should, therefore, be known that there are 
two ways of deciding any contest; the one by 
laws, the other by force. The first is peculiar 
to men, the. second to beasts; but when laws are 
not sufficiently powerful, it is necessary to recur 
to force; a prince ought, therefore, to understand 
how to use both these descriptions of arms. This 
doctrine is admirably illustrated to us by the 
ancient poets in the allegorical history of the 
education of Achilles, and many other princes 
of antiquity, by the centaur Chiron, who, under 
the double form of man and beast, taught those 
who were destined to govern that it was their 
duty to use by turns the arms adapted to both 
these. natures, seeing that one without the other 
ean not be of any durable advantage. Now, as 
a prince must learn how to. act the part of a 
beast sometimes, he should make the fox and the 
lion his patterns. The first can but feebly defend 
himself against the wolf, and the latter readily 
falls into such snares as are laid for him. From 
the fox, therefore, a prince will learn dexterity 
in avoiding snares; and from the lion how to 
employ his strength to keep the wolves in awe. 
But they who entirely rely upon the lion’s 
strength, will not always meet with suecess; in 
other words, a prudent prince can not.and ought 
not to keep his word, except when he ean do it 
without injury to himself, or when the cireum- 
stances under which he contracted the engage- 
ment still exist. 
-I. should be cautious in inculeating such a 
precept if all men were good; but as the gen- 
179

  erality of mankind are wicked, and ever ready 
to break their words, a prince should not pique 
himself in keeping his more scrupulously, espe- 
eially as it is always easy to justify a breach 
of faith on his part. I could give numerous - 
proofs of this, and show numberless engagements 
and treaties which have been violated by the 
treachery of princes, and that those who enacted 
the part of the fox have always succeeded best 
in their affairs. It is necessary, however, to 
disguise the appearance of eraft, and thoroughly 
to understand the art of feigning and dissem- 
bling; for men are generally so simple and so 
weak that he who wishes to deceive easily finds 
dupes. 
One example, taken from the history of our 
own times, will be sufficient. Pope Alexander 
VI played during his whole life a game of de- 
ception; and notwithstanding his faithless con- 
duct was extremely well known, his artifices al- 
ways proved successful. Oaths and protestations 
cost him nothing; never did a prince so often 
break his word or pay less regard to his engage- 
ments. This was because he so well understood this 
chapter in the art of government. 
It is not necessary, however, for a prince to 
possess all the good qualities I have enumerated, 
but it is indispensable that he should appear to 
have them. I will even venture to affirm that it 
is sometimes dangerous to use, tho it is always 
useful to seem to possess them. A prince should 
earnestly endeavor to gain the reputation of 
kindness, clemency, piety, justice, and fidelity 
to his engagements, He ought to possess all 
these good qualities, but. still retain such power

over himself as to display their opposites when- 
ever it may be expedient. I maintain that a 
prince, and especially a new prince, can not with 
impunity exercise all the virtues, because his own 
self-preservation will often compel him to violate 
the laws of charity, religion, and humanity. He 
should habituate himself to bend easily to the 
various circumstances which may from time to 
time surround him. In a word, it will be as 
useful to him to persevere in the path of recti- 
tude, while he feels no inconvenience in doing so, 
as to know how to deviate from it when circum- 
stances dictate such a course. He should make 
it a rule, above all things, never to utter any- 
thing which does not breathe of kindness, justice, 
good faith, and piety; this last quality it is most 
important for him to appear to possess, as men 
in general judge more from appearance than from 
reality. All men have eyes, but few have the 
gift of penetration, Every one sees your exte- 
rior, but few can discern what you have in your 
heart; and those few dare not oppose the voice 
of the multitude, who have the majesty of their 
prinee on their side. Now, in forming a judg- 
ment of the minds of men, and more especially 
of princes, as we can not recur to any tribunal, 
we must attend only to results, Let it then be 
the prince’s chief care to maintain his authority ; 
the means he employs, be what they may, will, 
for this purpose, always appear honorable and 
meet applause; for the vulgar are ever caught 
by appearances, and judge only by the event. 
And as the world is chiefly composed of such 
as are called the vulgar, the voice of the few 
is seldom or never heard or regarded.

BENVENUTO CELLINI 
Born in Florence in 1500, died in 1571; worked in Pisa 
from 1516 to 1517; in Rome from 1523-40; assisted in 
the defense. of the castle of St. Angelo during the siege 
and sacking of Rome by the Constable De Bourbon in 1527; 
imprisoned in St. Angelo in 1528, his account of his eseape 
being the gem of his “Autobiography”; in. France at the

standing in Florence; his ‘Autobiography’ not printed until 
1780, altho well known previously in manuscript form. 
THE CASTING OF HIS “PERSEUS AND 
MEDUSA”? 
As I had been particularly successful in casting 
my Medusa, I made a model of my Perseus in 
wax, and flattered myself. that I should’ have the 
same success in casting the latter in bronze as 
I had had with the former. Upon its appearing 
to such advantage and looking so beautiful in 
wax, the duke,’ whether somebody else put it 
into his head, or whether it was a notion of his 
own, as he came to my house oftener than usual,

account. The earliest English translation of Cellini appears

  once took occasion to say to me, ‘‘Benvenuto, 
this statue can not be cast in bronze: it is not 
in the power of your art to compass it.’’? Hear- 
ing him express himself in that manner, I dis- 
eovered great vexation, and said, ‘‘My lord, I 
know that your excellency places very little con- 
fidence in me, and that you have but too good 
an opinion of those who speak ill of me; or else 
you do not understand things of this nature.’’ 
Searee did he suffer me to utter these words 
when he answered, ‘‘I profess to understand 
them, and I do understand them perfeetly.’’ I 
replied, ‘‘You may understand them as a prince, 
but not as an artist; for if you had that skill 
in these matters which you think you have, you 
would believe me on account of that fine bronze 
head which I cast for your excellency, and which 
was sent to the Elbe; as also for having restored 
the beautiful figure of Ganymede, a work that 
gave me infinite trouble, insomuch that it would 
have been easier for me to have made a new 
one; likewise for having cast the Medusa, which 
stands here before your excellency, a performance 
of immense difficulty, in which I have done what 
no other man has done before me in this most 
laborious art.’? . 
‘The duke seareely had patience to hear me 
out, but sometimes turned one way, sometimes 
another; and I was quite in despair when I rec- 
ollected the circumstances in which I had lived 
in France. At last he all of a sudden said, ‘‘Tell 
me,. Benvenuto, how is it possible that this fine 
head of Medusa, which Perseus holds aloft in his 
hand, should ever come out cleverly??? I im- 
mediately. answered, ‘‘It is clear, my lord, that

  you are no conndisseur in statuary, as your ex- 
cellency boasts yourself; for if you had any skill 
in the art, you would not be afraid of that fine 
head not coming out, but would express your 
apprehensions concerning that right foot, which 
is at such a distance below.’’ ‘The duke, half- 
angry, addressing himself to some noblemen who 
were with him, said, ‘‘I really believe it is a 
practise of Benvenuto’s to contradict and oppose 
everything he hears advanced.’’ . . . 
After I had made its coat of earth, covered 
it well, and bound it properly with irons, I began 
by means of a slow fire to draw off the wax, 
which melted away by many ventholes; for the 
more of these are made, the better the molds are 
filled; and when I had entirely stript off the 
wax, I made a sort of fence around my Perseus, 
that is, round the mold above mentioned, of 
bricks, piling them one upon another, and leaving 
several vacuities for the fire to exhale at. I next 
began gradually to put on the wood, and kept 
a constant fire for two days and two nights, till,- 
the wax being quite off, and the mold well baked, 
I began to dig a hole to bury my mold in, and 
observed all those fine methods of proceeding that 
are prescribed by our art. When I had ¢om- 
pletely dug my hole, I took my mold, and by 
means of levers and strong cables directed it with 
care, and suspended it a cubit above the level 
of the furnace, so that it hung exactly in the 
middle of the hole. I then let it gently down to 
the very botiom of the furnace, and placed it 
with all the eare and exactness I possibly eould. 
After I had finished this part of my task, I 
began to make a covering of the very earth I 
184
-P-A-G-E-197
  BENVENUTO CELLINI 
  had taken off, and in proportion as I raised the 
earth I made vents for it, which are a sort of 
tubes of baked earth, generally used for conduits, 
and other things of a similar nature. As soon as 
I saw that I had placed it properly, and that 
this manner of covering it, by putting on these 
small tubes in their proper places, was likely to 
answer, as also that my journeymen thoroughly 
understood my plan, which was very different 
from that of all other masters, and 1 was sure 
that I could depend upon them, I turned my 
thoughts to‘my furnace. I had caused it to be 
filled with several pieces of brass and bronze, 
and heaped them upon one another in the manner 
taught us by our art, taking particular eare to 
leave a passage for the flames, that the metal 
might the sooner assume its color and dissolve 
into a fluid. Thus I with great alacrity excited 
my men to lay on the pine wood, which, because 
of the oiliness of the resincus matter that oozes 
from the pine-tree, and that my furnace. was 
admirably well made, burned at such a rate that 
I was continually obliged to run to and fro, which 
greatly fatigued me. I, however, bore the hard- 
ship; but, to add to my misfortune, the shop took 
fire, and we were ali very much afraid the roof 
would fall in and crush us. From another quar- 
ter, that is, from the garden, the sky poured in 
80 much rain and wind that it cooled my furnace. 
Thus did I continue to struggle with these 
ross aceidents for several hours, and exerted 
myself to such a degree that my constitution, 
tho robust, could no longer bear such severe hard- 
ship, and I was suddenly attacked by a most 
violent. intermitting fever: in short, I was so ill 
185
-P-A-G-E-198
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  
that I found myself under a necessity of lying 
down upon my bed. . . 
My housekeeper, whose name was Mona Fiora 
da Castel del Rio, was one of the most sensible 
and affectionate women in the world: she rebuked 
me for giving way to vain fears, and at the same 
time attended me with the greatest kindness and 
eare imaginable; however, seeing me so very ill, 
and terrified to such a degree, she could not 
contain herself, but shed a fiood of tears, which 
she endeavored to conceal from me. While we 
were both in this deep affliction, I perceived a 
man enter the room, who in his person appeared 
to be as crooked and distorted as great S, and 
began to express himself in these terms, with a 
tone of voice as dismal and melancholy as those 
who exhort and pray with persons who are going 
to be executed: ‘‘Alas! poor Benvenuto, your 
work is spoiled, and the misfortune admits of no 
remedy.’? 
No sooner had I heard the words uttered by 
this messenger of evil but I cried out so loud 
that my voice might be heard to the skies, and 
got out of bed. I began immediately to dress, 
and, giving plenty of kicks and cuffs to the maid- 
servants and the boy as they offered to help me 
on with my clothes, I complained bitterly in these 
terms: ‘“O you envious and treacherous wretches, 
this is a piece of villainy contrived on purpose; 
but I swear. by the living God that I will sift 
it to the bottom, and, before I die, give such 
proofs who I am as shall not fail to astonish the 
whole world.’’ Having huddled on my clothes, 
I went, with a mind boding evil, to the shop, 
where I found all those whom I had left so alert, 
186
-P-A-G-E-199
  BENVENUTO CELLINI 
  and in such high spirits, standing in the utmost 
confusion and astonishment. I thereupon addrest 
them ‘thus: “Listen, all of you, to what I am going 
to say; and since you either would not or could 
not follow the method I pointed out, obey me 
now that I am present: my work is ‘before us, 
and let none of you offer to oppose or contradict 
me, for such cases as this require activity, and 
not counsel.’? Hereupon one Alessandro Lastri- 
eati had the assurance to say to me, ‘‘Look you, 
Benvenuto, you have undertaken a work which 
our art can not compass, and which is not to 
be: effected by human power.’’ 
Hearing these words, I turned round in such 
a@ passion, and seemed so bent on mischief that 
both he and all the-rest unanimously cried out 
to me, “‘Give your orders, and we will all second 
you in whatever you command: we will assist 
you as long as we have breath in our bodies.’ 
These kind and affectionate words they uttered, 
as I firmly believe, in a persuasion that I was on 
the point of expiring. I went directly to examine 
the furnace, and saw all the metal in it conereted. 
I thereupon ordered two of the helpers to step 
over the way to Capretta, a butcher, for a load 
of young oak, which had been above a year dry- 
ing, and been offered me by Maria Ginevra, wife 
to'the said Capretta. ” 
Upon his bringing me the first bundles of it, 
I began to fill the grate. This sort of oak inakes 
a brisker fire than any other wood whatever; 
bat ‘the wood of elder-trees and pine-trees is used 
in casting artillery, because it makes a mild and 
gentle fire. As‘’soon as the conereted metal felt 
the power of this violent fire, it began to brighten 
187
-P-A-G-E-200
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  and glitter. In another quarter I made them 
hurry the tubes with all possible expedition, and 
sent some of them to the roof of the house, to 
take care of the fire, which through the great 
violence of the wind had acquired new force; 
and toward the garden I had caused some tables 
with pieces of tapestry and old clothes to be 
placed, in order to shelter me from the rain. 
As soon as I had applied the proper remedy to 
e.ch evil, I with a loud voice cried out to my 
me. to bestir themselves and lend a helping hand; 
so that when they saw that the concreted metal 
began to melt again, the whole body obeyed me 
with such zeal and alacrity that every man did 
the work of three. 
Then I caused a mass of pewter weighing about 
sixty pounds to be thrown upon the metal in the 
furnace, which with the other helps, as the brisk 
wood fire, and stirring it, sometimes with iron, 
and sometimes with long poles, soon became com- 
pletely dissolved. Finding that, contrary to the 
opinion of my ignorant assistants, I had effected 
what seemed as diffieult as to raise the dead, I 
recovered my vigor to such a degree that I no 
longer perceived whether I had any fever, nor 
had I the least apprehension of death. Suddenly 
a loud noise was heard, and a glittering of fire 
flashed before our eyes, as if it had been the 
darting of a thunderbolt. Upon the appearance 
of this extraordinary phenomenon, terror seized 
on all present, and on none more than myself. 
This tremendous noise being over, we began to 
stare at each other, and perceived that the cover 
of the furnace had burst and flown off, so that 
the bronze began to run. 
188
-P-A-G-E-201
  BENVENUTO CELLINI 
  I immediately caused the mouths of my mold 
to be opened; but, finding that the metal did not 
run with its usual velocity, and apprehending 
that the cause of it was that the fusibility of the 
metal was injured by the violence of the fire, 
I ordered all my dishes and porringers, which 
were in number about two hundred, to be placed 
one by. one before my tubes, and part of them 
to be thrown into the furnace; upon which all 
present perceived that my bronze was completely 
dissolved, and that my mold was filling: they now 
with joy and alacrity assisted and obeyed me. 
I, for my part, was sometimes in one plaee, 
sometimes in another, giving my directions and 
assisting my men, before whom I offered up this 
prayer: ‘‘O God, I address myself to Thee, who 
of Thy divine power didst rise from the dead 
and ascend in glory to heaven. I acknowledge 
in gratitude this merey that my mold has been 
filled: I fall prostrate before Thee, and with 
my whole heart.return thanks to Thy divine maj- 
esty.”? My prayer being over, I took a plate of 
meat which stood upon a little bench, and ate 
with a great appetite. I then drank with all 
my journeymen and assistants, and went joyful 
and in good health to bed; for there were still 
two hours of night; and T rested as well as if 
I had been troubled with no manner of disorder. 
My good housekeeper, without my having given 
any orders, had provided a young capon for my 
dinner. When I arose, which was not till about 
noon, she accosted me in high spirits, and said, 
merrily, ‘‘Is this the man that thought himself 
dying? It is my firm belief that the cuffs and 
kicks which you gave us last night, when you

  were quite frantic and possest, frightened. away 
your fever, which, apprehending lest you should 
fall upon it in the same manner, took to flight. ”” 
So my whole poor family, having got over such 
panies and hardships, without delay procured 
earthen vessels to supply the place of the pewter 
dishes and porringers, and we all dined together 
very cheerfully: indeed, I do not. remember hav- 
ing ever in my life eaten a meal with greater 
satisfaction or with a better appetite. 
My mortal enemy, Pier Francesco Rieci, the 
duke’s steward, was very eager to know how 
the affair had turned out; so that the two whom 
I suspected of being the cause of my metal’s 
concreting in the manner. above related told me 
that I was not a man, but rather a downright 
devil, for 1 had compassed that whii 
in the power ‘of art to effect; with 1 
surprizing things which would have

greatly exaggerated what had passe 
with a view of excusing themselves, t 
wrote. to the duke, who was then ¢ 
account still more pompous and more 
the marvelous than that which the w< 
given him. 
Having left my work to cool durin 
after it was east, I began gradually 
it. I first of all found the Medusa’s | 
had eome out admirably by the assist 
vents, as I had observed to the dul 
property of fire was to fly upward. -

  greater surprize, because, as it is seen in the 
statue, it is much lower than that of Medusa, 
the mouth of that figure being placed over the 
head and shoulders. of Perseus. I found that 
where the head of Perseus ends, all the bronze 
was exhausted which I had in my furnace. This 
surprized me. very much, that there should. not 
be anything over and above- what is necessary in 
easting. My astonishment, indeed, was taised 
to such a degree that I looked upon it as a 
miracle immediately wrought by the Almighty. 
I went on uncovering it, with great suecess, and 
found every part turn out to admiration, till 
I reached the foot of the right leg, which sup- 
ports the figure, where I found: the heel come 
out: so, proceeding to examine it, and thinking 
that the whole was filled up, in one respect I was 
glad, in another sorry, because I had told the 
duke it would not have that effect. Continuing, 
however, to uncover it, I found: that not only 
the toes were wanting, but part of the foot it- 
self, so that there was almost one-half deficient. 
This occasioned me some new trouble; but I was 
not displeased at it, because I eould thereby con- 
vinee the duke that I understood my business 
thoroughly; and tho there had come out a great 
deal more of that foot than I thought there 
would, the reason was that, in consequence of 
the several accidents that had happened, it was 
heated much more than it could have been in 
the regular course of business—especially as the 
pewter plates had been thrown into the furnace, 
a thing never done before.

  all persons, and under every circumstance. The 
world received the gift of this artist from the 
hand of Nature, when, vanquished by Art in the 
person of Michelangelo, she deigned to: be sub- 
jugated in that of Raphael, not by art only but 
by goodness also. And of a truth, since the 
greater number of artists had up to that period 
derived from nature a certain rudeness and ec- 
centricity, which not only rendered them uncouth 
and fantastic, but often caused the shadows and 
darkness of vice to be more conspicuous in their 
lives than the light and splendor of those virtues 
by which man is rendered immortal—so was there 
good cause wherefore she should, on the contrary

by so much diffidence, grace, application to study, 
and excellence of life, that these alone would have 
sufficed to veil or neutralize every fault, however 
important, and to efface all defects, however 
glaring they might have been. Truly may we 
affirm that those who are the possessors of en- 
dowments so rich and varied as were assembled

Raphael was born at Urbino—a most renowned 
city of Italy—on Good Friday of the year 1483, 
at three o’elock of the night. His father was

  a certain Giovanni de’ Santi; a painter of no 
great eminence in his art, but a man of sufficient 
intelligence nevertheless, and perfectly competent 
to direct his children into that good way which 
had not, for his misfortune, been laid open to 
himself in his younger days. And first, as he 
knew how important it is that a child should 
be nourished by the milk of its own mother, and 
not by that of the hired nurse, so he determined 
when. his son Raphael (to whom he gave that 
naire at his baptism, as being one of good au- 
gury) was born to him, that the mother’ of the 
child, he having no other—as, indeed, he never 
had more—should herself be the nurse of the 
child. Giovanni further desired that in his tender 
years the boy should rather be brought up to the 
habits of his own family, and beneath his pater- 
nal roof, than be sent where he must acquire 
habits and manners less refined and modes of 
thought less commendable, in the houses of the 
peasantry or. other untaught persons. As the 
child became older, Giovanni began to instruet 
him in the first principles of painting; perceiving 
that he was much inclined to that art, and finding 
him to be endowed with a most admirable genius ; 
few years had passed, therefore, before Raphael, 
tho still but a child, became a valuable assistant 
to his father in the numerous works which the 
latter executed in the state of Urbino. 
At length this good and affectionate father, 
knowing that his son would acquire but little of 
his art from himself, resolved to place him with 
Pietro Perugino, who, according to what Giovanni

  had been told, was then considered to hold the 
first place among the painters of the time. 
Wherefore, proceeding to Perugia for that pur- 
pose, and finding Pietro to be absent from the 
city, he occupied himself—to the end that he 
might await the return of the master with the 
less inconvenience—in the execution of certain 
works for the church of San Francesco in that 
place. But when Pietro had returned to Perugia, 
Giovanni, who was a person of very good man- 
ners and pleasing deportment, soon formed an 
amicable acquaintanceship with him; and when 
the proper opportunity arrived, made known to 
him the desire he had conceived,.in the most 
suitable manner that he could devise. Thereupon 
Pietro, who was also exceedingly courteous, as 
well as a lover of fine genius, agreed to accept 
the care of Raphael. Giovanni then returned 
to Urbino; and having taken the boy, tho not 
without many tears from his mother, who loved 
him tenderly, he condueted him to Perugia: when 
Pietro no sooner beheld his manner of drawing, 
and observed the pleasing deportment of the 
youth than he conceived that opinion of him 
which was in due time so amply confirmed by 
the results produced in the after life of Ra- 
phae, . . ‘ 
But I have now discoursed respecting these ques- 
tions of art at more length perhaps than was need- 
ful, and will return to the life and death of Ra- 
phael. This master lived in the strictest intimacy 
with Bernardo Divizio, Cardinal of Bibbiena, who 
had for many years importuned him to take a wife 
of his seleetion; nor had Raphael directly re- 
fused compliance with the wishes of the cardinal, 
195

but had put the matter off, by saying that he 
would wait some three or four years longer. The 
term which he had thus set approached before 
Raphael had thought of it, when he was reminded 
by the cardinal of his promise; and being as he 
ever, was just and upright, he would not depart 
from his word, and therefore accepted a niece of 
the cardinal himself for his wife. But as this 
engagement was nevertheless a very heavy re- 
straint to him, he put off the marriage from time 
to time; insomuch that several months passed, 
and the ceremony had not yet taken place. Yet 
this was not done without a very honorable mo- 
tive; for Raphael having been for many years in 
the service of the count, and being the creditor 
of Leo X for a large sum of money, had received 
an intimation to the effeet that when the hall 
with which he was then occupied was completed, 
the pontiff intended to reward him for his labors 
as well as to do honor to his talents by bestowing 
on him the red hat, of which he meant to dis- 
tribute a considerable number, many of them 
being designed for persons whose merits were 
greatly inferior to those of Raphael. 
“The painter meanwhile did not abandon the 
light attachment by which he was enchained: and 
one day, on returning to his house from one of 
these secret visits, he was seized with a violent

  fever, which being mistaken for a cold, the physi- 
cians inconsiderately caused him to be bled; 
whereby he found himself exhausted, when he had 
rather required to be strengthened. Thereupon 
he made his will, and as a good Christian he sent 
the object of his attachment from the house, but 
left her a sufficient provision wherewith she might 
live in decency: having done so much, he divided 
his property among his disciples,—Giulio Romano, 
that is to say, whom he always loved greatly, and 
Giovanni Francesco, with whom was joined a cer- 
tain priest of Urbino who was his kinsman, but 
whose name I do not know. He furthermore com- 
manded that a certain portion of his property 
should be employed in the restoration of one of 
the ancient tabernacles in Santa Maria Ritonda,’ 
which he had selected as his burial-place, and for 
which he had ordered that an altar, with the 
figure of Our Lady in marble, should be prepared; 
all that he possest besides he bequeathed. to Giulio 
Romano and Giovanni Francesco,—naming Mes-

the Pope, as his executor. He then confest, and 
in much contrition completed the course of his 
life, on the day whereon it had. commenced, which 
was Good Friday. The master was then in the 
thirty-seventh year of his age, and as he embel-

worked, with the picture of the Transfiguration 
which he had executed for Cardinal Ginlio de’ 
Medici at the head of the corpse. He who, re- 
garding that living picture, afterward turned to 
eonsider that dead body, felt his heart bursting 
with grief as he beheld them. The loss of Ra- 
phael caused the cardinal to command that this 
work should be placed on the high altar of San 
Pietro da Montorio, where it has ever since 
been held in the utmost veneration for its own 
great value, as well as for the excellence of its 
author. The remains of this divine artist re- 
eeived that honorable sepulture which the noble 
spirit whereby they had been informed had so 
well deserved; nor was there any artist in Rome 
who did not deeply bewail the loss sustained by 
the departure of the master, or who failed to ac- 
eompany his remains to their repose. 
The death of Raphael was in like manner de- 
plored by all the papal court: not only because 
he had formed part thereof, since he had held the 
office of chamberlain to the pontiff, but also be- 
cause Leo X had esteemed him so highly, that his 
loss oceasioned that sovereign the bitterest grief. 
O most happy and thrice blest spirit, of whom all 
are proud to speak, whose actions are celebrated 
with praise by all men, and the least of whose 
works left behind thee is admired and prized! 
When this noble artist died, well might Paint- 
ing have departed also; for when he closed his eyes, 
she too was left as it were blind. But now to us, 
whose lot it is to come after him, there remains to 
imitate the good, or rather the excellent, of which 
he has left us the example; and as our obliga-

  tions to him and his great merits well deserve, to 
retain the most grateful remembrance of him in 
our hearts, while we ever maintain his memory 
in the highest honor with our lips. To him of a 
truth it is that we owe the possession of inven- 
tion, coloring, and execution, brought’ alike and 
altogether to that point of perfeetion for which 
few could have dared to hope; nor has any man 
ever aspired to pass before him. 
And in addition to the benefits which this great 
master conferred on art, being as he was its best 
friend, we have the further obligation to him of 
having taught us by his life in what manner we 
should comport ourselves toward great men, gs 
well as toward those of lower degree, ard’ leven 
toward the lowest; nay, there was among his

At that time I am writing of, Lord Keith was 
living in Berlin, resting on his laurels, beloved 
and ‘cherished by the king, but taking no active 
part in politics, as he was over eighty years of 
age, but simple and charming as ever. He re- 
eeived me kindly, and exprest a hope that I should 
remain some time in Berlin, as he knew, to a cer- 
tain extent, the vicissitudes of my past life. I 
replied that I would gladly settle there if the 
king would give me a suitable appointment; but

when I asked him to speak to the king for me, 
he replied that that. would do more harm than 
good. ‘‘His majesty piques himself on knowing 
men better than any one else. He likes to judge 
them himself; sometimes he discovers merit when 
no one else sees any, and sometimes vice versa.’’ 
He advised me to write to the king and beg 
an interview. 
‘*When you speak to him, you can say that you 
know me, and he will then probably ask me about 
you; you may be sure that I shall say nothing 
but what is to your eredit.’’ 
“<I, my lord, write to a king to whom I have 
uno introduction? I could not think of it.’’ . 
“But you wish to speak to him, do you not?’’ 
“‘Certainly.’? 
“That is. enough; your letter need contain 
nothing but the expression of your desire.” 
‘*Will the king answer me?’’ 
‘‘Without doubt, for he answers everybody. 
He will tell you when it will please him to receive 
you. Take my advice, and let me know how you 
get on.’” 
I did as he suggested, and wrote a simple and 
respectful letter, asking when and where I might 
present myself to his majesty.. The day but one 
after I received a reply signed Frederick, ac- 
knowledging the receipt of my letter, and saying 
I should find him at four o’elock that day in the 
gardens at Sans Souci. 
As my readers may imagine, I was delighted 
at having obtained a rendezvous, and arrived at 
the palace an hour before the appointed time very 
simply drest in black. I entered the courtyard, 
and as I did not see any one, not even a sentinel,

I went up a short stairease, and opening a 
door, found myself in a pieture-gallery. <A 
guardian eame up and offered to show me the 
collection. 
‘«T did not eome here to admire these works of 
art,’’ I said, ‘‘but te speak to the king, who told 
me he would be in the garden.’’ 
‘*At this moment he is at his concert, playing 
the flute. “Tis his dessert after dinner, and he 
treats himself to it every day. Did he fix any 
hour?’’ 
‘*Yes, four o’elock, but he may have forgot- 
ten.’ 
“(He never forgets. He will be punctual, and 
you had better wait in the garden.’’ 
I had not been there long, when I saw him ap- 
proaching. The king followed by his secretary 
and a fine spaniel. As soon as he saw me he 
pronounced my name, at the same time taking off 
his bad old hat; he then asked, in a terrible 
voice, what I wanted. 
I stood looking at him in silence. 
‘‘Well, can’t you speak? Isn’t it you who 
wrote to me?’’ 
“Yes, sire; but now I can’t remember what 
I had to say. I did not think the majesty of a 
king could so dazzle my-senses. I shall be better 
prepared in future. My lord marshal ought to 
have warned me.’’ 
‘*Aht!t he, knows you, does he? Come, let us 
walk about. What did you wish to say? What 
do you think of this garden?’’ 
He ordered me to speak of his garden! I 
should have said I knew nothing of gardens to 
any one else, but if he chose to think me a con-

  noisseur I must fain pretend te be one. At the 
risk of exposing my ignorance, I replied that it 
‘was superb. : 
“‘But,’’ he said, ‘‘the gardens at Versailles are 
far finer.’”’ 
“‘T own it, sire; but that is because of the foun- 
tains.’? : 
“True; but it is not my fault. There is no 
water here. I have spent more than three hun- 
dred thousand crowns, but without suecess.’” 
‘“‘Three hundred thousand erowns, sire! If 
your majesty spent that sum, there should have 
been abundance of water.’’ 
‘Ah! ah! I see you are a hydraulic architect.’’ 
Could I tell him he was mistaken? I was afraid 
of displeasing him, so I simply bent my head. 
This could be taken for yes or no. Thank God, 
he did not continue to talk on this subject, or I 
should have been terribly put to it, for I did not 
know the very rudiments of hydraulics. 
Still walking up and down, and turning his 
head right and left, he asked me what the Vene- 
tian forces, naval and military, amounted to. 
Now I was on my own ground. ‘Twenty men of 
war, sire, and a large number of galleys.’’ 
‘¢And what land forees?’’ 
‘Seventy thousand men, sire, all subjects of 
the republic, and counting all that, only one man 
from each village.’’ 
“Phat is not true. I suppose you want to 
amuse me with your fables. You must be a finan- 
eier; tell me, what do you think of the taxes?’’ 
This was the first interview I had ever had with 
royalty. Considering his style, his abrupt change 
of subject, and his sudden digressions, I felt as

  tho I had been called on to act in one of those 
improvised Italian comedies in which, if the aetor 
stops short for a word, the pit and the gallery hiss 
him mercilessly. I immediately assumed the style 
of a financier, and replied that I was acquainted 
with the theory of taxation. 
‘That is what I want,’’ he replied, ‘‘for the 
practise does not concern you.’’ 
“There are three kinds of taxes, taking into 
consideration their effects: one is ruinous, one is 
unfortunately necessary, and the third is always 
exéellent.’’ 
“That is good; go on.’ 
‘‘The ruinous tax is the royal tax; the neces- 
sary one is the nuilitary one; and the excellent 
one is the popular tax.’ 
I wanted to throw him off his beat a little, 
as I had not got up my subject. 
‘The royal tax, sire, is the one which empties 
the purses of the subjects to swell the coffers of 
the sovereign.’? 
“‘And that is the ruinous one, you say?”” 
‘‘Always, sire, for it stops the circulation of 
money, which is the soul of commerce and the 
backbone of the state.’’ 
“Yet, you consider the army tax necessary 9”? 
“Unfortunately necessary, for war is a dire 
ealamity.’’ 
‘‘Perhaps. And how about the popular tax??? 
“It is always excellent, for what the king takes 
from his people with one hand, he gives them 
back with the other, turning it into useful chan-

‘<There is a good deal of truth in what you say. 
No doubt you know Calsabigi?’’ 
“*T ought to know him, sire, for we established 
the Genoese lottery in Paris together, seven years 
‘‘And under what head would you class that 
tax, if you admit it to be one?’’ 
“*It is one, sire, and not one of the least im- 
portant. It is a good: tax, if the king spends 
the profits in a useful manner.’? 
“(But supposing he loses ?’’ 
“*One chance in fifty, sire.’’ 
“Is that the result of an exact caleulation?’’ 
‘* As exact, sire, as all political ecaleulations.”’ 
“They are often wrong.’’ 
“‘They are never wrong, sire, if God remains 
neutral.’’ 
‘*Why drag the Deity into such a question?’’ 
‘‘Let us say then, sire, luck, or destiny.’’ 
“That is better. Perhaps I agree with you 
about the moral calculations, but I do not like 
your Genoese lottery. It seems to me a mere 
swindle, and I would not have anything to do 
with it, even if I were certain to win always.’ 
**Your majesty is right, for the publie would 
never support lotteries were they not led away 
by false security.’ 
Then he tried one or two other points, but I 
met him without flinching. Suddenly he stopt 
short and looked me over from head to foot. 
“Do you know that you are a very handsome 
man 9”? > ‘Is it possible, sire, that after a long scientific

The king smiled with kind malice, then said: 
‘¢As it seems that Lord Keith knows you, I will 
speak to him about you.’’ 
He then took off his hat again, for he was never 
chary of his bows, and I, making him a profound 
reverence, withdrew. 
Three or four days after the lord marshal told 
me the king was very pleased with me, and had 
said he would try and find me something to do.

Princes must be endured, lest tyranny should 
give way to anarchy, a still greater evil. This has

that Luther ought to be answered and not crusht. 
We must bear almost anything rather than throw 
the world into confusion. The actual facts of 
things are not to be blurted out at all times and

oppose the publication of Luther’s books. I 
recommended Luther himself to publish nothing 
revolutionary. I feared always that revolution 
would be the end, and I would have done more

THE BEGINNINGS OF DON QUIXOTE’S

In a village of La Mancha, the name of which 
I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not 
long since one of those gentlemen that keep a 
lance in the lanee-rack, and an old buckler, a lean 
1The first translation of “Don Quixote” into any lan- 
guage was the one begun into English by Thomas Shelton 
in 1607, only two years after the publication of the original 
Spanish. It was followed in 1687 by a translation 
by John Philips, a nephew of Milton. Peter A. Motteux, 
who had previously completed the standard translation of 
Rabelais begun by Urquhart, published a version of “Don 
Quixote’ in 1719, which was afterward reissued by John 
Gibson Lockhart with notes by himself. Charles Jarvis, 
@ painter, who was a friend of Pope, published a trans- 
lation in 1742. This was followed in 1755 by a translation

  hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of 
rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most 
nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, 
and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away 
with three-quarters of his income. The rest of 
it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet 
breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while 
on week-days he made a brave figure in his best 
homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper 
past forty, a niece under twenty, and a Jad for 
the field and market-place, who used to saddle 
the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The 
age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on 
fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt- 
featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. 
They will have it bis surname was Quixada or 
Quesada (for here there is some difference of 
opinion among the authors who write on the sub- 
ject), altho from reasonable conjectures it seems 
plain that he called himself Quixana. This, how- 
ever, is of but little importance to our tale; it 
will be enough not to stray a hair’s-breadth from 
the truth in the telling of it. 
You must know then that the above-named 
gentleman, whenever he was at leisure (which 
was mostly all the year round) gave himself up 
by Tobias Smollet, which seems to have been made from 
the French rather than the Spanish. In 1818 4 sister of 
R. Smirke brought out ancther version. Stil! another by 
A. J. Duffield was issued in 1851 and another by John 
Ormsby in 1885. The translation by John Jarvis has prob- 
ably had the greatest vogue. The passages given in this 
collection are from his version. H. E. Watts, author of 
a notable recent “Life of Cervantes,” published also a 
translation of “Don Quixote,” which has been thought to ~ 
sarpass others.

to reading books of chivalry with such ardor and 
avidity that he almost entirely neglected the pur- 
suit of his field-sports, and even the management 
of his property; and to such a pitch did his 
eagerness and infatuation go that he sold many 
an aere of tillage-land to buy books of chivalry 
to read, and brought home as many of them as 
he could get. But of all there were none he liked 
so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva’s 
compositions, for their lucidity of style and com- 
plieated conceits were as pearls in bis sight, par- 
ticularly when in his reading he came upon court- 
ships and cartels, where he often found passages 
like: ‘The reason of the unreason with which 
my reason is afflicted, so weakens my reason that 
with reason I murmur at your beauty’’; or again: 
“The high heavens, that of your divinity di- 
vinely fortify you with-the stars, render you de- 
serving of the desert your greatness deserves.’’ 
Over coneeits of this sort the poor gentleman 
lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to 
understand them and worm the meaning out of 
them; what Aristotle himself could not have made 
out or extracted, had he come to life again for 
that special purpose. He was not at all easy about: 
the wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, 
because it seemed to him that, great as were the 
surgeons who had cured him, he must have had 
his face and body covered ali over with seams and 
sears. He commended, however, the author’s way 
of ending his book with the promise of that in- 
terminable adventure; and many a time was he 
tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly 
as is there proposed, which no doubt he would 
have done, and made a successful piece of work

  of it too, had not greater and more absorbing 
thoughts prevented him. 
Many an argument did he have with the curate 
of his village (a learned man, and a graduate of 
Siguenza), as to which had been the better knight, 
Palmerin of England or. Amadis of Gaul. Mas- 
ter Nicholas, the village barber, however,. used to 
say that neither of them came up to the Knight 
of Pheebus, and that if there was any could com- 
pare with him it was Don Galaor, the brother of 
Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that 
was equal to every oceasion, and was no finikin 
knight, nor lachrymose like his brother, while 
in the matter of valor he was not a whit behind 
him. In short, he became so absorbed in his 
books that he spent his nights from sunset to 
sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring 
over them; and what with little sleep and much 
reading his brains got so dry that he lost. his 
wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to 
read about in his books—enchantments, quarrels, 
battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies 
and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it -so 
possest his mind that the whole fabric of in- 
vention and fancy he read of was true, that to 
him no history in the world had more reality in 
it. He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very 
good knight, but that he was not to be com- 
pared with the Knight of the Burning Sword, 
who with one back-stroke eut in half two fierce 
and monstrous giants. He thought more of Ber- 
nardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew 
Roland in spite of enchantments, availing him- 
self of the artifice of Hercules when he strangled 
Antens the son of Terra in his arms. He ap-

  proved higkly of the giant Morgante, because 
altho of the giant breed, which is always arro- 
gant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and 
well bred. But above all he admired Reinaldos 
of Montalban; especially when he saw him sally- 
ing forth from his castle and robbing every one he 
met, and when beyond the seas he stole that 
image of Mohammed which, as history says, was 
entirely of gold. And to have a bout of kicking 
at that traitor of a Ganelon he would have given 
his housekeeper, and his niece into the bargain. 
In short, his wits were quite gone, he hit upon 
the strangest notion that ever madman in this 
world hit upon: and that was that he fancied 
it was right and requisite, as well for the support 
of his own honor as for the service of his country, 
that he should make a knight-errant of himself, 
roaming the world over in full armor and on 
horseback in quest of adventures, and putting in 
practise himself all that he had read of as being 
the usual practises of knights-errant; righting 
every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to 
peril and danger from which, i1 the issue, he was 
to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the 
poor man saw himself crowned, by the might of 
his arm, Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, 
led away by the intense enjoyment he found in 
these pleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith 
to put his scheme into execution. 
The first thing he did was to clean up some 
armor that had belonged to his great-grandfather, 
and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner, 
eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He 
scoured and polished it as best he could, but he 
perceived one great defect in it; that it had no 
222
-P-A-G-E-235
    MIGUEL DE CERVANTES 
  closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This 
deficiency, however, his ingenuity supplied, for 
he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard 
which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole 
one. It is true that in order to see if it was 
strong and fit to stand a cut he drew his sword 
and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which 
undid in an instant what had taken him a week 
todo, The ease with which he had knocked it to 
pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard 
against that danger he set to work again, fixing 
bars of iron on the inside until he was satisfied 
with its strength; and then, not caring to try 
any more experiments with it, he passed it and 
adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect con- 
struction. 
He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which 
with more quartos than a real and more blemishes 
than the steed of Gonela, that ‘‘tantum ellis et 
ossa fuit’’ surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus 
of Alexander or the Babieca of the Cid. Four 
days were spent in thinking what name to give 
him; because (as he said to himself) it was not 
right that a horse belonging to a knight so 
famous, and one with such merits of his own, 
shonld be without some distinctive name, and he 
strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had 
been before belonging to a knight-errant, and 
what he then was; for it was only reasonable 
that, his master taking a new character, he should 
take a new name, and that it should be a dis- 
tinguished and full-sounding one,. befitting the 
new order and calling he was about to follow.

OF HOW DON QUIXOTE DIED* 
As nothing that is man’s ean last forever, but 
all tends ever downward from its beginning to 
its end, and above ail, man’s life; and as Don 
Quixote’s enjoyed no special dispensation from 
Heaven to stay its course,—its end and close 
came when he least looked for it. For—whether 
it was of the dejection the thought of his defeat 
produced, or of Heaven’s will that so ordered it 
a fever settled upon him and kept him in his 
bed for six days, during which he was often vis- 
ited by his friends the curate, the bachelor, and 
the barber, while his good squire Sancho Panza 
never quitted his bedside. They, persuaded that 
it was grief at finding himself vanquished, and 
the object of his heart, the liberation and disen- 
ehantment of Dulcinea, unattained, that kept him 
in this state, strove by all the means in their power 
to cheer him up: the bachelor bidding him take 
heart and get up to begin his pastoral life; for 
which he himself, he said, had already composed 
an eclogue that would take the shine out of all 
Sannazaro* had ever written, and had bought 
with his own money two famous dogs to guard 
the flock, one called Bareino and the other But- 
ron, which a herdsman of Quintanar had sold him.

But for all this Don Quixote could not shake 
off his sadness. His friends called in the doctor, 
who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfied 
with it, and said that in any case it would be 
weli for him to attend to the health of his soul, 
3a that of his body was in a bad way. Don 
Quixote heard this calmly; but not so his house- 
keeper, his niece, and his squire, who fell weep- 
ing bitterly, as if they had him lying dead before 
them. The doctor’s opinion was that melancholy 
and depression were bringing him to his end. 
Don Quixote begged them to leave him to himself, 
-as he had a wish to sleep a little. They obeyed, 
and he slept at one stretch, as the saying is, 
more than six hours, so that the housekeeper and 
niece thought he was going to sleep forever. But 
at, the end of that time he woke up, and in a 
loud voice exclaimed, ‘‘Blest be Almighty God, 
who has shown me such goodness! In truth His 
mercies are boundless, and the sins of men can 
neither limit them nor keep them back!”? . . . 
They looked at one another, wondering at Don 
Quixote’s words; but, tho uncertain, they were 
inclined to believe him, and one of the signs by 
which they came to the conclusion he was dying 
was this so sudden and complete return to his 
senses after having been mad; for to the words 
already quoted he added much more, so well ex- 
prest, so devout, and so rational, as to banish all 
doubt and convince them that he was sound of 
mind. The curate turned them all out, and, left 
alone with him, confest him. The bachelor went 
for the notary, and returned shortly afterward 
with him and with Sancho, who, having already 
learned from the bachelor the condition his mas-

  ter was in, and finding the housekeeper and niece 
weeping, began to blubber and shed tears. 
The confession over, the curate came out say- 
ing: ‘‘ Alonso Quixano the Good is indeed dying, 
and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go 
in to him, while he makes his wiill.’’ 
This news gave a tremendous impulse to the 
brimming eyes of the housekeeper, niece, and 
Sancho Panza his good squire, making the tears 
burst from their eyes and a host of sighs from 
their hearts; for, of a truth, as has been said 
more than once, whether as plain Alonso Quixano 
the Good, or as Don Quixote of La Mancha, Don 
Quixote was always’ of a genile disposition and 
kindly in all his ways, and hence he was beloved 
not only by those of his own house, but by all 
who knew him. 
The notary came in with the rest, and as soon 
as the preamble of the will had been set out and 
Don Quixote had commended his soul to God with 
all the devout formalities that are usual, coming 
to the bequests, he said: ‘‘Item: It is my will 
that, touching certain moneys in the hands of 
Sancho Panza (whom in my madness I made my 
squire), inasmuch as between him and me there 
have been certain accounts and debits and eredits, 
no elaim be made against him, nor any account 
demanded of him in respect of them; but that if 
anything remain over and above, after he has 
paid himself what I owe him, the balance, which 
will be but little, shall be his, and much good 
may it do him; and if as when I was mad I had 
a share in giving him the government of an is- 
land, so now that I am in my senses could I give 
him that of a kingdom, it should be his, for the 
226

simplicity of his character and the fidelity of his 
eonduct deserve it.’? And then, turning to San- 
cho, he said, ‘‘Forgive me, my friend, that I led 
thee to seem as mad as myself, making thee 
fall into the same error I myself fell into, that 
there were and still are knights-errant in the 
world.’?” . 
“‘Ahl’’ said Sancho weeping; ‘‘don’t die, mas- 
ter, but take my advice and live many years; for 
the foolishest thing a man can do in this life 
is to let himself die-without rime or reason, with- 
out anybody killing him, or any hands but melan- 
choly’s making an end of him. Come, don’t be 
lazy, but get up from your bed and let us take 
to the fields in shepherd’s trim as we agreed. 
Perhaps behind some bush we shall find the lady 
Dulcinea disenchanted, as fine as fine can be. If 
it be that you are dying of vexation at having 
been vanquished, lay the blame on me, and say 
you were overthrown because I had girted Rosi- 
nante-badly; besides, you must have seen in your 
books of chivalry that it is a common thing for 
knights to upset one another, and for him who is 
conquered to-day to be conqueror to-morrow.’’ 
“Very true,’’ said Samson, ‘‘and good Sancho 
Panza’s view of these cases is quite right.’’ 
“Sirs, not so fast,’? said Don Quixote. ‘In 
last year’s nests there are no birds this year. T 
was-mad—now I am in my senses; I was Don 
Quixote of La Mancha—I am now, as I said, 
Alonso Quixano the Good; and may my repent- 
ance and sincerity restore me to the esteem you 
used to have for me; and now let Master Notary

then she shall forfeit the whole of what I have

having been, without intending it, the cause of

  haste to relieve him, and during the three days 
he lived after that on which he made his will, 
he fainted away very often. The house was all 
in eonfusion ; but still the niece ate and the house- 
keeper drank and Sancho Panza enjoyed himself; 
for inheriting property wipes out or softens down 
in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man 
might be expected to leave behind him. 
At last Don Quixote’s end came, after he had 
received all the sacraments, and had in full and 
forcible terms exprest his detestation of books of 
chivalry. The notary was there at the time, and 
he said that in no book of chivalry had he ever 
read of any knight-errant dying in his bed so 
calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, 
who, amid the tears and lamentations of all pres- 
ent, yielded up his spirit—that is to say, died. 
On perceiving it, the curate begged the notary to 
bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, ecom- 
monly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had 
passed away from this present life, and died nat- 
urally; and said he desired this testimony in 
order to remove the possibility of any other author 
save Cid Hamet Benengeli bringing him to life 
again falsely and making interminable stories out 
of his achievements. , 
Sueh was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman 
of La Mancha, whose village Cid Hamet would

towns and villazes of La Mancha to contend 
among themselves for the right to adopt him and 
claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece 
contended for Homer. The lamentations of San-

his tomb; Samson Carrasco, however, put. the fol- 
lowing: 
‘*A doughty gentleman lies here, 
A stranger all his life to fear; 
Nor in his death could Death prevail, 
In that last hour, to make him quail. 
He for the world but little cared, 
And at his feats the world was seared; 
A erazy man his life he passed, 
But in his senses died at last.’’

ANDERSEN 
Born in 1805; died in 1875; went to Copenhagen to become 
an actor, but, helped by friends, attended the university; 
published a volume of travels in 1828, poems and a play 
in 1829, and the first of his “Tales,” by which his fame 
abroad was established, in 1836; his “Autobiography” was 
published after his death. 
THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES' 
Many years ago there was an emperor, who 
was so excessively fond of new clothes that he 
spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble 
himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did 
he care to go either to the theater or the chase, 
except for the opportunities then afforded him 
for displaying his new clothes. He had a differ- 
ent suit for each hour of the day; and as of any 
other king or emperor one is accustomed to say, 
“He is sitting in council,’’ it was always said 
of him, ‘‘The Emperor is sitting in his ward- 
robe.’* : 
Time passed away merrily in the large. town 
which was his capital; strangers arrived every 
day at the court. One day two rogues, calling 
themselves weavers, made their appearance. 
They gave out that they knew how to weave 
stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate 
patterns, the clothes manufactured from which 
Andersen's ‘Tales’ have attracted many translators, 
among them Caroline Peachey, whose version is printed 
in the. Bohn Library. Another version is by Mrs. H. B. 
Paull,

should have the wonderful property of remaining 
invisible to every one who was unfit for the office 
he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in 
character. 
“These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!’’ 
thought the Emperor. ‘‘Had I such a suit, I 
might at once find out what men in my realm are 
unfit for their office, and also be able to distin- 
guish the wise from the foolish! This stuff 
must be woven for me immediately.’? And he 
caused large sums of money to be given to both 
the weavers, in order that they might begin their 
work directly. 
So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, 
and affected to work very’ busily, tho in reality 
they did nothing at all. They asked for the most 
delieate silk and the purest gold thread; put both 
into their own knapsacks; and then continued 
their pretended work at the empty looms until 
late at night. 
“T should like to know how the weavers are 
getting on with my cloth,’’ said the Emperor to 
himself, after some little time had elapsed; he 
was, however, rather embarrassed when he remem- 
bered that a simpleton, or one unfit for his office, 
would be unable to see the manufacture. ‘‘To 
be sure,’’ he thought, ‘‘he had nothing to risk 
in his own person; but yet he would prefer send- 
ing somebody else to bring him intelligence about 
the weavers and their work before he troubled 
himself in the affair.’’ All the people throughout 
the eity had heard of the wonderful property the 
cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to 
learn hew wise, or how ignorant, their neighbors 
might prove to be. 
232

  “T will send my faithful old minister to the 
weavers,”* said the Emperor at last, after some 
deliberation ; ‘‘he will be best able to see how the 
eloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no 
one ean be more suitable for his office than he is.’’ 
So the honest old minister went into the hall, 
where the knaves were working with all their 
might at their empty looms. ‘‘What can be the 
meaning of this?’’ thought the old man, opening 
his eyes very wide; ‘‘I can not discover the least 
bit of thread on the looms!’’ However, he did 
not express his thoughts aloud. 
The impostors requested him very courteously 
to be so good as to come nearer their looms; and 
then asked him whether the design pleased him, 
and whether the colors were not very beautiful; 
at same time pointing to the empty frames. The 
poor old minister looked and looked; he could 
not discover anything on the looms, for a very 
good reason, viz. there was nothing there. 
What!’’ thought he again, ‘‘is it possible that 
I am a simpleton? I have never thought so 
myself; and, at any rate, if I am so, no one 
must know it. Can it be that I am unfit for 
my office? No, that must not be said either. 
I will never confess that I could not see the 
stuff.’’ : 
‘¢Well, Sir Minister!’’ said one of the knaves, 
still pretending to work, ‘‘you do not say whether 
the stuff pleases you.’’ 
+ “Oh, it is admirable!’’ replied the old min- 
ister, looking at the loom through his spectacles. 
“This pattern, and the colors—yes, I will tell 
the Emperor without delay how very beautiful 
T think them.’’ 
233
-P-A-G-E-246
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  
‘¢We shall be much obliged to you,’’ said the 
impostors, and then they named the different col- 
ors and described the patterns of the pretended 
stuff. The old minister listened attentively to 
their words, in order that he might repeat them 
to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for 
more silk and gold, saying that it was necessary 
to complete what they had begun. However, they 
put all that was given them into their knapsacks, 
and continued to work with as much apparent 
diligence as before at their empty looms. 
_ {The Emperor now sent another officer of his 
eourt to see how the men were getting on, and 
to ascertain whether the eloth would soon be 
ready. It. was just the same with this gentleman 
as with the minister; he surveyed the looms on 
ali sides, but. could see nothing at all but: the 
empty frames. 
“Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you 
as it did to my lord the minister?’’ asked the 
impostors of the Emperor’s second ambassador; 
at. the same time making the same gestures as 
before, and talking of the design and colors which 
were not there. 
“‘T certainly am not stupid!’’ thought the mes- 
senger. ‘‘It must be that I am not fit for my 
good, profitable office! That is very odd; how- 
ever, no one shall know anything about it.’’? And 
accordingly he praised the stuff he could not see, 
and declared that he was delighted with both 
colors and patterns. ‘‘Indeed, please your Im- 
perial Majesty,’’ said he to his sovereign, when 
he returned, ‘‘the cloth whieh the weavers are 
preparing is extraordinarily magnificent.’’ 
The whole city was talking of the splendid 
234
-P-A-G-E-247
  HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN 
  eloth which the Emperor had ordered to be woven 
at his own expense. 
And now the Emperor himself wished to see 
the costly manufacture while it was still on the 
loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers 
of the court, among whom were the two honest 
men who had already admired the cloth, he went 
to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they 
were aware of the Emperor’s approach, went on 
working more diligently than ever; altho they 
still did not pass a single thread through the 
looms. : 
‘Ts not the work absolutely magnificent ?’’ said 
the two officers of the crown already mentioned. 
‘If your Majesty will only be pleased to look 
at it! what a splendid design! what glorious col- 
ors!?? and at the same time they pointed to the 
empty frames; for they imagined that every one 
but themselves could see this exquisite piece of 
workmanship. 
‘*How is this?’’ said the Emperor to himself; 
“T ean see nothing; this is, indeed, a terrible 
affair! Am I a simpleton? or am I unfit to be 
an Emperor? that would be the worst thing that 
could happen. Oh, the cloth is charming,’’ said 
he aloud; ‘‘it has my entire approbation.’’ And 
he smiled most graciously, and looked closely at 
the empty looms; for on no account would he 
say that he could not see what two of the officers 
of his court had praised so much. All his retinue 
now strained their eyes, hoping to discover some- 
thing on the looms, but they could see no more 
than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, 
“Oh! how beautiful!’’ and advised his Majesty 
to have some new clothes made from this splendid 
235

  material for the approaching procession. ‘‘Mag- 
nificent! charming! excellent!’’ resounded on all 
sides; and every one was uncommonly gay. The 
Emperor shared in the general satisfaction, and 
presented the impostors with the ribbon of an 
order of knighthood to be worn in their button- 
holes, and the title of ‘‘Gentlemen Weavers.’’ 
The rogues sat up the whole of the night before 
the day on which the procession was to take 
place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that 
every one might see how anxious they were to 
finish the Emperor’s new suit. They pretended 
to roll the cloth off the looms; eut the air with 
their scissors; and sewed with needles without 
any thread in them. ‘‘See!’’ eried they at last,

  ‘‘How splendid his Majesty looks in his new 
clothes! and how well they fit!’’ every one cried 
out. ‘‘What a design! what colors! these are, 
indeed, royal robes!’’ 
‘The canopy which is to be borne over your 
Majesty, in the procession, is waiting,’’? an- 
nounced the chief master of the ceremonies. 
‘“T am quite ready,’’? answered the Emperor. 
“Do my new clothes fit well?’’ asked he, turning 
himself round again before the looking-glass, in 
order that he might appear to be examining his 
handsome suit. 
The lords of the bed-chamber who were to 
earry his Majesty’s train, felt about on the 
ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of 
the mantle, and pretended to be carrying some- 
thing; for they would by no means betray any- 
thing like simplicity, or unfitness for their office. 
So now the Emperor walked under his high 
eanopy in the midst of the proeession, through 
the streets of his capital; and all the people 
standing by, and those at the windows, cried out, 
“Oh! how beautiful are our Emperor’s new 
clothes! what a magnificent train there is to the 
mantle! and how gracefully the scarf hangs!’’ 
in short, no one would allow that he could not seo 
these much-admired clothes, because, in doing so, 
he would have declared himself either a simpleton 
or unfit for his office. Certainly, none of the 
Emperor’s various suits had ever excited so much 
admiration as this. — 
‘*But the Emperor has nothing at all on!’’ 
said a little child. ‘‘Listen to the voice of in- 
nocence!’’? exclaimed his father; and what the 
child had said was whispered from one to another.

  ‘‘But he has nothing at all on!’’ at last cried 
out all the people. The Emperor was vexed, for 
he knew that the people were right; but he 
thought ‘‘the procession must go on now!’’ And 
the lords of the bed-chamber took greater pains 
than ever to appear holding up a train, altho, in 
reality, there was no train to hold.

BAZAROVW’S DEATH* 
Tus sound of a light carriage on springs—that 
sound which is peculiarly impressive in the wilds 
of the eountry—suddenly struck upon his hear- 
ing. Nearer and nearer rolled the light wheels; 
now even the neighing of the horses could be 
heard. Vassily Ivanovitch jumped up and ran 
to the little window. There drove into the court- 
yard of his little house a carriage with seats for 
two, with four horses harnessed abreast. With- 
out stopping to consider what it could mean, with 
a tush of a sort of senseless joy, he ran out on 
to the steps.. A groom in livery was opening the 
carriage door; a lady in a black veil and a black 
mantle was getting out of it. 
“T am Madame Odintsov,’’ she said. ‘‘Yev- 
geny Vassilyitch is still ving? You are his 
father? I have a doctor with me.’’ 
‘‘Benefactress!’’ cried Vassily Ivanovitch; and 
snatching her hand, he prest it convulsively to

  his lips; while the doctor brought: by Anna Ser- 
gyevna, a little man in spectacles, of German 
physiognomy, stept very deliberately out of the 
earriage. ‘‘Still living, my Yevgeny is still liv- 
ing, and now he will be saved! Wife! wife! An 
angel from heaven has come to us.’’ 
**What does it mean, good Lord!’’ faltered 
the old woman, running out of the drawing-rooin; 
and comprehending nothing, she fell on the spot 
at Anna Sergyevna’s feet, in the passage, and 
began kissing her garments like a madwoman. 
“‘What are you doing!’’ protested Anna Ser- 
gyevna; but Arina Vlasyevna did not heed her, 
while Vassily Ivanovitch could only repeat, ‘‘An 
angel! an angel!’’ 
“Wo ist der Kranke? [where is the patient ?]’’ 
said the doctor at last, with some impatience. 
Vassily Ivanovitch recovered himself. ‘‘ Here, 
here; follow me, wiirdigster Herr Collega,’’ re 
added through old associations. 
*‘Aht’? articulated the German, grinning sourly. 
Vassily Ivanovitch led him into the study. 
‘The doctor from Anna Sergyevna Odintsov,’’ 
he said, bending down quite to his son’s ear, 
‘tand she herself is here.’’ 
Bazarov suddenly opened his eyes. ‘‘What did 
you say?’ 
“I say that Anna Sergyevna is here; and has 
brought this gentleman, a doctor, to you.’ 
Bazarov moved his eyes about him. ‘‘She is 
here? I want to see her.’ 
**You shall see her, Yevgeny; but first we must 
have a little talk with the doctor. I will tell 
him the whole history of your illness, since Sidor 
Sidoritch*? (this was the name of the district 
240
-P-A-G-E-253

  doctor) ‘‘has gone; and we will have a little 
eonsultation.’” 
Bazarov glaneed at the German. ‘‘Well, talk 
sway quickly, only not in Latin: you see, I know 
the meaning of jam moritur.’’ 
“Der Herr scheint des Deutschen michtig zu 
sein,’’ began the new follower of Aiseulapius, 
turning to Vassily Ivanovitch. 
“Teh—habe—We had better speak Russian,’’ 
said the old man. 
“Ah, ah! so that’s how it is. To be sure--’’ 
And the consultation began. 
Half an hour later, Anna Sergyevna, conducted 
by Vassily Ivanovitch, came into the study. The 
doctor had had time to whisper to her that it 
was hopeless even to think of the patient’s re- 
covery. 
She looked at Bazarov—and stood still in the 
dvorway; so greatly was she imprest by the in- 
dlamed and at the same time deathly face, with 
its dim eyes fastened upon her. She felt simply 
dismayed, with a sort of cold and suffocating 
dismay: the thought that she would not have 
felt like that if she had really loved him flashed 
instantaneously through her brain. 
“‘Thanks,’’ he said painfully: ‘‘I did not ex- 
pect this. It’s a deed of mercy. So we have 
seen each other again, as you promised.’’ 
‘‘Anna Sergyevna has been se kind,’’ began 
Vassily Ivanovitch. 
‘Father, leave us alone. Anna Sergyevna, you 
will allow it, I faney, now?’’ 
With a motion of his head he indicated his 
prostrate helpless frame. 
Vassily Ivanovitch went out.

  ‘‘Well, thanks,’’ repeated Bazarov. ‘‘This is 
royally done. Monarchs, they say, visit the dying 
too.’? 
“Yevgeny Vassilyiteh, I hope—’’ 
‘*Ah, Anna Sergyevna, let us speak the truth. 
It’s all over with me. 1’m under the wheel. So 
it turns out that it was useless to think of the 
future. Death’s an old joke, but it comes fresh 
to every one. So far I’m not afraid—but there, 
senselessness is coming, and then it’s all up!’’ he 
waved his hand feebly. ‘‘Well, what had I to 
say to you? I loved you! There was no sense 
in that even before, and less than ever now. 
Love is a form, and my own form is already 
breaking up. Better say how lovely you are! 
And now here you stand, so beautiful—’’ Anna 
Sergyevna gave an involuntary shudder. ‘‘Never 
mind, don’t be uneasy. Sit down there. Don’t 
come close to me: you know my illness is 
eatching.’? 
Anna Sergyevna swiftly crossed the room, and 
sat down in the armchair near the sofa on which 
Bazarov was lying. 
‘‘Noble-hearted!’’ he whispered. ‘‘Oh, how 
near, and how young, and fresh, and pure—in 
this loathsome room! Well, good-by! live long— 
that’s the best of all—and make the most of it 
while there is time. You see what a hideous 
spectacle: the worm half-erusht, but writhing 
still, And you see, I thought too, I’d break down 
so many things: I wouldn’t die—why should I!— 
there were problems to solve, and I was a giant! 
And now all the problem for the giant is how to 
die decently—tho that makes no difference. Never 
mind: I’m not going to turn tail.’’

  Bazarov was silent, and began feeling with his 
hand for the glass. Auna Sergyevna gave him 
some drink: not taking off her glove, and drawing 
her breath timorously. 
“You will forget me,’’ he began again: ‘‘the 
dead’s no companion for the living. My father 
will tell you what a man Russia is losing. That’s 
nonsense, but don’t contradict the old man. 
Whatever toy will comfort the child—you know. 
And be kind to mother. People like them aren’t 
to be found in your great world if you look by 
daylight with a candle. I was needed by Russia. 
No, it’s clear, I wasn’t needed. And who is 
needed? The shoemaker’s needed, the tailor’s 
needed, the butcher—gives us meat—the butcher 
—wait a little, I’m getting mixt. There’s a forest 
here—’’ 
Bazarov put his hand to his brow. 
Anna Sergyevna bent down to him. ‘Yevgeny 
Vassilyitch, I am here—’’ 
He at once took his hand away, and raised 
himself. : 
**Good-by,’’ he said with sudden force, and 
his eyes gleamed with their last light. ‘‘Good-by. 
Listen—you know I didn’t kiss you then. 
Breathe on the dying lamp, and let it go out.'” 
Anna Sergyevna put her lips to his forehead. 
‘¢Enough!’’ he murmured, and dropt back on 
to the pillow. ‘‘Now—darkness—’’ 
Anna Sergyevna went softly out. ‘‘Well?’’ 
Vassily Ivanovitch asked her in a whisper. 
“*He has fallen asleep,’’ she answered, scarce 
audibly. Bazarov was not fated to awaken. To- 
ward evening he sank into complete unconscious- 
ness, and the following day he died. Father

  Alexey performed the last rites of religion over 
him. When they anointed him with the last unc- 
tion, when the holy oil touched his breast, one 
eye opened; and it seemed as tho at the sight of 
the priest in his vestments, the smoking censers, 
the light before the image, something like a shud- 
der of horror passed over the death-stricken face. 
When at last he had breathed his last, and there 
arose a universal lamentation in the house, Vas- 
sily Ivanoviteh was seized by a sudden frenzy. 
“(I said I should rebel,’’ he’ shrieked hoarsely, 
with his face inflamed and distorted, shaking his 
fist in the air, as tho threatening some one; ‘‘and 
.I rebel, I rebel!’?? But Arina Vlasyevna, all in 
tears, hung upon his neck, and both fell on their 
faces together. ‘‘Side by side,’’ Anfisushka re- 
lated afterward in the servants’ room, ‘‘they 
drooped their poor heads like lambs at noonday.’’ 
But the heat of noonday passes, and evening 
comes and night; and then, too, the return to the 
kindly refuge, where sleep is sweet for the weary 
and heavy-laden.

King Skule [quickly, as if shaking off his 
thoughts]—Where are my weapons? I will fight 
and act, not think. What was it you would have 
told me when you came? 
Jatgeir—’Twas what I noted in my lodgings.

make a song of it as strong as the deed itself. 
King Skule—Have you many unmade songs 
within you, Jatgeir? 
Jatgeir—Nay, but many unborn; they are con- 
eeived one after the other, come to life, and 
are brought forth. 
King Skule—And if I, who am king and have 
the might—if I were to have you slain, would 
all the unborn skald-thoughts within you die along 
with you? 
Jatgeir—My lord, it is a great sin to slay a 
fair thought. 
King Skule—I ask not if it be a sin: I ask if 
it be possible! 
Jatgeir—I know not. 
King Skule—Have you never had another skald 
for your friend, and has he never unfolded to 
you a great and noble song he thought to make? 
Jatgeir—Yes, lord. 
King Skule—Did you not then wish that you 
could slay him, to take his thought and make the 
song yourself? 
Jatgeir—My lord, I am not barren: I have 
children of my own; I need not to love those 
of other men. [Goes.] 
King Skule [after a pause|]—The Icelander is 
‘in very deed a skald. He speaks God’s deepest 
truth and knows it not. I am as a barren woman. 
Therefore I love Hakon’s kingly thought-child, 
love it with the warmest passion of my soul. 
Oh that I could but adopt it! It would die in 
my hands. Which were best, that it should die 
in my hands or wax great in his? Should I 
ever have peace of soul if that came to pass? 
Can I forego all? Can I stand by and see Hakon

King Skule—Bid him come hither. [Goes for-

ean not sleep, Jatgeir: ’tis all my great kingly 
thoughts that keep me awake, you see. 
Jatgeir— Tis with the king’s thoughts as with 
the skald’s, I doubt not. They fly highest and 
grow quickest when there is night and stillness 
around. 
King Skule—Is it so with the skald’s thoughts? 
Jatgeir—Ay, lord: no song is born by daylight; 
it may be written down in the sunshine, but it 
makes itself in the silent night. 
King Skule—Who gave you the gift of sorrow, 
Jatgeir? 
Jatgeir—She whom I loved. 
King Skule—She died, then? 
Jatgeir—No, she deceived me. 
King Skule—And then you became a skald? 
Jatgeir—Ay, then I became a skala? 
King Skule [seizes him by the arm]—What gift 
do I need to become a king? 
Jatgeir—Not the gift of doubt; else would you 
not question so. 
King Skule—What gift do I need? 
Jatgeir—My lord, you are a king. 
King Skule—Have you at all times full faith 
that you are a skald?

Jatgeir—You would have to search long for

Born in 1828; éducated at the University of Kazan; served 
in the army and commander of a battery in the Crimea im 
1855, being present at the storming of Sebastopol; sent as a 
special courier to St. Petersburg; lived on his estate after 
the liberation of the serfs, working with the peasants and 
devoting himself to literary work; published “War and 
Peace” in 1865-68, “Anna Karenina” in 1875-78, “Sebasto-

SHAKESPEARE NOT A GREAT GENIUS* 
I remember the astonishment I felt’ when TF 
first read Shakespeare. I expected to receive 
a powerful esthetic pleasure, but having read, 
one after the other, works regarded as his best: 
‘*Ring Lear,’’ ‘‘Romeo and Juliet,’’ ‘‘Hamlet’’ 
and ‘‘Macbeth,’’ not only did I feel no delight, 
but I felt an irresistible repulsion and tedium, 
and doubted as to whether I was senseless in 
feeling works regarded as the summit of per- 
fection by the whole of the civilized world to 
be trivial and positively bad, or whether the 
significance which this civilized world attrib- 
utes to the works of Shakespeare was itself 
senseless. My consternation was inereased by 
the fact that I, always keenly felt the beauties 
of poetry in every form; then why should artistie 
works recognized by the whole world as those 
1¥rom “A Critical Essay on Shakespeare,” published in 
1907. 
252
-P-A-G-E-265
  COUNT LEO TOLSTOY 
  of a genius—the works of Shakespeare—not only 
fail to please me, but be disagreeable to me? 
For a long time I could not believe in myself, 
and during fifty years, in order to test myself, 
I several times recommenced reading Shake- 
speare in every possible form, in Russian, in 
English, in German and in Schlegel’s trans- 
lation, as I was advised. Several times I read. 
the dramas and the comedies and historical plays, 
and I invariably underwent the same feelings: 
repulsion, weariness, and bewilderment. At the 
present time, being desirous once more to test 
myself, I have, as an old man of seventy-five, 
again read the whole of Shakespeare, including 
the historical plays, the ‘‘Henrys,’’ ‘‘Troilus and 
Cressida,’’ the ‘‘Tempest,’’ ‘‘Cymbeline,’’ and 
I have felt, with even greater force, the same 
feelings—this time, however, not of bewilder- 
ment, but of firm, indubitable convietion that the 
unquestionable glory of a great genius which 
Shakespeare enjoys, and which compels writers 
of our time to imitate him and readers and spec- 
tators to discover in him non-existent merits— 
thereby distorting their esthetic and ethical un- 
derstanding—is a great evil, as is every untruth. 
Altho I know that the majority of people so 
firmly believe in the greatness of Shakespeare 
that in reading this judgment of mine they will 
not admit even the possibility of its justice, and 
will not give it the slightest attention, never- 
theless I will endeavor, as well as I ean, to show 
why I believe that Shakespeare ean not be recog- 
nized either as a great genius, or even as an 
average author. : - 
However hopeless it may seem, I will endeavor 
253
-P-A-G-E-266
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS   
_to demonstrate in the selected drama— ‘King 
Lear’’—all those faults equally characteristic 
also of all the other tragedies and comedies of 
Shakespeare, on account of which he not only 
is not representing a model of dramatie art, but 
does not satisfy the most elementary demands 
of art recognized by all. 
Dramatie art, according to the laws established 
by those very erities who extol Shakespeare, de- 
mands that the persons represented in the play 
should be, in consequence of actions proper to 
their characters, and owing to a natural course 
of events, placed in positions requiring them to 
struggle with the surrounding world to which 
they find themselves in opposition, and in this 
struggle should display their inherent qualities. 
In ‘King Lear’’ the persons represented are 
indeed placed externally in opposition to the 
outward world, and they struggle with it. But 
their strife does not flow from the natural course 
of events nor from their own characters, but is 
quite arbitrarily established by the author, and 
therefore can not produce on the reader the illu- 
sion which represents the essential condition of 
art. 
Lear has no necessity or motive for his abdiea- 
tion; also, having lived all his life with his daugh- 
ters, has no reason to believe the words of the 
two elders and not the truthful statement of 
the youngest; yet upon this is built the whole 
tragedy of his position. 
Similarly unnatural is the subordinate action: 
the relation of Gloucester to his sons. The posi- 
tions of Gloucester and Edgar flow from the 
circumstance that Gloucester, just like Lear, im- 
254
-P-A-G-E-267
A 
COUNT LEO TOLSTOY 
  mediately believes the coarsest untruth and does 
not even endeavor to inquire of his injured son 
whether what he is aecused of be true, but at 
once curses and banishes him. The fact that 
Lear’s relations with his daughters are the same 
as those of Gloucester to his sons makes one 
feel yet more strongly that in both cases the 
relations are quite arbitrary, and du not flow 
from the ebaracters nor the natural course of 
events. Equally unnatural, and obviously in- 
vented, is the fact that all through the tragedy 
Lear does not recognize his old courtier, Kent, 
and therefore the relations between Lear and 
Kent fail to excite the sympathy of the reader 
or spectator. The same, in a yet greater degree, 
holds trne of the position of Edgar, who, un- 
recognized by any one, leads his blind father 
and persuades him that he has leapt off a cliff, 
when in reality Gloucester jumps on level ground. 
These positions, into which the characters are 
placed quite arbitrarily, are so unnatural that 
the reader or spectator is unable not only to 
sympathize with their sufferings but even to be 
interested in what he reads or sees. This in the 
first place. 
‘Secondly, in this, as in the other dramas of 
Shakespeare, all the characters live, think, speak, 
‘and act quite unconformably with the given 
time and place. The action of ‘‘King Lear’? 
takes place 800 years B.c., and yet the characters 
are placed in conditions possible only in the 
Middle Ages: participating in the drama are 
Kings, dukes, armies, and illegitimate children, 
and gentlemen, courtiers, doctors, farmers, of- 
fieers, soldiers, and knights with vizors, ete. It 
255

  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  is possible that such anachronisms (with. whieh 
Shakespeare’s dramas abound) did not injure the 
possibility of illusion in the sixteenth century 
and the beginning of the seventeenth, but in 
our time it is no longer possible to follow with 
interest the development of events which one 
knows could not take place in the conditions 
which the author describes in detail. The artiii- 
ciality of the positions, not flowing from the 
natural course of events, or from the nature of 
the characters, and their want of conformity with 
time and space, is further increased by those 
coarse embellishments which are continually 
added by Shakespeare and intended to-appear- 
partieularly touching. The extraordinary storm 
during which King Lear roams about the heath, 
or the grass which for some reason he puts on 
his head—like Ophelia in ‘‘Hamlet’’—or Edgar’s 
attire, or the fool’s speeches, or the appearance 
of the helmeted horseman, Edgar—all these ef- 
fects not only fail to enhance the impression, 
but produce an opposite effect. ‘‘Man sieht die 
Absicht. und man wird verstimmt,’’ as Goethe 
says. It often happens that even during these 
obviously intentional efforts after effect, as, for 
instance, the dragging out by the legs of half a 
dozen corpses, with which all Shakespeare’s trag- 
edies terminate, instead of feeling fear and pity, 
one ig tempted rather to laugh.

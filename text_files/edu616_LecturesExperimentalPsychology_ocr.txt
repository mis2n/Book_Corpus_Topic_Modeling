PREFACE 
N a course of lectures on the elementary psy- 
chology of Feeling and Attention, published 
last year, I remarked that “the system of psy- 
chology rests upon a threefold foundation: the 
doctrine of sensation and image, the elementary 
doctrine of feeling,and the doctrine of attention.” 
This statement, which formed the basis of my 
whole discussion, was promptly challenged by re- 
viewers. I was misled, they affirmed, by a sen- 
sationalistic bias; I should have taken account of 
current experimental work upon the thought- 
processes; I had no right to assume that all 
intellection is imaginal in character. 
I could not but acknowledge the essential jus- 
tice of this criticism, although I could not either 
accept my critics’ point of view. I was, indeed, 
engaged in writing a brief defence of psycho- 
logical sensationalism, when [I received an invi- 
tation to deliver a series of lectures at the 
University of Illinois. Here was an opportunity, 
of which I gladly availed myself, to treat in 
some little detail of the recent experimental con- 
tributions to the psychology of thought. The 
present volume is the result.

  vill PREFACE 
I have printed the lectures as they were written 
for delivery at the University of Illinois, in 
March, 1909. In the appended notes, I have 
allowed myself a freedom of reference and com- 
ment somewhat wider than before. The presence 
of the notes at the end of the book need not 
disturb the general reader, while their fulness 
may prevent certain minor misunderstandings to 
which the Feeling and Attention has been ex- 
posed. I have, however, made it a rule to leave 
out of consideration all experimental work that 
is concerned simply with association and repro- 
duction, and all purely theoretical studies of the 
thought-consciousness. Where the dividing line 
is at all obscure, I have, it is true, not hesitated 
to transgress. Still, the psychological reader 
will miss much that, without this limitation of 
purpose, he might reasonably expect to find. 
My thanks are due to my wife; to Professor 
S. S. Colvin, of the University of Illinois, whose 
invitation gave occasion for the writing of the 
lectures; to many friends, at Urbana and at 
Ithaca, among whom I may name Professor J. 
W. Baird, Dr. L. R. Geissler, and Dr. W. H. 
Pyle; and especially to my colleague, Professor 
I. M. Bentley, who has read the manuscript of 
the book, has constantly assisted me during its

preparation with criticism and positive sugges- 
tion, and by his sacrifice of time and energy has 
made it possible for me to bring my task to early 
completion. In dedicating the volume to Pro- 
fessor Bentley, I wish to express my gratitude 
for the help that he has generously rendered, not 
only in this particular case, but in all my literary 
undertakings of the past dozen years.

    LECTURE I 
IMAGERY AND SENSATIONALISM 
F I chance to be reflecting on the progress of 
science, there is likely to arise before my 
mind’s eye a scene familiar to my childhood,—the 
flow of the incoming tide over a broad extent of 
sandy shore. The whole body of water is press- 
ing forward, irresistibly, as natural law decrees. 
But its front is not unbroken; for the sand is 
rock-strewn and uneven, so that here there are 
eddying pools of unusual depth, and there, again, 
long fingers of the sea stretched out towards the 
land. My mind, as I shall presently show in 
more detail, is prone to imagery; and this image, 
of check and overflow in the van of a great 
movement, has come to represent for me the 
progress of science. 
You will take my meaning, even if you do not 
see my picture. Scientific knowledge is steadily 
and continuously increasing; but the men who 
stand for science are likely, at any given time, 
to be dominated by a few particular interests. 
Sometimes a brilliant discovery or a daring the- 
ory opens up a pean line of investigation ;
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 IMAGERY AND SENSATIONALISM 
sometimes suggestion seems to spring of itself 
from the mere accumulation of facts. Striking 
illustrations, under both of these heads, are fur- 
nished by the physics and the biology of the past 
decade. Illustrations at least as striking, al- 
though less generally known, are furnished by 
our Own growing science of experimental psy- 
chology. A few years ago, it seemed that every- 
body was interested in kinesthetic sensations. 
Then the geometrical illusions of vision had 
their day. ‘Then we were all running to the 
study of memory and association. Then the 
affective processes came to the forefront of  dis- 
cussion. And all the while the experimental 
method was doing its appointed work over the 
whole face of the science. 
Just now, it might fairly be argued that the 
centre of interest for the experimental psycholo- 
gist lies in the field of thought. Current ten- 
dencies are oftentimes difficult to explain, simply 
because we lack perspective; and I do not find 
explanation easy in the present case. Yet there 
must have been, at the beginning of the twen- 
tieth century, something in the psychological 
atmosphere that was peculiarly favourable to 
thought.* We may point, perhaps, to the grad- 
ual and increasing recognition of the value of 
introspection, with its promise of a wide exten- 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  
THE PROBLEM OF THOUGHT 5 
sion of the experimental method: for if the 
psychological experiment is, in essentials, a con- 
trolled introspection, and if our instruments of 
precision are but means to that control, the 
method may evidently be carried into every re- 
gion of consciousness.” We may think, also, of 
the publication of Wundt’s great work on lan- 
guage, and of its challenge to the experiment- 
alists.- “Fortunately for the science,” Wundt 
writes, “there are sources of objective psycho- 
logical knowledge, which become accessible at 
the very point where the experimental method 
fails us. These are certain products of the com- 
mon life, in which we may trace the operation of 
determinate psychical motives: chief among them 
are language, myth and custom.”* Here is a 
limit set to the applicability of experiment; and 
to set a bound is directly to challenge a trespass. 
We may think, once more, of the stimulus re- 
ceived from workers in neighbouring fields of 
logic and Gegenstandstheorie, from Lipps and 
Erdmann, from Husserl and Meinong.® We may 
remember that the human mind is for ever swing- 
ing between extremes, and we may suppose that 
the time had come for a reaction against ‘sensa- 
tionalism.’® Here are motives enough, if we 
could trace their several influences,—and if we 
could be sure that they are motives: if, I mean,
-P-A-G-E-16
6 IMAGERY AND SENSATIONALISM 
we could be sure that they are not themselves 
symptoms of a general movement, which has 
involved experimental psychology as it has in- 
volved the mental sciences at large. However 
that may be, the fact is there. Binet in France, 
Marbe and his successors in Germany, Wood- 
worth in the United States, have all sought to 
bring the processes of thought under the con- 
trol of the experimental method. And all alike 
have reached the conclusion, each independ- 
ently for himself, that the experience of thought 
is not adequately described in the orthodox text- 
books of psychology. 
It is of these men, of their views and their 
work, that I am to speak in the lectures now be- 
gun. I shall report, as impartially as I may, 
their results and their interpretations; and I 
shall then outline my own understanding of the 
whole matter. But we cannot come, all in a 
moment, to close quarters with the experiments. 
There are certain prior questions that must be 
asked and answered; and I devote this and the 
following Lecture to their discussion. 
I 
First of all, there is the question of individual 
differences, differences of mental constitution. 
The creation of a scientific psychology of these
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE IMAGINAL MIND 7 
differences is, in my opinion, one of the prin- 
cipal achievements of the experimental method ;‘ 
and I believe that a frank acceptance of the 
teachings of differential psychology will go 
far to allay some of the perennial controversies 
of the text-books. At all events, I do not see 
how one can: fairly approach the psychology of 
thought, whether as critic or as expositor, with- 
out taking account of the machinery of thought 
in one’s own case. I said just now that I should 
try to be impartial; and I can offer no better 
guarantee of good faith than to confess my 
constitutional bias. I propose, therefore, to turn 
out my mind for your inspection. I can give 
you nothing systematic, nothing that has been 
verified by experiment; but the account will be 
correct, so far as it goes, and will suffice for our 
present purpose. 
My mind, then, is of the imaginal sort,—I 
wish that we had a better adjective!—and my 
ideational type is of the sort described in the 
psychologies as mixed. I have always had, and 
I have always used, a wide range and a great 
variety of imagery; and my furniture of images 
is, perhaps, in better than average condition, 
because—fearing that, as one gets older, one 
tends also to become more and more verbal in 
- type*—I have made a point of renewing it by,
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 IMAGERY AND SENSATIONALISM 
practice. I am able now, for instance, as I was 
able when I entered the class-room nearly twenty 
years ago, to lecture from any one of the three 
main cues. I can read off what I have to say 
from a memory manuscript; or I can follow the 
lead of my voice; or I can trust to the guidance 
of kinesthesis, the anticipatory feel of the move: 
ments of articulation.’ J use these three methods 
under different circumstances. When it is a 
matter of preparing a lecture on a definite plan, 
of dividing and subdividing under various head- 
ings, I draw up in the mind’s eye a table of con- 
tents, written or printed, and refer to it as the 
hour proceeds. When there is any difficulty in 
exposition, a point to be argued pro and con or 
a conclusion to be brought out from the conver- 
gence of several lines of proof, I hear my own 
voice speaking just ahead of me: an experience 
which, in the description, sounds as if it should 
be confusing, but which in reality is precisely the 
reverse. When, again, I come to a piece of 
straightforward narrative, I let my throat take 
care of itself; so that I am able to give full atten- 
tion to blackboard drawing or to the manipula- 
tion of instruments on the table. As a rule, I 
look to all three kinds of prompting in the course 
of a single hour. At times, however, some one 
method is followed exclusively: thus, when I am
-P-A-G-E-19
    THE IMAGINAL MIND 9 
tired, I find that vision and audition are likely to 
lapse, and I am left alone with kinesthesis. 
When I am working for myself, reading or 
writing or thinking, I experience a complex in- 
terlacing of imagery which it is difficult to 
describe, or at any rate to describe with the just 
emphasis. My natural tendency is to employ 
internal speech; and there are occasions when my 
voice rings out clearly to the mental ear and my 
throat feels stiff as if with much talking. But 
in. general the internal speech is reduced to a 
faint flicker of articulatory movement. This 
may be due, in part, to the fact that I am a very 
rapid reader, and have tried to acquire the power 
of purely visual reading.'® But it is also due, I 
am sure, to the fact that I have vivid and per- 
sistent auditory imagery. If. I may venture on 
a very sweeping statement, I should say that I 
never sit down to read a book, or to write a para- 
graph, or to think out a problem, without a 
musical accompaniment. Usually the accom- 
paniment is orchestral, with a preponderance of 
the wood-wind,—I have a sort of personal affec- 
tion for the oboe; sometimes it is in the tone- 
colour of piano or violin; never, I think, is it 
vocal, Usually, again, it is the reproduction of 
a known composition; on rare occasions it is 
wholly unfamiliar. I am not aware that I make
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 IMAGERY AND SENSATIONALISM 
any use of this musical imagery, though I should 
be sorry to lose it, and I can offer no explana- 
tion of its arousal." However, the important 
point in the present connection is, simply, that 
its freakish appearance has, without doubt, 
tended to repress the auditory factor in internal 
speech. 
These musical and verbal images crop up of 
their own accord. I have never sought to con- 
trol the former; I have, as I said just now, some- 
what weakened the latter by my effort after 
purely visual reading. I turn now to the topic 
of visual imagery, which is always at my dis- 
posal and which I can mould and direct at will.” 
I rely, in my thinking, upon visual imagery in 
the sense that I like to get a problem into some 
sort of visual schema, from which I can think my 
way out and to which I can return. As I read 
an article, or the chapter of a book, I instinc- 
tively arrange the facts or arguments in some 
visual pattern, and I am as likely to think in 
terms of this pattern as I am to think in words. 
I understand, and to that extent I enjoy, an 
author whom I can thus visualise. Contrariwise, 
an author whose thought is not susceptible to my 
visual arrangement appears to me to be obscure 
and involved; and an author who has an arrange- 
ment of his own, which crosses the pattern that
-P-A-G-E-21
  VISUAL SCHEMATA 11 
I am forming in my mind, appears to me diffi- 
cult and, to that extent, unenjoyable. Hence 
my standard of clarity and consistency is, in the 
last resort, visual. A writer may be discussing 
a highly complicated question; but if he is what 
I call clear, I can follow and understand him; 
his pattern is complex, but it may be traced. On 
the other hand, a writer may be discoursing in 
the easiest popular fashion; but if he is what I 
call obscure, if I cannot trace his pattern, I am 
baffled by him. I must then go to my friends, or 
to printed reviews of his work, and try to pick 
up a pattern at second hand.** 
You will understand that this visual frame- 
work of thought is both an advantage and a 
limitation. What I know, I know clearly; and 
what I have once understood, I am likely to re- 
member. But there are disadvantages. The 
task of composition, for example, is for me 
extremely laborious. Words come quickly and 
readily enough; I have only to let them come, in 
terms of internal speech. But then the words 
are apt to switch me off the visual track, to 
entangle me in secondary arguments, to bring 
up irrelevant associations; [ cannot trust myself 
to think simply in words; indeed, I sometimes 
doubt, as I read over my rough draughts, if there 
ever was a psychologist who could make so many
-P-A-G-E-22
  
  12 IMAGERY AND SENSATIONALISM 
loose-ended statements in so few pages as I can. 
This defect prescribes its own remedy. More 
serious is the temptation to allow one’s visual 
schemata to harden, to become rigid. I have 
constantly to fight against the tendency to pre- 
mature systematisation. 
The term ‘visual schema’ is, of course, itself 
equivocal. Those of you whose minds are built 
on the same general plan as my own will know 
well enough what it means. But I must warn 
the others, to whom this sort of imagery is un- 
known, not to think of a geometrical figure 
printed black on white, or of anything a hun- 
dredth part as definite. I should be sorely 
puzzled to say what colours appear in my sche- 
_ mata, and I certainly could not draw on paper my 
pattern of a particular writer or a particular 
book. I get a suggestion of dull red, and I get 
a suggestion of angles rather than curves; I get, 
pretty clearly, the picture of movement along 
lines, and of neatness or confusion where the 
moving lines come together. But that is all,— 
all, at least, that ordinary introspection reveals. 
The hardening and rigidity, against which I am 
always on guard, is not a fixation of the schema 
as visual outline, but its fixation as meaning, as 
the meaning of something read or heard or 
thought. I wish to be clear on this point: the 
visual pattern does not indifferently accompany,
-P-A-G-E-23
VISUAL SYMBOLISM 13 
but is or equals, my gross understanding of the 
matter in hand. 
My visual imagery, voluntarily aroused as for 
Galton’s breakfast-table test, is extremely vivid, 
though it seems bodiless and papery when com- 
pared with direct perception. I have never, so 
far as I am aware, experienced a visual hallu- 
cination; I have no number-form; I know noth- 
ing of coloured hearing. On the other hand, my 
mind, in its ordinary operations, is a fairly com- 
plete picture gallery,—not of finished paintings, 
but of impressionist notes. Whenever I read or 
hear that somebody has done something mod- 
estly, or gravely, or proudly, or humbly, or 
courteously, I see a visual hint of the modesty or 
gravity or pride or humility or courtesy. The 
stately heroine gives me a flash of a tall figure, 
the only clear part of which is a hand holding up 
a steely grey skirt; the humble suitor gives me a 
flash of a bent figure, the only clear part of 
which is the bowed back, though at times there 
are hands held deprecatingly before the absent 
face. A great many of these sketches are irrele- 
vant and accessory; but they often are, and they 
always may be, the vehicles of a logical meaning. 
The stately form that steps through the French 
window to the lawn may be clothed in all the 
colours of the rainbow; but its stateliness is the  
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 IMAGERY AND SENSATIONALISM 
hand on the grey skirt. I shall not multiply 
instances. All this description must be either 
self-evident or as unreal as a fairy-tale." 
It leads us, however, to a very important 
question,—the old question of the possibility of 
abstract or general ideas. You will recall the 
main heads of the controversy. Locke had main- 
tained that it is possible to form the general 
idea, say, of a triangle which is “neither oblique 
nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor 
scalenon; but all and none of these at once.’?!® 
Berkeley replied that “if any man has the faculty 
of framing in his mind such an idea of a triangle, 
as is here described, it is in vain to pretend to 
dispute him out of it, nor would I go about it.... 
For myself, I find indeed I have a faculty of 
imagining, or representing to myself, the ideas 
of those particular things I have perceived, and 
of variously compounding and dividing them, 
... [but] I cannot by any effort of thought 
conceive the abstract idea described above. .. . 
The idea of man that I frame to myself must be 
either of a white, or a black, or a tawny, a 
straight, or a crooked, a tall, or a low, or a 
middle-sized man.”*® The dispute has lasted 
down to our own day. MHamilton calls the 
Lockean doctrine a ‘revolting absurdity.’ 
Huxley finds it entirely acceptable. “An anat-

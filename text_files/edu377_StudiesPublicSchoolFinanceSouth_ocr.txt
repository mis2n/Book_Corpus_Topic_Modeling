  PREFACE 
In the last analysis, a large proportion of the educational difficulties 
existing in the majority of our states today are financial and are due funda- 
mentally to antiquated systems of school finance. Methods and policies 
inherited from colonial times are still followed in many of our states, despite 
the fact that their inevitably disastrous effects have been pointed out again 
and again by students of school finance. Rapidly growing demands for 
vastly increased expenditures make reform imperative, but before we can 
undertake to formulate and adopt new laws and new policies, it is necessary 
to know those now in force and to discover the effects of the same. Never- 
theless, at the present time, such knowledge is exceedingly difficult to obtain. 
Indeed, there are states in our Union in which not a single official report 
shows the total expenditures for public schools and in almost no case is 
there any presentation of the principles upon which the system of finance 
employed is based. 
In school finance as in other fields of human endeavor, procedure, to be 
sound, must be based upon scientific principles. Such principles in the pres- 
ent case can be formulated only on the basis of a complete and detailed 
knowledge of the systems of school support in a considerable number of 
individual states. With a view to making such knowledge available the 
writer began as long ago as 1915 the preparation of a series of studies of 
the systems of school support employed in certain selected states. Since that 
time he has completed a considerable number of such studies, and graduate 
students under his direction have made others. 
The studies presented in the following pages constitute the final volume 
of a series published in four volumes by the University of Minne- 
sota, as follows: Volume I. The West: School Finance in California and 
Colorado; Volume II. The East: School Finance in Massachusetts, New 
York, and New Jersey; Volume III. The Middle West: School Finance in 
Illinois, Minnesota, and South Dakota—with a Supplement on School Fi- 
nance in Alaska; Volume IV. The South: School Finance in Arkansas, 
Oklahoma, Alabama, and Tennessee. 
The four states around which the present volume centers, offer a marked 
contrast to those included in the first three volumes of the present series, 
whether viewed from the standpoint of educational achievement or from 
that of policies of school support. The states treated in the earlier vol- 
umes, despite many shortcomings, nevertheless on the whole ranked well 
up in the national scale of educational achievement and support. Alabama, 
Arkansas, and Tennessee, on the other hand, rank near the lower end of 
the educational scale in almost every respect. Their school terms are  
-P-A-G-E-6
  vi PREFACE 
among the shortest in the United States, their teachers among the most 
poorly paid and poorly prepared, and their expenditures among the most 
inadequate. Despite certain well-recognized defects in Ayres’ index number 
for state school systems, the ranks he assigned to the various states are 
worthy of careful consideration. According to Ayres, in 1918, Oklahoma 
ranked thirty-third among our forty-eight states in educational achieve- 
ment, Tennessee fortieth, Alabama forty-fifth, and Arkansas forty-sixth. 
The school conditions which exist in these states, largely as an outcome 
of their present systems of school finance, are a menace to American insti- 
tutions. In Arkansas, in 1920, 28 children out of every 100 of school age 
were not even enrolled in school and approximately 32 out of every 100 
enrolled did not attend school. In that same year, in North Little Rock, 
the second largest city in the state (population, 14,000) there was not a 
single public school open one day in the year as a free school. Of the 
eleven cities in the state having a population of 10,000 or more, five reported 
their schools to be in debt for maintenance an amount equal to, or greater 
than, the equivalent of one year’s income. Six of the eleven reported that 
tuition is charged. Multitudes of school districts either maintain no schools 
or else maintain their schools as free schools for a part of the year and as 
tuition schools for the remainder. 
Space does not permit even a cursory review of the conditions found 
in the educational dark spots of Alabama, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. The 
last named state, in 1920, ranked twelfth in the Union with respect to 
estimated true wealth per school child, but only thirtieth as to school 
expenditure per child. In 1921, more than r1ooo rural and village white 
districts maintained schools for six months or less, and 5 districts out of 
every 100 maintained schools for five months or less. The law requires 
every school to have a school flag, yet out of 17 consolidated schools visited, 
only 3 possessed flags. 
To the conditions already described as existing in Oklahoma and Arkan- 
sas, others might be added: The writer might describe not one but many 
school rooms where all the time a considerable portion of the pupils were 
obliged to stand because there were not enough seats for all; city ele- 
mentary grades taught by one teacher, where the average attendance was 
80; a one-room rural school where 160 children were enrolled under one 
teacher, and many communities whose school authorities exclaimed, “En- 
force the compulsory education law! Why, we can’t take care of those 
who come to school now. What would we do if the law were enforced?” 
The four states included in the present volume offer many interesting 
likenesses and many interesting contrasts. All four are dominantly rural 
states. The educational situation of each is rendered especially difficult 
by racial problems and extensive illiteracy. All four were carved out of
-P-A-G-E-7

public domain and consequently upon admission to the Union received from 
the Federal government princely endowments for public schools. But of 
the four, Oklahoma is the only one which has preserved this endowment 
inviolate. In the remaining three, what was designed to be a permanent 
endowment to ease the school burdens of succeeding generations, exists 
today entirely or almost entirely as a state debt or credit fund, whose 
interest must be paid out of the proceeds of state taxes. 
Each of these states derives the major portion of its school revenue 
from local taxation, but by unwarranted restrictions on tax rates and by 
low evaluations, makes impossible the providing of adequate funds. As a 
result, in many communities, schools are not free. Patrons’ gifts and stu- 
dents’ fees provide a small but very significant portion of the funds. Many 
of the facilities which in other states are provided at public cost, are sub- 
sidized by funds provided by private foundaions, of which the most im- 
portant are the General Education Board, the Phelps-Stokes fund, the 
Jeanes fund, and the Rosenwald fund. In Arkansas, the General Education 
Board provides 52.5 per cent of the moneys expended on the State De- 
partment of Education. 
Alabama, Oklahoma, and Arkansas apportion their state general school 
funds on the basis of school population, one of the most antiquated, un- 
sound, and unfair methods now employed. Tennessee is the only one 
which employs any portion of her state revenue as an equalization fund. 
It seems necessary to warn the reader of the present volume from 
drawing the conclusion that as far as policies of school finance are con- 
cerned, the South must be regarded as a Nazareth, whence no good thing 
can come. On the contrary, there is probably, at the present writing, no 
state in the Union that has adopted a more satisfactory or more scientific 
method of state aid than Maryland. Worthy also of careful study are the 
policies of Delaware and North Carolina. 
Of the accounts included in the present study those of Arkansas and 
Oklahoma may be termed field studies, originally prepared by the writer 
for the United. States commissioner of education, and constituting a part 
of the surveys of the public school systems of these two states made under 
the direction of the commissioner. The account of Arkansas here presented, 
is largely, though not entirely, a condensation of the author’s longer report, 
published as a separate bulletin by the Bureau of Education. Oklahoma 
is reprinted without change from the author’s chapter, as it appeared in the 
Oklahoma survey already referred to. The account of Alabama, originally 
published in two successive issues of Educational Administration and Super- 
vision, has been thoroughly revised. The study of School Finance in Ten- 
nessee was prepared by Mr. Goldthorpe, under the writer’s direction and  
-P-A-G-E-8
  viti PREFACE 
  was originally presented as a master of arts thesis at the University of 
Minnesota. 
Attention should perhaps be called to the fact that some of the conditions 
described in the chapters which follow have already been modified. Thus 
Arkansas, acting upon the author’s suggestion, has passed laws providing 
for a severance tax and a personal income tax. In Oklahoma, also, a 
number of reforms have been inaugurated.

CHAPTER I 
WHAT ARKANSAS MUST PAY TO HAVE GOOD SCHOOLS 
THE PRESENT SITUATION? 
According to Ayres, Arkansas’ educational rank, in 1918, with respect to 
her entire school situation is forty-sixth among the forty-eight states of the 
Union ; forty-seventh if we include in our group the District of Columbia as 
is commonly done.? Arkansas ranks fortieth in average annual salaries paid 
to teachers, forty-third as to per cent of enrolled children who are in daily 
attendance, forty-eighth in average length of school year. The conditions 
which lie back of the ranks just given leave no room for denying the fact 
that Arkansas is failing almost utterly in the task of educating her children. 
What should be a system of education is, in reality, as shown by the plain 
facts in the case, a system which perpetuates ignorance, illiteracy, and civic 
unpreparedness. 
In education as in other stable enterprises we get what we pay for. 
Arkansas ranks at the bottom of the scale in public education because she 
ranks at the bottom of the scale in the money she invests in it. There are 
only two states in the entire Union, namely Georgia and Mississippi, which 
in the year under consideration expended less per pupil in average daily 
attendance than did Arkansas. The United States as a whole spends for 
public schools $7.26 per capita of total population. Arkansas spends $2.79 
and ranks forty-fifth. 
How Mucus oF Aan Errort Is ARKANSAS MAKING? 
In 1890 Arkansas spent $1,016,776 on public schools; in 1920, $7,602,635, 
an increase of 647 per cent. But how does this increase in expenditure for 
public schools compare with the increase in the amount expended by the 
United States as a whole and by other states during this same period, par- 
ticularly the states in Arkansas’ own group, the South Central? 
Arkansas’ expenditure per pupil in average daily attendance in 1918 was 
144 per cent greater than in 1890, that of the United States as a whole was 
185 per cent greater. Mississippi is the only one of the South Central states 
whose per cent of increase was less; that of Tennessee was 301, Alabama’s

The Public School System of Arkansas, Part II Public School Finance, United States Bureau of 
Education Bulletin, 1923, No. 11. For source of data and more complete data, the interested reader 
is referred to this bulletin. 
Footnotes are largely omitted in the present account owing to the fact that the data used were 
taken directly from state documents on file in the state capitol, or were unpublished data provided the 
author by the State Department of Education. 
2The ranks given here are for the year 1918, this being the most recent year for which com- 
parative data for the entire United States were available at the time of writing the report.

was 263, and Oklahoma’s 294 per cent. In 1890 Arkansas stood fourth 
among the South Central states as to her expenditure per pupil in average 
daily attendance. In 1918 she stood next to the bottom; namely, seventh. 
Far from gaining in the general forward movement, which has characterized 
education in the United States during the past two decades, Arkansas has 
steadily lost ground, 
Wuat ARKANSAS’ PRESENT SySTEM OF ScHoot Finance Is Propucine 
Every great democrat from Thomas Jefferson to Woodrow Wilson has 
insisted that without a system of free, universal education, democracy is 
doomed. To what extent is Arkansas providing educational opportunities 
for her future citizens? To what extent are these opportunities universal 
and equal? 
The answer to the first of these two questions is a sad revelation of 
broken pledges and compromises with professed ideals. For thousands upon 
thousands of children, Arkansas is providing absolutely no chance. To these 
children, to be born in Arkansas is a misfortune and an injustice from which 
they will never recover and upon which they will look back with bitterness 
when plunged, in adult life, into competition with children born in other 
states which are today making some educational provision for every child. 
In 1920, 28 out of every roo children of school age were not even enrolled 
in school and on every school day approximately 32 out of every 100 who 
were enrolled did not attend school. 
Arkansas maintains next to the shortest school year of any state in the 
Union, and only six states have a smaller percentage of enrolled children in 
daily attendance. In 1920 the average school year was reported to be ap- 
proximately six months, yet such an average is entirely misleading, for in 
some counties the average school year was only slightly over three months. 
Arkansas is probably the only state in the world enjoying membership in a 
nation of the first rank in which the free public schools of a city of 10,000 
inhabitants (North Little Rock) were closed for an entire year. 
It is commonly conceded that the largest number of pupils which one 
competent and well-trained teacher can handle effectively is from 25 to 35. 
In Arkansas in 1921 the third richest county in the state reported that the 
average number of pupils per classroom was 60; in Prairie County it was 80. 
High schools were visited by the author where the average number of pupils 
in a class was between 50 and 60. In one case, 59 students were crowded 
into a room large enough to accommodate 35. Arkansas turns over the vast 
majority of her schools to cheap, untrained teachers. The meager number 
of teachers whom she does prepare in her own training institutions at the 
expense of the state, seek positions in other states. 
Ability to support schools can best be measured in Arkansas by determin- 
ing how much wealth a community possesses to draw upon for the education 
of each child of school age. In order to discover just what a child’s chance
-P-A-G-E-19

is in Arkansas today and to find out how far educational opportunities in 
Arkansas are equal or unequal, a study was made of nine counties. Pulaski, 
Arkansas, and Garland are the three counties ranking highest in the state 
with respect to assessed valuation per child enumerated; Stone, Van Buren, 
and Newton, the three counties ranking lowest on the same basis; White, 
Hempstead, and Boone, the three counties constituting the middle group. 
It was found that the chances of a child’s not being even enrolled in school 
were 31 out of 100 in Pulaski County, 33 out of 100 in Hempstead County, 
39 out of 100 in Stone County. It was further discovered that, although 
enrolled, his chances for not being in school on any particular day were 31 
out of 100 in Pulaski County, 34 out of 100 in Newton County, 47 out of 100 
in Garland County.

If a child belongs to that exceedingly small group who never miss a day, 
the average amount of schooling offered him in the year 1921 varied all the 
way from 8.4 months in Pulaski County, to 3.8:months in Van Buren and 
Newton counties. In other words the schools in the three poorest counties 
of the nine under consideration are open on an average 4.5 months less than 
the schools in Pulaski County, a difference greater than the entire length of 
the school year in three of the nine counties chosen. (These inequalities in 
the length of the school year are presented in Figure 1 and Table I.) 
In the last analysis the kind of a chance a child is given at school depends 
primarily on the kind of a teacher he has. Acknowledging certain individual 
exceptions, we may, however, state that the quality of teachers provided 
will be determined by the salaries paid. The average salary paid in the 
United States in 1918 to elementary school teachers was $606; to high school 
teachers, $1031. On the basis of the average length of a school year, namely 
eight months, this would amount to approximately $75 per month for ele- 
mentary school teachers. Only eight of the nine counties selected reported 
salaries. A comparison of the monthly salaries paid for white women teachers 
in rural school districts in these eight counties showed that three counties 
paid between $60 and $63 per month, and one paid $49. Out of every 100 
persons who were attempting to teach, 33 in Arkansas and Hempstead 
counties had not so much as graduated from a high school; 52 in White, 
60 in Garland, and 92 in Stone, 
A child living in Pulaski County in 1921 was given on an average, an 
education which cost $30 per year, whereas a child living in Stone County 
was given an education which cost $6 per year. The amount of money in- 
vested in school property for every such child amounted to $151 in Pulaski 
County, but to only $11 in Stone County. Figure 2 presents graphically the 
situation with respect to the nine counties studied. 
The facts we have thus far presented do not, however, reveal the extremes 
of inequalities but rather the situation characterizing nine counties. For this 
reason it has seemed well to tabulate the extreme variations as to teachers’ 
monthly salaries, length of school year, and average annual expenditure per 
child. This is done in Table II.

  Tue Causes oF EpucaTIonaL INEQUALITIES 
Inequalities in wealth per child (enrolled or enumerated) are inequalities 
in ability to provide schools. Inequalities in rate of district taxes represent 
inequalities in effort. Inequalties in state grants per child are obviously 
inequalities in aid. Table III reveals these inequalities in the nine counties 
already selected on the basis of assessed valuation per child enumerated. 
In total assessed valuation the nine counties included in Table III vary 
from 1.6 to 61.6 millions; in valuation per child enrolled from $600 to 
slightly more than $3100; in average tax rate from 6.5 to 11.7 mills; in state 
aid per child enrolled from $3 to $5. Arkansas County which is more than 
twice as able as White and Boone, levies 2 mills less than either, is able to 
spend $5 more on every child enrolled than either, yet receives more help 
from the state than either. 
The greatest extremes of variation, both with respect to educational op- 
portunity and with respect to school burdens, are found, not among counties, 
but among school districts. Table IV enables us to compare the richest and 
poorest districts of seven Arkansas counties with respect to their ability 
(assessed valuation per child enrolled), their effort (tax rate), and the 
amount of state aid received. These seven counties were selected from a 
group of seventeen chosen at random, and are arranged in order of the 
assessed valuation of the richest districts. 
In four of the seven counties included in Table IV, the richest district is 
more than five times as able to support schools as the poorest. In White 
County the richest district’s valuation per child enrolled is 6.6 times that of 
the poorest district, and in Carroll County it is 8.3 times. In Carroll County, 
the richest district (No. 32) levies a tax of the same rate as the poorest

PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ARKANSAS 9 
(No. 95), is able to spend more than three times as much per child enrolled, 
yet receives from the state $4.48, whereas the poorest receives from the state 
only $2.25. Even more striking is the situation in Marion County in which 
District No. 4 with less than one-fifth the wealth, levies 2.4 times as heavy 
a tax, spends more per child enrolled, but receives less aid from the state. 
In the year 1920-21 there were in Arkansas 5021 school districts: 599 
special districts, and 4022 common school districts. Of the special school 
districts, 563, or approximately 94 per cent, levied a district tax of 12 mills, 
the maximum permitted by the constitution; 20, or approximately 3 per cent, 
levied more than 12 mills. Of the common school districts, 56 per cent levied 
a 12-mill tax, over 25 per cent levied 7 mills or less, and approximately 
2 per cent levied no tax at all. It is safe to predict that any other state in the 
Union which supported its schools largely from district taxes would rapidly 
sink to an educational status as low as that of Arkansas if it attempted to 
depend upon such low taxes. In 1920, 120 school districts voted no tax, and 
in 1921, 78 voted no tax. 
ScHoor RecEIPTs AND SourcEs OF REVENUE, 1921 
Arkansas derives her funds for publicly supported educational institutions 
from the Federal government, the state, school districts, private foundations, 
and certain miscellaneous sources such as gifts, tuition fees, proceeds of fines, 
depository interest on school moneys, voluntarily imposed supplementary taxes 
on property or on sales. The incompleteness of the records for this last mis- 
cellaneous group exclude them from separate treatment. The counties con- 
tribute practically nothing although the proceeds from estrays and certain 
county fines go into the county school fund. 
Out of the proceeds of the above funds the state of Arkansas maintains 
the following classes of public educational enterprises: (1) common schools 
(elementary and high) ; (2) state schools for physical defectives (deaf and 
blind) ; (3) two schools for incorrigibles (boys’ and girls’ industrial schools) ; 
(4) four district agricultural schools ; (5) two normal schools (State Normal 
School for whites and Branch Normal for colored*) ; (6) extension educa- 
tion in agriculture and home economics; (7) schools for adults (for 
illiterates) ; (8) University of Arkansas; (9) the state pays part of the 
salaries of county superintendents and maintains a state department of 
education. These last two costs may be regarded as common school expendi- 
tures and will be so treated. The total amount received by Arkansas in 1921 
for the above nine classes of educational enterprises amounted to $12,610,044. 
Table V shows the amount and the per cent furnished by each class of 
sources, federal, state, etc. 
® This levying of a tax in excess of that permitted by the constitution is due to the fact that the 
law permits districts to levy what is known as a voluntary supplementary tax. This tax cannot be 
collected except upon the consent of the taxpayer. 
8a This is chiefly an institution for providing agricultural and mechanical training for the 
colored race. Only 24 of its students were enrolled in teachers’ training courses in 1918.

According to Table V, of the total school moneys provided in 1921 for 
all public educational institutions in Arkansas, the United States government 
furnished only 2.6 per cent, and private funds only four tenths of one 
per cent. Table VI shows that more than one half of the expenses of the 
State Department of Education were paid by a private foundation (the Gen- 
eral Education Board), and that the Federal government furnished nearly 
one third of the University’s entire current revenue.

Four federal funds contribute to the support of education in Arkansas: 
the Forest Reserve, the Smith-Hughes, the Smith-Lever, and the Morrill 
funds. 
Twenty-one counties receive annual quotas from the Forest Reserve fund 
in amounts varying all the way from $2.44 (Washington County), to $2766 
(Scott County), the amounts being proportionate to the area of the reserve 
situated within the said county. Forest Reserve fund school moneys are 
added to the county’s quota of the state’s county school fund and apportioned 
among school districts in proportion to the number of persons 6 to 21 years 
old living in said districts. 
The Smith-Hughes Act provides annual federal grants to the states for 
three general classes of expenditures as follows: (1) for the salaries of 
teachers, supervisors, and directors of vocational agriculture; (2) for the 
salaries of teachers of home economics, trade and industrial subjects; (3) for 
the professional training of teachers of the vocational subjects included in 
(1) and (2). 
Nearly all of the Smith-Hughes moneys received as teachers’ and super- 
visors’ salary grants are devoted to high school salaries. Three of the four 
district agricultural schools receive $1000 annually, and the fourth has re- 
cently applied for such aid. The University of Arkansas and the Branch 
(colored) Normal are the institutions designated to receive Smith-Hughes 
moneys for preparing vocational teachers. The Branch Normal may receive 
not more than 28 per cent of the annual grant for training vocational 
teachers ; the balance goes to the University.

The Smith-Lever Act, approved May 8, 1914, provides federal aid to 
state agricultural colleges for co-operating with the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture in agricultural extension work. 
As the result of federal acts passed in 1862, 1900, and 1907, Arkansas 
receives an annual grant of $50,000 to be used for the support of colleges 
of agriculture and mechanical arts. Of this annual grant Arkansas de- 
votes eight elevenths ($36,363.50) to her University, and three elevenths 
($13,636.50) to the Branch Normal. Table VII, which follows, shows the 
federal grants for education which Arkansas received in 1921.

State Arp 
School moneys furnished by the state are derived in Arkansas from the 
following sources: the permanent school fund, mill taxes, appropriations. 
On December 5, 1921, the principal of the permanent school fund was 
reported as amounting to $1,528,665.53. As a source of school revenue this 
fund is of well-nigh negligible importance, as will be seen from the fact that 
during the year 1919-20 it contributed only $56,878.09, approximately six 
tenths of 1 per cent of the total public school receipts for that year.
-P-A-G-E-29
  
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ARKANSAS 13 
The permanent school fund owes its origin to lands given by the 
United States government to the people of Arkansas to create a permanent 
‘endowment for public education which would ease the school burdens of 
each generation, The Arkansas permanent school fund is today merely an 
excuse, a subterfuge for additional taxation. Its income, like that of the 
university endowment fund, is derived from the proceeds of a state tax 
levied to pay the interest on the principal, practically all of which has been 
used by the state. 
The management and investment of the permanent school fund is en- 
trusted to the State Board of Education. Bonds of the United States or 
of the state of Arkansas are the only securities in which the permanent 
school fund moneys may be lawfully invested. For an account of the man- 
ner in which the permanent school fund of Arkansas has been continually 
mismanaged and depleted, the reader is referred to the account of Stephen 
Weeks in his History of Public Education in Arkansas, pages 93-108. One 
recent example may, however, be given. In 1921, $180,000 in cash which 
had accumulated in the state treasury to the credit of the permanent school 
fund was used to pay the debt of the state penitentiary and replaced by state 
paper. The transaction was entirely lawful, nevertheless such a method of 
investing moneys belonging to the permanent endowment cannot be too 
strongly condemned. Its unsoundness becomes strikingly evident when 
tested by commonly recognized principles of finance. A city would not think 
of investing its own sinking fund in its own bonds. It is even more un- 
thinkable that a bank should invest its reserve fund in its own bonds. 
APPROPRIATIONS 
Arkansas’ appropriations for education fall into two classes: (1) appro- 
priations made from the general revenue fund; (2) appropriations from 
funds derived from state mill property taxes levied specifically to provide 
funds for defined educational projects and institutions. An analysis of the 
general revenue fund for the biennium 1919-21 will show that gi per cent of 
the moneys composing it were derived from taxes of one sort or another— 
taxes on insurance, franchises, inheritances, and property. In view of this 
fact it is evident that 91 per cent of the moneys appropriated for education 
from the general revenue fund was, in the last analysis, derived from taxation, 
The constitution provides for the levying of a state mill school tax not 
to exceed 3 mills, and a $1 school poll tax on every voter. Poll taxes are 
paid to the district from which received and will therefore be treated as 
district, not state, revenues. Of all the moneys derived from the proceeds 
of state taxes during the biennium 1918-20, 51 per cent was derived from 
taxes levied specifically for educational objects. The educational projects 
for the support of which the law provides a special tax are as follows: 
3 mills for the general maintenance of common schools; 0.2 for interest on 
the permanent school fund and the university endowment fund; 0.2 mills
-P-A-G-E-30
ee ee Re ee ne eee 
14 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
for vocational education; 0.18 mills for the salaries of county superin- 
tendents; 1.2 mills for the education of the blind; 1.2 mills for the deaf-mute 
institute; 0.6 mills for the support of the four district agricultural schools ; 
0.12 mills for the Branch Normal and agricultural college for the colored 
race; 0.2 mills for the state normal school (for whites only) ; 1 mill for the 
support of the state university. The rates just given are those effective for 
the year 1922-23 and are in advance of those in force at the present time. 
Table VIII shows Arkansas’ state educational appropriations paid from 
the general revenue fund during the year 1919-20, and Table IX shows the 
state educational taxes and the projects for which levied. 
The proceeds of the 3-mill school tax are added to the income of the 
permanent school fund. This total amount, generally styled the “common 
school fund” is apportioned among the school districts in proportion to their 
scholastic population, 6 to 21 years of age. 
The institute and library fund, commonly known as the “Teachers’ 
Fund,” is derived from fees paid by teachers to the state for the issuance 
of teachers’ certificates. This fund may be used for paying expenses and 
salaries of instructors at teachers’ institutes and for paying the expenses of 
county superintendents while attending special schools of instruction and 
study. 
PrivaTE FouNDATION 
The public schools of Arkansas receive aid from the General Education 
Board, the Julius Rosenwald fund, the Slater fund, and the Jeanes fund. 
The General Education Board pays 52.5 per cent of the costs of the State 
Department of Education. It pays the salaries and expenses of the state high 
| school inspector, two rural school supervisors, negro school inspectors, and 
| aids in various other important matters. The Rosenwald fund grants sub- 
sidies for building and equipping rural schoolhouses and teachers’ homes in 
connection therewith for the colored race. The Slater fund makes grants to 
provide equipment and pay the salaries of colored teachers of industrial 
subjects in negro, county industrial training schools. Formerly contributions 
were received from the Jeanes fund to aid in the payment of the salaries of 
county industrial teachers for the colored race, but no money has been re- 
ceived from this fund since the close of the year 1918-19. The total amount 
of contributions from private funds available for public education in Arkansas 
in 1921 amounted to $75,994. Of this only $47,830 was expended.   
County Ap 
$ The county as a producer of school revenue in Arkansas is a factor 
of well-nigh zero importance. Not only do the counties levy no school 
tax, but they cannot do so without a constitutional amendment. The coun- 
ties provide school moneys from four sources: (1) interest on school funds 
placed in the custody of the county treasurer, and loaned by him to the 
banks; (2) proceeds of estrays; (3) proceeds of fines; (4) school funds, 
the purposes of which are not indicated. No separate account seems to be 
kept of revenue derived from these four sources.

Townsuie Arp 
The only township sources of school revenue are unsold portions of 
sixteenth section school lands. The present law provides that when these 
lands are sold the proceeds of such sales shall be added to the permanent 
school fund, but until they are sold the rents are distributed among the 
school districts lying in the townships in which the lands are situated. 
An inquiry sent in November to the tax collectors of Arkansas’ 75 
counties, brought replies from 27. Of those replying 16 reported no 
unsold sixteenth section lands; 11 reported sixteenth section school lands 
the total area of which amounted to 8060 acres, the total estimated value 
of which was $96,300. 
District Ap 
Table V showed us that 72.2 per cent of all moneys received for educa- 
tion in 1921 was furnished by the school districts. It must be borne in 
mind that this table included receipts not only for public schools but for the 
university, normal schools, and all other types of educational institutions. 
As a provider of revenue for public schools alone, the district is, of course, 
of greater importance than indicated in Table V. Arkansas’ total receipts 
for public schools in 1921, excluding balances from the previous year, 
amounted to $8,596,052.54. Of this sum, $6,621,093, i.e., 77 per cent, was 
furnished by the districts. Of the total amount provided by the districts, 
88 per cent was derived from proceeds of maintenance taxes; 4 per cent 
from building taxes; 4.4 per cent from poll taxes; and 3.6 per cent from 
bond sales. Not only is the district today the most important source of 
public school funds, but during the last thirty years the tendency has steadily 
grown to place upon the district a larger and larger share of the burden of 
school support. Even a brief consideration will show that it would be diffi- 
cult to conceive a worse system of school finance than the present system 
of district finance in Arkansas. Not only has the state shelved a larger 
and larger share of the burden of school costs upon the districts, but through 
constitutional and legislative prohibitions the state has made it impossible for 
the districts to provide the revenue necessary to maintain good schools. The 
maximum tax which a district may levy for all school purposes is 12 mills. 
If a district issues bonds, the law makes no provision whereby an additional 
tax may be levied to pay the interest and principal of the same. In fact the 
law expressly prohibits this. A striking evidence of the recognition by the 
citizens of Arkansas of the impossibility of maintaining schools on the basis 
of a 12-mill tax, is the law providing for assistance in collecting voluntary 
supplementary taxes or contributions. This law permits the electors of 
certain special districts to provide for the collection of a supplementary 
voluntary tax. The payment of this tax is optional except in cases where a 
taxpayer has given a written or signed promise to pay the same. The readi- 
ness of districts to resort to this voluntary tax is evidence of the faith of the 
people of Arkansas in public education and their willingness to rise above 
the obstacles placed upon them by the constitution.

Table X, which brings to a conclusion the present section, shows the main 
classes of sources employed by the various units which provide revenues for 
publicly maintained institutions. 
How Scuoot Moneys Are ApporTIONED AND UsEp 
The common school fund, consisting of the income of the permanent 
school fund, the proceeds of the 3-mill state school tax, and certain miscel- 
laneous revenues, is apportioned annually by the state superintendent of 
public instruction among the 75 counties of the state in proportion to the 
number of persons of school age (6 to 21 years) residing in each, The 
total common school fund divided by the total school census is the per child 
quota. This per child quota multiplied by the school census of any county 
is that county’s quota. The county school fund is apportioned among the 
districts of the county by the county board of education. The county board 
first sets aside from the general county school fund the moneys required 
for the salary and office expenses of the county superintendent and for the 
expenses of the county board of education. The remainder is then appor- 
tioned among the districts of the county in the manner in which the state 
common school fund is apportioned among the counties. 
Of all bases employed in the United States today in apportioning school 
moneys, the state school census basis is one of the most ineffective, unfair, 
unscientific, and disastrous. The school age which Arkansas employs is a 
fictitious age as far as school attendance is concerned. It includes thousands 
of children who do not attend school at all. It results in giving certain 
districts aid for large numbers of children between the ages of 15 and 21 who 
are school children in theory only and for whose education the district is 
spending nothing. It discriminates against the district which enrolls a large 
percentage of its school population and favors unduly the district which 
enrolls a small percentage of its school population. Moreover, it assumes 
that the amount of money a district must spend depends upon the number 
of children of school age living in the district, whereas in reality the cost 
depends upon the number of children who attend school, the number of 
teachers provided, and the length of the school term. It makes little differ- 
ence in the cost of maintaining a rural school whether a district contains 
7 pupils or 27. In both cases, one teacher must be hired, and the expenses 
of heating and insuring and otherwise maintaining the schoolhouse will be 
approximately the same. The school census method grants the same amount 
of aid to the district whether it maintains a school for three months or nine, 
whether it provides an adequate or inadequate number of teachers, whether 
it levies a heavy tax or a light one, whether the district is exceedingly 
wealthy or exceedingly poor. A just method of apportioning school aid 
must make the teacher’s salary the primary basis. It must also proportion 
the aid given to the length of the school term, to the valuation of the district, 
and the rate of school tax levied.
-P-A-G-E-35
  
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ARKANSAS 19 
Arkansas is greatly behind our more progressive states in another matter 
relating to the disbursement of school moneys, namely in setting up certain 
requirements which must be met by districts in order to participate in state 
grants. Even a small state fund can be used in a manner to elevate school 
standards and to bring about the enforcement of school laws, if granted 
only upon the fulfillment of specified requirements. The requirements 
which Arkansas might well establish will be pointed out in the closing sec- 
tion of this report under the head of recommendations. Before Arkansas 
can secure the acceptance and enforcement of such standards it will be neces- 
sary for her to offer much larger quotas of state aid than those now given. 
The allotment of $2.58 per school child (the 1920 quota) is altogether too 
small an inducement to be effective. 
We have now concluded our diagnosis of the educational situation in 
Arkansas. The fact that Arkansas ranks educationally at the bottom of the 
list of states has been shown to be due primarily to inadequate funds and an 
unequitable system of support. At various points we have employed as our 
standard in evaluating school provisions the average level of the United States 
as a whole. We will now attempt to answer the question, “How much 
money ought Arkansas to spend for public education?” The answer to this 
question will depend upon the standard which Arkansas sets for herself; 
in other words, upon the rank which the citizens of Arkansas determine 
their educational system shall attain. It would seem that any self-respecting 
state would not be satisfied with anything less than the average rank. This 
would of course mean that such a state would still be outclassed by practically 
half of the states in the Union. Yet in the case of Arkansas the attainment 
of such a rank would mean that she had climbed from practically the bottom 
to the middle rung of the educational ladder. We will therefore take this as 
our standard. 
How Mucu Witt Ir Cost Arxansas To REACH 
THe AVERAGE LEVEL? 
It is obvious that educational conditions are by no means entirely de- 
pendent upon school expenditure. An inequitable disbursement or extrava- 
gant use of large revenues may produce poorer schools than a smaller fund 
judiciously and equitably disbursed. It is equally evident that if moneys 
are equitably and carefully used, the results produced will be approximately 
proportional to the revenues expended. For the present, therefore, we may 
assume that, if Arkansas’ immediate goal is to reach the average educational 
level, she must invest in education an amount equal to the average expended 
by other states. A complete estimate of the moneys required would have to 
include estimated costs for every type of public educational institution and

reasons too complex to explain here, to include the four district agricultural 
schools, schools for the blind, deaf, feeble-minded, and incorrigibles. In 
most cases the averages employed are those for the year 1917-18, this being

the most recent year for which averages for the United States as a whole 
can be secured at the present time. Although these averages are below what 
such averages would be for 1920 and still further below what they would 
be for 1921-22, nevertheless they are in nearly every case so far above those 
prevailing in Arkansas at the present time that attainment to them would 
perhaps represent as great an immediate advancement as could be reasonably 
expected. We cannot undertake here to indicate the method or the bases 
employed in arriving at these estimated costs. For an account of these 
methods and bases the reader is referred to the author’s longer account.

Is Arkansas RicH EnoucH To Have Goop Scuoors? 
In 1921 the total receipts for public educational institutions and projects 
in Arkansas amounted to more than $12,000,000. (See Table V and text.) 
We have shown that it would require an annual revenue of over $20,000,000 
to raise to the average level the public schools, university, teacher-training 
institutions, and the types of higher education for the colored race now 
undertaken by Arkansas. Table XIII shows that, at the present time, 
Arkansas is spending for the current costs of these four classes of educa- 
tional institutions approximately $8,000,000. It will be necessary for 
Arkansas to provide, for current expenditures alone, $2.50 for every dollar 
she is now providing, and approximately $49,600,000 for new school prop- 
erty for the four classes of educational institutions just enumerated. These 
estimates do not include the extension work in home economics and agricul- 
ture, the four district agricultural schools, schools for incorrigibles, and for 
physical defectives. This omission does not seriously affect our estimates  
-P-A-G-E-38
  22 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
owing to the fact that the moneys for these projects constitute only a small 
percentage of the total receipts (in 1921 only 4.4 per cent) and also because 
66 per cent of the moneys for extension work in home economics and agri- 
culture is provided by the Federal government. 
Who shall furnish the major portion of these revenues; the state, the 
counties, or the districts? The most natural answer to this question is that 
increased burden of school costs should be borne by the district. This is how 
Arkansas has attempted to answer this question in the past. Omitting the 
small per cent of receipts annually derived from miscellaneous sources, we 
discover that whereas in 1890 the state furnished approximately 48.9 per 
cent of the total receipts and the districts 49.8 per cent, in 1918 the state’s 
quota amounted to only 27.6 per cent whereas the districts’ quota had in- 
creased to 68.1 per cent. In 1920 the state provided only 22 per cent whereas 
the districts were providing 75 per cent. In 1921 the state furnished only 15.4 
per cent and the districts furnished 82.0 per cent. This decline in the share 
of the burden borne by the state from 1890 to 1921 is presented graphically 
in Figures 3 and 4.

Shall Arkansas continue to adhere to the policy revealed in Figures 3 
and 4 and in the data we have previously given? It has been pointed out 
that one of the important causes of inadequate school revenues is the existing 
constitutional limit of 12 mills. Will removing the limits on district taxation 
solve the problem? It will if, and only if, the districts are nearly enough 
equal in wealth to provide equal revenues when restrictions are removed. A 
comparison was made of 46 Arkansas school districts lying in 17 different 
counties. An effort was made to select from each county on the basis of 
valuation per child enrolled, the richest and the poorest district and a district

owing to incomplete data, 5 districts had to be excluded, and consequently 
the number compared was 46. The richest of these 46 districts enrolls 102

levy a tax of| 301.6 mills to raise the same amount of money. The financial

® Assessed valuation per child enrolled is taken on the basis of financial ability. Districts chosen 
from seventeen counties, 
From Figure 5 we see that 3 per cent of the 6246 children resident in 
the 46 districts live in 2 districts, where the assessed valuation per child 
enrolled averages $2269; 29 per cent live in 4 districts, where the average 
valuation per child is $1670; 26 per cent live in 9 districts, where the average 
valuation is $1189; 20 per cent live in 11 districts, where the average valua- 
tion is $638 per child; 22 per cent live in districts where the average valua- 
tion per child is in every case less than $575 ; 8 per cent live in districts where 
the average valuation per child is less than $160. 
To the question “Will removing the limits on district taxation solve 
Arkansas’ problem of financing her schools?” there can be only one answer 
in the light of the facts: Most emphatically, No. School districts are so 
unequal in wealth that multitudes of them will never be able to maintain 
good schools no matter how heavily they tax themselves. Arkansas may 
temporize with the present situation, she may reduce the existing evils, but 
she cannot cure them unless, nor until, she abolishes the district system of 
school support with its legion of accompanying evils. The educational situa- 
tion of Arkansas is pathological. Her malady is organic. It can be cured 
only with a major operation. The most obvious and if it could be effected 
.the most simple major operation would be the complete abolition of the 
district system as a unit of taxation, organization, and administration, This 
 
-P-A-G-E-42

fact may as well be faced. There is no reason for hiding the truth from 
the citizens. Let Arkansas follow the example of Louisiana and other pro- 
gressive southern states.

@ Assessed valuation per child enrolled is taken as the basis of financial ability. Dis- 
tricts chosen from seventeen counties. 
We may well pause for a moment to indicate very briefly some of the 
changes implied in substituting the county for the district as the local school 
unit of organization and support. Briefly stated, it means that the schools 
of each county shall be organized in much the same manner as those of our
-P-A-G-E-43
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ARKANSAS 27 
best city systems are organized. The county school board and county su- 
perintendent will have the same duties and responsibilities placed upon them 
as in the best city systems. This will include the responsibility for determin- 
ing where schools shall be placed, where and when buildings shall be erected 
and how much they shall cost, the grades of certificates to be demanded of 
the teachers employed, and the salaries to be paid in case the minimum 
established by the state is to be exceeded. 
The present section of this report is concerned primarily, not with the 
superiority of the county over the district as a unit of organization and 
supervision, but as a unit for providing school revenues. Its superiority in 
this respect lies in the fact that, although counties do vary greatly in their 
ability to provide school revenues, nevertheless this variation is much less 
than in the case of school districts. In order to test this statement let us 
compare the variation in wealth in the 17 counties from which our 46 districts’ 
were selected, with the variation in wealth among these districts. 
Such a comparison shows that whereas the districts varied from $2500 
to $100 with respect to wealth per child enrolled, the 17 counties varied only 
from $2053 to $489. The children in 22 districts of the 46 lived in districts 
whose valuation was less than $500. Every one of the 17 counties, except 
one, had a valuation per child enrolled of $700. Despite this superiority of 
the county over the district as a source of school revenue, it is nevertheless 
painfully evident that the counties themselves are very far from equal in 
wealth and in ability to provide school revenues. The truth of this assertion 
becomes strikingly evident when we extend our comparison to include all 
of Arkansas’ 75 counties as is done in Figure 6. 
From Figure 6 we see that 5 per cent of the total number of children 
enrolled live in a county which can draw upon over $1800 valuation for the 
education of each child; 14 per cent live in 8 counties (Group VIII) which 
must depend for school revenues upon a valuation approximately half that 
of the county just mentioned ; over one third of the children live in Groups X 
and XI where the wealth back of each child ranges from approximately 
$650 to $750; 45 per cent live in Groups X-XIV where the wealth per 
child is less than $775. However much Arkansas may equalize her school 
burdens by adopting the county as the local unit, inequalities, although re- 
duced, will nevertheless continue as long as local units, even though they 
be the counties, are depended upon for the major portion of school revenues. 
The only unit which can equalize school revenues, burdens, and educational 
opportunities is the state. The state, and the state alone, is the unit which 
can produce the funds necessary to give every child an equal chance. We 
have recommended in unqualified terms the abolition of the school district 
and the establishment of the county as the local unit. Let us now ask what 
proportion of the school revenue ought to be furnished by the state and what 
proportion by the county.

  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ARKANSAS 29 
Teachers’ wages constitute the largest single item of school expenditure. 
An equally important fact is, that as is the teacher so is the school. Teachers 
of approximately equal preparation, experience, and ability can be secured 
only when communities are provided with approximately equal funds for 
the payment of teachers’ salaries. Admitting the feasibility of certain other 
methods, yet we may say that if Arkansas would equalize the educational 
opportunities of her children by the simplest method possible, let the state 
supply every school with funds sufficient to pay the full minimum salary of 
each teacher, such minimum to vary with the professional preparation and 
record of successful experience of the individual teacher. Let the state 
further determine what the requirements for each grade of certificate shall 
be and what the minimum salary of teachers holding each grade of certificate 
shall be. As long as local units are permitted to determine individually what 
salary they will pay, so long the majority of them will center their attention 
upon getting the teacher who will work for the lowest wage. Place upon the 
state the burden of paying teachers’ salaries, and existing conditions will be 
reversed. Increasing numbers of communities will endeavor to secure the 
best trained, most capable teacher available and will be eager to employ the 
teachers eligible to at least the highest wages the state provides. Such a 
policy would not prevent counties from paying salaries above the minimum 
fixed by the state where the electors of the county or the county board should 
determine this to be advantageous. 
In general we may say that from 55 to 65 per cent of the total school costs 
should, under normal conditions, be devoted to teachers’ salaries and text- 
books. In 1918 the United States as a whole devoted 58.2 per cent of its 
total public school moneys to these purposes. 
Arkansas should provide for an Interim Legislative Educational Budget 
Commission to determine as nearly as possible the amount of money needed 
for all educational projects to be financed by the state. Such a commission 
should report this amount to the legislature at its next session and the legisla- 
ture should forthwith take the necessary steps to provide this revenue. 
Should the state provide school moneys by making appropriations out of 
its general revenues or by means of a state school tax? In favor of the state 
tax, it is urged that as wealth increases the income for schools increases ; 
also that a state tax is stable and its proceeds assured, being independent of 
the mood of the legislature. 
A serious objection to the state school tax of fixed rate is that there is no 
guarantee that it will furnish the amount of money needed. Certain states 
avoid this difficulty by providing for the levying of a tax sufficient to raise a 
fixed sum or, better yet, to enable the state to fulfill its obligations. This 
latter method is employed by Washington and Wisconsin. The state should 
pay the minimum salary not only of teachers but those of superintendents,
-P-A-G-E-46
    30 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
county superintendents, rural supervisors, truant officers, and all other officials 
concerned with instruction, supervision, and administration. 
We have shown that at the present time Arkansas must provide as 
current revenue for the support of the public schools, normal schools, 
and University a sum of approximately $20,742,000. This would require 
a tax of approximately 34 mills on Arkansas’ assessed valuation of 1920 
($612,426,000. ) 
High as these rates are, it is doubtful if the total of the state and county 
rates here proposed would constitute a much heavier tax than the total borne 
by some communities at the present time. We refer here to those commu- 
nities which, in addition to levying a 12-mill tax, levy a supplementary 
12-mill tax and which are taxed by the state for common schools, for voca- 
tional education, for normal schools, and for the university. 
Can Arkansas provide the revenues required by our estimates? In other 
words, is she rich enough to have good schools? For reasons too complex 
to explain at this point, it is inadvisable to attempt to estimate the amount 
of money Arkansas ought to spend annually on buildings and other new 
property. Our attempt to give a final answer to the question, “Is Arkansas 
rich enough to have good schools?” will confine itself to public schools, In 
view of the fact that 88 per cent of Arkansas’ annual expenditures is for 
public schools, it is believed this limitation will prove not only justifiable but 
thoroughly satisfactory. The policy we have proposed would require the 
state to pay the minimum salaries of teachers, principals, rural supervisors, 
county superintendents, and the costs of textbooks, and supplies; and the 
counties to pay for new school property, general control, and miscellaneous 
expenses. The total amount to be annually raised by the state on the basis 
of our estimates amounts to $13,331,429, and the.amount to be raised by the 
counties, $7,410,113. On the basis of the total assessed valuation basis of 
taxable property in Arkansas in 1920 ($612,426,084), to raise these amounts 
would require a state tax of 21.769 mills and an average county tax of 
12.099 mills, making a total of 33.868 mills. 
Let us compare this total estimated rate of approximately 34 mills with 
rates levied in various other states. In the year 1919-20, 5 per cent of the 
total number of rural school districts in Minnesota levied a district tax of 
more than 20 mills, and one district levied a tax of more than 116 mills. 
A comparison of city with rural schools in almost any state will show two 
facts: first, that city schools are far superior to rural schools; second, that 
cities tax themselves far more heavily than do rural communities. A study 
of tax rates levied by cities in a number of states showed that three cities in 
one state, nine cities in another, and thirteen cities in a third state levied a 
local tax of 30 mills or over. In every one of these cities except four the 
assessed valuation was a larger percentage of the true valuation than that 
of Arkansas. Twelve cities levied taxes ranging from 30.4 to 53.48 mills.
-P-A-G-E-47
  
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ARKANSAS aaean 
One of these cities, which in 1918 levied a tax of 42.6 mills, in 1921 levied 
a tax of 67 mills. These taxes are greatly in excess of those levied by the 
vast majority of cities in the United States. 
It is generally agreed among experts in the field of public finance that 
there is at the present time no means of determining how heavy a tax can 
be advantageously placed upon property, incomes, or industry. A tax which 
cripples industry or makes the owning of a home or a farm a luxury and a 
burden rather than an incentive to thrift is unquestionably unsound. Let 
us attempt to discover how the burden we are placing upon Arkansas would 
compare with that at the present time borne by other states. This may be 
done by comparing the number of dollars Arkansas would be spending per 
each $1000 of true estimated wealth with the average annual expenditure for 
public schools in the United States for each $1000 of estimated wealth. The 
state tax commissioner of Arkansas estimates that the assessed valuation of 
1920 is 40 per cent of the true valuation. According to the comptroller, it is 
20 per cent. Employing these two ratios as the bases of our estimates we 
find that, according to the comptroller, the true valuation of taxable property 
in Arkansas is $3,062,000, while, according to the commissioner,. it is 
$1,531,000. The commissioner’s estimate for 1920 is 12 per cent less than 
the federal estimate for 1912, which is sufficient evidence of its complete 
inaccuracy. Recognized national authorities estimate that between 1912 and 
1920 the wealth of the United States increased at least one third. On this 
basis the true wealth of Arkansas would be $2,343,000. In view of these 
facts and of the method employed by the comptroller in making his estimate 
(which we regret cannot be detailed here) we shall accept his estimate of 
Arkansas’ true valuation. On the assumption that the assessed valuation is 
20 per cent of the true valuation, we find that the rates to be levied on the 
true valuation by the state, would be 4.349 mills, and by the counties, 2.4198 
mills, making a total tax of 6.7688 mills. The facts upon which these esti- 
mates are based are presented in Table XV. . 
Levying a tax of 6.77 mills is equivalent to expending $6.77 on each 
$1000 of estimated true valuation. In 1918 the average state expenditure 
for public schools on each $1000 of estimated true valuation was $2.76.‘ 
The highest expenditure of any state was that of Idaho which was $5.01 © 
for each $1000 of estimated true valuation. It is evident that Arkansas can- 
not reach the average educational level by making an average effort. An 
expenditure of 6.77 per each $1000 of estimated true wealth is not only 
nearly two and one-half times the average expenditure but is greatly in 
excess of that of the state making the greatest effort.

This discovery casts a serious doubt as to whether Arkansas would be 
justified in placing such a burden upon real and personal property. Not only 
is this true but authorities on taxation are practically unanimous in their 
denunciation of heavy general property taxes especially as state taxes. This 
matter is discussed in detail in the author’s longer report® but cannot be 
entered upon here. Suffice it to say that authorities on taxation are equally 
convinced of the necessity of employing new types of taxation such as in- 
come, corporation, and severance taxes instead of, or in addition to, general

-P-A-G-E-49

property taxes as a means of meeting the rapidly increasing demands for 
public moneys. Many of our states are already employing such taxes 
specifically for providing school revenues. Corporation taxes are employed 
specifically for raising school revenues by New Hampshire, Maine, Kentucky, 
New Jersey, Virginia, and California; inheritances taxes by California, 
Virginia, Louisiana, Michigan, Delaware, and Kentucky; occupation taxes 
by Texas and Utah; income taxes by Massachusetts and Delaware; and 
Louisiana levies a 2 per cent severance tax on the gross value of all natural 
products severed from the soil except agricultural products. 
It does not lie within the province of the present report to attempt to 
decide for the citizens of Arkansas the kind of taxes they shall employ for 
raising school revenues, or the extent to which they shall depend upon this 
or that kind. Nevertheless the situation with which we find ourselves face 
to face forces us to consider whether Arkansas may not escape the disaster 
of placing too heavy a burden upon real or personal property by resorting 
to other kinds of taxation. Can she advantageously increase her taxes on 
inheritance and on corporations? Whether or not this may be done, we be- 
lieve there is no reason for doubting that she can and should provide school 
revenues from a state income tax and from state severance taxes.® 
The movement towards the levying of state income taxes was given a 
distinct setback by the employing of federal income taxes. Indeed the mere 
suggestion of a state income tax commonly meets with strong opposition. 
This is natural and inevitable. Nevertheless the fact remains that a number 
of our states are levying such taxes and finding them a thoroughly satisfac- 
tory way of producing revenue. Possession of real and personal property 
is no longer the truest index of ability and obligation to support public 
institutions. Frequently a much truer index is the possession of personal 
income. A careful study recently made of the income tax in all states levy- 
ing the same concludes as follows: “It is clear that such a tax which yields 
from specified incomes only an amount approximately equal to one-third of 
that collected by the federal government is a satisfactory fiscal measure.” 
It is impossible to say in advance whether Arkansas could advantageously 
levy a tax on this basis or on a lighter or a heavier basis. This is something 
which only a careful study of the situation could determine. On the basis 
of one third of the proceeds of the federal tax, Arkansas could realize from a 
state income tax approximately $2,700,000. On the basis of a 2 per cent 
severance tax, Arkansas could realize an annual revenue of $2,276,000. The 
total amount which would be produced from these two proposed taxes on the 
bases just given would amount to something over $4,976,000. It is possible 
that the rate now levied by Louisiana is too low and-that Arkansas could

provided for a state income tax and a severance tax.
-P-A-G-E-50
34 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
realize much in excess of $2,276,000 from her severance tax, but were 
Arkansas to derive from severance and income taxes $4,976,000, the amount 
to be raised by the state on real and personal property would be reduced to 
$8,355,000. This amount could be raised by levying a state general property 
tax of 13.64 mills on the assessed valuation or 2.73 mills on true valuation. 
This last rate translated into expenditure per each $1000 of true estimated 
wealth would amount to only $2.73 per thousand. We can see that this 
burden would closely approximate the average burden borne by our states in 
1918. If we add to the millage, the 12.09 mill tax which we have shown 
must be raised by the counties, we have a total property tax of 25.73 mills. 
It may be asserted with confidence that the real and personal property of 
Arkansas could stand a total tax of 25 mills without serious ill effects. In 
view of the statements already made, it is evident that the less Arkansas 
depends upon general property taxes, the better. The outstanding fact is 
that the citizens of Arkansas can, if they will, produce the revenues necessary 
to provide good schools. Arkansas can no longer plead poverty. The task 
we have set for her is one which will perhaps demand heroic effort, but it is 
entirely within her power. We may well close the present section of this 
report by quoting a statement appearing in the recent General Education 
Board report on public school finances in Kentucky. 
In quoting, we shall substitute the name of Arkansas for that of 
Kentucky. 
The tide of prosperity does not rise in countries that pay little for education, it 
rises in those that pay much, 
A vigorous and industrious population does not seek a state which has poor schools; 
it seeks a state which has good schools. 
Having so far done less than it should, and less than it could afford, let Arkansas 
by a supreme effort now do at least what it can afford. 
The returns will be prompt and large. 
Such action is recommended not only by statesmanship, but by enlightened selfish- 
ness, if one must have a lower justification. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
It is desirable to bring together here at the close of our report on school 
finances recommendations which have been stated in earlier paragraphs or 
which, although not stated, follow as a natural consequence of the principles 
laid down. It is necessary to confine ourselves merely to summary state- 
ments. Should the reader desire a fuller knowledge of the bases upon which 
these recommendations are made, he will find it in earlier paragraphs and 
particularly in the author’s longer report on financing education in Arkansas 
published by the United States Bureau of Education and already referred to 
a number of times in the present chapter.

PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ARKANSAS 37 
Sec. 27. Provide for the state department of education funds sufficient 
to enable it to dispense entirely with aid from private foundations. 
Sec. 28. Place the appointment and the fixing of the salary of the state 
superintendent of public instruction in the hands of the state board of 
education. 
Sec. 29. Provide a salary fund for the State Department of Education 
sufficient to enable the State Board of Education to employ a state superin-

on the basis of professional qualifications. 
Sec. 30. Establish and provide for the maintenance of a division of 
school architecture within the State Department of Education. 
Sec. 31. Repeal those portions of sections 7641 and 7642, Digest of 
Laws Relating to Schools in the State of Arkansas, 1920, which permit a 
parent or guardian to transfer his school tax to another county or district, 
and provide instead that where a child, with the approval of the county 
superintendent, is transferred from the county in which he resides to another, 
his own residential county shall pay to the school to which he has been trans- 
ferred such sum as may be agreed upon for his tuition, provided that the 
tuition paid shall not be greater than the average net cost for educating 
pupils in the school to which he has been transferred. 
Sec. 32. Abolish 6 to 21 years as the scholastic age and establish in its 
stead as the scholastic age, 5 to 18 years. 
Sec. 33. Abolish the present antiquated, unfair method of apportioning 
state school funds on the school census basis and adopt instead a modernized, 
- scientific method by which state moneys will be apportioned by the state 
directly to the individual positions which the state subsidizes. This will pre- 
vent the moneys which the state designs to pay the salary for a definite 
teaching position in one school being used for another teaching position in 
the same or in another school. The method to be used in apportioning state 
aid will depend to a large extent upon what proportion of the total schools 
costs the state pays. If the state of Arkansas does not adopt the recom- 
mendations of this report and continues its present policy of providing only 
a small per cent of total costs, then it should introduce a method which will 
provide a minimum teachers’ salary quota for every teaching position in 
every school, the actual quotas to be determined by the financial ability of 
the community, the effort the community is making as indicated by the rate 
of school tax levied in proportion to its wealth, the length of school term, 
and the salaries and qualifications of the teachers employed. 
If such a method is adopted, the state must offer effective inducements 
for consolidation, otherwise the per teacher quota system of state aid hinders 
consolidation.  
-P-A-G-E-54
  
  38 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
Sec. 34. Empower and require the State Department of Education to 
fix and to modify from time to time as conditions seem to warrant, the 
requirements and standards which counties must meet in order to receive 
state aid. Such requirements must include at least the levying of the mini- 
mum county school tax of 12 mills, maintaining schools for at least 8 months, 
employing teachers satisfying all legal requirements, providing instruction 
in all subjects required by law, submitting all reports required by law, en- 
forcing compulsory education and truancy laws, erecting all new school 
houses and other school buildings in accordance with, plans and specifications 
previously approved by the state school architect and the state superintendent 
of public instruction, providing furniture, equipment, libraries, apparatus, 
and other school supplies, satisfying standards established by the State Depart- 
ment of Education and fulfilling all other state school laws and all regula- 
tions of the State Department of Education. (The high standard of high 
schools in Minnesota is dué to the fact that such powers are granted to the 
State High School Board and have been exercised judiciously and effectively 
for many years.) 
THE PERMANENT SCHOOL FunpD 
Owing to the small per cent of the total educational revenue derived from 
the permanent school fund and froni the University endowment fund, it 
might seem scarcely worth while to devote much attention to reforms needed 
in the administration and management of these funds. Nevertheless, as 
pointed out elsewhere, relatively small endowments properly managed and 
the income of which is disbursed in a thoroughly scientific manner, can be 
made to wield a degree of influence greatly in excess of their proportionate 
contributions to total costs. Moreover, it should be evident from our account 
of these funds that principles of sound finance, we might almost say ethical 
principles, are involved in the issue. It should be borne in mind, however, 
that the constitutional amendments which we are about to propose affecting 
these funds are at the present time far less important than the constitutional 
amendments which would be required to establish the county as a school unit 
and to remove the constitutional limits on state and local school taxes. 
The only section in the constitution of Arkansas bearing upon state per- 
manent endowments for education provides that no money or property be- 
longing to the permanent school fund or to the University shall ever be used 
for any purposes other than the one to which it belongs. This provision has 
proven to be entirely inadequate to safeguard these endowments or to assure 
wise investment and management. An amendment should be adopted which 
would guarantee the protection, preservation, and proper use of the perma- 
nent school fund and of other state endowments for education. Such an 
amendment should include the provisions set forth in the following seven 
sections.

the constitution and should include all sources now devoted and an appropria- 
tion of at least $100,000 to be added annually to the principal of the fund 
until said principal amounts to at least $5,000,000. 
Sec. 2. The management and investment of the permanent school fund 
should be entrusted to a board of permanent school fund commissioners com- 
posed as follows: 
The state treasurer, ex officio, chairman 
The state superintendent of public instruction 
The state auditor 
The state land commissioner 
Sec. 3. Whenever and as often as there is in the state treasury the sum 
of $10,000 belonging to the permanent school fund, the same shall be invested 
by the board of permanent school fund commissioners in securities of one or 
more of the following classes: 
United States bonds 
Bonds of states other than Arkansas 
County, city, town, village bonds of Arkansas or of other states 
Sec. 4. No moneys belonging to the permanent school fund or to the 
University endowment fund or to any other state public fund the purpose 
of which is to provide a permanent state endowment for educational purposes, 
shall be invested in Arkansas state bonds or in any other securities or funds 
chargeable to, or dependent upon, the credit of the state of Arkansas. 
Sec. 5. No such investment shall be made when the bonds to be pur- 
chased would make the entire bonded indebtedness of the corporation issuing 
or selling them, exceed 15 per cent of the assessed valuation of its taxable 
property, nor shall such loans and indebtedness of investments be made for 
a shorter period than five years. ; 
Sec. 6. The Board of Commissioners shall deliver all securities pur- 
chased by them for the benefit of the permanent school fund to the state 
treasurer who shall be the custodian of said fund and who shall credit such 
securities to the permanent school fund and shall place the interest derived 
from such securities and investment to the credit of the permanent school 
income fund. 
Sec. 7. The permanent school income fund shall be apportioned annually 
by the state superintendent of public instruction for such purposes and in 
such manner, by such methods, and upon such bases as shall be determined 
by the State Board of Education, subject only to such limitations as the 
legislature may provide.

CHAPTER II 
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN OKLAHOMA? 
THE PRESENT SITUATION 
No one realizes better than the citizens of Oklahoma themselves that the 
financial situation of the public schools is far from satisfactory. In 1920 
the people of Oklahoma voted on a proposed amendment to the constitution 
which would have authorized the State Board of Equalization to levy not 
to exceed 6 mills, a tax on all property of the state for the support of the 
public schools. This amendment was defeated. In 1922 an effort was made 
to raise the present constitutional limit of 15 mills to 25 mills. This amend- 
ment was lost. What is the present situation? From every part of the state 
come reports of inadequate funds, shortened school terms, underpaid and 
untrained teachers. Over against these conditions is placed the fact that 
Oklahoma’s expenditures for public schools during the last decade have 
risen by leaps and bounds. In 1910 Oklahoma spent approximately $6,700,000 
for public schools. In 1920 she spent more than three times as much; namely, 
$22,900,000. In 1910 she spent approximately $16 for each child enrolled 
in school; in 1920, approximately $39. In 1910 she had invested in school 
property approximately $13,000,000; in 1920, nearly $36,000,000.

should be noted that many of the expenditures included in these last three 
items do not appear in the amounts shown in the biennial reports of the

superintendents are paid out of the county general funds, not out of the

Figure 1 and the two preceding tables show that Oklahoma is not only 
spending a large amount of money for public schools, but that she has made 
vast increases in expenditures during the last eleven years. In view of the 
unsatisfactoriness of the situation and the conditions now confronting hun- 
dreds and hundreds of districts throughout the state, a question far more 
important than how much Oklahoma has increased her expenditures for 
public schools is how does the amount compare with her ability to provide 
school revenue. Is the financial crisis which the public schools are facing 
inevitable? Is Oklahoma exerting herself to the full measure of her ability? 
The ability of a state, a county, or a district to provide schools does not 
depend chiefly upon its total assessed valuation. If two districts each have 
a valuation of $20,000, and one of these districts has to educate 50 children, 
and the other, 150 children, it is easy to see it would be very unfair to con- 
sider them equally able to provide schools of the same standard. One 
of these districts ought to provide at least 2 teachers, the other, at least 6, 
allowing 25 pupils per teacher. For this reason, it is customary to take as 
the measure of the ability of a state, a county, or a school district to provide 
schools its wealth per child. We may regard the wealth of the state, county, 
or district as a bank account upon which the state may draw for the support 
of public schools, and the wealth per child as the bank account upon which 
it may draw for the education of each child. 
OXKLAHOMA CoMPARED WITH OTHER STATES 
One way of answering the question whether Oklahoma is exerting her- 
self in proportion to her ability is to compare her with other states. In mak- 
ing such a comparison it would, of course, be thoroughly unsound to take the
-P-A-G-E-62
  
46 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
assessed valuation as a measure, for in some states the assessed valuation 
represents the actual selling price—that is, 100 per cent of the true valuation 
of property. In other states property is assessed at 60 per cent, and in still 
others at 30, and even 20 per cent of true value. For this reason we shall 
take the estimated true wealth per child of school age as a measure of ability. 
As a measure of effort we shall take the amount expended for public schools 
on each $1000 of true estimated wealth. 
STATES SELECTED FOR COMPARISON 
The question at once arises, with whicl states in the Union ought Okla- 
homa to be compared? 
Oklahoma entered the Union less than twenty years ago, and was given 
a vast endowment in lands and moneys, for supporting public schools. This 
endowment has steadily increased. Moreover, from the start she has be- 
lieved whole-heartedly in public, universal education, and has had no battle 
to fight against organized opposition to the public school idea. In view of 
all these facts, we may say that one satisfactory basis upon which we may 
make our selection of states for comparison is ability to provide school 
revenues, as represented by estimated true wealth per child, 5 to 18 years 
of age. On this basis Oklahoma ranks twelfth. Professor F. F. Blachly, 
of the University of Oklahoma, in his monograph The Financial System of 
the State of Oklahoma, Chapter 1, shows that Oklahoma ranks fourth as to 
estimated wealth per capita of total population and that twenty-five states had 
a greater net debt per capita. 
In Table III, which follows, Oklahoma is compared with six other states 
which rank respectively, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, as to estimated true 
wealth per school child. 
From Table III we see that in the group of seven states, among which 
Oklahoma ranks first as to ability to provide school revenues, she ranks 
seventh as to the effort she is making; seventh as to the amount of money 
she is expending on each child enrolled; seventh as to the per cent of popula- 
tion 5-18 years of age, who are attending school; and seventh as to the aver- 
age number of days attended by each pupil enrolled. In all these respects 
she ranks at the very bottom of the scale. Indeed, she ranks lowest in every 
item except one; namely, the average annual salary of teachers, and in this 
respect she ranks next to the lowest.

It is evident that, in proportion to her ability, Oklahoma is making far 
less effort than other states in the Union with which she ought to be com- 
pared. Let it be borne in mind that every state with which we have com- 
pared her ranks lower in ability, as well as higher in effort and results. Let 
us now ask the same question regarding Oklahoma when compared with the 
United States as a whole. Table IV answers this question.

penditure per each $1000 see Table III, footnotes b and d. 
From Table IV we see that whereas Oklahoma ranks twelfth in the 
United States with respect to her ability to provide school revenue, she 
ranks forty-second as to her expenditure for each $1000 of estimated true 
wealth; thirty-fourth as to the amount which she expends per child enrolled ; 
and thirty-seventh as to the value of her school property per child enrolled. 
In education, as in other stable enterprises, we get what we pay for. This 
statement is borne out by the results which Oklahoma secures, for we dis- 
cover that with respect to the per cent of population which is attending school 
she ranks thirty-third in the Union; thirty-eighth as to the average number 
of days attended by each pupil; and forty-eighth, or lowest, as to the per cent 
of enrollment which is in average daily attendance. . 
Eguatity in EpucaTion 
Every great American Democrat, from Thomas Jefferson to Woodrow 
Wilson, has insisted that without a system of free universal education, 
democracy is doomed. Equality in opportunity is a brief but accurate state- 
ment of the supreme educational purpose of every state in our Union.  
-P-A-G-E-65
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN OKLAHOMA 49 
Even approximate equality in education can never be secured throughout 
a state, until school revenues,-and school burdens are equalized. The extent 
to which school revenues are equalized will depend upon at least three things: 
first, the equality in ability of the local units which furnish the revenues 
(in Oklahoma, districts and counties) ; second, the comparative effort made 
by such local units to provide revenues; and, third, the extent to which the 
state evens out inequalities in ability and effort existing among the local units. 
We must pause, therefore, at this point to consider briefly the situation 
with regard to these factors in Oklahoma. 
Convitions In NINE REPRESENTATIVE CouNTIES 
In order to gain an accurate idea of the actual conditions an intensive 
study was made of nine representative counties. These counties were selected 
on the basis of their ability to provide school revenues; i.e., on a basis of 
wealth per school child in average daily attendance. 
The counties selected include the three richest, three poorest, and three 
of middle rank, as measured by their wealth per child. 
Table V shows the nine counties selected, the wealth per child, and the 
rank of each county among Oklahoma’s seventy-seven counties on the basis 
selected.

* Per child in average daily attendance. 
Table V shows us that Cimarron County is more than five times as able 
to provide school revenues as McCurtain, six times as able as Haskell, and 
nearly three times as able as Kiowa. In view of these, and other wide varia- 
tions revealed by Table V, it would be reasonable to expect that the expendi- 
tures for public schools would vary widely also. 
This expectation is borne out by the facts, thus: whereas, Cimarron 
County spends $97 for every child in average daily attendance; McCurtain
-P-A-G-E-66
  50 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
and Haskell counties each spend approximately $35; Carter County, $71; 
Kiowa County, $43; and Cotton County, $40. 
It would seem reasonable, also, to assume that the expenditure for public 
schools in various counties would be directly proportioned to their wealth. 
How far this is from being the case is discovered as soon as we turn our 
attention to this point. Thus, Carter County, which in our group of nine 
ranks sixth as to ability, ranks fourth as to its expenditure per child; Grant 
County, which ranks second as to ability, ranks third in expenditures, and 
is almost equaled by Carter County. 
Figure 2 shows how these nine counties compare in the year 1921, with 
respect to their wealth per child in average daily attendance, and their total 
expenditure per child.? 
In Figure 3 we have two upright bars for each county. The first of these 
bars represent the county’s wealth per child in average daily attendance; 
ie., its ability to provide school revenues. The second bar. represents the 
average school tax levied by the districts within the county.* 
From Figure 3 we see that, with the exception of Cimarron County and 
Carter County, as ability (i.e., wealth) decreases, effort (ie., the average tax 
rate) increases. The situation in Carter County is due to the fact that she 
receives, from the gross production tax on oil, nearly $15 per child. 
Figure 4 enables us to compare even more accurately the efforts to pro- 
vide school revenues, which are being put forth by these nine counties. 
Extremes oF Tax Levies ror ScHooL PuRPOSES 
From Figure 4 we see that in Grant County, 1 district, in Cimarron and 
Cotton, 2, and in LeFlore, 8 districts out of each 100 districts levy no school 
tax whatever. Only 3 out of each roo districts in Grant County levy a tax 
of more than ten mills, whereas, in the three poorest counties in the state— 
McCurtain, LeFlore, and Haskell—we discover 85 out of each 100 in 
McCurtain ; 60 out of each 100 in LeFlore ; and 88 out of each 100 in Haskell. 
The climax of the situation is reached in Haskell County where 42 districts 
out of each 100 exceed the lawful limit of fifteen mills. The fifteen-mill 
limit is exceeded in certain other counties as well, and this is probably due 
to including in the computation levies for interest charges and sinking funds. 
The complete story of Oklahoma school burdens is told in Figure 5. 
Figure 5 shows the counties of Oklahoma arranged in nine groups.? The 
small white square represents the average valuation per child of counties 
included in each group. Resting on each square is a figure representing the 
average school tax levied by rural and village districts of the counties in- 
cluded in the group. The lowest tax is that levied in Garfield County, which 
has the highest valuation per child of all the groups. Turning to the second 
chapter of our story we find six counties with the average valuation per child 
of $6500. The average tax levied by districts in these counties is 5.1 mills.

From this point on, with the exception of the fifth chapter, the story is the 
same. The lower the valuation, i.e., the less the ability, the heavier is the 
burden, which must be borne under Oklahoma’s present system of school 
finance.

We have seen how enormous are the inequalities among counties as to 
wealth, expenditures, and taxation for public schools. The situation is even 
worse among the districts within the counties. This will be discovered by 
comparing the richest and poorest school districts in counties which we have 
already compared with one another. The reports of the superintendent of 
public instruction group Oklahoma school districts into two general classes: 
first, rural and village districts ; second, independent districts. 
Figure 6 shows how the richest and poorest rural school districts in five 
Oklahoma counties compare in the year 1921-22, as to ability to support 
schools, i.e., wealth per child, and as to the effort they made to provide 
schools, as measured by the district school tax.

Figure 6 shows that whereas the richest rural district in Grant County 
has $82,000 back of each school child, the poorest has only $3000. In 1922 
the richest district in this county levied a tax of 5 mills; the poorest levied a 
tax of more than 9 mills. In Kiowa County the richest district has back of 
each child, $20,000 and levies a tax of less than 5 mills; the poorest has back 
of each child only $2000 and levies a tax of 15 mills. 
It is in Haskell County again where we find the heaviest tax rate levied. 
The richest district in Haskell County has back of each child only $7000, 
yet levies a tax of 21 mills; the poorest has back of each child only $1000, yet 
levies a tax of 16 mills. It is unnecessary to prolong our discussion of 
Figure 6—the facts are too evident to need enlarging upon,

Attention, however, may well be called to at least one more situation. The 
richest district in Grant County is eighty-two times as able to provide school 
revenues, as the poorest in Haskell County, yet it levies a tax of less than 
one-third the rate levied by this poorest of all districts. | 
That there is little reason to believe the situation any better in independent 
school districts, is shown by the story of eight independent school districts, 
told in Figure 7. 
CausEs oF OKLAHOMA’s EDUCATIONAL BACKWARDNESS 
Space does not permit us to continue further our account of county and 
district inequalities in ability and effort to provide schools. We have seen that 
compared with the United States as a whole Oklahoma ranks very low as 
to the per cent of her school population which is actually attending school 
(thirty-third), lower still with respect to the average number of days at- 
tended by each pupil enrolled (thirty-eighth), and the lowest in the Union 
with respect to the percentage of enrollment which is in average daily 
attendance. 
Let us now ask what are the chief causes of this deplorable educational 
situation. We answer: (1) a defective system of taxation; (2) a system of 
school finance which makes it absolutely impossible to provide adequate school 
funds; (3) the district system; (4) an unscientific method of apportioning 
the state funds, which ignores both the ability and the effort of the local units. 
In 1920 Oklahoma ranked twelfth with respect to her wealth per child. 
In that same year she spent for each child in average daily attendance $64, 
and ranked thirtieth. Had she ranked twelfth with respect to expenditures 
as well as wealth it would have been necessary for her to spend $90 per child, 
instead of $64.

There is not a state in the Union which can provide adequate school 
facilities under a system which depends for three fourths of her revenue 
upon school districts, and which limits these districts to a 15-mill, or even a 
30-mill tax. 
NonTAXxABLe InprAn Lanps AN ImporTANT Factor 
The difficulty of the situation is greatly increased, owing to the fact that 
there are within the state of Oklahoma approximately 6,700,000 acres of 
land owned by unnaturalized Indians, and which lands therefore are not 
subject to taxation, It is estimated that a levy of 10 mills on these lands 
(the average rate of school tax for 1922) would produce an annual revenue 
of $1,228,000. The paltry sum, ten cents per day, paid by the United States 
government for the tuition of Indian children attending public schools, does 
not meet the actual costs of such tuition. Moreover, the federal apportion- 
ment is so inadequate that it has been necessary during the past year to 
prorate it, with the result that in eastern Oklahoma the second quota amounted 
to approximately five, instead of ten, cents per day. Oklahoma should take 
steps at once to secure from the Federal government an appropriation which 
will adequately reimburse her for the revenue of which her schools are being 
deprived under the existing system. It is hardly conceivable that, if the 
facts were laid before Congress, that body would refuse to recognize the 
Federal government’s obligation. 
Derects oF District ORGANIZATION 
It has been pointed out that one of the chief causes of Oklahoma’s de- 
plorable educational situation is the district system. We may well add that 
the district system is the most important of all these causes, and is also the 
fundamental defect underlying all others. That Oklahoma’s system of 
school support is essentially a district system is shown by Figure 8 and 
Table VII, which follow, and which show that in 1921 the school districts 
in Oklahoma furnished $77 out of every $100 provided for public schools.

  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN OKLAHOMA 59 
There are in Oklahoma at the present time over 5000 rural school districts 
and nearly 300 independent districts. It would be almost impossible to think 
of a more cumbersome system, or one which by its very nature would breed 
and perpetuate greater inequalities of every sort. Not only do these districts 
vary greatly in size and in wealth, but they vary greatly also in their intelli- 
gence respecting the importance of education, their zeal for the same, and 
their desire to support schools.

Under Oklahoma’s present district system, communities which so desire 
may refrain from voting any school district tax whatsoever, and need main- 
tain no school. This is the actual situation which is found every year in 
certain districts. We have seen, moreover, that wealthy districts levy in
-P-A-G-E-76
  60 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
many cases exceedingly low taxes, whereas the poorest districts in some 
counties levy taxes exceeding the limits established by law. Again we dis- 
cover these poorest of districts, which desire to provide good schools, have 
so little wealth to draw upon, that after having exerted themselves to the 
utmost of their ability, they are utterly unable to provide good schools.

LENGTH OF ScHOoL TERM 
In the year 1920 the average length of school year in the United States 
was 8.1 months. Data for 1921 for the United States as a whole are not 
available. If they were, we would undoubtedly find that the average length 
of school year had increased. Yet in 1921 in Oklahoma there were more 
than 1000 village and rural white districts which maintained school for six 
months or less. In 5 districts out of every 100 in the state the school year 
did not exceed five months. In 21 districts out of every 100 it did not 
exceed six months, and in 46 districts out of every 100 (nearly one half the 
entire number) it did not exceed seven months. 
Six states in the Union (one eighth of the total number, each of which 
had less wealth per child than Oklahoma, maintained in the year 1920 a 
school year of nine months or longer. These states, together with their 
length of school year and national rank as to wealth per child, are shown 
in Table IX.

Ranpom ExaMptes or UNSATISFACTORY CONDITIONS 
Other sections of this report describe the concrete situation found in 
schools visited by members of the survey staff. At the risk of repetition it 
may not be amiss;to point out a few pertinent facts here. Stress has been 
laid from time to time upon the unusual progress made by Oklahoma in the 
matter of consolidated schools. This is a movement undoubtedly deserving 
the highest commendation. Yet, when we discover that in Roger Mills 
County from $40 to $60 out of every $100 spent for maintenance is used to 
pay the costs of transportation, the matter assumes a somewhat different 
light. In one school visited it was discovered that the last busses for return- 
ing the pupils to their homes did not leave the schoolhouse until 6 p.m. One 
hundred pupils were compelled to remain from four to six o’clock. At Delhi, 
in Beckham County, the first busses leave the pupils’ homes at 6:30 a.m. 
To come within the limits of taxation, due to the high cost of transportation, 
school terms are shortened, and cheap, totally unfit teachers are employed. 
Oklahoma has every reason to be proud of many of her schools and many 
of her teachers, but when we find dirty schoolhouses in charge of equally 
dirty teachers we realize the necessity of radical changes. One of the most 
striking examples reported was in a consolidated school where the course in 
home economics was in charge of a man whose grimy countenance, dirty 
hands, filthy clothes, were a caricature and an affront to home-making. 
The law definitely requires every school in the state to own and display 
a United States flag. (See School Laws of Oklahoma, 1921, section 322.) 
More than this, the law provides that a fine of not less than $10 nor more 
than $100 shall be imposed for the violation of this law. Yet, out of seven- 
teen consolidated schools visited, only three had flags. This is a striking  
-P-A-G-E-78
  62 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
example of the impossibility of meeting the legal requirements as to supplies 
under Oklahoma’s present system of school finance. 
Some school districts which levy no tax are perhaps districts in which 
no children of school age reside, but this situation brings out one of the 
greatest faults of the district system; namely, that it permits property in 
such districts which ought to be available as a source of school revenue to 
escape any contribution for school purposes. There is no more reason why 
property within a school district in which no school children reside should 
escape contributing its just quota to the support of schools within the county 
of the state than that the property of a childless couple who live within a 
district should go untaxed for school purposes. 
Education is a function of the state. The powers and responsibilities 
possessed by school districts are, strictly speaking, delegated to them by the 
sovereign authority, the state. The right to tax the wealth of the entire state 
belongs to the state and should be utilized by the state to provide adequate 
school facilities for her children, 
Tue District System Is Not Democratic 
Any suggestion to abolish the district system arouses an outcry from 
many admirers of this century-old institution. Some of those who champion 
it most stoutly do so in the name of democracy. Others cry out against the 
establishment of the county or any other unit larger than the district which 
will result in making wealthy communities contribute to the education of 
children in poor communities. The utter shallowness of such arguments is 
clear to any unbiased citizen. As to preserving the district because of its 
so-called democracy, we may state that the chief reason for demanding its 
abolition is that it is the most undemocratic system that could be devised. 
The essence of democracy is equality of opportunity. We have shown that 
the district system not only fails to provide such equality but makes any ap- 
proach to equality impossible. 
A much stronger argument frequently presented for the district system 
is that it fosters local interest in public education, and that without such 
interest our schools would languish. Were the districts equally able to sup- 
port schools and equally zealous for education, such an argument would be 
valid, but the conditions existing in Oklahoma show not only that school 
districts are absolutely unequal in matters of zeal and ability, but that they 
can never approach even the slightest degree of such equality. 
Generations of district support and district control find one of the richest 
commonwealths in the richest nation on the earth denying multitudes of her 
children any educational opportunity whatever, and sending hundreds of 
others to school in dismal and unsanitary hovels under the tutelage of 
wretchedly underpaid and proportionately ignorant, untrained, and incompe- 
tent teachers. Such are the actual results of the time-honored, undemocratic 
district system in Oklahoma. :
-P-A-G-E-79
  ‘PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN OKLAHOMA 63 
The evils of the district system have been recognized and, pointed out by 
every leading authority on the organization and support of public schools 
for the last one hundred years. These leaders have been unanimous in their 
condemnation of the district system and their support of the county system. 
The state superintendent of one of our leading states wrote in his annual re- 
port some years ago: “There is neither hope nor justice in such a system. 
No scheme of state aid will ameliorate this condition. The only just system 
is the county as a unit for school support, as well as for administration and 
supervision.” 
Twenty-three states in the Union now have the county unit in some form. 
California requires every county to raise by county tax, a sum sufficient to 
provide $700 for every elementary, full-time teaching position. This sum 
is matched by the state. The remarkable progress which Alabama has made 
during the last five years has been due largely to her development, upon the 
advice of the United States Bureau of Education, of a strong county unit. 
A Step Towarp ELIMINATION OF INEQUALITIES 
From the standpoint of school finance, the county unit evens out the great 
inequalities in wealth which exist among the districts within the counties. 
Figure 6 has shown us the variation between the richest and poorest rural 
school districts in five Oklahoma counties: Grant, Cimarron, Kiowa, LeFlore, 
and Haskell. We have seen that in Grant County this variation extends from 
$82,000 to $3000 per child; in Cimarron, from $61,000 to $3000; in LeFlore, 
from $16,000 to $1000; and in Haskell, from $7000 to $1000. 
What would the adoption of the county in place of the district as a unit 
for furnishing school revenues do within these counties? This has already 
been shown in Figure 2, a reference to which will show that in Cimarron 
County it would place $10,000 back of every child. There would no longer 
be some communities with $61,000 and others with only $3000 back of each 
child, but the county would become, for the purposes of school support, one 
community and there would be for the support of education $10,000 back of 
every child in the county district. 
Sources oF Opposition TO IMPROVEMENT 
Any attempt to abolish the district and to supplant it by the county as a 
unit will undoubtedly meet with strong opposition. Part of this opposition 
will come from those who will maintain that the district system is democratic. 
A preceding paragraph has already answered this argument, and has shown 
that the district system is absolutely undemocratic because it is the most 
unequal system which could be devised. 
The most important and the most vehement opposition will undoubtedly 
come from wealthy communities, which, at the present time, are able to 
support fairly good schools from a low tax levy. This is always the case. 
This is the source of opposition which has been used in many states to defeat
-P-A-G-E-80
64 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
bills proposing an increase in state tax rates for schools. We have too long 
ignored the fact that the education of the children is not in any sense a local 
problem, nor a local responsibility. We recognize in other matters that the 
county and the state have the power to levy taxes sufficient to produce the 
revenues needed for the public good. We must recognize this in education 
also. 
Oklahoma’s present system of school finance is forcing thousands of poor 
communities to exert themselves far beyond their strength. It is letting 
large numbers of wealthy and comparatively wealthy communities escape 
from exerting any real effort. Worse than these facts are the results which 
have already been set forth; namely, that thousands upon thousands of chil- 
dren in Oklahoma are deprived of the chance which they would have, had 
they been so fortunate as to have been born in any one of a large number 
of states which have less wealth and are, therefore, less able to provide 
schools than Oklahoma, but which recognize the fact that the future pros- 
perity of the state depends first of all upon the education of her children. 
Unrair Metuop or Distriputine State Moneys 
In a preceding paragraph devoted to causes of Oklahoma’s educational 
backwardness it was stated that one of the four most important causes is 
“an unscientific method of apportioning State funds.” Oklahoma provides 
state moneys for common schools from three general sources: (1) appropria- 
tions (e.g., to the superintendent of public instruction, to the State Board 
of Education to match federal apportionments for vocational education) ; 
(2) a general property tax of one fourth of one mill; (3) the income of the 
permanent common school fund, which consists of rents from lands belong- 
ing to this fund and interest from the invested principal. 
The state appropriations are for specific projects, such as aiding rural 
schools in erecting buildings. They reach, therefore, only certain individual 
communities. Our interest at this point is in the so-called state school fund 
which consists of the proceeds of the state school tax and the income from 
the permanent common school fund and is distributed in such a manner as 
ultimately to reach every district in'the state. 
Figure 8 has shown us that in 1921 out of every $100 provided for public 
schools in Oklahoma the state furnished $9. Small as this amount is, if 
properly distributed, it could be made to play an important part in equalizing 
school burdens and educational opportunities. Oklahoma disburses her state 
school funds among the counties which, in turn, disburse the amounts thus 
received among the districts within the county on the basis of the number 
of children enumerated. This enumeration includes all children over six 
years of age and under twenty-one. 
This method is one of the most unscientific, most antiquated, and most 
unfair of all of the many methods of distributing state school funds employed 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN OKLAHOMA 65 
at the present time. The aim and theory back of this method are commend- 
able. It assumes that this method will give to every school child of this state 
an equal amount of assistance in getting an education. In its application, 
however, this method is totally unfair both to the school children of the state 
and to the school districts which provide schools. 
Derects or TH1s MetHop or APPpoRTIONMENT 
Space does not permit an elaborate discussion of the defects of appor- 
tioning state aid upon the basis employed by Oklahoma, namely school 
enumeration. However, some of them may be pointed out briefly. Appor- 
tioning school moneys on the basis of enumeration places no premium upon 
school attendance, length of school term, the number of months a teacher is 
employed, high salary and high qualifications of teachers, nor the effort to 
provide a good school as evidenced by the levying of a liberal tax. Worse 
than this it actually serves in some communities to encourage non-attendance. 
It does not give state moneys to the children actually in school, as it would 
do if state aid were apportioned on the basis of aggregate attendance. 
It ignores the fact that it is not chiefly the number of school children, but 
rather the number of teachers employed which determines what schools cost. 
A district employing one teacher to teach fifteen pupils will have to spend 
practically as much money as a district employing one teacher to teach thirty 
pupils, As long as school moneys are apportioned upon any per pupil 
basis, this supremely important fact is left out of consideration. 
If a state is to equalize school burdens she must in her method of dis- 
tributing aid take into consideration not only the number of teachers em- 
ployed but differences in ability to pride school revenue as measured by 
wealth per child or per teacher. 
This suggests a somewhat complex method of distributing funds. To 
this we reply that the school situation which was comparatively simple 
twenty-five years ago has today become exceedingly complex. This com- 
plex situation can no longer be dealt with by employing the crude rule-of- 
thumb methods which, although always totally inadequate, were less disastrous 
in their results at a time when the state was not forcing every community to 
provide schools for all children—in other words, when compulsory education 
laws were few in number and not rigidly enforced. 
ActuaL RESULTS OF THE PLAN 
What does Oklahoma’s present method of distributing her state school 
fund actually do? This can best be shown by comparing the amounts paid 
to various districts for the children actually in school. Such a comparison 
will show that, whereas in theory Oklahoma gives to the districts the same 
amount of state aid for each school child, as a matter of fact there is no 
equality whatever in the amounts districts receive for the children they are 
actually educating.
-P-A-G-E-82
  66 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
The evidence to support these statements is shown in Figure 9, which 
shows the situation with respect to the richest and poorest common school 
districts in five counties. 
From Figure 9 we see that the richest common school district in Grant 
County, which has back of each school child in average daily attendance no 
less than $82,000, receives $20 from the state, whereas the poorest district, 
which has back of each school child only $3000, receives from the state 
only $3. This is true of every county in the group except Haskell. In all 
the other counties the richest district gets the greatest amount of aid.

We have seen the injustice suffered by common school districts as the 
result of distributing .state aid on the basis of enumeration. The injustice 
is even greater, perhaps, in the case of some independent districts. In these 
districts the enrollment and the average daily attendance both commonly 
exceed the enumeration due to the presence of children from outlying dis- 
tricts who are transferred to the independent districts. The result is that the 
independent district has a large number of children coming to it from‘outside 
for whom the independent district receives no aid whatsoever from the state. 
The amount of tuition received from the outside districts, part of which, it 
is true, represents state aid to the latter, is so small that it is disregarded here. 
This situation is shown in Table X which follows.

Tue Pian Fairs To Acuteve Its Opjecr 
It is the aim of the state to provide every one of the independent districts 
included in Table X equal assistance. Ari example of the result of appor- 
tioning state aid on the basis of enumeration is that Helena receives from 
the state $1.80 for each child actually in school and McMann $3.54 for each 
child actually in school, yet McMann is more than six times as able to pro- 
vide school revenue as Helena and has in attendance only 67 per cent of its 
enumeration, whereas the attendance at Helena, probably due to the influx 
of non-residents, is 133 per cent of its enumeration. If the reader will com- 
pare other districts in this table he will find further convincing evidence of 
the unfairness and unsoundness of distributing school moneys on the basis 
of enumeration. 
Inequalities in school burdens, inequalities in ability to provide .school 
moneys, inequalities in effort, inequalities in assistance received from the 
state, inequalities in length of school year and in educational opportunities 
offered to the children of Oklahoma ; this is, in a nutshell, the story of public 
education in Oklahoma today. This is the vision which greets our eyes 
whether we fix our attention upon the counties or upon the districts. 
Table XI tells the story fori the nine representative counties which have 
been chosen for special study. These counties as we have said were chosen 
on the basis of their relative ability to support schools; namely, the wealth 
per school child. 
The three poorest counties presented in Table XI, LeFlore, McCurtain, 
and Haskell, are the only ones in which the average rate of district tax 
exceeds 10 mills. In Haskell the average rate is nearly 4 mills in excess of 
the lawful limit, 15 mills. Yet despite this exceedingly heavy rate the ex- 
penditure per child in Haskell is the lowest of the group, being, in fact, only 
$35.71. The average rate in LeFlore, although high when compared with 
the richer counties, is more than 5 mills less than the average rate in Haskell. 
Yet in LeFlore, more than eighteen districts out of one hundred have a school 
term of less than six months; whereas, in Haskell County only one district 
has a school term of less than six months. 
p INEQUALITIES AMONG DistTRICTs 
From this consideration of counties we now turn to the districts. Table 
XII shows inequalities of the same sort existing among common school 
‘district and Table XIII, among independent districts. ‘ 
In Table XII we present for the richest and poorest district in each of 
five counties, the assessed valuation per child, the ratio of the assessed 
valuation per child of the two districts compared, the district tax rate, annual 
expenditure, and total state aid per child, together with one or two other 
distinct facts.

PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN OKLAHOMA 71 
District No. 15 in Cimarron County is 17 times as able to provide 
school revenues as District No. 36. District No. 36 levies a 9-mill tax, but 
is able to expand only $51 per child; whereas, District No. 15 levies a 4-mill 
tax and spends $395 per child. Yet the richest district gets from the state $18 
for each school child ; whereas the poorest gets only $3. 
Equally significant is the situation in LeFlore County where the richest 
district, with an average daily attendance of 9 less than that in the poorest 
district, levies a 12-mill tax, expends $209 for each child, and receives $23 
for each child from the state; whereas, the poorest district levies a 15-mill 
tax, is able to expend only $24 per child, and receives only $4 from the state. 
That a similar situation exists in independent districts will be seen from 
Table XIII. 
From Table XIII we see that Helena, which in 1922 levied a total district 
tax rate of 23.5 mills and expended nearly $65 per school child, receives from 
the state only $1.80 per child in average daily attendance; whereas, Wagoner, 
which levied 10 mills less (13 mills), spends only $44.42 per child, receiving 
$2.55 from the state. 
A comparison of Walters with Vinita and Ramona will show still fur- 
ther the unfairness of Oklahoma’s method of distributing state aid. Walters 
levies a total tax of more than 19.3 mills, but is able to spend not quite $39 
per child. Vinita, which levies 16.2 mills, is able to spend nearly $100 and 
Ramona, whose total tax is only 15 mills, spends $163 per child. Yet the 
amount of state aid per child in average daily attendance received by Ramona 
and by Vinita is larger than that received by Walters. 
DecrEASING SHARE OF ScHooL BurDEN BorNE BY THE STATE 
Previous paragraphs have shown that one of the chief causes of inade- 
quate school funds and inequalities in Oklahoma is the district system. This 
system throws the responsibility of providing school revenues upon units so 
absolutely unequal in wealth, not to mention educational zeal, that it is 
humanly impossible for them ever to provide equal school funds. Worse 
still is the situation which we find in the poorest districts where even taxes 
exceeding the lawful limits do not provide adequate revenues. Not only is 
Oklahoma today throwing the major portion of her school burden upon 
these, the most unequal of all possible units, but the tendency throughout 
her history has been for the state to contribute a less and less proportion 
of the school funds and thus to force the districts to assume a heavier and 
heavier burden. 
Thus we find that, whereas, in 1910 the state furnished $16 out of every 
$100 provided for schools, in 1920 she provided only $3.20. Again, whereas, 
in 1910 the districts furnished only $76 out of every $100, in 1920 they 
furnished $80.40 while the counties furnished $12.10, thus making the total 
furnished by local units, counties, and districts $92.50.

We frequently hear citizens complain over the vast increases in the school 
moneys furnished by the state. It is true that the amount which the state 
has furnished has steadily increased, but this amount has failed increas- 
ingly to keep pace with the enormous growths in school expenditure, and 
particularly with the increases in the school moneys furnished by the local 
units, districts, and counties. The story of this declining importance of the 
state as a provider of public school revenue in Oklahoma is shown by Figure 
10, which follows. 
Figure 10

There is no reason to believe that school costs in Oklahoma will grow 
any less rapidly in the future than they have in the past. Indeed, all the 
facts before us leave no room to doubt that if Oklahoma is in any sense to 
measure up to the other states with which her wealth compares she must 
increase her school expenditure many times. If she is to do away with 
short school terms, under-trained teachers, and a multitude of other evils 
she must spend many times the money which she is at present expending. 
That she is able to do this was made evident in Table IV, which shows 
that, whereas, Oklahoma is exceeded by only eleven states in the Union as 
to ability to provide school revenues, she,is exceeded by forty-one with 
respect to the amount of money she is spending for each $1000 of her wealth. 
One of the most important questions which Oklahoma must face when she 
undertakes to provide these increased revenues is, where shall the money 
come from. 
To attempt in the future to continue the policy of depending upon school 
districts for the major proportion of school revenues, can lead only to in- 
equalities and to failures even greater than those which mark the present 
situation. It is absolutely essential that Oklahoma adopt as her local unit 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN OKLAHOMA 73 
from which to derive school revenues, one far more capable than the district 
of equalizing school funds. That the county is such a unit has already been 
shown. We have also pointed out definitely how the county would do this. 
Let us now ask to what extent will the adoption of the county unit result in 
equalizing school revenues throughout the state and in equalizing school 
burdens and educational opportunities. 
Wit tHe County Unit Eguatize Epucation 1n OKLAHOMA? 
There can be no doubt as to the great superiority of the county over 
the district as the unit of local organization and support for public schools. 
Nevertheless, facts already presented have shown that the counties of Okla- 
homa are very unequal in wealth and consequently very unequal in their 
ability to provide school revenue. However much Oklahoma may improve 
her educational situation by abolishing school districts and establishing the 
county as the local unit, flagrant and disastrous inequalities will continue 
as long as the schools of Oklahoma are obliged to depend upon local units, 
even though these units be counties, for the major portion of their support. 
Neither the county nor any other local unit which might be devised can 
equalize school revenues, school burdens, and educational opportunities. The 
state, and only the state, can do this. The truth of this assertion becomes 
increasingly evident the moment we survey Oklahoma’s seventy-seven coun- 
ties as is done in Figure 11. 
Figure 11 shows the seventy-seven counties of Oklahoma arranged in 
nine groups. The first of the columns at the left indicates the number of 
counties included in each of the nine groups; the second column, the per 
cent of Oklahoma’s total enumeration included in the total number of coun- 
ties in each group. The third column shows the valuation per child enu- 
merated in the richest and in the poorest county in each group. This is 
further represented by the bars composing the figures. 
ExtTREMES OF INEQUALITY AMONG THE COUNTIES 
Figure 11 shows us that the richest county in the state is more than seven 
times as able to provide school revenue as the poorest county. Of all the 
children in Oklahoma, 74 per cent live in counties where the valuation back 
of each child enumerated is less than $3000; 44 per cent, in counties where 
the valuation is less than $2000; 26 per cent, in counties where the valuation 
back of each child enumerated reaches from $3000 to $6000. See Figure 11. 
The impossibility of ever equalizing school revenues by setting up as 
the source from which the major portion of school funds is to be secured, 
units as unequal in wealth as the counties of Oklahoma, is too evident to 
require additional comment. No further argument should be necessary to 
convince every citizen of Oklahoma that even the abolition of the district 
and the establishment, in its place, of the county unit, although it will be a
-P-A-G-E-90
  
  74 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
most important step in the right direction, will never realize school revenues. 
Neither school burdens nor educational opportunities will ever be equalized 
as long as Oklahoma depends for the greater part of her public school revenue 
upon local units of any sort. Only the state or the state and the nation, will 
ever be able to bring about such equalization.

  Pustic Epucation Is a FUNCTION OF THE STATE—PuBLIC SCHOOLS 
ARE StTaTE INSTITUTIONS 
Public education is a function of the state, and public schools are state, 
not local, institutions. This declaration is not based upon theory, for the 
matter has been tested in the supreme court, and the court has ruled that 
public schools are state institutions, and that the powers exercised by local 
units are distinctly delegated powers. The wealth within a state available 
for taxation for the support of public schools belongs to the state, for 
all the children of the state. The district system is an inheritance from 
colonial days when schools were regarded, controlled, and supported as local 
charitable and semi-church institutions. That day is past, and Oklahoma 
should free herself from the shackles of a system which makes equality of 
educational opportunity impossible.

Equality of educational opportunity for all the children of the entire 
state, and equality of school burdens sustained by local school units, the 
counties, and the districts, constitute a brief but correct statement of the aim 
underlying general, that is state and county, aid. 
Equality implies much more than universal education and state-wide 
equality in the length of the school year. It means equality of conditions 
under which children study and play. It means trained teachers, and health- 
ful, well-equipped, inviting schoolhouses and yards, equality in the scope, 
vitality, and richness of studies. The only possibility of approaching equality 
in this broad sense lies partly in proper organization and administration of 
school units, and partly in equality of school support. Equality in school 
support means equal distribution of economic responsibility and economic 
power. Such economic equality can come only if the amount of aid granted 
to the school unit is determined on the basis of the ability (i.e., the financial 
resources) and upon the basis of a minimum of effort of this unit. 
Wuat Swarr or THE ScHoor BurpEN SHouLD BE Borne By THE STATE? 
Equality in educational opportunity will never be secured until the schools 
cease to be, in the last analysis, both from the standpoint of control and from 
the standpoint of support, dominantly local institutions and until the state 
provides, supports, and directs those factors upon which equality primarily 
depends, and which may, therefore, be termed the minimum essentials of 
educational equality. 
The factors which to the largest degree make the educational opportunities 
offered within the various communities of a state equal or unequal are: the 
number and quality of teachers employed, the length of school term, the 
effectiveness of general administration and supervision, and the quality and 
adequacy of the apparatus directly related to instruction, including especially 
such materials as textbooks. 
It is well known that teachers’ wages constitute the largest single item 
of school expenditure in every community and, also, that as is the teacher 
so is the school. Studies made in comparatively recent times have shown 
further that the quality of instruction is largely determined by the quality 
of supervision. Place upon the state the responsibility of furnishing funds 
to provide every school with enough money to pay a minimum salary to 
every teacher for an entire school year of uniform length, such minimum 
varying with the qualifications of the individual teacher, and further, place 
upon the state the responsibility of providing the materials directly related to 
instruction, and the moneys necessary to guarantee the scientific supervision 
of every school—and existing educational inequalities will be rapidly evened 
out. Let us now turn directly to the question, what proportion of total school 
revenue will the state be required to provide under this proposed plan, and 
what proportion will be furnished by the local school units?
-P-A-G-E-93
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN OKLAHOMA 77 
We can best answer this question by finding out what per cent of the 
total annual expenditure for public schools is devoted to the items just named. 
For this purpose we may consider the United States as a whole, and Cali- 
fornia, a state whose standards with respect to teachers’ salaries are exceeded 
by none and a state, moreover, which furnishes free textbooks. In 1915, 
practically 60 per cent of the total school costs in the United States were 
devoted to teachers’ salaries and textbooks; in California approximately 55 
percent. In 1918, the per cents were, respectively, 58 for the United States ; 
61 for California. In 1920, California devoted a little less than 63 per cent 
of her total school revenues to teachers’ salaries and textbooks. 
In general, we may say that from 60 to 65 per cent of total school costs, 
would, under normal conditions, be devoted to teachers’ salaries and text- 
books. Were we to add to these items the costs of adequate supervision 
and apparatus, other than textbooks, directly related to instruction, the 
per cent would probably range from 65 to 70. In any case, the proportion 
will vary from year to year and from community to community and conse- 
quently must be determined from time to time. The first step which the 
state must take is to determine the amount which she will provide for each 
unit of a minimum program, and then adopt ways and means of insuring this 
annually to the schools. 
If Oklahoma is not yet ready to go as far as the present report advises, 
which is to place upon the state from 65 to 70 per cent of the burden, then 
let her adopt some such policy as California has effectively carried on for 
many years and which has placed her among the very first states of the Union 
educationally. This policy, as we have already stated, guarantees $1400 a 
year to every elementary teaching position in the state, $700 from state sources 
and $700 from county sources. 
EstaBLisH AN INTERIM CoMMISSION ON SCHOOL FINANCE 
Oklahoma should provide for the establishment of an interim legislative 
commission on school finance, one of whose functions shall be to determine 
as nearly as possible the amount of money needed during the next biennium 
to pay the state’s share of the costs of teachers’ salaries, free textbooks, 
supervision, and other projects to be financed by the state. Such a com- 
mission should report this amount to the legislature at each session, and the 
legislature should forthwith take steps to provide the necessary revenue. 
It should be understood that the policy proposed here would not prevent 
counties from paying salaries above the minima fixed by the state where 
the electors of the county or the county school board should determine this 
to be advisable.  
-P-A-G-E-94

WuHeErE SHALL StaTE ScHoot Moneys CoME From? 
Any proposal to have the state furnish out of state funds from 65 to 70 
per cent of the total revenue needed for the support of public schools at once 
raises the question, from what sources shall the state derive these funds? 
Oklahoma has long had the reputation, both within her own borders 
and throughout the United States, of being possessed of a magnificent en- 
dowment for public schools, consisting of lands and moneys granted to her 
by the Federal government at the time of her admission into the Union. 
At the close of the fiscal year, June 30, 1921, this endowment amounted to 
approximately twenty-nine million dollars. 
Far more important than the value of Oklahoma’s endowment is the 
question whether the per cent of the total school revenue derived from this 
endowment is increasing or decreasing. In other words, the question is, can 
Oklahoma depend more and more upon this endowment, or must she depend 
less and less upon it? 
According to the data reported by the United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion in 1910, out of every $100 provided in Oklahoma for public schools 
$15.80 was furnished by the state. Not all, but by far the major portion, 
of this amount was derived from the permanent school fund. In 1915 the 
permanent school fund furnished approximately $12, and in 1920, $3.20 out 
of every $100 of public school revenue. In view of these facts it is evident 
that if the-state is to furnish an increasing proportion of the total school 
revenue this increase is not to be derived from the permanent school fund. 
Let us now consider from what other sources Oklahoma might derive school 
revenue. 
A State Tax, or LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS? 
There has been much discussion as to which is the better method of pro- 
viding school moneys for state aid, making appropriations out of the 
general fund or providing for a state tax, the proceeds of which shall be 
devoted to schools. 
In favor of the state tax versus state appropriations it has been urged 
that as the wealth, school population, and school costs increase, the income 
provided for the schools increases; also that whereas appropriations fre- 
quently depend upon the mood and sometimes even upon the whim of the 
legislature, a state tax is stable and its proceeds assured. Undoubtedly in- 
fluenced by these considerations the Minnesota State Board of Education 
in 1920 in its report upon The Revision of State Aid urged the substitution 
of a state mill tax for existing biennial appropriations. 
On the other hand, Illinois and California, after experimenting with the 
state school property tax, both abandoned it in favor of state appropriations. 
A very serious objection to the state school tax of a fixed rate is that there 
is no guarantee that it will furnish the amount of money necessary. This 
difficulty may, however, be avoided. Instead of fixing a definite rate, the  
-P-A-G-E-95
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN OKLAHOMA 79 
law may provide for the levy of a state mill property tax sufficient to raise 
a fixed sum, or, better yet, sufficient to enable the state to fulfill its obliga- 
tions to the public schools. 
Four 'states in the Union are already levying state school taxes of this 
sort; namely, Arizona, which levies a state tax sufficient to provide $20 per 
child in average daily attendance; Utah, which levies a tax of undetermined 
rate sufficient to raise $25 per child from 6 to 17 years of age; Washington, 
which levies a tax sufficient, when added to the income of the permanent 
school fund, to provide $20 per child of school age; and Wisconsin, which 
levies a tax sufficient to pay state aid to public schools. 
The problem of providing’school revenue is inseparable from the general 
problem of public finance. It is evident that if the state is to assume from 
65 to 70 per cent of the burden of school costs, she must either discover new 
sources of school revenue sufficient to produce the increased funds which 
she is to provide, or she must be allowed, in case these new sources are 
inadequate, to draw more heavily upon the sources which at present are 
furnishing state revenue. 
Among the new sources of revenue which we recommend to the careful 
consideration of the Oklahoma legislature, is a state graduated income tax. 
This is now effectively and satisfactorily employed as a source of school 
revenue in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Delaware. 
Oklahoma levies a gross earnings tax of 3 per cent on oil and other 
natural resources. Of this, the state retains 2 per cent, and returns 1 per 
cent to the counties from which derived. The county devotes one half of 
its quota to roads and the remaining one half is distributed among all the 
districts of the county on the basis of school enumeration. It is impossible 
to discuss here many questions pertinent to the gross earnings tax in Okla- 
homa. The very fact that the state retains two thirds of the proceeds is 
a definite recognition that she regards these natural products as belonging 
primarily and chiefly to the state and not to the communities in which they 
are located. This suggests at once the possibility of increasing state school 
revenues, by reapportioning the gross earnings proceeds. 
A survey of Table XIII will show that in some cases the districts which 
derive large revenue from the gross earnings tax are among the wealthier 
districts, and therefore have less need of revenue from this source than dis- 
tricts which receive nothing from the proceeds of the gross earnings tax. 
Only a careful study of the situation could determine whether or not the gross 
earnings tax could be advantageously reapportioned, and if so, how. 
Naturat RESOURCES OF THE STATE SHOULD Be Treatep As 
PERMANENT ENDOWMENT 
Attention should be called to the fact that the gross earnings tax is levied 
upon products which are severed from the soil, and that the removal of 
these products permanently impoverishes the state. The natural resources
-P-A-G-E-96
    80 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
_of a state should not be regarded as belonging to any single generation, but 
rather to all generations. For this reason Oklahoma should follow the 
example of Minnesota and certain other states, and devote the proceeds of 
her gross earnings tax to her permanent educational endowment funds. 
This would deprive the state and the schools of a large amount of current 
revenue. It must be evident, however, that in using the proceeds of the 
gross earnings tax, Oklahoma is using up what is essentially a reserve fund. 
In a state which is still as largely agricultural as Oklahoma, undoubtedly 
the major portion of all revenue must come from a general property tax. 
The rate of this tax, as has, been suggested, should not be fixed. On the 
contrary, it should be determined biennially on the basis of the amount of 
money which the state needs, in order to insure‘to each school the funds 
sufficient to equalize educational opportunities. 
With the abolition of the school district, every county should be required 
to levy a county school tax of a minimum rate. 
The revenue provided by the state should be turned into a state equaliza- 
tion fund. Out of this fund there should be insured a minimum sum for 
every teaching position in the schools. In addition, the state should provide 
an equalization fund to be distributed among those counties which levy a 
prescribed county rate and are yet unable to raise a sum per child, or per 
teacher employed, sufficient to provide satisfactory facilities; i.e., facilities 
measuring up to the standards established by the State Department of 
Education. To guard against the employment of an excessive number of 
teachers, some such method as that employed by California would needs be 
adopted, namely: estimating one teacher for each school having thirty-five 
or less pupils in average daily attendance, and one additional teacher for 
each additional thirty-five pupils or fraction of thirty-five not less than ten 
as shown by the report for the preceding year. 
In striking contrast to Oklahoma’s present policy of depending less and 
less upon the state for school revenues, we may note a marked tendency in 
more progressive states, such as Washington, California, Montana, and Texas 
to increase greatly the quota of state school moneys. 
California, in 1921, increased the amount to be furnished by the state 
from $15 to $30 for every pupil in average daily attendance in high schools, 
and from $17.50 to $30 for every pupil in elementary schools. Every county 
in California is required to levy a tax for elementary schools sufficient to pro- 
vide $30 per pupil in average daily attendance, and an additional tax sufficient 
to provide $60 per high school pupil in average daily attendance. Colorado, 
by legislation enacted in 1921, placed at the disposal of the state superin- 
tendent of public instruction the entire income from her permanent 
school fund to be used, if necessary, to insure the maintenance of minimum 
standards as to teachers’ salaries.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Preceding pages have described existing educational conditions in Okla- 
homa and present policies; they have not only pointed out the defects but 
have in many instances suggested remedies. They have also explained the 
reasons for many of these recommendations. It is desirable to bring together 
here at the close of this chapter a brief résumé of the recommendations 
offered. There are added to the recommendations already specifically pre- 
sented, certain others which, although not stated, are, by implication or as a 
consequence of principles laid down, contained therein. 
1. Abolish the present antiquated, unfair methods of apportioning state 
school moneys, and adopt modernized, scientific methods which will recog- 
nize variations among the local school units as to equalized valuation per 
teacher or per child in average daily attendance, returns from a minimum 
local tax rate, number and qualifications of school officers and teachers 
employed. 
2. Abolish present plan of school district organization. 
3. Establish the county as the local school unit. 
4. Remove all limitations on state and local taxation. 
5. Establish 8 months (160 days) as the minimum school term, begin- 
ning in 1924-25, and 9 months thereafter. 
6. Require a minimum county school tax of not less than ten mills. 
7. Extend to counties taxing and bonding powers for school purposes. 
The plan here proposed of abolishing school districts and of establishing the 
county as the local unit of support will equalize local rates of taxation within 
the counties. 
8. Provide a state equalization fund to be apportioned among those 
counties which levy a county school tax equal to the state average county 
school tax, but are unable to produce thereby for every child of school age 
resident in the county a quota equal to the state average county quota per 
child derived from proceeds of such county taxes. 
9. Empower and require the State Department of Education to fix and 
to modify from time to time, as conditions seem to warrant, the requirements 
and standards which counties must meet in order to receive quotas of state 
moneys. 
to. Require county and all other school boards to prepare annually a 
budget of estimated school costs for the next succeeding year, such budget 
to be submitted to the proper authorities and used as a basis for levying taxes. 
11. Require the counties to formulate and provide for the carrying out 
of a county building program, to provide new buildings and other new school 
property. 
12. Abolish the office of county superintendent as an elective office, and 
place the appointment and fixing of the salary of the county superintendent 
in the hands of the county board of education, subject only to the limits as
-P-A-G-E-98
    82 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
to professional qualifications and minimum salary fixed by the State Board 
of Education. 
13. Establish an amount not less than that paid to city superintendents 
in first class city systems as the minimum salary of county superintendents. 
The office of county superintendent should be thoroughly professionalized. 
Nowhere is skilled supervision more important than in rural communities, 
owing to the large numbers of untrained and inexperienced teachers to be 
found in such communities. Specific and high professional qualifications 
should be prerequisites for eligibility to the office. 
14. Provide for every county, supervisors or teacher helpers of qualifi- 
cations sufficient to entitle said supervisor to a salary not less than that paid 
to expert supervisors employed in first class city school systems, appointment 
to be made by county board of education on nomination of the county super- 
intendent upon the basis of qualifications fixed by the State Board of 
Education. 
15. Provide for a state graduated income tax upon the proceeds of which 
public schools and other educational institutions shall have first claim. 
16. Create a state special commission on taxation. Such a commission 
is needed at the present time in Oklahoma to make a thorough study of her 
system of assessing property and levying and collecting taxes. The State 
Board of Equalization insists that property is now assessed at its fair cash 
value. Members of the survey staff frequently heard it stated by individual 
citizens that property is assessed at not more than one-third its true value, 
and striking examples supporting these statements were given. 
17. Create a state interim legislative educational budget commission, 
which shall prepare and recommend to the next legislature an educational 
budget. 
18. Provide for the raising by state taxation of funds sufficient to finance 
all educational projects, positions, and instructions subsidized by the state. 
19. Provide for the State Department of Education funds sufficient to 
enable it to dispense entirely with aid from private foundations. 
20. Place the appointment and the fixing of the salary of the state 
superintendent of public instruction in the hands of the State Board of 
Education. 
21. Provide a salary fund for the State Department of Education suffi- 
cient to enable the State Board of Education to employ a state superintendent 
capable of commanding from $7000 to $10,000, and to pay other members 
of the staff proportionately, in each case the salary to be determined on the 
basis of professional qualifications. 
22. Establish and provide for the maintenance of a Division of School 
Buildings within the State Department of Education. 
23. Provide for state continuing appropriations sufficient to match fed- 
eral, private, and all other subventions the receipt of which requires moneys 
provided from within the state.
-P-A-G-E-99
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN OKLAHOMA 83 
24. Abolish 6 to 21 years as the scholastic age, and establish in its stead 
as the scholastic age, 5 to 18 years. 
25. Provide that state tax rates for educational projects shall be de- 
termined biennially on the basis of the amount of money required, in addition 
to that available from the endowment fund and all other continuing sources, 
to provide adequate funds for all educational projects to be subsidized by 
the state. ‘ 
26. Provide state funds to grant special additional aid to encourage 
consolidation, transportation, free textbooks, and employment of teachers, 
superintendents, and other school officers of qualifications higher than the 
lawful minimum, and to subsidize new and progressive types of educational 
effort. Such aid shall be limited to counties (or to districts) whose equalized 
valuation per teacher or per child in average daily attendance falls below the 
state average. 
27. Empower and require the State Board of Education to establish 
and modify from time to time, as conditions warrant, a scale of educational 
and professional requirements for all positions to be subsidized entirely or in 
part by the state, and a corresponding salary scale in which salaries paid shall 
vary according to the professional preparation, experience, and class of cer- 
tificate of the incumbent. 
28. Provide for an adequate and reliable school census. 
29. Require the State Department of Education to prepare a uniform 
system of recording receipts and expenditures, and an accompanying hand- 
book of detailed instructions such as have been compiled by the state depart- 
ments of New York and Pennsylvania. 
30. Require the State Department of Education to furnish free to 
counties all forms for financial accounting and reporting. 
31. Summarizing the most important tendencies of forward looking 
legislation which underlie many of the recommendations contained in the 
preceding sections, tendencies which must be recognized and accepted before 
school burdens and educational opportunities can be equalized in any 
thoroughgoing manner: 
Place upon the state (which is the only unit capable of equalizing school 
burdens and educational opportunities) the major portion of the burden of 
school support by requiring the state to furnish funds sufficient to pay the 
minimum wage to which every incumbent of an educational position is en- 
titled by reason of his qualifications, professional and otherwise. This rec- 
ommendation covers salaries of superintendents, assistants, rural supervisors, 
and all members of the staff of the State Board of Education. 
The important items of expenditure which would be left to the local 
communities to subsidize, if this recommendation be adopted, would be 
school buildings, sites, equipment, cost of furnishing, repairs, and operating 
school buildings, as well as all fixed charges.

CHAPTER IIT 
THE EDUCATIONAL SITUATION 
The present account of school support in Alabama was originally pub- 
lished in 1919 (see Educational Administration and Supervision 5 :303-24, 
365-86). Since the time of its publication, Alabama has enacted a number 
of important laws which have not only modified fundamentally her system 
of school support but which have made marked changes for the better in 
her educational system. In view of these facts, the author regrets that it 
has not proved possible to revise even more completely than is done in the 
following pages the present account. Nevertheless, no apology is offered. 
The studies included in the present series of four volumes are very largely 
the work of one individual and this work has now extended over a period 
of nearly nine years. At the time the first of these studies was completed 
the most recent data available were those for the year 1915. As far as pos- 
sible before publication, these studies have been revised individually and 
brought up to date. However, since the chief purpose of a series of such 
studies is the revelation of principles and since the discovery of principles 
must come through a comparison of a number of varying types, it is evident 
that a description and interpretation of such types are matters of far more 
importance than a presentation of accounts strictly up to date. Consequently, 
the fact that it has proved impossible in the case of Alabama to revise the 
study in every detail, will in no wise lessen its value to scientific students 
of the problems of school finance. Moreover, the permanent value of any 
account must depend primarily upon the accuracy and clearness with which 
policies and data are presented and interpreted, for any account however 
strictly up to date at the time of publication, would soon be a story of prac- 
tices modified or abandoned, so rapidly are changes taking place in many 
of our states. Much of the present study as originally published in 1919, 
centered around 1915. To a large extent in its present revised form the 
study includes 1920 and 1922 data. 
There are many reasons why a study of the system of school support of 
Alabama is a matter of universal interest. Admitted into the Union, in 1819, 
few states other than the original thirteen have a longer educational history. 
Few states have lost or diverted more princely endowments originally 
created to provide free schools; few have been slower to attempt to provide 
educational opportunities; few states at the present time have greater ob- 
stacles to overcome; few during the past five years have made more whole- 
hearted and more courageous efforts to reform an inadequate, antiquated, 
and totally undemocratic system of education, to wipe out illiteracy, and 
make education both universal and free.

  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ALABAMA 89 
Before attempting to consider Alabama’s system of school support it will 
be well to endeavor to gain some conception of her general educational situ- 
ation. This can be most easily and quickly done by presenting tabularly 
certain data. Table I attempts to show for the year 1915: 
A. The conditions with which the school has to deal ; 
B. The financial support given by the state to the efforts of the schools; 
C. The results of the interaction of A and B, as seen on the enrollment, 
attendance, length of school year, illiteracy, and teachers’ aver- 
age salary. 
Important aspects of the school situation in 1920 and 1922 are shown 
in Tables IV and V and in Tables XVIII to XXII. 
From Table I it is evident that in 1915 Alabama, compared with the other 
commonwealths of the Union, ranked among the lowest with respect to 
every important feature in the educational system: namely, forty-seventh in 
the percentage of the children enrolled in school; forty-fifth in the per- 
centage of those enrolled who were in daily attendance; forty-third in the 
annual expenditure per child; forty-fourth in the length of school year; 
thirty-ninth in teachers’ average wage; forty-seventh in literacy. 
The explanation of these lamentable conditions is to be found partly in 
the poverty of this state, for in valuation per pupil enrolled she ranked, in 
the year 1920, forty-first in the Union. The causes are, however, many, not 
one. Inadequate school support, meager and unequal educational opportunity 
are inseparable from half-hearted belief in the desirability of universal edu- 
cation. Each is cause and each is effect. The fact that over eighty per cent 
of the population is rural, that nearly half the population is negro, the per- 
sistence of social traditions and attitudes inherited from centuries when 
negroes were slaves are probably some of the most powerful sources of 
factors which have made almost inconceivably difficult the developing either 
of public zeal or public support for free universal education. What formi- 
dable obstacles to educational progress have resulted from this racial division 
and from this scattering of the population throughout isolated rural com- 
munities, become evident the moment we compare the provisions for educa- 
tion of negro children with those made for white, or for children living in 
rural communities with those living in cities. 
The reports of the Alabama Department of Education give only meager 
data from which to deduce the wide variation between rural and urban 
educational opportunities ; nevertheless, the annual reports contain many gen- 
eral statements sufficient to reveal the vast inequalities in educational op- 
portunity prevailing throughout the state. In 1915 the superintendent of 
education wrote: 
More than three out of five of our school children are country boys and girls. The 
school problem of Alabama, therefore, is of necessity a rural problem, and this is even 
more real than the figures ‘above would indicate, for the reason that our cities and towns 
have already brought their schools up to a fairly high standard of efficiency, while  
-P-A-G-E-106
  90 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
in illiteracy, in the character of school buildings, in ‘the quality of supervision, in the 
length of the school term, and in the percentage of attendance, the country school lags 
far behind.*

Again in 1916 the superintendent wrote: 
The fact that the value of school buildings in the forty-three cities is greater than 
their value in all the rural districts and in ‘all the towns of less than 2000 inhabitants 
in the state combined, becomes noteworthy when we are reminded that 82 per cent of 
the total population lives in rural Alabama.’

Tables IV and V show that, however much progress Alabama made in 
the five years between 1915 and 1920, there were still wide variations in 
educational opportunities between the two races, white and negro, and be- 
tween the two types of communities, urban and rural. 
From this consideration of the general educational situation, we may 
now turn to the questions in which the chief interest of the present study 
lies: (1) from what sources Alabama derives her moneys for public schools ; 
(2) how these moneys are disbursed; (3) to what objects they may be 
lawfully applied; (4) the results of the present system of school support; 
(5) changes needed and recommendations. Each of these questions will be 
considered in turn in the chapters which follow.
-P-A-G-E-109
  CHAPTER IV 
SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUE 
At the present time Alabama derives moneys for the support of her 
public schools from federal, state, county, and district sources as well as 
from certain private funds and foundations. The most important of these 
private funds are the John F. Slater fund, the Anna T. Jeanes fund, Phelps 
Stokes fund, General Education Board and the Rosenwald fund. It will 
be helpful at the outset to ascertain how much each of these groups of 
sources furnish and the relative importance of the same. This is done in 
the two immediately following tables, the first of which shows the sources of 
public school revenue in 1915 and the second similar data for 1918. It will 
be noted that in the table for the year 1915 no contribution from federal 
sources is indicated. This is due to the fact that it was not until after the 
passage of the Smith-Hughes Act in 1917 that the public schools of Alabama 
began to receive aid from the Federal government.

1917, Vol. II, pp. 51-52. 
» Practically all this sum is derived from state appropriations made to cover interest on losses 
or diverted principal. 
© This per cent is possibly too large.   
The two most striking facts revealed by the above tables are the rela- 
tively small proportion of school moneys derived from local taxation and 
the correspondingly large proportion derived from the state. In 1918 no 
other state in the Union drew so large a proportion of its total public school 
revenue from the state and so small a share from local sources.? Of interest 
‘also is the small per cent derived from the income of permanent funds and 
lands. From this general consideration we may now turn our attention to 
the various funds included within each of the above general groups.

  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ALABAMA 95 
FEDERAL AID 
Smith-Hughes subventions——Under the Smith-Hughes Act passed Feb- 
ruary 23, 1917,° appropriations which will ultimately amount to over 
$7,000,000 annually, have been made available as aids to the states for pro- 
moting vocational education in agriculture, trades, industries, and home 
economics. This is the only federal aid which Alabama receives for the sup- 
port of public schools, except for a negligible grant from the proceeds of 
federal forest reserves. One of the many conditions to be fulfilled in order 
to share in Smith-Hughes moneys is that the state shall match the federal 
subventions dollar for dollar. Moreover, federal moneys are paid to the 
states only as reimbursements for moneys already expended. 
Alabama was embarrassed by the conditions created by the war and by 
the fact that the legislature would not meet until 1919. Owing to this latter 
condition, the governor, in keeping with a special power conferred in the 
act, accepted for Alabama the provisions of the federal law.* The total 
subventions available to Alabama in 1918 amounted to $39,575.42.> Ala- 
bama expended in that year only $9,745.56 as follows:° for vocational agri- 
cultural education $4850; for trade, industrial subjects, and home economics 
$1303.54; for teacher-training $3592.02, leaving an unexpended balance of 
$24,829.86, approximately 62 per cent of the available federal fund. That 
this failure to use the available federal moneys was due to conditions rather 
than to a lack of zeal for vocational education is suggested by the fact that 
in 1920 the unexpended balance amounted to only 16.6 per cent. This fact, 
as well as the federal moneys available and the total expenditure for voca- 
tional education in 1920 are presented in Table VIII. 
State Arp 
“Educational fund,”’ general educational fund,’ school fund,® and public 
school fund’? are used in the constitution, the laws, and the official reports 
of Alabama to designate the total state moneys provided for public schools 
derived from the following sources: (1) the state school tax; (2) state 
appropriations; (3) interest paid by the state on state permanent school 
funds; (4) certain other miscellaneously derived school moneys. This edu- 
cational fund is a current fund and must be carefully distinguished from the 
four common school funds held in trust by the state, and whose income con- 
stitutes a part of the educational fund. The educational fund is derived in 
all from no less than thirteen sources, as is shown by Table IX.

PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ALABAMA 97 
State school tax and escheats—From Table IX we see that the various 
school funds provided by the state in Alabama fall naturally into four major 
groups; appropriations, a state school tax, the income of permanent funds, 
escheats. The detailed analysis of these funds presented in the table below 
makes unnecessary any prolonged description of the same. As to the state 
tax, the law provides for the levying of “a special annual tax of 30 cents 
on each $100 worth of taxable property in this state.”"* It is evident from 
Table IX that the proceeds from this tax are simply credited to the state 
educational fund. In like manner are credited to the state educational fund 
“all such sums as may accrue to the state as escheats.”!* 
TABLE IX—Sources oF THE State EpucaTIoNAL Funp 
I. State Appropriations 
A. General State Appropriations 
1. Four appropriations to pay annual interest on the permanent common school 
funds held in trust by the state® 
a. 6 per cent on the sixteenth section fund 
b. 6 per cent on the valueless sixteenth section fund 
c. 6 per cent on the school indemnity land fund 
d. 4 per cent on the United States surplus revenue loan fund 
2. “An annual legislative appropriation,” the exact amount to be determined by 
the governor on the basis of the condition of the state treasury 
a. $500,000 annually for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1920, and 
for every year thereafter 
b. An additional sum of $250,000 for the fiscal year beginning October 
I, 1921, and an additional sum of $350,000 for the fiscal year begin- 
ning October 1, 1922. Such appropriation “to be released at the dis- 
cretion of the governor and to cease after the year 1922-23”> 
B. Special State Appropriations 
1. To encourage local taxation 
Bonuses of from $1000 to $3000 to counties levying a special county school 
tax of from 1 to 3 mills¢ 
For the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1919, $198,000 and every year 
thereafter $201,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary4 
2. For rural school buildings 
For the erection, repair, and equipment of rural schoolhouses an annual 
appropriation of $134,000,° (ie, $2000 for each of the 67 counties) 
Additional appropriation of $87,500 for each year of the quadrennium 
1919-23 for architects’ services, specifications, etc.f

» Ibid., p. 118, Act 703, 14. These annual appropriations are used for various specified projects. 
The State Department of Education in 1915 stated that the then existing annual appropriation was 
$350,000 (General Public School Laws of Alabama, 1915, p. 4, footnote). We learn from an Educa- 
tional Study of Alabama, p. 490, that this legislative appropriation is reduced by taking from it a 
number of appropriations which on their face seem to be distinct and additional appropriations. “From 
this legislative appropriation of $350,000 must be deducted $112,000 for normal school maintenance; 
$67,000 for the erection, repair, and equipment of schoolhouses, and $6500 for the teachers’ institute 
fund leaving in all a fund of $161,500.”

Appropriations—Appropriations for public schools fall into two classes, 
general and special. Special appropriations are those which are made to 
aid or encourage the maintenance of some project or policy. Thus we find 
that Alabama provides for an annual appropriation of $134,000 to aid in 
the erection of rural school buildings and an annual appropriation of $201,000 
to encourage counties to levy county school taxes. General appropriations, 
on the other hand, are made for no special or specified project but merely 
for the aid in general of public schools. Some appropriations are for a 
year or a biennium. Alabama has recognized, along with certain other 
states, the desirability of insuring that certain types of appropriation shall 
be continued. Consequently she has in many cases passed laws which pro- 
vide for a definite appropriation to be made for a certain year and for every 
year thereafter. Such appropriations are commonly called continuing ap- 
propriations. Table X shows the objects for which the state has provided 
continuing appropriations and the amounts appropriated.

All appropriations in this table are continuing appropriations except numbers 15 and 16, which are obviously only for the year 1920. All appropriations 
are paid “out of any moneys in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated.” 
> The law provides for an annual appropriation of $500,000 and possible additional appropriations are indicated under the head “discretionary” if in the 
judgment of the governor the condition of the state treasury will permit this addition. Cf. Educational Study of Alabama, p. 488, footnote, and General Pub- 
lic School Laws of Alabama, 1913, p. 4, footnote. The law definitely provides for discontinuance of this discretionary appropriation after January 1, 1923.

of $15,000 stipulates that such shall hereafter be paid into the state treasury. 
®Including the cost of professional and clerical help, necessary equipment, and supplies. 
h Section 2 of Act 545 provides that the balance of the rural schoolhouse fund unexpended on October 1, to19, shall revert to the state treasury and 
in lieu thereof there shall be made this supplementary annual appropriation for four years. Any unexpended balances shall at the close of each fiscal year be 
apportioned equally among all the counties of the state. ‘On September 1 of each year any balance of the appropriation unexpended and for which ap- 
plication shall not have been approved shall be reapportioned among the counties which have application pending in excess of the appropriations for said county. 
K The law provides that the state shall appropriate for each fiscal year a’sum not less than the maximum amount allotted to Alabama under the pro- 
vision of the Smith-Hughes Act. Different sums are appropriated for each year through 1922 on the basis of the estimated amount required to match the 
federal: grant. 
1 Five thousand dollars of the annual appropriation may be expended for salaries and other expenses attendant upon supervision and inpsection of county 
high schools. 
™ The law provides an increasing annual appropriation which is definitely fixed for the quadrennium 1919-22, inclusive. The maximum amount is 
$200,000 for the year 1922-23. 
° The law provided for the year 1919-20 an appropriation of $4500 for nine schools but only $3000 for the tenth. Beginning with the fiscal year

  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ALABAMA 99 
Permanent funds ——Alabama in her constitution, in her laws, and in her 
system of state school support assumes the existence of the four following 
permanent common school funds: the sixteenth section fund, the valueless 
sixteenth section fund, the school indemnity land fund, and the surplus 
revenue fund. The scope of the present article does not permit an account 
of the history of these funds.1? Suffice it to say that the first three owe 
their origin to the 901,725 acres of sixteenth section township land granted 
to Alabama by the Federal government upon the state’s admission into the 
Union in 1819. The fourth fund owes its origin to Alabama’s share 
($669,089) of the United States surplus revenue loan distributed among 
the states in accordance with an act of Congress approved June 23, 1836. 
The school indemnity land has been derived from “lands which have been 
heretofore, or may hereafter be certified to the state for the use and benefit 
of the several townships or districts in which there was a deficiency in the 
amount of land originally certified to the state for their benefit.”1* The value- 
less sixteenth section fund and surplus revenue fund have no existence except 
upon the books of the state. Both represent endowments entrusted to the 
state, the principal of which was long ago lost, diverted, or used for general 
state expenses.1* Neither in any way lessens the burden of school support, 
since the income assigned to each in the accounts of the state is not derived 
from any productive investment, but represents merely an appropriation 
drawn from the revenues of the state, which revenues in the last analysis, 
come from the pockets of the citizens. The case is somewhat different with 
respect to the sixteenth section fund and school indemnity land fund, owing 
to the fact that a portion of the school lands belonging to these funds still 
remains unsold. Nevertheless as fast as the sixteenth section lands or school 
indemnity lands are sold, the proceeds are paid into the state treasury, used 
for state purposes, and the amount credited to the township and district in 
proportion to their respective original interest therein.1* Hence it follows 
that the only real capital of these two funds consists of unsold school lands 
reported in 1914 as totaling 266,001.51 acres.*® 
The surplus revenue fund may be regarded as a state fund, but it is 
difficult to know whether to class the three other permanent funds as state 
or as local funds, owing to the conflict between the principle underlying the 
legal and constitutional provisions relating to them and the principles in ac- 
cordance with which they are administered. The fact that the proceeds of 
the sales of the sixteenth section and other school lands, when turned into

the state treasury are placed to the credit of the county, township,” or 
district to which the same belong, in proportion to their interest therein, is 
evidence that although the principal is turned over to the state, the funds 
are regarded by the law as local funds and not as constituting one general 
state fund. Further evidence of this local ownership is found in the fact 
that although the management of school lands is entrusted to the state super- 
intendent of education, “no school lands, except indemnity lands, shall be 
sold without the consent of the inhabitants of the township or district in 
which such lands are located.”1* Moreover, when the state superintendent 
apportions the public school fund, he is required by law to “first set apart 
to each township or school district the amount due from the state thereto 
as its interest on the sixteenth section fund or other fund held by the state.”?9 
Although the local ownership of these funds is thus carefully recognized 
and consistently insisted upon by the constitution, the laws, and methods of 
state accounting, it will be seen later that the “educational fund” (of which 
the income of these trust funds is a part) is distributed in a manner which 
nullifies the effect of this local ownership and to all practical purposes unites 
the income of these many local endowments into one current fund and dis- 
burses this in such a manner as to make of it for all practical purposes a 
general state school fund.”° 
The amounts of the principal and the income of the funds just described 
is shown for the years 1905 and 1920, respectively, in the following table.

Sources of increase-—The principal of the valueless sixteenth section 
fund and that of the surplus revenue fund are unchanging from year to 
year, since both of these funds are permanent state debts. It follows that 
there are no sources for increasing either. 
The only sources provided for increasing the sixteenth section fund and 
the principal of the school indemnity land fund include the following: 
(1) the proceeds of the sales of land belonging to these funds;?? (2) the 
proceeds of the rent of school lands ;?* (3) the proceeds of royalties paid 
by persons operating school lands as mineral, gas, or oil properties,?* and 
(4) the proceeds of two classes of fines as follows: (a) a fine of $25 per 
tree collected from “any person who without authority cuts down, boxes, 
or injures, or destroys any tree on school lands;’** (b) fifty dollars, being 
one half of the fine, to be levied upon any court clerk who fails to fulfill 
his duties, as prescribed by law, with reference to school lands which are 
due to be forfeited to the state.2* From 1905 to 1914 the principal of the 
sixteenth section fund increased $133,934, an average of $15,437 per year; 
and the principal of the school indemnity land fund increased $52,570, an 
average annual increase of $5841.?° 
How fluctuating are the amounts added annually to the principal of the 
sixteenth section and school indemnity fund may be seen from the following

Decreasing reldtive importance of permanent funds—In the fifteen years 
from 1905 to 1920 the aggregate principal of all permanent common school 
funds in Alabama increased $266,079 and the increase in revenue from 
these funds to $15,966, the average annual increase in revenue being approxi- 
mately $1064. Meanwhile, the total annual public school revenue had in- 
creased from $1,588,561?" in 1905 to $9,751,172,?% a total increase of 
$8,162,611 and an average annual increase of $544,174. The decreasing 
relative importance of public permanent common school funds in Alabama 
as a source of school revenue is shown by the fact that whereas 9.8 per 
cent?’ of the total annual school receipts was derived from permanent funds 
in 1905, in 1920 only 2 per cent was derived from permanent funds.” 
County anp District Arp 
County and district school taxes—It will be found from the immediately 
following paragraphs why, in the case of Alabama, the amount of district 
and school taxes is given together. We shall see that the same constitu- 
tional and legislative provisions provide for both and that districts are not 
permitted to levy school taxes until a county school tax has first been levied. 
County and district taxation for schools is a distinctly recent development 
in Alabama. To quote State Superintendent Feagin, “when the constitu- 
tion of 1875 was adopted, the people of the state, for their own protection 
against exploitations by those from without and within who had recently 
come to exercise the right of suffrage voluntarily surrendered the right 
of local taxation for schools.’’*° The first great step toward developing a 
policy of local taxation was provided in 1901 by the new constitution which 
permitted counties by a three-fifths majority vote to levy a one-mill county 
school tax, provided, that such tax rate shall not increase the combined state 
and county rate to more than 12.5 mills.*t As a consequence of this provi- 
sion one county after another voted to levy a special county tax, until in 
the year 1914-15, forty-six of Alabama’s sixty-seven counties levied such a 
tax and derived therefrom an aggregate sum of $639,397.°" 
It will be observed that the above constitutional amendment made no pro- 
vision whatever for the levying of a district tax. It was inevitable that 
educational leaders in Alabama comparing her relatively educational status 
and meager funds with those of more advanced states in the north and in 
the west, and discovering that these latter states derived the major portion

of their school support from district taxation, should be persuaded that the 
solution of Alabama’s difficulties was to be largely found in district taxation. 
The evils of the district system of school support have been pointed out by 
the author of the present study again and again. Whatever may be the 
final outcome of Alabama’s adoption of this policy, the fact remains that 
in November, 1916, an amendment to the constitution was adopted which 
permits every county by a majority vote of its electors to levy, in addition 
to the one-mill county school tax provided by the constitution of 1901, a 
county school tax not to exceed 3 mills and also to allow any district within 
any county which levies and collects a three-mill county school tax to levy 
and collect a district school tax not to exceed 3 mills.** “No district tax 
may be levied until after a county millage tax has been voted. This is to 
safeguard the poorer sections of the county and give them the benefits of 
sharing in the wealth of richer, corporate, and other interests, all of which 
is eminently fair.”*4 
' In addition to the taxes, which according to the above new constitutional 
amendment might be levied by all counties and all school districts, certain 
counties and certain districts by the provisions of previous constitutional 
legislative enactments were privileged to levy special local additional school 
taxes. Thus whereas the constitution of 1901 had by general provision lim- 
ited the county school tax for the state as a whole to one mill, by special 
provisions, Mobile and Baldwin counties levied a three-mill tax, Escambia 
County a two-mill tax, and Jefferson County a one and a half mill tax.%* 
Again whereas the constitution of 1go1 had limited the tax rate of municipal 
corporations to five mills some seventeen cities and one town** were em- 
powered to levy additional taxes for various purposes. Sometimes the 
purposes were general and undefined, sometimes they were specific, schools 
being mentioned in several cases.*7 These specific rights to levy local school 
taxes, possessed by the counties and municipal districts referred to, were 
not affected by the amendment adopted in 1916. Consequently they continue 
to enjoy the right of levying such taxes in addition to the three-mill county 
or three-mill district tax.** 
The eagerness of the counties and districts to avail themselves of the 
opportunity for increasing school revenue by local levies is shown by the 
rapidity with which they voted local taxes. Out of Alabama’s sixty-seven

counties in the year 1916-17, four counties voted a two-mill tax and twenty- 
five counties a three-mill tax.*° “The county and district taxes which will 
be levied and collected during the year 1918-19 will total over $2,000,000, 
practically as large as the combined annual constitutional and legislative 
funds available prior to the adoption of the amendment (i.e., the Consti- 
tutional Amendment of 1916).’4° The growing importance of the district 
tax was indicated again by the distinct, though somewhat loose, statement 
that the sum raised by district tax within cities, incorporate towns, and rural 
districts in 1918 was as large as that ($425,000) raised within twenty-four 
counties, in the same year.*° In 1920 every county in the state, except one, 
voted a three-mill county tax. Many counties voted a district tax in from 
I to 20 districts. In two counties a local tax was voted by every district.** 
In 1922, 40 per cent of all county taxable property voted district taxes.** 
Building warrants and bonds—For the purpose of providing moneys to 
erect, repair, enlarge, or equip school buildings or to make other improve- 
ments in school facilities, in a county which has levied, or is levying, a spe- 
cial county school tax the county is empowered to issue and sell anticipatory 
school warrants bearing interest at not more than 6 per cent per annum 
for an amount, including interest, not exceeding the income from state tax 
levy. In like manner for the same purposes and according to the same 
terms the board of education of any county or of any city of 2000 or more 
inhabitants, is empowered to issue school warrants to make improvements 
in the school facilities of any district under its control in which a district 
school tax has been, or is being levied. “The due date of said school war- 
rants shall not extend beyond the 30th day of September next after the 
time when the tax for the last year of said levy shall become delinquent.” 
All warrants constitute a preferred claim upon the proceeds of the state tax 
levy in such county or school district.** 
All municipal corporations are empowered to issue and sell bonds for 
the purpose of purchasing real estate necessary to any improvement or for 
the site of any building to be used for public purposes; for improvement, 
repair, enlargement of any building, for erecting public schoolhouses and 
buildings used in connection with the same.** In view of the fact that public 
schoolhouses and buildings are public buildings, it is scarcely necessary to call 
attention to the fact that all the provisions in the act just quoted would 
apply to issuing bonds for schoolhouses and grounds.

between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five who is not exempted by special

legal provision.** All persons permanently disabled whose taxable property 
does not exceed five hundred dollars are exempt from poll taxes.*® All poll 
taxes must be applied to the support of the public schools in the county in 
which they are collected.*?7 In 1917-18, $188,950 were derived from this 
source.*® 
Dog taxes——By the code of 1907, the proceeds of all dog taxes were 
directed to be applied to the support of the public schools in the county 
wherein collected, but in 1915 the law was so amended that henceforth the 
proceeds of dog taxes were divided between three classes of objects, namely: 
(1) indemnities for livestock injured or killed by dogs; (2) costs of medical 
treatment for indigents bitten by mad dogs; (3) schools. The provisions 
of the law of 1915 may be summarized as follows: The proceeds of dog 
taxes shall be used to indemnify deaths or injuries to livestock occasioned 
by dogs.*® The justice of the peace and appraisers appointed to appraise 
the killed and injured livestock shall be paid out of the fund fifty cents each 
for their services. Any surplus shall be used to pay the board and traveling 
expenses of any indigent persons who have to attend the Pasteur Institute 
in Montgomery for treatment for mad dog bite. Half of any surplus which 
remains after all of the above claims are allowed shall be deposited in the 
state treasury to the credit of the state. The remaining half shall be added 
to the county public school funds.*® In the year 1917-18, $131,000 was 
derived from bonuses and dog taxes.** 
Miscellaneous district fund—That the schools of Alabama are not yet 
free is shown by the appreciable portion of the revenues derived from the 
fees required of students and gifts of patrons. No better evidence could 
be given of the survival to a certain extent of the principles and conceptions 
animating educational effort in the days when free schools were regarded 
as charity schools. 
The fees levied now on students appear to be for supplies only, but the 
following paragraph from the annual report of the superintendent indicates 
that in times past they have been exacted for tuition as well. In 1915 
Superintendent Feagin wrote: 
A decision of the Supreme Court practically makes it impossible for any board of 
education to require more than a reasonable incidental fee as a condition precedent to 
admitting any pupil to the school. The decision of the court does not indicate the exact 
amount of such fee, which must depend upon the local conditions, but the implication is

that not more than twenty-five cents per month for each child would be justified. It is 
expressly stated that the fee cannot be required to pay any part of a teacher’s salary, 
but only for such necessities as fuel, crayon and the like.* 
Patrons and friends of a school may in Alabama, as in every other state, 
bestow upon it gifts. But that Alabama not only depends upon such gifts 
but exerts strong pressure to secure them is shown by the conditions which 
the laws attach to state aid granted for. rural school buildings and for public 
school libraries. In order to receive the quotas provided by law for the 
erection and equipment or repair and equipment of a school building, the 
community must present evidence that “bona fide donations of at least twice 
the amount for which aid is asked have already been secured.”°? In like 
manner in order to obtain the $10 quota of library aid, available to com- 
munities of not more than 1000 inhabitants, the patrons of the school must 
first raise and deposit with the county superintendent of schools a sum of 
not less than $10.°?

fees and patrons’ supplements in the years 1914, 1916, 1918, 1920, and 1922.

PRIVATE FounDATIONS 
Aid of immeasurable importance and far reaching effects is rendered to 
the public schools of Alabama by four private foundations or boards: the 
Anna T. Jeanes fund, the John F. Slater fund, the General Education Board, 
and the Rosenwald fund. In view of the fact that the aid and the policies 
of these foundations are state-wide, it might seem that the discussion of these 
funds should follow our account of state sources; but in view of the fact

that neither the state, the county, nor the district has any control over these 
funds it has seemed best to reserve them for consideration at this point. 
Anna T. Jeanes fund—Through the co-operation of the state, county 
boards of education, and the Anna T. Jeanes fund, twenty-four colored 
teachers were employed to supervise primary instruction in colored public 
schools, to organize industrial classes among pupils and supervise their in- 
struction in handicrafts and simple home industries, to form clubs for chil- 
dren and adults outside the schools for instruction in home-making, and to 
promote and supervise activities for general community improvement. Some 
of the most important features of the work done in connection with the 
Jeanes fund, and some conception of the results achieved during the year 
1922 can be gained from the following facts :**

Number of Jeanes teachers employed 
Number of schools supervised. . 
Number of homes visited 3 : 
Number of classes organized for special industrial work in 
the schools ean santa ek seiiiee eee + aces tiaras oa eee 1,220   
    The average term for which Jeanes’ teachers were employed was nine 
months, and the average salary $82 per month. Out of their meager salaries 
these teachers were required to defray their own traveling expenses. Of 
the total amount disbursed on salaries the Jeanes fund contributed $9360 
and the state and counties, $8449. 
John F. Slater fund.—From the Slater fund grants are made to provide 
equipment and pay the salaries of teachers in negro county industrial train- 
ing schools. In 1920, in fourteen counties of the state, through the co- 
operation of the Slater fund, the General Education Board, and county boards 
of education, county training schools were established for the training of 
colored teachers for rural school work.®® 
Rosenwald fund—The Julius Rosenwald fund grants subsidies for build- 
ing and equipping rural schoolhouses for negroes, “such equipment as desks, 
heating apparatus, libraries, and toilets being deemed of equal importance 
with schoolhouses themselves.” The amounts which may be appropriated 
from the fund “shall not exceed $500 for a one-teacher school, $800 for a 
two-teacher school, $1000 for a three-teacher school, $1200 for a four- 
teacher school, etc.” The fund is available for the building and furnishing 
of teachers’ homes, or “teacherages,”’ as they are commonly called. During 
the year 1920 the work of building Rosenwald schools was practically 
suspended for two reasons: \(1) the high cost of building material and 
labor; (2) and the suspension of an appropriation from the Julius Rosen- 
wald fund pending a report on the condition of the work throughout the 
% Alabama Department of Education Report, 1922, pp. 53-54.

South. In 1922 thirty-three schools were built and equipped with Rosen- 
wald and state aid at a total expenditure of $97,766. Of this amount 
$25,500 was furnished from the Rosenwald fund, $30,233 from state and 
county appropriations, $42,033 from local sources. 
Through the co-operation of the state with the Julius Rosenwald fund a 
combination teacher-training supervisor and Rosenwald building agent was 
employed whose duties included the supervising of county training schools 
and summer schools for colored teachers, holding institutes, and promoting 
the work of Rosenwald School building.** 
We have now completed our account of the sources from which Alabama 
derives her moneys for public schools. It seems desirable before leaving 
this portion of our study to bring together in tabular form the data thus 
far used in such a manner as to make comparison easy. In the first of the 
two tables which follow are shown all the sources from which Alabama 
public schools derive revenue. In the second table is presented an analysis 
of the total public school receipts for the year 1922.

CHAPTER V 
HOW SCHOOL MONEYS ARE APPORTIONED AND USED 
APPORTIONMENT OF SCHOOL Funps 
Not less important than the question of the sources a state provides 
for supplying moneys for her schools is the question: How and upon what 
conditions are these moneys distributed? The experience of not one but 
of many states has shown that public moneys may be disbursed in such a 
manner as to work a positive injury, as for instance, when they are so ap- 
portioned that the greatest amount of aid is given to the richest communi- 
ties, or when communities are aided in such a manner as to kill or deaden 
local initiative. On the other hand, state or local aid distributed in accord- 
ance with sound economic and political principles may be made to stimulate 
local effort and to strengthen not only the most needy communities but also 
the most needy features and projects of the system taken as a whole. The 
most important questions involved in the disbursement of school moneys 
are: (1) who apportions them; (2) upon what basis (school census, at- 
tendance, taxation, wealth, etc.) are they apportioned; (3) by what method 
“are they disbursed; (4) to what objects may they be lawfully applied; (5) 
what requirements must be met by the recipient administrative unit or indi- 
vidual school in order to receive the apportionment. 
Apportionment by state superintendent and county board.—Sixty-seven 
counties, subdivided into 1100 school districts,t are the units among which 
the school moneys of Alabama are annually apportioned. The direction and 
control of the public schools of each county, except those in incorporated 
cities of 2000 or more inhabitants, rest with an elective county board of 
education of five members.? This board appoints a county superintendent 
as its executive officer and a county treasurer of public school funds and 
provides not more than three trustees for each school. The state superin- 
tendent apportions the educational fund among the counties and among the 
districts entitled to income from the permanent funds held in trust by the 
state. The county boards apportion the moneys received from the state 
among the districts within the county. It follows that the general course 
followed by state moneys is from state treasury to county treasury and 
from county to district. 
The constitution provides that the public school fund shall be appor- 
tioned among the counties of the state in proportion to their school census 
+ General Public School Laws of Alabema, 1915, p. 166. In Alabama, as in other states, the 
movement toward consolidation results in a constantly changing number of districts. Therefore the 
number given at any time must be approximate.

(number of children 6 to 21 years)* and to the schools in the districts in 
the county in such a manner as to provide as nearly as practicable school 
terms of equal duration.® 
Apportionment by county boards—The basis upon which the educa- 
tional fund is to be distributed among the counties is thus definitely fixed 
by the constitution. But once in the hands of the county boards, its appor- 
tionment depends upon the judgment and will of the board, who are 
instructed to apportion it in such a manner as to provide as nearly as prac- 
ticable school terms of equal length throughout the county.* The section 
of the Code which provides for the mode of distributing the county school 
fund among the districts, leaves indefinite the basis and mode of apportion- 
ment to be followed by the county board of apportionment and makes the 
sums apportioned to the various districts depend entirely upon the will and 
judgment of these boards. 
Although school population is the basis upon which the major portion 
of the public school fund is apportioned among the counties, several other 
bases are used in distributing apportionments provided to foster specific 
purposes or features of the school system. The annual aid to county high 
schools is the same for all counties regardless of the school population. The 
basis upon which bonuses are granted to counties, levying a special county 
tax, is the rate of the school tax levied; the basis upon which aid is granted 
to rural communities for buildings or libraries is the total (as versus school) 
population. The amount of aid granted for every rural school building 
is determined by the size of the building, as follows:

For a three-room building 7 900 
For a four-room building..... =. |= 1200 
For a five-room (or more) building.......... Sisk: = eS OO! 
It is evident that neither the school population nor the county serves as 
a basis in the apportionment made to normal schools, teachers’ examinations, 
and institutes, nor in the quotas paid to sixteenth section fund or other trust 
fund school districts. 
Methods of apportionment.—In apportioning the educational fund, Ala- 
bama distinguishes between (a) moneys derived from appropriations to pay 
interest on trust funds held by the state but owned by local units such as 
4 Alabama School Code, 1922, p. 24, Art. V, sec. 16,

    112 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
townships, districts, or counties; (b) moneys derived from state sources 
of revenues, such as the proceeds of the state school three-mill tax, state 
appropriations other than those just noted under (a). Although the moneys 
derived from both classes of sources are placed together under the title of 
the “educational fund,” yet in apportioning this educational fund, the state 
distinctly recognizes that her obligation to trust fund districts is an obliga- 
tion distinct from all others and must be met before any general apportion- 
ment can be made. 
The most important steps involved in apportioning the educational fund 
may be summarized as follows: annually on October 1, or as soon thereafter 
as practicable, the state auditor certifies to the superintendent of education 
the amount of the educational fund available for the ensuing school year. 
In apportioning the educational fund to the counties, the superintendent 
of education is required by law first to set apart to the schools of each town- 
ship the amount due from the state thereto as interest on such township’s 
sixteenth section fund or other trust funds held by the state. To guard 
against such districts receiving a total apportionment larger than that re- 
ceived by the districts having no such trust funds, the law provides that all 
townships or school districts having an income from a trust fund held by 
the state or from the lease or sale of sixteenth section lands shall not re- 
ceive anything out of the balance of the educational fund to be apportioned 
until all other townships or school townships or school districts having no 
such trust funds shall have received from the general fund such an amount 
as will give them an equal per capita apportionment with townships or dis- 
tricts having such incomes.’ After the above quotas have been set aside, 
the superintendent of education apportions the remainder of the fund among 
the sixty-seven counties of the state in proportion to their school census, 
ie., the number of children 6 to 21 years of age.® 
Uses oF State Arp 
It needs no long consideration to show the importance of the degree of 
latitude allowed school units as to the objects to which they may apply 
moneys received from the state. Too great liberty may result in dissipation 
of revenues. On the other hand, to limit by law expenditures to one or two 
objects may prevent the granting of aid to features upon the support of 
which the effectiveness of the schools depends quite as much as upon those 
specified in the law or constitution. 
Forbidden uses—The constitution of Alabama provides that “‘no moneys 
raised for the support of the public schools shall be appropriated to or used 
for the support of any sectarian or denominational schools.° The Code 
provides that “no school moneys distributed to the various counties from

the state school revenue shall, either directly or indirectly, be paid for the 
erection of schoolhouses, for the use of school furniture, or for any other 
contingent expenses of school.” Our account of the sources from which 
the educational fund is derived shows that the present law provides special, — 
appropriations to be used in aiding rural districts in the erection of school * 
buildings and also that aid amounting to $3000 annually is provided for each 
county high school. In both cases it will be seen that the special appropria- 
tion renders aid to the objects forbidden in the above general law. More- 
over, the law provides no penalty for using the school moneys distributed 
to the various counties from state school revenues for the forbidden objects, 
and it has been impossible at the present writing to ascertain to what extent 
this general provision is effective. 
The following table shows the objects to which public school moneys 
may be lawfully applied in Alabama, together with the amount appropriated 
or expended in the year 1914-15. Where two amounts are given, the one 
in parentheses indicates the sum reserved or appropriated by law, the other 
sum indicates the amount actually expended as shown by the report of the 
state treasurer for the year 1915. 
Lawful uses: teachers’ wages—The constitution of Alabama provides that 
ninety-six per cent of all the moneys raised or appropriated for the support 
of the public schools must be expended for the payment of teachers’ wages, 
provided, that the legislature may, by a two-thirds vote of each house, sus- 
pend the operation of this provision. 
Miscellaneous —The constitutional limitation just referred to has necessi- 
tated the providing of a number of special appropriations to foster projects 
other than the payment of teachers’ salaries. A reference to Table XVI 
will show both the amount and the source of these special appropriations. 
The law provides that there shall be appropriated annually out of moneys 
in the treasury, not otherwise appropriated, a sum sufficient to provide 
annually $3000 to every county high school meeting certain specified require- 
ments ;1? $100 per county (in all $6700) to aid rural communities in estab- 
lishing or maintaining public school libraries ;7* $134,000, ie., $2000 per 
county, for aiding rural districts in the erection, repair, and equipment of 
schoolhouses.** The law further provides an annual contingent fund for 
the state department.®

¥ The amount $201,000 is a theoretical amount based on the assumption that every one of the 
67 counties supports a high school eligible to state aid. In 1915 there were reported 53 county high 
schools (see Alabama Department of Education Report, 1915, pp. 70-77) if each of these had received 
the full amount of state aid the total appropriation for county high schools would have been $159,000, 
Requirements for participation—Up to the present time, Alabama does 
not appear to have found it feasible to attempt to impose any requirements 
whatever upon the counties, townships, or districts, as a condition of re- 
ceiving their respective quotas of public moneys. The sixteenth section fund 
and other permanent funds, held in trust by the state for the districts and 
other constituent units, are regarded distinctly as the property of these units 
and consequently such districts are not expected to permit the state to im- 
pose upon them any requirements conditioning their receiving the interest 
due them. This policy of no requirements for participation in the public 
school revenues extends to all forms of state aid. It appears in the total 
absence of penalties to be laid upon units which fail to fulfill the school laws. 
It reaches its climax in the provision of the law which requires the state 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  116 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
superintendent to grant to counties which do not report to him their school 
census, an appropriation from the educational fund “according to the best 
information he can obtain.”2° 
The only state aid which is conditioned upon the local units’ fulfilling 
definite requirements is that given in the form of special state appropria- 
tions. Here, as pointed out in previous paragraphs, there are a number of 
instances in which counties or districts in order to receive special aid must 
fulfill certain conditions. Thus, counties wishing to receive bonuses must 
levy a local tax of one, two, or three mills in order to receive respectively 
the state bonuses of $1000, $2000, or $3000.17 Rural schools desiring aid 
in the erection, repair, and equipment of buildings must show that “bona 
fide donations of at least twice the amount for which aid is asked have al- 
ready been secured,”*® and a deed in fee simple of not less than two acres 
of land for a building with fewer than three rooms and to five acres for a 
building with three or more classrooms.’® 
In order to secure the quota of rural school library aid “the patrons or 
friends of any district shall first raise a sum of not less than $10 and de- 
posit the said amount with the county superintendent of education.’?°

Growth in school costs—In 1900 Alabama spent approximately $923,000 
for public schools; in 1920, $9,118,000, an increase of 887 per cent. In 
1g00 her expenditure per pupil in average daily attendance was $3.10; in 
1920, $24.81, an increase of approximately 700 per cent. These facts are 
set forth together with data for the year 1910 in the immediately following

Large and impressive as the increases revealed in Table XVII are, they 
do not answer the question to what extent has expenditure been adequate. 
An answer to this question may be sought by one of two methods, either by 
comparing Alabama’s expenditure for public schools with that of other 
states, or by attempting definitely to ascertain to what extent she is actually 
getting her children into school, how much schooling, and what sort of in- 
struction she is providing. 
At the present writing the most recent year for which data for the United 
States as a whole are available is 1920. In that year the average expendi- 
ture per child enrolled in the United States was $48.02, in Alabama $16.1 
The United States as a whole had invested in school property $112 per child

enrolled, Alabama’s investment was $33.2. The average annual salary of all 
teachers in the United States was $871, the average annual salary of teach- 
ers in Alabama was $484. Taking the United States as a whole, the aver- 
age length of school year was 8.1 months, in Alabama 6.1 months.t In 
1920 Alabama ranked among the 48 states in the Union, forty-second as to 
teachers’ average annual salary, forty-fourth as to expenditure per child 
enrolled, forty-fifth as to length of school year, and forty-sixth as to the 
value of school property per child enrolled.’ It is estimated that between 
1920 and 1922 school costs in the United States increased approximately 
46 per cent. Yet in 1922 Alabama’s annual expenditure per child enrolled 
in rural white schools was approximately $18 ($17.95) and in colored rural 
schools approximately $4 ($4.29).7 
We have now compared Alabama’s expenditure for public schools with 
the United States as a whole and have found it sufficiently below that of the 
average to warrant the conclusion that it is totally inadequate. Let us now 
ask, to what extent she is getting her children into schools and how much 
schooling she is providing. 
In 1920 only 65 per cent of the population in Alabama 5 to 18 years of 
age were attending school. Not only is it true that Alabama is failing to 
provide any education at all for nearly one third of her children, but the 
educational opportunities furnished for those who attend school are omi- 
nously inadequate and unequal. 
We have seen that in 1920 the average length of school year in the 
United States was approximately 8 months, while that of Alabama was 6 
months. Table XVIII compares the length of the average school year in 
rural and city schools, also the length of school year in elementary and in 
high schools, and in white and colored schools. 
From Table XVIII we see that the length of school year in all types 
of city schools was considerably in excess of 8 months, and in a number 
of cases approached very closely to 9 months. The longest school years 
were maintained by county high schools and state secondary agricultural 
schools. But when we turn our attention to the rural situation we find an 
entirely different condition. Here the school year for elementary schools 
varied from 6.3 months in white schools to 4.75 months in colored schools 
and in high schools from 7.15 months in white schools to 6.10 months in 
colored schools. Recalling that over 78 per cent of the total population of

Alabama lives in rural communities,® we readily see that these short school 
years represent the amount of schooling that is being offered to more than 
three fourths of the school children in Alabama. Let us bear in mind the 
large number of communities whose school year falls far below the aver- 
age and the many others who maintain no school at all. Inadequacy and 
inequality are the two outstanding characteristics of the educational oppor- 
tunities in Alabama when viewed from the standpoint of the length of school 
term provided.

Alabama has accepted the principle that it is the duty of the state to 
equalize, as far as possible, educational opportunities. Her acceptance of 
this principle is strikingly evident in the following educational provisions: 
(2) the provision that state moneys apportioned to counties shall be dis- 
tributed among the districts in a manner to provide, as far as practicable, 
a school year of uniform length ;?° (2) in the latitude allowed county boards 
in the matter of distributing school moneys; (3) in the provision that dis- 
tricts owning trust funds held by the state, after receiving the interest due 
them from the state, shall receive no further grants from the educational 
fund until “all other townships or school districts, having no trust fund, 
shall have received from the general fund such amount as will give them 
an equal per capita apportionment with the townships or districts” having 
trust funds held by the state.1* It has long been conceded not only by states- 
men and scientific students of government, but by the people at large that

the stability, welfare, and progress of states wherein the government rests 
with the people must be based upon a system of universal education. That 
educational opportunities in Alabama are not universal, are not free, and are 
not equal is only too evident from even a casual study of the situation. Let 
us now turn to a more definite consideration of these facts.

of teachers, supervisors, and supervising principals, for textbooks, supplies, and other expenses of

Inequalities in expenditure per child——In 1922 the expenditure per school 
child for elementary instruction in white schools varied in Alabama all the 
way from $36 to $7.51 per year, with a median expenditure of approxi- 
mately $14 ($13.90). In only eight counties did the expenditure exceed 
$30 per year; in seventeen it ranked between $15 and $30; in twenty-nine, 
between $10 and $15; and in thirteen, it was less than $10 per year. These 
facts are set forth in Table XIX. 
This table has shown two outstanding facts: (1) the exceedingly low 
expenditure per child and (2) the wide variation in this expenditure among 
Alabama’s sixty-seven coutities in one class of schools only, namely, elemen- 
tary white schools. Table XX, which follows, shows what great inequalities 
are discovered when we compare elementary schools with high schools, rural 
schools with urban, white with colored.

From Table XX we see that, in 1922, whereas the average annual ex- 
penditure for current expenses per pupil enrolled in white elementary schools 
was $30 in the cities of the state, in rural communities it was approximately 
only $16. Again, expenditure per pupil enrolled in white high schools in 
cities was approximately $58, but only $50 in rural high schools. Expendi- 
ture per pupil in colored elementary rural schools was only $4.17 per year 
and in city elementary colored schools only $11 per pupil per year. Those 
familiar with school costs in 1922 know the utter impossibility of securing 
anything worthy the name of education at a rate of either $16 or $4 per year. 
Inequalities in teachers’ salaries——There is probably no better index of 
the character of the educational opportunity being offered to the children in 
any community than the type of teacher employed. The saying “as is the 
teacher, so is the school” is as true as it is old. Admitting certain excep- 
tions, we may, nevertheless, assert that in general the training and the effi- 
ciency of teachers employed will be directly proportional to the salary paid.
-P-A-G-E-140
  122 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
If wide variations are found with respect to salaries paid, we may expect 
wide variations in the qualifications and efficiency of the teachers employed. 
In Alabama in 1920 eighty per cent of the teachers were women.* For this 
reason we will gain a most accurate conception of what Alabama is paying 
on the average to school teachers if we confine our attention to the salaries 
paid to women.

From Table XXI we see that in 1922 the average salary of all white 
teachers in rural elementary schools of Alabama was $487 and in colored 
schools $227. The impossibility of securing professionally trained and ef- 
ficient workmen for any type of activity for such a wage is too obvious to 
call for comment. It is unnecessary to seek further data to justify the state- 
ment that the rural schools of Alabama are taught by illy prepared and in- 
competent teachers. The situation is somewhat better in the city schools 
and in high schools, but even here, with the exception of city high schools 
and state and county secondary schools, the salaries are too low to secure 
competent service. 
Inequalities in teacher preparation—Alabama issues five types of teach- 
ers’ certificates ; professional, life, first, second, and third grade certificates. 
These certificates represent differences in type and degree of professional 
preparation. Table XXII shows how unequal is professional preparation 
among Alabama teachers, and the fact that the child attending school in the 
city secures a far better prepared teacher than the child attending school in 
the country is clearly revealed by Table XXII, which follows:

From Table XXII we see that 13.3 per cent of the teachers employed 
in rural schools hold either a professional or life certificate, whereas, 38.8 
per cent of those employed in city schools hold certificates of these types. 
In other words, if a child attends a city school in Alabama the chances are 
more than 38 out of 100 that he will be taught by a teacher having the 
preparation necessary to secure one of the two highest types of certificates 
issued by the state, but if a child attends a rural school the chances are 
only 13 out of 100 that he will secure such a teacher. On the other hand, 
if a child attends a city school the chances are only approximately 25 out 
of 100 that he will be taught by a teacher holding one of the two lowest 
grades of certificates issued by the state and less than 3 out of 100 that he 
will be taught by a teacher holding the lowest of all grades of certificates; 
namely, the third. On the other hand, if he attends a rural school the 
chances are nearly 24 out of 100 that he will be taught by a teacher who 
holds a third grade certificate, 45 out of 100 that he will be taught by a 
teacher holding a second grade certificate, and approximately 68 out of 100 
that the teacher who instructs him will hold one of the two lowest types 
of certificates issued by the state. 
It is unnecessary to carry further our consideration of the educational 
situation in Alabama or the outcome of her present system of school finance. 
It makes little difference to what particular aspect we turn our attention, 
taking the state as a whole the characteristics are the same, inadequacy and 
inequality. These conditions can never be overcome until Alabama radically 
modifies her policies and her efforts. The changes most needed are: (1) 
adequate school funds, (2) reforms in the bases and methods of appor- 
tioning moneys provided by the state, (3) a truly democratic conception of 
the educational responsibility of the state.  
-P-A-G-E-142
    
124 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
During our recent war, experts informed us as accurately as possible 
the amount of money it would be necessary to raise in order to carry through 
essential projects. This done, the government turned to the people who 
forthwith raised the required sums. In establishing a system of school sup- 
port, the first question should be: How much money is needed? This ques- 
tion should be determined by educational and financial experts and upon 
the basis of their answer the state and the local communities should be com- 
pelled to raise the requisite amount. The policy followed at present in Ala- 
bama and elsewhere is a direct violation of this principle and an unconscious 
outgrowth of the charity conception of public education. Instead of deter- 
mining in advance by scientific methods the amount per child needed, Ala- 
bama provides certain sources of school revenues, collects such revenues as 
these sources furnish, and divides that money among the schools, saying: 
“This year you have so much money to spend. With this your schools must 
be maintained.” It would be difficult to imagine a more unscientific or 
senseless method of attempting to provide for schools. 
Alabama has long since appreciated the inadequacy of the funds being 
provided for public schools. Attention has already been called to the steps 
taken in 1901, in 1916, and in subsequent years to inaugurate the policy of 
local support. It is unfortunate that Alabama did not see her way clear 
to avoid the inauguration of such a policy. After maintaining what was 
essentially a state system for many generations she is now attempting to 
launch out upon a policy of district support. The author of the present 
account has called attention, in many studies and monographs," to the evils 
of the district system of school support. No system of school support so 
inevitably destined to create and perpetuate inequalities has yet been devised. 
A statement of the evils of the district system will be found in the present 
volume in the chapters dealing with Arkansas and Oklahoma and conse- 
quently need not be presented here. Suffice it to say that no type of local 
unit whether it be the county, the township, or the district can ever equalize 
school revenue and the educational opportunities supported by such revenue. 
The state, and only the state, can do this. It is possible that indifference to 
public education has been so widespread in Alabama that it has seemed neces- 
sary to the educational leaders of this state to begin by developing enthusiasm 
through the smaller local units. But however much progress Alabama may 
make through following such a policy, she will sooner or later be brought 
face to face with the futility of attempting to solve her financial problem by 
any other means than state support. A growing realization of the truth of 
this statement on the part of a number of our leading states has been pointed 
out by the writer in a recent monograph.” It is to be regretted that instead

of following the policies of the states in the north and west, Alabama did 
not adopt a program such as that which has recently been put into effect 
by Delaware which places practically the entire burden of school support 
upon the state. 
Assuming that Alabama will continue, for the present at least, along the 
lines she has already laid down, let us ask what are some of the most im- 
portant reforms which should be made. The first of these reforms has 
already been implied; namely, the provision of some means of determining 
in advance how much money will be required from year to year to maintain 
an adequate system of schools, and then of providing means by which funds 
necessary to maintain such a system will be furnished. 
Establish a productive permanent fund—One of the most obvious steps 
in this direction of providing adequate revenues would be the creation of a 
genuinely productive state common school fund. Such funds in Alabama, 
as already shown, have no existence except on the books of the state. Massa- 
chusetts and Vermont are illustrious examples of states which after years 
of vain endeavor to establish an effective system of schools without a large 
permanent fund owned and controlled by the state, finally realized the im- 
possibility of doing this and created such funds.** 
Moreover, Alabama’s sixteenth section funds and the income of the same 
are regarded as belonging to the townships and districts although managed 
by the state. 
Florida and Tennessee, which originally regarded their sixteenth section 
funds as belonging to the townships, later merged them into one state owned 
and controlled fund.’7 Alabama’s present policy of using the proceeds of 
sales of school lands for the general purposes of the state, and simply adding 
to her school account the sum so expended, should be discontinued at once. 
Not only should such proceeds be invested in productive securities, but the 
moneys heretofore used, as well as all school moneys diverted or lost, should 
be restored and similarly invested. 
Today the State has clear title to only about 135,000 acres of school land; 118,000 
of this being sixteenth sections, and most of the rest, indemnity land. 
Much of the 16,000 acres of indemnity land now owned by the State, is valuable 
coal lands. Some small areas of marketable timber have also been spared to the State. 
In addition, rentals of considerable consequence could be collected from school lands 
now under cultivation, but of which no record is being kept. 
While much has been lost, it is not yet too late for the State to discharge the 
trust imposed in it, in relation to the land funds. The $2,300,000 now in the paper 
fund, and the surplus revenue fund (1836) amounting to $670,000, also changed into 
interest-bearing notes, if converted into productive funds, together with the incomes 
36 Massachusetts established a permanent common school fund in 1834 and Vermont a perma- 
nent public school fund in 1904. See F. H. Swift, A History of Public Permanent Common School 
Funds in the United States, pp. 300-302, 412-13.

  126 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT 
from sales, rents, and royalties on the lands still intact, could, in time, produce for the 
schools of the State an endowment of considerable importance.” 
State school tax—Important as the creation of a productive permanent 
common school fund is, the entire history of school finance in Alabama as 
well as in the United States as a whole shows that the income of such funds 
can never keep pace with the increases in school population and school costs. 
The most satisfactory method of insuring such a state fund is to provide 
for the levying of a state school tax. This Alabama has already done, but 
the defect in her policy is that instead of making the rate of tax depend 
upon the amount of money which she has determined is necessary for the 
adequate support of schools, she levies a fixed tax. Contrast with the Ala- 
bama policy the policies of Arizona, Utah, California, and Washington which 
guarantee from state funds a fixed and relatively generous amount for each 
school child. In place of a school tax of fixed rate, Alabama should provide 
for the levying from year to year of a tax the rate of which shall be deter- 
mined upon the amount of money required adequately to support schools. 
Alabama, together with many other states, suffers from a faulty system 
of assessment. The constitution indicates clearly that a three-mill school 
tax is to be levied upon full valuation, nevertheless, the state law provides 
that the school tax shall be levied upon a 60 per cent valuation. Despite the 
fact that this method of basing assessment upon 60 per cent of total valua- 
tion has been declared constitutional, the soundness of the economic prin- 
ciple upon which this method is based is dubious. Moreover, the schools 
are annually cheated out of vast sums, owing to the fact that the valuation 
actually employed is far below even this 60 per cent as the following table 
shows:

  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN ALABAMA 127 
The recent federal commission noted in its report published in 1919, a 
few of the many flagrant abuses of the tax law in relation to assessment of 
values in the following words: 
The survey commission’s attention has been called to many instances of flagrant 
abuse of the tax law, chiefly in relation to assessment of values. Coal and iron lands 
that are bonded for millions of dollars are known to have been assessed as agricul- 
tural lands at the paltry valuation of a few thousand dollars. Farms that were re- 
cently sold at a good price are listed on the tax books at less than one-tenth of this 
value. Such cases, unfortunately are not isolated instances of a vicious practice, but 
are part of a common system. It is accordingly recommended that a scientific study 
of the whole field of taxation be made by experts who shall propose to the state an 
equable basis for listing and assessing property and apportioning the tax burden among 
all its citizens.” 
In order to remedy these evils the commission suggests : 
To this end, it would be necessary to reorganize the present agencies intrusted 
with the important task of property assessment. This would be made primarily a state 
function, under immediate direction of the governor of the state. Local property as- 
sessment should be directed by state assessors, and no local assessor should be an 
inhabitant of the county or community to be assessed by him. Suitable penalties should 
be provided to insure strict compliance with the law. Such tax commissions have al- 
ready demonstrated in many states that it is possible to enforce a fair and equable 
system of taxation on rich and poor alike, instead of the unfair and undemocratic 
system now utilized in Alabama.” 
Remove limits on county and district taxes —If Alabama is to adhere to 
her policy of local support she should abandon her practice of placing a limit 
upon county and district tax rates. In the place of an optional county school 
tax of one to three mills, there should be established a compulsory county 
tax of a minimum rate of not less than five mills and no maximum shoyld 
be stated. In like manner all limits should be removed from district taxation. 
Requirements for participation—Once the state comes to possess and 
control a sufficient educational fund to enable it to offer really significant 
quotas to counties and districts, it will not be difficult to establish and put 
into effect increasingly higher educational standards. The total absence of 
requirements, already referred to, is a startling index to the looseness of 
organization, the lack of state control, and the impossibility of anything more 
than halting progress. A supreme educational officer or board should further- 
more be empowered, independent of political or legislative influence, to 
establish definite and significant requirements to be met by school units in 
order to receive a share of public moneys, to change such requirements from 
year to year, and to place penalties upon such communities as fail to fulfill 
these conditions.

    128 FLETCHER HARPER SWIFT , 
Lawful objects—The objects to which school moneys may be lawfully 
applied should be more clearly defined. Here as elsewhere, the state supreme 
educational authority should be empowered without being obliged to wait 
for specific legislative action, to change from year to year, as needs (not 
legal provisions) dictate, both the objects to which school moneys may be 
lawfully applied, or the proportion of total grant available for such objects. 
There should be no constitutional provision that 96 per cent of all moneys 
raised or appropriated should be devoted to teachers’ wages, but rather the 
constitution or the laws should empower the state educational authorities to 
determine what should be the minimum salaries of teachers holding different 
grades of certificates and the quota of every such teacher’s salary to be 
provided out of state moneys. 
Basis of apportionment—Assuming all the above changes to have been 
made, there still will be little hope of an effective system of school support 
in Alabama until her present method and basis of apportionment of school 
moneys are abolished. The basis of apportionment at present employed, 
that of school population, is one of the most ineffective, antiquated, unjust, 
and disastrous to be found in the United States today. The evils resulting 
from apportioning state aid on the school population basis might be illustrated 
from the experience of many states. That of Minnesota will, however, fur- 
nish a sufficiently convincing argument of how early these evils were evident. 
Minnesota’s story is succintly told in two paragraphs of Superintendent 
Burt’s report for the year 1876: 
The old plan (based on school population) gave an unfair advantage to districts 
in which there happened to be parochial schools maintained at private expense. In 
a (certain) district..........:. a settlement of Norwegians has maintained a private 
school so that the enrollment in the public school has never exceeded twenty, while the 
district has drawn money on seventy-eight persons, fifty-eight of whom have not in 
the least increased the expense of the public school.* 
Thriving centers of business attract.......... large numbers of persons between five 
and twenty-one who go thither to work and not to go to school. Upon the old plan 
(school census basis) out of three districts in a certain county, one educated eight 
hundred six scholars, on each of which it received in one year from the state fund 
$2.05; another educated five hundred twenty, on each of which it received $1.33; the 
third educated one hundred seventy-four, receiving only $1.25 to each scholar. This 
plan of distribution afforded no inducement to open public schools no matter how 
many children were receiving no education.” 
One district, by opening a school for two persons for three months, drew 
public money on the entire school population.”? 
The evil results of the school population basis have been unduly aggra- 
vated in Alabama, owing to the fact that the laws leave county boards free 
to distribute public school moneys according to their own will. That Ala-

bama’s schools have escaped no possible evil of this, one of the most per- 
nicious known methods of distributing school moneys, is manifestly clear from 
the findings of the recent federal commission which are here presented in 
condensed form.?* 
It has failed to provide terms of equal duration in the several counties and dis- 
tricts, for either white or colored children. It has made it possible for county boards 
of education in the black-belt counties to utilize these funds locally in such a manner 
as to make county and district taxation unnecessary, thereby to all practical purposes, 
obliging (a) the white population in other counties to maintain the white schools in 
the black-belt counties, while (b) the colored schools in the same counties were being 
discriminated against in a most flagrant manner. The present system of ap- 
portioning the state funds has failed to provide terms of equal duration in the several 
counties and districts; chiefly because the State surrenders control of the funds the 
moment they are turned over to the county boards of education. Barbour, Bullock, 
Dallas, Lowndes, and Sumter Counties have not yet voted the new three-mill county 
tax, and Cleburne and Tallapoosa get along with the one-mill county tax.. 
Every one of these counties expends less than $5 per capita on its school Fant ian, 
Still most of them rank quite high in the length of term and expenditure on the en- 
rollment basis. How can this be? It is useless to hide the truth.......... The State 
funds—apportioned (to the counties) on the basis of the whole white and colored 
population—are re-apportioned (to the districts) so that the comparatively small white 
school population gets an unusually large proportion of the fund, and the comparatively 
large colored school population gets an unusually small share of the fund.. 
In these counties the colored population is almost wholly deprived of public ene 
support, being obliged to depend largely on private subscriptions and donations. The 
thinking people of Alabama are opposed to these local practices. They should no 
longer be tolerated. 
This method of distribution also works a flagrant discrimination against the white 
school population of the State at large. These seven counties actually maintain their 
schools for the greater part at the expense of other Alabamians, since their only tax 
is a small State levy........ In 1916 the Alabama State department of education 
made a comparative study of the 67 counties in the state......... In this classification, 
Bullock and Dallas Counties received, respectively, first and second place; Sumter was 
number five, and Lowndes was number seven, and, be it remembered, these were the 
counties that were depending on the bounties from the State at large for their rank- 
IG terenste alas But the present system or lack of system followed in dividing the State 
and county taxes between county and city schools, is not satisfactory and should be 
remedied by law. The county boards of education may now use their own discretion 
as to how the funds shall be divided......... In some counties the funds have been 
divided (between county and city schools) on the half-and-half plan, which clearly 
gives the large city more than its share. In other places, there have been gentlemen’s 
agreements of the boards that the division shall be on the basis of school popula- 
HOM. <i> 5-422 Finally, in some places,........ the present practice tends to discourage 
the people from voting local district taxes. There are many instances on record to 
show that the county boards have actually penalized progressive communities by re- 
ducing their quota of county taxes immediately upon having voted a local tax to sup- 
plement this county portion.

Principles underlying a sound basis of apportionment—The experience 
of our states has made clear the principles in accordance with which a sound 
basis of apportionment must be formulated. The method and basis of ap- 
portionment must be such as to favor the poorer and more helpless school 
units of the state over against the richer and more capable. It must provide 
that the amount. of state aid granted to any district shall take into considera- 
tion the following factors at least, the valuation of the district, the rate of 
local tax levied, the number and grade (as indicated by the grade of certificate 
or type of professional training) of teachers employed, the actual school at- 
tendance, and the length of school term. It should be conditioned first of 
all upon furnishing regularly the reports required by the state department, 
and in the second place by fulfilling all the educational laws and requirements 
established by the state or the educational authorities to which it has dele- 
gated its powers. 
It may be objected that the reforms demanded in the above paragraphs, 
are so radical as to be entirely outside the range of all possibility. The reply 
is that most of them have already been incorporated in the system of school 
support'of one or more of our progressive states. Others are the conclu- 
sions of men who have carefully considered the problem, and have formu- 
lated their recommendations after long and arduous study of the situation.** 
The reforms proposed in the immediately preceding paragraphs repre- 
sent only a few of those needed to establish efficiency and justice in Alabama’s 
system of school support. To present those remaining would only be to 
repeat recommendations already set forth by the author in other chapters 
of the present volume and in various other publications. For a more com- 
plete treatment of needed reforms in policies of financing our public schools, 
reforms many of which apply with as much force to Alabama as to the 
states for which they have been definitely prescribed, the interested reader 
is referred to the author’s studies on Arkansas and Oklahoma in the present 
volume, and his studies on California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Illinois, and 
Minnesota in other volumes of the present series, and to his two recent 
monographs issued by the United States Bureau of Education, State Policies 
in Public School Finance, and A Biennial Survey of Public School Finance 
in the United States, 1920-22.

scientific modes of apportionment. For an account of their methods of apportionment, see the

CHAPTER VII 
INTRODUCTION 
THE PrRoBLEM AND THE PRESENT SITUATION 
Undoubtedly two of the outstanding problems in school finance today 
are the problems of the sources and the'distribution of school revenue. The 
money which is used to support the schools of the United States is raised 
by almost as many methods as there are states'in the Union. Laws govern- 
ing the raising and apportionment of funds have been made to satisfy ex- 
isting needs with little knowledge of, and little regard ‘for, educational needs 
and sound principles of public finance. State funds have been distributed 
in an equally haphazard manner without regard either to the ability or to 
the effort of individual districts to support their own schools. : 
Within recent years a number of researches and studies have been com- 
pleted on the subjects of permanent school endowments and state aid; 
while several more extended studies of the whole system of school support 
of various states have been published. These various investigations have 
uniformly shown great variations in educational opportunities and likewise 
wide variations in the burdens of school support. 
The present study will attempt to present a survey of the problem of 
school support in the state of Tennessee. More specifically, the problems 
are to show: (1) from what sources Tennessee secures her revenues for her 
public schools, including both elementary and high schools; (2) how these 
revenues are apportioned and used; (3) the results of the present system 
of support, particularly as shown by the inequalities in opportunities and 
burdens of support; (4) conclusions and recommendations. 
This account is based largely upon the state laws and official federal 
and state reports. The comparative data for all states is taken from the 
United States Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1922, No. 29, Statistics of 
State School Systems, 1919-20. The most recent educational and financial 
reports available at the present writing are: (1) the report of the state 
superintendent of public instruction for the year ending June 30, 1922; 
(2) the Public School Laws compiled in 1923; (3) the Biennial Report of 
the Comptroller of the Treasury for the biennium ending June 30, 1922; 
(4) the Biennial Report of the State Treasurer for the years 1920-22. The 
report of the state tax commissioner for the year 1921-22 was used to secure 
the valuations by counties and for checking taxation data from the other 
reports. The 1920 census and 1922 bulletins of the Bureau of Education 
are also the latest publications available at this writing for comparative pur- 
poses. It is apparent from the above, that no data later than 1922 could 
be used for the study of educational and financial conditions within the state.

A significant handicap to any study of education in Tennessee should be 
mentioned at the outset: the impossibility of giving separate statistical treat- 
ment to white and negro schools, because in state reports such data are not 
separated. Again data are reported only by counties and not by districts. 
EDUCATIONAL SITUATION IN TENNESSEE 
Before considering the particular problem of this study, it will be worth 
while briefly to consider Tennessee’s general educational problem, her ability 
and effort as compared with other states to meet these obligations, and the 
results of her efforts. Table I shows for the year 1920: 
1. The conditions with which the school system has to deal 
2. The financial support given to the schools of the state 
3. The result of the interaction of 1 and 2 as shown in enrollment, attendance, 
length of school year, and average teacher’s salary.

  136 JOHN HAROLD GOLDTHORPE 
Table I shows that the state ranks sixteenth in the density of population 
and twelfth in the percentage of rural population, among the forty-eight 
states of the Union. This renders Tennessee’s educational problem predomi- 
nantly a rural one; in fact, almost three-fourths of the urban population 
of the state is in the four cities of Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis, and 
Nashville. 
The state has a negligible foreign born element, but nearly one fifth of 
its total population is negro. The number of adult illiterates (ten years of 
age and over) is relatively high, being 10.3 per cent of the total population. 
Only nine states in the Union rank lower in literacy. The close relation 
between the large negro element and illiteracy is evident from the ‘fact 
that only 7.3 per cent of the adult native white population is illiterate and 
8.3 per cent of the foreign born white adult population is illiterate, whereas, 
22.4 per cent of the adult negro population is illiterate1 How widely con- 
ditions vary, both with respect to the distribution of the negro population 
and with respect to illiteracy, is shown by the following facts: in fourteen 
counties less than 2 per cent of the population is negro, and in four of these 
twelve counties, namely, Pickett, Scott, Unicoi, and Union, not more than 
one tenth of 1 per cent (.oor) is negro. That the problem of illiteracy, 
although overwhelmingly a negro problem, is by no means solely such, is 
revealed by the fact that in the number of so-called white counties, the 
percentage of adult illiteracy is as great as in counties containing a large 
element of negro population, as will be seen by the following brief tabular 
statement :

  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE 137 .* 
Although Tennessee enrolls 87 per cent of children of school age, and 
in this respect ranks twelfth in the Union, yet when we come to the question 
of how many children from day to day are to be found in the schools we 
find an entirely different situation. For here we find that practically 26 
children out of every 100 enrolled are not to be found in the school on any 
particular school day, as is shown by item 23 of Table I, and in this respect 
Tennessee ranks twenty-sixth. 
Measured in ability to support education, the state ranks thirty-first, but 
in true valuation of taxable property per child enrolled the state ranks forty- 
sixth, being in advance only of North Carolina and Mississippi. This would 
also seem to indicate that Tennessee is carrying a relatively heavier burden 
than most states. In 1921 the state had a net per capita debt of $7.01, and 
ranked seventeenth among the thirty states for which the Bureau of Census 
could secure data, and nineteenth in respect to the ratio of the net state debt 
to assessed valuation. 
In 1920 Tennessee spent $10,141,374 for all public school expenditures, 
ranking twenty-ninth, but, upon the per child enrolled basis, she ranked 
but forty-fourth. At the same time, the state was spending $3.88 per $1000 
of taxable wealth, giving the state a rank of twenty-eighth in this respect. 
In value of school property per child enrolled Tennessee showed an outlay 
of $35.00 and ranked forty-fourth. 
The results as shown by Table I are far from satisfactory, even when 
considered in the light of Tennessee’s position as to relative ability to support 
education. While ranking twelfth in per cent of children enrolled, the state 
holds twenty-sixth position in respect to the number who are in average daily 
attendance. Also, while the average term provided is 133.5 days, the num- 
ber of days attended per child enrolled is but 98.5. These facts would tend 
to show that Tennessee’s compulsory attendance law is failing to secure 
its avowed purpose. The teacher’s average salary for 1920 was $494, and 
only four states of the Union paid a lower average salary. 
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
By the Reorganization Law passed by the 1923 General Assembly, the 
state administrative departments were reorganized and redistributed. As 
a result of this step a department of education with a commissioner as its 
chief executive officer was established. The new department took over 
the duties and powers formerly vested in the state library commission, the 
Tennessee Historical Committee, the free library commission, the land 
commissioner, and the state geological commission. An additional branch, 
that of the Division of Professional Registration, was organized, which 
consolidated the functions and administration of thirteen various profes- 
sional examining boards and commissions.? Since the present account is 
* Public School Laws of Tennessee, 1923, pp. 3-4.
-P-A-G-E-156
    
138 JOHN HAROLD GOLDTHORPE 
primarily concerned with the problem of public school finance, the divisions 
other than those related to education will not be considered. To care for 
the educational interests proper, the division of high school supervision, 
the division of elementary school supervision, and the department of certifica- 
tion were created.? 
The chief school official of the state and executive officer of the De- 
partment of Education is the commissioner of education, who “shall be a 
person of literary and scientific attainments, and of skill and experience in 
the art of teaching.” The commissioner is appointed by the governor and 
“holds office at his pleasure or till his successor shall be appointed and 
qualified.” 
The commissioner of education is responsible for the general supervision 
of all public elementary and high schools of the state and for the certifica- 
tion of teachers. He is charged with the supervision and appointment of 
all of the officers and employees of the Department of Education, subject 
to the employment regulations established by the Department of Finance 
and Taxation. He is required by law to conduct institutes and conferences ; 
to make a biennial report to the governor; to certify the attendance to the 
comptroller of the treasury for the apportionment of state funds; and to 
enforce the school laws and regulations of the State Board of Education.‘ 
To assist him in these responsibilities, a staff consisting of an assistant com- 
missioner, two high school inspectors, two rural school agents, three voca- 
tional supervisors, a director of library extension, supervisor of certification, 
a director of industrial rehabilitation, a chief clerk, and a clerical staff of 
ten secretaries and bookkeepers are provided.> 
The State Board of Education is composed of nine members appointed 
by the governor; three of whom must be residents from each grand division 
of the state, and at least three members “shall be representative of the 
minority party.” The governor and commissioner of education are ex 
officio members, the latter being designated as chairman of the board. The 
term of office for the appointed members is six years. The members are 
not paid salaries but receive traveling expenses and a per diem allowance 
of five dollars for all regular meetings and committee meetings.® 
The State Board of Education is responsible for the examination and 
certification of teachers and county superintendents; the administration and 
control of the three normal schools, the Agricultural and Industrial Normal 
School for Negroes and the Tennessee Polytechnic Institute; the appor- 
tionment of the consolidation fund and the appointment of the director of 
library extension. It is further empowered to draw up courses of study and

regulations for the standardization of high schools.? It is also the duty of 
the board to co-operate with the Federal Board of Vocational Education and 
to administer vocational education under the terms of the Smith-Hughes 
Law.® The State Board of Education is also charged with the responsibility 
of the care and education of the blind children of school age who are not 
eligible to the state school for the blind.® 
Tue County SUPERINTENDENT AND Boarp oF EDUCATION 
The school system of Tennessee is essentially a county unit system. 
The only deviation from this is to be found in the organization of certain 
special districts which will be considered in somewhat greater detail in a later 
section of the present study. The educational affairs of each of Tennessee’s 
ninety-five counties are under the direction of a county superintendent, who 
is responsible for the administration and supervision of the schools in his 
own county and who is the executive officer of the county board of educa- 
tion. The county superintendent is appointed by the county court of each 
county and holds office for a term of four years. To be eligible for ap- 
pointment an applicant must possess a" proressio nal county superintendent’s 
certificate issued by the state commission? GF edetation, The minimum edu- 
cational qualifications for this certificate are graduation from a standard 
two-year normal school or college course and twenty-four months of actual 
teaching experience.’® 
The county superintendent is charged with the preparation of the county 
high school budget (but not for the county elementary school budget), 
with the keeping of an accurate record of all financial transactions, and the 
issuing of warrants upon the county trustee. He is required to make the 
necessary reports to the commissioner of education, a quarterly financial re- 
port to the county court, and to certify the scholastic population to the county 
trustee, and the average daily attendance to the state commissioner for the 
distribution of school funds. The county superintendent is further respon- 
sible for the enforcement of the compulsory education law and the issuance 
of employment certificates.** 
The annual salaries for 1921-22 ranged from $500 in Pickett County, 
to $4300 in Knox County with a county average of $1841. Of Tennessee’s 
ninety-five counties only five; namely, Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Mont- 
gomery, and Shelby paid their county superintendents over $3000 for that 
year. Twenty counties, more than one-fifth the total number of the state,

paid their superintendents less than $1500,1* which is the minimum salary 
recognized by the state in apportioning the supplements for the county 
superintendents’ salaries.* It is evident that with such salaries offered and 
with election by a lay board concerned in no other way than financially with 
education, that Tennessee cannot expect to secure a high degree of educa- 
tional efficiency in this office. 
In 1921 the various agencies and boards related to education within the 
county were abolished and the county board of education was established 
to take over the duties and powers of the abolished boards. The new board 
took over the funds and property of the former boards with full control 
and management of the same, but were required to keep the elementary 
funds and property separate and distinct from those of the county high 
schools.** 
The county board of education as at present organized is composed of 
seven members, each with a seven-year term arranged so that the terms 
overlap and thus produce a continuing body. They are chosen by the county 
court at its annual July meeting. The qualifications are: “integrity, intelli- 
gence, ability to administer the duties of the office, and at least a primary 
education.”** The salaries are set by the respective county courts and 
vary from $1.50 to $3.50 per day for not more than thirty days per year.*® 
The county board of education is responsible for the appointment, as- 
signment, and dismissal of all teachers; and it also has the power to fix 
their salaries. It is further charged with the location, construction, equip- 
ment, and repair of all school buildings; the purchase, management, and sale 
of all school property; and the biennial census enumeration of all school 
children. The board is also required to prepare an itemized budget of all 
the necessary expenses to operate the schools of the county, and it is re- 
quired to maintain the schools within the county’s income. The board also 
possesses discretionary authority to set the terms of all schools of the county, 
to establish a teacher’s retirement fund, to establish night schools, and to 
exclude tubercular children from the public schools.%* 
With the completion of the discussion of Tennessee’s educational situa- 
tion, her organization and administrative machinery, we are now prepared to 
enter intelligently upon an account of the sources of school revenue.

  CHAPTER VIII 
SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUE 
FeperaL Aip 
The sources from which the public schools of Tennessee draw their 
support fall into three major divisions: federal, state, and local. Funds 
from private foundations are of some assistance, and will receive treatment 
in the section on state aid. Table III shows the relative amounts ‘which 
the schools of Tennessee received from the various sources for the year 
1920-21, as compared with the public school receipts for the United States 
as a whole for the year 1919-20, that being the latest year for which data 
are available at the present time.

From Table III we see that Tennessee secures on the whole a slightly 
less proportion of her school revenues from local sources, slightly more 
from the state, and about twice as much from the Federal government, as 
compared with the whole country. This is probably due to the fact that 
Tennessee is not providing as generously from local sources as are the other 
states of the Union. It should be noted that practically ~all revenues pro- 
vided by local sources in Tennessee are furnished by the counties; whereas, 
taking the United States as a whole, of the 83.2 per cent derived from local 
sources only 11.4 per cent comes from county funds, the remainder, 71.8 
per cent, comes from school district, or other small local units.t 
The reports of the federal commissioner of education and those of the 
state superintendent in giving the amounts received from federal sources 
for vocational education under the Smith-Hughes subventions, list them as 
state moneys. This would seem to be due to the fact that these subven- 
tions are distributed under the regulations of the state; therefore, they are

simply added to the other state funds. For this reason, the data for federal 
aid are taken from the reports of the Federal Board for Vocational 
Education. 
Tennessee derives federal aid? for public education from the following 
sources: (1) the federal forest reserve fund; (2) federal fines; (3) the 
Smith-Hughes fund. 
The Federal Forest Reserve Act (Chapter 192 of the Acts of Congress, 
May 23, 1908) provided that thereafter twenty-five per cent of all moneys 
received from each forest reserve during any fiscal year was to be returned 
to the state or territory within whose bounds the reserve was situated. These 
proceeds may be used for the support of the public schools and roads of 
the county or counties in which the reserve is located.* 
Tennessee has within her borders 113,724 acres of federal forest reserve 
lands scattered through Carter, Johnson, Monroe, Polk, Sullivan, and 
Unicoi counties. The proceeds which Tennessee secures from this source 
are equally divided and expended for schools and highways in the counties 
where these reserves are located.®>5 Table IV shows the sums distributed 
annually among the six counties entitled to apportionment since 1917.

2 Smith-Lever funds.—Every state in the Union receives federal aid under the Smith-Lever Act 
for the promotion of extension work in agriculture and home economics. Although a portion of the 
moneys, provided by the Federal government under this act are used for club work for children of 
school age, none are paid to the public schools; consequently Smith-Lever funds are not included in 
this account. Each state must match its federal allotment dollar for dollar, except to the extent of 
$10,000. Tennessee received during the year 1920-21, $172,541 from this source and provided to 
match this amount $162,541. United States Department of Agriculture, Circular 203, Statistics of

The Federal Criminal Code® provides that fines for setting a fire or 
leaving a fire burn unattended on the public domain, upon an Indian reserva- 
tion, or upon “lands belonging to or occupied by a tribe of Indians under 
the: authority of the United States,” and failing to extinguish such fires, 
shall be “paid into the public school fund of the county where the offense 
was committed.” No available records or reports list any moneys from 
this source. 
Smitu-HucuHeEs SuBVENTIONS 
By act of the legislature, approved March 31, 1917, Tennessee accepted 
all the provisions of the Smith-Hughes Law.’ By this law Tennessee be- 
came entitled to federal subventions from the Smith-Hughes fund for pay- 
ment of the salaries of teachers, supervisors, and directors of vocational 
education, and for teacher-training in these subjects. This act further 
designated the State Board of Education as the “vocational education board 
to co-operate with the Federal Board for Vocational Education” and to carry 
out the provisions of the Smith-Hughes Act, and made the state treasurer 
the custodian of the funds collected under this act.® 
The federal act places many requirements upon the state which must 
be met in order to receive the federal subventions. The requirement which 
is of chief interest, in view of the character of the present study, is that 
which makes it necessary for the state to match dollar for dollar the moneys 
received from the Federal government. 
The following table shows the Smith-Hughes moneys available for the 
year 1921-22, the moneys actually expended, and the sums appropriated to 
match the federal grant.

whereas, Tennessee spent $14,184 of the $34,801 available in 1917-18, she 
spent $86,280 of the $89,610 in the year 1921-22; thereby reducing her un-

  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE 145 
State Arp 
The main source of state support for public schools in Tennessee is the 
state school fund, which is the name now applied to the income derived 
from three former funds: the general education fund, the permanent school 
fund, and the five-cent elementary school tax, which were consolidated by the 
1g2I session of the General Assembly.’ To understand more fully the present 
fund and its distribution it will be weil to consider the origin and distribu- 
tion of each fund individually. 
Permanent school fund—‘An Act to Establish and Maintain a Uniform 
System of Public Schools,” passed in 1873, made the following provisions : 
The permanent school fund of the State shall be the $1,500,000 ascertained and 
declared by Section 946 of the Code, and recognized by the Constitution of the State to 
be the permanent school fund. To this shall be added the interest which has accrued 
on the same, and not been paid by the State, amounting on January 1, 1873, to $1,012,500. 
For this total amount, $2,512,500, a certificate was issued and signed by the 
governor providing for payment of interest at the rate of six per cent 
annually. 
In reality, this $2,512,500 fund is nothing more than a permanent debt 
recognized by the legislature, and the revenue derived from it is a form of 
state school tax, appropriated from other state revenues. From the scholas- 
tic year 1919-20, $145,252.55 was distributed among the ninety-five counties 
of the state from this source.!? 
That this fund may in time become somewhat of a productive endowment 
is shown by the provisions for its increase. The sources provided by the 
Act of 1873 for building up the principal fall into five classes: (1) proceeds 
of all property escheating to the state; (2) all property accruing to the state 
by forfeiture; (3) land sold and bought in for taxes; (4) personal prop- 
erty of intestates having no heirs entitled “thereto by the laws of distribu- 
tion;” (5) donations to the state for public education unless otherwise 
directed.** No statement in any of the state reports indicates any amounts 
contributed toward the increase of this fund. 
General education fund.—In 1909 the General Assembly passed an act 
known as the General Education Bill, creating the general education fund, 
which was to consist of 25 per cent of the state’s gross revenue. This law 
provided that this fund should be distributed as follows: (1) 61 per cent 
to be apportioned among the counties according to scholastic population; 
(2) Io per cent as an equalization fund among the counties; (3) 8 per

cent to assist in the maintenance and establishment of high schools; (4) 
I per cent to encourage the establishment of public school libraries; (5) 
13 per cent for the support of the four normal schools; (6) 7 per cent for 
the University.1* From this it will be seen that 80 per cent of the proceeds 
of this fund was devoted to the public schools. 
In 1913 the law was modified, increasing this fund to 33% per cent 
of the gross revenue of the state, and at the same time restricting its dis- 
tribution to the public schools and teacher-training institutions..° The 
amount distributed under this law in 1921 was $1,736,125.28.17 Table VIII 
shows the increasing amounts contributed by this fund since 1915.

Elementary school tax —The third fund to be consolidated with the state 
school fund was the five-cent elementary school tax which was enacted by 
the 1919 session of the General Assembly. This fund is the revenue from 
a general property tax of five cents on each one hundred dollars of taxable 
valuation within the state, and is devoted entirely to the support of elementary 
schools..8 For the year 1921, the sum derived from this source was

The 1921 session of the General Assembly provided for an additional 
school tax called the “special elementary school tax,” of three cents on 
each one hundred dollars of taxable valuation. The proceeds of this tax 
are devoted entirely to the elementary schools and are distributed in the 
following manner: (1) $2000 to each county of the state; (2) the balance 
to each county on the basis of the ratio of the average daily attendance of 
elementary school pupils in that particular county to the total average daily 
attendance of all elementary pupils of the state.2 While at present there 
are no records or reports to show the amounts made available by the passage 
of this law, an estimate based upon the 1921 assessment figure for the whole 
state would place the probable sum at slightly over $518,000." 
It will be helpful before dismissing our account of state sources to

revenues furnished by the state. This is done for the year 1920-21 in

Aid of considerable importance in the problem of negro education in 
Tennessee is given by four philanthropic agencies :?? the General Education 
Board, the Jeanes fund, the Slater fund, and the Julius Rosenwald fund.”* 
Though of a private nature, the aid and policies initiated by all four funds 
are state-wide; hence they are considered at this point. 
The General Education Board pays the salaries and expenses of the 
two rural school supervisors and the associate high school supervisor of the 
State Department.** It also contributes toward the payment of the salaries 
and the equipment of the negro county training schools, and the expenses 
of a limited number of teachers in these schools, and of industrial super- 
visors at teachers’ summer courses in state institutions and in Hampton and 
Tuskegee institutes.?® 
The Jeanes fund has aided in the payment of salaries to negro indus- 
trial supervisors and in the extension of school terms in a limited number 
of counties having a term of less than six months. During the year 1921-22, 
Tennessee received $7655 from this fund to aid in the payment of twenty- 
four industrial supervisors in twenty-six counties. The total salaries for 
these supervisors was $23,310, of which the counties paid $7350 and the 
state $8305.28 The sums available for the extension of school terms are

granted on condition that the community secures funds to extend the term 
at least one month; “the Jeanes Board agrees to pay for an additional month, 
provided the salary does not exceed $45.00, and provided further, that the 
terms of as many as six schools be extended in each county.”?”? In 1921-22, 
the sum of $665 was appropriated for this purpose and was used to lengthen 
school terms in Dyer, Lauderdale, and Rutherford counties.?* 
The Slater fund is a maintenance fund and is used to promote industrial 
work in the negro training schools. It is used to help in the payment of 
salaries and to provide equipment for industrial work in the county training 
schools. To qualify for aid from this fund the public school board must 
raise as much or more from taxation.?® 
The initial appropriation for each school cannot exceed $300.00, but is generally not 
more than $250.00, which amount is diminished each year for three to four years, until 
finally the entire expense of the department is paid from public funds.” 
The total sum for these two projects from this source amounted to $6825 
in 1921-22.°° 
The Julius Rosenwald fund, co-operating with the State Department 
of Public Instruction, aids in the constructing and equipping of negro rural 
schools; “such equipment as desks, blackboards, heating apparatus, libraries, 
and toilets being deemed of equal importance with the schoolhouses them- 
selves.” Plans and specifications for such buildings must be approved by 
the general field agent of the Rosenwald fund before construction is begun, 
and aid is available only for schools where the term is at least five months. 
The amounts appropriated by the fund “shall not exceed $500 for a one- 
teacher school, $700 for a two-teacher school, $900 for a three-teacher 
school . . . $1500 for a six-teacher school or larger.” This fund is 
also available for the construction of teachers’ homes. Up to June 30, 
1922, this fund had assisted in the construction of 131 negro school build- 
ings, representing a pupil capacity of 13,680, at the total cost of $512,581.° 
Table XI shows in summary form the objects subsidized by the private 
funds for the two years 1920-21 and 1921-22 and the amounts of aid 
received.

Local aid to public education in Tennessee is derived from two classes 
of public corporations, the county and the city. The sources of revenue 
are essentially the same for both. The county secures its support from the 
following important sources: (1) the county tax levy; (2) poll taxes; 
(3) county and circuit court clerks’ receipts; (4) sale of school bonds and 
property; (5) proceeds from dog taxes; (6) private donations.

> The General Education Board pays the salaries of the two rural school supervisors and the 
associate high school supervisor, although no statement is contained in the reports of the state super- 
intendent as to the amounts expended for this purpose. 
The greater part of school support in the county comes from the annual 
tax levy. The power of determining the annual levy for school purposes 
lies within the authority of the county court, despite the fact that the county 
board of education is required to draw up the annual budget.*t The re- 
quirements and restrictions of this power are as follows: (1) the state 
requires a minimum tax of 114 mills on all taxable property within the 
county ;* (2) to qualify for apportionment of the ‘state equalization fund, 
the county must levy a tax of at least 3 mills;3* (3) permissive authority 
to levy not to exceed 114 mills for county high schools.** 
The only limitation upon the power of the county courts in levying a 
school tax lies in the provision which requires that the total tax for school 
purposes may not exceed the total state tax.°* In an opinion handed down 
by the attorney-general it was held that the county courts had authority to 
levy a tax not to exceed 45 cents on the $100 (4% mills). This does not

include the 10-cent levy (1 mill) for elementary schools which is made by 
the state, but which remains in the county where collected. Thus the maxi- 
mum county tax rate for school purposes is 55 cents on the $100 (5%4 
mills).2° For the year 1921-22, Tennessee secured $6,748,487.42 from this 
source, of which amount, $1,518,418.63 was the high school levy.*? 
The second large source of county school revenue is the poll tax. A 
poll of one dollar is levied upon all males between twenty-one and fifty 
years, except those who are “blind, deaf, dumb or incapable of earning a 
livelihood.” The proceeds of this tax in 1921-22 amounted to $762,597.38 
and were devoted to the elementary schools.%7 
The third source of county school support is the receipts of the county 
and circuit court clerks. These revenues are almost wholly derived from 
merchants’ licenses and ad valorem taxes on merchandise and are entirely 
of a local character. They contributed $471,290.91, ie., 5.2 per cent of the 
total county school revenue for the year 1921-22.°7 
Bonds and the sale of school property constitute a fourth important 
source of county school revenue and in 1921-22 furnished $437,154.54, or 
4.8 per cent, of the total cost of education in Tennessee counties.*7 School 
bonds are issued by the quarterly county courts except in counties of over 
190,000 population, in “denominations of not less than $100 nor more than 
$100,000,” bearing not less than 5 per cent interest and payable in not more 
than 25 years. An amendment enacted by the 1923 Assembly added a 
further restriction to the county’s bonding power by requiring that every 
bond issue shall have the favorable action of a majority of the votes cast 
at an election held for that purpose. However, this provision does not apply 
to refunding issues.*® All bonds are retired by means of a sinking fund, 
and the quarterly county courts are required to levy an annual sinking fund 
tax for that purpose.*? 
The proceeds of all bond sales constitute a “special school fund” and 
can be used only for the following purposes: (1) purchase of school sites; 
(2) erection and repair of school buildings; (3) purchase of property to 
furnish and equip school buildings. County courts are prohibited from issu- 
ing bonds in excess of 3 per cent of the total taxable valuation within the 
county.*° 
Dog taxes upon female dogs over three months old contributed $85,018.51 
to the 1921-22 county school receipts.?7 The tax is three dollars. The 
proceeds of this tax, after deducting administration costs, books, collars,

to the county trustee ‘as a part of the local school fund.‘ 
In Tennessee, as in a number of other southern states, gifts and dona- 
tions from private individuals furnish an appreciable portion of the school 
revenues. In the year 1921-22 Tennessee derived no less than $76,007.48 
from such sources.** Donations to libraries by private individuals to match 
the state aid in accordance with the provisions of the General Education 
Law* added $7587.78 to the counties’ share of the school revenue.?? County 
courts appropriated $17,325 during the year 1921-22 to supplement the 
state aid granted toward the payment of the salaries of county superin- 
tendents, who are full time employees and to whom the county must pay 
an annual salary of at least $1500.48 The county courts also appropriated 
$26,148.09 in 1921-22 for miscellaneous but unnamed educational projects.**

City Aw 
Cities derive school moneys from all the sources of county school revenue 
named above. In addition to such funds, cities organized as separate dis- 
tricts secure a considerable part of their support from: (1) receipts through 
the county trustee; (2) the proceeds from privilege taxes. 
As will be indicated in Chapter IX, after certain payments have been 
made from the state school fund, 66 per cent of the remainder is distributed 
among tthe counties of the state in proportion to the average daily attendance. 
In order to insure that city schools and special district schools shall be in- 
cluded in this distribution, the law makes specific provision for the report- 
ing of average daily attendance of such schools by the proper authorities 
to the county superintendent. The county superintendent certifies the same 
to the county trustee. Thereupon “the county trustee shall apportion all 
elementary school funds, state and county, among the schools of county, city, 
and special districts in proportion to the average daily attendance as thus 
certified to him.” (Public School Laws of Tennessee, 1923, p. 74, sec. 186.) 
For the year 1921-22, the municipal districts received $1,373,002, or 
28.2 per cent, of their city school revenues, as receipts from the counties 
through the county trustees.*® For the same year, city tax levies and ap- 
propriations furnished $2,107,668.49, or 43.4 per cent, of the total year’s 
receipts.*® 
The sale of school bonds contributed $1,242,951, or 25.6 per cent, of 
the cities’ share of educational support.*® It is readily seen that the urban 
communities are more willing to vote bonds than are the rural sections. 
Municipal school bonds may be authorized for the same general purposes 
as those issued by the county courts, but under different restrictions. By 
the law of 1917, they must be issued in serial form, bearing interest at not 
more than 6 per cent and payable in not more than 30 years. A further 
safeguard is thrown around these bonds by the requirement:that they must 
be sold at par.#* The law does not prescribe that municipalities must make 
an annual levy to retire bonds already issued, nor does the law state the 
legal debt limit for incorporated cities. 
It is readily seen that tax receipts and the sale of bonds provide the 
greatest part of the revenues for municipal educational purposes; namely, 
97-3 per cent in 1922. Of the remaining local sources of support, poll taxes 
contributed $30,985, tuition and transfers $56,358, and the proceeds from 
privilege taxes $23,243.*° The proceeds from these privilege taxes are dis- 
tinct from the state privilege taxes and vary according to the individual 
city.> The state reports contain nothing to indicate the types of business 
or vocations taxed, hence no statement can be given.

in Tennessee to present a summary table showing the sums and the per cent 
contributed by each political unit. Table XIV shows that the urban com-

  CHAPTER IX 
THE APPORTIONMENT AND USE OF SCHOOL MONEYS 
A supremely important feature of a sound system of school finance is 
the apportionment of public funds by methods calculated to equalize school 
revenue, school burdens, and, consequently, educational opportunities. How 
well Tennessee’s system of apportionment satisfies this fundamental re- 
quirement will be shown in the following chapter. At the present time 
there are discernible two conceptions of the part which the state ought to 
play in the maintenance of schools. One of these conceptions represented 
today by the policy of Delaware, would place the responsibility for complete 
support and complete control of the schools upon the state. In a system 
such as that of Tennessee which is based upon the other almost universal 
conception in the United States, the state provides a minor portion of the 
school revenues, thus placing the major responsibility and control upon the 
local units. In such a system of school support an important object of 
state aid is to assist local school units to maintain educational standards which 
are accepted as desirable minima, so as to secure at least a minimum degree 
of educational opportunity. In this connection three elements must be con- 
sidered: namely, (1) the ability of; and (2) the effort of the local com- 
munity to maintain schools; and (3) the educational burden of the local 
school units aided by the state. Before turning to the problem of the ap- 
portionment of the various state funds, it is necessary to consider briefly the 
apportionment of federal funds. 
APPORTIONMENT OF FEDERAL Funps 
As already noted in our account of federal funds, portions of the federal 
forest reserve fund are received by six counties in proportion to the area 
of the forest reserve situated in each, Inasmuch as this fund is of 
minor importance, its influence in equalizing school burdens is practically 
negligible. Since the conditions and methods of apportioning Smith-Hughes 
moneys are set down in the federal law and must be accepted by legislative 
action of the states, the requirements for participation are uniform for all 
states. For that reason the bases of apportionment will be considered only 
briefly in this study. i 
Federal subventions for the salaries of teachers, supervisors, and di- 
rectors of vocational agriculture are distributed upon the basis of the pro- 
portion which the state’s rural population bears to the total rural population 
of the United States. Funds for the salaries of teachers of home economics 
and industrial subjects are based upon the proportion which the state’s urban 
population bears to the nation’s total urban population. The allotments for
-P-A-G-E-175
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE 157 
teacher-training of these two groups are based upon the proportion which 
the state’s total population bears to the total population of the United States.* 
Many standards and regulations must be met before a state is eligible 
to receive aid under this law. Three important principles are recognized : 
(1) the state must match dollar for dollar the federal funds; (2) the allot- 
ment for any year is diminished by an amount equal to the unexpended 
balance from the previous year; (3) Smith-Hughes moneys are paid only 
as reimbursements for funds actually expended by the state,* 
APPORTIONMENT OF STATE AID 
Prior to 1921, Tennessee provided three separate state funds for its 
public schools: (1) the income of the permanent school fund; (2) the 
general education fund; (3) the proceeds of the five-cent elementary school 
tax. The General Assembly of 1921 enacted a number of important meas- 
ures; it consolidated the above three funds into one, known as the state 
school fund, and provided for a new fund, the special three-cent elementary 
school tax. The same legislation also provided for a different plan of ap- 
portionment which was designed to carry out the purposes for which the 
funds were provided. 
The new law recognizes two types of funds, which are handled in en- 
tirely different manners. Four different projects are recognized as entitled 
to fixed sums of ‘the state school fund, in reality appropriations, while the 
balance of the fund is distributed on a percentage basis for various educa- 
tional purposes. The four projects or specific purposes which have prior 
claim on this fund are: the equalization fund, the consolidation and super- 
vision fund, supplements for county superintendents’ salaries, and the amounts 
necessary to secure the Smith-Hughes subventions for vocational education. 
In the following paragraphs, each of these funds and the conditions under 
which quotas from the same are granted will be considered. 
Tue State ScHoot Funp 
The equalization fund consisting of $570,000 is distributed annually among 
the counties, each county receiving $6000 upon fulfilling the following con- 
ditions: (1) minimum tax levy sufficient to raise $5 for each child in the 
elementary school as shown by the school census of the preceding year; 
(2) maintenance of a minimum school term of 100 days. The act further 
provides that if a county is unable to raise the $5 per child of school age 
by a tax levy of 30 cents upon each $100 valuation, the county may still 
receive its proportionate share.? This is clearly an attempt to even out in- 
equalities in county wealth.

The fund to encourage consolidation and to assist in the employment 
of trained supervisors is made up of $100,000 set aside annually from the 
state school fund. This sum is distributed solely under the regulations 
and requirements drawn up by the State Board of Education. In drawing 
up requirements for the distribution of aid for consolidation, the State Board 
of Education has two objectives: to assist communities in greatest need, 
provided the necessary conditions are met; and to standardize the type of 
buildings best suited to local conditions.* 
In accordance with section 2 of the General Education Law enacted by 
the 1921 General Assembly, the following requirements are set up: (1) a 
site of two acres for small schools and more for larger ones must be ap- 
proved by the State Department of Education; (2) all plans for school 
buildings must be furnished or approved by the State Department; (3) 
school buildings must be erected strictly according to plans and specifications, 
and must be fully equipped; (4) all buildings and equipment shall be in- 
spected and approved by the State Department before warrants for state 
funds are issued. The state will pay $750 toward the cost of erecting a 
standard two-teacher building; $1000 for a three-teacher type; and a maxi- 
mum of $1250 on a four-teacher or larger type of building, where two or 
more public schools are consolidated. Preference shall be given to counties 
which have not before received aid if the regular applications exceed the 
available sum set aside for this purpose. During the school year ending June 
30, 1922, forty-four consolidated schools were constructed at a total cost of 
$407,130, of which amount the state contributed $43,750.5 
The supervision aid to encourage adequate supervisory assistance for 
county superintendents and to assist in the organization and supervision of 
industrial work is granted to counties hiring trained supervisors who have 
professional training and successful teaching experience and whose qualifi- 
cations have the approval of the State Department of Education. The funds 
apportioned for this purpose must be matched by local county funds or 
philanthropic grants. It is significant that the counties which have main- 
tained special supervisors for some period of time are those which rank 
higher in the standardized tests.° For the year 1922 the state contributed $7445 
as supervision aid, representing about one third of the total cost of supervision 
in Davidson, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, McMinn, Overton, Rutherford, 
Shelby, Union and Weakley counties.® It is important to note that the counties 
have not fully availed themselves of this means of securing assistance toward 
consolidation and trained supervision, inasmuch as only $51,195 of the

$100,000 set aside by the law for this purpose was utilized during the year 
1921-22." 
To assist the counties in hiring competent administrators, $95,000 is set 
aside to supplement the salaries of county superintendents who meet certain 
conditions. To qualify for this form of aid, the county must pay its superin- 
tendent a minimum salary of at least $1500 annually, and no county may 
wSectite More than the maximum aid of $1000. The county superintendent 
must be in the full time employ of the County Board of Education, and all 
reports for the year must be turned into the State Department before any 
part of the state supplement may be paid.® 
The state vocational education fund is a sum set aside from the state 
school fund by the legislature to aid in carrying out the program of voca- 
tional education under the Federal Smith-Hughes law. By law this amount 
may never exceed the maximum allotment available from the Federal gov- 
ernment, and all unused balances revert to the original source. Three gen- 
eral uses are recognized by law, and the following are the purposes for 
which reimbursement may be made: (1) salaries for teachers of vocational 
subjects in the employ of the various boards of education; (2) teacher-train- 
ing in state institutions ; (3) administration and supervision (including the per 
diem expense of the State Board for Vocational Education) .® 
The balance of the state school fund after the four preceding funds have 
been deducted is distributed upon a percentage basis, as follows: 1914 per 
cent for normal schools, 1214 per cent for high schools, 1%4 per cent as a 
high school training fund, 1 per cent for library aid, and 66 per cent as the 
elementary school fund. The normal school quota (19.25 per cent) is used to 
assist the four normal schools of the state and the Polytechnic Institute at 
Cookeville. It is divided as follows: 4.5 per cent to each of the three normal 
schools for white teachers, one in each of the grand divisions of the state; 
3 per cent to the Polytechnic Institute; and 2.75 per cent of the Agricultural 
and Industrial Normal School for Negroes.%° Since the present account is 
primarily concerned with the financial problems of the public elementary 
and secondary schools of the state, no account is given here of the required 
uses of these state funds. 
The 12%4 per cent devoted to the establishment and maintenance of 
county high schools is distributed as follows: (1) maintenance costs of the 
high school division of the Department of Education, (2) $1000 to each 
county of the state, (3) the balance to be distributed according to the average 
daily attendance of high school students within the counties.1*

The 1.25 per cent high school training fund is distributed by the State 
Board of Education to encourage teacher-training in the high schools.%? For 
the year 1921-22, $21,000 was distributed among 37 counties for this pur- 
pose, in amounts ranging from $300, in Fentress County, to $1000 for the 
Wilson County Training School (colored).%* This fund is used to help 
secure new recruits for the rural schools with at least a high school education 
and to give them “some definite professional training.”** 
This form of state aid is distributed under the rules and regulations 
adopted by the State Board of Education.1* To qualify for this aid, a high 
school must be a first class county high school and the teacher-training de- 
partment must enroll at least twelve pupils. State aid is limited to one 
high school for white pupils and one for colored pupils in each county. 
Separate quarters and a professional library of sixty volumes chosen from 
a library list prepared by the State Board of Education are also required. 
The teacher in charge of the training work must be approved by the commis- 
sioner of education and must possess the following qualifications : (1) must be 
a graduate of a standard college or university and have a sufficient number 
of courses to be entitled to a first grade high school certificate or must possess 
equivalent qualifications ; (2) two years of successful experience (preferably 
rural), (3) must be qualified to teach psychology, methods, school manage- 
ment and administration, and rural sociology. 
The one per cent library aid fund is used to encourage and assist in the 
establishment and maintenance of public school libraries.1° This aid is granted 
to schools whose patrons and friends raise by subscription or otherwise a 
sum for library purposes not less than $10, for which the state contributes 
an equal amount not to exceed $40 in any one year. Preference is given 
to counties just establishing libraries and those which “have not previ- 
ously received their proportionate part of the fund according to scholastic 
population.”?” 
The 66 per cent elementary school fund is distributed to the counties 
each year “in proportion to the average daily attendance in the elementary 
schools of the several counties for the previous year.”!8 In 1922, approxi- 
mately half of the total amount of the entire state school fund was apportioned 
to the counties on this basis. A final provision of the general education law 
directs that after the aforementioned claims upon the proceeds of the state 
school fund have been satisfied and the “salaries and operating expenses of the

Table XV and Figure 3 show the objects to which the state school 
fund was devoted in 1922. In Table XV each object is named and the 
per cent of the total fund actually devoted thereto is indicated. In Figure 
3, the various quotas belonging to any one class of schools are brought 
together, and this aggregate per cent is then shown in relation to the par- 
ticular class of institution for which it is expended. For example, in Table 
XV we have two items allocated to high schools; high school aid 8.8 per 
cent of the total fund and high school teacher-training fund 0.7 per cent. 
In Figure 3 the sum of these two, 9.5 per cent, is represented as the portion 
of the total state school fund actually apportioned to the high schools. 
Similarly, items 1, 2, 3, and 8.in Table XV are entirely or mainly de- 
voted to the support of elementary schools. These four items make a total 
of 72.4 per cent of the total state aid in 1922, a far larger share than the 
9.5 per cent devoted to the high schools.

Tue SpeciaL THREE-Cent ELEMENTARY ScHoot Tax 
In addition to the reorganization of the plan of state aid in 1921, the 
General Assembly of that year enacted another measure which aimed to 
produce more revenue for the elementary schools of the state. The amounts 
available under this law are distributed separately from the state school fund 
and are used only for the “purpose of improving the elementary schools.” 
This law provides for a 3-cent tax (three tenths of a mill) on every $100 
worth of taxable property in the state, the proceeds of which are distributed 
as follows: (1) $2000 to each county, (2) the balance on the basis of aver- 
age daily attendance.”°

The law provides that average daily attendance shall be determined “by 
dividing the total number of days that all pupils attended school by the 
number of days the schools were in session.”?1 The county superintendents 
certify their reports on average daily attendance to the state superintendent, 
and he in turn certifies them to the state comptroller, who apportions the 
state funds. All reports must be accompanied by affidavits from each offi- 
cial swearing that they are correct. Certification of a false report constitutes 
a misdemeanor and is punishable by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than 
$100.2” 
Before turning to consider the results of the present system of school 
support it will be well to present a tabular summary showing the methods 
of apportionment and the uses of the various forms of state aid in Tennessee.

CHAPTER X 
RESULTS OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 
Tue GrowtH 1n ScHoot ExPENDITURES 
In keeping with the general situation throughout the whole nation, 
Tennessee has experienced a great increase in her outlays for education. 
While it is not the purpose of the present account to analyze the factors 
behind this general condition, it has seemed fitting to present and to con- 
sider facts showing how Tennessee compares with the country as a whole 
and certain of her neighboring states. Table XVIA shows the growth in 
expenditures for education during the ten-year period, 1910-20.

166 JOHN HAROLD GOLDTHORPE 
From Table XVIA it is seen that Tennessee’s rate of increase in total ex- 
penditures is slightly below that of the whole country for the period under 
consideration. When considered from the standpoint of the cost per child 
in average daily attendance, Tennessee’s rate of increase has been 119 per 
cent as compared with the nation’s increase of 130 per cent. However, 
even with this increase to meet the increasing educational burden, Tennessee 
has not yet reached the level which the United States as a whole had reached 
in 1910, when viewed from the angle of expenditure per capita and per 
child in average daily attendance. This situation becomes all the more 
significant in view of the fact that Tennessee’s expenditure per capita was 
less than half of that of the United States as a whole in 1910 and 1920, 
and approximately one third in 1915. 
It is well to compare Tennessee’s expenditures for education with her 
increases in wealth as evidenced by increases in assessed valuation. To 
secure comparable data, the decade 1912-22 was used. Table XVII presents 
the data bearing upon these two points.

From Table XVII it is seen that while the total assessed valuation of 
the state increased 176 per cent for the ten-year period, the assessed valu- 
ation per child in average daily attendance increased but slightly over 5 per 
cent. Total school expenditures increased 186 per cent and expenditure 
per pupil in average daily attendance increased 131 per cent. Thus it ap- 
pears that the cost of education is increasing more rapidly than the taxable
-P-A-G-E-185
  
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE 107 
wealth; in fact on the basis of average daily attendance the cost increased 
over twenty-three times as rapidly as the taxable property behind each child 
in average daily attendance, which for the entire decade amounted to not 
less than 24 per cent.? 
But the validity of any such conclusions is open to serious question owing 
to the fact that in view of Tennessee’s admittedly faulty system of assess- 
ment it is impossible to state to what extent valuations reported are reliable. 
That they are assessed far below value is evident from the following author- 
itative statement : 
It is not surprising therefore that despite the advances in the values of land all over 
the State which are well known to all those who have investigated the subject the tax 
aggregate has grown very slowly, most of the increases, as shown, being in the assess- 
ments of city property. In fact the Comptroller’s report for 1914 shows that 31 coun- 
ties reduced their average acreage assessment between 1913 and 1914 and that there 
were actually six counties which were assessed at less per acre on acreage property 
in 1914 than in 1879. In the ten years between 1904 and 1914 the total assessments 
of the state increased from $429,767,708 to $672,754,691 or 56.5 per cent. This is not 
an increase commensurate with the rapid growth of wealth. According to the Federal 
census the capital invested in manufactures in Tennessee was $63,141,000 in 1809 and 
$167,924,000 in 1909, an increase of 166 per cent. The value of farm property in 1900 
was $341,202,025 and in 1910 $612,520,836, an increase of 79 per cent. The average 
acreage assessment now is less than $o. 
These figures speak for themselves. Our property every year is assessed on a 
lower basis compared to value. 
In addition, statements of assessors before this committee show that in many cases 
throughout the State the bases of assessment in counties adjoining one another vary 
between 25 per cent and 60 per cent of the actual value of the property in those 
counties. The game of dodging a fair share of State taxes is being played all over 
the State just as some individuals dodge ‘taxes in their individual assessment, and such 
a thing as actual cash-value assessments in accordance with the assessment law of 1907 
is practically unknown anywhere. In fact numerous assessors testified that they dared 
not assess property at its actual cash-value; for, if they did, they were sure to lose their 
official positions at the next election . . . . if, indeed, they were not before that 
time run out of the county. 
We are unable to furnish statistics as to the actual value of property in Tennessee 
as compared with the assessment, but from those collected by its agents the Federal 
Census Bureau estimates that the assessed value of property is about 38 per cent of 
the actual value of property in the State. We are inclined to the belief, however, from 
admissions made by assessors and tax payers who have come before this committee that 
this estimate is much too high. 
Tennessee is now one of the most cheaply governed states in the Union. Only 
four other states, all Southern, imposed a lighter burden on their tax payers as shown 
by per capita receipts and expenditures. These in Tennessee now average only about 
$2 per capita annually, which is about one-half the average for the United States and 
considerably less than the average in Southern States. 
1The average daily attendance in 1912 was 368,888 (Report of Commissioner of Education, 
1913, Vol. 2, p. 26) and that in 1922 was 455,520 (Biennial Report of the State Superintendent, 
1921-22, p. 29); an increase of 86,632 or 24 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-186
168 JOHN HAROLD GOLDTHORPE 
All the states bordering Tennessee except North Carolina and Mississippi expend 
larger sums per capita. Nevertheless, within 10 years our receipts increased approxi- 
mately from $2,600,000 to $4,600,000, the increase being constant from year to year 
showing the prosperity of the State and our expenses have increased in proportion. 
When we consider that in 1904 the State paid out for charities, schools and pensions 
the sum of $980,609.44 and in 1914 paid out $3,075,142.45 for the same purposes we see 
how the heart of our State has throbbed in unison with the great movements affecting 
this nation. Now are we going to escape our obligations to do more for our heroes of 
the past, for our youth, the hope of the future, and for the unfortunates to whom we 
wish again to open the door of opportunity? And also we are under obligations to do 
much more than we have done for good roads and in aid of agriculture, mining, forestry 
and for other good purposes.” 
It would seem that no additional facts are necessary to show that it is 
altogether impossible to state whether school expenditures in Tennessee are 
increasing more rapidly than wealth. 
If space permitted, it would be interesting to consider somewhat at length 
the more important causes of increased school costs, such as increase in school 
attendance, the raising of school standards all along the line, and the decrease 
in the purchasing power of the dollar. But these and other contributing 
causes have been discussed by Swift and others in numerous publications.* 
It may be helpful to discover how Tennessee compares as regards her 
educational situation with certain other states, particularly with her neigh- 
bors. As rated by Ayres, Tennessee ranked forty-first in the Union with 
respect to the efficiency of her school system in the years 1890 and 1900; 
forty-third, in 1910 and in 1918. The states ranking lower than Tennessee 
in 1918 were Kentucky, Louisiana, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, Ar- 
kansas, Mississippi, and South Carolina. Table XVIII shows the expendi- 
ture per pupil in average daily attendance for the years 1910 and 1920 for 
this group of nine states and the United States as a whole, and the expendi- 
ture per teacher. 
From Table XVIII it is seen that Tennessee ranked seventh in the group 
of nine states as to expenditure per child in average daily attendance in 1910 
and sixth in 1920 with an increase of 119 per cent. It will also be observed 
that Tennessee with the median per cent of increase for the decade ranked 
sixth in 1920 as compared with Arkansas with an increase of 104 per cent 
which held the median position in expenditure in 1920. When considered 
from the standpoint of expenditures per teacher employed, Tennessee makes 
a more favorable showing. The state’s position has been advanced from 
third rank to second with an increase of 78 per cent for the ten-year period 
under consideration. Notwithstanding this improvement Tennessee’s ex- 
penditure per teacher is less than one-half that of the nation as a whole; 
nor has she increased her expenditures as rapidly as has the country as a 
whole.

Table XIX presents financial facts with regard to the average annual 
teacher’s salary and the investment in school property per child for this 
group of states and for the same period. Again it will be seen that while 
Tennessee has raised her rank from sixth to second in the group on the 
basis of the average teacher’s salary, the state is still well behind the rest 
of the country. In fact, the state’s average salary for 1920 has but slightly 
overtaken the 1910 salary for the whole country. A more unfavorable 
situation exists as regards the state’s investment in school property per pupil. 
In 1910, Tennessee’s investment in school property per child in average 
daily attendance amounted to $25.14, and by 1920 it had increased to $45.86. 
However, despite that increase, the state had dropped back from sixth to 
the next lowest rank within that group of nine states, Again it should be 
noted that Tennessee is woefully negligent in providing the proper physical 
facilities for the education of her children. When compared with the cor- 
responding data for the whole nation, it is seen that Tennessee in 1920 had 
an investment in school property per child of $46, only slightly more than 
half of that of the country as a whole ten years earlier,

PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE 171 
From the preceding tables it is apparent that while Tennessee was ranked 
above eight neighboring states by Ayres in 1918, the state has failed to keep 
pace with the increased financial outlay made by these same states in support 
of education. It is interesting to note in this respect that Louisiana, which 
ranked below Tennessee, held the first position in the four items in Tables 
XVIII and XIX for both 1910 and 1920. 
There is no escaping the fact that Tennessee will be obliged to make 
greater effort in support of education if the state is to secure a more credit- 
able rank even among her neighbors. The remaining portions of the present 
chapter will deal with the problem of state aid and its results as apportioned 
under the present laws. 
INEQUALITIES IN EpuCATIONAL OppoRTUNITY 
It is a recognized principle of government in the United States that 
the education of the children of each state is one of the fundamental obli- 
gations of the commonwealth. It follows that the basic policies underlying 
all forms of state aid to schools, should aim to secure educational oppor- 
tunities for all the children of the state and to equalize these opportunities 
as nearly as is possible. 
The following paragraphs will endeavor to show to what extent Ten- 
nessee succeeds in realizing these fundamental aims, and to what extent the 
present system of state aid tends to produce equality or inequality of edu- 
cational opportunity and of school burdens. It will be well to consider first, 
inequalities in educational opportunities, and secondly, inequalities in the 
burdens of support, since the former are conditioned to a large degree by 
the ability, aid, and effort of any community to support an educational 
program. 
Five factors which are supremely important in determining the degree 
and character of educational opportunities and results are: (1) the length 
of the school term provided; (2) the qualifications of teachers employed; 
(3) the percentage of enrollment in average daily attendance; (4) the aver- 
age expenditure per child in average daily attendance; and (5) the average 
teacher’s salary. The succeeding tables and paragraphs will present data to 
show the variations which exist among Tennessee counties, and how, under 
the present system of support and distribution of state aid, it is impossible 
to secure anything which approaches an equality of opportunity. 
In 1922, of Tennessee’s 95 counties, 10 had a school term of over eight 
months ; 23 provided a term of between seven and eight months; 29 had a 
term of from six to seven months, and 33, slightly over one third of the 
total number of counties in the state, provided their children with a term of 
less than six months. The average length of the school year ranged from 
86 days in Warren County to a term of 179 days in Davidson; the median 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  172 JOHN HAROLD GOLDTHORPE 
term provided being 128 days. In other words Warren County provided 92 
days less schooling than Davidson, or one week more than the length of 
her own term.® 
Five counties, Van Buren, White, Hancock, Wayne, and Warren failed 
to keep their schools open at least one hundred days, which is one of the 
conditions to be met to secure apportionment of the $570,000 equalization 
fund. Nevertheless, every one of these five counties except Warren received 
aid from this fund in direct violation of the law, a significant commentary 
on the recognized difficulty of enforcing educational standards.°

Table XX presents in tabular form the inequalities in the length of term 
and attendance among a group of nine selected counties. Figure 4 presents   the same data graphically. The counties chosen for this purpose, represent 
the two highest, the two lowest, the three middle, and the quartile counties 
ranked according to the length of school term provided. One of the most 
striking and significant facts revealed by Figure 4 is the great contrast be- 
tween the length of term provided and the number of days attended by the 
average child. 
INEQUALITIES IN TEACHERS’ QUALIFICATIONS 
One of the largest factors in determining the quality of instruction of 
any school is the training which its teachers have received. Data are not 
available to study the qualifications of both elementary and high school

Of the 14,908 teachers employed in Tennessee schools in the year 1921-22, 
62 per cent of those employed in one-teacher schools, as against 48 per 
cent of those employed in the two-teacher schools and 21 per cent in schools 
employing three or more teachers, possessed less than a high school educa- 
tion. It is evident that the worst situation exists in the one-teacher schools. 
In the schools employing 3 or more teachers, 2 teachers out of every 100
-P-A-G-E-192
    
174 JOHN HAROLD GOLDTHORPE 
have completed only the eighth grade, as against 20 in the one-teacher schools ; 
19 have only a partial high school training, as against 42 in the one-teacher 
schools. With respect to the one-teacher schools, it is observed that 62 per 
cent were not even high school graduates; 22 per cent were high school 
graduates; and of the remaining number, only 16 per cent had training 
beyond that represented by high school graduation. Out of this 16 per 
cent, 9 per cent, or over one half, have been to normal school but failed 
to complete the course. From Table XXI, which immediately follows, it 
will be seen that the children in the three-teacher schools have 7 times as 
much chance as the children in the one-teacher schools to secure a teacher 
who is a normal school graduate, 4 times the chance to secure a teacher 
with a partial college training, and 6 times the chance to havea teacher 
who is a college graduate.

® Biennial Report of the State Superintendent, 1921-22, pp. 60-61. 
The general situation is well summarized by the following quotation 
taken from the report of State Superintendent Brown for the year 1921-22: 
Of the 556 teachers in the state who are normal graduates, 71.5 per cent are teach- 
ing in schools employing’ more than two teachers, 19 per cent in the two-teacher schools, 
and 9.5 per cent in the one-teacher schools, where almost one-half of all the school 
children are enrolled. The three-teacher schools with one-fourth of the total enroll- 
ment, have almost three-fourths of the normal graduates, five-eighths of the college 
graduates, and approximately one-half of all the teachers with partial normal, partial 
college, and academic normal training, and one-fourth of the high school graduates. 
There are in the State at present 1,100 teachers who have never entered high school, 
and 3,000 wh ohave entered high school but wh ohave not completed the course. Of 
the group with only an elementary education, the one and two-teacher schools get 93 
per cent as against 7 per cent in the three-teacher schools; and of those with a par- 
tial high school training the one and two-teacher schools get 84 per cent as against 16 
per cent in the larger schools."

Table XXII presents the training of the elementary teachers for nine 
selected counties, chosen on the basis of assessed valuation per child en- 
rolled; namely, the two richest, the two poorest, the three middle ranking 
counties, and the two quartile counties. Shelby and Davidson counties show 
the highest percentages of teachers trained beyond high school, 69.2 per 
cent and 44.5 per cent, respectively; whereas Rutherford has 27.3 per cent; 
Anderson, 19.6 per cent; Monroe, 23.8 per cent; Cocke, 17.7 per cent; 
and Pickett, 6.25 per cent who possess a similar training. It will be noted 
that Jackson and Overton do not have any teachers who are trained beyond 
high school, while Pickett has but two of her total of 32 teachers who have 
had a partial normal training. 
The variations are even more striking when we consider the training 
of those below the high school level. In Overton County two thirds of the 
g4 teachers employed are graduates of the elementary school only, and do 
not possess training beyond that represented in the school they are teach- 
ing. In Davidson and Shelby counties 15.5 per cent and 6.7 per cent, 
respectively, of the elementary teachers possess a training below that of 
high school graduation; whereas, the percentage is 94.3 per cent in Jackson, 
88.2 per cent in Overton, and 99.6 per cent in Pickett counties. The close 
relationship between teachers’ qualifications and the wealth of a community 
is shown by Table XXII. 
INEQUALITIES IN ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE 
It is not enough to maintain schools, an all important question is to 
what extent the children of school age are being reached through the schools 
maintained. Two measures of this situation are to be found: first, the 
proportion of children of school age who are enrolled in schools; and, sec- 
ond, the percentage of those enrolled who are actually in attendance. For 
the purpose of studying this question, Tennessee’s 95 counties were ranked 
upon the basis of the percentage of children on the census rolls who were 
enrolled in school; and of this number nine were selected for comparison 
as to enrollment and attendance. These nine counties were those which 
held the two highest, the two lowest positions, the three holding the middle 
ranks, and the two quartile counties. The facts pertaining to these selected 
counties are presented in Table XXIII. 
This table shows that the enrollment ranged from 60.8 per cent of 
the census enumeration in Knox County, to 100.1 per cent and 101.7 per 
cent in McNairy and Van Buren counties, respectively (see Table XXIII, 
footnote c), and the median for the state was 83.6 per cent. If a child 
lives in Van Buren County the chances are even that he will be enrolled 
in school, but the chances are only slightly more than 73 out of 100 that 
he will be in school on any particular day. On the other hand, if he is 
unfortunate enough to live in Knox County, the chances are only 6 out
-P-A-G-E-195
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE 177 
of to that he will even be enrolled, and only 72 out of too that he will be 
in school on any particular day. 
It is seen that there is little relationship between the per cent enrolled 
and the per cent of enrollment in average daily attendance; thus, Grundy 
County, which ranks sixth in the percentage enrolled, is second in the per 
cent in average daily attendance, and Macon, which is fourth in the former, 
ranks last in average daily attendance. It is evident that the opportunities 
of being enrolled in school and of being in school on any given day vary 
widely among Tennessee’s ninety-five counties.

This table is read: the total number of children enrolled in Van Buren County is 
101.7 per cent of the number upon the school census (6-21 years) ; and of these, 73.6 
per cent are in average daily attendance or in school on any particular day, etc.

> Ibid., pp. 106-7. Computed from the average daily attendance and enrollment figures for the 
respective counties. 
¢ An enrollment in excess of 100 per cent of the schodl census may be due to any one of 
several causes: (1) incorrect reporting of data; (2) influx of population into county and consequent 
increase of school enrollment, after census has been taken; (3) a faulty system of enrollment, e.g., 
dropping pupils’ names from the roll after a few days’ absence and then counting them as newly 
enrolled pupils when they return to school. 
INEQUALITIES IN SCHOOL EXPENDITURES 
Equality of educational opportunity is dependent upon the teachers’ 
qualifications, the length of the school term, and the attendance. These and 
many other factors are, in turn, dependent upon the amount which the various 
counties expend annually for public schools. A comparison of the amounts 
of money expended annually in nine selected counties for the education of 
each school child is given in Table XXIV. This table presents the inequali- 
ties in school expenditure measured by three different standards; expendi- 
tures per child enrolled, per child in average daily attendance, and per teacher 
employed.

It may be readily seen that the two counties ranking highest, Hamilton 
and Shelby, are the highest as figured from all three bases; and the two 
lowest, Union and Hancock, hold the same position on the three measures. 
Of Tennessee’s 95 counties, only 4, Hamilton, Shelby, Washington, and 
Bradley, spent over $50 per child in average daily attendance in 1922, as 
compared with $49.11, the figure for the United States as a whole. From 
the above table it is observed that while Hamilton County spent $92.31 per 
child in average daily attendance, Hancock County spent $9.80 or about 
one tenth as much. The ratio between the extremes as figured upon the 
other basis is not quite as great; in this case being about 1:7. 
We discover that the two counties ranking highest in Table XXIV, 
Hamilton and Shelby, provided a school term for their children of 175 and 
165 days in the order named, as against the terms of 105 and 98 days pro- 
vided by Union and Hancock counties, respectively.? It is also to be ob- 
served that when a composite rank of the three items presented in Table 
XXIV is secured, that only two counties, Marshall and Williamson, have 
exchanged places from those which each held when ranked upon the basis 
of the expenditure per child in average daily attendance.

Figure 5 presents the inequalities in expenditure per child which exist 
among the 95 counties of the state. In this figure, the counties are grouped 
on the basis of expenditure per child in average daily attendance. The 
first column at the left gives the number of counties in the group; the second 
column, the per cent which this group is of the total number of counties; 
and the third column gives the range of expenditures per child in average 
daily attendance for that group of counties. These expenditures are shown 
graphically by the length of the bars. For example, the first group of coun- 
ties contains one county, making 1.05 per cent of the counties of the state, 
and the expenditure for this county is $92 per child in average daily 
attendance.

INEQUALITIES IN TEACHERS’ SALARIES 
Swift has shown in his monograph on Public School Finance in Massa- 
chusetts that on the whole, the training and efficiency of teachers bears a 
close relationship to expenditure for salaries.° Other factors remaining 
constant, a county’s success in securing a qualified corps of teachers is 
mainly dependent upon the salaries it is willing to offer. The financial 
inducements Tennessee counties are willing to offer to secure teachers 
range from $181 in Warren County to $1098 in Shelby County. Table XXV 
sets forth the facts regarding the salaries paid for 1922 as ranked in nine 
distinct groups. 3

It will be noted that but 27 counties, or 28 per cent of the total number, 
paid a salary to their teachers which exceeded $600 per year. Of this group, 
4 counties, Shelby, Knox, Hamilton, and Davidson paid over $900; while 
the median salary was $490. On the other hand, 50 counties, over 52 per 
cent of Tennessee’s 95 counties, paid annual salaries of less than $500. For 
the same year, the average annual salary for the United States as a whole 
was $630.1" 
That the annual salary parallels other measures of educational oppor- 
tunity, may be shown by the facts relating to the school term and teach- 
ers’ qualifications. Shelby and Knox counties, holding the two highest ranks 
as to salaries paid, furnished their school children with terms of 165 days 
and 170 days, respectively.? Moreover, in Shelby County 43 per cent of 
the white elementary teachers were normal school graduates or possessed

training beyond that represented by normal graduation.* In Warren County, 
which represents the other extreme with an average annual salary of but 
$181, only 5 per cent of its white elementary teachers had had standard 
normal school training.** The school term provided amounted to only 86 
days.” 
To answer a possible objection that counties whose inequalities have 
been thus far discussed in this chapter represent extreme variations and 
are not typical of the state as a whole, it DEE séemed best to select certain 
other counties upon another basis. 
State Superintendent Brown in his annual report for the year 1921-22 
presented a ranking of all the counties in the state in accordance with the 
Ayres scale.** For the purpose of further comparison, and to meet the 
possible objection already referred to, the seven counties ranked highest 
by Superintendent Brown were selected. Table XXVI presents data bear- 
ing upon five educational measures included in the Ayres index and the 
ranks which each of these seven counties held. 
It is observed that while the seven counties chosen for comparison are 
those ranking highest by the Ayres scale, and hence are within the upper 
ten per cent of the total number in the state, there is considerable variation 
in the ranks held by each county in each individual measure. In the per 
cent of school census in average daily attendance the variations are the 
greatest; ranging from 51.7 per cent in Davidson, to 85 per cent in Knox 
County. It must also be noted that of the group chosen for comparison, 
only three of the seven counties stand within the upper ten percentile with 
respect to the item of average daily attendance. When the length of the 
school term is considered, the variations, while not so great are still sig- 
nificant. The extremes are 179 days in Davidson, and 147 days in Bradley 
County, a variation of 32 days or more than one and one-half months. In 
this measure two counties fall below the upper ten per cent. 
While the seven counties tend to hold their respective ranks in better 
form when the three financial items are considered, the variations are par- 
ticularly evident. These are doubly significant since they exist within the 
seven highest counties, ranked on the Ayres scale. The greatest variation 
in the financial items of Table XXVI is found int the expenditure per 
child in average daily attendance. Such expenditure ranges from $37.25 
in Davidson, to $92.31, in Hamilton County, a ratio of almost two and 
one half. The difference is hardly so striking when ranked on the basis 
of the expenditure per teacher, but the ratio between the lowest and high- 
est is still approximately two. When these seven counties are compared 
with respect to the average annual salary paid to teachers, it is not to be 
wondered that Hamilton and Shelby hold such a high rank in the Ayres 
scale, since they pay their teachers about two thirds more than does Maury 
County.

PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE 183 
The preceding paragraphs have shown that it makes little difference 
whether we select seven counties maintaining the best educational conditions 
as measured by the Ayres scale or whether we select nine counties on the 
basis of wide variations in wealth per child. The story is the same. Every- 
where gross and ominous inequalities in educational opportunity are out- 
standing and characteristic features of the educational situation in Tennessee. 
INEQUALITIES IN AxBiILIty To Provip—e ScHoot REVENUES 
Having seen to what extent the state has failed to equalize educational 
opportunity, we may now turn to the question to what extent are such varia- 
tions due to variations in the ability of the counties to provide school reve- 
nues and to a defective system of state aid. 
A satisfactory system of school support mest do more than to result in 
securing equal educational opportunity; it must equalize the financial bur- 
dens which are involved in maintaining any system of schools. Chief among 
those factors which condition equality of school burdens in a county system, 
are the following: (1) the ability of a county to support education which 
may be measured by the assessed valuation per child enrolled; (2) the effort 
put forth by the county to provide school revenue, as measured by its local 
tax rate for schools; (3) the assistance which the individual county receives 
from the state. 
In total assessed valuation the ninety-five counties of Tennessee range 
from $273,256,558 to $1,188,975.1° Monroe County with a valuation of 
$1769 per child enrolled, and Crockett with a valuation of $81,015 per 
teacher, hold the median positions when the counties are ranked upon these 
two measures. The county most able to support schools is Davidson, with 
$5894 of wealth per child enrolled and $266,759 per teacher employed, and 
the least able is Pickett, with $747 worth of property behind each child 
and $38,354 per teacher. 
Table XXVII groups Tennessee’s ninety-five counties on two bases: 
(1) valuation per child enrolled; and (2) valuation per teacher employed. It 
is interesting to note that the ratio between the lowest and highest counties 
is essentially the same by either measure (7.9 when computed on the child 
enrolled basis, and 7 on the teacher employed basis). 
From Table XXVII it is seen that 18 per cent of the counties of Ten- 
nessee have a valuation per child enrolled of less than $1200, while 14 
counties, or 14.7 per cent, have a valuation ranging from $3000 to $6000. 
Nearly 57 (56.9) per cent of all the counties in the state have valuations 
between $1400 and $3000 per child. Equally significant are the variations 
in ability discovered when counties are compared on the basis of the valu- 
ations per teacher employed. Six counties possess a valuation exceeding

$160,000 per teacher employed as against 22 counties (23 per cent of the 
total number) which have less than $60,000 assessed valuation per teacher. 
It is readily seen that the counties in the first group are about seven times 
as capable of securing school funds as the counties holding the lowest ranks,

Figure 6 shows the 95 counties of Tennessee arranged in graphs on the 
basis of assessed valuation per child of school age, 6-21 years. The first 
column at the left indicates the number of counties in the group concerned ; 
the second column the per cent which the number of counties included in 
the group is of the total number of counties in the state; the third column 
the median valuation per school child of the counties in each group. This 
valuation is represented graphically by the bars constituting the figure. 
INEQUALITIES IN EFFORT 
Local tax rates in Tennessee are levied and reported in terms of cents 
per $100 assessed valuation. This, of course, has the same meaning as 
mills per dollar assessed valuation. From Table XXVIII it is seen that 
county tax rates for schools in the year 1921-22, ranged from 3 mills (30 
cents per $100 assessed valuation) in Obion County to ro mills in Harde- 
man; while 514 mills is the median tax levied. Twenty-eight counties, or 
30 per cent of the total number, levied a school tax of less than 4 mills. 
Table XXVIII also shows the range of valuation per child enrolled for 
the various counties grouped according to their tax rates.

It is evident that in general the tax rate varies inversely with the as- 
sessed valuation per child. Counties having.a median valuation of $1565 
levy a tax rate of between 8 and 10 mills as against counties with a valu- 
ation of $3137 which levy slightly in excess of 3 mills. It is significant 
that the ratio between the highest tax rate of counties in Group I and the 
lowest in Group VII and the assessed valuation per child is the same, except 
that it is reversed in the instance of the median valuations for the respective 
groups. To what extent Tennessee corrects the above inequalities by her 
system of state aid will be shown in succeeding pages. 
INEQUALITIES IN STATE AID 
The distribution of state aid is open to the same indictment of inequality 
and injustice as the other features of the Tennessee system of school sup- 
port. Van Buren County in 1921-22 received $10.90 per child enrolled 
from the state as against $2.38 which Obion received, while the median 
for the state was $4. Table XXIX, which follows, shows the situation for 
the state as a whole.

The facts presented in Table XXIX become even more significant when 
considered in the light of the ability and effort of the counties to provide 
school revenues. In Table XXX the ninety-five counties of Tennessee are 
arranged in seven groups on the basis of assessed valuation per child en- 
rolled. For each group is indicated the median valuation per child enrolled 
of the counties included in the group, the median tax rate and the highest, 
median, and lowest quota of state aid per child. 
The four counties included in Group I of Table XXX have an assessed 
valuation of from $4000 to $6000 per child, levy taxes, the median tax rate 
of which is 44 cents on the $100 valuation, and draw $3.11 per child from the 
state. On the other hand the twelve counties in Group VI, having a median 
assessed valuation of $1125 per child, have a median tax rate of 67 cents
-P-A-G-E-205
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE 187 
on the 100 valuation, and secure but $4.04 per child as state aid. Thus, 
while Group VI has but one fifth of the wealth of the first group, it has 
a median tax rate which is 52 per cent higher and receives from the state 
but 30 per cent more than the first group. Though the other groups do 
not present the same glaring instances of inequality it is evident that the 
present plan of distributing state aid does not adequately take account of 
the ability and effort of the various counties to support their schools.

INEQUALITIES AMONG NINE SELECTED COUNTIES 
Since the preceding facts dealing with the inequalities of the burdens 
of support have been concerned largely with the situation throughout the 
state as a whole, it has seemed well before concluding the present chapter, 
to present the data bearing upon selected counties. For this purpose, nine 
counties were chosen on the basis of the assessed valuation per child en- 
rolled; namely, the two richest, the two poorest, the three middle counties, 
and the two counties holding the quartile positions. From Table XXXI 
it may be observed that the nine counties range in valuation per child en- 
rolled, from $5894 to $747 (ratio, 7.9) ; in the average tax rate for schools, 
from 80 cents to 32 cents per $100 assessed valuation, (ratio, 2.5) ; in state 
aid per child enrolled from $7.53° to $3.02 (ratio, 2.5); and when the 
state aid is computed on the teacher employed basis, it varies from $386.70 
to $102.35 (ratio, 3.7). 
From Table XXXI it is seen that Davidson, the richest county in the 
state, is almost eight times as able to provide school revenues as Pickett 
County. Davidson levies a tax only three-fourths that of Pickett Coun- 
ty, but produces therefrom $8.81 for each dollar of state aid; whereas, 
Pickett, with a much heavier tax, is able to produce only 36 cents for each 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
    
188 JOHN HAROLD GOLDTHORPE 
dollar of state aid. It is evident that if state aid were to be distributed 
in such a manner as to even out these inequalities Pickett County ought to 
receive from the state approximately eight times as much assistance as 
Davidson. The facts are that it receives only a little more than twice as 
much as Davidson; for whereas Davidson receives $3.19, Pickett receives 
$7.53 per child enrolled.

Turning our attention to Shelby County we seem to have an instance 
which conforms to the principles of school finance advocated by eminent 
authorities. Shelby County ranks relatively high in ability, levies a com- 
paratively heavy tax rate, raises a large amount of revenue for each dollar 
of state aid and receives the least aid per child of any county in the group. 
But this takes on a different aspect when we compare Shelby County with 
Davidson County. For here we discover that the richer of these two coun- 
ties, Davidson, levies a tax slightly more than half that levied by Shelby 
yet receives a larger amount of state aid per child. Similar inequalities 
and effects of the present system of state aid will be discovered by com- 
paring Monroe County, which levies the heaviest tax of any county in the 
group, with Davidson County, which levies the Ightest tax. Equally in- 
teresting maladjustments between ability, effort, and state aid will be revealed 
by a comparison of Anderson County with Rutherford or Overton County 
with Jackson.

The maladjustment between ability and effort in the case of five of the 
counties included in Table XXXI is shown in Figure 7. 
Table XXXII shows the inequalities in the annual expenditure per child 
in average daily attendance, and in the proportions of school support fur- 
nished respectively by local taxation and by state aid. It is clearly shown that 
the poorer counties tend to depend upon the state for a larger share of their 
school support.

From Table XXXII we see that of all the nine counties under considera- 
tion, Pickett, the poorest county in the state measured by its wealth per 
child enrolled, derives the largest proportion of its school support from the 
state. We see also that the state furnished Pickett County a far larger 
amount of aid per child enrolled than is furnished to any other of our nine 
counties. It is scarcely necessary to say that this is as it should be. If 
we compare Shelby County and Rutherford County, Jackson County and 
Overton County, or Overton County and Pickett County in each case we 
will discover that the poorer county receives the larger amount of state 
aid per child and derives the larger proportion of its total school revenue 
from the state and a smaller proportion from county sources. Again we 
note that this is as it should be. 
Let us now turn our attention to certain other counties. Let us com- 
pare the proportion of school revenue and the state aid per child enrolled 
of Davidson and Shelby, of Monroe and Cocke, of Cocke and Anderson 
counties. In the comparisons just suggested, it will be found that in each
-P-A-G-E-208

case the county ranking lower in assessed valuation per child enrolled, de- 
rives the smaller per cent of its revenue from the state and receives the 
smaller quota per child enrolled. From the facts thus far cited, it should 
be evident that there is nothing in the Tennessee system to guarantee that 
school burdens will be equitably divided, or that state aid will be apportioned 
among the various counties of the state in accordance with their relative 
ability.

Before entering upon a statement of conclusions and recommendations, 
which will constitute the next chapter, it will be well to summarize briefly 
the main features of the present school situation in their financial aspects. 
Although Tennessee has increased her school expenditures during the past 
ten years more than 100 per cent, she has failed to keep pace with the 
United States as a whole. Her expenditure per child in average daily at- 
tendance has increased at a rate of only a little more than that of the United 
States for the same decade. While Tennessee enjoyed a superior rating 
among her southern sister states in 1918 according to Ayres, her rate of 
increase in expenditure during the preceding decade was less than that of 
her southern neighbors. 
Inequalities are met with at every hand, and when we come to the ques: 
tion of the equality of opportunity we find wide and ominous variations 
throughout the state. These state wide variations include variations in the 
length of the school term, supply of trained teachers, average expenditure 
per child, and average annual salary paid to teachers. It is evident that 
present conditions are immediately traceable to inadequate funds and un-
-P-A-G-E-209
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE IOI 
sound methods of distributing the same. Inequalities in county wealth, 
i.e., inequalities in ability to support schools, inequalities in the effort made 
to provide school revenue, and inequalities in the aid extended by the state, 
render the counties incapable of solving the problem alone. If the problem is 
to be solved, the solution must come from the state, the only agency competent 
to deal with the present situation and to correct the evils that the present 
chapter has revealed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
CHAPTER XI 
CONCLUSION 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Preceding chapters have revealed the inequalities which characterize edu- 
cational opportunities, the distribution of school burdens, and the appor- 
tionment of state aid in Tennessee. It has been shown that the present 
policies of distributing state aid fail to consider adequately, variations in 
ability and effort of the ninety-five counties constituting the commonwealth. 
It is the purpose of this, our concluding chapter, to present in summary 
form certain obvious but significant modifications and innovations which 
Tennessee must introduce into her system of school finance before she can 
hope to make any important progress in the direction of evening out exist- 
ing inequalities. 
In the second volume of his series on Public School Finance, Swift pre- 
sents three possible plans of equalizing school burdens. Of these three, 
only two apply to the Tennessee situation: (1) the provision of a state 
equalization fund sufficient in size and so apportioned as to even out in- 
equalities among local units; and (2) the assumption by the state of the 
major share of school costs in order thus to guarantee to each local unit the 
necessary revenues to provide what may be termed the minimum essentials 
of educational equality. 
As has already been shown in preceding chapters, Tennessee, in common 
with most of her southern sister states, has organized her school system 
on the basis of the county unit. It remains then to provide sufficient assist- 
ance from state funds to insure a reasonable approach toward the desired 
goal of educational equality. At present the second alternative, namely, 
throwing the major share of the educational burdens of support upon the 
state, represents such a radical departure from the present policies as to be 
commonly regarded as wholly impracticable. 
One deplorable tendency must be called to attention which relates to 
the county unit in Tennessee. It is the ease with which special school 
districts within a county may be created by the General Assembly. This 
practice is sometimes resorted to by the progressive communities so as to 
secure a higher tax rate than the balance of the county; but more commonly 
it is followed by the rural sections to secure a lower tax rate. Commissioner 
Harned, in a statement in the Tennessee Educational Bulletin for May, 1923,” 
says: 
1F. H. Swift, Studies in Public School Finance, the East: Massachusetts, New York, and New 
Jersey, pp. 106-7. 
2 Tennessce Educational Bulletin, May, 1923, pp. 1, 4. 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
    
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE 193 
Wherever special districts have been started in the county, the tendency has been 
to increase their number until eventually they embrace the entire county. If this is 
done . . . the county unit system is practically overthrown and the principle of 
equal opportunity and equal taxation is completely abandoned.” 
In addition to correcting this defect, Tennessee, if she desires a genuine 
county form of school administration, must grant the county board of edu- 
cation full authority over the school budget and complete financial inde- 
pendence from the county court. In line with this recommendation, the 
appointment of the county superintendent should be taken from the county 
court and placed in the hands of the board of education. 
That Tennessee has recognized the value of a state fund to assist the 
counties in maintaining their schools, is clearly shown from her early pro- 
vision for the permanent school fund. However, as was shown in Chapter 
VIII, this fund has become what is essentially a state debt, the income of 
which is a form of state school tax.* It would seem that Tennessee would 
do well to make this fund a productive endowment and to safeguard the 
principal for the future generations. It is suggested that the General As- 
sembly biennially appropriate $250,000 from the general revenue fund to 
restore the principal of the fund until the $2,512,500 recognized by the Act 
of 1873 is fully restored and safely invested. In addition to the sources 
of increase already provided by law, the entire income of the inheritance 
tax, which now yields annually about $250,000* might well be added to the 
principal of this fund. As a corollary to the above recommendations, a state 
board of investment should be established to care for the investment and 
management of this fund. 
Swift has pointed out the declining importance of permanent school 
funds as a source of revenue and the futility of attempting to depend upon 
such funds for any appreciable proportion of state aid.» Even with a large 
productive fund, Tennessee would still be in need of larger revenues if she 
desires adequately to assist the counties to measure up to their educational 
obligations. Under present laws the major part of state aid in Tennessee 
is derived from one third of the gross state revenues, which in turn are 
derived from a state tax of 17 cents per $100 valuation. Consequently, 
the major portion of state aid is in reality derived from,a state tax of 524 
cents.° At present the state normal schools share in this source of revenue. 
In 1922, they claimed $393,000, or about 14 per cent,’ of the total amount.

-P-A-G-E-212
194 JOHN HAROLD GOLDTHORPE 
It is recommended that the normal schools be financed through biennial 
appropriations by the legislature from the general revenue fund, thus leav- 
ing the entire state school fund for the public schools. The state should 
immediately consider means of securing larger funds to assist adequately 
in the equalization of educational opportunities. It is suggested that the 
state should consider new forms of taxation such as corporation, income, 
and severance taxes. It is realized that such modifications cannot be secured 
without reforming the present plan of state taxation. 
That this situation is understood and appreciated by Tax Commissioner 
A. V. Louthan is revealed in his biennial report for 1921-22. Commissioner 
Louthan writes: 
The fundamental defect in our system is not the method and manner of equaliz- 
ing property assessments, but consists in the fact that we are raising entirely too large 
a per cent of our state revenue under the general property tax system. . . . The 
equalization of property assessments does not solve this problem. So long as we shall 
undertake to raise two-thirds of our state revenue under the general property tax system 
so long will the burden on property be too heavy regardless of how perfect the equaliza- 
tion of assessments may be. For almost a hundred years after the adoption of our 
federal constitution there was practically no method known of financing state govern- 
ments except the general property tax. The development of the resources of the country, 
the growth of corporate wealth, and the tremendous increase in the per cent of total 
income arising from commercial and financial activities make it necessary to draw on 
these new sources of wealth; otherwise, with the constant increase of the tax burden, 
property as such, will soon be burdened beyond the power of endurance. 
A number of the most progressive states of the Union have recognized the neces- 
sity of appropriating any unused sources of revenue for state purposes and thereby 
reducing correspondingly the ratio of the burden borne by the general'property of the 
state. The fundamental reason supporting such a system of financing state government 
is that the growth of income and wealth through commercial and financial ,channels 
has greatly outrun the growth of income and wealth resulting from the bare ownership 
of property. Therefore, to continue to finance a state government largely by property 
taxation results in the manifest injustice of taxing property too heavily and other 
forms of wealth too lightly. 
In Tennessee, out of a total annual revenue of something like $10,000,000.00 (ex- 
cluding certain gross receipts which strictly speaking are not revenue raised by any 
form of taxation) $6,200,000.00 is raised under the general property tax or about 62 
per cent. When this amount of state revenue raised under the general property tax in 
Tennessee is compared with the per cent raised in the same manner in the states above 
referred to, it is easy to understand why property taxes are so heavy in Tennessee al- 
though the per capita cost of the state government is very light indeed, compared with 
the per capita cost of the average state government in the Union. 
We may discuss property assessments from now until doom’s day; we may either 
increase these assessments or decrease them, and yet bring no relief whatever to the 
property taxpayer until we have gone to the foundation of the trouble and remodeled 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
    
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE IN TENNESSEE 195 
our system of financing our state government, and so shaped it that we shall raise a 
much smaller portion of state revenue from property than we are now raising.* 
To meet the defects and criticisms above, Commissioner Louthan urged 
that the General Assembly adopt a gasoline sales tax, a corporation fran- 
chise tax, a personal income tax, and an amusement or luxury tax for 
general state revenue. He estimated that these four forms would yield 
about $4,700,000; leaving about one and one-half million dollars to be 
raised from the general property tax for state purposes. At the present 
total assessment figure for the state ($1,728,000,000) this would require a 
state tax of but 2 cents per $100 assessed valuation.® As an ideal solution, 
he further adds: 
The ultimate goal to be attained in modernizing our system of financing Tennessee’s 
state government is the same end toward which the various progressive states of the 
Union are striving, to-wit, the complete elimination of any state tax whatever against 
the property of the state, leaving property to be assessed for local, county, and mu- 
nicipal purposes only. Perhaps it may not be possible to attain this end immediately, 
but it is the ideal system of financing a state’s government.” 
Thus far the present chapter has concerned itself mainly with the prob- 
lem of securing larger revenues for education. This is but half the prob- 
lem; the other half is to distribute these funds, once they are raised, 
in a scientific manner. Additional funds without a just and equitable method 
of apportionment will simply perpetuate inequalities and discourage the 
initiative of the local units. Aside from the several projects ,which the state 
encourages by means of flat grants, Tennessee distributes the greater part 
of her state school fund upon the average daily attendance basis. In 1922, 
48 per cent of the total state school fund ($2,815,945),"* and 55 per cent 
of that which reached the public schools, ,were apportioned to the counties 
on the basis of average daily attendance. While this method of apportion- 
ment is a great improvement over the school census method, and several 
other methods employed in many of our states, it does not take account of 
the relative ability of the, various counties, their respective tax rates, the 
length of school term, nor the number and qualifications of the teachers. 
In a small way it encourages the counties to enforce the compulsory attend- 
ance law. Cubberley says: 
The average daily attendance basis of apportionment, while based upon better edu- 
cational grounds and much more just in many ways than any other single basis so far 
considered, still offers no financial relief to the small and over-taxed country district.

-P-A-G-E-214
  196 JOHN HAROLD GOLDTHORPE 
In combination with other bases . . . it may be used to a very great advantage, but 
alone it contains the same elements of injustice toward the small district as the census 
basis of apportionment.” 
In place of the present method of distributing the major share of the 
state aid upon a fixed grant basis and upon average daily attendance, Ten- 
nessee ought to adopt a plan which will give consideration to the following 
factors: (1) the varying ability of a county as shown by its assessed valua- 
tion per pupil or teacher; (2) the county school tax rate; (3) the length 
of school term provided; (4) the number of teachers employed; and (5) 
the average daily attendance. While such .a plan as this would involve 
considerable statistical computation to ascertain the amount due each county, 
it is much more likely to affect a just and equitable distribution to the coun- 
ties where the need is the greatest. In support of this contention, Cubberley 
adds: 
This combination of bases to provide a means of apportioning funds, so as to more 
nearly equalize the apportionment to all districts, represents'a marked improvement over 
any single basis, because it enables a state to more nearly equalize the apportionment 
to each school unit.” 
Even if the distribution of state aid is accomplished as suggested above, 
there may still be individual counties which are ,carrying heavy burdens 
under the maximum tax rates allowed and are unable to meet the minimum 
demands set by the state board of education. For this group a reserve 
equalization fund should be apportioned to assist those counties which levy 
a tax equal to the median rate ‘levied by the counties of the state but which 
are unable to produce therefrom and from all other sources of state and 
local revenue an amount sufficient to finance a program accepted as a mini- 
mum. It will be impossible to carry out effectively any method of appor- 
tionment which undertakes to proportion state school funds to the variations 
of county assessed valuations until the assessment of property is removed 
from local officers and placed in the hands of the state. 
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS 
We may well close this, our final chapter, with a summary statement 
of recommendations. It has seemed well to add to the recommendations 
immediately affecting policies of school finance, three others (see below 
sections 13, 14, 15) which although only indirectly related to our problem, 
have an important bearing upon certain significant factors involved in this 
problem. p 
Section 1. Prohibit the practice of organizing special districts within counties. 
Sec. 2. Make the county board of education financially independent of the county 
court. 
Sec. 3. Adopt certain minimum standards which the counties must maintain as a 
condition for securing state aid.

Sec. 4. Create a productive state fund and a board of investment to manage and 
invest all proceeds accruing to this fund. 
Sec. 5. Provide for additional state school revenues through newer forms of tax- 
ation such as the income tax, severance taxes, and corporation taxes. 
Sec. 6. Revise the present methods of apportionment of state aid in such a way 
as to take into consideration variations among counties as to: (1) school tax rates; 
(2) assessed valuation per child or per teacher employed; (3) length of school term; 
(4) number and qualifications of teachers; (5) average daily attendance. 
Sec. 7. Provide for additional state funds to assist and encourage consolidation, 
transportation, and employment of supervisors and teachers whose qualifications surpass 
the legal minimum. 
Sec. 8. Provide adequate funds to enable the state board of education to go outside 
the state if necessary to secure a commissioner capable of commanding from $5000 to 
$10,000, and to pay other members of his staff proportionately. 
Sec. 9. Provide that all bond issues shall be made payable serially and in not less 
than twenty years. 
Sec. 10. Raise the legal debt limit of counties. 
Sec. 11. Establish seven months (140 days) as the legal minimum school year for 
all counties. 
Sec. 12. Reorganize the state system of taxation so as to'relieve real property of its 
unjust share and to tax more heavily the newer forms of corporate wealth. 
SeEc. 13. Remove the power of appointment of the commissioner of education from 
the governor and place it under the state board of education with the power to fix his 
tenure and salary. 
Sec. 14. Provide for the better enforcement of enrollment and attendance laws. 
Sec. 15. Place the, appointment, the fixing of salary and tenure of the county 
superintendent in the hands of the county board of education, subject only to the 
limitations as to professional training and experience fixed by the state board of 
education.

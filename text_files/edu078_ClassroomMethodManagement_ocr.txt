    PREFACE 
The many books now available on the teaching of various 
school subjects agree in two important particulars. First, 
each differs from all the others in everything that goes to 
make a book: in standpoint, mode of treatment, terms used, 
and practical outcome. No thread of unity leads their di- 
verse points of view to focalize on a common problem. 
Second, helpful as many of these texts are, no one of them 
undertakes any thoroughgoing organization of the central 
factors involved in a fundamental system of method. The 
result is that we have many “methods,” but come perilously 
near having no method of teaching. 
The present work sets itself the rather ambitious task of 
seeking out and organizing the underlying principles that 
govern all good method. For method can be placed on a 
rational basis. In its broader aspects it rests on perfectly 
definite and simple principles. These principles can be 
clearly defined. They are easily grasped and may be intel- 
ligently applied to the teaching of any subject. Not con- 
tent with a theoretical statement of the general principles of 
method, the treatment carries them across to the work of the 
class room and applies them definitely and concretely to the 
teaching of the common-school subjects. 
, Part I, which is devoted to general method, discusses-the 
(four cardinal elements-which.comprise method. These-are 
(1). the determination of aims (2).the-selection of material; — 
(3). the organization of subject=matter for instruction; (4) 
presentation, or the technique-of-instruction. The first ques- 
tion that anyteacher must ask is, what is my aim, what re- 
sults do I'seek to-accomplish in the mind and experience S of 
the child through the subject I teach? The second question 
is, what material will best accomplish this aim?_ The next

  PREFACE 
is, how can I best organize this particular material to accom- 
plish the aim set up? And finally, how through instruction 
can I best present this material to make it effective? These 
are the four questions that must be answered for every sub- 
ject. They are the questions that underlie all rational 
method when broadly conceived. 
The aim of education, and hence of any subject in the 
curriculum, is to be defined in terms (1) of fruitful knowl- 
edge, (2) right attitudes, (3) applied skills. Hence the 
question for each subject becomes how to select, organize 
and present such material as will result in the desired knowl- 
edge, attitudes and skills. The answer to this problem for 
any particular subject constitutes its method. {From this 
point of view method becomes very ‘definite and concrete, 
and its application to school-room practise very immediate 
and specific. 
Part II builds on the foundations already laid and out- 
lines the method of the elementary subjects. In each case it 
asks the question (1) what is the aim of this branch—what 
fruitful knowledge, what helpful attitudes, what applied 
skills should it give the child; (2) what particular subject- 
matter must be used to accomplish these aims; (3) how 
shall I organize and teach this material to reach the desired 
aim. In answering these questions there has been an attempt 
to avoid mere dogmatism and to use the best current points 
of view in education. 
Part III deals briefly with the problems of class-room 
management. Teaching implies control of the conditions 
under which instruction is given. Not to be a good manager 
is to defeat the best of teaching method. Good class-room 
management will supply favorable conditions (1) for teach- 
ing and learning, and (2) for promoting the development of 
character.

CHAPTER I 
METHOD IN EDUCATION 
ETHOD in education—but is there such a thing as 
method? Or are there of necessity as many “meth- 
ods” as there are teachers? Must not each of us have his 
own method and make it different from the method of any 
one else? Must there not be as many different methods as 
there are subjects to teach, each subject demanding its own 
special method’ after its kind? Must I not employ as great 
a number of methods as I have children in my class, adapt- 
ing my method to the mind and grasp of each child? And 
does not all this so complicate the question of method that 
it resolves itself into a hopeless tangle to which we can find 
neither head nor tail?—So why waste time on the subject! 
The Importance of Method 
We shall hope to find answers to these questions as the text 
goes on. But the very fact that such questions naturally arise 
and that they seem to imply a negation of method suggests the 
need of a thoroughgoing study of the principles underlying it. 
For we can not thus put the problem of method lightly aside. 
Nor must we evade it because it appears difficult. The ques- 
1
-P-A-G-E-16
  2 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
tion of method is fundamental in any scheme of education. 
It lies at the basis of all good teaching. Its validity meas. 
ures the worth of instruction, and its excellence conditions 
the result of effort expended by the pupils in learning. Not 
to employ good method in the class room is in large degree 
to render futile all other school facilities, however good and 
complete. 
The function of method.—This is true because method 
finds its function at the most crucial point of the entire 
process of education—where the teacher meets the child 
face to face in the business of teaching and learning. 
' Method motivates and guides all our instruction. It selects 
material and determines emphasis. It adapts what we teach 
to the learner’s mind and seeks the adequate incentives to 
effort. It underlies the whole question of aim and the means 
of its attainment in teaching. And it is for these things that 
we erect school buildings, provide courses of study and 
maintain schools. 
It is probably not too much to say, therefore, that our 
final measure as teachers is best determined by our ability 
to conceive and use the fundamental principles of method. 
If we were all able to employ as good method in our in- 
struction as is now known through the researches of psy- 
chology and the science of education, it is likely that fully 
one-half the pupil’s time might be saved, or his progress 
doubled. This means, if the estimate be true, that it is 
within our power, through the use of good method, to 
double the efficiency of our educational system! 
Method Not Standardized 
In spite of the fundamental importance of method it is 
yet in a crude state. In few if any fields of instruction has 
method been standardized; that is to say, there is no
-P-A-G-E-17
METHOD IN EDUCATION 3 
general agreement on the question, either as to theory or 
practise. Nor does this apply to new fields of instruction 
alone, but also to subjects such as language and mathe- 
matics, which have been in the curriculum for centuries. 
On no other phase of educational theory or practise is there 
so little agreement and so much difference of opinion as on 
method. Equally successful teachers use very different 
methods, while those of vastly different degrees of ef- 
ficiency may be employing the same method. ' In fact there 
are not a few skeptics who scoff at the whole question of 
method. Some go so far as to say that what one knows 
himself he can teach to others, without troubling himself 
about any details of method. But thoughtful teachers know 
better than this, and those who make such claims are usually 
the best refutation of their own false position. 
Many conflicting methods.—The feeling on the part 
of teachers that method, even if still in a nebulous stage, is 
of primary importance has brought about the invention of 
many diverse “methods” in almost every field of instruction. 
Witness all the transformations in method from Comenius 
down to Montessori. So-called methods spring up like 
mushrooms overnight to flourish for a season, and then fall 
away to be heard of no more. Who has not been bewildered 
and perchance puzzled by the conflicting arguments for 
rival methods for the teaching of language, nature study, 
number, or what not! And who has not seen the methods 
advanced so successfully and defended so valiantly this 
year superseded next year, or next decade, by other methods 
as promising, but as short-lived! One has but to recall cer- 
tain famous “methods” greatly in vogue a few years ago, 
but now to be found only in the scrap-heap of educational 
theories, to understand the ephemeral nature of many of the 
methods that have been invented. 
The trouble has been that most of these so-called methods
-P-A-G-E-18
  
Ge a 
4 CLASS-ROOM. seen ili AN AEE 
have lacked a foundation of psychological and educational 
principles, and so have failed in the test of use. They have 
been founded on the sand of mere personal opinion or in- 
dividual aptitude and could not stand the storms of criticism 
or even the more moderate strain of general service in the 
class room. They have lacked vitality and permanence be- 
cause they did not successfully meet the needs of the child. 
Can Method Be Standardized 
Is there, then, no such thing as method, but only an eter- 
nal succession of short-lived “methods”? Must we all go at 
our instruction more or less blindly, depending on an em- 
pirical cut-and-try process to discover what is valuable and 
what is futile in our teaching? Can we reach no common 
ground of agreement in instruction simply because there is 
none? Must the science and philosophy of education admit 
that this, the most fundamental of all questions in teaching, 
is, for the present at least, beyond the reach of help or 
guidance? Are there no principles whose validity and value 
have been tested and upon which we may build a more per- 
manent and trustworthy structure of method than has yet 
appeared? Must all our progress in teaching be won anew 
by each novice at the expense of the children he teaches? 
Is there no hope of standardizing method? 
Standardizing method.—Method can never be standard- 
ized in the sense of making it an iron-clad set of rules or a 
fixed mode of procedure in teaching to be obediently fol- 
lowed by all alike. The infinitely diverse personalities of 
both teachers and pupils, and the many aspects and varieties 
of subject-matter to be taught make this wholly impossible. 
Yet there are certain fundamental principles upon which 
effective and valid method can be built. And these are en- 
tirely susceptible of discovery and analysis.
-P-A-G-E-19
REE ST De set COU ae RE aE BE Lak), See Ray ey =e ec ee 
METHOD IN EDUCATION 5 
The standardizing of method will therefore depend on the 
discovery and application of a proved set of guiding prin- 
ciples, rather than on agreement as to any set of minor 
details. While there can be no such thing as a method to be 
adopted and used in precisely the same fashion by all teach- 
ers, there are reasonably definite laws upon’ which every 
teacher can base his instruction. And, knowing these prin- 
ciples and laws, we can each apply them to our particular 
subject and class. While latitude must always be left for 
the individuality of the teacher, and while as far as details 
go there will of necessity be as many different modes of 
teaching a subject as there are teachers, yet there is a matrix 
of true method out of which all methods should grow. 
Foundation principles of method.—The principles of j 
method, lying, as will be shown later, deep in the needs and 
demands of society on the one hand and in the nature of the 
learner on the other, are broad enough to include all the 
fields or subjects of instruction. Their range and scope are 
sufficient to embrace all ages and stages of learning from the 
kindergarten to the university. The principles of method, 
once formulated into a usable program may, therefore, be 
of service to all teachers, no matter what their field, or the 
stage of advancement of their pupils. 
But we must understand from the first that no system of 
method can be devised to take the place of insight and effort 
on the part of the teacher. Far from being a ready-made 
device capable of being put into use without our under- 
standing its structure or intent, true method is rather a 
means by which we more skilfully use our own powers of 
interpretation, thought and skill in teaching. Instead of 
taking from us the necessity for initiative, method rightly 
conceived, opens the way for individuality and invention; 
instead of being a limitation, it becomes a condition of free- 
dom. Not a piece of self-operating machinery, therefore,
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
but an instrument of instruction created by our own intelli- 
gence and guided by our mastery is what we seek through 
method. 
The Teacher's Knowledge of Method 
It is the teacher’s business to know the principles of 
method. The industrial world has discarded blundering 
empiricism as a means of reaching results. The methods 
and processes used in the production and distribution of 
wealth are guided by carefully determined scientific laws 
and formulas. Nothing in either of these fields is left to 
chance or accidental success. Efficiency and the elimination 
of waste are the watchwords of commercial activities. Busi- 
ness, commerce and industry have quit guessing and gone 
to finding out. 
Scientific spirit demands better method.—Indications 
that this same spirit is entering our system of education are 
not lacking. But only a beginning has been made in deter- 
mining our educational procedure by scientific laws now 
available. As teachers we need more fully to realize that 
preparation for teaching involves more than a mastery of 
the field of knowledge to be taught. We need to see that 
teaching requires not only a knowledge of the matter of 
instruction, but also of its technique, that is, of its method. 
Nor is the obligation at this point less upon the adminis- 
trators of education—the superintendents, principals and 
supervisors—than upon the teachers. Under our present 
educational organization it will be impossible, at least within 
any reasonable time, to have all teachers professionally 
trained. But all who supervise or administer education 
should be professionally educated. Supervision has here- 
tofore devoted itself very largely to the oversight of fiscal 
and physical matters and to problems of organization and
-P-A-G-E-21
  METHOD. IN EDUCATION 7 
control. Superintendents have been chiefly business man- 
agers. There has been comparatively little supervision of 
teaching; and teaching, as already shown, is the crux of the 
whole educational process, the point at which our schools 
finally succeed or fail. The educational supervision of the 
future must therefore extend to matters of method; it must 
be able to advise, counsel and help the teacher in the actual 
work of instruction. The obligation that this point of view 
places on the administrator is obvious ; he must be a master 
of method, as well as of the business and organization 
phases of education. 
The Functional View of Method 
While the analysis of the elements entering into method 
will be made in detail in a later chapter, it will be service- 
able to consider at this place the view-point from which to 
approach the subject. 
Method measured by what it will do—We may look 
on almost any concept, either (1) from the point of view of 
its structure or (2) of its function. We may concern our- 
selves with how a thing is made, or with what it does. The 
criterion for the judging of method is the functional—what 
will the method do in advancing the learning of the pupil. 
The failure of many of the attempts at formulating meth- 
ods have been due to conceiving it from the wrong point of 
view. Method has too often become an end in itself instead 
of a means. The inventor of a “méthod” has looked on his 
creation with pride and said, “See what a beautiful piece of 
educational machinery! Note its structure. See how per- 
fect its adjustment, part to part. How smoothly the joints

soon laid aside and heard of no more. Where is the trouble? 
Was not the mechanism well devised ; did not the joints fit; 
were not the parts admirably adjusted? Yes, all this was 
very true, and yet the method proved futile; for it was 
built on plans and specifications that had in mind a certain 
structure—a bit of mechanism calculated to accommodate 
some section of subject-matter. The maker ofthe method 
had not conceived his method as a means of fitting into the 
needs and demands of the children who were to learn the 
matter. He had fixed his thought on the mechanism instead 
of on the working of his creation—on its structure rather 
than its function. This is all to say that the inventor took 
a logical instead of a psychological point of view of method. 
He was concerned with the arrangement of material rather 
than with the activities and needs of growing minds. 
The needs of children in their learning determine the 
method.—The requirements of the learner and not of 
the material are the basis of all true method. Method must 
be primarily psychological instead of logical or mechanical. 
Indeed method was defined by Froebel as the psychologizing 
of subject-matter. The question then becomes, not how can 
a given amount of material be arranged in its logical di- 
visions and sections to show the relations of a finished 
whole, but how can this vital subject-matter be organized 
and presented so as to afford the learner the most natural 
mode of approach to its mastery? What method shall I 
take to stimulate and guide the child in the unfolding of his 
powers and the gaining of the knowledge and attitudes re- 
quired in his living? How can I teach children instead of 
teaching arithmetic, grammar or Latin? 
The practical outcome of the difference between the logi- 
cal and the psychological type of method will be further 
discussed in a later chapter.

  METHOD IN EDUCATION 9 
Summarizing, we are obliged to conclude that, though 
the question of method presents many difficulties, it must 
be solved if teaching is to keep pace with other professions ; 
that, while method is so far but little standardized, it can 
nevertheless be standardized under broad fundamental laws 
and principles; that the failure to work out permanent and 
fruitful methods for the various school subjects has come 
from neglect of these fundamental laws and principles, and 
not from insuperable difficulties in the problem itself; and 
finally, that no teacher is prepared to teach and no superin- 
tendent to direct who does not have a working mastery of 
the principles of educational method. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. In how far can you say you have a method of teaching the 
different subjects? How did you come by your present method: 
copy it from another teacher, appropriate it from reading or instruc- 
tion, or consciously develop it out of your own observation, experi- 
ence, study and the needs of your class? Which is the best way? 
2. What is che distinction between method and device? What is 
the test of a good mcthod or device? May a method be easy for the 
teacher to handle, and yet not valuable to the class? 
3. It is said that we get only about fifteen per cent. of the energy 
in coal actually applied in the locomotive engine. What proportion 
of the available ability of your pupils do you estimate is left latent 
through your inability to set all of their powers at work? How does 
this bear on the problem of method? 
4. Examine some of the popular “methods” now in use to deter- 
mine whether the method seems to have been conceived to accom- 
modate a certain range of material, or to fit the needs of the child’s 
mind. 
5. In your experience with superintendents and principals, in 
how far have you found them helpful in connection with your 
teaching—the method and instruction side ef your work?

CHAPTER Ii 
METHOD AND THE POINT OF VIEW 
EFORE taking up a detailed study of method let us 
briefly consider the best mode of approach to our 
problem. One’s understanding and use of method depend 
primarily on the point of view from which he looks on 
education as a whole. What is education? What is its 
process and what its purpose? Just what changes are taking 
place in the individual when he is in the process of being 
educated? And, by the same token, how shall we know 
when he has become educated ;, what are the marks of an 
educated man? Our answer to these questions will depend 
on our educational point of view—on the part we believe 
that education should play in the life of present-day men 
and women. 
A definite purpose.—The questions we have asked 
naturally lead to certain others: What part shall the particu- 
lar subject or field you or I may teach play in education—in 
the education of our individual pupils? What is the function 
of our subject as educational material? Why should I be 
teaching history, or you be teaching language, and the chil- 
dren studying these subjects rather than some other section 
of human culture? What should be the effective outcome, 
the educational result, of the language, the number, the 
science, or the history that we teach our pupils? In a word, 
what definite effects do you and I seek and expect through 
our instruction? What specific changes do we aim to secure 
in our pupils which otherwise would not occur? 
10
-P-A-G-E-25
  METHOD AND THE POINT OF VIEW Il 
The Two Factors in Education 
It is not necessary that we should give a full and formal 
answer to our questions at this point. The answers will 
develop as our study proceeds. But at the very outset we 
must remember that there are the two fundamental factors, 
and not, as many have assumed, but one to be dealt with in 
our teaching. The child, as well as the subject-matter, is to 
be taken into account. 
The objective of teaching—As Professor Adams re- 
minds us, “Verbs of teaching govern two accusatives, one 
of the person, another of the thing; as Magister Johannem 
Latinem docuit—the master taught John Latin.” And John 
comes first. Our function as teacher is primarily to serve 
as an intermediary between these two factors—John and 
his Latin. We are to bring the child into contact with cer- 
tain matter to bé-tearned—the culture material, or past ex- 
perience, of the race. Out of the action and interaction of 
these two, education is to come. Out of the child’s response 
to this material, the way he grapples with it, masters it, 
finally lives it, come his educational growth and develop- 
ment. 
To illustrate this fundamental truth still further: The 
child comes into the world, indeed comes into the school, 
with much potential and very little actual capital. Nature 
has through heredity endowed him with all the powers and 
capacities he will ever have. But these are still in embry- 
onic form. They lie relatively dormant, waiting for the 
awakening that comes through the stimuli of the world about 
and the experiences of the school. Given just the right touch 
at the opportune moment, and these potential powers, now 
but a promise, will spring into dynamic abilities, actively at

12 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
work in the world. Left without the necessary stimuli, none 
of the capacities supplied by nature will reach their full 
function, and many will lie impotently fallow. 
Education the producing and directing of changes.— 
Let us not, on the other hand, be deceived. Education 
creates no power or capacity; it only develops what nature, 
through heredity, has planted in the individual. What is 
evolved through the process of education must first have 
been involved by biological transmission from ancestry, near 
and remote. 
As Thorndike so skilfully insists, all education may be 
looked on as a process of effecting certain changes among 
the original powers and capacities of the individual. Some 
of these original tendencies are, through education, to be 
encouraged, strengthened and rendered more certain; they 
are to be trained and set at work in the great social process 
of which we are a part. Other tendencies are to be checked, 
suppressed, or replaced by more useful ones. In short, 
through education the desirable potentialities of the child 
are to be made actual, and the undesirable ones eliminated 
to the largest possible degree. 
Subject-Matter an Instrument in the Teacher's Hands 
True it is that many of the most fruitful educational 
stimuli come to the child from wholly outside the school 
without the help of teacher or curriculum. The influence 
of the relations and duties of the home, the associations of 
playmates, and the multiform experiences in the great world 
of nature and of people can not be overestimated. No small 
part of the child’s education arises in these unorganized 
agencies of education—must arise in them because they 
. alone supply the stimuli necessary to many of the original 
powers of the individual.
-P-A-G-E-27
  : METHOD AND THE POINT OF VIEW 13 
Yet it is equally true that these informal agencies can 
not of themselves successfully educate the child. There are 
some powers that require more thorough training than they 
can get outside the school. There are certain abilities that 
demand special treatment to make them efficient. There 
are fields of knowledge, phases of attitude and interests, and 
types of skill that must not be left to chance development by 
uncontrolled agencies, but must be made secure by con- 
sciously planned instruction. 
The function of subject-matter—These facts suggest 
the point of view from which the teacher is to look on the 
subject-matter he teaches. All subject-matter is to be 
looked on as a tool or instrument in our hands for effecting 
certain changes in the powers and tendencies of the child. 
It is to serve as a stimulus for arousing the child’s native 
energies and setting them to work. Through the subject we 
teach, the desirable qualities and capacities of our pupils are 
to be aroused, quickened and encouraged, and the undesi- 
rable ones checked and repressed. Through our instruction 
the life and experience of the learner are to be constantly 
modified the better to fit him into the social activities of 
which he is a part. Our teaching of history, of science, of 
literature is to supply the necessary knowledge, attitudes 
and skills for successful living. 
The real meaning of all this is that we must teach children 
instead of subjects. Subject-matter can never be an end in 
itself. Language, or science, or mathematics, can not be 
taught for its own sake. However beautiful the language, 
however true the science, or however perfect the mathe- 
matics, the crucial’ question becomes, what will this subject 
accomplish in shaping the powers and tendencies of the 
learner in fruitful directions? 
Subjects as means instead of ends.—Paradoxically, 
this point of view demands that we shall never teach arith-
-P-A-G-E-28
Pe Sr RC, SAT PPR TTL et oT TER! Cie te EY SC MEE PORTS 1. Ae aN Rea eae Pe ae 
14 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
metic, history or language. ~ We must teach through these. 
They are to our hands what the artist’s brushes or the car- 
penter’s saws, planes and chisels are to him—not an end in 
themselves, but instruments for shaping into more perfect 
and useful forms the material upon which he works. With 
this position once taken we shall never be proud or satisfied 
with having taught our class so much subject-matter—so 
many pages of history, so many books of Cesar, or so many 
facts of science. We shall rather inquire, what have these 
things done for the boy or girl, what has bes the effect of 
our teaching and of their learning? We shall realize that 
in teaching John literature we are not only dealing with two 
objectives, but that the greater of these is John. 
The Student Versus the Teacher 
Even after full acceptance of the position that the effect 
on the learner and not the bestowal of so much subject- 
matter is to be the measure of our teaching it is not so easy 
to carry this view out in practise. For the manipulation of 
material is always easier than the stimulating and directing 
of mind. It is a much simpler thing to teach algebra than 
to teach John. Any one of fair intelligence can master a 
subject or a field of knowledge; but it is altogether harder 
to interpret the effect that this subject is having on the 
mental process of our pupils. No one has the least trouble 
to learn arithmetic or geometry, but to discover how to use 
these in producing the right changes in the native powers 
and tendencies of a child is infinitely difficult. 
The transformation from student to teather—Mos of 
us, before we are ready for the school room, must have our 
point of view made over from that of the student to that of 
the teacher. During the time that we ourselves are learners 
instead of teachers our powers of mastery and interpreta-
-P-A-G-E-29
  
METHOD AND THE POINT OF VIEW 15 
tion are naturally and rightly centered on the thing we are 
learning. We are studying subject-matter and not thinking 
of teaching it to others. We grasp and master the material 
as best we can from the vantage ground of our own inter- 
ests, intellectual aptitudes and enthusiasms. But the mo- 
ment we become teachers this must change. We shall not, 
of course, forget nor lose out of account the importance of 
the subject-matter we present, but it now ceases to be the 
primary thing in our thought and interpretation. Instead of 
being an end in itself it becomes but an implement in our 
hands, and the developing lives of our pupils stand out as 
the real end and aim of our instruction. 
As Doctor Dewey remarks, the subjects we teach mee 
become so much a matter of second nature to us, be so much 
part and parcel of our being, that when we stand before the 
class as teacher all our powers of insight and effort are given 
to shaping the minds of our pupils. The material we teach 
is of supreme significance, but its importance is that of in- 
strument or means and not of end. The transforming mind 
of the child defines the aim of our instruction. 
Dangers to the best prepared teachers—From one 
point of view the danger of making the material we teach 
an end in itself is greater to those who are academically best 
prepared. The reason for this is not far to seek. The teachers 
who come from university, college, or even from some nor- 
mal schools, have for a number of years lived in an atmos- 
phere of subject-matter. They have been assigned lessons in 
it, studied it, recited it, been examined in it, had it lectured to 
them, and in many other ways had it pressed on them. Their 
instructors have been specialists in their respective fields, 
who lived, moved and had their mental being in the field 
they had espoused. Little wonder that these specialists, im- 
mersed in their subjects and deeply attached to them (and 
who would have them otherwise!), have centered the  
-P-A-G-E-30
  16 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
thought and affection of their students on the culture mate- 
rial they represent. 
It further comes about that the students who develop spe- 
cial aptitudes for certain fields devote themselves to their 
chosen line still more intensively. Following the inspiration 
of a favorite teacher or the bent of their oa interests and 
abilities they specialize in the subject they expect to teach. 
Into this field they delve as deeply as may be, lavishing on 
it their major attention and effort. Feeling inspired and 
stimulated by its truths they dwell upon and become familiar 
with its concepts and lessons and make them a part of their 
lives. In a word, they fall deeply in love with their subject. 
The right attitude toward one’s subject—Let it not 
be understood for a moment that I am criticizing the center- 
ing upon one’s subject all the enthusiasm, interest and love 
at his command—as a student. Indeed only this attitude 
toward a field of study can rightly prepare one to teach it. 
Only the enthusiast can arouse enthusiasm in others; in- 
terest is caught by the contagion of other interest. 
But when all this is granted the fact still remains that as 
one passes over from the state of a learner to that of a 
teacher his point of view must change. He will still love 
his subject and not less than before; but as a teacher he 
will prize it not for its own sake, nor for what it means to 
him, but for what he can effect through it in the lives of his 
pupils. He will still be devoted to his field of literature or 
science or what not; but as a teacher he will cherish it for 
the changes he can cause it to work in the knowledge, the 
interests or the attitudes of his boys and girls. 
Right point of view vital to method.—Until some such 
point of view as that proposed in this chapter is adopted 
there is no possibility of any rational approach to the sub- 
ject of method in its true and broader meaning. For as long 
as subject-matter is conceived, either consciously or uncon-
-P-A-G-E-31
  METHOD AND THE POINT OF VIEW Wel ie 
sciously, as an end in itself, so long must the mechanism or 
structure instead of the function or effectiveness of the 
method be the criterion of its creation and use. For the 
material and not the child will then be the center-of concern. 
Until the stimulating, training and directing of the child’s 
powers and capacities instead of the mere lodgment of sub- 
ject-matter in the mind becomes the aim of our teaching, so 
long will our “methods” be devised in accordance with me- 
chanical instead of psychological laws—and so be relatively 
futile. 
Shall we then agree as we enter on our study of method, 
that the point of view from which we conceive education is ’ 
all-important ; that the aim we set up for our particular sub- 
ject must accord with the aim of education as a whole; that 
no subject-matter can be taught or learned for its own sake, 
but only for what it will accomplish in stimulating and shap- 
ing the powers of the child; that our geography or literature 
is of value only when it results in fitting the learner more 
successfully into his place and increasing his efficiency in the 
business-of living. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Make a list of the points in which an educated man differs 
from an uneducated, arranging these points in the order of their 
importance. Are you ready at this stage of your study to formulate 
a definition of education (not merely quoted) ? 
2. Suppose each of us engages in a little heart searching to de- 
termine whether we are chiefly teaching material or boys and girls. 
That is, what is our standard of success, the lodging of so much 
matter, or the effects of it? 
3. Why is it that elementary teachers are not required to have as 
much preparation as high-school teachers, and receive less pay? Is 
it because it has been assumed that the stuff taught is the measure 
of difficulty in teaching? Measured from the learner’s side, which is 
the harder teaching position, in the grades or the high school ?
-P-A-G-E-32
  18 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
4. Think over the list of teachers you know, or visit a number of 
rooms and try to determine the degree to which each teacher has 
come to realize that he should treat the subject-matter he teaches as 
a means and \not an end. 
5. Examine some of the “methods” or devices used in teaching 
number, language, etc., and try to determine whether they were de- 
vised chiefly with the material or the learner in mind.

  CHAPTER III 
WHAT METHOD IS 
HAT is the nature of method? How is method to 
be determined, and how applied to the work of in- 
struction? What are the criteria by which to judge whether 
a given method is valid or vicious? How may we know 
whether the method we are employing in teaching this sub- 
ject or that is adapted to the work required of it? Is there 
such a thing as a set of guiding principles which we might 
call general method, or are there only special methods, 
whose number and variety must be as great as the different 
fields of instruction? Can I learn to develop good method 
for all the subjects I teach—and how? Some of those ques- 
tions can be answered tentatively at once, and others must 
await the outcome of our entire discussion. 
The Nature of Method 
The word method as employed in education has ordinarily 
been given a much narrower meaning than will be adopted 
in our present study. It has often been limited to a discus- 
sion of the presentation of subject-matter in the recitation, 
together with whatever prediminary organization of the mat- 
ter was required for this purpose. . Not infrequently the 
term method has been applied to mere devices—temporary 
expedients employed to catch the interest, appeal to the 
spirit of competition, or otherwise narrowly affect some one 
situation or power. 
The four factors in method.—Manifestly such a con- 
19
-P-A-G-E-34
20 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND At, ‘ 
ception of method is too narrow to ad: it of a formulation 
of its foundation principles. In the meaning that we shall 
employ, method deals not with presentation in the recitation 
alone, but includes the whole problem involved in facilitating 
learning. It begins with the fundamental question of the pur- 
pose of our instruction—the why. It investigates the most 
favorable subject-matter for the accomplishment of this 
purpose—the what. It then inquires how best to organize 
such material for instruction; and finally considers how to 
present the chosen material in order to attain the desired 
end—the how. 
Method in this broad sense, therefore, springs from four 
roots, or in another figure, it rests on a fourfold founda- 
tion: (1) the aim, or function, of the subject-matter, de- 
fined in terms of the results sought in the development of 
the child; (2) the material to be selected with reference to 
this aim and placed before the learner for his mastery; 
(3) the preparing, or organizing, of the subject-matter to 
adapt it to the mind of the child; and (4) the technique of 
instruction, or presentation. Let us see how each of these 
is related to the others, and how all combine to determine 
method. 
The Part Played by a Definite Aim 
Our whole scheme of education probably suffers more 
from lack of a definite aim than from any other one defect. 
This is certainly true of our teaching. You may teach your 
grammar or I my geometry without knowing what we par- 
ticularly expect to accomplish through them in the training 
of the child; hence we shall not know whether we have 
finally accomplished the right thing or not. We may go 
through the process of instruction without having con- 
sciously aimed at any definite goal, so we shall have no way  
-P-A-G-E-35
WHAT METHOD IS \ 21 
of telling whether we have reached any goal worth attain- 
ing. In such teaching the saving quality of purpose is ab- 
sent. It can succeed only by accident. It lacks method. 
Aim sets the goal—The first question, then, in the 
formulation of method in any field is that of the aim, or 
function, of the subject. If, as we saw in the first chapter, 
each subject of the curriculum is an instrument with which 
to work on certain powers and capacities of the learner, the 
necessity of determining what powers and capacities are to 
be acted on and how they are to be affected is obvious. The 
ability to set up an aim and select means for its attainment 
is fundamental to successful achievement in any line of 
action. He who can not conceive an aim to be reached 
through his endeavor works blindly and by chance. He has 
no way of knowing whether he is employing the right means 
or instruments. He can not judge the success of his en- 
deavors or estimate the value of the processes’ employed. 
‘He is like a man groping in the dark for a prize, the very 
nature and location of which he does not know. 
Aim determines the material to be used.—Until we 
have a clear conception of the aim of education, and what 
it should do for its possessor, we shall be unable to deter- 
mine whether we are employing the best subject-matter for 
the accomplishing of the end sought; nor can we safely de- 
cide whether the type of instruction we adopt is successful 
or not. More specifically, unless we know the function or 
aim of the geography, Latin, or literature we teach, that is, 
unless we know what abilities and tendencies these subjects 
are intended to stimulate and direct in the child, we can not 
determine what geography, what science, what Latin, or 
what literature to teach for this purpose ; nor can we decide 
on their best organization for instruction and their most 
effective mode of presentation. 
To express this truth by an analogy. Suppose I am an
-P-A-G-E-36
a 
  
jee CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
expert architect, and you ask me to specify the material that 
should be used in a structure the building of which you 
have in mind. It is clear that I shall be unable to advise you 
until I know the purpose of your structure. If the building 
is to be used for purposes of exhibition and show without 
any idea of permanence, strength or long-continued useful- 
ness, I will specify one kind of material. If, on the other 
hand, this building is to stand for a long period of time, if 
it is to endure as a stately example of the permanence and 
value of religion or patriotism, if it is to withstand the 
stress of daily use and much service, then I must advise an 
‘ entirely different kind of material. So also with the method, 
or process, of the building of your structure. One class of 
building activity or workmanship would serve for a tempo- 
rary structure intended only for display, while an altogether 
different method would be required for a structure designed 
to serve for centuries of steady use. 
Aim and the structure of education—Applying the 
analogy somewhat more closely to education, suppose you 
ask me what subject-matter one should study. If I con- 
ceive that the aim of education is merely to polish, if it is 
to supply a temporary veneer, if it is to train a narrow set 
of mental abilities to a high degree of skill, then the material 
used may be of the kind that will yield polish, veneer, or the 
sharpening of wits. If, on the other hand, I believe that 
education is to prepare for the day’s life, with all the stresses 
and strains of its work or its play, if it is to help in meeting 
the problems and responsibilities hourly thrust upon one in 
the thick of social process about us, if it is to fit us into our 
niche in life as a fruitful participant in the activities of our 
day, then I shall advise that the material built into our edu- 
cational structure shall be adapted to this end and not to the 
other. Jt is all a matter of aim, or purpose.
-P-A-G-E-37
  WHAT METHOD IS | 23 
The Material of Education Must Be Suited to the Aim 
Not only must aim determine the material, but the mate- 
rial must be specifically adapted to the aim desired. When 
the great public schools of England set up as their aim the 
training of an English gentleman, they do not offer a cur- 
riculum of industrial, commercial or technological subjects ; 
for their outcome would contradict the English ideal of a 
gentleman. When Germany fixes her aim at producing the 
.most highly skilled technical workers, the subject-matter 
taught in the schools devoted to this end is calculated to 
train to technological pursuits. Our schools can not accom- 
plish the aim of preparing for industrial pursuits if the cur- 
riculum contains material adapted chiefly to commercial or 
professional careers. Education can not prepare for the 
problems and stress of the day’s living if the material 
studied bears no relation to such problems. We must put 
into the hopper what we desire to carry away from the mill. 
More definitely, the purpose to be achieved by the teach- 
ing of arithmetic, history or botany can not be reached ex- 
cept by selecting for these branches the material suited to 
the aim conceived. It is futile to say that the study of arith- 
metic must result in facility and accuracy in the common 
computations needed in the home, on the farm or in the 
shop, and then give the child highly complex, theoretical and 
unreal problems to solve, while omitting those that relate to 
home, farm and shop. If the aim of history is a knowledge 
of one’s country, loyalty to its welfare and a sense of kin- 
ship with the great men and women of other times, we must 
give the youth who studies history more than a list of dry 
dates, unimportant events, and tedious military campaigns 
for his reading. And so with every other subject. The  
-P-A-G-E-38
24 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
material and the aim must go hand in hand. But more of 
this later. i f 
Instruction Must Fit Aim and Material 
The same line of reasoning holds for the remaining fac- 
tors in method, the organization and presentation of mate- 
rial in the recitation. Once the aim and the material are 
decided on, the remaining question of method turns on how 
to arrange and present the chosen material to accomplish the 
desired aim. The most fruitful subject-matter may be ren- 
dered dead and useless and the most important aim made 
futile through poor technique in instruction. 
Technique of instruction must be adapted to aim.—Aim 
therefore determines the method of the recitation. If I am 
to determine the best manner of organizing and presenting 
the material for a given recitation, I must know the end 
sought through this recitation. If it is to ground the class 
permanently in certain fundamentals, a wholly different 
method will be required from that calculated to display the 
brightness and quickness of the class to chance visitors. If 
the aim is to catch the fleeting interest, tickle the fancy, or 
feed the egotism of the pupils, one type of recitation will 
serve; but if the purpose is to develop independence and 
originality, cultivate careful thinking and exact expression, 
or otherwise encourage the more serious side of develop- 
ment, then a different recitation method is required. Again 
the question is one of selecting the right means to attain our 
aim. We shall need to look a little more closely into aim as 
the controlling factor in education. 
Determining the Educational Aim 
We have seen that the aim of education must determine 
both its subject-matter and the method of instruction. But
-P-A-G-E-39
  WHAT METHOD IS 25 
what determines the aim of education? How are we to 
know when we have fixed on the right aim for education in 
general or for any subject or field in particular? When is a 
person to be called educated, and by what means does he 
arrive at this state? Just what do we seek to do to or for 
him through his education? There have been plenty of dog- 
matic answers given to our questions, but most of them are 
not convincing. 
Of this much, however, we may be sure at the start: The 
aim of education as a whole must set the aim for each sub- 
ject or branch. Whatever the whole of one’s education 
seeks to accomplish, the language, arithmetic or science he 
studies must do its part to attain. There is no place for the 
useless or obsolete. The whole must include the parts, and 
the parts together must make up the whole. 
Conflicting aims in education—There has been much 
controversy and little agreement as to the central aim of 
education. It does not fall within the scope of this work to 
enter into any extended discussion of the controversy, yet 
a brief statement of the points at issue is necessary. Two 
quite distinct ideals have been advanced as the end of edu- 
cation, the terms most commonly used to express each being 
culture and utility, respectively. One reason for the dis- 
agreement of the adherents of these two ideals is that 
neither culture nor utility has been, or perhaps can be, 
sharply defined so that one may know precisely what is 
meant by the terms. Further confusion is created by the 
fact that the meaning of the two terms has come to overlap. 
All culture as conceived in modern times contains many 
elements of utility; and utility, especially under our demo- 
cratic ideals of life, is by no means devoid of culture. ; 
The older culture ideal as the aim of education arose be- 
fore the days of democracy. It has its roots in an aristo- “ 
cratic civilization. The educated man was not to serve; he
-P-A-G-E-40
  26 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
was to be served by those lower than himself in station. H+ 
was not to work, but be worked for. Training that would 
prepare for service was only for servants. Education that 
would make one a better worker was only for the unfor- 
tunate man who was obliged to labor. Hence the “cultured” 
aristocratic would have nothing of the practical or utilitarian 
in his education, as he feared it would class him with the 
despised masses. Culture and practical utility were as far 
apart as the poles. This traditional view of culture still ob- 
tains in no small degree, but it is giving way before the 
democratic ideals that dignify labor and almost ‘deify 
service. 
The newer definition of culture—Culture must remain 
a chief aim in our education, but its definition is being radi- 
cally changed. The culture of the future will not be mere 
polish, nor discipline of the powers and abilities without 
any reference to the part they are to play in actual affairs. 
The newer culture will include (1) a spirit of artistry in 
work and achievement. It will not call that man cultured 
who is satisfied with low-grade or mediocre performance, 
no matter what be the line of his occupation. 
The new cultural ideal will involve (2) a spirit of social 
good will and service. Under its inspiration education will 
not be looked on as a means of securing selfish advantage 
at the expense of others. On the contrary, it will consider 
education as the means of opening the way to greater serv- 
ice for one’s fellows while attaining the highest satisfaction 
and success for himself. 
The newer culture will (3) develop a capacity for fine 
appreciations in a wide range of contacts and experiences. 
One’s training will lead him to value the beauty and good- 
ness of the world about him, and to take pleasure and satis- 
faction in their appeal to his life. 
Culture under its newer definition will (4) result in put-
-P-A-G-E-41
WHAT METHOD IS 27 
ting into the possession of its possessor a large fund of inner 
resources that will yield satisfaction and enjoyment. The 
trained mind; the well-stocked memory; the warm imagery 
of people, places and events; the knowledge of one’s world; 
and the sense of worthy destiny accomplished are typical of 
these personal resources. 
Culture and utility—From the foregoing point of view 
there is no real conflict between culture and utility. It is 
true that the term “utility” has meant chiefly the narrower 
practical abilities such as are directly used in the every-day 
affairs of life, more especially such as are employed in the 
economic or bread-and-butter activities. But the concept of 
utility is also growing broader and richer, like that of 
culture. 
The advocates of utility as the outcome of education at- 
tach great importance to the subject-matter employed. Their 
insistence is for content studies as against formal studies. 
They are not indifferent to culture, but believe that culture 
will result from studies that are directly related to every- 
day interests and affairs as well as from those that have no 
direct bearing on real life and experience. 
The efficiency aim.—Happily for our present discus- 
sion we do not need to take sides in this ancient controversy 
between culture and utility. The more recently developed 
social aim of education includes the best from both of the 
older ideals and smooths out the sharp points of conflict 
between them. i 
Under the social ideal, the aim of education is conceived 
as fitting one into the social activities of his day—not only 
stimulating certain powers and abilities, but setting them at 
work in the carrying out of the individual’s responsibility to 
himself and society. Whatever accomplishes this is educa- 
tion. Whatever fails to do it can not be classified as educa- 
tion. Whatever fits one effectively into the process, the day’s
-P-A-G-E-42

; 
work and its play, will of necessity possess a large measure 
of culture—of those qualities that satisfy the self and please 
and serve others. And whatever does this will also possess 
the highest degree of utility. Thus the demands of the con- 
troverted aims of education are both met in the newer con- 
cept. In our further discussion we shall therefore accept 
the social aim of education as defining the aim of each sub- 
ject and branch of the curriculum. Education must prepare 
for social efficiency, and every subject taught must con- 
tribute its share to this end. 
Terms in Which the Educational Aim May be Expressed 
When we say that the aim of education is to prepare the 
individual for the social activities of his time we have, after 
all, a very general expression. What is meant by preparing 
the individual for the social activities, how is he to be fitted 
into them, and finally, how is education to accomplish this 
adjustment ? 
In answering our question let us first ask another: What 
does the person who to-day seeks to take his part in the life 
going on about him require in the way of preparation? 
What is demanded of him as he assumes the duties of home, 
state, church, community and vocation? What are the at- 
tributes, or qualities, he needs as he goes out to meet the 
day’s duties as a participant in the world’s work and its 
play? ; ‘ 
Three fundamental requirements of education.—Every 
*individual requires (1) certain lines of knowledge; (2) 
certain attitudes, ideals, standards and interests; and 
(3) certain skills, or the application of knowledge and 
attitudes to the use of his powers. It is therefore the busi- 
ness of education to see that the individual is not lacking in 
essential knowledge, the fundamental attitudes toward life
-P-A-G-E-43
WHAT METHOD IS 29 
and society, or in the ability to put his powers successfully 
at work. Every separate subject or branch of the curricu- 
lum must bear its responsibility in yielding its particular 
contribution to the knowledge, attitudes and skills required. 
The knowledge requirement—One must know his 
world. Only through knowledge does power come. It is 
not enough that one shall have high ambitions, noble feel- 
ing, and the will to achieve. He must have a mastery of 
the facts to be met with and their relations to one another 
and to himself. Lacking this knowledge he is a ship without 
a rudder driven helpless by every gale and current encoun- 
tered. Ignorance of one’s world always means weakness 
and inefficiency. It is sure to spell defeat. 
To be still more specific in our analysis: What knowledge 
is most required by one who is to live broadly himself and 
contribute his share to the social welfare? The field of 
knowledge is well-nigh endless, and no one person can hope 
to master more than a small fraction of the whole. We 
must therefore carefully select within the field of knowl- 
edge. | 
Knowledge of most worth.—It will of course be im- 
possible to answer in detail just what knowledge is of most 
worth in education. Spencer attempted this years ago, and 
many others have tried it before and since. Yet an impor- 
tant underlying principle is becoming increasingly clear: 
The knowledge supplied by education must be fruitful. By 
being fruitful, we mean that it must have the most vital and 
concrete bearing possible at important points of actual ex- 
perience in the social activities. There can be no “knowl- 
edge for its own sake.” Knowledge has grown up bit by 
bit out of the needs and crises of human experience, and its 
great function is to lead its possessor to-day back to a more 
fruitful and valuable experience. This aim of education 
does not, therefore, consist in the mere appropriation of 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  ; { : P 
30 ee METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
; 
knowledge, any knowledge, but in the mastery of the knowl- 
edge that will function in the business of living, that will 
shape conduct, that will direct effort, and that will insure 
achievement. 
Knowledge that has no relation to duties, problems and 
responsibilities, knowledge calculated to result only in the 
training of powers that have no point of contact with actual 
experience, or knowledge meant to contribute but a surface 
polish or veneer without substantial foundation of true 
worth may well give way in the process of education to 
more vital and fruitful knowledge. The rigid application of 
this principle to our school curriculum would beyond ques- 
tion result in a radical modification of much of its material. 
There are many signs that the application and consequent 
modification are getting under way. 
The training of attitudes.—Altitudes, ideals, standards 
and interests are no less important a part of education than 
knowledge. For one’s attitudes and ideals constitute a 
background to his life which modifies and colors all other 
values. They act as a matrix out of which the impulses to 
activity and conduct spring. They serve as stimuli and 
guides, directing effort and leading to achievement. In 
short, attitudes are the great motive sources of conduct. 
The significance of attitudes and interests is readily un- 
derstood by the teacher who has had to do with pupils whose 
attitude toward school or toward particular studies was bad. 
Indifference, lack of interest, low ideals, or any kind of hos- 
tility is an effective bar to effort and accomplishment in 
every phase of school work. 
The practical value of attitudes—In similar manner 
may we press the importance of attitudes toward the larger 
questions of life and vocation. Chesterton says that the 
most important question about any man is the “kind of 
    
-P-A-G-E-45
WHAT METHOD IS 31 
philosophy he keeps”—the manner in which he looks out on 
the opportunities and responsibilities that confront him. 
Every person develops some sort of philosophy of life, 
some standards of value by which he judges what is most 
worth while as an end toward which to apply his energies 
and direct his efforts. That most people are unconscious of 
having possessed themselves of such a life philosophy does 
not detract in the least from its importance and influence. 
Their points of view, standards of value, and ideals are 
nevertheless at work in their choice of vocation, determin- 
ing the quality of their citizenship, deciding the value of 
their relations as members of homes, churches or commu- 
nities, and otherwise conditioning the outcome of their life 
and experience. 
The importance of the attitude phase of education has 
not yet been fully recognized. Knowledge has been the 
chief, if not the sole, criterion of education in the minds of 
many. True, we have come to realize more or less clearly - 
that to equip an individual with knowledge and at the same 
time leave him with an attitude of rebellion against the 
moral order and of hostility toward society falls far short 
of accomplishing the end of education, and but leaves us 
with a potential criminal on our hands. We have not, how- 
ever, applied this principle broadly in our education. In an 
industrial nation and an industrial age we find that our 
schools have served to lead away from, rather than toward, 
industrial occupations. The result has been a surplus of 
workers in professional and mercantile vocations, and a 
shortage of skilled artisans. We have not yet come to real- 
ize that the attitude developed toward great lines of culture 
from their study—history, science, literature—is much more 
important than the modicum of knowledge gained. The 
attitudes and ideals created concerning the values to be
-P-A-G-E-46
o2. CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT ; e 
striven for in vocation and avocation, and in the relations 
of home and state and church are of supreme importance 
in education. 
Skills as an aim in education.—Finally, with reference 
to skills, or control, as an end in education. Fruitful knowl- 
edge and good attitudes should eventuate in deeds and 
achievement. Otherwise they have no significance in a 
practical world of affairs. One should not only develop his 
powers but secure control over them. He must not only be 
able to think and feel, but also to do. To be a successful 
participant in the activities of his times one must possess 
various skills. He must be able to direct trained capacities 
to fruitful effort. : 
This means that one must not only possess fruitful knowl- 
edge, but that this knowledge shall be so organized and ap- 
plied that it brings results. One not only needs to develop 
strong muscles and steady nerves, but to have these trained 
to sure and ready response in worthy directions. He not only 
must know the right and the wrong in the moral order, but 
have such control over the self as to be able to choose the 
right and turn from the wrong under the stress of tempta- 
tion. He must not only possess knowledge of the social 
order and a right attitude toward social problems, but have 
the skill to do his part in bringing about social progress and 
needed reform. In short, education must include as its aim 
the development of skills, or the ability to do, equally with 
the attainment of knowledge and the creation of right atti- 
tudes and ideals. : 
The following three chapters will be given to a further 
elaboration of the knowledge aim, the attitudes aim and the 
skills aim of education. 
In consideration of the point of view presented in this 
chapter we shall, then, look on method as beginning with
-P-A-G-E-47
WHAT METHOD IS , 33 
the question of the aim or purpose to be attained through 
what we teach in the education of the child. We must then 
inquire what particular material or subject-matter will best 
attain this aim. We must finally ask what technique of 
instruction will best use the material selected for the aim 
set forth. 
The newly conceived aim of education is social efficiency, 
which only means living the strongest, happiest and most 
useful life here and now. The attainment of this aim in- 
cludes (1) the acquisition of fruitful as contrasted with 
useless knowledge; (2) the development. of right attitudes, 
interests, ideals, habits, or the attainment of a true sense of 
life values; and (3) the training of a reasonably wide range 
of skills, the creation of a capacity for control and achieve- 
ment. All the subjects we teach must present such material 
"and be guided by such methods of instruction that they do 
their part toward accomplishing these aims. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1, This chapter should prompt each of us to a little self-examin- 
ation on the question of the definiteness of our teaching. Suppose 
you try to write down a specific statement of the aims to be accom- 
plished through several of the branches you are teaching. 
2. Next, examine with care the material you present in the sev- 
eral subjects with the purpose of discovering whether ‘it is adapted 
to the aim you seek through each subject. If not, where is the dif- 
ficulty, and what the remedy? 
3. Think over your methods of instruction, and decide whether 
they are as well adapted as you can make them to accomplishing the 
aim you seek through your teaching of the different subjects. If 
not, keep your mind alert throughout the text for suggestions to help 
in the improving of your methods. 
4. Contrast in your thought education as a mere accomplishment 
and education as the means to efficiency. Which is the truer ideal? 
What difference will it make in your teaching whether you hold one 
view or the other? 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
34 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
5. After studying the paragraphs on the newer definition of cul- 
ture, try formulating your own definition of culture. Remember 
that a true definition is often but a plan of action, or a goal to be 
achieved. Will you then shape your teaching to develop this type of 
culture in your pupils? 
6. Try harmonizing the two conflicting ideals of education, 
culture and utility, and show that, under the newer definition of 
each term, the two unite in what we may call social efficiency.
-P-A-G-E-49
CHAPTER IV 
THE KNOWLEDGE SIDE OF EDUCATION 
HAT does the educated person of to-day need to 
know? We have taken the ground that the aim of 
education is social efficiency, and not the training of any 
mythical set of “faculties” nor the appropriating of any 
particular body of knowledge approved only by tradition or 
convention. 
The part played by knowledge.—It necessarily fol- 
lows, then, that the knowledge supplied through education 
~ must directly and in no doubtful or uncertain way lead to 
these aims. One must know his world, with the emphasis 
on his. He must know the fundamental facts that underlie 
participation in his world’s work. He must know the sig- 
nificant facts governing his relations as a member of a 
family, a community, a nation. He must know the vital 
facts concerning the world of physical nature and of self. 
This is all to say that the knowledge offered the child for 
his mastery is to be selected for its concrete application to 
the problems and duties of the daily life which he is to live 
—which he is living here and now. 
True, we do not know just what the daily life of each of 
our pupils is to be; much less do we know in detail the spe- 
cial problems that each will meet. Can we then decide what 
phases of knowledge will be needed by the individual ? 
Education to supply the fundamental knowledge.— 
The answer to our question must be that we can not know 
in advance just what specific phases of knowledge each per- 
35 
 
-P-A-G-E-50

| an 36 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGE: NT 
son will most need in his social activities. Life is too great 
a complex, and the lines of knowledge too diverse for this 
to be possible; but neither is it necessary for the funda- 
mentals of education that the whole life experience shall 
be known. For what the individual needs from his school 
education is not to master all the details of the knowl- 
edge later to be demanded of him. It is rather to lay 
deep and strong the broader foundations which every per- 
son will require, no matter what his vocation or status is to 
be. With this done, and with right attitudes, interests and 
habits developed, and with skill attained in the use of one’s 
powers, the details of the l:1owledge demanded in daily 
activities will be secured as the need arises. But this 
foundation knowledge must be vital, and must belong to the 
world of present experience, else it tends to divorce educa- 
tion from life. 
We can at least avoid Spencer’s criticism that we train 
our children’s minds as we clothe their bodies—in the pre- 
vailing fashion; we can refuse to teach fruitless matter 
though it be called good form to learn it. We can cease to 
furnish grounds for Flexner’s claim that “the subjects com- 
monly taught, the time at which they are taught, the manner 
in which they are taught, and the amounts taught are de- 
termined by tradition:” We can omit from the child’s edu- 
cation such phases of knowledge as may once have pos- 
sessed educational value but which are now obsolete and 
useless. 
The fundamentals of knowledge required by those who 
would live a reasonably full life and do their part in the 
present social process may be roughly classified in certain 
broad groups: knowledge (1) of tools, or symbols; (2) of 
self; (3) of physical nature; (4) of human nature; (5)   
  
1 Flexner, 4 Modern School, p. 5.
-P-A-G-E-51
  ‘ THE KNOWLEDGE SIDE OF EDUCATION 37 
of history and institutions; (6) of industry, science and in- 
vention ; (7) of expression; (8) of avocations. 
Knowledge of Tools, or Symbols 
Essential to all other learning is a knowledge of cer- 
tain symbols, or essential tools, and skill in their use. The 
“three R’s,” which once were looked on as constituting a 
fair education, are still the basis of all education. The abil- 
ity to read, write, spell and number, while no longer an ade- 
quate measure of education, is a necessary preliminary to 
all that may follow. 
Fundamentals must not be neglected.—No greater mis- 
take can be made in any system of education, either as ap- 
plied to an individual or a nation, than to slight these 
fundamentals. That we are, on the whole, failing to ground 
our children in the basic forms of knowledge, there can be 
little doubt. Every experienced teacher knows what it is 
to try to teach children the more advanced sections of a 
subject when they lack knowledge of. the more elementary 
phases. Pupils often fail of the best results in history, 
geography, civics or science because they can not intelli- 
gently read the text. They are unable to solve problems in 
practical measurements in arithmetic because they do not 
know fractions. They fail in percentage problems because 
they do not know the decimal system. They can solve rather 
difficult problems from a text, especially if they know the 
“cases” under which they come, but can not work relatively 
simple and practical problems met in actual experience. 
They are at a loss in the more advanced phases of language. 
study because they have not mastered the elements, and 
so on. 
It pays in any line of building to make the foundation  
-P-A-G-E-52

38 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT } 
strong before we attempt to rear the superstructure upon it. 
Failure to do this is probably our weakest point in eleme1- 
tary education. Much saving of waste in education—waste 
in time, interest, effort, money and efficiency—could be ac- 
complished by the application of this simple principle. We 
can not emphasize too strongly that a thorough knowledge 
and ready skill in the tools of knowledge are the first requi- 
site in education. 
Fundamentals to be made second nature.—This re- 
quirement sets the aim therefore of the elementary grades. 
As the knowledge needed in these stages of development 
is being secured, a knowledge of the fundamentals must 
not be omitted. Drill and practise must go on until the 
reading, the spelling of words commonly used, writing, 
punctuating and the elementary number processes become 
automatic. Knowledge of these things must be made 
second nature, so that thought, judgment or memory ar7 
not consciously required, but left free to deal with mean- 
ings and values of higher order. This does not in any 
degree mean that the drill on these fundamentals shall be 
devoid of content. It does not mean that the child shall 
not be taught to think. It does not mean that his inter- 
ests shall be neglected. It only means that while taking 
care of these things, a ready and certain mastery of the 
fundamental tools will be assured. 
Knowledge of the Self 
Every person should secure through his education cer- 
tain knowledge of self. Nor is this self to be conceived as 
some mythical, intangible entity of doubtful reality and 
more or less incomprehensible qualities. By the self is 
meant first the physical organism and then the mental and 
social powers that use the brain as their machine.
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE KNOWLEDGE SIDE OF EDUCATION 39 
Knowledge of the physical self—One should under- 
stand the marvelous, delicately adjusted and complex mech- 
anism that we call the body. The laws of health and devel- 
opment should be of primary consideration. The factors 
involved in growth, strength, physical efficiency and longev- 
ity should be thoroughly comprehended. An understanding 
of the rules governing food, exercise, sleep, fatigue and rest 
should be fully within the grasp of each person. The effects 
of physical habits should be understood, and the influence 
of narcotics and stimulants upon physical efficiency, health 
and success should be a fundamental part of the education. 
When the proper time has arrived, knowledge of the mys- 
tery and laws of sex should be put into the possession of 
every youth, and particularly should this line of information 
extend to the influence of sex habits and their power for 
good or evil in the life. 
Knowledge of the mental self—Upon the mental side 
the self is no less real and understandable, even if less tan- 
gible, than the physical. While the technical facts and laws 
of psychology are beyond the grasp and comprehension of 
a majority of those who attend the elementary school, yet 
certain of the simpler facts which relate to the mental life 
should constitute a part of the education of all children. 
They may easily come to know some of the effects of mental 
habits. They can understand the origin and influence of 
moods. They can grasp the facts involved in the develop- 
ment of disposition. They may come to know the folly and 
uselessness of worry and its crippling effect upon happiness 
and efficiency. They may be taught methods of work which 
will economize effort, nerve strain and fatigue. They may 
know the principles underlying the capacity for concentra- 
tion and realize the futility of mental work unaccompanied 
by a high degree of mental pressure. 
Knowledge of the social self—So also with knowl- 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
40 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
edge of social forms and usages. Society has developed 
certain usages which every person needs to know and obey. 
Good breeding is a commercial as well as a social asset. 
Ability to meet people easily and with grace and dignity is 
one of the surest marks of true education. Every child has 
a right to such knowledge and training, which will in part 
come from the home, but which in many cases, because of 
the limitations of the home, must be given chiefly in the 
school. : 
Knowledge of Physical Nature 
Knowledge of physical nature constitutes an essential part 
of modern education. In the elementary grades this knowl- 
edge will, of course, take the form of undifferentiated sci- 
ence, or information about the immediate physical environ- 
ment, while in the high school the separate sciences will 
form distinct branches of study. 
Education to include knowledge of physical environ- 
ment.—A knowledge of the earth we live on, its rivers, 
hills, mountains, valleys and lakes, its different soils and, 
climates and their products should be included in the mental 
acquisition of all intelligent persons. Information should 
be acquired as to common plant life, first of all that which 
lies nearest at hand and is daily to be met, used and appre- 
ciated. At least a general knowledge should be had of the 
chief plants supplying our food, clothing and other articles 
of comfort, necessity or luxury connected with our lives. 
No education of present times is well balanced which does 
not include some practical knowledge of the animal life of 
the earth. Here again that which is nearest at hand, either 
from the point of view of location or as to interest and im- 
portance should receive first attention. Then forms of ani- 
mal life that are farther away but which have some relation
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE KNOWLEDGE SIDE OF EDUCATION 41 
to the life or activities of our civilization should come within 
the ken of the learner. 
The educated person will also extend his knowledge to 
include an understanding of the forces and forms of physi- 
cal energy which have to do with our world. Their laws 
should be mastered and the methods by which they are ap- 
plied to carrying on the world’s work, its industries and 
activities should be understood. Finally because one is con- 
fronted by the fact of a vast universe extending beyond the 
realms of our own earth one should have at least some com- 
prehension of the worlds beyond our own. 
Knowledge of Human Nature 
Because every individual lives in a social medium and is 
daily and hourly in contact with human nature, a knowl- 
edge of the most fundamental qualities that enter into the 
make-up of a human being should be well understood. 
Knowledge of people—We must constantly adjust 
ourselves to others, live with them, obey or control them, 
teach them, buy from them, sell to them, or in a thousand 
ways fit our lives to theirs. On one’s ability to judge other 
people, adapt himself to them and work with them much of 
his success will depend. The great qualities which go to 
make up a fine personality, and on the other hand the nega- 
tive qualities which lead to weakness and rob one of power 
and influence should be recognized. 
Not only in this rather general and abstract fashion 
should one come to know human nature, but also from the 
study of ideal characters as found in literature and biog- 
raphy. The literary writer, unhampered by the limitations 
or weaknesses of any particular individual, is at liberty to 
endow an imaginary character with all of the graces that 
enter into human nature. On the other hand, he may also
-P-A-G-E-56
    | j

42 cLass-n00x METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
apply to one individual all of the vices to be found, not in 
any one person, but in many. In such way, may we catch 
a vision for our own lives, learn to shun our baser tend- 
encies, 
One should also come to know human nature through a 
study of the real historical personages presented to us in 
the descriptive pages of history and biography. In this way 
we come to know human nature in action, busied with the 
real deeds and achievements of civilization. The qualities 
of personality are not, as in literature, found in an ideal or 
imaginary setting, but actually at work as vital forces in the 
real world of action. 
Developing the sense of racial kinship—The value and 
stimulus of such knowledge as this for the young can hardly 
be overestimated. From the study of human nature and the 
inter-relations of individuals and generations there should 
come to the youth a sense of human kinship. He should 
come to feel not only that he is a part of the present genera- 
tion with its opportunities and duties, but also a part of the 
great chain of life that began at the beginning and.will go 
on until the end. Nothing could be more broadening, en- 
lightening and stimulating than this sense of racial kinship 
and achievement. 
Knowledge of Social Institutions 
Each of us lives and moves and has his being in a social 
medium. We are members of a group of social institutions, 
each with its own aims, ideals and methods of procedure. 
Indeed the life of the race can largely be defined in terms 
of social institutions which peoples and nations have 
evolved. The place of a people or nation in history can 
be judged from its institutions. It is a part of education,
-P-A-G-E-57
\ 
THE KNOWLEDGE SIDE OF EDUCATION 43 
therefore, to know the origin of each of the great social 
institutions and something of its history and development. 
Knowledge of the home.—Every youth should have 
some definite information as to the nature and meaning of 
the family and home, and comprehend the part played by 
the family unit both in history and in the economic and 
social organizations of the present. The value and sacred- 
ness of the home relations should be fully realized. This 
knowledge should result in greater love for the home, 
greater loyalty to its relations, and pride in its good name. 
Knowledge of the state-—Likewise should one come 
to know the meaning of the state. He should grasp the sig- 
nificance of government and its function in securing equal 
- justice and opportunity for all under its sway. The mean- 
ing of government should extend not only to the negative 
functions of restraint and control, but to the positive func- 
tion of carrying out great projects such as education and 
many lines of public service for the good of society. The 
meaning of citizenship and its requirements should grow 
out of this fundamental information and the sentiment of 
patriotism become well developed. In such study should 
the sense of personal citizenship arise, and the realization 
of civic responsibility have its grounding. 
Knowledge of religion—The church as one of the 
leading social institutions should likewise come in for con- 
- sideration in present-day education. This does not mean 
that the individual should be educated in narrow sectarian 
fashion, but rather should grow to realize the part that re- ~ 
ligion and the church have played in social and individual 
development. In similar fashion should the school be 
brought to the attention of the youth who constitute its 
present-day membership. One who has come to see the 
price paid in sacrifice, toil and suffering for the earlier 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  ; ‘ 
+ 
44 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
schools, and the immense amount of funds to-day devoted 
to education can hardly look on education and schools as 
an imposition instead of an opportunity, as not a few pupils 
of to-day do. — 
Knowledge of social conventions.—Finally, as previ- 
ously mentioned, every youth should come to a knowledge 
of the social conventions, or rules, which have been devel- 
oped through the generations and to-day express the aggre- 
gate wisdom of society with reference to social behavior and 
conduct. It is not uncommon to find those who are impa- 
tient of the restraint of social conventions and look on them 
as narrow, old-fashioned and unnecessary in this later day. 
All such will be rendered more patient and more wise by 
being brought to a realization that social conventions ex- 
press the collective judgment of society, and are not the 
invention or petty whim of any one individual or generation. 
Once the individual has grasped this fact he will hardly 
feel like setting up his own judgment against the wisdom of 
society accumulated through the years. He will understand 
that social standing requires obedience to the customs and 
tules dictated by good breeding, whether in the home, in 
social groups, or in the association of the sexes with each 
other. 
Knowledge of History 
Education should include knowledge of history, local, 
national and general. It is a part of common intelligence 
to know something of the historical development of one’s 
locality, state and nation. Not only should we know the 
political and military history of our people, but also the 
social and industrial achievements of our nation. We should 
be able to define our chief national ideals and know how 
our nation differs from other nations. We should realize
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE KNOWLEDGE SIDE OF EDUCATION 45 
something of the debt we owe to society because of the toil, 
sacrifice and suffering of preceding generations who have 
left us the heritage of civilization and opportunity which 
we enjoy. We should'come to see the working of cause 
and effect in the production of wars and other crises, know 
the great problems which now confront our country, and be 
able to apply every lesson of the past to their solution. 
Scope of historical knowledge.—Our historical knowl- 
edge should also extend to other nations and times, else we 
shall have little historical perspective and therefore be un- 
able to judge social values aright. The origin, growth and 
particular type of civilization characterizing each of the 
great nations should be comprehended. We should know 
their national, social and political ideals, together with how 
these have come about. Such great concepts as freedom, 
democracy, universal education and religious liberty should 
be studied and the individual come to know the course of 
the development of each of these great ideals in the life of 
peoples, and the part they play in our present national ideal. 
Knowledge of Industry, Science and Invention 
The industrial and commercial activities form so large a 
part of life and are so fundamental to all human welfare 
and progress that a knowledge of their processes should 
form an important part of education. The industries which 
supply our clothing, give us our food, and build and furnish 
our homes especially appeal to the interest of children. 
Here also is an excellent place to lay the foundation for a 
later understanding of the structure and relationships of 
society in the broader sense. 
Knowledge of vocations——Man was made to work, 
and finds his greatest satisfaction and highest development 
only in some vocation. A knowledge, therefore, of the
-P-A-G-E-60
46 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 1 
fundamental requirements of vocational activities rightly 
constitutes part of every person’s education. It is true that 
technical vocational knowledge and skill can be supplied 
only in special schools, but a general education may include 
the fundamentals. 
Further, each individual should have such a knowledge of 
the requirements placed on one who enters a given vocation 
that he will know whether this vocation is adapted to his 
tastes and aptitudes. He should also know something of 
the rewards to be expected, the problems, difficulties and 
disappointments to be met in different vocations. His 
knowledge should thereby guide in the selection of his 
vocation. 
Knowing the world of invention and discovery.—It 
goes without saying that in this day of inventions and in- 
dustrial development education will include a broad, even 
if general, knowledge of the scientific inventions and funda- 
mental discoveries that are so constantly being made and 
which so vitally affect human welfare and progress. The 
material side of our civilization is not only wonderful, but 
so closely allied to all spiritual and ideal values, and bears 
such relation to the comfort and luxury of present-day life 
that it should form a very real and practical part of any 
complete education. 
Knowledge of Forms of Expression 
No education can be counted complete or even well ad- 
vanced which does not possess some accurate and usable 
knowledge of the various forms of expression. The world 
little knows and nothing cares concerning the great thoughts 
one may think, the great emotions that may stir his soul, or 
the high ideals that may throb in his heart if he is unable
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE KNOWLEDGE SIDE OF EDUCATION 47 
to express these in some concrete fashion understood by 
others. Such great forms of expression, therefore, as litera- 
ture, art, music, the speech arts and dramatic representation 
should enter into present-day education. 
Chief forms of expression to be learned.—One should 
become familiar with the literary devices of plot, character, 
rhythm, rhyme, etc., and thereby have a foundation of 
knowledge from which to judge literary forms and struc- 
ture. In pictorial and plastic art one should come to know 
the methods employed for bringing out the meaning of the 
picture or statue. He should understand something of com- 
position, light and detail as used in painting and thereby 
have a foundation from which to judge and appreciate 
artistic productions. Similarly in music, the use of melody, 
harmony and the like, employed to express various themes 
should be comprehended. No less should such knowledge 
extend to the speech arts, and should include the principles 
of successful speaking, whether in conversation or in more 
formal public address. In dramatic representation the 
value of the different forms of expression should be simi- 
larly understood. 
Knowledge of Avocations 
Finally, a knowledge of avocations is as necessary as a 
knowledge of vocations. It is as difficult an art to employ 
one’s leisure well as to use his work time fruitfully. Every 
person, therefore, should know something of the function 
of recreation and the various avocations. He should know 
that life can not be all work any more than it can be all 
play. He should learn how to play, and should be able from 
this knowledge to participate in the common games and 
amusements of his social group. This is necessary, not only ~
-P-A-G-E-62
    / | | HRY 
48 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
as it affects one’s social standing and contributes his part to 
the social situation, but also is demanded for our own 
mental, physical and moral good. i 
Need for avocational knowledge—As our national 
wealth grows and the conditions of life become increasingly 
easier, the problem of the use of leisure time becomes more 
and more important. The eight-hour working day leaves a 
number of hours out of the twenty-four to be disposed of. 
To use them fruitfully, so as to build up the physical and 
mental life by worthy recreations, -rather than to weaken it 
by improper forms of amusement, is a problem not yet fully 
mastered. Public parks, municipal recreation centers and 
school playgrounds are praiseworthy attempts to aid in the 
solution of the problem. But the school must also, do its 
part in training to interest and participation in the better 
forms of play, amusements and recreation. For avocations 
are an art, and need to be learned, like vocations. It is en- 
couraging to note that the movement is growing to give avo- 
cations a definite place in the curriculum as has already 
been done in the leading countries of Europe. 
The classification which has been followed in outlining the 
fields of knowledge required in present-day education is in- 
complete and no doubt logically imperfect. It will serve, how- 
ever, to emphasize the scope of knowledge required for living 
in the twentieth-century civilization, and especially in a great 
democracy. .Such knowledge as that suggested is the birth- 
right of all. It does not belong to the few, nor to any par- 
ticular occupation. It is the heritage of humanity, and the 
minimum equipment that should be given our children. 
It is the business of education to deliver these forms of 
knowledge to the child. It is therefore the business of each 
separate subject in the curriculum to contribute its share. 
No one branch can do all, nor may any fail to do a part.
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE KNOWLEDGE SIDE OF EDUCATION 49 
Here again then we meet the demand already stated that 
the teacher shall determine just what phases of this knowl- 
edge his particular subject or subjects shall contribute. 
Once this is discovered it will constitute the knowledge 
aim of his material, and advance him one important step in 
the formulation of good method in his field. 
Summarizing the point of view of the chapter we shall, 
then, look on knowledge as one of the fundamental and 
essential aims of education. But this knowledge must be 
such that it relates to the real and genuine world of the 
learner. Its value shall not be judged by how long it has 
been a part of the school curriculum, nor by its reputation 
in the world of learning, but by its fitness to aid the child 
in meeting actual problems in his life now and in the future. 
Knowledge to be fruitful must help us to understand and 
master otir world. This knowledge can be classified for the 
purposes of our discussion in a few great groups, each of 
which is necessary to an education in our times. The 
teacher, as the first step in developing a method for his sub- 
ject, must decide what phases of the required knowledge is 
to be contributed by this or that particular branch. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Think over the knowledge that you have mastered in the 
course of your education, and estimate the proportion of it which 
seems to have little or no relation to your present needs for knowl- 
edge. 
2. In the light of your own experience estimate the value of the 
knowledge in various subjects which you are teaching your pupils. 
Do you see any necessity for trying to modify or eliminate some of 
it so that what the child is.asked to master will be more fruitful? 
3. Judging from your own experience or observation, do the 
children have a sufficiently thorough knowledge of the fundamentals 
of number, reading and so on? If not, where has been the trouble 
and what is the remedy? :
-P-A-G-E-64
  50 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
i 
4. In how far do you judge that the knowledge of physiology 
‘which you are teaching is bearing fruit in better physical living on 
the part of your pupils? In how far is the knowledge of language 
you teach resulting in better speech? Apply similar tests to the 
other subjects. 
5. First decide whether you agree that all normal children of 
to-day should have reasonable grounding in the phases of knowl- 
edge listed in the chapter. Then carefully estimate the extent to 
which the curriculum of your school, taught as at present, will put 
this knowledge into their possession. If there is any point of dis- 
crepancy, suggest what remedy is needed.
-P-A-G-E-65
  CHAPTER V 
TRAINING TO RIGHT ATTITUDES 
NOWLEDGE is power?—Only when combined with 
right attitudes. The term attitudes is here used, for 
want of a better one, to stand for that group of interests, 
tastes, standards, ideals, enthusiasms, ambitions, desires, 
aversions, appreciations, etc., which serve as the ground- 
work of our lives. Knowledge serves as the rudder that 
guides the ship, but attitudes supply most of the motive 
force. Through knowledge one comes to understand his 
world ; through his attitudes he builds up his scale of values, 
determines what he considers worth while, and sets his goals 
for achievement. While attitudes depend in no small de- 
gree on the type of knowledge out of which they arise, they 
are in no sense secondary to knowledge as an aim in edu- 
cation. 
Attitude no less important than knowledge—Educa- 
tion has waited all too long for the recognition of this phase 
of training. We have readily granted that in order to be 
educated one must know the facts about his world; but we 
have not so clearly realized that he must aiso be able to 
evaluate these facts. We have shaped our instruction to 
train in the intellectual grasp and comprehension of our 
material and social environment, but we have offered rela- 
tively little help in determining the direction of interests, 
the cultivating of enthusiasms, or the shaping of ideals. We 
have exercised the reason and developed the powers of logic 
in dealing with irtellectual problems, but we have given 
scant attention to the fostering of worthy lines of ambitions 
and desires. We have fully realized that one must learn to 
51 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
52 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
think, but have in no small degree overlooked the fact that 
one must also establish a set of personal standards, habits, 
tastes and inclinations. It is as much an art, and altogether 
as necessary, to train one’s wants—physical, mental, moral 
and social—as to train his powers of thought and supply 
him with a fund of information. 
The outcome of attitude.—In short, the surest test of 
the value of one’s education is the help it renders in develop- 
ing a true philosophy of life. It is this life attitude that 
determines what use one shall make of his knowledge and 
powers. Wrong attitudes toward society and social justice 
make the law-breaker, the oppressor and the criminal. 
Wrong attitudes toward work produce the idler, the spend- 
thrift and the snob. Wrong attitudes toward moral values 
account for much of the sin and crime with which the world 
is cursed. Unworthy interests, low standards and faulty 
ideals cheapen the personal life. Knowledge alone can not 
save from these tragedies ; knowledge is power of the right 
sort only when combined with right attitudes toward one’s 
world. Trained powers set at work in wrong directions 
defeat the very purpose that society has in supporting edu- 
cation, and finally also defeat the individual in the outcome 
of his life. 
What we have called attitudes form so great a complex 
and the terms in use so overlap that any complete or logical 
classification is impossible. For our present purpose, it is 
not necessary. We shall therefore be content with discuss- 
ing a few of the more important aspects of attitude, and 
noting their relation to the aim of education. 
Standards of Value 
Because life is so rich in its opportunities and the lines of 
action, and achievement so multiform, it is highly essential
-P-A-G-E-67
TRAINING TO RIGHT ATTITUDES 53 
that every individual should early develop an accurate sense 
of values. Because so many directions are open in which 
one may expend his energies he must come to know what is 
chiefly worth while as the ends of his ambition and the goal 
of his efforts. Because there are so many things to which 
one may give his time, his strength and his enthusiasm, 
grave waste of these priceless treasures is the rule instead 
of the exception. 
Waste from wrong attitudes——How many of us there 
are who follow ambitions that, once attained, are found to 
be barren and empty! How many devote precious time and 
energy to causes that lead nowhere! How many pursue 
promising will-o’-the-wisps that entice us but to bogs of 
disappointment and disillusionment! How many choose 
baubles that burst'as we grasp them, and strive for what we 
believe to be pearls of great price only to find that they turn 
to paste when we have paid for them! ~ 
Only a trained sense of values will save us from such ex- 
periences. This is to say that part of one’s education and 
development is to arrive at what we have called a philosophy 
of life, a point of view from which to look out on the world 
of values and select the most significant for attainment. It 
is only this that will save from waste and misuse of time, 
energy and opportunity, if not indeed from tragic failure 
and disaster. 
While it is not the problem of this treatment to select a 
omplete philosophy of life, yet a few of the leading values 
ay be set forth. 
The worth of happiness—The value of happiness as 
me of the fundamental aims of life can not be too strongly 
eld in mind in the teaching of youth. True, there are many 
ther aims than that of securing personal happiness, and 
et those who have had the most experience in life and 
chievement agree that the individual who has attained true    
      
   
            
   
           
   
      
   
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
happiness has probably while reaching this accomplishment 
also done most for the world. 
It is a common mistake to conse the means of happi- 
ness with the thing itself. There are many who become so 
busy with making a living, or with the securing of the neces- 
sary conditions to a broad life, as to forget to live in the 
broadest, richest and happiest sense. 
What happiness consists in——By happiness is not 
meant freedom from responsibility, care or even sorrow. 
Happiness at its best consists in no small degree in the deep- 
seated satisfaction found in the unrestricted use of one’s 
powers toward the achievement of ends that seem abun- 
dantly worth while. None are more unhappy than those 
who lack a worthy vocation, or who discover, too late, that 
they have undertaken work unsuited to their capacities or 
that, in itself, is not worth while. Education should there- 
fore help one to find himself, to judge his powers, and select 
an occupation worthy their endeavor. 
The conditions of happiness.—In order to achieve a life 
of happiness one must refuse to get set in a treadmill routine. 
He must be able to extract joy from his tasks, and loo 
on each day’s life as an adventure in experience, capabl 
of yielding satisfaction and zest. He must be able to enjo 
the simple pleasures that come to all—the common associa 
tions with friends and family, the life and events of hi 
time, books, nature, and his own thoughts, hopes and de 
sires. Above all, he must not put a mortgage on his happi 
ness by the setting up of bad habits, sowing the seeds of i 
health, or any other tendency that will later lead to regret 
remorse, or dissatisfaction with living. 
The value of service——A second of the great ends t 
be sought in our scale of values and hence in educatio 
is the ideal of service. This is called the social century. 
spite of war we are coming to see that each of us is bow    
   
         
    
        
    
   
   
-P-A-G-E-69
  TRAINING TO RIGHT ATTITUDES 55 
to all, and that no life is complete without the help of other 
lives. The conviction is steadily growing that the highest 
welfare of the individual lies in the success and happiness 
of society as a whole. 
It therefore becomes not only the duty but the privilege 
of every person to render his quotum of service toward the 
common good, and toward the making of all as successful and 
happy as possible. It is the universal experience that per- 
sonal happiness is most truly and certainly achieved only as 
the individual finds opportunity for the use of his powers in 
such social service. This means that man is created on too 
broad lines to be satisfied or happy under conditions of utter 
selfishness, or with the means of happiness and well-being 
lacking to others whom he might help. 
Expressing the service ideal more concretely, education 
should not be looked on by its possessor as a means of 
escaping effort or labor, but of accomplishing a larger and 
higher service while attaining personal success. The end 
o be sought through trained abilities should not be the ex- 
loiting of the efforts of those less fortunate in ability or 
raining, but the filling of a larger place in the scheme of the 
world’s work and its play. Labor should not be looked on 
s an evil to be endured by those who can not escape its 
ecessity, but as the worthy and natural expression of 
uman life at its best. Any system of education that fails 
lo inculcate this attitude has failed at one of its most critical 
oints. 
Growth as an ideal_—Another of the great values that 
ould enter into every youth’s life philosophy is the ap- 
reciation of self-development or growth. The manner of 
an’s origin we know not, but his nature seems in some 
ay tinctured with divinity. His capacities are therefore 
actically boundless both in number and quality. They are 
so capable of almost unlimited development. Every indi-

| 
vidual at the beginning has the seeds of personality planted 
in his being through heredity.’ These seeds of power must 
be cultivated and nurtured through environment and train- 
ing if they are to come to their full fruitage. Tragic indeed 
the fate of any person possessed of all but infinite capacities 
if he shall because of failure in his education go through 
life with these abilities undeveloped. 
Education should reveal to the individual something of 
the inherent greatness and capacity of human nature, and 
create a hunger for growth and self-development. It should 
set the cultivation of the self as one of the great ends of 
life. 
The value of hopefulness.—High in one’s scale of 
values should stand the culture of optimism and hopeful- 
ness. A pessimistic, cynical attitude never goes with am- 
bition. Pessimism cripples effort, lowers achievement, de- 
stroys happiness and contradicts a sound philosophy of life 
at every point. The molders of history and makers of civili- 
zation have been men and women possessed of a sponta- 
neous hopefulness and deep belief in the value and outcome        
    
                       
   faultfinder who merely complains and never hopefully con- 
structs a new order which he believes to be better than 
what he criticizes is but a drag on progress. One’s educa-| 
tion should therefore lead him to believe in life and the 
future. It should strengthen his faith in the final victor 
of right, and make him a champion for its achievement. 
Caring for the opinion of others——One must also com 
to place a true value on public opinion and esteem. To d 
this without manifesting the cringing attitude of the time 
server and sycophant requires a trained social judgmen’ 
which may well be cultivated in the school. Opportunitie 
for this type of training are abundantly found both in th
-P-A-G-E-71
TRAINING TO RIGHT ATTITUDES By 
subjects of the curriculum and in the social organization of 
the school. 
Cultivation of Interests and Tastes 
Education finds one of its chief functions in broadening, 
enriching and elevating the whole level of the child’s inter- 
ests. No phase of the mental life is more susceptible to 
training than our interests, which constantly respond to the 
material upon which they are fed. The character of the 
interests developed is highly important because interest con- 
stitutes the chief motive force of life. Interest is always 
dynamic, driving to effort and achievement, while the ab- 
sence of interest leaves the individual crippled for want of 
ambition and initiative. 
The shaping of interests.—It is true that interests are 
appealed to and shaped by many influences outside of the 
school and its work. But it is also true that the school, both 
from its associations and from the studies of the curriculum, 
exerts a powerful influence upon the molding of the child’s 
interests. : 
During the elementary school age new interests are aris- 
ing, especially such as look out on various lines of occupa- 
tion and achievement. During the high-school age the 
wider interests in people and in vocations are taking form. 
The notions and whims of childhood are then being replaced 
by a more serious attitude toward life and success, and the 
individual is making plans for the lines later to be taken by 
his life. 
The desideratum at.this stage is vitally to connect lines 
of school interest and study with the concrete interests of 
the life outside the school. Incalculable loss and waste 
occur because of divorcement of school interests from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
58 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
outside occupational and social interests. The effects of 
this divorcement are seen in indifference toward the school, 
dropping out from attendance, and lack of attainment in 
lines of study which seem to have no direct bearing on con- 
crete affairs. Further, wherever this divorcement obtains, 
the knowledge and skill acquired fail to function in the ac- 
tual guidance and activity of experience, and the best edu- 
cational results are therefore lost. 
Grounding the intellectual interests—-During the 
school age is the time to cultivate the intellectual interests 
and tastes which finally give character and quality to the 
whole of the mental life. One whose intellectual interests 
‘remain narrow is in some degree shut out from the great 
world about him. He whose interests attach to trivial or 
unworthy lines of thought and are not appealed to by the 
more serious and important matters of his time lacks some- 
thing of full development. Such a person will of necessity 
be limited in his recognition of opportunity and obligation. 
One of the most promising opportunities of the school is, 
therefore, the cultivation of the intellectual interests. No 
more important question can be asked concerning any sub- ’ 
ject of the curriculum than whether it tends to develop 
what may be called a continuing interest. It is to be feared 
that interest in some subjects of the curriculum, whatever 
may have been its quality during the pursuit of the subject, 
often fails to carry over into the practical life outside of 
the school after the study is completed. Who of us has not 
pursued some line of study to the point of passing a satis- 
factory or even a superior examination, perhaps even win- 
ning a coveted prize, only to find our interest in this field 
suddenly fall away when the last requirement of the course 
had been met. On the other hand, we have followed certain 
other lines of study, the concepts and lessons of which we 
constantly meet in our life outside the school. It is mani- 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
TRAINING TO RIGHT ATTITUDES 59 
festly the business of education to develop an abiding 
foundation of intellectual interests and concepts which will 
extend beyond the school, and carry on into the practical 
every-day life. 
The value of social interests—The range of our social 
interests, the interests that center in our fellow men, should 
not be less broad than the intellectual. Indeed the social 
interests are but a section of the intellectual interests spe- 
cialized to a particular use. While we find the stimuli to 
social interests very plentiful in the workaday world outside 
the school, yet every person needs the definite broadening 
and balancing of his social interests which can come alone 
from the study of peoples—that is to say, a study of his- 
tory, social institutions, literature, art and similar lines. 
The school should bring to the mind of every child his 
relationship to other generations and times, and also his re- 
lation to his own generation. Whoever has not felt the 
inspiration arising from the thought of such relationship 
has lost one of the greatest motive forces to personal de- 
velopment and achievement. 
The vocational interests—The school should have a 
large part in shaping and rendering intelligent the voca- 
tional interests. Every normal child is looking forward to 
the time when he can really take a part in the world’s work. 
He eagerly longs to try his hand at doing something. All 
his impulses are pushing him on toward participation and 
achievement in some line of occupation, and no small part 
of his mental life is taken up with dreaming about the con- 
flicts and successes that will come to him. 
The child has a right, while at this stage, to the informa- 
tion and training that will bring these blind impulses to 
intelligent planning for the future vocation. The time is 
now ripe for vocational guidance. Such guidance, at least 
in the earlier stages, should first of all consist, as suggested

| 
above, in gaining a knowledge of the nature of the different 
vocations—the work they require, the difficulties they present, 
the rewards they offer, the type of ability they demand. In 
this way the youth will be heiped in the critical process of 
“finding himself,” and he will in some degree be saved from 
selecting his vocation on mere whim, or from the thoughtless 
influence of family or friends who lack the trained judg- 
ment to render wise advice. Above all is this the time to 
ground an unshakable belief in the dignity and obligation 
of labor, and a contempt for a life of idleness and parasitic 
preying on society even if fortune may make it possible to 
live without working. 
Ideals of Conduct and Achievement 
Youth is the time of ideals. It is therefore the business 
of education to contribute to the formation of the highest 
type of ideals of personal conduct and achievement. It is 
important that the child shall learn to admire the right types 
of character, and that his standards of success and achieve- 
ment shall be gleaned from worthy sources. It is important 
that he shall come to look on all admirable qualities discov- 
ered in others with sincere appreciation, and that he shall 
turn from low or base qualities with aversion and disgust. 
Personal standards.—Education, therefore, should 
serve to quicken the sense of value for all that is highest, 
best and most worthy in character and personality. It 
should place a premium on standards of personal honesty 
in every line of relationship. Growing out of this point of 
view will come a sense of the worth of dependability of 
character, and the necessity of cultivating traits which will 
bring confidence and esteem from others. 
There should also arise in this connection a feeling of the 
value of personal courage, whether this courage be of the  
-P-A-G-E-75

TRAINING TO RIGHT aa 61 
physical sort that enables one to withstand hardships, dan- 
ger or suffering in the actomplishment of duty; whether 
it be of the intellectual sort that enables one to step out 
_ upon new platforms of thought, willing to accept truth and 
its consequences wherever found; or whether it be of the 
moral kind, enabling one to stand secure in the presence of 
evil and temptation. It is equally necessary that the moral 
attitude be made to include such a sense of personal respon- 
sibility for achievement that all low aims shall become 
ignoble and failure to do one’s part in society not only im- 
moral, but a crime against humanity. | 
Such ideals, well grounded, can not but serve to quicken 
the attitude toward ambition, rendering one impatient of 
inaction or idleness. They will stimulate the individual to 
prepare for his vocation and to rise high in it. They will 
tend to develop a power of initiative and place a premium 
on originality and independence of effort. The results of 
such ambitions and standards are certain to show in the 
spirit of enterprise and to class their possessor among the 
efficient of his generation. | 
Determining moral standards.—Moral ‘standards, are 
also open to guidance and training. The school is rich in 
opportunities to shape: the moral standards and develop 
ideals of conduct. It is indeed no great kindness to the 
individual and certainly none to society, to train the in- 
tellectual power and acumen, if we leave at the same time 
the moral motive undeveloped, or permit such a twist in the 
moral standards as may later cause the individual to prey 
upon society, either as a parasite or as a criminal. The 
school should, therefore, be jealous of its opportunity to 
mold the moral ideal and should certainly allow no part of 
the school associations, lessons, examinations or other fac- 
tors to do anything whatever toward the lowering of moral 
standards. | 
\ 
| 
| 
|  
-P-A-G-E-76
62 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
It is to be doubted whether the school has been reason- 
ably successful in inculcating moral ideals. True, the school 
has a difficult problem to meet in the teaching of moral 
standards which the child often sees constantly violated in 
the wider community outside the school. Yet the very 
existence of low moral ideals in social, business or political 
- affairs makes it all the more imperative that the school shall 
seek to ground the young in the fundamentals of morality. 
The morals of the school.—The school itself, we must 
admit, can not claim exemption from typical immoralities 
that are sure to some degree to carry over into later life. 
There is no small amount of evasion, trickery and “bluffing” 
in recitations. Cheating in examinations is all too common 
and is often looked on lightly by the pupils. Unfairness in 
athletic games is frequently condoned if skilful enough to 
get past the referee without detection. Appropriating 
books, pencils and the like from the school supply or other 
pupils is not called stealing. As a matter of fact school 
honesty and morality is commonly put on a different plane 
from business honesty and morality. It is not necessary to 
argue that this is all wrong, debasing to the character of 
youth, and that, where such standards obtain, there the 
school has its most important problem unsolved. 
The Cultivation of Habits 
Not less important as a part of education is the cultiva- 
tion of personal habits. Habit is not only one of the most 
important factors in one’s development, but is a chief end 
of all growth and education. Here as in other lines of de- © 
velopment the world outside the school plays its part, but 
because of the long time devoted to school attendance, and 
because of the constantly repeated program of certain re-
-P-A-G-E-77
| 
| TRAINING TO RIGHT ATTITUDES 63 
| 
quirements, recitations and other exercises, the school is 
especially fruitful in habit forming. | 
Habit forming in school.—There is probably no place 
better calculated to develop the habit of achievement than 
the school room with its requirements and tasks. Here 
children learn, if their education progresses aright, to meet 
the hard and disagreeable, and not to give way in the face 
of difficulties. Through the attitude of his instructors and 
his schoolmates the child learns the penalty in loss of social 
esteem that comes to the “quitter,” or to the one who shows 
a “yellow streak,” in meeting hardships or measuring up to 
responsibilities. The problems of the curriculum should 
teach habits of persistence and steadiness of purpose. Here 
should be cultivated habits of punctuality, not only from be- 
ing at school at certain required hours, but from meeting the 
recitation, library or laboratory requirements within the 
schedule set for them. Here the individual should learn to 
work under the stress of pressure and necessity, coming to 
see that his own personal desires and comforts, even, must 
sometimes stand aside before the dictates of necessity as set 
by a program of school exercises. 
Important habits to make sure of —The work of the 
school should cultivate the habit of open-mindedness, will- 
ingness to receive and welcome truth, and the ability to pass 
critical judgment on all problems confronting the individual. 
The anchorage of such habits cultivated in the school should 
keep one from being swept away by every current of public 
opinion, and from following madly the leadership of fad- 
dists and propagandists. : 
The associations of the school, perhaps even more than 
its studies, should lead to habits of emotional control. Par- 
ticularly during the high-school age, emotional stress aris- 
ing from the mingling of large masses of young people to- 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  i 
64 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
gether, and especially from associations with the opposite 
sex, offers good opportunities for cultivating the emotional 
‘habits. Education should in no degree seek to weaken or 
crush out any of the desirable emotions, but should con- 
stantly lead in the direction of emotional balance and con- 
trol. It is not that one should have eradicated from his 
nature the capacity for wrong or excess, not that he should 
be so patient or mild as never to hate, not that he is in 
danger of loving too deeply, but that in all these situations 
he should have cultivated such a mastery and control as 
that harmony and balance may result. His education 
should work to this end.   
Tastes and Appreciations 
Cultivated tastes and the capacity for fine appreciations 
are one of the highest aims of éducation. One whose taste 
in reading leads only to the cheaply thrilling story, whose 
taste in music is satisfied with rag-time, whose taste in pic- 
tures reaches only to the colored Sunday supplement, has 
missed much of the best and most satisfying experience that 
can enter life. Inability to appreciate and enjoy a beautiful 
sunset, to take happiness and satisfaction from birds and 
flowers and running brooks, to respond with a thrill to the 
fine and heroic in the common lives about us, deprives us 
of half the joy of living and leaves our own natures deficient 
in the finer qualities. 
How tastes are developed.—Such deficiencies as these 
are not cured by lamenting over the depraved tastes of our 
times—they are probably fully as good as those of any earlier 
time. The fact is that taste and appreciation grow by what 
they feed on, The remedy for low tastes is therefore not 
lectures on taste, but better material to feed on. The cure 
for cheap debasing reading is better stories adapted to the
-P-A-G-E-79
TRAINING TO RIGHT ATTITUDES 65 
age and interests of the reader. The cure for rag-time and 
the colored comics is better music and pictures adapted to 
the grasp and appreciation of the child. The same prin- 
ciple will hold for the whole range of tastes and apprecia- 
tions, and it is one of the chief problems of the school to 
supply the material required for the various stages of de- 
velopment. 
Summarizing our discussion, we must conclude that the 
group of qualities we have called attitudes, interests, etc., 
is one of the primary aims of education. Each subject of 
the curriculum must do its share toward developing right 
attitudes toward the essential values of life and its activities. 
To finish the school with trained intellectual powers, but 
with narrow or perverted interests, with low standards of 
morals, with the spirit of artistry and achievement lacking, 
or with an indifferent set of habits formed, is to confess 
defeat and lost purpose in education. Cultivated tastes and 
ready appreciation for things that are worth while are evi- 
dence of true culture and attainment. Not alone what we 
know about our world, but how we react to it determines 
the worth of our education. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Do you know any pupil who has a bad attitude toward the 
school, or teacher, or toward some particular study? If so, how 
does this attitude affect his work and progress? What is the 
remedy? 
2. Suppose a class, say in literature, has secured a reasonable 
range of information from their study, but has not developed an 
interest in reading more of the same kind of material. How would 
you rank the success of the course? Apply the same test to his- 
tory, science, etc. What conclusions do you draw as to attitude 
being one of the chief considerations in teaching any subject? 
3, Think your pupils over individually, and see whether you can
-P-A-G-E-80
  66 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
classify them on the basis of their ideals and ambitions for success 
and achievement. How can you, through your teaching, improve 
their outlook on life? 
4. What is the remedy for an unsatisfactory attitude toward - 
class-room honesty? Toward sportsmanship? Toward truthful- 
ness? Toward business honesty? Toward work? The cure for 
snobbishness ? 
5. Try making a list of the bad habits, physical, mental, social 
and moral, which you discover among your pupils. Then seek a 
remedy for each class of bad habits. Have you any more important 
problem in your teaching than this?
-P-A-G-E-81
CHAPTER VI 
DEVELOPING SKILLS 
NOWLEDGE, interests and ideals are never an end 
in themselves. Their function is to influence action. 
Skill in doing is the ultimate end of education. It is how 
we act, how we respond to this situation or that, how we 
conduct ourselves under one set of circumstances or another 
that determines our efficiency. Deeds, performance, achieve- 
ment aré the real points of contact with life. 
Skills the end of knowledge and attitudes.—The skills 
aim of education seeks to take the knowledge, powers, in- 
terests and ideals and set them at work in actual affairs. 
This aim undertakes to remedy the all too-prevalent defect 
in our education that permits so great a divorcement as com- 
monly exists between knowledge and its use, between power 
and accomplishment, between, theory and practise, between 
learning and efficiency. The skills aim takes ‘the point of 
- view that knowledge is power only when applied to concrete 
affairs, and when put at work in meeting the genuine prob- 
lems and duties encountered in the day’s life and its tasks. 
We must admit that education has lamentably failed at 
this point in the past. For much of our learning has stopped 
very far short of skills. We have not harnessed our knowl- 
edge and set it at work. We have all along held to a more 
or less instinctive belief that learning is desirable and will 
surely lead to better and more successful living. We have 
felt that ignorance is dangerous and unprofitable. And this 
is no doubt quite true. But we have nevertheless done little 
67 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
| | 
68 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
to insure that education shall really carry through to the 
point where most of our knowledge becomes efficiency in 
doing—to the point of skill. We have not always made 
certain that what we teach in the school shall play a vital 
and significant part in shaping life and determining success _ 
outside the school. 
Falling short of attaining skills—For example, how 
many of our children have better eyes, teeth, stomachs, 
lungs, more efficient and beautiful bodies, and longer and 
happier lives for the physiology they have studied? We 
teach them much about the anatomy of their bodies, about 
the chemistry of their tissues and about the physiological 
processes involved ix circulation and digestion—but we do 
not always insure that they shall live better for having 
studied physiology. In how far do the pupils we teach 
speak more fluently and correctly and write with greater 
: precision, ease and enjoyment for the grammar lessons they 
have learned? We teach them to analyze, diagram, parse, 
decline, and all the rest, but it is to be feared that not nearly 
all of this recondite knowledge becomes effective in actual 
speech. 
In how far does the history we teach really lead to love 
of country and true patriotism? We have our children 
learn of “settlements,” wars, dates, political parties, presi- 
dents, etc. But none would dare to say that most of this 
knowledge influences action at such points of experience as 
test love of country and devotion to duty. And so with all 
the rest of our school subjects. That they all do help in 
some degree in the directions indicated is no doubt true. 
But that the results are what they should be, or that they 
have been the product of definite planning and wise educa- 
‘tional foresight that definitely seeks such an end can hardly 
be claimed.
-P-A-G-E-83
  
‘ 
DEVELOPING SKILLS 69 
A change coming.—As was shown in an earlier chap- 
ter, however, education is growing conscious of its function 
as a very real and definite agency in human affairs. It is 
coming to realize that its purpose is not accomplished until 
there is an immediate and sure connection set up between 
what is learned in school and what is done or accomplished, 
in the life outside the school. We are coming to see that 
what we teach is futile and incomplete until it eventuates 
in conduct and action—in skills. 
How Skills Are Obtained 
As already implied the term skills is here used for the 
tendency and power to carry one’s knowledge and attitudes 
over into action. This definition is very broad, and allows 
(1) for that narrower range of skills which can be made 
automatic by repetition and practise, and also (2) for the 
more general and complex skills which constantly require 
thought, reasoning, adjustment. Typical of the narrower 
skills are speech, bodily poise and carriage, manual dex- 
terity, the simpler memory associations, etc. Typical of the 
broader skills are one’s ability to carry the truths he learns 
in arithmetic over to his practical affairs and set them at 
work there; his power to make his study of language show 
in the speech he daily uses; his tendency to make the ideals, 
standards and ambitions developed by his study in school 
become an active reconstructing influence in his practical 
life and affairs. 
Skills based on practise and application.—Skill in any 
line is an art; it develops gradually by practise and repeti- 
tion. We are skilled only when the act or the tendency to 
its performance has become second nature, and its perform- 
lance is effective in accomplishing the purpose in view. Acts
-P-A-G-E-84
70 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
which must be guided by conscious decision and purpose 
are labored, uncertain and inefficient. But let the act grow 
by intelligent practise until it becomes habit, and skill is sure 
to emerge in the process. 
It is this simple fact of psychology that explains the dif- 
ference between mere learning and efficiency. Learning is 
a necessary guide to action if the skill which develops is to 
be intelligent and useful. But learning alone, as already 
shown, never. spells efficiency; it must first be carried 
through to skilful performance. As a simple illustration: 
the boy who has an ambition to learn how to pitch a curved 
ball does not spend all his time studying the resolution of 
forces and the resistance of air to spherical bodies revolving 
on an axis as they are projected through space. Certain 
knowledge of this sort is desirable if not necessary to one 
who would master the art of curving balls. But along with 
his learning our boy must not forget to practise at pitching 
curves. His knowledge of the principles involved will guide 
his pitching, but he must pitch. 
Knowledge only opens the way to skill—So with any 
other form of learning. We teach our children number in| 
order that they may be able to make the practical compu 
tations needed daily in the common occupations; then ow 
instruction must furnish practise in the numerical compu: 
tations to be met in these occupations. We teach languag 
that our children may attain greater fluency, ease and ef 
fectiveness in the use of good speech; then our instructio 
must give abundant practise in those language forms tha 
will lead,to such ends. In short it is not knowledge of num| 
ber that we seek, but skill in numbering; not knowledge o 
language forms, but skill in speech. And skill, we repea 
requires application and practise. We must see that know! 
edge carries over into performance.

Physical Skills . 
   
                        
     
    
       
     
    
    By physical skills is not meant mere dexterity of hand or 
some extraordinary ability in games or handiwork. The 
concept rather involves the mastery and adaptation of the 
whole body, including its growth, health, carriage, habits 
and the training of the hand to its purposes. 
Skill in maintaining health—How much working ef- 
ficiency is destroyed, how much happiness lost, and how 
many lives shortened through the lack of skill in judging 
and caring for our bodies! There can be no more impor- 
tant part of education than that which results in more 
hygienic eating and drinking, wiser expenditure of energy 
in work and recreation, better care of skin, teeth, eyes and 
other organs, the securing of better air to breathe, and in 
general the setting up of those habits of living that favor 
hysical efficiency and length of life. There is little doubt 
hat effective instruction directed to such ends could extend 
he average span of life by a number of years, relieve much 
f the misery caused by sickness, and greatly enhance work- 
ing efficiency. 
Skill in physical bearing.—Physical poise, carriage and 
ignity of bearing are also an essential part of education. 
hey are in a large measure developed outside the school, 
nd yet the finer aspects of such skills almost invariably 
lepend on instruction and conscious direction. Physical 
aining that results in mere athletic prowess while neglect- 
g formative and corrective training for the whole body has 
issed the mark. The star quarter-back who when off the 
ridiron ambles and shuffles in his gait, or the record track 
an who is ungainly and unimpressive in his physical bear- 
ig, is a standing accusation against the system of physical
-P-A-G-E-86

72 ye THO METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
education in his school. Careless carriage, stooped shoul- 
ders, awkward attitudes and general inefficiency of bearing 
are not only adverse to health, but are a real drawback to 
success in the business and social world. They should be 
eliminated through education. 
Manual skills —Manual skill, or the attainment of pro- 
ficiency with the hand, is a highly desirable phase of train- 
ing. Man owes his predominance over the lower animals 
not less to the possession of a hand than to his superior 
mind. It is the hand which most fully and perfectly car- 
ries out the mind’s dictates, and which is in the last analysis’ 
responsible for our civilization and progress. Not only does 
skill in the use of the hand yield the possessor satisfaction, 
but there is hardly a vocation in which such skill will not 
prove of service. A highly specialized manual skill lays the 
foundation for certain vocations, such as the industrial, the 
technological, or that of the artist. 
Skill in speech.—An important part of physical control 
is the skill that has to do with speech. This involves a 
proper use of the voice, good articulation and enunciation, 
readiness and fluency. Relatively few people are as effective 
speakers, either in conversation or more formal speech, as 
they might be. Whatever may be one’s relations in life a 
high degree of efficiency in speech will increase his chances| 
for success and make him more efficient in his associations 
with other people. 
Skill in play.—The cultivation of one’s physical skil 
extends to ability in plays and games. The English in larg 
part excel Americans in the degree to which amateur abilit 
in avocations has spread to include a large proportion of th 
population among all classes. We are a nation devoted t 
sports, but are too easily satisfied by employing experts t 
play before us while we sit idly by as spectators, enjoyin 
the contest as a mere spectacle without participating in th 
       
         
                             
     
   
     
-P-A-G-E-87
  DEVELOPING SKILLS 73 
play ourselves. Not only. life and happiness, but physical 
efficiency is in no small degree dependent on the cultivation 
of play interests and play skill. 
Mental Skills 
It is one thing to have a well-disposed mind adequately 
stored with knowledge, and quite another thing to be able 
to use this knowledge readily and with skill when required. 
There are many adults as well as children who “know but 
can’t tell,” who “understand but can’t explain,’ who com- 
prehend the point at issue but can not make it clear to others. 
Ability to think under stress.—In a large proportion of 
the problems to be met in the course of practical affairs, 
one must reason and decide under stress. He must be able 
to “think on his feet,” and in the presence of people. He 
must be capable of marshaling facts, weighing evidence and 
reaching conclusions on the spur of the moment. He must 
have the power to rise above prejudice and the influence 
of opinion and decide things for himself on their merits, 
He must possess initiative, and learn to rely upon and have 
confidence in his own judgment. He must develop habits 
and standards of thoroughness in thinking, and not be satis- 
fied to jump to a conclusion. 
One of the chief functions of education is to develop this 
mental skill. Not what one takes in, but the extent to which 
he is able to command his mental powers is the final measure 
of his education. To this end, the knowledge mastered 
must be of the right kind, and must be so organized that it 
will readily apply to genuine problems. A high degree of 
mental alertness must be cultivated, and the ability de- 
veloped to concentrate all available power on whatever mat- 
ter is in hand. Mind-wandering and the habit of mental 
dawdling and dreaming must be cured. Memorzy must be-
-P-A-G-E-88

74 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
| 
come not only accurate, but ready, not failing at important 
points, nor hesitating until too late for its material to be of 
use. Imagination must be vivid, and capable of constructive 
activity in many fields. The capacity for observation must 
be made strong to see, hear and apprehend quickly and 
accurately in our physical and social world, 
Securing emotional control.—Mental skill also extends 
to the field of the emotions. One must develop control 
under emotional stress. He needs to learn how to “be angry 
and sin not,” to fear and not give way to panic, to hate with- 
out losing his sense of justice. Strong emotional power is 
as necessary to a successful life as strong intellectual power, 
but to be safe it must be balanced by an adequate degree of 
restraint and control. 
Social Skills 
The cultivation of skills must also carry over into the 
realm of social relations. By social skills are meant those 
social qualities and arts by which others come to know us, 
judge us and give us our rating as members of our social 
group. 
Sympathy and appreciation need to be aroused and quick- 
ened. The capacity to enter into the thoughts and feelings 
of others must be developed. No one lives to himself but 
each is in constant association with others whom he must 
come to know, judge and understand daily and hourly as 
they live, work, play together. Much of success and ef- 
ficiency depends on the skill thus to adjust ourselves to those 
about us. 
Working toward social skills—No small part of the 
pleasure and outcome of life depend on this social adapta- 
bility. Children are normally self-centered and devoid of 
toct, Such attitudes must give way to altruism, courteous
-P-A-G-E-89
DEVELOPING SKILLS 75 
behavior, and care for the feelings of others. The quarrel- 
someness that characterizes certain stages of childhood must 
yield to more harmonious and adaptable qualities. Impu- 
dence and flippancy must change to attitudes of respect and 
seriousness. Loyalty and sportsmanship must be grounded, 
and many other social graces cultivated. 
Social ease and poise are also to be acquired. Not to be 
able to meet other people easily, freely and without embar- 
rassment is to fall far short of the end of education and 
development. It is true that the cultivation of this ability 
does not depend exclusively on the school. The school as- 
sociations however, and in some degree the curriculum, will 
tend to cultivate social ability at points not touched upon in 
the associations outside the school. Education should lead 
to a respect for the social conventions and skill in their use. 
Any education which leaves the youth either uninformed or 
unskilled in what may be called the smaller niceties of be- 
havior in society and social gatherings has in some degree 
failed in its duty to the individual. 
Skill in leadership.—Qualities of leadership should also 
be stimulated through education. The world needs fol- 
lowers as well as leaders, but there is small danger of 
overdeveloping the more solid and fundamental qualities 
which make for leadership. Every youth should become 
ambitious to exert influence among his fellows, and should 
in some degree become skilled in the use of his social powers 
to this end. 
Moral Skills 
No greater need exists in our civilization to-day than the 
cultivation of moral skills and control. A nation or a civili- 
zation is in the end no stronger than its morals—not its 
moral theories, but its moral practise. For, lacking essential
-P-A-G-E-90
    1 
76 CLASS- Baa METHOD AND ees 
morality of life and conduct, nothing else of value can ae 
survive among a people or in an individual. 
Difficulty in developing moral control.—There is grave 
. reason to doubt whether we are as successful in training the - 
moral skills in the school as we ought to be. True, “it is 
easier to train to intellectual skill than to moral. For the 
practise of morality often carries one against the current 
of inclination and desire. It demands resistance, self-denial, 
restraint, all of which is disagreeable. The result is that 
few of us do as well as we know. Paul was but expressing 
an all-too-common experience when he said, “The good that 
I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.” 
Our moral theory always outruns our moral practise. 
The school, as suggested in an earlier chapter, confronts 
a very difficult problem in moral training, owing to many 
influences outside the school which tend to contradict the 
highest moral ideals. Yet the school itself is not without 
fault.. Surely the work and life of the school should be so 
organized that moral conduct is the natural and easy thing, 
and that immoral conduct will not commonly net an advan- 
tage to the one who practises it. 
Standards of moral action.—To be on safe ground, the 
individual must find himself able to be honest when to be 
honest costs; to be just when injustice would yield personal 
advantage ; to be loyal to friend or worthy cause when loy- 
alty means sacrifice; to tell the truth when lying would be 
altogether easier; to be clean when impurity appears in 
inviting form; to be courteous when anger or resentment 
stirs the blood; to be true to an ideal when the immediate 
result is pain or suffering. It is the business of the school, 
in common with other agencies which serve to educate, to 
train in the practise as well as in the theory of these moral 
virtues. 
Power to meet the disagreeable-—Moral skill has also

another point of application,—that of enabling us to meet 
and triumph over the disagreeable. It is easy enough to 
secure cooperation and high effort in all directions which 
are pleasant and which lead to agreeable experiences ; but 
it is often hard to find those who are able to stand steady 
when they meet the hard and unpleasant. Those who are 
ready to champion a just but unpopular cause are far less 
numerous than those who are ready to go with the crowd. 
Here as in other lines the relations outside the school 
have an important bearing on the ability in question, yet the 
life of the school, together with the lessons of the curricu- 
lum should be made to have a most important effect on the 
moral sturdiness and fiber of the character. Any system of 
education which has failed to take into account the necessity 
for cultivating moral skills, or which has failed to work out 
a program giving daily practise to the moral qualities in the 
school room has in so far proved itself a failure. 
Reviewing our discussion, we have seen that any training 
in knowledge, or shaping of interests and attitudes, is incom- 
plete which does not seek to arrive at practical skills as their 
aim. Life finally expresses itself in terms of action, con- 
duct, achievement. -It is the business of education to carry 
its training through to this end. This point of view there- 
fore sets the problem for each branch of the curriculum, 
and for every teacher—to make the subject-matter and the 
process of learning it eventuate in some concrete and neces- 
sary form of skill in the learner. Knowledge, from this 
standpoint, can never become an end in itself, but only a 
guide to intelligent skills. Interests, ideals, ambitions do 
not exist for their own sake, but ultimately as incentives to 
right action. 
From the last three chapters we are justified in conclud- 
ing that no educational aim is complete, no educational pro-

cedure effective, that does not take into account these three 
great purposes: (1) the gaining of fruitful knowledge to 
guide in practical experience, (2) the grounding of right 
attitudes, interests and ideals to motivate conduct, and (3) 
the practical putting of our knowledge, interests and ideals 
at work in daily conduct leading to the skills required for 
successful living. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Think over your own education and study, seeking to discover 
places at which the knowledge you learned did not function, i. e., 
did not make you do differently in any way you can discover for 
having learned it. What was lacking? Was the knowledge itself at 
fault, or was there a failure to carry it over into use? 
2. Think over the subjects you are teaching, and ask yourself 
about each of them: Just what skills is this branch cultivating in 
my pupils, how are they thinking differently or doing differently for 
what I am teaching them? If you can not be sure, is this a sugges- 
tion that you should make your teaching more definite? 
3. Study the postures of your pupils as they sit or stand or walk. 
Do they need to cultivate physical skills in these directions? Do you 
find some who, through embarrassment or fear, lose command of 
their mental powers when they most need them? Some who lack 
control of their anger, jealousy, affection? If so, how can you help 
them to develop the missing skills? 
4. Have you some pupils who are shy and ill at ease when in the 
company of others? Some who have uncouth manners and who 
lack social tact? If so, can you devise ways to help train to the 
skills required? 
5. Have you certain pupils who are not safe in the presence of 
temptations to cheat, lie, steal? If so, is it from a lack of knowing 
the wrong of these things, or a matter of low standards, or a failure 
to practise moral resistance, i. e., to develop moral skills? How can 
you help such ones?

  CHAPTER VII 
THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF EDUCATION 
N the preceding discussion we have seen how method 
rests on a fourfold foundation—frst the aim, second the 
material, third the organization, and fourth the presentation. 
We now come to the problem of the material, or the subject- 
matter of education. 
Present Readjustments of Subject-Matter 
What, then, shall one study as subject-matter? What 
shall we teach our children?—Or does it especially matter? 
Is it true, as one college professor advised his long-suffering 
class: “When you have found the matter that seems to you 
most difficult, dry and useless; when you have discovered 
material that has no point of contact with your interest and 
experience, but which must be mastered by sheer force of 
will—this is the subject-matter to which you should give 
your days and nights of study if you would become schol- 
ars!” Is such a dreary way the true road to education? 
Can stich an empty grind develop the powers, enrich the 
life, and fit one into his place in the busy world? Because 
“there is exercise for the jaws in chewing even sole-leather” 
shall we feed our children on such dessicated mental pabu- 
lum? Or shall we feed their minds, nourish their powers, 
and stimulate their interest with the rich food of vital and 
valuable subject-matter ? 
New emphasis on subject-matter—The fact that such 
questions as these are arising with increasing insistence 
79  
-P-A-G-E-94
  i i 
80 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 1 7 1 
and frequency is indicative ofa new and marked movement 
in education. The content of the curriculum, the subject- 
matter of education, is at present undergoing a most rigid 
examination. We are setting earnestly at work to recon- 
struct the curriculum of our schools. ‘To this end we are 
passing the subjects in review with reference to their value 
as educational material. Every bach is being subjected 
to scrutiny for the purpose of discovering its right to the 
time and effort of the child. | 
The old order is giving way and a new day is at hand. 
We are now coming to see that what we put into our schools 
as educational material finally comes out in life, character 
and efficiency. History has shown us that what a nation 
feeds the minds of its youth through the medium of its 
schools at last comes to dominate its social and national 
ideals. Growing out of such considerations as these we are 
becoming convinced that education time is too precious and 
the interests at stake too great to squander time on obsolete 
or useless material. | 
Two factors responsible for recent changes.—Two 
chief factors have recently led to the present critical exami- 
nation and revision of the subject-matter of education. 
These are, (1) the breakdown of the disciplinary concep- 
tion of education, and (2) the wonderful increase in recent 
decades of Ca material seeking admission into the cur- 
riculum. | 
There is no thought nor necessity of entering here on an 
extended discussion of the merits or shortcomings of formal 
discipline as an end in education. We are chiefly concerned 
in our present question with what has actually occurred or 
is now taking place in connection with the disciplinary aim 
and its relation to the present-day educational subject- 
matter found in our school curriculum. 
The Saltoney concept of education.—Advocates of

-P-A-G-E-95
  THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF EDUCATION 81 
the disciplinary theory of education have pinned their faith 
to the “discipline” of so-called mental “faculties,” through 
their exercise upon hard study. Not the content to be 
mastered but the fact of the mastery itself.is chiefly de- 
pended on for the educational value achieved. The. dis- 
ciplinarians have been fond of using the analogy of the 
body’s need of exercise in support of their argument for 
mere mental effort as the means by which the ends of 
education are chiefly to be attained. They like to say that 
“mental powers grow just as physical powers develop: by 
their use.” Therefore, urge these theorists, “train the mind 
by severe exercise and it will naturally follow that you will 
see it grow and develop.” 
The opponents of this view, however, suggest that those 
who employ such an analogy should not forget that back of 
bodily exercise must be the assimilation of suitable and 
nutritious food if strength and development are to come 
from the physical exercise. In like manner they say that 
along with the use of mental powers the mind must be fed 
on fruitful, nourishing subject-matter, such as will stimulate 
its powers, arouse its interest and call forth its effort. 
Changing the figure, the mind comes to’ its full strength 
and power, not by buffeting intellectual punching bags nor 
by fighting mental “men of straw,” but by grappling with 
vital problems full of the zest of life and action. 
The breaking down of the disciplinary concept—With- 
out going further into the discussion at this point, we may 
at least state one patent fact: the disciplinary concept of 
education has broken down. Not that the old doctrine of 
discipline does not still retain a strong hold on education; 
it does, and probably yet dominates at least one-half of the 
curriculum. But the wedge has entered, and the structure 
lof educational theory, so laboriously erected by John Locke 
nd his followers, is finding its foundation undermined.

82 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
It may be worth while briefly to state the principal factors - 
whose influences are discrediting the disciplinary view and 
forcing a reconstruction of the present-day curriculum: 
First, experimental psychology has shown that, even if 
training may in some degree be carried over from one ability 
to a related power, the waste by this round-about method is 
nevertheless inexcusably great. To found a system of edu- 
cation on such a concept is a senseless squandering of the 
priceless treasure of time and educational opportunity. 
Psychology has further shown that better training, better 
discipline, if you will, of the mental powers can be had 
from the study of educational material that calls forth the 
interest and enthusiasm of the learner than from any empty 
grind on useless material. 
True, the disciplinarian tells us that where interest and 
enthusiasm are lacking there the will is being trained 
through study. But. Doctor Dewey has shown in his bril- 
liant essay on Interest and the Will that the will is no such 
isolated power that it can thus operate independently of the 
other processes of the mind. The best development of the 
will, like the best development of the thought powers, comes 
only when the whole self gives its assent to the work in 
hand. And the whole self is brought into action only when 
interest calls. Nor does interest kindle from contact with 
dead and formal material that has no vital relation to the 
genuine problems which alone grow out of actual affairs. 
True discipline results only from mastery of what the mind| 
works on; and any full or adequate mastery of disciplinary] 
subjects in our schools is, as Flexner argues, the exceptio 
rather than the rule. é 
Second, the great social force that we call the public i 
making itself heard on the question of the curriculum.

   Partly through the teachings of psychology and the science 
of education made known by means of the press and plat- 
form, and partly by an innate common sense of its own, the 
public has lost faith in the old disciplinary education. This 
public is now demanding a curriculum which it believes con- 
tains a larger proportion of vital and useful material related 
to the needs and problems of actual experience. 
While society is not always conscious of the processes by 
which it arrives at its conclusions, it nevertheless does form 
judgments. Sooner or later it makes itself heard, and its 
voice must be obeyed. And it is undoubtedly well, on the 
whole, that this should be so. For, though we of the edu- 
cational guild may be loath to admit it, most of the great 
educational reforms have come from the people, or from 
such leaders as have lived close enough to the people, to 
sense their half-formed thought and formulate their imper- 
fectly felt ideals. Surely none who are in touch with the 
world of affairs can doubt that there is at present a growing 
social demand for more fruitful educational material in our 
chools. 
The rapid increase of educational material —The other 
reat factor which is forcing a revision of the subject-matter 
in our curriculum at the present day, the increase of avail- 
ble educational material, will not require extended com- 
ent. It will be remembered that the dream of Bacon and 
omenius and others of their time was a pansophic scheme 
f education—the student was to learn all there was to 
now. At that time well-trained minds could seriously 
onsider the possibility of expecting one individual to mas- 
r the whole field of human knowledge. 
While undoubtedly such an ideal for education was 
ways impossible, yet it was not until well on in the last 
ntury that investigation, discovery and general progress
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 “CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
in human knowledge resulted in such an increase in avail- 
able material as to make it possible greatly to enrich the 
school curriculum. It is about a century since Harvard 
added geography to the list of its entrance subjects. The 
various material sciences entered the field one by one and 
knocked at the schoolhouse door, asking to be let in. Along 
came history, which has since been divided into many fields, 
civil government of the state and nation, political economy 
and the elements of sociology. The modern languages have 
entered a plea for recognition and have taken rank with the 
ancient languages, which originally dominated the field. 
Nature study, music and art presented their claims and were 
added to the course of study. And now come the vocational 
group, domestic science, manual training, agriculture an 
other subdivisions without number, clamoring for a place. 
So rich is our supply of educational subject-matter in thi: 
day that our great problem is not, as in Bacon’s time, ho 
we shall master it all, but how we shall make from it th 
best selection for our school curriculum, 
The overcrowded curriculum.—This problem has be 
come acute and it presents many perplexing difficultie: 
Upon its wise solution depends much of the future succes 
of our schools. The curriculum of the elementary school i 
full, pressed down and running over without any furthe 
additions. It contains now too much matter to be succes: 
fully mastered by the pupils or well taught by the teacher

mean subtractions. The old subjects can no longer mere!

     its twin the process of eliminating the useless and obsolete 
subject-matter not suited to the present aims and require- 
ments of education. 
Directions taken by the present reconstruction.—The 
reconstructions now going on in the course of study are 
proceeding in two main directions: (1) The displacing from 
a dominant position at the head of the high curriculum of 
the old disciplinary standbys, the ancient languages and 
mathematics, and substituting for them a variety of more 
concrete subjects; and (2) a thoroughgoing reorganization 
within the different subjects themselves, both in the ele- 
mentary school and the high school, with the purpose of 
dropping out such material as can not show a direct rela 
tion to some very immediate educational value. 
The first of these movements has found expression in the 
introduction of elective subjects and parallel elective courses 
of study in secondary schools. Higher institutions have 
modified their requirements to meet these changes in the 
lower schools. Many leading colleges now admit with no 
ancient language, and a very moderate mathematics require- 
ment. An increasing number of these institutions grant the 
Bachelor of Arts degree upon graduation with no Latin or 
Greek and no mathematics beyond solid geometry. 
The second of the movements mentioned has been slower 
in getting under way than the first, but bids fair to be no 
ess far-reaching and important. The work of revising and 
nriching the elementary curriculum so well begun by Pro- 
essor John Dewey, Colonel Parker and others of their 
chool, has borne much good fruit. University schools of 
ducation have been earnestly at work seeking to relieve the 
vercrowded and all-too-fruitless curriculum without losing 
rom it elements of value. Many administrators, teachers 
nd students of education are skilfully insisting that arith- 
etic, grammar, geography and other elementary subjects
-P-A-G-E-100
      q } 
; 86 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
shall have the dead and useless material dropped from them, 
that the vital material may be more fully mastered. The 
National Education Association and various state associa- 
tions have appointed committees to study the curriculum, 
and several valuable reports have been issued recommend- 
ing the elimination of useless material. Unquestionably, 
great and significant changes in the material of education 
within the accepted subjects of our schools are still ahead. 
Subject-Matter Determined by Aim 
What are the principles that should guide in the selection 
of subject-matter? How may we know whether the cur- 
riculum we teach or administer needs further enrichment 
or elimination? How are we to judge what mental pabulum 
should be fed the child and what excluded from his educa- 
tional dietary. On what scientific basis can we evolve a 
balanced ration for the mind? And how is this related to 
our problem of method? 
We may enter on this section of our discussion from the 
fundamental proposition already stated, that the content, or 
subject-matter of instruction, must be determined by and be 
adapted to the aim sought. 
This statement is to be taken very literally. The prin-| 
ciple may be difficult of application at certain points, but of 
its truth and importance there can be no question. To den 
its validity is to say that an end may be sought withou 
reference to the means employed for the attainment of tha’ 
end, or that a goal may be reached without any care in se: 
lecting the road which leads to the goal. All of which is o 
course futile and foolish. 
Determining the material by the aim—Let us ap 
proach the question somewhat more concretely. Let u 
for the purpose of illustration, for the moment take ou|

   position with those who subscribe to the disciplinary theory 
of education. Let us conceive that the primary aim of edu- 
cation is to “train the mental powers” and not to gain con- 
cretely useful knowledge or develop any particular attitudes, 
or skills. Let us believe that hard study, even if distasteful 
and compelled by stern authority, is more important than 
just what material one studies upon.—What then shall we 
choose for our subject-matter? 
In answering, let us apply the principle with which we 
started; the subject-matter must fit the aim. The aim is 
hard application, logical sequences, exact, as well as exact- 
ing, tasks, with no great care as to the content. We shall 
herefore select as the basis for the curriculum such studies 
s will fulfil these requirements. They must be difficult 
nough to compel effort, and rigidly enough organized to 
ive sequence and sustained continuity to the work required. 
Il other values give way to these. The concrete or ap- 
lied value of the material is not the determining factor. 
Subject-matter as determined by the disciplinary aim. 
It is this point of view that has made the foreign lan- 
tages, and especially Latin and Greek, the core of the dis- 
iplinary high-school curriculum. Throughout the first 
leveral years of their study their literary content is ob- 
ured by their linguistic demands. Grammatical relations 
re always difficult, and therefore test the powers. Such 
nguistic relations are reasonably exact, and hence require 
ne shades of discrimination. They are organized into a 
onderfully complete logical system, in which part fits to 
rt to construct the marvelous mechanism that we call a 
nguage and it demands effort to master such a system. 
The languages.—If education is conceived as resulting 
‘om putting forth so much effort for its own sake, then 
rtainly the various conjugations and declensions, the end- 
s rules and their exceptions, the cases, moods and tenses,  
-P-A-G-E-102
     ; | s 
88 “CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
  the difficulties of translation and composition—all these 
supply the ideal material for attaining our aim. It will not 
matter that the ancient or modern civilizations may be ap- 
proached more easily and their spirit entered into more com- 
pletely through the medium of one’s mother tongue; for 
hardness and difficulty are precisely what we seek in order 
to “train’’ the effort. It will not matter that the relation of 
the foreign language to one’s own may be arrived at more 
simply and in less time by another method than that of long- 
continued translation or much study of the grammar of 
the foreign language ; the aim is not simplicity and economy 
of time, but difficult requirement to discipline the powers. 
Mathematics.—The same principles apply in the case 
of the abstract phases of mathematics. If, for example, 
arithmetic is to be taught chiefly as a mental discipline rather 
than for ready efficiency in the use of numbers, then we 
shall devote the larger part of the arithmetic time to the| 
solution of problems in unnecessarily difficult analysis rather 
than to drill on the fundamental operations or to practis 
on problems such as arise in the every-day life. If we ar 
controlled by the disciplinary point of view we shall giv 
much time to the mastery and application of algebraic for. 
mulas rather than to the mathematics of business and th 
household. 
For not the knowledge and the skill required in commo: 
experience, but the effects of the effort expended will be th 
measure of the value attained. Indeed it is the relativ: 
lack of content, the exactness of logical organization, an 
the supposed difficulty of mastery that have made mathe 
matics take rank with the languages in the disciplinary cu 
riculum for generations. 
Making even the sciences serve the disciplinary aim. 
Yet the disciplinary aim of education may find its materi 
outside the field of language or mathematics—and doe:    
   
                            
                     
      
 
-P-A-G-E-103
, 
THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF EDUCATION 89 
Even the material sciences may be so treated as to afford a 
minimum of content for a maximum of effort expended in 
their mastery. Let us suppose, for example, that we wish, 
not primarily to give the child concrete knowledge of nature 
as he meets it from day to day in his common life, but seek 
rather through the study of science to “train the mental 
‘faculties.’”” We shall then not start with that part of the 
physical world that is close at hand and can be seen, touched, 
used and handled; for this is too easy and lacks logical ar- 
rangement. On the contrary, we shalt start with the dis- 
tant, the abstract, the logically organized ; we shall first teach 
the “exact,” the “pure” sciences. 
More specifically, if we are teaching the child botany, we 
shall not, if we are guided by, the disciplinary aim, introduce 
him to the great world of growing things all about, but to a 
ew rather uncommon specimens of plants.. These he will 
‘analyze,” and run down in a plant “Key.” He will classify 
hem, label them, and perhaps press them, and preserve 
hem in an herbarium. Of the commonplace flowers and 
lants of his daily environment, and more especially of the 
seful ones, he will learn little or nothing; for such knowl- 
dge would lack rigid classification; it would have content 
alue, and might turn out to possess “utility”; and what 
e are seeking is “discipline.” 
In similar fashion, under the disciplinary aim we shall 
ach for geography, not what lies nearest at hand, but the 
istant and unreal, the small or unusual—a great mass of 
formation lacking practical importance, but requiring 
uch effort in its mastery. In physiology we shall teach the 
inutiz of anatomy, and the intricate but hidden physio- 
ical processes, but omit or neglect the fundamental laws 
health and longevity. And these things are precisely 
at, under the disciplinary aim, we have been doing in 
too many of our schools.      
    
       
     
    
 
-P-A-G-E-104
         
                                           
   
                     90 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT   
Subject-matter as.determined by the social aim—But 
suppose we refuse to subscribe to the disciplinary aim of 
education. Suppose we insist that all this type of education 
we have been describing misses the mark, and that education 
must result in useful knowledge as measured by the day’s 
needs and its problems. Suppose we insist that right atti- 
tudes, interests, ideals and tastes are of prime importance. 
Suppose we demand that practical skills shall be trained. 
What then shall we say about the subject-matter? What 
then shall we teach the child?—We can only say then as we 
said in the former case: The subject-matter must fit the aim. 
If, for example, we agree that a mastery of the “tools” of 
knowledge is of first importance to the child, if we believe 
that certain fundamentals in reading, language, number, 
writing and spelling should early be made automatic and 
certain, then we must teach the kind of material that will 
secure these results instead of other results. We must not 
put our time on abstractions, meaningless definitions or 
empty verbal forms, but on the content that will yield the 
desired skill. The things that are needed are the things 
that must be taught. The skill that is sought must be ob- 
tained through drill in the responses required. 
Material for English—This is to say that the child 
will learn to read his mother tongue by much practise 7 
reading, both silent and oral. This reading will be vital 
stimulating and on matter suited to the interest and capacity 
The child will learn to write and punctuate by much writin 
and punctuating, and not by the mere learning of rules 
Furthermore, the writing and punctuating will be on sucl 
matter as the child has ready to express and is interested ir 
expressing. It will not deal with themes foreign to hi 
knowledge and interest and concerning which he has noth 
ing to say except under the compulsion of the school roo

THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF EDUCATION 91 
His own work, his play, his lessons—the real experience of 
the day’s life will supply the themes for his writing. 
In similar fashion, spelling will be learned, not from a 
spelling book containing from eight to ten thousand words, 
as is the case with the average spelling text of to-day, but 
from the smaller list of words which-actually constitute the 
vocabulary of the child in the grades. Drill and practise 
will be had on these with special attention to the ones likely 
to be misspelled, until their spelling is automatic and secure. 
Number material—The fundamentals of number will 
not be learned through difficult analytical processes beyond 
the grasp of the child, nor by the teaching of complicated 
problems never to be met outside the walls of the school 
room. Difficult and complex fractions with impossible de- 
nominators, and obsolete tables and measures no longer em- 
ployed in business or industry will not be allowed to claim 
time and effort. We shall rather depend on plentiful drill 
on the fundamental operations of subtraction, addition, mul- 
tiplication and division to make these skills automatic and 
‘trustworthy. We shall give abundant practise on concrete, 
sensible problems daily arising in connection with natural 
interests and activities, and by such exercises will make 
number a vital, interesting and useful part of the daily 
experience. 
The same principles will apply in mastering all funda- 
mentals required as instruments in the learning of other sub- 
jects or in the common experiences of the day’s life. One 
of the most necessary problems in education is to discover 
the things that are fundamental in the training of our chil- 
dren and then make sure that these fundamentals are mas- 
tered so completely that their use requires no hesitancy or 
deliberation, and that the skill and certainty of mastery are 
secure,

Content of other subjects—In more advanced subjects 
we must proceed from the same point of view. If, for 
example, we believe that a knowledge of the body and the 
laws of health is the first aim in the teaching of physiology 
and hygiene, we shall then select those phases of physiology 
and hygiene that will result in the particular knowledge de- 
sired. We shall not begin with the names of the bones, the 
classification of tissues, and the intricate physiological and 
chemical processes of digestion and assimilation. We shall, 
rather, deal with th practical and concrete material that 
relates to the aim we veek. 
Tf we conclude that the study of science should result in 
a knowledge of those phases of nature that most constantly 
touch our lives and affect our interests, then we shall find 
the first and most important material for science study in 
the immediate environment of the child and not in the more 
distant laws and principles underlying scientific study. If 
we affirm that a love for reading and the énjoyment of good 
literature are more to be desired than an intimate knowledge 
of literary structure and the laws of literary criticism, then 
we shall emphasize chiefly in our teaching of literature, not 
the canons of literary criticism, but the factors that will lead, 
to appreciation and enjoyment.. We shall make the material 
fit the aim. 
The principle involved—But further illustrations of 
the principle involved are not needed. It is obvious that if 
we would make our teaching fruitful we must first of all 
have a definité aim, and then select as subject-matter such 
content as will realize the aim sought. The problem of se- 
lecting the subject-matter is partly one of administration, 
in the determining of subjects and text-books for use in the 
course of study: It is also partly a question for the indi- 
vidual teacher, who has certain latitude in the selection or

rejection of material within a given text and the choice of 
supplementary matter. 
Distribution of Subject-Matter According to Age, Capacity 
and Interest 
Not only must subject-matter be selected to fit the aims 
of education, it must also be adapted to the age and capacity, 
the experience and interests, of the learner. In obedience 
to this principle it must constantly be kept in mind as was 
stated in an earlier chapter, that we primarily teach pupils 
and not subject-matter. We must never forget that the 
material of the curriculum exists for the children and not 
the children for the subject-matter. 
Adapting the material to the learner.—It is wholly es- 
sential that the subject-matter be adapted to the learner. 
There is no more harmful educational folly than that of 
attempting to force upon children material too advanced for . 
their stage of ability and development. It is a pedagogical 
crime to press upon the minds unready for it the logic of 
grammar or mathematics too difficult for their grasp. It is 
the grossest of educational blunders to teach to young chil- 
dren phases of subject-matter which call for close analysis 
and difficult associative processes when the brain machinery 
is not yet ready for such work. 
The waste growing out of teaching such ill-adapted mate- 
rial comes not alone from inability to master the too difficult 
subject-matter, or from failure to find immediate use for 
it in further study and learning. The waste from such 
sources is sufficiently grievous but it is far exceeded by the 
harm arising from the attitude of discouragement and dis- 
taste for study sure to accompany stich methods. It can 
never be known how many promising careers have been 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
      
  94 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
wrecked by compelling unripe minds to attempt subject- 
matter too difficult, and hence devoid of meaning or the 
possibility of application. 
Material that is too difficult—Our human nature, and 
especially child nature, is so constructed that nothing suc- 
ceeds like success. Nothing heartens and calls forth hidden 
effort like the victory of achievement and the consequent 
sense of power. On the other hand, nothing cripples effort, 
discourages ambition and reduces the amount of available 
power like continued failure and the constant feeling of 
helplessness in the presence of unmastered problems. There 
are in our schools to-day literally thousands of discouraged, 
ambitionless children, floundering in a maze of half-learned 
material, lacking all sense of victory and robbed of the initi- 
ative and endeavor that come from certainty of achieve- 
ment. True, the child must meet difficulties and exert effort 
in order to develop his powers. But the difficulties met 
must be surmountable and they must, at least a reasonable 
proportion of the time, be surmounted if development is to 
follow. 
Probably no one greater weakness can exist in an educa- 
tional system than that of constantly giving pupils either 
(1) too much subject-matter to cover, with too little drill 
and application to render it secure through mastery and use, 
or else (2) giving them matter that is too difficult, thus re~ 
sulting in bewilderment, discouragement, loss of self- 
confidence and consequent failure of interest and enthusi- 
asm in education. 
Material must have point of contact with experience.— 
But not all subject-matter adapted in difficulty to the age 
and capacity of the learner is suitable educational material. 
The subject which claims the child’s interest and effort must 
also be connected with his actual experiences and have im- 
mediate point of contact with his activities. While ideals
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF EDUCATION 95 
are beautiful things, there always exists an element of fal- 
lacy, especially for children, in an ideal that is too distant. 
Even the older ones of us find greater incentive in a reward, 
a necessity, or an interest that lies close at hand. The dis- 
tant reward, the far-off necessity, or the long-deferred com- 
pensation affects us but little. Much more does the child, 
who has not yet learned to exchange the present comfort or 
pleasure for a future good, require the grip of immediate 
interest such as arises from the concrete activities of vital 
experience. 
Every one has noted the enthusiasm and effectiveness 
with which the boy will master the intricate rules and re- 
quirements of a game in which he is ambitious to excel. 
The desire to enter on the construction of some coveted 
article in the manual-training shop has proved for many 
pupils a stronger incentive for the mastery of practical 
arithmetic and drawing than any compulsion that could be 
brought by the teacher. 
All this is, therefore, to say that the subject-matter of the 
curriculum should have the closest possible point of contact 
with actual experiences and needs. It should relate in the 
fullest possible measure to present interests and activities 
and not have merely a promise of future value. 
Applying the principle——Practically applied this point 
of view reenforces that suggested in the preceding section. 
The subject-matter of language should be principally found, 
not in abstract themes or topics but slightly related to im- 
mediate interests and necessities, but rather in such activi- 
ties as the handicraft, the home enterprises, the social inter- 
ests or the play activities of the pupils. Arithmetic should 
be an instrument demanded in the solution of immediately 
present problems in agriculture and garden projects, manual 
training, home economics or other real interests in the day’s 
life. Reading and literature should appeal to interests and

enthusiasms present in the life and ready to be drawn upon. 
Geography should start with that portion of the earth’s 
surface which lies nearest at hand, and most closely identi- 
fied with the learner’s interest. 
Such a selection of the subject-matter as will adapt it to 
the child in place of seeking to force the child into a ready- 
made or mechanically devised system of studies is one of 
the most insistent problems in education. Its solution should 
engage the attention of all students of psychology and the 
science of education. It should occupy the thought and 
claim the ability of administrators of education everywhere. 
‘It should appeal to the individual teacher as one of his hard- 
est problems and greatest opportunities. 
The Selection of Subject-Matter 
In the actual practise of class-room instruction, the selec- 
tion of material presents many difficulties. A teacher may 
have a very clear aim for his subject and know the particular 
material which will accomplish the aim sought, and yet be 
hampered by a text-book (or even by a course of study!) 
whose material is but ill adapted to the purpose in view. 
With a given text-book in the hands of the pupil it is some- 
what difficult to offer a line of subject-matter differing in 
any considerable degree from that presented in the text. 
One may admit that American text-books are on the whole 
skilfully made and yet say that many texts found in our 
schools fail grievously of being in accord with our best 
aims and ideals in education. 
Text-books with unsuitable material—For example, 
not a few of the texts in arithmetic still feature relatively 
obsolete and useless subject-matter at the expense of prac- 
tical drills and concrete problems related to the child’s school 
and home activities. Many of our spelling books yet offer
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF EDUCATION 97 
from ten to fifteen thousand words for the child to master, 
whereas his writing vocabulary usually includes only about 
two to four thousand words. Many text-books in history 
feature political and military achievements far beyond social 
and industrial progress. Widely used texts in the natural 
sciences frequently emphasize theoretical problems rather 
than the concrete problems daily met in the life of the aver- 
age person. Many of the popular language books still stress 
formal grammar and linguistic puzzles instead of practise 
in the use of oral and written speech. 
This problem is to be met in two different ways. First, 
by the. selection of texts, which is a matter not for the 
teacher alone but also for school superintendents and 
boards. It should be a part of our training in the field of 
education to know text-books and their structure so thor- 
oughly that we can with certainty judge their adaptability 
to the use desired of them. Then we shall not find our- 
selves at the mercy of unscrupulous agents of book houses 
whose business it is to introduce their particular text against 
all competitors, or to hold it in use when it should be dis- 
placed. 
Selecting material through stress and neglect.—But 
even admitting the limitations placed on teachers by the 
necessity of using certain texts, there is still a wide latitude 
possible to every teacher. This is to be attained through 
the stress or neglect which can be applied to the material 
found within the text, and through supplementing it by out- 
side material. It is true that some schools require of teach- 
ers that they shall cover a certain number of pages in a 
given text, page by page, within a term and fit children to 
pass an examination on this material. Where such rules are 
iron-clad unhappy indeed is the teacher who has ideals of 
his own. Every teacher who is qualified to handle a room 
should be allowed reasonable latitude in ‘the selection of
-P-A-G-E-112
  \ iA 
98 ChLasséhooM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
material, and then held responsible for results in knowledge 
and training rather than for the covering of so many pages 
of a given text. 
Where this latitude is allowed, a teacher may change the 
matter of a course vastly by ignoring unfruitful material 
found in the text and supplementing it with material now 
easily available from a hundred sources for practically every 
line of instruction found in our curriculum. It is evident 
therefore that two different teachers using the same text 
can still teach widely divergent material by making use of 
this power of selection and rejection. But in order to use 
such power wisely the teacher’s aim must be clear, his 
knowledge of the field must be broad and accurate, and his 
concept of the purpose sought in the life of the child 
through his instruction must be so definite as to admit of no 
obscurity or mistake. 
Summarizing our discussion, we find that there is a new 
interest arising in the question of the best subject-matter 
for our schools. The doctrine of formal discipline is losing 
its hold. New material is asserting its claims. The cur- 
riculum is undergoing far-reaching changes. Traditional 
subjects are having to fight their place. Obsolete and use- 
less matter is being swept away. 
Two principles must guide in working out the new cur- 
riculum: First, the material must be consciously and ex- 
plicitly selected to meet the aim we set up for modern edu- 
cation: Nothing is to be admitted for its traditional value 
or because it is good form to study it. All material given 
our children to learn must be able to show a direct and con- 
crete relation to present-day needs and demands. Second, 
the subject-matter of the curriculum must be adapted to the 
age, ability and interests of the pupils. It must fit their 
minds and fit their lives.
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF EDUCATION 99 
The readjustment of material to meet these demands sets 
a problem for text-book makers in furnishing texts with the 
right material; for school authorities in selecting suitable 
text-books; and for teachers in selecting the best material 
through the use of emphasis or neglect within available texts 
and courses of study. The question of what we put into the 
curriculum is all important. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Consider the material found in the older type of text-book 
on arithmetic or grammar. How much of this matter do you esti- 
mate depends for its value on the “discipline” it may afford? Judge 
the material you are now teaching by the same test. What propor- 
tion of it has direct bearing on the real conduct and experience of 
your pupils? 
2. Just what material of that you are now teaching do you think 
should be left out, and better material substituted? Can you, by 
“stress and neglect,” accomplish this in part? Are you teaching any 
texts that you think should be changed for texts presenting more 
vital material? 
3. Have you any classes or any pupils who are studying material 
that is beyond their age or grasp? If so, can you judge whether the 
material is primarily at fault, or something in the ability or prepa- 
ration of the pupils? In either case, what should be done about it? 
4. What have you found to be the effect on the attitude and in- 
terest of the child to give him. material too far beyond his grasp? 
Have you known children to quit school because of discouragement 
from such cause? Have you known teachers who prided themselves 
on the proportion of their pupils they “failed”? What is your judg- 
ment on the question? 
5. A certain boy in a Chicago school was made over from a lag- 
gard to.a leader in drawing and arithmetic by being told that he 
might begin to make in the manual-training shop a coveted piece of 
furniture when he had sufficiently mastered the computation and 
drawing required in the construction. Can you apply the psycho- 
logical principle that “motivated” his study to subjects you are 
teaching, such as language, agriculture, arithmetic, etc.?

  CHAPTER VIII 
THE ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 
FTER the selection of material come its organization 
Aina presentation. Thus, to recapitulate, the cycle of 
teaching method is completed—first the aim of the whole 
educational process, next the proper subject-matter for the 
attainment of the aim, then the best organization of the 
subject-matter chosen, and finally the presentation, or teach- 
ing, of this material in the recitation. The present chapter 
will consider the principles that underlie the organization of 
material for instruction. 
The place of organization in method.—By organiza- 
tion is meant the ordering and arranging of subject- 
matter for study (by the pupil) and for presentation (by 
the teacher). The problem of the right organization of 
material is hardly second in importance to that of the wise 
selection of the material itself. For even the richest and 
most fruitful subject-matter can be rendered all but useless 
by faulty organization. ‘Indeed so faulty is much of the 
organization of the material of our courses of study and 
text-books that it requires very radical reorganization quite 
as much as the content needs revision. é 
Two types of organization.—Subject-matter may be 
organized from two fundamentally different points of view 
—the logical and the psychological. We shall next proceed 
to an examination of these two points of view. 
100
-P-A-G-E-115
  \ 
THE ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 101 
Logical Organization of Material 
The most fundamental difference between the logical and 
the psychological orgenization of subject-matter grows out 
of the standpoint or purpose from which the organization 
proceeds. Logical organization definitely and professedly 
has the subject-matter in mind; psychological organization 
just as definitely has the learner in mind. The logical organ- 
ization of subject-matter arranges its material in divisions, 
sections, chapters, paragraphs and the like wholly in accord- 
ance with the logical demands of matter so organized, There 
is no thought of arranging the material in the easiest and 
most natural order for the purpose of its being grasped by 
the immature mind. The exigencies of the material so pre- 
dominate that the interests, aptitudes and methods of the 
learner are not taken into account. 
Logical organization considers only the material—The 
logical arrangement of material is the arrangement of the 
adult, the scholar, the expert, the master in his field of 
knowledge. This arrangement fits the mind which has cov- 
ered and assimilated all the material and has it firmly in its 
grasp, wholly summed up and completed. Such a mind is 
not of course concerned with the problem of learning the 
material; the learning has, for this mind, already been ac- 
complished. The problem is simply that of taking so much 
finished matter and fitting it part to part, section to section, 
relation to relation, and system to system, making sure all 
the time that the demands of logic are fully met in the 
organization effected. 
The logical arrangement of subject-matter is essentially 
deductive. It reverses the mind’s genetic mode of pro- 
cedure and begins with the most general, complete and
-P-A-G-E-116
  102 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
abstract. It offers first the rules, general principles and 
definitions as dogmatic statements. They are so many fin- 
ished bits of truths to be accepted and learned. The logical 
systeni then proceeds to apply these generalizations to par- 
ticular cases or individual instances. Logical organization 
encourages the acceptance of authority rather than induct- 
ively leading to a mastery of facts through investigation on 
the part of the learner. It offers information ready-made 
instead of leading the way to discovery. It forces the child 
into the methods and systems of thought of the finished 
scholar, thereby doing violence to the order of nature. 
Older texts organized on logical plan.—All the earlier 
courses of study and school texts were organized on the 
logical plan. This was not strange at a time when the child 
was still looked on as a “pocket edition” of a man, and child 
psychology not thought of as in any essential way being 
different from the psychology of adults. And the methou 
of organization thus started persisted with certain modifica’ 
tions until the advent of child study and genetic psychology, 
some twenty years ago. Since that time the logical method 
has-been gradually giving way, until we have to-day many 
texts written from the psychological (i. e., the learner’s) 
view-point. 
So firm a hold has the logical concept secured on educa- 
tional thought, however, that many publishers yet think it 
good business to advertise their elementary texts as “logical 
in arrangement. ” Probably more than half the texts now 
used in the elementary school are either wholly logical in 
the organization of their ‘material, or else the organization 
is so poor a compromise between the logical and the psycho- 
logical as not to be of the highest usefulness. 
Logical organization in physiology texts.—A few con- 
crete illustrations will render more clear what is meant by 
the logical arrangement of texts. A certain elementary

    physiology, which has had wide use in the schools, has for 
its first lesson “Bones in General.” ‘The lesson opens with 
a definition of the skeleton. Then follow such topics as 
number of bones, and so on, with two figures of the human 
skeleton from which the names and locations of the bones 
are to be learned. Since bones are the “framework” of the 
body it is assumed that they must also be the foundation of 
the child’s study of physiology, regardless of the fact that 
one never sees his bones and has very little to do with them! 
A more recent and altogether better text opens with the 
question of why one gets hungry, why food is needed, when 
and what to eat, how to secure pure water and milk, etc. 
The first text organizes what is known about the anatomy 
of the human body into a perfectly logical array of facts; 
the second considers what is the child’s most natural ap- 
proach to the subject of nutrition and growth, and begins 
at that point. The first presents a logical organization ; the 
second, a psychological. 
Another “logical” elementary physiology begins with 
cells, fibers, organs, tissues, chemical elements. Nearly all 
these logically arranged texts on elementary physiology in- 
troduce the children to a study of their bodies by a frontis- 
piece or first picture of a skeleton! 
Other illustrations of logical organization.—The geog- 
raphy of the old type, built on the logical plan, started with 
la definition of the science of geography, introduced the 
hild to the world as a sphere floating in space, came next 
o “grand divisions,” then to continents, then to countries, 
nd so on perchance finally down to the home place of the 
hild himself. The psychological order, reversing this 
ethod of organization, would begin with the home place 
nd work out to the more remote. 
The older types of language and grammar texts, organ- 
zed on a severely logical basis, started the child on the
-P-A-G-E-118
     
          4 i 
V ANAgESENT rf ' 
study of his mother tongue throug! parsing, declensions, 
analysis and diagramming sentences. The child’s natural 
tendency to the wse of speech, and his facility in securing 
correct language forms and good diction through imitation 
of worthy models were entirely neglected. Indeed a number 
of widely used language texts of the present day begin with 
definitions of language, of the sentence, of parts of speech 
or other such concepts wholly foreign and-irrelevant to the 
child at this stage of his study. Others introduce the child 
almost at once to the analysis of sentences, the mysteries of 
various kinds of complements, and the vague relations of 
different types of modifiers. 
So we might go on with the other branches as well. Prac- 
tically all the subjects at one time or another had their 
text-books written from the logical point of view. Even 
so new a branch as agriculture has a number of its texts 
displaying on their early pages chemical formulas relating 
to soil analysis, food elements, the chemical composition of 
plants, etc. This plan of organization was adopted not be- 
cause the child knows chemistry at this stage or needs it in 
beginning the study of agriculture, but because the writer 
knew chemistry and wrote the text from his own point of 
view instead of the child’s. 
Not material but organization at fault.—It is not to be 
understood that in condemning the logical type of text we 
are also condemning all the material or topics referred to 
in our illustrations. We are rather dealing here with the 
order, or arrangement of material and hence the time or 
stage when certain matter shall be presented. For example 
the student of physiology must finally come to know about 
cells, fibers, tissues and chemical elements. But he should 
not begin with them; they belong to the high school. He 
needs to know about the earth as a sphere floating in space, 
about the inclination of its axis and its effect on seasons, 104 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 105 
about continental divisions, etc. But these are not the best 
starting points for geography. He needs to know parsing, 
declensions, analysis of sentences, and parts of speech. But 
such things, instead of making a favorable start for the 
study of language, should come in at a later stage. 
Psychological Organization of Subject-Matter 
Summing up the criticisms of the preceding section, the 
organization of subject-matter should be primarily psycho- 
logical rather than logical. This is but to say that the mind 
of the learner and not the logical relations of matter should 
dictate the order and arrangement. The mind’s natural 
modes of working, and the laws of its genetic development 
instead of the relations involved in certain fields of knowl- 
edge should govern in the planning of courses of study and 
in the organizing of teaching material. 
Why use the psychological organization. —This posi- 
tion holds true because of the obvious psychological fact that 
the child’s mind works best in accordarice with its own inner 
laws of activity. None can doubt that any mind is less 
effective and its development hampered if.forced out of its 
natural processes. When we compel the mental activities 
of a child to adapt themselves to the artificial arrangement 
demanded by a rigidly logical organization of material, we 
have committed a grave psychological blunder. We have 
caused a waste of time, forced the sacrifice of interest and 
compelled a reduction of efficiency. 
Generalizing the principles just stated, the point at which 
the course of study and each subject in it should begin is 
las nearly as possible at the point then reached in the child’s 
life, interests and capacities. To secure successful instruc- 
ion we must establish what DuBois calls a “point of con- 
act” in our instruction. We must make use of the child’s
-P-A-G-E-120
    106 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND ‘MANAGEMENT 
f , 
readiness, curiosity and enthusiasm for investigation and 
mastery of whatever lies close to his own activities. We 
must build upon the foundation of knowledge already at- 
tained, and leave no gap between the actual life of real 
affairs, in which the child is an active participant, and what 
we undertake to teach him in the school room. 
Relation of organization to attitude and motive.—This 
point of view if successfully carried out in our teaching 
will serve to stimulate and give motive force to education 
in a way impossible under the logical organization of in- 
struction. Every teacher of experience has been impressed 
with the change in attitude, interest and effort when the 
subject-matter of a recitation has suddenly changed from 
abstract theoretical points widely separated from the ex- 
perience of the children, and attached itself to matters cf 
immediate and vital interest related to the genuine expe- 
riences of home or school. 
Subject-matter appropriated in accordance with psycho- 
logical requirements also has a degree of unity and a vital 
meaning, impossible under the logical system. This is be- 
cause the mind can not easily appropriate nor can it fruit- 
fully use matter widely divorced from the real motives and 
thought processes constantly in use. This distant material, 
however well organized may be the logical system from 
which it comes, does not form an organic and logical sys- 
tem of knowledge in the mind of the child. On the contrary 
it is broken, scrappy, unrelated, and because of this fact not 
effective either as a basis for further learning or for use 
in directing present activities. The mistake is often made 
of assuming that because certain material is arranged in 
logical form it is therefore logical (i. e., a related system) 
to the child. Only when the child has been able to grasp 
the relationships does the matter take on a logical quality 
to him.
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 107 
Practical application of psychological organization.— 
The principle involved in the psychological arrangement of 
subject-matter has application (1) to the arrangement or 
sequence of subjects in the curriculum; (2) to the organiza- 
tion of the material within text-books, outlines and courses 
of study for each branch; and (3) to the mode of approach 
to each section of material or each day’s lesson. 
The order of subjects in the curriculum.—The arrange- 
ment or order of subjects in the curriculum itself should 
be psychological instead of logical. This would require that 
the first subjects met by the child as he enters school should 
be those closest to his actual interests, needs and activities. 
In accordance with this requirement the earliest studies in 
the primary school should not be the abstract symbols in- 
volved in reading and number. The introductory branches 
of instruction should be founded in the social activities car- 
ried over from the home life to the school. The child’s 
interest in work and play and in the things round about 
him suggests the fundamental material for the first school 
grades. In violation of this principle, however, it is still 
common in many schools to find that the greater part of 
the first two years of school are spent on learning the sym- 
bols of reading, numbers and language. The concrete ac- 
tivities and the great world of nature are relatively ignored 
in favor of the abstract and symbolic forms of knowledge. 
The first year in the high school affords a similar illus- 
tration of the violation of the psychological principle in 
arranging the course of study. In the typical high school 
the child has no branch of study carrying over from the 
elementary school to serve as a bridge, safely to conduct 
him over into his new realm of experience. On the other 
hand he is required to begin the study of algebra, the most 
abstract of mathematical subjects, the rigid grammar of 
Latin and the composition phase of the study of the mother
-P-A-G-E-122
rt Wat trre i i 
108 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
tongue. Thus from one-half to three-fourths of his work 
is of such nature that it is very completely divorced from 
any previous knowledge or from any present interests and 
activities outside of the classes concerned. It lacks “point 
of contact.” ; 
Some attempt has been made to remedy this unfavorable 
condition by introducing a combined course in mathematics 
involving concrete phases of geometry and arithmetic along 
with the algebraic symbols. Relief has also been sought 
by modifying the first year of the study of Latin so as to 
relate it more closely to English speech, and also afford more 
opportunity for the reading of Latin, with a corresponding 
reduction in the amount of technical grammar required. 
The first year of English in the high school is being changed 
to make it include a larger measure of literature and a 
smaller amount of general composition. The composition 
work itself has also been modified in the direction of mak- 
ing it correlate more directly with the other school subjects 
and with the interests of the pupils. In the same general 
direction an experiment is being made with a course in gen- 
eral science. The aim is to develop the pupil’s interest and 
knowledge with reference to those aspects of the physical 
world which lie closest to him, rather than to introduce him 
at once to the more rigid and broader generalizations of 
science. f 
The order of material in each subject.—The effects of 
the psychological principle applied to the subject-matter of 
the different branches have already been suggested in the 
preceding section on the logical organization of material. 
Tt will only be necessary here to offer a few illustrations of 
its application to the subjects of the curriculum. 
This principle applied to the subject of geography will 
mean that the child shall begin, not with the larger land |  
-P-A-G-E-123

THE ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 109 
forms, with mathematical questions concerning inclination 
of the earth’s axis, or with general facts concerning the 
earth as a sphere; but he will start with the homestead, the 
school grounds, the neighborhood, the rivers, valleys and | 
hills near it, and with the products and peoples connected 
with the life and interests of the learner. From this begin- 
ning, his knowledge and interests will be led on outward 
to include finally the world and its people. 
In similar manner the child’s mastery of numbers will 
not commence with definitions of notation and numeration, 
nor with abstract number combinations, nor with artificial 
problems dealing with fanciful conditions foreign to his ex- 
perience. On the other hand it will begin with the actual 
need of counting, computing and finding the numerical re- 
lations among objects met in every-day life and activity. 
Securing immediate points of contact—Language 
study will have its starting point not in rules and principles 
of composition, nor in abstract grammatical relations, but 
in real vital expression, in oral or written speech which deals 
with the interests, needs and ideas of the child himself. 
The study of physiology will not start with matters of 
anatomy, physiological chemistry, nor with any other distant 
concept having no immediate relation to the child’s life; it 
will begin with questions of food, growth, exercise, breath- 
ing and like matters concerning the pupil’s present life and 
physical welfare. 
The study of agriculture will begin with the farm crops, 
gardens and animals found at the homes of the pupils or 
in the immediate vicinity. From these concrete beginnings 
based on real affairs and genuine interests it will extend 
until it has reached the broader facts and principles on 
which the science depends. In like manner the study of 
manual training, instead of requiring long practise on va-
-P-A-G-E-124
    Fee I ug 
110 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND eee ee 
  rious exercises in making joints which are never used to 
join the parts of any real article, will start with the making 
of some simple article which itself contains the joints in 
question, thus adding motive and reality to the work. 
Applied to spelling, the psychological principle will de- 
mand that the child be taught to spell not a haphazard, mis- 
cellaneous list of words having no direct relation to his need 
for them, but on the other hand his spelling will deal with 
the words which are then and there being employed by the 
pupil in his daily writing of lessons, letters and whatever 
material is used in his written work. | 
The organization of each day’s lesson.—In like manner 
should the psychological principle of organization be ex- 
tended to the preparation of any section of material, or 
any day’s lesson for instruction. The great question is not 
how this particular bit of material will best fit into some 
outline or classification which will look well in a note-book 
or upon a blackboard, but how it can best be arranged so 
that it can be grasped, assimilated and applied by the learn- 
ers. The teacher is to take his stand with the pupil, see 
things through his eyes, and approach them through his men- 
tal processes when he constructs his lesson plans. He will 
make use of the principle of apperception, starting with what 
the child already knows and is interested in. From this van- 
tage point he will proceed on out into the related new and 
unknown.

Meeting Point of the Logical and the Psychological 
It must not be supposed from the preceding discussion 
that the logical and the psychological order are always and 
irrevocably opposed. On the contrary they tend finally to 
become identical. This is because the developing mind as 
it masters its world of knowledge and learns the technique    
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE ORGANIZATION OF ers cun eee lil 
of thinking naturally organizes and classifies its knowledge 
in a logical system. 
Growth toward the logical—lIt is not to be understood 
that there is any virtue in presenting to the child an illogical 
or haphazard system of facts to be learned. On the con- 
trary, all matter taught should be as logically organized 
as the child’s development and grasp will at that stage per- 
mit him to utilize. It is to be understood, however, that 
the logical organization is constantly to proceed in accord- 
ance with the child’s broadening grasp and experience, and 
not be controlled by any considerations inhering in the facts 
themselves. 
Restating the position, we may say that the child’s psycho- 
logical order constantly tends toward the logical. The or- 
ganization of the subject-matter of his instruction should 
keep step in the same direction and assist in the process, 
but should never outstrip it and become an end in itself. 
Summing up our discussion, we have seen that it is as 
important that material shall be well organized as that it 
shall be wisely selected. We are at present in the stage of 
passing over from the logical to the psychological organiza- 
tion of the curriculum. Logical organization ignores the 
genetic principle of education and is governed by the de- 
mands of the material. The psychological gradually moves 
in the direction of the logical, and the two finally tend to 
become one for the trained thinker. Material organized to 
fit the demands of the child’s mind is more easily learned, 
stimulates greater interest and response, and fits more di- 
rectly into the general body of the learner’s experience. 
The principles of psychological organization apply to the 
arrangement of subjects in the course of study, to the order 
and treatment of topics in a text-book, and to the teacher’s 
plan for each day’s study and recitations.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Make an examination of the texts you teach to determine the 
type of their organization. Do they begin with the general and ab- 
stract, with rules, definitions and principles, with matter that is far 
removed from the experience and activities of the child—or the 
opposite? } 
2. In preparing your lesson plans do you consciously and defi- 
nitely plan to secure a natural and simple mode of approach for the 
child? That is, do you have the child or the material in mind when 
you organize your material? 
3. Are you clear as to what is meant by the “inductive method”? 
Can you apply it to geography, civics, language, nature study, etc., as 
well as to arithmetic? Does the child naturally approach all his 
learning inductively? ; 
4. What in your judgment are the qualities that make a good 
text-book? A poor text-book? When you go to inspect a new text- 
book what do you first look for? Do you feel that your judgment 
is well enough grounded so that you would be justified in making a 
selection of texts for your school? Ought a teacher to train to this 
ability? : 
5. A mechanically organized lesson is often easier to present 
than a lesson organized on psychological lines. Why is this? Which 
is the harder factor in teaching, the material or the child?

  CHAPTER IX 
THE TECHNIQUE OF INSTRUCTION 
ITH one’s aim clear, and the material selected and “ 
\ \ organized, he is then ready for presentation of this 
material in the recitation. The principles underlying the 
presentation of the subject-matter in the recitation are so 
broad and varied that they are impossible of full treatment 
in the brief space of a single chapter. Furthermore, in- 
struction must constantly be. modified in its details and 
methods to suit both the subject and the age and degree 
of advancement of the pupils; for every subject has its own 
particular problems and every class its own special needs 
and peculiarities. All that can be accomplished, therefore, 
in the brief type of treatment we have in mind is to suggest 
certain principles which underlie all good instruction and 
will in general apply to all subjects. 
Personal Factors Depending on the Teacher 
Instruction. is the most peculiarly personal of all of the 
teacher’s functions. When the teacher presents subject-mat- 
ter to the class the pupils think, understand and master, not 
the subject-matter alone as such, but this material as it is 
shaped and colored by the teacher’s point of view, and satu-~ 
rated with the teacher’s personality. Indeed, it is the person- 
ality of the teacher that gives much of the subject-matter 
its very spirit and life. To be a good instructor, there- 
fore, the teacher must first of all possess that intangible 
something that is called personality.

  Personality a factor in instruction—Because of its 
marvelous complexity and its variable qualities in different 
individuals personality can not be strictly defined; yet it 
is in no small degree subject to analysis, and is thoroughly 
cultivatable. Personality develops from day to day in the 
ordinary processes of our lives. 
Physical aspects of personality. First of all, person- 
ality has its physical aspect. The person whose physical 
poise, bearing and dignity are impressive has a great ad- 
vantage over one of opposite qualities when he confronts 
his class. The bowed form and stooping shoulders, the 
slouching and shuffling gait, the slack and awkward posture, 
or the careless and ill-kept attire all go to subtract very 
definitely from effective teaching power. 
The intellectual quality in personality. Personality is 
also an intellectual quality. None have failed to notice 
the difference between a magnetic and stimulating type of 
mentality and the opposite. All have felt the arousing, 
inspiring and enlivening effects that radiate from ‘the fresh- 
ness of the vitally alert mind. On the other hand none have 
failed to note the deadening and depressing intellectual in- 
fluence that comes from association with a mind that lacks 
the vital spark. 
Such differences in the intellectual personality come not 
alone from differences in native ability, but probably even 
more from the quality of interests and the general trend 
of the thought life. The live and stimulating mind is the 
mind that is awake to a broad range of human interests 
which serve to fire the imagination, stir the enthusiasm and 
make one more generally and completely alive. This type 
of mind occupies itself with the real and pressing problems 
of life, concerned with them both for its own welfare and 
for that of its neighbors. 
   
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE TECHNIQUE OF INSTRUCTION 115 
The quality of human sympathy. Personality also in- 
cludes the quality of human sympathy. The person whose 
mental processes consist mainly of logical trains of thought, 
who possesses insight and high-grade intellectual ability, 
but who is lacking in sympathy and the ability to enter 
into other people’s interests and experiences, lacks one of 
the most necessary qualities of the teacher. This is espe- 
cially true for the teacher of children, whose mental life 
unfolds freely and naturally only in an atmosphere of kind- 
liness, sympathy and good will. Many children are cowed, 
disconcerted and put at their worst in the presence of an un- 
sympathetic personality that towers up and over them. The 
remedy for the cold personality of this type is of course to 
cultivate the sympathetic side of the nature. 
The teacher’s educational equipment.—After the fun- 
damental question of personality comes next that of the 
teacher’s grounding educationally. This includes not alone 
a thorough mastery of the subjects he teaches, but also a 
broad background of knowledge, interests and appreciations 
covering a wide range of affairs. There is no more cer- 
tain fact bearing on instruction than that no teacher can 
successfully teach all he knows. One who lacks in either 
breadth or depth of preparation is obliged to teach without 
perspective, and is unable to give the vital touch of mean- 
ing and application in his teaching which can come only 
from wide knowledge, outlook and experience. 
The teacher must also possess deep devotion to his work. 
Its value.and dignity must impress him. His ambition and 
nthusiasm must be gripped and compelled by the oppor- 
unities of the class room. Our human nature is so con- 
tituted that our powers are exerted to the full only under 
he stimulus of some worthy cause or necessity that de- 
nds the best there is in us. One, therefore, who looks on

116 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
his work as something insignificant or unimportant has by 
this very fact limited to a very appreciable degree the 
amount of ability he can put into his instruction. 
Need for clear thinking —The teacher must be a clear 
thinker, whose mind is capable of carrying a considerable 
range of points at one time. This is to say that in order to 
make a good presentation one must have in mind the whole 
plan of the lesson, and must know at any given moment 
in the recitation just what stage has been reached in these 
points and what points remain in order to round out and 
perfect the field of information. Questions, explanations 
and supplementary information must always be based on 
the answers, discussions and facts that have already been 
brought out in the lesson. 
The teacher must be able to note at a glance any flagging 
interest, doubtful comprehension, troubling question, or other 
indications of what is passing in the minds and experience 
of his class. Mischief or indifference which pass unob- 
served in the class room are evidence that the teacher either 
has not mastered the technique of instruction, or else that 
his own mind possesses such limitations that he is unable 
to keep close track of the human element in the class while 
at the same time manipulating the subject-matter of instruc- 
tion. 
     
   
    
    
            
      
   
    The Technique of Instruction 
Probably all teachers could greatly increase their effective- 
ness in instruction by diligent study of the technique of 
their work. Certainly many teachers fail of rendering high 
service from lack of good technique. 
Good instruction requires the use of certain psychologica’ 
factors. First of all it should be recognized that no excel. 
lence of preparation on the part of the teacher, no perfec
-P-A-G-E-131
  " 
THE TECHNIQUE OF INSTRUCTION 117 
   
                                                  
     
    
       tion of organization of material, or no factor of any other 
kind will accomplish suitable results if interest and attention 
are lacking on the part of the class. This simple psycholog- 
ical fact, which is so obvious as to be a truism, is never- 
theless not made the foundation of instruction in many a 
class room. And no matter how excellent the teacher or 
how successful his work in general, there is no one who 
has not had the experience of moments, or even whole 
class periods, when interest seemed at ebb and when atten- 
tion and alertness were hard to claim. 
Commanding concentration—The mind is so organ- 
ized that it is wholly impossible to accomplish any worthy 
results without that concentration of its energy which we 
call a state of attention. For a teacher to continue his in- 
struction with any considerable portion of his class inatten- 
tive, uninterested or manifesting only a polite indifference is 
worse than useless. _Whatever may be the cause of this 
condition the condition itself must be relieved if it is to be 
worth while to continue the instruction. Not only do such 
conditions defeat the immediate purpose of the recitation, 
but they also encourage and cultivate one of the worst of 
mental habits, namely, that of inattention and indifference. 
The effects of attitude—Not less necessary than in- 
terest is the spirit of cooperation and good will. The 
moods, and indeed the whole emotional side of the mind, 
re so closely connected with the intellectual processes that 
it is impossible for thought to be its best with adverse emo- 
ional currents working counter to it. A spirit of hostility, 
itterness or dislike toward the teacher is entirely certain 
0 cripple the effects of his instruction. 
This does not mean that the teacher must therefore be 
asy, slack or haphazard in his work in order not to arouse 
ntagonism. First of all, such standards on the part of 
he teacher will lose him the respect of the class, and when 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
    118 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT ‘ae. 
respect goes, cooperation and responsiveness are not long 
in following. Let the teacher be strong and consistent, let 
him maintain high standards of excellence in preparation 
and in the recitation, but let him not work with his pupils 
in the spirit of a critic, constantly giving the impression 
that he is seeking to discover flaws and to trap the unwary. 
Let him avoid giving the impression that he is a hunter after 
faults and weaknesses, and that children are his legitimate 
prey. On the other hand let him constantly manifest, even 
when most stern and severe in his requirements, the spirit 
of helpfulness, comradeship and good will that should pre- 
vail among those who are working together for a common 
end. 
Moral effects of cooperation.—Not only will this atti- 
tude in instruction tend to create an atmosphere favorable 
to the growth and development of young minds, but it will 
also serve to remove the temptation to insincerity and eva- 
sion on the part of many children. In not a few children 
is the habit developed of trying to cover up weaknesses, 
failures or lack of mastery. They feel that they are out 
of sympathy with the teacher, and that it is-safer not to 
allow their failures to become known. From this attitude 
to the recognized art of “bluffing” is but a step, and a most 
natural one. Under the best conditions of instruction the 
child will feel that he not only can, but should, come. to 
the teacher with any troublesome problem or unmastered| 
section of his lesson, seeking such sympathy, advice, help- 
fulness or instruction as may be required. 
Good teaching chiefly inductive—In the presentation 
of material as well as in its organization the psychological 
order is tobe followed. This is equivalent to saying that 
the inductive instead of the deductive method will in general 
characterize good elementary instruction. The child wil

   learn by investigation and experiment that the area of a 
triangle is found by multiplying its base by half its altitude, 
and the rule will follow instead of preceding the grasping 
of this fact. He will come to understand the mystery of 
the fertilization of the plant by watching the bees with pol- 
len-laden feet, or by examining the drifting pollen from 
corn-field or orchard; out of these individual observations 
and experiences, guided by the teacher, the wider general- 
izations will come. Inductive teaching secures the double 
advantage of following the child’s natural method of learn- 
ing, and of training in observation and investigation by di- 
rect contact with things. 
The inductive process requires that we begin with con- 
crete cases and individual instances. But we are not to 
stop with them; they are to be followed on through to gen- 
eral conclusions and to applications. Inductive teaching does 
not start a new topic with rules or definitions, which are 
always generalizations. On the other hand, after leading the 
child, through the individual examples and concrete Cases, 
to understand the general principles involved we should, 
except in the lowest grades, bring him to form his own 
rules and definitions. Once these are understood in such a 
way the learner can then proceed to use them deductively 
by applying them to still other instances in this particular 
field. Having formed his own rules and definitions he feels 
the strength and certainty that come from mastery; fur- 
thermore, he so thoroughly understands the principle, rule 
or definition with which he works that it is not, as so many 
rules and definitions are, mere verbal lumber in his mind. 
n the contrary, they become an organizing, effective, work- 
ing instrument leading to independence and originality of 
hought. 
Building on the known.—The principle of apperception

must also be constantly employed in our instruction. This 
is only to say that the new must constantly be built on the 
foundation of related old, so that the matter learned shall 
form a continuous and organic whole in the mind of the 
child. | 
One of the greatest of class-room faults is the teaching 
of new material without giving it a foundation and point of 
attachment with related matter already in the mind. This 
false system of teaching results in isolated bits of informa- 
tion, curious but meaningless sets of facts, and an endless 
number of unrelated details which never really function in 
the thought, and hence play no part in the true end of edu- 
cation. The aim of our instruction is not so much informa- 
tion or knowledge as such, but a series of related truths 
which play a real part in guiding action and determining 
conduct. 
     
     
                
   
    
   
    
     
    
    Methods Employed in Presentation 
The skilful teacher must be able to use a variety of meth- 
ods in his instruction. No one plan of presentation can be 
successfully used day after day in any class room. The very 
monotony and lack of variety will tend to cripple interest 
and to lessen attention. There are, however, certain meth- 
ods of instruction which are better adapted to some stages, 
of development and to some subjects than to others. 
The TN, prid-anicwres method.—What we com- 
monly call in the school-room parlance the question-and- 
answer method is the foundation of all elementary teaching. 
This is the famous Socratic method by which the immorta 
Greek teacher led his pupils inductively, step by step, int 
new realms of knowledge without himself telling them th 
facts or aL sles involved. By such method he not onl 
secured to them the desired knowledge, but, perhaps of eve   
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE TECHNIQUE OF INSTRUCTION 121 
more value, he trained them in a method and habit of 
thought that led them to become independent thinkers and 
investigators in their own right. 
The question-and-answer method can be fruitfully used 
in the development of all new topics where the new is to be 
connected with the old in the mind of the learner. Espe- 
cially is this method adapted to those who are still in the 
stage where they need to be trained in methods of study 
and thinking. At its best the question-and-answer process 
of instruction is a half formal conversation between teacher 
and class. The teacher directs the conversation, perhaps 
even dominates it, but never monopolizes it. Each succeed- 
ing question grows out of the preceding question and the 
answer thereto in the mastery and development of the topic. 
The art of good questioning.—The teacher’s questions 
must be clear and definite in meaning so that they may be 
understood. The indefinite question leads to guessing on 
the part of the pupil and can not have other thah an in- 
definite answer. In order to be clear the questions must 
be in simple terms and be brief and concise, that they may 
be easily grasped and held in the mind while the answer is 
being formulated. 
In skilful questioning the teacher is not bound to a text- 
book, but is able while following the outline of the assigned 
lesson to broaden the topic and enrich it from his greater 
knowledge and mastery. The teacher’s manner and bearing 
are those of the interested conversationalist, and never sink 
to the dull level of uninteresting quizzing, or the perfunc- 
tory carrying on of a necessary but disagreeable duty. The 
bright and alert eye, the interested and changing expres- 
sion, and every other physical attribute that marks a good 
conversationalist are demanded in the recitation of this type. 
The children’s answers should be received with responsive- 
Iness and courtesy, even when they must be criticized or
-P-A-G-E-136
  122 CLAS “ROOM METHOD we ANAGEMENT 
     
   
    
                  
    
   
    
          
   corrected. Sarcasm, aap he of bearing, or any 
other quality that will serve to intimidate children have no 
place in the recitation, any more than they have in social 
conversation in well-bred society. 
The Gedliet ecttind.-Supplemedting the question-and- 
answer igi) of instruction the topical method is found of 
great use. This method requires somewhat more of mas- 
tery and independence of thought on the part of the pupil 
than the question-and-answer method. When giving a full 
topical aad the speaker must depend on his own or- 
ganization of thought and on his own powers of expression. 
The topical method affords opportunity, therefore, to teach 
children to organize and relate the matter which they de- 
sire to express. It gives them practise in continuous and 
systematic thinking, thus developing the power to stay longer 
cn the wing mentally, than if trained under the question- 
and-answer method alone. 
The topical method, if skilfully handled, also gives ex- 
cellent opportunity to add a social incentive in some degree 
lacking in other methods. This comes from the fact that 
topics may be assigned for certain pupils to bring before the 
class on subjects which the remainder of the class have 
not studied. The one reciting then has the advantage of 
addressing a real audience of listeners whom he may tell 
something that they themselves do not know. There is no 
great incentive in reciting matter to a group of classmates 
all of whom know what is being told as thoroughly as the 
speaker. | 
oon the topical method should be a series of 
questions and answers to broaden, elaborate or apply the 
truth brought out in the discussion of the topic. This sug- 
gests that the two methods may well be used together. 
The supplemental method.—The method commonl 
called the lecture method sig at least for elementa: 
i 
| | 
i  
-P-A-G-E-137
THE TECHNIQUE OF INSTRUCTION 123 
teaching, better be called the supplemental method. In all 
good instruction the teacher is constantly broadening the 
point of view presented in the text by material brought in 
from his own wider knowledge. This material may some- 
times be expressed in the form of a brief sentence only, 
again it may require a number of sentences of explanation 
or application, or it may demand the fuller discussion which 
conceivably might extend over the greater part of a recita- 
tion period. 
Constant tact and judgment on the part of the instructor 
are required to judge just when, how and in what degree 
to add material of his own to the topic under discussion. 
Every well prepared teacher has experienced the temptation 
to plunge into a discussion of his own rather than to follow 
out the less inspiring set of details of the assigned lesson. 
This temptation must be rigidly put aside, however, and 
no material brought into the presentation which does not 
specifically belong there for some definite and immediate 
purpose. Mere talk, even if it is interesting, has no place 
in the recitation. On the other hand, the teacher who has 
nothing to contribute out of his own knowledge and expe- 
rience is ill prepared for the work of instruction. 
It is in these supplemental remarks, occasional applica- 
tions, and broader discussions or informal lectures that the 
teacher has his best opportunity for stimulating, inspiring 
and energizing the ambitions and intellectual ideals of his 
pupils. It is at such points that he is most the teacher and 
that his influence will be most fruitful. The teacher who 
fails to take advantage of this opportunity is the mere me- 
chanical tester or examiner, who counts his duty done and 
his function fulfilled when he has assured himself that his 
upils have mastered the subject-matter of the text. He 
eaches but a text-book when he should teach the broad sub- 
ject to which the text-book relates.

124 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
The laboratory method.—Still another important 
method of instruction is what we have come to call the 
laboratory method. The essence of this method is that it 
requires the pupils themselves to do something, to carry out 
some experiment, to make some investigation, or in some 
other way learn through investigation and action. The 
laboratory method is used not only in the older natural sci- 
ences, such as chemistry, physics and biology, but also in 
such of the newer subjects as manual training and domestic 
science. It can be much more fully extended into other lines 
than has commonly been done. 
For example, many forms of literature can best be taught 
by dramatizing the production. This is as thoroughly a 
laboratory method as that of mixing chemicals to produce 
a certain reaction in the chemical laboratory. The lessons 
in civics are more effective when they are put immediately 
into practise in the school, community or city. Boys and 
girls who take an active part in the beautifying and keep- 
ing clean of streets and alleys and back yards of their neigh- 
borhood are having laboratory practise in civics. Those 
who go to the polling places on election day and study the 
process of voting are having laboratory practise in citizen- 
ship. And so on with other subjects. 
Good presentation combines all methods.—Good in- 
struction will require that the teacher know and be able 
skilfully to use all of these different methods. Not only 
are they required for variety, but as has been shown, each 
has its own peculiar advantages and is required as a supple- 
ment for the others. The teacher who settles down to any| 
one method to the exclusion of the others quickly sink: 
into a rut and finds his classes becoming dull, restless an 
unresponsive. And such an attitude on the part of the pu: 
pils is but a symptom of mental inertia and the absence o 
the interest and enthusiasm necessary to learning.

Tests of a Good Recitation 
   
                        
                          
          
   
    
             Are there any easily applied and certain tests of the suc- 
cess of our instruction? Are there any standardized meas- 
ures by which we can judge our teaching efficiently in the 
recitation? Instruction is too complex a process and its 
various forms too inter-related to work out any uniform 
and standard series of tests which can be uniformly applied. 
Of certain facts we may, however, be sure. First of all, 
instruction presupposes and requires response. 
The test of complete response.—Teaching and learning 
are but the obverse and reverse sides of the same situa- 
tion, hence no instruction can be successful and no teaching 
reach a high degree of skill which does not secure that alert- 
ness and response from pupils which alone is an evidence 
of their grasping and assimilating the matter taught. One 
of the first tests of a good recitation, therefore, is whether 
all are “in the game.” 
It is easy to secure the attention and participation of the 
brightest members of the class. It is a simple thing to carry 
the alert ones through on a train of thought without losing 
their interest. But the average class of fair size is not made 
up altogether of bright and alert minds. It has in fact but 
the smaller proportion of this type. The greater number 
range within the average or mediocre type, while a small 
proportion xank as positively weak and ineffective mentally. 
Skilful instruction does not, therefore, set its standard at 
winning the highest twenty-five per cent. of the class alone. 
It must aim at securing response from the mediocre, and 
better still at securing response from all. 
However we may divide the proportions among these 
three groups we shall find the groups all represented, and 
will, if we are willing to be very rigid in our requirements, 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
   
126 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
estimate our skill by our ability to command the full powers 
of the entire group. Yet we must not aim our instruction 
chiefly at the incompetent or mediocre to the neglect of the 
stronger and brighter pupils. To hold them back for their 
less gifted companions is a worse mistake than to discrim- 
inate against the weak for the strong. The ideal is to give 
each his fair share and chance. 
The contagion of inattention.—Inattention on the part 
of any members of the class is fatal to the best results from 
instruction, not alone to those who are inattentive, but in 
some degree to every member of the class group. A class 
at its best mentally consists of a number of mental units, 
each reenforcing and supporting with his own mental activ- 
ity the thought, energy and effectiveness of the entire group. 
Every inattentive pupil breaks the chain and hinders the 
flow of enthusiasm and effectiveness that comes from uni- 
fied interest of a number of workers. It is as if each in- 
dividual in the class were a separate cell in a battery series, 
the inattentive ones representing dead cells, which break the 
circuit. The teacher, therefore, owes it not only to the inat- 
tentive members of the class, but to the others as well, to. 
stimulate the dead mentalities into action and to cure the 
lack of enthusiasm that breaks the chain of attention. 
The movement of the recitation—Effectiveness of in- 
struction is also measured in no small degree by the move- 
ment of the thought and plan of lesson, Every one knows 
the drag that comes from the book, the play or the iecture 
that dallies by the way, has unnecessary breaks in its con- 
tinuity or is in general slow in its action. The same prin- 
ciple applies in the recitation. Pauses that are occupied 
with thought or meditation are not, of course, wasted. Such| 
moments may be the most valuable of any period of the 
lesson hour. It is rather the empty lapses which occur for 
no reason except the unreadiness or lack of preparation o

  the teacher that are to be criticized. Every such deadening 
interval is a break in the thread of thought, which of neces- 
sity must be picked up again at the expense of energy, time 
and interest. 
Eliminating the distractions—Good instruction re- 
quires as one of its conditions freedom from unnecessary 
distractions which have a tendency to break in upon the train 
of thought. The standard of the recitation should be such 
that all mischief, whether playful or malicious, shall be set 
aside and have no place in the recitation. Pupils should be 
made to feel that the opportunities of the lesson hour are too 
important, the requirements too high, and the demands of 
courtesy and cooperation too insistent to permit misbehavior 
or lack of attention. The recitation hour is a business en- 
gagement between teacher and pupils and should be carried 
out in a business manner. This caution is undoubtedly su- 
perfluous for many class rooms. But that it has application 
to the conditions in many schools can not be doubted by those 
who have closely studied present-day class-room practise. 
Maintaining high standards.—The best instruction is 
impossible without high standards in the recitation. This 
is but to say that careful and skilled instruction must be met 
and responded to by correspondingly strong mastery and 
appropriation on the part of the pupils. The administration 
of the recitation should be such that failures are not taken 
as a matter of course, or treated with a spirit of levity. 
The recitation hour is the very center and heart of the school 
work and a failure there means failure throughout the sys- 
tem. The attitude of the class and the instructor should be 
such that probable failures in recitation are looked forward 
to with some apprehension and remembered with regret if 
not humiliation. 
Finally we may say that good instruction demands good 
expression. ‘The teacher who is unable to use his mother

tive elements in- 
volved in good instruction it may not be out of place ‘to 
speak of a few of the danger points. 
Lack of definiteness—Probably no other defect of in- 
struction causes more waste and loss of results than failure 
of definiteness in our teaching. He who la 
recognized and definite aim either for h cks a consciously 
s subject or for   any period of instruction within it is n 
valuable results. Many teachers go int 
not only lacking a clear idea of what sh t likely to attain

uld be achieved, 
   
-P-A-G-E-143
THE TECHNIQUE OF INSTRUCTION 129 
   
          
      
   
                                        but also devoid of any prearranged or conscious plan of 
action. They are completely at the mercy of the text-book, 
or if this happens not to supply an organized plan, they 
are at the mercy of circumstances and drift hither and 
thither upon detached and isolated matters, each unrelated 
to the other. The whole process therefore arrives at noth- 
ing. 
The principle of definiteness is also often violated, as 
shown earlier in our discussion, by failure to carry the truths 
developed in the lesson through to the point where they 
apply to life conduct. 
Avoiding dead levels.—A second danger point in in- 
struction is the lack of perspective in teaching. It is pos- 
sible to present all the aspects of a lesson on a dead level, 
and with an entire absence of emphasis on the important 
points. Minor details and incidental aspects of the subject 
receive with such teachers the same stress that is given to 
the more important points. Not only does this type of 
method fail to lodge in the minds of the learners the larger 
truths which deserve the permarient place in their body of 
knowledge, but there is also a failure to teach pupils through 
the use of stress and neglect of emphasis how themselves 
to recognize and make use of the more fruitful points of 
their lessons. 
The rut of routine—Teaching is not only a severe 
nervous strain, but the ever recurring recitation hours are 
likely to become monotonous and to take on a routine qual- 
ity if the teacher is not thoroughly aware of this danger. 
If such a calamity happens it is evidenced by the teacher’s 
lack of alertness and enthusiasm in the recitation. The 
instruction has no sparkle to it, and the entire recitation 
process lacks the swing that characterizes successful instruc- 
tion and reciting. When this condition obtains, the pupils 
come to the class without anticipation or interest and they  
-P-A-G-E-144
     
Li pabli i 
130 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
leave it without regret. They have failed to enjoy their 
work and have thereby lost one of the greatest incentives 
to effort. 
Stopping short of mastery.—Still another danger point 
is that of stopping short of sufficient mastery of important 
and fundamental matter. It can hardly be doubted that our 
entire school system is open to the criticism of too much 
partial learning. We let go by in our instruction too many 
but dimly grasped meanings. We pass over too many par- 
tially understood truths. There is too much of failure, as 
previously noted, to make automatic the simple associative 
learning, such as the symbols of speech, punctuation marks, 
_number combinations, commonly required spellings, and all 
such material that depends not on ideational thought, but 
on the simplest form of associations. The remedy is of 
course obvious. We need more thoroughness in mastery, 
even if this should require a somewhat narrower range of 
material covered. 
  In our discussion we have taken the position that the 
final test of the teacher is his mastery of the technique of 
instruction. The foundation of his effectiveness lies in the 
quality of his personality, which is in a large degree culti- 
vatable. The teacher needs to be a clear thinker and a ready 
speaker. Educational equipment is a prime essential not 
always met. | 
The command of attention and cooperation is the first test 
of good technique. The question-and-answer method, the 
topical method and the laboratory method all have their 
place and should be used to supplement one another. The 
art of questioning should be developed and inductive ques- 
tions freely employed. 
The tests of a good recitation include response; move- 
ment; complete participation; freedom from distractions; 
|   
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  
THE TECHNIQUE OF INSTRUCTION 131 
serious thought and interest; freedom from trickery, bluff- 
ing and evasion. The standards should be high and then 
should be met. There are certain danger points to be 
avoided, such as the lack of definiteness, “dead levels,” ruts 
of routine and incomplete mastery. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. As you think back over the teachers that have meant most to 
you can you now tell what factors gave them their power? Did they 
have good personalities? Are you consciously seeking to improve 
your own personality? " 
2. Have you eyer noticed whether you enjoy teaching a lesson 
over which you feel the power of full mastery? Do you enjoy or 
do as well in teaching a lesson you have not fully in your command? 
Have you such a mastery of your subjects that you can teach the 
subject instead of a certain text? 
3. Do you have any difficulty in holding the full attention of 
your class? Are the pupils responsive? Are they in good spirit, 
and cordial toward you? Do they like the school work and enjoy 
the recitations? Do you? 
4. Which of the methods described do you most use? Why? 
That is, have you considered them all and decided a certain one is 
best for your use? Or do you use them all? Do you supplement 
much in your recitations? Do you find any difficulty in a tendency 
to drift away from the lesson topics? 
5. Have you any trouble with mischief in the recitation? . With 
other forms of distraction? Do your recitations move, or have they 
a tendency to drag? What do you consider your weakest points in 
the recitation? Your strongest?

  Part Two: Method of the Common Branches 
CHAPTER X 
READING AND LITERATURE 
EEADING is the most important of school subjects. It 
( R is the key that unlocks the door to all other learning. 
In every land it is the dividing line between gross ignorance 
‘and intelligence. It-opens the way into the treasure house 
of literature, and brings one into contact with the thoughts 
and deeds of the whole world, present on past. One of 
the greatest contributions the school can offer to the child 
is to make him a good reader. 
Aims—Results Sought 
We teach reading that the child may learn how to gather 
thought and feeling from the printed page. This means 
that he shall be able so to enter into the situations, incidents 
and actions described that the experiences are recreated in 
his own thought and feeling, and made ch through imag- 
ination. Thotight and feeling naturally lead to expression ; 
then we have oral reading. But there can be no oral read- 
ing until the thought and feeling are grasped—up to this 
point there can be but the pronunciation of words. We 
teach oral reading, therefore, to train in the expression of 
thought and feeling as they are gleaned from printed ma- 
terial. 
But the aims just stated deal chiefly with the mechanics of 
reading. And our purpose in teaching rs is but begun 
132 
        
   
-P-A-G-E-147
  READING AND LITERATURE 133 
when the mechanics are mastered. We are not only to teach 
the child how, but what—not only train him to read, but 
lead him some distance in his reading. After putting into 
his hands the tools, made up of the printed symbols, we 
are to guide his use of these tools in opening up the won- 
ders and beauties of the field of literature. Having taught 
him to read, we must teach him to read. 
More briefly stated, then, our aims will be the following: 
1. To teach the mechanics of reading, leading to the 
power (1) to appropriate and (2) to express thought and 
feeling from printed material. 
2. To train the habit of reading, thus opening the way 
to enjoyment, inspiration and knowledge from books—that 
is, to make readers. : 
The knowledge required.—The child usually comes to 
school ignorant of the whole set of symbols—letters, words, 
marks and sentences—which constitute the mechanics of 
printed speéch.' They'look to him at least as strange as 
the following sentence in Yiddish looks to the English-speak- 
ing teacher: 
SIND Tp OW JIN_IN ON DAN fYprp spay woprty yoo 
Yet these symbols must be learned, and the knowledge of 
them must become accurate and ready, so that each word 
or mark carries an immédiate and certain meaning. This 
is a large undertaking and the teacher should lead the way 
with sympathy, understanding and helpfulness. 
After the mechanics the matter. The child does not at 
the beginning know that there are interesting stories to be 
read, beautiful poems to be enjoyed, valuable information 
ito be gleaned. He must be led into this knowledge through 
he reading of ‘stories and poems and information. He must 
e brought to realize and prize his rich heritage in the world 
f books, magazines, papers. He must not be taught to 
ead, and then left without knowing what to read or without

having formed the habit of reading. Through reading the 
child is able to enrich his experience. ee power will 
emancipate him from the immediate, in time and place, and 
bring him into contact with the thought and life of other 
ages and climes. Through reading he ceases to be provin- 
cial, and takes his place as a member of the human family 
and a citizen of the world. ‘ | 
Attitudes to be cultivated.—One of the great aims in 
teaching reading is to lead children to enjoy reading. The 
person who loves good reading has a resource that will yield 
permanent satisfaction and enrich his life from youth to 
old age. Any teaching of reading which does not tend to 
broaden and strengthen the sheer enjoyment from reading 
has been of doubtful value, if not a positive detriment. 
The training of interests and tastes is another great end 
in the teaching of reading and literature. There is so much 
of good to be chosen and so much of bad to be shunned 
that the child is in urgent need of guidance. He needs 
the kind of training that will make his interest crave and 
his taste demand the masterpiece of beautiful form and rich 
content rather than the cheap, sordid, unimaginative tales 
that flood the market. He needs to be au oi from squan- 
dering his time and wasting his enthusiasms on the low or 
the commonplace. And he can be’ saved, for interest and 
taste grow by what they feed upon. The great thing is to   
fill the early time and interest so full of 
reading that the other shall find no si pre

comes to admire and emulate. Beautiful diction is employed 
and beautiful rhythms and rhymes used, and the child learns 
to enjoy them. So standards develop, ideals take shape and 
character forms. 
Skills to be trained—The aim in teaching the me- 
chanics of reading is to make them thoroughly mechanical. 
That is to say, the words, punctuation marks, sentence struc- 
ture and all other elements involved in taking thought and 
feeling from the printed page must be made so automatic 
as to require no conscious effort or attention. No real en- 
joyment and no great efficiency in grasping thought can be 
expected until the automatic stage is reached. All who have 
studied a foreign language know how the half-mastered 
vocabulary and strange sentence structure experienced in 
the earlier stages hinder the satisfaction (or even meaning!) 
we should gather from the story we read. To the child be- 
ginning to read, his own tongue is of course at first a for- 
eign language. 
Let the teacher read the following fragment of a simple 
narrative, beginning at the end and reading backward. It 
will help him’ comprehend the child’s need of developing 
automatic skill. For the child’s difficulties are at first, when 
the mechanics of reading are all strange to him, much greater 
than are ours in the experiment:

thoughts and feelings to be expressed must be fully com-

is to tell to others what he reads. These two simple prin- 
ciples, if carefully carried out, will save much of the ex- 
pressionless and monotonous word-pronouncing that passes 
as reading.

tions between the eye center and the speech center. Natu- 
ralness of tone, good articulation and enunciation, and 
freedom from unpleasant mannerisms should be striven. for 
from the first. It is much easier to form them than to 
reform in all such matters. 
Material—W hat to Teach 
The material for elementary reading should be selected 
with two fundamental principles in mind: 
1. It should have interesting content and attractive liter- 
ary form. 
2. It should be adapted to the age, interests, and present 
experiences of the readers. 
Reading material to possess content.—In a number of 
the older methods of teaching reading, the emphasis on 
word mastery and skill in the use of phonograms was so 
strong that everything else was sacrificed to this end. We 
hen had pages of such sentences as, “A fat cat had a bad 
at.” “A sad man had a hat.” We have come to see, how- 
ver, that such empty and senseless material is not best even 
or the beginners, where phonograms are being learned.

make him want to read, so that he may enjoy the stories 
for himself. They show him the practical use of reading 
and convince him that he needs reading. They also sup- 
ply the nucleus of interest necessary to make the learning 
of the mechanics of reading a pleasurable activity, instead 
of a dry task. No teacher is fully equipped to teach ele- 
mentary reading who does not know a wide range of suit- 
able stories and possess skill in telling them. Besides the 
stories told the children, still others may be read to them. 
Stories to be told or read. There are so many good sto- 
ries that there is no one best list. The following are ap- 
proved by primary teachers :+ 
The Ginger Bread Man 
Snow-white and Rose-red 
The Elves and the Shoe-

Stories and poems to be memorized. The children should 
memorize from eight to twelve such stories and poems as 
the following during the first year:

Material originating in games and plays. Reading mate- 
rial easily and naturally correlates with the games and plays 
which children know or should be taught. For example, 
after the children are able to play readily Simon says 
“Thumbs up” and “Thumbs down,’ the teacher can write 
“Thumbs up” and “Thumbs down” on cards, and have the 
game played by flashing the cards before the class. The in- 
. genious teacher will suit devices to many games and plays 
to introduce action, competition and the need for alertness 
and attention into the learning of new words and sentences. 
Finding material in nature study, etc. In similar way the 
every-day experiences of the school can be made to supply 
material for the reading class. A nature lesson on opening 
buds or falling leaves, a sudden rain beating on the windows, 
the clouds floating by, the bees hovering over the flowers— 
these and many such topics catch the child’s interest and 
stimulate his expression. They are therefore a good basi 
for the introduction of new words and for sentences ani 
stories reviewing words already presented. 
What to teach about the mechanics of reading. The bes 
primary teachers of the present day have declared agains 
diacritics and excessive use of phonics in the first grade|
-P-A-G-E-157
  READING AND LITERATURE 143 
Phonic work should not be started until the child has had 
some two months in school and might be delayed most of the 
first half year without loss. Diacritics should not be taught 
the first year, though the long and the short sound of each 
vowel should be given without the marks. A considerable 
range of the phonograms (depending on the primers or read- 
ers in use) should be given during the last half of the year. 
The letters of the alphabet and the elementary sound values 
should be taught as the reading ability progresses. The drill 
in phonics should be at a separate period and not combined 
with reading and literature. 
Second-grade material—Opinions differ as to whether 
the second year of reading should be based chiefly on short 
stories and poems, or on a longer production which may 
continue fora number of weeks or months. Many schools 
use Hiawatha for second-year material. This question is, 
however, not so important as that of selecting the material, 
long or short, so that it will fit into the present experiences 
of the children or awaken in them experiences for. which 
they are ready. The teacher will usually have as the basis 
for her work one or more readers adopted as a standard. An 
abundance of supplemental material should also be pre- 
sented. The child learns to read by reading, and should be 
given much easy matter full of interest to him and of value 
for itself. 
Stories to be read or told to the children. The oral story 
will still play an important part in the reading work of the 
econd grade. The following have been found to be adapted 
o second-grade children:

-P-A-G-E-159
  READING AND LITERATURE 145 
Mechanics. On the side of the mechanics of reading the 
work of the second grade will stress the sounds of letters, 
and phonics. The chief phonograms will be developed and 
applied to new words as they appear in the readers or outside 
material. The great thing in this connection is so to organize 
the work that the phonograms learned are put at work in the 
learning of new words. The drill given should also aim at 
clear enunciation and articulation with a view to improving 
oral speech and reading. 
Attention should now be called to punctuation marks, and 
their names learned. From this time on they should in- 
creasingly become a help in both silent and oral reading. 
The third-grade material.—Besides the standard reader, 
several sets of supplementary readers should be available. 
During this year one or more longer poems or stories should 
be read. Hiawatha and an adaptation of Robinson Crusoe 
are most used for this purpose. Such reading trains the 
child in sustained memory and interest, besides developing 
the idea of wider situations and more complete activities 
than are revealed in shorter stories and poems. However, 
he shorter stories and poems are not to be omitted from the 
eading course. 
Stories to be told or read to the children. The story tell- 
ng should continue. Not only do the stories give enjoyment, 
uit they stimulate the imagination, and serve to develop 
aste for good reading. Many of them have a distinct moral 
alue, and all together help to train the reading habit. The 
ollowing are a few of the many stories available for third-

READING AND LITERATURE 147 
Library material. Almost from the beginning of the 
course in reading the work should be correlated with. the 
local library where such is available. The library should be 
encouraged to purchase books suitable for children, and to 
make it easy for children to secure and make use of the 
books. -The children should be led by the teacher and the 
librarian to form the library habit. The third-grade child 
should have learned how to draw books from the library, 
the rules to be observed, and should have some knowledge 
of the most interesting books available in the local library. 
The following are some books for the library that are es- 
pecially useful for the first three grades: 
The Golden Goose Book, Brooks 
A Book of Nonsense for Children, Lear 
Little People of the Snow, Muller 
4isop’s Fables, Bott 
Folk-Lore Stories and Proverbs, Wiltse 
Fairy Stories and Fables, Baldwin 
Stories of Mother Goose Village, Bigham

Miss Muffett’s Christmas Party, Crothers 
The Sandman, Jewett 
Stories of Indian Children, Husted

The Story Hour, Wiggin and Smith 
Mechanics. As stated earlier in the chapter, the me- 
anics of reading should be practically mastered by the end

of the third year. The child should in this year, therefore, 
complete the phonics which may remain from the previous 
grades, and should learn the diacritical marks. He should 
be made entirely familiar with the function of punctuation 
marks and learn to use them as a help in reading. Drills in 
articulation and enunciation should be continued, and bad 
habits of expression corrected. j 
This does not mean that no further attention will need 
to be paid to mechanics after the third grade. Review of 
the harder points and much practise to secure skill in expres- 
sion will of course be required. But from this time on if the 
previous teaching has been good, chief attention can be given 
to content and appreciation. 
Fourth-grade material—The child has for three years 
been learning to read; he should now be ready to read 
to learn. While he has by this time read much good mate- 
rial, yet constant attention has been required to the mechan- 
ical side. By the beginning of the fourth grade the emphasis 
should shift. Thought, feeling, interpretation, enjoyment 
in reading are now the chief ends. Experience should now 
broaden and a sense of values develop rapidly through the 
reading and literature. 
Sources of reading material. In most schools the standard 
readers will supply the basis of material. There shoul 
either be several sets of readers, or better still, an abundan' 
supply of graded classics suitable for this grade. Th 
teacher should not hesitate to omit stories or poems from thi 
readers which seem unsuited to the pupils, and substitute fo: 
them better material. 
Especially should children now have an opportunity t 
read for themselves the stories they have heard told or rea 
earlier in the course. The repetition will do no harm. O 
the other hand, familiarity with the story will aid in t

         reading and its enjoyment; it will also help in learning new 
words, through their use in a familiar context. 
The library should at this stage be generously drawn upon. 
If children are allowed occasionally to select a story from 
a library book and read it to the class it will add interest and 
aid in developing the right attitude toward the library as a 
source of readable material. Children’s magazines, and such 
current material as gives account of inventions, the con- 
struction of various articles to be made by the children, or 
the different industries, should furnish their share of matter. 
Stories and poems to be read or told to the children. Oral 
stories should still continue. Since the child is now able to 
read for himself, the teacher’s part as a story teller may de- 
crease somewhat, but it should not drop out. There is small 
danger of hearing too many good stories, either for their 
real enjoyment or to stimulate the reading of stories for 
one’s self. The following are suitable for this grade: 
Robin Hood Prince Cherry 
The Gold in the Orchard W onder Book 
Little Lame Prince The Dagda’s Harp 
Abou Ben Adhem Kipling’s Just-So Stories

Library material. The library should be an increasingly 
larger factor in the reading course as the child progresses 
from grade to grade. The following represent the types of 
books that should be available for the fourth grade. The 
teacher can often work with the librarian to see that needed| 
books are added to the local library list : 
Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Carroll

  Mechanics. Apply phonetics to the mastery of new 
words. Review and apply diacritical marks. Begin use of 
dictionary for pronunciation, Teach how to find words 
quickly and easily, and to pronounce from marks. Do not 
depend much on dictionary for definitions at this stage. The 
meaning of a word can be learned better in connection with 
its use in the context. Correct any bad habits in oral read- 
ing. Work for good expression. 
Fifth- and sixth-grade material—By the time children 
have reached this stage their interests, if they have been well 
trained, are surprisingly broad. They know something of 
the world of nature, of industry, of history, of literature, 
and many things besides. There is, therefore, almost no end 
to the range of material adapted to their reading. Here as 
before the great problem is to give matter that is stimulating 
nd elevating, and yet within the child’s capacity. Nothing 
is ever gained, but much is lost, by forcing upon children 
iterary productions, however good in themselves, before 
hey are ready for them. 
Professors Bobbitt, Boyce and Perkins, in a study iad 
f fifty courses of study representing thirty-six different 
ities and fourteen different states, found that the following

    Seventh- and eighth-grade matdrigl-—Probably by the 
seventh grade and certainly by the eighth grade the serial 
school readers should be completed and give way to literary 
wholes as the basis for study. It is to be remembered that 
the age of adolescence has now arrived with its broadening 
social interests, and its new outlook upon ife. Literature 
with a heroic strain and a dramatic movement will exert 
strong appeal. Sentiment is also deepening and the mor 
intimate values of life and its relations Tt asserting theii 
claims. The practical and vocational interests are becomin; 
more definite and must have their share of attention. 
In reading the literary masterpieces it is to be recognize 
that the object sought is not close literary inspection, bu 
appreciation, interest, enjoyment and the broadening an 
enriching of experience. Current magazine and journ 
material should have a wider use than it i, has in thes| 
grades, both from its own intrinsic value and because of th
-P-A-G-E-169

possibility of helping in this way to form good reading 
habits. It is more difficult for the teacher to use this type 
of material than that found in the text-books, but it is worth 
the extra effort. 
The material most commonly read in the seventh and 
eighth grades as found by Bobbitt, Boyce and Perkins is as 
follows:

  Material to omit.—It is as impo ant to know what to 
omit as what to select for children’s reading, Material that 
is beyond their grasp or that does not meet the response of 
any interest not only has failed of its purpose, but has served 
to dull the edge of taste and desire for reading. For ex- 
ample, there are parts of Idylls of the King in which there 
are sentiments yet unknown to the child. Thanatopsis, 
which is taught in many seventh and eighth grades, presents 
a philosophy of life (and death) beyond the grasp of the 
child’s understanding. Many of Hawthorne’s stories are en- 
veloped in gloom, and too depressing for this age. We are 
_ to be guided by the principle already stated, the child and 
not the excellence of the literary material is to be our cri- 
terion. 
Books for the teacher.—Either through the school or 
_ local library, or else by personal ownership the teacher of 
elementary reading should have accessible such books as the 
following:

Organization and Presentation 
   
                
   
        
     
   
   
    
    Much of the success of teaching reading depends on skilful 
presentation. This is because the interpretation of literature 
has so large a personal element in it. The kindling eye, the 
expressive face, the interested manner, the well modulated 
and appealing voice are all vital factors in making the story 
or poem live before the class. All these things are also in 
some degree contagious, and, consciously or unconsciously 
to the pupils, tend to shape their standards and determine the 
quality of their own expression. Even in teaching the me- 
chanics of reading the personal factor is of the greatest im- 
portance. 
Starting the beginners.—When our grandfathers went 
to school there was no trouble about the method by which 
they should learn to read. There was but one method—they 
first learned their Jetters, then built these into syllables (a-b 
lab, e-b eb, i-b ib, etc.), next made these into words, and 
nally assembled the words into sentences. It was supposed 
hat, since the letter was the smallest of the divisions of our 
anguage, it must therefore be the most easily learned, and 
he syllable next, and so on. This system gave us the alpha- 
et, or a-b-c, method. It was a logical instead of a psycho- 
logical method; it considered the material instead of the 
hild. : ' 
The next step in primary method (if not in time, at least 
psychological sequence) was to conceive that the child 
lhould first be given, not letters, but certain sounds, or 
lhonograms, and then trained to build these into words. So 
e had various types of phonetic methods. Having learned 
e sound of c (with a “collar” on!), the sound of b, of h, 
c., and also having learned certain “families” as the ab, the

at, the ad family, the child then proceeded to build his words 
as he required them. Or, meeting a new word, he took it 
apart into its phonograms and thereby knew how to pro- 
nounce it. 
This also was a logical instead ofa psychological method, 
for the reason that the child’s first contact with speech is not 
in the form of dis-membered vor It is rather with whole 
living words used to express some interesting thought. The 
realization of this simple fact has led to recent sentence-word 
methods, in which words are learned as parts of the sen- 
tences used in familiar speech by the children themselves. 
From this starting point, phonograms and individual let- 
ters are learned. This method is psychological, in that it 
follows the order of the child’s natural approach to printed 
speech. It is undoubtedly better than ar of the other 
two because it is psychological. 
The same results in knowledge, it is to be noted, may be 
reached by any one of the three methods; namely, a knowl- 
edge of letters, phonograms, words, sentences. The differ- 
ence is one of organization, or mode of approach. And this 
makes all the difference in the methods and their efficiency. 
Prevention and cure of bad reading habits——The best 
remedy for bad habits is to prevent their formation. Thi 
can be done in the matter of reading without great difficult 
if the child is started right. As already suggested it is easie 
to form than to reform. The habit of expressionless dron 
ing, of mere word-saying, of singsonging monotone, of in: 
audible mumbling, can be prevented in most children. 
Most of these faults originally come from over-mechaniz} 
ing the reading. The child is asked to read before he cai 
read. Ata time when his thought must be full of word-re 
ognition he is called upon for thought-expression. The r 
sult is that he only expresses words. He does the same thi 
5 }     
 
-P-A-G-E-173
READING AND LITERATURE 159 
that the high-school student does when he attempts to read 
Latin that he does not know. 
The Remedy? Let the child at the beginning be fully 
familiar with the entire sentence or story before he is asked 
to read it. Let him know all the words. Let him know all 
the thought, but not have it committed to memory. Then 
let him ¢ell the story from the printed page. Give him 
thought that he knows, give him words that he knows, and 
then call for the expression. Finally use these words in new 
context until they are recognized anywhere. This method 
of procedure will require that much oral story work shall 
precede reading, so that children will be reading very famil- 
iar material. It will require that reading material growing 
out of games or school lessons shall first be made familiar 
in oral form before it is given the child to be expressed as 
reading. It is safe to conclude that lack of expression in 
a child’s reading commonly comes from one or more of three 
factors: 
1. Lack of ideas to express, the meaning not grasped. 
2. The mechanics so unfamiliar as to demand excessive 
attention. 
3. Shyness, embarrassment, or other hindering mental 
attitude. 
It is to be understood, of course, that bad habits once 
formed will require much patient correction and practise for 
their cure. They must not be neglected. 
Dramatization.—The child’s instinct for dramatization 
should be freely utilized in teaching reading. Freedom from 
self-consciousness and the willingness to undertake the rep- 
resentation of almost any character make the child an ideal 
actor. Children who have acted out Cinderella, Belling the 
Cat, Midas and the Golden Touch, speaking the parts as they 
   
-P-A-G-E-174
  160 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT " 
act them, will hardly fail to put expression into their reading 
of them. To arrange for such dramatization, or even part- 
reading, requires some time and trouble on the part of the 
teacher, but it pays. 
Appreciation and ‘enjoyment.—It can not be too 
strongly urged that one of the chief aims of D ctime read- 
ing is to develop the habit of reading. This can be done only 
if the reading actually done yields enjoyment. Our method 
_ of teaching must be such therefore that the interesting and 
enjoyable things are brought out, and that nothing is done 
which will deaden the interest or kill the enjoyment. 
This point of view suggests that we shall not aim to make 
literary critics of our pupils by stressing chiefly the struc- 
ture, the mechanics or the style of the production. We 
shall not even trouble them too much with irrelevant de- 
tails about the life of the authors. Some of the ways in 
‘which we may help increase the child’s enjoyment in what 
he reads are the following:     
   
   
    
      
         
   
       1. Whet the appetite with interesting bits of the story in 
assigning the lesson. 
2. Ask questions about persons, motives or events. 
3. Ask children to decide which character they would 
rather be and why. 
4. Ask class to think how the story might have been 
made to end differently, etc. 
5. Be suré that no too-difficult word, thought or allusion 
is left unexplained in the assignment. 
6. Give the story its interesting historical or social setting 
when this can be done. 
The appeal to imagination.—The central factor in in- 
terpreting and enjoying literature is imagination. Not until 
the objects, actions and situations described are made real 
by this picturing power of the mind do their full value
-P-A-G-E-175
    
READING AND LITERATURE 161 
and meaning appeal to the reader. Unless as one reads 
Evangeline or The Vision of Sir Launfal the pictures rise 
in the mind, the significance will have dropped out and the 
throbbing scenes of life and action become but so many 
dead words. 
The teacher can greatly stimulate the child’s imagination 
by asking a question here and offering a suggestion there 
that will serve to vivify the situation described. A helpful 
device is to ask the class to shut their eyes and see the for- 
est, or the ocean, or the event with their mind’s eyes; or 
to hear the sounds with their mind’s ears, etc. Asking for 
details of color, distance, direction and so on will still fur- 
ther aid the imaging. Often an expressive reading of a 
section by the teacher will help the children form their men- 
tal pictures. Pity the child to whom falls the calamity of 
having a teacher who, himself untouched by the imagery 
of a poem, makes its reading a matter of dead routine! 
Oral and silent reading.—The older standard of read- 
ing was chiefly an oral standard. As books have multiplied 
and other reading matter increased, however, most people 
read silently far more than aloud. This has led us to see 
that our children should have more definite training and also 
more practise in silent reading. According to the best judg- 
ment now available the proportion of oral and silent reading 
should be about as follows: 
First grade—Oral, 80 per cent.; silent, 20 per cent. 
Fifth grade—Oral, 50 per cent. ; silent, 50 per cent. 
Eighth grade—Oral, 20 per cent. ; silent, 80 per cent. 
Of course it is not meant that these proportions shall be 
more than approximate. They show, however, a steady 
change in emphasis from oral to silent reading through the 
grades. )
-P-A-G-E-176
    162 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT | | 
Home reading.—The larger use of silent reading has 
added greatly to the importance of reading in the home. 
This phase of the reading course should be encouraged in 
every possible way, for it adds to the amount of time well 
spent by the child, and also gives him a pleasant occupation 
that will tend to keep him in the home circle. Many of the 
books of the reading course can well be read aloud at the 
family fireside. 
The use of the memory.—If the child is to enjoy and 
profit by the committing of stories and poems, he should 
be taught hot his memory.’ Simply to tell a child 
to “learn this poem by heart” is a heartless and inefficient 
way to make an assignment. Committing to memory is an 
art, and it has.to be learned. The following rules should 
guide in the use of the memory: 
I. Commit by wholes instead of by fragments. If a poem 
of several stanzas is to be learned, go over them all. Then 
go over them again, and again. This method has been found 
by careful Didliment to be much more effective than to 
learn one stanza at.a time and then piece them together. 
Of course certain troublesome places may need special at- 
tention. 
2. Try to picture and make real the persons, the events, 
or the actions involved. It is easier to make the words to 
be committed attach to such realities than merely to one an- 
other as empty words. A production learned in this way 
will also have meaning. 
3. Review Bod until the matter is thoroughly fixed. 
Material that is barely learned will not stay learned. If 
it is gone over at intervals of a few days for a time it will 
become much more secure.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1, Formulate the aims of reading, grade by grade, under the 
three heads used in the chapter for defining aim. Then estimate 
your points of greatest success and greatest difficulty as measured by 
these aims. 
2. Have you any pupils whose attitude toward reading and liter- 
ature is indifferent? If so, can you locate the difficulty, (1) in the 
adaptability of the subject-matter, (2) in your method of presenta- 
tion, or (3) in low-grade ability of the pupil? Have you discovered 
what such pupils like to read outside of school? 
3. Can you not secure one or more of the reading tests, such as 
the Kansas test or the Courtis test, and measure the ability of your 
pupils? Full directions accompany the blanks, and you can compare 
your pupils with those of other schools. Have your pupils the de- 
gree of skill asked for on page 138? If not, where does the fault lie? 
4. Outline your method of teaching beginners, and justify the 
plan you use. When do you begin phonics? Why should the lesson 
in phonics be separate from the reading lesson? What devices do 
you employ to secure careful articulation? Clear enunciation? Good 
expression? 
5. Suppose a fourteen-year-old boy asked you for a list of six 
books for a winter’s reading, what would you recommend? For a 
fourteen-year-old girl? What use do you make of dramatization in 
teaching literature? Make a list of several good productions to 
dramatize in each grade.

SPELLING 
   
   
                  
   
    
         
   
    
       .E have probably been less successful in teaching spell- 
ing than any other branch. Spelling is taught in 
every grade and in many high schools; yet our children do 
not spell so well as we should like. They misspell many 
_ seemingly easy words and keep on misspelling them. They 
spell certain words correctly in their spelling classes, or even 
win medals on them in spelling contests, and then spell the 
same words incorrectly in their letters or other written 
work. Something needs to be done with our spelling. 
The Aim—Results Sought 
The purpose of teaching spelling is to enable one to spell 
correctly the words he puts into writing. In actual affairs © 
one is never required to spell except when he writes, nor 
to spell words which he does not use in his writing vocab- 
ulary, Such words as he thus needs he must be able to spell 
accurately and with certainty. 
Knowledge required in spelling.—It is a waste of time, 
interest and efficiency for the child to learn the spelling 
f a large number of words which he will never use in his 
ritten vocabulary, or to learn words which he may finally 
eed, long before he requires them. The average written 
ocabulary of a child finishing the eighth grade is only 
lightly more than two thousand words. This has been 
sted by examining a large number of manuscripts of chil- 
ren in the various grades in different schools. Yet the 
elling books commonly used in our schools contain from

words frequently misspelled, the pupil must come to look 
on such slips with shame and humiliation. Children must 
be brought to see that the practical use of spelling as em- 
ployed in writing, and not the ability to “spell down” on a 
list of strange words is the final measure of spelling’ ability 
and the test by which one is judged in the world of affairs. 
Skills to be attained.—The skills to be sought through 
the teaching of spelling may be described under three prin- 
ciples, which have already been implied in the discussion: 
First—Skill is to be sought in the words comprising the 
child’s vocabulary as against an extended list bearing no 
reference to the individual vocabulary. The skill needed 
is of the useful practical kind and not the ability merely 
to show off on miscellaneous lists of words. Children do 
not permanently retain the spelling of difficult words learned 
when they have no use for them. Further, the centering 
of the attention on such lists tends to minimize the impor- 
tance of spelling correctly in written work. Many children 
look upon the recitation period devoted to the spelling of 
desk-made lists as their “spelling” lesson and think but little 
of the fact that every manuscript they write is a far better 
test of their spelling skill. 
Second—The test of practical spelling skill is written, and 
not oral. It is the daily written work of the whole range 
of school lessons, and not in the exercises of the spelling 
class alone. Misspellings in all written work should there- 
fore be corrected and the troublesome words mastered, not 
once only but as often as is necessary. 
Third—Spelling must be mastered so thoroughly that it 
becomes wholly automatic. One who has to stop and think 
how to spell a word lacks skill in spelling, even if he may 
finally succeed in spelling the word correctly. Spelling 
should become second nature, a habit so well grounded that 
attention is not required. The mind is then left free for 
concentration upon the thought under consideration, and is 
     
-P-A-G-E-182
      ee 168 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT , 
not troubled with formal details. Hentk the troublesome 
words should be repeated, reviewed and drilled upon until 
there is no possibility of continued error. 
The degree of skill which children of the various grades 
have reached in spelling in one hundred different school sys- 
tems of the United States-has been carefully investigated by 
Doctor Leonard P. Ayres of the Russell Sage Foundation. 
It was found that an average of seventy per cent. of the 
words of the following lists were spelled correctly by the 
children of the respective grades. While such a list is not 
a final test of spelling ability, it will enable a teacher to com- 
pare her pupils in a general way with the average of Ameri- , 
can children: (It is to be understood that children who can 
spell seven of the ten words for their grade are just up to the 
average. ) i

Subject-Matter—What to Teach 
It is one thing to say that the child should be taught the 
spelling of the words common to his vocabulary, and quite 
another thing to know just what words are included and 
what left out in this vocabulary. It is further true that the 
range of vocabulary varies greatly in different children. 
Now, since we must under present school conditions teach 
children in groups, it is evident that the spelling work can 
not be based precisely on the individual vocabularies. Nor 
perhaps would this method be best even if it were possible. 
The better-plan is to teach as the foundation of spelling 
ability, a minimum list of words made up from a careful 
study of the vocabularies of many grade pupils. If we add 
to such a minimum list all the words misspelled by the child 
in his written work, the range of material will be sufficiently 
defined. 
A minimum list. rete W. F. Jones? listed all the 
different words used by one thousand and fifty children 
in grades two to eight, inclusive, in the writing of seven 
thousand five hundred themes. He found that the largest 
single vocabulary was 2,812 words. The combined vocab- 
ulary of all the children contained 4,532 different words. 
Doctor Ayres? found that two thousand letters employed 
an aggregate vocabulary of only two thousand and one dif- 
ferent words. Cook and O’Shea® studied the personal let- 
ters written by thirteen adults containing two hundred thou- 
sand words and found the aggregate vocabulary to consist of 
five thousand two hundred different words. 
Other similar investigations have shown the same gen-

eral results. Doctor Ayres on the results from a 
series of such studies and therefrom compiled a list of the 
one thousand commonest words. This list should surely be 
mastered before finishing the elementary school. The list

vocabularies of fourth-grade children. Yet seventy-nine per 
cent. of the fourth-grade pupils misspelled more than twenty 
of the words, and forty-one per cent. of all pupils in grades 
four to eight inclusive misspelled twenty or more of the 
one hundred words. Approximately the same record was 
made in eighteen other cities. Surely Assistant Superin- 
tendent Studebaker? is right when he concludes, “in the 
light of these facts it certainly is not advisable . . . to 
use time in an effort to teach children in the respective 
grades the spelling of such words as the following, selected

even thousands, of the most unusual, technical and difficult 
words of the average spelling book. The time thus gained 
should be spent on making sure of the commonest words, 
and especially in making sure of the demon words which are 
most responsible for spelling errors. 
Added to these “minimum lists” should be a “personal 
list” of new words to be learned as the vocabulary grows 
and also a list of words found misspelled in any written 
work, no matter what the subject. Such a method of select- 
ing spelling material would beyond question add much to 
efficiency in spelling, and would save a considerable amount 
of time for other purposes. 
     
                      
      
   
    
       
    
     Organization and Presentation—The Teaching 
of Spelling 
In planning the teaching of spelling the principle is to be 
held in mind that spelling is to deal with the words the 
child writes, and not the ones he is able to read, or even able 
to use in oral speech. This would mean that no spelling 
(except in the form of phonograms connected with reading) 
e taught in the first grade, for the simple reason that the 
hild has not yet begun to write. On the same principle, 
pelling will constantly be correlated with written language 
ork, and will advance as rapidly as the use of new words 
in written lessons progresses. 
The selection of words to be taught by grades.—It is 
f course impossible to give any standard list of words that 
hould be taught in all schools grade by grade. For, as 
plied in the foregoing discussion, the words to be learned 
ill be determined by the primers and readers used, the 
ature of the language work, the text-books in other sub- 
cts, and the home, community and play interests of the pu- 
ils.

180 CLASS: ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT    
By the end of the fourth grade the spelling of all words 
in the list of one hundred “demons” should have been taught, 
and about seven hundred of the list of the one thousand 
commonest words. In addition, any words used by the child 
in his written work, but not included in these lists, should be 
mastered. By the end of the eighth grade, the entire list of 
the one thousand commonest words should be so firmly fixed 
that none is misspelled, and a corresponding extension made 
in line with the individual writing vocabulary. By the time 
this stage is reached all of the one hundred “demons” 
should also have been so thoroughly vanquished as to give 
no further trouble. 
Jones found that of the 4,532 words which constituted 
the combined vocabulary used in all grades by 1,050 chil- 
dren, the following number of words were used by two pe: 
cent. of the children in the respective grades:

Fifth grade—new words added to previous lists..... 
Sixth grade—new words.added to previous lists..... 
Seventh grade—new words added to previous lists... 
Eighth grade—new words added to previous lists... . 
Emphasizing the hard words.—Not all words a 
equally hard to spell. Some, once learned, are secure fro: 
that time on. Others which seem to be learned are soon fo 
gotten and have to be relearned time and again. The on 
way to be sure about the difficulty of a word is to obser 
the trouble it gives the child in learning it. A word th 
looks hard to the teacher may not prove so to the class, whi 
certain words that look easy give the class no end of troub’ 
These facts suggest that not all words should be given t| 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
SPELLING 181 
same amount of study and drill. Not a few teachers require 
all the words of the spelling lesson to be “written ten times,” 
or “studied over twenty times” by the pupils. This method 
puts just as much study on easy words as hard words. The 
result is what is called “over-learning” of the easy words. 
Children must be taught how to study spelling. If they 
are merely told to “take the next twenty words” from the 
spelling book we may be sure they will not finally make good 
spellers. They need to learn how to weigh the difficulty of 
cords, to notice the difficult part of hard words, and to drill 
hemselves on words known to be hard. 
Personal and class lists of hard words.—Each pupil 
should have a small note-book to be used for spelling only. 
me section of this should be given to the keeping of a list 
f all words misspelled either in the regular spelling lessons 
r in any other written work of the school. The teacher will 
eed to keep some oversight of these lists to make sure that 
e missed words are put down, and that they are spelled 
rrectly when recorded. These personal lists should form 
e basis of frequent reviews, and dictation work. 
The teacher should also keep a class list of misspelled 
ords found in the written work of all lessons, and use 
ese for occasional lessons for the entire class. There is 
tle danger of: putting too much stress on the misspelled 
rds. These are the “demons” that need to be overcome. 
One sixth-grade child made the following personal list 
ring one school year.1. Very few of the words were in the 
th-grade list of her spelling book, hence the only way to 
rm them was by outside attention and drill:

How fast to teach the spelling of new words.—In ge 
eral there is nothing gained by teaching the spelling of n 
words without also teaching their meaning and use. If 
word when learned goes at once into use, it not only exten| 
the vocabulary by so much, but its frequent use will a 
tend to fix the correct spelling. 
Most teachers probably teach new words too rapi

   others in teaching spelling. Many devices must be invented 
by the teacher to secure drill and review with interest. Prin- 
ipal H. C. Pearson, of the Horace Mann School, suggests 
he following as one good method :* 
“1, Write one of the words on the blackboard and teach 
it in accordance with the following plan. Then write the 
ext word, teaching it in the same, and so on with the rest 
f the words: 
“(a) While writing the word, pronounce it distinctly. 
“(b) Develop the meaning orally by using the word in a 
entence and by defining it. 
“(c) Divide word into syllables. Call on pupils to spell 
rally by syllables. Have the word spelled in concert, and 
dividually by poor spellers. 
“(d) Have pupils indicate the parts of the word that 
resent difficulties, or whether the word contains parts they 
ready know. Teacher should also call attention to pecu- 
rities, such as silent letters, ei and ie combinations, etc. 
“(e) Have pupils write the word once, twice or three 
es, pronouncing it softly or spelling silently as they write 
It would be well to have given a new sentence using the 
ord before they do this. This is to emphasize strongly the 
eaning of the word again just before the child writes it. 
“(£) Allow the class a moment in which to look at the 
rd again and then have them close eyes and try to visual- 
it, or use any other device of a similar nature. 
“2. After the various words of the day’s lesson have been 
died in this way, allow a few minutes for studying the 
ole lesson, suggesting that each pupil emphasize the words 
thinks he doesn’t know. This time should be limited so 
t each pupil will attend vigorously and attentively. 
“(a) Next have the whole column reviewed orally. This 
y be done either by the class as a whole or by individual 
ils, or both. If the former, have children first spell each 
rd from the board and then, turning from the board, spell 
gain silently. Then let them verify results by consulting 
board. If the latter, have pupils work on the words that 
most difficult for them.” 
Quoted, page 28, Des Moines Report, 1915.

184 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
Oral and written spelling —While spelling ability is 
finally needed only in written form it may well be that the 
oral method has certain valuable uses. Particularly as the 
child is beginning to learn the spelling of words the oral drill 
should be employed, carrying this oral ability over as rapidly 
as possible to writing.’ Oral practise may also be used at any 
other stage to secure additional drill, lend variety, or furnish 
a device for competitive tests, etc. The main dependence, 
however, must be. placed in written spelling. For, while 
it is probable that a given number of words can be learned 
faster by the oral than by the written method, they will not 
be remembered so well, nor used with as much. accuracy 
when spontaneously employed in writing. 
Column and context spelling.—It has been urged that 
spelling shall be taught chiefly in connection with the use of 
words in context. This does not mean, however, that col: 
umns of words should never be assembled and drilled upon. 
They should be. But column spelling should not become th 
tule. For it is one thing to be able to spell.a word in a col 
umn drill, and quite another thing to be able to spell it whe 
writing, with the attention centered on the thought rathe 
than on spelling. It is to be remembered in conducting spell 
ing by dictated sentences that the words employed for spell} 
ing may be used almost as formally as if in columns. It j 
evident that no small part of the practise should be in co 
nection with the pupil’s own composition. The rule here 
to bring the spelling practise as nearly as possible to tl 
normal conditions under which spelling ability is require: 
Drill on difficult elements.—If a large number of mi 
spellings of the same word are collected it will be seen th 
a very large proportion of the errors center about some oj 
difficult letter or syllable. Once discovered, this is the p 
of the word that should receive the drill. In drilling on t 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
SPELLING 185 
word it is well to have it written on the board with the hard 
part in colored crayon, or underlined to attract the attention. 
Spelling rules—A great diversity of practise exists 
concerning the teaching of spelling rules. Some spelling 
books omit all rules, while others give as many as eighteen. 
Cook and O’Shea made a somewhat careful study of the ef- 
fect of learning spelling rules on college freshmen and high- 
school students. They conclude that, with this grade of 
students, rules have little or no relation to spelling ability. 
Much less effect would they have on children in the grades, 
who have less power to apply the rule. In the training of 
good spellers, the chief dependence must be placed on mak- 
ing spelling automatic by well-directed practise. 
Mastering the lesson—There are four factors which 
combine to make the complete spelling lesson:? (1) Super- 
vised study, in which the teacher goes over the words with 
the class, analyzes their difficulties, has the words visualized, 
spelied orally and in writing, and perhaps used in sentences. 
(2) Independent study, in which the children drill them- 
elves on the words, visualizing them, repeating the letters, 
nd writing the words. (3) Testing results, not only of the 
resent day’s study, but of review words. (4) Correction 
f errors, or making a personal list of incorrect words and 
rilling upon the correct forms. Only when these four 
rocesses are properly combined is spelling well taught. 
General spelling contests—The oral spelling contest 
letween schools has for generations been looked upon with 
vor, not only as a competitive diversion, but as a means of 
aking good spellers. As a diversion it-is a success; as a 
eans of teaching spelling it is a failure. First of all the 
elling contest appeals only to naturally good spellers. The

poor speller knows he has no chance in the contest, hence 
he does not greatly exert himself and expects low rank. The 
one who needs the study and drill does not get it. 
Further, the words usually studied and drilled upon for 
the spelling contest are not selected with reference to their 
practical use in the child’s vocabulary. Far from it; they 
are more usually selected as a sporting proposition from un- 
usually difficult and rare words that will test merely the 
verbal memory. For example, it has been found that the 
words which, there and their are the words oftenest mis- 
spelled of any in the language by the pupils of the first eight 
grades. But who ever heard of using these words in a spell- 
ing contest ! 
The competitive motive is a good incentive in the learning 
of spelling, but it can be used to better advantage than in the 
usual oral contest. 
     
   
       
     
    
    
   
   
   
      
   
   
    QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. How, on the whole, are your children as spellers? Have you 
some who spell well in class but miss many words in writing? Have 
you those who miss the same words over time after time? If you 
meet with these difficulties, would it be better to devote your atten- 
tion to their cure rather than to teaching lists of new words? 
2. Do you find many words in your speller lists which are not in 
the child’s writing vocabulary? If so, would it be better to omit 
some of these and make sure of the common words? 
3. Try your school, grade by grade with the lists of words o: 
page 168. Remember that to average with good schools, they shoul: 
be able to spell seven out of the ten correctly. Test them also wit! 
the “one hundred demons” and the one thousand commonest words} 
4. How do you teach new words to children in the earlier grades 
Compare with the directions given on page 183 and see whether yo! 
can improve your method. 
5. What is your method of curing the repeated misspelling of th 
same words in manuscripts? Do you make the child correct tl 
misspelling, or do you merely check it and trust the child to look t

word up? Do you have the children keep lists of their misspelled 
words and drill on them? Do you keep a list from the manuscripts 
you read? Do you make all lessons spelling lessons?

    CHAPTER XII 
LANGUAGE 
  HE most commonly applied test of one’s education and 
, intelligence is his command of his mother tongue. Let 
his speech be uncouth or ineffective and no amount of learn- 
ing will enable him to convey an impression of culture. On 
the other hand, well-chosen, effective speech is everywhere 
a personal asset no matter what the occupation or status in 
life. 
Aims Sought Through Language Training 
Two great aims express the results we should seek in lan- 
guage teaching: 
1. Ease, fluency, enjoyment and accuracy in the use of 
oral speech. 
2. Ease, effectiveness, enjoyment and accuracy in the use 
of written speech. 
To the attainment of these ends, certain knowledge, atti- 
tudes and skills are required. 
Knowledge required—The child’s earlier beginnings 
in language are all made (1) through the impulse leading 
to speech and (2) through the impulse leading to imitation. 
It is natural and necessary for the child to develop speech. 
It is just as natural and necessary that he shall begin by 
‘copying whatever speech he hears, whether it be English or 
Choctaw, whether it be the correct diction of the classical 
scholar or the slang of the gutter-snipe. Imitation remains| 
throughout life an important factor in. developing goo 
speech, yet certain knowledge becomes necessary as a guide. 
188
-P-A-G-E-203
, " LANGUAGE 189 
The child should be trained in such knowledge as. will 
lead to the following results : 
1. Broadening and enriching the vocabulary. 
2. Ability to recognize correct and incorrect forms of 
speech. 
3. Familiarity with the standards of good articulation 
and enunciation. 
4. An understanding of the common faults of expression 
and how they are to be remedied. 
5. Knowledge of how to organize thought for effective 
speaking or writing. 
6. Knowledge of how to assemble material in written 
paragraphs. 
7. Knowledge of the use of capital letters and punctua- 
tion marks. 
8. Knowledge of correct grammatical usages. 
9. Knowledge of the forms of business and. social cor- 
respondence. 
Attitudes to be developed.—Much of the slovenly, care- 
less speech constantly to be heard among our people is to be 
accounted for by lack of interest in good speech. Most per- 
sons know how to speak and write much better than they do 
these things. It is largely a question of standards, a matter 
of desiring to command beautiful and effective speech. 
Training in language should then first of all lead children 
to desire to become good speakers and writers of their 
thoughts. This does not mean that they must become orators 
and authors, but that they shall have pride in good expres- 
sion, though it may relate to the humblest affairs. They 
must come to have a satisfaction in good articulation and 
enunciation, and to feel humiliation over lack of ability in 
these things. Their standards must be so developed that 
they will not permit themselves unskilful utterance, incor- 
rect pronunciations or errors in grammar. Further, good 
 
-P-A-G-E-204

standards must come to be desired from within, and not 
seem to be imposed from without. 
The course in language training should lead children to en- 
joy written expression, instead of finding it a task and a bug- 
bear as so many do. If the outcome of language training is 
a distaste for all written work, if it makes the pupil dread 
the writing of a story, a paper or a letter, then the work has 
in large degree been a failure, no matter what the technical 
knowledge acquired. It is a sorry end to one’s training 
which gives him-the mechanics of composition, and leaves 
him without inspiration or impulse to express himself in 
writing. 
Skills sought.—As already implied the success of lan- 
guage teaching can only be measured by the extent to which 
it affects the skill displayed by the children in their daily oral 
and written speech. The language teacher should therefore 
every now and then ask himself how far his instruction is 
actually transforming the speech of his pupils. 
The teacher of language should aim at such skills as the 
following: 
Oral skills. 1. Facility, readiness, fluency. All stumbling 
speech, poor articulation, or other handicaps of expression 
should be given definite treatment—individual treatment if 
necessary. 
2. A pleasing voice and clear enunciation. Shrill raucous 
tones, throaty utterance, or other such mannerisms should 
be removed. Many persons also have an unpleasant laugh 
or facial habit which, with a little attention, could be cor- 
rected. 
3. Clear concise expression in simple language. Every 
one has noticed the difference in clearness of meaning shown 
by different speakers, teachers or conversationalists. Such 
differences arise in part from differences in clearness of

              LANGUAGE 191 
thinking, and in part from differences in ability in expres- 
sion. Early training has much to do with this skill. 
4. Ability to think while speaking. There are plenty of 
people who can speak if they are not required to think at 
the same time, or who can think if they are not required to 
speak while thinking. But one needs to be able to unfold 
an idea while expressing it. It is this power that makes the 
good conversationalist, the strong public speaker, the skilful 
lawyer or debater. The language training of children should 
have this aim clearly in mind, and give much practise to in- 
sure its attainment. 
Skill in writing. 1. Ease, readiness, effectiveness. There 
are many who possess fluency in oral speech, but whose ex- 
pression becomes labored and stiff when they attempt to 
write. Their brain pathways seem to be sufficiently open 
between their thought centers and speaking centers, but 
not between their thought centers and writing centers. The 
only way to get brain pathways open is by using them. 
2. Orderly arrangement of material. should develop 
from month to month in organizing the points under a single 
topic and arranging them in connected order to form a 
paragraph. As age and development increase the power 
should grow to use a series of paragraphs to form a longer 
discussion. 
3. Use of correct language forms. Skill in writing should 
so develop that the child naturally and habitually uses as 
good grammar as he knows. This is to say that carelessness 
and incorrect forms coming from bad speech habits should 
gradually be weeded out, so that the written speech may rise 
to the level of the child’s knowledge mastery of his mother 
tongue. This will mean to eliminate the “I didn’t think” 
errors.   
       
       
4. Automatic and habitually correct use of capitals, punc-      
-P-A-G-E-206
        
     
                192 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
tuation marks and spelling. One boy, when chided by his 
teacher for being late with his composition, responded with 
the hopeful information that he had it all written and only 
needed time to go through and punctuate it! It is to be 
feared that all too many pupils learn and handle the mechan- 
ics of composition in the same way. The aim here must be 
to make the use of capitals, periods, commas, etc., so familiar 
that they drop into place almost without thought or attention. 
This, it is needless to say, will require much drill and prac- 
tise. 
Skill in interpretation. Imagination, like memory or ob- 
servation, responds readily to stimulus and training. Lan- 
guage instruction, equally with reading, should strengthen 
this picturing, vivifying power of the mind. To recreate the 
characters and action of the story, to become the person- 
age represented in dramatizing, to make real in one’s own 
mind the situations and persons of the original story written 
or told—these are all training for the imagination. 
        
                
  Material for Language Instruction       We shall find help in selecting language material by re- 
membering that speech naturally arises out of the desire to 
express some interest, need or problem immediately con- 
nected with our experience. Language normally is never for 
a moment separate from the things we think, the things we 
plan, or the things we do. The material for the child’s in- 
struction in language should in similar fashion originate in 
precisely the same way—it should grow out of his immediate 
interests and activities. The great problem is to make the 
language instruction take hold of the real, every-day speech 
of the child and thus grow into habit. All too much of the 
teaching of the best of us fails to carry across to the point 
where it produces actual results in applied skill.                                    
      
   
-P-A-G-E-207
  LANGUAGE 193 
More specifically, the following are some of the more im- 
portant sources from which language material may be 
drawn: 
1. Activities in which the child is engaged—The cen- 
ter of interest and the most powerful motive to expression 
with children are found in their immediate activities. Their 
plays and games, their little tasks and duties at home, the 
picnic or excursion, the raising of their prize poultry, the 
producing of their club acre of corn, their canning club work 
—all these they like to talk about and write about. In them | 
one of the strongest language motives is found. And unless 
language springs from some inner motive that prompts ex- 
pression, the speech will be artificial and formal, and little 
good come from the training. 
The same principle holds with reference to the activities 
connected with the child’s other studies. They are all fruit- 
ful in language material. The lesson in geography or his- 
tory, the field excursion in nature study, the experiment in 
physiology, a community enterprise in civics—these are the 
very heart of the language material. They supply thoughts 
calling for expression and make the expression worth while 
because it attaches to genuine material instead of to formal 
“exercises.” 
2. Interest in persons and objects.—Intimately con- 
nected with the child’s activities are the persons and objects 
of his immediate environment. Indeed, most of his activ- 
ities grow out of these relations. The child’s home and fam- 
ily; his playmates; days and seasons; birds and bees and 
animal playmates, trees and flowers and growing crops, all 
are sources of the richest language material. 
3. Stories—The immediate activities and environment 
of the child do not, however, supply a broad enough basis 
for language work. Experience needs to be broadened, ideas 
enriched and imagination trained to work with material out- 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
Py | 
194 CLASS-ROOM METHOD 4 ND MANAGEMENT | 
side the range of direct contact and associations. Stories 
quicken the sympathies, cultivate a knowledge of desirable 
and undesirable personal qualities, develop the sense of 
humor, store the memory with interesting material, and sup- 
ply good models of speech for imitation. The stories told 
the children are more real than those read, at least in all 
the earlier grades, and will be more productive of spontane- 
ous expression. | 
The story will serve as the natural and effective basis of 
correlation between language and reading. These two as- 
pects of the study of the mother tongue should go hand in 
hand, each supplementing and reenforcing the other. Stories 
told as the basis for the reading lesson may well be used for 
language work, or vice versa. So closely are these two lines 
correlated in the lower grades of some of our best schools 
| that they are hardly separable. On the whole, however, the 
course in language will need to add a considerable number of 
stories to. those already listed for the reading work. Yet 
care must be taken not to give the child more stories than he 
can assimilate. Children enjoy having favorite stories re- 
peated, and it is far better to repeat good stories until they 
are well mastered than to tell so mamy that the child but 
partially grasps them. 
4. Pictures——Children like to study pictures. Pictures 
speak a language that all can understand. They are worth 
while in themselves as educational material, and they afford 
an inexhaustible source of stimuli for expression, both oral 
and written. A part of the equipment of every school should 
be a supply of pictures representing masterpieces adapted to 
the respective grades. These can be obtained for a few cents 
each in excellent copies. 
5. Letter-writing—This is one of the most fruitful 
sources of language material. Furthermore, it is one of the 
most fruitful lines of language training. A very small pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  LANGUAGE 195 
portion of our pupils will become authors, journalists, etc. ; 
but all of them should become writers of interesting. and 
attractive social letters to friends and family, and of clear 
and concise business letters to those with whom they have 
dealings. 
The great thing in the use of this material is to make the 
situations real. For only this will call forth spontaneous 
expression. Let actual letters be written to friends, rel- 
atives, or business houses, and let them be sent. Only in 
this way will the real language power of the child develop 
through letter-writing. It is well also to bring samples of 
good letters, or printed collections of letters, before the class 
for study. 
6. Future plans and interests——While children live 
very largely in an actual present, they also build for them- 
selves ideal presents and imaginary futures. Many of these 
dreams are too personal and intimate for the child to be will- 
ing to express them to a world of whose sympathy and un- 
derstanding he is not sure. On the other hand, certain of 
these mental creations he is eager to express. The trips he 
would like to take, the places he would like to visit, the voca- 
tions he would like to pursue, the adventures he would like 
to have, are all very real to his imagination and come ready 
to his tongue or pen. 
7. Errors common to every-day speech.—While lan- 
guage teaching must in the main be constructive and pre- 
sent a positive plan of action, it must, nevertheless, not fail 
to deal with errors as they arise. Teachers should be alert 
for speech errors, and keep a note-book record of them for 
constant reference. Children should occasionally be asked 
to tell or write for the teacher, errors which they have 
caught themselves making. Drill should at once follow to 
eliminate such errors. Eternal vigilance on the part of all 
concerned is the price that must be paid for good speech.

Especially should care be used to. Biskingte the grosser 
forms of slang which constitute so large an element in the | 
speech of many persons. Undoubtedly there are slang words 
or phrases so expressive and so unoffensive that they deserve 
a permanent place in our speech. But no small! part of the 
slang used has its rise in mental laziness or sheer poverty of 
vocabulary. It is easier to say that a certain thing is “swell,” 
or “great,” or “fierce” than to find suitable words in which 
to express the shade of meaning intended. In fact such 
speech saves intending any definite meaning whatever, and 
so leads to loose and inaccurate thought. 
No doubt another motive back of the use of slang is the 
fact that in certain social classes it is “quite the thing” 
use the jargon of the group. While language training should 
not expect nor attempt to make verbal purists of our chil- 
dren it should save them from the evil effects of the cruder 
forms of the slang of the day. 
Grammar.—There can be no doubt that in the past 
our children have been taught too much technical grammar 
and too little of the expression side of speech. A decided 
change in emphasis has taken place in recent years, but even 
yet many schools introduce difficult grammar material far 
too early. Grammar deals with the formal, the logic, side of 
language. It supplies the rigid rules by which to test the 
linguistic correctness of one’s speech. It gives a knowl-| 
edge of the structure of the language and makes one more 
fully understand his mother tongue. 
Grammar is a necessary part of the study of language, but 
as a formal separate branch it should not come earlier tha 
the eighth grade. Even then grammar should consist onl, 
of the practically essential phases of the subject, leaving th 
more technical aspects for the high school. 
First-grade language material.—The language work o: 
the first grade will be almost if not quite all oral. The mos
-P-A-G-E-211
LANGUAGE 197 
natural beginning is with the play and home interests. For 
example, the teacher asks such questions as the following: 
How many of the class played on Saturday? What did you 
play, John? Who was captain? What did you do? The 
child’s oral responses, put together, make a story as follows :*    
     
      
   
   
   
      
    
    
   
    
   Saturday I played soldier with my brothers. 
My big brother was captain. 
The baby carried the flag. 
I beat the drum. 
Questions on another interest may yield the following: 
I have a large doll. 
Her name is Arabella. 
She has light hair. 
She has a little bed. 
She has eyes that go to sleep. 
Stories and poems. The stories listed for the various 
grades in the chapter on Reading will furnish an excellent 
basis for language work also, and should be used for this 
purpose. After the story has been told the children, the 
teacher: should ask questions about the characters, or the 
incidents, etc. The children are required to answer in full 
entences. The simpler stories may be dramatized. As the 
hild gains in language ability, he is asked to tell the stories 
fter hearing them. A few stories adapted to first-grade 
language work follow: 
The Little Gray Pony, Lindsay 
The Dog and His Shadow, 7Esop 
Wynken, Blynken and Nod, Field 
The Shet-up Pony, Story-tell-Lib 
Finding the Baby Moses, the Bible

Pictures. Such pictures as those of the following list are 
adapted to first-grade children. In studying pictures the 
teacher should aid the children in understanding them, but 
be careful not to make the work critical or technical in any 
degree. Let the children just enjoy the pictures and come 
to love them. They will be ready to tell the “story” told in 
the picture, giving names to the children or animal pets, etc., 
shown in it. The pupils may also be asked to suggest a name 
for the picture. This will help to bring out the thought it 
contains, and will give material for language instruction: 
     
   
    
     
    The Brothers, Vogel 
Squirrels, Landseer 
Feeding the Birds, Millet 
Madonna of the Chair, Raphael 
Interior of the Cottage, Israels 
The Knitting Lesson, Millet 
Girl with a Cat, Holker 
Feeding the Sheep, Jacque 
First Steps, Millet 
Bambina, Robbia 
Errors to be corrected. This list must, of course, grow ou! 
of the children’s speech as heard by the teacher. The bes} 
time to correct an error is at the time it is made. If the chil 
is in the midst of a story, however, he should not be inter 
rupted. Fluency and spontaneity are worth more than co 
rectness at this stage. The error can be corrected when t 
story is finished. Some of the errors to be expected are: 
T seen him when he done it. 
I run all the way to school. 
Him and me. 
Gimme that there book. 
John he said it was me.

   Second-grade language material.—Conversation based 
on topics of interest in the home or at school should be an 
important part of the second-grade work. The aim at this 
point is to encourage ready expression of familiar thought 
and feeling. The child has now gained more independence, 
and should be able to give connected series of sentences, or 
tell a “story” of which the following is a fair sample: 
T have a little black dog. 
His name is Bobs. 
Bobs likes to play tricks. 
He runs off with my shoes. 
He came into the house with dirty feet. 
My mother drove him out. 
Care should be emphasized at this stage to secure com- 
lete sentence expression. For variety, but without giving 
he names, the exclamation and question type of sentence 
should be encouraged. 
Stories and poems. The child should during this year be 
aining in power to notice the sequence of events in a story 
nd reproduce the order and more important details in his 
eproduction of it. The teacher may if necessary offer such 
uggestions as, “What came first?’—“And then ?”’—“And 
ext?” 
The following stories may be used to supplement those 
iven in the reading list: 
Wee Willie Winkie, Kipling 
Why the Sea is Salt, Bryant 
One, Two, Tiree, Bunner 
Seven Times One, Ingelow 
The New Year's Greeting, Lowell

200 CLASS-ROOM METICOD AND MANAGEMENT ; 
The following stories or others of the same grade should 
be dramatized: 
The Elves and the Shoe- A Toby Thanksgiving 
maker The Valiant Mr. Blackbird 
David and Jonathan The Ugly Duckling 
One Eye, Two Eyes, Three Parts of Hiawatha 
Eyes 
Pictures. Continue the study of pictures such as the 
following : 
Brittany Sheep, Bonheur 
Pilgrims Going to Church, Boughton 
The Arrwal of the Shepherds, LeRolle 
The Gleaners, Millet 
St. John and the Lamb, Murillo 
The Little Scholar, Bouguereau 
A Helping Hand, Renouf 
I Hear a Voice, Earl 
Wake Up, Barber 
Children of the Shell, Murillo 
Errors to be corrected. The time has not yet arrived for 
giving the grammatical reasons for corrections. Stress the 
correct forms and try to awaken a pride in their use. Watch 
for such errors as the following: 
We et it up. 
I ain’t got no pencil ner nothing. 
Ain’t they any school to-day? | 
I knowed it was broke. 
They was five of us. 
He would of tore it. 
I’m thinkin’ you was afraid. 
Written expression. Written language should begin wit! 
the simple sentences which have been used in oral expression| 
From the first the child should learn to begin a statemen’ 
with a capital and end it with a period. He should als

    learn to capitalize J and O and the names of persons and 
places, the days of the week and the months, and put a ques- 
tion mark after a question. He should be taught to write 
complete sentences. 
Such abbreviations as are frequently used in written 
work should be taught, as Mr. Mrs., St., Ave., and the 
names of the months. It is now time also to teach several 
of the commoner contractions, as I’ll, I’m, dow’t, isn’t, aren't, 
haven't, hasn't. The child should know his own address, and 
be able to write it correctly. 
Third- and fourth-grade language material—The gen- 
eral plan of determining the material for the first two grades 
is to be continued. Interesting, wide-awake thought must be 
compelled as the basis for every lesson. Sharp attention 
must be secured for abundant drills and reviews on all 
formal or mechanical phases of the work. It is wholly use- 
less to try to proceed without ideas in the child’s mind press- 
ing for expression; it is equally useless to try to proceed 
without giving opportunity for much spontaneous expres- 
sion, both oral and written. 
As the child’s home, school, community and occupational 
interests broaden, the situations suitable for language in- 
struction to be found in them become endless. The study 
of local geography, neighborhood civics, hygiene, biography 
and history, furnishes rich opportunities for correlating 
language work with the other school subjects. The great 
problem now is to make every lesson in some degree a 
anguage lesson, so that the pupil will realize that language 
tandards and facts are not just for the language class, but 
or constant use. 
Stories and poems. Stories and poems should now be 
oving forward to a central place as the basis of material. 
he same stories may in large measure serve both for read- 
\

ing and for language material. Suppose, for example, that 
the study for to-day is based on Who Stole the Bird’s Nest? 
“To-whit! To-whit! To-whee! 
Will you listen to me? 
Who stole four eggs I laid, 
And the nice nest I made?” 
“Not I,” said the cow, “Moo-oo! 
Such a thing I’d never do. 
I gave you a wisp of hay, 
But didn’t take your nest away. 
Not I,” said the cow, “Moo-oo! 
Such a thing I’d never do.” 
   
    
         
   The poem may be made the liveliest kind of a reading 
lesson. After being read it may be reproduced orally as a 
language lesson. It has a variety of punctuation marks and 
may be used for instruction and drill upon these. It illus- 
trates a number of uses of capitals, which may be taught. It 
has contractions and quotations to be studied. It has the 
movement, sparkle and interest to make it a good memoriz- 
ing selection. Thus we find in one short production material 
for both the idea side and the more formal drill aspect of 
language study. 
Additional stories and poems, suitable for third- and 
fourth-grade language work: 
Sweet and Low, Tennyson 
The Village Blacksmith, Longiellow 
Jack Frost, Gould 
The Wind and the Moon, Macdonald v 
The Barefoot Boy, Whittier 
The Corn Song, Whittier 
Planting the Apple Tree, Bryant

September, Jackson 
Jim Crow, Scollard
-P-A-G-E-217
LANGUAGE 203 
Lucy Gray, Wordsworth 
Down to Sleep, Jackson 
A Boy's Song, Hogg 
Dramatizing should continue, with constant effort made 
to have the children enter as fully as possible into the char- 
acters they represent. The emotional element should not 
be forced at this stage. 
A study of the biographies of our national heroes, writers, 
inventors, etc., should form part of the language work for 
these grades. Washington, Patrick Henry, Lincoln, Grant, 
Longfellow, Whittier, Edison, are names that suggest much 
fruitful material. Care must be taken that the emphasis is 
not placed on matters beyond the grasp of the child in these 
studies. Let the human side predominate—character, ideals, 
service, general achievement. 
Oral work should in these grades predominate over writ- 
ten work. 
Picture study. There can, of course, be no one list of 
pictures made to include just those that should be given 
the child from grade to grade. The principle which must 
govern is to keep within the range of the child’s compre- 
hension and interest. The following have been found suit- 
able for third- or fourth-grade study: 
The Haymakers, Dupré 
Holy Family, Murillo 
Feeding the Hens, Millet 
At the Watering Trough, Bouveret 
Christ in the Temple, Hofmann 
Red Deer, Landseer 
Shoeing the Bay Mare, Landseer

      204 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND 
Errors to be corrected. Do not fail to m ke corrections 
of errors as they appear in the daily speech f pupils. The 
longer an error is continued the harder the habit will be 
to break. Keep watch for such expressions as the follow- 
ing: p | 
I et.my apple, have you et yourn? 
Joe has went to school. | 
I feel kind of sick. 
He trew it away and I can’t find it nowhere. 
These kind of pen are no good. 
I cn git it if you lemme alone. 
Whaddaya want it fur? 
John learned me to curve a ball. | 
Letter-writing. Letter-writing should be begun in the 
third grade. Only the simplest forms should at first be 
taught. They should be written to friends, relatives or 
playmates, and deal with matters of home and school in- 
terest. | 
The following are fair samples (without the full letter 
form) of letters written by fourth-grade pupils of Massa- 
chusetts schools :* \ 
Dear FRANK: | 
John told us this morning that you are in bed with a 
heavy cold. Iam very sorry. I hope the doctor is not mak- 
ing you take medicine. I hate to take medicine. We began 
a new story in class yesterday. The name is “The Blue 
Bird.” Perhaps your mother will get it and read it to you. 
I know you will like it. © Your friend,

good news. Both Mary and I are to be promoted to Grade

Capitals and punctuation. The principal uses of capitals 
should be known by the end of the fourth year, and such 
skill developed in their more common uses that mistakes 
are rare. The abbreviations commonly met in reading and 
those used in writing should be well taught and their punc- 
tuation assured.. The contractions used in every-day speech 
and writing should be mastered, and their formation under- 
stood. By the end of the fourth grade the following uses 
of punctuation marks should have been taught: 
       
         
    
              
     
            
    
   
       Period following statement or command. 
Period after abbreviations. 
Interrogation point after questions. 
Exclamation point after exclamations. 
Apostrophe in contractions. 
Comma .in a series of words where connective is omitted. 
Comma separating name of person addressed from rest of 
sentence. 
Apostrophe in possessive singular. 
Hyphen in broken word at end of line. 
Fifth- and sixth-grade language material—The point 
of view will not change greatly in these grades from that 
of the third and fourth grades. We should still keep close 
to the great central interests of the pupils. We should also 
seek to broaden and enrich those interests by the study of 
literature, history, current events, industries, etc. What- 
ever grips the higher enthusiasms and serves to set free the 
impulse to expression is goed language material. Oral ex- 
pression should still exceed written. 
Such topics as those below are suitable for oral or writ- 
ten work for fourth and fifth grades. The children should 
be taught to organize their thoughts for expression. They 
should be taught to stand erect when they speak; to speak 
distinctly ; to talk to the point; to use correct English and 
ake their story interesting.

Stories and poems. Stories and poems should continue 
as the basis of a considerable proportion of the language 
work. The pupils should be taught to express a story sum- 
mary interestingly and clearly in their own words, keeping 
the sequence of incidents and events. The practise of a com- 
plete or literal paraphrase of poems is of doubtful value, 
since this exercise is certain to kill something of the beauty 
of the production. 
Letter-writing. Letter-writing should be extended to in- 
clude business letters. The difference in fulness and style 
of letters of friendship and those of business should be 
made clear. ‘Business letters should include orders for 
goods, applications for a position, answers to advertisements, 
etc. 
Capitals and punctuation. By the end of the sixth grade 
the child should have in his possession a knowledge of all 
the more common uses of capitals and the punctuation 
marks. He should be able to use these marks with reason- 
able certainty and accuracy, as shown by his written exer- 
cises in all school work, He should be able to determine the 
pronunciation of a word from its diacritical marks, and 
should know how to find the word quickly in the dictionary. 
Correction of errors. As long as errors continue in the 
speech of pupils, that long will the teacher need to continue 
correcting them and drilling on the correct forms. Pupils 
should be required to keep a list of their worst errors, and 
be encouraged to drill themselves in correcting them. 
In a special report of the Boise schools,t a summary is 
made of the classes of errors in speech made by pupils, as 
heard by their teachers on playground, in class room or else- 
where, covering a period of six years. The errors are 
grouped under the following six heads, with the percentage 
of the total number of errors charged against each group:

         Grammar. The beginnings of grammar should be made 
in the sixth grade. The first matter taught should be the 
recognition, and then the formulation, of the four classes 
of sentences: declarative, imperative, interrogatory and ex- 
clamatory. The simple sentence should also be taught, with 
the subject and predicate and their word or simple phrase 
modifiers. 
Seventh- and eighth-grade language material_—The 
language material for the seventh and eighth grades should 
be a continuation and expansion of that of earlier grades, 
with the essentials of grammar added. Says Professor C. A. 
McMurry: 
“How to get an introduction to technical grammar with- 
out losing connection with every-day, useful English is a 
serious problem. The difficulty in trying to teach grammar 
in the upper grades is that there is no good halting place. 
Once enmeshed in the technical phases of grammar, teachers 
are impelled to go on and on, till the practical uses of gram- 
mar are swallowed up in the technique of classifications, in- 
flections, and definitions,”? 
The skilful language teacher will not allow grammar thus 
to depart from its practical uses. Oral and written ex- 
pression will remain the groundwork of language study 
even in the later grades, but the grammatical relations nec- 
essary to intelligence in the use of the mother tongue will 
mot be neglected. Grammar must not be taught as an end in 
itself, but as a means to better use of speech and ability in 
eading.

    210 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
The study of grammar should enable the child to under- 
stand the reasons for the corrections that have been made in 
his speech forms in the earlier grades, It should also give 
him, through the study of sentence structure, greater ability 
to interpret thought in his reading of difficult matter. 
Points to stress in grammar. Many of the text-books in 
grammar still in use in the schools contain an excess of over- 
technical material having little or no relation to the child’s 
speech or interpretation in reading. It is therefore necessary 
for the teacher to know the points at which children are 
most liable to make errors in their speech, and then teach 
those phases of grammar that apply. The following have 
been found to be “danger points” in grammar which most 
need attention,? | 
1. A knowledge of the sentence, in order that a complete 
sentence may always be recognized for purposes of punctu- 
ation in writing, and also for its relation to clear thinking 
and expression. | 
2. The noun; proper, in order to capitalize; possessive 
form; uses as subject, complement, object. 
3. The personal pronoun; especially objective and certain 
possessive forms; uses of which, that, what, who and whom. 
4. The adjective; distinction from adverbs; compari- 
son ; capitalization of proper adjectives. — 
5. The verb; transitive and intransitive ; agreement witt 
subject in person and number; plural with compound sub: 
ject; past participle not used for past tense. The verb i 
responsible for a large proportion of the errors of speech 
and should receive special attention. 
6. The adverb; comparison; special attention to the “ly’ 
forms. | 
7. Sentence order, with reference especially to modifier: 
in wrong positions.

What to omit—-Based on a study made by Dean W. W. 
Charters of the grammar needs of children,’ a committee 
of the Iowa State Teachers’ Association recommends the 
following omissions from grammar instruction in the 
grades :* A 
The exclamatory sentence; the interjection; the apposi- 
tive ; the nominative of address; the nominative of exclama- 
tion ; the objective complement ; the adverbial objective; the 
indefinite pronouns ; the objective used as a substantive ; the 
classification of adverbs; the noun clause; conjunctive ad- 
verbs; the retained objective ; the modes (except possibly the 
subjunctive of “to be”); the infinitive; the objective sub- 
ject; the participle except the definition and the present and 
past forms; the nominative absolute ; the gerund nominative 
absolute; sentences for analysis.and parsing that involve 
subtle points of grammar; formal parsing; conjugation; 
diagramming ; person of nouns. 
Organization and Presentation 
In the section on selection of material much direct or in- 
irect reference has been made to methods of organization 
nd presentation. No extended discussion will be required, 
erefore, at this place. 
Securing expression.—The first requisite in successful 
nguage teaching is to secure spontaneous expression. The 
Ider logical method was to teach rules, principles, facts 
and their exceptions!), trusting that these would in some 
ay carry over to the practical use of speech and serve as a 
ide. But the larger part of such material thus taught

212 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
never made connection with speaking and writing. It re- 
mained as so much unused verbal lumber in the mind. 
The newer and better -psychological method starts with 
expression. It seeks to get the child to speaking and writing 
his thoughts freely and effectively, even if not at first with 
rigid grammatical correctness. It then undertakes to elimi- 
nate errors and cultivate the grammatical sense on this basis 
of actual speech. The spirit of freedom and good fellow- 
ship should therefore prevail in the highest degree during 
the language period. For where constraint and constant 
criticism are, there spontaneity and expression do not flour- 
ish. Nor will the good teacher monopolize the language time 
with his own speaking, no matter how excellent this speakin; 
may be. On the whole, the best language teaching is tha 
which most stimulates the child’s thought and expressio: 
with a minimum of speech, except in story-telling, on th 
part of the teacher. Stenographic reports have shown tha 
the teacher often uses more than three times as many word! 
as all the pupils together in a language recitation! 
Extending the vocabulary——The child first comes t 
school with a vocabulary seldom reaching much above on| 
thousand words. One of the chief functions of languag 
teaching is to extend this vocabulary. But a vocabular 
can not be extended faster than ideas develop; for wor 
that do not serve as the vehicle for ideas are useless, and th 
are not used. The vocabulary may also need refinii 
through the elimination of coarse or uncouth words ai 
phrases. 
The vocabulary can be expanded (1) by noting and m 
tering new words from stories, poems, etc.; (2) by learni 
the new words that appear in other school subjects; (3) 
observing new words in the speech of others. The gr 
thing in this connection is to cultivate in the pupils the spi 
cf curiosity about new words. Stimulate them to look wy 
   
-P-A-G-E-227
LANGUAGE 213 
new word as legitimate game (or a dangerous adversary) 
which must be tracked down and captured. The utter indif- 
ference with which many pupils will pass over a word with- 
out knowing its meaning or adding it to their vocabulary 
indicates inefficient teaching at this point. 
The dictionary habit should be cultivated from the fourth 
grade on. But dictionary definitions alone do not suffice. The 
purpose of learning a new word is not simply to know its 
meaning, but to add it to one’s own vocabulary. Therefore 
the new word must be pressed into service. It must be set 
t work in oral or written sentences. 
The use of blanks in sentences and stories.—One great 
ifficulty that all language teachers have to fight against is 
he failure of pupils to carry what they learn into actual 
ractise. The use of blank spaces in sentences or stories, 
lhe spaces to be filled by the pupils from a list of words 
upplied, is helpful in this connection. New words, homo- 
ms and correct language forms may be presented by this 
evice. 
Encouraging original expression—Children need to 
ad, hear and memorize as models the beautiful poems and 
teresting stories of which there are so many now available. 
ut they also need to be encouraged from the first to try 
cir own wings of expression. The personal story to be 
Id or read to the class, the part written for a school paper 
booklet, or the verses composed to surprise the teacher or 
e mother are all the essence of good language work. Cre- 
ion as well as appropriation is the criterion of effective 
guage teaching. The following verses are samples of

The socialized recitation —As suggested earlier in th 
chapter, the pupil must not only have something to say, bu 
some one to say it to. The language class should constitut 
a real social group. Each one should contribute his fu’ 
share either as speaker or as listener. This will require th 
those who speak shall have something interesting to say 
which the others will care to listen. The ingenious teach 
will find many ways for carrying this principle into practis 
Here are some of the ways that suggest themselves: 
1. The story hour, in which each child tells a story th; 
the others do not know. 
2. A “joke hour,” in which each contributes the best jo! 
he knows. 
3. Current event day allows each child to bring in t 
most interesting event of which he can learn. 
4. Original poems or stories may be presented. 
5. A story may be dramatized. 
6. A school paper may be read. 
7. Reports may be made on an interesting trip taken. 
8. Reports may be made on books or articles read.

The good speech club—Some of the most successful 
teachers have organized their school or room into a language 
club. All are eligible to membership. Each member of the 
club keeps a list of his own errors and of the errors he hears 
in the speech of other members. These errors are turned 
in once a week to the teacher or a secretary who charges the 
errors against the different members. The lists are used 
as the basis of an occasional language lesson, the emphasis 
being placed on the correct form, and drill given. The game 
lis of course to see how few errors can be charged against one 
in the course of a week.   
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Estimate the proportion of time you give to oral and to writ- 
len language work in each of the grades. Do you give enough oral 
ork? 
2. Try to formulate your greatest difficulties in teaching lan- 
tuage. Then review the chapter to see whether you can find sug- 
estions that apply. Do you find children who are backward in ex- 
ression? If so, do you judge the difficulty is from shyness, lack of 
eas, speech defects, or some other trouble? 
3. Consider carefully the subjects in each grade with which you 
ost closely correlate the language work. Do you think you are 
ighting any good material? How do you tie the language work to 
nuine interests instead of abstract themes? Do you ever ask a 
ild to write on a topic about which he has not enough ideas to 
rve as a basis for ready expression? 
4. To what extent do you make pictures the basis of language 
dy? Which do you think the better, pictures such as found in 
le text-book, or masterpieces? Be sure to take into account the 
lue coming from the study of the better picture. Try showing the 
ildren of each grade a considerable number of prints and ask them 
pick the ones they like best. What conclusions do you draw? 
5. Do you agree with the recommendations on grammar? What 
your plan for keeping a record of the errors in speech commonly 
de by your pupils and how do you work for their correction? Do 
secure a reascnable amount of memorizing poems and stories

   from your pupils? Do you teach them how to memorize, as sug- 
gested in the chapter on Reading?

    RITHMETIC has for generations been one of the chief 
A mandoys of the elementary curriculum. Originally it 
came into use as a practical tool employed in trade during the 
Middle Ages. It was not until some centuries later that it 
was deemed of sufficient importance to claim a place in gen- 
eral education. Once secure in the school, it gradually lost 
its concrete and ‘practical character and became a formal 
subject chiefly prized for its “disciplinary” effects. So easily 
did arithmetic lend itself to the formal aim that probably 
nore than half the material found in the older type of texts 
till in use in many schools lacks all direct relation to every- 
ay need for computation. A distinct movement is now 
mder way to bring the subject-matter of arithmetic more 
irectly into touch with practical affairs. 
The Aim of Arithmetic 
Just what is the function of arithmetic in present-day 
ucation?, First of all we must agree that the aim of arith- 
etic can not be expressed in terms of mental discipline. Its 
ain purpose is concrete, direct, practical, applied. It is the 
siness of arithmetic to enable one to do the ordinary num- 
ring and computing required in the common economic and 
cial relations. Without denying whatever disciplinary or 
tural value arithmetic may have, we shall nevertheless . 
Kk upon these values as entirely supplementary and in- 
ental aims and in no sense the controlling factor in either 
terial or method. , Furthermore, the discipline from arith-

ld 
metic can be obtained at least as well from useful as from 
useless material. 
The knowledge required.—From this point of view it 
follows that the knowledge required in arithmetic is of the 
sort that fits into the real situations to be met in home, in 
shop, in business or on the farm. Complicated and involved 
processes, not employed in genuine affairs; tables and meas- 
" ures not in common use; formulas, rules and highly special- 
ized methods foreign to business computation are all outside 
the true purpose of elementary arithmetic and should be ex- 
cluded from it. 
On the other hand the fundamental tables and measures, 
the simplest and shortest methods of business computations 
and the practical application of arithmetic to the concrete 
problems of daily life must be a fundamental part of the 
education of every intelligent person. Not how wide a range 
of “pure” arithmetic one may know, but the thoroughness 
with which he knows or can apply the relatively few funda- 
mentals is the final test. 
The study of arithmetic in the grades should give the child 
the following knowledge: 
1. How to count objects of all kinds. How to count b: 
naming numbers only. How to count by twos, threes, etc. 
2. How to read and write numbers of ten to twelve fig: 
ures. : 
3. The tables and processes involved in addition, sub 
traction, multiplication and division of whole numbers. 
4. Common fractions, and their addition, subtractio: 
multiplication, and division with the use of such denomin: 
tors as are commonly used in business. A similar knowled 
of decimals involving up to three places. 
5. The common tables and measures employed in t 
ordinary life routine of the average man or woman. The 
are: measures of length, angle, surface, volume and capa| 
ity, quantity, weight, time, money, value.
-P-A-G-E-233
   ARITHMETIC 
6. Our monetary system, denominations, and the various 
business practises involving the use of checks, drafts, notes, 
mortgages, etc. 
7. Percentage, and its simpler applications to practical 
business uses. 
8. Simple mensuration, applied to lines, angles, surfaces, 
volumes. 
Attitudes to be developed.—Teaching arithmetic as a 
practical tool daily to be employed in all sorts of common 
affairs should result in the everett of certain attitudes 
toward its study and use: 
1. A tendency not to be satisfied with guessing or ap- 
proximation, but to insist on finding out through the use of 
figures on all essential matters involving numerical values. 
2. Standards of business accuracy that will result in the 
keeping of an accurate account of all personal or household 
receipts and expenditures. This will make possible a proper 
adjustment of expenditure to income, and also a right bal- 
ance among the different objects for which money is spent. 
3. Unwillingness to rely on general estimates or rough 
approximations with reference to projects planned, as im- 
proving a home or a farm, taking a trip, investing in an 
automobile, etc. 
4. Insistence on detailed and accurately kept ear of 
profits or losses from the different enterprises of farm, shop 
lor business. . 
5. The development of such a sense of values and the in- 
vitable logic of figures as will render one proof against the 
et-rich-quick schemes planned by unscrupulous promoters 
o catch those who through ignorance of business believe 
ealth to be attained by some kind of magic. 
6. A sense of pleasure and satisfaction in the use of fig- 
res and in the certainty which comes from their wise appli- 
ation to one’s affairs. 
It is quite as much the purpose of arithmetic to develop

{ 
these attitudes toward its use as to supply the knowledge of. 
its processes. Good teaching will direct the instruction to 
this end. : 
The training of skills—The material of arithmetic may 
roughly be divided into two groups: (1) that in which the 
facts to be mastered require but the simplest forms of as- 
sociation, with a minimum of reasoning; as, for example, 
counting, reading and writing numbers, and the combinations 
in addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of whole 
numbers or fractions. And (2) the logical or thought proc- 
esses by which these fundamental numerical relations are ap- 
plied to the solutions of problems. | 
The first of these, the operations involved in counting, 
notation, numeration, and addition, subtraction, multiplica- 
tion and division should as rapidly as possible be made so 
automatic that they require no hesitancy or thought when 
called for. They must be so securely lodged and so certain 
that they claim no attention to themselves, but leave the mind 
free for the logical relations, the true thought elements, in- 
volved in the problem. They must also be so accurate and 
proof against error that mistakes in adding, subtracting, 
multiplying or dividing will not defeat all the reasoning 
done on the problem. | 
There is no question but that we fail at this point. Our 
system of arithmetic teaching has on the whole not resulted 
in a reasonable accuracy and skill in the use of the funda- 
mentals. Our pupils add, subtract, etc., too slowly and 
make too many mistakes. | 
There is no way, of course, of telling just exactly how 
much skill in ramet and arithmetical reasoning should be 
possessed by pupils of a certain age or grade. We have no 
absolute measures of such things. Yet certain standards of 
skill have been determined by taking the average perform- 
ance of a large number of children ‘in the corresponding

grades of different schools. “If, for example, we know that 
one thousand fifth-grade pupils have been found on the av- 
erage able to add seven sets of columns in eight minutes 
containing certain combinations of figures, we have in this 
fact a fairly accurate standard by which to judge our own 
fifth grade or any individual pupil in it. Such standardized 
tests as these have been carefully devised. The-one most 
widely used is called the Courtis test, which is herewith

The results of the Courtis tests given to thousands of 
children in many different towns and cities show that, to be 
as good as the average, pupils should be able to work the 
following number of examples in the respective grades, with 
one hundred per cent. of accuracy. The examples have been 
so devised that all are of equal difficulty so that a child who 
gets three correct has done exactly half as much as one who 
gets six.

In accordance with the point of view already emphasized, 
the material we teach in arithmetic must be selected to ac- 
complish the aim we desire to reach. In general this will
-P-A-G-E-238
  224 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT j 
mean to teach Jess arithmetic and teach it better. The rela- 
tively useless and obsolete matter which has characterized 
many of our texts for years must give way to additional 
drill upon the fundamentals, and to the solution of an abun- 
dance of genuine problems related to actual affairs. 
The first year.—During the first school year the child 
will have some touch, however simple, with fully one-half of 
the eight groups of knowledge mentioned on page 218. The 
following is an approximation of what should be presented 
under ordinary conditions :* 
Counting. Teach to count objects of all sorts up to one 
hundred. Also teach to count by naming numbers only, up 
to one hundred ten; to take half of an object or groups of 
objects. 
Writing and reading numbers. Teach to write all num- 
bers counted; to read all numbers counted; also to read 
numbers from pages of reader as far as the numbers go. 
The critical part here is to drill on the figures from 1 to 19 
until they are quickly and unerringly associated with the 
number counted. Proceeding into the next decades will 
then be relatively easy. 
Using money. Children of the present day very early learn 
the value and use of money in the home. Buying and selling 
can therefore be profitably used as the basis for much prac- 
tical work in developing the number sense. Teach to buy 
and sell using toy or real money, and making change in all 
amounts up to ten cents. 
. Measuring. The child should learn to measure common 
objects in feet and inches with a clearly marked ruler. It 
is better to have inch marks only at first. Also to recognize 
the yard-stick. To recognize pint, quart and gallon meas- 
  
1 Many schools prefer to give less the first year and correspond- 
ingly more later.

  ARITHMETIC 225 
ures, and count number of pints in a quart, and quarts in 
a gallon by use of measures. 
Addition and Subtraction. Practise differs widely on the 
question of teaching formal addition and subtraction during 
the first year. The recent Massachusetts course of study in 
arithmetic (Bulletin 66) leaves all such work until the sec- 
ond year. In states where the school age is fixed at five 
years it is certainly a mistake to attempt any great amount 
of formal instruction in addition and subtraction in the first 
grade. Where these topics are taught, the addition com- 
binations should probably not go beyond about the first 
twenty of the forty-five. The subtraction may be taught by 
the Austrian (or addition) method, thus;

Second year.—Review all work of the preceding year. 
Counting. , Review counting by ones and work for speed 
and certainty. Begin at any place in the series 1-100 and 
count to one hundred. Count by twos, fives and tens to one 
hundred. Build one hundred objects into groups of fives 
or tens, and then count groups to one hundred. 
Writing and reading numbers. Write readily and with 
accuracy all numbers counted. Read numbers as far as 
pages in reader go. Read and write the Roman numerals 
to XII. 
Addition, Review work of first grade. Complete all 
addition facts of the first twenty numbers, thus:

1+1=2 
2+1=3 
2+2=4 
And so on to 10 and 10. equals 20.   
Column addition should be begun, using at first examples 
of one column with the sum not exceeding ten. Extend this 
to numbers of two figures each, columns to consist of three 
or four numbers, thus: 
os it: 5 4 36 
6 21 
2 42 a 3 
2 1 
Addition by endings should also be started at this time, 
using such exercises as the following: 
3 and 2 equals 5, therefore 23 and 2 equals 25. 
6and 5 equals 11, therefore 26 and 5 equals 31. 
Subtraction. Teach subtraction facts of the first twenty 
numbers. This may be done first by the Austrian (addition) 
method, and then by taking away. 
2—1= 
3—1= 
3—2= 
Carry this to 20 —19=— 1. 
Also teach subtraction by endings, as: 
9 — 3 equals 6, therefore 29 — 3 equals 26. 
11 — 4 equals 7, therefore 41 — 7 equals 34.

Multiplication and division. Teach the facts of multi- 
plication and division of the first twenty numbers, as fol- 
lows: 
Two 2’s equal 4 Two 2’sin4 
Three 2’s equal 6 Three 2’s in6 
Four 2’s equal 8 Four 2’sin8

Four 3’s equal 12 Four 3’s in 12 
as far as as far as 
Seven 3’s equal 21 Seven 3’s in 21 
Measuring. Teach to measure with increasing exactness 
the lengths of lines or such objects as tables, desks, boxes, in 
feet, inches, half-inches, or quarter-inches; to measure 
quickly and accurately with pints, quarts and gallons; to 
measure in pecks, half-bushels and bushels where required 
in the work of the school; to weigh in pounds and ounces; 
to know the time of day on the clock; to know day of week 
and month from a calendar; to know and draw straight, 
curved, horizontal and vertical lines. 
Using money. By means of buying and selling with the | 
use of toy or real money teach how to make change in cent, 
five-cent and ten-cent pieces for all amounts up to fifty 
cents. 
Fractions. The child should learn to divide an object or 
group into halves or quarters; to fill a measure half full, 
r empty out one-half; to know a half-hour and a quarter- 
our on the clock. 
Third year.—Continue review and drill on all the fun- 
amentals of the first two years. This is the time to make 
he elementary operations automatic. 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
       228 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND Di elcebdesrs 
Reading and writing numbers. Train to read and write 
numbers of five figures; to read and write all common 
fractions with numerators or denominators of one figure. 
Addition and subtraction. Teach column additions with 
numbers of two and three figures; adding from top of col- 
umn as check for correct result; how to carry from columns 
that add to ten or more; subtraction of numbers of three 
figures ; how to “borrow” when lower number is larger than 
upper; how to test correctness of result in subtraction; 
terms sum, minuend, subtrahend, remainder ; easy problems 
involving addition and subtraction. 
Multiplication and division. Make sure of the following: 
the multiplication tables complete to ten times ten; division 
of numbers of three figures by divisors of one figure; terms 
multiplicand, multipliers, product, dividend, divisor, quo- 
tient, remainder; application of multiplication and division 
to simple concrete problems. 
Measuring. Teach measures of volume, both liquid and 
dry ; lines and surfaces; drawing of squares and rectangles, 
and measuring of their perimeters; horizontal, vertical an 
inclined and parallel lines; right, acute and obtuse angles 
square, rectangle, triangle, circle; all terms employed i 
measuring. ; 
Fractions. Present the following: dividing objects an 
groups into halves, fourths and eighths ; simple problems in 
volving the use of 4, %4, %, 4%, %, etc. 
Using money. Teach the simple operations of buying an 
selling that require the handling of money and making o 
change up to two dollars. 
Fourth year.—The work of this grade is chiefly an e 
tension of the work already begun, as follows: reading an| 
writing numbers carried to seven figures ; addition and sul 
traction will involve much drill in rapid sight work, wi

   written work for accuracy and speed ; multiplication by num- 
bers of two and three figures; division with remainders ; long 
division with divisors of two and three figures. In both the 
fourth and the fifth grades, drills should be given to bring 
the pupils up to the standard of the Courtis tests. Measuring \ 
is to be continued, with chief tables learned and concrete 
problems solved; common fractions extended and decimals 
begun. Many practical problems should be given from this 
time on in all the different phases of the work, both to add 
interest and to show the application of numbers to actual 
affairs. 
Fifth and sixth years——Teach reading and writing 
numbers up to ten figures. Review and drill upon addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division. Drill on factors 
and their products; common fractions added, subtracted, 
multiplied and divided; decimals up to three or four places; 
ixed numbers; all common measures; buying and selling, 
ith losses and gains; percentage in the sixth year; bills and 
eceipts. 
Seventh and eighth years.—The drill for accuracy and 
peed is to be continued in the fundamental operations, both 
ith whole numbers and fractions common to business 
perations. Emphasize the following: extension of meas- 
ring and much practical application to genuine problems; 
xes; life and property insurance; bonds and mortgages ; 
lanking methods; promissory notes; ratio and simple pro- 
lortion ; powers and square root. 
What to Omit in Arithmetic 
If arithmetic is to be taught as an efficient instrument for 
e in solving real problems, much traditional and obsolete 
laterial common to many texts should be omitted. The fol- 
wing wise recommendations for omissions were made by

    Organization and Presentation—Instruction 
The immediate point of contact in arithmetic is found it 
the child’s relations to his environment—the need for num| 
bering and measuring the things about him. Arithmeti 
material should be so organized that it grows out of and ri 
lates to these needs. The knowledge learned and the appl 
cations made will then have a value and call forth an intere: 
unknown where the material is chiefly abstract, or unrelate 
to actual conditions. Arithmetic thus correlated with oth’ 
studies and activities becomes an indispensable tool cot 
stantly used in all common affairs in the school and outsi 
Use of the concrete in elementary number.—The old

   ARITHMETIC 231 
method -was to teach the child to count to ten or to one hun- 
dred in the abstract, and to learn that two and two are four 
in general. When the child first naturally begins to count 
he counts something, and does not merely say over the names 
of numbers. When he first naturally begins to add and sub- 
tract he adds and subtracts objects and not the symbols we 
call figures. The first instruction in number should likewise 
be with objects. These objects should, as far as possible, be 
real objects commonly dealt with in every-day experience, 
and not chiefly splints, pegs, tiles, bits of colored paper, etc., 
which are too artificial for the best results. Apples, pieces of 
candy, the members of the class, the windows of the room, 
desks and a hundred other objects ready at hand afford a 
better type of material. 
Having said we should begin with objects we must now 
hasten to say that objective teaching of number should not 
continue too long. The child must come to think numbers 
in the abstract—to know at once that three and four are 
seven without referring actually or mentally to three objects 
nd four objects. The tendency of many children to add on 
heir fingers or by means of drawing marks is due to failure 
o break away from the objective. 
No rule can be given as to the amount of objective teach- 
ng to employ before advancing to the abstract. The teacher 
ust judge by the response and understanding of the child. 
or will the transition be abrupt. Recourse will often 
e had to objects after abstract work is begun in order to 
lear the child’s understanding of a difficult point, or to 
ake concrete application of some fact learned. The prin- 
iple to keep in mind is that objects are used as an aid in 
eveloping the sense of abstract number, and should not be 
lowed to hinder in this development. 
Processes and their applications—The two broad 
hases of arithmetic mastery have already been mentioned—

   that (1) of the processes, adding, multiplying, etc., and (2) 
the application of these processes to the solution of problems. 
The first of these is to be made mechanical and automatic, 
the second requires logical thinking. 
In the early years, facility in the processes is the primary 
aim. This is to be secured largely by repetition and drill, 
with a minimum of explanation of the reasons involved. For 
example, the child should not at first have explained to him 
why he is to invert the divisor in dividing one fraction by an- 
” other, he is to learn what is to be done, and then to practise 
in this until skill comes. He is not to be troubled in the be- 
ginning with the reasons that underlie factoring and the 
finding of the greatest common divisor; he is to learn the 
process and develop skill in its use. 
This does not mean that arithmetic must be all mechan- 
ical, and thus fail to test and train the power of thinking. 
But the fundamental reasons lying back of many of even 
the simpler number processes are far beyond the grasp of the 
child and will but bewilder and discourage him. The op- 
portunity to train the child in reasoning comes in the applica- 
tion of the elementary processes to the solution of problems. 
And at this point the teacher must not fail, for it is one of 
the best opportunities to be found in the whole range of 
school work. | 
The International Commission on the Teaching of Mathe- 
matics expresses the conviction that “there is still an in- 
evitable tendency among pupils to become formal even in 
what seems real thought work.” A group of this commission 
was testing a certain class of children in their ability to 
think in! arithmetic, and gave them the following problem :4 
“A man hitches up a horse to a buggy and drives three hour: 
at the rate of six miles an hour. How much farther woul

Education, page 76.
-P-A-G-E-247
ARITHMETIC 233 
he have gone if he had hitched up two horses?” All the 
pupils but one in the class doubled the distance. This prob- 
lem was also tried on a large number of children: “If.a duck 
weighs three pounds when it is standing on one leg, what 
does it weigh when standing on two legs?” Nearly all 
answered that it would weigh twice as much. Such errors 
suggest the necessity for teaching children really to read 
problems. 
The teacher must with patience and with skill teach the 
children to think in solving their problems. By leading them 
to see the reasoning involved, and by placing the premium 
of approval or praise on really thoughtful work, the practise 
of guessing, or of working by hook or crook for the “an- 
swer” can be discouraged. Especially can this be done when 
arithmetic is correlated with the other work of the school 
and made to do real and honest service of a practical kind. 
Reviews and drills—The amount of review and drill 
required in the lower grades puts a very great strain on the 
teacher’s ingenuity. For both psychology and experience 
teach us that the price of attention and interest is variety, 
change, novelty. Mere repetition does not constitute drill, 
mor result in skill. Kirby tested over seven hundred fourth- 
rade children for speed and accuracy in addition and then 
ave them sixty minutes’ practise (divided into short peri- 
ds) in adding, each child working under the incentive of 
eeing how much he could better his record. The effect of 
his one hour of practise under stress of keen concentration 
‘as an increase of over fifty per cent. in speed with no loss 
accuracy. The same results were obtained from drill in 
ivision under similar conditions. ‘ 
Singsonging the multiplication table in sleepy concert, 
roning through the combinations in addition, or lazily and 
isurely performing any other drill work is futile, for only 
1 Practice in the Case of School Children, page 12, ff. 
   
-P-A-G-E-248
234 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
an alert mind profits by repetition. The old adage of “ac- 
curacy first, then speed” is false. Accuracy and reasonable 
speed go together, and they should be trained together from 
the first. The skilful teacher will devise games; get up 
competitions, keeping a record of scores posted from day to 
day that each may compare his record with that of others 
and also with his own previous records; arrange devices for 
quick drilling, etc., to supply the required practise and at the 
same time secure the fullest response from the pupils. All 
this demands time, thought and energy on the part of the 
teacher, but nothing easy will succeed. 
There are many simple devices like the circle with a cer- 
tain figure at its center and the figures to be used in com- 
binations with it around the circumference. As the figures 
at the circumference are pointed to by the teacher or a 
pupil the answer is spoken by the one reciting. It is evident 
that such a device can be used for subtraction, multiplication 
and division as well as for addition. The teacher should de- 
velop a plentiful supply of such devices and freely use them., 
Inductive method in arithmetic.—In dealing with the 
thought phases of arithmetic the inductive method should 
as a rule be employed. This means that new topics will be 
developed with objects or illustrations rather than being in- 
troduced by rules and definitions. For example, decimals 
may very easily and naturally be presented by connecting 
them with common fractions. 
Have a list of common fractions written on the board. 
Then have the pupil write the decimal form under each 
common fraction, thus: 
dol dolla to el |e ate ate 
HOM Bini a4. 35 > ii SOL Te 
Repeat with hundredths and thousandths and drill until 
the proper associations are formed. Develop the idea of 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  
ARITHMETIC 235 
percentage in the same way. Have the tables of measures 
developed by actual measuring. Develop rules for finding 
area of squares, rectangles and triangles by drawing to scale 
and counting the resulting units, and so on. 
Standards of success.—Children, like adults, do better 
when they are meeting with a reasonable degree of suc- 
cess. Nothing cripples power and paralyzes effort like the 
discouragement that comes from constant defeat. The child 
must feel a sense of mastery in his work. He must know 
that he is making progress and attaining skill. This all 
argues that our teaching and the child’s learning must be 
thorough and complete enough that our pupils are not lost 
in a haze of doubtful mastery and half-seen truths. Let us 
teach only what can be carried through to reasonably com- 
plete mastery. Then let us be sure of that mastery. : 
The practical carrying out of this point of view will de- 
mand that we introduce all new topics and conduct all drills 
with rather small and simple numbers instead of with large 
and cumbersome ones. For example, many exercises with 
reasonably small dividends and divisors afford a better train- 
ing in long division than a few long, complicated ones with 
a large percentage of failure to secure the correct result. 
The common fractions most used in business are those with 
the denominators shown in the following list: 
Be eS Fe So) ate ie ae 
The decimals commonly employed in actual computations 
of non-technical kinds most often do not exceed two places, 
more rarely run to three places, and very seldom reach four 
places. But within this relatively simple range speed and 
accuracy are demanded.’ Here then must be our standards: 
Speed and accuracy in the simpler mechanical operations, 
speed, accuracy and clearness of thinking in the solution of 
the simpler practical problems of every-day life.

Miscellaneous Suggestions 
1. Start each new topic with a review of the old material 
on which it is based. This will serve to weld the twe to- 
gether, increasing the value of each. 
2. Give as much individual attention as your time will 
permit, so as to discover and remedy the troubles peculiar 
to each child. 
3. Keep a sharp look-out for the beginning of bad habits, 
such as counting on the fingers, writing down numbers to 
be carried, ¢tc. It is easier to form than to reform. 
4. Use every effort to prevent guessing, or the try-try- 
again method of solving problems. Train the children to 
think as they proceed. 
5. In conducting drill work on number combinations after 
the first year, see that enough concrete problems are brought 
in so that arithmetic shall from the first impress the pupils 
as a tool, and not something merely to be learned. 
6. Cultivate the art of neatness and accuracy in all written 
work. Training in habits of such kinds are almost as im- 
portant as the number material itself. 
7. Do not place too great dependence, especially in the 
lower grades, in definitions and rules. They may be but 
mere words, devoid of meaning to the child. See that the 
meaning and application of a rule or principle is developed 
before it is committed to memory. 
8. Grade all work so carefully that the children proceed 
naturally from one task to another, and thus do not have too 
many new things thrust on them at one time. 
9. Be sure that the problems given for solution are clearly 
understood. Often children do not know how to proceed 
because they do not understand the meaning of the problem. 
10. Hold pupils to a high standard of accuracy. It may 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
ARITHMETIC 237 
be well at times to grade work (1) for correctness of prin- 
ciple, (2) for accuracy of results. Lead the pupils to see 
that practical business demands accuracy. 
; QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Study carefully the standards set in the chapter for knowledge 
and attitudes and judge whether your pupils are being trained to 
measure up to the required standards. Do you find that your at- 
tempt to work out this problem tends to make your teaching more 
definite? 
2. Secure if you can a supply of the Courtis Tests by which to 
measure the skill of your pupils, grade by grade. If you find them 
generally deficient as compared with the averages shown on page 223, 
what is the remedy? 
3. Do you find the problems of your arithmetic text concrete and 
within the grasp of your pupils, or are they formal and too difficult? 
What would be the advantage of substituting problems taken from 
other subjects, such as agriculture, geography and manual training, 
for some of the work of the text? 
4. What devices have you for securing drill on fundamental 
number combinations without allowing the work to become mo- 
notonous from repetition? Is there any use to drill with slack atten- 
tion? Do you employ games and competition? 
5. How many of the topics recommended for omission have you 
been teaching? If you drop them is there any danger of your pupils 
not being able to pass the eighth-grade examination set by some 
higher authority for graduation? Many superintendents give their 
teachers to understand that no examination questions will be based 
on doubtful topics.

   CHAPTER XIV 
GEOGRAPHY 
EOGRAPHY is one of the broadest and richest of 
& school subjects. Its business is to describe the earth 
as related to the interests, needs and activities of man. It 
must, therefore, deal with many kinds of knowledge, both 
about the earth itself and also about man. Geography finds 
its subject-matter in the fields of many other subjects, being 
obliged to call upon the material sciences, the social sciences, 
mathematics, etc., for many of its facts. Yet these facts are 
treated differently when brought over into geography from 
what they are in their own field, for in geography they are 
always used to describe or explain the earth as the home of 
man, 
Nature of geography.—From this point of view we 
can say, then, that the interests, needs and activities of man 
are the starting point of geography. They determine what 
shall be its material and what its method. Put more con- 
cretely it means this: we shall teach in- geography those facts 
and only those facts that have a direct bearing on man’s re- 
lation to the earth—facts that matter in man’s activity in 
making the earth into a home. We shall omit from ele- 
mentary geography many curious but irrelevant facts that 
have no bearing on the central thought, the earth as man’s 
home. 
The older geography did not proceed from this point of 
view. It taught the earth very much as a thing-in-itself, 
without much reference to our relation to or interest in many 
of the things taught. Hour after hour in the geography class

we droned the names of unimportant capes, bays, straits, 
gulfs and peninsulas, which, though we may since have read 
and traveled much, we have yet to meet outside the old geog- 
raphy. We developed great skill in “bounding” all the coun; 
tries of Europe and Asia, but we actually knew very little 
of people or products outside the boundaries of our own 
township.. We could glibly tell the names of the rivers, 
large and small, in many states, but had no notion whence 
the little creek that flowed past our playground came or 
whither it went. 
The Aim—W hat We Seek Through Geography 
The great aim in teaching geography is to lead the child 
to know and appreciate his earth-home and adjust himself 
to it. As in the case of other subjects this will require on his 
part the gathering of certain knowledge, the cultivation of 
certain attitudes, and ‘the training of certain skills. 
Knowledge required through geography.—W hat, then, 
should the child learn through his geography? What does 
he most need to know about the earth as his home in order 
to live broadly, happily and successfully upon it? The fol- 
lowing are the chief groups of knowledge that the study of 
geography should supply: 
1. Orientation, or knowledge of location, deat and 
direction in space. Much practical knowledge of this sort is 
picked up outside the school, but to the school will remain 
the task of making the knowledge broad and accurate. Our 
minds are so constituted that they ask where almost as con- 
stantly as why or what. The child should come through 
geography to know the location, distance and direction of 
chief countries, cities, oceans, rivers, mountains, etc., of 
the earth. | 
2. Climate and seasons. Much of man’s welfare and 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
  
GEOGRAPHY 241 
comfort depend on climatic conditions. Climate determines 
the distribution of vegetation and animal life, and thereby 
affects industries, transportation, the location of cities, and 
many other important interests. 
3. Natural resources. The child should come, through 
the study of geography, to know the heritage of wealth sup- 
plied by nature in the fertility of the soil, the forests, rivers, 
lakes, mines, etc., which man uses to build the material side 
of civilization. 
4. Industries. Work is one of the greatest and most 
universal of human interests. Through work man seizes 
upon natural resources and energies and out of them con- 
structs the necessities, comforts and luxuries of life. Ac- 
quaintance with this world of industry should come to the 
child through geography. 
5. Sources of food, clothing and shelter. These are three 
great fundamental human needs. Geography should en- 
lighten the child concerning their production and use. 
6. Travel and transportation. Modern inventions and 
discoveries and the growing wealth of nations have brought 
all parts of the world into touch with one another. People 
travel from place to place and merchandise is shipped to 
the ends of the earth. Every person of: intelligence must 
understand this current of activity, and the highways of 
trade and travel. 
7. Peoples and places. The fact that modern means of 
transportation and communication bring the whole world 
to our doors makes it imperative that we know something 
of peoples and places distant from us. Important countries, 
states, cities, political units, races and nationalities are to be 
studied through geography. ‘ 
Attitudes to be developed.—Geography touches so 
many sides of the child’s life that it is especially fruitful in 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
‘ \CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND Te ' 
interests. opportunities for cultivating worthy attitudes an 
Some of these are the following: 
1. Interest in the world of nature. Geography brings the 
child to know and appreciate the fruitful earth, the world 
of growing things, the plants and aniinals that supply him 
food, clothing, shelter and other comforts. It leads him 
to the rivers, springs and lakes and bids him use, admire, 
enjoy. It acquaints him with the majesty of mountain and 
ocean. It causes him to wonder over the noisy power of 
wind and wave, and likewise over the quiet energy of the 
rain-drop, the dew and the frost. Through this awe, admira- 
tion and love of nature the child is laying one of the surest 
foundations for a true religion. 
2. Appreciation of the value and dignity of work. Geog- 
raphy should bring the child to contemplate the world’s 
work in its ceaseless round of service to his comfort and 
needs. To realize that a hundred workers have contributed, 
each his part, to the breakfast enjoyed by the child is to 
broaden his sympathy and understanding of life. It is also 
to make him feel his share and responsibility as a worker 
that he may repay the debt. 
3. Broader social interests. Geography, like history, 
serves to cure the child of his provincial and local attitudes 
and interests. It should develop in him an interest in the 
people of other lands and their mode of life. It should ex- 
cite curiosity as to their type of home life, their cities, 
churches, schools, and the whole range of their civic affairs. 
It should lead to broader sympathies and to admiration of 
the good qualities and achievements of other nations. 
4. Desire to travel and read. A desire for broader read 
ing and travel should be one of the best results of geography 
study. Once this desire is well grounded it will prove 
strong factor in promoting growth and education, and wil 
insure the cultivation of strong and worthy interests. 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
  GEOGRAPHY 243 
5. Appreciation and enjoyment of the world. The study 
of geography should add much to the enjoyment of life. It 
should help one to understand the meaning of Stevenson’s, 
“The world is so full of a number of things, 
I’m sure we should all be as happy as kings.” 
There are many persons who are living relatively narrow, 
sordid and barren lives simply from failure to enter into 
the wonderful world of nature, men and action about them. 
A proper study of geography should open the child’s eyes 
and heart to the appreciation of his world. : 
Skills to be trained—The study of geography should 
train certain definite skills, among which are the following: 
1. Skill in quickly picturing in the imagination, or think- 
ing, important places or peoples with their orientation when 
eading, listening and planning. 
2. Skill in reading maps representing any portion of the 
arth or its products. This will include direction, scale, 
nd topography, with the symbols for cities, countries, etc. 
3. Skill in judging climatic conditions and their effects 
m the products or industries of different regions; as of 
rosts in subtropical regions, extended droughts, floods, 
rnadoes, etc. 
4. Skill in planning business enterprises, vacation trips, 
avel, etc. 
5. Skill in locating in the mind or on a map or globe 
e more important countries, cities, land and water forms, 
c., of the earth. The following minimum essentials in 
ill for seventh-grade pupils in locating on an unlettered 
p are recommended by the Iowa Committee on Elimina- 
m of useless subject-matter :*

The Subject-Matter of Geography 
There is such an abundance of \rich material available 
for the course in geography that no time should be wasted 
on trivial, empty or valueless subject-matter. Unimportant 
or out-of-the-way places not likely to be met in one’s read- 
ing, business or travel should claim no time. The memoriz- 
ing of the names of long lists of capes, bays, peninsulas, 
gulfs, straits, etc., of minor importance is a waste of energy, 
interest and opportunity, and therefore not to be required. 
|All that is taught should have a very real and evident re- 
ation to the earth as the home of man. Any material that 
an not measure up to this requirement has no place in the 
ourse. 
First- and second-grade material.—Geography will not, 
f course, form a separate branch for first and second 
rades. Nor will any formal geography be taught. The 
aterial will arise naturally out of the child’s immediate 
ontacts and experiences and will be used as a basis for read- 
ig and language work.
-P-A-G-E-260

246 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
Orientation. Most children have some sense of direc- 
tion, distance and location before they begin school. Some 
do not. All need to have this sense trained. The follow- 
ing should be taught and drilled upon by questions and 
games until all are certain and quick: 
     
     
     
   
    right hand (or direction) west 
left hand (or direction) northeast 
north northwest 
south - southeast 
east southwest 
Drills may be based on direction of school from home, 
from church, store, etc. That the locations may be real to 
the child have him point or move toward various objects, 
buildings and the like as well as tell the direction. 
Natural environment. This is not too early to begin 
teaching the child to see, hear and notice the objects about 
him. Observation lessons may deal with the following: 
Place where sun rises Shape of new moon 
Place where sun sets Full moon 
Time of sunrise and sunset Other shapes of moon 
Direction sun moves The stars 
The sun at noon Direction wind blows 
Color of clouds Snow and its crystals 
Movements of clouds; wind Sleet and ice 
Thunder and lightning Uses of rain 
Products and industries. The child is not yet ready fo: 
formal distant geography, but his attention can be centere’ 
and his interest stimulated by lessons based on objects im 
mediately at hand; as for example: | 
Where does the sugar for your breakfast come from? 
The leather for your shoes? 
The cotton for your apron? 
The orange for your lunch?
-P-A-G-E-261
  GEOGRAPHY 247 
There will at this stage be no attempt to teach the exact 
localities for such products, but only to develop the idea 
of distance, other locality, and distant people at work to 
supply our wants. 
Third-grade material—The home community and its 
locality will supply the greater part of the material for this 
grade. No text-book is required. The aim should be to 
bring the child into immediate contact with nature, indus- 
tries and people and lead him to observe and understand 
his immediate environment. The six classes of knowledge 
requirement listed on page 240 will suggest the outline of 
material. 
Orientation and maps. The child should by this stage 
know the directions, and the location of many principal 
buildings and places in the vicinity. It is now time to begin 
the use of maps. Much depends on getting the first ideas 
of direction on the map right. Many persons who first 
studied the map while it was so hung that they faced the 
south have trouble all their lives to think of the top as 
north, the right as east and so on. 
The first map that the child studies should be made on 
la large sheet of paper placed on the floor. The class should 
tand facing the north with the map before them while the 
eacher draws the school yard and places in it the school- 
ouse and a few familiar objects, keeping the scale accurate. 
he directions having been thoroughly learned on the map, 
it is then immediately to be hung up on the north wall with 
lhe children still facing it. The directions are again at once 
rilled over. The same process should be repeated the next 
lay, extending the map to include the wider neighborhood 
round. 
Geography excursions. Geography can not at this stage, 
any stage, be taught solely in the school room. There 
ust be excursions into the home neighborhood and trips 
       
                             
    
    
      
        
   
       
   
-P-A-G-E-262
  | ' 
248 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
to near-by points of interest to bring the child into contact 
with the objects of study. Only in this way can he be 
taught to observe, and to understand what he observes. The 
excursion or trip will of course furnish a basis for later 
discussion and instruction in the class room. Among the 
objects and activities to be studied in the home-excursions 
are the following: : 
         
   
   
        
   
   
    
      
    
    
     The local industries that supply food or clothing. 
Sources of building materials, as lumber mills or yards, 
brick kilns, etc. f 
Streams, springs, valleys, hills, lakes, islands, woods, etc.! 
Public buildings, such as post-office and court-house, mon- 
uments, parks, etc. 
Markets, depots, railway yards, showing transportation. 
Local bridges, trolley lines, public highways. 
Mines, mills, factories, dairies. 
Observation of the weather and its effects. The weather, 
touching as it does the comfort and play of the child, is a 
source of never-failing interest. The pupils should be taught 
to read the thermometer and the barometer ; to understand 
weather signals; to keep a record month by month of clear, 
cloudy and stormy days; to note the changing length of day 
and night; the change of seasons; the changes in plant life; 
with seasonal changes; the animal’s change in covering for| 
the seasons, etc. 
‘Pictures. The picture is an indispensable aid in teachin: 
geography. The teacher should have an abundant supply o 
pictures gathered from many sources to illustrate ever 
phase of the teaching. The pupils should be taught to mak 
similar collections of cuts, views, post-cards, etc., ‘to é 
rich and illustrate their study. Much excellent material oJ 
this kind can be had at no expense save the trouble of co! 
lecting it. Some of the sources available are: pictures j 
magazines, travel guides issued by railways, booklets se:

; \ 
GEOGRAPHY 249 
out by commercial clubs, post-cards, pictures published by 
mills, factories and commercial concerns, government pub- 
lications. 
Fourth- and fifth-grade material—The fourth and fifth 
grades cover the period usually devoted to the study of a 
first book in geography. In many schools the text is not 
introduced until the fifth year, the fourth year being de- 
voted to an extension of home geography and the gaining 
lof certain broad ideas about the world as a whole. Which- 
lever the plan adopted, care must be taken that the child 
shall be kept close to objects and realities, and not be taught 
mere text-book presentation of geography. Content must 
ot be supplanted by an empty form of words when the 
ook is taken up. 
Extension of home geography. Lines of study already 
egun should be continued. The pupils should draw maps 
f familiar places, and use outline maps to locate places 
nd products until they are entirely at home in reading or 
sing a map. Weather observations and records should be 
ntinued, and weather reports studied day by day for other 
gions of the country. Ideas of direction and distance 
ould be still further developed, and applied to locating 
laces of interest and importance. By this time the child 
ould have a rather complete and accurate knowledge of 
e geography of his immediate locality. This should now be 
tended to include the broader region, such as the county, 
d finally the state. Trips that different members of the 
ss have taken can be made to yield interesting facts and 
scriptions. Trips that are in project can be prepared for 
id rendered much more interesting and fruitful by suggest- 
points for observation and later report to the class. 
he great thing in continuing the home geography is to 
pb the child's knowledge and interests constantly expand- 
, and not dull the enthusiasm by repetition of matter al-

        250 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND M. AGEMENT 
ready covered. Growth can come only out of new and 
broadening experiences. | 
Reaching out to the broader world. While the child’s 
geography should begin with his home it must not stop 
there. Whether it is best to proceed from the home geog- 
raphy gradually outward to the geography of the state and 
then to that of North America, or to go at once from local 
geography to the concept of the earth as a whole is a ques- 
tion not yet definitely settled. Probably it does not greatly 
matter, so that we do well whichever we do. It would seem, 
however, that there are some advantages in teaching the| 
fourth-grade child about the earth as a ball floating in space, 
His imagination is by this time capable of understandin; 
it, and he will then be able -to use the globe to some ad 
vantage in his further study. Such a concept must of cours 
be presented to the child with much concrete illustration b 
means of balls and globes. His imagination and understand, 
ing must master it, or the empty fact is worse than useles 
to him. 
The text-book material. The elementary text-book fu 
nishes a problem for the teacher. Because the materi 
must be brief, some authors have simply abbreviated an} 
skeletonized their matter until they have taken all the li 
out of it. What is often left is a set of dry facts that ha 
little meaning or reality to the child. The task of the teach 
is to make this material live. To do this, it will be necessa: 
to limit the topics discussed to a smaller number than tho 
given in the average text, and then develop the topics chos: 
fully enough so that they will possess interest and signi 
cance. 
During this stage the industrial phase of geography rat 
than the political should be featured. By the time the fi 
grade is finished the child should know where’ the m

of his food supply comes from and how it is produced; 
where his clothing is grown, where it is manufactured and 
under what general conditions; the great trade routes by 
land and water and the chief articles of commerce trans- 
ported. He should also know the great climatic regions and 
their general effect on products and industries. 
Sixth- and seventh-grade material—Most courses of 
study plan to complete geography in the seventh grade, 
some in the sixth. A few continue it through the eighth 
grade; this should not be necessary. A complete. text 
covering universal geography is usually employed, but the 
matter presented should be vastly broader than that con- 
tained in any text-book. The children’s reading in books, 
magazines and newspapers should be freely used to con- 
tribute material. Events of importance, as wars, great com- 
mercial enterprises opening up new territory, irrigation or 
reclamation projects, the building of new railways or public 
highways, great fires, floods or other disasters all supply 
material and motive for the geography class. 
Study of North America. In cases where geography is 
to run through the seventh year the work of the sixth 
year should center on the study of North America. Many 
of the topics taken up will, of course, need to extend into 
other countries, but the emphasis will be placed on the home 
continent. 
From the sixth grade on the work is most successfully 
based on a topical outline. This will permit the use of the 
text and also allow the matter gleaned from outside sources 
to be organized as a part of the course. 
Europe. Approximately the first half of the seventh year 
should be given to a study of Europe. \This continent stands 
next after North America in interest and importance. Its 
peoples, products, climate, industries, commerce, places of 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  ' HE | 
252 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND ae 
interest and governments should be the center of emphasis. 
The relation of these factors of European geography to 
American life should constantly be stressed. 
The remaining divisions. South America, Asia, Africa 
and the major islands remain for study. Of these, South 
America, because of the increasing closeness of our com- 
mercial relations with several of its countries, should receive 
the most attention. A general view of the more important 
features of Asia, Africa, Australia, etc., will suffice. 
What to eliminate.—It is as important to know what 
to omit as what to stress in geography. In the older day 
the children were overburdened with detail which meant 
nothing to them. Many are still thus overburdened. _ It 
would be impossible of course to make a catalogue of all 
that should be omitted from geography. The principle, as 
suggested earlier in the chapter, is to omit whatever has no 
significant, vital and demonstrable relation to man’s effort to

litical importance. Proceed on the same principle in other 
countries. 
The process of elimination should also extend to penin-' 
sulas, gulfs, bays, straits, islands, etc., and to all minutiz 
of secondary importance. 
Organization and Presentation 
No other subject offers the teacher greater opportunities 
than geography, and none more fully tests his ingenuity 
and skill. For geography touches a range of topics almost 
as broad as human experience, and these topics are all to be 
definitely related in their study to the genuine interests 
of the learner. The teacher therefore needs a broad range 
of ready information, a spontaneous and abounding interest 
in the world about him, and a true insight into the minds 
of children. | 
The geography recitation—The geography recitation, 
dealing as it does with the actual and concrete, should never 
become formal or mechanical. There is no place here for 
sheer memoriter answers to cut-and-dried questions from 
text-book. This does not mean that the book itself should 
ot be mastered; it should be. But the realization must 
lways be present in the minds of teacher and class that
-P-A-G-E-268
  254 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
the real material is not in the text-book, but consists of the 
earth and its people. 
The recitation in geography should have the spontaneity 
of an interesting conversation. All should take part. All 
should ask questions. All should answer questions. All 
should help plan the excursion, or formulate the problem. 
All should contribute something of information from ob- 
servations made, lessons studied, trips taken, or books and 
magazines read. Reports should be made, problems dis- 
cussed, stories read by all. Each must contribute his share, 
and the teacher must direct and organize all this material 
as it comes, so that it may not lose its effectiveness from 
lack of cohesiveness and unity. Such a recitation, requiring 
so wide a range of material and so great a variety of treat- 
ment, places a great strain on the teacher’s skill. The ill- 
prepared or ambitionless teacher will shirk the opportunity 
and teach only the routine of the text-book. The teacher 
of ingenuity and power will make the geography recitation 
_asource of joy and means of marvelous growth to his pupils. 
The teacher’s preparation—Under the older type of 
geography, which consisted chiefly of a definite array of 
facts about locations, sizes, divisions, etc., the teacher could 
prepare for his recitation by mastering the text-book. That-| 
contained all the material and nothing was expected outside. 
But the newer geography sets an entirely different problem. 
In it, even the best of text-books are more or less incidental. 
Geography has become a laboratory subject. Things are 
to be met at first hand, and a hundred sources constantly 
drawn upon for information. 
The teacher of geography, if he is to be more than an| 
ineffectual hearer of empty recitations, must therefore kno 
his world and its activities. For example, suppose th 
teacher takes his class on a trip to a flouring mill. He mus‘ 
know the history of the wheat that makes the flour, it

    types, grades, where produced and so on. He must know 
enough of machinery to understand the process of manufac- 
ture. He must know enough of commerce to know the 
wheat and flour markets, and the transportation systems 
by which they are marketed. He must know enough of 
foods and cooking to understand the use of flour. And so 
for each of the objects, problems or industries studied. 
Otherwise the excursions and trips will degenerate into mere 
puttering waste of time, and geography will have failed of 
its aim. Let the teacher of geography therefore earnestly 
set at work to master his world of environment at first hand; 
- it is well worth the effort. 
Teaching children how to study geography.—Many 
texts of geography are written chiefly as statements of so 
many facts. The great difficulty is to keep the pupils from 
learning these facts without imagination or comprehension, 
as empty memory exercises. This calamity can be saved 
only through teaching the children how to study. 
The geography lesson which is based on the text-book 
should first be carefully gone over by teacher and class 
together with books open. Together they should hunt out 
and discuss the important points of the lesson. Assignments 
to library books or other material should be made. Any 
maps that are to be drawn should be decided upon. The 
teacher’s explanations on obscure points should be given 
and any other necessary help rendered. The teacher him- 
self may take the text and indicate to the class how he 
would prepare the lesson. If objection is made that all this 
takes time, the answer is that whatever time there is for 
the recitation should be used to the greatest possible ad- 
vantage. And there can be no more valuable use made of 
time than in teaching children how to study. 
Problem study.—Geography should be used to teach 
hildren to think. Indeed, very early in the course pupils 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
     
  256 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
should be led to see that the greater part of geography is 
not something to be remembered, but something to be ob- 
served, discovered, thought out, ‘under tiand| To this end 
definite problems should be set, help rendered in collecting 
data bearing on them, and training given in their solution. 
For example, the class learns that Minneapolis is a great 
flour producing center, and Detroit the center of the auto- 
mobile industry. Why? New York has so far steadily out- 
grown San Francisco. Will it continue to do so, and if so, 
why? We find that the greater part of the trunk railway 
lines cross the country east and west instead of north and 
south. Why not the reverse? 
Such problems should be developed by teacher and class, 
or better still, formulated by the pupils themselves. A 
problem set by the teacher, with no particular interest in 
the question on the part of the class, may be as formal and 
empty an exercise as could be devised. The following are 
problems that have been successfully studied by classes in 
geography: 
Why does Argentine lead the South American countries? 
Why should the United States control the Panama Canal? 
Tf Florida can raise as good grapefruit as California, 
which will lead in the industry? 
Why do the plains east of the Rockies have little rainfall? 
Why has Pittsburgh developed great steel industries? 
      
    
      
    
             
   
    
   
   
    The ingenious teacher will have no difficulty in discover- 
ing an abundance of such problems suited to the different 
grades. 
The use of maps.—Maps, outline and relief, are of the 
greatest help in teaching almost every phase of geography. 
They enable the eye to assist the mind by taking in through 
vision the location of places, peoples, resources, products, 
etc. They aid in fixing ideas of size, distance, direction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  ; GEOGRAPHY 257 
They tend to objectify and render more concrete many 
facts that would otherwise merely be memorized but not 
understood. They allow the children to have something to 
do in filling in the maps as they learn the matter to be used. 
Outline maps should be supplied the children for certain 
uses. But the pupils should also be taught to make their 
own maps, and to mold relief maps to show topography 
and drainage systems. One map may be used to show lead- 
ing cities, and transportation routes; another to show chief 
products; another to show climatic regions and areas of 
greatest rainfall, etc. 
Through imagination to reality—As soon as the study 
of geography passes from the local community to the larger 
world outside the child must depend on his imagination to 
make verbal descriptions over into real objects. Many chil- 
dren fail at this point, and the people and places they read 
or hear about never become clear realities. Probably every 
child finds his imagination taxed beyond its power in trying 
to understand mountains, or the ocean, or a great city, with- 
out having seen these things. The writer had a large num- 
ber of fourth- and fifth-grade children in Chicago schools 
compare the height of a mountain and a factory smoke- 
stack. After telling that a mountain is “an elevation of 
land one thousand or more feet in height,” nearly half of the 
children said that the chimney was the higher. Some ex- 
plained that “if the mountain went straight up like the chim- 
ney it would be the higher.” 
The childish imagination easily seeks to account for many 
natural phenomena in strange ways. About three hundred 
high-school students were asked to describe their earliest 
notions about the following: 
The earth, size, shape, interior, etc. 
The ocean, depth, waves, saltiness. 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  258 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
The horizon, where it is, and what. 
Rivers, where the water comes from and goes. 
Islands, base, height above water, etc. . 
Whether lakes, rivers, islands, etc., studied on the maps 
were thought of as real. 
About half the three hundred confessed to thinking of 
the earth as extending only to the horizon. Half of them 
thought it was a flat surface. A fourth of the number had 
pictured the earth as resting on some support, as a plat- 
form, a great table, or the shoulders of Atlas as’seen in 
pictures. Some thought of the ocean as having no bottom; 
others thought of it as the depth of the brook that ran 
near their home. A goodly number had heard (and be- 
lieved) a story about a fabulous salt mill that had been 
thrown into the ocean and kept on producing salt. Many 
thought the waves were caused by ships, and that the tides 
were solid walls of water moving across the ocean. More 
than half believed the horizon to mark the “jumping off 
place.” A few had set out in good faith to walk to it. 
Many thought of the water in the rivers as coming from 
the ocean. Nearly half declared that rivers, lakes, etc., 
studied on maps were to them only “so many black streaks,” 
and never thought of as real. A surprisingly large number 
thought of islands as floating on top of the water. 
These testimonies of vagaries of childhood imagination 
suggest the need of constant care and help to insure the 
eradication of wrong ideas and the forming of right ones. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Recall the way you were taught geography. Did the method 
agree with the point of view of the chapter? How near is the point 
of view of your teaching of geography to that of the chapter? Are 
there points in the chapter with which you do not agree? 
2. Have you found children who had difficulty in knowing direc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  GEOGRAPHY 259 
   
                              
       
    tions on the map? If so, was it due to erroneous first impressions 
by having the map hung elsewhere than on a north wall at first? 
Why is it better first to make a simple map with the paper on the 
floor? 
3. What field trips or excursions have you taken with your 
pupils? Did you prepare for the trip by previous discussion? Did 
you discuss the trip after your return? 
4. To what extent do you correlate geography with language? 
Reading? History? Agriculture? Do your pupils know their 
home geography well? 
5. Make a careful study of the “minimum requirements” and the 
recommendations for elimination, and compare with the material 
you are teaching. Do your pupils seem to use their imagination and 
make real the places and peoples studied?

HISTORY 
    
    
   
     
     
    
    
   
   
      
    HE study of history is especially important in a na- 
tion like ours, which depends upon the intelligence of 
its citizens for government and institutions. Because Amer- 
ica is young among nations it lacks the wealth of traditions 
and historic personages possessed by older countries. Yet 
our history, short though it is, is a record of marvelous 
achievement probably never before matched in historical 
records, 
The Aim—What We Seek Through the Study of Histor: 
Every child is at first provincial in his sympathies an 
knowledge. His earliest experiences are bounded by hi 
family relations. Then he comes in contact with a sma’ 
community group. Later, with the school and the broade 
community. But all this is still too narrow a field of soci 
stimuli, 
The child needs to awaken to people and times beyon| 
the here and the now. He needs to have his imaginati 
fired and his ambition stirred by heroic action and wort! 
deeds of men and women far removed in time and place. 
needs to feel the debt he owes to generations long since dea} 
for their gifts to him. He needs to realize what countr 
freedom and security have cost. He needs to awaken 
the fact that he is kin to those outside the range of his i 
mediate knowledge or acquaintance; that he is part of

           great onward moving procession of human beings, each 
linked to all the others by unbreakable bonds.—This is all 
to say that the child needs to study history. The study 
of history should yield certain knowledge, attitudes and 
skills which we shall next discuss. 
Knowledge to be sought.——Of course no person can 
have a complete knowledge of all history, for it includes a 
record of too great magnitude. Neither are all the facts 
of history worth knowing, or necessary to know for our 
present enlightenment and guidance. Especially is it true 
that not all history is suitable for children to know. Much 
of it is beyond their grasp and not adapted to their minds’ 
needs. Our problem is therefore one of selection in order 
that we may find the most fruitful material. Our teaching 
of history should supply knowledge that will lead to the 
following ré&ults : 
1. Kindle the imagination and enlighten the understand- 
ing that they may reveal the significance and value of men, 
events and achievements of other times and places. 
2. Give such a perspective and sense of values as will 
save from narrow provincialism and a self-centered dog- 
matism. 
3. Enable one to interpret present-day social conditions 
land problems in the light of the lessons afforded by past 
social experience. 
4. Render one intelligent in’ reading books, papers or 
agazines, and in sharing conversations or listening to pub- 
ic addresses which contain historical references. 
5. Supply a fund of interesting information to serve as 
basis for thought, memory or appreciation, and to guide 
nd inspire in forming ideals or making plans for personal 
chievement. 
Attitudes to be developed.—The attitudes developed         
       
     
         
         
-P-A-G-E-276
262 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MA AGEMENT 
through the study of history are an Ehigortant part of the 
aim. These should include the following: 
1, Respect, reverence and appreciation for the men and 
women of the past who have made present-day civilization 
possible; a broadened and deepened human interest; an 
appreciation of the opportunities afforded to those who live 
in the present. 
2. A spirit of pride in country and flag, and an ambition 
to play a worthy part as a citizen—a deep-seated, intelli- 
gent, active patriotism. 
3. Personal ideals shaped and dominated by the great 
qualities of life and character revealed in worthy historic 
characters—moral standards. 
4. Hatred of tyranny and oppression, and an intolerance 
of social injustice. 
5. An interest in and love for historical reading, and 
for the study of all that concerns social welfare in the pres- 
ent day. That instruction in history has been a failure 
which has not developed a taste for reading history, current 
events, and other material dealing with human affairs. 
Skills to be trained.—The study of history should lead 
to certain definite skills. Among these are: 
1. Power to judge public men both as to character and 
ability, thus enabling one intelligently to determine his alle- 
giance to leaders or those seeking political office. 
2. Ability to understand and judge public events andj 
policies, and thereby know on what side to throw his in. 
, fluence or give his vote. 
3. Ability to take up, with a background of intelligence 
any office of public trust and meet its problems in the ligh 
of past experience as revealed in history. 
4. Ability to use historical allusions or illustrations ac 
curately and effectively in conversation, writing or pubii 
address.

Subject-Matter of History—What to Teach 
   
    
   
   
     
     
    
      
   
    
        
     
    
    
       The field of historical material is almost infinitely rich, 
and therefore requires careful selection that it may meet 
the aims desired for its study. In general it must be said 
that much of the material offered in the grades of many 
schools has in the past been too formal and technical. It has 
been too generally a record of dry facts, and lists of relatively 
unimportant dates and events. It has been too largely a skele- 
tonized account of the political and military phases of his- 
tory, and too little a description of the social and industrial 
development of the people. It has given a mass of minute 
detail concerning matters often quite outside the child’s 
interest, grasp or experience, and has omitted in large meas- 
ure the more intimate and vital material that deals with the 
common life. When our children have had a right to ex- 
pect living bread capable of stimulating interest and feeding 
the imagination, we have not infrequently offered them the 
dead stones that dulled the edge of appetite and failed to 
nourish the mind. 
What, then, shall we teach? This is not the place to out- 
line a complete course in history, but the suggestions which 
follow will indicate the point of view for selecting the ma- 
terial. 
First- and second-grade material—Formal study of 
history has no place in the earlier grades. History will not 
Ihave a separate place on the program earlier than the fifth 
rade, and in some cases not before the seventh grade. In 
he first two grades whatever history is taught will be pre- 
ented in oral story form in connection with the work in 
eading and language. This material most naturally grows 
ut of the celebration of special days, such as:  
-P-A-G-E-278

| 
Thanksgiving Christmas _ 
    
    
      
    
          
          
   
    
    
   Washington’s Birthday Lincoln’s Birthday 
Memorial Day Flag Day 
Why the day is observed and how it should be observed 
will, of course, come up in connection with preparing for 
its celebration. 
Other suitable material, especially for the second grade, 
is found in stories of pioneers, including those of local fame ; 
stories of the Pilgrims arid other early settlers; well-known 
national heroes; Bible stories ; Indian stories. There should 
at this stage be no attempt to emphasize the wider historical 
significance of the characters, but only to broaden the child’s 
interest and increase his knowledge of people. 
Many schools give a large proportion of the story time 
to Indian stories, presumably because it is supposed that 
the child will best comprehend simple primitive life. There 
is reason to doubt, however, whether the child of to-day is 
able to understand primitive Indian life and customs as 
well as the life and customs of more civilized peoples. The 
further fact that the Indians are an unimportant and de- 
cadent race would suggest that their stories should not be 
given more than their fair share of attention. 
Pictures should from the first form an important phase 
of history material. The eye is more easily impressed than 
the verbal memory. The picture also serves to give realit; 
and significance to the story of a life or an event, and help 
the imagination vivify and realize the facts described. 
Third- and fourth-grade material—The material fo 
these grades is to be determined in part by the child’s in: 
terest and grasp, and in part by the best correlations wit 
literature and language. Most schools emphasize Hebre 
Greek, Roman, Norse and English history material mor 
than American at this stage. The reading material abound! |

    in stories and myths dealing with the national heroes of 
these peoples. The child is ready to respond with keen 
enjoyment and appreciation to these historical tales. They 
also open up to him a new world for his imagination and 
broaden his knowledge of human nature. Yet in dealing 
with other times our own national and local characters must 
not be neglected. 
Text-books should not be required for these grades. Yet 
considerable number of schools successfully use some sim- 
le text of historical stories in the fourth grade as a part. 
f the reading material. The following topics suggest the 
pe of material adapted to third and fourth grades: 
Hebrew stories, as of Joseph, Moses, David. 
Greek stories and myths, as of Ulysses, Alexander, the 
teek gods. 
Roman stories and myths, as of Horatius, Cincinnatus. 
Stories of the Middle Ages, Canute, Alfred, Bruce, Har- 
ound. 
Stories from English history. 
Great Americans, explorers, statesmen, inventors, writers. 
National holidays and their significance. 
Indians and pioneer life. 
State and local biography and history. 
In the use of all this material the main objective is to 
Itivate the historical sense, stimulate the imagination and 
ptivate interest, rather than to present any connected ac- 
unt of nations or events. The time for a consecutive 
ew of history has not yet arrived, and to attempt it would 
feat the whole purpose of history teaching at this stage. 
ictures should be freely used to supplement the stories and 
lographies. 
Fifth- and sixth-grade material—By the time the child 
s reached the fifth grade he should have acquired con- 
erable historical knowledge, chiefly of the biographical
-P-A-G-E-280
     
nH CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MA AGEMENT 266 
type. He should now be ready for a somewhat more defi- 
nitely organized view of history. The prevailing tendency at 
present is to devote the fifth year mostly to American his- 
tory and biography, and the sixth year either to American 
or to. a combination of American and English history. 
There are now available a number of reasonably satis-| 
factory texts to put into the hands of the pupils. In many 
schools these books are made a part of the reading, litera: 
ture and language course. However the work is arranged 
the historical meaning of the material should now b 
stressed, and the child’s feeling for history gradually de 
veloped. Yet care must be used not to present problem: 
beyond the child’s grasp. The following is typical materia 
from American history suited to these grades:

HISTORY 267 
' 
  In presenting English history no attempt should be made 
at this time to teach the consecutive political history of the 
nation, but only such personages and events as are out- 
standing in their importance. Greater stress will naturally 
be placed on such phases of English history as are most 
closely related to American history. Such material is best 
correlated with the points in American history which were 
influenced. Again let it be urged that pictures be freely 
drawn upon to give life and reality to the descriptive ma- 
terial. 
Seventh- and eighth-grade material.—If the child has 
been well brought up to this stage he ought now to be ready 
for a somewhat serious study of the history of his country 
and his native state. This does not mean that the material 
must be dry and technical. The time has not yet arrived 
for a minute study of political and military affairs. The 
subject-matter should deal with the broader problems and 
movements of history, with social and industrial progress, 
and with great and inspiring characters of national renown. 
The subject of history, which up to the seventh grade has 
been correlated with literature and language study, should 
now have a separate place on the program. The two re- 
maining years of the elementary school are none too much 
time for national history, state history and civics. 
Discovery and exploration of America. In the earlier 
grades the child has had only biographical sketches and dis- 
connected stories of this period. He should now pursue a 
connected account of the major situations and events which 
gave the world a new continent. The following are the more 
important topics for this period: 
Geographical knowledge prior to Columbus. 
Story of “Harold the Fair” and “Eric the Red.” 
Trade demands for a western route to India.

tion should be restricted to the following four colonies,

A brief account should be given of the Indian troubles met 
by the colonists. | 
The period of revolution. The material should be selected

have been required, and details of political policies an 
events given which are beyond the hild’s grasp and no 
highly important in themselves. An excess of military his 
tory has been insisted upon, with minute accounts of cam 
paigns and battles. The result has been a large amount o 
dry and uninteresting matter. 
Much of this material should be Siribalted in favor o

vital matter that deals more directly with social, economic 
and industrial history. The following recommendations for 
omission are in accord with action recently taken by the 
Minnesota and Iowa state teachers’ associations: 
Wars. Limit the study of wars to their remote and im- 
mediate causes; their general geography; resources and 
problems of nations involved; general plan of military op- 
erations; a few critical battles; important leaders; what 
the war settled, and the after effects; cost in men and 
treasure. This plan will reduce the war phase of history 
study by more than half. 
Eliminate the detailed study of battles except: Battle 
of Quebec ; Lexington and Concord ; Bunker Hill; Saratoga ; 
Yorktown; Lake Erie; Merrimac and Mansons Gettys- 
burg; Vicksburg; Manila. 
Dates. Limit the memorizing of dates to events of central 
importance like the following: 1492, discovery of Amer- 
ica; 1607, settlement of Jamestown; 1619, slavery intro- 
duced; 1620, Pilgrims land at Plymouth; 1643, confedera- 
tion of colonies; 1775, Lexington, Concord and Bunker 
ill; 1776, Declaration of Independence; 1781, Cornwallis 
urrenders; 1789, first Congress; 1793, Whitney’s cotton 
in; 1803, Louisiana Purchase; 1807, Fulton’s steamboat ; 
812, war with England ; 1820, Missouri Compromise; 1823, 
Monroe Doctrine ; 1826, first railroad; 1844, first telegraph; 
846, sewing-machine invented ; 1845, first reaper; 1846-48, 
iexican War ; 1861, secession and Civil War; 1863, Eman- 
ipation Proclamation, Gettysburg, Vicksburg; 1866, Atlan-

Organization and Presentation 
| 
The great problem in the presentation of history is to 
make it live, to cause the child to recreate through his imag- 
ination the splendid drama of human action which history 
describes. Instead of a set of unreal (or at least unrealized) 
facts of persons or dates, we are to bring the living, mov- 
ing, aspiring, sacrificing, achieving men and women of past 
and present into being and reveal them engaged in the build- 
ing of civilization. If the history we teach does not thrill 
the imagination, stir the blood and kindle ideals and am- 
bitions there is something wrong. For right material skil- 
fully presented will do this very thing with normal boys 
and girls. 
Creating an atmosphere of reality. AL he first requisit 
of good history teaching, therefore, is that it shall creat 
an atmosphere of reality. This can be done in part b: 
direct appeal to. the imagination of our pupils. Picture: 
are also of great service in this connection. Free and spon: 
taneous discussion by the pupils is a clarifying factor: Th 
conversation may turn on the motives back of a certain lin 
of action; as why Washington did this or Lincoln that 
what would have happened if some other action had bee: 
taken ; how Grant felt and how Lee felt at Lee’s surrende 
Fulton in his workshop busy on parts for his steamboa 
a passenger on the first railway train, etc. 
Dramatizing—Wherever possible, especially wi 
younger pupils, history should be put into action. It w: 
have a reality and also a significance in this way whi 
{

HISTORY 273 
\ 
can not be secured from mere reciting. Scores of situations 
and events in history éasily lend themselves to such treat- 
ment. Nor should the merely sensational or striking be 
selected for dramatizing. For example, Washington and a 
group of his soldiers at Valley Forge is a situation of much 
more value than Washington with his hatchet. 
The Boston tea party; the Continental Congress; signing 
of the Declaration of Independence ; Washington’s farewell 
address; Lincoln’s Gettysburg address; signing the Eman- 
cipation Proclamation; an Indian attack—all these are but 
a bare suggestion of the opportunities for dramatization 
open to the ingenious teacher. For special days and occa- 
sions, historical events, anniversaries or periods may be pre- 
sented in the form of a pageant, the whole school (and 
perhaps many of the community) taking part. This is but 
dramatization on a larger scale. 
Training to think—Whatever the method or device 
employed, we must never forget that the study of history 
should train pupils to think. Even very early in the course 
the idea should be planted that things do not just happen 
in history. All events are preceded by their causes, and 
every cause is sooner or later followed by its effect. It is 
not, of course, meant that profound reasoning on these re- 
lations should be expected, but it is a relatively simple mat- 
ter to show how the Civil War was for a century growing 
out of the slavery question and the differences in industrial     
    
   
              
   
                  
       other causes and their effects. The point of view should 
be clearly developed that history is an unbroken succession 
of acts and events, each one caused by acts and events in 
the past, and in turn leading to other acts and events in 
he future. 
This view of history will serve to link the present to the 
ast and cause the child to realize the debt he owes to those and political views north and south. And so with many -

Correlations of history.—History is rich in its cor- 
relations, Literature has seized upon historical events and 
leaders as themes and immortalized them in poetic or prose 
masterpieces. Furthermore, every great piece of literature, 
no matter what its theme, breathes something of the spirit 
of its times, and can not be successfully studied without 
a knowledge of the social or historical situation out of which 
it grew. © 1 
The geography and resources of a country are responsi- 
ble in no small degree for its history. Hence history and 
geography naturally correlate, and should be taught, at least 
after the fourth or fifth grade, in close conjunction with 
each other. 
The use of supplemental material—While children 
should have a good text-book as a basis for their work in 
at least the seventh and eighth grades, there is also need 
of much supplemental material. Special chapters in other 
texts, cyclopedias, historical pamphlets, magazine articles, 
newspapers an historical novels are some of the sources 
available. Special assignments should be made to these 
sources and reports and discussions given before the class. 
A caution should, however, be observed at this point. 
The class never ought to be required to listen to a report 
that does not contain valuable material or to one that i 
poorly organized or presented. The teacher will need t 
work with a on the reports in order to insure a hig! 
standard. Such work may well correlate with languag 
study and recei edie i in the language class. The constan 
use of i ntal material will broaden the child’s con

reading. 
Topical reviews.—After a general view of American 
history is obtained an excellent method for review is to 
take certain important topics and trace their development 
from their beginning up to the present. Suppose, for ex- 
ample, we have chosen for one of our topics, The develop- 
ment of transportation and communication. The following 
points might be taken up under it, thus tracing the evolution 
of the means of transportation and communication :*

   1. After considering carefully the knowledge, attitudes and skills 
suggested as the aim in teaching history, determine whether others 
should be added. Do you attempt the definite attainment of such 
aims? 
2. What methods do you employ to connect the history of the 
present with that of the past? What journals of current events do 
you use in your work? Are your pupils developing the habit of 
reading historical books and articles? 
3. Make a list of the great hac the story of whose life

        CHAPTER XVI 
CIVICS 
HE education of every American child should include 
aii in the fundamentals of civic rights and 
duties. Because of the nature of our government and: the 
character of our national ideals the success and perpetuity 
of our nation depend on an intelligent and loyal citizenship. 
True, the child will receive no small amount of civic train- 
ing from his contacts outside the school, from home, com- 
munity and the wider social relations. But he also needs 
certain direct, organized and specific training that he will 
in all probability lack if the school does not supply it. 
An undoubted source of weakness in our national charac- 
ter is our slight respect as a people for law and authority, 
our lack of consideration for the personal and property 
rights of others, and our all too general indifference to 
many of the finer civic virtues. This weakness our schools 
should help correct. 
The Aim—What to Seek Through Teaching Civics 
   First of all a distinction must be made in the elementary 
school between civics and civil government. Civics, as the 
term is used in this discussion, will refer to the common 
relations, rights and duties of people to civic character and 
its expression as they live together in an organized society. 
ivil government will refer to the mechanism and working 
f the government.

  CIVIcs : 279 
Cultivation of civic attitudes and ideals——The cultiva- 
tion of civic attitudes and ideals is not of less importance 
than the supplying of civic knowledge. Knowledge itself 
is not sufficient for the making of good citizens. There are 
now all too many who have expert knowledge of politics 
and government but who use this knowledge to defeat the 
ends of justice and humanity. Low ideals still lead many 
of our citizens to look upon graft and plunder as the nat- 
ural correlate of office holding. The sale of votes and in- 
fluence is not limited to the ignorant alone. A study of 
civics should teach every American youth that loyal serv- 
ice is the natural and right ideal for all citizens. This 
loyalty should reach not only to service as a soldier in 
defense of the nation, but should also be the common 
attitude and habit of life in times of peace. Public office 
should appeal to men and women as an opportunity to serve 
rather than as a chance to feed at the public crib. Political 
influence and the franchise should be held a sacred trust. 
The school has a difficult task to inculcate such ideals 
while surrounded by contrary examples. And it must be 
admitted that unblushing trickery and political dishonesty 
are far too prevalent, and that this fact is known even to 
the school children f the present day. Though such con- 
ditions render the problem exceedingly hard, yet the ques- 
tion of cultivating right ideals of citizenship must be met 
y the school, else a fatal weakness will exist in our educa- 
ion and in the very foundation of our national life. 
Skills, or practise in citizenship—Many have thought 
at practical application can not be made by children of 
he study of civics. Such persons point out that the right 
f franchise and office-holding are not obtained until the 
ge of twenty-one. This point of view overlooks the fact 
hat voting or holding an office is but one of the many du- 
ies of citizenship. Even the school of which the child is

loyalty and begin the development of the concept of civic 
duty and responsibility. The sense of common civic prob- 
lems and of community welfare may be well grounded at 
this time. Realization of the need of universal obedience 
to law may easily arise out of current examples of law- 
breaking and the harm that follows. 
The relations of the school furnish an excellent opportu- 
Inity for much concrete civic instruction. Universal taxa- 
tion for education, compulsory education laws, free text- 
ooks and supplies, the election of the school board and 
heir authority, the voting of bonds for a new building, 
he obligation of pupils to make good use of opportunities 
rovided at such cost and trouble—all these and many other 
common topics easily supply good starting points for in- 
truction. For example, one boy who had wilfully defaced 
schoolhouse wall was led to see that he had destroyed 
roperty which his father’s and his neighbors’ taxes had 
aid for and in which every person in the district had an 
terest. He at once volunteered to make good the damage 
it of his own savings. What better lesson could be had in 
vic honesty? A j 
Topics growing out of immediate civic relations. 
om the point of view taken, it is evident that the topics 
at, should early be stressed will vary in different com- 
nities and schools. The principle, however, will be the 
e for all: to seize upon the actual vital problems or move- 
nts of civic import such as are suitable for the child’s 
sp and interest, and make them the starting point for 
nite organized instruction in civic ideals and action. All 
better if the matters taken up are such as will permit 
pupils themselves to have a real and active part in them.

le. The work will not require a text-book:

5. Think of still other obligations of citizens. 
Good and bad citizens.—1. Why class each of the fol- 
lowing as a good citizen: Washington, Lincoln, Grant, 
Frances Willard, Horace Mann; Edison; select other good 
citizens, some of them local people, and tell why you choose 
them. | 
2. Why is each of the following a bad citizen: the man 
who does not vote; one who sells his vote; the farmer who 
does not cut his weeds along the reacen?t one who violates 
quarantine ; the boy who throws paper on the street ; the tax 
dodger; the boy or girl who unnecessarily drops out of 
school; the family which permits a fly-breeding privy or 
manure pile? | 
Such topics as those above should, of course, wherever 
possible, be given a concrete and local application and not 
be taught as a mere theory. Examples will not be lacking 
for abundant illustrations and the children themselves 
should in most cases be given an opportunity to present il- 
lustrations or make applications. In many cases the topics 
may naturally arise from some immediate, pressing civic 
“question in the community. This will make the lesson 
doubly valuable and effective. But lessons on civic topics 
such as the above should have a definite place in all elemen- 
tary school instruction. | | 
Text-book work.—By the time the child has reached 
the eighth grade (possibly even by the seventh grade) a 
text-book should be used for half a year of work. The 
general aim will be the same as in the oral work—to give 
the pupil the civic knowledge, attitudes and skill most nearly 
related to the problems he will confront as a citizen. Here 
as in the oral work the instruction should begin with the 
interests and problems nearest at hand; it should then lead 
from these on out to the affairs of the state and nation. 
In the earlier grades the child is ps taught the details

of the organization and workings of civil government. Be- 
fore completing the common school, however, the pupil 
should understand the purpose of government and know 
the general methods of its operation in its various depart- 
ments. 
The emphasis in the later work may center about such 
topics as follow. The pupils should have a text-book, pro- 
viding one of the right type is available: 
1. ‘Why we need a government (not theoretical). 
2. The units of government. 
3. Points illustrating our daily contact with civil govern- 
4. The government of a school district. 
5. The government of a town or city. 
6. The government of a township. 
7. The government of a county. 
8. The government of a state. 
9. The government of the nation. 
10. Current civic problems and movements for study. 
These may include: the primary system of nomination; the 
initiative and referendum; the recall; woman suffrage; the 
hort ballot ; the Australian ballot system ; prohibition ; prob- 
lems growing out of our foreign relations; military training 
nd preparedness ; the commission form of government for 
tate or city; civil service versus the spoils system; doing 
way with special privilege and graft from politics; good 
rainage laws; laws for protection of land under tenancy 
yystem. 
Elimination of obsolete and useless material.—The fol- 
wing material has no place in the course in civics for the 
lementary school : 
1. The constitution of the United States. 
2. The constitution of the state. 
3. Detailed analysis of method of electing prseidens

Organization and Presentation of Material 
The study of civics, as already suggested, should have 
its beginning in the common relations and duties of children 
with reference to school, community and home situations. 
The following account of one teacher’s method of teaching 
civics in a small Iowa town contains a good suggestion: 
Applied civic instruction.—With the help of the teacher 
the pupils were organized into a “Town Civic League,” 
with a president and a secretary. The purpose of the 
League was to keep the streets and alleys clean and beautify 
the town. The League was divided into sections according to 
the part of the town in which the pupils lived. Each sec- 
tion competed with the others in showing the best results. 
The work of cleaning and beautifying was done evenings 
and Saturdays. On Friday afternoon the League held a 
meeting at the school. The president presided. Reports 
were made by the various sections and discussed. Furthe 
plans were laid and projects mapped out. The help of th 
town officers was sought on see hard problems an 
cheerfully rendered. 
As a result of the work the town was made a model o 
neatness, community pride was increased, the pupils devel 
oped a civic spirit, and they learned much in the meeting:    
-P-A-G-E-301
CIVICS 287 
and discussions of their League. They also developed an 
enthusiasm for the study of civics and for the practise of 
good citizenship. 
Teaching civics at Gary.—Probably the most interest- 
ing attempt at connecting school work with the daily life 
which is now going on in this country is at Gary, Indiana, 
under the direction of Superintendent Wirt. Doctor Dewey 
thus describes their method of teaching civics :* 
     
           
   
                             
        
    
       “Gary schools do not teach civics out of a text-book. 
Pupils learn civics by helping to take care of their own 
school building, by making the rules for their own conduct 
in the halls and on the playgrounds, by going into. the pub- 
lic library, and by listening to the stories of what Gary is 
doing as told by the people who are doing it. They learn 
by a mock campaign, with parties, primaries, booths and bal- 
lots for the election of their own student council. Pupils 
who have made the furniture and the cement walks with 
their own hands, and who know how much it cost, are slow 
to destroy walks or furniture, nor are they going to be very 
easily fooled as to the value they get in service and improve- 
ments when they themselves become taxpayers. The health 
campaigns, the application work which takes them to the 
social agencies of the city, the auditorium periods when they 
learn more about their city, all give civic lessons that make 
their own appeal. The children can see the things with 
their own eyes; they are learning citizenship by being good 
citizens.” 
Civics taught through life of school—The school, 
through its organization and social relations, offers excellent 
opportunities for civic lessons. The discipline of the school 
should grow out of the needs and interests of the group in- 
tead of the arbitrary demands of the teacher. There is 
0 better place than the school to teach that one person’s

liberties must end where another’s rights begin. Right con- 
duct must obtain because the common good demands it. 
Property must not be destroyed, because it belongs to all. 
Lying, cheating or poor sportsmanship can not be tolerated, 
because they affect the good name and welfare of the whole 
school, Idleness is immoral because it wastes opportunities 
which society pays for and puts at the disposal of the pupil. 
—These and a hundred other points of contact in the school 
are typical of the wider life outside and supply the concrete 
situations out of which instruction should spring. 
       
       
    
    
    
   
      
   
    
   
    
    QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Get the distinction between civics and civil government in 
mind and then answer the following questions: When and to what 
extent are you teaching civics in your school? Civil government? 
Some elementary texts deal too much with technical facts of govern- 
ment and not enough with civic affairs. How is your text on this 
point? 
2. Is your school generally law-observing with reference to 
school and other regulations? Can good civic instruction be given 
in an atmosphere of lawlessness? Are the municipal and other laws 
well obeyed in your community? Do you find that the spirit of a 
community is likely to carry over into the school? 
3. Have your pupils a feeling of pride in their school? In their 
town or community? Is this necessary to a good civic attitude? Is 
there a tendency to injure or destroy public property about the 
school or community? If so, how can such a spirit be remedied? 
4, Arevyour pupils honest? Is there a tendency to cheat in exam- 
inations? Do you think that school morals are likely to carry over 
into life outside the school? What means do you take to create a 
spirit of squareness and self-control in the school? Are your pupils 
developing character? 
5. In your teaching of civics do you begin with the near-at-hand ? 
Do your pupil§ know the local office holders and their duties? Th 
chief state and national officials? Are they interested in public ques 
tions, local and national? Does your instruction seek constantly t 
broaden this interest? Do you have your pupils engaged in any civi 
activities?

  CHAPTER XVII   
PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE 
JROBABLY no other branch in the elementary school 
Ps often fails to realize its true part in the education 
of the child as physiology and hygiene. This is not because 
the subject is more difficult or has been worse taught than 
other branches, but because the wonderful opportunities it 
affords and its vital importance to the individual have not 
been fully realized in our schools. 
The Aim—Results to Be Accomplished 
What, then, should the study of physiology and hygiene 
accomplish for the child? First of all let it be said that the 
aim is not “discipline” or “culture” or the filling of the 
mind with curious but relatively useless information which 
can have no direct bearing on physical living. It is, rather, 
to establish such habits of living as will result in health and 
physical efficiency for the present and the future, and long 
life. 
More specifically, the study of physiology and hygiene 
should be aimed at the following concrete and definite re- 
sults: 
1. More complete growth and better physical develop- 
ment. 
2. Greater freedom from disease and a higher level of 
health. 
3. Higher physical and mental working efficiency. 
290
-P-A-G-E-305
PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE ; 291 
- 4. Stronger, more perfectly controlled and more sym- 
metrical bodies. 
5. «A good system of habits, physical and mental. 
6. Longer and happier lives. 
The efficient teacher will have these ends clearly before 
him and will constantly shape his teaching to their accom- 
plishment. He will continuously put to himself the ques- 
tion; What is the effective outcome of my teaching this sub- 
ject? He will keep asking: What matter shall I select and 
what methods shall I employ better to make my instruction 
take hold? And in how far are my pupils living differently 
and better because of their study of this subject? 
Type of knowledge required.—This point of view re- 
quires that the knowledge taught shall relate itself directly 
to the physical life that the child is here and now living. 
The facts presented are to be chosen, not because of their 
general scientific truth or value, but because they bear di- 
rectly upon the development, the health, the physical effi- 
ciency, the organic welfare of the learner. This is all to say 
hat the core of the instruction will be hygiene, and not tech- 
tical physiology and anatomy, as is too often the case. Text- 
ooks should be selected and courses of study made with 
his fundamental point of view in mind. 
Attitudes to be developed.—The creation of right at- 
itudes toward physical living is not less important than the 
upplying of fruitful knowledge. The child must be led to 
ant to know how to live efficiently and avoid sickness and 
isease. He is to be made to feel the value and importance 
f the facts he learns, and to be brought to apply them to his 
aily living. He is to come to understand that the truths 
if hygiene are not merely to be “learned,” but to be lived. 
h short, a set of attitudes is to be developed, interests cul- 
vated and standards established which will lead to good 
bits of physical living. There should arise a keen per-

sonal pride in healthy, well proportioned, vigorous bodies; 
in good eyes, ears, teeth, etc.; in freedom from disease, 
colds, headaches, bad throats or other forms of morbidity. 
Such a respect for the workings of hygienic law should grow 
up as to compel obedience to this law even when it is in 
conflict with appetites, desires or established habits. 
Skills to be trained—The knowledge learned and the 
attitudes developed through the study of physiology and 
hygiene should, then, lead to greater skill in the art of liv- 
ing. The final test of effectiveness. of our instruction will 
be the effect of what the child has learned—not the facts 
he can repeat, but how many of these he is practising in his 
daily life. 
To illustrate, the child should through his study not only 
learn the cause of colds, but become able to detect the be- 
ginnings of a cold in himself and know how to cure it. He 
should become skilled in the daily care of his teeth, hair, 
nails, skin, and in attention to the various bodily functions, 
He should be able to avoid or correct bad bodily postures 
lack of lung capacity and other such defects. With attention 
centered on health, growth and high efficiency rather tha’ 
on disease or defects, the child should develop the skill an 
control with reference to his body that will make it a per 
fect machine for the carrying out of life’s highest purpos 
All this is but to say that the knowledge learned and thi 
attitudes developed should eventuate in right habits of phy: 
ical living. And habits come only out of practise. Phys 
ology should of all subjects, therefore, be an applied stud. 
Its lessons should daily carry over until they guide in t 
health, efficiency and welfare of the child. Not to acco 
plish this result is to fail at one of the most fruitful o 
portunities offered in the whole curriculum. 
In carrying out this point of view care will be exercis 
that the hygienic conditions of the school itself do not n

   gate the instruction. The children must have comfortable 
seats, good lighting, abundant ventilation, freedom from 
dust, etc. Sufficient opportunity will be given for change 
and relaxation so that excessive fatigue may not result. 
The teacher will remember that the most effective influence 
is that of his own example. 
Especially will the skilful teacher undertake to make his 
instruction extend to the life of the home. Some of the 
practical objectives of his instruction will be proper dietaries 
for children, the securing of sufficient sleep under good-con- 
ditions, well balanced exercise, regulation of the conditions 
of home study, moderation in amusements, parties, moving- 
picture shows, etc. 
The Subject-Matter of Physiology and Hygiene 
The subject-matter of physiology and hygiene must be 
carefully selected to meet the ends desired. It will be wholly 
futile to set up as our aim the definite, practical and con- 
crete results asked for above and then seek to accomplish 
these results through the highly technical material of anat- 
omy and advanced physiology still found in many elementary 
texts. The final outcome of our teaching will depend on 
the kind of matter we teach. The material must fit the aim. 
Central emphasis on hygiene and practise-—Almost 
from the first day that the child enters school instruction 
should be given in hygiene. This is because the child needs 
then and there to begin the practise of certain hygienic laws, 
oth in the school and in the home. At this stage the sub- 
ject will, of course, not require a separate place on the pro- 
ram; the instruction will be given in connection with the 
eneral work and life of the school, but it will be given. 
The instruction may continue as oral work up to the fifth 
x sixth grade (or even to the seventh grade, where the
-P-A-G-E-308
  294 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
teacher is well prepared and not overcrowded with work). 
The subject should be given a separate place on the pro- 
gram for at least one year during the course, but in most 
cases not until a text-book is placed in the hands of the 
pupils. The lessons should be correlated constantly with 
language work, nature study and home economics. Such 
topics as the following should receive chief emphasis:

    Text-book work.—The time at which a text-book is in- 
troduced in the course will have considerable part in de- 
termining the scope of the oral material. In many schools 
a two-book series will be found desirable. In such case 
the elementary text may well cover a number of the topics 
which otherwise waited to be used for oral work. Even 
where but one reasonably advanced text is used it will in- 
clude, from a different and more complete point of view, 
many of the topics presented orally earlier in the course. 
This is natural and right, but care must constantly be 
taken that mere repetition does not cripple the interest an 
destroy the usefulness of the work. The scope of treat: 
ment and the nature of the material must grow with th 
development and experience of the learner. His study mus‘ 
fit with the problems, interests and activities of his broade 
life and greater mental grasp. Without becoming technical 
the material should grow more scientific. Here as in th 
earlier stages hygiene rather than the technicalities of physi 
ology and anatomy is to govern the aim, though physiolo, 
will receive more attention than in the earlier grades. 
Elimination of unsuitable material—The foregoin 
outline has suggested the points to be selected for emphasi 
in our instruction. Many teachers will, however, find the 
selves handicapped by text-books that do not embody t
-P-A-G-E-313
  PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE 299 
point of view we have presented. Our advice to all such, 
where the text-book can not be changed, is to omit such 
material as is manifestly useless to the child and replace it 
with material that is fruitful. Following are some phases 
of the subject that should be omitted: 
Anatomy of the skeleton. 
Anatomy of the muscular system. 
Technical anatomy of the circulation and technical de- 
scription of the circulation. 
Technical anatomy of the digestive system. 
All unnecessary technical terms that belong to advanced 
anatomy. 
Details of the anatomy of the eye and ear. 
Anatomical representation of organs affected by the use 
of alcohol. 
Detailed anatomy of the brain and nervous system with 
technical terms connected therewith. 
Microscopic anatomy of blood corpuscles, bone tissue, 
muscles, etc. 
Organization and Presentation 
The problem of teaching physiology is simple because 
the material is so genuine, so plentiful, lies so near at hand, 
and because the practical application is so natural and im- 
mediate. The fundamental principle is to organize the 
instruction about the actual life, growth, health and develop- 
ment of the pupils in the home and the school. This will 
make the subject real and cause it to appeal to the interest 
and cooperation of the class. 
Much of the work in the lower grades may well take the 
form of positive directions. Too often instruction in hy- 
giene is mere talking about certain facts or rules, and not 
putting them into practise. The reasons lying back of the 
practise instituted should be given as soon as the mind of 
the child naturally inquires for them, but should not be

forced too early. Method must in the lower grades be cen- 
tered upon hygienic habit. \ 
Motivating the work.—The Massachusetts Course of 
Study (Bulletin 62) suggests the following devices for 
arousing interest; 
Let the children share with the teacher responsibility in 
solving the health problems of the school; e. g., different 
children may be appointed: 
To have charge, for a time, of opening and closing win- 
dows to regulate the temperature of the room according 
to thermometer readings. 
To flush out the room at recess periods. 
To open windows during physical activities. 
To report condition of sanitaries. 
To note that all children remove their rubbers. 
To regulate the amount of light in the room by adjusting 
the window shades. 
The following practical exercises are also utilized.— 
A furnished doll’s house, used effectively to teach hygienic 
ways of sweeping, dusting, airing day clothing and bed- 
clothing, best kinds of bed and pillow, position in sleeping, 
proper ventilation, etc. 
Demonstrations before the class of proper ways of clean- 
ing the teeth, washing the skin, caring for the nails, of sit- 
ting, standing, walking, lying, of getting on and off a car 
and of putting up a lunch. 
Exhibitions of proper materials for cleansing the skin, 
cleaning the teeth, caring for the nails and combing the hair. 
Collections of pictures made by the children supplement- 
ing that of the teacher, emphasizing important points, such 
as proper posture in sitting, standing, walking, etc. 
The finding and discussing of articles in magazines and 
papers. 
Posted lists of foods suitable for growing children; also 
lists of constipating and laxative foods. - 
Tables indicating the amount of sleep required at differ- 
ent ages and food composition. 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
  PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE 301 
Story-telling to impress the idea of the controlling power 
of habit. 
Dramatizations by the younger children as a means of 
emphasizing the importance of right habits. 
Experiments performed to show currents of air, and tests 
made of air currents in the school room. 
Demonstrations—An excellent device is some form of 
demonstration. For example, the day’s lesson deals with 
the health and social factors involved in putting up a school 
or picnic lunch. Two children (or but one) are chosen to 
put up the lunch before the class; to show why they choose 
certain articles of food in preference to others, why they 
wrap each sandwich in waxed paper, use of individual cups, 
how napkins are to be used, how to eat without soiling fin- 
gers or clothes, the value of an attractive appearing lunch 
and similar points. 
Demonstrations may be carried out in like manner on 
sweeping and dusting the room; correct breathing; right 
postures, standing, sitting, walking; caring for the nails, 
brushing the teeth, washing and drying the hair, etc. 
Practical exercises and experiments on physical growth 
and development.—Have children help make a chart or 
table showing the various physical measures for ages six’ 
o sixteen inclusive. Then proceed to conduct physical meas- 
rements of height, weight (in indoor clothing except shoes), 
hest girth, chest expansion, lung capacity, (if a spirometer 
is available) and simpler tests of strength (as arm strength 
ith dynamometer or an ordinary spring scale). The tests 
should be carefully repeated several times a year and an 
ccurate record of each pupil kept—(Good tape lines and 
he use of near-by scales will supply all the apparatus re- 
uired.) 
The use of such experiments and tests will serve first of 
ll to stimulate and vitalize the study of physiology. The

double motive of the genuine activity involved and the in- 
terest in whatever touches the ambition to be large and 
strong and efficient is irresistible. Children will respond 
enthusiastically to the appeal of such work. 
But it must be remembered that the measures and tests 
are not an end in themselves. Their real purpose is to afford 
a true starting point for instruction on the factors involved 
in physical growth and development. The practical experi- 
ments must make the child want to breathe better or as- 
sume better postures in order to increase his lung capacity. 
They must make him desire to eat a better ration or drink 
milk instead of coffee, that he may make a more favorable 
showing in size and strength. And when this attitude of 
mind is produced the pupil is then ripe for instruction. 
Exercises connected with the study of food and eating. 
—Practical points of contact for this phase of instruction 
can be secured by such methods as the following: Teach 
the pupils to keep an accurate record of the different kinds 
of food they eat during several days. Then discuss the 
question of foods, showing the best foods for producing 
growth and health. Also, without introducing any tech- 
nical terms, present several sample dietaries, explaining the 
need of the body for different kinds of food and laying the 
foundation for an understanding of the balanced ration. 
While tact will be required at this point, the deficiencies 
in faulty bills of fare can be clearly brought out and bad 
practises remedied. 
If a microscope of reasonable power is available an ex- 
cellent starting point for the discussion of disease germs| 
in water and milk can be had by exhibiting the many forms| 
of life easily visible in a drop of stagnant water. This wil 
lead to practical lessons concerning the sources of contam: 
ination of water and milk, methods of sterilization, etc.

              An investigation and report by the members of the class 
on the local breeding places for flies and mosquitoes which 
they have been able to discover, the practises with reference 
to screening houses and protecting food supplies in the 
homes or the markets, and the use made of fly-traps will 
serve as the foundation for many valuable lessons in this 
direction. 
Applied work on the study of air and breathing.—This 
topic offers an excellent opportunity for activity and applied 
lessons on the part of the pupils. Some of the subjects 
available for investigation, experiment ‘and report are as 
follows: 
The number of windows in each pupil’s sleeping-room, 
and how far they are kept open at different seasons. Also 
the number who sleep on open porches. 
A record taken for a week in the winter time of the tem- 
perature of the home living-room (1) in the morning at 
school time, (2) at noon, (3) in the evening. 
The methods and tests used to insure sufficient moisture 
in the heated air in the homes during the winter season. 
A study of methods of sweeping and dusting employed 
in the home, the school, in churches or public halls. 
An investigation of cellars and basements for dampness, 
olds and rubbish. 
A study of habits of sitting, standing and walking, and 
ther bodily postures. Simple tests for good and bad pos- 
res. 
With such practical starting points as these the instruc- 
lon can easily lead to the useful knowledge required for 
od hygiene and the formation of right habits of living. 
Care of the body.—Probably more tact and skill will 
required in connection with this topic than with almost 
y other in the study of physiology. Yet it is precisely  
-P-A-G-E-318
  304 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
at such points that the teaching must be concrete and even 
personal if it is to be effective. Some of the practical ques- 
tions on which information may be gathered are: 
The number who have bath tubs in their homes. (Many 
communities have more automobiles than bath tubs.) The 
number of baths taken each week. 
The practise with reference to washing and brushing the 
_hair. 
The ownership and use of tooth-brushes. Cleanliness of 
hands and care of nails. Many teachers have introduced 
the “morning inspection” of hands, nails, hair and teeth of 
all children in their room. Others have formed “tooth-brush 
clubs.” 
Simple eye tests such as can be made for near or far 
sight or for astigmatism by use of a chart that may be had 
from oculists at a cost of from twenty-five to fifty cents. 
These should be a part of the school equipment. 
A count of the number of teeth in each mouth. Numbe 
that are perfect. Number loose. Number decayed. Num 
ber that ache. Teeth that are crowded or defective in po 
sition. 
Prevention of sickness and disease-—The aim here i 
not to arouse the child’s fears or make him morbid ove: 
sickness, but rather to show that health is the normal condi 
tion, and that much of sickness and disease can be avoide 
Some of the topics investigated may be: 
How many of the so-called children’s diseases each on 
has had. How each disease was taken if known. (Sho 
that many of the diseases long thought to be inevitable a 
now being driven out.) 
What sicknesses each has had within a year (cause a 
how avoided.) How many have not had to take medicin| 
stay in bed or have the doctor for a year. 
A study of the condition of tonsils and nose. (T

Prevalence of or freedom from headaches, earaches, in- 
digestion, chapped hands, chilblains, etc. 
In these lines as in the preceding the object of the personal 
factor is to centralize interest and cause the facts learned 
to begin functioning at once in leading to the practise of 
better hygiene in the daily life. 
Dramatization—The following excellent suggestions 
for dramatizing instruction in hygiene is given in Bulletin 
62 of the Massachusetts Board of Education: 
Playing at housekeeping.—A part of the class room is 
screened off to form a room about the size of a room in 
an ordinary house. This is furnished with dining-table, 
chairs, rocking-chair, bookcase, etc., all of children’s size. 
Part of the furniture is loaned by the children and part 
owned by the school. Dishes and dishpan, a broom and 
dustpan, form part of the equipment. In any given lesson 
certain children are chosen to represent the various mem- 
bers of a family; they act out their special parts aided by 
suggestions from the other children and the teacher., The 
mother and daughter play that they prepare, serve, share 
and clear away a meal. The father and son behave accord- 
ingly. At another time the room is fitted up as a living- 
room, and the play takes a form corresponding to that idea. 
This project offers opportunities for a great variety of les- 
sons in cleanliness, good table manners, selection of foods, 
wholesome home life, etc. 
To illustrate an emergency treatment.—Children jump- 
ing a brook. Ruth slips on pebble, falls, spraining ankle. 
Other two take off her shoe and stocking and hold ankle 
in the cold water. Replace stocking and shoe, lacing shoe 
ightly. Make handkerchief seat and carry injured one to 
amp. At camp alternate hot and cold water douches. 
assage and bandage. Ruth sits for a time with foot up. 
ater exercises gently. Ankle massaged and rebandaged. 
Dangers arising from ignorant or careless people in

case of contagious diseases.—Little girl receives a letter 
from a cousin, telling her she has been ill with diphtheria. 
A few days later, children playing in yard. Ada sits apart 
and complains of headache. Ada refuses to eat at supper 
table. Mother puts her to bed. Finding her feverish, calls 
doctor. Doctor questions Ada. Traces illness to letter. 
Pronounces case diphtheria. Sign put on house and nurse 
called. Ada asks for big doll. Mother gives her a smaller 
one, as everything must be burned which Ada touches. Ada 
improves. Playmates call, but are refused admission. Ada 
recovers. Such things as toys and bedding burned. Room 
disinfected. Continued isolation after card has been re- 
moved until doctor pronounces throat perfectly clean. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Do you agree with the six points suggested under aim in this 
chapter? In what grade do you begin oral instruction in hygiene? 
Are you able to get the pupils to practise what you teach them? 
2. Does your first text-book in physiology emphasize chiefly the 
hygiene or the anatomy material? If the latter, what can you do to 
supplement? Are you teaching any of the more technical ‘material 
recommended for omission ? 
3. Have you made any careful study of the health conditions of 
your pupils? Eyes? Teeth? Tonsils? Adenoids? Bad postures? 
What is the medical inspection law, if any, of your state? 
4. Do your pupils enjoy the physiology recitation? Do you have 
them dramatize any of the work? Have you tried tooth-brush clubs, 
fresh-air clubs? Do you have daily inspection of hands and nails, 
hair, teeth, etc., among the younger children? 
5. To what degree do you think your teaching of physiology i 
resulting in better health among your pupils? Is it reducing colds 4 
Tendency to tuberculosis? Eating unsuitable foods, etc.? Is it im 
proving postures and carriage? Is it increasing interest and prid 
in health, growth and vigor?

PENMANSHIP 
      
      
       
     
       
    
   
     ENMANSHIP is esteemed so important a part of edu- 
Ps that much time and attention are devoted to it. 
The Massachusetts Course of Study, for example, provides 
for seventy-five minutes a week for the first two years, and 
one hundred minutes a week for the next four years in 
this subject. This is a greater proportion of time than is 
devoted to any other subject except reading, language and 
arithmetic. 
The Aim—What We Seek Through Penmanship 
The aim of penmanship teaching is to train our pupil: 
to legible, rapid, neat writing. Legibility comes first. N 
matter how fine the curves or fancy the appearance, non 
of these things counts as against clearness and ease of read. 
ing. The writing must proceed with fair speed. The slo 
writer not only wastes time, but also hinders his thought 
for thoughts move faster than the pen and have a tendenc 
'to escape and be forgotten if the pen delays too long. Han 
writing should be neat, for taste, character and efficienc 
are in no small degree judged by one’s writing. 
Knowledge required—The knowledge required in pe 
manship is not extensive. By far the greater part of tl 
emphasis must be given to practise and drill in order 
attain ready skill. Nevertheless, there are certain importa 
things which the child must know:

    1. The correct letter forms. 
2. Correct positions of person and paper in writing. 
3. Right movements in forming letters. 
Letter forms. At the beginning the child should write 
with the letter form directly before him so that he will have 
a model to copy, and also so that he will get the letter image 
well fixed in his mind. One’s writing finally becomes auto- 
matic, the right forms being made without conscious direc- 
tion. But while the child is in the process of learning the 
forms he must be able to think them. This makes it of 
supreme importance that only good» writing shall be placed 
before the child while he is learning to form the letters, ~ 
Many controversies have been waged over the best form 
or style of letters. Extreme slant, vertical and median 
slant letters of varying shapes have all had their advocates 
(and systems of copy-books). At present there seems to 
Ibe a rather general consensus of judgment that a simple let- 
ter of median slant is most legible and most easily and rap- 
idly produced. The following is a fair sample of the letter 
orms that should be taught the child:

Correct position. Much depends on early teaching of cor- 
ct position in writing. This will not only result in better 
nmanship, but will‘save fatigue, eye strain and many evil 
ects that come from bad bodily postures. 
The best position is facing the desk, or with the. right 
de turned slightly toward the desk. The feet should be

on the floor in easy natural position, instead of crossed or 
cramped up under the child. The body should lean forward 
slightly from the hips, and the head be tilted just enough 
forward to give the eyes an easy angle of vision. The writ- 
ing arm should have a full.easy support on the desk from 
the elbow, resting only on the cushion of muscle in front 
of the elbow, and the nails of the last two fingers. The 
free hand should lightly hold the paper. The pen should be 
held easily and naturally, without gripping. As the writing 
on a page proceeds, the paper should be moved up so that 
the arm may not need to move down and so get out of po- 
sition. 
Movement. From the child’s earliest writing he should] 
be taught to get as free and easy a movement as possible, 
The muscular movement is now generally approved by writ 
ers and teachers of penmanship. The driving force is fro: 
the large muscles of the upper arm and shoulder, the muscl 
cushion of the forearm allowing a rolling, gliding movement 
to take place. True, the small child does not have muc! 
of a muscle cushion. Yet the free movement should bi 
taught from the first instead of a cramped finger move 
ment. It is best not to allow habits to form which wi 
later need to be unlearned. The following exercises ar} 
typical of those that should be used to develop the muscul: 
movement :

Skills to be trained.—Skill in penmanship involves not 
mly the question of legibility, speed and general appear- 
nce, but also the degree to which one’s best skill becomes 
as general average of writing. No one continuously writes 
s well as he can. Some habitually write far below their 
bility. For all practical purposes, one’s skill in penman- 
hip-is measured, not by a best sample of his writing, but 
y the kind of writing he turns out from day to day. Al- 
hough it is undoubtedly best to have special periods for 
e teaching of penmanship, at least in the earlier grades, 
e instruction given at this time must be made to carry 
cross to general written work if our teaching is to be ef- 
ctive. 
Many attempts have been made to standardize skill in 
riting by devising certain tests or scales by which to judge 
gibility and speed. The most important of these are the 
horndike Scale of Handwriting,’ and the Ayres Scale of 
andwriting.2? The Ayres scale grades samples of writing 
‘om 20 to 80; the Thorndike scale from 4 to 18. The

Doctor Frank N. Freeman investigated the skill in pen- 
manship in fifty-six cities of the United States and found 
the averages grade for grade slightly higher than the above, 
the difference not being marked.” 
An interesting and important fact shown by the use of 
such scales is that writing ability progresses but little above 
that reached in the eighth grade. Or, at least, if greater 
skill is attained it is not kept. Thorndike found that one| 
thousand Teachers College students wrote slightly unde 
eighth-grade standard. Teachers tested in several norma’ 
institutes averaged no better in legibility than sixth- 0 
seventh-grade writing. 
The facts have led to the important conclusion that whe 
pupils have reached a fair standard of legibility and spee 
(say sixty on the Ayres scale or twelve on the Thorndik

scale) they should be excused from further drill on pen- 
manship. This plan is being followed in many good schools 
at present. Writing classes above the sixth grade are main- 
tained only for those who require further instruction and 
drill to bring them up to the standard set. Teachers should 
secure a copy of one or both of the scales mentioned and 
test the progress of their pupils by them. 
Attitudes to be developed.—Interest in good penman- 
ship and pride in personal skill are among the greatest in- 
centives to good work in writing. These attitudes, once 
grounded, will also save from carelessness and slovenly pen- 
manship outside the writing hour. Pupils should be stimu- 
lated to set reasonably high standards for themselves and 
then have the perseverance to make these ideals over into 
practise. Good taste should always be at a premium. 
       
   
           
   
     
    
           
   
    Conducting the Writing Hour 
Writing, like other lessons, requires keen study, attention 
and alertness. Each pupil should daily strive to better his 
own record in legibility and speed. All manuscripts, whether 
from the writing period or other written work, should show 
taste and neatness. 
The writing time—Since penmanship requires stead- 
iness of nerve and muscular control, the writing period 
should not come immediately following an intermission] 
given to play. Nor should the lesson be long enough so tha 
fatigue results. Fifteen minutes of drill is long enough fo: 
one time. Two ten-minute periods a day are better. 
Models and incentives.—As already stated, the chil 
should have placed before him only good models. The let 
ter forms should be simple, and not the over-perfect en 
graved type that characterized the earlier. copy-book: 
Whether a copy-book is used is not highly essential, thoug

     PENMANSHIP ty OS) 
it is best to have pen copies of normal size before the pupils 
rather than to depend on charts or blackboard copies. No 
shading should be allowed. The teacher should use the 
blackboard freely. 
A copy of one of the Ayres or Thorndike scales should be 
prominently displayed on the wall of the room, and pupils 
instructed as to the mark they should reach in their respec- 
tive grades. It will be possible in most schools to get up a 
healthy spirit of rivalry to “beat the chart.” This ambi- 
tion should, of course, extend to all written work, and not 
just to the performance of the writing hour. A sample of 
every child’s writing should be taken at the beginning, mid- 
dle and end of every year and compared with that of other 
pupils and with the scale. 
Conducting the drill—One of the worst faults of many 
writers is an irregular, jerky movement. This is sure to re- 
sult in ill-formed, scrawly letters and slow speed. The mus- 
cular movement will tend to remedy this fault, but it should 
also be prevented or cured by definite attempts at securing 
rhythm of movement. This can be done by counting for cer- 
tain exercises, the entire class falling into time with the 
strokes. Other devices are the use of a metronome, or 
time-marker, or the playing of music suitable to the move- 
ment desired. The children should also be taught to think 
a rhythm for themselves when practising on movements. 
The aim is, of course, to develop an inner sense of time and 
to coordinate the writing movements with it. All the exter- 
nal helps suggested must lead to this end. In counting or 
marking time the count should come on the down or right 
strokes. 
Individual teaching—While the exercises and drills 
may be given to the whole class together, much individual 
instruction should be given. One child may have trouble to 
et the swing of the movement, another may lack a sense of
-P-A-G-E-330
  
  _ 316 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
/ 
rhythm, while a third may have wrong forms for his letters. 
Each will need to have direct and close supervision to cure 
him of his faults. 
Whatever the system of copy-books or other models placed 
before the pupils, eternal vigilance is required to insure 
' progress instead of deterioration under drill. Most teachers 
have been troubled by finding the first line of the child’s 
writing after the copy fairly good, the next not so good, the 
third worse, and so on with increasing badness to the bottom 
of the page. This must be avoided, for drilling in the wrong 
direction will never lead to efficiency. One method, where 
the copy-book with a set copy is used is to have the child 
begin on the Jast line and work up toward the copy. He will 
then not copy his own imperfect letter forms. 
Materials—Soft pencils and rather wide-ruled paper 
make the best equipment for the first grade. Pens may be 
given to the second grade, but the pens should be stiff and 
the points should not be sharp. The penholder should have 
a grip of cork or rubber, and mot the smooth metal clip so 
often used. It is impossible to hold a pen of this sort with- 
out gripping it tight, which cramps the hand and hinders 
full and easy movement. The paper should be smooth, and 
hard glazed, and the ink an easy-running fluid. A supply of 
good blotters should always be on hand.   
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Have you ever tested your pupils by one of the scales for 
handwriting discussed in this chapter? If not, are you not willing to 
do so? To test for speed, have the pupils write ordinary copy for 
two minutes. Count the letters. One-half of the number will repre- 
sent their speed. 
2. Do your pupils use a muscular or finger movement? Have 
you definite drills which you tise to develop skill in movement?

    CHAPTER XIX 
AGRICULTURE 
GRICULTURE has its beginning in the study of na- 
A ture. Nature study is the study of the great out-of- 
doors. It should begin with the child’s entrance into school, 
and continue in some form as long as he attends. Agricul- 
ture, which is a specialized form of nature study, should have 
a separate place on the program during the seventh and 
eighth grades. There will be no necessity or attempt in this 
discussion to distinguish sharply between nature study and 
agriculture for the earlier grades. 
The Aim—Results Sought 
Nature is an insistent and ever-present reality to every 
person. Its sights and sounds and contacts are always 
thronging upon our senses. Its objects constantly appeal 
to our observation. Its beauty daily enriches our lives. Its 
problems are a perpetual challenge to our investigation and 
mastery. Its gifts supply our needs, and give us the com- 
forts and luxuries we enjoy. Surely an important part of 
our education is to enter as fully as possible into an under- 
standing and appreciation of our natural environment. 
Agriculture is the most fundamental and important of all 
industries. It employs millions of workers, and supplies 
the prime necessities, food and clothing. Whatever be our 
occupation or status in life we all go back to the soil for what 
we eat and wear. Upon the success of agriculture the wel- 
fare of all other industries and vocations depends. Whether

one is to follow farming as a career or live in a city, some 
knowledge of agriculture is necessary to breadth and intelli- 
gence. The study of agriculture should therefore not be 
limited to those who are to follow farming as a vocation. 
Knowledge to be sought.—Agriculture and the study 
of nature should yield certain well-defined knowledge, the 
more important phases of which may be classified as follows: 
1, Acquaintance with the common forms of life daily met 
in our environment, that we may understand their relation 
to our welfare. 
2. Knowledge of the plants and animals upon which we 
are dependent, including ‘their economic production, and 
the conservation of the fertility of the soil which supports 
them. 
3.. Knowledge of agriculture as an occupation, its oppor- 
tunities, demands and rewards. This, for children, will of 
course deal with but the broader phases of the question. 
4. Knowledge of how to make the country home as com- 
fortable, convenient and attractive as the city home while at - 
the same time the owners are winning economic independ- 
ence. 
Attitudes to be developed.—The study of nature and 
of agriculture is as important for the attitudes and inter- 
ests it develops as for the knowledge it trains. Some of 
the chief attitudes to be sought are the following: 
1. A broad appreciation of nature and spontaneous en- 
joyment from contact with living, growing things, or from 
fields, sky or stream. Love of nature enriches the life, 
broadens the sympathies, and results in longer, happier and 
better lives. 
2. An interest and pride in high-grade achievement on the 
part of those who make farming their vocation. Agriculture 
offers opportunities for a worthy career not fully appreciated 
by many who till the soil. He who makes eighty bushels of

corn grow where but forty grew before is not only a bene- 
factor of his race, but he has attained a personal success of 
which he may well feel proud. 
3. High esthetic and hygienic standards for country life 
and homes. The farm-house can be made beautiful, health- 
ful and satisfying and the homestead show a spirit of artistry 
in work without in the least interfering with the economic 
returns. 
4. Standards and appreciations that will increase the at- 
tractiveness of towns and cities through adding touches of 
nature to home buildings and grounds, and securing better 
care of streets, alleys, parks, etc. 
5. Honest appreciation and admiration for worthy labor, 
such as goes to produce our food, shelter and clothing. 
Skills to be trained.—The study of nature and of agri- 
culture should carry across to certain definite skills. Among 
these should be such as: 
1. Ability to identify the following: common domestic 
animals of the region; wild animals most commonly seen; 
common birds and insects; characteristic trees and shrubs; 
the native farm crops and garden plants, common flowers. 
2. Skill in caring for, or producing, such of the above as 
commonly come within the interests and care of the average 
person. For the farmer this will mean ability to make agri- 
culture pay. 
3. Skill in planning and carrying out a project for a home 
garden, farm crop or other enterprise for beautifying the 
home or adding to its welfare. 
4. Skill in using nature and outdoor life or work as a 
means to happiness, culture and health. This means power 
to grow under the influence of nature. 
That even children are capable of developing worthy skill 
in certain of these lines is abundantly proved by the fine 
display of garden, orchard and farm produce shown in
-P-A-G-E-335
    AGRICULTURE 321 
many of the school and club exhibits, and also by the prize 
poultry, pigs, calves, etc., which children have produced 
under the stimulus of agriculture study. Indeed, the largest 
yields of corn and of certain of the garden crops produced 
in the country have come from club boys and girls who have 
translated their instruction and interest into applied skill. 
The Material to be Taught 
The material for the study of nature and of agriculture is 
not to be found in text-books. The great objective is the 
out-of-doors. With this our class must have first-hand con- 
tact, or better a thousand times omit the subject. True, 
books will be used ; we shall need the best of text-books. But 
these contain none of our real material, they only show us 
how to look for and understand the objects we find in na- 
ture about us. We are to study things, not words. y 
It is so much easier to understand what a book says about 
a thing than to observe, study and understand the thing itself 
that teachers, even though they know the method is bad, 
have a tendency to substitute the book for the plants or ani- 
mals which the book describes. Especially is this true if the 
teacher has never made a study of agriculture or of nature. 
But even with the handicap of inadequate preparation it still 
is better to study the real objects with the children than to 
teach empty words about them. For by this method the 
child’s habit of observation at least will be developed and 
interest cultivated in the environment. 
Organized agriculture, taught as a separate subject and 
having a distinct place on the program, should be reserved © 
for the seventh and eighth grades. Many schools limit it to 
the eighth grade. But a broad and valuable fund of infor- 
mation and a rich field of interests concerning nature should 
be growing up during the earlier grades. As already shown,
-P-A-G-E-336
322 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
this can be successfully accomplished in connection with 
language, reading and geography study, while at the same 
time enriching the contents of these studies. : 
Material for the earlier grades—The purpose in the 
lower grades is not to present a connected and scientific view 
of agriculture or any other phase of nature study. It is 
rather to study each year a few of the most interesting 
phases of nature that lie close at hand. . No outline or course 
of study can prescribe the detail of what should be taught in 
different schools; this must be determined by the interests 
of the pupils, the season, the time available, and the char- 
acter of the environment. 
An illustration of the point of view is found in the sub- 
ject-matter in nature study and elementary agriculture rec- 
ommended to teachers by the New York State College of 
Agriculture, which for the year 1916-17 includes the fol- 
lowing topics :* 
Birds.—For special study, the downy woodpecker and 
the hen ; to be recognized, any two other winter birds and any 
five of the following: robin, bobolink, redstart, red-eyed 
vireo, blackbird, yellow warbler, humming bird, marsh wren, 
turkey, owl. 
Animals.—For special study, the toad and the cow; to 
be recognized, any four of the following: frog, hog, bat, rat, 
rabbit. 
Insects.—For special study, the ant or the honey bee, 
and one biting and one sucking insect ; to be recognized, any 
four of the following: cricket, dragon-fly, cutworm, hornet, 
cecropia. ’ 
Plants.—For special study, the bean; to be recognized, 
one of the clovers, one of the grains, one of the grasses, and 
any six of the following: elder, tulip, dandelion, buttercup, 
lily, chickweed, verbena, beet, tomato, squirrel corn; to be 
studied, any four of the following weeds: quack-grass, 
orange hawkweed, dandelion, chickweed, yellow daisy.

-P-A-G-E-337
  AGRICULTURE 323 
Trees.—For special study, the apple and one conifer; 
to be recognized, two kinds of fruit trees, one conifer, any 
four of the following: hemlock, pine, peach, pear, hickory, 
cucumber tree, maple, locust, ash, basswood. 
The outline of material just given was intended for New 
York State, and was planned for the earlier grades. Other 
regions, while using the same general topics, would, of 
course, vary the details to suit the local conditions. An im- 
portant caution is to avoid undertaking too many topics, 
Make a reasonably thorough study of a few topics of most 
interest to the pupils and the community, and a somewhat 
general study of a wider range to broaden the interest and 
pave the way for more complete investigation later. 
Seventh- and eighth-grade material—Seventh- and 
eighth-grade material should be more definitely organized 
than that of the lower grades to give a somewhat systematic 
view of the fundamentals in agriculture. The matter should 
not be technical, over-scientific, nor too difficult. Neither 
should it be trivial nor childish. It should deal with what 
is nearest at hand and most important in the locality. 
It is best in most cases for the pupils to have a text-book, 
though it is to be remembered that the agriculture is out in 
the fields. The text will supply certain necessary informa- 
tion, suggest problems and give directions for study of the 
field material. In no case, however, is the order or material 
of a text-book to dominate the course of instruction. Crops 
must be studied as they are in season, The animals most 
important in the region are to have precedence. It is prob- 
ably best, therefore, to base the study on a definite outline 
made to fit the immediate needs and conditions of the vicin- 
ity. The text-book and reference material will then be 
studied as required by the outline and field or laboratory 
work,

mitted. As already stated, the local needs and conditions 
ust determine the details of the content. Every state col- 
lege of agriculture publishes outlines of material adapted 
lo the region, and every teacher should avail himself of this 
xpert assistance.

326 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
What to omit.—Not a few of the elementary texts have 
presented matter too difficult for children and unsuited to 
the purposes of this study in the grades. They have pro- 
ceeded from the logical instead of the psychological point 
of view. The following should be omitted from elementary 
agriculture ; | 
| 
All chemistry given under the name of agriculture. 
Technical botanical and physiological terms. 
Technical analysis of various food elements. 
Biological laws, as of Mendel. 
Detailed study of crops not locally grown. 
Biological explanation of ctoss-breeding. 
Whatever else may be beyond the grasp or outside the in- 
terest of the pupils. | 
         
    
    
      
    
     
    Organization and Presentation 
The foregoing outline of material is not meant as a teach. 
ing outline. Very few if any topics should be carried en. 
tirely through and dropped with a continuous series of les 
sons. For example, when school starts in September, cori 
is the natural topic with which to begin in the corn belt. Bu 
the testing of seed should wait for late winter and the stud 
of planting and seed bed for spring. Only part of the cor: 
lessons will come in the fall, therefore, other topics supple 
menting and filling the time, 
An interesting time schedule for teaching agriculture i: 
middle western schools is recommended by the Iowa Col 
lege of Agriculture.* This table provides for one year 
work five days a week. It is evident that the same propo 
tions could be maintained in a course of two years one, t 
or three days a week:

Such an arrangement, while not adapted in detail for all 
egions, contains a valuable suggestion. The division of time 
ls such that each topic is taken up at the season best adapted 
lo some phase of its study. Nor is any one subject continued 
ng enough to tire the interest of pupils in studying it. 
Home project work.—From the very first lesson the 
upils should be made to realize that agriculture is the study 
f the farm and its activities. They are never to think that 
ey can “get the lesson” by memorizing certain pages of a 
ok. They are to realize that the text and all reference ma-

328 CLASS-ROOM METHOD aa MANAGEMENT 
terial are to help them answer questions ah master prob- 
lems growing out of their study of an ear of corn, the gar- 
den crop, the preparation of a seed bed. 
The most successful carrying out of this point of view is 
in what is called home project work. This only means that 
the child shall actually be doing what he is learning—not as 
a made-up exercise at school, but genuinely at home, in 
the garden or the field, or in cits for the poultry or animals 1 
    
         
    
      
        of the farm. In this way the interests become very real and 
the motives very compelling. hat is learned is put at once 
into service, and therefore passes from theory over into 
practise. 
Parents are usually more than willing to cooperate in 
home project work, for they can see practical good coming 
from the school study. In this way the home and the school 
are more closely united. Better methods of agriculture are 
often carried over from the pupils’ home project to the 
broader work of the farm and thus made a part of the farm 
practise. 
The best teaching of agriculture is everywhere attempting 
to have the instruction reach definitely to the farm through 
some form of home project work. The following represents 
home projects suitable for upper-grade children: 
Taking charge of a section of the vegetable garden. 
Assuming full responsibility for the care of poultry. 
Feeding and caring for a calf or a pig. 
Raising an acre of corn or other grain. 
Setting out and caring for certain shrubbery. 
Cultivating, picking and marketing berries. 
Spraying, picking and marketing certain fruit. 
Planting and caring for a bed of flowers. 
‘ The state college of agriculture, the agricultural club lead. 
ers and the county agents are always ready to cooperate wit 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
nS Oey hee: re ee 
AGRICULTURE 329 
the school in home project work. The wise teacher will 
work closely with all these agencies. 
The school study should of course correlate directly with 
the home project. The teacher should have some oversight 
of the home work if possible, to give advice and direction. 
The child should receive school credit for home project work 
carefully carried out in accordance with the lessons of the 
course. 
Treatment of a lesson topic.—Before going to the field, 
the woods or the farm for special study of a topic, there 
should be careful preparation. Otherwise the trip will lose 
at least a part of its value, and may degenerate into a mere 
excursion. Either through a study of the text-book or a dis- 
cussion by the teacher the principal points to be observed and 
noted should be clearly understood. Maps or preliminary 
diagrams or tables for notation should be prepared in the 
note-books if required. Each pupil should then be held 
responsible for gathering the information which the class 
went to seek and as much more as his own interest and ob- 
servation may make possible. 
A recitation lesson should then be devoted to the subject,     
   
                               
   
    
   
    
   
    ing. Notes should be compared, errors corrected, and mean- 
ings explained. Following this discussion there should 
sually be further study of the text and other references. 
Agricultural “demonstrations.”—The “demonstration” 
as for its purpose the teaching of some definite truth by 
eans of concrete example. The aim of an experiment is 
0 discover truth ; the aim of a demonstration is to put truth 
Into practise. The demonstration may be performed by one 
Individual or by a class before the school or in the presence 
f neighborhood club meetings, at fairs, or any other as- 
emblies. The exercise consists in showing how to do cer- 
( |

| with a free discussion on the points observed and their mean-

tain important things connected with the farm or the home. 
Suitable demonstration exercises are suggested by the fol- 
lowing :* 
How to test seed corn in varios types of testers. 
How to string and hang seed corn. 
How to furrow for surface irrigation. 
How to select and cut seed potatoes. 
How to detect weed seed in clover, etc. 
How to set and prune tomato plants. 
How to make a fruit-tree graft. 
How to set a hen. 
How to weigh and test milk. 
How to break, mount or drive a horse. 
How to spray trees or vegetables. 
How to take up and replant a tree. 
How to make bird-houses, fly-traps, etc. 
a serious business, there is no reason why the spirit of play 
should not enter into certain phases of the work. The mo- 
tive of competition and the game can be used to great advan- Play contests.—While the study of agriculture must be 
tage in such exercises as the following: 
Seed corn stringing or judging contests, 
Soil variety naming contest. 
Potato judging, naming or paring contest. 
Contest in packing and crating fruit for shipment. 
Story writing contest on suitable agricultural topics. 
Garden making and planting contests. 
Plowing contest. 
Rope-tying contest. 
Bird naming or describing contest. 
It is, of course, obvious that any of the demonstration ex- 
ercises can be made competitive and the contest spirit intro- 
duced.

Making collections—The strong collecting instinct of 
children can be used to good advantage in the study of agri- 
culture. Every child will, under proper guidance, enter 
heartily into the project of making a collection of material 
for himself or, jointly with others, for the school. Not 
only is such work a stimulus to interest and observation, 
but it results in assembling valuable material for use in in- 
struction. Such collections as the following are adapted 
to elementary pupils: 
Samples of soil in uniform labeled bottles. 
Specimens of seeds of all local cereals. 
Seeds of troublesome weeds common to the vicinity. 
Specimens of grasses and legumes. 
Varieties of corn. | 
Specimens of injurious worms and insects. 
Specimens of native woods. 
In addition to such collections, much valuable material 
can be secured free from various commercial concerns 
showing the process of manufacture of different foods, fab- 
tics, implements, etc. 
The use of note-books.—The note-book is a valuable 
help in teaching agriculture. The pupils should be pro- 
vided with note-books of uniform size. In these should be 
kept a record of all demonstrations, experiments, field trips, 
excursions and observations. Here should also be worked 
out all the exercises and problems required in the text, and 
those assigned by the teacher. Drawings, diagrams, tables 
or any other matter brought into the course should find 
their way into the note-book. Pictures of farm animals, 
crops, machines, farm buildings and the like, should be as- 
sembled and form a part of the record of the course. Every 
note-book should be neat and well kept, and arranged in a 
businesslike manner.

CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 332 \ 
Junior extension work.—This is the name under which 
boys’ and girls’ agricultural club work is coming to be known. 
Originally organized on a wide scale by the United States 
Department of Agriculture in cooperation with the state agri- 
cultural colleges, the work has ae grown until many thou- 
sands of boys and girls in all parts of the United States are 
studying (and practising) scientific agriculture under the 
direction of specialists. 
It is the desire of all leaders of the junior extension work 
to connect it as closely as pss with the public schools. 
This should be done. It will help the club work and vitalize 
and stimulate the study of agriculture in the schools. Teach- 
ers should everywhere seek the help of these specialists and 
look toward cooperating with their work. Information con- 
cerning how to proceed can always be had by writing the 
state college of agriculture or consulting the county agri- 
cultural agent. 
Club work may be defined

enterprise in accordance with 
regulations. For example,

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Note carefully the aims proposed in the way of knowledge, 
‘ attitudes and skills and decide whether these meet with your ap- 
proval. If so, do you keep them before you as you teach in order 
to make your instruction more definite? 
2. Are your boys and girls good observers? What methods do 
you employ in teaching agriculture to improve this power? Do you 
definitely prepafe yourself and class before a field trip so that spe- 
cific problems or questions are in mind for observation and study? 
3. Are you careful not to let agriculture become a text-book sub- 
ject? On the other hand, you will need to be equally careful that 
text-books are studied in connection with all the topics so that a 
scattering, superficial knowledge may not result from incomplete 
understanding. 
4. What home projects have your pupils under way? Do you 
manage to supervise these to some degree? Do you find that such 
work makes pupils anxious to study on their project at school? 
Have you won the support of the homes to this line of work? 
5. Who is your state agricultural club leader? Your county 
agent? Could the club idea be promoted to advantage in your 
school? What government and state agricultural bulletins has your 
school library on hand? Are these well classified and taken care of? 
Are they fruitfully used?

  CHAPTER XX 
HOME ECONOMICS 
LL education, as all industry and endeavor, should 
finally lead to the art of good living. This demand 
naturally reaches to the home. To maintain good homes is 
one of the highest ideals either for individuals or nations. 
School training should not neglect this most important phase 
of education. 
Since so large a proportion of our children fail to reach 
the high school, it seems desirable that certain fundamental 
training in home economics shall be given in the grades. It 
has been estimated that twenty-five per cent. of food cost 
is to-day wasted because of inefficiency in the matter of buy- 
ing, preparing and serving foods. A similar waste obtains 
with reference to providing and caring for clothing. Un- 
questionably much sickness could be prevented if better 
sanitation were practised in the homes. 
The Aim—What is to be Accomplished 
High technical skill or expert knowledge is not to be ex- 
pected from the training in home economics that can be 
given in the grades. It is possible, however, to equip the 
pupils with certain concrete and important knowledge, to 
develop in them certain desirable attitudes, and to train 
them in certain practical skills which will go far toward 
making better homes. 
Knowledge required.—1. ~All children should be taught 
the untechnical but fundamental knowledge concerning the 
335

i ae i j ae : 336 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT HT 
values and sources of food materials. Added to this should 
be a knowledge of how to purchase, and (for girls) cook 
and serve the common foods. 
2. Both boys and girls should be given instruction con- 
cerning clothing, its various fabrics and their manufacture 
into articles for wear. This should also extend to the care 
_ of clothing. 
3. All should likewise be given a knowledge of shelter, 
or the materials of which houses are built and furnished, 
together with how to make the home sanitary, convenient — 
and attractive. 
4. Also a knowledge of the value of money, and the busi- 
ness of the household, how to buy and sell in connection with 
home supplies, and how to keep simple records or accounts 
of receipts and expenditures. 
5. A knowledge of how to plan, decorate, furnish and 
keep a house in such a way as to secure the best harmonious 
and artistic effects from the resources available. 
Attitudes to be developed.—It is perhaps even more 
important, if possible, that right attitudes and standards 
shall be developed than that knowledge shall be gained with 
reference to the home. Such attitudes as the following 
should be cultivated: 
1. A sense of personal responsibility and willingness on 
the part of girls to undertake the ordinary duties of the 
home and carry them out with high standards of perform- 
ance. A similar attitude of willingness on the part of boys 
to do their rightful part in carrying on the activities of the 
home and making it a pleasant and attractive place. 
2. A fundamental respect for work, and for the occupa- 
tions that have to do with supplying the economic neces- 
sities of life, or maintaining the comfort and welfare of the 
home. 
3. Interests that will lead to further reading and study

with reference to all problems involved in the making of a 
good home. 
4. Pride in good housekeeping as expressed in neatness, 
order, cleanliness, and such other qualities as go into good 
housekeeping. A desire to make the home beautiful from 
the esthetic point of view. 
5. A tendency to saving and thrift such as will conserve 
the resources available for supporting the home. 
Skills to be trained—The study of home: economics 
should also result in the training of definite skills which* 
should find their first application in the homes of the pupils. 
1. Skill in sweeping, cleaning and caring for the house, 
so that its appearance may be made attractive and its condi- 
tion sanitary. 
2. Skill in the preparation of simple dishes without reci- 
pes and in the serving of food so that it will be hygienic and 
attractive. Also skill in preparing a new dish from a recipe. 
3. Ability to do simple hand sewing neatly, to use the 
sewing-machine, and to cut, alter and fit simple garments 
from pattern. Also such skill in laundering as will make 
clothing clean and sanitary, and result in a saving of the 
fabrics. 
4. Skill in planning expenditures and making a budget for 
the home so that each department, as food, clothing, recrea- 
tion and the like, shall have its fair share of the amount 
available. 
5. Skill in keeping the person well-dressed, cleanly and 
attractive in appearance.      
    
   
    
    
     
       
    
      The Material for Instruction 
Home economics, like agriculture, should be correlated 
ith other subjects throughout the earlier grades. It will 
ot claim a separate place on the program except in the sev-

enth and eighth grades, and may then be limited to two les- 
sons a week. The work will center about three great topics, 
food, clothing and shelter. 
Subject-matter for the earlier grades—The work 
should correlate directly with hygiene, language, geography 
and arithmetic, The material to be taught will consist of the 
simpler aspects of food, clothing and shelter. Such topics 
as the following may be taken up:

best foods for boys and girls; foods that are not good for 
children.

not scattering books, playthings, articles of clothing, etc. ; 
cleaning feet on wet days; helping with sweeping and dust- 
ing ; keeping the yard in good order. 
Seventh- and eighth-grade material.—The subject-mat- 
ter to be taught in home economics has not been so fully 
standardized as that in arithmetic, geography, etc. Thi 
is partly because the branch is still new, and partly becaus 
the instruction must be determined with reference to the tim 
and equipment available. In general, the caution needs t 
be urged not to attempt too much at one time. It is usuall 
better to carry on but one line of study, as foods, or cloth 
ing, at a time. 
No detailed analysis of material need be given her 
Excellent outlines are now supplied by state or district a 
thority wherever the subject is taught. The following su; 
gests the general scope of the work which, as already ind 
cated, must be adapted to local needs and conditions: 
Foods and Cooking. 1. A study of the kitchen, its a 
rangement, and best utensils; care, cleaning, furnishing. 
2. The body’s need of food; different kinds required ; a 
ticles of diet that supply each element ; effect of cooking

      Organization and Presentation 
Domestic science, like agriculture, is a subject that must 
be made very concrete and its lessons carried at once into 
effect if they are to serve their purpose. There is small 
value in teaching our girls general and detached facts 
about food, clothing and the home, if it is to end in mere 
information. What we must do is to lead them to apply 
what they learn in doing with greater intelligence and skill 
to the things that need to be done in the home. 
Connecting school and home work.—There are three 
distinct but intimately related phases of instruction in 
domestic science: (1) the study of facts, principles, rules in 
the text-books, the recitation or the laboratory; (2) the 
application of these truths in the school laboratory under the 
direction of the teacher ; and (3) the carrying of this knowl- 
edge and skill over into home practise. The last of these 
should also be under the general supervision of the teacher 
(or special supervisor) wherever possible. Not until the in- 
struction has taken effect in real housekeeping and there 
become a standard of action is the responsibility of th 
teacher ended. 
This point of view suggests that the teacher’s plan for in 
struction must include recitation work, laboratory work, an 
home project work. After a topic has been discussed an 
demonstrated in class there should be definite home applica 
tion made wherever possible. For example, a study of cer 
foods may lead to one pupil planning, cooking and servin; 
the breakfast cereals at her home for a week or a mont!

  after which she makes a report of her problems and success. 
Another may do the same with vegetables, desserts or the 
whole meal. A third may take charge of sweeping and dust- 
ing or bed-making. Still another may be from a home 
where a new house is being built or furnished or an old 
house being repaired. All members of the class will be 
planning for new clothes. It is in connection with these 
practical and immediate interests that the best work (the 
only really valuable work) can be done. 
Laboratory work in the rural school—The new con- 
solidated rural schools usually supply laboratory and equip- 
ment for domestic-science work equal to that in town 
schools. The one-room rural school is, however, at a serious 
disadvantage. Yet much excellent work is being done in 
many such schools. In some cases the district has equipped 
he basement for a laboratory ; in other cases the equipment 
Imust be used in the general room. The laboratory material 
should be supplied from the funds of the district, but this is 
ot always done. Many rural teachers have had school 
ntertainments to secure money for equipment. In other 
laces the patrons have had a domestic-science “shower” 
or the school laboratory. The following minimum list of 
ooking utensils for a one-room school is recommended :*

  Many rural schools are giving practical training in do- 
mestic science by serying hot noonday lunches. Where this 
is done, each child may bring his own dishes from home, or 
-the school may purchase a supply such as the following: 
114 doz. teaspoons @ 30 cents per doz.. 
1% doz. soup spoons @ 40 cents per doz.. 
1% doz. forks @ 40 cents per doz........ Rae 
1% doz. plates @ 60 cents per doz............. 
1% doz. cups and saucers @ $1.20 per doz...... 
1% doz. glasses @ 50 cents per doz.............    
Probably the best stove for the rural school is the two- 
burner, blue flame kerosene. With the oven it costs fro 
nine to ten dollars. A kitchen cabinet for utensils and a cup: 
board for dishes should also be supplied. The total equip: 
ment as here described can be bought for twenty to thirt 
dollars. |

/' “Our food was always satisfying and easily made. For 
example, if we were going to have mashed potatoes and 
gravy, several children were appointed to pare the potatoes. 
They did this at recess. Also, fire was started and water 
put on to heat. After school had been called, when I noticed 
that the water was boiling I would signal one of the children 
to put the potatoes to cook. As soon as this was done the 
child would go back to his seat and proceed with his lessons. 
At gravy-making time a different one was signaled to attend 
tothe gravy. Another was called upon to mash the potatoes. 
Books were laid away at eleven fifty-five, desks cleaned and 
hands washed. Here was a chance for the smaller ones to 
help. Waste paper baskets must be passed, napkins distrib- 
luted, knives, forks and spoons placed. . One of the older pu- 
lpils served the potatoes directly upon the plates and then 
assed the plates to another pupil who served the gravy. 
he medium-aged children carried the served plates to the , 
esks. This was continued until all were served. The cook- 
ing dishes were put to soak and all went to their seats. 
“When all were seated, eating began. When the meal was 
nished all excused themselves and if they had no work 
lo do, they went out-of-doors to play. Those who had work 
ad certain jobs to do such as gathering up dishes, remov- 
g crumbs, getting the kitchen in readiness for washing 
ishes and so forth. We kept a posted list so that there was 
lo mixing up on work. Generally I had four helpers. One 
washing, two for drying and another to help with the 
eeping. It was always necessary to sweep at noons. We 
ed a sawdust sweeping compound. In this way we man- 
ed to eat and get everything in shape again before one 
clock. All the workers had from ten to twenty minutes at 
on for play.” : 
      
         
       
   
        
       
        
      
    
     
       
   
     “Besides the demonstration work I require my girls to 
ep home economics note-books, neatly written with pen 
dink. All recipes, reference notes, etc., must be kept 
these books. This work is easily correlated with their 
itten language lessons, and it is a source of pleasure to my 
Is, for nearly all of them are greatly interested in ‘keep- 
up their books.’ 
‘The work in domestic science carries over nicely with the
-P-A-G-E-360
        346 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
home work of the children. I have required now and then, 
that the girls make some certain recipe at home over Satur- 
day. Nearly always they do this whether I ask it or not. 
When we make a good recipe at school, nearly always the 
pupils are anxious to try it at home. I think it has also 
brought the girls’ home and school work closer together, 
for instance: One Friday afternoon we invited all the 
mothers of the district up to the schoolhouse. They came 
early, watched the preparation of the lunch by the girls, and 
were then served by them. The girls were all anxious to 
do their best.”    
   
   
     
    
    
         
    
     
   
         
       “T usually spend one hour Friday afternoon for sewing. 
The cooking is done mostly during recess, noon hour or 
before school in the morning. Soup has been a favorite with 
us. Corn soup, potato soup, tomato soup, vegetable soup 
and bean soup are mostly made. We made other things be- 
sides the soups. Rice, beans, beef, apples and cabbage were 
cooked. Of course we studied the composition of the dif- 
ferent foods, peculiarities, etc. Recipes were placed on the 
blackboard and pupils copied them. 
“I generally appointed two or three girls or boys to take 
complete charge of the noonday lunch. In this way each 
could be given actual practise in serving, washing dishes, etc. 
“The boys were as interested in the domestic science as 
the girls. 
“When a new dish was made at school the pupils woul 
tell me the next morning about their experience makin 
it at home the night before. The parents were very muc! 
interested. They furnished dishes, pans, kettles and sup 
plies.” 
Problem work.—The management and care of a hom 
presents many very real and difficult problems. Trainin 
in domestic science should involve similar problems, typi 
of those constantly to be met in the home. ‘These proble 
should be as genuine and immediate as possible and be a: 
signed for definite study, investigation and discussion. T! 
following are suggestive of suitable problems:

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1, What is the law, if any, covering the teaching of domestic 
science in your state? Is the law being carried out in practise? Is 
your school doing its share? Is it seeking to lead? 
2. Have you adequate equipment for teaching domestic science? 
If not, have you considered means for adding to it? In most commu- 
nities there is no trouble in raising funds either (1) through direct 
appropriation by the school board, (2) by solicitation by pupils and 
teacher, (3) by contributions of utensils, etc., by patrons, or (4) by 
means of a school entertainment. 
3. What plan should be taken to pay for current supplies used in 
the laboratory or for noonday lunches where there is no distinct 
fund available; shall (1) each pupil furnish certain articles, (2) each 
contribute a small amount of money, (3) a fund be raised by an 
entertainment, or (4) some other plan be used? Work out a state- 
ment of advantages and difficulties for each plan. 
4. What method do you employ to interest the boys in the 
phases of domestic science which they should study? How do you 
cultivate the cooperation of the parents? Have you had a patrors’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-362

luncheon prepared and served by the pupils? What are the advan- 
tages of such a plan? ‘ 
5. What books, bulletins, etc, on domestic science has your 
school library? Do you keep the library growing? Do, you use it? 
Do the children take the material home so that the parents may be- 
come interested in it? In what ways is your instruction improving 
the home life of your community?

Part Three: Class-Room Management 
CHAPTER XXI 
MANAGEMENT AND THE RECITATION 
HE value of good management is more and more’ be- 
ing recognized in business and industrial concerns. Ey- 
ery effort is made to eliminate waste of effort, time and 
material. The scientific expert with his stop-watch dic- 
tates what movements shall go into the laying of a brick 
or the packing of a box. The farmer with his scales decides 
which cow shall go to the dairy and which to the block. We 
pay fabulous salaries to men who can so manage a’ business 
that the largest returns shall be realized from its activities. 
The same necessity for good management exists in teach- 
ing; for the best of instruction may be defeated by poor 
management in the class room. {The problems of class- 
room management center about two great aims: (1) to 
supply the most favorable conditions under which the work 
of instruction shall go on; (2) so to direct the associations 
and procedure of the class room that they shall in them- 
selves prove a means of education and development. While 
these two aims should never be separated in fact, and need 
not be for our discussion, they should both be kept dis- 
tinctly in mind in managing the class room. 
Measures of Good Management 
What are the objective measures by which a teacher 
may judge the success of his own management, or by which

| 
he should be judged by superintendent or principal? What 
are the characteristics of a well-managed recitation? 
All activities must advance the work in hand.—This is 
the test that the business concern would employ; it is the 
test teachers should employ. If one studies the activities 
going on in a poorly-managed office, store or shop, he will 
note that there are too much confusion, too much busyness 
that does not count, too many distractions, and too little 
driving directly ahead for results. In a well-managed 
concern all is different; none of this futile waste is in evi- 
dence, but all moves forward with ordered precision and 
effectiveness. Precisely the same principles apply to the 
class room. In the poorly-managed recitation there may be 
much of life, even of enthusiasm, but there is too much 
loss of time and effort, too much aimless activity, too little 
arriving at definite results. 
~s In the well-managed class room all moves smoothly and 
without friction. The observer would realize that a care- 
fully-conceived plan was being carried out, but would be 
unable to discover the controlling mechanism. There is 
an absence of friction. There is no loss of time. There 
are no unnecessary distractions. There may be more or 
less of noise and bustle; that will depend on the nature 
of the work. For example, a class in laboratory work or 
shop work can not maintain the quiet of the ordinary reci- 
tation room. Nor is this necessary. This is the test: Is all 
that is going on advancing the purpose of the recitation? 
If this can be answered in the affirmative, the manage- 
ment is in so far good. If it must be answered in the nega- 
tive the teacher should at once go to work on the problem 
involved. The pupils can not too early be brought to see 
that the school is their business, and that the same principles 
must apply in the class room as in business outside—each 
one must do his share to make the business a success, None 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
     MANAGEMENT AND THE RECITATION 351 
must, through inattention, mischief, or any other defect of 
behavior, lower the output of the school concern any more 
than he would be allowed to do so in a business concern. 
The application of this simple and obvious principle will 
do away with the necessity for a complex and extended set 
of rules. One boy, when he was rebuked by his teacher 
for some act, said he did not know it was against the rules. 
The teacher replied that there was no rule on the matter, 
and asked him whether he thought such an act helped or 
hindered the work of the school. He readily agreed that 
from this point of view his act was wrong, and by so do- 
ing committed himself to better conduct. Many school 
offenses should be judged, not on the usual moral grounds, 
but by the standard of promoting or injuring the business of 
the class room. 
Motives for control to be largely subjective—The best 
control is self-control. The best-managed class room will 
therefore afford the largest possible freedom for self-direc- 
tion that can be successfully employed. This proposition 
does not: favor lax control, slack government, or weak 
discipline. Far from it. Every wise teacher has for the 
first plank in his platform of management high standards of 
order and a rigid meeting of reasonable requirements. The 
question turns on how this condition is to be brought about. 
Far better bring it about by the teacher’s direct authority, 
and even by punishment, than not to secure control and 
order in the school. But better yet if the pupils develop 
such an interest in the school, such standards of personal 
conduct, and such loyalty to the work of their group that 
each governs his own conduct for the good of all. 
The school or class room that does not place a consider- 
able burden of personal responsibility on the pupil is cheat- 
ing him out of a part of his education. For to be obliged 
constantly to find the warrant for one’s conduct in some au- 
    
-P-A-G-E-366
      
   
                                 
       { 352 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
thority outside of himself is to leave him in some degree un- 
developed in his moral nature and a slave to circumstances. 
And self-control, like any other power, develops through its 
use. 
This does not mean that the teacher shall at any time 
cease to be a factor in the control of the school. It rather 
means that his control should become increasingly indirect. 
It is easy enough for any person of intelligence and force, 
especially with the authority of the law behind him, to con- 
trol a school by direct compulsion, But to control it by 
stimulating the pupils’ interest in achievement, by arous- 
ing their better natures, by appealing to their sense of 
justice, loyalty and fair play—in short, to put the reins of 
conduct into their own hands, but make sure at the same 
time that they handle them aright, this is an altogether more 
difficult task. An objective military régime of class-room 
control is easy—it may even be cheap; a subjective moral 
régime is difficult to set up and maintain, but it bears rich 
fruit in character. 
The Spirit of the Class Room       
     The importance of the group spirit can not be over- 
estimated in class-room management. Public opinion is one 
of the strongest forces operating in society. Let the spirit 
of the class room be good, and details of conduct will cause 
relatively little trouble. But let the attitude be bad, let 
loyalty to the school and the teacher be at a low ebb, let the 
bonds of class spirit be weak, and many of the best and 
strongest incentives are lost. 
Cultivation of class-room spirit—Pupils often fail to 
realize the identity of interests between themselves and the 
teacher. There is not a little hidden tension, if not overt 
antagonism, between teacher and class in many schools. 
            
                        
   
-P-A-G-E-367
  MANAGEMENT AND THE RECITATION 353 
The children often think of themselves as on one side and 
the teacher on the other. If they can play tricks, evade 
requirements, or oppose regulations without getting caught 
or punished, they feel that they have achieved a victory. 
This attitude, so greatly to be lamented, is probably in most 
instances to be blamed against unfortunate school experi- 
ences of the children rather than laid to any natural antag- 
onism inherent in their own natures. The real inner ten- 
dency of most children is toward cooperation. Given the 
right incentives and conditions, and they will as devotedly 
work with the teacher as they will heartily work against him 
under different conditions. 
It is all-important that the teacher shall clearly realize 
this encouraging truth. For it is a much more inspiring 
task to set one’s self to win loyalty and cooperation that 
are lying ready, even if fallow, than to overcome natively 
inherent opposition. The teacher who has an abiding faith 
in human nature will also win a thousandfold better re- 
sponse from children than one who is naturally suspicious. 
On the whole, one finds in others, even if they be children, 
very much what he expects and looks for. 
The spirit of the surroundings—No small factor in 
creating the class-room spirit is the room itself. More than 
one teacher has found the spirit of a class thoroughly trans- 
formed by the class being moved from a dingy, disagreeable, 
oppressive room to pleasant, attractive and artistic surround- 
ings. Good equipment, clean floors and. well-decorated 
walls, good pictures, and whatever other features will com- 
pel adrhiration and stimulate good feeling are sure to be 
reflected in the spirit of the class. Let one who doubts this 
statement himself try living for a time in a house that is 
undergoing repairs or that for any other reason has things 
strewn about in topsyturvy fashion and is none too clean. 
If the spirit of the surroundings does not find expression 
\
-P-A-G-E-368
| + | t 
354 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
in his own attitude he is a rare exception to a common rule 
of experience. There is a deep moral value in the esthetic 
that is too often overlooked in school surroundings. 
Influence of the community spirit—It is an American 
custom to speak out unreservedly in criticism of any pub- 
lic act or institution that may not please. Such criticism, 
if well considered and directed at real faults, is helpful. 
Irresponsible criticism, or faultfinding based on mere whim 
or biased report, may often do much harm. The public 
school suffers from too much criticism of this irrational 
type. The child goes home with a grievance or a complaint 
and the parents are outspoken and often bitter in their criti- 
__cism of the teacher or the school. The bit of poison planted 
| in the child’s mind by thoughtless criticism can not but viti- 
ate in some degree the atmosphere of the room to which 
he belongs. 
One of the insistent problems confronting the teacher, 
therefore, is to have his work stand well in the community. 
This is not to be accomplished by any shallow social acts 
or pleasing devices aimed to attract public acclaim. It is, 
rather, so fully, honestly.and completely to enter into the 
spirit and life of the community that the response toward 
both one’s work and himself is of a spontancous loyalty, 
such as any community stands ready to give to skilled effort 
‘and unselfish devotion. 
Interest and class-room spirit.—The only true and per- 
manent class-room spirit must spring from interest in the 
work. Only as one’s tasks are congenial and satisfying does 
he give himself loyally and whole-heartedly to their ac- 
complishment. The class who are at outs with a certain 
study, and feel it but an empty grind, can hardly be in good 
spirit while working or reciting upon it. No small part of 
the trouble caused by mischievous or antagonistic pupils
-P-A-G-E-369
MANAGEMENT AND THE RECITATION 355 
can unquestionably be traced to the fact that they “don’t 
like” grammar, or “don’t see anything to” literature. 
The problem is one of being able to command the deeper 
enthusiasms. More than one unruly boy has been turned 
into a loyal supporter of the school through his newly-found 
interest in manual training, agriculture, current history or 
some other subject. To develop the right school spirit we 
must get hold of the work interest of our pupils. Experi- 
ence has many times shown that this is the only anchorage 
strong enough to hold the deeper loyalty either of children 
or adults. 
The influence of leadership.—The influence of leader- 
ship is a school factor always to be reckoned with. With- 
out any election or appointment to the position, certain pu- 
pils naturally step into the place of leader and impose their 
attitudes and ideals upon their followers. Every class 
group has one or more such leaders. Happy is the teacher 
who can, through his own greater power of leadership, 
cause the leaders of their groups to lead them in the right 
direction. The wise teacher will know from the start that 
school-room’ misdemeanors and disorders which involve 
considerable numbers of pupils usually have their storm 
center in the suggestion or control exercised by some mis- 
chievous leader. Once this source of disturbance is dis- 
covered and turned into a supporter of the school régime 
the battle is largely won. 
      
     
    
    The Personal Factor in Class-Room Management 
Teachers probably differ fully as much in executive, or 
managerial, ability as in intellectual attainment. Some per- 
sonalities naturally command respect and cooperation, while 
others seem to invite antagonism and disloyalty.
-P-A-G-E-370
    356 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
Decision and poise of character—Half unaware to 
themselves children rather unerringly read the inner nature 
and characteristics of their teachers. One boy remarked that 
he would rather have Miss A scold him for half an hour 
than to have Miss B give him one good look. On being 
asked what was so dreadful about Miss B’s look, he said, 
- “Oh, she doesn’t look cross, but you just feel that she doesn’t 
expect you to do that again.” Without understanding it 
himself this boy had sensed the difference between a vacil- 
lating nature and a personality secure in its poise and de- 
cision. 
Poise, or decision, is worth while in itself, and should be 
cultivated even though it were not needed in the school 
room. This quality of personality does not come by chance ; 
it rests on a sense of mastery and power. One who is not 
certain of himself can never impress others with his poise, 
for he will not possess it. Let the teacher who feels the lack 
of poise and decision master his problems; let him feel that 
he is in command of his subject; that he can teach it ef- 
fectively ; that he understands his pupils; that he knows 
how to govern as well as teach—let him reach the self- 
confidence that comes from certainty, and there will be 
no trouble about his poise. Decision will then radiate from 
every act and attitude. 
On the other hand, let any teacher doubt his ability to! 
cope with the problems that confront him, let him feel un- 
certain of his mastery and power, and the crippling effect: 
of his attitude will be revealed in his very bearing and man. 
ner. The way to develop poise and impressiveness is to ge 
mastery! 
Uniformity of demands.—This quality is closely re 
lated to the one just discussed.. To be strict to-day an 
easy to-morrow is sooner or later to forfeit something of thi 
respect, if not of the good will, of the school. In spite o
-P-A-G-E-371
    MANAGEMENT AND THE RECITATION 357 
the fact that teachers are human, and that brains do get 
fagged and nerves frayed, it pays to do one’s best to rise 
above one’s moods or whims and be the same from day to day. 
It was no great compliment that a certain student paid his 
teacher when he warned a classmate about to enter the 
room which he himself had just left, “Look sharp, the ‘old 
man’s’ nerves are on a tear to-day!” 
Classes themselves are variable. They have their good 
and their bad days, and need to be judged accordingly. 
Probably every teacher has also observed the tendency of 
schools to “run down” near the end of a term or just be- 
fore a holiday or some special event. The teacher’s ideal 
should be to equalize all these fluctuations in his school by 
an increase of his own power, inspiration and effectiveness. 
These must act as the governor acts on an engine to steady 
its motion if the school machinery is to run effectively. 
The futility of scolding—Scolding is a mistake. It 
has little or no place in the class room. It may temporarily 
work on some particular occasion, but the reaction from its 
effects is generally costly to the respect of the teacher if in- 
deed not to his authority. Scolding has a strong tendency 
to grow into a habit, and then it is far worse than useless. 
The scolder usually says more than he intends and far more 
than could do any good. Not infrequently indignation in- 
creases with its expression, and the mild reproof grows into 
a tirade, which is remembered with shame and humiliation. 
The following incident, which came under the writer’s 
observation, illustrates the fate of the scolder: A group 
of girls just graduated from high school were discussing 
their teachers, and commenting on their characteristics. One 
of the group remarked: “Now, there is our principal; 
maybe you think we didn’t make things interesting for-him! 
We girls used to meet together evenings to devise ways to 
torment him.” On being asked why they had a pick at this
-P-A-G-E-372
    
358 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
particular teacher, she replied: “Oh, we really had nothing 
against him; we only wanted to see him ‘perform,’ and he 
never disappointed us. We were willing to take any sort 
of scolding just to get him started upon a tirade.” 
Scolding is bad from another point of view. It deals in 
negatives, which are on the whole not helpful or inspiring. 
Children need occasionally to be told of their faults. They 
need correction. They may even require punishment. But 
they should not be nagged. They should, as a rule, be led 
rather than driven. They should be fed on positives, rather 
than on negatives. 
One of the first qualities the teacher should cultivate, 
therefore, i is the ability to be strongly insistent pao un- 
due sharpness ; to be stern without being “cross”; to be en- 
tirely immovable and severe when occasion demands it, 
without blustering, threatening or losing the temper. In 
short, to be so thoroughly sure of himself and secure in his 
self-control that he’ is justified in exercising control ove1 
others. 
Class-Room Routine 
By class-room routine is meant the set of movements 
and activities involved in calling and dismissing classes, 
passing and collecting materials, rising when reciting, re- 
sponding to the roll-call, or doing any other of the many 
things which must frequently be performed by all. All of 
these common movements which include the whole class 
should rigidly follow a definite plan or routine. 
Routine saves time friction—Every skilful manager, 
whether in factory, office or school, uses a fixed routine 
wherever it will not interfere with individual initiative or 
efficiency. Such a system saves time, eliminates friction and 
confusion, and reduces the strain on attention. 
The teacher should from the first day have a simple but 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
     MANAGEMENT AND THE RECITATION 359 
definite plan for carrying out each part of the mechan- 
ics of the class room. The signals for calling and dismiss- 
ing the class should always be the same, and should be fol- 
lowed to the letter. For example, if the class are to stand at 
a given signal, then none should be permitted to loiter, nor 
to start ahead of the others. If all are to remain standing 
until the last one has reached his position, then none should 
be allowed to be seated until the right moment. If papers 
are to be handed in folded in a certain way, then no other 
way should be accepted. If they are to be collected in a 
certain order in the class, then this precise order should be 
insisted upon. In short, it is impossible to be too insistent 
on these seemingly small matters. The difference between 
good management and poor management often turns on just 
such factors. i 
Routine and habit—Some may feel that requirements 
of such rigid sort savor too much of the military and have 
no place in the school. This objection overlooks the fact 
that one of the chief features of the child’s education is 
training in obedience. One of the besetting weaknesses of 
children (and adults?) is carelessness. “I forgot,’*‘I didn’t 
mean to,” “I didn’t think,” are all evidences of need of 
training in obedience to requirements of some kind. The 
child who has not learned to follow directions, and follow 
them to the letter, has been deprived of an important part 
of his training. 
Nor is the following of a reasonable class-room routine 
any hardship to the children. It is as easy in the end to do 
a thing right as wrong. It is as easy to learn to do it each 
time in the same way as to be haphazard about it. Children 
of elementary school age easily lend themselves to routine 
training. They like to march in order, perform drills to- 
gether, or carry out other group movements. They are at 
the best age for forming habits of accuracy, promptness and 
        
   
                   
    
-P-A-G-E-374
         360 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
cooperation. A good school routine, kindly but firmly car- 
ried out, is one of the best methods of training such habits. 
Routine a measure of the teacher—While there are 
many other factors besides routine in good management, 
_there is none by which a teacher’s skill in management can 
better be judged. The chance visitor who looks in upon a 
class in which all the mechanical activities are seemingly 
moving without direction or attention, but are moving nev- 
ertheless like clockwork, is justified in expecting other 
phases of management to show equal efficiency. On the 
other hand, if the class lacks esprit de corps, if the pupils 
saunter up and drop into the recitation seats at will, if they 
have no orderly way of responding to signals, if they have 
no common method of doing the same frequently required 
things, then it is fair to conclude that the teacher lacks ex- 
ecutive ability. For the standards of the teacher are finally 
reflected in the management of the class room. 
Physical Conditions in the Class Room 
  
  Efficient class-room management does not overlook the 
physical conditions. These are important both for their 
bearing on the success of the recitation and for their rela- 
tion to health. Beyond doubt much of the physical lassi- 
tude and mental dulness observed in many classes come 
from the unhygienic conditions of the class room. No small 
proportion of the colds, sore throats, or even worse troubles, 
are blamable to the same source. 
Fresh air to breathe.—No teacher needs to be instructed 
in the evil effects on both mind and body which come from 
breathing vitiated air. Knowledge of such facts is a com- 
monplace. Yet our school rooms are not always well venti- 
lated. The teacher has many things demanding his attention, 
     
                  
-P-A-G-E-375
MANAGEMENT AND THE RECITATION 361 
and the air of the room may become stale or overheated or 
too dry without being noticed. We all know much more 
hygiene than we put into practise, even where the interests 
are not so vital as in a room full of children. 
ood management will insist (1) that the air in the class 
room be in circulation, either from an adequate ventilating ~ 
system or by means of open windows so managed as to pro- 
tect from direct drafts; (2) that the temperature be from 
sixty-five to seventy degrees; (3) that the heated air in 
winter shall have a sufficient amount of moisture. To make 
sure on these points, the room should be equipped with a 
thermometer so placed as to register fairly for the entire 
room and a hygrometer of some simple type for the record- 
ing of atmospheric cates These instruments are fully 
as necessary as charts and blackboards, and should at once 
be added to rooms where they are lacking. 
Freedom from dust.—The sweeping and dusting of 
many school rooms are hardly up to the standards of good 
housekeeping. Often the floors are of soft lumber, with 
wide cracks between the boards, and no provision made for 
frequent and thorough cleaning. Blackboards and erasers 
are not infrequently laden with chalk dust. Dusty air is 
fully as dangerous to health and vitality as rebreathed air. 
Whether the teacher is directly responsible for the cleanli- 
ness of the room, therefore, as is still true in many rural 
schools, or whether a janitor is employed, it is a part of the 
teacher’s business to see that the room is clean and free 
from dust. 
This will necessitate the use of sweeping compounds, 
suitable brooms, oiled dusting cloths, etc., of as good qual- 
ity as would be found in a modern home. To secure these 
things and see that they are properly used is one of the 
teacher’s problems as manager.

362. CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT | : 
Th pupils’ standard of cleanliness and order.—Every 
pupil should come to school clean and neat in person and 
clothing. Nothing less than this should be tolerated, both 
because of the interests of the school as a whole and for 
the good of the pupils directly concerned. A rigid require- 
ment of orderly desks, well-arranged books and materials, 
and freedom from litter on the floor should be relentlessly 
enforced. Good housekeeping should be the rule, and the 
standard should first of all be set, of course, by the teacher 
in the care of his own desk, materials and belongings. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Are you troubled with mischief in your recitations? If so, 
can you locate the leader of the trouble? What do you judge is 
the cause of such mischief, lack of interest in the work, lack of 
class loyalty, lack of respect for the teacher, or some other con- 
dition? 
2. Are your class-room signals simple and reasonable? Are 
they well followed? Do you find certain pupils who are constantly 
careless on such matters? If so, what measures have you taken to 
cure this fundamental defect of character? 
3. As you consider the motives which control in your class-room 
order, do you think they originate chiefly in your command, or in 
the attitude and good will of the pupils? Contrast the ultimate 
effects on character of governing one’s conduct because of an ob- 
jective requirement, and governing it because of the demands of 
his own inner nature; i. ¢., of being good because one has to or 
because he wants to. 
- 4, Compare the spirit of your class room with that of other 
class rooms you know. With your own ideal for it. What fac- 
tors do you judge are necessary in order to improve the spirit? 
5. Estimate your own poise and decision. Do you feel securely 
in command of your class-room problems? What effect has a feel- 
ing of inadequacy on your happiness? On producing fatigue and 
worn nerves? Do you worry? If so, analyze the elements that go 
into a condition of worry, and decide whether any good results. 
Do you scold?

CHAPTER XXII 
CLASS-ROOM MANAGEMENT AND MORAL CONDUCT 
VERY thoughtful teacher knows that the final outcome 
of education must be character, else the whole process 
has been a failure. And character is to be defined in pos- 
itive instead of negative terms. Our youth must be trained 
not only to be good, but to be good for something. They 
must not only be able to resist temptation, but be willing to 
stand, aggressively if need be, for the right. They must not 
only know what constitutes high moral standards, but be 
so led in daily practise that such standards become the habit 
of their natures. 
All the activities and relations of the school should lead 
to moral ends. Each study should bear its share of the 
responsibility. The personal influence of the teacher should 
contribute its part. The associations of pupils in their work 
and play should bring out moral lessons and values. The 
management of those class-room relations discussed in the 
preceding chapter will have a moral bearing. Certain other, 
features of the class room lie even closer to the development 
of character; these will be briefly discussed in the present 
chapter. 
Misdemeanors 
As long as there are schools and children there will be 
misdemeanors. While there are misdemeanors there will 
be penalties. Dealing with the matter of misdemeanors and 
their punishment constitutes a very real and trying problem 
in many schools. 
364
-P-A-G-E-379
CLASS-ROOM MANAGEMENT AND MORAL CONDUCT 365 
What constitutes a misdemeanor.—Misdemeanors in 
school may roughly be divided into two broad classes: (1) 
acts that in themselves are not wrong, but which hinder the 
work of the school; (2) acts that are in themselves funda- 
mentally immoral. Familiar examples of the first type are 
whispering, writing notes, playing practical jokes, distract- 
ing the attention of others, being inattentive. Examples of 
the second type are bad language, dishonesty in work, de- 
stroying the property of others, lying or deceiving, stealing, 
ete, 
From the beginning children should be brought to see the 
distinction in these two classes of acts: the first’ is wrong be- 
cause such acts injure the’class by hindering the best work; 
the second is wrong just because it is wrong, anywhere and 
all the time. This simple distinction, without any ethical 
analysis, is easily grasped by children, and it helps them to 
understand and see the justice of necessary regulations 
which otherwise might appear very arbitrary. A fourth- 
grade boy, when rebuked by his teacher for whispering to 
a neighbor, said with great earnestness, “Why, there isn’t 
any harm in whispering!” The wise teacher answered, 
“Not the least harm the way you mean it, Tom; but does it 
help or hinder our work?” “I suppose of course it hinders,” 
said Tom. This little incident may not have transformed 
Tom into an angelic pupil who from that time on needed no 
further attention to his conduct, but it did give him a valu- 
able moral distinction. It broadened his idea of class-room 
rights and wrongs. 
The value of confession.—A child who has confessed 
a wrong act has already gone far toward its atonement. 
Especially is this true if the confession is voluntary and 
prompted by the child’s own conscience ; for such a confes- 
sion quickens the moral sense and strengthens self-control. 
The pressure of group opinion is a strong incentive to     
            
    
  
-P-A-G-E-380
    366 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
confession when it can successfully be brought to bear on 
the right side. Ina certain school a boy had during an inter- 
mission accidentally broken a window while the teacher was 
out of the room. The other boys at once crowded about Joe 
with the question, “What are you going to do about it, Joe?” 
Joe answered, “She won’t know who did it. T’ll not tell.” 
“But you’ve got to tell,” the group argued. “You know 
Miss Jones told us we might play in here if we would be 
careful not to break anything. You broke it, now you’ve 
got to tell!” And Joe’s group made him tell. It would have 
been better if Joe had had the moral strength to decide for 
himself that he must confess, but since he had not, it was 
well for him to learn the justice and compulsion of public 
opinion. Confession compelled by the teacher, even, is bet- 
ter than harboring a concealed wrong; but such a confession 
is often construed by the child as a necessary yielding to au- 
thority, and hence loses much of its moral effect. 
Accusation versus confession.—The teacher should be 
very sure of his facts before he accuses a child of a wrong 
act. An unjust accusation may leave a wound that is long 
in healing, and is sure to cause the teacher a loss of respect 
and loyalty. And even if the teacher is sure of his case 
against the child it is still a thousand times better to lead 
the child to a confession. A culprit confronted by an ac- 
cusation, or even by a threatening question, may in his fear 
and weakness tell a lie. If the teacher follows up the ac- 
cusation or question with others still more insistent the 
child, having lied once, may easily lie a dozen times in suc- 
cession, through seeking to corroborate his first statement. 
Beyond doubt many children are unintentionally driven into 
lying and deceiving by unwise grillings over minor misde- 
meanors. Much practise in sharp trickery and skilful 
evasion may be actually forced upon children by lack of 
wisdom in handling their faults. _
-P-A-G-E-381
CLASS-ROOM MANAGEMENT AND MORAL conDucT 367 
Shall we then say that children must never be confronted 
with a direct accusation of their misdemeanors? This does 
not follow. But before such accusation is made the teacher 
must be sure of his case. He must then present the accusa- 
tion in such a way as to allow no denial or evasion. But it 
is, still better, as we have said above, to bring the child to 
the victory of a confession. 
One teacher says, “Tom, did you break that window ?”— 
“Now don’t deny it !’—“Don’t you know it’s wrong to lie?” 
—“Now you might just as well own up.” And poor Tom 
keeps getting deéper and deeper in the mire of falsehood and 
denial. A wiser teacher says pleasantly to Tom, “Tom, I 
wish you would tell me how it was about that window. I’m 
sorry you happened to break it.” Thus encouraged, Tom 
will find it relatively easy to tell the truth. And even if 
he does not at once confess, no harm has been done the 
case by asking for Tom’s version of the accident. The prin- 
ciple can not be too strongly emphasized that the success- 
ful disciplinarian is not the teacher who can break the child’s 
false testimony down and fix the wrong act upon him in 
spite of denials. The good disciplinarian is the one who 
can save the culprit from falsehood and help him achieve 
a moral victory. 
Shall children tell on one another.—A writer in The 
Outlook propounded the following very simple problem :* 
Two boys, called Bad and Good were one day out by the 
schoolhouse. Bad said to Good, “I’m going to throw this 
snowball and break the window.” ‘He did so. The teacher 
asked each pupil separately who broke the window. No one 
confessed. The teacher then asked the whole school to- 
gether who broke the window. No one answered. The 
pioblem to be answered is (1) What should Good have 
1H. E. Hall, The Outlook, Jan. 11, 1913.
-P-A-G-E-382

368 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND dab ulsie 
done? (2) Should the teacher haye asked who broke the 
window? it j 
This simple moral problem aroused so great an interest 
that The Outlook received many hundreds of letters from 
men and women in all occupations—homekeepers, teachers, 
lawyers, judges, statesmen, ministers, laborers. The inter- 
esting point is that the writers differed radically on both 
questions. Some claimed that Good should have told on 
Bad, and others insisted that he should not. Some thought 
the teacher was right in asking the questions she put to the 
pupils and the school, and others thought she was unwise. 
It.is not our purpose here to attempt dogmatically to set- 
tle the disputed questions. Where opinions differ so widely 
the truth can not all be on one side. Certain points, how- 
ever, would seem to be reasonably easy to reach agreement 
upon: We do not want our pupils to be tale-bearers. No 
one likes the tell-tale, and he is sure if the habit becomes 
chronic to develop a bad spirit toward other people. Pupils 
should therefore not be encouraged to report minor misde- 
meanors upon one another. Teachers should not ask for in- 
formation that would require petty tale-bearing. 
On the other hand, children should not be allowed to 
develop a false sense of loyalty to their group which leads 
them to shield one guilty of a grave offense. The spirit to 
be cultivated is loyalty to the common good before loyalty 
to the individual member. Children should therefore be 
encouraged and expected to report such offenses as endanger 
the morality or welfare of the school. Furthermore, they 
should develop the moral courage to tell on a fellow pupil 
when they think they ought. 
Better than to tell on the culprit, however, is, as suggested 
in the preceding section, for his classmates to bring him to 
confession. One teacher wisely handled a difficult matter 
as follows: Coming into her sixth-grade room after an ab-
-P-A-G-E-383
  
i 
CLASS-ROOM MANAGEMENT AND MORAL conpucT 369 
sence and finding a piece of statuary broken, she said quietly 
to the pupils: “Is there any one who would like to tell me 
that he broke the statue?” No one volunteered. Then she 
said to the school, “I think a good many of you must know 
who broke the statue. You remember it was given us by 
a friend of the school, who I am sure will be grieved that 
we have broken it. I think that those of you who know 
how the accident happened should see that the ones who are 
to blame make the loss good. That would be fair and would 
look much better for our class.” There were no commands 
and no threats; only an appeal to justice and class loyalty. 
And it worked. That evening a delegation appeared at the 
teacher’s desk and the spokesman said: “Harry and Mary 
(who were members of the delegation), wanted you to know 
that they broke the statue, but we were all more or less to 
blame; for we were chasing one another about the room. 
So we think that we all ought to help pay for the loss.” This 
indeed was a true victory for all concerned, and one that 
ought to be more often duplicated in school-room discipline 
than it is. 
Punishment of Misdemeanors 
A lesson which every child should thoroughly learn is that 
disobedience to law brings punishment. Nature early forces 
this lesson upon the attention of the individual. The babe 
touches the lamp and is burned. The boy eats the forbidden 
green apples and pays the penalty of pain and bitter doses. 
True, there are sentimentalists who say that children should 
never be punished by parents or teachers, for fear that it 
may hinder the child’s “natural” development. But this posi- 
tion is contradicted both by common sense and experience. 
The child’s natural tendencies may lead him very far astray. 
[he great thing is to be sure that we punish for the right 
things in the right way. The following four kinds of pun-  
-P-A-G-E-384
    i 
370 aeons METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
1 
ishment a bd fener (1) impulsive, or resentful, 
punishment; (2) retributive, or revengeful, punishment; 
(3) deterrent, or protective, punishment ; (4). educative, or 
reformatory, punishment. 
Impulsive, or resentful, punishment.—No small propor- 
tion of the punishment given children in the home, and, less 
often, in the school, is the result of unconsidered impulse, 
irritation or resentment. The parent or the teacher hap- 
pens to be tired and irritated by annoying difficulties met in 
the day’s work, and at an inopportune moment a child com- 
mits a fault. The punishment that follows is often calcu- 
lated to relieve the emotional tension of the one who does 
the correcting rather than to deal rationally with the fault 
itself. Witness the fact that a prank played by a child 
to-day may be taken as a joke, while to-morrow it may bring 
' sharp rebuke and punishment. It is hardly necessary to 
urge that punishment of this type is a mistake and a failure 
in the upbringing of a child, whether it be practised in the 
home or the school. The child easily understands that it is 
more the whim of the one in authority than the nature of 
the deed that determines the punishment, and so does not 
connect it with justice or the need of reform. The teacher 
should be very sure in administering punishment that the 
hidden motive back of it is not some emotional irritation of 
his own. 
Retributive, or revengeful, punishment.—The older idea 
of punishment was for revenge and retribution. If one did 
wrong, of course he must suffer in order that the one 
wronged might get even. An eye for an eye, and a tooth for 
a tooth. Suffering imposed must be paid for with an equal 
amount of suffering. Thus do the “blood feuds” among 
primitive peoples arise, and thus are they kept up. " Thus 
are the demands of a cruel and abstract “justice” satisfied. 
Such a concept of punishment has no place in the govern-
-P-A-G-E-385
CLASS-ROOM MANAGEMENT AND MORAL conpucT 371 
   
   
     
                                                   
       ment of a school. Individuals, large and small, will prob- 
ably long retain hidden deep in their natures a tendency to 
“pay back” one who wrongs them. But the larger control 
of the group over its members, or the control exercised by 
one higher in authority over one below him, should be above 
such motives and practises. 
Deterrent, or protective, punishment.—Much of the 
punishment inflicted by society upon its criminal members 
is for the purpose of deterring others from committing like 
offenses. No doubt many a person who is to-day living a 
reasonably moral life owes his allegiance to right paths to 
the fact that he fears to stray into forbidden ways because 
he knows punishment awaits him at the end of such a 
course. Thus society protects itself. 
Yet we must say that no person should be punished just 
that potential wrongdoers may have a lesson. The indi- 
vidual himself is the first concern. To inflict unjust or un- 
wise punishment on a pupil that the school may be warned 
is to wrong the one punished, and injustice never in the 
end teaches a lesson for good. Let the school learn its les- 
son from the punishment of offenders, but make sure that 
the offenders themselves.are reformed by punishments that 
are just and suitable. 
Educative, or reformatory, punishments.—The ideal of 
all punishment or correction is to enable the one punished 
to rise above the need for this kind of control. This is to 
say that all punishment should in the end be educative. It 
should result in a decreasing necessity for punishment. To 
do this it must develop in the child the power and will to 
overn his own conduct aright. 
Punishment to be educative should as far as possible grow 
ut of the wrong act as a natural result. This is but letting 
the deed return to the doer, and children can not learn too 
arly that what one sows he later must expect to reap. Nor
-P-A-G-E-386
  12 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
will the child fail to see the justice of such punishment and 
profit by it. 
The following incident illustrates the application of the 
educative principle of punishment: Frank was making 
ready to fill his ink-well from a larger bottle. The teacher 
suggested that he hold the two over the sink during the op- 
eration so that he might not endanger the new floor. Frank 
answered, “Oh! I can fill it without spilling a drop.” But 
alas! a great splash stained the floor. The teacher was at 
Frank’s side in a moment, all sympathy and kindness. She 
helped him clean up what they could, and offered no word 
of reproach. When they had finished their task a great 
black blot still remained. The teacher then said, “Frank, 
I think it will take a good mechanic to remove that stain. 
Suppose you stop in at Mr. Johnson’s shop on your way 
home and ask him to come and do the work. Also find out 
what he will charge, and arrange for the payment.” “Must 
I pay him?” asked Frank. “Why, who should pay him, if 
not you?” asked the teacher. “I’m afraid it will take all 
the money I’ve been saving for new skates,” wailed Frank. 
“I’m very sorry,” comforted the teacher, “but of course 
people must pay for damage they do to the property of 
others.” So Frank paid for the job, and received one of the 
most valuable lessons a boy can learn—that the deed comes 
back to the doer. 
It will not always be possible of course to make the pen- 
alty so accurately fit the act as in the case above. But the 
teacher who believes in making punishment educative will 
find many ways of allowing the punishment to consist of 
making good the damage, or making it impossible for fur- 
ther damage to occur. Noisy whisperers or unduly mischie- 
vous culprits should not “stay in at recess”; they should 
study in a separate room or distant corner by themselves un- 
til they are willing to become true members of their group.    
     
                                 
    
       
    
-P-A-G-E-387
CLASS-ROOM MANAGEMENT AND MORAL conDuUcT 373 
The lazy or inattentive child may have to stay after school 
to do his work. The careless child must repeat the poorly 
done lesson. The quarrelsome child may not be allowed 
to mingle with the others until he is willing to keep, the 
peace. The child who uses impure speech may be denied 
associations with others until he is willing to reform. 
Corporal punishment.—Shall corporal punishment be 
inflicted? Many teachers will unhesitatingly say no. Many 
school boards have wholly prohibited corporal punishment 
in their schools. The writer will not defend corporal pun- 
ishment. Yet he does not believe that it should be wholly 
prohibited (and the fact advertised) in the school any more 
than in the home. The fact that a whipping might follow 
some contemplated wrong act has kept more than one boy 
from its performance. 
Corporal punishment, if used at all, should come only 
as a last resort. To whip a boy for swearing, for lying, 
for stealing, will hardly reform him. Reformation in these 
deeply moral lines must arise from inner impulses, stimu- 
lated and encouraged by the wise tact and appeal of the 
teacher. Whipping for rebellion or disobedience should not 
be resorted to until more natural educative punishments 
have been tried. When corporal punishment is used, it 
should be sharp and severe enough that there will be no de- 
sire to have it repeated. 
Delayed punishments——Some teachers advocate de- 
laying punishment until the child has had time to consider 
the offense. This should not be carried too far, however. 
Many children are rendered so miserable by the worry 
over delayed punishment that they actually become ill. 
Probably only in cases of anger or stubborn rebellion is 
much to be gained by delay. 
Children should come to know that real offenses will 
surely be followed by punishment; that this punishment      
          
      
-P-A-G-E-388
  374 CLAS$-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
will be serious; that it will be just without fear or favor; 
that it will probably grow out of the offense and seek to 
compensate for it; that the teacher will be their friend while 
punishing, but that he will punish if necessary. 
Incentives 
Professor James. tells us that few men ever exert their 
full powers or use all the ability they possess. He speaks 
of’ “deeper levels” of power which it is our business as 
teachers to tap and set at work. To do this, we must use 
adequate incentives for the calling forth of effort and en- 
thusiasm. 
Competition as an incentive-—From childhood to old 
age every person responds to the impulse to “beat” some 
one else, whether it be in work, in play or in position and 
honors. Contrariwise, no one likes to be beaten, and we 
often find it easier to excel when we are “paced” by able 
competitors. These facts suggest the possibility of em- 
ploying the competitive impulse as a class-room incentive. 
It has been suggested earlier in the text how competitive 
games and exercises can be used to advantage in various 
studies. 
Competition should, however, be dual in its nature: not 
only should each pupil have an opportunity to compete 
with his neighbor, but also with his own record. The child 
who makes the largest percentage of improvement is more 
deserving of praise than the one who simply comes out 
ahead. For coming out ahead may only mean that the 
child springs from unusually good ancestry, and has not 
needed greatly to exert his native powers. But to show 
continuous improvement usually requires intelligent and 
earnest effort. 
The giving of prizes—The giving of prizes is fol-
-P-A-G-E-389
CLASS-ROOM MANAGEMENT AND MORAL coNnDUCT 375 
lowed less to-day than in former years, but is still largely 
in use in many schools. There are three grave objections 
to the giving of prizes to individuals: (1) the offer of 
the prize usually does not stimulate any considerable num- 
ber to compete for it; (2) it usually turns out to be a prize 
for good hereditary ability instead of for personal effort ; 
(3) it furnishes rather a low motive for effort and achieve- 
ment. ; 
A better type of prize is that offered by a small wéstern 
“school on the following plan: If the teacher is able at the 
end of the month to report a certain high grade of work 
and conduct for her room, the children and the teacher 
have the last afternoon of the month for a special holiday, 
with picnics, excursions and good times in general. But 
all must be up, and each is commissioned not only to see 
to his own record, but also to look out for any delinquent 
classmate who may seem to need assistance or warning. 
This is the best of training, for it cultivates a sense of per- 
sonal and social responsibility among the children. It also 
brings a powerful public sentiment to bear on every child. 
No one dares fail, for it would bring down the reproach 
and wrath of the whole school on him. This is a joint 
prize that all may help win. And it proves a fine incentive 
with nothing of the selfish about it. 
The Management of Examinations 
The management of examinations constitutes an impor- 
tant problem, even in the elementary school. 
The purpose of examinations.—Much harm has been 
lone in elementary schools by treating examinations: for 
rade children on so nearly the same basis as for pupils 
in the high school or college. That is to say that the ex- 
minations are used too much as a means of determining 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  376 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
“passing” and promotion, and too little as an instrument for 
teaching and learning. 
Children of all stages above the lowest grades need to 
be “examined” in the sense of being required now and then 
to organize what they have learned, and to test what they 
know and can do. The results of these examinations may 
be used to help the teacher decide concerning grade marks 
and promotions. But this is, for the grades at least, in- 
cidental and should not be allowed to interfere with the 
broader purpose of the examination. No teacher needs to 
give her pupils a formal examination to decide whether they 
are able to do the next higher work. Her best judgment on 
this point develops from her daily contact with the children 
in their classes. But every teacher can to great advantage 
employ the examination as a teaching device to compel care- 
ful reviewing and organizing of material. 
     
     
          
   
                  
   
     For these reasons examinations in the elementary school 
should come at convenient stages in the progress of a study, 
and not at stated intervals. The time to organize, review 
and fix a section of study is at its completion, and not when 
the calendar happens to show a certain date. True, a later 
examination may again give occasion to review and re-fix 
important material examined upon when the topic is com- 
pleted, but the stated examination date more often hinders 
than helps in arranging the best time schedule. In most 
subjects the examinations should probably come every four 
to eight weeks, depending on the completion of sections of 
the work, 
Exemption from examinations.—The custom is fol- 
lowed in so many schools of allowing those who reach a 
certain high daily average to be excused from examination 
that it seems ungracious to criticize it. Yet this practise 
has much to condemn it. First of all it classifies the ex-
-P-A-G-E-391
  
  CLASS-ROOM MANAGEMENT AND MORAL CONDUCT 377 
amination as a penalty, whereas it ought to be looked upon 
as a legitimate and necessary part of the school work. 
Again, many children who posseks a certain brightness and 
quickness, but who do not thoroughly understand or easily 
retain what they learn, may secure high daily marks and 
so escape the examination. But children of this type are 
the very ones who most need the review and reorganizing 
of material which comes from being examined. They 
should not be deprived of the best part of the work to be 
done upon their subjects. Far better reward those who 
have reached a certain grade in their studies, including the 
examinations, by giving them a holiday or excursion. 
Examinations and worry.—Examinations are used by 
some teachers as a kind of whip over the pupils in order to 
hold them up to their work. A child comes to class with the 
lesson unprepared, or he fails in some exercise of the reci- 
tation, and the teacher says, “Remember there is an exam- 
ination coming!” Now this would be all right for the sloth- 
ful and over-placid child. But he is not the one such a 
threat stirs. The response to the threat comes from the 
highly sensitive, timid or nervous child who has the ten- 
dency to worry. Why can we not get away from the tra- 
ditional view of examinations, take the unnecessary dread 
and fear out of them, and treat them on a common-sense 
and rational basis? Then we shall use them not as penalties 
but as opportunities. 
Grading, and utilizing examination marks. —Examina- 
tion papers should be carefully graded and the papers re- 
turned. The curiosity to know one’s grade is natural, and 
this curiosity should be utilized. The examination should 
supply the basis for a recitation following the return of 
the papers, and every question be fully discussed, its an- 
swers reviewed and errors and misunderstandings removed.  
-P-A-G-E-392
378 CLASS-ROOM METHOD AND MANAGEMENT 
Not to do this is to lose one of the best effects of the ex- 
amination. The plan followed in many schools of giving 
back only the grades, or giving the papers back only to have 
them thrown at once into the waste-basket without review, 
is unpardonable waste of opportunity. 
On the whole, teachers probably grade their examination 
papers too high. There is also a tendency not to make 
difference enough between the grades of the poorest and 
the best pupils. 
Examinations and honesty.—Our examination system 
undoubtedly has much to answer for in undermining the 
honesty of pupils. In some schools the examination periods 
are a battle of wits between the teacher, who is seeking to 
prevent dishonesty, and certain pupils, who are seeking to 
secure credit to which they are not entitled. It is not meant 
that all children are dishonest in their examinations. But 
enough are to make the problem involved constitute one 
of the gravest moral questions in our present school ad- 
ministration. No child can grow up through a system where 
he constantly sees or practises small evasions, bright tricks 
and petty thefts without having his conscience in some de- 
gree weakened and his moral sense dulled. The moral 
qualities of the class room carry over to matters outside 
the school. 
The teacher can guard the honesty of pupils in examina- 
tions in at least three different ways: (1) He can remove 
unnecessary temptations by so arranging that pupils sitting 
adjacent to one another are not writing on the same ques- 
tions. He can maintain such oversight (without spying) 
that the grosser forms of cheating can not be practised. 
This can all be done without casting reflections on the hon- 
esty of the pupils, the explanation being given that the 
arrangements are for the purpose of making it easy to be 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
    CLASS-ROOM MANAGEMENT AND MORAL CONDUCT 379 
honest and fair. (2) The teacher can appeal to the hon- 
esty, loyalty and better nature of his pupils. This may not 
secure response from all, but will form a very large pro- 
portion if the appeal is tactfully made. (3) The teacher 
can provide questions and exercises of such nature for the 
examination that opportunities to use surreptitious mate- 
rial are largely eliminated. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1, Try making a list of ten leading qualities of character, as 
honesty, loyalty, etc. Then estimate the degree to which these are 
being cultivated in your class room. / 
2. Think over the misdemeanors that have been most annoying 
in your school. Under which of the two classes mentioned in the 
chapter do most of them come? Is the distinction clear in the minds 
of your pupils? 
3. Should the confession of a wrong deed lessen the punish- 
ment? Do you try for confessions, rather than to start with accusa-_ 
tions? Have you tried making the school feel responsibility for 
misdeeds of offenders among their number? Do you think this will 
work if the spirit of the school is not good? 
4. Try making a list of the different school incentives you are 
employing. Of others that might well be used. Do you see a way 
by which you might offer a “universal” prize as an incentive? 
5. Do you make your examinations serve as an instrument for 
teaching and learning, or chiefly as a basis for promotions? Do 
your examinations lead to gheating? Do you make good use of the 
answers written by the pupils as the basis for further instruction? 
Do you make the questions so that they will require a review of 
the important things rather than small technicalities? Do your 
pupils dread the examinations?

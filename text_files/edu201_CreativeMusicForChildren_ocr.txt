Dear Sirs: 
I thank you for the opportunity to look over the 
proof of Mrs. Coleman’s Creative Music for Child- 
ren. I spent several hours on it, and it is a book I 
should like to study particularly. I would like to 
see the author’s pupils at work although the photo- 
graphs you sent, which I think ought to be included 
in the book,’ give one an excellent idea of how the 
system actually works out in practice. 
IT have been a life-long advocate of the view that 
the development and therefore the training of the 
child should recapitulate that of the race, and I 
know no better embodiment of this idea than that 
which Mrs. Coleman appears to have found in 
music. The combination of manual training in the 
actual manufacture of primitive instruments, with

  their use, and the development of rhythm, dancing, 
which is a kind of musical gesticulation, and the use 
of the voice, give the scheme the needed breadth 
and solidity of basis on which more special and 
technical training could be more securely developed, 
and also must greatly increase appreciation of 
music for the average child. 
Mrs. Coleman has certainly shown what I deem 
a quite unprecedented insight into the musical 
nature and capacities of children but no less inge- 
nuity in the modes of developing these capacities. 
Her book should be read not only by all music 
teachers but by parents, and I hail it as marking 
something of an epoch in musical pedagogy. 
Sincerely yours, - 
G. Stanley Hall.

  PREFACE 
Tuts book has been prepared especially for those 
mothers and teachers who have written to me for 
help in their work with young children. It is not 
for those who have geniuses to train—for genius 
makes demands and finds ways peculiarly its own— 
but for those who wish to give all children more 
vital, more fundamental, and more joyous experi- 
ences in their early musical training; for any who 
may be interested in the musical training of chil- 
dren, and for all those who wish to see music make a 
more effectual contribution to character building, 
home life, and society. 
My first appeal to teachers in behalf of the child 
appeared in the Musical Observer for September, 
1917. Two years later a monograph on “Primi- 
tive Music for Primitive People—a new view of 
music for children,” gave a general statement of the 
principles underlying the work which forms 
the subject matter of this book. In June, 1920, 
two articles, one in Musical America, and one in 
vii 
   
-P-A-G-E-12
   
  viii Preface 
  Good Housekeeping, were written by visitors to my 
studio, and these articles resulted in so many 
letters from mothers and teachers in all parts of 
the United States who were perplexed by problems 
similar to mine, that a book seemed the inevitable 
answer to them. 
After my studio experiments had proved to me 
and to others that musical training in its broad 
sense, including the making and playing of instru- 
ments, was practicable, educative, and joy-giving 
in small groups of children, my next wish was to 
try out the plan with large classes to ascertain the 
practicability of bringing these stimulating activi- 
ties into the lives of public school children. So in 
the autumn of 1919 I began an experiment in the 
Lincoln School of Teachers College, applying my 
studio experiment to large classes, and the results, 
so far, have been gratifying. A full report of this 
newer experiment will be given later for the benefit 
of those teachers who may be interested in the idea 
as applied to school conditions. The scope of this 
book, however, is confined to its application in the 
studio and in the home. 
To Miss Emily Barnes I am indebted for the 
specific name of my work. After observing the 
   
-P-A-G-E-13

experinient in my studio and in the school, she 
thought the name “Creative Music”’ an appropri- 
ate one to cover all phases of the work in con- 
struction of Musical Instruments, Creation of 
Music and Poetry, Playing, Singing, and Dancing, 
and it is in this sense that I have used the term 
throughout the book. I am also indebted to Miss 
Lida Lee Tall and to Miss Helen Norfleet for sug- 
gestions in the revision of the manuscript. 
I would add a word in appreciation of Mr. R. E. 
O’Neill’s interpretation of the spirit of my work 
in the charming picture he has drawn for the lining 
of the book.

CHAPTER I 
MUSIC LESSONS OR MUSICAL TRAINING ? 
Tue human interest in music is as old as the race, 
and the use of it as a recreative and stimulative, as 
well as a soothing agent, antedates history. The 
Chinese, Hindus, and other oriental peoples long 
ago recognized its influence on the mind and on 
human conduct, and Confucius went so far as to 
claim that he could tell whether or not a nation was 
well governed merely by hearing its music. ¥ The 
ancient Greeks defined the different effects of 
different kinds of music, and recognizing its value 
in the education of their youth, gave it an impor- 
tant place in the school curriculum. But in the 
various upheavals through which our civilization 
has passed since then, music has been allowed to fall 
from its earlier high estate. Although the church 
has preserved its religious aspect and our own in- 
stincts have preserved its recreational meaning, we 
have, until recently, overlooked its educational 
value. 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  4 Music Lessons or Musical Training? 
Just now we are groping our way to a better 
understanding of the significance of music in the 
training of the young, but we are still without 
conviction. We cannot ignore the fact that music 
is growing to be one of the strongest forces of our’ 
society, and as a people, we enjoy and encourage it. 
The shelves of our libraries are heavy with books 
about music and musical training, pleas for the 
propagation of good music, learned discussions of 
masterpieces and theories, popular treatises on 
music-appreciation, expositions of methods, and 
analyses of music,—scientific, spiritual and artistic. 
During the past decade the floodgates seem to 
have been opened and music of varying degrees of 
worth has deluged the public. Some of us have 
absorbed the good and the beautiful; some the 
unbeautiful; and many of us are wondering how 
this great force is to be controlled and its beneficent 
power conserved. We do know that it is toward 
the children that our efforts must be directed, but 
the minds of most of us are not quite clear as to 
how music may best contribute to the development 
of our children. 
In these days nearly everyone believes in some 
“kind of musical training, though occasionally one 
does find a parent who thinks it a useless waste of 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
   Music Lessons or Musical Training? 5 
time. However, when such an attitude is met, it is 
usually due to lack of information on matters of 
education, or it is the result of former unsatis- 
factory experiences. A mother once said, “I 
studied music for several years, but I have nothing 
to show for it and I cannot play a tune to-day. 
Why should my children repeat that waste of time 
and nervous energy? Life is too short’; and her 
inference was right. A disappointed father once 
said, ‘CYes, I am going to sell the piano. I spent 
thousands of dollars in order that my daughter 
should learn to play, and I had visions of sitting 
by the fire in the evenings while she played to me 
all those old things I love so well. But my money 
was wasted and my effort availed nothing. She 
never opens the piano, and when I ask her to play 
for me she says, ‘I can’t play a thing.” No more 
music lessons in my family.” A nervous woman 
once said, “I cannot bear to hear the children 
practice. It makes me positively ill. Perhaps it 
is because I live over experiences in my own child- 
hood. When I was a child I had lessons on the 
violin. It was very difficult for me, and my teacher 
used to get very cross and often gave me a sharp 
pencil-whack across my fingers when I didn’t hold 
them properly or played the wrong note. My!
-P-A-G-E-26
6 Music Lessons or Musical Training ? 
how it hurt! I can feel it yet! And somehow, 
since then, I have always hated violin music.” 
In spite of the discouraging effect of many 
experiences similar to these, there are few enlight- 
ened parents who do not try to give their children 
some form of musical training, and many think it 
important enough to make great sacrifices to that 
end. On the other hand, there are still those who 
look upon musical ability as a special gift, and 
think that none but the talented need pursue the 
study. I have been interested to note how widely 
parents’ ideas differ as to the special gains to be 
derived from the study of music. Some parents, 
without any definite object in view, or without 
knowing why they wish it, just want their children 
to be able “to play.”” Some want to give them all 
the advantages the age provides, saying, perhaps, 
“T never had the chance when I was young; I want 
to give my children all those advantages that I 
missed.”” Some parents see in the study of music a 
mental stimulant; others a vocation and means of 
livelihood. In some cases the main thought is to, 
keep the children busy after school hours, or to 
provide them with a pleasurable and smnidiena 
pastime and larger resources for self entertainment. 
To many, the final goal is “music appreciation” Be ~y
-P-A-G-E-27
Music Lessons or Musical Training? 7 
and the ability to enjoy good music; and there are 
those who study music merely to broaden their 
appreciation of art in general. Some wish most for 
music in the home, for the enjoyment of family and 
friends, and some parents arrange for lessons 
merely to gratify the wish of the child. There are 
others who consider the greatest value of musical 
training to be its refining power in the cultivation of 
the emotions and tastes, while still others look to it 
mainly for help in muscular coérdination and 
physical poise. 
More of us than have realized it, perhaps, have 
been interested in music as an accomplishment—an 
ornament—something to make our children more 
attractive socially. It may have been the wish to 
make her daughters welcome in larger social circles 
and to give them a wider field for selection in the 
choice of husbands that led the mother of a few 
generations ago to urge musical training upon her 
daughters, rather than upon her sons, for the sons 
had more direct ways of attaining to marriage. 
Fifty years ago few American parents considered 
music lessons for the boy unless he showed unusual 
talent; but often great sacrifices were made that the 
daughter should be able to play a few “company 
pieces” at the piano. Unfortunate results have
-P-A-G-E-28
  8 Music Lessons or Musical Training? 
come about from this general attitude towards 
musical training as an accomplishment—something 
to affect one’s social life. But it is easy to see how 
this attitude has been encouraged, for on the face 
of it the ability to make music 7s an accomplish- 
ment that has, from earliest times, made one more 
welcome among his fellows; and it is right, of 
course, to encourage it from the pleasure-giving 
side. 
The child very easily catches the spirit that 
moves his parents to give him lessons. His atti- 
tude towards music is established in the beginning 
of his musical education and it is very hard to 
change it. If he feels that his social popularity 
depends in any measure upon his musical ability, 
it is inevitable that jealousies shall arise; for it is 
only natural that he should wish to feel power over 
others, and therefore he resents whatever weakens 
that power, especially if it is a rival personality. 
The jealousies among singers and players in the 
social and professional world are well known and 
seem to me an inevitable result of the attitude we 
have held toward musical training. It has been 
so easy to use music as a means to gain the atten- 
tion and applause of others; its very nature lends 
itself to the “showing off” propensity in children,

and many adults, too, have no stronger motive 
behind their daily practice than the wish for public 
applause. The adulation of the individual artist 
in a public performance, rather than the pure 
enjoyment of the music itself, is an exaggerated 
result of this attitude, and the view of the audience, 
in its turn, feeds anew the perverted motive. It is 
much easier to let this tendency of music run along 
the open road of ego-gratification in our training 
than to guide it through paths of more wholesome 
development. But we must find those paths. 
For the desire to produce effects on other people is 
strong enough in us all to need no extra stimulation, 
and when the subtle power of music is thrown in 
that direction, the result is a disastrous over- 
balancing. 
Musical training has extraordinary educational 
value, but so long as we are interested in music 
as an accomplishment only, and so long as the 
motivating power behind musical study is the wish 
to impress others, we shall never realize its greatest 
value. 
But what about the outcome for that vast num- 
ber of people whose purpose is not superficial 
ornamentation, but who wish their children to be 
musical, with all the wholesome results that come 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  10 Music Lessons or Musical Training? 
from being so? Have we realizea our hopes? 
Have we and our children had “music lessons”’ or 
musical training? And are we, as a_ people, 
musical? 
To be musical is to feel and enjoy music—to 
have the impulse that results in habits of playing 
and improvisation—and to enjoy one’s own music 
and that of others for the sake of the music itself. 
The Australian Bushman is musical. Travelers 
say that the Bushman sits alone for hours ata 
time listening to the sound of his gora, without 
being concerned about anything but the succession 
of tones which he brings out of it for his own pleas- 
ure. Most primitive peoples are musical, and the 
music employed by them is a necessity of life. The 
primitive people in our midst, the children, are 
musical in the beginning (more so than some of us 
think) but this tendency does not always survive 
their training, and perhaps no one will claim that 
“grown up” America is truly musical. The ne- 
groes in the South are (or were) musical. They 
came from Africa with rich, musical voices, a 
natural capacity for melody and harmony and a 
tendency to musical production. Out of their 
natural gifts has come the most beautiful folk-song 
literature America has. The sorrows that civili-
-P-A-G-E-33
  Music Lessons or Musical Training? 11 
zation has forced upon the negro in removing him 
from his African home have doubtless had a part 
in the development of his music, but it is certainly 
not the result of any training that our civilization 
has given him. 
We believe that we love music, but as a rule we 
do not love it enough to take the trouble to make it, 
and most of our home music at present is “repro- 
duced” and not “home-made.”’ Do we, as families, 
love to gather together in the evenings and sing and 
play, as really musical peoples do? (I wonder if 
many of us realize just how far that custom goes 
toward making children musical?) Compare our 
habits with those of musical European countries. 
Do our young people show enthusiasm over singing 
clubs and musical gatherings? Do we, after all our 
training, appreciate and encourage the best music? 
Has our training given us all a taste for truly beauti- 
ful music? Does it “harmonize the souls” of 
those who pursue it, as the Greeks found it did, 
and does it make us kinder and more just in our 
relations to others? And does it, as the ancient 
Chinese believed, bring us poise and self control? 
Has the study of music proved a good investment 
of time and money? Does it really bring us 
happiness and content? We have reason to expect
-P-A-G-E-34
  12 Music Lessons or Musical Training? 
all these things in some measure, and if we have 
been disappointed, if we are not musical, never , 
“know anything to play,” if “bought” music is 
the only kind that thrives, if we grow nervous 
and irritable in the study of it, and envy someone 
who plays or sings better‘.if it has not helped us to 
recognize and enjoy beauty or to express some form 
of beauty that is within us, if it has not helped to 
make our lives move in better adjustment to the 
“rhythmic beat of Nature,’”—the fault lies not in 
the art, but in the use that we and those before us 
have made of it.

CHAPTER II 
EARLY HERESIES OF THE WRITER 
Former Innovations Concerning Notation, Singing, 
and Dancing 
Ir we feel a lack in what music has done for us, 
there are probably two main causes for that lack. 
Our musical training in the past and present is, of: 
the two, the more responsible, and may even lie 
at the root of that other contributing cause,—our 
customs and attitude, as a people, toward ‘music. 
My feeling that something was wrong in the way 
music was taught—to me, at least—really began 
at the age of eight. I vividly remember the day I 
was to have my first music lesson, my eager antici- 
pation and thrills of joy to think I was going to 
learn to play the piano! Soon I would understand 
that mysterious array of black and white keys, and 
be able to manipulate them in a “really truly” 
tune! At last the hour came and I sat on the piano 
stool and the teacher sat beside me. Then she 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
LL Te Pee eI mM NRE eT Se TER 
14 Early Heresies of the Writer 
opened a book and put it in front of me. The page 
did not read: “Put your finger on this key and 
play Yankee Doodle,” as I half expected, but 
instead, there was a picture like a fence, with many 
black spots on it. She said it was a staff, and 
began telling me various things about it. My 
interest in this staff was only momentary, and then 
I went back to the thing Ihad come for. “I want 
to learn to play,” I ventured. “All right, my 
dear; this is the way to learn to play. You must 
first learn to read these notes, and then you can 
play them on the piano.” Then followed explana- 
tions and drill on the letter names. ‘When the 
note is in this place, you must strike this key,” and 
by going through a most intricate mental process, 
the teacher allowed me to strike an occasional key. 
But where was the tune? And what did the 
lines and spots in the book have to do with music, 
anyway? I wanted to play the piano, not study 
queer marks ina book. My fingers ached to make 
a tune that sounded “pretty,” or to play some of 
the little songs I already knew how to sing; but she 
would neither show me how nor let me try. The 
disappointment was bitter. But my longing to 
play was so great that I was willing to pay any 
price, so I accepted the terms—hard though they
-P-A-G-E-37
Early Heresies of the Writer 15 
were—and finally learned the notes. I remember 
being greatly discouraged and nervous over the 
complicated feat of trying to hold my hands in the 
right position, decipher the note’s place on the staff, 
figure out its time value and strike the right key, 
all at the same time; and when it came to managing 
two hands and puzzling over two staffs at the same 
time, it was indeed a trial! My only incentive 
and comfort lay in the hope that, finally, music 
would come out of all this mental strain and 
nervous tension. 
After a time I found great pleasure in picking 
out tunes by ear and harmonizing them to suit my 
own fancy, but that was soon prohibited. My 
teacher gave directions that I was not to be allowed 
to “play by ear” at all, as it would ruin my note 
playing, and her instructions were carried out. I 
felt the deprivation very keenly, but it chanced that 
after the first year, my lessons were discontinued 
for a few years, and I was free to do as I liked at the 
piano. So I played by ear and improvised to my 
heart’s content; read notes, too, and grew, all 
unaided, in musical feeling and understanding. 
In after years it was the memory of my childish 
disappointment and instinctive feeling that led me 
to try the plan of teaching children to play the 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
    16 Early Heresies of the Writer 
piano by ear—entirely without notation. The 
memory of how I had naturally improvised, and 
an analysis of my childish mental operations ‘in 
harmonizing melodies, were my guides in teaching 
improvisation at the piano. 
Ten years ago my experiments with children had 
already proved that they could be taught to play 
the piano without the help of printed notes, and 
that they loved to do it. It all seemed so natural 
and reasonable. Does not a child learn to speak 
his language before he learns to read it, and shall 
he not say musical things, with his fingers as well 
as with his voice, before he reads them? Herbert 
Spencer reminded us years ago that the thing 
should be taught before the symbol of it—that 
experience should come before knowledge—but we 
have been slow to realize how ruthlessly we have 
broken that educational principle in our music 
teaching. We have overlooked the original and 
true purpose of notation, and have confused the 
symbol with the thing symbolized. It was a true 
instinct that made me, as a child, feel disappoint- 
ment in my teacher, perhaps as much as if she had 
told me a picture of my mother was the real 
mother. 
It is not surprising that so many children hate

their music lessons. The thing that interests them 
is the playing—the sounds they make. If that 
activity is blocked by something of no interest in 
itself they quite naturally become bored; if coer- 
cion is used in note reading routine, they usually 
come to hate it; and since this mountain of 
difficulty lies between them and the thing they 
want, they give it up as being undesirable at that 
price. I believe it is a great mistake to deal with 
music in a disciplinary manner, forcing children 
to practice. Musicvis going to affect us emotion- 
ally. The delicately organized child will not be 
indifferent to it—he will either love it or hate it— 
and forcing him into it without his wish will either 
make him hate it, or make him irritable towards 
those who urge it. 
Many children, enthusiastic at first, lose their 
ardor in the dreary process of learning to read 
notes, and give it up before they ever taste the joys 
of real musical expression. Many others, more 
persevering, settle down to cold mechanical playing 
because the natural feeling cannot break through 
the wall of conscious technicalities which their train- 
ing involves. The opportunity for free expression 
must be given, and the habit cultivated from the 
very first, unfettered by new or complicated 
2

processes, mental or physical, if one is ever to 
realize the meaning of free musical expression. 
Few habits are harder to break than that of 
constraint. 
“One mental process at a time,” says the modern 
educator. When we think of the mental processes 
and simultaneous muscular feats required in teach- 
ing the use of an unfamiliar keyboard or group of 
strings by means of an unfamiliar system of signs, 
manipulated by unpracticed and uncodrdinated 
muscles, we are appalled! (Let a “grown-up” who 
knows neither notation nor the use of an instru- 
ment, try it with either violin or piano.) The 
wonder is that any children survive with a love for 
music. And perhaps none would, were it not for 
the great inborn desire to make music. This is 
merely a proof of the power of music over us, and 
the greatness of the human need and longing for 
musical expression. 
One modern educator (M. E. Boole in Prep- 
aration of the Child for Science) says: “I believe 
that hardly any mistake in education is more 
disturbing to normal brain action, more likely to 
induce nerve-storms in delicate children, or more 
dangerous to future brain power in all children, 
than the attempt to convey a new idea by means of
-P-A-G-E-41
Early Heresies of the Writer 19 
a process still artificial (7. e., inadequately codrdi- 
nated) or to teach a new process by means of an 
idea still unfamiliar.” The observation of children 
becoming nervous and irritable at the piano or 
violin probably lies within the experience of most 
of us. “When the process of learning by the more 
direct means has become so familiar as to be per- 
formed sub-consciously,” then and only then 
should the more complicated processes begin. 
Another educator (H. S. Jennings, in his Biology 
of Children in Relation to Education) states that, 
“Training is even harmful when it comes earlier 
than the development of the power which it tries 
to train; it must then be classed with the blights 
which cut off the development of the powers. 
This driving of the powers too far leads to 
most serious difficulties—nervousness, twitching 
of the face, etc. Strain makes men hate their 
work.” 
How, then, are we to eliminate this strain in the 
child’s playing? How can we teach him to play 
without note reading? 
He learns to speak his mother tongue by rote, or 
imitation; he learns to sing by rote; birds teach 
their little ones to sing by rote; all young animals 
learn by imitation; why shouldn’t the child’s first 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
gui ia i a iia ac Mh a pl a 
20 Early Heresies of the Writer 
playing be by rote? Why not deliberately employ 
the child’s natural way of learning until the physi- 
cal process becomes easy? Very soon, as his ear 
and his mentality develop, he can follow a more 
intellectual process and play by ear. 
But playing a melody by ear presupposes that 
the child knows the melody. Therefore before a 
child can play by ear, he must first sing. The only 
way he can really possess a melody is by singing 
it, and his singing may begin as soon as he begins 
to talk, or even before. There is no strain in a 
child’s learning to sing songs that are suited to his 
age. 
From the beginning, he must sing and play 
rhythmically. But to do so, he must feel the 
rhythm of what he is playing, and the feeling for 
rhythm must come through the body. Reasoning 
thus, I saw the necessity of adopting dancing also 
as a part of the child’s musical training, for 
_ rhythmical playing depends upon bodily response 
torhythm. Some form of dancing it must be, not 
eesthetic or social dancing, but something suited to 
his age and development; something that will 
cultivate his rhythmic sense at his own level, and 
make him free to express it. Most folk dances are 
too difficult for very small children, but some of
-P-A-G-E-43
ee ne te cen ene etn 
Early Heresies of the Writer 21 
the simple dances of primitive peoples give excel- 
lent material for these little folks. 
Some singing, some dancing, and some playing, 
seemed to me to be the proper formula for a child’s 
music lesson; but for very young children (I had 
some pupils of three and four years of age) it was 
singing and dancing only, for my cue in the instru- 
mental phase of the work was to wait until the 
child wanted to play, and voluntarily sought that 
means of expression. 
The results were very gratifying. Children who 
had been baffled by the printed page found it easy 
and delightful to play the piano by rote and by 
ear, and to improvise, with nothing but the key- 
board to think of. Children who had never sung 
in their lives, delighted in singing folk songs and 
improvising little songs of their own, and they 
all reveled in the rollicking dances of childish 
primitive peoples. 
And what about notation? I gave it to them 
when, out of their own experience, they realized 
a need for learning to read notes, wanted it, and 
asked for it. Then it was easy. 
After a time, however, a problem arose: A few 
children wanted to play whose hands were too small 
and too weak to get any real satisfaction at the

piano. They wanted to play real tunes and yet 
their fingers were not ready for it. For a long 
time I had believed that children did not seek 
knowledge or any kind of training until they were 
mentally and physically ready for it, but here were 
some apparent exceptions. Why did these chil- 
dren have the impulse to play and insist on playing 
before they could manipulate one finger without 
all the others getting in the way? Drums and 
other time-beating instruments which they had 
used did not answer—they wanted to play tunes. 
I was greatly puzzled.

CHAPTER III 
THE STORY OF AN IDEA 
Tue solution of my problem came most unexpect- 
edly. At the suggestion of friends, I give below 
an exact account of the train of thought which led 
to that solution. 
One morning in the midst of spring house- 
cleaning, I dropped into a chair to rest for a 
moment and gather strength for a fresh attack. 
Things were piled about the room, and within reach 
of my hand was one of those long old-fashioned 
minstrel banjos, leaning against a chair. I lifted 
it to my lap and idly twanged the strings. There 
is something very appealing in the sound of gut 
strings stretched over parchment—something at 
once a lament and happy abandon—and when one 
can add to that sound a few childhood memories 
of Old Uncle Joe and the other darkies on Saturday 
evenings in a sunnier clime than this, the banjo 
claims a place of affectionate regard. 
The monotonous chords soon worked a charm 
23 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  24 The Story of an Idea 
and I was surprised to see how quickly my aching 
fatigue disappeared. It had been quite a common 
habit for me to “rest myself” from physical fatigue 
by playing the piano, but I had never experienced 
such a quick restoration as this. ‘What is it in 
this instrument,” I wondered, “that gives it so 
much power? Is it the peculiar tone quality, or 
what is it?” 
Its magic was well known to Old Uncle Joe: 
“Run yonder, honey, and shoo dem chickens 
outen de do’, fo’ dey gits into Melindy’s clabber! 
I’se dat tired I couldn’t budge offen dis bench ef de 
house wuz on fiah; dat I couldn’t. Deze ole laigs 
is followed dat mule and de plow near ’bout twenty 
mile to-day, and him de beatenes’ mule, de con- 
traries’ mule in de whole creation! Dat he is. 
No, honey, I aint gwine a’ move from here, dat I 
ain’t.” 
And all the time he was ringing out a pinky- 
panky banjo accompaniment to his excuses. Soon 
his banjo was “warmed up,” as he called it, and in 
less than five minutes he was “‘kickin’ de backstep”’ 
and “cuttin’ de pigeon wing” to his own banjo 
playing—a feat which must be attempted before 
one can realize the physical exertion it requires. 
No wonder the darkey loves his banjo if the twang-
-P-A-G-E-47
  
The Story of an Idea 25 
ing of its strings can so quickly “spirit” away 
the leg-heaviness that comes from following a 
contrary mule all day! 
“What is it,’ I questioned, “‘in this instrument 
that strikes so deeply and clings so tenaciously to 
the very roots of his nature? And why is it that, as 
I sit here stroking these strings, I am even more 
soothed than by piano playing, though I play the 
piano better, and have played it many years 
longer? Perhaps my position has something to do 
with it? No, my piano chair is just as comfortable 
as this, and my left arm is less relaxed than it is at 
the piano, so it can’t be my position. Neither can 
this lively tune be responsible. Can it be the fact 
that I am holding the instrument so close to my 
body that my nerves take up the vibrations more 
perfectly, having contact with the vibrating instru- 
ment at the waist, both thighs and wrists and the 
fingers, as well as the sound waves through the ear? 
Surely that must have something to do with it. 
Then, there must be a difference between striking 
a string indirectly by means of a hammer, and 
striking it directly with your fingers. To feel with 
your fingers, a string vibrating in response to your 
own physical touch, gives a far greater pleasure 
than the use of a mechanism ever so perfectly

devised for striking strings. You have produced a 
tone that is more truly your own. And so it seems 
to me that one who plucks the strings with one’s 
fingers, will feel a closer intimacy with the instru- 
ment than one whose stroke must pass through a 
o. series of mechanical devices before the sound is 
made. 
“That’s it! It’s the intimacy of the thing! No 
keys, no hammers, sockets, or pins. Only the 
string, my fingers, and a resonating body beneath 
them! A direct touch and an instantaneous 
response! If that is the secret, then the banjo is 
not the only instrument that has the magic charm. 
““Ah, yes, I have another childhood memory of 
how my older brother used to sit and play his 
guitar by the hour in the evening ‘just resting 
himself’ after working hard on the farm all day. 
He didn’t know much about it—had picked up a 
few chords, a Spanish Fandango and one or two 
other little things—and not until this moment have 
I ever appreciated his point of view when he 
declined to study piano, for he loved the piano, and 
I had implored him to let me teach him what I 
knew. But he remained content to play his small   
guitar repertoire over and over again every evening. 
In those days I rather pitied his poor musical taste,
-P-A-G-E-49
The Story of an Idea 27 
and felt that he did not really appreciate my 
revered instrument nor his opportunity to learn it. 
But now I see that his taste was wholesome and 
natural, and I respect his judgment in adopting 
an instrument that gave him the greatest return for 
the time he had to spend upon it.” 
Then there came to my mind the picture of the 
Austrian peasant who sits by the fire in the evening 
and plays his zither—another simple instrument 
with no mechanism between the strings and the 
player. Nearly every mountain peasant has some 
form of zither in his home, and can play it. “Per- 
haps,” I thought, “‘that is why the Austrians are a 
more musical people than we are—because their 
peasants have instruments that are simple enough 
for everybody in the family to play without having 
to ‘take lessons.’ For that matter, most European 
peoples have some sort of simple stringed instru- 
ment for the leisure hours of the ‘landfolk’; an 
instrument cheap enough for every family to own 
one, and simple enough for anyone in the family to 
play by ear, if he only has a little patience. 
«What is our ‘simple strings’ for the land folk? 
The negro with his banjo is the only answer I know. 
When we came over (for we all came over from 
somewhere) did we leave all our peasant instru-
-P-A-G-E-50
yn, & bel icy ei. ae ae ical ia aa Ae aaa ala 2 Noa A a pee al i cad 
28 The Story of an Idea 
ments behind? And are the negroes more musical 
than the rest of us Americans because they and 
their African ancestors have made a freer use of 
simple instruments? 
“The simplest form of zither has no frets, anda 
separate string for each note, even simpler than the 
guitar or banjo; no wonder the peasants of Austria 
and other European countries could play their 
simple folk songs so easily upon it. No doubt 
many children started picking out tunes so early 
a that they scarcely remember when or how they 
Pe learned to play. There’s an idea! I will let my 
. little folks play the zither! Several of them whose 
hands are too small and too weak for the piano are 
longing to make music of some kind with their 
hands, and they really could pluck, one at a time, 
the strings of the zither. 
“Plucked strings and a string for each note, 
lying flat on a table or in the lap. Why haven’t I 
thought of it before? Could any instrument be 
simpler for children to play? Yes, there was the 
Greek lyre, perhaps the simplest of all forms of 
plucked strings. The logical thing would be for 
me to start my children with the lyre! If I could 
only get one! But alas! there are none to be had. 
Why, I'll make one and let my little ones play on 
‘
-P-A-G-E-51
  The Story of an Idea 29 
that! First of all, the lyre, the simplest form of all 
stringed instruments! But wait! Even that is 
not the beginning!” 
Then, as in a vision, a complete picture flashed 
before me, and I saw my little pupils going back 
for their first music not to the Greeks, but much, 
much further back, even to primitive man and the 
early savages. ‘‘They shall build up their own 
art and experience the development of music from 
the beginning,” I said to myself. “Being little 
savages, they can understand savage music. I 
shall find the child’s own savage level, and lift him 
gradually up to higher forms; and he shall under- 
stand each stage as he reaches it, for his power will 
grow with it, and his work will always be at his 
own:level. The natural evolution of music shall be 
my guide in leading the child from the simple to the 
complex; and we, with guidance, may probably 
often discover and cover in one lesson things that 
required generations for man, without guidance, to 
learn. 
“Primitive man made his own instruments, and 
so shall we make many of ours, too! How children 
will love making them! And of course any child 
will love to play on an instrument he has made! 
“We shall study and make all types of instru- 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  30 The Story of an Idea 
ments—wind, string, percussion, and what not! 
Everything that a primitive savage can do in 
music, children can do. They shall find out how 
the art of music was evolved and by their own 
creative work they shall experience its most impor- 
tant stages. How can it fail to cultivate the musical 
instinct, and build up musical power and under- 
standing! Why have we all this time been trying 
to bridge over this enormous field of music? And 
such a beautiful and interesting field it is, too! 
_ “Beginning at the drum stage, my children shall 
be little savages who know nothing of music, and 
they shall dance primitive dances and beat upon 
rude drums and shake rude rattles until they 
discover some way of making tone. Song, too, we 
will follow from the simplest beginnings through 
the course of its evolution, and correlate our 
singing with our playing. My little savages 
shall play their simple tunes upon pipes of Pan 
until they find out the principle of the flute; 
they shall play upon the resonanceless shoulder 
harps of the Egyptians until they discover how 
resonance can be obtained for strings; they shall 
play upon bells and gongs and musical stones and 
strips of wood, and blow horns and bugles. They 
shall play upon the lyre and primitive harp until
-P-A-G-E-53
      The Story of an Idea 31 
they discover how one string can be made to play 
more than one note; they shall make and play upon 
primitive fiddles and lutes and banjos! Their 
singing and dancing and playing shall evolve 
together, until finally they are able to select the 
instruments that appeal most to them, and each 
child will then give special attention to his chosen 
instrument. Perhaps it will not be the piano at 
all! 
“How ridiculous it now seems that all these 
years we have been confronting a child with the 
most complicated instrument man has yet evolved, 
and have expected him to use it, without giving him 
any of the steps that lead up toit! And how unjust 
that the verdict of ‘unmusical’ has been passed 
upon so many children unable to cope with this 
difficult medium! Many of the musical giants 
of Europe lived before the piano even existed! 
And I know that most of those great ones played 
every instrument that was used in their time. 
The art of music is as old as mankind itself! And 
yet in our day we have, as a rule, begun our 
instrumental instruction with an _ instrument 
invented in the eighteenth century, or else with 
the violin, the most difficult of all modern instru- 
ments! Is it any wonder that we have failed to 
    
-P-A-G-E-54
  32 The Story of an Idea 
make of ourselves a really musical people? That 
we have failed to strike ‘rock bottom’ with our 
training? All the Symphony concerts and musical 
lectures and lessons in the world cannot take the 
place of development in the foundational principles 
of music and living experiences in them. How sad 
it seems that all this rich field of musical instru- 
ments and their development should have been 
of interest heretofore only to collectors and history 
students! What an opportunity the educator has 
lost! To the musical educator more than to 
anyone else these things have a message of vital 
importance. {If a child lives the art of music from 
its primitive beginnings, makes his own instru- 
/ments and plays upon them, and discovers for 
himself each stage in the development of musical 
instruments, how can he help being musical?” 
An undertaking was before me: To bring the 
whole history of music within reach of the child, 
and make it practicable for him to live through it; 
to concentrate, eliminate, and simplify; to find out 
how to make and how to use all these instruments; 
and to arrange a course suited for children’s hands 
and minds that would give them the actual experi- 
ences of developing a complete art of music in a 
way that would awaken and refine their musical

powers and taste and still not consume too much 
time out of the full curriculum of the modern 
child’s life. Before me were endless study and 
research, experiments with children in the field of 
primitive music and in music’s later development, 
trying out, sifting, testing, exploring my own way 
through an untried forest of hundreds, yea, thou- 
sands of years’ growth, guided only by a strong 
belief that here lay the material that would satisfy 
the child’s natural craving to make music, that 
would give him great happiness and at the same 
time develop his musical sense and his musical un- 
derstanding from the very foundations,—through 
his own personal experience. Furthermore, I be- 
lieved that his whole life would be vastly en- 
riched, that his intelligence in other lines would be 
brought into use and woven into this; that the ele- 
mental forces of his nature would be so exercised 
in investigation and experiment, and in creative 
work of both hands and mind, that his character 
and entire personality and mental habits would 
be developed and strengthened, and the musical 
returns would be only a small part of his gain. 
Stimulated by the vision of all this for children, 
the undertaking—however great the problem and 
however arduous the task—seemed worth trying.

The research and experiments that followed have 
finally resulted in a definite plan for foundational 
work in music for children. It is my purpose to 
give in the following pages a résumé of a three 
years’ experiment in my studio, with as much 
detail as the size of this volume will allow.

THE CREATIVE MUSIC EXPERIMENT 
35

-P-A-G-E-59
INTRODUCTION 
Tue experiment proper began in October, 1918, 
after a summer of preliminary experiments with 
several children from three to six years of age. 
Previous to that, I had worked my way alone 
through the constructive side of the plan as out- 
lined in the preceding pages. Two children, one 
five and a half, and the other seven and a half 
years of age, were the first to begin the process of 
study according to my new plan, but others of 
ages varying from three to nine years were soon 
included. The lesson period was one hour. Some 
of the children came four times a week and others 
twice a week: After the first year, Saturday class 
lessons were organized to give them greater 
opportunities in ensemble work. 
For convenience in relating the story of my 
experiment I shall divide the work into its several 
parts, devoting different chapters to different 
activities; but it must be borne in mind that all of 
these phases were developed simultaneously and 
37 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
38 Introduction 
were closely correlated. So far as was practicable, 
each lesson touched upon every phase of the work, 
though sometimes a child would spend the entire 
hour on one thing, unwilling to leave it, especially 
if he were making an instrument. The younger 
the child, the greater was the variety of activities 
employed in his lesson, not only because he had so 
much to learn, but also because he was less able to 
concentrate steadily on any one thing. But since 
he had to sing and dance, make instruments and 
/ play them, acquire other knowledge related to 
these things, form habits and develop skill in many 
lines, one hour seemed all too short, even for the 
very young child, and it usually passed before 
either he or I realized it. 
In a logical outline, giving my work in the order 
of its presentation to children, dancing and singing 
would be placed first. Those phases of musical 
training, however, have been ably developed by 
others, and in this work the greatest experimental 
aspect of those phases is the correlation of them 
with other phases of musical training. In relating 
the story of my experiment I am giving first that 
part which is more truly an experiment in the sense 
that it is an exploration in an untried field.

CHAPTER IV 
HOW THE CHILDREN MADE THEIR INSTRUMENTS 
Tue description of that phase of the work which 
has to do with the construction and use of 
instruments must also be divided, for the sake of 
easier presentation, into the three general sections, 
percussion, wind, and stringed instruments. Here 
again it must not be inferred that we finished one 
type before taking up another. I tried out 
instruments in various orders with different chil- 
dren, because I believed that the child’s age and 
natural musical tendencies should be important 
considerations in selecting the order of his instru- 
ments. For example, although we used percussion 
instruments first of all, as primitive peoples do, 
nearly all my younger pupils used very simple 
stringed instruments at the same time they were 
playing on those of the percussion type, and before 
they had been introduced to wind instruments at 
all. Simplicity was the main factor in arranging 
the order for the child rather than a list of types, 
39 5 3
-P-A-G-E-62
40 How Children Made Instruments 
or the historical sequence of development. All of 
my pupils continued to use percussion instruments 
after they were playing both wind and stringed 
instruments, and the three types were not isolated 
one from the other. 
When children came to me too young to be 
interested in the “whys” of things and too young 
to handle tools in the making of instruments, I 
made no attempt to have them follow the experi- 
ments here outlined, which were carried out by 
children from five to nine years of age. ‘The 
younger children played upon all the instruments 
in the order of their degree of difficulty without 
any thought of how they were made—merely 
acquiring musical experiences—and later took up 
the making of them. 
PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS 
The Drum Stage.—Since all children, whether 
they seem to be musical or not, love to beat some- 
thing and make a noise, this tendency presented 
itself as one means of developing the rhythmic 
sense. After having the child use his hands and 
feet in the making of rhythmic sounds, my next 
step was to stimulate his curiosity about the kinds 
*
-P-A-G-E-63
   How Children Made Instruments 41 
of sounds that were produced when different 
surfaces were struck, leading from flat surfaces to 
the resonant sound of concave and hollow bodies. I 
had procured for my studio an imitation hollow 
stump made from a tree section (see Fig. 5) and a 
hollow log, and the children were interested in the 
sound produced by striking these. As drums were 
already within their experience, they naturally 
thought of drums, and each child wanted one. The 
suggestion that they might be able to make drums 
was received with delight, and no stimulation of 
interest was needed. The discussion of what we 
would use to make them, and how we would make 
them, aroused their curiosity and led to the investi- 
gation of what primitive and other people had 
used to make drums, and what available material 
there was for us. Pictures and a trip to the 
museum gave them definite ideas. We found that 
many things could be used of which we had never 
thought in this connection. One child made a 
ketile-drum from a chopping bowl, another from a 
‘. cocoanut shell; a spice box proved the right size for 
a tabor, which is really a small drum. We used 
gourds, butter tubs, and even stone bowls from the 
kitchen. Very pretty barrel drums were made 
from birch bark, and also from kegs. Our greatest
-P-A-G-E-64

42 How Children Made Instruments 
problem was to find the vibrating membrane to 
stretch across the body of the drum. (at first we 
. procured pieces of real drum skin from a music 
store, but we found that we could make cloth 
answer very well by using aviator’s linen, covered 
with a coat of shellac. The children were very 
impatient to use their new drums, and could hardly 
wait until they were finished. They used them in 
beating song and dance rhythms, in echoing the 
rhythms of melodies played by others, and in 
improvising rhythms. They were interested in 
the drum codes of savages, and made drum codes 
of their own. 
A wooden pencil box with a marble in it brought 
forth the suggestion that a kind of drum could be 
made with the noise produced inside. We found 
some gourds with long handles, and by putting a 
few hard pebbles inside them and closing them up 
again, we made some very fine rattles. The chil- 
_-dren used these rattlesforrhythms by shaking them. 
The spice box, which one child had used to make a 
tabor, had a cover with a rim about an inch wide. 
A little boy found this cover which had been dis- 
carded, and the circular rim offered such tempting 
possibilities that he soon conceived the idea of / 
making a tambourine. All it needed was a wet

How Children Made Instruments 43 
sheep skin stretched across the rim and fastened 
all around with thumb tacks. Just for fun, he 
tied a few tiny sleigh bells to the rim to make a 
metallic sound like the real tambourine. 
By this time the children had had some experi- 
ence in tone as well as rhythm, and had evolved 
the beginnings of melody in their singing, so they 
were ready for tone experiences in their playing. 
I told them about the musical stones of the ancient 
Chinese, and they tried to find sound in stone. 
The nearest approach to musical stones which I 
could find was a resonant piece of metal, so we next 
investigated the sound of metal when struck. 
Three metal bars, which I had previously had 
made for me—tuned to whole step intervals— 
constituted our first real instrument with definite 
tone, and had all the scope that was required to 
play the primitive three-note songs which they had 
by this time learned to sing. (Some of these songs 
will be found in Chapter VII.) 
The musical quality of the metal suggested bells 
to the minds of the children, and this led to experi- 
ments with all the bells we could find. We inquired 
into the reasons for the different tones of different 
bells and drew conclusions as to the effect of their 
size on the sound of bells, and also as to the tonal 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
44 How Children Made Instruments 
effect of length in the case of the metal bars. We 
found in our varied collection three bells whose 
tones were a whole step apart, and on these they 
also played the three-note songs they knew. We 
discussed bells and church chimes and I told them 
afew bell stories. Someone thought of sleigh bells 
and they were produced and examined. I had a 
bell-maker make for me a set of sleigh bells tuned 
to the diatonic scale and also a set of Swiss bells 
without clappers. At this stage we could use the 
first three notes of each set. We discussed the 
difference in the way the tone was produced in the 
three metal instruments—bars, Swiss bells, and 
sleigh bells. I found in a music store a Turkish 
tubaphone, which was also of great interest as 
showing another way in which metal could be used 
to make tones, and the children played their 
melodies on this new instrument. 
It was at about this stage that one of the children 
brought me a musical instrument of her own 
invention. It consisted of three silver spoons of dif- 
ferent sizes, suspended with strings from a wooden 
rod; by striking them, she played a melody. 
The children were now singing songs that 
involved the pentatonic scale, sometimes called 
the Chinese scale. I had a set of accurately tuned
-P-A-G-E-67
   How Children Made Instruments 45 
Chinese gongs made and arranged on a rod so the 
children could play the pentatonic melodies they 
knew. I had foreseen that they would wish to 
play their different instruments together, so the 
metal instruments were all pitched in the same key. 
The children use soft rubber hammers to play 
all of the above instruments (except the sleigh 
bells, which have to be shaken). This requires no 
finger action, but a free movement of the entire 
arm, which can easily be controlled by a small child. 
\vWarimba.—Following the experiments with 
metal tones, the children developed a wooden 
instrument of the marimba type. They were led 
to discover that wood could be made to yield tone, 
and that different pieces of wood differed in tone 
quality and pitch. Experiments followed, showing 
that the tone of a piece of wood was affected both 
by its length and by its thickness, and with a little 
sawdust the children found the nodal points of the 
bars of wood. ‘These discoveries enabled them to 
plan a definite instrument of three notes, to tune 
the_wooden bars in unison with the metal bars, and 
to set this new instrument up in proper form to use 
in our gradually enlarging orchestra. With a lit- 
tle wooden hammer each child played a three-note 
melody on the instrument he had made. To have
-P-A-G-E-68
  46 How Children Made Instruments 
made an instrument producing different tones—one 
on which he could play a real tune, and one he 
could use in our orchestra—seemed too good to be 
true! The scope of the instrument made by each 
child varied according to his age and development. 
The youngest children made those of three notes, 
and some of the older ones extended the scale to 
six, eight, and twelve notes. 
Glasses—One day we were experimenting with 
the tones of different objects by striking everything 
we could find. We discovered that some drinking 
glasses gave clear, bell-like sounds. We also found 
by experiment that we could alter the tones of 
these by putting water in the glasses. This gave us 
an idea. We took three ordinary drinking glasses, 
put different quantities of water in them, and by 
regulating the amount of water, found that we could 
tune them to our three-note scale and, by merely 
striking the side of the glass with a pencil or stick, 
‘we could play our three-note melodies on them. 
We found that the glasses sounded better when they 
rested on thick cloth instead of directly on the wood 
of the table, and the children also decided that 
they liked the tone of the glass better when the 
striking hammer was either made of very soft 
pine or covered with felt. They were very en-

How Children Made Instruments 47 
thusiastic over the glasses and soon had a set of five 
tuned to the pentatonic scale, and were playing 
their pentatonic melodies on them. Later they 
- tuned a glass for the fourth step of the diatonic 
scale (which they were now using in their songs) 
and found endless delight in playing their little folk- 
song melodies on this six-note glass instrument. 
The six glasses looked very much alike. It 
S<qwould be easier for us, we thought, if we could 
find some way of distinguishing them quickly as we 
played, so we decided to mark the first and the 
fourth glass, making number one red and number 
four blue by putting red and blue ink in the water. 
(This was suggested to me by the coloring of harp 
strings, the c’s being red and the f’s blue.) This 
coloring gave the glasses another attraction, espe- 
cially for very young children. 
The silvery tinkle of the glasses when struck 
with felt-covered hammers is indeed most pleas- 
ing to the ear. For more than three years they 
have been in daily use in my studio, and without 
exception, the children of all ages have loved them. 
Since the tonal capacity of a glassis only afewnotes, 
one is limited to a small range unless the glasses 
themselves, without water, differ greatly in tone, 
and for that reason I had much difficulty in obtain- 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
Pe ee Ee ene Te a ee mE TT ee MTT TE EE Cate Oe Ee nna oP 
48 How Children Made Instruments 
ing a wide range of pitch in my glasses. But 
by long continued searching in the stores, I was 
able to arrange a set of three octaves. 
I found the glasses especially well suited to our 
first ensemble efforts, for when two or more sets 
were tuned alike, there was not much difference of 
tone quality to disturb the children. Later they 
played “trios” in the three different octaves with- 
out any difficulty, and after that it was easy to 
combine the different instruments, bells, bars, 
glasses, drums, and marimbas. 
The experiments in the studio seemed to stimu- 
late the children to make investigations of their 
own accord, and they often brought to me instru- 
ments of their own contriving. One day, after 
the children had learned to play on the glasses, a 
tiny boy of five urged me to go to his house and see 
an instrument he had made. I went home with 
him and he proudly exhibited three large bottles of 
water (any one of which was too heavy for him to 
bring to the studio), which he had tuned fairly 
well, and beaming with pleasure, he played the 
Bear Song for me. He had not only made the 
instrument, but the idea too was his own (so 
far as he was concerned). 
Vibrating Rods—We had in the studio a set of
-P-A-G-E-73
  6. Chinese Gongs
-P-A-G-E-74

-P-A-G-E-75
  How Children Made Instruments 49 
small metal rods of different lengths, fitted at one 
end into a metal stand. When these rods were 
struck with a small wooden hammer, their vibra- 
‘tions made pleasing musical sounds that varied in 
pitch according to the length of the rod. As these 
rods had been tuned to diatonic scale intervals, 
they constituted for the children another instru- 
ment for the playing of their simple folk songs. 
One day Florence brought to me with great pride 
a musical instrument of her own discovery which 
was neither a wind, stringed, nor percussion instru- 
ment. It was a large thorny cactus plant which 
grew in a pot in her mother’s window. She had 
discovered that the long thorns on it would vibrate 
and make musical sounds when she flipped them; 
also that their tones were not all alike. By care- 
fully trying them out she had found three thorns that 
approximated the first three tones of the scale and 
she proudly played for me a real melody on the cac- 
tus plant! What better proof that the world—even 
the barren western prairie—is rich in musical possi- 
bilities if we only have eyes to see and ears to hear! 
WIND INSTRUMENTS 
In the beginning of my research, the subject of 
wind instruments for children had presented a 
4  
-P-A-G-E-76
  50 How Children Made Instruments 
baffling front. Tin horns and penny whistles 
seemed at first to be the only available material 
suited to their use. I had thought of willow 
whistles, such as my brothers used to make, but 
they were practicable only in the springtime. 
What I most wanted was a reed that children could 
use to make pipes of Pan. Bamboo canes, such 
as are used for fishing rods, occurred to me, but I 
found the openings so small and the reeds so hard 
to cut that the bamboo seemed hardly practicable 
for children. So day after day I searched the woods 
‘and lowlands. I found a tall jointed rush that 
gave a clear note when one blew across it, but the 
rushes shriveled quickly and were useless in a few 
days after pulling them. All hollow grasses 
seemed quite unsuited. I tried elder branches but 
the pith was too hard to get out. Corn stalks, 
wheat straw, sorghum, all had their disadvantages. 
Finally my search was rewarded, and I found a 
reed that Pan himself could not have improved 
upon. The plant is called the Japanese fleece 
flower, and will grow in both dry and damp places. 
The shrub comes up in the spring and by late 
summer the stems are full grown, and hollow, 
except at the joints. They vary from the tiniest 
tubes to an inch and a half in diameter. They are 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  
How Children Made Instruments 51 
easily cut, both when green and dry, and if per- 
fectly dry when tuned, they will stay in approxi- 
mate tune for years. The finding of this plant was 
the solution of more than one problem. I discov- 
ered that many kinds of wind instruments could be 
made of it, not only pipes of Pan, but trumpets, 
shepherd’s pipes, flutes, clarinets, tches, and neys. 
Pipes of Pan.—Those children who took up the 
study of wind instruments in the fall went with 
me to see the plants and to cut the dried stems from 
where they had grown. We cut the reed into 
pieces, leaving a joint at one end of each piece. — 
The children discovered how a tone could be made 
(by blowing directly across the open end), and they 
also found by experiment that the tone of the pipe 
was affected by its length, but not very much by 
its diameter. So they cut long pipes for the low 
tones and shorter ones for the higher tones, and did 
not stop until each child had tuned a set of three 
pipes. Then they marched proudly home, piping 
Hot Cross Buns all the way. 
Throughout the work I have given the children 
stories and musical legends at the time when their 
own experiences were in some way similar to those 
inthestory. At this time the story of Pan and the 
first musical pipes was vivid and real to them.
-P-A-G-E-78

52. How Children Made Instruments 
After having learned how to tune the pipes to 
three tones, it was, of course, easy for them to 
enlarge their instrument by adding other tones of 
the scale, according to the range of the songs which 
they could play. One day a child discovered that 
water in a pipe had the same effect as making the 
pipe shorter. This led to trying other experi- 
- ments, and the children found that one could easily 
tune the pipes or raise the pitch by putting sand or 
rice in them. They were interested to know that 
some savages had tuned their pipes with dried 
peas... For convenience in holding the pipes, we 
tied them together (see Fig. 9), and in blowing, 
I had the children hold them with the lowest. note 
to the left. In fact, all their instruments were 
arranged in that position so that later when they 
should reach modern instruments with keyboards, 
their sense of the lateral direction of low and high 
notes would be already established. I have been 
interested to observe that as a rule children seem 
to get a tone from the pipes of Pan more easily 
than adults who have never blown an instrument. 
Just as they had experimented before by striking 
things, the children now tried blowing everything 
that could be blown at all, and their experiments 
revealed many facts. They blew across bottles  
-P-A-G-E-79
          How Children Made Instruments 53 
and found that the tone of a bottle as a wind instru- 
ment could be changed by putting water in it; so 
they made a set of “‘bottle pipes of Pan” and played 
upon it. It was interesting to discover that water 
in the bottle lowered the tone produced by percus- 
sion, but raised the tone produced by blowing. 
The older children were very curious about the 
reason for this. They loved the deep tone that 
came from blowing across the mouth of a jug, and 
they experimented with jugs of different sizes. 
Even the clock key was found to possess a musical 
tone, and the long valve cup of an automobile tire 
was a very good pipe of Pan. 
Trumpets.—It was easy to blow things that 
were open at only one end, but what about reeds 
and other things that were open at both ends? Was 
there any way to get music out of them? We fi- 
nally made the discovery that by letting the lips 
flutter together inside one end of the reed we 
could produce a musical sound. A little practice 
soon brought out a fine trumpet-tone. We selected 
our largest reeds, and with a slender stick pushed 
out the pith at all the joints. We discovered that 
the tone of the trumpet depended on the length of 
the reed, and we could regulate it to some extent by 
cutting off the reed. We made three trumpets,
-P-A-G-E-80
  54 How Children Made Instruments 
tuned a step apart, and three children, each with a 
trumpet, could play a three-note tune, each child 
bringing in his note when it was needed in the tune. 
This was great fun, and led to combining more 
children with more notes. The impulse now seemed 
to be to make trumpets of everything we could 
find, and soon we had a cow horn trumpet, several 
shapes of gourd trumpets, cardboard mailing tubes, 
rolls of paper, rubber hose, a brass tube, and what 
not, all producing musical tones. The children 
enjoyed comparing the tones of these as to pitch 
and quality, and the older ones identified the pitch 
of each one at the piano. 
One boy expressed the wish to play more than 
one tone on his trumpet, and that was the signal 
for a further experiment that resulted in a trumpet 
capable of yielding several tones. The delight of the 
child was great, and he trumpeted his three- and 
four-notemelodies with much gusto. Wefound that 
it took a steady and controlled breath pressure to 
keep the tone even andtrue. This gave us the idea 
of timing ourselves to see how long we could sustain 
an unwavering tone. Several children acquired in 
a short time sufficient breath control to sustain a 
tone for twenty-five to thirty seconds. 
Someone went to the seashore and brought back 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
    How Children Made Instruments 55 
several long Triton sea shells. I told the children 
of the uses that primitive peoples had made of sea 
shells, and they were eager to make trumpets of 
these and try the sounds. We bored a hole in the 
side of one (see Fig. 16), and in another the apex 
was cut off to make the hole. They had tones that 
were lovely but rather loud for a city studio, and 
lest we should disturb other people, we did not use 
them as much as we would have liked todo. Once 
we had an opportunity to play them in the country, 
and it was an exhilarating experience. 
Gourds grow in many fantastic shapes and make 
delightful trumpets. Some that we made were 
veritable shofars like those of ancient Hebrew 
ritual, and had clear ringing tones. We also made 
birch-bark trumpets that were interesting both to 
make and to use. 
The Shepherd’s pipe is another reed instrument 
in which, by the use of holes, several tones can be 
made on one reed. The tone is generated, not by 
blowing across it, or by fluttering the lips, but by 
blowing directly into a whistle mouthpiece at one 
end of the reed. In the case of the dry reeds which 
we used, the mouthpiece was fitted into the reed, 
and was made much as the mouthpiece of the 
willow whistles or elder whistles which boys make 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  56 How Children Made Instruments 
in the springtime. I found that small children 
could not use a knife well enough to make a whistle 
mouthpiece, but if made by an older child, they 
could play on these pipes very well. 
Flageolets—I also found some very good metal 
pipes of French make which the children could 
play quite easily. They are the same as shepherd’s 
pipes except that they are made of metal. In 
order that the children might experience melody- 
playing in the very beginning, and gradually 
acquire the finger technic of the flageolet, I had 
them use at first only the two upper holes of the 
instrument. Two fingers down produced No. 1; 
one finger down produced No. 2; all the holes open 
produced No. 3; and thus by using two fingers they 
could play three-note melodies. These tones are 
meant to be numbers 5, 6, and 7 of the scale of 
the instrument, but serve equally well, as 1, 2, 
and 8 in another key; and little hands that could 
not manipulate six finger-holes could easily manage 
two, and complete an accurate melody. In a sur- 
prisingly short time even the very small children 
learned to manipulate all six holes with ease, 
and to coérdinate their blowing with their finger 
movements. 
It was with the flageolet that I tried my first
-P-A-G-E-83
  How Children Made Instruments 57 
experiments in having the children codrdinate foot 
movements with their own melody playing, for the 
flageolet was so easily carried about. At first they 
marched and played at the same time. The older 
ones played skipping tunes and skipped at the same 
time, and some of them found that they could 
control their muscular movements well enough to 
play the flageolet with one hand, the drum with the 
other, and march at the same time. Little Eliza- 
beth, aged six, was impressed by an account of the 
pipers in the days of Merrie England, who danced 
from village to village playing both pipe and 
tabor; and fired by her own curiosity to see if it 
could be done, worked it out alone and was soon 
skipping away to 3% pulse, playing a melody of 
sustained tones in the same pulse on her flageolet 
with her breath and left hand, and at the same time 
beating the accents on the tabor with her right 
hand,—a well adjusted triple coérdination. 
Ocarina.—Any child who has played the flageo- 
let will be able to play the‘ocarina (a simple primi- 
tive instrument made of clay) without difficulty. 
The principle involved is the same as that 
employed by the boy who blows a note through his 
hands held in a cupped position to his mouth. As 
in the case of the flageolet, the smaller children 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  58 How Children Made Instruments 
started with the higher notes, requiring the use of 
fewer fingers, for the lowest note on the ocarina is 
the hardest of all for children to make. The oca- 
rina is a fascinating instrument when well played. 
and even small children soon learn to use it well. 
It is made in several sizes, the smaller ones, of 
course, being better for children. It is especially 
suitable for playing bird songs. I use the high G 
ocarina for most bird songs, but the low G gives 
a remarkably true imitation of the dove’s song and 
other low-toned bird songs. 
Oboe.—Our experiments with oat and wheat 
straws led to the discovery of the principle of the 
double reed. By flattening the end of the straw 
and blowing through it, the two sides vibrated 
together and produced a tone. Holes in the straw, 
burned with a hot wire, enabled us to get sev- 
eral tones. A paper drinking straw from the soda 
fountain made an excellent hautboy, a double reed 
instrument, the ancestor of our modern oboe. 
An interesting double reed instrument which any 
child can make and play upon in the summer is a 
squash-leaf oboe. Our summer experiments with 
this gave us much pleasure. To make this, the leaf 
with its stem is cut from the plant, leaving the hol- 
low stem intact. Then at the leaf end a slit about 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  How Childien Made Instruments 59 
an inch long is made in the stem. By inserting 
this entirely in the mouth and blowing through it, 
the two slit surfaces are made to vibrate together, 
creating a reedy sound. A hole about one eighth 
of the length of the stem from the big end will 
produce a tone about a whole step above the 
fundamental. Another hole at nearly the same 
distance, and a third hole about half that distance 
from the second, should complete the first four 
tones of the diatonic major scale. Several squash- 
leaf stems can be cut until they will produce like 
tones, and they can then be used to make an 
interesting squash-leaf ensemble. If kept in water 
when not in use, these instruments will last for a 
few days. It is best to be satisfied with three or 
four tones, for it is difficult to make the higher 
tones of the scale,;come true. 
Another one of our summer experiments was the 
Petunia-blossom oboe. We removed the pistil from 
the flower, put two pinholes in the side of the tube, 
and by blowing through it the children could play 
three-note melodies. This delicate little instru- 
ment gave out tones that both surprised and 
delighted them. 
We also made a single beating reed instrument 
from a wheat straw—a primitive Clarinet. Holes 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  60 How Children Made Iastruments 
in the straw enabled us to make several notes. 
Another primitive clarinet was made of a piece of 
wood hollowed out like a tiny trough with one end 
cut off. A thin piece of wood cut the shape of a 
clarinet reed was fitted over this and the thick end © 
of the reed tied to the trough near its open end. 
This has been called an Indian Squaller.’ 
Chinese Tche.—We found that a hole made in the 
middle of a straight open reed enabled us to get a 
pure tone by blowing directly across it. In experi- 
menting with holes near the two ends of the reed, 
we discovered how we could make very satisfactory 
tones of the major scale. This kind of instrument 
was long ago made by the Chinese, but is now 
obsolete. The home-made ones, however, are 
interesting, easy to make and not difficult to play. 
The Egyptian Ney is another obsolete instrument 
which we resurrected. It is a straight reed open at 
both ends, and is blown across the top, somewhat 
like the pipes of Pan. It has a little notch cut in 
the end across which the breath is directed, and 
this notch divides the column of air that produces 
the tone. It is the only case I know in which a 
tone can be produced in an open reed without any 
kind of mouthpiece. Holes in the side of this 
t The author is indebted to Mr. L. A. Herr for this instrument. 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
      How Children Made Instruments 61 
reed give the different tones. This instrument was 
interesting as an experiment, but it was rather 
difficult for many of the children to get the air 
column directed exactly right for playing it. 
 Cornstalk fife.—One day I found a piece of corn- 
stalk about ten inches long and one half inch in 
diameter, and brought it to the studio. It was 
soon converted into a fife. We ran a hot wire 
through it to burn out the pith, closed one end 
with paraffin, burned a hole near the closed end for 
blowing, and two others near the other end, and in 
a very short time the children were playing a three- 
note melody on this little bit of cornstalk. 
Flutes—The flute proper is a transverse instru- 
ment with the embouchure (hole for blowing) near 
the closed end. The fife and piccolo belong to the 
flute family. Our primitive reed flutes were made 
of large reeds about twenty to thirty inches long. 
We selected very straight ones and pushed out the 
pith from the inside joints, and closed one end 
with a cork. The holes we burned in the reed gave 
us an embouchure and finger holes by means of 
which we could, after a little practice, produce 
our simple melodies in soft, flute-like tones. 
Their experiences with these reed instruments 
gave the children an interest in all kinds of flutes, 
    
-P-A-G-E-88
   
      62 How Children Made Instruments 
and some of them solved the problems of the 
Chinese flute (employing the whole-tone scale) 
sufficiently to play a few melodies on it. The six- 
keyed flute was by this time easy for them to 
understand and to play, as was also the six-keyed 
piccolo. 
This led, naturally, to an interest in the flutes of 
our modern orchestra, and to an investigation of 
the Boehm flute with its improved system of keys. 
Experience with flutes of the old kind made them 
realize the reason for this mechanism and appreci- 
ate it. Before the end of the third year of this 
work, two children of the group had already 
selected the flute as their chosen instrument, 
having had large experience in all types of 
instruments. 
STRINGED INSTRUMENTS 
The simplest stringed instrument is, perhaps, a 
hunter’s bow. 'To make a bow and arrow and listen 
for the sound of the string as the arrow was shot, 
was our first work in strings. Then we found a 
thin board like a barrel stave, fastened a string to 
one end, bored a hole in the other end, and fitted a 
pegintoit. The free end of the string was fastened 
to the peg so that the string could be tightened by
-P-A-G-E-89
  How Children Made Instruments 63 
turning the peg. We called this a tension bow, 
because it gave us an opportunity to observe the 
effects of tension on the tone of the string. The 
children discovered that the greater the tension of 
the string the higher the pitch of the tone. 
Primitive Harps.—It seemed to me that the next 
step in the development of stringed instruments for 
the children should be a curved are frame, strong 
enough to hold its shape while two or three strings 
of different lengths were stretched across it. With 
this I wanted to give the children an opportunity 
to observe the difference in pitch of strings of differ- 
ent lengths—using strings of the same size-and 
approximately the same tension, The great prob- 
lem was to find something curved and strong 
enough to hold its curve against the inward pull of 
three strings. This problem had caused much 
puzzling when I first planned these experiments 
until I suddenly thought of the rim of a wagon 
wheel. At once I explored a wheel factory and 
found that the circular rim (or feller) was in two 
pieces, and was made of very strong hard wood, 
steamed and bent by machinery into a curve that 
was as strong and inflexible as one could wish. 
One semicircular feller split in two made two harp 
frames. We strung these with three cotton cords

-P-A-G-E-90
      
    64 How Children Made Instruments 
and tuned them to 1, 2, and 3 of the scale, observing 
that about the same tension for each produced the 
different notes, the difference being made by the 
length of the strings. This instrument turned 
out to be a veritable shoulder harp like that of the 
ancient Egyptians, for the children discovered that 
the most satisfactory way of holding it was on the 
left shoulder, with the right hand free to play it. 
When played on the shoulder they could aiso hear 
it better, the tones of the cotton cords being very 
soft. It seems that the Egyptians often used their 
harps on the shoulder with the same object ‘in 
view—that is, to hear their own playing. 
A folding coat hanger of wood furnished us the 
frame for a triangle harp, and showed very clearly 
the effect of the length of strings. All of the 
strings were of the same size, but all of different 
lengths. In this case I used a violin E string, 
the tone of which the children liked better than 
the twine cords of the shoulder harp. 
The habit of inquiring into the musical possi- 
bilities of different things was shown when one of , 
the children brought into the studio a wish-bone 
from her dinner table. Of course, a harp was the 
instrument it was best fitted for. We stretched a 
narrow rubber band several times across it, pulled

How Children Made Instruments 65 
it into tune, and in a few minutes a melody was 
played upon this tiny wish-bone harp. This gave 
the children an idea*for something larger, and one 
of them brought to the studio several small tree 
branches that were forked and had the same shape 
as the wish-bone. By stretching several rubber 
bands across them, they produced larger and more 
satisfactory “wish-bone” harps. 
The next step was to make an instrument with 
strings of different sizes. For this the wheel factory 
again served us, and the strong wooden rim used for 
an automobile wheel made an excellent frame for 
a Theban harp (see Figure 25). For this instrument 
we used eight real harp strings, and tuned them to 
the diatonic scale. The children enjoyed looking 
at pictures of Egyptian harp players and experi- 
mented with different ways of holding the harp. 
The position shown in Figure 25 is the one they 
found most comfortable for playing. 
In experimenting for position, one little girl of 
eight years who was sitting on the floor with the 
harp, made an important discovery. She rested 
one arm of the harp on the floor while she played, 
and her eyes opened wide as she heard the sound 
of the strings very much intensified. Then she 
turned the harp over and touched both arms of 
s
-P-A-G-E-94

66 How Children Made Instruments 
it to the floor and the sound was even louder! 
“Oh, listen! How wonderful!” she exclaimed; and 
everybody had to try it. Then of course she 
wanted to brace the arms of the harp against 
everything in the room while she played to see if 
some other surprising thing would happen. She 
tried it against tiling, glass, windows, stone, 
curtains, plaster wall, mirror, piano, door panels, 
and tables. She liked it best against the door, or 
touching the piano. It seemed that flat wood made 
thestringssoundlouder. Then we discussed the way 
in which the wood took up the vibrations of the 
strings, vibrated with them, and so made the sound 
louder. And thusthey discovered the principle of the 
sounding board. They held the harp flat against the 
door panel to play it, and then someone had an idea. 
“Let us make an instrument with a big flat board 
under the strings and fastened there to stay!” 
“A good idea; we'll try it.” 
Chinese Kin.—A thin flat board six by twelve 
inches long was soon found. The board served 
as a frame to hold the strings and we also put the 
peg holes in the same board. But the strings 
rattled against the board and made a disagreeable 
sound. How could that be remedied? Then we 
found that by putting a long narrow strip under the  
-P-A-G-E-95
How Children Made Instruments 67 
strings at both top and bottom, the strings were 
lifted from the board and were free to vibrate 
between the strips. Thus the children had reached 
the stage of bridges in the development of stringed 
instruments. And what should they call this 
instrument they had made? In reality they had 
made an instrument of the same type as the 
Chinese kin: strings stretched across wood, lifted 
by bridges. So we called it a Chinese kin, and 
decided to tune it to the Chinese scale and play and 
improvise pentatonic melodies onit. At this point 
a few Chinese musical legends were told to the 
children. 
The Lyre—The development of the lyre began 
with the myth about Mercury and the first lyre. 
After much searching I had acquired a tortoise 
shell with the upper and lower shells still holding 
firmly together. First, for sanitary reasons, I var- 
nished it inside and out, and then stretched a rubber 
band across the inside. The children could easily 
imagine how interested Mercury must have been in 
the sound of the dried ligaments. We saw pictures 
of tortoise shell lyres, and also the real ones in the 
Museum. Wehad anextra shell which I had found 
in the fish market, so we, too, could make a lyre. 
To the children the new thing about the lyre was 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
68 How Children Made Instruments 
that the sound intensifier was to be a concave body 
instead of a flat surface. We saw that many of the 
early lyres in the Museum had skin stretched across 
the concave bodies with the strings passing over 
the skins. We wished to try that, so we made a 
four-stringed tortoise shell lyre and with it studied 
the Greek tetrachords, and improvised four-note 
melodies. 
If a concave surface was a good resonator, 
wouldn’t a box be equally good? To find out, we 
made a box lyre. For this we used a cigar box, 
with a hole in its cover and a strong frame around 
the box. On this lyre we used wire strings and the 
children found that their tones were louder than 
those of the other strings we had used. 
Greek lyre-—When studying the lyre we were 
greatly interested in the Greeks, and in many of 
their stories. We had seen so many pictures of 
beautifully curved lyres that we longed for one of 
classic design. I did not feel that these children 
were, as yet, sufficiently experienced in the use 
of tools to make the thing they wanted, so I drew a 
design, a composite picture of many shapes of 
lyres, and had an instrument maker try it out. 
Alterations in the dimensions were made in several 
succeeding lyres, until finally one resulted which 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
How Children Made Instruments 69 
was quite satisfactory, and the lyres made after 
this pattern have been a source of great pleasure to 
the children of all ages in my studio for these three 
years. They are strung with eleven strings and the 
children play upon them almost all the songs they 
sing. Often their first harmony experiments are 
made upon the lyre, and they begin their study 
and use of chords on this instrument. It is not 
surprising that the Greeks loved the lyre. It is 
simple enough for the smallest children who come 
to my studio (as young as three years of age) and 
pleasing enough to interest the oldest ones as well. 
Although this classic lyre is more pleasing to the 
eye, the home-made box lyre is very satisfactory, 
and I see no reason why any boy or girl who can 
use tools should not have one of these simple 
home-made instruments. 
Several children at different times, and without 
suggestion from anyone, brought me little instru- 
ments of their own devising, resembling the box 
lyre type. Many of them were made with rubber 
bands stretched across cardboard boxes of various 
shapes, and some of them were very well tuned. 
Psaltery—Our first psaltery was really an old 
auto-harp with the mechanism taken off and the 
strings rearranged; and this made an excellent one, 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
70 How Children Made Instruments 
for the psaltery is merely a flat box with a sound 
hole or holes, and strings of different lengths 
stretched across it. We used wire strings for our 
psaltery. Much plucking of the wire strings 
proved irritating to the fingers of the children, so 
they set about to relieve that difficulty. They tried 
using sticks of wood, pencils, nails, and various 
finger substitutes, and finally selected as their 
preference the quill end of a chicken wing-feather, 
which, indeed, was one of the early forms of the 
plectrum. They then discontinued the use of the 
finger on the psaltery, having actually experienced 
‘a reason for some instruments being played with a 
plectrum. 
The Lute—Some historian said that when the 
lyre got a neck, the lute stage had come. We had " 
used a cigar box with a hole in it for the box lyre. 
We took another cigar box, and instead of making a 
frame to support the strings, one long support was 
run through the center of the box and the strings 
attached to each end of this strip, running along 
almost the length of the strip. Although in the 
box lyre we had eight strings, in this instrument 
the strip was wide enough for only three peg holes 
in the top, so we could have only three strings. 
But luckily we didn’t need any more, for when the 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  How Children Made Instruments 71 
strings were tuned and little bridges in place to 
keep the strings from rattling against the strip of. 
wood, we found that we could make other notes— 
in fact, we could finish the entire scale, by pressing 
fingers on the strings and making the parts that 
vibrated shorter and shorter. This was our Cigar- 
box Lute. The three strings were tuned to the 
major triad and the children found it easy to play 
chords as well as melodies on it. 
An interesting experiment with an instrument of 
the lute type was made with a long Hercules Club 
gourd. This gourd had a hole in the largest part 
of it (see Fig. 33). After it left the garden it had 
served as a birds’ nest hanging in a tree and 
through this hole the birds had gone in and out to 
the nest inside. The gourd was brought to me 
with bits of the nest still in it. Without changing 
the gourd in any way, except to varnish it, the 
children made a lute of it,‘and because of the 
history of the gourd, we called it our Birds’ Nest 
Lute. 
I also used the Irish harp in my experimental 
work and found that the children loved to play 
their melodies on it. Two-hand harp technic 
seemed difficult at first for many of the children, 
but after they had acquired freedom in playing 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  72, How Children Made Instruments 
their simple melodies with their thumbs alone, they 
gradually brought the other fingers into use. 
Banjo—The lute had given the children an 
interest in instruments with a body to reinforce 
the sound, and a neck on which to control the 
making of different tones. One day I offered them 
half a cocoanut shell and asked for suggestions as 
to how they could make a stringed instrument of 
that. The suggestions that resulted led to the 
making of a cocoanut banjo of the same type as 
those made by oriental peoples, with parchment 
covering the opening of the shell. As in the case 
of the lute, the children played melodies and chords 
by plucking the strings with their fingers. 
The sound of strings stretched over parchment 
was so pleasing to the children that they wanted to 
try it out in some other way. A round butter tub 
from the grocer’s (about seven inches in diameter) 
offered a tempting shape. The bottom was pushed 
out, and with the lid off it was merely a circular 
band. With this rim as a frame for the parch- 
ment, a boy of nine years made a fine butter tub 
banjo which sounded much like the real minstrel 
banjo. 
A gourd banjo was also made in the studio by using 
the large end of a gourd for the resonating body.

Bowed Instruments 
The bow and arrow hanging on the wall had 
been quite forgotten in the interest of its various 
musical descendants until one day I took down 
the bow and handed it to a child who was play- 
ing the cocoanut banjo. Without my sugges- 
tion he drew it across a string, making a thin 
squeaky sound that interested him very much. I 
put rosin on the bow string, and the sound was 
clearer. Then I produced a real violin bow and the 
sound was much more pleasing. One difficulty, 
however, prevented its use on any string of the 
banjo except an outside one, for the child could not 
pull the bow across the middle string without strik- 
ing all three. Accustomed to finding a way out of 
difficulties, he contrived a new bridge, one that was 
higher in the middle than at the sides. When the 
three strings were stretched over this he found that 
he could draw his bow over each of the strings 
separately. Thus, by merely changing the bridge, 
he had converted his cocoanut banjo into a cocoa- 
nut fiddle. Then he wanted to make a horse hair 
bow; so I procured a bunch of horse hairs from a 
bow maker and he fastened them to a curved stick, 
rosined them well, and his bow was ready. A loop 
    
-P-A-G-E-104
  74 How Children Made Instruments 
at one end allowed him to relieve the tension on 
the stick when the bow was not in use. 
The logical result of the discovery of the use of 
the bow on the cocoanut banjo was the desire to 
make an instrument especially for bowing. The 
children were content to have only one string at 
first until they learned to use the bow with good 
results, for by this time they knew how to manipu- 
late one string to produce several tones. Following 
the natural development of musical instruments, 
this new instrument was destined to be a Mono- 
chord. We used a large, deep cigar box, and put 
a strong stick through it; cut f holes (like other 
bowed instruments we had seen) and stretched a 
violin D string over a high bridge. (See Figure 37.) 
In the last stages we were almost breathless with the 
impatience to see what the monochord’s tone would 
be. Finally it was ready to speak for the first 
time, and we stood around it in ceremonious awe. 
Its maker (a little girl of eight), radiant with 
excitement, drew the bow slowly across the string. 
“Oh!” everyone cried at once. “How beautiful!” 
“What a lovely tone!” And there on the work- 
bench lay that wonderful singing Thing, ready to 
give out its voice to any child who wished to draw 
the bow across it. No other instrument we had 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  How Children Made Instruments 75 
made had been quite the revelation that this one 
was. There seemed something quite human about 
it, and the children danced around it in ecstatic 
glee, taking turns at trying its tone. We found 
that the easiest way to play this instrument was 
to hold it firmly between the knees. This gave 
room for free arm movement. 
Soon after this a little maid of six had an inspira- 
tion. She also would make a monochord, and 
would bring it to me as a surprise! So she set to 
work to find materials. Her little “Tilly Tinker” 
(toy) box seemed to have possibilities, but she had 
no cover for it. Never mind, she knew there were 
scraps of sheepskin left from the banjos, and surely 
there was a piece big enough to cover this small 
box. She took the dimensions and shyly asked me 
for a scrap the right size. Other difficulties were 
overcome; she asked for help in nailing the skin to 
the box, and finally it was finished and strung 
with scraps of violin strings tied together! She 
proudly presented it to me and was delighted when 
I gave her a string for it all in one piece. It had 
a funny little tone and she found much pleasure 
in trying to see how many different sounds she 
could get out of it. In experimenting with this, 
she discovered the use of the movable bridge and 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  76 How Children Made Instruments 
thereafter played her tunes on it by slipping the 
little bridge up and down to places she had marked 
on the neck of the instrument, while with the other 
hand she plucked the string over the parchment 
(see Figure 31). 
Inspired also by Florence’s. monochord, Charles 
(age nine) would go even further and make an 
instrument with three strings to be played upon 
with the bow. He would make a cigar-bor cello 
out of the biggest cigar box he could possibly find! 
The cello proved as satisfactory as the monochord, 
and its three strings made its possibilities greater. 
Many three-stringed cellos were made in the stu- 
dio, of varying sizes and with great varieties of tone. 
The deep cedar-wood cigar boxes seemed to give 
the best tone. 
The success of these cigar-box fiddles seemed 
to stimulate the children’s ambition to make other 
kinds of bowed instruments. Elizabeth was the 
first to attempt a violin to be held at the shoulder. 
She found a small flat cigar box, and following, 
with my assistance, the same plan that was em- 
ployed in making the cellos, she soon had a cigar-boxr 
violin which she could hold under her chin and play 
—treal violin fashion! This instrument also had 
three strings. It seemed to me that four strings 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
    How Children Made Instruments 77 
would make the playing a little too difficult for 
children until after they had acquired some experi- 
ence in the use of an instrument with strings that 
were more easily separated than four strings could 
be. The holding of the instrument and the proper 
use of the bow seemed, to my mind, hard enough at 
first, without having undue complications in keep- 
ing the bow from striking more than one string at a 
time. However, since they had used the bow on 
the monochord and cello, its use in the violin 
position did not present any great difficulty, and 
three strings were easily managed. The cigar-box 
violin was tuned in fifths (as were the cellos). 
After Elizabeth had tried out her new violin and 
played a few melodies on it, she spontaneously 
hugged it to her, saying, “Oh, I just love this little 
fiddle!” The fiddle was truly hers, for she had 
made it. Of course she loved it. 
This little violin served as a model for other 
children to follow. The musical possibilities of 
these instruments were patiently investigated by 
their makers, who found that very pleasing results 
could be obtained. 
As soon as there were two instruments to be 
played with a bow, the children were eager to play 
them together, and by the end of the second year 
      
-P-A-G-E-108
  78 How Children Made Instruments 
of the experiment, we had a delightful quartet of 
home-made stringed instruments. This quartet 
played folk songs in unison and in four parts; 
classic melodies, and original compositions. 
After a few months’ use of her cigar-box violin, 
Santa Claus brought Elizabeth a “‘real’’ one, and 
this marked an important’ point in her musical 
development. She now had a professionally made 
violin in her hands for the first time in her life, 
and yet it seemed almost a well known friend. She 
not only knew at once the reason for every part of 
its construction, but was able to appreciate all 
the advantages it had over her own crude instru- 
ment: its fine polish, slender neck, graceful curves, 
and especially the ‘‘scooped out” places at the sides 
where the bow could have freer play. The instru- 
ment fell naturally into place under her chin, and 
when she drew her bow across it for the first time, 
she was conscious of the richness and fullness of 
tone which she had not been able to produce before 
and she marveled at the violin maker’s skill. She 
possessed the background of knowledge and ex- 
perience which gave her the ability to appreciate 
at once its finer tone quality and greater musical 
possibilities, and to discriminate between its own 
good and bad tones. Although nothing but a “real” 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
   How Children Made Instruments 79 
violin of good make will now meet her musical 
needs, she still holds an affectionate regard for the 
object of her own handiwork—her first little violin. 
When the time came for Margaret to make a 
violin, she wished to try to make one more nearly 
like the new violin which she had heard Eliza- 
beth play. She used thin boards of Spanish cedar 
wood, and made the box instead of using a cigar 
box, for she thought that a deeper box might have 
a fuller tone, so she made it just deep enough to fit 
under her chin without the use of a chin rest. 
A peep into the “real” violin showed a sound 
post to intensify the sound. She decided to try a 
sound post also and see what happened. A little 
round post was glued to stand behind the bridge 
under the smallest string, and under the largest 
string, a small sounding board was glued to the box 
cover. The effect of these additions was very 
pronounced, and Margaret’s violin proved to be a 
definite step in advance of the simpler cigar-box 
fiddles. Its tone quality and power make this 
instrument worthy of a place beside many of 
professional make. 
After all this experimenting and developing of 
stringed instruments, the children began to mani-
-P-A-G-E-110
eo | 
80 How Children Made Instruments 
fest a genuine curiosity about how the piano came 
to be. So I procured for them a Dulcimer, an 
instrument which represents a stage between the 
psaltery (which they knew) and the piano. The 
dulcimer is, like the psaltery, a set of strings of 
different lengths, stretched over a flat sounding 
box, but the wires are struck with a hammer, which 
makes it a more direct ancestor of the piano. The 
children were able to play their melodies on the 
dulcimer with ease after they learned the scale 
arrangement. They could easily realize that after 
people began using hammers on strings it was 
natural to expect them to develop a mechanical 
means of using the hammers and to improve the 
effect in various ways, the modern piano being the 
eventual result. 
Although there are hundreds of other kinds of 
stringed instruments in the category of music’s 
development, it seems to me that those described 
above cover the field sufficiently for the child. He 
passes from plucked strings without a resonating 
body to plucked strings with resonating bodies, 
of which the lyre and harp are conspicuous ex- 
amples; thence, in one direction to strings played 
with a plectrum, and the honored representative

of this type, the psaltery; and further on to the use 
of a hammer on the strings, the dulcimer, and to the 
perfected mechanism for hammers as in the piano; 
and then in another direction, through various 
types of stringed instruments with finger boards 
and those in which sound is obtained by the use of 
a bow, he experiences the development of bowed 
instruments leading up to the strings of the modern 
orchestra.

  CHAPTER V 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RHYTHMIC SENSE 
_ Tue foundation of music is rhythm, and as every- 
one knows, the feeling for rhythm must first find 
expression through the body:, It was the recogni- 
tion of the child’s need to feel rhythm physically 
before he could sing or play rhythmically, that led 
me, many years ago, to incorporate dancing in my 
music teaching, and to devote to it a part of every 
music lesson. 
Some children are so well codrdinated in their 
bodily movements that dancing seems to come as 
naturally and easily as walking. In the case of 
these children, civilization has not deprived them 
of their birthright of feeling animal freedom. In 
my mind they are merely the normal (if normal 
may mean natural) rather than the especially en- 
dowed ones, and if all constraining influences were 
removed from the time of birth, doubtless all 
children would have as much freedom of body as 
young wild animals that have never experienced 
82 
=

fear. But we have to pay the cost of everything 
we have, and the muscular stiffness and awkward- 
ness of so many of our children is the price we pay 
for a “proper” bringing up. 
The constraint that blocks the free bodily ex- 
pression of rhythm will also hold back other musi- 
cal development, for if this essential foundation 
is poor, all that follows is impaired. ( If a child is 
unmusical at eight or ten years of age, it does not 
always mean that he could not have been rausioath 
if his body had been free and his training construc- 
tive, or that he could not yet be, under the right 
conditions.) Who can tell how much natural 
musical power has been buried in a stiff little body, 
has become atrophied, and has never been recog- 
nized because it was denied the outlet of rhythmic 
bodily expression as the natural starting point in its 
growth? (Is it not true that one seldom finds a 
really musical person with a constrained, awkward 
body? ' I cannot gag as one. It is useless to 
do and think; the body is the medium through 
which sidan thought must be expressed, and sofar ~ 
- as our bodies are tied up with fear and other con- 
straints, just so far is the music within us hopelessly 
imprisoned. Since vocal and instrumental music 
   
-P-A-G-E-116
  84 Development of Rhythmic Sense 
both depend so vitally upon bodily freedom and 
muscular coérdination, it is of great importance 
that this foundation shall be laid in the beginning 
of the child’s musical study, and as early in his life 
as possible. 
In beginning my work with each child, it has 
* been my plan to find out so far as possible just 
what stage has been reached by his natural develop- 
ment in rhythmic feeling, and to take it up at that 
point. .To ascertain this, it seems to me neces- 
sary first of all, to establish an attitude of mind 
and body conducive to the child’s freedom of 
expression, and for this, of course, I have to feel 
my way experimentally with each child (and will 
probably always have to do so) until the child’s 
confidence and freedom are established. 
I have not employed social or esthetic dancing, 
or the study of curves or attitudes, but have gone 
back to the simplest rhythmic movements and the 
most elemental forms of dancing for material to 
use in developing the little child’s bodily response 
to rhythm. Many dances of primitive peoples 
are excellently suited to little children, though of 
course these must be selected with care, as some sav- 
age dances are not at all appropriate for children. 
The earliest rhythmic movements of primitive
-P-A-G-E-117
   
   
                                               Development of Rhythmic Sense 85 
peoples and little children are without form, just 
as their earliest songs are without form. The re- 
sponse to rhythmic stimuli seems to be instinctive, 
in both animals and children, whether the nervous 
system receives the stimulus by means of the sense 
of touch, the eye, or the ear. But the earliest re- 
sponse is only to pure rhythm, or pulse; the recog- 
nition of rhythmic form is the result of experience 
—of sensori-motor learning. As early as a baby 
can use his eye muscles well enough to watch a 
moving object, he is apparently fascinated by the 
rhythmic swaying of objects; through his eye he 
responds to rhythmic motion, but the rhythmic 
design of the wall paper before his eyes means 
nothing whatever to him until he has first re- 
sponded to formless rhythm, and his eye has, 
through experience only, learned to see and appre- 
ciate rhythmic design. The same is true of ear 
impressions, and the recognition of form in 
rhythmic sounds can come only after similar ex- 
perience. The child who has an undeveloped 
sense of rhythm must be taken back, even to th : 
reflex level if necessary, until his natural mia? 
to rhythmic stimuli is found, in order that none of 3 
those experiences upon which his development 
depends shall be lacking. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
86 Development of Rhythmic Sense 
_ First of all the muscles must form habits, and 
the mother who holds her baby’s hands and 
teaches him to clap “Pat-a-cake” is giving him 
sensori-motor training in rhythmic expression. I 
have often found it necessary to hold a child’s feet 
or hands and guide the movements of them with 
my own hands until he felt the sensation of the 
rhythmic movement of hand or foot. After this it 
was easier for him to execute the movements alone. 
Clapping the hands together and tapping with the 
hand, or with a stick, upon some hard surface are 
perhaps the simplest movements for children, and 
by means of these the child may get his first defi- 
nite feeling of rhythmic expression. If he walks 
with freedom, his first sensation of the rhythmic 
motions of his feet may come from walking or 
marching. Marching is the natural model for time 
measure and most children find it easy, but there 
are many children whose leg muscles need a little 
sensori-motor training before they recognize the 
sensation of rhythmic walking. 
The child must be able not only to make steady, 
rhythmic movements with his hands and with his 
feet, but he must also be able to adjust his mo- 
tions to fit some other steady rhythm—that of 
\. the music, for instance—and to recognize a change

to faster or slower tempi, and quickly to change 
his established rhythm to fit the new rhythm of 
the music. This ability is the foundation for all 
rhythmic work, and when the child has acquired 
accuracy in this, he is ready to make more rapid 
progress in rhythmic expression, and has also an 
important ally in the acquirement of skill in other 
lines, and in his life’s work in general. 
It is a noteworthy fact that all effort is easier 
and less tiring when done rhythmically. | There is 
something in the swing of rhythmic effort that 
carries it on of its own impetus, to the great 
saving of human energy. This fact has been 
recognized by most primitive peoples, who have 
habitually availed themselves of this means to 
lighten their labors. It has also been wisely em- 
ployed by men of greater intelligence to secure 
more efficient work from laborers. The person who 
writes rhythmically writes better than one who 
does not, and the acquirement of rhythm in any 
movement which one tries to learn facilitates his 
skill and ease in that movement. Many functions 
of our own bodies are striking proofs of the value 
of rhythm in our lives. Health is rhythmical, and 
a child’s nature basks in rhythm, “‘the great correc- 
tor of nervous diseases and irregulated emotions.”

It is in this stage. of sii unchanging rhythm 
that so many of the jigs and jolly dances of primi- 
tive peoples belong. I have found these most 
useful for little children, for they, like savages, 
prefer to continue at length any special step which 
they enjoy, without thought of change or figure.

dances which involve the free use of the entire 
body and also bring about the recognition of form 
in dancing.| Active experiences_in the forms of 
dances are the natural I preparation for the under- 
standing-of form in in . song and nd instrumental music. 
The child who feels the form of his dance will be 
able to feel form in his singing and playing, a 
also in the compositions | he creates. 
Throughout the work the children have the 
opportunity for original expression, and they 
may combine familiar steps into new forms of 
their own. In the original dance work, these 
children have invented new steps and pantomimes, 
improvised to music almost daily, made dance 
dramatizations of fairy tales, poems and original 
stories, and impersonated natural phenomena, 
etc.—sometimes individually, but usually in 
groups. | For example, one group of children made 
a very pretty dramatization of the life of the cater- 
pillar and butterfly and dictated the kind of music 
desired at every stage. Very young children love 
all kinds of animal dances, especially those that 
involve both hands and feet in imitation of four- 
footed animals, and they sometimes show great 
ingenuity in improvising dances of this kind. 
While I think it most important to give children 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  90 Development of Rhythmic Sense 
freedom in improvising dances of their own I have 
found it necessary to guard against the riotous ele- 
ment that sometimes comes into children’s activi- 
ties when they are given free play. Dancing is the 
most spontaneous of all the arts, but when it be- 
comes riotous and uncontrolled it is no longer an 
art; it is either a pathological nervous reaction or a 
reversion to the animal plane, and tends to be de- 
structive to the true artistic sense which we are 
trying to develop. One’s own improvisations in 
dancing, as well as in singing and playing, must 
reach toward ideals of form, balance, and sim- 
plicity, and must lead to a sane expression and 
appreciation of art. 
I have found dancing a valuable aid not only in 
teaching musical and poetic form to children, but 
also in the feeling and understanding of the differ- 
ent pulses of music. To dance the same kind of 
step to different pulses, according to the music, 
gives the child a definite experience in feeling 
pulses. To walk or to dance the rhythm of a 
melody will give the child a physical sensation of 
the rhythm which will enable him to play or to 
sing it with greater rhythmic accuracy. 
A description of all the dances I have used does 
not lie within the scope of this book, nor is it 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  Development of Rhythmic Sense 91 
needed. The value of dancing is generally recog- 
nized and there are many books of children’s 
dances to which the reader will have access. The 
main objects of this discussion are to emphasize / 
the need of correlating dancing with the child’s Y 
music study, of giving it the place of first impor- 
tance when beginning to cultivate the musical 
sense, and to indicate the importance of using 
material that is truly constructive and yet simple 
enough to allow his development to be natural. It 
must be remembered that a child is not trained by 
what is presented to him but by his own reaction 
to what is presented. ~~ 
It has seemed not out of place, however, to give 
a détailed description of a few of my own experi- 
ments in this line which may be useful, and which 
others may wish to try. : 
One day I observed a group of negro carpenters 
at work on the roof of a building. They were sing- 
ing in unison and the fall of their hammers came 
rhythmically together, as they nailed on the 
shingles. They seemed to enjoy it so much that 
it gave me an idea for my rhythmic teaching: my 
little folks could build houses to music! I had a 
number of wooden blocks made about one inch by 
an inch and a half by ten inches and gave each 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  92 Development of Rhythmic Sense 
child sixteen blocks. After they had made various 
designs of their own, I showed the children how to 
make hollow towers of these blocks like the corn- 
cob pig-pens that country children make. After 
they had made several and knocked them over, 
we tried building them to music. At first it was 
hard for them to bring the block down exactly on 
the accented note, but after a little practice they 
found great pleasure in having all the blocks come 
down at the same instant, as one block. I played 
music in duple pulse, and they lifted the blocks 
on the unaccented note and put them in place on 
the accented note. At first they used one hand 
in this, then learned to do it equally well with the 
other hand, and afterwards used the two hands 
alternately. The children liked this exercise so 
much that they were always disappointed when the 
last block was used; so we tried the plan of con- 
tinuing the exercise indefinitely by rebuilding the 
tower in another place as soon as it was finished, 
without waiting for the music to stop. As each 
child worked with sixteen blocks, the finished 
building came out each time at the end of a phrase, 
and this gave them new experiences in the feeling 
of form. Sometimes they built the towers slowly, 
moving on alternate beats, and at other times tried
-P-A-G-E-127
  
Development of Rhythmic Sense 93 
moving in double-quick time to the still unchanged 
music. 
I remembered having seen two or more work- 
men wielding sledges with rhythmic, alternate 
strokes, to drive a long stake into the ground; 
and again we used the workmen’s suggestion and 
two children built a tower together. This was a 
little more difficult, as it required not only a feeling 
for the rhythm and a proper coérdination of the 
muscles, but it also required inhibition at the same 
time. 
This tower-building exercise involves concen- 
trated attention, intelligence in keeping the tower 
straight, recognition and feeling for rhythm, a 
fine codrdination of hand and arm that brings 
the block down not only at the exact instant but 
in a definitely ordered place (upon the accuracy 
of which the beauty and strength of the tower de- 
pends), and with a definite force (to keep from 
knocking the tower down), also definite self con- 
trol in keeping each hand from working out of 
turn; and when two or more children work on one 
tower, an extra social value is added. 
All kinds of ball games and ball dances are of 
value in giving the body rhythmic coérdination. 
Children love to catch balls, and even bean bags, 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
re ee ne ny me eer te 
94 Development of Rhythmic Sense 
to music, and my pupils have enjoyed attempts to 
combine dancing and ball catching in various ways. 
After children have acquired sufficient muscular co- 
érdination, this combination offers a large field in 
which they may make dances of their own, singly 
or in groups. 
One experiment proved to be such a delight to 
the children that it served as a special treat: A 
group of children stood with balls in their hands 
and listened to the music which changed its tempo 
at frequent intervals. The plan was to throw the 
ball up on one beat and catch it on the next, and 
to regulate the distance the ball was thrown ac- 
cording to the time that elapsed between beats of 
the music. ¢If the tempo was very slow the balls had 
to be thrown very high so they would not fall back 
to the hand before the next note was struck. If 
the tempo was very fast, a few inches was as much 
as the ball had time to go. Each time the tempo 
changed the children were allowed to pause for one 
measure to feel the rhythm. If a ball was dropped 
to the floor, or thrown or caught out of rhythm, 
the owner of it was temporarily out of the game. 
This exercise calls for alertness of attention, 
quickness of response, muscular codrdination, 
rhythmic feeling, quick judgment in selecting the

distance, and physical adjustment in regulating 
the force to carry the ball to the right distance. 
It has an added interest when it can be given 
out of doors where the slowness of the tempo may 
be limited only according to the distance which the 
child can throw and catch the ball. 
Ball throwing serves its purpose in rhythmic 
work by more or less vigorous movements, requir- 
ing a varying degree of muscular force. As a 
contrast to this, I tried experiments with balloons, 
which required an inhibition of muscular force, 
and these exercises I believe to be also valuable. 
When the child who is accustomed to throwing 
balls takes a balloon in his hand and throws it up, 
he invariably sends it too high until he has learned 
to adjust his muscles to more delicate movements. 
At first I had the children throw balloons lightly 
to music with simple duple pulse—“up—catch—up 
—catch,” etc. Afterward they followed music in 
triple pulse, bouncing the balloon once before 
catching it: ‘“‘up—bounce—catch,” etc. Later 
they used quadruple pulse, with a bounce for each 
hand, thus: ““up—bounce—bounce—catch,” etc., 
and in every case the force had to be so adjusted that 
the balloon would go high enough to come back to 
the hand exactly on the proper beat of the music. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
ee aT ee ee re | / 96 Development of Rhythmic Sense 
This exercise has great rhythmic value, and the 
ease with which the balloon is bounced makes it a 
great help in giving children definite experiences in 
different pulses. I have also found it especially 
valuable for children whose movements were 
“heavy” and who habitually used too much force 
in their activities. It “calmed down” their mo- 
tions and the results in lightness and grace were 
very marked. The charm of the colored balloon 
seems to make the child forget himself in his ab- 
sorbed interest in the balloon to a greater degree 
than in any other dances I have tried, and it has 
been very interesting to see children who are 
usually awkward give expression to freedom and 
real grace in this dance. 
The Dead Game was another experiment that 
had very gratifying results in pure relaxation. 
Once the mother of one of my new pupils asked the 
child what part of the lesson he had enjoyed most, 
and he answered, “I like being dead best of all!” 
which puzzled the mother very much until she 
visited the studio. The idea is to drop all effort 
at a given signal, and instantly be as relaxed as if 
one had been shot. I have used the word “‘dead”’ 
deliberately, and have found no unpleasant reac- 
tion to the word on the part of the children, when it

OO ME Se en ee eee ee ee ee eT ee ey eee 
Development of Rhythmic Sense 97 
was properly introduced. It is the “grown-up” 
who is afraid of the word, but to children it appeals 
to the dramatic instinct as few words do. If I 
should ask Johnny to relax, he would probably see 
no use in it, and I would have a big undertaking 
in attempting to teach him how to relax; but if he 
is a bear walking on all fours through the forest 
or doing a wonderful bear dance, and a hunter ap- 
pears and shoots him, he is instantly a dead bear, 
and more relaxed than anyone could teach him 
to be. Gradually, remembering this and other 
pleasant experiences in being dead, he learns to 
relax intelligently. He also learns by experience 
early in his life how much faster his body recuper- 
ates in being completely dead than in half relaxed 
resting, and forms a healthful and time-saving 
habit. I have also tried sleeping games, but the 
response is not so quick nor so effectual. Sleep is 
too common an experience with children to have 
the same effect. It is not dramatic enough. 
When the children first practice the dead inter- 
lude, I usually precede it with an animal dance, to 
give them a motive for making the action as per- 
fect as possible. Then the hunter examines the 
animals to see if they are dead; lifts each limb to 
see if it falls without resistance. If it isn’t dead, 
z
-P-A-G-E-134
  98 Development of Rhythmic Sense 
“it will be in just a moment.” A little “dead 
music”—very soft, quieting strains—will help to 
keep the children absolutely lifeless as long as 
seems best for them. Presently a magic chord 
is heard which changes the dead bears into live 
children who are entirely refreshed, and only a 
minute or two has been consumed in the resting. 
Later the dramatic preparation may be omitted; 
and the moment I see signs of fatigue in a child, 
all I have to do is to point my finger at him and 
say, ‘Bang!’ and he is instantly flat on the floor 
or on the couch. I believe this to be one of the 
most helpful things the children have learned in my 
studio; I realize its value every day. It is alsoa 
clear illustration of how the imitative and dramatic 
impulse of little children can be used for construc- 
tive and healthful purposes, where an intellectual 
process would be futile.

CHAPTER VI 
SINGING AND VOICE CONTROL FOR CHILDREN 
Most children develop the sense of rhythm before 
they acquire an appreciation of tone, and are able 
to codrdinate the muscles of their bodies in dancing 
before they can produce definite melodies. This is 
consistent, for dancing is more elemental than any 
other form of rhythmic expression, reaching back 
even into the animal stage. Though the union of 
song and dance is almost universal among primitive 
peoples, all primitive music stresses rhythm rather 
than melody. 
The child’s first experience in tone should be 
"Tiel fst psc in fone ssl te 
melody was in song which he practiced long before 
artificial instruments of melody were even thought 
of. “As dancing is more elemental than singing, 
so singing s more elemental then playing and Tes playing, and it is 
fitting that the child shall sing before he plays. 
Besides; melody playing hrits simplest form is but 
the imitation of the voice in song, and I feel that

correlated 1 song ex experiences are absolutely neces- 
sary in the » logical development of any kind” “of 
musical training for the child. ; 
Children, like birds, Iearn to sing by imitation, 
and it is not too early to start a child’s musical 
education the day he is born, by singing to him./ 
The child who is born into a family of spontaneous 
singers and who hears singing habitually in his 
home, stands a fair chance of being able to sing 
very early in his life, but the child whose mother 
and nurses never sing simple childish songs to him 
lacks the best opportunity to learn an art that 
necessarily begins by pure imitation. 
The singing voice should be produced as easily 
and naturally as the speaking voice, and if children 
heard as much singing as talking, it probably 
would be. The child improvises his own words in 
conversation, and he should be able to improvise 
as freely with his singing voice. To speak in a 
singing voice with abandon, without having to 
conform to a set song, is a great help in freeing the 
voice. If we could, from our earliest childhood, 
feel and practice utter freedom in vocal sounds 
without being held down to real songs, and with no 
    
fear of forgetting either tune or words, I think we 
would probably not have to work so hard in later
-P-A-G-E-137
ee en Ae ae ae ee ee ee ee en Te ee ae

years to get our voices properly “‘placed.”’ Con- 
straint is at the root of most bad use of the voice. 
No organ of our anatomy responds more quickly 
to either physical or mental constraint, and infancy 
is the time to establish its freedom. 
I believe that little children learn best to sing _ 
songs by attempting to imitate without having thei their 
attention called to their inaccuracies of pitchyuntil 
after the plan of ignoring them has been given a 
fair trial. To call attention to an inaccuracy in 
the_child’s singing tends to make him self-con- 
scious, and the voice is very susceptible to_con- 
straint from self-consciousness. One’ ”s own nervous 
mechanism takes care of adjusting the muscles of 
the pharynx that regulate the pitch of the voice, 
and one’s conscious efforts to help the fixing of 
those muscles usually hinder rather than help. 
/Unrestrained experience in singing is what every 
\ child needs, and the child who sings much with 
neither physical constraint nor external restraint 
will usually develop a natural mechanism for regu- 
lating the pitch of his tones, just as birds do/ I 
have been interested to observe that young birds 
do not, in the beginning, “‘carry the tune” any   
  
more accurately than most children do. For sev- 
eral years I had the opportunity to observe the 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
lana a ae ala CE he A lil | 
102 Singing and Voice Control 
methods of mother robins teaching their little ones 
to sing, as the trees around my home were nesting 
places for several families and several generations. 
These robins, year after year, held their singing 
school near my windows, and invariably they used 
the same little song for the baby birds to practice 
on—one much simpler than the wonderful songs 
the grown-up robins usually sang. Over and over 
again, hundreds of times a day, the mother bird 
would call to her fledglings, scarcely able to hop 
out of the nest, ‘“‘Te de, tedle de!” —(the intervals 
being mi-re-mi-re-do). Faintly a little one would 
call back a prolonged “‘te!” wandering around on 
two or three indefinite notes. Immediately would 
come the bold answer from the mother, giving the 
song correctly. This singing school held all-day 
sessions. The teacher was indefatigable, though 
the pupils restored their enthusiasm by frequent 
naps. From day to day I could hear improvement 
in their singing, and in a short time, an especially 
clever one would be proudly caroling “Te-dle- 
de!” He had acquired the three notes at the end 
of the song, but the whole thing was a bit too com- 
plicated for him as yet. Before the summer was 
over, however, all the young robins had learned 
their lessons well, and a sliding, uncertain note was
-P-A-G-E-139
  
Singing and Voice Control 103 
very rarely heard. I believe that any child, who 
would begin relatively as early, and sing as much 
as those robins sang, with a simple and correct pat- 
tern ever ready for him to imitate, would be able 
to sing well and accurately no matter what his lack 
in musical inheritance might be. 
From the beginning of their training, I have my 
pupils sing simple songs by rote—children’s songs 
and folk songs, and their own improvisations, with- 
out any thought of analyzing them, since first of 
all their experiences must be enlarged and habits 
of free singing established. This rote singing is 
carried on through all their traiping until they are 
able to read new songs, “for chil must always 
sing. 
Inaccuracies in pitch in a child’s singing are 
usually due either to lack of ex] experience and use of 
the voice or to inattention to the sound he is s trying 
to imitate. ) ) Often. he does not listen well.) Per- 
haps he does not know how to concentrate his 
attention on something that is coming to him 
through hisear. Most savage children are trained 
in keenness of ear perception, but our children are 
brought up to rely more upon the eye and sense of 
touch for their impressions, and few of them notice 
anything but loud sounds, or know how to listen 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  104. Singing and Voice Control 
for qualities of sound or to discriminate between 
those qualities. So first of all the child must learn 
to listen. If he ‘l listens intently to “the t tone he 
wishes to imitate, and s with relaxed throat, 
the tone will usually come approximately tr true. 
I found that often a child would sing a correct 
tone and instantly allow it to slide off pitch. To 
remedy this by increasing the child’s power of at- 
tention and control over the tone, I tried the experi-    
  ment of having the children sing entire sentences 
ononetone. Often we held lengthy conversations 
in the form of one-note chants, changing occasion- 
ally to another tone, but always singing steadily 
on pitch. This seemed to help the children very 
much to a realization of pitch; the physical sensa- 
tion of steadily holding one tone gave them an 
experience in pitch control that seemed to make 
further singing easier. It seemed reasonable to 
suppose that the ability to hold the tone in one 
place would facilitate control in adjusting the voice 
to different pitches. It also occurred to me that 
one-note chants would be a good starting place in 
teaching monotones to sing, and the idea worked 
surprisingly well. \Monotones are really our most 
elemental singers, and it seems to me that they 
give us a cue as to the natural development of
-P-A-G-E-141
Singing and Voice Control 105 
voice control. As they sing everything on or near 
one tone, they may be brought to sing consciously 
one steady tone, and from this gradually widen the 
power of voice control. 
By occasionally using in our conversational 
singing a tone one step above our main tone, we 
progressed to chants of two notes. We always 
used the higher note on a word we wished to em- 
phasize. At this point I gave the children a few 
definite two-note melodies, which they not only 
sang but also played on bells and metal bars. (Two 
of these melodies will be found in the next chapter.) 
Two tones do not allow much melodic variety, but 
when the child can sing three tones, using 1, 2, and 
3 of the major scale, he then has the means of great 
variety in melody, especially with different rhyth- 
mic combinations. It may be of interest to note 
that the spontaneous improvisations of small chil- 
dren who have never been taught, often lie within 
this range of three notes, the third being sometimes 
major and sometimes minor. 
A musical historian (Rowbotham) brings much 
evidence to prove that the history of vocal music 
commenced with a one-note period, and he cites 
the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego as living ex- 
amples of primitive peoples still in that stage; this, 
   
-P-A-G-E-142
106 Singing and Voice Control 
he claims, was followed by a two-note period, and 
later the third note above was added, and he gives 
many specimens of songs belonging to the three- 
note period, monotonous, and without form. 
Rowbotham’s theory suggested to me the plan of 
following that order in both the singing and the 
playing of little children, and the results indicate 
that, whether or not this theory as to the long-ago 
evolution of song is true, the order fits the natural 
development of the little child of to-day and allows 
musical beginning to take deep root in him. 
The third note was added to the children’s con- 
scious repertoire also by means of the chant with- 
out musical form, the highest note being employed 
for words to which we wished to give special em- 
phasis. From improvising chants the children 
naturally began singing Mother Goose rhymes to 
melodies of three notes, and thus we took up the 
study of form in singing. They had already had 
experiences in form in their rote singing, but had 
not intellectualized those experiences or recognized 
form as such. 
From the three-note scale to an understanding 
of the pentatonic scale (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the 
diatonic major scale) was easy progression, since 
in their rote-song experiences the children had

-P-A-G-E-144

-P-A-G-E-145
Singing and Voice Control 107 
already employed those tones. They were partial 
to the pentatonic scale, and seemed to fall quite 
naturally into the use of it in their song improvisa- 
tions. Indeed, many musical peoples have shown 
a preference for this scale, and it may be recalled 
that some of the loveliest folk songs are built upon 
it, “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,” for instance, and 
“Auld Lang Syne.” 
For the child’s mental picture of the intervals, 
I use the numerical names. Any child, when he 
begins music lessons, has already had practical 
experiences in numbers, and these are therefore 
simple and appropriate as symbols for the inter- 
vals. ‘“Do—re—mi” is a foreign language to the 
young child, and complicates his singing process. 
I have used the numbers for many years and have 
found them entirely satisfactory as guides both 
for singing and for the first instrumental playing. 
The children were so pleased to see that they 
could intellectualize the melodies which they had 
formerly sung by rote, that they wanted to analyze 
all of them, and by doing so, they soon acquired 
a conscious feeling for and recognition of all the 
intervals of the major scale and of the minor 
as well. 
     
-P-A-G-E-146
CHAPTER VII 
CORRELATION OF SINGING AND PLAYING 
Wirs no other motive than the pleasure of sing- 
ing, the children learned songs and sang them, and 
later, when they used instruments, these song ex- 
periences served them well. Children love familiar 
things in new forms, and the discovery of a dif- 
ferent way to produce a melody which they know 
how to sing, links up the new and the old experi- 
ences in a way that greatly pleases them. As 
stated in an earlier chapter, the first instruments 
used were percussion instruments. The children 
played melodies which they already knew, their 
efforts involving merely the attempt to imitate 
the voice (either theirs or mine) as nearly as the 
instrument would allow; so that in a sense, all their 
first playing has been a form of imitation, guided, 
of course, by mental processes varying according

playing. But those who could not sing accu- 
rately (and few of the very young ones could in 
the beginning) followed my voice in their playing. 
I also found that those children who could not 
easily sing in tune made much greater progress in 
voice control when they assisted their own voices 
by playing on the glasses. When the brain, the 
hand, the eye, and the voice were all concentrating 
on the same little melody, the voice was much 
truer in pitch. I have found this practice very 
helpful in teaching monotones to sing. The glasses 
- are better for this than metal instruments because 
the tones of the glasses are softer and blend better 
with the child’s voice. 
The musical literature used with these instru- 
ments comprised carefully arranged primitive 
songs, folk songs, simple melodies, the children’s 
own compositions, and classic themes. 
' The playing of the very young child in the 
beginning was, of course, of the simplest kind pos- 
sible. His instruments and his songs, too, were 
of small range, often involving only two or three 
notes. 
The chants and two-note and three-note songs 
which were given them not only helped the chil- 
dren to sing in tune, but also gave them material  
-P-A-G-E-148
  tro Correlation of Singing and Playing 
for playing upon the simple instruments which they 
used at first. They had played folk-song rhythms 
and other rhythms on their drums and rattles, and 
now they were ready to play melodies, but their 
simplest instruments had not the capacity for folk 
songs, and besides, the little child needed something 
even simpler to play. “Hot Cross Buns”’ is a fine 
example of the kind of song that is suited to the 
little child’s first playing. There is interesting 
variety in its melody and rhythm, and yet it is 
simple enough for any child who is old enough to 
learn to play melodies. But I have been unable 
to find in folk-song literature other songs as simple 
as this and yet suited to children, so to fill the need, 
I have been reduced to the necessity of supple- 
menting “Hot Cross Buns” with a few songs of 
my own making. In order that the child may be 
free to try out different kinds of instruments, he 
must have a number and variety of three-note 
melodies in his repertoire—melodies so simple 
that when he once knows them, they “go” with- 
out brain effort on his part, leaving him free to 
think of his new medium, and at the same time 
allow him to experience a musical result with it. 
Below are a few two-note and three-note melodies 
given in the simple notation which I use with the

children who know how to read numbers. The 
words give the rhythm, and the numbers repre- 
sent the notes of the diatonic major scale:

By the time the children had played three-note 
melodies, they had sung pentatonic melodies, and 
were anxious to try these songs of wider range on 
the different instruments, and also to improvise 
pentatonic melodies. There are many folk songs 
that involve only the first five notes of the major 
scale (‘‘Winter Goodbye,” for instance) and these 
we freely used. Four-note melodies are not so easi- 
ly found. Below is a four-note melody which the 
children used for their first tetrachord work on the 
lyre and other instruments.

As they had gradually increased their range of 
singing tones, so they gradually enlarged the com- 
pass of the tunes they played; and from five- and 
six-note melodies they passed easily to playing 
songs that involved the complete scale and more. 
Habits of listening carefully to the intervals innew 
songs and of recognizing the intervals they sang, 
made it very easy for the children, after a little 
experience, to play by ear most of the melodies 
they sang. In playing, they used numbers for 
their intervals, as they had in analyzing their songs. 
In fact it was in playing that I had first tried, years 
before, the use of numbers. J remembered that as 
a child I had thought only of the number of the 
interval when I played by ear naturally, and Icould 
think of no easier means of guiding children to 
play by ear intelligently. By intelligent playing 
by ear I mean a conscious recognition of the inter- 
val heard and an ‘instant placement of it on the 
instrument; and it is my belief that this kind of 
playing is an end greatly to be desired, based as it 
must be on a sound musical understanding. 
As soon as the children knew the number of the 
scale interval which each tone of the song repre- 
sented, and knew the rhythm of the melody, it was 
easy to transfer that knowledge to any instrument

114 Correlation of Singing and Playing 
which they knew how to manipulate, if it had the 
range capacity for it, without any thought of key 
or letter name. Nothing stood between the song 
and the instrument; no theory of music, no sym- 
bols, not even names of keys—only the relation of 
sounds to each other. If the child could sing a 
song and know what he was singing, that was all 
that was necessary; he could play it. This founda- 
tion leads not only to intimacy with the instrument, 
but in later study to easy and natural transposi- 
tion from key to key. Each new instrument that 
the child made or learned to use, served as a new 
medium through which to express his familiar 
tunes, and most of the children habitually wanted 
to play a melody on every instrument they knew 
how to manipulate. 
After the children had acquired a little freedom 
in playing simple melodies and after several had 
learned the same tunes, they combined their play- 
ing, first on instruments of the same kind, and 
afterwards on different kinds of instruments tuned 
together. Their first ensemble efforts were, of 
course, in unison, and they soon realized the need 
of having their instruments tuned accurately and 
in unison. It was interesting to observe how 
rapidly the children, even those four and five years   
 
-P-A-G-E-155
PET PRN RC ae oT ee ee ee RE Ee ee mee a eC eT ae

of age, developed the ability to tell when a note was 
out of tune. The daily tuning of the glasses gave 
them opportunity for much experience in pitch dis- 
crimination from the very beginning of their training, 
so that by the time they reached stringed instru- 
ments, they had little difficulty with the tuning. 
After a time, through both vocal and instru- 
mental experiences with rounds and canons, 
we came to an enjoyment and appreciation of 
harmony. With a little practice, the children 
could soon sustain their parts in a simple round 
with accuracy and enjoyment. The older children 
took great pleasure in “part playing” and in com- 
bining various instruments in the different parts; 
and when I added to their orchestral combinations 
further accompaniment at the piano, they were © 
delighted. One of the things which seemed to 
thrill them most was a Martin Luther Choral, the 
melody of which six of the children played on 
glasses, Swiss bells, and psalteries; while I supplied 
the modulating harmonies at the piano. “O, I 
love it!’ a child would often say; ‘Please let us 
play it again!” This was one of the things which 
they learned as pure melody, for we decided that 
no spoken words could be beautiful enough to be 
associated with it.
-P-A-G-E-156

116 Correlation of Singing and Playing 
After their experiences in singing, and in trans- 
ferring song melodies to instruments, the children 
seemed to progress naturally to the playing of 
| melodies without words, and to the appreciation 
| of pure melody. 
| I was pleased to see how well they could draw 
comparisons between the tone qualities of the 
different instruments, and how soon they de- 
veloped judgment in making combinations. For 
instance, one little girl said, after experimenting: 
“The ocarina doesn’t mix well with the glasses. 
I don’t like it at all. The harp goes much better 
with them.” They all have preferences as to com- 
binations of instruments, and have evinced de- 
cidedly developing taste in this, as also in the 
suitability of certain instruments for certain melo- 
dies. At one time two of the children were working 
on a. little Bach minuet, one child playing the 
upper voice and the other the lower voice. They 
tried it on the glasses, the harp, the lyres, the 
flageolet, and the marimba, and selected the latter 
as being most suited to the melody, as indeed it 
was, with its uniform clarity and purity of tone. 
It was a great day when four of the children 
were able to combine the playing of the fiddles 
which they had made, and organize a stringed

quartette. On these fiddles they played folk songs 
in unison and in parts, classic themes and their own 
compositions. One fiddle group played very musi- 
cally the theme of the Mozart A major Sonata 
with all its parts. 
In the children’s singing experiences J have pur- 
posely avoided songs that involved accidentals until 
I felt that they had developed a definite feeling 
for the pentatonic and diatonic scales. I remem- 
ber how, as a child, I was greatly confused by 
accidentals until by chance I consciously recog- 
nized the major scale as my “home base.”’ One 
will find that most of the best folk songs are with- 
out accidentals, which fact indicates that musical 
peoples develop first along the simple line of the 
scale. One of the most striking differences be- 
tween folk songs and many modern songs for chil- 
dren is the presence of accidentals in the latter. 
These accidentals make the melody more difficult 
for the child to comprehend, and they tend to con- 
fuse him when he tries to reproduce it in some other 
way than with his voice. In keeping with this 
idea, all of the simple instruments which the 
children first use are limited to the diatonic scale. 
After they are thoroughly at home in the manipu- 
lation of an instrument confined to the diatonic 
  e  
-P-A-G-E-160
  118 Correlation of Singing and Playing 
scale, the introduction of an accidental or two 
adds a new interest rather than confusion. One 
day Mary was experimenting with the Irish harp 
and discovered how, by turning a little device, the 
tones could be raised a half step. From that 
moment her interest naturally reached out for 
variations in the scale with which she was already 
quite familiar. 
Notation Deferred.—As has already been pointed 
out in Chapter II, Notation should be postponed 
until after the child has had wide experience in 
making music. The use of all types of instru- 
ments makes this deferring of modern notation 
come as a matter of course, because, as the notes 
of the staff are produced differently on different 
instruments, the use of the same symbols for all 
would be too confusing to the child. 
As the child plays by imitation and by ear, no 
symbols whatever are needed in the beginning. 
The first thought of written signs usually comes 
when a child has made up a little song which he 
plays and would like to remember, and thinks he 
might forget. He knows that words can be writ- 
ten, and he also knows that the notes of his instru- 
ment are numbered; therefore it is quite simple to 
write the words and put the numbers under them
-P-A-G-E-161
      Correlation of Singing and Playing 119 
to show the tune; and so the record is safe. After 
a little drill in remembering what he composes, he 
easily forms the habit of writing down most of 
his original compositions, either with or without 
words, merely to preserve them. But even this 
simple system of number notation (without a staff) 
is not presented to him until the numbers have 
first been given musical meaning both with voice 
and instruments. These numbers may be applied 
to all primitive instruments without exception, and 
to modern ones as well, and yet they involve no 
complex symbols. 
After a child has had intelligent experiences in 
playing the different pulses of. music, he easily 
grasps the meaning of pulse signatures, but “key 
signatures” as yet mean nothing to him. If he 
composes a little melody and sets it down thus: 
An 8415? 20 | 1432" 1 — 
it is accurately recorded, the numbers giving at a 
glance the melody and the rhythm as well. In 
ordinary notation the rhythm would be expressed 
thus (four beats to a measure): 
Sead el ah ee el 
but the child’s simple symbols mean more to him, 
based, as they are, on his own experience. The    
-P-A-G-E-162
      120 Correlation of Singing and Playing 
  shapes of notes and note values may come later on, 
and these symbols may be placed in a line above 
the figures.” The interpretation of all symbols 
should be made first with the voice, the easiest and 
most direct approach to the child’s feeling for and 
understanding of them. Gradually, one at a 
time, the modern symbols may be brought into 
use, leaving the staff, which is most difficult for 
him, until by actual experience he realizes the need 
which the staff serves. 
It is, of course, as necessary for the student of 
music to know how to read music symbols as it is 
necessary for the student of literature to know how 
to read a language, and any training which does 
not involve the acquirement of this knowledge and 
practice as soon as the child is ready for it, fails to 
give him the access to musical literature that is 
everyone’s right and privilege. But in the above 
described plan, we have a process which puts real 
meaning into note-reading; which first gives the 
child an opportunity to learn in the natural way— 
by imitation; which gradually intellectualizes his 
experiences and allows him to acquire freedom in 
playing, with nothing to distract his mind from the 
musical thought he is trying to express; which gives 
him the thing before the symbol of it—the free

expression of the language before its written form; 
and which, through activities that hold his interest, 
leads him to acquire step by step, of his own accord, 
and without realizing its difficulty, an understand- 
ing of our highly involved and complex system of 
notation.

  CHAPTER VIII 
ORIGINAL COMPOSITIONS 
Nor only has original expression been encouraged 
from the beginning of my training for children, 
but composing has been a definitely prescribed 
activity in each phase of the work. It is my belief 
that the ability for original thought and action is 
best fostered in the earliest stages of any form of 
expression, for after habits of following conven- 
tional lines have been thoroughly established, it is 
very hard for the average person to break away 
into new and original ways. But when the entire 
field is new, and the child is so young that his 
ideas are as free to flow in one way as in another, 
it is not so difficult to form habits of finding ways 
of his own to express his ideas. So soon as one of 
my pupils has had an idea of his own, he has been 
urged to give it original expression, whether it be 
in dancing, singing, language, or playing. 
The original dances of the children have been 
touched upon in Chapter V.

Song improvisations really began in mere sing- 
ing conversations which any child who can talk 
may practice. The children greeted me and bade 
me good-bye in song, using absolute freedom in 
what they said and the melodies they employed. 
We conversed in song on any subject, at first 
without thought of form. Afterwards we “‘made 
up” little songs about things we saw and things we 
liked. I improvised songs in their presence about 
all kinds of things, and by means of their natural 
imitative tendency (contradictory though it may 
seem) they caught the spirit and habit of original 
improvising. It was not my aim to bring out any- 
thing of artistic value in the beginning, but merely 
to give the child freedom in letting his song flow, 
and to have him realize how easy improvisation is, 
and feel no constraint in attempting it. It must 
always be remembered that we do not wish to force 
the child’s powers and, fortunately, one cannot 
force a child in his original work. 
A few illustrations of the original work of little 
children may be of interest. These examples are 
not given as evidence of precocity or unusual 
power, but simply as the natural expressions of 
normal children under conditions that give them 
opportunity for free expression.

Little Katharine is just beginning to form the 
habit of improvising. She stood in the window in 
the country, a few days after her fourth birthday, 
listening to sounds from the woods. Suddenly she 
sang the little song shown in Music Plate I. 
Even if we had so desired, we could not have 
kept out of the realm of poetry, for rhythmic lan- 
guage is as truly a part of music as are any other 
rhythmic sounds. After chants and tuneful con- 
versations and improvisations without form or 
meter, like the above, the children gradually fell 
into the use of words with established meter, their 
rhythmic feeling finding expression in language as 
spontaneously as it did in dancing and playing. 
The following is an example of rhythmic free verse 
spontaneously created in the studio by Arthur 
(aged six) as he looked at a vase of flowers: 
The petals have fallen from the rose, 
But there are two buds left, 
And the leaves are nice and green. 
And the stems can drink the water up 
To make the petals grow again. 
Rhyme makes a strong appeal to the child, es- 
pecially to those whose Mother Goose experiences 
have tuned their ears to its charm, and the children 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
    Original Compositions 125 
naturally fell into its use, composing words with 
both meter and rhyme. Their poetic lines as- 
sumed balance in the same way that their melodies 
had taken form. 
As soon as Oren (aged eight) had finished mak- 
ing his twelve-note marimba, he made a poem and 
set it to music, and when he played this upon his 
marimba, he had a threefold piece of creative work, 
the instrument, the poem, and the melody. I 
give the words as an example of a child’s natural 
use of meter and rhyme in language. He called 
his poem “The Voice of Spring”’: 
Iam here! I am here! 
Summer days are very near. 
See the flowers all around 
On the green and grassy ground. 
See, the sun is shining bright, 
No gray clouds say snow to-night. 
One of the most natural forms of musical com- 
position for children is the setting of familiar 
rhymes to music. Most of the children already 
knew many Mother Goose rhymes when they came 
to me, and these old friends were soon linked up 
with their new experiences in melody. Sometimes 
they sang the familiar words to new tunes; some- 
times they played the melody on some instrument
-P-A-G-E-170
  126 Original Compositions 
merely following the words mentally, and some- 
times they sang as they played. Music Plate II 
gives a musical setting for “Goosey, Goosey, 
Gander,” which Dorianne (aged five) improvised 
at the glasses. 
The improvising of melodies on the different 
instruments began as soon as the children could 
use the simplest. percussion instruments. The 
training in this consisted mainly of letting the 
children play freely; of making them conscious of 
the melodies they had played; of guiding them to a 
realization of form in their expressions; and of 
helping them to remember their compositions in 
parts and as wholes. At first, of course, they could 
not remember what they had improvised. To 
relieve this difficulty, I gave them exercises in 
improvising phrases that were no longer than they 
could remember and play again in exactly the same 
way. For instance, a child would improvise a 
phrase, and be required to repeat it accurately. If 
he could not do this, he must try a shorter phrase, 
or still shorter one, until he could remember one 
phrase perfectly. Then, a second phrase and its 
repetition, and a combination of the two phrases; 
and so on through his composition. When he was
-P-A-G-E-171
  Original Compositions 127 
sure that a phrase or a composition was in the form 
he wished it to remain, he was allowed to write it 
down in the simple notation as explained in Chap- 
ter VII; or, if he was unable to write I recorded it 
for him. Often a child stopped in the middle of a 
composition to write down something that pleased 
him, lest he lose it; and sometimes, rather than dis- 
turb a thought that was flowing easily, I stood near 
and caught on paper an entire improvisation as it 
was played. Frequently, after a pleasing melody 
had been made, the child composed words to fit 
it, making it into a song. 
Alva’s Harp Improvisation is a fair example of 
melody that flows spontaneously from the child’s 
fingers, without thought of words. Alva, aged 
six, and in the first year of her study, stood by the 
harp waiting for something, and without warning 
I heard the simple little tune which is given in 
Music Plate III without any hesitation, except a 
little in the last line. 
One day little Jane (aged six) walked across the 
studio with the air of a quaint little Mid-Victorian 
lady, and in keeping with the picture she pre- 
sented to the eye, improvised on the glasses a 
little old-fashioned gavotte. See Music Plate IV. 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  128 Original Compositions 
Often the children employed more than one form 
of improvisation at the same time, as the words and 
melody of asong. Bill began his lessons at three 
years of age. His first improvisation in both song 
and dance, were formless, childish expressions, nat- 
ural to all children at that age. He gradually 
learned to sing in tune, and was very fond of mak- 
ing melodies on all simpleinstruments. Later,these 
different outlets for original expression were united, 
and he would compose a song, singing and playing 
it atthesame time. Asa specific example of this, 
I append the “Green Bird” (see Music Plate V), 
which he composed at the age of five and a half 
years, at the psaltery, singing the song, composing 
both words and melody, and playing it all at the 
same time. The spontaneous amalgamation of 
these activities, having begun so early in his life, 
had acquired for him a new language in which 
instrument, hand, voice, and mind were one. 
It is interesting to see how the child’s personality 
is expressed in his compositions. In evidence of 
this, I add another “Green Bird” (see Music 
Plate VI) by Margaret, aged six. The stimulus 
for these two compositions was exactly the same— 
the picture of a bird with brilliant green plumage

—but the children’s reactions being different, the 
compositions took on entirely different characters. 
The children enjoyed not only their own com- 
positions, but one another’s as well, and often when 
one child composed something very attractive, the 
other children wanted to learn to play it also. The 
older children harmonized their own compositions; 
and sometimes I harmonized the original melodies 
of the younger children so they could be played in 
parts, which delighted them very much. 
Thinking it may be of interest to some of the 
teachers who read these pages, I add below two pro- 
grams given by practically the same group of chil- 
dren in two consecutive years in the form of concerts 
to their families and friends. All the numbers were 
composed by the children and played by them, 
either as solos or as ensemble. The piano num- 
bers on the first program may seem out of place in 
company with such simple instruments, but these 
two children who were studying improvisation at 
the piano had, I felt, a distinct contribution to an 
original program. It may be seen that the home- 
made violin, monochord, and cello of the first pro- 
gram have been replaced in the second program 
by modern stringed instruments.

CHAPTER IX 
A WORD ABOUT RECITALS 
Pusuic musical recitals may be either helpful or 
harmful to children. From the teacher’s stand- 
point they are necessary, for she must have some 
way of showing the public what she is doing in 
order that she may come in touch with those who 
need her services, and that she may thrive in her 
profession. Parents, too, usually consider them 
necessary for their own information; and both 
parents and teachers regard public recitals as a 
necessary means of overcoming stage-fright and 
self-conscious tendencies in the child. 
As a matter of fact recitals do not always help 
the child to play without nervousness, and when 
experience in recital playing does help one to play 
his best without embarrassment, it is too often 
because of self-confidence resulting from flattery 
and applause. Not always does it bring about an 
ease which is the result of an absorbed interest in 
the performance. But of course it all goes back to 
134
-P-A-G-E-183
  A Word About Recitals 135 
the motive behind our work. If we teach for pro- 
fessional reputation and if pupils practice for the 
approval of an audience or for mother’s praise, 
the recital seems a great success when those things 
are realized. The more public approval a child 
receives, the more his sense of power grows into 
vanity, and his ease in playing is not always from 
self-forgetfulness, but often from the hypnotic 
power of self-conceit, the fear of the audience hav- 
ing been overcome by the courage of egotism. 
There is obviously a great power for good in 
having children play for others in all stages of their 
study, and if a child can acquire enough experience 
to give him the habit of playing freely for others 
without exalting his personality and feeding his 
vanity, this experience is greatly to be desired. 
Parents often misunderstand the effects of praising 
the child’s playing, and I have known children to 
pout after coming home from a recital until both 
father and mother had praised their performances. 
From the very beginning of a child’s experiences in 
playing for his parents, it is much better that they 
should show their appreciation by speaking intelli- 
gently of the music rather than of how well he 
played it. If parents have the habit of keeping the 
child’s person in the foreground when he plays, it
-P-A-G-E-184
136 A Word About Recitals 
will be very hard for that child ever to forget him- 
self in playing for others. Parental pride should 
be restrained or redirected in the interest of the 
child. 
I have made several experiments in the form 
of recitals, but I do not profess to have solved 
the problem. These experiments, however, have 
seemed helpful to my pupils and I pass the sug- 
gestions on. 
Holding ideals of the simplicity and intimacy of 
music, my first recitals for any group of children 
are always “family affairs,” that the children may 
first learn to play for their natural audience, the 
family. Children of two or three congenial families 
are often grouped together for their concerts, and 
as much home atmosphere brought into them as 
possible. These intimate family concerts come 
frequently during the year, and each time the 
children prepare the program, planning whatever 
they think the family would most enjoy. 
Much ensemble singing and playing are worked 
into these recitals, for I believe that ensemble 
work is the surest way to help a child acquire the 
habit of forgetting himself in public playing, 
through his interest in the thing he is doing. 
Often a special concert is arranged as a compli-

  26. A Young Orpheus
-P-A-G-E-186

-P-A-G-E-187
        A Word About Recitals 137 
ment to some family memper. One of my groups 
had several children in it who were related to 
each other, having the same grandfather. A 
concert for grandfather’s birthday was arranged 
as a special treat for him, and only the families 
of this group were present. Each child thought of 
his playing as a birthday contribution to grandpa, 
and although the concert was carried out in regular 
concert form and order (“to make it easier for 
grandpa”’) they all seemed to be thinking of their 
contribution to him, not of themselves, and played 
with unconscious ease. 
Christmas surprises to their families in the form 
of concerts arranged especially for them have given 
the children much wholesome pleasure, with the 
ever present idea of “giving”’ behind their efforts. 
In these, also, congenial families and friends were 
combined, in order to keep the feeling of intimacy 
in the concerts. The programs of these concerts 
varied according to the children’s plans. Some- 
times they consisted principally of singing and 
dancing; sometimes all forms of their activities 
were introduced, and sometimes the programs 
consisted entirely of original compositions. 
After the children had had experience in playing 
for their families, I asked the parents to bring 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
    
    138 A Word About Recitals 
friends who, they thought, would really enjoy our 
concerts, and the children seemed to grow quite 
naturally into playing for larger audiences. As 
a precaution, I requested the parents and friends 
(in the children’s absence) to guard carefully 
against telling the children that they played well, 
but rather to speak of their enjoyment of the 
numbers played, keeping the children’s minds on 
the pleasure-giving side of the concert. 
The kind of recitals that teachers give deter- 
mines, to a large extent, the ideals of the general 
public in regard to the musical training of children, 
for it is through recitals that the teacher reaches 
out beyond her studio. I look forward with 
eagerness to the day when family concerts are the 
fashion, and when one’s attempts at playing are 
not discouraged because one cannot play in public; 
when fewer students are motivated by the dream of 
virtuosity, and more people, everywhere, play for 
the love of it.

CHAPTER X 
THE PLACE OF CREATIVE MUSIC IN EDUCATION 
Wuart is to be the outcome of all this? The aim 
of “Creative Music” is to place the child in such 
relation to the manifold Art of Music as will enable 
the study and employment of that Art to serve 
in its fullest capacity the purposes of education. 
A complete education demands the development 
‘of the greatest possible independence of thought 
and action that is consistent with the finest social 
adjustment; it also includes technical skill, whole- 
some direction of the emotions, and appreciation 
of beauty. )\ If an individual’s knowledge and 
powers of ‘thinking have been so developed 
that he has the greatest possible independence of 
the thoughts of others; if his own mental and 
physical and spiritual resources are so great that 
he can be free to act as he thinks, and if he has 
the skill to do it well; if all this power is balanced 
by the finest social adjustment, with all that that 
phrase implies; if he has a keen appreciation of 
141 
  hey Lf Y3 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  142 Place of Creative Music in Education 
beauty; and if he directs his emotional force into 
channels of wholesome expression, then that 
individual’s education has prepared him for living. 
All that we do for our children is, in some way 
or other, meant to enrich their lives and prepare 
them for the experiences which life has in store for 
them, and most of us feel that musical training 
comes in for a share of that preparation. But I 
wonder if many of us realize how largely the Art 
of Music, in its broad sense, can contribute to 
education. dt has a power of its own that no 
other art or study can claim—a power so elemental 
that even animals are affected by it, and the child 
too young to notice any other art is strongly 
influenced by music. \At the same time it is 
the most transcendental of the arts, through 
[its abstract quality being capable of lifting the mind and emotions to higher planes of thought 
and feeling. | Its force is so deeply rooted, so 
powerful; its history so interesting and its field 
so wide; it has such manifold resources and crosses 
so many other lines of man’s growth and achieve- 
ment, that I can think of no other study so rich in 
possibilities for the development of the individual 
and wit)

of education I have not lost sight of the fact that 
childhood is short and that there are many other 
things of great importance in the child’s program; 
and out of the large field of music’s development 
I have endeavored to select those things which are 
essential to a comprehensive understanding and 
those which will give the most in return for effort 
and time expended on them. In this chapter I 
shall take up the different phases of the work and 
discuss some of the educational results which I hope — 
to have children gain by each phase. _ 
A—The Making of Instruments. 
When the idea came to me of having children 
first employ activities suggested by the course of 
primitive man in music,’ at the same time came 
the thought that they would have to make their 
own instruments, for of course primitive man had 
to make his instruments, and it would be 
impossible for us to know what early man knew, 
to feel what he felt, to discover what he discovered, 
t This work does not attempt to support or discuss the once popular 
Recapitulation Theory. The natural evolution of music, however, does 
give a line of progression from simple forms upward, which is especially 
suited to the growing capacities of the child. This historical back- 
ground has supplied the field from which I have selected material ac- 
cording to the child’s natural reactions rather than according to any 
succession of race experiences, and with no concern about the disputed 
points between musical historians.
-P-A-G-E-196

144 Place of Creative Music in Education 
or to develop as he developed, unless we also used our 
hands and found out through experience what were 
his problems, his discoveries, and his joys. My ex- 
periments have strengthened the belief that this 
form of work contributes to real and basic musical 
development and to the child’s broader education 
as well. 
A child’s hands are the tools with which to build 
even his mental structure; they ache to be making 
something, and his mind is never so active as when 
his hands are doing a piece of constructive work 
that interests him. Every nail a child drives and 
every stroke of his saw is building up his mentality 
and character as surely as the instrument is being 
made. The value of constructive handwork, and 
of action in every phase of his development is 
emphasized by all modern psychologists and edu- 
cators, and they are agreed that brain learning 
which is not codrdinated with hand learning misses 
the greater part of its power. Of what avail is it 
for the brain to conceive an idea if the hand cannot 
bring it forth in living form? Thought separated 
from action is more than useless; it encourages a 
wasting of emotional power. : 
Xx Children possess the healthy instinct of con- 
structiveness. They love to handle materials and  
-P-A-G-E-197
    Place of Creative Music in Education 145 
tools, and to effect changes in material. When a 
child makes an instrument, the activity supplies 
its own drive. If the motive behind the work is 
something outside the piece of work he is doing, 
he is subject to the distraction of that motive. But 
in the manufacture of an object which he is going to 
use, the motive is held together in the very work 
under his hands, and this drive, inherent in that 
special activity, carries it forward. To make 
a musical instrument strikes an elemental note that 
interests—that fascinates—every child. I have 
never seen children show greater delight in any 
constructive work than in the making of musical 
instruments. The eagerness to know how it will 
sound, and the creative joy of making something 
with a voice—something that will ‘“‘talk back” to 
its maker—can not accompany the making of 
many other things. 
The thrill of successful accomplishment in instru- 
ment making stimulates other creative work to a 
remarkable degree. The child naturally feels that 
if he has made such a wonderful and useful thing 
as this, of course he can make other wonderful and 
useful things. And since he has made his own 
instrument, how natural to want to make up his 
own tunes to play on it! Any child loves the 
10
-P-A-G-E-198
  
  146 Place of Creative Music in Education 
object of his own handiwork. When he has madea 
musical instrument he loves to handle it, to play on 
it, to improvise on it, and thus a subtle intimacy is 
established between the child and his instrument 
that goes over into all music—for his work covers 
all types of instruments. ' His close relationship 
to music is preserved, for these activities keep his 
instincts involved in his musical experiences, 
instead of having some form of musical knowledge 
superimposed upon him. 
In the making of an instrument, gratification 
comes at every stage in the process; every strip 
sawed to the right length and glued where it 
belongs, every surface sand-papered, gives him 
a realization of something accomplished, and the 
“why” can be realized at every step. Not only 
does he feel joy and self-respect in having con- 
structed something useful, but he is also conscious 
of a power which is a wholesome outlet for his 
natural egotism. If a child’s wish to feel his own 
power is not realized in constructive work of some 
kind, he will usually ‘“‘take it out” in feeling his 
power over other people, or, perhaps, over the cat. 
When you first learned to cook an egg and make 
toast, you probably experienced a feeling of great 
independence. No matter what happened to the
-P-A-G-E-199
  Place of Creative Music in Education 147 
cook, now, you would not starve; and it probably 
stimulated you to want to be even more independ- 
ent. This feeling comes also to the child who 
makes his own musical instrument. If all the 
violin makers in the world were to quit work, he 
would not want for a fiddle to play, and he is also 
quite independent of the price of violins. © Thus his 
sense of independence grows. 
By the time he has made all types of instruments 
he knows their mechanical construction, and also 
the principle of the mechanical construction of all 
modern orchestral instruments and how they were 
developed; and knowing them, he values, appreci- 
ates, and enjoys them more. In varying degree, 
according to the child, he has acquired“mechanical 
skill, hand control in the use of tools, and also 
accuracy in handwork, for in many instruments the 
parts must fit together with great accuracy—‘ just 
so”’—if the instrument is to be a success. He has 
exercised both persistence and patience, for many 
instruments require a long time to make, with 
intervals in between for the glued parts to dry. Of 
his own accord he has employed his power of con- 
centration. One has only to watch a child at work 
on an instrument to realize how thoroughly his 
whole being is concentrated on what he is doing.  
-P-A-G-E-200
  148 Place of Creative Music in Education 
“Tt is intense effort which educates,” as Thorndike 
says. 
Work of this nature rouses and stimulates the 
child’s love of mental adventure. He has the right 
to develop his own resources through exploration 
and experiment, and this opens the way for him to 
the discovery of facts. These experiences offer 
training in general principles which he may broadly 
apply, and such experiences tend to make him better 
able to attack new problems and manage them toa 
more successful issue. In this constructive work 
one of the problems he must meet is that of material 
for his instruments. Primitive man did not have 
access to a factory for ready prepared material and 
neither have we. The child must use his imagi- 
nation and see in the everyday things about him, 
material which he can adapt to his needs. If the 
butter tub is not empty, he must find something 
else; and if a coffee-can is all he can find, then he 
must contrive some way to make that answer the 
purpose. He must be resourceful in adapting 
simple means to useful ends, and keep his eyes open. 
When he goes to the woods, especially, he must be 
quick to perceive a musical possibility, for that is 
where primitive man found his richest treasures. 
As his experiences progress he will understand the

-P-A-G-E-203
Place of Creative Music in Education 149 
problems of early man; his powers of exploration 
and discovery will be enlarged and his thinking 
power stimulated. Since he must invent in order 
to accomplish, he must maintain a practical, inven- 
tive attitude. As he feels his way through the 
Science of Music, testing and applying what he 
discovers, making experiments in the Physics of 
Sound, he must maintain an experimental attitude; 
and taking cognizance of a new world of possibility 
open to him, he “learns by doing” and by definite 
thinking. His thoughts take visible form in his 
instruments, and he can test their validity imper- 
sonally. The satisfactions of accomplishment are 
a drive to further action. The man who builds a 
bridge of stone for himself and others to pass over, 
will never be content to be a mere dreamer. 
The construction of musical instruments necessi- 
tates the intelligent correlation of music with the 
physics of sound and the manual arts. It also 
touches the history of different peoples, their 
practices in instrument making, and the world’s 
geography and natural resources. The more a 
child’s knowledge and experiences in different 
fields are brought into harmony and _ corre- 
lated each with the others, the broader and 
more unified his education becomes, the deeper is 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  
150 Place of Creative Music in Education 
his understanding, and the better his adjustment 
to life. I know of nothing which more directly 
and perfectly correlates art, science, and industry 
than the making of musical instruments. The 
craftsman who would make a musical instrument 
must know something of the art before he can plan 
the style and capacity of his instrument; he must 
know something of the different kinds of woods, 
strings, etc., before he can wisely select his 
material; he must know how to use his hands and 
tools also before he can construct it; and he must 
know something of science and must apply its 
principles before he can “make it work.” 
Il.—The Use of Primitive Instruments. 
Thethought of using primitive instruments came 
to me in response to an urgent need for some way 
to gratify the little child’s wish to make music. 
And I found that it did gratify his wish—his love 
for playing them even exceeded my expectations. 
One day in the studio little Katharine, aged three, 
\realized that she could play on the glasses, with 
correct rhythm and melody, the first two phrases of 
“Hop my Pony.’ She beamed with the satis- 
faction of real accomplishment. “Let me do it 
again!” she exclaimed, and when that was finished,
-P-A-G-E-205
ST ee ee ee RE nT ey See Mere RTM Ce en errr. ee 
Place of Creative Music in Education 151 
“Again!” she begged. I stood near and let her 
do as she wished, and without a word from anyone, 
she played it all through fifteen times without 
stopping! But this is only one of countless 
instances that indicate the little child’s love of 
making melody on simple instruments, and his 
persistence in musical experience. Everyone can 
see the importance, says Thorndike, of “being able 
to be satisfied: by the good elements of what one 
produces” in the process of learning. I feel that 
such satisfaction in accomplishment is especially 
valuable to little children. 
/ One’s real development always comes from 
experience. Musical experiences are essential to 
musical growth. Those of us who merely listen 
are not the musical ones; we must handle the 7 
materials and make the sounds ourselves to be 
musical. But, of course, so long as the piano and 
the violin are the only instruments we teach our   children; then the very young child—excepting, of 
course, the especially gifted one—must stand out- 
side the pale of instrumental experience, and oo 
on with hungry, lo’ longing eyes, or else try it with 
unhappy results. But. if we give him-music which 
is within his own grasp instead of expecting him to 
understand ours, we shall find him an enthusiastic
-P-A-G-E-206
  152 Place of Creative Music in Education 
player. And he needs to play while he is yet too 
young for the difficult instruments. 
Modern psychologists attach a great deal of 
importance to the influence of the first five or six 
years of the child’s life, for during that time is 
shaped the pattern for his emotional life. Music 
touches our emotions more deeply than other arts 
or studies, and the music of the first five or six 
years should be so planned that the child’s 
emotions and his attitude toward all music will re- 
sult in the most wholesome development. The in- 
fluences in his life at this age determine, perhaps 
in greater measure than we like to think, the 
things that will move him most and stimulate him 
most; they determine his tendencies of mind and 
his attitude toward things. The preservation of 
the child’s natural enthusiasm for music greatly 
accelerates the development of skill; and later on, 
this enthusiasm will carry him over that stage of 
acquiring technique, which would otherwise seem 
to be the dullest routine. Since the acquirement of 
skill and understanding is so influenced by one’s 
attitude towards the subject, and since the attitude 
is established so early, we can easily see how 
important is the training of these first few years, 
especially in music. Often, without our knowing
-P-A-G-E-207
    Place of Creative Music in Education 153 
it, there is formed in childhood an attitude towards 
music which greatly hinders musical power in 
after years, and sometimes even destroys enjoy- 
ment of the art. The acquisition of facts, such as 
the multiplication table, can come at any time, and 
it has been proved to us that a child can start his 
academic education at nine years of age and soon 
catch up with the child who had several years the 
start of him. But his tendencies and emotional re- 
actions begin early and must be carefully guarded. 
This is the time to form habits of musical expres- 
sion, to establish associations and give experiences 
that will link up with other fundamental experi- 
ences and make music something vital and tangible 
for him. This early intimacy with music he will 
never lose, and it will be a means of happiness and 
comfort to him all his life. 
These early years of the child’s development 
correspond to the stage of primitive music and the 
simplest of instruments. The music of the child- 
hood of the race belongs to him while he is yet a 
little child. This is the time he must sing and 
dance, and play upon instruments that make no 
technical demands, and only such melodies as his 
small brain can understand. His intellectual 
growth is gradual. As the simple elementary
-P-A-G-E-208
    154 Place of Creative Music in Education 
capacities of his mind are enlarged by experiences 
suited to those capacities, we can gradually lead 
him to larger and larger musical experiences. But 
if his musical education is to be at all effective, it 
must suit his capacities as determined by the stage 
of his development. 
The art teacher does not give a child a stretched 
canvas to paint on, but the simplest smooth sur- 
face she can find—a big sheet of paper or a sidewalk 
or a blackboard—and there the child freely ex- 
presses, in bold grotesque figures, the primitive 
art thatisin him. The drawings of the six-year-old 
child show him to be in a stage of artistic develop- 
ment analogous to the stage of tom-toms, simple 
pipes, and most primitive stringed instruments. 
His musical as well as his drawing experiences 
must be in the stage that corresponds to his general 
development. ' 
Heretofore in most of our instrumental training 
for children, we have forced the child to skip a very 
important and a very broad stage in his indigenous 
musical evolution. We have urged him while still 
in swaddling clothes to take on adult culture, as 
one who would try to teach a savage to drive an 
automobile before he has had any simpler experi- 
ences with machinery. The use of primitive and

-P-A-G-E-211

other instruments may fill this gap so that no links 
are missing in the chain of his experiences from his 
most rudimentary capacity as an infant to his full- 
grown adult powers. 
It has been my aim to make music so simple that 
every child may be able to play. The Greeks have 
shown us that the use of music may be made 
universal if it is only simple enough; and if we ask 
for essential simplicity, we too may make music 
the possession of many—not the privilege of a 
few. But its present complexity of training keeps 
all but the veneer away from the masses. Why 
should singing or dancing or playing be reserved 
for those who seem to have a special gift? Every 
child should have much experience in all three 
of these things. The possession of talent may be 
a large factor in what a child shall play, but cer- 
tainly not in whether a child shall play. It is my 
belief that somewhere in the wide scope of music, 
somewhere along the path of its development, 
there lies an instrument suited to the capacity of 
every child—of everyone, for that matter—if we 
could only find it. What better way is there to 
find it than to have the child follow the entire path 
from the very beginning? And if his natural 
capacity for musical experience is so limited that he
-P-A-G-E-212
  156 Place of Creative Music in Education 
cannot find pleasure in playing anything more 
difficult than the drum and a tin fife, then those 
are his instruments; let him play them until, by 
growth from experience, he is ready for something 
a little more advanced. And experience will de- 
velop his capacity and lift his musical level. 
Mr. Seashore has made a valuable contribution 
to the musical field in enabling us to find even be- 
fore study, whether or not a child has the keenness 
of sense discrimination that will justify specialized 
musical training. He has also pointed out that the 
power of sense discrimination (in pitch, for in- 
stance) cannot be much improved by training. 
Other psychologists also claim that sensory dis- 
crimination cannot be greatly improved beyond a 
certain point by training. Mr. Seashore’s contri- 
bution will probably save much agonizing over 
instruments ill suited to one’s capacity, and much 
time uselessly spent, for it is evident that it is 
useless to expect some persons to play certain in- 
struments that require keen pitch discrimination, 
as for instance, the violin: 
But does it then follow that these less gifted 
children are to be denied all musical expression? 
There are instruments that lie wholly within their 
capacity—instruments with fixed pitch and requir-
-P-A-G-E-213
          Place of Creative Music in Education 157 
ing no great keenness of sense perception and no 
great technical skill to play. This is the field for 
them. Why not let them occupy it? If a child’s 
sense of perception in music is very low he may be 
barred from high artistic expression with all types 
of wind and stringed instruments, but there are 
stili left for him the percussion instruments of fixed 
tone, and the experience of making and experiment- 
ing with wind and stringed instruments. There are 
also many stringed instruments which, when already 
in tune, require no great keenness of ear to play. 
The child of no talent needs to play as much as 
anyone else; sometimes his need is greater. More- 
over, who can say to what extent musical capacity 
can be cultivated, if we only begin early enough? 
I believe that it is only a matter of degree, and that 
every normal person has some capacity which can 
be enlarged if we find its level and build upon it 
from that point, especially if we start very early in 
the child’s life. In my attempts to make music 
simple enough for every child to experience, one of 
my greatest compensations has been in seeing the 
so-called unmusical child beam with pleasure when 
he finds that he can really play something—when 
he sees that music-making is not a hopeless thing 
even for him.
-P-A-G-E-214

It is my opinion that too much ado has been 
me over the talented children, and that the. 
others have—beettoo_much neglected. Conse- 
‘quently, we usually find the talented child with an 
over-developed ego, and after all, not any hap- 
pier than if he had had no talent. Professional 
musicians are growing more and more numerous 
and simple home-made music is quite out of 
fashion. 
Dr. Grosse (in The Beginnings of Art) states 
that “‘the sense of rhythm has undoubtedly been 
developed through the primitive instrumental 
music.” It has been my observation that the use 
of such instruments is of great value in cultivat- 
ing not only the sense of rhythm, but the tonal 
sense as well, and is a definite aid in the child’s con- 
trol of his singing voice. 
It is by the use of these simple instruments that 
very young children can have their first experiences 
in ensemble playing. I find that some children as 
young as four years of age adjust themselves well 
to the playing of others, and all children love 
ensemble playing. A grown-up orchestra would 
scorn the use of such instruments as flageolets, 
ocarinas, and psalteries, but these things have 
their place in the music of the world, and should
-P-A-G-E-215
          Place of Creative Music in Education 159 
be used where they best serve their purpose. They 
belong to childhood. 
To some who have not employed training of this 
kind for children, it may appear that the use of 
primitive and crude instruments may retard the 
development of the child’s sense of beauty; it may 
seem out of keeping with the present day idea of 
surrounding the child with perfected forms of 
beauty of all kinds. But in reality I have found 
only cultural effects. The fact that the instru- 
ments are constantly progressing toward more 
refined means of expression seems to give even a 
very young child the impetus of reaching toward 
an ever-growing ideal which is not so far above 
him that he can not understand it. The progres- 
sion of these instruments is also responsible for a 
keener appreciation of the difference between the 
crude and the refined, and the child who follows 
this progression comes into an appreciation of the 
higher forms of music that is wider and more 
discriminating from being based on experience in 
all the stages leading thereto. The enjoyment and 
appreciation of any art is greatest when it is based 
on active and intelligent experiences in the develop- 
ment of that art, and my experience has led me 
to believe that the children who follow the
-P-A-G-E-216
       160 Place of Creative Music in Education 
  intellectual processes of music’s development will 
also show a similar development in taste and 
appreciation of beauty. 
Literature has its Mother Goose, that children 
may enjoy things suited to the childish mind. 
Primitive songs and instruments are music’s 
Mother Goose, not for museums and collectors to 
hoard, but for children to enjoy. 
Ill.—Why Creative Music Includes all Types of 
Instruments. 
No attempt to give the child a real understand- 
ing of the development of music would be effectual 
without giving him experience in the use of all 
types of instruments. His intellectual under- 
standing of the wide scope of the art, of how it 
grew from small beginnings, and of how our modern 
instruments were finally evolved, depends upon the 
actual use of these instruments. The Physics of 
Sound in its varying manifestations has a practical 
meaning for him if he uses the materials that 
demonstrate its principles. His experiments will 
enable him to hold a scientific attitude towards 
music as a science, while his use of the instruments 
will at the same time foster an appreciative attitude

-P-A-G-E-219
Place of Creative Music in Education 161 
toward music as an art, and enable him the better 
to appreciate and enjoy all beauty. 
By using all types of instruments the child’s 
interest naturally goes out to the people who first 
developed each type, and a wide correlation of 
other subjects may result. 
How better than by experience in the use of 
all types of instruments can the child come into 
an understanding and appreciation of modern 
orchestral instruments, and orchestral music? To 
have known and maintained pleasant relations with 
a person’s ancestors gives one a feeling of intimate 
understanding of the person himself, and an 
affectionate interest in him. The same thing holds 
with musical instruments. The child who has 
made a wheat-straw oboe and played upon it will 
recognize the same reedy quality of tone when the 
modern oboe appears in a Dvor4k Symphony, and 
the kinsmen of his cigar-box-fiddle will speak to 
him intimately from the violin stands. In the 
presence of the great Orchestra he is in a beloved 
country of familiar voices where more than he 
could ever dream, comes true. 
Perhaps the most important result from having a 
child use all types of instruments is that of enabling 
him to find out by experience—the only sure way— 
In 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
162 Place of Creative Music in Education 
what is his most congenial instrument. Many a 
child wastes hours of labor struggling with an 
instrument for which he is naturally unsuited; 
“whereas the right instrument would give him 
greater joy with less effort. Even aside from their 
physical and musical capacity, children, as well as 
grown-ups, have individual preferences in regard 
to instruments, and experience with all types will 
make it possible for the child to choose intelligently 
that one which appeals to him most. It is of as 
much importance in one’s artistic life to find the 
right musical instrument as it is in one’s business 
life to find the right vocation. 
By following in one’s playing the development 
from simple to more complex instruments, the 
codrdination of hand and mind is more complete, 
and the development of this codrdination, as well 
as one’s musical growth, is more natural and 
thorough. 
Varied musical experiences lead to generaliza- 
tions which are full of meaning. In this phase of 
Creative Music there is obtained a Positive Trans- 
fer of Training, because the experiences over- 
lap and strengthen the associations. Principles 
once learned may be applied in many different 
ways. A melody is not associated with any parti-
-P-A-G-E-221
  Place of Creative Music in Education 163 
cular instrument; it is an arrangement of tones as 
to pitch, rhythm, form, and feeling, that may be 
applied to different kinds of instruments. In 
studying the tone qualities of different instruments, 
the ear is developed to its greatest acuteness, and 
in trying out different melodies in different qualities 
of tone, the sense of fitness as to music and instru- 
ment and the selective power are exercised. 
Another consideration is the variety in skill to be 
thus obtained. To cite an example: One day I 
gave a new song to little Margaret, aged seven, and 
timed her by the clock to see how long it would 
take her to learn it perfectly. It was a little 
English folk song of four phrases, and I taught it to 
her by rote, as she knew nothing of note reading. 
In nine minutes from the time I first began singing 
this song to her, she had learned to sing it perfectly 
and had played it correctly, without a single 
inaccuracy as to note or rhythm, on nine instru- 
ments, namely, the glasses, Swiss bells, sleigh-bells, 
psaltery, lyre, flageolet, fiddle, harp, and marimba, 
transferring the melody just as easily to one instru- 
ment as to another. This was by no means an 
unusual effort or feat. At this lesson I just 
happened to time her from curiosity. 
It is interesting to watch Bill—aged five—make
-P-A-G-E-222
    164 Place of Creative Music in Education 
his first attempt at applying a newly learned 
melody to different instruments. By watching 
the movements of his hands, you can almost see his 
brain working; see him correct a false movement 
before the note is actually sounded, and hurry to 
the next to catch the note on the proper beat, per- 
haps stopping a moment and humming to clear up 
a difficult phrase. The look of complete absorp- 
tion on his face convinces you that his intelligence 
is back of every movement, and that his attention 
is held by natural, self-driven interest. 
If the study of different instruments were more 
universal, the members of a family would have an 
opportunity to strengthen home ties in chamber 
music combinations, group playing among friends 
would be the source of untold pleasure, and sen- 
sational “movies” would not be such a frequent 
necessity in the lives of young people. It is by the 
diffusion of the knowledge of all types of instru- 
ments that we will be able to furnish a wholesome 
and constructive emotional outlet for everybody. 
In this connection I wish to give the division of 
Wind Instruments aspecial paragraph, for they have, 
as I believe, a particular value in education and have 
been especially neglected. To play any breath- 
blown instrument well, requires breath control,
-P-A-G-E-223
  Place of Creative Music in Education 165 
which means conscious or unconscious control of 
the diaphragm, intercostal muscles, and other 
muscles of the trunk and chest cavity, and these 
are not directly involved in playing percussion and 
stringed instruments. Breath control makes self- 
control easier. One of the most direct ways of 
gaining poise, equanimity, and serenity is by proper 
breath control. The Hindus have for hundreds 
of years recognized this truth, and as we know, 
have accomplished marvelous things through the 
use of that knowledge. 
It is said that horn and trumpet players are 
longer lived than other people, no doubt because 
of the power of these activities to keep the lungs 
in fine condition. In this connection I recall an 
incident which seems to indicate that even a 
limited use of wind instruments increases lung 
power. In acertain school the breathing capacity 
of all the pupils was taken. Two of these children, 
in different grades, had had experience in playing 
upon simple wind instruments in my studio, and 
each of these made the highest record for lung 
capacity in her group. There were no apparent 
reasons why this should have been so except the 
fact that they had had those musical experiences. 
Wind instruments have a sympathetic power 
   
-P-A-G-E-224
    166 Place of Creative Music in Education 
that seems almost human. Next to one’s own 
voice they respond most quickly to one’s feelings, 
being operated by that great companion and 
servant of the emotions, the breath. A unique 
personal intimacy is established between the player 
and the instrument which he plays by the power 
of his breath. : 
Wind instruments require that full attention be 
paid to the tone, especially when one is just begin- 
ning to'use them. The breath pressure must be 
regulated to meet the requirements of the tone, for 
variations in pressure affect not only the volume, 
but often the pitch. . So mental concentration is 
necessary as well as careful listening. In playing 
the ocarina, for instance, the child must “think the 
tone” which he wishes to make, and adjust his 
breath force to make the tone true to the pitch he is 
thinking; otherwise he may be playing a half-step 
out of tune. It is interesting to observe that if 
one “thinks the tone,” the breath pressure seems 
to adjust itself reflexly for the production of that 
tone. 
All this probably sounds difficult for a child, 
but in reality children seem to adjust themselves 
to the requirements more easily than grown-ups; 
their reflex responses seem to serve them better,

and it is surprising how rapidly they acquire the 
necessary power of control if they begin on instru- 
ments that are simple enough. Besides, when a 
child begins wind instruments he has already had 
experience in playing. 
The contribution which these instruments make 
towards acquiring codrdination both in the physi- 
cal and the general sense, is very great. I have in 
mind one child of eight years who had naturally 
very poor physical codrdination. Her first 
attempts to play the flageolet made it seem quite 
hopeless. The instrument which, in playing posi- 
tion, must be held up by the fingers of both hands, 
with one end in the mouth, constantly fell into her 
lap, for her lips and hands seemed quite unable to 
operate together. But soon the lips learned to do 
their part, and gradually were added breath and 
finger control, and now at ten years of age, after 
having made and played upon all types of instru- 
ments within these two years, she has chosen a 
wind instrument, the flute, as the one she loves the 
best of all. 
In the use of all types of instruments technical 
training is deferred—Specialized training has no 
place in the curriculum of the young child, and this 
is particularly true in music. Five finger exercises   ~e
-P-A-G-E-228
  168 Place of Creative Music in Education 
and scales are the bane of the existence of many 
children who, because of these things, are slowly 
but surely building up negative reactions to some- 
thing that could yield them great service and 
happiness if those reactions were positive. 
The child sees no reasons, other than superficial 
ones, for technical exercises; he has no instinctive 
impulse towards them and they are not elemental 
enough to interest him. If the child’s experiences 
are to be truly constructive, they must be moti- 
vated by desires from the inside, not from outside 
persuasion; if he has no inner urge to acquire skill 
in playing an instrument, the time he spends in 
practice is more than wasted, for it warps the music 
that is in him. 
The spontaneity of one’s playing always suffers 
when technique has to be considered. Of all arts 
music is the most spontaneous, and in that very 
quality lies much of its power. But neither a 
child nor an adult can play freely, feeling what he 
plays, and playing what he feels, if he must think 
of hand position or mode of attack, or of how to 
manipulate several fingers at once. When simple 
instruments are used, no special technical training 
is necessary, and any fairly well codrdinated child 
has all the natural technique that is necessary in
-P-A-G-E-229
  Place of Creative Music in Education 169 
playing these. As he progresses to more difficult 
instruments his power grows with them, and when 
he reaches something that is hard to do, he natur- 
ally wishes to practice it until he overcomes the 
difficulty, and makes it go as easily as his other 
playing. Specialization should be the last stage in 
the child’s training in any subject, and in music 
there is yet time enough for it after the child has 
been saturated with all kinds of musical experi- 
ences—when, backed by intelligent understanding, 
he has chosen his special instrument. 
It is a sad sight to see a child of any age strug- 
gling with something that was meant for older hands 
and minds, even though he may be able to effect 
results. What will it profit a child to be able to 
play a Beethoven Sonata at the age of ten if it 
means that he has been given artificial stimulation 
and has spent hours of weary practice in order to do 
it? Many bright children may be drilled to do 
this, but it does not always mean that Beethoven 
will be a joy to them twenty years later. 
The musical training that permeates the heart is 
the training that is going to stay. The wish to 
play, the disposition to inquire further into music, 
and the habit of finding joy in the making of music 
are the things which will make the child musical, 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  170 Place of Creative Music in Education 
and not the technical skill that is drilled into him. 
If his love for playing is fed now, then later, after 
he has chosen his special instrument, he will see a 
reason and feel a desire for technical skill, and it 
will come easily because it will be motivated by its 
own inherent drive. 
   .—Dancing. 
/ The reasons for incorporating dancing in my 
music lessons were given in an earlier chapter. 
No one in these days has to be convinced of the 
educational value of Folk Dances; and dancing in 
its best sense has received so much encouragement 
from educators during the last twenty years, its 
beneficent effects have been proved so often, that 
it is not necessary for me to dilate upon its value. 
Tf one should ask how the special form of dancing 
indicated in Chapter V as a part of “Creative 
Music” serves the purposes of education, perhaps 
my first answering thought would be: It reunites 
twin-sister arts that have already been too long 
separated in early training; it gives to music its own 
natural foundation; restores the primeval intimacy 
of man and music; and unifies Art, Spirit, Mind, 
and Body. 
Since music began with rhythmic movement,

-P-A-G-E-233
Place of Creative Music in Education 171 
and has developed as a part of the dance and con- 
tributing to it, the presence of one always suggests 
the presence of the other. The child who has 
dancing experiences from the most elementary 
forms upward, is made more susceptible to music, 
and together the two arts may develop in him as 
one art, founded on the original, generic basis of 
rhythm. These experiences make it possible for 
him to preserve the natural inborn rhythmic sense 
and to develop his musical instincts in natural 
order, instead of forcing them too soon away from 
their native soil. First without form, then with 
gradually more and more formal complexity, the 
two may be correlated in every stage of devel- 
opment, each one helping and sustaining the 
other. 
To reach a complete understanding of music, 
one should have personal experience with dance 
rhythms and forms. One can feel the fullest intel- 
lectual and emotional response to a musical com- 
position only when it is possible for one’s nerves to 
add from former experience, a “motor interpretation 
and exhilaration.” 
Dancing involves great activity of both mind and 
body, and is perhaps the best illustration of men- 
tal and physical codrdination. A well developed
-P-A-G-E-234
  172 Place of Creative Music in Education 
sense of bodily rhythm also enables one to apply 
rhythmic motion and to conserve energy in many 
other manual activities. (See page 87.) 
Physical poise is a habit that can not be better 
acquired than through dancing, and this, as 
naturally as water flows down hill, reacts on the 
mind, generating habits of mental poise. Self- 
confidence is another result; and conservation of 
energy through precision of movement. The ad- 
vantage of physical freedom which dancing gives 
can hardly be overestimated, for an awkward, 
constrained body is hampered at every turn, in 
every phase of living. The nervousness of many 
musicians might be accounted for by their habits 
of concentrating on only one form of musical 
activity, and much of their tension and lack of 
poise could no doubt be counteracted by dances 
which would involve the entire body in muscular 
codrdination. Habits of dancing, too, formed in 
early childhood and continued through youth and 
maturity, keep one young in mind and body and 
spirit.

V.—Singing. 
That singing is a wholesome activity for people 
of all ages, no one will deny, and that it is a neces- 
sary phase of the child’s musical training, most 
educators believe. In Chapter V I have tried to 
show that the child’s singing should begin as early 
as possible, progressing hand in hand with his 
other musical experiences and directly correlated 
with them. 
In the earliest stages of music’s development, 
singing was closely associated with dancing, and d 
later, when instruments came into being, singing 
was king and the instrument only a subordinate. 
Song was also the medium for the expression of 
rhythmic language. 
There are many experiences which come to us 
that can not serve us constructively except through 
singing, and many emotions which the child can J 
not wholesomely express except through singing. 
No one can measure the amount of inspiration and 
stimulation toward endeavor that the child’s own 
singing gives him. It also gives him intimate 
experiences in beauty, and a consciousness of his 
power to create beauty. An example of the early 
enjoyment of song expression in the child’s own 
   
-P-A-G-E-236
174 Place of Creative Music in Education 
voice came to my notice recently when a baby of 
fourteen months sang the first line of Three Blind 
Mice over and over, her facial expression showing 
that she loved the sounds of her voice, even though 
she could come no nearer the words than to suggest 
them by the vowel sounds of e and i. Singing 
gives the child an appreciation and enjoyment of 
beauty that involves his mind, body, and feeling, 
and nourishes the power to create beauty, not only 
in reproducing songs of others, but in making songs 
of his own. 
If his singing begins early enough, he establishes 
a freedom of the voice which gives him much 
pleasure in after years, and leads to a wider free- 
dom of mind and body. The healthful aspect of 
singing is too well known to require discussion 
here. 
The correlation of singing with his other musi- 
cal work from the ground up, in connection with his 
use of instruments, makes the child’s musical de- 
velopment consecutive, easy, and logical. It is an 
aid to voice control in those children who have dif- 
ficulty in singing, and supplies a natural means of 
teaching children to play by ear. It cultivates ~ 
accuracy of voice, acuteness of ear, and habits of 
listening; it calls into use the full power of one’s
-P-A-G-E-237
  Place of Creative Music in Education 175 
sense of pitch, and helps the child to an intellectual 
appreciation of what he hears. 
The use of the simplest song forms makes it 
possible for every child to sing songs of his own 
world, and also gives every child melodies which 
he can play, no matter how low he stands in the 
scale of musicianship. Following these with the 
recorded folk-songs of childish peoples, and gradu- 
ally taking up those of peoples whose musical 
feeling sought a wider range and more complicated 
expression, the child naturally becomes saturated 
with folk-song literature, than which no better 
preparation can be given him for an appreciation of 
the world’s greatest music. 
hy I.—Original Composition. 
One of the most characteristic results of this plan 
of musical training is an impetus toward original 
work. Since the creative power is exercised from 
the beginning, and in every phase of the work—in 
dancing, singing, language, in the construction of 
instruments, and in playing them—the child forms 
very early the habit of improvising, and is not 
daunted by a suggestion to improvise upon any 
instrument that he knows how touse. For it is my 
belief that improvisation, like singing and other
-P-A-G-E-238
  176 Place of Creative Music in Education 
powers which many people consider as special gifts, 
is the outcome of early habits; and the child who 
begins in the earliest stages of his musical develop- 
ment to improvise songs and dances and instru- 
mental melodies, will grow as naturally into it as 
flowers turn to the sun, for the joy he takes in 
original work is all the stimulation he needs. And 
it is not difficult when one begins at the natural 
beginning. 
It is much easier for a very young child to 
improvise than to learn a set melody. All children 
love to do it, and it is a very simple matter to guide 
their haphazard experiments into tuneful form. 
Like all their other powers, this power to create 
also grows and becomes more refined, and their 
compositions gradually take on more pleasing 
forms and greater variety. Dances, rhythmic 
words, melodies alone, and songs combining words 
and melodies, give them a wide field for original 
work, and children love each phase of it. It gives 
them a sense of power which they love to exercise, 
and not only do they enjoy their work, but these 
experiences make them feel a keener appreciation 
for other and higher forms of music. 
Quite consistent with our unnatural ways of 
teaching music, many still think of composition as 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
    Place of Creative Music in Education 177 
a very advanced stage of musical work, and to 
them, the study of Harmony and Composition 
means that the student has gone into one of those 
far away, abstract fields into which the average 
music pupil may never hope even to glance. But 
this is only another case of our inversion of 
the natural procedure in music. When the entire 
growth of music is examined, we see that composi- 
tion comes before anything else in the line of play- 
ing. Primitive man improvised from the begin- 
ning—he had no music except what he created 
spentaneously—and but for this habit among later 
peoples we would never have had our beautiful 
folk-songs. Improvising in song and with his 
instrument came naturally and easily to primitive 
man and this is still the case with savages of to-day. 
Children, too, have this power in their early years, 
but it often becomes atrophied from disuse, or 
blocked by too much formality in their training. I 
know a professional musician who, as a child, 
improvised and composed lovely things, but who 
lost that power after years of advanced study, and 
she confessed to me that she felt that so much 
study of the compositions of others, to the exclusion 
of original work, had really destroyed her natural 
gift for composition.

Even while writing on this book, a case has come 
to my knowledge which is so pertinent that I 
venture to give a few of the facts relating to this 
young woman who is now a brilliant pianist of New 
York. At four years of age she played freely at 
the piano without any training whatever, and was 
considered a phenomenon. At five she improvised 
constantly, and composed a sonata and other 
things that were published. She was examined 
by several of the foremost musicians of the day, 
who pronounced her a second Mozart. She played 
throughout her native state (still at the age of five) 
programs of her own compositions. Through the 
force of circumstances she was without training, 
except for a few scattered months, up to the age 
of thirteen, and during this time she continued to

positions showing a natural and healthy develop- 
ment of idea. 
From her thirteenth to her eighteenth year she 
was with two teachers of international reputation 
and was given the best possible pianistic training 
according to the highest ideals of musical culture. 
She was grounded in German text-books of musical 
theory, and was saturated with musical classics 
and with all phases of the world’s best musical

literature. For the first two or three years of this 
study her creative impulse persisted, but gradually 
faded and died out. Although her pianistic and 
interpretative powers have grown to a marvelous 
degree, her great creative impulse was entirely 
crowded out by her study, and has never returned. 
Can it be that the strength of the creative im- 
pulse in the old masters was due to the fact that 
there was not so much musical literature for them 
to feed on? Shall we not think twice before we 
allow the child to consume all his mental power in 
studying the works of others, and leave no strength 
or time for his own creative work? Will it not 
mean more in his development to be able to create 
one lovely composition than to know accurately 
the details of all that Chopin ever wrote? 
VII.—Ensemble Playing. 
I know of no activity which can be more potent 
in the development of citizenship or has more to tol 
contribute to the real aims of education, than 
“children’s ensemble playing. This form of musi- / 
cal expression requires a fine adjustment to others, 
and at the same time, the most careful individual 
effort. It makes the child stand on his own feet 
and preserves his independence, whiléit fosters 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  180 Place of Creative Music in Education 
the idea of unity in common achievement. His 
independence can not be bought at a sacrifice of 
the total harmony, but at the same time, the total 
harmony depends upon the preservation of the 
individual. He must achieve by concentrated 
individual effort, and contribute the product of 
that achievement in the way that will best serve 
the common weal. He realizes, in a poignant way, 
his obligation to society when he hears the dis- 
cordant effect which results from playing carelessly 
or inaccurately; when he plays correctly, he feels 
the joyous and wholesome thrill of taking part 
in the making of something beautiful. He obeys 
laws, but his individuality is expressed and his 
egotism is not fostered. 
In ensemble work the child’s mental concentration 
must be great, so that he will not be disturbed by 
what others are playing. Only one who has played 
or sung with others and sustained a part different 
from theirs, can realize how much concentration 
this calls for. Even when all are playing in unison, 
every mind must be concentrated on the work. If 
one child lags behind, nobody will wait for him, and 
unless he has the ability to “catch in” at the right 
place, he is lost, and must drop out. It has been 
most interesting to-observe children, even little tots
-P-A-G-E-245

of five and six years, go through the early stages of 
ensemble playing, and see their mental concen- 
tration develop under one’s very eyes. At first 
they are often so disturbed by the playing of others 
that they stop after the first few notes and feel 
that “it’s no use to try.” Another effort per- 
haps brings them a little further, and they are 
encouraged. Soon they see a little fun in the 
combined sounds, and are interested to make 
greater efforts, and finally, when the melody is 
finished, and they have been able to keep abreast to 
the end, the exhilaration of successful accomplish- 
ment more than pays for all the work. Often I 
have seen a little child lose his place because his 
attention had been distracted for a moment, then 
by a conscious effort, bring his mind back, “‘catch 
in” at the right place, and finish with the others. 
(Of course only very short melodies can be used 
for ensemble work with very small children.) 
When a child can play even a simple melody with 
a group of other children, without a single note out 
of tune or out of time, using his eye, ear, muscles, 
and brain in perfect codrdination in contributing 
his part toward the creation of something beautiful, 
who can estimate the mental, ethical, and social 
value of it? 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
FX 
  182 Place of Creative Music in Education 
Confidence in one’s power to work with others 
is an inevitable result of ensemble playing, and the 
joy one takes in it, broadens one’s attitude towards 
group work of all kinds. For in ensemble playing 
the satisfaction is simultaneous with the effort, and 
naturally stimulates the love for group activities. 
The selfishness of many children (especially 
that of the only child in a family) offers a great 
problem, and everyone knows how valuable is the 
companionship of other children in these cases. 
In ensemble playing, the selfish child finds the 
very best of what association with others will 
contribute to him, for it trains him subconsciously 
and without moralizing to experience the necessity 
and the joy of sharing with others. 
The value of ensemble music in family groups— 
the ideal grouping—is discussed on page 206. 
Ensemble playing seems to me to reduce to a 
minimum self-consciousness in playing. Ifa child 
plays a part that can not be singled out (except by 
his mistakes) he will forget himself in order to hear 
and to enjoy the harmonized unit to which he is 
contributing. Here, conspicuousness brings dis- 
aster rather than reward, and here might well be- 
gin the attitude of the philosopher who, though 
contributing much, will lose himself in the Big Unit.
-P-A-G-E-247

To the average American, the only perfected 
form of ensemble playing is that of the Symphony 
Orchestra, and he has little appreciation for the 
very rich field of Chamber Music. The natural 
means to an appreciation of that intimate phase of 
art is the group playing of children, families, friends, 
or students. In some European countries where 
families are more given to playing together, this 
interest in small group playing has resulted in the 
creation of much chamber music literature, and a 
demand for its presentation. It is to be regretted 
that, as a rule, the musical audience in America 
demands either a soloist who is a star of the first 
magnitude, or else a complete orchestra, leaving 
out of account the small group of musicians whose 
ensemble may express even more of perfect art, 
and whose opportunity to educate the masses is 
even greater, because of the greater adaptability of 
a small organization and their concentrated power. 
The most thorough appreciation of chamber music 
and of orchestral music, and all other ensemble 
forms of the Art, is founded on an early partici- 
pation in these forms by groups of children playing 
together—the younger the better—even though 
the instruments may be crude and the art may be 
primitive.

In summing up the ways in which Creative 
Music may contribute to the child’s education 
and development, we find that it offers distinct 
contribution: 
To his creative power, 
To his power to think for himself; 
To his general knowledge, 
To his power to act for himself, 
To his skill in controlling action, 
To his wholesome employment of emotional 
force, 
To his appreciation of beauty, and 
To his adjustment to society; 
and thus may it directly serve the true purposes 
of Education.

CHAPTER XI 
THE BEGINNINGS OF CREATIVE MUSIC IN THE HOME 
Tue greatest opportunity in fashioning the child’s 
musical life belongs to the mother and father. As 
a rule the music teacher does not come in touch 
with the child during the period of his life when 
she could make her. work take deepest root, for by 
the time a child starts to school, his brain and 
nervous system have already received the impres- 
sions that will largely determine what his reaction 
to the outside world will be. Psychologists agree 
that most of our tendencies and emotional reactions 
are established before the sixth or seventh year. 
Those early years with all their vivid impressions 
belong to the father and the mother or to those 
who have the daily care of the child. 
Any parent who has been interested enough to 
read the foregoing chapters will have thought 
already, probably, of many ways in which he or she 
could apply the principles of Creative Music to the 
185  
-P-A-G-E-252
  186 Creative Music in the Home 
home life of the little ones. But I should like to 
add an extra word of practical suggestion. 
In the first place, I think we should sing to 
children from their earliest infancy. More musi- 
cal capacity comes through imitation (if the 
opportunity is given when the child is in the 
imitative stage) than many of us realize. I regret 
the passing of the old custom of singing babies to 
sleep, for I think there is something very vitally 
helpful to the musical sense in having simple and 
quiet vocal sounds of sweet quality penetrate into 
the child’s subconscious mind in the state of sleep. 
His subconscious mind is already and constantly 
receiving various kinds of impressions that will 
play an important part in shaping his after life. 
Why not take advantage of the opportunity to give 
it impressions of beauty that can have none other 
than a beneficent effect? Observations of the 
reactions of little children to different stimuli 
have convinced me that a child reacts to beauty of 
sound earlier in his life than to impressions of 
beauty received through the other senses. Since 
the appreciation of sound is so elemental, education 
through his ear cannot begin too early. Ina sense, 
his musical education does begin the day he is born 
(unless he is deaf), whether one wishes it or not, and
-P-A-G-E-253
  Creative Music in the Home 187 
the most a parent can do is to see that the daily 
impressions made on the child’s ear shall tend to- 
ward appreciation and creation of beauty. 
I truly believe that it is possible for a child to 
receive from his mother and father in the home, in 
the first seven years of his life, musical training— 
without set lessons or practice hours—that will be 
of greater value to him than twice seven years’ 
study in any conservatory after he is grown. If 
one or both of the parents are musical, so much the 
better; but even unmusical parents can do much if 
they are intelligently interested and patiently 
persevering. A deliberate formation of certain 
family habits, a watchfulness for opportunity and 
a readiness to convert things at hand into musical 
material, are all that are needed. But the codper- 
ation of both parents is necessary. 
It does not seem unfair, I hope, to place upon the 
shoulders of the busy man of affairs a share of 
responsibility in the personal musical training of 
his child. Too many fathers feel that their respon- 
sibility ends in earning the money to pay the bills 
for the musical education of their children. The 
father’s personal codperation, however, is worth 
much more than the money he plans to spend. 
Even if he can give little technical help, he can at 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  188 Creative Music in the Home 
least let all who are concerned feel his sympathetic 
interest. To some prosaic men (and women too) 
who have forgotten all about the feelings and 
mental attitudes of their childhood, the natural 
musical development of a child would seem sheer 
nonsense and useless noise. Such an attitude on 
the part of either parent, by his or her mere pres- 
ence in the house, casts a “damper” over the 
efforts of the other. All musical activity must be 
free and spontaneous, without any fear of dis- 
pleasing anyone. The true spirit of the effort is 
killed by the presence of even one unsympathetic 
person, and if that person is the child’s father or 
mother, or anyone whom he loves very much, it is 
quite fatal to the undertaking. [Any musician 
knows how quickly his musical feeling and power of 
expression are affected by the presence of one who 
is intolerant or unsympathetic;)and I have known 
many fathers who, from lack ‘of sympathy with 
their children’s efforts, have blighted, quite uncon- 
sciously, the musical powers of their children to a 
serious extent. 
On the other hand, many fathers who are really 
sympathetic with their children’s training feel that 
“rough-housing” is the only way they can play 
with them. This also is unfortunate. Such play
-P-A-G-E-255
  Creative Music in the Home 189 
often ends in a tearful reaction from an excitement 
that is nervous and uncontrolled. No real develop- 
ment in song or dance can come through rowdy or 
riotous singing and dancing. ( Rhythmic play can 
be free and spontaneous, and yet sane and whole- 
some for everyone concerned. { Baby games, such 
as ‘‘Patacake,”’ “‘This is the Way the Baby Rides,” 
and “This Little Pig went to Market” have real 
value in the development of the sense of rhythm, 
and have stood the test of time. 
As soon as the child can stand well enough, he is 
ready for a fine ride standing on father’s swinging 
foot. This gives the child experience of bodily 
freedom in rhythmic motion through the air, and 
training in muscular coédrdination as well. The 
strong-armed father who swings his baby rhythmi- 
cally to and fro, is giving the child wholesome experi- 
ences in rhythmic feeling that will enable him to 
dance morefreely if this early sense of bodily freedom 
is not counterbalanced by some experience that 
results in fear or constraint. In his outings with - 
the child, the father has valuable opportunities 
to quicken the small ears to sounds of Nature, 
to keen perception and imitation of them; together 
they may learn bird songs—to know them and 
to whistle them; and so in numberless ways 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
190 Creative Music in the Home 
the father may contribute to the musical education 
of his child, even without having had musical 
training himself. 
Many mothers, as well as fathers, have felt a 
righteous comfort in making sacrifices to save 
money for their children’s musical training ““when 
they are old enough,” and many have also been dis- 
appointed in the results. Perhaps the results would 
have been more satisfactory had a better foun- 
dation been laid before they were “old enough.” 
Even the busiest mother has many opportunities 
to serve her child’s musical education, not only 
while he is an infant in arms, but all through his 
childhood. She may sing to him and with him at 
all times, even while she kneads the bread and 
peels the potatoes. She has many opportunities 
to improvise duets with him or to let him beat a 
pie-pan drum while they sing or march from room 
to room on necessary errands. She can encourage 
him to dance daily, either with or without music. 
With his little broom he may help her sweep, and 
while actually removing the fallen leaves from the 
wide porch floor, keeping time with mother’s broom, 
he may have a lesson in rhythm, muscular co- 
ordination, and adjustment. They can make beds 
together, and improvise songs of the “fluttering

sheet that must be tucked in.” While mother 
mends, he can sit on the floor and tap rhythms 
with his blocks, to see which one she likes best, and 
sing a dramatic song of the tower that has to fall. 
It is within the mother’s power, even without 
musical training herself, to teach her children to 
play musical melodies as early as four or five years 
of age. With a little patience and experimenting, 
she may find several drinking glasses that have 
musical sounds when struck, and tune them to the 
notes of the major scale. Five or six glasses will © 
prove enough in the beginning,—or even three,— 
and if she has previously taught the child to sing 
simple songs that lie within the range of these 
glasses, he will be delighted to find the melodies 
by ear and play them. The glasses should rest ona 
thick cloth, and should be struck with a cloth- 
covered, wooden hammer. I consider tuned 
glasses the simplest and most attractive instru- 
ment for a child’s first playing, and surely every 
family in America can afford to give its children 
musical experiences in this. 
As soon as the child is old enough to handle tools, 
the father or mother may guide him in the making 
of many instruments. I add below a few directions . 
for simple home-made instruments for the benefit of 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  192 (Creative Music in the Home 
those who wish more detailed suggestions than is 
given in the story of my experiment. 
With only a few suggestions from a parent many 
children will be able to make a variety of drums 
of things already at hand. Anything that is 
cylindrical and hollow can be made into a barrel 
drum if the edges are smooth enough to be covered 
by a skin or cloth or stiff paper, for instance a hat 
box, a round oatmeal box, a coffee can, a pail with 
the bottom removed, a section of gourd, section of 
hollow log, butter tub, mailing tube, all kinds of 
kegs, etc. The two ends are covered at the same 
time. A long, strong cord is drawn first through 
one skin and then through the other, thus produc- 
ing the zigzag effect around the body of the drum. 
The cord should be drawn as tightly as possible 
before it is tied. If cloth is used, have it stretched 
very tightly over the ends before the shellac is 
applied (see page 42). If skin is used, it must be 
wet until it is quite soft before it is put on the drum. 
After the skin has been fastened by the cord lacings 
all around the drum, it should be drawn only 
moderately tight, and if the skin is then dried 
rapidly before a fire or other heat, it will become 
taut and resonant. 
A kettle drum may be made from any concave
-P-A-G-E-261
  
Creative Music in the Home 193 
body which has a smooth edge and which is solid 
enough to reflect sound vibrations: a chopping 
bowl, the half of a cocoanut shell that has been 
sawed in two, a china or earthenware bowl, a flower- 
pot, bucket, ete. Since the cord that holds the 
skin in place cannot pass alternately from one end 
to the other, some other way of holding it on 
tightly must be devised. If thumb tacks cannot 
be used, as in the case of crockery and cocoanut 
shells, a net work of cord may be made and drawn 
tightly around the smaller part of the concave body 
(see Figure 1). : 
The decoration of the drum is not to be over- 
looked, for it gives the child an opportunity to 
express his artistic feeling in design and color upon 
something he will use, and to experience a real 
correlation of two great arts. His feeling for 
rhythm may be cultivated in beautifying his drum 
as well as in using it. 
The marimba is such an interesting and easy 
instrument to make that any child who has access 
to some smooth strips of wood, a saw and a plane, a 
gimlet, a few small nails and a strip of thick cloth 
can make one at home. White wood or poplar 
is best, though pine will do. A bar of wood about 
twelve or fourteen inches long, one and a half 
13
-P-A-G-E-262
  194 Creative Music in the Home 
inches wide, and three fourths of an inch thick is a 
good size to start with. Lift it with two fingers 
about one fourth of its length from one end, and 
strike it in the middle with a wooden stick or 
mallet. It will give a musical sound which one 
may easily match with the voice. This may be 
used as the keynote of the instrument, or its pitch 
may be changed and brought into unison with 
another note, if some other instrument is to be 
played with it. If its tone is too low, it may be 
raised by sawing off one end and making the stick 
shorter. If it is too high, plane one of the flat sides 
until the tone is sufficiently lowered. Let the child 
find out by experiment just how much must be 
sawed off or planed. Another bar a little shorter 
(but of the same width and thickness) may be 
tuned in the same way for the second note of the 
scale, and so on for as many notes as the child 
wishes for his instrument. The less he is told and 
the more he finds out by experiment, the better for 
him and the more he will enjoy the process. ‘* . . 
When the notes are all tuned, he must find a 
board long enough and wide enough to use as a 
base to rest all of the notes on, leaving abouta 
half-inch space between every two adjacent ones. 
If he places these wooden bars flat upon the board,
-P-A-G-E-263
  Creative Music inthe Home 195 
he will find that their tones are dead and unmusical, 
not at all like their sounds when he held them 
lightly in two fingers and struck them. Some- 
thing must be stopping the vibrations. Now it 
happens that when a bar of wood is struck 
it vibrates in segments, and there are points in it 
where it may rest or be touched without interfering 
with those vibrations. These points are about one 
fourth of its length from each end, and are called 
nodal points. (The child may locate them by 
tapping the bar when it is covered with fine saw- 
dust, and watching to see where the sawdust 
collects as the quietest place to rest.) If some 
way can be devised to support the bar at those 
points only, it will be free to vibrate and produce 
a clearer tone. Two very narrow strips nailed or 
glued to the big board will serve this purpose, but 
they must be placed at the proper angle to support 
all the bars at their nodal points. Since the bars 
are of graduated lengths, the bar with the lowest 
note being much longer than the bar producing 
the highest note, the two supporting strips will of 
course have to be placed further apart at one end 
than at the other. If these supporting strips are 
covered with felt or other thick cloth, the sound will 
be better. Can the child see the reason for this?
-P-A-G-E-264
  196 Creative Music in the Home 
After the nodal points are located and the 
covered strips in place, the wooden bars must now 
be fixed in position so they will not bounce out of 
place when they are struck. The simplest method 
I have found is to bore gimlet holes through the 
wooden bars at their nodal points (at one end is all 
that is necessary) and drive tiny nails into the 
supporting strip, so that when the bars are in place 
the nails stand in the gimlet holes and keep the 
bars from falling off. The nails must not fit 
tightly in the gimlet holes. Can the child tell why? 
If desired, the wooden bars may be stained (paint 
or varnish would affect the tone of the wood) and 
the base koard may be decorated in any way the 
child wishes. 
A block of pine or other wood about an inch 
thick may be whittled into a round ball, a hole 
bored in it, a stick glued into the hole for a handle, 
and a mallet is ready to use. The mallet must 
strike the bars in the middle, between the two 
supporting strips. 
A six-note marimba is a very practical size for a 
small child to make, and there are many six-note 
songs he can easily play; London Bridge, for 
instance, Lavender’s Blue, and Twinkle, Twinkle, 
Little Star. If there are several children in the

  Creative Music inthe Home 197 
family, each child may make one, and if these 
marimbas are tuned in unison and played together, 
they may contribute much pleasure in the family 
circle. They can give the four- and five-year- 
olds, as well as those in their teens, valuable experi- 
ences in Chamber Music and ensemble playing, all 
without special lessons from a professional music 
teacher, the director being some member of the 
family. 
One of the simplest of home-made instruments 
is a set of pipes of Pan. Before making the 
instrument, the child will be interested to hear the 
story of Pan, of his love for the beautiful nymph, 
Syrinx; how she fled at his approach; how he 
pursued; and how she was changed into a cluster of 
reeds by the side of the river just as he was about 
to overtake her. His discovery of the tone made 
by his breath passing over the reeds that had been 
broken by his grasp, and his invention of the musical 
pipes as consolation for the lost Syrinx, all seem real 
to the children who find growing reeds, cut them, 
and make them into pipes which they can play. 
Every child should have the experience of mak- 
ing and using this simple little instrument, and I 
believe that almost any mother will be able to find 
something which may serve as material to use in its
-P-A-G-E-268
  198 Creative Music in the Home 
making. If the stem of the Japanese fleece flower 
is not to be had, then elder branches, the bark of 
willow branches (in the spring only), rushes, or 
anything that grows with hollow stems will do. 
Small cornstalks may be used if the pith is pushed 
out or burned out with a hot rod. If none of these 
are available, the same type of instrument may be 
made of test tubes, tall slender bottles, or even rolls 
of stiff paper. 
Most children know how to make a sound by 
blowing across a hollow tube that is closed at one 
end. Those who do not may find out by experi- 
ment. The tube or reed must be held straight up, 
pressed lightly against the chin with the open end 
of the reed touching the lower lip. Then make a 
small opening in the lips just over the pipe, and 
while blowing directly across this open end, whis- 
per distinctly the word “two.” If a musical sound 
does not result, shift the pipe a little lower or higher 
and try it again. The proper position of the pipe 
will be found without much difficulty, but a little 
practice is usually needed to produce a full, clear 
tone and it is well to acquire this before attempting 
to tune a series of pipes. If one blows too hard 
the tone will be shrill. 
In making this instrument, two things are to be
-P-A-G-E-269
  Creative Music in the Home 199 
remembered: the pipes ‘must be closed at the 
bottom, and the pitch of each pipe must be regu- 
lated by the length of the hollow part. The 
longest reed will give the lowest tone (which the 
child should discover for himself), and the maker 
must also find by experiment how much to cut off 
in order to raise the tone to any desired pitch. 
Most hard reeds may be held in a vise and cut with 
a saw. When the pitch is almost high enough, 
the reed may be sandpapered into tune and the 
risk. of cutting off too much is thereby lessened. 
In case glass or metal tubes are used, the length of 
the hollow cavity may be shortened by putting 
water or sand in them. If rolls of paper are used, 
the lower ends may be closed with paraffine, but 
there must not be even the tiniest leak. 
Three pipes will be enough for the young child’s 
first attempt, and more may be added as soon as 
his proficiency in the use of three pipes justifies a 
wider range. Upon these three pipes he may play 
the three-note melodies given in Chapter VII. 
The pipes should be tied together in two places to 
hold them straight. (See Figure 9.) Do not be 
alarmed if the blowing causes dizziness; it usually 
does until the piper learns to play with less effort 
and less waste of breath.
-P-A-G-E-270
Ee ee ee ee te eee ee ree” eee 
200 Creative Music in the Home 
Part-playing with pipes may begin as soon as 
two children in the family know the same three- 
note melody, and one of them has a set of five pipes 
tuned accurately to the first five notes of the major 
scale, and another child has three pipes exactly in 
tune with the three lower notes of the five-note set. 
The owner of the five-note set may play the three- 
note melody on pipes number three, four and five, 
while the other child plays it on numbers one, two 
and three, thus producing two-part harmonies. If 
the pipes are tuned to notes of the piano, and if 
mother can accompany the pipers, the effect may 
be very delightful and tend to stimulate the 
children to higher musical achievement. 
The children may also be interested to know how 
this instrument has developed from its simple 
beginnings; that through ages of careful experi- 
ment the hollow reed has been made to produce 
sounds that are more and more beautiful; that 
the great pipe organs that stand in our most 
magnificent churches to-day, with their rows of 
manuals, stops and pedals, their hundreds of pipes 
producing musical sounds of every degree of power 
and of every imaginable quality, are in reality, only 
highly developed pipes of Pan.

less be able to find trumpet materials for her 
children and direct their experiments until they 
acquire a trumpet tone. A little lip practice may 
not be amiss in the beginning. Most children 
discover in babyhood how to make a noise by blow- 
ing through lightly closed, fluttering lips. This 
motion applied to lips that are tightly closed except 
for a small opening in the center, produces a louder 
sound. When the breath is forced through the 
small aperture, it causes those tiny parts of the 
lips to flutter after the manner of a double reed. 
The child should first make this sound with his lips 
until he is sure of it, then hold the hollow reed or 
other trumpet to the lips, as shown in Figure 10, and 
repeat the sound with the fluttering part of his 
lips inside the reed. Let him experiment until 
he produces a full, vibrant, and steady tone of 
definite pitch. The lowest tone that the reed will 
produce is its true or fundamental tone; the others 
areovertones. A little practice will enable the child 
to blow the fundamental tone without letting it 
lapse into the overtones. One who plays the bugle 
will probably be able to blow bugle tones on the 
trumpet by purposely making use of the overtones. 
If the trumpet is a reed with practically the same 
diameter for its entire length (as the one in Figure 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  202 Creative Music in the Home 
10), holes may be bored or burned in it which 
enable one to play a melody very easily. A round 
hole as large as can be conveniently covered by the 
finger, placed about one eighth of the reed’s length 
from the lower end, will allow the trumpet to yield 
a tone one step above the fundamental. A trial 
hole may be made, and if the note it yields is not 
accurate, it may be filled with paraffine or wax 
and another hole may be made. The placing of 
these holes is best learned by experiment, for the 
child loves to make his own discoveries. He will 
probably discover that the size of the hole, as well 
as its position, has an effect on the tone. A second 
hole placed not quite one eighth of the reed’s 
entire length above the first hole will yield, when 
both holes are open, a note which is a major third 
above the fundamental. The trumpet now has the 
capacity for a three-note melody, and if the child is 
familiar with several such melodies and will 
improvise others, this simple hollow reed will 
afford him some variety in musical expression. If 
a third note is added for the fourth note of the scale, 
the distance between the second and third holes 
should be less than the distance between the first 
and second holes, since number four of the major 
scale is only a half-step higher than number three.

The parent who is guiding the constructive 
efforts of children in Creative Music will be able 
without further suggestions, to make many, if not 
all the instruments described in Chapter IV,—for 
instance, the squash-leaf oboe, the Chinese tche, 
primitive harps and kins and banjos, and perhaps 
others which I have not mentioned. A study of 
the photographs may also be helpful. However, I 
will describe in detail the construction of the box 
lyre, as a type of simple stringed instrument which 
any child may make at home. 
The two main things in this instrument are a 
strong frame supporting a number of strings, and a 
box resonator to intensify the sound of the strings. 
First procure a cigar-box, or else make a box with a 
top of thin wood. Cut a hole in this top (see 
Figure 44). It is through this hole that the sound 
waves enter the box and become intensified. The 
top must then be put aside until the frame is in 
place. A frame of strong wood may now be built 
around the box to support the strings. The side 
pieces may be as long as the maker desires for the 
length of his strings, and the cross pieces at the top 
must extend fully across both side pieces. The 
joints had best be strengthened with long screws 
so that the pull of many tight strings will not c& 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
    
   204 Creative Music in the Home 
weaken the joints. Bore as many holes in the top 
cross piece as you will need for strings. Make 
pegs that fit tightly into these holes and then bore 
tiny holes through these pegs near the top. If ° 
you have no gimlet that is small enough, holes may 
be burned through the pegs with the red-hot end of 
awire or hairpin. These tiny holes are for attach- 
ing the strings to the pegs. If the frame is made to 
fit the box, it may now be glued into place as in 
Figure 44, and the top glued on. It is best to set the 
box a little back in its frame, so that the top of the 
box lacks about one fourth of an inch of being on 
a level with the frame. Thus no bridges will be 
required to keep the strings from rattling against 
the box. Now drive small screws or nails into the 
bottom cross piece, tie the strings to these screws, 
and then, drawing the strings across the lyre, 
fasten them to the pegs at the top, and turn the 
pegs to regulate the tension of the strings. 
Wire strings or gut strings, or even silk strings 
twisted and dipped into wax, will answer. Strings 
of graduated sizes should be used, the heaviest 
ones, of course, being used for the lowest notes. 
If a rattle is heard in the sound of the string, 
it may be because its vibrations are not cut 
off sharply at the edge of the cross piece, and it  
-P-A-G-E-277
  Creative Music in the Home = 205 
may be vibrating against a part of that piece of 
wood, In such case, a piece of stiff wire may be 
slipped under the strings to lift them from the 
wood, or else the wood may be trimmed to a sharp 
edge which leaves no other contact with the string. 
The lyre may be decorated according to the child’s 
ideas. It is held in the left arm, as shown in Figure 
26, and played with the thumb and fingers of the 
right hand. In ease wire strings have been used, 
the quill end of a chicken feather or other plectrum 
may be used for plucking the strings, if so desired. 
If the above instruments are made at home under 
the parents’ guidance, these experiences will 
probably lay the foundation for further experi- 
ments and give the child an impetus toward \/ 
musical investigation and growth. If the use 
of them is encouraged, or even patiently tolerated, 
it will probably help to form the music making 
habit. 
If there is a word one could speak that would 
make us really want to forget our cares for a 
time at the end of the day and bring the family 
together for a little home-made music, pray let us , 
find the magic word and shout it from the house- 
tops! No matter if the music is crude—it is the 
habit that counts most of all, for the children and
-P-A-G-E-278
  206 Creative Music in the Home 
for ourselves as well. To “put on a few records” 
does not suffice; these have a valuable service to 
yield in our family life and education, but they can- 
not take the place of actual experiences in making 
music. Not only are the cares of the day for- 
gotten when we play and sing together, but the 
family ties are strengthened and associations are 
built up which serve us well all through life. Ifa 
child has feelings of anger toward another it is 
almost impossible for him to cherish that anger 
through the hearty singing of several songs to- 
gether, especially if the songs be jolly ones. Here 
is an opportunity for parents to study the psy- 
chology of music in reference to their children, and 
to select songs for special effects upon them. 
Whether in singing or in playing, it is undoubtedly 
true that the family custom of making harmonious 
sounds together has an enormous value in regulat- 
ing family nerves and harmonizing family relations; 
in giving children musical experiences from baby- 
hood that tend to make them truly musical; and 
in establishing reactions, attitudes, and tendencies 
toward music and toward other people that will 
make their whole lives richer and more complete.

CHAPTER XII 
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS 
A DETAILED report of each lesson or a list of all the 
steps in my work would be impossible in these 
pages; neither is it necessary. I have tried to 
make my beliefs and working principles clear; 
have stated my aims, suggested the material, and 
have explained my plan of using that material in 
the hope that teachers and parents who wished to 
make practical use of it would be able to do so. 
Doubtless many will be able, without further sug- 
gestion, to incorporate into their teaching as many 
of the ideas herein stated as have appealed to them. 
It is impossible to tell the true teacher just how 
she is to do anything, for each teacher must have 
her own technique. When once she has thoroughly 
acquired her subject matter, it must then stand at 
the disposal of her wisdom and circumstances and 
of the child’s nature and capacity. The facts are 
merely the storehouse to draw from as the child 
himself reaches for knowledge; the teacher’s part 
207  
-P-A-G-E-282
~ 208 Suggestions to Teachers 
being mainly to stimulate and guide his reaching. 
The teacher who develops constructive tendencies 
in children is more useful than one who stores his 
mind with facts. 
unfold and grow under her guidance. There are 
thrilling moments in her life when the child’s 
reaction to her efforts has resulted in the creation 
of something beautiful. The realization that 
through her stimulation the child did it alone, 
gives her a thrill that she would not exchange for 
any other satisfaction the world has to offer. 
There is a far greater joy in enabling a child to 
create something than in creating it one’s self, for 
then one has the gratification of feeling a construc- 
tive power in the mental development of human 
beings rather than power over mere materials. 
The wish for power, which is so fundamental a part 
of our make-up, is thus gratified in a way that is 
most helpful to society, and the teacher finds a 
compensation that none can fully understand 
except those who have experienced it. 
Many teachers are more interested in the pupils 
who have much talent than in those who have little. 
But there is a particular satisfaction in dealing
-P-A-G-E-283
  Suggestions to Teachers 209 
with difficult situations, in working out different 
ways of stimulating a weak power to stronger reac- 
tion, and in exploring to find out hidden power. 
One of the greatest rewards in teaching is in seeing 
an untalented child’s face glow with the realiza- 
tion of accomplishment, or in hearing him say, 
perhaps, “Oh, how beautiful! I didn’t know I 
could do that!” The teacher’s compensation is in 
seeing the effect on the child, not in the intrinsic 
beauty of the thing he has created. 
~~ To begin with, then, the teacher must teach, not 
from an extrinsic motive, but for the personal 
gratification that comes in the very process of 
teaching. Then she must formulate her aims 
toward the child, select the material she will use, 
decide on the method or plan she will follow in 
using that material, and work out her own tech- 
nique in adapting her plan to each child, 
Aims.—Broadly speaking, perhaps the general 
aim of any musical educator should be to lead the 
child really to experience music. But as phases of 
her general aim, the teacher will also have definite 
aims as to the special experiences her pupils shall 
have, the knowledge they shall gain, the powers 
of thought which they shall_develop, the skills 
they shall acquire, the habits they shall cultivate, 
14
-P-A-G-E-284
  210 Suggestions to Teachers 
the attitudes they shall establish, the artistic re- 
sults they shall obtain, and the social tendencies 
they shall build up, as well as the especial needs of 
individual children. With these purposes in mind, 
she will carefully select her material. 
Material—If the child’s experiences are to be 
constructive and real experiences, they must in- 
volve material that the child can comprehend and 
handle easily. This at once excludes the piano 
and violin for most young children and implies in- 
struments and musical literature of the child’s own 
level. In order that those experiences may grow 
and flourish they must be rooted in the elemental 
ground of his nature. So, first of all, the material 
must be suited to the child’s powers. There must 
also be variety in material that the child’s inter- 
est may be refreshed before it tires, and that his 
experiences may be correlated with many things. 
The material must also be such as gives experiences 
in beauty and supplies for him always growing 
ideals of beauty. 
Method.—The material may be ever so fine and 
yet be spoiled by the bad use of it. One must 
have a sound educational principle underlying 
one’s plan of using material. For example, the 
basic principle underlying one’s work may be that
-P-A-G-E-285
  Suggestions to Teachers 211 
we “learn by doing,” and upon that principle one 
may build many plans of procedure. Although 
these working plans and principles are vital to 
constructive teaching, I think many teachers have 
overrated the necessity of following a certain line 
of thought and procedure. To follow rigidly any 
fixed series of ideas or lessons (even one’s own) is 
destructive to the teacher’s initiative, and the 
teacher, of all others, has great need for all her ini- 
tiative and resourcefulness. Her method does not 
have to be arbitrary, neither are inventions and de- 
vices necessary, if the material is adequate and inter- 
esting. I doubt not, however, that there has been a 
real reason for the devising of so many “methods” 
in music teaching, namely, the need to sustain the 
child’s interest in something that is naturally un- 
suited to his capacity. But if the material set before 
him is of the kind to strike the élemental note in his 
nature and keep it sounding all the way from his 
instincts up to his fullest capacity of cultural de- 
velopment, his own natural craving for it will supply 
the interest, even if the teacher follows no other 
method than the child’s own, and any one of a 
dozen methods may be equally effective if the basic 
principle is right. The very nature of music is 
such, and man’s relation to it is so close, that it
-P-A-G-E-286
212 Suggestions to Teachers 
seems rather inappropriate to let anything so formal 
as a fixed method stand between the little child 
and his experiences in so elemental an art. 
The deciding questions in selecting a method, it 
(seems to me, should be—Does this plan stimulate 
and gratify, in a natural way, the child’s own 
creative impulse? Does it draw something out of 
the child—not impose something upon him? Is 
it based on the recognition of the child’s natural 
and acquired responses? 
Technique.—The watchword for the teacher’s 
technique should be to keep the child interested 
in the thing he is doing for the sake of the thing it- 
self. To do this she must establish the right 
atmosphere in which he may work; she must see 
that what he attempts is not beyond his power, 
yet presents some difficulty for him to overcome, 
and will give him pleasure when it is successfully 
done. 
The technique which one employs in applying 
method to material depends upon the experience, 
wisdom, skill, and personality of the teacher. She 
may formulate and definitely state her method but 
she cannot state her technique, because it varies 
always with varying circumstances, and it cannot 
be set forth on paper. And yet I would consider
-P-A-G-E-287
  Suggestions to Teachers 213 
the technique of the music teacher as even more 
important than the method. The “way she does 
it” counts more in the teaching of music than in 
the teaching of anything else I know. 
Results.—In general, if the above conditions are 
met; if the material is suited to the child, is varied 
and leading to beauty; if the method stimulates 
and exercises naturally the child’s creative power, 
and if the drive behind his work is an absorbing 
interest in the thing itself,—then the educator’s 
aim will be fulfilled and the child will have real 
and constructive musical experiences. 
It is impossible to tabulate all the results of 
one’s teaching, or to know all the effects of these 
musical experiences upon the child. The music 
teacher has dealt not only with the child’s intellect 
and his body—with his power to think and to do— 
but she has also dealt very largely with his power 
to feel. It is easy to test one’s handiwork, and 
educators have devised means for testing intel- 
lectual growth, but how are we to test a child’s 
emotional development, and who can measure 
accurately the effect of one’s teaching upon the 
child’s power to feel or to aspire? And yet this is 
perhaps the music teacher’s richest realm when she 
has the power to develop it. The musical feeling
-P-A-G-E-288
  214 Suggestions to Teachers 
of the child is intangible and evanescent, affecting 
his entire being, and the teacher who cultivates it 
most effectively is one whose contact with him 
comes through those intangible, indescribable, un- 
catalogued attributes called personality. If she 
is lacking in personality even though her material 
and method may be excellent, and the other phases 
of her technique without definite criticism, she will 
never be able to build most constructively upon 
the child’s emotions. 
The power of music over us from infancy to the 
grave is so great that those of us who try to estab- 
lish a closer intimacy between this powerful force 
and the plastic child, have assumed a serious, even 
if most joyful undertaking. For “Thus,” says 
Stanley Hall, “in a day when psychologists are 
realizing with one accord that the feelings are far 
vaster than the intellect and will, and are more 
important for health and sanity, it is clear that 
music teachers more than any other class are 
charged with the custody and responsibility of the 
hygiene of the emotional life.”

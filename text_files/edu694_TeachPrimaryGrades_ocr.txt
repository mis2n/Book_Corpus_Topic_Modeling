  PREFACE 
This book is the outgrowth of a number of years’ 
experience in helping prepare teachers for work in pri- 
mary grades. 
After a brief discussion of the aim of education and 
certain of the underlying principles which run through 
all the work, the author attempts to show how these 
principles may be worked out in practice in the primary 
grades, 
An attempt has been made to discuss each subject in 
a practical and scientific way followed by concrete appli- 
cation. Each step in the plan work has for its basis 
the principles of psychology which apply to the child 
mind. Each of the many plans given has been tried out 
again and again in actual schoolroom practice. 
The obligations of the author are too numerous to 
mention. Where direct quotations have been used, due 
acknowledgment has been made; but it was impossible 
to acknowledge many of the minor points used in the 
book, as these were often taken unconsciously from 
books and magazines. The author has read every book 
and article bearing on the subject that was accessible. 
Acknowledgment is made of the assistance given by 
the colleagues of the author; namely, Dean Hodge 
Mathes, President Sidney G. Gilbreath, Miss Katherine 
McSpadden, Miss Tompsie Baxter, Prof. F. W. Alex- 
ander, Prof. D. S. Burleson, Prof. Max Schoen, Prof. 
W. B. Coggin, Miss Ina Yoakley, Prof. C. E. Rogers, 
Supt. Riley Haworth, and Miss Pearl Bennett.

HOW TO TEACH THE PRIMARY 
GRADES 
CHAPTER I 
AIMS AND PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING 
PRIMARY EDUCATION 
AIMS 
General Aim. In beginning the study of the educa- 
tional process as it applies directly to the primary grades 
it will prove an economy of time and effort if the desired 
end to be attained is considered. Among the important 
educational aims which have been pointed out are culture, 
knowledge, harmonious development, utility, and the 
social aims. Of these the social is now accepted as the 
standard. The predominating purpose of this aim is to 
make the individual socially efficient; that is, to develop 
and to train such of his faculties and capacities as will 
enable him to accomplish his best work in the world. 
Special Aims. An ahalysis of this general aim will 
reveal that it is made up of a great number of minor 
aims. 
1. The first of these minor aims to be considered is 
that of the proper development of the body. It is an 
established fact that the body has a marked influence 
over the mind. Too often, the laggard in the class is 
Z 
 
-P-A-G-E-8
8 How to Teach Primary Grades   
the poorly-nourished and poorly-developed child. It is 
found, also, that the well-nourished and well-developed 
child receives impressions with more ease and retains 
them longer; is better able to analyze and classify these 
impressions; and is more likely to make use of them 
in daily life. 
Not only does the well-developed body help the mental 
powers involved in the learning process, but it helps to 
make living a thing of joy. The healthy individual rises 
each morning with a song in his heart and goes joyfully 
through the duties of the day. 
A well-developed body is the result of proper food, 
proper exercise, and fresh air. Not only should the 
teacher see that these conditions prevail in the child’s 
school life, but she should make suggestions regarding 
suitable conditions for the home life. Proper exercise 
may be secured through work, play, rhythmic gymnastics, 
and exercises for correct breathing. 
2. <A closely allied aim is that of training the child 
to rational observance of the laws of health. Medical 
science teaches that all the ills of the body except acci- 
dents may be traced to disregard for certain of these 
Jaws. It should be a vital part of the child’s education 
to train him to obey these laws. This training may be 
given through the use of stories, pictures, talks, and 
games. 
3. Another aim is to establish certain desirable habits ; 
namely, intelligent curiosity; clear, systematic thinking ; 
self-reliance in the solution of problems; organizing 
knowledge; judging values; taking the initiative; and 
certain social habits. 
a. Intelligent curiosity is a desire to know about 
things which are worth while. Curiosity is the mother
-P-A-G-E-9
Aims and Principles go   
of all knowledge, inasmuch as a desire to know is a pre- 
requisite to the gaining of knowledge. Curiosity may be 
awakened by the use of questions, stories, pictures, and 
objects. 
b. The ability to think clearly and systematically is 
largely a habit—a habit due to training. Practically 
every school activity should be utilized in establishing 
this very desirable habit. 
c. The habit of self-reliance in the discovery of 
problems and in the solving of these is of such impor- 
tance as to command the individual attention of every 
teacher. Many people go through life without realizing 
that its daily activities are full of vital problems which 
should be solved. The mental life grows and develops 
through the solving of these many problems. 
d. Closely connected with the habit of self-reliance 
are the habits of organizing knowledge and of judging 
values. In the old type of school the child was taught 
facts, and there the matter rested. But the teacher of 
the present day realizes that if the knowledge gained is 
to be translated into terms of daily life, the child must 
be trained to judge its value, and then to organize it in 
a systematic way. If the average child is to have this 
ability, it must be the result of definite training—a train- 
ing which may be accomplished through the ordinary 
schoolroom activities. 
e. The development of the capacity for taking the 
initiative is a most important part of the child’s training. 
By initiative is meant the power to work out things for 
oneself rather than to depend on others. This is a 
quality that develops into leadership in both thought and 
action. While it is doubtless true that there are a few 
persons who do not possess the germ of this capacity,
-P-A-G-E-10
10 How to Teach Primary Grades   
it is also true that the greater number possess it in a 
varying degree. It is the work of the teacher to dis- 
cover and develop it by making use of every opportunity 
which the school activities offer. 
f. If a person is to accomplish his best work in the 
world he should be trained to the social habits of thought- 
fulness, co-operation, honesty, promptness, industry, obe- 
dience, and patriotism. These habits may be established 
in part by the use of stories and ethical talks. 
4. Many people lose much of the beauty and happi- 
ness of life because they have not been trained to see 
the wonders in nature and in the industrial life of the 
world. One of the teacher’s aims should be to develop 
within the child the “seeing eye” and the “understanding 
mind” for all the world ofinature and of commerce. This 
may be accomplished through the regular lessons in 
nature study, social life, and literature. 
5. The teacher should aim to develop within each 
child the ability to gain knowledge and pleasure through 
reading. The choice of literature which is to be read 
and the habit of translating the thought gained into terms 
of daily life are matters of training—a training for which 
the teacher must usually assume the entire responsibility. 
Consequently, she should definitely plan to direct into 
worthy channels the child’s growing ability to read. 
6. The outward expression of thought or emotions is 
an instinct which should be developed to its fullest by 
training the child to forceful expression through as many 
different channels as possible; namely, through spoken 
and written language, music, manual arts, fine arts, and 
dramatic action. 
7. The capacity for appreciation is one which adds 
very materially to the joy of living. As this is a capacity
-P-A-G-E-11
    Aims and Principles 11 
which is very susceptible to training, it is essential that 
the teacher plan definitely for its proper development. 
The child should be trained to appreciate the truly humor- 
ous, the beautiful, and the noble qualities in human nature 
and in the social relations of life. Abundant material 
for this training will be found in literature, nature study, 
social life, and history. 
8. Growth in the moral, the mental, or the industrial 
life is largely the result of an ideal or goal which a person 
desires to attain. The person who has no ideal or goal 
accomplishes very little, since he has nothing to work 
toward. The teacher should help the child to establish 
definite childlike ideals of conduct, of study, and of 
industry. These ideals may be found in the social world 
round about, in literature, and in history. 
9. A careful examination of these minor aims will 
reveal that the trend or leading thought is that of pre- 
paring the child for social service. It is becoming evi- 
dent that his attitude toward his fellowman is largely 
due to training—that he will’be either selfish or unself- 
ish according to this training. 
This thought should be constantly in the mind of the 
teacher and she should plan to develop within the child 
ideals of service to parents, brothers, sisters, relatives, 
friends, and playmates. These ideals should govern prac- 
tically all his school activities as well as those of his 
honie life. He should be trained to compete honorably 
with his neighbor, but the emphasis should be on the 
training which will enable him to work for the good 
of the group. He should be taught also to consider 
the results of his actions. 
Numerous opportunities are to be found in the daily 
routine of every schoolroom for training in co-operation
-P-A-G-E-12
ne 
12 How to Teach Primary Grades   
and service, but too often these natural opportunties are 
overlooked, and the child is trained only to the habit of 
striving to outrank his classmate rather than to serve him. 
The teacher should aim not only to develop the de- 
sirable traits and tendencies but also to inhibit certain 
undesirable ones. Any trait or tendency whose develop- 
ment would be harmful to the group should be inhibited. 
It is obvious that the truly successful teacher should 
be a close student of the child-mind from both a theoret- 
ical and a practical standpoint. 
PRINCIPLES 
Through a scientific study of the learning process, it 
has been found that there are certain laws or principles 
by which knowledge or skill is acquired. A practical 
study of these laws or principles and of their application 
should enable the teacher materially to lighten her work. 
It should also result in a great saving of time and energy 
for the child. 
1. One of these laws is that known as Sense Percep- 
tion; namely, that no knowledge enters the mind unless 
it comes through one of the five senses. Any knowledge 
dealing with sound alone enters the brain only through 
the sense of hearing. This is illustrated by the difficulty 
involved in teaching deaf people to talk. Their inability 
to place their tones properly is owing to the fact that they 
have no sense of hearing, hence no real concept of sound. 
The conclusion for the teacher is that every new idea 
should be presented through that sense by which it should 
naturally reach the brain. The more senses involved in 
the presentation of an idea, the more perfect will be 
its concept. The child who has looked at an apple,
-P-A-G-E-13
Aims and Principles 13 
handled an apple, smelled an apple, and tasted an apple 
has a fuller and clearer concept of it than the one who 
has experienced it through only one sense. 
2. Closely allied with this law is that of Concept 
Formation; namely, that general concepts or general 
ideas are gained only through personal experience with 
the individual elements which go to make up the concept 
or idea. Before a complete concept or idea of a dog 
is formed, the child must see big dogs, little dogs, medium- 
sized dogs, white dogs, black dogs, brown dogs, spotted 
dogs, and dogs of many different breeds. Not only must 
he see them but he must watch them eat, play, run, and 
hunt, and hear them bark. In other words, no one can 
give him a complete concept of a dog. This can come 
only through personal experience—an experience which 
is to be made as broad as practicable. 
The conclusion for the teacher is that where practi- 
cable, the child should be permitted to work out all defi- 
nitions, rules, principles, and ideas in general for him- 
self. Her work is to bring him into personal contact 
with the experiences necessary to these ideas and then 
to train him to use these experiences in forming general 
ideas. 
Where it is not possible to supply all the necessary ex- 
perience at first hand, pictures will aid greatly if used 
wisely. In using pictures, the teacher should guard 
against the probability of the child’s gaining a faulty idea; 
for instance, a group of children who had seen only the 
pictures of sheep formed the idea that real sheep were 
only one inch high. 
3. The Law of Apperception deals with the inability 
of the mind to comprehend a thing which is absolutely 
new. When the mind comes into contact with any new
-P-A-G-E-14
14 How to Teach Primary Grades 
idea, it immediately begins to seek familiar elements. If 
these are not forthcoming, either the problem is given up 
or help is sought in acquiring the experience which will 
furnish the key to the situation. Until this new knowl- 
edge is made to fit into some previous experience it is 
not comprehended by the mind. 
The conclusion for the teacher is that not only must 
she know the subject-matter thoroughly, but she must 
also know the past experiences of the child in order to 
be able successfully to dove-tail the new with the old. 
In other words, she must be ready to supply the neces- 
sary experience should it be lacking. 
If the reading lesson is about life in the mountains, 
the child must be given a concept of what a mountain 
is before he can really appreciate what life there would 
mean. Or if he is to be taught long division, he must 
have had sufficient experience with addition, multiplica- 
tion, and subtraction to enable him to comprehend the 
process in hand. 
4. The ability of the mind to retain and to recall its 
past experiences is known as the Law of Memory. A 
person takes a pleasure trip and for many weeks and 
months after he has returned to his home he can recall 
every incident of the trip. 
This ability is based on three factors; namely, (a) 
native power of retention, (b) the number of associa- 
tions made, and (c) the systematic organization of these 
associations. 
Although the first factor is very fundamental and one 
which the teacher must consider in dealing with indi- 
vidual cases, it is the one over which she has no control, 
consequently, it will not be discussed in this connection. 
The discussion of the factors dealing with the association 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
Aims and Principles 15 
of ideas should logically come under the Law of 
Association. 
5. The Law of Imagination deals with the ability of 
the mind to reproduce past experiences and then to 
utilize these images in dealing with new situations or 
in forming new concepts or ideas. The child who sees 
the rag doll as a beautiful baby is using imagination, 
or the inventor who constructs some new device from 
his mental images is using a very high form of construct- 
ive imagination. 
Without imagination history and literature would be 
void of thought; the ability to reason would be seriously 
hampered; there would be no invention; and mental de- 
velopment would be hindered in numerous ways. In 
presenting new ideas the teacher should develop that 
imagination of the child which is pertinent to the point 
in hand by helping him to recall all past experience that 
will clarify the present situation. 
6. A law which is attracting much attention in the 
discussions of present-day educational problems is that 
known as the Law of the Aim or Motive. The gist of 
this law is that a task is accomplished more quickly and 
with more ease if the mind is held to the task by a defi- 
nite purpose. The child who learns certain facts of addi- 
tion in order that he may play a game which utilizes 
these facts, will accomplish the task with less expendi- 
ture of nervous energy and in less time than the one 
who has no reason for learning them other than that 
they are just a part of the school work. Likewise, the 
child who is learning to write and to spell the words 
necessary for writing a letter to Santa Claus, will accom- 
plish the task with much more ease than the child who 
learns to write and to spell without any apparent need.
-P-A-G-E-16
16 How to Teach Primary Grades 
McMurry says that to provide a motive is the first and 
greatest factor in all education, as it paves the way for 
independent thinking and initiative. (“Elementary School 
Standards.’’) 
The aim or motive may be one of two types: (a) the 
desire to accomplish the task because of some immediate 
need, or (b) the desire to solve a problem that has arisen. 
The immediate need will probably be the predominating 
motive with the young child. He learns to read so that 
he may read stories; he learns the number combinations 
so that he may keep the score in a game; he learns to 
write and to spell so that he may immediately write a 
letter. 
The desire to solve a problem as a source of motive 
will be discussed under the Law of Self-Activity. 
7. Knowledge cannot enter the mind without brain 
activity on the part of the learner, and the more active 
the brain cells, the greater will be the stock of knowledge. 
The teacher may read a poem to the child, but unless 
the child thinks about it, it will mean nothing to him, and 
the more he thinks it over the more it will mean. 
This Law of Self-Activity is one of the most important 
of the laws of the learning process, since the faculties 
of the brain are stimulated and given opportunity for 
dcvelopment only through exercise. This activity of the 
brain may be aroused by the presentation of a problem 
or a thought-compelling question. 
The teacher should not confuse the thought question 
with the fact question. ‘What does the rabbit eat?” is 
a fact question, while “Why is the color of the gray 
rabbit a protection to him?” is a thought question. 
If the problem is to be vital to the child, it must be 
one that is clear and definite and one that he deems
-P-A-G-E-17
Aims and Principles 17   
worthy of solution. The problem or thought-compelling 
question should dominate every lesson of the day. The 
wording of the problem should not be left to chance, 
but should be carefully and thoughtfully planned. 
8. The task which arouses the active interest of the 
mind is accomplished with less expenditure of energy 
and time than that to which the mind must be forced. 
The child who is interested in the arithmetic lesson will 
accomplish very much more, and will be far less tired 
than the one who must be forced to give his attention. 
The Law of Interest deserves the most careful con- 
sideration on the part of the teacher. The child is in- 
terested in moving things, animals, rhythm, music, stories, 
pictures, drawing, play, manipulation, construction, bright 
colors, change, novelty, emulation, and ownership. 
If possible, the interest should be within the process 
itself, though it is sometimes necessary to use incentives 
and devices to gain this interest; but as early as possible 
this artificial interest should develop into a natural one. 
As previously suggested, the strongest interest is the 
realization of a need. 
9. Knowledge does not enter the mind unless the at- 
tention is directed toward the issue. The child does not 
learn to recognize word symbols unless he directs his 
attention toward the process of word recognition. 
This Law of Attention is so closely allied to that of 
interest, that the two are almost identical, since attention 
is given for only a very brief time to a process that does 
not contain elements of interest. This attention should 
be spontaneous, inasmuch as forced attention brings very 
poor results, a part of the effort being given to the act 
of compelling oneself to attend. This produces fatigue 
and results in a lack of thoroughness. Children give
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 How to Teach Primary Grades   
attention only so long as the situation in hand is more 
interesting than some other. Consequently, the teacher 
must so plan her class procedure that the work will 
prove interesttng throughout the recitation period. 
10. Whenever a thought enters the mind there is a 
tendency for it to seek outward expression through some 
form of Motor Activity. If the thought of running 
enters the mind; there is an unconscious contraction of 
the muscles used in the running process. 
Only as a thought finds outward expression or modi- 
fies other thought already in the mind, is it of real 
value. Consequently, the teacher should so plan that 
all the thoughts gained in the school life are translated 
into motor activity. Her principle should be that no 
teaching is complete unless its produces some motor re- 
sponse. In other words, impression is a failure if there 
is no expression. 
The forms of motor expression may be verbal speech ; 
written speech; bodily action, such as gestures, facial 
expression, contraction of muscles; dramatization; hand- 
work; cooking; sewing; fine arts; or any other form by 
which thought is expressed. 
11. When an idea is associated with other ideas, a 
connecting link is formed, and the recall of the one is 
followed by the appearance of those connected with it; 
for example, the baby connects the act of having his hair 
brushed with going from the home. 
The probability of the recall of an idea is strengthened 
with every association made; therefore, the more nat- 
ural associations made the better, for if one of these 
associated ideas does not appear in consciousness another 
is almost sure to do so. This Law of: Association is a 
very important factor in the memory process.
-P-A-G-E-19
  Aims and Principles 19 = ee 
The logical arrangment of ideas is another important 
factor in the memory process. If facts are grouped ac- 
cording to similarity in thought and principle, and so 
that one fact naturally leads to the succeeding one, the 
possibility of recall is materially increased. If the teacher 
will see that the idea she wishes recalled is associated 
in a logical way with other ideas, it will result in a more 
effective type of memory. 
12. The Laws of Memory and Association are im- 
portant factors in the Law of Habit-F ormation. 
This law may be briefly stated thus: every act pro- 
duces some change in the nervous system, and there is 
always a tendency to repeat this act. response thus 
repeated a number of times has-a tendency to become 
permanent or to be made without the conscious attention 
of the mind. When it reaches this plane it is known 
as a habit. 
This Law of Habit-Formation is very important, since 
a large proportion of the acts of the physical and mental 
life of a person are on the plane of habit. The more 
processes relegated to the plane of habit, the broader 
will be the opportunities for initiative in thought and 
action. 
13. The Law of Original Nature is that the learning 
process is conditioned by the native capacities of the 
brain. Education means the development of the brain 
cells given at birth, since cells are never created after 
birth. 
The original nature of the child consists of certain in- 
stincts and capacities. The successful teacher will make 
a close study of the child and strive to work with the 
helpful instincts rather than against them. She will 
seek to discover his natural capacities and concentrate  
-P-A-G-E-20
a 
20 How to Teach Primary Grades   
effort on the one hand upon the proper development of 
these capacities and instincts, and on the other upon 
the inhibition of harmful ones. 
As previously stated, the more important of these in- 
stincts with which education is concerned are mental 
activity, emulation, imitation, defiance, ownership, socia- 
bility, affection, love for outdoor life, interest in animals, 
admiration of bright colors, enjoyment in display, col- 
lecting, manipulation, play, rhythm, and the dramatic 
instinct. 
Some of the most fundamental capacities are manage- 
ment of things, men, concrete ideas, abstract ideas, sym- 
bols; the capacities of self-control, thoroughness, origi- 
nality, co-operation, leadership, productive imagination, 
and concrete learning.

LESSON TYPES IN PRIMARY GRADES 
Under the old teaching regime there was only one type 
of lesson—the test or examination lesson. But as the 
aim of education has developed and broadened, the work 
of the teacher has become much more comprehensive 
than that of an examiner. She must train the child to 
proper habits of thinking, of study, of appreciation, of 
co-operation, of service, and to the many other habits 
specified in the aim of education. Many of these habits 
may be developed through the several types of lessons; 
namely, the study lesson, the inductive lesson, the appre- 
ciation lesson, the drill lesson, the recitation lesson, the 
review lesson, and the test or examination lesson. 
1. The Study Lesson. The average student in the 
university, college, normal school, high school, and ele- 
mentary school wastes a very large part of his time and 
effort. This waste is chiefly due to a lack of training 
in the correct methods of study. The ability to study 
in the proper way is not an inheritance, but is a matter 
of training—a training that should begin in the kinder- 
garten, and continue until skillful methods of study are 
firmly established. * 
One of the first things for the teacher to consider in 
her plan for a study lesson is her motive. This should 
be to direct the child’s effort in such a manner that he 
may acquire suitable habits of study; that is, habits of 
21
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 How to Teach Primary Grades 
independence, of initiative, and of clearness and system 
in thought and action. 
The next steps will be to consider the most effective 
way of arousing his interest in the lesson to be studied; 
of helping him to discover the problem of the lesson; 
of training him to select the best methods of solving this 
problem ; and of overcoming the difficulties. 
As study means the solving of a problem, the problem 
is a very essential part of the lesson. It has been previ- 
ously shown that much more is accomplished when the 
mind is conscious of a definite aim or problem. Conse- 
quently, the first step in the class procedure is to make 
the child conscious of a definite problem. 
If the problem is to be a vital one to him, it must be 
one that touches his daily life, and one that he considers 
worth solving. Often it will develop as a part of a 
previous recitation, or it will arise in connection with 
other school activity. If it does not appear in either of 
these cases, the subject-matter should be carefully studied 
by the teacher to find what it offers in the way of a 
problem. 
The difficulties in a lesson will usually be of two types: 
those which the child can solve alone and those which 
he cannot solve except with assistance. It will require 
knowledge and good judgment on the part of the 
teacher to foresee these difficulties and to distinguish be- 
tween the two types. She should ask herself the follow- 
ing questions: First, “What has the child within his 
experience that should help him to overcome certain 
difficulties?” If the difficulty is a hard word, he may 
know the phonetic sounds of which the word is com- 
posed. Second, “How am I to train him to independence 
in the discovery of this necessary experience?” If the
-P-A-G-E-23
Lesson Types in Primary Grades 23   
hard word is phonetic, the teacher should lead him to 
analyze it into its phonetic elements and thus to discover 
that he can sound it. Third, “With what experience 
must he be supplied in order to overcome other difficul- 
ties?” Fourth, “What is the most scientific way of sup- 
plying these experiences?” An attempt has been made 
to answer these question through the methods of pre- 
senting the different subjects. 
In the study lesson, especial attention should be given 
to the varying abilities of the members of the class. If 
necessary the slow child should be given individual and 
shorter assignments, and the quick child should be given 
extra assignments. 
2. The Inductive Lesson. Very often the study 
lesson is of the type commonly known as the inductive 
lesson. This is the lesson based on the principle of con- 
cept-formation in which the child is led to discover things 
for himself. Through the study of individual cases, he 
works out definitions, rules, and principles for himself. 
The teacher does not tell him that two and two are 
four, but allows him to manipulate objects until he dis- 
covers it for himself. She does not give him the rules 
for letter writing, but guides him in the study of real 
letters until he discovers these rules. To some, this 
would seem a long process, requiring more time than 
the average child can give, but it is the one that must 
actually take place in the child’s mind before he fully 
comprehends a thing and before it has become a part of 
his practical mental equipment. Consequently, time is 
saved by consciously training him to the best methods 
of working out things for himself. 
The first step in the procedure is to present a problem 
which is worth solving and which the child really de-
-P-A-G-E-24
24 How to Teach Primary Grades   
sires to solve; for example, “How shall I begin the 
letter which I am going to write to John?” 
The material or subject-matter that is to be examined 
in the solving of the problem must be carefully selected. 
It must contain the accurate facts which are to enable 
the child to arrive at a conclusion. These facts should 
not be given in an obscure way, but should be within 
his comprehension. If the problem is to discover how 
to begin a letter, the supply of letters to be examined 
should be typewritten and the headings should contain 
words which are likely to be familiar to him. 
It is not sufficient for him to study a single letter, but 
he should examine and compare a great number until the 
fact which is being developed becomes an actual experi- 
ence within his thoughts. 
Only one point should be developed at a time; for 
instance, in a letter the first thing to be written is the 
name of the city and state in which the writer resides. 
The summary, or summing up of the rule, principle, 
or definition developed should form a regular part of 
the inductive lesson. If the correct way of writing the 
heading of the letter has been developed, the teacher 
may ask, “What is the first thing we write in a letter?” 
After a principle or rule has been developed, it should 
be immediately followed by its application to a problem 
of life. 
3. The Drill Lesson. The drill lesson is one the 
purpose of which is to establish the habit of making 
certain responses; for example, the use of the rules and 
principles developed in the inductive lesson must be 
made a habit. 
As previously stated, the more responses a person rele- 
gates to the plane of habit, the more opportunities the
-P-A-G-E-25
Lesson Types in Primary Grades ao 
mind will find for thinking out problems and for express- 
ing originality and individuality in thought and action. 
The drill lesson should be of especial interest to the 
primary teacher, as her work is largely that of habit 
formation—the habit of making fixed responses in the 
fundamental operations in arithmetic; the habits of form, 
position, and movement in writing; the habit of writing 
the letters of a word in a certain order in spelling; and 
the habit of using correct expressions in oral and written 
language. 
There are certain factors or principles which enter into 
any habit-forming exercise. These may be briefly given 
as (a) a motive or desire to form the habit; (b) a clear 
idea of the desired response or action; (c) attentive 
repetition of the desired response or action; (d) no 
exception ever to occur in the response or action; and 
(e) frequent reviews. 
a. Motive. The attitude of the child toward the 
desired habit is of great importance. Considerable 
time and energy are wasted in drill work because he 
does not see the use or feel the need of the habit. If 
he has a strong desire to form the habit because he 
feels the need of it, the task is, comparatively speaking, 
half finished. The stronger and more vital the motive, 
the more concentrated will be the attention and the 
sooner will the desired result be attained. 
b. Clear Idea of the Response. First impressions 
are usually the deepest and the most lasting. Conse- 
quently, it is very important that the first impression of 
the response or action be clear. Only a small amount 
of subject-matter should be used, since too much will 
tend to confuse the child and prevent a clear first im- 
pression. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
26 How to Teach Primary Grades   
c. Attentive Repetition. After the child has a clear 
impression of the response to be drilled on, the next step 
is that of repetition with full attention. Concentrated 
attention adds intensity to the impression and accom- 
plishes the desired results much more quickly. The 
teacher should bear in mind the fact that a little child 
is capable of giving concentrated attention to even an 
interesting object for only a short period of time—that 
unless there is a change the attention is given else- 
-where. She should plan to make the drill period short 
and snappy, with variety in procedure, and should see 
that there is no waste of time but that each child gives 
his entire attention. It is a law of human nature to 
desire to continue that which brings. satisfaction and 
pleasure, and to avoid that which gives annoyance and 
pain. Therefore, the teacher should plan, in so far as 
possible, to make each repetition bring some form of 
satisfaction and pleasure. This may be either physical, 
emotional, or intellectual. 
Other things being equal, the more interesting the as- 
sociations made in a drill lesson, the more possibilities 
will there be for recall, and the more permanent will be 
the habit. Therefore, the teacher should plan for as 
much variety as possible in the manner of conducting 
the drill. 
d. No Exceptions. Another important principle is 
never to allow an exception to occur in giving the de- 
sired response. If the drill is on the fact that two and 
two are four, the child should never be allowed to say 
that two and two are five. The wrong response not only 
weakens the possibility of the correct one but creates a 
tendency to repeat this incorrect response. The child 
should be trained to avoid all tendencies to guess and
-P-A-G-E-27
Lesson Types in Primary Grades 27 
  should be taught to be sure of the correctness of his 
response. 
e. Reviews. If a habit of response is to be firmly 
and permanently fixed, a single period of drill is not 
sufficient, but systematically arranged drills should occur 
from time to time. At first, the drill should occur at 
frequent intervals; for instance, every day. The time 
elapsing between the periods should gradually lengthen 
until they are discontinued altogether ; for instance, every 
“other day, twice a week, once a week, once every two 
weeks, once a month, once every two months, once a 
year. 
4. The Appreciation Lesson. The appreciation les- 
son is one in which the aim is to develop the power to 
appreciate the beautiful, the noble, and the humorous in 
the social relationship, nature, art, music, literature, and 
the industrial world. This power of appreciation does 
more, perhaps, to bring joy into life than any other one 
phase of education. 
Experience teaches that what one appreciates is a mat- 
ter of training. A person enjoys the music to which he 
is accustomed ; he loves the literature which he has had 
constantly presented to him; or he loves the pictures 
which have been a part of his daily life. 
In training for appreciation in music, literature, art, 
nature, social life, and other fields, the teacher should 
begin with the simple things and gradually lift the child 
to a higher plane of appreciation. In literature she 
will begin with the stories and poems which most appeal 
to him at that period; she will then select those of more 
literary merit but similar in content for the succeeding 
attempts. Thus she will gradually lead the child to love 
and to appreciate the higher forms of literature.
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 How to Teach Primary Grades   
The attitude of the teacher toward the material is of 
paramount importance. She should appreciate to the 
fullest, else she cannot arouse the desired emotion within 
the child. She should avoid allowing her emotions to 
dominate the situation and thus force her view-point on 
the child. 
The child should be encouraged in the free expression 
of any emotion or idea which comes to him in the study. 
He should be trained to study the different parts or 
situations and choose those which especially appeal to 
him. 
5. The Review Lesson. The review lesson is a 
recall of old subject-matter in a new way. This makes 
new associations which should increase the chances for 
future recall. Not only are the chances for recall more 
certain, but a better organization of subject-matter is 
effected. This increases the possibilities of its functioning 
in actual life. 
The review lesson, which may also be an examination 
or test lesson, should form a part of every recitation, 
inasmuch as the new knowledge gained should be con- 
stantly related to that already learned. 
6. The Recitation Lesson. This is the type of 
lesson in which the time is devoted to a report and a 
discussion of the problem which has been assigned for 
study. It is through this discussion that the teacher 
helps the child to clarify and to arrange his ideas sys- 
tematically. He should learn not only to systematize ‘his 
knowledge but he should be given opportunity to de- 
velop his power of expression, his initiative, his indi- 
viduality, his judgment, and his power of independence in 
thought and action. ‘

  CHAPTER III 
THE LESSON PLAN IN PRIMARY GRADES 
The day of haphazard teaching when the teacher called 
the pupils to class, borrowed a book from one of them, 
and then proceeded to examine their ability to recite 
\\ verbatim the subject-matter of the designated lesson, is a 
‘thing of the past. In the evolution of teaching methods, 
jt has been revealed that-this is a most wasteful pro- 
cedure—wasteful not only in time and energy but in re- 
sults as well. The teacher who has no definite idea of 
what she is to do or of the best methods of doing it, 
will accomplish very little. 
If the results desired in a lesson are secured without 
an unnecessary outlay of time and energy, the class pro- 
cedure must be carefully and definitely planned. This 
will enable the teacher to go before her class with a 
well defined idea of the content of the lesson, and a 
clear idea of what she expects the child to gain through 
the lesson. It will systematize the work, direct effort 
so that the desired results will follow, save time and 
energy, insure emphasis on the important points, prevent 
wandering, increase the self-confidence of the teacher, 
and inspire the confidence of the child. 
It is doubtful if a teacher ever reaches the point where 
it is unnecessary to plan the day’s work. It takes this 
re-planning to stimulate her own effort as well as that 
of the child. A much-used plan is likely to become dry 
and monotonous. 
30
-P-A-G-E-31
  Lesson Plan in Primary Grades 31   
Curriculum. The discussion of the curriculum 
should be pertinent to the lesson plan, as the selection of 
subject-matter is an important part of the primary teach- 
er’s work. No phase of education has undergone more 
radical change than that of the curriculum. Accord- 
ing to modern educational thought, the predominating 
elements in the curriculum should be the facts and activi- 
ties which begin with and are conditioned by the daily 
life of the child. In other words, the schoolroom ac- 
tivities should be near enough to his vital interests to 
make him feel their worth and to enable him to apply 
them in his daily life. The real test of education should 
be the difference it makes in daily life. 
McMurry says, “Whatever cannot be shown to have a 
plain relation to some real need of life, whether aes- 
thetic, ethical, or utilitarian in the narrow sense, must 
be dropped.” The application of this principle would do 
more to increase the efficiency of the schools than any 
other one thing. 
Subject-Matter. The first prerequisite to the lesson 
\V / plan is a thorough knowledge of the subject-matter. 
Many primary teachers fail because of the almost uni- 
versal belief that the subject-matter of the primary grades 
\ should not require study on the part of the teacher. 
\\ Many of the lessons in reading and literature will re- 
\ quire concentrated study in order that the teacher may 
} discover the attitude and purpose of the author, and that 
she may become imbued with the emotions and senti- 
/ ments of the selection. Many of the lessons in nature 
| study and social life will require careful study in order 
| that the facts may be organized in a systematic way.

-P-A-G-E-32
  32 How to Teach Primary Grades   
Teacher’s Motive. Another phase of the lesson plan 
which is closely linked with the subject-matter is that 
of the teacher’s motive. Just what is the specific thing 
that is to be accomplished through the use of this sub- 
ject-matter? What are the points to be stressed? Is it 
to increase skill or to form certain habits? Is it a 
lesson to develop knowledge or to develop appreciation? 
Whatever the motive, it is important that she determine 
definitely in advance of the class period just what she 
expects the child to gain through the lesson. 
Outline. Where a lesson or a lesson unit deals with 
more than one fact, a better organization may be effected 
if the subject-matter is outlined. A well organized out- 
line will prove very helpful in many of the lessons in 
Ianguage, nature study, and social life. This outline 
will serve as a guide to the teacher, enabling her to 
emphasize a few large points rather than waste time on 
unimportant details. 
In making an outline the teacher should consider the 
order which will be the most effective from the stand- 
point of the child’s interest. Wery few points should be 
attempted in any one lesson, otherwise it will close 
leaving the child with only a hazy idea of the facts 
involved. 
Child’s Motive. If the interest and attention of the 
child are to be of the best type, they should be based on 
his conscious desire to do the work. It would not be im- 
pertinence should he demand to know why he must do the 
thing required. It is one of the problems of the teacher 
to make him see and feel the practical reasons for the 
schoolroom procedure. In other words, the child must be 
conscious that the lesson holds something that he needs in 
his daily life. The teacher must study her subject-
-P-A-G-E-33
Lesson Plan in Primary Grades 33   
matter carefully to see what possibilities it holds in the 
way of motives or problems for the child. 
The selection of this motive should not be left to 
chance but should be carefully thought’ out. It should 
be near enough to his natural interests and activities to 
seem worth while.” A réal problem exists only when there 
is an actual desire to find the answer. 
The teacher must be careful not to set up problems 
which are too remote, as the child lives primarily in the 
present. School festivals, entertainments, general as- 
semblies, excursions, industrial activities, play, games, 
and school parties for parents are excellent as a source 
of motive. 
Class Procedure. The next part of the lesson plan 
deals with the class procedure. This is perhaps the 
most vital part of the plan, since in this the teacher 
must devise how she will handle the subject-matter in 
order to awaken the child’s interest, to arouse in him a 
desire to accomplish the task in hand, and to accomplish 
her motive. 
In planning for the class procedure she should con- 
sider the kind of response she is likely to receive and 
how to provide another question if the response is not as 
comprehensive as it should be. She should also consider 
how this response is to be handled in order that the 
child shall develop the proper initiative and acquire 
proper habits of organizing ideas and of judging values. 
An important factor in the class procedure is the ques- 
tion. Its purpose is to test knowledge and to stimulate 
thought. It should be clear, definite, concise, interest- 
ing, and adapted to the age of the child. As a general 
thing it should not be a direct question which can be 
answered by yes or no, neither should it be one which
-P-A-G-E-34
  
  34 How to Teach Primary Grades   
is declarative in form nor one which suggests the answer, 
as “Yesterday was a rainy day, was it not?” 
The thought-provoking question is one which stimulates 
thought; for example, “What would be a good title for 
this story?” This type of question should predominate in 
every lesson. It is doubtful if a lesson which involves 
questioning should ever be given without containing 
thought questions. 
In asking a question the teacher should direct it toward 
the entire class rather than toward one child, in order 
to keep all mentally alert. She should avoid repeating 
either question or answer. 
The Steps in a Lesson Plan. The Herbartian steps 
for the class procedure are preparation, presentation, com- 
parison, generalization or summary, and application. It 
is doubtful if all these steps enter into any one lesson, 
unless it be the inductive-deductive lesson. In the other 
types, the steps of (1) preparation, (2) presentation, (3) 
generalization or summary, and (4) application are the 
ones generally used. 
1. Preparation. The procedure should start off 
with a question or statement that will immediately at- 
tract the interest of the child to the problem in hand. 
The poor results attained in many lessons may be traced 
to the failure of the teacher to recognize the point of 
contact between the child and the lesson. The child 
must recognize from the first, that the lesson is one in 
which he has a part, one which appeals to him as worth 
while. Considerable time and energy will be saved if 
the first words of the teacher attract his attention. 
When new material is to be presented, the first step 
is the recall of any former experiences of the child which 
are pertinent to his understanding of the new one. If 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
Lesson Plan in Primary Grades 35   
he has not had this necessary experience, it must be 
supplied. 
2. Presentation. This step of preparation is fol- 
lowed by the presentation of the main points of the new 
subject-matter through questions, conversation, or illus- 
trative material arranged in psychological order. 
3. Summary. Another important factor in the 
class procedure is the provision for a summary of the 
important facts or points covered in the lesson. If this 
is not done the lesson will often prove a failure, because 
of the child’s inability to organize the points covered. 
The summary can often be made in answer to a skillful 
question by the teacher; thus, “What have we learned 
about letter writing today?” 
4. Application. Wherever knowledge has been ac- 
quired or a habit has been established, it should be fol- 
lowed by the application of this skill to daily life. Ifa 
number fact has been learned it should be used imme- 
diately in the child’s daily life. If this step of applica- 
tion cannot be provided for in a natural way, it would 
be well for the teacher to scrutinize closely her choice of 
subject-matter to discover if it be well selected. 
Assignment. Very often in the class pfocedure a 
question will arise which should be utilized as a problem 
for the assignment of the next lesson. These should be 
carefully noted and made use of. If the new problem 
does not arise out of the class discussion, the teacher 
should help the child to discover one in the new lesson. 
Illustrative Material. The plan should provide for 
any illustrative materials that will aid in making the 
lesson clearer and more vital to the child. The teacher 
will find the use of such material one of the most effec- 
tive devices that she can utilize. If cards or charts are  
-P-A-G-E-36
36 How to Teach Primary Grades   
used, these should be listed, together with any books of 
reference, with explicit page numbers. All material 
should be systematically arranged and placed in readi- 
ness before the recitation. 
If the teacher has more than one grade and does not 
have the time for a detailed plan in each subject, she 
will find that considerable time may be saved by taking 
a subject and planning the lessons in this for several 
days at one time. Then as she gains in experience, she 
will find that all that is necessary is a skeleton plan 
showing the motives, the outline of the subject-matter, 
and a few of the pivotal questions. 
Following will be found a general outline showing the 
form of the lesson plan: 
I. Topic: What the lesson is about. 
Il. The Teacher’s Motive: The definite things which 
the teacher expects to accomplish in the lesson. 
III. The Outline:. A systematic arrangement of the 
points to be covered in the lesson.

child expects to accomplish in the lesson. 
V. The Class Procedure: The preparation of the mind 
of the pupil for the lesson, the presentation of 
the subject-matter, the summary of the points 
made, and the application. 
A suggested arrangement for the class procedure is as 
follows:

  CHAPTER IV 
READING 
AIMS 
In this utilitarian age the first question that arises 
in the discussion of a subject pertains to its use or value. 
In the following reasons should be found a partial answer 
to the question of the value of reading. 
1. We read to gain information to direct us in our 
daily life; for instance, the weather forecast, the schedule 
of the trains, the prices of grain, or of market produce. 
2. Through reading we broaden our lives immeas- 
urably by learning of the experiences of others. Ordinary 
intelligence demands a knowledge of current events. 
3. As human nature has not changed since the begin- 
ning of authentic history, the reading of history aids us 
in judging intelligently the events of the present and also 
in foreseeing what is likely to occur in the future. 
4. We read for pleasure, for culture, and for spiritual 
help. It is in the truest sense that this reading directs 
our life, interprets our experiences, and determines our 
ideals. 
Tt would seem that reading is one of the most impor- 
tant subjects the child will have in the first three years 
of his school life. The art of reading once mastered, all 
literature, all history, and all other knowledge found in 
books, are within his grasp and he passes at once from 
the dependent to the independent stage. Hence, it is of 
38 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  Reading 39 
essential importance that the primary teacher be skilled 
in methods that will enable the child to learn to read 
with the least expenditure of time and energy. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
The evolution in the subject-matter of primary reading 
is a very interesting study, though only a very brief 
account of it can be given. The early readers were dis- 
tinctly A B C books, containing letters, syllables, ani 
certain extracts of a religious nature. The present-dav 
movement started with the Reformation. In this perioa, 
the books were distinctly religious in character, consist- 
ing of the Lord’s Prayer, the Commandments, and other 
scriptural selections. This religious element held sway 
until the eighteenth century, though other material was 
beginning to creep in. It then gave way to material 
about things to eat, moral tales, and the like. As time 
went on there were many changes until the present-day 
type of classical literature has become the standard. 
Under the old regime the teacher’s only problem was 
that of teaching the child how to read. But for many 
years there has been a growing realization that teaching 
“how to read” is only a part of the teacher’s problem. 
The more indispensable problem is that of training him 
in “what to read.” 
Much of the crime and immorality of the present is 
due to the trashy reading material which too often forms 
a large part of the library of the younger generation. 
For the sake of giving the child right ideals, the teacher 
must place before him the best in literature—that which 
will supply not only standards in language but ideals in 
character. His experiences should be reinforced by the 
teachings of others—the lessons which have been treas-
-P-A-G-E-40
40 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  ured in books, and these lessons should begin in child- 
hood. 
It is a serious mistake to postpone the reading of good 
literature until the child has mastered word-form and 
the other technique of reading. In the newer methods, 
the teacher tells the child stories and teaches him rhymes 
-and poems from the best literature and then uses these . 
as the subject-matter for the early reading lessons. Thus, 
from the very first the subject-matter has literary value. 
These early lessons are followed by the reading of 
books which contain interesting Mother Goose rhymes, 
fairy stories, myths, fables, legends, poems, and lessons 
of information. The selections should be simple, easily 
reproduced, and readily dramatized. Through the use of 
this class of literature the child gains many lessons in 
right conduct and becomes accustomed to good, refined 
English. 
There is such a wealth of material offered for primary 
reading that the teacher will find it a difficult task to 
select the best. Any material selected should possess the 
following qualities: (a) it should have literary merit; 
(b) it should be of a character to appeal to the child; 
(c) it should be simple in thought and form; and (d) 
it should contain familiar words.

METHOD 
Many methods of teaching reading have been ex- 
ploited. One of the first used is that known as the 
“alphabet method.” In this method the child first learned 
the letters of the alphabet, then these were joined into 
syllables, then these syllables into words. He was then 
ready to read sentences. This method has not been used 
by trained teachers since 1870, as it was found to be very 
slow and uninteresting. Then inasmuch as the name of 
the letter is no index to its sound, the child gained very 
slowly the power of making out new words for himself. 
It was really only as he unconsciously learned to connect 
the sound of the letter with its name that he could make 
out a word by spelling it. M-a-n does not sound like the 
’ word man if only the letters are named. It is only through 
practice that a child unconsciously connects the sounds of 
the letters with the letter names. 
The first effort at relieving the drudgery of the alpha- 
bet method by phonics was made by Ickelsamer in 1534. 
In the “phonic method” the child was taught the sounds 
of the letters, followed by the use of this knowledge in 
making out new words. After acquiring a number of 
words he was ready to begin the reading process. This 
method, also, was found to be slow, uninteresting, and 
mechanical, though it did give the child the power to 
make out many unknown words for himself.
-P-A-G-E-42
42 How to Teach Primary Grades   
Another method which found great favor was the 
“word method.” The child was first taught isolated 
words and then these words were joined into sentences. 
This was more rapid, more interesting, and less mechan- 
ical than the phonic or the alphabet method. However, 
it bordered closely upon the mechanical and was purely 
a memory process, making the child dependent upon 
outside aid when he came into contact with a new word. 
The method known as the “sentence method” was a 
contribution by Oliver. By this method the child was 
taught to read by whole sentences. This was more rapid 
and much more interesting, but it was a cumbersome 
method and, as in the word method, it did not give the 
child the power to make out new words for himself. 
From these early methods has evolved what is known 
as the “combination method.” This is a combination of the 
best features of the phonic, word, and sentence methods. 
The methods known as the story, the rhyme, and the 
conversation methods are specialized developments of 
the combination method. 
Story Method. According to the psychology of 
reading, the story which has been told to the child is a 
natural point of departure in teaching him to read. The 
desire for the story seems to be especially strong when 
he enters school, and it should prove a strong motive for 
his learning to read. Not only does the story awaken his 
interest in learning to read, but it also provides him with 
subject-matter of a nature that grips his attention and 
develops his power for connected thinking. 
The story should be carefully selected as to context and 
should abound in repetition. After it has been told until 
the child is perfectly familiar with its thought and word- 
ing, it is made the basis of a reading lesson, questions
-P-A-G-E-43
Reading 43 
  being asked to bring out the different thoughts. After 
the reading, he is guided in finding certain words in the 
story, those words being selected which are found in the 
vocabulary of his early reading book. 
Rhyme Method. The nursery rhymes that have 
stood the test of time furnish delightful reading matter 
for the little child. He has a rhythmic sense that is un- 
mistakable and the poem or rhyme selection should have 
the rhythmic element. It should also have the element of 
mystery to stir his imagination. The nursery and the 
nonsense rhymes fulfill both these conditions, since the 
rhythm of the jingle is irresistible, and its mingling of 
sense and nonsense arouses the imagination, while its 
fascination appeals even to the slowest and dullest pupil. 
The rhyme should be carefully selected as to context 
and should contain three or more of the words from the 
vacabulary of the child’s early book. After he has thor- 
oughly memorized this rhyme, it is made the basis of a 
reading lesson. After it is read, the words of the rhyme 
belonging to the vocabulary of the book are selected by 
the child and learned through drill. 
In discussing the use of the rhyme in teaching new 
words, Dr. McMurry’ says, “In this way they were learn- 
ing to recognize form by the aid of the context, which is 
the least mechanical, and the most independent approach 
to new words—either form or meaning—that there is. 
This plan, together with the fact that the children were 
already sharing with the teacher the responsibility of 
deciding the correctness of answers, gave promise of 
rapid development of self-reliance in the class.” This is 
also true in the use of the story and the conversation 
methods.

-P-A-G-E-44
  44 How to Teach Primary Grades   
Conversation Method. In the conversation method 
the teacher enters into conversation with the child about 
his play, home experiences, or any other of his activities, 
and after an oral discussion of this topic she suggests 
the writing of the story on the board. It is then made 
the basis of a reading lesson. As in other methods, he 
is guided in selecting certain words which belong to the 
vocabulary of his first book. 
Incidental Reading. If reading is to develop as a 
natural and a necessary process, every opportunity must 
be utilized for emphasizing it in connection with other 
schoolroom activities. For instance, the teacher says, 
“TI want every one to rise,” writing the word rise as she 
pronounces it. The next time she says, “I want every 
one to ,’ and instead of pronouncing rise, she 
writes it on the board. 
Recognition of the names of each child may be taught 
in this way as, “I want John to erase the board.” As 
the word John is pronounced it is written on the board. 
The next time she says, “I want to erase the 
board,” writing the name John instead of pronouncing it. 
In language the names of poems and stories, and char- 
acters in the dramatization may be developed incidentally. 
Nature study, music, number work, and games should 
also furnish abundant opportunity for incidental reading. 
Silent Reading. Silent reading is the gathering of 
thought from the printed page. This is a very important 
part of primary reading, as reading should always be a 
process of thought-getting. The child should be taught 
from the first day of his school life that every sentence 
is the embodiment of a thought—a thought that is highly 
important and interesting from his standpoint. 
There is an erroneous idea that all reading in the   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  Reading 45   
schoolroom should be oral. When we stop to consider, 
we find that practically all the reading done in real life is 
silent reading. Even in school life we find that the pro- 
portion of silent reading done is much greater than that 
of oral reading. 
Rate in Silent Reading. Extensive experiments have 
been conducted to prove the relative value of the rate 
with which thought is gathered from the printed page. 
These experiments have developed the fact that the 
rapid reader is a more intelligent reader than the slow 
reader, that his impressions are more intensive and more 
vivid, and that he retains the thought longer. In addi- 
tion to these important advantages the rapid reader saves 
considerable time and energy in reading an equal amount 
of subject-matter. The conclusion is that the teacher 
should strive from the beginning to train the child to 
become a rapid reader, first, through the instantaneous 
recognition of words and groups of words, and then 
through practice in the rapid reading of sentences and 
paragraphs. 
Oral Reading. Good oral reading is the effective 
voicing of a thought as it is gathered from the printed 
page. This will involve the immediate recognition of 
words, the correct interpretation of the author’s thought, 
a clear enunciation, correct articulation, correct position, 
and a desire to please the audience. The child must have 
much training in thought-getting before he is able to read 
ina pleasing way. Actual oral reading does not begin for 
several weeks after he has entered school, as he is not 
capable of gathering thought from the printed page until 
he has gained some facility in the recognition of words. 
Expression. One of the bugbears to the teacher of 
oral reading is expression. In the older methods, one
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  way of training for expression was to have the child 
count a certain number of times for. each punctuation 
mark; for example, for a comma he paused long enough 
to count one, for a semicolon two, for a colon three, and 
for a period four. He was also told to let his voice rise 
or fall for certain marks. Another method was that of 
imitation of the teacher’s reading or that of some one in 
the class. It will be readily recognized that these meth- 
ods are purely mechanical. 
Oral expression is based entirely on the reader’s inter- 
pretation of the thought. Silent reading always pre- 
cedes oral reading, since thought-getting is a prerequisite 
to thought-giving. Much of the burden of training the 
child to read with natural expression would be removed 
if the teacher would realize that good oral reading de- 
pends upon the grasping of the thought. The teacher’s 
problem is to lead the child to this proper interpretation 
of the thought. This may be done through the use of 
stories, pictures, hand work, dramatization, and questions. 
1. Pictures. The teacher should find the child’s 
instinctive love for the picture a great help in teaching 
reading. The picture found in connection with the read- 
ing lesson is of great importance, inasmuch as it usually 
tells the gist of the story. It attracts his attention and 
arouses his interest. It is not a waste of time to study 
it carefully, if the child’s attention is directed by well 
selected questions and suggestions, thus enabling him not 
merely to see the separate objects in the picture but to 
grasp its story. 
This thoughtful study of the picture should be bene- 
ficial from the standpoint of arousing interest in the 
reading lesson, as well as from that of aiding in oral 
expression. If the child reads a part of the story in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
* Reading 47 
  picture, he will be eager to read the remainder from the 
printed page. , 
The grasping of the thought and the good oral expres- 
sion of this thought depend upon the mental picture back 
of the oral utterance. If the visual picture is wisely used, 
it helps the child to form this necessary mental picture. 
The reading of the lesson will verify and add to, or 
modify the picture story. In order to do this, it will be 
necessary to make constant reference to it both during 
and after the reading of the lesson. 
2. Handwork. Free - hand illustrations of the 
printed story by means of pencil, chalk, or crayon pic- 
tures, free-hand paper cutting, and clay modeling will 
prove helpful in developing the mental pictures. 
3. Dramatization. To dramatize or to act out a 
story is a natural instinct of the child. This instinct 
is a good foundation on which to build in training him 
to read with natural expression, inasmuch as dramatic 
action is a great source of delight during the primary 
period. This dramatization, or playing the story pre- 
pares him to read with appreciation and expression, 
since it makes the situation real to him. He sees the 
characters act, he hears them talk, in fact, he lives the 
story. The thoughtful teacher will use dramatization 
as much as possible in her reading work, dramatizing all 
stories and rhymes which contain the dramatic element. 
There are two forms of dramatization used in the 
schoolroom. One form may be termed free or natural 
dramatization, in which the child acts out the story in 
a free manner without any reference to the descriptive 
parts of the story or to the actual wording; the other 
form is similar to the dialogue in which the parts are 
assigned and each character reads his part from the 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  48 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  
book, some other member of the class reading the 
descriptive part. It is well to plan to have as many 
children take part as possible, changing the characters 
frequently. 
Supplementary Reading. Fluency in reading comes 
only through well directed practice. The teacher should 
supplement the reading of the required book by extra 
or supplementary reading. The specific purposes of 
this supplementary work are to increase the child’s skill 
in grasping the thought of the printed page, to insure 
greater fluency in the oral expression of the thought, 
and to insure greater proficiency in the recognition and 
pronunciation of words and phrases. 
In selecting the material for supplementary reading 
the teachers should select something worth while—some- 
thing having literary merit, but at the same time, of in- 
terest to the child. It should be easy reading, full of 
dramatic action, and the English should be unques- 
tioned. Much of the material for supplementary work 
may be obtained from children’s magazines, school jour- 
nals, well-selected readers, and through conversation with 
the child on some interesting topic. 
Punctuation and Capitals. The use of the period 
and the interrogation mark at the end of the sentence, 
the use of the capital in the first word of the sentence, 
and in the names of people may be taught incidentally in 
connection with reading during the first year. When the 
teacher has occasion to write a sentence on the board she 
remarks, “I am beginning this sentence with a capital 
letter for that is the way we begin a sentence.” This may 
be varied by asking, “With what kind of letter should I 
begin this sentence?” or “Why do I begin this sentence 
with a capital letter?” As she finishes writing the sen-
-P-A-G-E-49
OE TE ON SOE LE Eel nn te 
Reading 49   
tence she says, “I will place a period here to show that 
this is all of the sentence,” or “I will place a question 
mark here to show that this is a question.” The use 
of the capital for the names of people should be taught 
in this same incidental way. 
In the second grade she should teach the use of the 
quotation marks by leading the child to discover their 
use as they appear in the reading lessons. The use of 
the comma after words of address may be taught in the 
same way. When the child is reading a poem he should 
be led to discover that each line begins with a capital. 
In the third grade the incidental work of the first and 
second grades should be reviewed, and the rule that the 
names of the week begin with capitals, but that the names 
of the seasons do not, should be added. 
Script and Print. There is a difference of opinion 
as to the time for teaching script and print to a begin- 
ning class. Some would teach print only; some script 
only; while others would teach the script and print 
together. If it were practicable, it would seem best to 
teach only print at first, as all the reading matter with 
which the child comes in contact is printed. Then, in the 
early lessons, one of the aims is to make him familiar 
with the words found in the vocabulary of his first book. 
It would seem better to teach these words in the form in 
which they occur in the book. In the absence of the 
proper equipment for printing, a compromise may be 
made by using the script on the board and having the 
printed perception cards for the drill work. 
Alphabet. Through the work in phonics and pen- 
manship the child gradually learns to recognize the let- 
ters of the alphabet in irregular order. This is all that is 
necessary for present needs. He does not have a prac-
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  tical need for a knowledge of the alphabet in regular 
order until he begins to use the dictionary, the telephone 
directory, the city directory, the index of a book, or a 
card catalogue. These needs are not likely to arise be- 
for the third school year; hence, so far as utility is con- 
cerned, this would be the proper time for teaching the 
alphabet in its regular order. As a concession to public 
opinion, many primary teachers find it advisable to teach 
the alphabet in regular order by the close of the first 
year. 
Standard in Reading. A standard by which to 
measure progress is very helpful in any work. The 
standard in primary reading is fluency in the gathering of 
the thought of the printed page and fluency in the oral 
expression of this thought. If the subject-matter is 
well selected as to thought and word content, this is not 
too high a standard for the average primary class.

PRE-PRIMER WORK 
(READING—CONTINUED ) 
AIM 
Opinion varies as to the proper time for placing ‘the 
book in the hands of the child. In some methods of read- 
ing, he has the book from the first day, in others, not for 
some weeks. This latter procedure is based on the theory 
that he has not learned to recognize words, and so has 
little use for a book. 
The ability to recognize words is an essential element 
in independent reading, and until the child becomes 
familiar with a few words he cannot read independently. 
Many teachers have found that it is better to have these 
early reading lessons from the blackboard or from the 
home-made chart. By using the board or chart she is 
better able to hold the interest of the class and to con- 
centrate the attention on the desired points. If the child 
has a book at first, he is likely to lose interest in it long 
before he can read, and it often results in the formation 
of incorrect habits in reading. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
However, the teacher does not delay the reading proc- 
ess until the child has learned a vocabulary sufficient 
for independent reading, but the first few weeks of the 
51

beginning year are spent in preparing him for the work 
with the book. The vocabulary of the first fifteen or 
twenty pages of the first book to be read is taught 
through the use of stories, rhymes, poems, games, and 
conversations. 
The story, rhyme, or poem selected should contain 
three or more of the words found in this vocabulary. 
The words need not be taught in the order found in the 
book, but may be grouped to fit the material selected. 
The following rhymes, and list of stories are interest- 
ing and eminently suitable for these early lessons. 
Rhymes 
“Jack be nimble, 
Jack be quick, 
Jack jumped over the candle stick.” 
“Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn, 
The sheep are in the meadow, 
The cows are in the corn. 
Where is the little boy 
Who looks after the sheep? 
He is under the haystack fast asleep.”   “Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, 
Eating her curds and whey. 
There came a big spider, 
And sat down beside her, 
And frightened Miss Muffet away.”   
“Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep, 
And can’t tell where to find them. 
Leave them alone and they’ll come home, 
Wagging their tails behind them.”

METHOD 
This material is first developed orally and then used 
as a reading lesson, As a rule the teacher will find it 
a good plan to correlate these early lessons with the 
language work. All the oral work in connection with 
the story, rhyme, or poem may be carried forward in the 
language period. This oral work should precede the 
oral reading by two or more days. The child should be 
perfectly familiar with the part of the story or the poem 
to be read before he is allowed to read it.

Ill. Teacher’s Motive: (1) To lead the child to real- 
ize that to read means acquiring stories, poems, and

the chart, the Mother Goose rhyme, “Little Miss Muffet.” 
(3) To have him learn to recognize at sight, the words 
sat, on, he, and came. (These words are taken from the 
vocabulary of the first 15 pages of the primer.) 
IV. Child’s Motive: (1) To read the rhyme as the 
teacher did. (2) To find certain words in the rhyme. 
V. Class Mechanics: (1) The rhyme should be writ- 
ten on the board or printed on a chart, with a decided 
space between each word. In the beginning the child 
does not have the ability to differentiate the single word 
from the group, and for this reason each word should 
stand out vividly. (2) The child should not be permitted 
to point at the separate words in reading, as this will 
result in the words, rather than the phrase and sentence, 
being the unit of thought. This rule does not apply 
when the search for words begins, as the purpose of this 
is not reading but to find the words—this second reading 
being merely a means to the end.

Presentation: “Here it is on the 
board (or chart). Who will read 
it for me?” The teacher has it read 
by individual children. She indi- 
cates each part as it is read by plac- 
ing a pointer under the entire length 
of the line. Then the rhyme may 
be read in two sections by having 
one child read the section that tells 
what Little Miss Muffet was doing, 
and another read the section about 
the spider. 
“Who will read the part that tells 
where Little Miss Muffet sat? Who 
will read the part that tells what 
she was doing? Who will read the 
part that tells what the spider did? 
Then read the part that tells about

“I wonder if you could find where 
it says sat?” The child is trained 
to read until he comes to the word 
sat. He then makes a mark around 
it. The teacher should have percep- 
tion cards with the printed form of 
the word on one side and the writ- 
ten form on the other. These cards 
are placed with printed side exposed, 
where they can be seen by the entire 
class. “I wonder if you see a card 
that has sat on it?” When the card 
is selected the choice should not be

Rat. ‘I will not,” said the Cat. ‘I will not,’ said the Pig. 
‘I will, then,’ said the Little Red Hen. So she cut the 
wheat. 
“Then she said, ‘Who will take this wheat to the 
mill?’ ‘I will not,’ said the Rat. ‘I will not, said the 
Cat. ‘I will not,’ said the Pig. ‘I will, then,’ said the 
Little Red Hen. So she took it to the mill and had it 
made into flour. 
“Then she said, ‘Who will make this flour into bread?” 
‘T will not,’ said the Rat. ‘I will not,’ said the Cat. ‘I 
will not,’ said the Pig. ‘I will, then,’ said the Little Red 
Hen. And so she made the flour into bread. 
“Then she said, ‘Who will eat this bread?’ ‘I will,’ 
said the Rat. ‘I will,’ said the Cat. ‘I will,’ said the Pig. 
‘No, you will not,’ said the Little Red Hen, ‘I shall eat 
it myself,’ and she did.”

dramatized a number of times. The 
characters should be changed each 
time.

“Do you like the story of the Lit-

on the board (or chart). 
A little red hen found “Who is ready to read the sentence 
a grain of wheat. that tells what the Little Red Hen

read as she places a pointer under 
the entire length of the sentence. The 
child should not be allowed to point 
at the individual words ‘except when 
he is hunting a certain word in the 
sentence. Pointing out each word 
causes word-reading instead of 
thought-reading.

said “What did the Little Red Hen 
say?” A child reads the sentence. 
“What did the Rat say?” A child 
reads the sentence. If he leaves out 
“said the Rat,” the teacher should 
ask, “Who said that?” and allow him 
to add “said the Rat.” 
The teacher continues by asking 
questions until the entire lesson is 
read. 
If there is time the other sections 
of the story should be read, or a child 
may reread the first section of the 
story. In the reading, the teacher 
will usually find it necessary to ask 
a question about each sentence to 
serve as a guide in reading that spe- 
cial sentence. 
After reading the story, certain 
words are to be taught as sight 
words. “Read the sentence about 
finding the wheat. What did the 
Little Red Hen say? Who can find 
where it says will in this sentence?” 
The child should be trained to read 
until he comes to the desired word 
and then stop. Before asking him 
to find a certain word, the teacher 
will usually find it better to call the 
child’s attention to the sentence con- 
taining the word, as in the above 
instance. “Do you see will in an- 
other sentence?” The word will is 
pointed out in the other sentences. 
If the story is on the board, the 
child is allowed to place a mark en- 
tirely around the word. This sets 
the word off from the other words, 
and makes it easier for him to see

Each sight word should be on a 
perception card. If the story is on 
the blackboard, it will be best to 
have the word printed on one side 
and written on the other. The printed 
side is exposed, but the child 
trained to reverse the card for a 
more accurate comparison with the 
word in the written 
printed side is used in all the drill 
lessons. After a few weeks the teach- 
er will find that the child will not 
need to have the written word on 
the card, inasmuch as he can success- 
fully compare the printed word with 
the written word on the board. 
If the child chooses the wrong card, 
he should not be corrected, but al- 
lowed to discover his own mistake 
by comparing it with the word in the 
story. If the teacher will follow this 
rule, she will help him to form the 
very valuable habit of depending 
upon himself. 
“What did the Rat say? Read the 
entire sentence. Who can find where 
it says 1?” The plan used in devel- 
oping the word will is used in de- 
veloping I, not, and said. After all 
the words are developed there should 
be a drill lesson on these words to 
help fix them in mind. An illustra- 
tive drill lesson will be given in Chap- 
ter VI, pages 75 to 76.

The child should not be confused by giving new sen- 
tences too often. The aim is not that of teaching new 
words but that of getting the thought of the sentence. 
By using little games and devices, several days may be 
spent on the same sentence. 
When the child takes up the book, the silent reading 
should be used whenever an opportunity offers. If the 
sentence is imperative, he may read it silently then act 
it out; if it is an interrogative sentence he may read it 
silently, then answer the question; if the sentence can 
be illustrated he may read it silently and then illustrate 
it by drawing, or paper cutting.

to Chapter VII, pages 88 to 94.

CHAPTER VI 
THE DRILL LESSON 
(READING—CONTINUED ) 
AIM 
The ideal way for the child to learn to recognize the 
word arid the phonic symbols would be through their use 
in the subject-matter of the reading lessons. However, 
this has not been satisfactorily accomplished. Wherever 
an attempt has been made to leave word mastery to the 
repetition of the word in the context, the subject-matter 
has suffered. It is either choppy and pedantic because of 
the necessity for the frequent repetition of the words, 
or else the thought-getting process has suffered. This 
is due to the inability of the child to recognize words 
automatically. If he is to be left free to give his entire 
time and attention to the thought, the mastery of words 
is an essential element in the reading process. 
The recognition of the important words of the vocabu- 
lary of the lessons that the child reads should be reduced 
to an automatic basis. It is the function of the drill 
lesson to accomplish this. The teacher’s mistake is not 
that she does such work too well, but that she makes it 
the final end of the reading lesson. She leads the child 
to believe that he can read when he is merely able to 
pronounce words. 
70
-P-A-G-E-71
The Drill Lesson 71 
  METHOD 
Constant drill upon word groups, sight words, and 
phonetic sounds is necessary until the recognition is 
mechanical, allowing the child to give his entire attention 
to the thought. These drills should be carried on at a 
period apart from the regular reading recitation. 
THE LESSON PLAN 
As previously stated, the essential points in an intelli- 
gently conducted drill are (1) a motive, (2) a clear idea 
of the desired response, (3) attentive repetition, (4) no 
exceptions in the correct response, (5) reviews, and (6) 
application. 
1. Motive. Much of the drill work on words, 
phrases, and phonetic symbols is wasted time because the 
child does not see the use or feel the need for the desired 
habit, consequently he feels little interest in the accomp- 
lishment of the results demanded. It has already been 
shown that ‘a motive or aim will add interest to the learn- 
ing process and result in a saving of time and energy. 
The stronger and more interesting this motive, the better 
the attention will be, and the sooner will the desired 
results be attained. 
If the conditions were ideal the drill work should come 
when the child realizes that his future progress in read- 
ing depends upon the instantaneous recognition of the 
words. The teacher should lead him to see and feel this 
need; for instance, after the new words of the next 
day’s reading lesson have been presented by some ap- 
proved method, the next step is a drill on these words, 
with the purpose to make their recognition automatic. 
The teacher may supply a motive in the following
-P-A-G-E-72
  
  72 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  manner: “Boys and girls, do you know that these words 
which we have just found in the sentences will be in 
tomorrow’s reading lesson? What should we do if we 
want to be able to read our lesson without help? Yes, 
we must be able to recognize them instantly wherever we 
see them. Let us see, then, how quickly we can learn 
them.” This is the highest type of motive and should 
be used frequently. It may be supplemented by the 
desire to play a game which involves the recognition of 
the words or phonetic symbols. 
2. A Clear Idea of the Response. A clear idea of 
the response to be drilled on is a very essential factor in 
the drill lesson. In a drill on words and phrases the 
teacher should see that the child hears the words cor- 
rectly, can pronounce them correctly, and knows their 
meaning or use in the sentence. She should also make 
sure that he visualizes the words correctly. Ina drill on 
phonetic sounds she should make sure that he hears the 
sound correctly, that he utters it correctly, and that he 
visualizes the symbol correctly. It is a wise teacher who 
akes every precaution to avoid error in drill. 
3. Attentive Repetition. In order to establish a 
habit permanently there must be many repetitions of the 
desired response. This repetition must be with the full 
attention inasmuch as repetition without direct attention 
is a great loss of time. 9 
Even when a child has a strong motive with which to 
start, it is a difficult task to hold his attention while the 
necessary repetition is going on. Strayer’ says, “No 
matter how strong the motive with which we start, any 
one of us will grow weary when the task imposed requires 
many repetitions. It is even more difficult for children 
  
1A Brief Course in the Teaching Process, 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  The Drill Lesson 73   
to keep their attention fixed for any considerable length 
of time. We must, therefore, plan carefully to conduct 
the drill in such a way that the maximum of attention 
may be secured.” The use of little games, devices, and 
other variations in procedure will assist greatly in secur- 
ing this attention. 
Not only does the game or device hold the attention 
better but it has the added advantage of making use of 
the law of association, which is an important element 
in the formation of a habit. 
The drill should be short and snappy if the attention 
is of a desirable type. When the interest begins ‘to wane 
the drill should be stopped or the method of procedure 
changed. It is much more profitable to have two short 
interesting drills than one of longer duration without 
the full attention. 
a. Devices. Cards made of stiff paper or tag-board 
are indispensable in drill work. Upon these cards the 
words or sounds should be printed or written in type 
large enough to be seen readily across the room. These 
may be either purchased from the company publishing 
the basal reader or made by the teacher. For this work 
she would need the Rubber Type Chart Outfit. This may 
be purchased from A. Flanagan Company, Chicago. 
Many devices and games for drill lessons will be found 
in primary school journals. The following devices are 
good: 
(1) Cards are pinned where they can be easily seen. 
Two children are given a pointer each. The game is to 
see which can first touch the word or sound named by 
the teacher. 
(2) The teacher holds the card before the class for
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  an instant, then removes it and calls on some one to 
name it. | 
(3) Three or more children stand in a row, facing 
the class. A word-card is given to each. When the 
teacher names a card, the child holding that card turns 
around, 
(4) The teacher exposes a card for an instant, then 
calls on some one to name the card. If he answers cor- 
rectly, he is given the card. The game is to see who 
can get the most cards. 
(5) ‘Postman. One child is selected for the postman 
or mail-carrier. The cards represent letters. The post- 
man passes around the class, leaving a letter (card) on 
certain desks. Each child who receives a letter comes 
before the class and reads (names) his letter. The post- 
man is changed and the game proceeds as before. 
4. No Exceptions. The first repetition should be 
so planned that there will be little opportunity for error. 
The habit of guessing in a drill should never be per- 
mitted, since every error makes the work of fixing the 
correct habit more difficult. The child should be trained 
to recognize when he does not know a word or symbol. 
5. Reviews. If the recognition of the words, 
phrases, or phonic sounds is to become a permanent 
habit, it is necessary to continue this repetition from time 
to time until the recognition becomes automatic. The 
time should vary with the relative difficulty and impor- 
tance of the different words and sounds. If the teacher 
has the purpose of the drill in mind she should readily 
recognize when it has been accomplished. 
6. Application. If the motive established in the 
drill lesson is to be a vital one, the lesson or series of 
lessons should end in the step of application. If the 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  The Drill Lesson a   
motive is to enable him to read the new lesson, he should 
study the lesson. If the motive is to play a game, the 
lesson should end by the playing of the game.

continued until these two seem to 
know the words. Then the chil-

  CHAPTER VII 
PHONICS 
(READING—CONTINUED) 
AIM 
The final efficiency of any method of teaching reading 
is considerably decreased if it does not develop the power 
for independent reading. 
Since a great many of the words of the English lan- 
guage are phonetic in their form, a knowledge of their 
elementary sounds should enable the child to pass to the 
independent stage in the reading process. In other words, 
a knowledge of these sounds should help him to recog- 
nize words new to his eye but already in his spoken 
vocabulary. This process is usually designated as 
phonics. 4 
The subject of phonics as a part of the process of 
teaching a child to read, may be defined as the teaching 
of the sounds of letters and groups of letters and the 
training of the child to use this knowledge in making out 
for himself the unknown phonetic words of his reading 
lessons. 
The aim of the phonic work is (1) to train the child 
to hear words correctly; (2) to help him gain control 
over the organs of speech necessary to clear articula- 
tion and correct enunciation; and (3) to help him gain 
the power of making out new words for himself. 
7
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  SUBJECT-MATTER 
The subject-matter of the phonic lessons should be 
coérdinated with the vocabulary of the child’s reading 
book and should consist of the sounds of the letters and 
groups of letters which go to make the phonetic words of 
this vocabulary. 
This subject-matter should consist of consonant 
sounds, diphthongs, and sound families. 
If the teacher will examine lists of words she will find 
that many of them will fall into groups ending in the 
same combination of letters with the same sound; as 
may, gay, ray, day, pay. These words are said to belong 
to a word or sound family. In the above instance the 
word or sound family would be the ay (4)family. Fol- 
lowing, is a suggestive list of word or sound families: 
ick, ave, ow (now), an, ad, un, id, ow (snow), ame, 
at, ack, as, eep, ake, in, all, ope, ore, ich, uck, est, ung, 
ind, ound, eck, ank, ouse, ied, eat, oom, ole, ong, ide, 
owl, ace, ost, een, ain, ook, art, eg, orn, ime, ie, ind, 
ish, ane, air, ear, idge, ue, ight, oat, ood, oss, ar, ath, 
irst, ush, isk, oy, ool, unk. 
As the aim of the phonetic work is to train the child 
to independence in recognizing unknown words that are 
meeting his eye daily, those sounds should be selected that 
will give him the knowledge which is of immediate use. 
Course of Study 
If the teacher will carefully study the following direc- 
tions she should find it possible to make her own outline 
for the teaching of phonics in connection with any book. 
1. For the first few weeks, the teacher should train
-P-A-G-E-79
Phonics 79 
  the child to hear the sound in words. This should be 
followed by a training in uttering words phonetically. 
This is entirely oral and should be kept up until he can 
tell instantly what a word is when it is uttered phonet- 
ically, and until he exhibits some skill in uttering words 
phonetically. 
2. After the first step has been successfully accom- 
plished, the child is ready for the second stage, which is 
the association of the sound with its written or printed 
symbol. ; 
As a preparation for this step the words of the vocab- 
ulary of the reading book should be grouped according 
to the first letter of the sound family, which is usually 
the first vowel of the word. It will be found much 
better, especially in the first year’s work, to consider 
words of only one syllable, since words of two or more 
syllables present difficulties which are beyond the grasp 
of a beginner in phonics. After grouping the words as 
suggested above, the next problem is to select the con- 
sonants and the sound families that will be most helpful 
to the child in making out the unknown words of his 
reading lessons. The teacher should go through each 
group of words and select those which have two or more 
words belonging to the same sound-family. Only those 
words should be considered whose endings are common 
enough to make it worth while to teach them. For in- 
stance, ay is a common ending but ith is not. 
Following will be found an illustration of the above 
plan for making out a phonetic course of study as ap- 
plied to the Free and Treadwell Primer, published by 
Row, Peterson, Chicago. 
The word vocabulary in the back of the book was the 
basis for this course. A column was arranged for each 
   
-P-A-G-E-80
80 How to Teach Primary Grades   
of the vowels, as a, e, i, o, u, y. The words of the 
vocabulary were then grouped according to the first 
vowel of the sound-family. All words of more than one 
syllable and those whose endings are not common were 
eliminated. The column under the vowel a was as 
follows: plant, cat, and, make, man, had, made, ran, am, 
can, came, hang, rat, gnaw, gave, that, grass, thank, pan- 
cake, saw, fast, ate, tail, fat, shake, ant. These words 
were regrouped according to the sound-family. Where 
the list contained only one word of a family this word 
was eliminated, since the first word must be taught as a 
sight word. If the second word was not in the vocabu- 
lary the family would not be of immediate help to the 
child. 
After this regrouping, the list was as follows, cat, rat; 
that, fat, at; man, ran, can, pan; make, cake, shake; 
gnaw, saw. Consequently, the families which were to be 
taught under this a column were the at, an, ake, and aw 
families. 
As previously stated, the first word of the family 
series should be taught as a sight word, then when the 
second word appears in the vocabulary, the family should 
be taught, using the first word as a foundation. For 
example, the word cat is taught as a sight word. The 
second word, rat is on page 36. Then the at family 
should be taught on the day the child needs to know the 
word rat. Rat should not be taught as a sight word but 
the child should be trained to sound it out. Hereafter, 
the teacher should insist that he sound out any word 
belonging to the at family. In order that he may do this 
it is necessary for her to look ahead and see that he has 
been taught the consonant sounds which he will need in 
sounding out these words. The complete phonetic course 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  Phonics 81   
of study is shown in the following list. The italicized 
words are the foundation words for the families which 
are to be taught. The family is given in parentheses at 
the time when it should be taught. The words which are 
starred are phonetic words which are not taught as sight 
words but which are sounded out by the child. The num- 
ber signifies the number of the page in the primer on 
which the words appear as a new word.

The work for each succeeding book should be a con- 
tinuation of this vocabulary. If the teacher should de- 
sire to do less work in phonics she may eliminate some 
of the less necessary families. 
After a few months’ or a year’s study in phonics, the 
process may be shortened by teaching the sounds of 
certain combinations of letters without reference to the 
family idea, as in the combination ai. If this is taught 
the child can make out almost any word containing this 
sound as mail, paid, rain, and wait. Following is a 
suggestive list of combinations which may be taught; ou, 
ea, or, on, ar, ie, ir, ur, aw, 0a, oi, au, ai. 
In the latter part of the third grade the teacher may 
begin to train the child to use the dictionary, teaching 
him the long and the short diacritical marks, and then 
training him to look up words containing those sounds, 
She should help him to sound out these words. Later, 
she may extend the use of the dictionary by teaching 
some of the other diacritical marks that he will need in 
looking up the pronunciation of the new words in his 
reading lesson. A child has very little use for the dia- 
critical marks except as he uses the dictionary. Follow- 
ing is a list of some of the common diacritical marks 
which may be taught in connection with dictionary

study: 4-arm; a-at; a-all; a-care; e-fern; 6-orb; u-rude; 
u-full; t-urn ; 66-food ; 00-foot. 
Beacon Plan. Another idea for grouping phonetic 
words is advocated in the Beacon reader. In this method 
the long and the short vowel sounds are linked with the 
initial consonant. For example, pa-t, sa-p, ra-n. 
The short vowels are taught first, since the short sound 
is a part of many more words than is the long sound. 
After the child is thoroughly familiar with the use of the 
short sound, he is taught that the e added to the end of 
the word makes the vowel tell its name. 
The subject-matter for the phonetic work according to 
this plan would be something as follows: the short vowels, 
a (long), ai, ay; i (long), ie, y; o (long), oe, 0a, ow; 
u (long), ue, ew; e (long), ea, ee; oy, oi, ow, ou, aw, 
au, oo, ea, en, ur, ir, ight, ing, 00 (wood), ar, er, 
eight, etc. 
The course of study would be outlined according to 
the directions previously given. 
After the child has been taught a vowel sound he 
should have practice in blending it with the consonants. 
When he has been taught short i, he should then blend 
it with the common consonants, as bi, ti, fi, si, etc. The 
more common consonants should be taught before teach- 
ing a vowel in order that he may not be hampered in 
using his phonetic knowledge in making out the phonetic 
words of his vocabulary. 
METHOD 
If the teacher is to use the phonetic element success- 
fully in teaching the child to read, she must have a 
thorough knowledge of the elementary sounds of the
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 How to Teach Primary Grades 
English language. If she is not familiar with these sounds, 
she should master them before attempting to use them 
in the classroom. One of the most satisfactory ways 
of learning these sounds is to repeat slowly, three or 
four times, any familiar word containing the given sound. 
An effort should be made to give this sound distinctly. 
For instance, to obtain the sound of b, the word cad 
should be pronounced. It should be pronounced again 
more slowly as ca-b. The voice should be allowed to 
linger on the last sound, which is the sound of b. It 
will be well for the teacher to spend much time practic- 
ing on the following list of words. She should not stop 
until each sound can be given correctly. To test the 
correctness of a sound, she should pronounce slowly 
other words containing the same sound. 
To obtain the sound of b practice on cab and ball. 
To obtain the sound of ¢ practice on cat. 
To obtain the sound of f practice on stiff and fan. 
To obtain the sounds of the following consonants prac- 
tice on the words which are separated from the letter 
by a dash: d-bed, -day; g-rag, -get; h-hot; j-jump; 
k-king, -look; /-fall, -love; m-ram, -man; n-pan, -not; 
p-rap, -pan ; gu-queen ; r-bar, -rat ; s-kiss, -see ; t-pet, -tell ; 
v-love, -van; w-wet; #-box; y-you; 2-fuzz, -zone; 
sh-push, -she; ch-child; the breath sound of th-thin; the 
voice sound of th-then; wh-what. 
The sounds of the diphthongs and of the sound fami- 
lies should be developed and practiced in a manner 
similar to that used for the consonant sounds. 
The purpose of the phonic lesson is to develop the 
instantaneous association of the sound with its written 
or printed symbol, and to train the child to independence 
through the use of his phonetic knowledge. The drill
-P-A-G-E-87
Phonics 87   
for the instantaneous association of the symbols should 
be very thorough. ‘ 
As previously stated, after a sound family has been 
taught, the teacher should always insist that the pupil 
use this knowledge in making out new words containing 
this sound. If he has been taught the sound of m and of 
ay, and the word may presents itself to his eye for the 
first time, she should have him sound out this word by 
having him cover the ay which leaves m exposed; after 
he. has given this sound, he should be lead to discover 
that he knows ay. He should then make these sounds 
one after the other, which will give him the word may. 
This seems a slow process, and at first it is slow, as it 
would be much quicker and easier for the teacher to tell 
the child the word, but by taking time to train him to use 
these forms of control that he has already established, 
she is laying the foundation for independent study, which 
is valuable to the child. 
When the sound of the same combination of letters 
varies, as in ow, the child should first be taught the sound 
that occurs the more often in his reading vocabulary. 
Later, when he is taught the other sound and finds an 
unknown word containing this combination of letters he 
must try first the one and then the other, selecting the 
one which gives a word that makes good sense in the 
context. 
LESSON PLAN 
A preliminary ear and voice training in phonics is car- 
ried forward from the first day of school in the form of 
games or exercises. This work is entirely oral, and 
should be kept up until the child can clearly detect the 
phonetic sounds in simple words, and until he has gained
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 How to Teach Primary Grades   
some skill in uttering words phonetically. By allowing 
five minutes a day to this work it should be accomplished 
in from two to three weeks.

phonetically and until he has gained some skill in utter- 
ing words phonetically. He is then ready to begin the 
second step in the study of phonics, that is, the connect- 
ing of the sound with the sight symbol. The teacher 
should select some word which has been thoroughly 
taught as a sight word and proceed along the line of the 
following plans:

“Name this word for me. Let us

the word slowly two or three times. 
“This time I want you to say only 
the first part while I cover up the 
last part.” This will leave the r ex- 
posed. “What is the sound of this 
letter? You tell me, Mary, John, 
Fenton.” For drill purposes the sin- 
gle letter + should be on the re- 
verse side of the card. “Let us see

on which are known sight-words and 
allows the children to point out any 
word containing the r sound. When 
a word is found it should be pro- 
nounced slowly to see if the sound 
is the same. If the children have a 
book the application may be made to 
the book. The lesson should close

that belong to the ay family. Let 
me see if you can tell what they are.” 
The words of this list must be the 
blending of previously taught con- 
sonant sounds and the ay sound. The 
teacher should help the children by 
covering up the ay, leaving the con- 
sonant exposed. She then uncovers 
the ay and has it sounded. She then 
leads them to blend the consonant 
sound with the sound family.

Application: “Open your book 
to tomorrow’s lesson. See if you can 
find a word belonging to the ay fam- 
ily.” When the word is found the 
teacher should help the children to 
sound it out. After a sound family 
is taught she should always insist 
that during a study period they sound

out any word containing this sound. 
“Let us see if we can learn this 
sound so that we may know it and 
be able to sound out words for our- 
selves. Let us write it on the board.” 
The teacher then has a drill on this 
family and any previously taught 
sounds. “What have we learned that 
will help us study by ourselves?”

  CHAPTER VIII 
THE STUDY LESSON 
(READING—CONTINUED ) 
A supervised study lesson in reading should consist of 
(1) the discovery of a problem, (2) the analysis of the 
difficulties, and (3) the establishing of correct study 
habits. 
1. Problem. The assignment or discovery of a 
problem is the first step. The laws of apperception, in- 
terest, and aim are essential parts of this step. How 
shall the immediate interest of the child be secured and 
the problem be made vital to him? Just what experiences 
should the teacher help him recall in order that he may 
have a proper apperceptive basis? To answer these 
questions the teacher must understand the child and must 
be familiar with his daily life. 
A question, a picture, or an object will often prove 
very effective in securing his interest and in providing 
the proper apperceptive basis. If the lesson is about a 
mountain and the child has never seen one, the teacher 
will need to recall his experiences with hills. If this, too, 
is not his experience, she should help him to an under- 
standing of a mountain by using pictures, or sand-table, 
or by calling his attention to the clouds which often look 
like miniature mountains. 
Variety in the choice of the problem will do much 
toward keeping the child’s interest and in making the 
95
-P-A-G-E-96
   
      06 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  problem seem worth while. It should be of such a nature 
that the study of the lesson is necessary before it can be 
finally solved. A problem may be assigned to the entire 
class or different problems may be assigned to different 
groups. 
Following are some suggestions for motives or prob- 
lems for the study of a reading lesson: 
(a) To be able to tell certain things about the lesson. 
(b) To be able to tell the story of the lesson. (c) To 
be able to read the lesson to the pupils of another class 
so that they will enjoy it. (d) To be able to find and 
read a paragraph or sentence which the teacher or a 
classmate may illustrate. (e) To be able to dramatize 
a sentence or a paragraph from the lesson. This sen- 
tence or paragraph must be found and read by the other 
members. (f) To be able to take the part of a char- 
acter in the dramatization of the lesson. (g) To be able 
to find and read the sentence or paragraph which will 
answer a question given by the teacher or a member of 
the class. (h) To be able to read the sentence or para- 
graph which he likes best. (i) To be able to describe 
something in the lesson. (j) To be able to divide the 
lesson into topics. Certain groups are to read the section 
which is covered by a certain topic. 
2. Difficulties. The difficulties of the reading les- 
son should consist of new sight words, new phonetic 
words, difficult sight words previously presented, pho- 
netic words previously presented, and phrases and sen- 
tences the interpretation of which may prove difficult. 
The new sight words and phrases should be presented in 
connection with the context or in sentences which may 
be placed on the board. The difficult sight words should 
be reviewed in an interesting way. In the phonetic work,   
-P-A-G-E-97
  The Study Lesson 97 
  the child should either be taught the sounds necessary to 
make out the words for himself or he should be helped in 
discovering that he already has this knowledge. This 
work will take patience. It would be easier to tell him 
what the word is than to train him to study it out by the 
use of sounds, but patience will pay as he rapidly gains 
habits of independence in overcoming difficulties, 
3. Habits of Study. The child should be trained 
to recall the assigned problem at the beginning of the 
study period and to keep it constantly in mind as he 
studies. He should be made to realize that the study is 
finished only when the problem is solved. He should be 
trained to attack any difficulty which he meets with in his 
study. If it is a difficult word, he should strive to make 
out its pronunciation by the use of his phonetic knowl- 
edge. If this is not possible, he should then try to dis- 
cover its pronunciation from the context. If it is a 
difficult phrase he should try to discover its meaning from 
the context. These also are slow processes but they are 
infinitely worth while inasmuch as they are necessary to 
independence in study.

THE FOX AND THE LITTLE RED HEN 
“A little red hen lived 
in a little house in the woods. 
She had a little bedroom, 
a little parlor, and a little kitchen. 
There was a little cupboard 
in the kitchen. 
“Over the hill a sly fox lived 
in a den with his mother. 
He wished to catch the little red hen 
and eat her. 
But she was a wise little hen. 
She kept her eyes open 
and her door shut. 
“One day the fox got a big bag. 
‘Mother, put the pot on,’ he said. 
‘I will get that red hen to-day 
and have her for dinner.’ 
And he went over the hill 
to the little red hen’s house. 
Just then she came out

and the drill on the new 
sight words, difficult

(3) Interpretation of 
difficult phrase:

are able to take part in the lesson?” 
He will have to study the entire les- 
son. 
Period II. 
“What do you do when you go 
home?” The teacher should insist 
that each child answer in a complete 
statement. “I will write what you 
have said on the board.” She should 
call the child’s attention to the be- 
ginning of the sentence with a capi- 
tal and to the placing of the period 
at the close. 
“Who would like to read this sen- 
tence? Find where it says dinner. 
Find the card with dinner on it.” 
“Did you ever go to the woods on 
a picnic or to gather nuts? When 
did you go? I will write what you 
said on the board.” She places the 
sentence on the board, and has it 
read, then the word woods is pointed 
out and found on the card. 
“What do you call the room in 
which you sleep?” The sentence is 
placed on the board and read by 
some one. The word bedroom is 
pointed out and found on the card. 
A drill lesson is given on these 
words. (See Chapter VI, pages 75 
to 76.) 
At another period a drill lesson is 
given on the difficult sight words. 
“Did you ever hear any one say 
that some one was sly? What did 
he mean? In our new lesson the 
fox is called a sly fox. What does 
that mean? I will write ‘He was a

sly fox.’” She has this sentence read 
and the phrase pointed out. 
The new sound family y is devel- 
oped as in the illustrative lesson on 
the introduction of a sound family, 
Chapter VII, pages 92 to 94. 
The review work in phonics is con- 
ducted as in the illustrative drill les- 
son. (Chapter VI, pages 75 to 76.) 
The teacher then has the children 
turn to the new lesson, and she 
allows them to find the phonetic 
words belonging to the families used 
in the drills. 
In the supervised study of the les- 
son the teacher should insist that the 
children sound out every phonetic 
word which they do not know. For 
example, she asks them before they 
begin to study, “When you find a 
word that you do not know, what are 
you going to do? Yes, see if you 
know the family to which it belongs, 
and if you do, you will sound out 
the word.” 
4 
Application: At the beginning 
of the study period the teacher 
should help the children to recall the 
problem which they are to solve. At 
the close of the period, she should 
again have the problem stated and 
allow each child to decide for him- 
self if he has solved it. When a 
child comes to a difficult word or 
phrase she should encourage him to 
discover its pronunciation’ or mean- 
ing by using his phonetic knowledge 
or from its use in the context.

“There was once a little shepherd boy, named Carl, 
who herded the sheep of a rich man. 
“Carl and his mother lived in a tiny house with a tiny 
garden around it. The house and garden, with a white 
goat, were all they had in the world. 
“A deep river ran near Carl’s home. Not far away 
were the great forests and the high mountains. 
“Carl loved the shining river, the green forests, and 
the high mountains. He loved the singing birds and the 
gay butterflies. But, he loved still more the beautiful 
flowers that grew by the side of the river, in the green 
forest, and on the mountain. 
“Every morning Carl guided his sheep down to the 
river, and herded them there all day. When night came, 
he guided them back to the fold. Then he hurried to his 
home under the fir trees at the foot of the mountain.

There was the wood to cut, the garden to work, and the

and she had to spin all day long and, sometimes, until 
late in the night. 
“Carl loved her too well to let her do the work that he 
could do. And though they were very poor, Carl and his

it look when the sun shone on it?

lesson. She then has the children 
turn to the lesson and allows them 
to find the words belonging to these 
families. When a word is found, it 
is placed on the board and sounded

    CHAPTER IX 
THE RECITATION 
(READING—CONTINUED) 
AIM 
In the reading recitation the aim should be to develop 
the child’s initiative, his power for clear, systematic 
thinking, his power of expression, the ability to gather 
thought from the printed page, the ability to think and 
to talk while standing, and skill in the judging of values. 
The child should be trained to recognize whether or 
not he has sufficiently studied his lesson. He should learn 
that the preparation of the lesson is not a matter of 
reading it over a certain number of times, but that of 
studying until the problem in the assignment has been 
solved. He should be trained to report any unsolved 
difficulty in class, for example, a difficult word, a passage 
whose meaning is obscure, or the proper way to express 
a certain passage. 
The real test of the reading is not how well the child 
is able to read in the schoolroom but the use he makes of 
this ability in practical life. He should be encouraged to 
read his lesson or to tell the story after careful prepara- 
tion to his small brothers, sisters, mother, father, grand- 
parents, or playmates. 
I. SILENT READING 
Aim. The purpose of the silent reading recitation 
is to train the child to gather the thought of the printed 
106
-P-A-G-E-107
The Recitation 107   
page accurately and rapidly. Inasmuch as silent read- 
ing is of such importance the teacher should plan to give 
the child definite training in it. In other words, it should 
be a definite part of his training from the day he enters 
school until he finishes. 
Method. The first lessons will usually take the 
form of action sentences which the child reads silently 
and then acts out. For instance, he reads silently the 
sentence, “Run to a boy,” and then performs the act 
without speaking a word. Later he can read a sentence 
or paragraph silently and then illustrate it by a crude 
drawing, free hand paper cutting, or by clay modeling. 
The sentence, “There was a small cupboard in the 
kitchen,” may be illustrated by drawing a picture of a 
cupboard, by cutting a cupboard from paper, or by 
modeling one from clay. Any one of these may be done 
without oral reading. 
If a question appears in the reading lesson, the child 
may be allowed to read the question silently and then 
answer it. “Can you read?” is read silently and he 
answers, “Yes, I can read.” 
As the child gains power in reading, the entire recita- 
tion period may be given over to a silent reading recita- 
tion in which the teacher asks questions about a sen- 
tence or a paragraph and ‘he reads the sentence or para- 
graph silently and then answers the question in his own 
words. Later he may be trained to ask questions about 
the lesson, the answers to be given by another child. 
A group of children may read certain sections of the 
lesson silently and then give a pantomime of the scene. 
In the story of “The Fox and the Little Red Hen” the 
section which gives the plan of the fox may be acted 
out. The entire lesson may be read silently and then
-P-A-G-E-108

the book laid aside and the story dramatized. The book 
is to be referred to only in event of a dispute. 
Rate in Reading. It has been previously shown that 
the rapid reader is the more intelligent reader; that he 
gains more intensive and more vivid impressions than 
does the slow reader; that he gains these impressions 
more quickly; that he retains them longer. Rapidity in 
the gathering of thought from the printed page does not 
come through oral reading but through persistent, well- 
directed practice in silent reading. 
The teacher should plan definitely how she is to train 
the child to rapidity in silent reading. Inasmuch as this 
rapidity is not possible without rapid word recognition, 
this is the first step in the process. It should begin by 
training the child to recognize words after only an in- 
stant’s exposure. This should be gradually extended to 
groups of words, as “a little boy,” then to short sen- 
tences, as “I see a little boy.” These may be printed on 
strips of tag-board or heavy paper. In this work it is 
best to use only words with which the child is thoroughly 
familiar, since the end is not word recognition, but rapid 
word recognition. 
In the second or third grade each of the children may 
be given a new book containing easy reading. A section 
which is to be read in a certain length of time is desig- 
nated. When the signal is given all are to close their 
books. The aim is to see who can best give the thought 
of what was read. This should be continued until each 
child has had the opportunity to give the thought of a 
section. 
The habit of rapidity in reading may be greatly re- 
tarded if the subject-matter of the regular book is too 
difficult as to words or thought, since the child is more 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  
The Recitation 109   
than likely to form the habit of reading slowly. Any- 
thing which tends to make him a slow reader is to be 
discouraged. 
II. ORAL READING 
Aim. The purpose of oral reading is not to dis- 
cover whether the pupil can recognize the words of the 
lesson, but is to help him to understand and to interpret 
the meaning and the spirit of the selection. A minor 
purpose is to train him to express the thought in a man- 
ner which will be pleasing to his audience. 
Method. The teacher should always be sure that 
the child has had the experience necessary to the under- 
standing of the selection, and that he has the proper stage 
setting; in other words, he must be led to form a vivid 
mental picture of the characters and of the events in the 
story. These vivid mental pictures are a necessary basis 
for good oral reading, inasmuch as expression is a 
natural outcome of a vivid impression. When the child 
has gained the ability to form these pictures through his 
silent reading, the droning of words will disappear and 
his oral reading will be more realistic. 
One of the most effective ways to guide the child in 
the interpretation of a selection is by a well directed 
question which will cause an important point to stand 
out clearly. For example, “Where did the little red hen 
live?” Questions will also be very effective in leading 
him to find the heart or the key sentence of a selection. 
For instance: “Why was such a title selected for this 
story?” 
The child should be trained to read by sections, for 
instance, “Read the part that tells what Forest Rover’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 How to Teach Primary Grades   
mother gave him on his birthday.” At first this will be 
slow work, but if the teacher perseveres she will find 
that he will develop considerable skill. Not only will 
reading conducted in this way help him in the interpre- 
tation of the selection, but it will also develop his power 
for clear thinking. 
As previously stated, dramatization and dialogue read- 
ing help to make the oral reading more realistic to the 
child. Selections in which the conversational element 
predominates should usually be dramatized or read as a 
dialogue. No equipment will be needed, as the child is 
very imaginative and enjoys imagining the stage scenery 
of the story. The stronger readers should be selected for 
the difficult parts, allowing the slower ones to read the 
easier parts. 
In his interest to express the thought gathered through 
silent reading, the child will often omit words and sub- 
stitute others of similar meaning. For example, the use 
of the word strong for stout. This is perfectly natural 
and no attention should be given to it, as the purpose of 
the lesson is not exact word calling, but the interpretation 
and the expression of the thought. To require him always 
to give an exact reproduction of the wordsvof the selec- 
tion will often result in his attention being directed to 
the words, and he will lose sight of the thought behind 
the words. An exception to this rule should be made in 
the case of the child who changes the wording through 
carelessness. 
For this same reason, class criticism is likely to result 
in losing sight of the real purpose of the lesson, and the 
recitation is given over to watching for possible mistakes. 
-In other words, it is not desirable for the child to act as 
a critic since this is likely to spoil the whole spirit and
-P-A-G-E-111
Ty a AN HST Se te ee Wee UM ent Wk ae 1 Ce ae Ce ee eae Pam eg | ate nr pore Way ee 
The Recitation TEP   
purpose of the recitation. The teacher should not inter- 
rupt a child with a criticism while he is reading unless 
the error is a very glaring one. 
When a child is reading orally and comes to a word 
which he does not know, the teacher should pronounce it 
for him instantly, otherwise the thread of thought is lost. 
A note may be made of the word and his attention called 
to it when he has finished. 
If oral reading is to be done in a pleasing manner there 
are certain desirable recitation habits which should be 
formed. 
(1) The child should face the class when he is reading. 
This will provide him with an audience which should 
inspire him to more realistic reading. (2) He should 
stand erect, and hold his book with both hands. The 
book is held by the lower edge. (3) He should be taught 
the proper way for turning the page. When going for- 
ward, turn from the upper right-hand corner, and when 
going backward, turn from the lower left-hand corner. 
(4) A beginning child often has difficulty in keeping the 
place during the oral reading recitation. He may be per- 
mitted to use a small card which he places either above 
or below the part to be read. He should be encouraged to 
discontinue this as quickly as possible. (5) A first-grade 
child should be required. to read a sentence silently before 
he reads it orally. He should then look at the class and 
tell what he read. This should be kept up until he has 
become somewhat skillful in reading. Whenever a 
second- or third-grade child stumbles in his oral reading 
he should be stopped and required to read the part 
silently, then orally. (6) Any lip movement in silent 
reading should be discouraged inasmuch as this results 
in slow reading. (7) The child should not be allowed to  
-P-A-G-E-112
  112 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  form the habit of pointing at words in silent or oral 
reading, as this, too, will tend to result in slow reading. 
LESSON PLANS 
Contents. If the lesson has been properly assigned 
the teacher will have become thoroughly acquainted with 
the subject-matter of the lesson. All that she should have 
to do in planning the recitation should be to look over the 
lesson and decide the form of recitation to which it is 
best adapted, or in what way she can best handle the 
recitation in order that the child may reap the greatest 
benefit from it. 
Teacher’s Motive. In planning for the recitation it 
is essential that the teacher decide just what she wants the 
child to gain from this recitation. Is it best to make it 
a habit-forming lesson, or one that will develop initiative 
and individuality? Shall she plan it in such a way as 
to develop his power for systematic thinking or to develop 
his power of expression? Shall it be a lesson in gather- 
ing thought from the printed page or in developing his 
ability to think and talk while standing? Or shall it be 
a lesson to increase his rate in reading? These motives 
or purposes overlap more or less, and any recitation, 
whatever its direct purpose, will likely forward more ° 
than one of these motives. 
Child’s Motive. In planning for the recitation it is 
also essential for the teacher to decide how she can 
arouse the child’s active interest so that he may get out 
of the recitation just what she desires. Following is a 
list of suggestions for possible motives for the child: 
1. Oral Reading. (a) To be able to read so that 
his teacher and classmates shall form vivid mental pic- 8
-P-A-G-E-113
The Recitation 113 
  tures of the thing read. (b) To read just as he thinks 
the character talked. (c) To learn to read so well. that 
he may read the story to some one. (d) To be able to 
find and read the part which answers a question given 
by the teacher or a classmate. (e) To read certain sec- 
tions, or certain things that happened in the story. (f) 
To read the section illustrated by the teacher. (g) To 
read the section which has just been dramatized. (h) 
To outline the lesson, then name and read a section. 
(i) To be able to name words, phrases, or sentences 
which are exposed for an instant only. 
2. Silent Reading. (a) To be able to dramatize a 
sentence or paragraph. (b) To be able to answer the 
questions of the book. (c) To be able to illustrate cer- 
tain sentences, paragraphs, or sections. (d) To be able 
to give a pantomime of certain sections or to dramatize 
the story. (e) To be able to answer questions asked by 
pupils or teacher. (f) To be able to outline the lesson 
and then give the substance of the thought of each sec- 
tion. (g) To be able to read rapidly and then to give 
the thought of a section of the lesson. 
Class Procedure. Class procedure should include the 
preparation for the new subject-matter, its presentation, 
and often the suggested application. This part of the 
plan is of the utmost importance since on it depends the 
success of the recitation. The teacher must know just 
how she is to handle the subject-matter in order success- 
fully to accomplish her aim. She must have planned 
carefully how to arouse the child to the consciousness of 
a practical reason for doing the thing she desires done. 
Her questions should be very clear, definite, and to the

John, you may read your selection in 
such a way that we may close our 
eyes and imagine we see the boy 
and the sheep. That was good. Do 
you agree with his selection? Mary, 
let us see what kind of picture you 
can make us see.” 
“Find this paragraph.” She draws 
a picture of a river, a sheep, a boy, 
and a house under the trees. “Who 
is ready to read the paragraph? Do 
you agree with the selection? Try 
to make us see the picture, Sam. 
What does the first sentence tell? 
What picture does that make you 
see? Who will read just that sen- 
tence, and make us see the picture?” 
The teacher should allow a number 
of children to try their skill in mak- 
ing others see the picture. 
Each sentence may be handled in 
a similar way. 
“Let us see who can find this para- 
graph first.” She draws a picture of 
a tiny house, a garden, and a white 
goat. The reading of this paragraph 
is treated in the same way as that 
of the first one. 
She then draws a picture of a river, 
trees, mountains, birds, butterflies, 
and flowers. The paragraph is found 
and read, and she then helps the chil- 
dren to develop an appreciation of its 
beauty by such questions as follow: 
“What does shining river mean? 
Why do you suppose Carl loved the 
shining river? Would you like to 
see it? What does he mean by gay
-P-A-G-E-121
  The Recitation 121 
butterflies? Do you ever listen to 
the singing birds and watch the gay 
butterflies? How do you feel when 
your hear the birds singing and see 
the pretty butterflies flitting about? 
What did Carl love best? Why do 
you suppose he loved the flowers 
best?” 
The other paragraphs in the lesson 
should be illustrated and developed 
in a similar way. This is possible in 
all except the last one. This may be 
developed by the’ teacher in the fol- 
lowing manner: “Who can find and 
read the paragraph that tells about 
Carl’s love for his mother, and of 
their happiness?” 
Practically all the suggestions for the motivation of 
the oral reading may be applied to this lesson. Each 
motive would call for a procedure in keeping with that 
motive. 
The questions used in the type lessons on the reading 
of the story of “The Little Red Hen and the Grain of 
Wheat,” and in the original story of the “Excursion” 
(Chapter V, pages 65 to 67), are suggestive of the 
questions which are asked in order to help the child 
develop the meaning of the sentence. It is a pernicious 
habit for the teacher to conduct a reading lesson in such 
a way that the child gains nothing from his oral reading. 
When her sole effort consists in saying “Read the next 
sentence, John,” she is wasting a valuable opportunity, 
and the child is wasting time. By her questions and sug- 
gestions she should lead him to see that every sentence or 
paragraph embodies a thought which he is to interpret 
through his oral reading. .

CHAPTER X 
LANGUAGE 
AIM 
All thought has a tendency to find outward expression. 
It may be through vocal language, written language, 
action, fine arts, industrial arts, or household arts. 
If nature has endowed the child with the necessary 
tendencies for thought and action, the development and 
ultimate use of these will be a matter of training; hence, 
the stimulation of thought and its direction are impor- 
tant features in the educational process. 
In the language work the teacher is primarily interested 
in the expression of thought through vocal and written 
speech, hence the other forms of expression are only 
briefly discussed in this chapter. 
As there can be no expression without impression, the 
problem of the teacher is of a two-fold nature: (1) the 
arvusing and stimulating of thought, and (2) the train- 
ing of the child to correct, clear, fluent, and forceful 
expression of this thought. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
To express thought fluently, clearly, and forcefully 
the child must have a large stock of available words and 
considerable training in the use of these words. 
Thought may be aroused and stimulated and language 
power developed through use of literature, conversations 
123 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  124 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  about child’s daily life, nature study, social life, and games. 
In planning for the work to be accomplished in the 
language course it is essential that each teacher plan her 
own course of study, as this must be based on the needs 
of the particular class in question. She should mix and 
mingle freely with the children in their school life and 
in their home life. She should constantly endeavor to 
lead them to free and spontaneous expression in all their 
work, Only in this way can she really discover the actual 
language needs of the class. She should keep a list of 
the errors heard. She should not attempt to correct all 
these errors at once but the most glaring and grating ones 
should be selected for the first work. 
Some of the incorrect language expressions which are 
common errors with the child will be found in the follow- 
ing list: ‘I have took” for “I have taken”; “I seen” 
for “I have seen”; “I have saw” for “I saw”; “I taken” 
for. letook”.; “set”? for “‘sitt.;. pit’): for “‘get’’; “aint? 
for “am not”; “comin” for “coming”; “come” for 
“came”; “run” for “ran”; “have got” for “have.” 
Course of Study 
The language course of study will contain suggestions 
for the work in literature, siace this is an essential part 
of the language work. 
First Grade. It will include stories reproduced 
and dramatized; poems memorized; thought expressed 
through handwork ; conversational exercises about nature 
observations, picture study, and daily exercises; expres- 
sion games to establish correct habits of expression; use 
of the period, question mark, capital letter in a proper 
name and at the beginning of a sentence; very simple 
letter writing.
-P-A-G-E-125
  Language 125   
Second Grade. Stories reproduced and dramatized; 
poems memorized ; thought expressed through handwork ; 
conversational exercises as in the first grade; expression 
games to correct errors in speech; letter writing; very 
simple class compositions and stories based on nature 
study, literature, picture study, and history or social 
life; abbreviations, as Mr., Mrs., St., and other forms 
used in this grade; use of capitals in days of the week, 
in months, and in the first word of each line of poetry; 
the use of quotation marks and of the comma after a 
word of address. 
Third Grade. Stories reproduced and dramatized; 
poems memorized and recited ; thought expressed through 
handwork; conversational exercises based on nature 
study, picture study, literature, and history or social life; 
composition or story work based on conversational exer- 
cise; letter writing; expression games to establish correct 
habits of speech; punctuation marks needed in written 
work; abbreviations for such terms as the child uses in 
his written work. 
METHOD 
The use of words and expressions is a most important 
part of language power, since it is an almost infallible 
key to one’s cultural attainment. The most inspiring 
thought loses force if it is expressed in incorrect 
language. 
The old method of teaching correct forms of expres- 
sion was to have the rules of grammar memorized. Very 
little attention was given to training the child to usé cor- 
rect forms. The success of this method is measured by 
its result. We have only to listen to the speech of many 
who were trained in English by the use of the rule alone
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 How to Teach Primary Grades   
to realize that there is something woefully lacking. Many 
of these persons can quote glibly every rule in the gram- 
mar and then unconsciously break each of these rules in 
ordinary conversation. 
The way a person expresses thought is a matter of 
habit—a ‘habit which is usually formed long before he is 
able to understand the meaning of a rule. The period of 
easiest habit formation is in early childhood, and hence 
it is very essential that the child form correct language 
habits. He should say things in a certain way not because 
of a rule but because he has formed the habit of saying 
it in that right way. It is with great difficulty that a 
habit is broken, and the older the habit, the harder it is 
to break. Consequently, this phase of the language work 
should receive especial attention in the primary grades. 
That language habits may be successfully established, 
it is necessary that the teacher have a thorough knowl- 
edge of language forms and that she use these forms 
correctly in her own speech since the child is a great 
imitator. The child should first be given to understand 
that there is a right and a wrong way to say things. This 
should be followed by the awakening of the desire to 
use the correct form, for if he is consciously trying to 
use the correct form, there is great gain inasmuch as he 
will form the habit of watching his own speech. The 
teacher should praise him whenever he uses the correct 
form, as this will help to make the desire to use it more 
prominent in his mind. She should use her own judg- 
ment in correcting errors in the child’s speech. Correc- 
tion should never be given in a way that will tend to 
embarrass him or that will attract the attention of the 
other children. When he makes a mistake, if the teacher 
will quietly repeat the correct form he will usually cor-
-P-A-G-E-127
  Language 127 
  rect the mistake and go on without any embarrassment 
and the attention of the other children will not be at- 
tracted. If this cannot be done, it will probably be better 
to make a note of the error and then plan some game or 
exercise in which there will be a frequent repetition of 
the correct form. 
The aim in all language work should be to direct the 
attention toward the correct form, rather than to the 
incorrect form. For this reason, the practice of class 
criticism in primary grades is questionable. A habit of 
expression is formed through frequent repetition of the 
expression. Is it not then a questionable procedure to 
train the child to give attention to the incorrect form? 
Would it not be more effective to train him to note the 
correct expression? 
The uses of literature in teaching the child to use cor- 
rect forms of speech will be fully discussed in the 
succeeding chapter. 
Games. In establishing a correct habit of speech 
the teacher should not be satisfied with calling the child’s 
attention to mistakes, but she should plan for a sys- 
tematic repetition of the correct form. 
A very effective device to use is found in the expres- 
sion games. In these games there should be a frequent 
and interesting repetition of the correct form. The 
exercises or games should be varied from day to day 
and may occupy only a five-minute period. 
Many suggestions for games may be found in educa- 
tional journals and in books of games. The ingenious 
teacher can adapt many of the well known children’s 
games to suit her needs. 
Following are suggestions for expression games and 
exercises :
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 How to Teach Primary Grades   
1. A Penny, a Penny. Aim, to establish the habit 
of saying “J haven’t any.” This is an adaptation of the 
old game of “Thimble.” Two children come forward 
while the others remain in their seats. One child is 
given a penny. He goes from child to child, pretending 
to give the penny to each one. The second child watches 
to see which one receives the penny. When the first 
child has been to each one, he takes ‘his seat, and the 
second child tries to guess who has the penny. He calls 
a child’s name and says, “A penny, a penny.” This ~ 
child answers, “I haven’t any,” or “I have one,” as the 
case may be. When the penny is located another guesser 
is selected, and the child having the penny gives it to some 
one else. 
2. ISaw. To establish the habit of saying “I saw.” 
A number of objects are placed on the table. The chil- 
dren form a line and march around the table. The aim 
is to discover who can see the greatest number of objects. 
After the class is reseated, each child in turn says, “I 
saw ————,” telling what he saw. 
3. I Have Seen. To establish the habit of saying “I 
have seen.” The teacher says, “I wonder how many dif- 
ferent kinds of birds you have seen?” Each child answers 
by saying, “I have seen a robin.”” The game is continued 
until all have told the different kinds of birds they have 
seen. This exercise may be varied by letting each child 
tell about different animals, flowers, trees, or vegetables. 
4. The King’s Gold. Aim, to establish the habit 
of saying, “It was not I,” and “It was he or she.” One 
child goes from the room. The other children hide their 
eyes. The teacher goes through the aisles and touches 
one child. She then gives the signal for the children to 
sit up. The absent child is recalled. He calls a child's 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  Language 129.   
name and says, “Was it you, who stole the king’s gold?” 
This child touches another child and answers, “It was 
not I who stole the king’s gold, it was he (or she).” 
This child rises and says, “It was not I who stole the 
king’s gold, it was he (or she).” The game continues 
until the one touched by the teacher is discovered. This 
child goes from the room and the game is played as 
before. 
Other suggestions for games may be found in either 
of the following books: 
Aldine, Language Games, Newson & Co., New York. 
Leiper, Language in the Elementary Grades, Ginn & 
Co., Chicago. 
Conversational Exercises. Another source for de- 
veloping thought and the power to communicate thought 
is through conversation. Topics in which the child is 
interested should be selected; for instance, games, home 
and daily life, pets, nature study, pictures, or the read- 
ing lesson. By questions and suggestions the child is 
led to talk about these things. This should give an 
opportunity to develop correct and fluent expression, and 
the ability to think and talk while standing. 
The study of pictures representing child life will form 
an excellent basis for conversational exercises, and for 
original stories. The picture should be chosen with care 
and should be a copy of a painting by a good artist. 
The teacher should: select those that tell a story, and 
the child should be trained to see the story in the pic- 
ture. Originality in composing stories should be en- 
couraged. 
Suitable pictures may be purchased from the Perry 
Pictures Co., Malden, Mass. fi 
Other Forms of Expression. Any form by which 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  130 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  thought is communicated has a place in the study of 
language. The child should be encouraged to express the 
thoughts acquired through literature, nature study, or 
social life by some form of handwork. Among the best 
forms of handwork are the sand-table, clay modeling, 
free-hand paper-cutting, drawing, and paper-folding. 
This work should be developed as the outward expres- 
sion of the inner thought. These forms of expression 
will be more fully treated in Chapter XX. 
WRITTEN LANGUAGE 
Problem. In the primary grades, the larger part 
of the time should be given to oral language. The first 
and greatest problem is to train the child to express 
thought in correct, clear, fluent, and forceful oral Eng- 
lish. If this is successfully accomplished the problem of 
written, English will resolve itself into sentence structure, 
the proper use of capital letters, punctuation marks, 
proper arrangement on the page, and correct spelling. 
A common mistake of primary teachers has been the 
neglecting of the oral language and the over-emphasizing  . 
of the written. They have worked on the supposition 
that correct and fluent written expression results in cor- 
rect and fluent oral expression. This has not proved the 
case, as a person can often produce a beautifully writ- 
ten composition or letter, and at the same time make 
many errors in his oral speech. Then, if a child has to 
contend with the expression side of his written work, 
his task is much greater and the time required for its 
successful accomplishment will be much longer. 
Subject-Matter. Very little written language should 
be attempted in the first grade inasmuch as the need 
esti NR 3 ee |
-P-A-G-E-131
Language 1a 
for oral expression far outranks the need for written 
expression. However, a small amount of letter writing 
may be given. This letter writing may take the form 
of a simple invitation, or the body of the letter may con- 
sist of a copied rhyme or of a selection from the reading 
lesson. 
The written work of the second and third grades will 
consist of the copying of simple rhymes, poems, sen- 
tences, compositions, written reproduction of stories, and 
original stories. Much of the time should be given to 
letter writing, inasmuch as the majority of people write 
nothing except letters. If spelling is taught in the mod- 
ern way it will include the writing, from dictation, of 
senterices and paragraphs from stories and of stanzas 
from poems. This is an added opportunity for written 
language work. 
Method. It is a simple task to teach the little child 
correct written form. The endless opportunity for black- 
board work brings in the use of capitals and punctuation 
marks. In this way he may be made sensitive to form: 
The best time to teach the details of written form is 
when the child contributes the original stories which have 
been developed in the conversational exercises. On these 
occasions he gives the natural phrasing which makes 
punctuation a necessity. He asks the question or makes 
the statement and thus he sees the need of the question 
mark and the period. 
If the child is to use correct written English, no in- 
correct form should ever be placed before him either in 
the teacher’s work or in any other which is presented 
‘to him. Though he does not understand the proper use 
of capitals, punctuation marks, or the proper arrange- 
ment of form, all work placed before him should be  
-P-A-G-E-132
| 
132 How to Teach Primary Grades   
absolutely correct as to these points, in order to avoid 
the possibility of an erroneous impression. In all his 
own written work the teacher should require accuracy 
as to arrangement, capitals, and punctuation. The child 
should never be asked to write anything unless he has 
knowledge enough to do it correctly, else the result will 
be the formation of an incorrect habit. 
No error in the child’s written work should ever be 
allowed to pass unnoticed. He should be required to 
correct his own errors, since this will serve to impress 
the correct form as well as to make him more careful. 
Rules. The rules for the heading, the margin, the 
indention of the paragraph, the use of the capital let- 
ters, the proper punctuation, and other points of arrange- 
ment may be effectively taught by the inductive method. 
It is worth considerably more to the child to examine 
his book with the attention directed toward the point 
in question and discover the way to do the thing, than 
to be told how to do it. If the rule is worked out in 
this way it will mean much more to him, since the knowl- 
edge of it is the result of his own effort. He must 
have thought about it before he can form the rule. If 
he should forget this rule, he should go back to the 
source to refresh his memory. 
THE LESSON PLAN 
The language lessons are mainly of two types, the in- 
ductive lesson and the drill lesson. The inductive les- 
son, which may also be a study lesson, is the lesson 
where new rules or definitions are worked out. It con- 
sists of (1) a problem, (2) a study of material which 
will solve the problem, and (3) the summary or solution
-P-A-G-E-133
  Language 133 
of the problem. However the majority of the language 
lessons are drill lessons in which the aim is to establish 
a certain habit of response. These lessons should con- 
form to the principles governing the drill lesson; namely, 
(1) motive, (2) clear idea of the desired response, (3) 
attentive repetition, (4) no exception, (5) review, and 
(6) application. 
1. Motive. As previously stated, the mind accom- 
plishes a task more quickly and with greater ease if it is 
held to the task by a conscious and definite aim or pur- 
pose. 
The observance of this law is especially valuable in 
the language lesson, which is more or less a mechanical 
process. 
First, the teacher must have a general aim for the 
work as a whole, with specific aims for each separate 
lesson or lesson unit. The general aim has already been 
stated as (a) the arousing and stimulating of thought, 
and (b) the training the child to express this thought 
correctly, clearly, fluently, and forcefully. The specific 
aims for the individual lesson should be some one or 
more features of this general aim. 
The child’s motive will vary with the subject matter. 
In the expression game it will be to play the game cor- 
rectly or it may be to see how many opportunities he 
can find to use a certain word or expression. Again he 
may be interested in writing an invitation to his mother, 
or he may want to discover the story of a picture and 
then tell an original story about it. Suffice it to say 
that whatever the problem or motive, it should appeal to 
him as something worth doing. 
2. Clear Idea of Response. Before the important 
step of repetition begins the child should have a clear
-P-A-G-E-134
  134 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  idea of the desired response in order to guard against 
the repetition of an error. If it is an expression game, 
he should hear clearly and understand the expression 
which is the key to the game. If it is a word which he 
is to add to his vocabulary, he should know both the cor- 
rect pronunciation and the correct meaning of the word 
before the repetition of its use begins. If it is a letter, 
he should have a clear and a definite idea of the points 
involved before beginning the repetition. 
3. Attentive Repetition. Before a certain ee of 
Tesponse is permanently established there must be many 
repetitions. The number of repetitions necessary is ma- 
terially reduced if concentrated attention accompanies 
each repetition. Therefore, the teacher should plan for 
the conscious repetition of the response which she is 
endeavoring to establish. The child may play a variety 
of games which involve a certain expression; the ex- 
pression is brought out in a story or in a poem; or a 
story which involves the expression is dramatized. 
The different devices for bringing in the repetition of 
the expression utilize the law of association, which is 
one of the best means of establishing a desired response. 
4. No Exceptions. The repetitions should be so 
planned that no error will be made, otherwise the task 
of establishing the habit will be very much retarded. 
Not only should the teacher try to avoid possibilities of 
error in the language period but she should be con- 
stantly on the alert whenever the child has occasion to 
talk or to write. 
5. Reviews. The teacher should recognize the im- 
portance of the principle of review in establishing lan- 
guage habits, and plan for frequent and systematic re- 
view of each point covered. After the child has gained
-P-A-G-E-135
Language 135   
some skill in playing expression games, more elaborate 
games, in which there is a review of two or more ex- 
pressions, may be utilized. Stories or poems may be 
selected with a view to reviewing language expressions. 
6. Application. The teacher should make many 
opportunities in the various schoolroom activities for 
the application of the habits established in the language 
course. She should praise all attempts to use these 
habits in both home and school activities.

examined she has the children make 
a statement of the kind of letter 
used. “Look in the paper when you 
go home and see if all the names of

has several stories ‘examined until 
the children are convinced that the 
name of the story should be given 
first. “What shall we name our story? 
Where shall we write it?” The prop- 
er position, capitals, and punctuation 
should be developed inductively. The

point covered is reviewed. 
“What shall we tell about the rab- 
bit? I will write on the board the 
things you suggest. What shall we

line is rearranged. The teacher 
should train the child to organize 
this outline properly by suggestions 
and by well-directed questions. She 
should not be arbitrary even if the 
organization is not as logical as de- 
sired, since the aim is to develop and 
train the child’s initiative and power 
of organization. 
“How shall we describe the rabbit? 
How shall we say that?” She con- 
tinues until all the sentences are 
placed on the board. These should 
not be placed on the part of the board 
where the regular composition is to 
be written. 
“Let us read our description. What

sentences are rearranged as in the

discover a rule for the margin and 
one for the indention of the para- 
graph by examining their reading 
books. 
After the first paragraph is placed 
on the board the children copy it. 
Each paragraph is developed in a 
similar way. 
All letter writing and written com- 
position work should be closely 
supervised until the teacher is rea- 
sonably sure that the child will not

of form and of spelling.

CHAPTER XII 
LITERATURE 
AIM 
If the child is to gain in language power, he must have 
a conscious ideal or standard by which to measure his 
progress. One of the best sources for these ideals is 
found in literature. The English is pure, simple, and 
elevating, and its proper use will enrich the child’s vocab- 
ulary, add to his power of expression, and help him 
form correct habits of speech. 
In addition to its value as a source of language ideals, 
a genuine love and an appreciation of good literature will 
enrich life by broadening the mind and the character 
through contact with the noble men and women por- 
trayed. It will develop and broaden the child’s sym- 
pathies for his fellow men, fill his mind with uplifting 
thoughts, develop his imagination, and furnish ideals of 
conduct. Through its use he should learn to love and 
appreciate nature as never before. 
It is said that if a child does not learn to love good 
literature before the age of ten, the chances are that he 
will never acquire this taste. If this is true, it is the 
duty of the teacher of the little child, to bring him into 
daily contact with as much appropriate literature as pos- 
sible, inasmuch as love of good literature is a matter 
of training and not an inborn trait. 
148 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  
Literature 149 
  The primary purpose of literature is to give joy. This 
alone-is a justification for its frequent use in the school- 
room, since the ideal schoolroom is one in which both 
teacher and pupil find much joy. The use of the story 
will also help to bring about a closer relation between 
the teacher and the pupil, as the child is instinctively 
drawn closer to the story teller. Not only does the story 
or poem give joy but it affords opportunity for the en- 
riching and the enlarging of the child’s mental and moral 
life. He can find no higher source for moral ideals 
than in the good old fairy tale or the historical tale. 
Two other important functions of literature are the 
development of the child’s imagination and the mental 
training which the study of literature affords. Even the 
simplest story affords such training, as its incidents are 
logical in arrangement, each growing out of the pre- 
ceeding one and necessitating the following one. These 
stories are found to contain all the elements of good 
literature—they are simple in plot, have a predominating 
action, and every incident leads toward the climax. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
In the rhymes of “Mother Goose” will be found a rich 
storehouse of material for the mental training which 
literature should offer. These rhymes meet every. re- 
quirement for good literature and afford a broad field for 
the development of the child’s imagination. The rhythm 
is irresistible, the incidents are intensely interesting, the 
consequences are just, and the moral tone is of a high 
type. The child who has not known “Mother Goose” 
has been deprived of a source of mental development 
which cannot be supplied in any other way. Not only is 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  
  150 How to Teach Primary Grades   
this true, but a knowledge of Mother Goose is essential 
to a complete understanding of adult literature where. 
frequent allusions will be found to these characters. 
Good English is born of familiarity, therefore, it is 
essential that the child hear as much good English as 
possible. Literature is one of the most essential factors 
in this program since it affords endless opportunity for 
bringing him into daily and almost hourly contact with 
those who have something to say and who say it in the 
purest and simplest English. 
In choosing literature for the development of language 
power, the teacher must keep in mind the twofold pur- 
pose; namely, (1) to arouse and stimulate thought, and 
(2) to establish habits of correctness, forcefulness, and 
fluency in the expression of thought. Any selection 
which does not measure up to this standard should be 
eliminated from the language course of study. 
I. THE STORY 
There is a vast amount of material from which to 
choose the story, and the teacher is often puzzled to 
know just what selection to use. Through a close study 
of those which especially appeal to the child, it has been 
found that the ones which he likes best (1) are full of 
action; (2) contain simple elements used in a realistic 
way; and (3) contain a certain amount of repetition. If 
the teacher will apply this three-fold test, she will seldom 
make a mistake in her choice of stories. 
Among the classes of stories which the child likes will 
be found the fairy story, the myth, the legend, the his- 
torical story, the nature story, the Bible story, and the 
nonsense story.
-P-A-G-E-151
  Literature 151   
1. The Fairy Story. The fairy story has a special 
charm for a young child, and it should be given him as 
his natural right. It stirs and develops his imagination, 
inspires him to right action, and develops this literary 
taste. Familiarity with the fairy story is necessary to 
a full appreciation of the frequent allusions in adult 
literature. 
2. The Nature Story. If the nature story is care- 
fully selected, many truths may be taught in an interest- 
ing form. It will develop a closer sympathy with the 
animal kingdom and a deeper appreciation of the beau- 
ties and wonders of nature. Through the nature story 
the child may be taught that behind nature and in nature 
is the hand of God. 
3. The Historical Story. If the historical story is 
wisely selected, much interesting history will be acquired, 
the pride and love for one’s country awakened, and a 
broader sympathy and love for humanity developed. The 
stories of the love, devotion, and struggles of the early 
pioneers should awaken a desire to emulate their 
example. 
4. The Biblical Story. In the Bible will be found 
another source of literature that may be used in arousing 
thought and establishing language ideals. It is unsur- 
passed in purity of style and in loftiness of content. 
Through the Bible story, the child may be taught the 
all-powerful influence of God in the development of the 
human race. 
As in the fairy story, a knowledge of the Bible story 
is necessary to a full appreciation of adult literature. 
5. The Nonsensical Story. The value of the funny 
story lies in its humor and its power to awaken laughter. 
A hearty laugh will do much to clear up the mental
-P-A-G-E-152
    “152 How to Teach Primary Grades   
atmosphere, and take away the tired, discouraged feel- 
ing which is too often a natural result of the schoolroom 
procedure. When the child seems tired and listless, the 
teacher should try the effect of a funny story, one which 
will give him the opportunity for hearty laughter. 
The following list of stories. meets all the requirements 
for those suitable for language work. Many equally ap- 
propriate may be found in the modern school readers, 
children’s magazines, educational magazines, and in 
books of stories especially prepared for the teacher.

II. POEMS 
It is said that the child has an instinctive love for the 
rhythm of the poem, and that if the adult does not like 
poetry, it is because this instinct was not properly devel- 
oped in childhood. If this is true, the teacher has com- 
mitted a grievous wrong against the child if she does not 
make the reading and reciting of poetry a regular part 
of his school life. The most beautiful and inspiring 
thoughts in all classic literature are in the form of poetry. 
The person who does not read poetry loses much that 
would broaden and elevate life and help to fift him ~bove 
the sordid and trivial. Many people have been saved 
from temptation and from the commonplace by having 
their minds stored with these gems of literature. 
The retentive or permanent memory is at its best im

childhood, and a thing thoroughly memorized in this 
period is never forgotten. Advantage should be taken of 
this opportunity by filling the child’s mind with the 
noblest and best which literature affords. 
Aside from the moral and intellectual benefits of poetry, 
there is an excellent opportunity for developing language 
power. If the poetry is properly used it will arouse and 
stimulate the child’s thought, increase his vocabulary, add 
to his phraseology, and help him in forming the correct 
habits of speech. 
Great care should be exercised in the selection of the 
poem. It should be simple as to content, easily inter- 
preted, made up of familiar elements, and should be un- 
mistakable as to rhythm. The English should be pure 
and the style simple. If a poem is adapted to a certain 
season, it will add interest and meaning to teach it in 
the appropriate season. . 
There is an abundance of appropriate poetry for the 
child of every age. Much poetry that is appropriate to 
the grade and to the season will be found in the modern 
readers, children’s magazines, educational journals, the 
Bible, and in books of poetry for children. The follow- 
ing list of poems is suggestive:

METHOD 
Literature should be presented and developed in such 
a way as to arouse the child’s appreciation and to stimu- 
late his thought. The discussion of the selection should 
lead him first of all to form a clear and vivid mental 
picture of the scenes portrayed. This should be followed 
by questions which will lead him to analyze, compare, and 
offer opinions on the characters or the events. In other 
words, he should be made to think. Such questions as 
the following may be asked: ‘‘Why do you like this story 
or poem? Which character or part do you like best? 
Why? Do you think this a good title for the story or 
poem? What would you like to call it? Let us see how 
many parts there are to our story or poem.” 
If good English is the result of familiarity, the child 
should have every opportunity possible to hear and repro- 
duce good English. One of the most effective ways to 
enrich his vocabulary, to help him in establishing correct 
habits of speech, and in developing a beautiful, forceful, 
and fluent power of expression is through the reproduc- 
tion of stories and the reciting of poems. 
He should be made conscious of the new word, the 
beautiful expression, or the correct expression which the 
teacher is seeking to add to his language power. He 
should be encouraged to use these in his daily speech. 
Much may be done by praising the child who makes this
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 How to Teach Primary Grades   
effort. Many ludicrous mistakes will be made in these 
early attempts, but if the teacher perseveres, the child 
will gradually form the habit of expressing his thought 
in fluent and beautiful English. 
The teacher’s attitude toward literature is of great 
importance since it is not possible to teach literary appre- 
ciation if she does not appreciate. She should never 
attempt to teach a selection which she does not like. It 
is possible for the teacher to learn to appreciate a selec- 
tion if she will make a close-study of it, trying to discover 
the author’s purpose and his attitude when he wrote it. 
She should study until she understands its style and the 
thoughts which it portrays, and until she has a vivid men- 
tal image of the situation depicted. 
I. THE STORY 
The story which is told is much more interesting and 
effective than the story which is read. The relation 
between the narrator and the audience is much closer, 
since she is able to look into the faces of her auditors and 
adapt the story to their changing moods. Then, if she 
has made the story her own, she can make it much more 
vivid and forceful by a freer use of eyes, voice, and 
bodily gestures than is possible to do when hampered by 
the words of a book. In other words, the telling is much 
more natural and spontaneous than the reading. 
Story-telling is not always a gift, but it is an art which 
may be acquired through careful study and practice. The 
first step for the teacher in learning to tell a story is to 
read and study it until she feels the emotion of it and has 
a genuine appreciation of it. Second, she must know her 
story thoroughly. She should think of it and picture the 
events until it seems to have been a personal experience. 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
Literature 159   
The student has only to recall her joy in listening to the 
story which begins, “When I was a little girl,” to realize 
the force of a story that is a personal experience. It has 
a charm and fascination that no other tale has, which is 
due in part to the fact that it is imaged in the narrator’s 
mind as an actual, vivid picture, and as she tells it she is 
again participating in the event which enables her to 
paint a realistic word-picture. If the teacher is to tell a 
story well, it must partake of the elements of a personal 
experience. However, the story should not be memorized, 
except where a certain phrasing is especially beautiful, 
or where it seems best to preserve a certain phraseology 
of conversation, as in the story of the “Three Bears.” 
In general the language should be the teacher’s own. 
When telling a story the teacher should stand where 
she can look into the face of each child. This will allow 
her to adapt her tone and gesture to the changing expres- 
sions of the listeners. 
The story should be told simply, directly, dramatically, 
joyfully, and enthusiastically. When the audience is 
made up of young children, it should be told slowly 
and impressively. The events should not be told hur- 
riedly, but the child’s imagination should be given op- 
portunity to leap forward and supply what is about to 
happen. His mind does not go quickly from one thing 
to another, and if the story is told rapidly half the joy 
of listening is lost, for not only does he not get a clear 
picture of the event but his imagination is not given 
proper scope for activity. 
When telling a story it should not be interrupted to 
correct a disorderly child. If he is not listening he 
should be made to listen by the force of the story. It 
should be made so dramatic and interesting that he will 
   
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 How to Teach Primary Grades 
listen in spite of himself. - There should be an exception 
to this rule in the event that a child is making it im- 
possible for others to listen. As a rule, an effective 
punishment will be to take from him the privilege of 
listening to the story. 
A story should not be spoiled by over analysis, but 
only enough discussion to help the child see the beauty 
and to enter into the feeling of it. A personal appli- 
cation of the moral of a story should never be made 
since this will often spoil the enjoyment of it. A well 
directed question will help him unconsciously to take 
the lesson to himself. By questions and suggestions he 
should be trained to compare the characters in the sto- 
ries and decide whether the events are justified or not. 
He should then be left to draw his own conclusions. 
It is good training to read a story to the child and then 
allow him to supply a title, giving reasons for his 
choice. 
Reproduction. As a basis for the development of 
language power, not only should the child listen to sto- 
ries but he should be trained to reproduce them. He 
should not be asked to reproduce a story until he is per- 
fectly familiar with it, inasmuch as this is one of the 
essentials for good story-telling. 
Unless the story is very short, several children may 
take part in the reproduction. For instance, ““Mary may 
tell us about The Home of the Three Bears. Sam may 
tell us about The Visit of Goldilocks.” This method of 
telling is a training in systematic thinking and organiza- 
tion. 
The child should be allowed to tell the story in his 
own words provided he uses a correct expression. Any 
effort to use the beautiful phrases of the story should 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
Literature 161   
be praised not only in the reproduction but in ordinary 
conversation. 
There should be frequent reproduction of old stories. 
It is suggested that each child be allowed to have cer- 
tain stories as his personal property, the one being 
selected which he can best reproduce. 
Dramatization. Where a story is full of action the 
child will get considerable pleasure and profit through 
its dramatization. Not only will it make the story more 
real to him but it will develop his language power by 
the expression of his thought in action and word. It 
will help to form the correct habit of speech as he 
must use the correct phrasing in the conversational 
parts. For instance, ““Who has been lying on my bed?” 
Dramatization is a basis also for realistic reading. 
Through it the child enters into the feelings of the 
characters more freely than. is possible in any ordinary 
reading recitation. Before the dramatization he must 
be perfectly familiar with the events in the story, as he 
cannot successfully reproduce that with which he is not 
familiar. 
If properly conducted, dramatization develops the 
child’s initiative and judgment, since he must improvise 
stage scenery out of the ordinary schoolroom equipment. 
Then he must help decide on the children best suited to 
the different parts, where each shall stand, and the other 
things that go to make up a play. 
As the purpose of dramatization is the benefit to the 
child, and not to give a finished product, it should be 
conducted in such a way that all the children will have 
a part at some time and in some story. As in the re- 
production, old stories should be dramatized often and 
each child allowed to claim certain parts as his own. 
 
-P-A-G-E-162

162 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  Developing a Story. Another excellent plan for the 
use of the story to stimulate and develop thought is 
given in “The Question as a Factor in Teaching” by 
Hall. A story which is interesting, natural, reasonable, 
and logical is selected. The teacher begins the story and 
| then pauses at a certain point and by thought-compelling 
questions stimulates the child’s mind to activity by al- 
lowing him to give his ideas as to what happens next. 
II. POEMS 
It is not enough to read and recite poems to the 
child, but if he is to reap the greatest benefit many of 
the poems must be thoroughly discussed and then com- 
mitted to memory. One or two poems should be mem- 
orized each month, with frequent review of those al- 
ready memorized. 
Psychology teaches that the ability to recall depends, 
primarily, upon three factors, (1) native power of re- 
tention, (2) the number of associations, and (3) the 
systematic organization of these associations. The first 
factor is one over which the teacher has no control, 
consequently it will be eliminated from this discussion. 
Nevertheless, it is a factor which she must take into 
consideration in dealing with individual cases. 
Memory work is based upon a clear understanding 
of the thing to be memorized, followed by a systematic 
association of ideas gained through careful thinking. 
This clear understanding should come through hearing 
the poem read a number of times by the teacher, the 
attention being carefully directed toward some special 
point before each reading. The poem is then analyzed 
into its main thought groups without reference to lines, 
   
-P-A-G-E-163
  
Literature 163 
or stanzas, and these are discussed as to their meaning 
and their relation one to the other. The main thought 
of the poem is then stated, if possible, in the words of 
the writer. This may be followed by a further study 
of the thought groups ending in a statement of these 
thoughts in the words of the writer. The relation of 
these minor thoughts to each other and to the whole 
thought should be constantly brought out. 
If memorizing were carried out in this way it would 
cease to be drudgery, since the poem is usually .mem- 
orized through this careful association of ideas. 
Experiment has also revealed that the “whole method” 
of memorizing is by far the most economical. With 
the small child, it would seem that the combination of 
the whole and the part method would prove the most 
satisfactory. 
Library. When the child has been taught to love 
good literature, the teacher’s task is only partly finished. 
She should encourage him to read, and to read only the 
best. If he is to have access to this type of reading, 
it will often be necessary to have a well-selected library 
in the school. Too often the home from which the 
child comes is barren of any reading matter. When the 
reading habit has been established provision should be 
made by which the child may secure proper reading 
matter. 
Original Work. When the teacher has successfully 
used literature in the development of the language 
power, she may, by skillful handling, train the child to 
write original péems and stories. This should first take 
the form of a class exercise, and later the pupils should 
work individually.
-P-A-G-E-164
CHAPTER XIII 
LITERATURE (Continued) 
LESSON PLANS 
The recitation in literature usually begins with the 
appreciation lesson, develops into the study lesson, then 
into the habit forming or drill lesson, and later into the 
review lesson. 
The appreciation lesson really forms one step in drill 
lesson, that is, the giving of a clear understanding of 
the response, and will not be discussed as a separate 
type. The study and the drill lesson will consist of (1) 
the motive, (2) a clear idea of the desired response, 
(3) attentive repetition, (4) no exception, (5) reviews, 
and (6) application. 
1. Teacher’s Motive. The teacher’s:general motive 
in the teaching of literature is to arouse and stimulate 
thought, to develop an efficient language power, and to 
establish the habit of reading the best literature. The 
subject-matter for any lesson should be carefully se- 
lected and closely studied by the teacher with this gen- 
eral motive in mind. After this study she should care- 
fully scrutinize it with the following questions in mind: 
“Why am I giving this special subject-matter? Is it 
to arouse and stimulate thought; develop the power for 
clear, systematic thinking ; to train in the’ability to think 
and to talk while standing; to develop literary appre- 
ciation; to establish correct habits of expression; or to 
164
-P-A-G-E-165
Literature 165   
  train in the use of clear, fluent, and forceful English? 
Just what do I expect the child to gain through the use 
of this subject-matter?” More than one of these aims 
may enter into any lesson, but the teacher should have a 
clear-cut conception of what she expects the child to 
gain before beginning to plan the class procedure. 
It is through the class procedure that the child’s inter- 
est is secured, that he is made conscious of a motive, and 
that the teacher accomplishes her aim. This part of the 
plan will require very careful preparation. She must 
consider how she is to interest the child, how to lead him 
to want to accomplish the task in hand, what question she 
shall ask, what suggestions she shall make, how she shall 
help the memory or habit-forming process by as many 
associations as possible, and how she shall hold his atten- 
tion and interest while the necessary repetition is going 
on. 
2. Child’s Motive. If the interest and attention 
of the child are to be of the best type, he must have a 
motive for doing the work. In other words, ‘he must 
enjoy it, see the use of it, or feel that he is getting some- 
thing out of it. If it is a poem which he is to memorize 
he should feel that he is learning it to recite at some 
definite time; or if it is a story he should learn to repro- 
duce it for some special occasion. 
3. A Clear Idea of the Response. This clear idea 
is gained through the reading of the poem or story by the 
teacher and through questions. 
4, Attentive Repetition. The second step, or ac- 
quiring the clear idea of the response, offers opportunity 
for attentive repetition. If this is not sufficient the 
teacher should use devices and variation in the necessary 
repetition to insure the full attention. 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
    166 How to Teach Prithary Grades 
  5. No Exception. If the child is to form the habit 
of repeating the words of the poem correctly or of using 
correct expressions in the reproduction of a story, each 
repetition should be exact. The teacher should so plan 
that no error is likely to occur. 
6. Review. If a poem or story is to become a 
permanent part of the child’s mental equipment, the 
teacher should at first review it frequently, then gradu- 
ally lengthen the time which elapses between the reviews. 
7. Application. In so far as possible, the child 
should be given opportunity to make use of the stories 
and poems acquired through the language work. He may 
go to another room and recite the poem or tell the story. 
or the parents and friends may be invited to school and 
the child allowed to recite a poem or tell a story. He 
should be encouraged to tell the story to his brothers, 
sisters, father, mother, and other relatives and friends. 
After all, it is not so much a question of how much the 
child learns as what use he makes of what he has learned. 
ILLUSTRATIVE LESSONS 
These lessons are planned as units and in some cases 
no indication is made as to where the lessons will divide, 
inasmuch as this is a matter which should be governed 
by the amount of time given to a lesson period and to the 
ability of the class. The connection links between the 
lessons should be supplied by a brief review of the pre- 
vious day’s work. ; 
1. Topic: Story of “The Three Bears.” Primarily 
a first-grade story. However, the same general plan may 
be followed in a second or third grade. 
II. Teacher's Motive: (1) To create a love for good
-P-A-G-E-167
  
Literature 167   
literature. (2) To develop the child’s initiative and his 
power for expression. (3) To increase his language 
power: (a) by arousing and stimulating thought, (b) 
by adding huge, wee, and frightened to his vocabulary, 
(c) by establishing the correct use of came, sat, lying, 
and the habit of adding the final g in tasting, walking, 
sitting, and lying. (4) To teach him proper organization 
in thinking. (5) To teach him to think and to talk while 
standing. 
III. Child’s Motive: (1) To enjoy the story. (2) To 
make pictorial drawings of parts of the story. (3) To 
represent parts of the story in clay. (4) To answer the 
teacher’s questions correctly. (5) To gain practice in 
the telling of the story so that he may tell it to his mother. 
(6) To tell certain parts of the story in such a way that 
his classmates will imagine they see the different char- 
acters as he talks. (7) To dramatize the story. 
IV. Subject-matter and Procedure: 
Once upon a time there were three bears. One was a 
great huge bear. One was a middle-sized bear.. The 
other was a wee baby bear. 
These three bears lived in a house in the woods. The 
great huge bear had a great huge bowl to eat out of, a 
great huge chair to sit in, and a great huge bed to sleep 
in. The middle-sized bear had a middle-sized bowl to 
eat out of, a middle-sized chair to sit in, and a middle- 
sized bed to sleep in. The wee baby bear had a wee 
bowl, a wee chair, and a wee bed. 
One day when the bears started to eat their soup, they 
found it too hot. So they decided to go walking while 
it cooled. While they. were gone a little girl named 
Goldilocks came by. She had never seen this house be- 
fore, and she wanted very much to know who lived here.
-P-A-G-E-168
    
‘168 How to Teach Primary Grades   
She went to the door and knocked and when no one came 
she decided to go in. She saw the three bowls of soup 
and as she was very hungry she tasted the soup in the 
great huge bowl, but it was too hot. She tasted the soup 
in the middle-sized bowl, but this was too cold. Then 
she tasted the soup in the wee bowl and as this was just 
right she ate it all up. 
Then she saw the three chairs and decided to rest a 
while. She sat down in the great huge chair but it was 
too high. She sat down in the middle-sized chair, but it 
was too hard. Then she sat down in the wee chair and 
it was just right, but she sat there so long she broke it. 
Then Goldilocks went upstairs where she saw the 
three beds. As she was sleepy she decided to lie down 
and take a nap. She lay down on the great huge bed, 
but it was too high at the head. She lay down on the 
middle-sized bed but it was too high at the foot. Then 
she lay down on the wee bed and it was just right. Be- 
fore Goldilocks knew what had happened, she was sound 
asleep. 
About this time the three bears came home. When 
they started to eat their soup the great huge bear said in 
a great huge voice, “Some one has been tasting my 
soup.” The middle-sized bear said in a middle-sized 
voice, “Some one has been tasting my soup.” The wee 
bear said in a wee voice, “Some one has been tasting my 
soup and it is all gone.” 
Then they looked at their chairs and the great huge 
bear said in a great huge voice, “Some one has been sit- 
ting in my chair.” The middle-sized bear said in a mid- 
dle-sized voice, “Some one has been sitting in my chair.” 
The wee bear said in a wee voice, “Some one has been 
sitting in my chair and it is broken.”
-P-A-G-E-169
Literature 169   
The three bears ran upstairs to look at their beds. The 
great huge bear said in a great huge voice, “Some one 
has been lying on my bed.” The middle-sized bear said 
in a middle-sized voice, ‘““Some one has been lying on 
my bed.” The wee bear said in a wee voice, “Some one 
has been lying on my bed and here she is fast asleep.” 
Just then Goldilocks opened her eyes. She was so 
frightened when she saw the three bears that she ran 
down the stairs and out of the house. She did not stop 
running until she reached home and she never, never 
‘bothered the three bears again.

came to draw the pictures. The teacher 
should accept even the most crude 
drawing. “What does it mean by 
the great huge bear? What size 
should we make him?” The sizes of 
other bears, the bowls, chairs, and 
beds are developed in the same way. 
“Suppose you draw the pictures for 
your mother or your little brothers 
and sisters when you go home.” 
Third Day 
“How did we tell the story of the 
‘Three Bears’ yesterday? Did you 
draw any pictures for your mother, 
brothers, or sisters? How would you 
like to tell it in another way? Let 
us tell it with clay. Let me tell it 
again and then be ready to tell the 
different things we can mold.” The 
teacher tells the story and proceeds 
to list of articles and the molding 
of the objects as on the previous day. 
“What can you tell your mother 
about the story tonight?” 
Fourth to Seventh Days 
“What did you tell your mother 
about the ‘Three Bears?? Who came 
by the ‘Three Bears’’ house?” She 
allows two or three children to re- 
peat the sentence “Goldilocks came 
by the house of the ‘Three Bears’.” - 
“Who came by your house yester- 
day? Who came to school with 
you?” She continues the questions 
until each child has used came in a

“What did the great huge bear say 
when he found some one had been

a child to suggest the parts he likes best. His attention

CHAPTER XIV 
ARITHMETIC 
AIM 
The first question which presents itself is the “why” 
or the function of arithmetic. This is a very important 
issue, as the “‘what” and “how” are purified and modified 
by the use made of the arithmetical knowledge. 
The origin of arithmetic dates back to the early ages 
when it sprang from the utilitarian need of a means of 
dealing with the quantitative side of life. In the differ- 
ent periods which have elapsed since its origin, the rea- 
sons for teaching arithmetic have varied. The utilita- 
rian reason has always been an important one, and in 
addition several other reasons have been promulgated. 
The most prominent of these is the cultural reason. The 
advocates of:this reason claimed that the study of arith- 
metic developed and strengthened the mental powers by 
training the pupil to reason, by sharpening the wits, and 
by training to habits of accuracy. In addition to these, 
it was claimed that it paved the way for the sciences. 
These claims were based on the old psychological as- 
sumption that the brain was made up of certain faculties, 
as the faculty of reasoning. It was thought that training 
the pupil to reason in any one field would enable him to 
reason in any field. Modern psychology teaches that 
this is not altogether true, as training in one field carries 
over into another only in so far as these fields are similar.

Arithmetic 179 
  Though the preset opinion as to the cultural value is 
not so extensive in its scope as the earlier opinion, it is 
still the opinion of many leading educators that there is 
a cultural value which is a necessary part of a broad 
education. However, the primary teacher is not inter- 
ested, primarily, in this discussion, as the function of 
primary arithmetic is purely utilitarian. That is, it is 
to enable the child to do the things which he wants to do 
in his daily life from a quantitative standpoint. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
As the primary purpose of arithmetic is to help the 
child solve the common problems of his daily life, all the 
first work should be closely related to his life; for in- 
stance, counting, measuring, weighing, comparing, gar- 
dening, and games. Practically all primary arithmetic 
could be worked out through these activities and thus be- 
come a live and interesting subject to the child. If it 
were worked out in this way it would be one for which 
he would feel the need, and one which he would desire 
to learn. 
The play element has the strongest appeal to the child 
and should always stand in the background as giving 
meaning to the work in hand. 
The needs of the child will necessitate the ability to” 
write and read numbers, a good working knowledge of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, simple division, the 
common measures such as the pint, the quart, the gallon, 
the inch, the foot, the yard, the pound, and the Roman 
numbers from I-XII. This good working knowledge 
should mean accuracy, reasonable speed, and the ability 
to apply this knowledge to the mathematical problems of 
daily life.

180 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  Course of Study 
There is a difference of opinion as to the proper 
time for the introduction of arithmetic as a subject. 
Some would place it in the first year; others in the 
second or third year. Those who want it in the first 
year, claim that the child is as ready and as eager to 
learn number facts as he is to learn to read. Those 
who would defer the number work until later argue that 
though the child may be anxious to learn number facts, 
it will be of much more profit to him to wait longer as 
he will be better developed, and that this time would be 
much better spent in adding to his language power. 
All are agreed that he should be given that knowledge 
of numbers which will give him control over the quan- 
titative side of his social and industrial life. A study 
of the child’s activities should reveal what this will be. 
A course of study planned as a compromise between 
these two views should consist of the following work: 
First Grade. Counting, reading, and writing of num- 
bers from 1-100 by 1’s, by 10’s, and by 5’s; simple meas- 
uring and comparing, incidental arithmetic; games in- 
volving some of the simple addition facts. 
Second Grade. Incidental arithmetic; games, reading 
and writing numbers to 1000; the numerical scale of 
tens, ones, hundreds; the forty-five addition facts; col- 
umn addition; subtraction based on the forty-five addi- 
tion facts; measuring, weighing, comparing; changing 
of money; telling time; simple fractions as 4%, 4%, ¥%, 
multiplying and dividing as it naturally develops in the 
addition tables. 
Third Grade. Incidental arithmetic; games; reading 
and writing of numbers to 10,000; review of addition
-P-A-G-E-181
Arithmetic 181   
and subtraction; carrying in addition, borrowing in sub- 
traction; multiplication tables; carrying in multiplica- 
tion; measuring, weighing, comparing; changing of 
money; simple division in connection with the multi- 
plication tables; simple fractions in connection with the 
construction work and the multiplication tables. 
METHOD 
Practically every school activity offers opportunity for 
development of the number instinct. All such opportu- 
nities should be noted and utilized in order to satisfy the 
number need. Some of these opportunities are suggested 
as follows: 
1. Find the number of children present; the number 
absent ; find how many rows of seats ; how many children 
in each row. 
2. Tell the number of the page of the reading lesson ; 
write the number of the page on the board; how many 
cards each child received in the word game; find how 
many times a new word occurs in the reading lesson; 
in what lines this word is found; the number of scissors 
needed for each row; the parts of a folded paper used 
in the construction work, for example, the half, the 
fourth; the number of squares into which the paper is 
folded; the number of squares “cut away. 
3. In nature study there is endless opportunity for 
the number element as the number of different kinds of 
wild flowers found on the way to school, the different 
kinds of trees. 
4. Make a weather calendar using dates. 
These are only a few suggestions as to the possibilities 
of utilizing the number element in an incidental way. 
Not only will these needs furnish an adequate motive 
   
-P-A-G-E-182
182 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  for the number work, but the result will be the develop- 
ment of the number instinct in a natural way. 
Counting. Counting is the earliest number impulse 
and forms the basis of practically all primary arithmetic. 
The first counting should be that of objects. The game 
element may be utilized to an advantage in these early 
lessons ; for instance, the teacher takes a handful of corn 
and allows each child to guess how many grains she has. 
The guesses are written on the board, and then the grains 
are counted. Another plan is to scatter the grains of 
corn on the table and see who can pick up the greatest 
number. 
Many and varied are the forms which the concrete 
counting may take; for instance, the number of children 
in the class each day, the number of children in the 
school, the number of books in the class, the number 
of sheets of paper and of scissors to be used in the 
handwork, the number of words learned or the number 
of children needed to dramatize a story. These are only 
a few suggestions of the natural opportunities for con- 
crete counting which are found in every schoolroom. 
In teaching the child to count to 100, time may be 
saved if he is first taught to count to 10, then to 20, fol- 
lowed by counting to 100 by 10’s; for instance, 10, 20, 
30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. If these steps are thor- 
oughly taught it will be a simple matter to complete the 
series of 1 to 100 by ones. 
After the child has learned to count to 100, the next 
problem is that of reading the number symbols. This 
work may be made very interesting by associating it with 
games and devices. It will simplify matters first to 
teach thoroughly the reading of the symbols from 0-9. 
A device which may be used in teaching the reading
-P-A-G-E-183
Arithmetic 183 
of these number facts is as follows: the figures are writ- 
ten on cards using large type. These cards are given to 
the class. A child comes forward and reads the first row 
from the chart and then places the pointer on 1 and 
says, “I want Mary to bring me 1.” This card is pinned 
up and he then calls for 2. He continues until he has 
made the entire first row. 
After the child has had some experience in reading 
from 0-9 in the regular order, he is trained to the in- 
stantaneous recognition of these figures. When this step 
is thoroughly learned, he should be taught to read the 
numbezs by 10’s beginning with naught, as 0, 10, 20, 30, 
40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. If these two things are thor- 
oughly taught, the remainder of the series will fall into 
an easily acquired form. In other words if he knows 
the figures from 0-9, he very quickly learns any number 
symbol within the decimal series. 
The third problem is to teach the writing of the num- 
bers from 0-100. This should be done in a similar way, 
that is, the child is first taught to write the symbols 
from 0-9, second by 10’s, third, the entire series. 
Counting, reading, and writing by 1’s and 10’s may 
be extended to similar work with 5’s, 2’s, 3’s, 4’s, etc., 
working both forward and backward. These exercises 
are the foundation of good work in addition and multi- 
plication and should be drilled on until all sums of this 
kind can be given accurately and rapidly. 
The counting, reading, and writing of numbers should 
be gradually extended beyond 100 as the child advances. 
The numbers beyond 100 may be taught in a very 
brief time by following this same plan. 
Addition. Since addition is based on counting, nat- 
urally it is the next step in the arithmetic process. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  
    184 How to Teach Primary Grades   
Interesting objects should be used in natural ways in 
developing the addition facts; for instance, the teacher 
uses blocks of wood, cardboard, or paper and calls them 
railroad cars. She has each child to form a train of 3 
cars loaded with horses, then has him couple on 3 cars 
loaded with cows. The question is to discover how 
many cars he has in the entire train. This little device 
will prove more interesting to him than to find out how 
many 3 blocks and 3 blocks are. The objects should be 
changed frequently if he is to gain the trie number 
concept. 
Many teachers object to allowing the child to use his 
fingers as they feel that it is a habit which will be hard 
to break. The fault is not in allowing him to use these 
natural counters, but in not training him to rapid oral 
work. When a fact can be given automatically there is 
no desire to use the fingers. The objects are to be dis- 
carded only when the child has comprehended the fact 
that a figure is the symbol of an idea. However, a too 
long-continued use of objects is harmful as it retards 
speed. 
The forty-five addition facts from 1-20 should be 
taught with the utmost care since all the other additional 
facts are based on these. These combinations are as 
follows: : 
lel Vl Ad tl 2 3333333444444 
1234567892 456789456789 
§55556666777889 
567896789789899 
an Nr oN on’ Www 
These combinations should be developed and given 
meaning by the use of natural and interesting objects.
-P-A-G-E-185
Arithmetic 185 
The work should then develop into abstract work. Only 
as the child can automatically give the sum of any num- 
ber symbols has he mastered the quantitative side of life 
as it applies to addition. These facts should be drilled on 
until they are thoroughly mastered. 
Inasmuch as the child is familiar with reading and writ- 
ing numbers to 100 before he begins this work, after he 
learns 3 and 2 are 5, he can readily see that 3 and 22 are 
25; 3 and 32 are 35, etc., to 3 and 92; in other words he 
should be led to see that 3 added to any number ending 
in 2 will give the next number ending in 5. This can be 
taught in all the combinations and is a direct preparation 
for column addition. 
Single column addition should begin as soon as the 
child has mastered enough combinations to justify its use; 
for instance, after he has sce 2 3 5 he could add a 
C24 
column made of 2, 1, 2 and 1. Before giving him a col- 
umn the teacher should be sure he has had all the neces- 
sary combinations to enable him to add the column. 
He should not be allowed to form the habit of counting 
his fingers or marks in column addition, as this retards 
‘speed. For this same reason it is better to avoid giving 
written work to be done at the seat, unless the teacher 
feels sure the facts are automatic. 
Before teaching “carrying” in addition it will be wise 
to develop the scale of ones, tens, hundreds, etc. Without 
this knowledge it will not be possible to teach the child 
the reason for the so-called “carrying” process. A reason 
should always be given where it is possible, as the thor- 
ough mastery of a subject is more quickly accomplished 
if it has its basis in understanding. 
The following outline is given by way of suggestion for

  developing the numerical scale of ones, tens, hundreds, 
ELC. 
Material: toothpicks, shoe-pegs, or kindergarten sticks, 
and rubber bands or string. 
I. Counting to 100 by 10’s is reviewed. 
II. Toothpicks and rubber bands are given to each 
child. “Count out 10 picks for me and bind with a rub- 
ber. Make me 10 bundles of 10 each. Show me 1 ten. 
Write 10 on the board. Show me 2 tens. How many 
is that? Write 20 for me. Show me 3 tens. How 
many is that? Write 30.” The teacher should con- 
tinue in like manner until each child has comprehended 
the fact that the numbers 10, 20, 30, etc., are really 1 
ten, 2 tens, 3 tens, etc. 
III. The teacher writes 60 on the board and asks, 
“How many is this? Read it by tens.” She then writes 
» 70, 50, 80, 40, and has each read by tens. 
IV. “Write 2 tens. How many is this? Write 4 
tens. How many is this?” She continues until each 
child thoroughly understands the principle involved. 
“How many figures do we use in writing the tens? In 
counting to see what a number is we count from right 
to left. See which place is occupied by the figure that 
tells how many tens there are. Let us see if this is true 
every time.” She has each child to write 2 tens, 7 tens, 
9 tens, etc. In this way she leads him to discover that 
the tens place is always the second place from the right. 
V. “Show me 1 ten and 2 ones. How many is that? 
Write it on the board. Show me 3 tens and 4 ones. 
How many is that? Write it on the board.” She con- 
tinues until each child has a clear understanding of the 
principle. 
“Show me 35 in tens and ones. Read it by tens and 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
Arithmetic 187   
ones.” She continues until each child understands the 
principle. “Which is the tens place? Let us see which 
is the ones place. Write 46. Read it by tens and ones. 
Which is the figure that tells the number of ones? Which 
place is that if you count from the right?” She contin- 
ues until each child is able to form the rule that the ones 
occupy the first place from the right. “Read these num- 
bers by tens and ones.” She places several numbers on 
the board and has them read. 
The reason for carrying in addition can be presented 
as follows: “What is this number (28)? Read it by 
tens and ones. Place that many toothpicks on your desk. 
What will it be? Yes, 2 tens and 8 ones. What is this 
number (44)? Read by tens and ones. Place that many 
more tooth picks on your desk. Let us add them together. 
Add the ones first. How many? When you have enough 
ones to make a ten you must bind them into a ten. What 
will 12 ones make? Where shall I place the 2 ones? Yes, 
on the ones place. What shall we do with the ten? Yes, 
place it with the other tens. Add the tens. How many? 
Now, where shall I place the number? Yes, in the tens 
place.’ The teacher should have a great number of ex- 
amples worked using bundles of toothpicks until the child 
understands thoroughly what is meant by carrying. 
Drill in addition should be continued through all the 
grades, as accuracy in this process is likely to be fol- 
lowed by accuracy in all other processes. 
If the child is to be entire master of the adding habit 
he must be trained to check his work. In addition the 
check is to add up and then down. 
Subtraction. Subtraction and addition are so closely 
related that the processes should be taught simultane- 
ously. 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  188 How to Teach Primary Grades   
The Austrian or adding method of subtraction is ad- 
vocated ‘by many teachers. These teachers claim that 
the same habit does for both processes, and that this 
method of subtraction gives additional practice in add- 
ing. Investigation will show that this is the method used 
in the business world; for instance, in making change, by 
expert cashiers, and others. 
The Austrian method is illustrated in the following 
process: In the example 7—2 instead of saying “7 less 
2,” we would say “5 added to 2 makes 7.” 
An example involving the carrying process would be 
as follows: 
What is the difference between 35 and 17? 
To find the difference between 35 and 17, we find out 
what must be added to 17 to make 35. 
35 35=3 tens and 5 ones. 
17 171 ten and 7 ones. 
18 
As 7 ones i greater than 5 ones we cannot add any- 
thing which would make 5 ones, therefore we must 
change one of the 3 tens to ones and add this to the 5 
ones. Then we have 
2 tens and 15 ones 
1 ten and 7 ones 
1 ten (added tolten) 8 ones (added to 7 ones) 
The subtraction process which involves carrying 
should not be taught until the simpler process is thor- 
oughly understood.

The teacher writes 35 on board. “I want you to take 
this many away.” She places 17 under 35. “How many 
is this in tens and ones? Which do we take away first? 
(They have already had the process which does not in- 
volve borrowing.) “Can you take away 7 ones from 5 
ones? What shall we do? Mary says to break up one 
ten. How many ones will we have? Then take away 7. 
How many left? Which is the ones place? Then where 
shall I place 8 ones (figure)? How many tens did we 
have left? How many were we to take away? Take 
one ten away. How many does that leave? Where is 
the tens place? Then where shall I place the figure 
that tells how many tens we have left?” Objects should 
be used only long enough to rationalize the process. 
The teacher should definitely decide which process of 
subtraction she desires to use, selecting the one which 
she thinks will give the best results. She should not 
attempt to teach both methods, as it will confuse the 
child. After one method has been established, the teacher 
should avoid trying to change it. 
The child should be trained to use a check in all sub- 
traction work. This will consist in adding the result to 
the second number in the series. 
Multiplication. Multiplication is developed as a 
means of shortening addition and should find its basis in 
addition.

Before beginning to teach a table rapid counting by 
the number of the table should be given, beginning with 
naught and extending to the limit of the table; for in- 
stance, for the table of 3’s the counting should be 3, 6, 
9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30. 
A table should first be memorized in regular order 
for three reasons, (1) it is easier, (2) it is rhythmic, 
and (3) its regular order is a background of knowledge 
to which the child may return if he forgets a fact. After 
the table is learned in the regular order it should be 
thoroughly drilled on in the irregular order as this is 
the way it is used in the step of application. The step 
of application should follow each table. This should 
take the form of oral and written, and concrete and ab- 
stract exercises. 
‘Investigations show that the tables offer varying de- 
grees of difficulty. It would seem best to begin with the 
one which offers the least difficulty and teach the others 
according to their rank in this scale. The following 
order is suggested, 10’s, 5’s, 2’s, 4’s, 8’s, 3’s, 6’s, 9’s, 7’s. 
The attention should be called to the similarity be- 
tween the products in the tables of 2’s, 4’s, 8’s and in 
the 3’s, 6’s, 9’s. In counting by 9 call the attention to 
the fact that the last figure is one less each time until 
naught is reached when it changes to 9. 
Simple division and simple fractions may be devel- 
oped in connection with a multiplication table; for in- 
stance, when 2(2) has been developed, the child may be 
asked, “How many 2’s in 4? What is 1% of 4?” 
The process of carrying in multiplication should be 
presented in such a way that thé child may understand 
the reason for the process. If the mastery of carrying

in addition has been.based on understanding, this will be 
an easy task. The following outline is offered as a 
suggestion: 
65 
3 
“Read 65 in tens and ones. 3(5 ones) make 15 ones. 
How many tens is this? How many ones left? Where 
is the ones place? Place the 5 ones in ones place. What 
is 3(6 tens)? Add the 1 ten. How many hundreds in 
19 tens? How many tens left? Where is the tens place? 
Write 9 tens in the tens place. Where is the hundreds 
place? Write 8 hundred in its place. What did we 
really do? Yes, we found how much 3(65) were. Then 
how can we tell if we are right? Then let us add 3(65’s) 
together.” 
Multiplying by numbers ending in naught offers an- 
other process for which the children should understand 
the reason. The outline of the process is as follows: 
1. Counting to 100 by 10’s is reviewed. 2, The table 
of 10’s is reviewed. 3. “How many are four tens? 
Place a naught at the right of 4. What number have 
you? 40 is how many 4’s? Place a naught to the right 
of 6. What number have you? 60 is how many 6’s?” 
The teacher should continue until the child sees that each 
time a naught is placed to the right of a figure it be- 
comes ten times what it was before. 4. She should lead 
him to see that when he multiplies a number ending in 
naught he simply draws or places the naught to the right 
of where he will place his answer, which amounts to 
multiplying by ten. 5. She then leads him to see that 
if he adds 2 naughts it is the same as multiplying by 100.
-P-A-G-E-192
192 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  Measuring, Weighing, Comparing. The child may 
compare the height of different’ children, and then meas- 
ure to find if he is right. He may guess the length of 
desks, lines, sticks, and other familiar objects. In the 
same way he may guess as to the quantity of water, 
sand, etc., in pints, quarts, etc. He should have a play 
store and buy and sell by the yard, pint, quart, gallon, 
and pound. Toy money should be used to make change. 
Through those activities not only will much be learned 
about these common measures but many practical prob- 
lems in addition, subtraction, and multiplication will be 
worked out. 
Roman Numbers. The small child has very little use 
for Roman numbers with the exception of the figures 
from I-XII. These should be taught in connection with 
the face of the clock or the watch.

CHAPTER XV 
ARITHMETIC—(Continued) 
THE LESSON PLAN 
Two types of lessons are involved in the teaching of 
arithmetic; namely, the inductive lesson and the drill les- 
son. The inductive lesson is always used in the presenta- 
tion and the development of a new process. It consists 
of a (1) problem, (2) the study of individual points 
which will help solve the problem, and (3) the sum- 
mary or the solution of the problem. 
After the new process has been developed the aim is to 
make this process function in an automatic way. The 
child must form the habit of thinking and of saying num- 
bers in a certain order, and of giving a certain response 
to a certain combination. When he sees or hears 55 
he should automatically think or say 25. In other words, 
the processes involved in addition, subtraction, multiplica- 
tion, and simple division must be relegated to the plane of 
habit so that the mind may be freely given to the thought 
involved in solving the natura? problems of daily life. 
The steps in the drill lesson should be those involved in 
any habit-forming lesson; namely, (1) a motive for estab- 
lishing the response; (2) a clear idea of the response; 
(3) attentive repetition of the response; (4) no excep- 
tion; (5) reviews; and (6) the application of the habit 
in a practical way. 
1. Motive. In arithmetic, as in all other subjects, 
193
-P-A-G-E-194
  194 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  interest is the keynote to success. As the child is essen- 
tially a creature of the present, this interest finds its 
source in his present-day life; that is, in the schoolroom, 
home, and playground activities. In other words, his 
arithmetic lessons should grow out of his real need for 
numbers. Only in this way can the teacher lead him to 
feel the need of arithmetic. 
It is true that many children naturally like the work 
with numbers and delight in rapid work with abstract 
numbers, but the greater number would work with added 
zest if the work were approached from the standpoint 
of utility. It is every child’s natural right to know why. 
he should learn a certain process; in other words, he 
must see and feel that he is getting something worth 
while out of it so that he may bring interest, intelligence, 
and energy to bear upon the process. 
If the teacher will plan to bring out the number ele- 
ment in handwork, nature study, reading, class manage- 
ment, and all other schoolroom activities, the problem of 
motive will, in a measure, be solved. 
Probably one of the best sources of motive is that of 
the game. Though the game may take many and varied 
forms, it will always be full of interest to the child, 
causing him to bring much energy to bear upon memo- 
rizing the number facts involved. 
Games. Games containing the number element 
may be used very profitably in developing the number 
instinct. The teacher should use games requiring much 
counting, bean bag games, and easy scoring games. 
a. The class is divided into two or more sections. 
Each section is provided with a bean-bag, ball, or an 
eraser. A waste basket or a box is placed at a given 
distance from a base. Each side takes turns in the
-P-A-G-E-195
  
Arithmetic 198 
  attempt to pitch the bean bag into the receptacle. Each 
time the attempt is successful it scores one. The side 
with the largest number of scores wins the game. 
b. A basket or box is placed as in game one. Each 
child in the class is given two trials in the attempt to 
pitch the bean bag into the receptacle. If the bean bag 
goes into the receptacle it counts two; a failure counts 
one. At the close of the game each child adds up his 
numbers. The numbers may be varied. 
c. The class is divided into sections as in game one. 
In place of using a basket or box a circle is drawn on 
the floor. The procedure is the same as in game one. 
d. The teacher draws two concentric circles on the 
floor. The smaller circle is numbered two, and the larger 
one. The game proceeds as in game two. 
e. The players are seated in rows, each row to have 
the same number of children. The first child in each row 
is given a bean bag. At a given signal each leader lifts 
‘the bean bag back over his head, and drops it on the desk 
behind. The second child in turn lifts it over his head 
in the same manner. Each child in turn lifts it over 
his head until the last child in the row is reached. This 
child runs to the front and places the bean bag on the 
first desk in the row. The row first accomplishing this 
scores one. Then each child moves back one seat and 
the child bringing the bean bag forward occupies the 
first seat. The play then continues as before.

  196 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  2. Clear Idea of the Response. A clear idea of the 
thing to be drilled on is an essential element in a drill 
lesson, inasmuch as drill is for the purpose of deepening 
certain impressions or making certain connections. Since 
each repetition should further this purpose it is of vital 
importance that the impression be a clear one. It will 
be best to: use only a very few combinations in any one 
drill lesson, as too many will result in a confused impres- 
sion of the desired response. 
3. Attentive Repetition. After the clear idea is 
acquired, the habit of making the correct response rap- 
idly and automatically is formed through attentive repe- 
tition. 
However strong the motive with which the child starts, 
the attention is likely to wander if the drill,is of long 
duration. Usually a short, snappy drill requiring imme- 
diate response will prove much more effective than one 
of longer period. 
A great variety of games and devices should be used. 
if the child is to be kept up to the mark in attention. 
4. No Exceptions. The early drill lessons should 
be so conducted that the possibility of an error will be 
reduced to a minimum, otherwise the tendency will be 
for the child to form the habit of guessing which leads 
to inaccuracy. 
Strayer’ says, “Our nervous system is so constructed 
that to do anything once leaves a tendency to do the 
same thing the same way when next we are placed in 
a similar situation. It is bad to allow careless work or 
random guessing, not simply because the result in this 
one case may be wrong, but more especially because the 
tendency to the wrong reaction is there and must be 
1A Brief Course in the Teaching Process. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  } 
Arithmetic 197 
overcome before the correct action can be fixed as a 
habit.” ‘ 
The teacher should have very little concert work, as 
she can be sure of neither accuracy nor attention. 
5. Reviews. If the number facts are to be per- 
manently fixed there should be frequent reviews or drills. 
The length of time elapsing ‘between these reviews or 
drills should be gradually lengthened. They should not 
be entirely discontinued until the child shows satisfactory 
evidence that the number habit is firmly and perma- 
nently established. 
6. Application. -If the number facts learned are 
to have real significance there should be a definite step 
of application in both concrete and abstract exercises. 
This should be both oral and written. 
If the child is to develop the ability to apply his knowl- 
edge to the ordinary problems of daily life the material 
and language used should be varied in form. Often he 
can understand the problem only when it is expressed 
in a certain phraseology. The teacher should be sure 
that he thoroughly understands each problem and that 
he is developing the power to analyze a situation and 
discover what to do. 
It is not possible for a text-book to be written which 
will furnish the concrete problems. These must develop 
from the everyday life of the pupil. They should be 
of such nature as to appeal to him as practical from his 
standpoint. Not only should these problems be given 
but the child should be permitted to make up problems. 
He should be encouraged to watch his games and other 
daily experiences for these problems. This will stimu- 
late vigorous thinking. 
The teacher should make a list of the interests of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 How to Teach Primary Grades   
child as a basis for the concrete work. If the problem 
does not touch his active interests, it is not concrete in 
the best sense. 
The ideal way to learn the arithmetic processes would 
be through work with concrete examples, but because 
accuracy and speed are necessary if the child is to be 
master of the quantitative side of life, there must be work 
in abstract exercise both oral and written. 
Oral work should always precede written work; in 
fact, the only excuse written work has for existence is 
that the mind is unable to solve many problems without 
the aid of the pencil. 
Formal analysis has no place in the primary grades, 
but it is advisable to train the child to tell how he arrives 
at a solution and why he uses a certain process. Not 
only does this prevent guessing but it reveals the line 
of reasoning. An exact form in the wording should 
not be required, but the child should be encouraged to 
seek for the best and briefest form of analysis. 
Class Mechanics. As previously stated every pre- 
caution should be taken against the first error. In a 
drill, it is better to keep the desired response in view 
for reference, should there be hesitation over the answer. 
The child should be encouraged not to answer unless he 
is sure of the correctness of his response.

  II. Teacher's Motive: (1) To help the child to dis- 
cover certain number facts through the tse of interesting 
objects. 
III. Child’s Motive: (1) To play the games. (2) 
To read the numbers. 
IV. Subject-matter and Procedure: 
Susyect-MAtTreR PROCEDURE 
1. Objects “How would you like to play that 
a. blocks you have a train and some cars? Let 
us play that these blocks are cars.” 
The teacher gives each child 6 blocks. 
“Make a train with 3 cars. Couple 
3 more to your train. How many 
cars have you? Take away 3. How 
342 many left? John and Sam may 
324 switch together the cars they have 
Borers left. How many cars are 3 cars and 
3 cars? Make a train with 4 cars. 
Add 2 more. How many have you? 
How many are 4 cars and 2 cars? 
“What are your cars filled with? 
Switch 3 cars of chickens to the main 
track. Switch 3 more cars to the 
main track. How long is your train 
now? How many cars did you have 
at first? (3) Then how many did 
you switch to the main track? How 
many are 3 cars and 3 cars?” She 
should develop the idea of 4 cars and 
2 cars by allowing the children to use 
this number of cars in the play. 
b. toy money “Each boy and girl may count out 
6 pennies. Let us play we are going 
to buy some apples and candy. You 
may spend 3 cents for apples.” She
-P-A-G-E-200
  200 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  has each child lay 3 cents on his 
desk. “How much money have you 
left? Now buy 3 cents worth of 
candy. How much money have you 
spent? How much did you spend for 
apples? How much for candy? 
How much is 3 cents and 3 cents?” 
The teacher then allows them to 
spend 4 pennies and 2 pennies until 
the idea of 4 and 2 is fully developed. 
c. boys “Let us play a game. I want 3 
boys to come and stand here. Look 
at them and then hide your eyes; I 
am going to touch some other boys 
who are to come and stand by these. 
When I clap my hands you may look 
up and I want to see who can first 
tell me how many children are stand- 
ing.” She has 3 others to come. 
“How many were there at first? 
How many more did it take to make 
6? How many are 3 and 3?” The 
teacher uses 4 boys and 2 boys in the 
game until the idea that 4 and 2 are 
6 is developed. 
2. Pictures: Cards “Let us play that these are real 
with groups of 2, 3, and cherries. Which card would you 
4 cherries. rather have? Mary may have a card 
with 2 cherries and Sam one with 4. 
How many cherries have we given 
away? Let us play that it is Eliza- 
beth’s birthday, and Helen brings her 
4 cherries (card) and Edith brings 
her 2; how many has she? Let us 
play that she eats 2 cherries, how 
many has slie?” The teacher should 
continue until the other facts are de- 
veloped.
-P-A-G-E-201
  
Arithmetic 201   
3. Imagery “How many would like to play the 
game of ‘Imagination’? Shut your 
eyes and let us imagine that we have 
3 pennies in one hand. Can you see 
them with your mind? Now imagine 
you have 3 in the other hand. Can 
you see them? How many pennies 
have you in all?” She continues 
until all facts are developed. 
4, Symbols “Boys and girls let me show you 
how to write 3 and 3 are 6. Mary 
342 may read it. John. Sam. Let me 
324 show you how to write 4 and 2 are

(Read this for me 3. “How many 3’s 
3 
; ee 3/6 2(3) - 
in 6? How many are 2(3)?” The 
children are now ready for the 
drill. Usually a drill will be more: 
interesting if two or three facts are 
drilled on at one time as this offers 
more variety. For a type on the drill 
lesson see the plan for the drill on 
multiplication table, pages 204 to 205. 
These addition facts may be substi- 
tuted for the multiplication facts. 
After these facts are thoroughly 
learned the series should be carried 
to 100; for instance 3 13 23 33 etc. 
Ges esisd 
Subtraction. If the teacher prefers to use the Aus- 
trian method of subtraction, she should first drill on the © 
addition facts just developed and then introduce the sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 How to Teach Primary Grades   
traction by addition; for example, “What must we add 
to 3 to make 6?” If the old “take-away” method is 
used, these subtraction facts should be developed paral- 
lel with the addition facts. 
Previous to this lesson the children have reviewed the 
games and exercises on reading, writing, and counting 
by 2’s to 30. 
Third Grade 
I. Topic: Development of the multiplication table

II. Teacher's Motive: (1) To lead the children to 
see the need of the multiplication table. (2) To teach 
them the meaning of the table. 
III. Child’s Motive: To learn a quicker way of find- 
ing the score in the game.

Each score was added. 
“Do any of you know how we 
could have saved time in finding our

how many 4(2’s) were, could we have 
saved time? How many 2’s have you, 
John? How many have 3(2’s)? 
Could we have saved time in these? 
What would you have needed to 
know in order to save time, Sam?” 
The teacher has each child to tell 
what he should have known in order 
to save time. “Do you know what 
we call the process of finding how 
much 3(2) is? Suppose we find out 
what the entire table is. What part 
have we found out? Suppose we 
start with 2. Let us write the 2’s in 
this form:

She allows the children to suggest 
how many 2’s to place in each row. 
“How shall we remember how many 
2’s in each row? Suppose we place 
the number of 2’s over each row. 
How shall we know this number is 
not to be added in with the 2’s?” If 
the child cannot suggest a way, the 
teacher suggests the use of paren- 
theses. “Let us add each row. How 
many does 1(2) make? In the table

204 How to Teach Primary Grades   
we write it 1(2) makes 2 or it is 
shorter to write it 1(2)=2. How 
many does 2(2’s) make? How shall 
we write this? How many 2’s in 
4? What is % of 4?” The entire 
table should be developed in this 
way. The children are now ready 
for a drill on the table. 
Third Grade 
I. Topic: Drill on 1(2), 2(2), 3(2), 4(2), 5(2). 
II. Teacher's Motive: To teach a part of multipli- 
cation table of 2’s so that the child will give the results 
automatically. 
Ill. Child’s Motive: To memorize that part of the 
table of 2’s which he needs to enable him to find his 
score quickly.

32) =0. When we learn this table we will 
4(2)=8 play our game for 10 minutes. If 
oC): =10 each of us has five throws, how much 
of the table shall we need?” 
“T will write the table here, then 
we will see how quickly we can mem- 
orize it.’ The teacher writes the 
table on the board in the form shown 
in the margin and the children 
study. “How many are sure they 
know the first two? Look some- 
where else and answer when I ask 
the number of 2’s. Do not answer 
unless you are sure.” She allows 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  Arithmetic 205   
several children to answer. “Let us 
take the first three and see how 
quickly you can learn them.” 
“Now I will erase them and I want 
you to write them on your tablet. 
Do not write the answers unless you 
are sure you are right.” ‘She has 
several children to read their com- 
binations. 
“Mary may come and be the teach- 
er and ask for answers.” She allows 
two or three children to come in turn 
and act as teacher. 
The last two combinations are 
drilled on in the same way. The 
teacher then places all the combina- 
tions on the board and has them 
read and written by the children. 
They then drill on the combinations 
by making use of a device. The 
teacher dictates the combinations and 
the children write and supply the 
products. 
The children are then permitted to 
play the game of bean bags. If a 
child makes a mistake he is not al- 
lowed to play the next time, but must 
watch the other children until he 
shows evidence of being able to give 
the table without mistake.

  CHAPTER XVI 
HANDWRITING 
AIM 
The function of handwriting is to furnish a medium 
for the communication of thought through certain rec- 
ognized written symbols. 
The teacher’s aim in teaching handwriting is to train 
the child to the habits of reproducing these written sym- 
bols accurately, legibly, beautifully, and automatically, 
using an easy natural movement, and maintaining an easy 
natural position. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
It is no more pedagogical to begin writing by teach- 
ing single letters than it is to begin reading by teaching 
the alphabet. The child learns to write so that he may 
communicate thought through written symbols. Hence, 
the most pedagogical way for him to learn to write should 
be through the symbols representing his thoughts. In 
other words it should ‘be the written expression of a 
thought which he desires to express through writing. 
In the beginning, he may present a thought by pictorial 
crawing as the rolling of the hoop ,7777— , the tick 
tock of the clock \—” or the movement of the swing 
nN. Later he may write a note of invitation to

stories and simple compositions which are to be read or 
sent to some one, words to be used in puzzle sentences 
and other games; sentences to be used in the game of 
“Deaf and Dumb.” Any one of these suggestions should 
furnish subject-matter for many lessons. 
Certain forms for these written symbols have been 
accepted as standard for the business world. In the light’ 
of present knowledge these forms are the most economical 
from the standpoint of speed, legibility, and beauty. The 
following symbols are a reproduction of these forms:

COURSE OF STUDY 
It is a much-mooted question as to whether or not 
handwriting should constitute a part of the curriculum 
of the first grade child. Those who would postpone 
it until the second or third year contend that his 
muscles are not sufficiently developed to secure the 
necessary codrdination without too great an expendi- 
ture of nervous energy and a probable strain of the 
muscles. Also, that he has very little need for the ability 
to write, inasmuch as this is the oral period of his de-
-P-A-G-E-209
  
Handwriting 209   
velopment. They would utilize this early period of his 
school life to develop the proper codrdination of these 
muscles through the rhythmic and pictorial drawings, 
leaving the written symbols for a later period. 
Those who would place handwriting in the first grade 
contend that the advantage should be taken of the child’s 
eager interest in learning to write which is especially 
manifested when he enters school. They contend that 
the development and proper coérdination of muscles may 
be obtained through real writing without harm if the 
emphasis fall on work on the blackboard. 
It would seem wiser to effect a compromise between 
these two opinions and begin the work in the first year 
with the pictorial drawing and after several weeks or 
months gradually change to the written symbols used in 
handwriting. 
First Grade. In the first few weeks or months the 
subject-matter should consist of the pictorial representa- 
tion of the child’s experiences. Mother Goose rhymes 
and poems will prove a valuable source for this pictorial 
writing. The thought in the rhyme of 
“Jack be nimble, 
Jack be quick, 
Jack jump over the candle stick.” 
may be pictured by the representation of the jump 
as (777 
The poem of “The Swing” by Robert Louis Stevenson 
may be pictured by the movement of the swing, as V4 
The turning of the rope may be represented by this 
picture ZeZzZ~’. This same picture could also be the 
representation of the drawn out coil-spring or of the 
little girl’s curl. A row of hay mounds could be pictured

as /777] , or this would represent a certain type of 
iron fence. 
It is suggested that the major movements in writing 
could be drilled on in this form of pictorial writing. 
These movements are as follows: OCD #& 
The different forms which are used in the development 
of the letters are derived from these movements. They 
are as follows: Wl“ O /2’7F4y — 
After this preliminary work the child may write simple 
letters of invitation, as “Come to see me,” to parents, 
relatives, playmates, or other schools; letters of thanks, 
as “We thank you”; letters to absent playmates, as “We 
miss you.” 
Occasionally, a simple poem which is to be sent to 
some one will furnish material for many lessons in 
writing, as 
“Twinkle, twinkle, little star; 
How I wonder what you are, 
Up above the world so high, 
Like a diamond in the sky.” 
Second and Third Grades. Rhythmic exercises for 
muscular control on the different writing movements ; for 
instance, the direct oval; words needed for simple invita- 
tions, letters, and games. Written reproductions of simple 
stories used in the language lesson; writing of original 
stories from pictures; simple compositions from nature 
study subjects. 
METHOD 
Position. Inasmuch as a natural, easy position in 
writing is an economy of time and nervous energy, it
-P-A-G-E-211
  
Handwriting 211   
should be an important part of the teacher’s aim to train 
the child to form this habit from the beginning. 
He should face the desk squarely, sitting well back in 
the seat, with head and body erect, though some forward 
bending is necessary, and with feet flat on the floor. The 
whole of the right forearm with the exception of the 
elbow, should rest on the desk, supported by the muscular 
pad just below the elbow and by the tips of the fourth 
and fifth fingers. The entire left forearm except the 
elbow should also rest on the desk at right angle with the 
right forearm. 
The pen, pencil, or crayon should be held lightly be- 
tween the first and second fingers and the thumb at about 
one and one-half inches from the point. The first finger 
rests on the top of the pencil, which crosses the second 
finger just below the first joint, and comes into contact 
with the hand at the base of the first finger. All the 
fingers are slightly bent, each one slightly more than the 
preceding one. The hand glides on the tips of the fourth 
and fifth fingers. 
Movement. The most commonly accepted move- 
ment in hand-writing is the muscular movement. Experi- 
ment has shown that this is the easiest, smoothest, and 
most natural movement. The large fleshy muscle of the 
forearm just below the elbow is used as a rolling base; 
the muscles of the upper arm and of the shoulder control 
the movement. 
Since the muscular movement used in writing is pro- 
duced by the large muscles located above the elbow and 
around the shoulder, extensive training of these muscles 
is necessary before the writing habit is satisfactorily 
established. Long before the period when the real writ- 
ing lessons begin the child may be trained in muscular
-P-A-G-E-212
ee a eee 
212 How to Teach Primary Grades   
movement through rhythmic games and pictorial writing. 
The rhythmic and pictorial writing games are regulated 
by marking the time in some way, as by counting, tap- 
ping, rhythmic phrasing, music, or the repeating of poetry. 
Rhythm. In any form of muscular movement 
rhythm is an important consideration. If the movement 
is accompanied by rhythm it results in ease, smoothness, 
and regularity. We have only to note the rhythm of 
movement when a group of laborers sing as they ply 
the pick or shovel, to be convinced of its value. 
In the rolling of the hoop the teacher repeats, “Roll, 
roll, roll” rhythmically as the child makes the picture. 
In the tick-tock of the clock she repeats “Tick-tock, tick- 
tock,” rhythmically as he makes the movement. This 
rhythmic idea may be carried out in many of the sug- 
gestions for pictorial writing given in the course of study. 
This pictorial and rhythmic work should be continued for 
several weeks or months as it builds a strong foundation 
for the work which is to follow. It should be followed 
up by writing done to rhythmic counting, phrasing, sing- 
ing, instrumental, or phonograph music. A catalogue 
from any reliable phonograph house should offer sugges- 
tions of records suitable for this work. 
Rhythmic and pictorial drawing is followed by the 
writing of words. The children decide to write a letter 
of invitation to some one to visit the school, as “Come 
to see us.” The single word come is selected for the 
first practice. A type lesson fully illustrating the class 
procedure will be found on pages 218 to 219. 
Should the formation of some letter in the word upon 
which the child is practicing prove difficult, the entire 
period may be spent in practice on this one letter. How- 
éver, a lesson period should not be given to subject-
-P-A-G-E-213
  Handwriting 213   
matter of this nature unless the need for this practice 
has been developed with the child. 
A child below the age of ten years should not be given 
movements which require precision, steadiness, complex- 
ity in adjustment, or rapidity in execution. To aid in 
avoiding these dangers it will be found much better to 
have all writing for the first few months done on the 
blackboard, and on rather a large scale. Writing in the 
air will also be helpful. 
The first work at the seat should be on unruled paper 
and the child should be encouraged to write in a large 
hand. All new forms should be made on the board and 
under the direct supervision of the teacher. In the early 
lessons if the child makes a mistake, the teacher should 
erase the form and have him rewrite it. Later, he should 
study the correct form and then compare his with it, thus 
learning to discover his own error. 
In the child’s writing the teacher should strive first 
for correct movement, position, and legibility. Later he 
may gain the necessary speed and beauty of form through 
practice. , 
Standard. A standard by which to measure the 
child’s writing progress is helpful. It may be used also 
in arousing his interest in overcoming the mistakes in 
his writing and in improving his record. By comparing 
his work with the standard he can be trained to discover 
where the difficulty is and how to correct it. The de- 
veloping of the ability to depend upon oneself is in- 
valuable. 
Following is a reproduction of a scale which may be 
used in grading the child’s writing. 
This measuring scale can be secured from the Russell 
Sage Foundation, New York. Should this scale be used
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 How to Teach Primary Grades   
in the second grade it is suggested that 20 be added to 
each per cent and if used in a third grade that 15 be 
added. 
MEASURING SCALE FOR HANDWRITING 
  
  
  THE LESSON PLAN 
The writing lesson is essentially a habit-forming les- 
son, consequently, it will conform to the principles gov- 
erning the drill lesson. These may be enumerated as 
(1) a motive; (2) a clear idea of the thing to be drilled 
on; (3) attentive repetition; (4) no exceptions; (5) re- 
views; (6) application. 
1. Motive. That the child may be interested in 
learning to write, it is essential that he see the reason for 
it and that he feel the need for it. The teacher should 
arouse his desire to communicate his thought through 
written language, for if he is interested in this expression 
he will want to learn how to write and will be willing to 
make the effort necessary for its accomplishment. He 
should also be made to realize that poor writing is likely 
to result in misunderstanding. 
The pictorial representation of ideas, the writing of 
letters to real people, and the writing of stories or poems 
which are to be read to some one should furnish practical 
problems and motives for writing.
-P-A-G-E-215
  Handwriting 215   
The little game of “Deaf and Dumb” in which the 
child pretends that he cannot talk but must write will 
furnish endless subject-matter and motive for learning 
to write. A list of questions to be used in the game to- 
gether with the answers may be compiled by the class. 
For example, “What is your name? How old are you? 
What do you like to play?” Then before the game may 
he played he must learn to write some of these questions 
and answers. 
The filling in of the blanks in the puzzle sentences is 
another source of subject-matter and motive for the 
writing lessons. In the sentence, “I see a big white 
;’ the child’s aim is to learn to write the word 
bear so he may fill in the sentence. A list may be com- 
piled for use in this game as in the “Deaf and Dumb” 
game. 
Other sources of motive are rivalry, approval of teacher 
or parent, admiration of his companions, reward, and 
fear of punishment. 
2. Clear Idea Problem. Before beginning to repro- 
duce the form, the child must have a clear idea of what 
is to be done, and how to do it. He should be encouraged 
to watch the teacher make the form again and again. 
His problem should be the necessary control and co- 
érdination of the muscles. This clear idea of what is to 
be done cannot be over-emphasized, for a child often 
stumbles and fails because he does not know what is ex- 
pected of him. Then if he makes a mistake the teacher’s 
task is much greater than it was before, for the impulse 
to make the wrong form and movement must be over- 
come before the right habits can be established. Much 
more will be accomplished when the teacher allows the 
emphasis to be on what she wants done, rather than on   
 
-P-A-G-E-216
216 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  
what she does not want done. Of course the exception to 
this rule will be when the child has formed an incorrect 
habit of either form or movement. When one of these 
mistakes is discovered it should be pointed out and special 
practice given on the right habit. This will call for both 
class and individual instruction. 
3. Attentive Repetition. Learning to write is a 
matter of practice or repetition of correct movement, 
therefore after the child has an interesting motive and a 
clear idea of what is to be done, the teacher’s problem 
will be to keep his interest and attention while the needed 
repetition is being carried forward. Repetition is largely 
wasted time unless accompanied by concentrated atten- 
tion. As a small child gives attention to a thing for only 
a short time, it will be best to have short drill periods. 
Two or three short drills, when he is fresh and will give 
his full attention, will accomplish fifty per cent more than 
one long period when he js tired and listless. 
Variety in procedure will do much toward holding the 
attention of the class. For example, if the child is prac- 
ticing on the oval, the téacher should pretend one day 
that he is making a little girl’s curl, on another day 
a drawn-out spring. 
4. No Exception. If the repetition is to be worth 
while it must be the repetition of the desired response 
and not that of error. The child should be trained to 
discover the points where the improvements should be 
made, and to avoid repetition of an error. In order to 
avoid repetition of error it would seem best for all writ- 
ing to be confined to the writing period or under the 
direct supervision of the teacher until the correct writ- 
ing habits are firmly fixed. 
Error may also creep in by having the writing period 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
Handwriting QF   
at a time when the child is either physically tired or has 
been indulging in strenuous physical exercise. 
5. Reviews. In writing, as in spelling, the teacher 
must plan for frequent reviews of the work gone over. 
This will be much easier in writing, as the child’s written 
vocabulary will develop slowly and will be very limited 
in scope. The teacher cannot count her task of teaching 
writing as completed until the child can give his entire 
attention to the thought which he is expressing. The 
mechanics of writing should be automatic and at the 
same time accurate, legible, and rapid. 
6. Application. If the interest of the child is prop- 
erly maintained, the skill gained through the drill should 
always end in the step of application. If he is learning 
to write an invitation, the drill should end in the writing 
of an actual invitation. It may take one week, two 
weeks, or three weeks to complete the practice on the 
necessary words, but the application should always be 
the final step. 
The following outline will be suggestive of the steps 
taken in a writing lesson: 
Lesson Outline. a. Rhythmic movements in the 
form of ovals, push-pull, etc., should be used as a prepa+ 
ration for all writing lessons. .This will limber up the 
muscles and result in regularity of movement. 
b. The teacher writes the subject-matter, after its de- 
velopment, on the board in a clear hand, the children 
observing. She should make an opportunity to write it 
several times. : 
c. The child writes in the air as the teacher writes on 
the board. She should count or give descriptive phrases 
as the form is made in order to bring in the rhythmic 
movement. 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  218 How to Teach Primary Grades   
d. She then has individual children to write on the 
board. In the event of a mistake she has the child to 
compare his work with the copy. 
e. In the second or third grades she has the word 
or sentence written on paper. If the material is suitable 
she should have rhythmic counting. 
f. Application. The word or sentence is added to 
the letter, story, or poem which the child is writing, or 
he is allowed to play the game.

back. Now ready, ‘Tick-tock, tick-

continue until each child gets the 
movement and has learned to swing 
his hand to the phrasing. The phras- 
ing should be regular and rhythmic, 
“If we were to make a picture of 
the motion of the pendulum, how do 
you think it would look?” She should 
encourage the children to represent 
their ideas on the board. If they do 
not have the true idea she should 
show them how it should look. 
“Mary may come and make the 
picture as I tell what the pendulum 
says. The rest of us will make it in 
the air.” She should continue by 
allowing different children to make 
the movement with the chalk. 
First Grade. This same general plan should be fol- 
lowed in a second or third grade. 
I. Topic: An invitation.  . : 
Il. Teacher's Motive: (1) To give the child a defi- 
nite motive for learning to write. (2) To insure accu-

train him to write correctly and beautifully. 
III. Child’s Motive: (1) To write an invitation to 
his mother. (2) To practice on come until he can make 
it correctly and beautifully. (3) To discover the rhyth-

IV. Subject-matter and Procedure: 
Suspyect-MAtTTER PROCEDURE 
1. A review of the “How did we make the picture of 
direct oval through the the children turning the rope? 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
    220 How to Teach Primary Grades   
pictorial drawing of the 
rope. 
2. The indirect oval 
through the rhyme of 
Jack be Nimble. James may come and make the pic- 
ture on the board while we make it 
in the air. Ready. ‘Turn, turn, 
turn, turn.’” This should be con- 
tinued for a short time. “Let us 
make a picture of the way Jack 
jumped as we repeated the rhyme.” 
The teacher has the children repeat 
the rhyme as they make the move- 
ment. 
“Wouldn’t you like to have Mother 
come to visit us? Suppose we invite 
her? How shall we do it? Don’t 
you think she will feel more as though 
she were invited if we send her a 
written invitation? What shall we 
say? Yes, ‘Come to see us.’ I will 
write it here on the board. What is 
the first word? Suppose we practice 
on this word until we can write it so 
that it looks neat. Watch me write 
it and see if you can discover any 
part of the picture of the turning of 
the rope.” She writes come in large 
script. “Did you see it? Come and 
show me which part it was. Watch 
me write come again and see if you 
see any part that is made like the 
picture of Jack jumping the candle- 
stick.” She writes come and has the 
children select the familiar part. 
“Watch me write come again and 
see what rhythmic exercises the last 
letter reminds you of.” The last let- 
ter is the movement used in the turn- 
ing of the rope. “Suppose we say 
round, up, round, jump, jump, jump, 
turn” The teacher writes on the 
board as she phrases the word. The
-P-A-G-E-221
Handwriting 221 
word has now been written five times, 
and the children have had the op- 
portunity to get a very fair mental 
image of its form and of the move- 
ment used in making it. They are 
now ready to begin the actual work 
of reproducing the written form of 
the word. 
“Boys and girls, suppose we play 
that you are writing the word in the 
air as I write it on the board. See 
if you can make it as I count it. 
Now, let us see if you can count it 
as we make it again. I want some 
one to write come on the board while 
the rest of us write it in the air.” 
The practice on the word is contin- 
ued. The work is varied by having 
two or three of the children come to 
the board at the same time. If any 
letter in the word should prove dif- 
ficult, she should say to the class, 
“We seem to be having trouble with 
0, suppose we practice on it alone 
until we can make it, for it spoils the 
looks of come to have a bad looking 
o.’ A single letter or word should 
never be taken for practice without 
some definite reason or need. 
After enough board work to insure the accurate form- 
ing of the letters, a second or third grade should be 
allowed to practice on paper. The teacher should insist 
on correct position and muscular movement. She should 
insist on muscular movement in all lessons where writing 
is used. 
As the child gains skill in writing, he may practice on 
more than one word in a lesson. 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  
222 How to Teach Primary Grades   
The practice should be first for accuracy in form, 
then for beauty, then for speed. The teacher should 
not make the mistake of going too fast or of attempting 
too much in a lesson. However, the subject-matter 
should be changed often enough to keep the work inter- 
esting. 
In the second and third grades writing, spelling, and 
written language may be correlated in a very effective 
manner. When the exercise is written there should be 
a preliminary exercise in rhythmic movement, then in 
the writing of the words or sentence the teacher should 
stress form, movement, and position.

CHAPTER XVII   
SPELLING 
AIM 
The purpose in teaching spelling is to enable the child 
to communicate his thoughts accurately through the 
medium of written language. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
As there are something like 600,000 words in the | 
English language it cannot be expected that the child 
will learn to spell the entire list. The question of the 
selection of words for the spelling lesson is an impor- 
tant one. 
It is suggested that the poor results attained in spelling 
are due to the poor selection of words making up the 
subject-matter of the spelling lesson and to the method 
or lack of method in teaching spelling. If the criticism 
as to the choice of words is well founded, it is impor- 
tant that the words be carefully chosen. When we recall 
that the purpose in teaching spelling is to enable the child 
to express himself by means of written language, we are 
convinced that his actual needs should be the basis of 
selection. 
The recognition of the importance of this factor has 
resulted in the elimination of much useless subject-matter. 
The day of isolated, unrelated lists of words is past, and 
223 
:  
-P-A-G-E-224
  224 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  also the day of imposing spelling upon the child in such 
a way that he feels that it is a subject for which he has 
little use. The spelling of today is an interesting sub- 
ject, one for which he feels the need—one in which he 
has a personal interest. 
The problem, then, is to teach the child to spell the 
words which he needs in his written work. There are 
three sources from which spelling lists may be compiled. 
The first of these is the spelling book. In using this the 
teacher should be careful to see that the words are those 
which are suitable to a child’s written vocabulary, since 
the teaching of unusual words is a great waste of valu- 
able time. Another source is the grade reader. Here, 
too, the teacher should use discrimination in choosing, 
keeping in mind the daily written vocabulary of the 
child. His reading vocabulary is of much wider scope 
than his written vocabulary, and it is a pernicious waste 
of time and energy to attempt to teach him to. spell all 
the new words in his reading lessons. The third and the 
most valuable source is the daily written work of the 
child. Here, without any question, will be found the 
words which he needs to know how to write. The 
teacher should carefully watch all his written work, 
making a list of the words which must be spelled for him 
or words which he misspells. This would be the ideal 
list for his spelling lesson. 
Because of the necessity for some system in courses 
of study, many teachers will find it better to have a care- 
fully and scientifically graded spelling book as a guide, 
supplementing this with a list made up from the written 
work of the class. The Jones Primary Speller published 
by the Capital Publishing Co., Pierre, S. Dak., is a book 
which has been compiled according to the modern prin- 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
Spelling’ 225 
ciples of teaching spelling and should prove helpful to 
the teacher. 
In using a text the teacher should furnish the child 
with the experience that will bring these words into his 
vocabulary, and then make the writing of these words 
the desire to express these experiences through writing. 
Standard. A better type of work can be done if there 
is a standard by which to measure the efficiency of the 
class in spelling. Such a standard has been worked out 
by Dr. Leonard P. Ayres. The following quotation is 
taken from this standard: “The data of this scale are 
computed from an aggregate of 1,400,000 spellings by 
70,000 children in 84 cities throughout the country. The 
words are 1,000 in number and the list is the product of 
combining different studies with the object of identifying 
the 1,000 commonest words in English writing.” 
Copies of this scale may be obtained for five cents 
each. Copies of the monograph describing the investi- 
gation which produced it may be obtained for thirty 
cents each. Address the Russell Sage Foundation, Divi- 
sion of Education, 130 East 22d St., New York City. 
COURSE OF STUDY 
A contention which has caused considerable dis- 
cussion refers to the time when formal spelling should 
be introduced. Practically all agree that it should 
not begin in the first grade though some would place 
it in the second grade, others in the third grade. 
Almost all modern writers agree in saying that it should 
not be introduced until the need for it arises. The delay 
of written composition work and of penmanship post- 
pones the need for it. It should be introduced as soon 
as the need for written expression appears.
-P-A-G-E-226
  226 How to Teach Primary Grades   
The following course of study is not given as a set 
course but only as suggestions of what may be developed 
by the teacher. 
First Grade. No formal work is done in spelling, 
though in reality a child begins to spell when he copies 
his first word. From the first the teacher should. see 
that this is accurately done. She should not call atten- 
tion, however, to the separate letters but in case of error, 
erase the word and have it rewritten. In this way he is 
trained to study the word as a whole, which is the end 
desired in these early lessons. Later he may be told that 
he has made certain letters incorrectly. When he learns 
to write the simple invitation in his writing lesson, he is 
learning to spell; likewise, in all the other subject- 
matter used in the writing period. 
Second Grade. The words necessary to write a let- 
ter of invitation to parents or friends to visit the school, 
a letter to an absent classmate, a letter to the same grade 
of another school, an invitation to a class party, an invita- 
tion to go on a nature or bird walk, a note of thanks for 
some favor as, the gift of a flower or book, words neces- 
sary to play the game of “Deaf and Dumb,” words nec- | 
essary to play the puzzle game. If a book is used these 
words may be used in the exercises suggested above. 
This may be done without reference to the order of 
words suggested in the book. 
Third Grade. The work of the second grade is 
continued except that it will be more extensive ; words for 
short compositions on nature study topics; words for 
written reproductions of simple stories ; if a book is used 
the words should be woven into the exercises suggested 
above.

LESSON PLANS 
The central problem in the teaching of spelling is to 
teach the child to write the letters of the word in a 
certain order and to do this automatically so that the 
mind may be entirely given to the thought. i hawasae to 
spell is simply a matter of forming a habit—the habit of 
using letters in a certain order. 
In spelling, as in other habit-forming lessons, there 
must be intelligently conducted drill if the child acquires 
the ability to write the word when he needs it without 
stopping to think how it is spelled. 
The principles or steps in the lesson will be (1) a 
motive for learning the words; (2) a clear idea of cor- 
rect response; (3) attentive repetition of the response ; 
(4) no exceptions; (5) frequent review of the words; 
and (6) application of the habit of response " practical 
problems. 
1. Motive. The teacher should see, first of all, that 
the child is interested in learning to spell, and that the 
conditions are such that he has a motive for the study of 
the word. The stronger the motive or the incentive the 
more close will be the attention and the sooner will the 
desired result be obtained. 
Much of the drill work in spelling is mene result   because the child sees neither the need nor the signifi- 
cance of learning to spell. So one of the problems of the 
teacher is to motivate the work properly for him. 
The motive should be strong enough and attractive 
enough to appeal to the child and to secure his attention 
for a considerable length of time. There are various 
sources for motivation. The most important is the real- 
ization of the practical need for the ability to spell the 
words; for instance, so that he can write letters, stories, 
|
-P-A-G-E-228
  228 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  compositions ; play the game of “Deaf and Dumb,” where 
he must write instead of talk; or fill in words of puzzle 
sentences. It is suggested that if the child is interested 
in his written work he will want to learn to spell the 
words which are necessary to this written expression. 
And if he fully realizes that he is to be judged by his 
ability to write correctly, he will realize that when he 
cannot spell a word he ought to learn it at once. 
Variety in procedure is oné of the best ways to attract 
and hold the attention and interest of the child. A 
promised spelling match will often secure concentrated 
attention and effort on the part of the class. A pupil 
will often work to improve his own record. The pupil’s 
record may be kept on a score card and instantly checked 
up. 
Another means for securing the interest.and attention 
is that of emulation, or the desire to excel others. This 
is the lowest type of all the motives, with the possible 
exception of the fear of punishment, and should be used 
only very occasionally. 
2. Clear Idea of Response. In this as in other habit- 
forming lessons, the first step is to help the child to form 
a clear idea of the thing to be done. In order to make 
the spelling of the word easy and natural, the teacher 
should see that he hears the word correctly and that he 
has a clear, accurate picture of it. He should be en- 
couraged to look again and again at the word until its 
image becomes firmly fixed. Many errors in spelling 
are due to faulty pronunciation and faulty visualization 
of the word. The ability to spell includes more than the 
power to reproduce the letters of a word in a given 
order. It involves the ability to pronounce the word and 
to give its meaning. A word is never well taught unless
-P-A-G-E-229
Spelling | 229 
the teacher makes sure that the child has its meaning, 
its pronunciation, and its spelling. 
In a discussion of the modern method of conducting a 
spelling lesson, Suzzallo' says, “The teachet spends his 
time in carefully presenting a few words, rather than in 
examining the child’s ability in many. New work is a 
matter of class study, where words are presented with 
unusual artfulness in order to suggest their meaning 
naturally through circumstance or context. Every effort 
is made to safeguard the child against a wrong first im- 
pression and an incorrect learning of the word. If a 
home lesson is assigned, it is not a mere blocking out of 
a number of words to be learned; the assignment is an 
exercise in which the teacher uses all his foresight in 
anticipating the various kinds of trouble the child will 
meet, focusing the attention on special difficulties and 
suggesting modes of self-instruction. The modern spell- 
ing exercise may test the child’s knowledge, but its 
primary function is to teach rather than to examine.” 
3. Attentive Repetition. After the child has a proper 
motive, a clear idea of what is to be done, the teacher 
should plan how to further the multiplicity of associa- 
tions necessary for the learning of the word. It has been 
found that the most economical method of learning to 
spell a word requires that the entire attention be given 
while the letters of the word are repeated ca written a 
number of times. Multiplicity of association is brought 
about through writing the word on the board, in the air, 
on paper, spelling it aloud, spelling it under the breath, 
etc. By this plan the eye sees, the ear hears, the voice 
reproduces, and the hand copies the word. 
If each word is to be thus carefully studied it will of 
1The Teaching of Spelling. 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  230 How to Teach Primary Grades   
necessity have to be a supervised study, for undirected 
effort will result in random effort. And furthermore, 
all the words of a list will not require the same amount 
of study. Some of them can probably be spelled with- 
out many repetitions, while others will require the most 
careful study. It is the work of the teacher to train the 
children to recognize the words that will present diffi- 
culties and to train them to overcome these difficulties. 
4. No Exceptions. As suggested in the above quota- 
tion the teacher tries in every way to get rid of error by 
anticipating and preventing it through supervised study. 
The efficient teacher will train her class to avoid making 
errors in so far as possible. The trial-and-error method 
belongs to the old order of teaching spelling. The teacher 
of the present day realizes that if the child makes a 
mistake, her task is much greater than it was, for this 
wrong way of spelling the word must be overcome before 
the right habit can be established. The child should be 
trained never to write a word or to attempt to write it 
unless he is sure he knows how to spell it. In case of 
error, a new chain of associations must be formed be- 
ginning with the pronunciation and leading through the 
meaning to the correct, written form, leaving the incorrect 
associations to fade away. 
5. Reviews. In spelling as in the other drill lessons, 
opportunity should be given for frequent reviews, for 
when the teacher has first succeeded in securing the 
desired result, she has only begun the process. If the 
child is to make the correct spelling of a word a per- 
manent part of his mental equipment, he must write or 
spell the word several times during the next few days, 
write it over and over again the next week, the next 
month, the next year. The time will come when the
-P-A-G-E-231
Spelling 231   
word is indelibly fixed in the child’s mind, and then, and 
only then, can the teacher discontinue the drill on the 
word. If it is necessary for a child to learn to spell a 
word, it is not only necessary for him to be able to spell 
it when it is assigned as a new word, but it is necessary 
that he be able to spell it ever afterward, wherever he 
may encounter it. 
Testing. In the old method of teaching spelling, the 
testing occupied the larger part of the recitation period, 
but in the modern method it is only a step in the lesson. 
As teachers are coming more and more to the teaching of 
the words which the child needs in his daily written work, 
it is possible to test his ability to spell in sentences. How- 
ever, the only test is the spontaneous written expression 
of the child. 
6. Application. If spelling is to continue to appeal to 
the child as a practical subject, the teacher should plan 
many exercises for its application. Not only does this 
make the subject vital for him but it helps to fix the 
words in mind. It is also the truest test of his efficiency 
in spelling. 
One of the teacher’s problems will be to provide 
enough natural opportunities for this application. These 
may be found in letters written to friends, absent play- 
mates, or to children in another school; in compositions 
based on nature study topics; the written reproduction 
of the stories which are to be read or sent to parents or 
friends, in the game of “Deaf and Dumb,” and in puzzle 
sentences. 
Devices. In spelling, a list of words known as a black 
list will prove helpful. This list is kept in a con- 
spicuous place on the board. Any word which is mis- 
spelled by a number of children is placed on this list. 
   
-P-A-G-E-232
  232 How to Teach Primary Grades   
They are encouraged to eliminate words from this list 
as rapidly as possible. 
In addition each child should have a personal list 
which he may keep in a small blank book. To this list 
should be added any word which he misses or which he 
has to have spelled for him. He should be tested fre- 
quently on this list. 
Outline of Steps ina Lesson. The following outline 
for conducting the spelling lesson should contain much 
that is helpful in way of suggestions. This outline may 
be modified or added to according to the needs of the 
class. The varying difficulty of the words should also 
affect the outline. 
The change wrought in the teaching of spelling has 
had its effect on the number of words assigned each day. 
It is the general consensus of opinion that two to four 
new words a lesson should be assigned in the primary 
grades. 
I. Motive: The child’s interest is aroused in learn- 
ing to write the word. 
II. Teaching Method (to be applied to each individual 
word): 
a. The pronunciation and meaning of the word is 
developed in connection with the child’s motive for 
learning to write it. 
b. Write the word slowly on the board, the class 
following visually the formation of the letters. Write 
the word compactly. 
c. Divide the word into syllables, orally, and then 
write it in syllables. Call on individuals to pronounce 
and then spell orally by syllables. Pronounce by sylla- 
bles only when necessary to make it clear. 
d. Have pupils to point out familiar parts of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
Spelling 233   
word such as phonograms or smaller words included in 
it. Then have them point out the new or unfamiliar 
parts. Lead the class to study the word to see which are 
the difficult parts. Have the pupils close the eyes and 
visualize the different parts. 
e. Have the pupils write the word in the air as you 
write it on the board. Then have them write it on the 
board or on paper. Have them pronounce and softly 
spell the word as they write. This should be under the 
breath. 
f. Allow the class a moment in which to look at the 
word again, then have them close their eyes and visualize 
Its 
III. Reviewing (when drilling for. impression) : 
a. After the words of the new lesson have been taught 
as above, allow a few minutes for studying the whole 
list again, suggesting that each pupil emphasize the word 
or words which he thinks he does not know. The time 
should be limited so that each pupil will concentrate 
vigorously. 
b. Call on pupils individually, and at times in concert, 
to spell the entire list as dictated without looking at the 
board. Refer them to the board at once if they hesitate. 
IV. Testing: 
a. Erase all the words from the board and dictate 
them to the class for a written test, using each in a sen- 
tence. It will be well to have the entire sentence written 
if it contains no new words. If it is possible to make a 
sensible sentence, bring in the words which the children 
need for review. Insist that no child attempt to write a 
word unless he is sure he can spell it. 
b. Dictate review words to class. 
c. To check the work, write the words or sentences on
-P-A-G-E-234
234 How to Teach Primary Grades   
the board and have each child compare his work with 
the model. 
d. Words that are misspelled are placed on the black 
list or on the individual lists. 
V. Assignment. Only review words. 
ILLUSTRATIVE LESSON 
Second or Third Grades 
I. Topic: bird, red, robin. 
Il. Teacher's Motive: (1) To give the child a motive 
for learning to spell bird, red, robin. (2) To give him 
a clear picture of each word and to help him to reproduce 
it in writing. 
II. Child’s Motive: (1) To learn to write bird, red, 
and robin so that he may fill out the puzzle sentence. 
IV. Subject-matter and Procedure: 
Supyect-MatTTER PROCEDURE 
The teacher should give about two 
minutes to some of the rhythmic 
movements used in writing. Through- 
out the lesson she should insist upon 
correct position, form, and movement. 
“Boys and girls, do you ever try 
As I came to school I to fill in puzzle sentences? I have a 
saw a (bird). It fad a puzzle here and I want to see if you 
(red) breast. It was a can guess what the words are which 
(robin). I have left out.” The children are 
allowed to study and discuss the sen- 
tences until the correct words are 
found. “Would you like to write 
these sentences and fill in the blank? 
If you do that, we shall have to learn 
to write bird, red, and robin; then I 
will let you fill out the puzzle and 
carry it home to your mother.”
-P-A-G-E-235
  
Spelling 235   
bird 
robir 
bird “Watch me write bird on the board. 
Sound it for me. How many sounds? 
Which two letters make one sound? 
Have we had this sound before? Let 
us spell bird. Pronounce each letter 
as I point at it.’ The teacher has it 
spelled twice in concert. “This time 
I want you to spell it as I make each 
letter on the board.” She has it 
spelled by several children, writing 
it each time. In this way the children 
are forming a vivid image of the 
word. “Now you write the word in 
the air as I write it on the board, 
naming the letters as we make them.” 
She has it written twice. She writes 
in large script. “Each of you take 
your pencil and write bird, spelling 
it softly as you write. 
“Now turn your back and see if 
you can spell it without looking at 
the board. If you are not sure, look 
at the board immediately, for we do 
not want a single mistake made. 
“Turn your paper over and let us 
see if you can write bird without 
looking at the board. If you are not 
sure, look at the board, as we do not 
want any one to make a mistake.” 
Red should be studied in a similar 
way. 
“What kind of bird did I see? 
Watch me write robin. How many 
syllables has robin? Let me write it, 
dividing it into syllables. Pronounce 
it by syllables. Do you see a fa- 
miliar part to this word? Yes, we 
have had in. What does that leave? 
Well, rob will be easy to learn, won’t

  it?” Robin is studied in a way simi~ 
lar to that used in studying bird. 
“Which of these words do you 
think will be the hardest? I want you 
to study this list for a few minutes, 
studying the hardest word the long- 
est time, and then I will see if you 
can write the answer to the puzzle.” 
She gives the children a few minutes 
to study. After this she takes up the 
practice papers, erases the words from 
the board, and has the children copy 
the sentences, filling in the blanks, If 
the teacher has more than one grade 
this may be the seat-work period. 
She should impress on the class that 
she does not want them to try to 
write a word unless they are sure of 
it. She should also impress the fact 
that the only honorable thing to do 
in a case like this is to ask the teach- 
er so that she may help him to learn 
the word. It would be a terrible 
disgrace to copy from another child’s 
paper.

CHAPTER XVIII 
HISTORY, NATURE STUDY, AND 
GEOGRAPHY 
AIM 
History and Geography. The history and geography 
of the primary grades are studies of the home life, the ~ 
community, and all forms of allied life. Their purpose is 
to socialize the child by leading him to an intelligent 
appreciation of his surroundings and of his part in this 
life. He is by nature wholly selfish and sees the world 
only in relation to himself. If he is conscious of the 
service rendered him, he takes it as a matter of course 
and gives nothing in return. 
Nature Study and Geography. Not only should the 
child be led to recognize the interdependence of man 
upon man but he should see man’s dependence for suste- 
nance and enjoyment upon other forms of life. In these 
studies he should be led to see how the earth is adapted 
to man’s habitation and is therefore fitted by a wise 
creator to be his home. 
Nature Study should aim to develop in the child an 
intelligent and sympathetic interest in the world about 
him to the end that he can better adjust himself to his 
environment. He should have more than a mere knowl- 
edge of things; he should have an abiding interest in all 
forms of nature; he should have a healthy curiosity to 
237  
-P-A-G-E-238
    238 How to Teach Primary Grades   
know the names of everything he sees; he should have 
such a constantly growing appreciation of natural beauty 
in all its forms that it will lead him to select and create 
beautiful surroundings; he should have such a growing 
realization of the economic importance of nature that it 
will lead him to protect and control it for the good of 
mankind ; he should have a permanent attitude of investi- 
gation concerning the adaptation of form to function, the 
relation of nature to the needs of man, and the problem 
of its control; he should carry into his home, in a ma- 
terial and practical way, many things gleaned from the 
study of nature in the school. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
History and Geography. The first step is to bring 
the child into intelligent connection with his surround- 
ings by a study of the home and community life. The 
community life is approached through a study of the 
work of the father, the sources of food, clothing, shelter, 
and other provisions for home needs and comforts. 
Through these studies the child should be trained to 
see that human progress has been made possible by 
division of labor and by codperation. This idea may be 
developed, also, through the work of the home and 
through school life and games. He should be led to dis- 
cover the universality of the family idea by a study of 
homes in other lands. 
Through these studies the child should slowly awaken 
to the mutual interdependence of the different members 
of the human family. He should awaken to the realiza- 
tion that no man can live unto himself but that the truest 
life must be one of service.
-P-A-G-E-239
  
History, Nature Study, Geography 239   
Nature Study and Geography. The experience and 
needs of the child form the basis for the selection of the 
material for the study of nature. The work should begin 
with a study of the immediate environment, and as his 
horizon gradually broadens and his interests begin to 
rest on more complex experiences, the teacher may go 
farther afield for subject-matter. He should recognize 
the interdependence of different sections of the country 
and of different countries one upon the other. 
He should study the home, food, physical character- 
istics, and habits of the animals and plants which furnish 
him food, clothing, shelter, and other home comforts. In 
other words, he should be led to recognize the close rela- 
tion between all forms of life and of the activities in the 
world. 
COURSE OF STUDY 
The following outlines are given as suggestions for the 
correlation which could be made in history, geography, 
nature study, and hand work. The hand work suggested 
will be developed in Chapter XX. 
These outlines should not be completed in regular 
order, topic by topic, but should be handled according 
to seasons. In the fall, “Family and Community Pleas- 
ures” should be discussed from the standpoint of the 
pleasures in the fall. In connection with the fall pleasures 
all the correlation pertaining to fall work should be car- 
tied out. In the winter, the teacher should revert to this 
same topic and discuss winter pleasures together with the 
allied topics. In the spring the same topic will again 
be taken up. Each topic should be treated in this way 
if it contains anything peculiar to a season.

Second Grade 
The work of the first grade is used as a basis for a 
more extensive study of home and community life, and 
their relation to the other parts of the country. Primi- 
tive life, as represented by the Tree-dwellers and Cave- 
men is studied and compared with a later period of life 
as represented by the Indian life of Colonial days; then 
comes the study of colonial life. 
In the first grade the aim has been to awaken the 
child to a knowledge of his interdependence on man 
and nature for his existence, and to the fact that he has 
a service to render to the community. His sympathies 
have been aroused through the simple study of the child 
life of the Japanese, of the Eskimos, and of the Colonist. 
In the second grade his sympathies are expanded and 
strengthened as he is led to see the progress of men 
toward a life of greater service. He is led to realize 
how codperation, invention, and education lighten the. 
work of the world and make it a happier place in which 
to live.

Third Grade 
In this grade, the child is brought into closer touch with 
the life of colonial days and of other lands. His work is 
beginning to have a real historical aspect. He makes a 
closer study of some of the events of colonial history 
which have been touched on in the second grade. He is 
led to see how others have suffered hardship that there 
might be peace and liberty. His sympathies are deepened 
and broadened by a study of life in other lands. The 
great war of nations is made a basis for this study. 
This work is developed largely by stories, relics, curios, 
pictures, and the sand-table. The child is encouraged to 
dramatize the different scenes, using very simple costumes 
and stage settings.

  CHAPTER XIX 
HISTORY, NATURE STUDY, AND 
GEOGRAPH Y—(Continued) 
METHOD 
In these studies of history, geography, and nature 
study, there should be the actual observation of the thing 
studied, whenever practicable. When feasible, the mate- 
rial should be brought to the schoolroom. A school- 
made museum will form a very interesting part of this 
work, When it is not practicable to bring the material 
to the schoolroom excursions may be made to points of 
interest. When neither of these is possible much may 
be made clear through the use of pictures. The teacher 
and the child should keep a close watch on all papers 
and magazines for pictures of interest. These pictures 
may be made into scrap-books or may be exhibited on a 
bulletin board. Later the pictures may be placed in boxes 
or envelopes and put away for future reference. 
The stereoscope is a valuable asset in the teaching of 
history, geography, and nature study. With the excep- 
tion of the motion picture, the stereoscopic picture is pos- 
sibly the next best thing to the actual object. It may 
be procured very cheaply from certain school-supply 
houses. The largest and best assortment of pictures is 
furnished by the Underwood and Underwood Company, 
New York. 
The sand-table is another valuable asset in this work. 
259 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  260 How to Teach Primary Grades   
Here the child may gain some idea of the life in other 
parts of his own country and of that in foreign lands. 
The use of the sand-table will be discussed more fully in 
Chapter XX. 
LESSON PLANS 
The lessons in history, geography, and nature study 
are appreciation lessons the aims of which are to awaken 
and to develop a love for and appreciation of the beauti- 
ful in nature and in the relationship existing in all forms 
of life. 
The first step in awakening appreciation is a true ap- 
preciation on the part of the teacher. It is suggested that 
she become a student of nature and of social relation- 
ships. She should utilize every opportunity for first- 
hand observation, and in addition books, pictures, and 
specimens should be used. Literature and art offer a 
splendid opportunity for awakening this appreciation. 
The attitude of the child at the beginning of the lesson 
is very important. An appreciation‘lesson may be entirely 
spoiled if his attitude is the reverse to that of apprecia- 
tion. Should he be cross and tired or ill the teacher will 
find great difficulty in obtaining the desired results. 
Again he may have gained erroneous ideas which will hin- 
der the development of appreciation. Consequently, the 
step of preparation is rather an important one as it is 
through this step that the teacher strives to bring the 
child to a desirable attitude toward the lesson to be pre- 
sented. Sincere appreciation is a matter of the emotions. 
It may be aroused through a story, a poem, a picture, a 
game, a bright little song, or by an apt question. 
The next step in the lesson is the presentation of the 
new material. This may be most successfully done by
-P-A-G-E-261
  
History, Nature Study, Geography 261 
the use of the natural objects, by a picture, or by a speci- 
men, or curio. The child should be allowed a few minutes 
for free observation, then by well selected questions, the 
attention should be directed to points of interest. 
The lessons in social life and nature study offer excel- 
lent opportunity for the development of the reasoning 
power; for example, “Why is the color of the wild rab- 
bit a means of protection?”

cable, otherwise a demonstration 
should be made on the sand-table.

2. Why used “Why do you suppose people want- 
ed to live in caves? Let me tell you 
how they lived before and see if you 
can work out the reason. Their 
houses were made of brush in the 
rudest kind of way. When the 
ground was covered with ice and 
snow how do you suppose they felt? 
Could a cave let in as much cold as 
these brush huts? Then why would 
it make a better home? 
“Would you have liked to live in 
a cave? Why or why not? What 
has helped us to have better houses?” 
(Education, invention, and codpera- 
tion.) 
3. Location “Is there any reason why one cave 
would be better than another? What 
are the things we think about when 
selecting a home? (Water, drainage, 
sunlight, shade, beauty of surround- 
ings, convenience to school, church, 
and business.) Which of these do 
you think the cave men would have 
had to consider? (Water.) Why 
would the things we consider make 
our homes pleasanter than a cave? 
4. Furnishings: “What kind of furniture do you 
a. bed suppose the Cave-men had? What 
b. carpet places did they have for getting fur- 
c. bowls niture? (Nature.) What do you 
suppose they used for bed? (Branches 
of trees.) What kind of trees do you 
think would have the best branches? 
Let us go out and see if we can find 
a tree that would make a bed.” The 
children are guided in the selection 
of an evergreen. 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  
History, Nature Study, Geography 265   
5. Light and heat “What could they use for floor 
covering? Did any of you ever make 
a playhouse in the woods? What did 
you use as a carpet? (Moss and 
leaves.) Do you not think the Cave- 
men could have used moss and leaves? 
Do you suppose they had any dishes? 
What could they have made dishes 
of? How many of you have seen 
gourds? What do people make of 
them? What could the Cave-men 
have made of them? (Bowls.) What 
did they use for knives and forks? 
(Fingers.) Does our furniture make 
our homes nicer than the homes of 
the Cave-men? Why do we need 
more furniture than the Cave-men 
had? Why can we get more than the 
‘Cave-men could? (Results of edu- 
cation, invention, and codperation.) 
“How do you think they could see 
in the cave? How would you like 
to depend on a fire for your light? 
What else did the fire do besides fur- 
nish light? Do you suppose they 
could have lived in the cave in the 
summer? Why not? Could they 
have lived in the cave without fire? 
Why not? I do not know whether 
they went back to the brush huts in 
the summer or not, but I dare say 
they did. What kind of lights do we 
have? Are these better than fire- 
light? Why? Why do we need bet- 
ter lights? What has helped us to 
have better ones?” (Education, in- 
vention, and codperation.)

ready to tell mother about the home

Then, how would the rabbit’s color 
help him to escape his enemies? 
“Look at his upper lip. Do you 
see anything peculiar about it? What 
good do you suppose that it? Would 
that aid him in getting scent with his

“Are you able yet to tell any of 
the food which he eats?” (Bark and 
anything eaten since the beginning 
of the lesson.) “I want you to watch 
for several days and we will give him 
different things and find out just 
what he likes.” 
Summary: “Now let us see what 
we have learned. What will you tell 
your mother about the rabbit?” The 
teacher helps the children to organ- 
ize their knowledge and then has 
different ones suggest what they will 
tell at home.

CHAPTER XX 
HANDWORK 
AIM 
The desire to express ideas with any material at hand 
is instinctive. With the child it tends to find expression 
in some form of handwork. Considerable attention is 
being given to this form of work as teachers have realized 
that the more ways thought can be expressed the clearer 
it becomes. 
The aims in handwork are (1) to help the child gain 
clear-cut images or thoughts; (2) to train him to addi- 
tional avenues of expression; (3) To train the will to 
accomplishment through purposeful effort. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
Handwork takes two forms, that of free expression, 
and that which is directed because it represents some 
historical or geographical fact. The teacher should 
ever be on the alert for any indication of a tendency to 
express thought in either words or by motor activity. 
Especially should she watch for and encourage any ten- 
dency to creative work. Only through creative work 
does the child attain the best growth. Dynes? says, 
“Every child must do in order to know... . Every 
thought tends to issue in some form of motor activity; 
  
Iocializing the Child. 
270
-P-A-G-E-271
Handwork 271 
  
and unless the motor phase is developed, the idea does 
not come to completeness.” The child should be con- 
stantly encouraged to give expression to his ideas through 
handwork. The literature studied should furnish a rich 
field for this free expression type. 
There are several different forms of handwork in the 
primary grades; namely, clay molding, freehand paper 
cutting, paper folding, spool knitting, mat weaving, and 
drawing. The selection of the form should be governed 
by the idea to be expressed. 
When using clay the child should learn of the com- 
mercial uses to which clay is put; something of its life 
history, and something of the workers who devote their 
time to this work. He should recognize these workers 
as people who are serving mankind. In the study of clay 
he should be taken for a visit to a clay bank and some- 
thing of the process of the mining explained to him. 
Then, by the use of pictures he should be given some idea 
of the process through which clay is taken in the manu- 
facture of dishes. 
When using paper, its use and the source from which 
the materials come should be discussed. 
In the work with the furniture, he should be taught 
something of the industries by which furniture is made, 
also something of the source of the material. 
In all this work the aim should be to give the child 
an insight into the world of industry. Through this his 
sympathies should be broadened and thereby he will be 
brought into closer touch with the lives of the workmen 
who make the material things of life. 
COURSE OF STUDY 
This course of study is offered merely to suggest 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
272 How to Teach Primary Grades   
the possibilities of handwork as an expression of 
thought. If the teacher thoroughly understands the 
idea, she should find a wealth of material to use. The 
outlines are based on the course of study given in the 
chapters on Literature, and on History, Nature Study, 
and Geography. 
First Grade 
I. Literature and Reading. The stories and poems 
developed in literature and reading are illustrated by clay, 
paper folding, or paper cutting. The scenes of these 
stories and poems lend themselves admirably to the sand- 
table, scrap-book, or poster. The story of ‘““The Wonder 
Flower” given in Chapter VIII, pages 102 to 103, is used 
in either of these ways. In the sand-table work Carl, 
the mother, the home, the mountains, flowers, sheep, 
river, and trees are duplicated. Carl and the mother are 
represented by small dolls, the home folded from paper 
or cardboard, the mountains represented by sand, etc. 
The type of home and the costumes worn by the people 
of the country in which Carl lived should be studied. 
As the story progresses other features are added. The 
child should be allowed to suggest and work out his own 
ideas and to plan the arrangement. 
A poster or scrap-book is made by cutting the house, 
mountains, sheep, etc., in silhouette and arranging them 
so that they will tell the story. 
In the literature, the story of the “Three Bears,” given 
in Chapter XIII, pages 167 to 169, may be represented by 
the sand-table or poster. On the sand-table the woodland 
scene with the house of the Three Bears should be made. 
The house is constructed either of cardboard or of three 
or four small boxes. The house is furnished with fur- 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  Handwork 273 
  
niture made of paper. The three bears are either cut 
or molded. The little girl is represented by a small doll 
or clothes pin, or is cut from paper. A poster may also be 
made similar to that of “The Wonder Flower.” 
In the poem of the “Two Kittens,” given in Chapter 
XIII, pages 175 to 176, the story is represented by the 
sand-table or the poster. The house, the kittens, the 
mouse, the old woman, and the broom are placed on the 
sand-table; the ground is covered with snow made of 
cotton; a mat is placed at the door. This is made of 
paper or from a chain made on a spool knitter. 
a. Stories, narrative poems, and rhymes from the 
readers. 
(1) Stories: The Three Pigs, The Three Bears, 
The Musicians of Bremen, The Hen and the Grain of 
Wheat, The Fox and the Little Red Hen, Little Red 
Riding Hood, The Elves and the Shoemaker, and other 
stories used in literature. 
(2) Poems: The Two Kittens, The Swing, Mother 
Goose Rhymes, and other narrative poems. 
Il. History, Geography, and Nature Study. The 
work in these subjects will furnish an abundance of 
material for the handwork. The sand-table is especially 
valuable in the history work. The poster and the scrap- 
book are also very helpful in adding interest and motive, 
and in giving understanding to this work. 
The handwork in history will require more direction 
than that in literature as its purpose is to represent some 
fact. The child should be helped to gain these images 
‘and impressions through pictures, reading, stories, and 
conversation.

b. Poems: Hiawatha, and other descriptive and nar- 
rative poems. 
II. History, Geography, and Nature Study. 
The work in this grade will be largely that of working 
out sand-table projects. A sand-table should be worked 
out for each topic suggested in Chapter XVIII. The 
teacher should lead the child to make a close study of 
pictures and of the reading matter in order to decide 
on the objects to be used, and on the construction and 
arrangement of these objects. 
Scrap-books and posters may also be made to repre- 
sent trips to the different countries; for example, a train 
to carry the child to New York; views of New York; a 
steamship, etc. Many suggestions for activities and 
hhandwork will be found in “Socializing the Child” by 
Dynes. 
METHOD 
The teacher should bear in mind the important fact 
that before an idea can be expressed by handwork, there
-P-A-G-E-279
Handwork 279   
must be a clear image of the thing to be made. In the 
story of the “Three Bears” the child must have a definite 
mental image of a bear before he can mold or cut one. 
These mental images may be formed by the use of nat- 
ural objects, which is the best means of creating them, 
or by the use of pictures or drawings. 
Another important principle for the teacher to recog- 
nize is that the child is not interested primarily in the 
doing of handwork, but his interest is in what he is to 
do with the finished product. It may be a part of a 
sand-table scene, a poster, a scrap-book, or a gift for 
some one. The recognition of this principle will pre- 
vent aimless and ofttimes careless work on the part of 
the child. The handwork should always present some- 
thing in the way of a problem, but it should be one which 
he can solve without too much direction or help. In all 
the work the teacher should make sure that the child has 
the correct image and then leave him to work out the 
idea in ‘his own way. Even if the result is not so good, 
the child has made a gain in the way of working out his 
own problems. 
The teacher should encourage and praise all faithful 
and purposeful effort, and especially commend any sign 
of creative work. When the child is working out a 
story of a problem he should be held to that task and 
not permitted to make objects foreign to the matter in 
hand. ; 
Posters. The idea of the poster is to express a thought 
or story by means of freehand paper cutting. This paper 
cutting should be freehand, else its value is in a large 
measure lost. Only silhouette cutting should be attempted. 
The teacher should be sure that the child has the correct 
image before he begins to cut. He should begin with 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  
280 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  very simple objects such as fruit or a ball. After the 
object is cut it should be arranged and pasted on a large 
piece of paper of darker color. The cuttings should be 
arranged so they will tell the story represented. 
Scrap-books. To make a scrap-book the child may fold 
together several large sheets of paper and fasten in the 
fold. A picture or a suitable title is placed on the out- 
side sheet. Pictures are cut, arranged, and pasted so as 
to tell the story suggested on the outside. 
Doll House. A doll house may be made in the fol- 
lowing manner: Several boxes about eighteen inches 
square and several inches deep are secured. These are 
arranged with the open sides out so as to form two or three 
rooms below and two above. An extra piece of' card- 
board should be placed in roof fashion over the top; 
windows and doors may be cut in each room; the walls 
may be finished by papering or by coloring with crayons; 
the color schemes should be carefully watched. Each 
child should be encouraged to have a doll house at home. 
Considerable pleasure and profit should result from the 
furnishing of this house. The different articles of furni- 
ture, the relative size of each piece, the placing of the 
furniture, etc., will have to be decided. The proper care 
of rooms, etc., will furnish material for the further de- 
velopment of the child. He should first be allowed to 
try to make the different articles of furniture. If he 
succeeds he should be praised. Should he find the task 
too difficult, he is then ready for simple directions from 
the teacher. 
Sand-table. The sand-table is a very necessary article 
in the handwork course. One can easily be made accord- 
ing to the following directions: a shallow box, any size 
desired (the bigger the better), is placed on legs, lined
-P-A-G-E-281
Handwork - 281 
  with paper and filled with the cleanest sand procurable. 
In working out the stories on the sand-table the child 
should be allowed the privilege of expressing his own 
ideas as to the objects used and as to the arrangement 
of these objects. - In history or geography the teacher 
will have to guide him in the selection and arrangement 
of the objects so as really to represent the historical or 
geographical scene. This may be done by guiding him in 
making a close study of pictures, by careful reading, or 
by listening to readings which describe the scenes. He 
should be. trained to verify his judgments and opinions 
by reference to pictures and books. The teacher should 
guard against a false idea on the part of the child as to 
size and distance on the sand-table. He should be taught 
that a sand-table does not duplicate the scene but simply 
represents it in a very miniature way. This idea can 
best be developed by making the first table to represent 
a scene with which he is thoroughly familiar ; for example, 
the schoolhouse and grounds. In this way he will see 
how much smaller the sand-table is than the real thing. 
Water is represented by blue paper under glass; snow 
is represented by cotton with coarse salt or powdered 
mica sprinkled over it; people are represented by small 
dolls, clothespins, miniature people cut out of paper, or 
by pictures; trees are represented by twigs and small 
branches from trees; other objects may be molded in 
clay, cut out of paper, or made by paper folding. 
Materials. If money is available the teacher can 
procure construction paper, scissors, clay, crayons, paste, 
and all other supplies from A. Flanagan Company, Chi- 
cago. Catalogue giving complete descriptions, prices, etc., 
will be sent without charge upon request. 
1. The construction paper comes in many different
-P-A-G-E-282
    
282 How to Teach Primary Grades   
shades and is very desirable from the artistic standpoint. 
However, if money is not available the teacher can carry 
forward this work with material which she can procure 
with little expense. For paper-folding and paper-cutting 
newspaper, wrapping paper, and old magazines may be 
used. 
2. Scissors: Usually the teacher can get each child 
to buy a pair of small scissors (costing only 10 or 15 
cents). If itis not practicable to have scissors, the object 
may be torn by placing the thumbs and first fingers very 
close together and tearing only a small bit at a time. 
3. Clay: Very often clay suitable for this work will 
be found in clay banks near the school. However, as this 
must be screened, sifted, washed, and properly mixed 
with water to be of service, the teacher is advised to buy 
a pound or two of the clay which never hardens and can 
be used over and over. 
When an especially good piece of work is to be kept 
for a permanent exhibit, it may be remolded, using the 
following preparation: 1 part salt, 2 parts cornstarch. 
Mix to a paste with boiling water. Set on the stove 
and boil until thick, stirring constantly. This will not 
harden for two or three days. 
4. Paste: Paste may be purchased in quantity from 
A. Flanagan Company, Chicago, or the teacher can make 
her own paste according to the following formula: Mix 
flour and water to form a thick paste. Add enough 
alum to keep from souring. Cook until thick, stirring to 
prevent scorching. This will keep for several days. 
5. Paper Cutter: A good paper cutter will be a great 
asset, not only in this work, but in the many other activ- 
ities of the school. It will be best to invest in a good 
standard cutter rather than one of inferior quality.

6. Pantagraph: A pantagraph for enlarging or de- 
creasing the size of pictures can be used to an advantage 
in this work. 
7. Hectograph: In some of the sand-table projects, 
it will be necessary to have outline pictures fer the child 
to cut by. These should be used only when the free- 
hand cutting is beyond his ability. These pictures can 
be prepared in a very short time.with a hectograph. A 
hectograph may. be purchased from A. Flanagan Com- 
pany, Chicago, or the teacher can make one according 
to the following directions: Gelatine 4 ounces, glycerine 
24 ounces or 1% pints; soak gelatine 12 hours in just 
enough water to cover; pour off water and cook to 200° 
Fahrenheit ; place a shallow pan in a level place and pour 
in the mixture; remove all bubbles with a blotter; allow 
the solution to harden. Copying ink may be purchased 
from the same company, or made from the following 
formula: 
Duplicator Ink: 1 ounce dark green aniline or 1 
ounce methyl violet aniline; 1 ounce glycerine, 10 ounces 
rainwater. 
LESSON PLANS 
In the lesson in handwork the teacher should strive 
to develop the child’s initiative and individuality. Di- 
rections or set ways of making an object are avoided as 
much as possible. She should endeavor to give him a 
clear mental image of the problem in hand and then 
encourage him to work out the problem in his own way. 
After he has a clear idea of a bear in connection with 
the story of “The Three Bears,” he is given clay and is 
told to make a bear, or he is given paper, scissors, and 
paste and is told to make the big bear’s chair. At first 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  284 How to Teach Primary Grades 
his efforts are very crude, but after a few weeks of this 
work it is marvelous what he is able to do. In this work 
he is developing not only self-reliance, but the power 
of expressing his ideas in a clear, forceful style. After 
he has done his best and fails, the teacher may give 
him the directions for working out the problems. How- 
ever, this should not be done until the child feels the 
need for it.

  CHAPTER XXI 
MUSIC 
AIM 
One of the most beautiful modes of expressing thought 
is through music. Some of the most beautiful thoughts 
of the world are expressed in this way. Music arouses 
feeling and emotion as does no other form of expression. 
It has the power of inspiring man to noble acts of patriot- 
ism, heroism, altruism, self-sacrifice, sympathy, and ten- 
derness; it has power to move him to tears, to a state 
of despondency or joy; it has the power to soothe his 
nerves, to quell impatience and angry passion, and to 
make him forget worry. It makes life more beautiful 
in many ways. 
The kind of music which a person enjoys and which 
will influence him depends upon his experience and his 
training in interpretation of music. The music of the 
Chinese does not carry the same message to an American 
that it does to the Chinaman. Neither does the classic 
music carry a message to the man not musically educated. 
If the child is to be fully developed, he should not be 
denied the pleasure which comes through this very im- 
portant mode of expression. It is the opinion of ex- 
perienced music teachers that practically every one could 
be trained to sing if this training were begun in the 
early years. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that 
285
-P-A-G-E-286
’ 286 How to Teach Primary Grades   
the appreciation of good music is a matter of training— 
a training which is possible to practically every individual. 
As in literature, this training should begin in the early, 
formative years. 
The specific purpose in the early years is to develop 
the child’s sense for rhythm, cultivate his sense for 
harmony and melody through the use of song and 
musical instrument, and to train him to express himself 
through music. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
As in language music has its beginning in imitation, 
therefore this is the natural way to begin training in 
musical expression inasmuch as tone element is learned 
only through the ear. 
The first step is tone matching; for example, bird 
calls. The : and the child teacher sings 
“Cuck-00” 
answers 
The call of the 
“Cuck-00” whip-poor-will, 
bob-white, and chic-a-dee, also are used. Tone matching 
is also developed through the.roll-call. The teacher sings 
and the child 
answers by singing 
“Mary” “T’m here”   
 
-P-A-G-E-287
Music 287 
This is followed by the rote song which is used to 
give the child an easy means of expressing himself music- 
ally; as the means of developing a strong feeling for 
rhythm and tune; and to train the mind to recognize and 
to think melody. Practically all the work of these early 
years is based on the rote song. 
The morning greeting may be used in these exercises 
in tone matching. 
(Teacher) “How do you do?” (Child) “I’m well, thank you.” 
A game of echo in which the teacher calls, “I’m com- 
ing,” or sings, “Throw the ball,” is excellent. The teacher 
gives the call and the child echoes. 
  
  
  “I am coming,” “Throw the ball.” 
The greatest of care should be exercised in the selec- 
tion of the rote song. It should be rhythmic and melod- 
ious, not too low or too high, and the word-cgntent should 
be interesting and within the child’s experience. The 
opportunities offered by nature study, special days, and 
holidays should be taken advantage of as this will add 
interest and motive to the work. A correlation with 
literature, reading, and social life should give purpose 
and meaning to the work.
-P-A-G-E-288
  288 How to Teach Primary Grades 
COURSE OF STUDY 
This course of study is offered as a suggestion to 
the teacher who has had no musical training. Conse- 
quently it is very simple in form and does not contain 
many of the features which would be in the course of 
study of a trained teacher. 
First, Second, and Third Grades 
I. Tone matching through bird calls, roll call, morn- 
ing greeting, and a game of echo. Continue until prac- 
tically all the class can respond accurately. 
II. Rote songs; improvement in tone and pronun- 
ciation through efforts to express the thought of the song. 
III. Rote songs continued as a basis of further work 
in melody, rhythm, ear training, self-expression, and in- 
terpretation. 
Material for rote songs may be found in any of the 
following books: 
Small Songs for Small Singers, Neidlinger (G. 
Schirmer, New York) ; Children’s Singing Games, Hofer 
(A. Flanagan Co., Chicago); First Year Music, Dann

  cational Music Series, Teacher’s Edition (Ginn & Co.) ; 
The Public School Song Book, Schoen and Gilbreath 
(A. S. Barnes Co., New York). 
METHOD 
As previously suggested, the work in music begins 
with the exercises in tone matching. These exercises 
should be continued until the child is rather proficient 
in his response to any tone. 
Very often a child will be found to be a monotone; 
that is, he does not seem to have the ability to vary his 
tone, and it is pitched on a low key. This child should 
have extra work in tone matching until he learns to place 
his tones properly. In the work with the rote songs, the 
teacher should be careful to avoid calling attention to this 
defect and treat the child exactly as though his tones 
were normal. 
Rhythm may be developed by clapping, marking, or 
beating time as a familiar rote song is sung or played, 
or through the singing game, folk dance, action song, 
or march. 
The child is trained in the ability to think melody by 
having the teacher hum or play a familiar song and then 
allowing him to name it. 
In the work of each grade the emphasis should fall on 
the interpretation and expression of the thought with 
only enough technique to enable the child to read and 
to interpret simple music. 
It is not necessary that the teacher be either a trained 
musician or a good vocalist in order to teach music. 
These are valuable’assets but not indispensable. How- 
ever, an appreciation of good music is an essential qual-
-P-A-G-E-290
  290 How to Teach Primary Grades   
ification for the successful teaching of music. If the 
teacher lacks this, she should strive to awaken and to 
cultivate this power. If this is impossible the probability 
is that she has missed her calling and should not attempt 
to teach the little child. 
Many teachers have successfully taught music without 
either the ability to play or to sing. There are two or 
three ways in which this may be done. First, very suc- 
cessful work may be done by using a phonograph. Any 
good phonograph company should be able to furnish a 
list of records containing a number of appropriate rote 
songs, singing games, and folk dances. Second, the class 
usually has one or more pupils who can lead in the 
"singing. It is an easy matter to find some one who will 
teach these children the songs. Or there will probably 
be a pupil from one of the more advanced grades who 
will be glad to assist in this work. Very often some 
patron or friend of the school will come once or twice 
a week and teach the songs. Where there are other teach- 
ers in the school, a teacher who can sing will often ex- 
change work with the teacher who cannot. Suffice it 
to say, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.” 
Though it is not essential for the teacher to have a 
technical knowledge ofi music or of the voice, it is essen- 
tial that she be able to distinguish between good and bad 
tone production. A child’s voice is naturally very light 
and should be used only in producing a light, soft, sweet 
tone. It will take the utmost vigilance to prevent him 
from using a coarse, harsh, shouting tone in singing. 
Should this continue it will often strain and injure the 
voice beyond repair. Individual work in music should 
be stressed if the child is to develop to the extent of 
his ability.
-P-A-G-E-291
  Music 291 
  LESSON PLANS 
The presentation of the rote song is an important part 
of the work as much depends upon the teacher’s manner 
of developing an interest in it. Since the lesson in music 
is the same type as that in literature, it should be de- 
veloped in a similar manner. Suggestions for these les- 
sons were given in Chapter XIII, pages 164 to 166 and 
pages 173 to 177. The following outline plan for teach- 
ing a song is in keeping with the method used by many 
expert teachers of music. 
1. The word-content is presented to the child in song 
and its meaning developed as a basis for a true inter- 
pretation of the melody. 
2. The teacher sings the song a number of times in 
order that the child may gain a clear conception of it. 
3. The first phrase is then sung by the teacher several 
times, then imitated by the class as a whole and by 
individual children. It is then linked by the teacher 
with the whole song. The second phrase is learned in the 
same way. Then the first and second phrases are sung 
together, and then the teacher finishes the entire song. 
She should continue by phrases, constantly linking them 
together and with the entire song. 
Another method often used in the third step is for the 
teacher to sing the song as a whole allowing the child to 
supply the last syllable or word of each phrase. She 
then allows him to supply two words, etc. Or the teacher 
may sing the entire song and allow the children to sing 
“la; la!” After the tune is familiar he sings the words.

“Let me sing it again and see 
if you think it is a pretty song.” She 
sings the song again. “Did you like 
it? This time as I sing it I want 
Mary to come and pretend that she

the song. “John may come.” The 
teacher continues singing it over a

Let me sing just that phrase. Listen

to sing it two or three times. She 
then calls on individual children.

sings the entire song. “Let me sing 
just that phrase.” The teacher sings 
the phrase. “This time I want you 
to sing it.’ She proceeds as in the 
first phrase. “Let us sing both 
phrases together, then I will finish 
the song.” She proceeds in like man- 
ner until the entire song is learned.

CHAPTER XXII 
SEAT WORK 
AIM 
In the schoolroom of more than one grade or of more 
than one section of a grade, the teacher works with the 
child for only a part of the time. For the remainder of 
the time he must engage in some form of unsupervised 
activity. That he will engage in some form of activity 
is a well-known psychological fact, as nature has en- 
dowed him with an instinct for activity. The teacher’s 
_problem is to supply him with employment which is 
worth while—that in which his mental powers will be 
active and that which will develop habits of independent 
thinking and study, concentrated attention, tenacity of 
‘purpose, and healthy activity. 
SUBJECT-MATTER AND METHOD 
There are many forms of seat work which will prove 
attractive, interesting, and instructive. Probably the most 
valuable of these is some form of handwork such as 
clay modeling, paper folding, cutting and pasting, color- 
work, and drawing. Other forms are colored pegs and 
peg boards, colored sticks, cut-up pictures, interesting 
pictures with words for sentence forming, corn, peas, 
blocks, empty spools, etc. The catalogue of any good 
supply-house will furnish many suggestions for different 
295
-P-A-G-E-296
    
296 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  types of seat-work. Other valuable sources of sugges- 
tions for types of seat-work will be found in educational 
journals, and children’s magazines. 
To give the child a book to study for any length of 
time means asking an impossibility of him, and develops 
habits of listlessness and inattention which will be hard 
to overcome. Assigning written tasks results in cramped 
fingers, incorrect habits of writing, and carelessness. 
That the best results may be secured, seat-work should 
possess the following characteristics: 
1. When possible it should be further development 
or application of some previous lesson, as “I want you 
to tell the story of the reading lesson with the clay.” 
2. It should consist of an unsolved problem which 
is of interest to the child, as “Draw a picture of the 
house of ‘The Three Bears’ just as you think it looked 
and put in the furniture which you think it had in it.” 
After he has solved this problem to his satisfaction, 
there is no problem and very little interest or value in 
continuing to do it. However, this skill may be utilized 
as the means toward the solving of a new problem. For 
instance, “How would you like to tell the story of ‘The 
Three Bears’ by picture? What picture shall we have 
to draw?” Among these pictures will be the house and 
furniture. 
3. It should be of such a nature that it will hold the 
child’s attention and interest until the problem is solved. 
For example, “Did you ever go to a circus? What ani- 
mals did you see? Where were the animals? -How 
would you you like to make a poster showing the ani- 
mals you saw? I have a great number of! magazine pic- 
tures of animals and of tents here. Let us see who 
can make a nice poster. Today we will see how many 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  
Seat Work 297 
animals you can cut out in fifteen minutes.” This will 
probably take a number of seat-work periods to finish. 
The child should be encouraged to bring other pictures 
from home. Outline pictures which have been made on 
the hectograph may be used or he may trace around 
cardboard patterns of animals. 
4. It should not require too long a period of atten- 
tion, as the child does not give attention to one thing 
however interesting for any great length of time. This 
may be illustrated by the above example where only 
fifteen minutes are used in one form of seat-work. Seat- 
work should always be of such a nature that it can be 
entirely finished in the time alloted or that a definite 
part can be finished. Observation and experience will 
soon show the teacher the amount of time which should 
be given to the different forms of seat-work. 
The problem is to select types of seat-work which are 
interesting, attractive, and instructive. Following are 
some suggestions which will fulfill these requirements if 
used wisely and understandingly. When seat-work is 
given the directions should be clear and definite. 
1. Tell the story of the reading lesson by clay model- 
ing. In the story of “The Little Red Hen,” Chapter V, 
pages 58 and 59, the child could mold a grain of wheat, 
a hen, a cat, a rat, a pig, and a loaf of bread, 
2. Tell the story of the reading or language lesson 
by free-hand paper cutting. These are to be made into 
a poster which will tell the story. 
3. Cut and arrange magazine or outline pictures to 
tell the story. 
4. Draw and color pictures which will tell the story. 
5. Tell the story on the sand-table by planning and 
making necessary articles.
-P-A-G-E-298
298 How to: Teach Primary Grades   
6., Illustrate rhymes and poems as in suggestions one, 
two, three, four, and five. : 
7. Illustrate by one of the above forms the part of 
the poem or story which he likes best. 
8. Have the child illustrate with pencil, colored 
crayon, clay, or free-hand cutting something that hap- 
pened on the playground or on the way to school. Sen- 
tences may be written about this event. 
9. Have pictures with words to match and have him 
place the words on the proper picture. 
10. Give him a picture with the list of necessary words 
for telling the story. He should form sentences about 
it with the word card. 
11. Sentence building may be given using cards with 
the written or printed words. Place a model on the 
board or have child use a model from the book. 
12. Give each child a pair of scissors, some paper, 
and a list of name words. Have him cut a free-hand 
picture of the word and place the proper word on this 
picture. 
13. Write a simple question on the board and ask 
the child to answer with drawings or word cards. 
14. Place a simple direction on the board or on a 
card which tells the child to make something; for ex- 
ample, “Cut the picture of a boy and. his kite.” 
15. Give the child a copy of a simple rhyme or story 
and allow him to illustrate. 
16. Give him the copy of a simple rhyme or story 
and words for building this rhyme or story and have 
him build it. 
17. Give him the words. for building a very familiar 
rhyme or story and have him build it without a copy. 
18. Many interesting booklets or scrap-books may be
-P-A-G-E-299
Seat Work 299 
made by the cutting and pasting of magazine pictures 
or outline pictures made from patterns or by the hecto- 
graph. Paste a picture on the outside of the book with 
proper explanatory wording. For example, make a book 
representing the child’s home. Let him find the picture 
of a house which is the most like his own. The word- 
ing “MY HOME” should be just below the picture. 
A page represents a room in the home. He is to cut, 
arrange, and paste the furniture for each room, 
Booklets of pets, circus animals, farm animals, farm 
tools, fall flowers, fall birds, leaves, “How We Are 
Clothed,” “How We Are Fed,” “How We Keep Warm,” 
“How We Ride,” and Noah’s Ark, may be made. 
The child will enjoy furnishing a real doll house made 
of boxes. (For suggestions see Chapter XX, page 280.) 
This may be either a class or an individual problem. 
Spool knitting is an interesting activity. The chain is 
to be utilized in some way. 
One of the teacher’s problems will be to acquire enough 
seat-work material which is worth while without too 
great an outlay of money. If she will secure the inter- 
est of the child in the problem he will bring many things 
which may be utilized, such as newspapers, magazines, 
wrapping paper, string, spools, tablet backs, corn, acorns, 
etc. Often the local printing office will allow the teacher 
to take strips of refuse paper, or she may buy “news 
print” at a reasonable rate. Colored paper may also 
be purchased from the printer. 
Often the teacher can raise money for the purchase of 
materials by a little entertainment. Other suggestions 
as to material and their use will be found in Chapter 
XX, pages 281 to 283. 
The care of this seat-work material is an important 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
  300 How to Teach Primary Grades   
part of the program. If possible, the teacher should 
have a set of shelves, in which is placed the different 
materials in systematic order in boxes which are plainly 
marked on the ends. Monitors may be selected who 
will care for this material in an orderly way. These 
same monitors may attend to the distribution and the 
collection of this material and thus relieve the teacher 
of this mechanical part of the work. 
She should plan for her seat-work periods as care- 
fully as for the regular lessons. Her daily program 
should show exactly what the child is to do for every 
period of the day. Not only should she know what he 
is to do but she should have all the material ready and 
arranged in systematic order so that no unnecessary time 
or energy may be expended. 
All seat-work should be carefully inspected as an en- 
couragement to the child and to prevent the formation 
of habits of carelessness and idleness.

CHAPTER XXIII 
OPENING EXERCISES 
The first few minutes of the morning furnish the 
key-note to the day. The child often comes to school 
cross and irritable due to any one of many possible 
causes. It may be that the breakfast was insufficient, 
poorly selected, or poorly prepared. It may be that 
he has not had a sufficient amount of sleep or that he 
has received a severe though merited reproof from his 
parents. Bodily illness will also often cause irritability. 
Suffice it to say that whatever the cause, it is often 
possible to turn what would otherwise prove the pro- 
verbial “Blue Monday” into a day of joy and happiness 
by a wise use of these first few minutes. 
One of the most important factors in a happy school- 
room is the teacher. It should not be necessary to sug- 
gest to her that a smiling, happy face is perhaps the 
most essential element in the personality of the success- 
ful teacher. Not only should her face be bright and 
happy, but her personal appearance should be as at- 
tractive as possible. This does not mean expensive wear- 
ing apparel, but that which is well selected as to quality, 
color, and style. The hair should be arranged neatly and 
attractively. 
Another important factor is the appearance of the 
room. The teacher should see that it is properly cleaned, 
lighted, heated, and ventilated. She should make it as 
301
-P-A-G-E-302
  
302 How to Teach Primary Grades   
attractive as possible by a wise use of flowers, pictures, 
bookcases, curtains, and the work of the children. She 
should avoid giving the room a cluttered appearance by 
the too promiscuous use of these articles. The table 
or desk should be made attractive with a cloth or scarf 
and a flower vase. 
As each child enters the room he should be greeted 
with a cheerful good-morning (with perhaps an avldi- 
tional word of greeting). If the child arrives before the 
opening hour, he should be given some quiet, though in- 
teresting, form of activity until the opening hour. If he 
is allowed to romp and engage in noisy talking while in 
the schoolroom, it not only makes a bad beginning for 
the day but helps to create a harmful schoolroom atmos- 
phere. 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
The morning exercises may consist of Bible stories, 
Bible verses, psalms, prayer, poems, stories, songs, les- 
sons in ethics, hygiene, and sanitation. 
Bible Stories. Unless there is a state law prohibiting 
the use of the Bible, this should form a regular part of 
the morning exercises. In the primary grades it should 
take the form of Bible stories, simple verses, and psalms. 
These stories may be found in books of Bible stories for 
children. Probably a better source will be the Teacher's 
book for the Beginners and the Primary Department of 
a Graded Sunday School. These are well adapted to the 
understanding of the little child and are simple and 
interesting. In connection with these books, pictures 
which illustrate these stories may be procured. These 
will add much to the interest. These books and pictures

may be bought from the publishing house of any of the 
leading religious denominations. 
Prayer. If not prohibited by a state law, the prayer 
should also form a regular part of the morning exercise. 
Should there be a law prohibiting it, the prayer may be 
used in the form of a song. The following prayer is 
very appropriate for use with the little child: 
“Our Father, we thank Thee for the night, 
And for the morning light, 
For food and rest and tender care, 
And all that makes the world so fair. 
Help us to do the things we should, 
To be to others kind and good. 
In all we do, in all we say in work or play, 
Make us more loving every day—Amen.” 
If the teacher prefers she may use the Lord’s prayer. 
Songs. The singing of a bright, happy song makes a 
good beginning for a day inasmuch as it will often drive 
away the feeling of impatience or worry. It will also help 
the teacher and the children to take up the schoolroom 
activities with a better mental attitude. These songs 
may be either secular or religious in form. For the 
religious songs, help may again be found in the litera- 
ture of the Beginners or Primary Department of a 
Graded Sunday School. These songs are simple, and 
interesting and especially adapted to the comprehension 
of the small child. “Songs for Little Children,” by 
Francis W. Danielson, published by The Pilgrim Press, 
Boston, contains suitable songs both secular and religious 
in content.

  304 How to Teach Primary Grades 
  If a regular music period is provided in the daily 
schedule, the songs taught in this period are utilized in 
the morning exercises. If there is no music period, the 
song should be taught as a part of these exercises. 
Ethics. Little talks, stories, and exercises to help 
establish the social habits of thoughtfulness, helpfulness, 
courtesy, sympathy, truthfulness, etc., may form an im- 
portant part of the morning exercise. These should not 
be “preachy” in character and should be used in a natural, 
interesting way. This should be followed up through the 
day by suggestions and by praise of any action which 
is of this character. Many suggestions for these talks, 
stories, and exercises should be found in primary mag- 
azines of education, children’s magazines, and children’s 
books. 
Hygiene and Sanitation. This morning period offers 
an excellent opportunity for giving the child a knowl- 
edge of the laws of health and of sanitation. These 
may be presented through natural and interesting little 
stories, talks, and exercises. Material for these exercises 
should be found in primary magazines of education, 
physical culture magazines and books on hygiene and 
sanitation. 
Poems and Stories. The morning exercises also offer 
an excellent opportunity for the reciting of the poems 
and the reproduction of the stories learned in the litera- 
ture lessons. This furnishes motive for the learning of 
these poems and stories and gives additional practice in 
appearing before an audience. .

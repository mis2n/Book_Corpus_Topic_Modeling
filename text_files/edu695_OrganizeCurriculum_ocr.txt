  PREFACE 
The elementary curriculum has expanded in recent 
years into a huge collection of knowledge and of ac- 
tivities. Nearly all the subjects suitable for children 
and some others have been gathered from all sources 
until both teachers and children are overloaded with 
these bountiful gifts. At present they are staggering 
under the load. 
The last thirty years has been a period of almost 
reckless expansion of common-school studies into all 
the new and old realms of experience. It may require 
the next thirty years to sift out and to organize these 
accumulated treasures. 
Our problem is that of selecting and combining the 
best and most essential influences into a simple pro- 
gram which will promote the continuous educative 
growth of children through the school period.

     CHAPTER I 
HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS OF THE 
CURRICULUM    
               The aim.— A good reason for reorganizing the 
course of study is the need for bringing our practice in 
education into conformity with our accepted prin- 
ciples. We wish to make it possible for teachers to 
realize the generally accepted aim of instruction. We 
desire to lead the children into the ways of good citizen- 
ship and into a wise physical and social, or moral, ad- 
justment to the world that surrounds them. The pres- 
ent organization of the curriculum makes it needlessly 
difficult to attain these desirable results. 
It is not our purpose, however, to enter upon a whole- 
sale eriticism of the course of study or of those who 
are responsible for it but to recognize the merits and 
to suggest a remedy for the faults. 
Why revision of the curriculum is needed. — There 
are special reasons why the time is ripe for a revision 
of the general plan and organization of the elementary 
course of study below the high school. In recent years 
the common-school course has been a center of reform 
movements and has been reshaping itself under the

  HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
pressure of numerous powerful influences. These are 
indeed the chief active forces in the modern world, and 
they are claiming the right to mold such a public in- 
stitution as the common school. Surprising and far- 
reaching changes have been the result. A survey of 
these changes and of their effects upon the course of 
study as a whole is first in order. 
The most obvious of these changes is the increase 
in thé number of new studies and in the variety of 
knowledge materials introduced. Year after year new 
studies, as strong claimants for attention, have been 
knocking for admission to the course, supported also 
by able and distinguished advocates. The school, in 
spite of strong conservative influences, has received 
them with open arms as they have come flocking in. 
At no time in the past has the school been deluged with 
such floods of new subject matter. We have also re- 
sorted to a variety of schemes and devices to enable 
teachers to qualify in the new subjects but with only 
partial success. 
The pressure of new studies. — Looking back over 
a period of thirty years we easily can name the more 
prominent of these new claimants for public-school 
favor — nature study, the elements of science (includ- 
ing a wide range of worthy topics), manual training, 
now better known as industrial arts (including con- 
struction activities of several kinds), household arts (as 
many-sided as household needs), health and sanitation 
(closely allied to physical\training, games, sports, etc.), 
home and school gardeniff€ and agriculture, civics and 
direct training for citizenship, modern languages 
(French, Spanish, and German), and vocational train-    
-P-A-G-E-11
    
HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 3 
ing along several lines. To these may be added new 
and important increments of subject matter in the 
older studies, as history, geography, literature, and the 
fine arts. Taken in the gross and collectively these 
radical enlargements and changes in a conservative 
institution like the public school are amazing. They 
will match up well with the astonishing changes in 
modern science, in inventions, and in the industries. 
Surprising changes in the schoolroom.—}The re- 
sults are noted in the striking transformations ob- 
served in the classroom. | Often in stepping into a 
modern schoolroom we are’taken by surprise and think 
we may have entered the wrong place. It is a work- 
shop with benches in the midst of sawdust and shav- 
ings and unfinished tasks, with machines and tools and 
busy workmen intent upon their noisy trade. Now 
again it is the quiet of a library with absorbed readers 
and stacks of books.. Again it is a kitchen or serving 
room with active, aproned girls preparing a noon 
luncheon, or it may be a lecture hall for history, geog- 
raphy, or literature, with maps, pictures, and appro- 
priate wall decorations, or the children may be making 
careful observations in a historical or geographical 
museum. Later it is an art studio with models and 
drawing furniture and equipment. Out in the open 
is a class of busy boys and girls in the garden, prepar- 
ing the beds or planting. Again it is a broad play- 
ground with field equipment and ball diamond, swings, 
etc., or in a small theater the children in costume are 
presenting ‘‘Hiawatha” or ‘Merchant of Venice” 
with stage effects. Another class is in the science 
laboratory using microscopes as a means of discovery,  
-P-A-G-E-12

or they may be handling test tubes in experimenting. 
An excursion into the woods and fields gives still 
another picture of a classroom enclosing all outdoors. 
In view of these novelties a primitive schoolmaster 
would be in a quandary. Even the methods of class- 
room management and teaching have been modified 
to conform to these external changes in subject matter 
and problems. 
A genuine enrichment of studies. — There can be 
little doubt that the modern course of study is intended 
to furnish the children with a bountiful feast of knowl- 
edge and with the various activities in which this 
acquired knowledge is allowed to function in practical 
ways. ‘The enrichment that has come into the course 
by the introduction of new branches of knowledge 
and forms of activity and by the enlargement of older 
studies aims at the superior content of these valuable 
subjects. In contrast with the formal, symbolic char- 
acter of the old-fashioned course, the modern expansion _ 
of the curriculum deals with the best practical and 
cultural values and is therefore in its purpose a genuine 
enrichment.» The common school has been absorbing 
and appropriating to its own uses the superior mean- 
ings and values represented by all the important in- 
fluences and movements abroad in the modern world. 
This includes not only the political, social, and scientific 
reforming agencies at present dominant in the world 
but likewise the better influences coming as an in- 
heritance from history and literature, from fine arts 
and religion. 
By reason of its broad hospitality toward all studies 
and social forces the school has become thus the camp-
-P-A-G-E-13
  HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 5 
ing ground where we receive, train, and organize all 
the best forces in our society. The school is the one 
institution that is fully representative of the thoughts, 
the interests, and the activities of our whole nation at 
its best. The fuller meaning of this enrichment of 
elementary studies is not yet clear to many minds, 
because we are still under the traditional conception 
of elementary studies as being mainly formal and 
elementary and, we might add, trivial. But there is 
nothing trivial about this conception of an enriched 
curriculum of common-school studies. Educationally 
at least, if not in other respects, it is the greatest 
achievement of our age. 
How to exploit this enriched course. — The doors 
have been thrown wide open for the admission of all 
the best studies and activities into the elementary 
school, and they are not likely to be closed. Educa- 
tion in the common school has taken on a much larger 
meaning and scope. The schoolmaster is called to a 
great office — to administer this enriched curriculum: 
first, to understand it in its potential values and, 
second, to organize the teaching influences so as to 
exploit these enlarged educational resources. In view 
of the future possibilities of this enriched course of 
study we may be excused for some boasting, but judged 
by achieved results we should need to be more modest 
in our claims regarding this actual enrichment. How to 
put these materials to the best use is the great problem. 
A real impoverishment. — While we have been con- 
gratulating ourselves on the enlargement of the course 
with new studies and because of this modern reénforce- 
ment of strong thought materials from science and
-P-A-G-E-14
6 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
  literature and art, in very fact the school course as a 
whole shows unmistakable signs of a growing impover- 
ishment. The important studies have become lean 
and barren, stripped largely of their better thought 
values. This is not the first time that educators have 
achieved results the exact opposite of what they had 
intended. 
The course of study reduced to a table of contents. — 
The reasons for this, however, are easily given. We 
have now in the schools a troublesome multiplicity of 
studies. As we go on increasing the number of studies 
and topics, the time spent on each subject must be 
decreased. With twice as many studies on the docket 
each can receive only half as much time. In a com- 
plete up-to-date school we now have about sixteen or 
eighteen studies, twice as many as of old. A seventh 
grade class was reciting in eleven different subjects in 
one day. Five or six lessons a day would be far better. 
This multiplication of studies makes for short and 
scrappy treatment of topics. For important subjects 
the time allowed is wholly inadequate. Because of 
this shortage of time, teachers and textbooks are com- 
pelled to abbreviate and epitomize. {Many of our text- 
books in the middle and upper grades and in the high 
schools show this tendency to shorten and condense 
topics to a remarkable degree. This crowding of many 
studies upon the school program has produced a sketchy 
and superficial method of study. The whole course of 
study tends to become a memorized table of contents 
rather than an interesting and instructive development 
of knowledge. Stated in this form the result is simply 
distressing.
-P-A-G-E-15
  HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 7 
Such a condensed and overcrowded course of study 
breeds a host of evils. It leads both teachers and 
children into a bog where they fail to find sure footing. 
Crowded with this excessive variety of knowledge 
children lose confidence in themselves and look upon 
studies as a bore. They fall into a dull memorizing 
scheme of study that fits the requirements, while think- 
ing and doing and all the higher activities are blighted. 
This fatal effort to condense knowledge actually fosters 
the two most serious blunders that can be made in 
teaching: First, it abolishes concrete illustrations and 
reasoning processes from instruction. Second, it im- 
poses upon children the dry schedules and formularies 
of a sapless knowledge. 
a Impoverishment through condensation. — Our con- 
clusion is that while our course of study has been 
flooded with this excess of riches brought by new gub- 
jects, the outcome is a steady deterioration through 
condensation of textbooks into outlines, summaries, 
and what may be called catalogues of topics; in other 
wwords, impoverishment of studies. The teachers are 
not mainly responsible for this result. All the chief 
forces in society have been busy on this work of load- 
ing up and then contracting the curriculum. The 
teachers and the children alike are the victims of an 
aducational revolution. We have achieved results 
aeither intended nor desired. 
On the one hand, teachers have been trying in a 
ee way to solve the problem by the elimination of 
“messentials, while the children, on the other hand, 
ia a speechless way have been convincing us that there 
is no use stuffing them with any more than they can

hold. After all, the capacity of children should have 
something to do with determining the proper limits of 
a course of study. 
How to simplify and enrich. — One conclusion we 
are compelled to draw is that we are in the presence of 
a difficult and all-embracing educational problem. It 
may be formulated thus: How shall we simplify ¢ 
greatly overexpanded course of study and at the saz 
time preserve the best part of its richness and strengt 
It is a question of the selection and reorganization < 
knowledge materials in the now completed grou 
studies. 
A simple course. — The conservatives demand a 
turn to a simple curriculum, a few studies thoroug! 
mastered. They are still disposed to criticise the 
studies as fads and to call for a return to the sim 
course of our fathers with a few tasks well done. : 
sympathize strongly with this demand for a simple 
rigorous course of study. 
An enriched course. — The progressives on the ot! 
hand demand the full acceptance of the new stu 
because they fit the needs and requirements of moder 
life.) For three hundred years the reformers have bee 
steadily advancing toward this goal. It would be i» 
possible and ridiculous to go back to the old-fashion: 
and obsolete education of our grandfathers. It y 
formal and mechanical; the new studies are practic: i, 
thought-stimulating, and spiritual. They furnish t : 
avenues of thought and culture and activity whit). 
‘gad directly into the modern world. We confess to é 
strong sympathy with this demand for an enriche 
modern course of study. 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 9 
How may these two points of view be combined so 
as to work out a simple and enriched course of study? 
We shall undertake the further discussion of this 
problem in Chapter IT. 
The value of past experience. — Our discussion thus 
far has enabled us to see some of the outstanding merits 
of our present curriculum and to suggest some of its 
faults. We should not fail to recognize the value of 
the vantage ground offered by the present course of 
study with its vast accumulation of experience in 
studies, with its broad plans, and developed graded 
systems. All of our thinking rests back upon this 
foundation of past achievements. Ci Any scheme of re- 
organization must deal almost entirely with these 
knowledge materials already collected and partially 
organized. 
The proper aim has been set up. — Moreoyer the 
aim which is to dominate the education of the future 
has already been set and is now at work reshaping the 
present course) It seems probable also that the main 
principles of class instruction have been determined, 
in accord with which these knowledge materials are . 
to be elaborated and appropriated by children. In 
our educational progress we seem to have reached a 
point which marks the full rounding out of the curri- 
culum to its proper limits of expansion. We know the 
irresistible forces which lie behind this expansive move- 
ment and the complete scope of the democratic aim in 
the education of our people. 
A survey of traditional organization. — Before anal 
gesting any plan for the reorganization of the curriculum 
we must give a careful survey of such organization as 
   
-P-A-G-E-18
    10 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
already prevails in the course. Long-standing tradi- 
tion has built up a form of organization in the older 
studies, and this is the essential basis for the arrange- 
ment of topics in such studies as arithmetic, geography, 
grammar, and history — a traditional organization of 
individual studies. This scheme for the arrangement 
of studies came into vogue long before our modernized 
social aim in education was promulgated. It ante- 
dates our whole modern genetic psychology and was 
based upon supposed principles of learning and teach- 
ing distinctly contrary to the psychological ideas that 
are now dominant among educators and thinkers. As 
a result of this distant traditional origin of our course, 
it has been necessary from time to time to abandon 
certain antiquated and obsolete parts and arrangements 
of this course as in arithmetic, geography, history, and 
language. 
Adult standards set up for children.— There are 
two seemingly valid objections to this old traditional 
order and arrangement of studies: First, the mature 
adult mind, from its own standpoint of complete, 
systematic knowledge, has shaped the course of study 
for children. Standing on his own matured platform 
of well-ordered knowledge the scholarly adult demands 
that the child rise at once to his level and accept his 
system of things. The idea that the child requires 
fifteen years of natural growth to reach that adult 
level is as nothing to this old-time curriculum maker. 
Child and adult are one and the same to him, and this 
is the attitude of the old psychology. Modern psy- 
chology assumes that the child is a very crude develop- 
ing organism and has ahead of him both physically and
-P-A-G-E-19
  
HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 11 
mentally a long evolution before reaching adulthood. 
The old course of study was brutally frank in requiring 
from the child just what an adult needed. Unfortu- 
nately our standard courses in history, geography, and 
arithmetic to-day are equally frank and brutal in 
satisfying adult requirements. We must admit, how- 
ever, that the adult was innocent of any evil purpose. 
He did not realize the mischief he was doing in imposing 
his matured conclusions upon children. Our textbooks 
and our present course of study, with this demand for 
adult science inherited from tradition, lay a heavy 
handicap upon the child’s mental movements. This 
explains why average textbooks are so consistently 
dull. 
The offense against childhood. — The adult, when 
called to account on this score, defends himself by 
saying that he is requiring logical, systematic, scien- 
tific knowledge. So much greater the offense, for the 
child has not reached the logical, systematic, scientific 
stage!JThe materials thus furnished are well-ordered 
condensations of adult knowledge. The child will have 
none of this except under compulsion. Our present 
course of study is a perpetual offense to the child be- 
cause of these condensations and final abstractions of 
the mature mind. Such a plan of studies held to 
consistently through the years of the common school 
is a systematic method of doing an endless amount of 
mischief. It sets the standard for a wrong method in 
classrooms and puts authority and administrative force 
behind it. 
The lonesome isolation of each study. — Such tradi- 
tional organization as we now find in the course is
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
an organization of individual studies, each upon its own 
independent basis. This is the general law to which 
there may be but few exceptions. This unsocial isola- 
tion of each study from others is not accidental but 
intentional. It is based upon an old traditional notion 
of a distinct function to be performed by each study, a 
special kind of mental discipline. Moreover the person 
chosen to arrange this single course in arithmetic or 
geography is selected because he is a specialist in this 
one subject and knows little about others. The notion 
of isolation is thus raised to the rank of a principle and 
has long been a distinct feature of the traditional course 
of study. The practical effect of this has been to » 
emphasize this separateness of individual studies and 
to cut off the natural connections and associations 
among studies. This tendency to disintegrate knowl- 
edge and cut connections has gone still further even 
into individual studies, which are made up more or 
less of miscellaneous groups of individual facts and 
even of alphabetical lists and other outline catalogues 
of so-called important facts. It ends in a sort of final 
dissolution of knowledge into its ultimate elements — 
the facts. And in very truth a(large part of the teach- 
ing done in schools to-day is a memorizing of these 
isolated facts without connection or meaning) This 
is the final negation of the concept — organization. 
It is a distinct and dominant mark of our present 
course. : 
Up to the present time these two notions of adult 
scholarship, or scientific knowledge, and of isolation 
of studies have mainly dominated over the selection 
and arrangment of knowledge materials. Strong op- 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 13 
posing influences have been at work to break up this 
traditional scheme of studies, but the bulwarks of the 
old system still stand intact. The trouble is that no 
constructive principle has yet found general acceptance 
among educators upon which as a basis a reorganiza- 
tion of studies can be built. It is generally admitted 
that we need a closer correlation of studies and a 
stronger continuity of well-organized thought, extend 
ing longitudinally through all studies. Education 
should have a unity of purpose throughout and a 
steady, uninterrupted growth and organization of ex- 
perience through the years. These are easy state 
ments of general doctrine, but on what basis can this 
reorganization of studies take place? 
The culture epochs idea seemed to offer some help. 
But it was vague in its implications. Being based 
upon the variable instincts and impulses of children 
in certain roughly defined epochs, it seemed to lack a 
definite intellectual basis. And yet this theory has 
been suggestive of some valuable experiments in edu- 
cation. 
Some thirty years ago a more definite theory of 
concentration of studies based upon Herbart’s doctrine 
of moral education received considerable attention but 
was never worked out in this country into any full 
course of study. It has gradually dropped out of 
sight. 
A continuous accumulation of unsolved problems. — 
Educators have been very busy of late with other 
problems. During the last twenty-five years teachers 
have had their attention largely monopolized with the 
new studies that have been flocking in. They have
-P-A-G-E-22
    14 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
been so busy examining and discussing the new studies 
and trying to determine their credentials that they 
have relatively neglected the old studies and the larger 
problem of organizing the whole. It is difficult to 
determine the real educative value of new subjects 
and their proper relation to the older curriculum. The 
new subjects have added to the bulk of studies but 
have not been incorporated into any unified plan for 
the whole. In fact with these constant additions of 
new subjects, widely variant in content and value, 
backed by the above named principle of isolation, we 
have been piling up a bulky, miscellaneous collection 
of isolated, unordered studies which constitute a very 
serious and even threatening problem. 
From this brief review it is clear that organization 
in the larger sense, that is, the proper selection, group- 
ing, and interrelation of all subjects in the entire study 
movement through the grades, requiring codperation 
of all forces toward one end, has scarcely been con- 
ceived as a problem. To talk of accomplishments in 
this field is therefore out of the question. Teachers 
have been at work on the separate minor problems in 
nature study or spelling or geography, etc., without any 
clear conception of a guiding principle for the whole. 
No great organizer has appeared. — Although this 
problem is of such vast importance, it has not yet 
received the attention of any great organizer. Philoso- 
phers have dabbled in general theories about it, but 
no one has seriously attacked or even considered attack- 
ing this problem as a whole. Indeed, it is such an 
enormously big and complicated subject demanding 
ripe experience and broad, many-sided study that no
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 15 
one has been so presumptuous as to assume the right 
of measuring his powers upon it. 
We have had a generation of notable railroad and 
big-business organizers. Banking and trade organiza- 
tions have been projected on a vast, world-embracing 
scope. But this scheme of organizing the best edu- 
cative materials gathered from all the old and new 
studies into a wise, progressive, unified plan stretching 
through and dominating the whole assemblage of 
studies has never had a champion. No group of 
educational specialists has united upon any common 
plan for parceling out the particular phases of this 
great problem. It offers, indeed, a new field of speciali- 
zation on the largest scale, and one worthy of the most 
aspiring and ambitious talent. What we usually call 
specialization individualizes the smaller departments 
of knowledge. What this problem requires is a new 
kind of specialization in the broader comprehensive 
relationships among studies embracing the entire course 
of study. 
The old traditional studies are now organized upon 
an antiquated plan on the basis of a logical adult 
method and upon a sharp isolation of subjects — both 
ideas which are out of all harmony with our modern 
progressive social movement in education. The new 
studies have made very little progress toward organiza- 
tion. In these new fields teachers are groping about in 
uncertainty. 
No sound basis for present grading of studies. — In 
spite of these untoward circumstances we have been 
busy working out a complete graded system and have 
assumed the right.to dictate with precision just what 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
  to do in each grade and even in each month and day 
of the year. We certainly need a well-ordered, flexible 
grading of school problems. But no system of grading 
is any better than the broad plan or lack of plan for 
organization that lies back of it. A grading system 
based on the present miscellaneous assemblage of 
studies is little better than a game of chance with 
blind leadership. Our graded system, therefore, is well 
stocked up with all the faults and errors which belong 
to our present haphazard yet arbitrary arrangement 
and disarrangement of studies. 
A disturbed transition period. — It is not our pur- 
pose to give way to unfriendly and unbridled criticism 
but rather to explain these faults as the natural and 
inevitable marks of a difficult historical transition 
period through which we are now passing. The 
natural growth of our school system in close touch 
with a powerfully and rapidly developing civilization 
which it is trying to imitate and reproduce within 
itself has brought on a crisis. This straining effort of 
a vast, conservative institution like the American com- 
mon school to constantly reshape itself into the spirit 
and methods of our rankly expanding democracy is a 
spectacle to behold. It is not strange that the schools 
have not kept up with these rapid changes. If the 
school could organize its resources to good advantage, 
if it could combine wisely the progressive and con- 
servative spirit, it would do more than any other 
influence to maintain sanity and balance in the politi- 
eal, social, and industrial storms which threaten the 
public welfare. 
We can well afford then to enter boldly upon a 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 17 
thorough study of the faults and merits of our school 
system and to seek for the best organization of all its 
activities under a wise, comprehensive, and far-seeing 
plan. 
The common school is unlimited in its intellectual 
and cultural values. — The elementary school, as noted 
before, has come into a great and valuable inheritance. 
The world’s best knowledge and experience have been 
made accessible to the common school. Nothing is 
too good for the children. The most democratic insti- 
tution in the world has become the chief center for 
refinement and utility and scholarship, put to the 
best uses. In other words our curriculum has out- 
grown its old narrow, formal limits. It has molted 
and come forth into a higher life. It is thoroughly 
respectable from the standpoint of many-sided and 
superior scholarship. Just as great a career is offered 
a first-class teacher in primary and intermediate 
grades as in a university department. These surpris- 
ing phenomena of the higher life and activity, of aggres- 
sive learning and dcing, have become every day, com- 
monplace experiences in the elementary school. 
_..EFhe resources and possibilities of the school have 
_been- vastly increased by this recent enlargement of 
studies, this opening of the doors to the productive 
fields of thought and action. The resultant conges- 
tion of studies and confusion of knowledge is simply 
a new problem and must be wisely met by a compre- 
hensive plan of reorganization. Before leaving this 
topic we must bring out still more clearly the demerits 
of the present curriculum, which must be dealt with 
in this reconstruction process.

  18 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
A growing confusion. — In the first place the ati 
effect of the inroad of new studies is to produce more 
or less disturbance and confusion, to break up such 
settled uniformities as existed in the old program of 
studies, and to intersperse a variety of new materials 
somewhat shifting and irregular. The process of learn- 
ing, with such a multitude of topics coming and going 
in this jumble of studies, becomes irregular and kaleido- 
scopic. It is too multifarious in its elements. It 
becomes bizarre and freakish in the variability of its 
materials. It resembles at times a curiosity shop with 
its collection of odds and ends. It is a mixed com- 
bination of things big and little, coarse and fine. In 
its ensemble it is confusing. It lacks simplicity. 
Our artist friends tell us that in the case of interior 
decoration a house or room is artistic which has a few 
decorations combined into simple unity with a prevail- 
ing tone or idea. On the contrary when the walls are 
cluttered with a profusion of pictures and the room 
with a stunning show of furniture and bric-a-brac, its 
manifest simplicity and artistic unity vanish. The 
marked tendency of our course in recent years is 
toward an increasing and embarrassing complexity of 
studies. There is a continuous branching and re- 
branching until a summary of the recent history of our 
curriculum resembles a complex genealogical table. 
Such a mixed and miscellaneous collection of knowledge 
is necessarily distracting and confusing to the children. 
The diffusion of attention over such a wide range of 
short topics, with the consequent lack of emphasis on 
essentials, breaks up orderly thinking and cultivates 
even a fluttering and inconstant habit of thought.
-P-A-G-E-27
  HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 19 
Such results throw discredit upon the new studies and 
upon the whole modern scheme of expanding the 
curriculum. 
Shifting phases in nature study. — The unstable and 
fluctuating quality of the new studies is well illustrated 
by the recent history of changes in nature study or 
elementary science. Twenty-five or thirty years ago 
a wave of enthusiasm spread among the schools over 
science and nature studies. Since then this problem 
has been constantly before us. From year to year 
teachers have shown a lively interest in its various 
shifting phases. For a time outdoor nature study in 
field, forest, and roadside was in high favor; then it 
was indoor experiment in the laboratory with physical 
and chemical apparatus; or it became weather study 
of sun and rain and winds and the use of thermometer 
and barometer; or it turned to health, hygiene, and 
sanitation; then came the school garden and agricul- 
ture; later the application of science to inventions and 
to material pursuits, soils and fertilizers, steam engines 
and motors, water powers, filtration plants, etc., came 
into vogue. Even geological excursions were taken 
with a study of rock forms and of the origin of coal, 
petroleum, etc. Science is such a vast and varied field 
that these perambulations in ever-new fields may con- 
tinue for some time longer. Out of all this wealth and 
confusion of experience in science studies, who would 
now be bold enough to gather up results and lay 
down a simple, fundamental course in elementary 
science? 
Facts on the throne; ideas in the gutter. — In the 
second place factual knowledge has come to ascend-

  20 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
ency in our program of school work. Do you know 
the name of the capital of Van Dieman’s land and of 
a crossroads town in Ohio? Have you memorized the 
list of words spelled with ez or those with ie? Can you 
repeat the names of rivers of northern Siberia? How 
many facts can you retail on a written examination 
with a time limit? Have you memorized the hundred 
important dates in American history and the names 
of the capes distributed along the coast of South 
America? Give the states that border on Armenia 
and the list of the signs of the Zodiac. Some hard- 
headed people think that facts are the swmmum bonum 
of an educational course. Facts are indeed necessary 
in every topic of study, but a mere enumeration of 
facts furnishes an astonishingly trivial and trifling 
outcome to a child’s studious labors. / Next to moral 
perversity one of the worst faults is ‘this cramming 
of mere shallow facts. ) No matter how foolish, our 
present course of study and our prevailing method 
of teaching are built mainly upon this bare, unredeem- 
ing knowledge of facts. (Many of us would be surprised, 
at this point, to look in upon the average school and 
take note of what is going on — the droning reiteration 
of mere dead facts. )In such a plan of studies ideas 
drop completely into the background. 
The false worship of facts. — This result, curiously, 
is due in part, as noted above, to our honest efforts to 
expand and enrich the course of study. This process 
of expansion, of multiplying studies, is also a process 
of contraction of each individual study, a necessary 
reduction of each study to its lowest elements — the 
facts. A fact stripped of its connections and bearings     
-P-A-G-E-29
   
      21    HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 
is like Robinson Crusoe upon his lonely island —a 
mere stranded waif. 
This emphasis of bare, lonesome facts as the main 
constituent of a curriculum sets up a standard of dull, 
lifeless materialism in teaching which is not only dis- 
couraging but unbearable. We can not subscribe to 
any such platform of studies. The term ‘material- 
ism” is not strong enough to express the depressing 
effects of this kind of study course. The material 
objects about us in nature, the soil, the trees, even 
wood and stone, are embodiments of the forces operat- 
ing in nature, but these dead factual materials in our 
course are deader than a doornail. A doornail is a very 
useful thing, but a dead meaningless fact is a pure 
aggravation. We must find for the children some 
means of escape from the tyranny of oppressive fac- 
tual knowledge. 
In the third place the knowledge gained through our 
present methods has a fixed, static quality which is 
strangely out of harmony with our modern conceptj 
of growth and progress. Our modern psychology i 
discussion of thought movements based on curr 
of energy passing over nerve tracts. It is a proces 
growth and modification in habits. The child is 
growing, changing organism, and even the habiti 
formed must be flexible and adjustable. 
Knowledge petrified. — In strange contrast to this 
notion of change and flexibility of thinking, our present 
course of study is usually looked upon as a fixed 
quantity of knowledge stuff, a definite amount of raw 
material that has’ been measured and weighed and 
parceled out. We have a number of terms in com-

   22 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
   mon use which naively express this universal habit of 
thinking knowledge as fixed and quantitative. We ask 
children to learn a list of the fifty most important 
cities of the United States. We speak of getting over 
so much ground in a month or a term or a year. We 
have finished our course in history or biology. We ask 
for the minimum essentials in grammar, e.g. just how 
many and what irregular verbs and homonyms to 
study. We desire to know just what and how much of 
each topic is required and whether or not we need to 
leave out the paragraphs in fine print. 
This whole quantitative attitude toward knowledge 
is an offense against good thinking and against human 
nature, a slap in the face for intelligence and ration- 
ality. Thinking, judging, reasoning, and appreciation 
are not quantitative and can not be measured by such 
crude, material, absurd standards. There is a static 
element as a basis for knowledge because the mind 
must have something solid to step on, but all thinking 
rogressive, dynamic — and thinking is the essential

ching and learning alike dull and unprofitable. All

has no relation to life and activity in the outer world 
Necause there everything is in motion. Projects are 
in the process of being worked out. 
The terms “factual” and “static” express two aspects 
of the same dull materialism in education. In com- 
bination they have fixed upon the school a depressing 
routine of studies that it is difficult to break up. True 
knowledge has in it a vital force that is, in contrast, 
essentially progressive and dynamic.

HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS 23 
No centering upon social values. — In the fourth 
place as a sort of outcome to these deficiencies in.the 
present course of study there is too much evidence of 
a serious defect in moral and social values. The strong 
tendency toward isolation of studies would break the 
backbone of any scheme to unify studies in the direc- 
ion of a controlling social or moral aim. Marked 
isolation of studies is in itself a disintegrating, unsocial 
influence. But even in social studies like history and 
literature there is little or no effort to concentrate 
upon social problems. In industrial geography and 
applied science, where social projects are present and 
abundant and in just the suitable form, no effort is 
made to exploit such projects. Any true organization 
consists in finding the strategic centers of knowledge 
and then in focusing all studies more or less upon these 
centers. If the social aim is to dominate the curricu- 
lum, social ideas and activities of a superior, domi- 
nant quality must be found in the leading studies and ; 
made the central basis of organization. Little or, 
nothing of this sort is discernible in our prevailing 
curriculum. If teachers aim at social results, it is 
not through organization of subjects around such social 
thought centers in the curriculum. The miscellaneous, 
factual, static materials of our present course are no 
guarantees whatever of moral or social influence. They 
are the opposite. 
The results. — In concluding our strictures upon the 
present curriculum we note that such a plan of stud- 
ies is systematically wasteful. It wears out the men- 
tal machinery by excessive friction. It dampens the 
ardor for knowledge. It produces a dull routine of

studies and yields a product of poorly organized or 
disorganized knowledge and faulty habits of thought. 
The problem of reorganization. — In spite of these 
faults, and they are serious enough, our course of 
study has in it the vital elements of growing strength. 
It is directed to the right subject matter but withou 
proper organization and enrichment through good m- 
terials close at hand. The full measure of its ri 
possibilities has been occasionally demonstrated and . 
daily becoming more apparent. The healthful strength 
and vigor of our school system are great enough to 
throw off the evil effects we have described. The 
tendencies toward a rational, progressive organization 
is Jof school activities have leew showing themselves 
clearly in many places. The great period of expansion 
85f school studies, now completed, has delivered into suc 
It our hands an abundance of good materials out of which 
to construct a better course of study. It remains to 
, be seen what amount of foresight and wisdom we can 
_ bring to bear upon this problem of reorganizing the 
course of study upon a more comprehensive and effi- 
cient plan.

  CHAPTER II 
A POSITIVE BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION 
OF STUDIES 
Organization in relation to the child’s mode of 
thought. — The reasons pressing and almost forcing us 
to reorganize studies and activities have been sug- 
gested in the first chapter. We are now led to in- 
quire, ‘“‘What-is meant by organization and how is it 
achieved?” COrganization will need to be considered 
in several of its aspects, i 
hat we now have chiefly in mind is that which shapes 
Mill in tha child's own thinking ail in hie developing habits of thought as he receives and appropriates knowl- 
edge for his own uses in the natural process of growth. 
It should not be merely a foreign, external scheme im- 
posed upon the child by authority. At the same time 
the child’s own processes of thinking should conform 
to and interpret the orderly arrangement of things in 
the world of nature and of society. Otherwise he can 
not live and prosper in this kind of world. To bring 
about this close conjunction of the child’s native way 
of thinking with the ordered or conventionalized system 
of things in the outside world is a demand from which 
there seems to be no escape. This demand for adjust- 
ment between the child and the world lies at the roots 
of the educational problem and must somehow find a 
solution. (The true organization of studies, therefore, 
26
-P-A-G-E-35
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 27 
is that which presents the best elements of this world 
order in such a way as to stimulate the natural devel- 
opment of proper activities in children. 
We are willing to accept the aim of education as 
already determined; namely, the growing of children 
into full citizenship, or the complete development of 
the child with proper adjustment to physical and social 
environment. We are prepared also to accept the 
present school studies, in the main, as indicating the 
| scope of educative material required for attaining this 
aim, /Our main problem then is to find and work out 
an effective organization of these studies on a sound 
teaching basis, looking steadily toward the achieve- 
ment of this principal aim. 
Organization means simplification.— Out of the 
mazes of our present complicated course of study, 
organization is the road that leads to simplification. 
When a lot of objects are thrown into confusion, we 
call for organization to set them to rights and to bring 
them under easy control, as a heap of books to be 
‘classified or miscellaneous papers to be arranged and 
filed. The influx of miscellaneous studies has produced 
a general congestion and mix-up which calls for simpli- 
fication. The only possible antidote to miscellaneous- 
ness and confusion in our present overcrowded cur- 
riculum is organization on some simple basis. Just at 
this point where our education has been showing a 
marked tendency to spread out in all directions over 
the limitless flats of knowledge, we hear a sharp call 
to reorganize studies on some largéand simple plan. 
This relief from prolixity and confusion is demanded 
in the interest of teachers and of children, to say
-P-A-G-E-36
28. HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
nothing of educational efficiency for general social pur- 
poses. 
Organization is an emphasis of thought relations 
between facts. — In a simple, downright sense organi- 
zation is an emphasis of the thought relations that bind 
together the different parts of knowledge and group 
them into larger wholes and into ultimate unity. With- 
out these connections, the materials of knowledge be- 
come a rope of sand, a mere confused wreckage. The 
simplest processes in life illustrate this necessity for 
tying things together. We can not build a table with- 
out joints, or a house without structural bonds, or a 
brick wall without mortar. And yet, strange to say, 
a large part of the information in our present course is 
isolated and disconnected and almost lacking in those 
simple thought relations which give a common mean- 
ing and value to large groups of facts. This is surely 
one of the absurdities in our present plan or lack of 
plan in studies. In this respect our curriculum is in 
the primitive stage of those prehistoric races that built 
stone walls without binding cement. There is no more 
fundamental doctrine among psychologists and think- 
ers than the truth that thought relations between facts 
constitute the essence of knowledge. And yet it is 
common practice in our schools to encourage children 
to memorize batches and catalogues of disconnected 
facts. Indeed, we often pride ourselves on such » 
exercises. 
. (The search for thought centers. — It is the essence 
Z of organization to establish also strong centers as well 
as extended continuity of thought relations. Organi- 
zation is a purely reasoned-out thought process con-
-P-A-G-E-37
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES | 29 
necting the parts of knowledge together and is, there- 
fore, strongest at the important thought centers where 
knowledge is rich and deep} There seems to be no 
good way of organizing except by getting at thought 
centers, and without organization these natural, fruitful 
centers of thought become the very worst centers of 
confusion; just as traffic at the most crowded street 
corners, if unregulated, becomes most confused. The 
remarkable enrichment of our curriculum in recent 
years, without corresponding organization, has brought 
on at many points just this kind of confusion, and the 
greater the enrichment of studies the greater the con- 
fusion. We have already begun the sifting-out pro- 
cess — the search for the real centers of organization. 
As fast as these rallying points come into clear view, 
we should shift our efforts to them as mobilizing 
centers. It is a large enterprise, but it expresses and 
brings into one central problem the school need of our 
time. 
The old formal outline of studies is now obsolete. — 
The past still has its firm grip upon the school system 
and binds us to a scheme of isolated, broken, and 
fragmentary studies, which satisfied the conditions of a 
former age. We are now in the very act of outgrowing 
this cumbersome system. We shall not escape from 
the old shell without a strenuous and wrenching pro- 
cess. The schools have been holding on tenaciously 
to the formal classifications and outlines of an obso- 
lete system of grouping. The traditional tendency to 
classify and condense knowledge with its depressing 
effect has laid violent hands even upon the new content 
studies, stripped them of their best content, and left
-P-A-G-E-38
    30 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
them little better than skeletons. Such outlines, by 
whatever respectable names they may be called, are 
little better than dried mummies and ought to be pre- 
served in a museum, not in a course of study. They 
are like the empty shells cast up by the waves, from 
which life has long since departed. But the energetic 
life principle found in all great studies is after all the 
chief thing. It is the sentient element, the soul of good 
instruction. We can not afford to expel this good 
spirit, this animating intelligence, from the course of 
study. Our epitomized curriculum is like a sucked 
orange. It is easy to answer by saying, ‘Enlarge and 
fill out this outline.” The rebuttal, however, to this 
statement is complete and overwhelming; namely, 
“Teachers have neither time nor materials with which 
to fill out this far too extensive outline.” 
This adult frame-up of studies not suitable for chil- 
dren. — We have then a kind of organization in the 
older studies, a left-over from the past, which still holds 
its place and dominates the school curriculum through 
the powerful influence of long-established tradition and 
routine. It is what was mentioned in Chapter I as 
the logical order of the mature scholarly mind. It is 
admittedly wrong because it frames up the course of 
study artificially out of the matured classifications 
which are the peculiar products of the adult trained 
mind. It ignores the fact that children are yet to be 
educated and do not begin where their fathers left 
off at the latter end of a full course in education. They 
must begin at its crude starting point, where children 
have little regard or capacity for the wise proverbs 
and scientific generalities of their elders. It has taken
-P-A-G-E-39
  BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 31 
the adult world an inordinately long time to find out 
that this stilted, Pharisaical wisdom of adult thinkers, 
in form and content, is the essence of foolishness to 
children. In fact, while this conclusion is generally 
accepted by educational experts as based on sound 
general theory, it has not yet produced any consider- 
able change in the traditional curriculum. 
The pursuit of knowledge should be a codperative 
companionship. n i é"attatk upon school 
studies, teachers should reflect not only upon the 
natural organizations of the school subjects, but they 
should also survey the whole field of knowledge from 
the standpoint of children in their first wondering 
approaches to the different subjects. Teachers should 
learn in humility and wise adjustment to climb the 
hill of knowledge with children instead of coldly dictat- 
ing to them the final matured results of their own pre- 
vious explorations.) This does not imply that children 
should be left without guidance, the teacher tagging 
along behind, as it were, and allowing the children to 
stumble into all sorts of brambles and swamps until 
they become totally bewildered. Clearly defined aims 
and objectives should be kept before children as guid- 
ing landmarks, and they should come out from time 
to time into an open space with a clear and intelligent 
view of their surroundings. (Teaching is a fine, 
codperative effort between teacher and pupils in the 
forward-march. into knowledge: Otherwise we could 
get along without teachers and Courses of study. De 
Soto’s almost helpless wandering through the Southern 
States in a vain search for gold is not a good example 
for children to follow in their studies. There was too x

little of intelligent guidance. Daniel Boone in his old 
age was asked whether he ever got lost in his lonely 
wanderings in the vast forests and canebrakes of the 
West. ‘Well, no,” he replied, “not exactly lost, but 
once for three days I was much bewildered.” The 
danger of the badly arranged and poorly handled 
course of study is that children may be kept in a 
state of bewilderment. 
A direct attack upon the curriculum changed to a 
flank movement. — Educators naturally hesitate and 
call a halt before this extraordinary problem of re- 
organizing the curriculum on a new and larger plan. 
In the growth of big cities large, expensive six-story 
buildings have to be torn down to make room for much 
larger structures. Our present course of study is one 
of these expensive old buildings, and we hesitate’ to 
lay hands upon it. Instead of directly attacking this 
problem of reconstructing the course on a larger plan 
and on a positive basis of organization around impor- 
tant thought centers, some of our leaders have at- 
tempted a flank movement. They have turned aside 
to a largely negative effort to determine the essentials 
by a process of elimination. This interesting and 
profitable experiment has been going on for ten or 
twelve years, and we can now estimate the results. 
Trivial and obsolete topics and mere facts have been 
dropped out. Such elimination of nonessentials is well 
worthy of full consideration. In arithmetic, language, 
and spelling, valuable reductions in subject matter 
have been made. More recently the standards estab- 
lished by the tests and measurements have drawn the 
lines of elimination still more sharply around the chief
-P-A-G-E-41
  BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 33 
formal studies, including also early reading. Thus far 
this revision of the course by elimination has been 
limited chiefly to the formal studies, but it is now 
making some inroads into history and geography and 
other content studies. 
This movement to eliminate nonessentials and to 
reduce the course to what is now commonly called 
‘minimum essentials” has done great service and will 
yet add much to its credit. As this movement goes on, 
it will help to expose more and more the grinning 
skeleton that now stands in the center of our curric- 
ulum. 
Elimination has not removed the congestion in 
studies. — In spite of its achievements this movement 
toward elimination has left us with an awkwardly 
overgrown course of study. Other powerful influences 
have more than counteracted the benefits of elimina- 
tion. Because of strong conservative influences which 
have kept the old studies largely intact, the excessive 
quantity of this older knowledge has not been ade- 
quately reduced while the quantity of fresh material 
in the new studies has been enormously increased. 
Even a much larger reduction in the mere quantity of 
knowledge would not overcome the present congestion 
of studies. A much more radical lopping off of topics 
and a ruthless pruning out of subjects would still 
bring a much desired relief as to quantity, but the 
‘residue would have in it the same old faults, except 
bulkiness, as the present course. The more funda- 
mental faults would remain, such as poor organization, 
feeble thought, and lack of content connections. This 
procedure reminds us of the old medical practice of
-P-A-G-E-42
  34 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
drawing off the excess blood with the idea of getting 
rid of the pestiferous infections of the body. The 
blood left in the body had the same qualities and 
harbored the same evils as before, while the system as 
a whole was weakened. 
Mere quantitative reduction a failure. — This quanti- 
tative reduction of subject matter in studies to minimum 
essentials has also a powerful tendency to end rather 
in a collection of dry abstractions, and these properly 
joined together furnish us with the “grinning skeleton” 
of a course of study referred to above. We can afford 
to do almost anything to escape from such a tragedy. 
Let us pray that our last end be not like this. Reduc- 
tion through elimination to minimum essentials will 
indeed decrease the quantity of knowledge, but it 
must guard against the greater danger of debasing the 
quality of knowledge. The worst thing about our 
present course of study is the poor quality of its 
educative materials and their plain lack of right 
organization. 
The high quality of thought materials ranks first. — 
In the reorganization of our course of study in a liberal, 
comprehensive sense the high intellectual and moral 
quality of the educative materials takes first rank, 
is indeed the prime consideration. Quantity is not 
merely secondary; it is far down in the scale of values. 
Quantitatively considered, we have enough material 
to make a dozen respectable courses of study. But 
qualitatively we ought to be held to a rigid, persevering 
search for the best, which is not overabundant. Around 
the important centers we plan to organize all that is 
most essential for the purposes of life. Minimum
-P-A-G-E-43
  BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 35 
essentials on the basis of high quality furnish an excellent 
and safe standpoint for the reorganization of studies. 
The debasing influence of the quantitative idea in 
education. — Because-of.the overcrowding of new and 
old studies in recent_years.the-quantitative-idea_has 
largely“dominated all discussions of the curriculum, 
and. the question of quality has played second or third 
fiddle. Superintendents and curriculum makers have 
laid down the law and teachers everywhere have been 
distressed and burdened by quantitative requirements. 
No question has been asked more frequently than this, 
‘How can my children get over so much ground?” 
Indeed this furnishes the motive for all our talk about 
elimination and reorganization. This excessive worry 
and struggle over the quantity of knowledge has been 
thoroughly misleading and has almost blinded our eyes 
to the real nature of our problem and has completely 
debased our thoughts on education. As if education 
were a matter of facts or of information or of any 
sort of stuff that can be measured quantitatively! 
God save the mark! The quality of knowledge stands 
first,) Who has dared to lay unhallowed hands upon 
this sacred thing, this curriculum of studies for all the 
children? Who has ventured to corrupt the public 
mind with this vicious heresy of quantitative knowl- 
edge and dump the whole school system into a pit? 
The whole purpose of the school is to elevate and en- 
lighten, to enrich thought, not to depress. We can 
never be brought to give our consent to this low stand- 
ard for measuring the values of school studies. There 
is no reason why the noble structure of our public 
education should be torn down.  
-P-A-G-E-44
  36 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
A discouraging aspect of the problem. — If we thus 
object to the poor quality of knowledge and reject the 
traditional faulty organization of subjects in our present 
course, where shall we look for something better? We 
would naturally consult the world’s past experiences 
with courses of study and the helpful principles of 
education which this experience has brought to light. 
The experience of the modern nations with elementary 
education is extensive and has many valuable lessons 
to teach. But the present transition period shows such 
an accumulation of problems, such a multiplicity and 
congestion of knowledge materials, new and old, and 
such a wide divergence’ of opinion among educators, 
that even careful students of education have been 
discouraged by the outlook. They are almost per- 
suaded that our theories and our accepted principles 
have failed us in this pinch, 
The Fourteenth Yearbook of the National Society for the 
Study of Education expresses this discouragement as 
follows, ‘‘If it is impossible to discover from educational 
theory fundamental tests for exclusion and inclusion, 
we are driven to the method of determining minimum 
essentials on the basis of the best current practice 
and experimentation which give satisfactory results. 
Those results are satisfactory which meet ade- 
quately the common needs of society. This in the 
main is the method employed in the investigations 
upon which the following reports in the yearbook 
are based.” 
We have sound principles but fail to apply them. — 
This resort to the best practice and to wise experi-

  encouraged and supported. But the abandonment of 
rational theory and of deliberate reflection on the basis 
of accepted principles is hasty and pessimistic. It 
overlooks for the moment our vast educational re- 
sources and achievements in psychology, in history of 
education, and in pedagogy. The root of: the diffi- 
culty lies not in our lack of sound principles but in 
our failure to use intelligently and to apply consistently 
well-recognized principles. 
All things considered, our worst fault in education 
is the almost common tendency to stop short with the 
proclaiming of sound principles, and then altogether to 
neglect practice. Our current practice both in making 
curricula and in teaching is very far behind our best 
theory. 
Our assets are large. — The reorganization of our 
course of study is a problem too serious and compli- 
cated to be clearly stated in a paragraph. While the 
basal idea may be simple, its application to the varied 
activities and studies of the entire school is so broad 
in scope that a whole book can be little more than an 
introduction to the problem. We may now confidently 
assume that we have at hand the principal data upon 
which to try out a solution of this great problem. The 
resources now at our command consist: first, in a 
complete circle of great and essential studies; sec- 
ond, in a fairly adequate knowledge of children and 
their needs; and third, in a body of sound educational 
principles which may serve as guides in laying out 
the plan. 
Present faults of the curriculum stated. —.Experi="~~

-P-A-G-E-46
  38 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
faults in the prevailing course of study. (they may 
be stated again briefly as follows: an overcrowding 
of the course with a bizarre collection of materials from 
all studies, old and new; the traditional isolation of 
studies from one another and from life; a steady 
condensation and withering up of studies into dull 
generalities; a waste of time upon trivial, miscellaneous, 
and obsolete topics; the static, factual, almost meaning- 
less quality of much of the study material; a system 
of wearisome repetitions of the same topics from grade 
to grade; and, broadly, an obsolete plan of organiza- 
tion into separate individual studies. The plan as 
a whole tends toward the formal and schematic in 
contrast to concrete imagery and lively thought. In 
the language of whist, such a course has a hand full of 
small cards of different suits but is very short on aces 
and kings. 
The remedy for these faults is at hand. — We know 
the changes and improvements on the other hand that 
would offset these faults, the chief of which is a radical 
simplification of the course by establishing afew thought 
centers in each of the important studies,), This demands 
a preliminary survey of all studies to determine basal 
thought values. As a result knowledge will organize 
itself into larger teaching units to correspond to the 
trend of these dominant ideas. The establishment 
of a close continuity of thought relations between lary. 
topics from grade to grade is the proper outcome of 
these growing constructive ideas. The necessary over- 
lapping of big units upon other related subjects takes 
care of the problem of correlation. The elimination 
of trivial and obsolete data is the inevitable fate of these

intruders under the law of the survival of the fittest. 
The definite grouping of knowledge around social and 
industrial projects draws all studies into the current of 
life and gives chief emphasis to human interests and 
values. Such a course of study can be constructed | 
only upon a large framework of strong and simple ideas. 
Can a reconstruction of the curriculum be effected in 
such a way as to correct the faults and give opportunity 
to realize the improvements above named? 
Organizing centers. — Every serious assault upon 
this problem of the curriculum rebounds with the same 
questigns, ‘“‘What are the simple centers of organiza- 
tion? at are the consolidation points where the 
superabundant materials of old and new studies may 
be combined into simplicity and strength?” After | 
years of accumulation we have gathered from all sources | 
a full complement of knowledge materials, in fact, an | 
overplus. The one thing lacking is a clear view of the 7 
centers of organization and of their relation to the aim 
of education. | 
A new era demanding a radical reorganization. — 
A new era has dawned upon us in curriculum making. 
The old narrow conception of mechanical drills upon 
sharply isolated studies is wholly inadequate and out- 
of-date.\\ The expanded and multiplex course of study 
‘demands a more comprehensive conception of large 
‘Organization about vital centers and a broader relation- 
ship and codperation among studies. The recent 
introduction of larger, more deliberate thought problems, 
embraced in literary masterpieces and in larger social 
projects from history, geography, and applied science, / 
* has established the demand for deeper, more connected   
 
-P-A-G-E-48

thought movements in study. The opportunity is thus 
given for a new and extensive coéperation among studies 
extending crosswise and lengthwise through the curricu- 
lum. The old narrow, formal order is rapidly passing, 
and a new expanding world order and organization in 
richer fields of knowledge has opened up. Our ideas 
and our principles must expand to the full dimensions 
of this larger compass and grouping of educative ma- 
terials. An illiberal conservatism can no longer hold 
in check this demand for a radical reorganization of 
studies. Lowell says, 
New Occasions teach new duties, Time 
Makes ancient good uncouth, 
They must upward still and onward 
Who would keep abreast of truth. 
Reorganization on the basis of life projects. — This 
swelling increment of new studies, which has already 
had such a transforming influence, has been imposed 
upon the school by powerful and salutary influences 
from without. Such forces are destined to grow 
stronger. The problem is how to combine to best 
advantage the newer and richer content studies with the 
older formal studies. By appropriating to its own 
uses the new life forces and typical projects from the 
active world, the school itself has been growing into a 
worldlikeness. It is becoming more and more a dupli- 
cate of organized life processes and activities. In this 
fact also lies a large part of the solution now proposed 
for our problem of reorganization. 
The Panama Canal shows organization on a life 
basis. — One of the notable demonstrations of organi- 
zation developed on a large scale under life conditions .
-P-A-G-E-49
  
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 41 
was seen in the project for planning and building the 
Panama Canal. On the basis of an extensive accumu- 
lation of necessary practical knowledge, drawn from 
history, geography, and applied science, this vast 
project was systematically planned; a whole army of 
skilled workmen and unskilled laborers brought to- 
gether; machines and materials collected; and all these 
forces combined and organized into a successful execu- 
tion of the project. 
The coéperation of all the parts of a vast machinery 
of construction under a wise overhead control and 
extending through a period of years was necessary. 
This is an illustration of extensive and many-sided 
knowledge and practical experience brought together 
and focused upon a single purpose — the economical 
execution of the Canal project. Essential to this pur- 
pose and its execution was a well-developed plan based 
upon complete and well-applied scientific knowledge. 
Wise and purposeful organization characteristic of 
big business. — This kind of thorough, practical or- 
ganization of knowledge gathered and focused upon a 
purposeful project is characteristic nowadays of big 
business, indeed of all large and successful industrial 
and social enterprises. The extent, variety, and abso- 
lute necessity for such genuine organization may be 
understood from a selective survey of the following 
list of big enterprises:

The New York Times 
The Standard Oil Company 
The University of Illinois 
The Post Office System of the United States

The Macmillan Company

Sears, Roebuck & Co. 
This list could be indefinitely extended, each case 
demonstrating the actual power and the necessity for 
practical, efficient, large organization. 
Such practical organizations are models for teachers 
to study. — In each of these projects we observe not 
only an organization of knowledge but also of human 
agencies and material resources, essential to the execu- 
tion of a comprehensive plan. This is knowledge 
arranged with reference to human and social needs and 
guided by intelligent purpose. It is the immediate 
and vital combination of the theoretical and the prac- 
tical. Perhaps this is the very best kind of organiza- 
tion that the teacher can discover anywhere and take 
up for serious study. Many of the large topics recently 
incorporated into school work have been lifted directly 
out of life with the full impress of life organization still 
upon them; for example, building the Erie Canal, man- 
aging a wheat farm in North Dakota, the production of 
the Pittsburgh steelworks, the activity of the Red 
Cross Society, the power plant at Niagara. These 
projects lie also in the very field of study with which 
the teacher and children are most concerned. This 
business and social world constitutes the children’s  
-P-A-G-E-51
  BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 43 
actual environment and furnishes the very channels 
in which the future activities of these children are to 
be engaged. These business and social problems, as 
worked out in life, are the chief concern of society and 
of the child himself as fast as he grows into his social 
inheritance of experience and of knowledge. 
Practical enterprises are built on strong rational 
thinking. The more we contemplate such life or- 
ganizations, the more we are impressed with the convic- 
tion that simple rational thought is the dominant 
principle of such practical arrangements of knowledge, 
that ideas, as Plato said, are the most powerful realities. 
Every one of these successful projects is the translation 
of some important idea into terms of life activity; and 
so the idea as an energizing principle organizes the 
human and material forces into an agency for human 
welfare. (See Chapter IV.) 
The kind of organization needed in the curriculum. — 
By a consideration of these examples we may find out 
not only what real organization is but perhaps also the 
special kind of organization which teachers may wisely 
choose as a guide in instruction. Organization based 
upon industrial and social ideas, embodied in life pro- 
jects as strategic centers upon which the world’s activi- 
ties are already focused, may furnish a basal principle 
upon which we shall construct a course of study. 
Perhaps this outer world, by means of such system 
and order as it has tested out and found essential in its 
everyday processes, can furnish at the same time both 
the raw materials (the sensory basis of all knowledge) 
and the effective organization of these materials. This 
' might be very helpful to the teacher who has thus far  
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 HOW TO ORGANiZE THE CURRICULUM 
been unsuccessful in finding or in inventing a suitable 
organization. This useful world order, already tested 
out, may prove a great find to the curriculum maker. 
It may be that long-sought point of contact between 
the child’s life and the world life which will combine 
the two into one for teaching purposes. It should be 
the wise intent of those who lay out courses of study 
for the school to take accurate note of these serviceable 
organizations of knowledge already provided and even 
to incorporate them as suitable units of effort into the 
larger plan of education. If the course of study were 
likened to a railway system, these large projects would 
be the principal stations along the trunk line. 
Main features of organization seen in life projects. — 
An analysis of any one of these enterprises which shows 
the grouping of life forces upon the execution of a 
project will bring to notice the following features: 
1. An organizing idea is seen at work as embodied 
in some person or agency. 
2. A collection and grouping of workers is found 
under overhead control whose efforts are di- 
rected toward some central social purpose. 
A full social codperation of all these means and 
instruments in a rational mode of procedure is 
observed looking forward toward a definite 
achievement. 
3. The result is a powerful, active, successful, and 
unified agency for carrying on the world’s work. 
4. The plan of organization wrought into one of these 
business or social enterprises by the force of 
circumstances in a practical life setting gives 
the teacher a strong hint as to correct method.
-P-A-G-E-53
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 45 
The long persistent search for the natural order in 
studies. — What particular suggestion then is the 
teacher to get from these practical projects for his own 
plan and method in organizing study materials? For 
many years the search has been going on for a natural 
order in studies — for the child’s own way of approach 
to world knowledge. Teachers for generations have 
been at work making textbooks on the basis of what 
they conceived to be the proper order in learning. 
Writers on education never tire of delivering theories 
on this subject. In spite of many honest efforts in this 
direction most of the schemes offered prove to be 
artificial rather than natural or spontaneous. The 
school, notwithstanding many excellent qualities and 
many actual improvements in classroom method, still 
has a way of making instruction stilted and formal and 
unnatural. 
Searching in the wrong place. — At this point we 
wish to suggest again that we may have been searching 
in the wrong place for the real pedagogical order in the 
growth and organization of knowledge. We have been 
looking for it in textbooks and in plans originated by 
teachers and writers on education. We may find it 
somewhere else, where intelligent people are at work 
doing things and are not thinking about pedagogy at 
all. In other words we do not become natural by try- 
ing painfully to be natural. We must catch some one 
unawares who is doing things in the natural orderly way. 
And so we shall have to get away from the school- 
master with his cut and dried, artificial, and often arbi- 
trary schemes. We must go out into the world where 
people are working out urgent, absorbing problems.
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
The schoolmaster has made the mistake of thinking 
that he must systematize the world, set it in order, and 
then dole out his system in fragments to the child. 
Such schemes have proved unnatural and arbitrary. 
We must seek elsewhere an organization more natural 
and suitable to children. The unschooled world itself 
in nature and in society is built on a far better plan — 
a plan expressing the world’s well-wrought-out wisdom 
in simple, concrete, and practical ways. These im- 
portant object lessons in applied knowledge already 
organized stand waiting for the child just outside the 
school door. They are fundamental types, exhibiting 
to all in a large open setting the chief labors and doings 
of men in the social or industrial world and in nature’s 
own operations on a large scale. 
The sensory basis of knowledge. — It-has been long 
known-that—we-must-get-over_the fence-into-real life 
to gather the facts and sensory experiences which are 
needed to reénforce the verbal school exercises. For 
three hundred years since Comenius’ time the school 
has been coming closer to the outside world and has been 
more and more drawing into its domain the realistic 
experiences from without. ow at last, to make this 
development complete, we have in the school shops 
and gymnasiums, kitchens and museums, playgrounds 
and outdoor excursions, gardens, school theaters, and 
dancing. The old-fashioned school with its droning 
lessons has been almost lost to sight among these busy 
intelligent activities. 
The organization of knowledge already prepared in 
life. — Are we ready for another great surprise; namely, 
that the natural organization of knowledge for teaching
-P-A-G-E-55
BASIS FOR. ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 47 
purposes which we have been vainly searching for 
among dusty schoolbooks and cobweb theories is already 
prepared for us and is in active operation in the busy 
world just outside of the school? This might be the 
discovery of a real pragmatism in education. 
The schoolmaster then has not been wise enough to 
discover the pedagogical method and approach to 
knowledge, but the people in the active world outside 
of the school, who do not understand the use and mean- 
ing of pedagogical terms, have already worked out the 
problem successfully in their important business, in- 
dustrial, and social enterprises. It is this unconscious 
wisdom of diligent and thoughtful workers in the midst 
of life’s problems dealing successfully with (pedagogical) 
business and social questions that we wish to acquire. 
Example of organization in the railroad business. — 
Practical men and women in life have been at work a 
long time organizing their occupations into effective 
processes, inventing devices and machines for executing 
their work in the best natural order. If you desire to 
understand railroading, work out the history of one of 
the early railroads from its crude beginnings to the 
present. Study the gradual growth, the important 
improvements and expanding organization of a single 
railroad line as it develops into a great system, e.g. the 
Pennsylvania Railroad. Shrewd engineers and traffic 
managers have worked out this problem through its 
natural stages in practice. They have taken into 
account the engineering problems of construction and 
maintenance, the quantity and value of freight and 
passenger traffic, the agricultural, mining, and other 
productive resources of the region they serve, and the  
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
possibilities of growth in wealth and population. Ad- 
justing themselves to these necessary conditions and 
limitations, they have gradually organized the traffic 
business into a plan. Such a railroad type study, 
transferred bodily from life to the schools and worked 
out on this basis of actual historical development and 
present practice, becomes a vital growing process of 
thought for children, a revelation of great economic and 
social forces. 
Shipbuilding and traffic on the Great Lakes. — The 
growth of shipbuilding and of water traffic on the Great 
Lakes has been guided and shaped by prudent, fore- 
seeing business men who took into account the climate 
and physiography of the Great Lake region, its forests 
and mines and agriculture, its central position between 
the productive West and the manufacturing East, and 
the needs of its growing cities. The Lake traffic has de- 
veloped under natural conditions taken into account by 
practical, intelligent business organizers. The school- 
master can afford to give up his artificial method of deal- 
ing with this unit of study in favor of the actually de- 
veloped business process which sagacious business men 
have already worked out through a series of problems 
and have organized into efficiency. 
Numerous examples of necessary and natural or- 
ganization in world affairs. — This is the natural genetic 
way in which modern occupations and large industries 
have developed their processes. Mining enterprises, 
cotton factories, scientific farming and stock raising, 
large mercantile houses, the skilled trades, and basal 
manufacturing processes have all developed on this 
experimental, problem-solving, rational basis in close 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES | 49 
adjustment to life necessities. Our political and social 
institutions have been developing practical projects, 
showing a similar history of rational growth condi- 
tioned by natural and human forces in the world. The 
newspaper business, the telegraph system, the postal 
service, state and municipal governments, hotel man- 
agement, banking business, steamship companies, and 
political organizations — all these and many more are 
projects and institutions growing and expanding under 
intelligent management and subject to the life strain. 
World forces operating through these main channels 
of thought. — If we are ambitious to gain a real under- 
standing of these growing industrial enterprises and 
of social or political organizations, let us trace the main 
stages in their progress and evolution, this vigorous 
struggle for existence and survival which all have been 
passing through. It is by swinging into this current 
of progress and evolution that we find the natural 
process of thought and the real, practical basis for the 
organization of knowledge. For what is knowledge, 
deserving of the name, other than a full understanding 
of the processes and channels of activity through which 
the world forces are operating? The trades and in- 
dustries and the social institutions, seen clearly in their 
development and present activity, are the big, already 
well-organized object lessons for our schools. Our 
present course of studies has torn these big topics to 
pieces and has given us the scraps. 
Projects a good substitute for scrappy knowledge. — 
It may be a simple proposition after all to substitute a 
few of these significant types of efficient organization 
in a real world for the endless small facts and common-
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
place artificialities of our school texts. A few strong, 
aggressive projects well thought out and demonstrated 
are far more expressive of progress in thinking and in 
real knowledge than a host of these pale, disjointed, 
literal facts. A small group of big dominant units of 
organized, pragmatic knowledge will more than take 
the place of this endless array of inoffensive, meaning- 
less formularies. 
Rough encounter with real organization. — Out in 
the world, organizations of experience have been 
wrought out under trying and compulsory situations 
that test their full value and efficiency. If children 
and teachers can press up close against this vital experi- 
ence and reproduce its sharp lessons, they can not fail 
to become stronger thinkers and organizers of thought. 
Our schools are in desperate need of this rough encoun- 
ter with real organization. They have remained aloof 
from the world and have gone to seed in wordy phrases 
and stale generalities. The school has been conning 
these phrases and mumbling these dull facts when it 
should have been engaged in a better business; namely, 
collecting and organizing experience from important 
enterprises. Teachers seem to have been traveling 
along in a narrow enclosed lane with no real outlook 
upon the fields and forests and mountains and human 
occupations that lay close at hand along both sides of 
the road. 
How to find real problems. — We talk much about 
problems and self-activity and resort to all sorts of 
forced and artificial devices to create problem situations 
for children. But if we would plunge freely into world 
affairs, sharp problems would smite us in the face at 
    
-P-A-G-E-59
  BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 51 
every turn. Every farm or dairy is such a problem; 
every shop or factory is another; and every kitchen 
repeats the lesson. The failure of the school to function 
is due to the fact that it runs its course too much apart 
and does not head up anywhere in life, does not feel 
the sharp contact with the results of organized experi- 
ence in a real world. 
The best literature for children produced outside 
of the school. — A second field of knowledge of high 
importance should be named, in which we are compelled 
to go outside of the school and entirely beyond its 
influence to find that pedagogical organization of knowl- 
edge that the teacher has been searching for; namely, 
that peculiar form suitable for children. The choice 
stories, poems, and dramas which are prized so highly 
in the schools were produced wholly outside of the 
schoolroom, in places not frequented by the school- 
master. Whittier, Hawthorne, Cooper, Scott, Dickens, 
Shakespeare, Homer, and the rest have furnished the 
children in the schools with a perennial feast of the good 
things of the spirit. But none of these choice products | 
ever originated in the brain of a schoolmaster or within ~_ 
the walls of a schoolroom. Irving in producing Rip ~ ° 
Van Winkle was not preparing a book for children, //.| 
Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress was @ serious effort. to 
produce a religious book for adults., Even Robinson 
Crusoe was first written in a language and style wholly 
intended for grown people. The fairy tales first col- 
lected and worked over by the Grimm brothers were an 
important literary undertaking by great scholars with 
perhaps little thought of children. The atmosphere 
of the school is not conducive to this kind of produc-
-P-A-G-E-60
52 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
tions. The school, where teachers are wise and sym- 
pathetic, can make good use of these literary products, 
but it can not originate them. It is not close enough 
to life and to nature. 
The works of masters originate in life and express 
life needs. — Great writers have produced their best 
works under the pressure of strong life influences. 
They have dealt with themes that appealed to people 
outside of the schools. Scott wrote his poems and 
novels for the English public; Dickens, likewise. 
Shakespeare’s plays were not even printed but were 
prepared with direct reference to the London stage. 
The works of the masters originate in life. They ex- 
press world ideas that are struggling for utterance in 
the hearts and brains of reflective and inspired thinkers 
and organizers. The writers had no conscious ped- 
agogical hobbies, nor were they thinking of the plans 
and devices of the schoolmaster. And yet it is the 
nature and genius of the master to clothe his thought 
and work out his idea in a style that we schoolmasters, 
in our latter-day wisdom, call pedagogical. Stories 
like Don Quixote, Robin Hood, the Arabian Nights, 
Moses, the Odyssey, Ivanhoe, and the Moor’s Legacy, and 
poems like Lochinvar, Horatius at the Bridge, Paul 
Revere’s Ride, and The Pied Piper of Hamelin have in 
them an inborn quality that fits them in a curious and 
marvelous way for school use, but their origins are 
remote from the schoolhouse and its atmosphere. No 
breath of air from the realm of scientific pedagogy was 
ever wafted across their birthplace. 
The stirring books of history are not textbooks. — 
Again the books of history that have attracted readers
-P-A-G-E-61
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 53 
and aroused thinkers were not textbooks prepared for 
the schools, not even for the higher schools. Parkman, 
Macaulay, and Fiske have been read with enthusiasm 
by thousands of readers. But these books are too life- 
like and pedagogical to be used in schools as texts. 
They are interesting and highly stimulating; they 
possess a natural, unstudied pedagogy. In our standard 
texts we must have something dry and commonplace. 
The textbooks generally used in high schools and gram- 
mar schools have smashed the record for dullness. It 
is a curious fact that John Fiske in his later years wrote 
a grammar-school textbook in American history, and 
it is quite as condensed and dull and depressing as the 
standard texts. When he changed his plan to conform 
with the usual method of standard textbooks, he left 
his pedagogical instincts behind and produced a lifeless 
book in conformity with the schoolmaster’s plans. 
These things suggest that the standard schoolmaster 
is strictly immune from pedagogical ideas and enthu- 
siasms. 
The best science books are not textbooks. — With 
the introduction of nature study and science we ex- 
pected to break away from the traditional routine of 
dull study and employ a natural and animating method. 
Nature study forces us more into the open, into the real 
world, and there we must come in contact with plants 
and trees and insects and larger animals, growing and 
active in their natural environment. To work out the 
life history of an oak tree or butterfly or frog in its 
natural habitat is a genuine and natural study problem. 
It shows the struggle for existence, each plant or animal 
adjusting itself to environment and fighting its way step 
 
-P-A-G-E-62

54 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
by step to maturity. We may easily name a few books 
which have dropped into this natural plan of treatment. 
Dr. Jordan has told the story of the salmon, Enos Mills 
the life history of the thousand year pine, and Bur- 
roughs has given us his “Birds and Bees.’”’ Kindred to 
these are Tyndall’s excursions among the Alps and 
Hugh Miller’s explorations among the rocks and the 
journeys of the great naturalists, as Audubon and 
Darwin. But not any of these are textbooks and some- 
how every effort to reduce science to a standard school 
form and outline of lessons lands us in the very same 
dull formalism so familiar in the older systematized 
studies. 
In recent times natural science has been pushing to 
the front and now plays a leading réle in the controlling 
industries and occupations outside the school. But 
it has been a serious problem, an unending struggle, to 
get these scientific ideas, so powerful in life, incorporated 
into school exercises. Put into school harness, these 
mettlesome ideas seem to lose their fiery spirit and 
become plain work horses, dull and plodding. 
Science finds its true setting and meaning in life. — 
re again we may be compelled to leave the school 
behind and make some excursions out into life to find 
out what science is doing and what is the true method 
of attack in scientific problems, at least in the field of 
applied science. The story of scientific discovery and 
vention and the application of these results to com- 
merce and industry and social life would open up some 
genuine projects and problems. The stirring biogra- 
~ phies of Watt and Stephenson at work on the steam 
engine, of Morse experimenting with the telegraph, of   
-P-A-G-E-63
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 55 
Pasteur in his laboratory working on bacteria in fer- 
ments and applying the results to agriculture and to 
medicine, of Bessemer devising the converter for reduc- 
ing the cost of steel production — these are but illustra- 
tions of scientific projects developed under the stress and 
strain of life’s urgent needs. They point out those 
natural evolutions of thought in close relation to human 
affairs which pedagogy can well appropriate to its own 
betterment. 
Law schools study cases as carried through in the 
courts. — Law schools, having abandoned their old 
formal procedure, are now accustomed to study law by 
cases. Laying their textbooks aside they take up some 
important typical law case and trace out its progress step 
bystep as it was handled in the briefs of opposing counsel. 
This is the full natural history of the case as revealed 
in court practice. This study of actual cases, as worked 
through the courts, has become in law schools the basis 
of method in mastering the theory and practice of law. 
For teaching purposes it is an abandonment of the 
systematic textbook method, except perhaps as a final 
means of summarizing results. It teaches by examples 
drawn from life. 
Agricultural instruction has adopted the method of 
life. — The agricultural schools have adopted a similar 
plan, that is, of duplicating actual field conditions on 
the farm; of testing seeds and soils and crops by field 
cultivation, by working out the life histories of wheat 
and corn and cotton in the open, with soil and drainage 
conditions peculiar to different farms. Even the life 
histories of harmful insects and of useful birds are 
traced through and fully described as to food, habits,
-P-A-G-E-64
56 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
migrations, and adjustments. The agriculturists have 
gone over to the method of life and are getting im- 
portant results. By introducing the school garden 
with its actual problems into the school, we are putting 
children in contact with these necessary processes and 
practical operations of science which furnish the best 
training for gardeners and farmers. 
Industrial and household arts turn to life for prob- 
lems. — The natural method of life in contrast to the 
formal method of the school texts finds one of its con- 
vincing demonstrations in the treatment of industrial 
and household arts. The projects now being worked 
out in the industrial arts are those of the shop and the 
factory. The units of construction are a table to be 
built, a book to be stitched and bound, a rug to be 
woven, the design of a lamp shade or set of bookshelves 
to be thought out and executed according to the better 
norms of art and construction prevalent in these crafts. 
In the household arts likewise a dress is to be designed 
and made, or a typical dinner is to be prepared and 
served along the usual lines of effort and skill em- 
ployed by trained workers in these household matters. 
Teachers should break away from formal methods. 
— All these varied school subjects give unmistakable 
proofs that the school when left to itself shows a strong 
tendency to drop back into a formal and unnatural 
method of teaching, a rigid and isolated routine that 
sets the school distinctly apart from life. Nothing 
less than a powerful jolt is necessary to break the 
rigidity of this formal school system and to set in motion 
the forces that will reorganize studies on a better plan. 
It should be the settled policy of teachers to be self-
-P-A-G-E-65

BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 57 
critical, to break away from the dominance of formal, 
traditional method, to keep in close contact with specific 
technical plans and organization so as to appropriate 
the inherent natural wisdom that has been hammered 
out in experimental life processes. Direct contact with 
life problems is refreshing and vitalizing. Jesus was 
not able to do much in Jerusalem among the schoolmen 
— the formal, theological teachers. True to type, they 
were incurable formalists. He had to get away from 
them, steeped in their formal theologies, and settle 
among working people at Capernaum and live in the 
midst of fishermen’s huts and boats or among the 
throngs of country people on’the roadsides and hill slopes 
of Galilee, and then and there religion began to take root. 
Teachers should go to school to life processes. — 
The school and its methods require constant recon- 
struction from the standpoint of useful, homespun 
experience.{ The teacher above other things needs a 
constant reschooling in the ways of life. He should 
guard against the conceit of formal method) In short 
the secret of the schoolmaster’s art lies not within the 
formularies of static method or in dry systematic the- 
ories but shows itself active in the growing processes 
and pushing enterprises that dominate trade, politics, 
industry, and social life. 
A basis for reconstruction in practical thought proj- 
ects. — We have been looking for a working basis, a 
ground plan, for the reconstruction of our elementary 
curriculum. We need the basal types of activity which 
objectively represent the large world forces in action. 
As ongoing projects they are the tangible expressions 
of the influences which are controlling and organizing  
-P-A-G-E-66
    58 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
our environment. They are surcharged with the best 
quality of organizing thought. They are not rule of 
thumb performances but directed, rational activities 
following progressively the main channels of active 
enterprise in the world. 
» Organization of school studies on a life basis has two 
jCeopets first, the natural grouping of knowledge into a 
__single project for immediate classroom purposes in the 
process of learning; second, the grouping and organiza- 
ion of these large topics connectedly forming a se- 
quence extending through the whole curriculum. 
A large scope to the problem of the curriculum. — 
The argument in favor of this reorganization of studies 
in the curriculum on a life basis has a still larger scope. 
The whole problem of the relationship of the growing 
child to the civilization with which he is environed is 
brought to the front. How shall boys and girls be 
educated from early childhood up so that they may 
come to an effective understanding of this surrounding 
world and also gradually accommodate themselves to its 
requirements? 
The child’s freedom and the world order. — The 
natural process of learning and of mastering one’s 
environment based on these real projects is in fact also 
a process of accommodation to this world order. For 
the child to yield to this established world order and 
to reproduce its processes, working out its problems by 
his own thinking, is the right mental attitude for the 
thinker (whether child or man). This outer world 
assumes the right to impose its behests and its estab- 
lished order upon the child. This obedience to require- 
ment may be called an act of freedom on the part of 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 59 
the child because it is the only pathway by which he 
can gain freedom and control over nature. We are 
told that there should always be a balanced relation 
between freedom and authority. Here we find it. 
The child is to exercise a large amount of freedom 
or self-direction in a world governed by law. If we 
are to reorganize beforehand at all, we must lay 
out the roads over which the children are to travel 
(the curriculum). This suggests that the curriculum 
maker has some positive, authoritative commands to 
give. Where do these commands come from, and 
how do they relate themselves to the child’s own 
free modes of thought? Evidently the child and the 
world need to be brought to a mutual understanding 
and agreement. This touches the heart of our problem 
and suggests that we may find among the regulated 
activities of nature and of social life the common ground 
between freedom and authority where child and world 
can come together and work in harmony. Child and 
world come to terms on the basis of freedom of action 
within the limits set by nature and human institutions. 
But human institutions themselves should be of that 
humane, natural order which harmonizes with his 
activities and interests. The child in turn must make 
up with this world environment which lays down its 
own conditions without regard to his mere whims. 
There is a kind of organized knowledge in the real 
world which the child is bound to respect, to deal with, 
and somehow to get the mastery of. He has a thinking, 
flexible mind with just the resourcefulness necessary 
to adjust himself to this prearranged system and world 
order. 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
Two phases of this problem. — 
_ phases of this relationship” between child and world 
“demand serious consideration: ° First, this—outside, 
__ natural, and human world is.the one important ‘ae 
and the only. one upon which education must work out 
its results. ' From start to finish this external, objective 
world in its varied aspects is the central object of atten- 
tion and of purposeful study. It is the thing to be 
understood, mastered, and utilized. It includes nature 
and man and their mutual reactions, producing what 
we call civilization» This central fact kept clearly in 
mind will teach us to judge wisely the value or defect 
of all our schemes looking toward the main purpose. 
While this fact may be called a truism, it is one of those 
truisms which is once named and then, in the press of 
business, generally forgotten. \Second, the child from 
the start has deep-lying and strong bonds of kinship 
and vital connection with this outer world! The “call 
of the world” in ringing tones is heard by every child. 
He must be about his father’s business and that is first 
of all to get acquainted with this wonderful home, this 
actual, enterprising, doing world. As Whittier said, 
the world is 
“‘A complex Chinese toy 
Fashioned for a barefoot boy.” 
A powerful natural drift carries a child into this outer 
cosmos, just as hearty boys living near the seashore are 
drawn toward a seafaring life. This powerful appeal 
is felt more and more by children as they advance year 
by year toward youth and maturity. Their games and 
small projects worked out in imitation of the occupa- 
tions and sports of their elders are further proofs of this
-P-A-G-E-69
Ee ne et ee 
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 61 
natural trend and aspiration to mix up in the affairs of 
the larger world. | 
The schoolmaster diverts the children away from 
_Ahe world. — One of the main difficulties in making 
/ progress in education is that the schoolmaster often 
“ seems determined to head off this powerful instinct to xX 
mix in world affairs, and he sometimes diverts the 
ghildren into a blind alley where they are drilled in 
/walking up and down to get some sort of discipline. 
/ But the disposition to be doing something in a real 
world, to be working out projects, to be engaged in 
/ active enterprises that have important results, is a 
\ spiritual tie that binds the child to the world in friendly 
\ kinship of feeling and purpose. In laying out a plan of 
\, education we may well search out the natural highways 
‘of thought and experience by which children make 
their entry into this world environment and in course of 
training adjust themselves to its interesting and com- 
pelling requirements. 
The shaping influence of life processes on the school 
course. — The discussion so far is merely an introduc- 
tion to a definite scheme for setting up a series of genuine 
life projects extracted from the outer world and still 
dripping with its elements, and then for placing these 
telling realities on the school program as the main con- 
tent in education. 
This may be called a radical reconstruction of the 
school program under the shaping influence of life pro- 
cesses. Stated in other words it is an effort to shift the 
center of gravity in teaching away from the bookish, 
droning summaries of the schools and place it directly 
in the midst of the most active and thriving centers of f

life. We would see the school take on the spirit, the 
method, and the organization of the active, problem- 
solving workers in a busy world. We want the children 
to forget for the time being that they are in a school — 
so absorbed are they in these pragmatic or life problems. 
This would create in the schools a life corresponding 
to the typical and the best that is going on in the ex- 
ternal world, part and parcel of its make-up and spirit. 
Our plan is to reorganize the curriculum on the basis of 
typical life projects. 
o strong features of. the typical life projects. — 
‘or many years teachers and philosophers alike have 
been exercising their wits on this problem, “How may 
children approach and master this complex world 
mvironment? What are the means and methods of 
etting at this world-machinery, of putting it under 
ensible control so as to turn it to the best uses?” This 
thing which we call the typical life project is assumed 
to be a noteworthy center of organization which has 
two well-marked features: B¥irst, it is an example of 
x the natural genetic development of experience and 
knowledge on a life basis, that is, in strict correspond- 
| ence to the scheme of practical daily affairs. Second, 
| it suits the child’s venturesome and constructive in- 
stincts in his efforts to explore the world and to push his 
own way into the main avenues of experience. 
It is fortunate that the boy’s or girl’s interests and 
active impulses are so easily aroused by the suggestion 
of these enterprising projects because they lead directly 
into those fields of action where the best results have 
been achieved and where future adult interests are sure 
to lie.    
   
   
     
   
-P-A-G-E-71
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 63 
What are these typical projects from which we antic- 
ipate so much? 
Broad scope and variety of typical life projects. — 
Some of these life projects center in important enter- 
prises in the past and may be classed as historical 
although they may expand and overlap into other 
studies. Others are chiefly geographic or scientific, 
and still others spring naturally from the industrial and 
household arts. Being broad in scope and practical 
rather than scholastic, such a project or type study 
reaches freely and broadly into various fields of knowl- 
edge, gathers its materials from many sources, and 
groups them around a practical life center. 
Large historic projects. — History, for example, 
exhibits such large types as the Virginia Plantation in 
the seventeenth century, Boone’s laying out of the 
Wilderness Road leading to the settlement of Kentucky, 
the purchase and exploration of the Louisiana Terri- 
tory, Burgoyne’s invasion for the purpose of cutting off 
the New England Colonies, Hamilton’s project for 
funding the national debt, the survey and construction 
of the first Pacific railway, the framing of the Federal 
Constitution in 1787, putting the first steamboat on the 
Western rivers, the making of the Missouri Compro- 
mise, Samuel Adams’ organizing of the Committees of 
Correspondence, plan and building of the Panama 
Canal. 
It is around such centers of human enterprise that 
the facts and forces of history have organized them- 
selves in their own peculiar way, thus developing some- 
times into historic achievements, into large industrial 
establishments, or into social and political institutions,  
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
such as manufacturing and mining companies, business 
establishments, and city or state governments. 
The Virginia Plantation — a typical historic unit. — 
The Virginia Plantation, for example, was developed in 
the early history of the colony as a suitable scheme for 
distributing the land in large estates among a wealthy 
and aristocratic group. Such aland system gave to this 
group a dominant industrial, social, and political con- 
trol inthecolony. All other interests, such as slavery, 
agriculture, legislation, commerce, and education were 
subordinate to this control. This system became well 
established in Virginia first and spread later in its 
essential features into the Cotton Belt and over the 
rice and sugar plantations of the South. It gradually 
consolidated into a political and social caste system 
which shaped the history of the South and in large part 
that of the whole nation down to 1860 — two hundred 
years. The Virginia Plantation as a topic fully demon- 
strated in its actual historical basis and development 
is what we mean by a typical life project. It may be 
added that this project has been several times tried out 
with success in grammar-school grades. 
Geographic projects. —In geography we may name 
a corresponding partial list of typical life projects, for 
example, the exploiting of a North Dakota wheat farm 
(the Dalrymple farm), the Mussel Shoals power plant 
as a Government or company project, the Salt River 
irrigation project in Arizona, the river and harbor 
improvement at Glasgow, the reconstruction of Vienna 
and Paris as municipal projects, the equipment and 
journey of a caravan across the Sahara Desert, the 
management of a sanitary dairy in Northern Illinois. 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 65 
The North Dakota wheat farm.— The Dalrymple 
wheat farm in North Dakota was an agricultural project 
for buying up seventy-five thousand acres of drowned 
swamp lands in the Red River Valley, and by the use of 
modern machinery in drainage and ditching, in sod 
breaking, in seed sowing, cultivating, and harvesting 
and by marketing on a big scale to achieve a large suc- 
cess. This project involved a variety of difficult 
problems requiring practical intelligence, ability to 
forecast results, and persistent energy. Among these 
problems were climatic and seasonal vicissitudes, the 
selection and testing of suitable seed, the fighting of 
insect pests, the struggle with the railroad companies 
for cheap elevators and shipping privileges, and the 
study of world markets. There was also an expensive 
outlay for machinery and the problem of supplying 
laborers at critical intervals. As a description of 
typical conditions it naturally expands into an inter- 
pretation of the whole northwest wheat belt with 
Minneapolis as its central outlet. Later this northern 
spring wheat belt comes into comparison with the 
winter wheat belt further south in Missouri, southern 
Tllinois, Kansas, etc., and with the wheat-producing 
regions of Oregon and the West with Portland and 
Seattle as trade outlets. It thus expands into a national 
topic. 
Again this topic as a project in wheat production has 
been worked out in the classroom with reasonable 
success. 
Nature study and applied science. — A third series 
of typical life projects may be named in connection 
with nature study and applied science, as:  
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  66 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
How to plan and manage a home garden 
The housing and care of a hive of bees 
A health campaign against typhoid, malaria, ete. 
Watt’s discovery and later improvements of the steam 
engine 
How the frog grows and adapts himself to environment 
Projects for the sanitary improvement of the home 
The construction and use of a lift pump 
A project for making and stocking an aquarium 
The causes and movements of a cyclonic storm 
How the first telegraph was worked out 
The city problem of securing a pure milk supply 
How the coal beds were formed 
The present antituberculosis campaign 
The organization and management of a city hospital 
How to get rid of the house fly 
The laying out and care of a flower garden 
The home garden as a project. — The home garden, 
as an example, consists of a whole series of projects of 
interest to children — in caring for plants, in dealing 
with soil and weather conditions, in protective sprays 
and other devices against insect and animal pests, and 
in the use and care of tools. Other problems deal with 
the selection of seeds, the preservation of vegetables 
after harvesting, and also with marketing and household 
preparation and cooking of vegetables and fruits. The 
school garden furnishes the best possible series of 
connected home problems, requiring wise planning 
and forethought and careful later execution which will 
continue through the season. 
The cyclonic storm. — Again, the cyclonic storm is 
one of nature’s own projects, worked out on a typical 
plan and on a grand scale for combining the weather- 
producing forces into a system explainable on the basis 
   
-P-A-G-E-75
  BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 67 
of scientific knowledge. The complete mastery of this 
typical process by experts has enabled them to forecast 
important weather conditions several days in advance 
to the very great advantage of farmers and fruit growers 
and to transportation lines on land and sea, and even 
to estimate the stages of high water on rivers which may 
threaten cities and many low-lying areas of cultivation. 
We have few better examples of the bearing of scien- 
tific knowledge on human welfare. 
Industrial and household arts’ projects. — The 
working out of typical minor projects on a simple basis 
suitable to school children is better exemplified in the 
industrial and household arts than in the studies we 
have been describing. The following examples may be 
cited: The preparation of a simple breakfast; the 
designing and making of a dress; the plan and construc- 
tion of a bird house; designing and executing a table 
in shop work; a well-thought-out and developed project 
of a chicken house or corncrib or garage or hotbed; a 
plan for decorating a room; the design and work on a 
book binding; making the pattern and weaving a rug; 
the construction of a cedar chest; the suitable framing 
and mounting of a picture; planning and putting to- 
gether a coasting sled. 
These minor home problems correspond well to 
similar larger projects which adults are all the while 
working out in life, as the planning and building of 
houses; the construction of bridges; the inventing of 
machines, like engines and motors; the building of 
boats; erecting barns, silos, and windmills; planning 
telegraph and telephone projects; mining and reduc- 
tion enterprises; engineering projects in road construc-

68 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
tion and harbor improvements; schemes for draining 
swamp land, for forest conservation, for shipbuilding 
and canal construction. Again it would be impossible 
to draw any clear line of demarcation between the early 
small home projects of children and the larger later 
projects peculiar to adult life. The imitative impulse 
toward adult projects begins early and develops pro- 
gressively. 
Units and masterpieces of literature. — In all these 
prominent thought studies, history, science, geography, 
industrial and household arts, the smaller or larger 
project, as a type of human effort, is the center for the 
organization of experience. But one other great thought 
study remains, literature, and it is focused upon the 
chief units of literary art, corresponding closely to the 
large projects in other studies. In fact literature is a 
still better illustration of the more perfect organization 
of knowledge materials combining beauty of form with 
copious richness of thought. The themes also of the 
masters spring directly from life and reflect its deeper 
meanings. | 
Language is so deeply inwrought with all the impor- 
tant thought studies that it is dangerous to separate it 
from such excellent company. Whenever we make 
language an exclusive study of rules and principles and 
formal grammar, our vital grip on language as a means 
of expression seems to be relaxed and weakened. 
These life Projects are the natural approaches to 
world knowledge. — We have been saying all along 
that the projects are centers of organization for group- 
ing and combining materials so as to form a simplified 
and unified course of study. We are now disposed to
-P-A-G-E-77
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 69 
conclude that these pragmatic organizations, springing 
out of the developing experiences of men and women in 
the life struggle, also mark out clearly the natural ap- 
proaches to knowledge for the inquiring minds of chil- 
dren and youth. They express the original genetic 
growth and combinations of experience which spring 
the lock and reveal the inner structure of this world 
machinery surrounding the child. A study of particu- 
lar projects is necessary to make this point clear. 
The problem of reorganization thrust upon us is thus 
clearly defined and the solution of this problem is to be 
found, we think, in reorganizing the study materials 
around these natural thought centers. Inseparably 
bound up with such a plan of organization is the ques- 
tion of method of instruction, grounded in the natural 
evolution of thought in the growing minds of children. 
But few important thought centers in studies. — 
How much substantial relief from the present complex- 
ity and confusion of studies is this reorganization calcu- 
lated to bring? The more thoroughly we inquire into 
the basal values and content of elementary studies, the 
more our attention is forced up against the fact that 
the predominating thought centers in any study and in 
the larger combination of all studies are few in number— 
surprisingly few. The present miscellaneousness and 
superficiality of numerous studies would wholly conceal 
this underlying simplicity. Now if these few centers 
are not in themselves too complicated, if they are readily 
accessible to children, a radical simplification of our 
curriculum may be plainly in view. 
The few strategic centers suggest a basal simplicity. 
— Wherever this effort to simplify the course has been 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
| 
70 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
attempted by grouping facts and data around a central 
core, as in the case of the Erie Canal and the Virginia 
Plantation, a surprising relief from the bewildering 
complexity of studies has been the result. The interest- 
ing and adventurous story of La Salle, suitable for the 
fifth grade, brings to one center an amount of history 
and geography well knit together that is amazing and 
even includes elements of physiography and natural 
history. By a natural expansion it may serve as a type 
of French exploration and French influence in America. 
These few strategic centers around which extensive 
knowledge can be arrayed in such a way as to demon- 
strate the vital truths which form the backbone of 
important studies give us strong hope of a greatly re- 
duced and simplified course of study. A big, apparently 
complex topic, like the Union Pacific Railway, may be 
very simple and transparent in its basal, concretely 
expressed idea and thus radiate a clear light over all its 
immediate attachments, besides serving later to inter- 
pret other railroad routes across the Western mountains. 
The growing complexity necessary in large topics 
is a movement toward simplicity and comprehensive- 
ness. — The growing complexity involved in the 
natural expansion of these long topics need not confuse 
the children because it carries forward the natural 
grouping of the facts in their proper relation of cause 
and effect. They are far better understood and re- 
membered in these essential relations than as separate 
disjointed facts. If children are to do any thinking 
at all, they must discover and trace out the relations 
that bind the parts of knowledge together into larger, 
complex wholes. Growth in knowledge, if it is to be  
-P-A-G-E-79
  
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 71 
anything more than a haphazard and tiresome accumu- 
lation and reiteration of facts, must be a discovery of 
relations and meanings that knit together the parts of 
knowledge into larger bundles. As developed wholes 
these larger groupings are transparently simple. And 
yet they may be very far-reaching as a basis for the 
future constructive development of knowledge, 7.e. on 
the basis of types. If this simplicity and far-reaching 
connectedness in knowledge subjects can be demon- 
strated, our case is proved. Otherwise we are thrown 
back into the chaos of miscellaneous, factual studies. 
These centers are practical groupings, not logical 
classifications. — It should be clearly understood that 
these larger groupings or life organizations of knowledge 
are not identical with the commonly accepted logical 
and scientific classifications, which have long been so 
familiar to us in school studies. In total contrast to 
such artificial and bookish predicates they may be 
described by that much abused word “practical.” 
They represent projects generated and brought to 
fruition under life pressure and bearing the stamp and 
full impress of the outside world. They exhibit every- 
day forces at constructive activity in their working 
clothes and in their necessary relations and environ- 
ments. We do not object to scientific classifications in 
their proper places and useful functions. But in the 
processes of teaching they come late into service and 
should be held in reserve as ultimate norms for fully 
organized knowledge. 
Is democratic education in this deeper sense feasible? 
— The complex environment of the modern world is 
presumably made up out of these large operative units
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
which have been combined into a social, codperative 
scheme which we call civilization. It is quite apparent 
that this complex social and economic machinery is a 
mystery to many adult people. Their education has 
not given them sufficient clues to unravel its mystery. 
The deeper question is: ‘How far is it possible to 
educate the common run of children so that they will 
understand in a primary fashion the leading forces and 
agencies operating in our society?” Those who object 
to this question as too deep should remember that we 
are a democracy and that the problem of settling and 
ordering their own affairs is up to the people. 
Our present instruction not equal to this problem. — 
In our democratic society it is quite important that the 
people should gain insight into the fundamentals of 
this social system. Our present plan of elementary 
instruction is not doing much to clear up the confusion. 
The school system is performing an enormous service 
in many important ways, but this problem of mastering 
the elements of our economic and social life in its present 
form is new and the product of recent, rapid develop- 
ments in our national life. Our present school instruc- 
tion does little more than familiarize the children with 
the names of the leading elements which compose this 
complex situation. To expect children to pass over 
from this alphabet of names to an interpretation of 
complex life agencies is wholly beside the mark, as if 
one might be supposed to understand chemistry who 
had merely learned the names of the primary chemical 
elements. The larger, simpler units which comprise 
this complex social status must be grappled with in 
their individuality and their relationships.
-P-A-G-E-81
  BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 73 
Typical cases must be studied concretely. — Our 
scheme, therefore, for gaining a real understanding of 
this seemingly intricate world system is that children 
should become acquainted gradually and in succession 
with its larger component factors, objectively demon- 
strated as types of fundamental processes and work- 
ing institutions in society. For the benefit of children 
we must get at these typical life projects concretely in 
their most simple and effective mode of treatment. 
They have developed and grown into their present 
form under the shaping influence of economic environ- 
ment. We can get at their history, their crude, simple 
beginnings and the main steps manifested in their 
growth. This whole growth and the present result 
can be presented and seen objectively as a life process, 
actually operative, not as a definition or theory ab- 
stracted from life. 
Large simple types reveal the world structure. — In 
fact the world is not nearly so inscrutable as it first 
appears to the unpracticed eye. It has some big 
simplicities in its structure which can be clearly 
opened up to the discerning eyes of children. It is 
our full confidence in children and youth, that they 
are qualified to think these problems through when 
objectively presented, that implies hope. To dis- 
entangle this seeming complexity children require big, 
simple object lessons in nature and society which, as 
genuine types of main processes and institutions, un- 
ravel the mysteries. 
Example of our postal system.— Among social 
phenomena our present postal system is a vast and 
complicated piece of machinery. Yet it is simple in

its basal elements, and the growth from early primitive 
methods can be clearly traced and demonstrated il- 
lustratively to children and even thought out as a 
natural succession of problems. In fact the difficulties 
and problems met in such developing projects supply 
children with the best stimuli to thought and reflection 
that we have yet discovered. 
The objectivity of big topics and the large brain capac- 
ity of children need to be considered. — In this effort 
to understand the world two things we have strangely 
overlooked or at least completely underestimated: One 
is the conspicuously objective quality of these big 
topics as presented to view in world life outside of 
school, as seen in steam engines, skyscrapers, railroads, 
public buildings, steamships, city harbors, universities, 
cotton fields, and factories; the second is the inborn 
capacity of children to think with their big brains 
far in excess of their bodily growth. Instead of these 
conspicuous object lessons offered directly to children 
for thoughtful interpretation, we have been: stuffing 
their minds with a mess of definitions and general 
statements and dry isolated facts that are a drag upon 
mental action and a drug in the school market. No- 
body denies this who is conversant with the facts, and 
yet somehow we are unable to shake ourselves free from 
this traditional incubus. Why not give children plenty 
of strong, rich thought material in lifelike demonstra- 
tion and not be always censuring them for failing to 
respond to the dull and uninspiring material we have 
been offering? 
The broad gateway of knowledge can be entered by 
all who think.— As children move into the larger 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
    
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 75 
realms of knowledge through these broad gateways 
offered by tangible derhonstration types, like ships 
passing out through the Golden Gate into the Pacific, 
their onward movement into the world of knowledge 
is not impeded but strengthened and reénforced. Chil- 
dren can not move out intelligently into this complex 
world, demanding thoughtful interpretation, on the 
basis of a stupid memory routine. Their minds must 
expand to the comprehension of still broader relations 
as the world opens up. VEhe-world-in-alt-its-essential_ 
aspects is dominated-bythought, and this thought-must 
grow in graduated complexity as we advance.) This 
expansive energy of proper thinking is cle Shown in 
the matters now to be considered. 
Several studies are grouped together in any large 
typical project.— One of these growing knowledge 
centers, by virtue of its scope and integrating power, 
gathers into one transparent unity of thought important 
materials contributed by three or four studies. For 
example, the story of the Pennsylvania Railroad in its 
early history and growth, conditioned by geographic 
environment and influenced by progressive scientific 
invention, combines several studies into one large de- 
veloping project. It draws strongly upon history, geog- 
raphy, science, mathematics, and language. For the 
time being all these studies combine into a codperative 
group for supplying the knowledge materials essential 
to a full understanding of this growing traffic system. 
The Panama Canal is also the outcome of such a com- 
bination of many strong influences acting in a world 
environment to achieve the solution of a great com- 
mercial problem.  
-P-A-G-E-84
76 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
  The simplicity of such large teaching units. — Few 
important projects, if any, can be worked out on the ex- 
tremely limited resources furnished by any single study. 
Sometimes the whole range of studies supplies none too 
broad a basis from which to work out the adequate 
treatment of a single big teaching unit. For illus- 
tration, the home garden, as a project, is almost as 
broad and as varied in its scope as the course of study 
at any one point, and it is not unduly complex or 
difficult for children. These extensive correlations pe- 
culiar to large teaching units appear, at the first glance, 
to complicate our instruction; but as a matter of fact, 
they simplify. They reveal the scope and meaning of 
some big governing idea which, like a view from the 
mountain top, at one glance brings into simple perspec- 
tive and arrangement a whole vast grouping of minor 
facts. 
A typical project grows into a series and interprets 
a whole line of kindred topics. — This organization of 
manifold information from several studies into a com-/ 
prehensive but simple unit is after all but the begin- 
ning or first step in a continuous growth of knowledge 
along one great highway of thought. In this progress 
the interpretative power of the original basal idea shoots 
its light forward through a whole series of later studies. 
For example, the idea of evolution seen clearly demon- 
strated in one long animal series becomes a keen and 
quick principle of interpretation of numerous animal 
and plant series and finds application in many other 
fields of knowledge. The Mississippi Valley is a very 
large topic of almost continental scope and complexity, 
and yet it is objectively simple and tangible in its main
-P-A-G-E-85
BASIS FOR ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES 77 
features. By first gathering a full and well-organized 
knowledge of the Mississippi as a geographic unit and 
type, we may carry forward a succession of profitable 
river studies, first, of North America and, later, of 
other continents, which will give a steady growth and 
expansion in a simple line of thought with the Missis- 
sippi idea as the basal unit and standard of comparison. 
As the idea grows, it becomes more simple, powerful, 
and far-reaching. The broader, more far-reaching (com- 
plex) it becomes, the simpler and stronger its meaning. 
A big demonstration topic like the Mississippi River 
is designed therefore to set on foot an extended thought 
movement which steadily organizes its materials around 
the original axis of thought, the main idea. 
The continuous growth of a large teaching unit con- 
tributes to greater simplicity and enrichment. — Such 
a continuous growth and concentration of knowledge 
upon a central theme produces two remarkable re- 
sults: first, a constantly renewed demonstration and 
clarification of the original central idea (simplification) ; 
second, a steady expansion and enlargement of thought 
to include all important variations (enrichment). It 
is in such large, fully elaborated topics that we achieve 
a fundamental simplicity combined with scholarly 
enrichment in subject matter. 
This continuous development of fundamental types 
through the full length of the course of study gives such 
an emphasis to central organizing ideas and such a 
proper evaluation and use of the secondary facts 
gathered around these central axes of thought that 
simplicity and clear thinking characterize every ad- 
vance into these seemingly complicated subjects. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
78 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
SuMMARY 
A few main highways of thought extend through the full 
length of important studies and form the bases of organization. 
The chief projects as centers of organization are distributed 
along these trunk lines of thought. 
The world outside of the school has organized its resources and 
its activities into large typical projects. These projects express 
man’s principal achievements in their aggressive, organizing 
character. 
The discovery is now made that these practical life organizations 
are a better basis for teaching than anything the schools have 
devised. They exactly fit the needs of children in their efforts to 
gain the mastery of the world about them in society and in nature. 
The school may wisely appropriate these already organized 
projects as the best means of introducing children to the actual 
world arrangements. 
The wide-awake, intelligent interest of children in these big ob- 
jective projects and their whole-hearted participation in them are 
clear proofs that the child and the world can get together on this 
platform. 
Every important project at its beginning plants its roots deep 
in a life situation and it ends in a direct reaction upon life and an 
interpretation of life problems with a deeper and broader meaning. 
It has been found that intensive organization of knowledge at 
the strategic points along these main lines of thought leads to a 
remarkable simplification and enrichment of the curriculum. 
As complete objective demonstrations of fundamental processes 
in the world, these projects are universal types and serve as inter- 
preters of world affairs on a grand and simple scale. 
By learning gradually to understand the world order as revealed 
in these fundamental, practical organizations, children are on the 
highway to that specific knowledge of the social machinery that 
. leads to intelligent citizenship.

  CHAPTER IIT 
SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS AND THEIR RELA- 
TION TO THE THINKING POWER OF 
CHILDREN          
   
     In the foregoing chapters unusual stress has been 
laid upon large teaching units. They are set up as 
object lessons in organization on a comprehensive plan 
reaching lengthwise and crosswise among studies. These 
expanded typical projects, or units of study, are pre- 
sented as a ground plan for securing a much needed 
simplification and enrichment of the curriculum. 
The idea like a rich vein of ore. — What surpassing 
excellence is wrapped up in one of these large teaching 
projects that can justify this high opinion of its merits? 
It is the potency of an idea; the whole extensive demon- 
stration is centered upon an idea, and the sole purpose 
is to exhibit this idea in its working power. When we 
break through the husk and strip off the wrappings of 
one of these big topics, we shall find at the center the 
long-sought treasure — a simple idea. It is a veritable 
gold mine and, like any rich vein of ore which runs deep 
into the mountain, it grows richer with depth and is 
worth all the expense of exploiting. In this deepening 
study of an idea, entrenched in the facts and surround- 
ings of life, we discover both the meaning of the idea 
and its effective power. In the Panama Canal project 
it is the idea of shortening sea routes, of bringing 
80        
           
                                
-P-A-G-E-89
  SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 81 
hitherto widely separated countries into much closer 
commercial contact. It is a world-embracing and a 
world-unifying idea. 
We sometimes speak of the facts and materials of 
knowledge gathered and organized around a central 
idea. Facts are indeed the body, but ideas are the soul 
of instruction. Ideas are not tangible and objective, 
and consequently some thoughtless people are skeptical 
of their value. Ideas are mental products, and nothing 
less than mind can comprehend them. Yet they are 
somehow the sum and substance of knowledge. 
Getting the idea. — Ideas are the luminaries that 
penetrate into all the dark corners of the earth and 
convert its seeming chaos into rational order. Strange 
indeed that teachers have to be told that_ideas rather 
than facts are important, for in every study the idea is 
the meaning that lies at the center of any grouping of 
facts and without this our labor is vain. Teachers _   
  
therefore should.emphasize ideas because they are thera-— 
tional, significant elements in study. This is expressed 
in common langage, when, after puzzling a while over 
a new machine like a a mill-separator, “finally with-a-flash.. 
of-intelligence we exclaim, “Oh, yes!.._I_get.the idea.” 
Then the whole grouping of facts, no matter how exten- 
sive, becomes simple and rational. This is true in 
demonstrating a proposition in geometry or in explain- 
ing a principle of government. It is true when we at 
length catch the meaning of the central theme in a piece 
of literature like Thanatopsis. When Harvey dis- 
covered the circulation of the blood he routed out and 
captured a long hidden idea, and very soon he was able 
to interpret a multitude of physiological facts, which,
-P-A-G-E-90
    82 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
up to that date, were well known but not understood. 
Before this, the key idea that showed the relation of 
digestion, circulation, and respiration had been lacking. 
Discovering the secrets of the world order. — Ideas 
are the eyes of the mind, the far-reaching interpreters 
of the mysteries found everywhere in the fruitful fields 
of knowledge. Thus the idea of air pressure on water 
in the well explains the action of the lift pump. Ideas 
are the secrets of the world order brought to light and 
revealed in their broad scope to the surprised intel- 
ligence of children, as the metamorphosis of a butter- 
fly through the stages of egg, larva, chrysalid, and full- 
fledged insect. Ideas are like the sun; once seen, they 
shine with their own brilliant light. An attempt to 
give a logical proof of the importance of a great idea is 
superfluous. We do not light a torch with which to 
examine the sun. Ideas at work are their own 
vindication. 
There are no substitutes for ideas. — Important 
ideas exercise an absolute monopoly over intellectual 
operations, because there is no substitute for them. 
Everything else is blind and ignorant by comparison. 
When, therefore, we substitute facts for ideas, we 
abandon the field of education. Ideas are in a class by 
themselves; they are unique and incomparable. They 
alone shed the light of intelligence abroad throughout 
the world. Here again the whole proof lies in examples, 
not in argument. 
The ancient Greeks were a small people, a mere 
handful, in a tiny land. But the Greeks had ideas, 
and with these ideas they stocked Europe and America. 
All the Western nations as they have risen to intelligence
-P-A-G-E-91
  SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 83 
and culture have looked up to these marvelous Greeks 
and have continued to pay them the highest tribute. 
A man with an idea is unusual, even remarkable. The 
difference between Edison and other people is that he 
is a man of ideas. He thinks, not along many lines 
perhaps, but he really thinks; and when a man of that 
type thinks, the whole world is illumined. Man goes 
out to conquer the world by the strength of ideas. 
They are the gleaming suns that reveal the world system 
to him as he goes out on his thinking excursions. 
Figures of speech necessary to express ideas. — 
Ideas not being tangible and quantitative must find 
some mode of revealing themselves to our concrete 
intelligence. So we use figures of speech as suggestive 
and interpretative. But even our most graphic figures 
of speech are crude instruments in expressing the full 
meaning of ideas. We say, for example, that thought 
travels with the speed of lightning, but the light- 
ning’s speed has been measured; not so the speed of 
thought. 
The burden bearers of the world. — Ideas are the 
gigantic burden bearers of the modern world. The 
steam engine is an idea encased in steel, and it does 
heavy work. Hercules was a pigmy compared with 
the steam engine working in its myriad forms, hauling 
the vast tonnage of commerce across land and sea, and 
running vast factories and mines. 
_ A few giant ideas, like fabled Atlas, are quite husky 
enough to carry the world on their shoulders. What we 
call civilization rests on a few broad-shouldered ideas 
which unhappily are not working together very har- 
moniously and effectively for lack of thinkers and  
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
teachers and still more for lack of an educated people 
who can respond intelligently to such ideas. 
Ideas, therefore, incorporated in large teaching units, 
are the intelligence centers in the course of study because 
they are the intelligence centers of the world itself. 
The treasure house of the mind. — These central 
strongholds of knowledge once captured and held by 
the learner as a seeker after truth furnish a generous 
equipment for the needs of life. In this sense the whole 
body of cultural and serviceable ideas is sometimes 
spoken of as the treasury of the mind, the grand gift 
of thought that comes down to us as an inheritance 
out of the past. 
The productive energy in ideas. — If now we add 
to this the further notion that an important idea has 
wrapped up in it a vital energy, a really creative, dy- 
namic power that keeps it growing and expanding, we 
discover in such an idea an organizer of knowledge on a 
grand constructive plan. Such ideas necessarily open 
up the main highways of thought which go on develop- 
ing far beyond our present ken. ‘There is in fact a far- 
reaching productive energy in fundamental ideas by 
reason of which they generate powerful and lasting 
influences. It is easy to name a few such basal ideas 
which have displayed this potential force in human 
affairs; for example, the idea of justice or fair dealing, 
of self-government under law, of community sanitation, 
of expert professional service, of love of home, of pa- 
triotism, of protection of life and property. Once 
incorporated into human experience, these ideas show 
themselves so useful that they constantly expand and 
take on new strength. It is interesting to notice that
-P-A-G-E-93
    
SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 85 
the mere enumeration of these ideas in this formal 
manner is a dull recital. The live facts of experience 
must get into close association with these ideas to 
acquire meaning and force. Facts and ideas, properly 
combined, form the basis of knowledge; facts alone are 
helpless. 
The downhill road to oblivion. — Too many facts 
bunched together in an unorganized mass confuse the 
mind and are poorer than junk. The mind of a child 
should not be made a storage ground for lifeless facts. It 
has been often and seriously affirmed that three fourths 
of what a child learns of such dull facts in school he for- 
gets. In that case his mind becomes a sort of burial place 
for worn-out facts; not a very cheerful thought to the 
educator. This notion of forgetting might serve for 
old, tired-out folk whose memories are fading out, but 
children are full of the energy of life and what they get 
should be nourishing that it may be used for assimila- 
tion and growth. What a queer and monstrous thought 
this is that much the greater part of what they learn so 
laboriously is dedicated to oblivion, is predestined to 
failure. This may be called the final slump in educa- 
tion. Informing, regenerating ideas are the sole relief, 
the one antidote for this stultifying dullness. 
Testing the germinating quality of ideas. — Too 
often this lack of growing ideas with their deep, strong 
content renders our school instruction sterile. Too 
many topics are feeble and forceless for lack of this 
propagating thought quality. As teachers we might 
take a lesson from recent agriculture. By careful 
selection expert farmer; use only such seed as is sure to 
sprout and grow. All other less fertile seed is put aside 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
    86 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
and fed to the pigs. What would happen should 
teachers select only those ideas which under normal 
culture are sure to grow and produce a harvest? The 
corn testers to-day are scientifically careful in testing 
the germinating energy of their seed corn. We need 
idea testers to go through our course of study to test out 
the germinating quality of ideas and to exclude the 
weak and trivial. Sterility of thought in school studies 
is baneful. It devitalizes a child’s naturally robust 
energies. If the concepts that lie at the basis of our 
course of study have lost their vital force, what is left? 
“Tf the salt hath lost its savor, wherewith shall it be 
salted?” 
Peter Cooper’s idea. — As constructive ideas may be 
designated those simple, powerful concepts in the 
present course which are fertile and generative, yielding 
not merely a hundredfold but a thousandfold. A 
certain Frenchman has called these ‘‘mother ideas.” 
A single vitalizing idea that has taken deep root in a 
child’s mind may carry him forward on an endless 
progress and may organize into tributary service the 
opportunities and forces of a lifetime. Peter Cooper, a 
poor, ignorant apprentice to a wagonmaker in New 
York, determined in his own mind, when about eighteen 
years old, that he would one day found a night school, 
where well-meaning, industrious boys should have a 
better chance to help themselves to an education than 
he had had. He held fast to this early idea through 
a long life and slowly collected the means of carrying 
it into effect. Forty-five years later, when past sixty, 
with his accumulated $600,000.00 he founded the 
Cooper Union in the busy part of lower New York
-P-A-G-E-95
  SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 87 
City. After the main building was completed and 
opened to young men and women, he continued to 
support it for twenty-five years. It developed into 
a great school helping thousands of boys and girls of 
the working class, and it will go on year by year helping 
other thousands for centuries to come. Thus on the 
Sasis of one cherished idea he wrought out a grand 
¥urse of public beneficence which few philanthropists 
have ever equaled. 
Leading thoughts are the strategists in education. — 
The eight-year program of the elementary school can 
not be better conceived of than as the broad field of 
action where the simple basal ideas in the school studies 
shall have free scope to develop their steady organizing 
energy. The course of study, throughout its length 
and breadth, should feel the driving power of afew con- 
structive ideals. They have a propagating and com- 
bining quality by which they gather under their ample 
protection whole broods and families of mere facts and 
of related ideas and of kindred, supporting knowledge. 
Herein lies the secret of the continuous educative proc- 
ess. We must swing into the line of march with chil- 
dren under the leadership of these energetic, far-seeing 
strategists, the masterful ideas. We shall then glimpse 
the end from the beginning and get on the main high- 
ways of thought. ' 
The smothering of ideas. — How does it happen 
that many ideas, even the keenest, when brought into 
school become sterile and impotent? One reason is 
that they are encumbered with quantities of merely 
factual knowledge. Another explanation is that they 
are suffocated by numbers. Ideas, like plants, must  
-P-A-G-E-96
  88 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
have plenty of room in which to grow. When too 
many are huddled together in close quarters, they dwin- 
dle and die. Somehow we must make room in the 
school course for a superior monopolistic group, a com- 
pany of ideas of high rank and prestige. A few 
stalwart ideas are worth a million pigmies. Because 
of a natural influx of new studies, our curriculum has 
become overloaded, even densely crowded with rather 
cheap commonplace knowledge until it is made up of a 
multitude of stunted ideas and, even worse, of lifeless 
facts that never had in them the gleam of an idea. 
Children can not thrive intellectually or morally on such 
a diet. 
Keeping in good company and living in kings’ gardens. 
— Our course of study by common consent should be 
made up of the best in literature and history and sci- 
ence, out of that which is conspicuously important and 
representative, not out of what is commonplace and 
ordinary. We use the biographies of Franklin and 
Webster and Hamilton and Lincoln, not those of any 
Tom, Dick, and Harry. In this way children who have 
properly begun their education have spent their early 
years among the great, with the charming story-tellers 
like Scott and Dickens and Defoe and Homer, with 
poets and statesmen and heroes and artists and even 
with philosophers like Socrates and Franklin. The 
children have been in good company and have acquired 
a habit of thinking great and noble thoughts. They 
have traveled with the world’s boldest explorers like 
Columbus and Magellan and La Salle. They were very 
intimate companions of Daniel Boone and Frémont 
and David Livingstone and Robert Bruce. They have
-P-A-G-E-97
  SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 89 
been in close personal touch with famous inventors like 
Morse and Stephenson, Robert Fulton and Edison. 
They have kept excellent company. Children should 
spend their time in kings’ gardens, not in slums and 
back alleys. 
The birthright of children. — The. common school, 
therefore; properly conceived, is not-dealing with.com- 
mon things but rather with uncommon — the- best. 
More than that, the elementary school deals with the 
large things and not with the little — with the colossal 
rather than the microscopic. These young minds leap 
forward to grasp whatever is broad and liberal in 
thought and conception. To lay hold of and enjoy 
what is noble and large-minded is their birthright and 
is within the easy, natural compass of their minds. I 
have seen a little girl of five years who had not been in 
school listen with pleasure and appreciation to the 
reading of Plato’s Apology of Socrates. It might be 
well for us to have a larger respect for the mental powers 
of children, at least for their high spirit and enterprise. 
At any rate the grand and simple ideas of our Christian 
society and culture are already embodied in our elemen- 
tary curriculum and are only awaiting the time when 
the accumulated rubbish shall be cleared away and these 
strong wholesome ideas shall have room to grow and 
reveal themselves progressively in their full meaning 
and value. But there is no way of serving both God 
and Mammon; we can not devote ourselves to multi- 
tudinous trifles and have time left to cultivate the “ 
worship of great and simple ideas. 
Our problem remains — how to deal with a few 
important constructive ideas. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
Webster and his one idea. — The great man of any 
age is the one who can single out the vital idea of the 
time and carry it forward to a successful issue. Much 
can be affirmed in favor of the man of one idea. Daniel 
Webster was a statesman of capacious and powerful 
intellect, and no one would call him narrow in his in- 
terests. But heis conspicuous in our history as the rep- 
resentative of one strong constructive principle — the 
union of the states in opposition to disunion. His one 
statesmanlike project was to build up and strengthen 
against all assaults this principle of Federal sover- 
eignty. His greatest orations, ranking among the 
foremost of ancient and modern times, center at this 
one point. The high school or college student who is 
looking for a central constructive theme in historical 
study will find it in the life and political orations of 
Daniel Webster. And yet extraordinary as Webster 
was in his comprehensive grasp and luminous interpre- 
tation of this great national idea, he is but one in a re- 
markable succession of statesmen — Hamilton, Web- 
ster, Lincoln — whose chief merit and distinction was 
their whole-hearted devotion to this same illustrious 
idea. There is nothing strange about this, because one 
such pregnant idea has sufficient virtue and strength to 
outfit a dozen statesmen of the highest rank. For this 
idea has now become the corner stone of our Constitution 
and of our whole political fabric — destined perhaps to 
stand firm for a thousand years as the supreme type of 
the idea of free government for the world. Such an 
epoch-making idea grows stronger with the lapse of 
years. It was said of Moses at the end of one hundred 
and twenty years of life that his eye was not dim and 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 91 
his strength was not abated. But such a regnant 
idea as this after a thousand years shows no signs of 
age and seems destined to an immortal youth. 
Darwin’s devotion to an idea. — Darwin’s name and 
fame center in an idea expressed by a single word. 
During a long life of investigation and reflective study, 
he followed the beckoning of a single thought. Into 
this current of thought he drew one by one the best 
scientific minds of his time, Lyell, Wallace, Gray, 
Huxley, and Hooker, not to speak of thousands of less 
note. On the Origin of Species, devoted to the exposition 
of this idea, has been reckoned the greatest book of the 
nineteenth century. It is the embodiment of a produc- 
tive idea whose discovery, scope, and applications 
summed up the life labors of a profound and original 
scientific thinker. As a fundamental interpretation of 
life phenomena and changes throughout the ages, 
Darwin’s conception is revolutionary and transcend- 
ently significant. It has exerted a powerful recon- 
structive influence in all fields of human experience 
and knowledge. 
Great leaders are exponents of single ideas. — 
These and other kindred examples that easily suggest 
themselves demonstrate the powerful sway of ideas 
over adult scholarly thinkers — even the greatest. It 
may be said with much show of reason that the men of 
large caliber in history centered their life labors with 
resolute purpose upon a single potent idea in each case. 
So it was with Paul, with Luther, with Francis Bacon, 
with Alexander Hamilton. We often designate a man 
and his greatness by a single word, as Abraham, the 
man of faith, Plato, the idealist, Darwin, the evolu-

tionist. It is the ill fortune of the schoolmaster that 
he disperses his thoughts and efforts too widely; or 
perhaps better stated, he fails to find and put into use 
the unifying principle that subordinates all his activi- 
ties to a central aim. The monopoly of power by a 
single idea, this organization of knowledge at a vital 
point is a powerful means of achievement in the world’s 
work and likewise in individual character. 
A great book is the exposition of an idea. — Adam 
Smith in his book, The Wealth of Nations, worked out 
the principle of free competition in industrial life and 
became the founder of political economy. Henry 
George espoused the idea of the single tax, and a re- 
markable book was the outcome. A famous historical 
novel like Ivanhoe is Scott’s marvelous rendering of the 
idea of knighthood in feudal times. Les Miserables 
and the Scarlet Letter are great books in each of which a 
single idea is vindicated. A political party, unless it 
is decadent and has become a mere machine, owes its 
existence and its usefulness to an organizing idea. 
This concentration of thought on a single theme is 
likewise found in Shakespeare’s plays, as in King Lear 
or Macbeth. Burke’s masterly Speech on Conciliation 
with America is focused at one point, and so is Cicero’s 
speech against Verres. Even a whole school of phi- 
losophers is tagged with one name, because one idea 
dominates their system of thought as was true of the 
Platonists, the Hegelians, and the Kantians. 
The superior dominance and simplicity of ideas. — 
Two conclusions may be reasonably drawn from these 
citations: First, the vast world order and system of 
knowledge is simple because it is framed on the basis of 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 93 
a very few preéminent, constructive ideas which perme- 
ate and illuminate the whole scheme of things. Second, 
the great thinkers are those who have discovered for 
us these far-reaching simplicities of thought. The 
master minds are those which have reached out to 
comprehend the master ideas that regulate the world. 
Corresponding to the endless variety and complexity 
of world knowledge there is an endless simplicity of 
fundamental ideas. There is an aristocracy of ideas 
that holds the reins of government over the democracy 
of facts. There is a hierarchy of ideas that rules by the 
divine right of superiority. 
The great question. — We are now ready to ask the 
main question: ‘Can children be let in to these few 
great secrets of world knowledge? Can they grasp 
these fundamental simplicities of the world order?” 
We have been talking about the master thinkers among 
adults. Can children, who are beginners in knowledge, 
pick up these threads and trace out these simple funda- 
mental continuities, the basal ideas? A mere glance at 
textbooks will show that children are on the track of 
world ideas. But they are thrown at the children 
abruptly without due preparation or perspective or 
sequence. 
A proposed plan. — Most of these ideas are already 
in the course of study, and the children are at hand with 
whom we may make the experiment and test the re- 
sults. Because of serious faults in our present plan . 
of studies and in our method of teaching, the results in 
power of thought are not at all satisfactory. A re- 
organization of studies founded upon a strong emphasis 
and cultivation of basal ideas running through the 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
SO a RE Der ee tne ene net rte 
94 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
course is now proposed as a solution of the curriculum 
problem. By beginning early and taking plenty of 
time, we may work out a few ideas completely and 
connectedly, and a few are enough. The success of this 
plan depends first upon the selection of good starting 
points for this work early in the grades. We need first- 
class demonstrations of these ideas suitable to children. 
Are there stories, poems, songs, outdoor excursions, 
and activities that express these ideas vividly and carry 
over into the life of primary children? Is there, then, 
a set of vigorous projects and enlarged object lessons 
which will capture and engage the thoughts and in- 
terests of intermediate grades? Will these same ideas 
expand in later years to larger dimensions so as to build 
up and strengthen the earlier studies? Can we build 
this ladder by which children — 
- “Tise 
From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies, 
And mount to its summit round by round”? 
We aim simply at the continuous development of a few 
strong ideas growing constructively throughout the 
years of school life. Such a plan must depend entirely 
upon the original receptive endowment of children 
for such ideas and their capacity for development dur- 
ing these years. 
Respect for the thinking power of children. — 
Emerson once said that the first qualification of the 
teacher was to have respect for children. In recent 
years children have received much consideration from 
those willing to learn from them. Remarkable changes 
have taken place in our plan and method of dealing
-P-A-G-E-103
  SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 95 
with them. The total suppression of their physical 
activities at school and elsewhere, once common, has 
given way to a modified freedom. We have learned to 
respect their overplus of physical energy, to make room 
for it as a strong reénforcement of the school program, 
and even to give it a first mortgage on the school plant. 
But the release of natural physical energies seems to 
have brought with it a release of mental powers that 
we had scarcely suspected. Their big brains are 
active and energetic as well as their muscles. Mind 
and body seem to be in close codperation, and the 
arousal of the one affects the other, and teamwork is 
the result. 
Results of emancipation. — At any rate this physical 
emancipation of children and the partial release also 
from the old bondage to alphabets and primers have 
called forth a new course of study for children in the pri- 
mary grades, a course fruitful in thought and abounding 
in rational activity. As a result of this improvement 
the primary school is now probably the best school in 
our whole system from top to bottom’ Children in the 
primary school are beginning to live in a genuine fashion 
and in the process are taking on many of the best ele- 
ments of culture in our social order. Wehaveransacked 
the world from ancient nations down to the present to 
find thought materials in story form good enough for 
children in the primary grades. In our home neighbor- 
hoods we have despoiled nature in forest and garden 
and on the roadside so as to let the children into her 
secrets. They have engaged in housebuilding and 
weaving and pottery and agriculture in the effort to 
discover what uses are being made of these products

and resources. In the midst of these things they have 
mastered their phonics and spelling and numbers about 
as well as usual. Children in the primary grades are 
now learning in a natural way many things that would 
make old folks wiser. 
The advantage of children over adults. — We have 
been forced, against our old prejudices, to believe that 
there may be a freshness and vigor in children’s think- 
ing not found often among adults. Ideas may be 
relatively more potential with children, more efficient 
to shape character and conduct, than with adults. 
While everything else is growing, ideas also expand into 
blossom and fruitage. In other words children are in 
the nascent state, and in health their appetite for food 
may be no stronger than their zest for ideas. We may 
be compelled to believe that even primary children 
are intelligent, 7.c. have ideas. 
The gradual emergence of mental control. — Mind 
and body alike are highly energized in younger children. 
The impulsive tendencies are very strong, but ideas also 
are pushing to the front and tend to acquire an ascend- 
ancy in this realm of spontaneous physical action. Even 
before they reach the school age, children are under 
the guidance of ideas and well-formed motives, as is 
shown in their games and childish projects. Their 
attention is monopolized by stories that touch the 
deeper truths of life. The constructive exercises in 
primary grades develop foresight in planning and lead 
on little by little to technique in construction and de- 
sign. The muscular and physical powers of children 
are thus gradually brought under the sway of ideas. 
It is indeed natural and fortunate that ideas arising in
-P-A-G-E-105
SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 97 
vital connection with these early spontaneous motor 
activities should be developing into control. Theideas 
that thus arise naturally out of a child’s own activities 
are the focal points upon which thought, feeling, and 
will are centered. The school, of course, directs its 
efforts to certain projects as centers of organization 
without which life, with its surplus energy, might run 
to waste and be frittered away on many things. Even 
now this happy union of physical and mental forces in 
children under the dominance of thought is exhibited 
in continuous social projects, in stories, and in drama- 
tizations. A first-year class is busy for weeks at a 
time in working out a plan for house and home 
construction and decoration. 
Precaution against the sway of formalism. — The 
fact that ideas are in the lead in early childhood and 
are yoked up intimately with these early physical 
activities bears closely on teaching processes. Exer- 
cises feeble in thought and rigid in form have small 
place in earliest education. Little children should be 
first awakened and strongly nourished with ideas; 
otherwise they may be swamped by the formalities of 
early teaching. Wise parents induct their children 
into the thought world of song and story and social 
games and activities before sending them to school, so as 
to protect them against the too great formalism of the 
school. If these prime sources of culture have suffered 
neglect in early years, the primary school should try to 
make good the loss. By applying the lever at this point 
the teacher can lift all the exercises of the primary 
school into the bracing atmosphere of vigorous action 
and thought. Thus equipped the child will not easily

    98 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
stagnate in alphabets, in reading, in spelling, and in 
numbers. 
First provide mental storage batteries. — The ma- 
chinery of forms and drills can be introduced in due 
time, but it is well to keep the machinery of learning 
somewhat in the background, at least long enough to 
give the little folk time to work up a strong headway in 
thinking. There is constant danger of damming up 
the natural current of thought with the supposed ma- 
chinery of thinking. It is wiser to accumulate mental 
storage batteries so as to generate thought movements 
strong enough to break through the formal obstruc- 
tions. Child life is full of impulsive energy, and it 
needs only direction in proper thought channels to 
give it a full volume of beneficent power. 
The middle grades still hold fast the old formal 
routine. — Already the primary school has been largely 
reconstructed on the basis of freedom and thought 
enrichment. The intermediate grades on the contrary 
are well established in the old formal traditional method 
and have not been reorganized adequately in conformity 
with modern principles of teaching. The textbooks, with 
their bare outline treatment of topics, are in full posses- 
sion of the field. A deductive method of general state- 
ment prevails throughout all this work. The only 
marked exception to this rule is found in the use of 
stories and choice selections in literature for the reading 
exercises. There are apparent exceptions in geography 
and history, but the condensed treatment of nearly all 
the topics in the textbooks, even of those in the story 
form, is strongly manifest. The introduction of new 
studies from time to time has so greatly enlarged
-P-A-G-E-107
Ree NT ee TN ee ee Te en ae enn ee, eee ee 
SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 99 
the course that continued condensation has been un- 
avoidable. We are attempting to teach a multitude 
of topics in all studies in a scant and wholly inadequate 
way. Inspite of various efforts to relieve the formalism 
and abstract quality of our studies in these grades, 
because of the inevitable expansion of the course, the 
evil has been growing greater instead of less. 
A reconstruction necessary. — The trouble is that the 
present plan of studies in intermediate grades is largely 
wrong and needs to be reconstructed. There are no 
principles upon which the present course can be de- 
fended. A very large part of the lessons in these 
grades is stupidly dull and lacking in thought stimulus. 
Children are not getting the cultural and practical 
ideas they are entitled to in these grades. What they 
do get is much garbled and confused. It is too vague 
and general. 
The beginnings of the strong thought movement 
are in the middle grades. — It is of extreme impor- 
tance that we get children started right in the inter- 
mediate grades, for the plan begun here is continued 
through the grammar school into the high school. A 
muddled instruction in these middle grades is sure to 
leave its trail of disaster along the whole line. In the 
fourth grade we take up for the first time the discussion 
of important ideas in history, literature, science, and 
geography, which, if properly initiated and developed, 
constitute the suitable foundation upon which the 
whole succeeding course is to be constructed. It is 
here that we should be laying the intellectual or thought 
basis of the structure of knowledge. The positive in- 
sertion of a few big substantial thought projects is the  
-P-A-G-E-108
100 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
  only adequate means, and there are no substitutes. 
There is little doubt that the dull and trifling treatment 
of important topics in these grades threatens to annihi- 
late the thinking powers just at the time when they 
spring to the front and dare us to the trial. As teachers 
we must accept the challenge and give these children 
a chance to think on large topics. The great march 
for the gold fields begins in the middle grades. 
A fixed program and a powerful backer. — The 
school at present usually lays down a fixed and formal 
program for children of these years. But it often 
happens that children who were alert in the first grade 
have become listless in the fourth and fifth grades, and 
in the seventh and eighth they have reached a settled 
indifference. This descent of children into sluggishness 
is not a good sign; it is contrary to the natural growth 
and exuberance of youth. The strong native current 
of thought and action does not stagnate unless it runs 
against serious obstructions. Unfortunately these ob- 
structions in middle and grammar grades are partly the 
artificial work of the schoolmaster, and he may acquire 
such an admiration for his own handiwork that it is 
very difficult to dislodge him. He has also a special 
advantage in the fact that he holds the fort. He makes 
or selects the textbooks and the course of study. He 
teaches the lessons or directs the teaching, and he sets 
the examinations. He has whipped things into shape 
to suit his own notions. He is “lord of the manor” 
and a very hard man to deal with on his own premises. 
The combination of devil and taskmaster. — There 
is a large amount of formal work to be done in 
intermediate grades, and children are well qualified to
-P-A-G-E-109
SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 101 
do it. Shall we therefore put these formalities in the 
forefront and work through them into knowledge, or 
shall we set up the standard of ideas and compel the 
forms to play attendance upon them? In the inter- 
mediate grades we meet the same old devil of formalism 
with whom we have been acquainted before. The 
hoary old scamp has entrenched himself here for the 
final battle. He has dug in, and it will take heavy 
artillery to blow him out. In fact he has no intention 
of being blown out. He has full confidence in the 
strength of his fortifications and of his extensive barbed- 
wire entanglements. He has something more impreg- 
nable than the Hindenburg Line. 
Our conviction is that the battle royal for a good 
course of study must be fought out to a finish in the 
intermediate grades — fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. 
The forces of conservatism have encamped along this 
battle front with its frowning breastworks, and they 
have a quiet confidence based on the fact that the whole 
organization is behind them. There is only one thing 
that might cause the archfiend and his followers to be 
faint-hearted, and that is the knowledge that one or 
two ideas exploded under his works are powerful enough 
to blow them into oblivion and leave nothing but shell 
holes. 
A few noble projects corresponding to the mental 
caliber of children. — In education also we may well 
believe that ideas sooner or later will have to be reck- 
oned with. Children of the intermediate grades are 
not now receiving their share of the educative world 
ideas. They are crammed with facts and forms and 
excluded from noble creative ideals. A series of  
-P-A-G-E-110
| 
102 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
projects and imposing object lessons should be brought 
within their reach which they are fully qualified to 
master and understand as demonstrations of important 
truths. The intermediate grades open up the great 
world of knowledge to children for the first time. The 
scope and meaning of a few generative ideas, as broad 
interpreters of the world, can unfold themselves strik- 
ingly to children of these years. This is based upon the 
presumption that these boys and girls can think and 
appreciate giant thoughts, in other words that they are 
brainy and aggressive in their thinking. The larger 
projects here proposed for their study correspond to 
the caliber and scope of their minds, and to tie them 
down exclusively to the elementary rudiments of for- 
mal school exercises is a mistake of large dimensions. 
It is a double mistake. It is a failure in the first in- 
stance to take the measure of mental capacity in chil- 
dren. But in the second case it shows the bigotry 
of dictating a program to twenty-three million children 
on a false basis. In education the offense against 
childhood is the failure to understand and appreciate 
children. Beware lest ye offend one of these little 
ones. 
The past master in education. — Instead of the 
combination of devil and taskmaster for boys and girls 
of the intermediate grades we need a superior brand of 
the boy scout leader or teacher-companion who embodies 
also the wisdom of Chiron, the wise old centaur, who 
educated the Greek boys — those who afterward be- 
came the fabled heroes of that wonder age. Chiron 
had a liking for boys and they for him. Although very 
wise and austere. he was an intimate and cherished 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  
SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 103 
companion of these boys and instilled into their minds 
noble ideals of virtue and self-control, and they went 
forth to do great deeds. 
Projects of large scope new and old. — Children of 
the intermediate grades are small in size but mighty in 
ideas. They are in the anticipatory stage of develop- 
ment where great ideas appeal to them. There is a 
deeper understanding and agreement between them, 
for example, and Hercules. They would do the same 
deeds. Theseus and Robert Bruce, William Penn and 
John Paul Jones are their friends and peers, just the 
natural, right sort of people, “good sports.” 
The active response of children. — For children of 
this age modern projects are just as good as the old 
heroic ones. Captain Eads scouring out the mud bars 
at the mouth of the Mississippi to let the big ships in 
is just as much of a hero as Hercules clearing out the 
Augean stables by a similar process. An explorer like 
Magellan or Champlain is a trusted companion with 
whom a child will share his last crust. Children’s 
minds expand freely to the comprehension of projects 
in Western irrigation, in canal building, in the appro- 
priation of water powers, in mountain-road engineering 
and tunnels, and in uncovering mineral resources in 
coal and iron and petroleum. They are prepared to 
speculate on the value and success of remarkable in- 
ventions, as the power loom for weaving, the quadruple 
rotary printing press, or schemes for tunneling under 
rivers, for the purifying of water in cities, for preserving 
meats and fruits in transit, refrigeration, etc. They 
are concerned with the construction of medieval castles 
and modern forts, with the cotton and wheat markets
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
on a world scale. Hannibal’s great project of crossing 
the Alps against Rome, the story of Robert Bruce, of 
Socrates, of Gustavus Adolphus, of Peter the Great and 
the founding of Petrograd, and of Cromwell — these 
and other well-told stories of daring enterprise furnish 
the intellectual drill grounds of these ambitious-minded 
everyday boys and girls. 
A side light from the history of education. — The 
doctrine which we have been applying to younger 
children — ideas first, forms and symbols second — 
applies with redoubled force, we think, to older children. 
The prime elements of knowledge and the springs of 
action are the fundamental ideas, not chiefly the sym- 
bols and forms. The dullness of school life is due to a 
lack of ideas or to a confused and perverted method of 
dealing with ideas. Three hundred years ago Comen- 
ius discovered the stupid monotony of language study 
(Latin) without significant thought. The three hun- 
dred years of varied experiments in teaching since then 
are a series of demonstrations of the futility of such 
exclusive formal teaching. The whole progressive move- 
ment in modern education is toward an earlier and 
keener experience of ideas. The main steps in this 
movement are familiar to students of the history of 
education: First of all, get ideas gained (1) through 
pictures, (2) through objects, (3) through nature study, 
(4) through making and construction, (5) through proj- 
ects. 
A hibernating period. — The fourth and fifth grades 
have been looked upon commonly as a sort of interreg- 
num between the primary grades and the grammar 
school, where not much is doing except busy work,
-P-A-G-E-113
  SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 105 
language drills, spelling, writing, memorizing addition 
and multiplication tables, reading for fluency, etc. 
Young, inexperienced teachers are usually turned into 
these classes to try out and shift along until they get 
some control of teaching technique. The children 
are kept drilling and memorizing in preparation for the 
time when they will begin to think and reason. There 
is much marking of time and a great amount of re- 
tardation. Children do not seem to remember what 
they learn, and an excessive amount of drills and re- 
views is necessary. Under this régime average children 
do not show much mental vigor, and teachers do not 
expect much. 
Slandering boys and girls. — If the above descrip- 
tion of what is going on in intermediate grades is correct, 
it is none the less a libel against the real character of 
these boys and girls. By a libel is meant something 
false and defamatory. These children are not sluggish 
by nature. They have been educated into sluggish- 
ness. They have been drugged. At this age they have 
a keen and responsive intelligence. There is no spot in 
the whole course of education between the kindergarten 
and the college where there is such a collected treasure 
of strong and stimulating knowledge suitable to chil- 
dren — stories from literature, poems, ballads, biog- 
raphies of great characters, descriptive projects and 
object lessons in geography and science, stories of travel 
and of invention, dramas and epics, to say nothing of 
actual projects in garden and shop, in laboratory and on 
the playground. 
The real character and quality of these children. — 
Moreover these varied and stimulating thought projects
-P-A-G-E-114
    106 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
have been tried out with children, and their vigorous, 
almost boisterous, response has been demonstrated. 
We are not here straining after a point, trying to pre- 
tend that all children are precocious. But we are try- 
ing to take the measure of the natural mental resources 
of these children. Parents usually think better of their 
children than do the teachers. We smile at the fond 
mothers and hopeful fathers. But perhaps one reason 
why parents think well of their children’s abilities is 
that they know them better. At least they know 
them better in their active moods. The tests com- 
monly made by teachers in the routine work of the 
school are along very narrow drowsy lines, and on 
account of the meagerness and leanness of content are 
wholly inadequate to bring the active powers of children 
tothesurface. For this reason we should require variety 
and strength and bigness of thought, large, active, 
constructive projects, into which children can throw 
themselves spontaneously and let out their full mental 
energies. It is now well known that children from the 
fourth to the sixth grade will plunge into bold industrial 
and social projects and come forth loaded with facts 
and ideas which they will group together and discuss 
with marked intelligence. 
Reasons for sluggishness. — Other reasons may be 
given for the prevailing habit of underestimating the 
intellectual powers of intermediate children. The 
great majority of people still look upon the whole 
elementary curriculum as a drill on forms and symbols, 
a mastery of the tools, rather than the opening up of 
broad and imposing fields of thought in history and 
literature and geography and science. Indeed the
-P-A-G-E-115
  SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 107 
failure to recognize the energies bundled up in these 
children engaged in engrossing thought studies of the 
middle grades is chiefly responsible for the labored 
routine and agonizing dullness of this school period. 
But projects set up desirable achievements in thought, 
and children take to them as the birds take to the air. 
Energizing ideas must have the first place. Ideas, like 
the electric current, may be the least tangible, and yet 
they are the most potential forces in child life. What- 
ever they may lack at first in conscious clearness, they 
more than make up in impulsive energy. 
The healthy mental growth of millions of children at 
stake. — Our main purpose thus far in this chapter has 
been to discover and strengthen the deeper thought 
basis for studies in primary and especially in inter- 
mediate grades. This demand for the thought enrich- 
ment of the school course springs, however, not only 
from the course itself but also from human necessities 
or, we may better say, from the imperatives of child 
nature. We slow teachers are like belated travelers, 
and we should try to catch up with the children. 
The mental happiness and welfare of tens of millions 
of children hinge upon the outcome. Shall these chil- 
dren open their minds intelligently and responsively 
to the plans and purposes of life on its higher planes, 
or shall they be dull plodders in a weary routine? Can 
the foundations of knowledge itself (not a mere acquaint- 
ance with symbols and forms) be laid in the minds of 
children in these middle grades? Should the secrets of 
the world order in which they live be revealed to these 
children in large object lessons, in stories and biog- 
raphy, and in social and industrial projects?
-P-A-G-E-116
  108 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
Preparation for grammar grades. — The preoccupa- 
tion of children and teachers with formal studies has 
had two serious consequences: First, it has produced a 
dull and tedious course of study devoted chiefly to 
memory drills; and, second, it has closed the eyes of 
teachers themselves to the higher intellectual and 
spiritual powers of children and has thus given them 
such a backset that they are not ready for the proper 
studies of the grammar grades when they reach them. 
If, on the contrary, in the middle grades we introduce 
the children to large and engrossing projects and build 
up vital centers of thought along a few important lines, 
they will be well prepared for the expansion of these 
same ideas into new fields. This continuity of develop- 
ing thought from grade to grade on the basis of funda- 
mental ideas is the backbone and spinal cord of a 
genuine course of study. If our thought material in 
these middle grades is formal and feeble and fragmen- 
tary, there is no good thought foundation on which to 
build in grammar grades. 
Grammar-school studies are often a rehash of 
previous work. — In fact the work of the seventh and 
eighth grades up to the present time has consisted 
largely of a tiresome rehash of these earlier unsuccessful 
studies, and a more unsatisfactory and unwholesome 
situation in school affairs is hardly conceivable. The 
children have been over these same topics repeatedly. 
There is little or nothing new, and there is not enough 
of enlargement to constitute a new revelation of the 
subject. A dull review of already dull subjects pro- 
duces an unhappy climax of dullness. This tends 
strongly to become a treadmill system of study in
-P-A-G-E-117
SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 109 
which progress is at a minimum. In the eighth grade, 
teachers are often at their wits’ end to interest and 
hold the children together, to arouse their jaded am- 
bitions. Our present course of study sometimes bars 
the entrance to the fields Elysian; and yet these fields 
are in plain sight just over the fence. 
A close continuity of thought studies. — On the 
supposition that children in the middle grades have 
made some real progress in thought studies and have 
built up strong centers of knowledge and interest, for 
example, in the earlier simpler parts of American 
history and biography, it is easy to see how topics 
growing out of these earlier situations may expand into 
vigorous and liberal studies on a broader scale in the 
grammar school. The success of later studies depends 
upon the right kind of earlier contacts. This is com- 
monly acknowledged, but teachers have failed to see 
that these earlier engagements, to be of the right kind, 
must be rich in thought, grounded in full and stimu- 
lating knowledge of big breezy topics. Why should we 
expect live studies to spring out of earlier dull studies? 
Having once put a quietus on thought and interest in 
intermediate grades, what reason have we for thinking 
that children will suddenly blossom out into strong 
thinkers and enthusiastic students in grammar schools? 
The culminating values in grammar-school studies. 
— The course of study in the common school should 
culminate in grammar grades in a grand layout of noble 
and inspiring projects. The superior content of earlier 
studies gives promise of still more fruitful fields of 
knowledge. Here indeed the portals open wide, and 
the grammar school turns the children into regions of 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  110 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
thought up to the full measure of their mental deserts. 
At this point the large scope of democratic education 
for the people is made clear. It is in these years that 
children should come to a lively consciousness of the real 
character and meaning of our American life — the 
principles and ideals upon which our society is built. 
To make this teaching effective we must have a series 
of really great and inspiring studies: not scraps of in- 
formation, not tedious lists of facts, not skeleton out- 
lines. A few important themes should be elaborated 
and expanded into a convincing demonstration of those 
ideas which have been most active and powerful in 
developing our country and in shaping our institutions. 
History and geography and science have been at work, 
with their sleeves rolled up and their loins girded and 
their minds intent upon the mighty tasks and projects 
that have been achieved in this country during the last 
three hundred years and more. The big topics are the 
significant achievements of our poets, explorers, and 
statesmen, of our merchants and preachers, of our 
editors and railroad builders, of our farmers and manu- — 
facturers, of our scientists and inventors. It is an 
inspiring story not equaled elsewhere in the history of 
the world. 
The Americanized product of the school melting 
pot. — The way to Americanize all the various races of 
children growing up in this country is to let them live 
over again the outstanding typical experiences of the 
men and women who have built American society. 
The purpose of all this is that boys and girls may come 
to a clear understanding of the important things that 
are going on in America to-day. The melting pot

SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 111 
where this higher amalgamation of races takes place is 
the public school, not a dull school but a live, energetic 
school with a vital, regenerating course of study. The 
minds of children must be put into a ferment. The 
thought ingredients cast into this melting pot must 
have a kindling power. Children get a direct experi- 
ence during their growing years of the spirit and achieve- 
ments of America so far and an intelligent outlook 
upon the future based upon such achieved sentiment 
and knowledge. The results aimed at set up an 
educational problem of unsurpassed interest and 
importance. 
Single-minded devotion to the central purpose. — 
All the resources of knowledge of our own nation and 
of the civilization we inherit from Europe are at our 
disposal, and we shall need the best of it all. Buta 
host of trivial things must be overlooked or set aside 
so that we may focus attention upon the main issues, 
the few constructive ideas. We must strip ourselves 
for the race, as the Apostle said, and not be weighted 
down with excess baggage. For with single-minded 
devotion we must follow, through the whole course of 
study, the energetic expansion of a few masterful 
principles of thought. This in a nutshell is the gospel 
of the reorganization of the curriculum. We have now 
discovered that we have at hand and under control the 
abundant streams of refreshing knowledge which pour 
their currents into the channels marked out by these 
curriculum-building ideas. 
The competency of grammar-grade children for 
great studies. — Are the boys and girls of the grammar 
school equal to the task of understanding our political,

social, and industrial life, the spirit and value of our 
Mosaigen institutions? There is much ground for the 
belief that they are not only mentally equipped for 
this great task but that their native mental energy 
demands just this opportunity. To hold them back 
from this kind of achievements is like checking our im- 
petuous boys before the Hindenburg Line. The full 
exploitation of these large teaching units is the only 
means by which we can test the thinking powers of 
children. Experience with such topics as the Panama 
Canal and the British Colonial System gives grounds 
for increased confidence in the mental resources of 
these children. The real question after all is not 
whether children can think but rather whether teachers 
can get ready to lead in these vigorous thought cam- 
paigns. 
In our honest efforts at progress we have made some 
mistakes. The important truths or principles for 
which we contend are now present for the most part in 
our curriculum, but they are not much in evidence; they 
are obscured. They are in the private ranks, not at the 
head of the column. They should be drawn out of 
their deep privacy and obscurity and placed in full 
command. Weare still in the hands of the great rabble 
of commonplace facts, not under the sway of simple, 
illuminating ideas. In our blundering efforts to get 
at the best, we have wasted much time on second-, 
third-, and fourth-class substitutes for the best. 
Unreasonable demands for thought from children. 
— Perhaps the poorest form of teaching is that of pre- 
senting important truths to children in condensed, 
truncated form. This is, however, common practice.
-P-A-G-E-121
  SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 113 
Such abortive instruction results in a mutilation of 
great truths. It is a helpless effort on the part of 
children to interpret important ideas, as it were, in the 
dark, unaccompanied by that setting of practical and 
scholarly information in which the idea reveals itself 
in its full meaning. By this blundering method of 
curt abstraction we strip the subject bare of thought 
elements and then accuse the children of inability to 
think. 
The fact is that under such circumstances even 
teachers are doing precious little thinking but are deal- 
ing out verbal commonplaces and platitudes that have 
no vital force. It is time to put an end to this worse 
than nonsense in teaching. It is a curious and lamen- 
table fact that the data upon which the most important 
truths rest are not supplied in our present curriculum. 
Still more astounding is the fact that few educators 
seem to regard this as a matter of serious consequence. 
We are perpetually demanding, in no uncertain tones, 
vigorous independent thought activity in children, but 
with studied indifference we have gone on in the process 
of denuding all the important topics till they stand out 
as hideous skeletons. They stand alone without sub- 
stance of thought and without relations. 
The remedy. — Strange to say, just at this point 
where educational processes have suffered a complete 
relapse, a slump, we are permitted to discover the 
remedy. These very same standard ideas which in our 
skeletonized modern course have been brought into 
contempt should be raised into honor. 
When the prophet came into the valley of dry bones, 
the Lord said unto him,
-P-A-G-E-122
  114 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
“Son of man, can these bones live?” and he answered, 
“O Lord God, thou knowest.”” 
And the Lord said unto these bones, ‘Behold I will 
cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. And 
I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon 
you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, 
and ye shall live.” 
The resurrection of ideas. — Expressed in the form 
of an allegory this is what should happen to our mum- 
mified course of study. The important ideas which 
have been buried in this graveyard of dry facts must be 
resuscitated, clothed with flesh and blood, filled with 
the breath of life, and sent forth on their educational 
mission. An imposing unit of study which is the em- 
bodiment of a grand idea at work in a complete life 
environment is the only adequate expression of the life 
energy which should characterize every educational 
effort. 
The successful energetic response of children to 
great topics. — It is well known from frequent demon- 
stration in classrooms that boys and girls respond with 
abandon and with determined effort to the impact of 
these masterful topics. They satisfy these children 
with the fullness and richness of their thought content. 
The success which children of intermediate grades 
have had in dealing with large topics like the Erie Canal 
has been more than equaled in grammar grades in 
dealing with topics of still larger scope, such as the 
reconstruction of great cities or the inauguration of 
constitutional government. Such well-organized teach- 
ing units, appropriate to the mental strength of gram- 
mar-grade children, might well be called masterpieces
-P-A-G-E-123
SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 115 
of the teaching art, because they are the outcome of 
long-developing thought processes which culminate 
in grand projects of typical world importance. 
Vital topics must engross the attention of teachers. 
— Somehow the attention of teachers and educators 
should be drawn strongly toward these vital topics, 
these cumulative centers of knowledge as powerful 
units of thought. They need to be discovered and put 
on exhibit till they force the attention of teachers. The 
process of sifting out these important thought units has 
been going on, but it needs to be greatly accelerated. 
It would more than double the significance and value 
of our present course to drop out the poorer two thirds, 
retaining these organic centers of thought for enlarged, 
intensive treatment. That limited fellowship of power- 
ful constructive ideas which has received the deliberate 
sanction of thoughtful teachers, and those more recent 
achievements of human thought which the best experi- 
ence and judgment deem worthy to be placed beside 
the old leaders will surely be recognized as the organiz- 
ing basis for our developing course of study. 
This great problem of reconstruction is now up before 
those who plan and administer the course of study. 
Educators have been repeating and emphasizing the 
demand that children be trained to think. This just 
demand for thought now recoils with redoubled force 
upon our educational leadership. The weakest spot 
in our whole system is the defective thinking of those 
who as leaders assume to make the course of study. 
There has been precious little deliberate, substantial 
thought on this absolutely fundamental problem of the 
organization of the course of study. The course of

116 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
study itself is not so bad, if only our leaders in thought 
knew how to select and utilize its best materials and 
values. It almost appears that our leaders are not doing 
much better thinking now than they did as children back 
in the grades, because they are thinking still on those 
same limited lines. Atleast they fail to break loose from 
these narrow circles of thought and show how to re- 
organize the course on a liberal, comprehensive plan. 
Our leaders have been temporizing with a great and 
serious problem. 
Leaders of thought should not forget to think. — 
The trouble lies in the fact that even in education it 
requires first-class thinkers to conceive and think 
through great thoughts; and if ever there was a profound 
thought problem, it is this of planning the curriculum 
of the common school. 
Excuses. — We have some excellent excuses to offer 
in behalf of those who have not time to think. These 
practical educators are busy about many things — 
many, many other things — and cumbered with many 
cares. The great problem of reorganization must wait 
awhile. Perhaps it will somehow work itself out. 
The result is that in the meantime children too are 
kept busy with many, many other things, are left in a 
maze of half-hearted activities, and do not come out 
into the open fields of thought, do not reach the stage 
of intelligent citizenship. 
The problem of the thinker. — We now need a strong 
leadership in downright educational thought. It must 
be comprehensive and profound. It involves construc- 
tive thinking along practical lines on a life basis. It 
must understand and appreciate children. It must 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  SIGNIFICANCE OF IDEAS 117 
correlate studies on a unified plan. It must bring the 
child and society into a codperative development. In 
the end it should set the child up in the business of 
living in this world to the measure of his opportunities 
and obligations. 
Coéperative thinking. — This vast project of re- 
organizing the-eurrictilum on a sound basis will demand 
the-best-codperative effort-of-profound, devoted think- 
érs, of broad-minded,-efficient administrators, “and of_, 
thoroughly equipped and_—experienced’ “professional 
teachers: It will have to be reénforced by a powerful, 
effective consensus of educated opinion. Clear aims 
and purposes, broadly conceived and _ intelligently 
comprehended, are essential to this reorganization of 
the curriculum on a simple thought basis. 
Bee 
Aldeas furnish the thought centers around which knowledge-is 
organized. 
To get the idea that lies at the basis of any large grouping of 
facts is to illuminate the whole mass with intelligence. 
The scope of a single idea — its far-reaching interpretative power 
— is almost beyond belief. 
A few such ideas seen and realized in their full scope furnish a 
means to the mastery of the world. 
These few ruling ideas simplify the whole vast system of things 
and give man his complete supremacy through the power of intelli- 
gence. 
> The course of study should demonstrate the full organizing power 
of these basal ideas. 
In fact important ideas should have the right of way through 
the course and draw all other things in their train. 
¥ This quality of preéminent leadership possessed by fundamental 
ideas is due to a vital, indestructible energy which is theirs by 
nature. Because of this, Plato called ideas the only realities, all 
other things being derivatives from these vital energies. 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
Ideas are the creative organizers of the world, and in practical 
affairs this is literally true. 
A great inventor like Watt seizes upon a new idea, that of the 
steam engine, and the whole world of transportation and manu- 
facturing must be reorganized around that idea. 
Pasteur discovers the germ idea of disease and the whole science 
of medicine has to be reconstructed. Pasteur curiously was not a 
physician, and yet by virtue of his idea he compelled all physicians 
to take notice and to reconstruct their practice. 
Sterility of thought in school studies is another name for lack 
of ideas. 
“Our present course of study is too much given to the smothering 
of ideas, especially the important ones. 
> A great man is one who is large-minded enough to grasp one of 
these ideas with its life-building energy. 
Can children grasp these secrets of world knowledge and build 
up a thought-world that corresponds to and interprets the world of 
experience? 
The primary school has already made a good start in the culti- 
vation of ideas as a basis for knowledge. 
y The intermediate grades are still largely devoted to the traditional 
‘routine of formal studies, and the grammar grades go on repeating 
a long series of dull generalities. 
» In intermediate grades we should start in with a luminous and 
inspiring treatment of a few great ideas in the shape of typical 
life projects and then continue this series of great and simple 
studies through the grammar grades. 
A few ideas worked out continuously and connectedly are 
enough upon which to construct a course of study. 
We shall have to place some faith in the thinking power of chil- 
dren, and we shall need the teachers who can keep well in advance 
of the children in reflective and constructive thought. 
Leaders in education have been demanding that children be re- 
quired to think. By all odds, yes! But these leaders themselves 
should think more soundly. They are responsible for securing a 
course of study which has the elements of thought in proper solu- 
tion. Otherwise their talk is an overflow of rank hypocritical cant.

CHAPTER IV 
TYPICAL LIFE PROJECTS AND 
ILLUSTRATIONS 
The difficulties of reconstruction. — Reorganizing 
the course of study on the basis of typical life projects 
is an undertaking of no small magnitude. The present 
vast framework of studies with the habits and _tradi- 
tions that cluster about it must be treated with respect, 
its good features preserved, and its faults corrected. 
The radical changes already made and those now in 
progress are proof sufficient that it is to be a process of 
deliberate reconstruction on a large scale. It is to be 
remembered also that more than a half-million teachers 
and above twenty million children are to be housed in 
this educational building while the repairs and recon- 
struction are in progress. It reminds one of the torn-up 
condition of New York’s streets, the mingling of traffic 
and reconstruction along Broadway while the subway 
was under construction. A brief survey and summary 
of the difficulties necessarily involved in this recon- 
struction may serve as a preface to the arduous un- 
dertakingy first, the present miscellaneousness and 
congestion of studies due to rapid and spasmodic 
accumulations of new materials; second, the inevitable 
reduction of studies to skeleton outlines due to these 
overaccumulations; third, a natural unwillingness to 
abandon outworn and obsolete subjects which have 
120
-P-A-G-E-129
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 121 
long held a respectable place in the course; fourth, 
a complete isolation of each study as if there were no 
important relations with others; fifth, an emphasis on 
dry factual knowledge with little grouping of facts 
around thought centers and, in consequence, a very 
serious lack of steady growth in fundamental ideas 
from year to year. 
This predominance of the factual over the thought 
elements produces a dry iteration of facts instead of a 
strong growth of stimulating thought. In brief the 
present course of study shows little respect for organ- 
ized thinking and for the fundamental connections. 
The quantitative bulk prevails over the qualitative 
idea, and higher standards of value are lost to view. 
We now emphasize a multitude of trivial things, and 
the important things are treated in a trivial way. In- 
stead of minimum essentials our present course might 
better be named a maximum of nonessentials. 
In the natural course of things the textbooks are the 
summing up and expression of the present status, com- 
bining its merits and its faults, its orders and its dis- 
orders, its expanding elements and its confusions. The 
most convincing proof that could be given of the five 
points stated above would be a compulsory effort to 
teach well the whole range ,of school studies as laid 
down in the regular textbooks. 
An expedition after big game. — A flat proposal is 
now made to reorganize studies around central teaching 
units. We have a plan to mass attention and effort 
upon the strategic centers of knowledge, to wage war 
against ignorance by a bold and resolute attack upon 
afew strongholds. These few knowledge centers should 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
    122 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
be expanded till they fill the whole horizon of thought 
while a multitude of less important items should dwindle 
until they disappear from view. We can now afford to 
drop the popguns and toy pistols, seize the long-range 
rifle, and go out for big game. 
The best exhibit yet made of this new style of 
organization of studies around vital thought centers 
is found in typical life projects. The project has made 
its appearance and has come into prominence at a time 
of need. The demand for rallying points as centers of 
organization never before has been felt so keenly. 
What are these typical life projects which, brought to 
the front and clothed in full panoply, are to be the 
active agents in this great enterprise? 
What are projects? — The ordinary meaning of the 
term “project’’ in the common affairs of life hits the 
point exactly. Projects are enterprises undertaken by 
boys or girls or by men and women looking toward 
desired results. Boys come together and agree to form 
a club and to fix up a baseball diamond where they can 
play the game. Business men and capitalists form a 
company for surveying and building arailroad. Women 
organize a club for social purposes. Little girls con- 
struct and fit up a playhouse. A general plans a cam- 
paign. A boy builds a sled in anticipation of a snow. 
Projects are as numerous and varied as human minds 
are active and enterprising. 
The boy preparing for his spring garden has a 
specific enterprise which looks toward a definite result. 
The architect planning and supervising the construc- 
tion of a schoolhouse combines with others in working 
out a project. All such projects are in the midst of
-P-A-G-E-131

life; they are directly responsive to practical needs 
and expressive of the life energy. 
The typical project.— A typical life project is one 
which exhibits in concrete demonstration a principle 
of wide scope which later comes to the front again in 
a score or a hundred other like projects. This demon- 
strated principle is the clarifying thought that interprets 
a whole series, running, it may be, into thousands. 
Fulton’s project for constructing the first steamboat 
was the objective demonstration of a typical machine 
which embodies the idea of all later steamboats and 
steamships. It gave a new and permanent direction 
to vast energies heretofore wasted. 
Five features of projects. — The project has been 
seized upon recently and used as a powerful instrument 
in carrying on the work of education. A rapid survey 
of the meaning and scope of projects will show their 
positive influence upon instruction and upon the or- 
ganization of the curriculum. 
1. Projects may be grouped into those of children 
and those of adults, although they frequently overlap. 
Nothing better illustrates the child’s real thoughts and 
impulses than the projects he is busied with — from 
building blocks to tree houses and gardening. Like- 
wise nothing better betrays the character of the man 
than his enterprises of the project type from business 
to pleasure. From childhood to old age the test of 
character and achievement is found in the projects 
conceived and carried out. 
2. Projects are individual or social. Children com- 
bine in social undertakings and work out codperative 
schemes. Adults do the same on a larger scale. The

biography of a great man is the record of his successful 
venture, as Columbus’ great project or Hannibal’s 
expedition against Rome. The life of David Living- 
stone is the absorbing story of his exploring and mis- 
sionary projects in Africa, and so with Benjamin 
Franklin and Florence Nightingale and Cecil Rhodes. 
Cities have their municipal projects and nations their 
national achievements, as the pyramids of Egypt and 
the old Roman roads. The chief project of Peter the 
Great was the founding of the city which bears his 
name. The business world in all its leading aspects is 
a world of projects, of vast commercial, agricultural, 
manufacturing, and mining enterprises. 
3. The project attracts attention to itself because it 
contains a powerful initial impulse. Everybody is an 
eager spectator of an important beginning enterprise. 
It embodies the spirit of endeavor and achievement.* 
The dynamic element is at its maximum. It calls into 
action and organizes individual and social energies and 
urges on to results. Because of the progressive idea 
involved in one project it is not satisfied but pushes on 
to other similar achievemerits. Columbus was only 
the first great explorer; others follow. A real project 
has a second and third stage in its history. It lives 
several lives and continues to prolong its ear Its 
energy does not waste. 
4. The project demands wise forethought in plan- 
ning. It looks far ahead and counts the cost. It is 
thoroughly rational in its requirement of sound think- 
ing as a basis for later action. It must satisfy the 
conditions of life and is in this sense strictly practical. 
The later execution of the project enforces this 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 125 
practical adjustment to absolute necessities. The proj- 
ect surpasses all formal school studies in this subordi- 
nation of conduct to the blunt requirements of real life. 
5. In the two stages of its development the project 
is a complete demonstration of the combined inductive- 
deductive method in learning. It is tied down at the 
start, and strictly, to a full exhibit of one concrete 
example, and this is followed by other examples till a 
sound basis of induction is reached. The evolution of 
the type and its variations and applications to new 
cases provide further induction and deduction. This 
fundamental thought movement brings facts and ideas 
into proper relations and gives the true balance between 
facts and growing ideas. The ideas develop out of the 
proper grouping and sequence of the facts. 
The deeper concord between child and adult. — 
These five strong features of the developing project 
are significant for the child and are equally significant 
for the adult. In dealing with projects, therefore, the 
child and the adult show a remarkable concord of 
spirit. The difference is in the size and scope of proj- 
ects, not in their fundamental nature. This harmony 
of spirit between the child and adult is further shown 
by the child’s early and frequent imitation of adult 
projects. By virtue of their imitative instinct chil- 
dren from the earliest years are constantly encroach- 
ing upon the projects of adults, playing doctor or 
schoolmaster, mother or father, builder, farmer, hunter, 
etc. They copy likewise the games and recreations of 
their elders, as baseball, horseback riding, etc. 
Children’s thoughts are turned toward the larger 
world. — A study of children’s playthings, including 
 
-P-A-G-E-134

126 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
miniature tools, machines, and apparatus, will show a 
remarkable leaning toward engines and railroads, auto- 
mobiles, wagons, garden tools, guns and firearms, 
hunting and fishing tackle, airplanes, tool chests and 
equipment, boats and ships, printing presses and type, 
trolley cars, looms and weaving apparatus, stoves and 
household furnishings. Children of their own choice 
are certainly on the direct road toward adulthood. 
These things show moreover that children are step- 
ping over boldly into the larger social and industrial 
world. They are concerned about world projects. 
They go not only to the picture shows and circus but 
to the church. The Sunday school is getting to be as 
important as the church itself. Children’s social parties 
sometimes even interfere with school work. The boys 
with their wireless equipment at home are listening 
in and are disturbing the wave movements reserved 
for the world’s news. The newsboys are a very impor- 
tant contingent in the newspaper business, and we are 
impelled to make laws to keep children out of the fac- 
tories and in the schools. The call of the world is too 
strong for many boys and girls in grammar grades and 
even lower, and they “skip.” Boys and girls read the 
newspapers and know as much about the Panama 
Canal project probably as their fathers and mothers. 
In spite of the school the big industrial projects going 
on in the world reach the children and stir their blood. 
In reality the big projects of the modern business and 
political world are what children crave. As stated 
before, there is an inner concord between child enter- 
prise and world doings. The typical life project is 
the ‘open sesame”’ which admits children to the great
-P-A-G-E-135
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 127 
secrets of the world order, to the principal buildings 
and departments of the world exposition. The child 
is reaching out after his birthright of world experience 
whether the school helps or hinders. 
The project is a means of vital contact and identifi- 
cation of the child’s own spirit with the ongoing proc- 
esses of the world life. It offers the same freedom 
and scope to the human spirit that the actual world 
order allows and encourages. Yet in spite of its varia- 
bility the typical life project always develops in its 
school treatment through two marked stages which can 
be sharply defined and plainly illustrated: first, an indi- 
vidual concrete manifestation of the basal idea; second, 
the expansion of the idea through a process of compari- 
son and reflection developing into a series of projects. 
Children’s projects. — We may mention three types 
of projects that play an important part in teaching; 
the first is the child’s own project which springs directly 
from a personal need and desire; for example, the little 
girl making a doll bed. She finds some boards and 
with small hammer and saw and nails shapes and 
fashions a bed for her doll. The boy in the yard 
plans and builds a tree house, or he may make a chest 
in which to store his tools, or the boy and girl together 
may plan and work out a home garden. A group of 
boys are seen constructing a cave house or an Indian 
tepee for such uses as they further have at heart. 
There is an infinite variety of these self-chosen tasks, 
individual and social, which children devise and exe- 
cute — the more, the better. 
Suggested projects. — A second type is one under- 
taken by children at the suggestion of the teacher, as
-P-A-G-E-136

128 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
dramatizing A story of Damon and Pythias, a game 
with bean bags with the purpose of counting scores, 
the cutting of colored-paper forms for decorating the 
schoolroom, the making of costumes to suit the different 
actors in a play, preparing the working drawings to 
show how to build a playhouse, writing a composition 
explaining how to plan a picnic dinner, making a model 
to show the construction of a canal lock, the devising 
of a homemade telephone, the preparation of an 
aquarium, planning a spelling match, finding a story 
to be read for the entertainment of the class. Almost 
any lesson can be converted into a project by shrewd 
suggestion on the part of the teacher, and in many 
cases an added interest and zest are given to the class 
instruction by such devices. The so-called city gov- 
ernment by which children organize themselves into 
an assembly for discussing matters of common or social 
interest is a form of project. A good project is usually 
a means of encouraging self-direction and initiative. 
The resourcefulness and ingenuity of teachers may be 
exercised in full measure in suggesting valuable proj- 
ects and in encouraging children to select and work 
out their own projects. 
Larger life projects. — A third type, or project enter- 
prise, is found in the larger world of human affairs 
where men and women are engaged in the serious 
business of life; as the first Atlantic cable, the con- 
struction of Brooklyn Bridge, the organization of a 
political party, the construction and management of a 
city waterworks, the writing and publishing of a book 
or of a newspaper, the survey and construction of a 
railroad, the preparation and passage of a tariff bill in  
-P-A-G-E-137
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 129 
Congress, the building and operation of a cotton mill, 
the survey and layout of a city park, the invention of 
the sewing machine. The great world of action out- 
side of school is busy with projects. It is a world of 
men and women engaged and absorbed in planning 
and executing a host of varied enterprises. Most of 
the natural undertakings of children suggested above 
are small introductory projects leading up to these 
larger, mature schemes of adults. They are often 
miniature reproductions of the larger actions seen in 
their elders; as setting up a store, keeping school, 
building playhouses, playing the doctor, fishing and 
hunting, and games. This project plan furnishes a 
natural and continuous development through spon- 
taneous, engrossing typical activities from early child- 
hood and youth to the responsible undertakings of 
adult life and of society in its still larger social enter- 
prises. Here is an educational ladder, a process that 
is continuous and constructive throughout the whole 
period of life. It is all of one piece. 
The broom-corn project.— An example of this 
growth from simple local beginnings to larger and 
yet larger dealings with the world is the broom-corn 
project worked out recently in one of the Cincinnati 
schools. By some accident (the birds probably dropped 
the seed), a broom-corn stalk came up in the school 
yard. It was discovered by the children, and care 
and attention was given to it so that it developed and 
matured its seed. The suggestion was made and fol- 
lowed up that it would be well to save the seed and 
raise a crop the next season. On a small, not very 
promising plot the seeds were planted the following  
-P-A-G-E-138
    130 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
spring and the plants cultivated till quite a fine crop 
of broom corn was raised. It proved to be of excellent 
quality for broom making, and the children became 
interested in the process of broom manufacture. They 
brought in some old brooms and pulled them to pieces 
to see how they were constructed. It became known 
that there was a broom factory not far from the school, 
and an excursion followed and an observation of the 
raw materials, machines, and working processes made. 
Written accounts followed from this excursion. It was 
decided to harvest carefully the crop of broom corn 
and have it made up into brooms. As a result, to the 
delight of the children, thirty-five brooms were returned 
to the school. The interest in this subject continued 
and several factories were found to be located in the 
city. The Government bulletins on broom-corn cul- 
ture were sent for and studied, the children writing the 
letters. It was found that Kentucky and Ohio were 
important broom-corn states, but other states, as 
Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma, produced the largest 
quantities. A map of a dozen or more of the impor- 
tant states producing broom corn was made by coloring 
an outline map and the production of each state was 
placed in figures on this map. A natural result also 
was a.comparison of broom corn with maize and an 
estimate of the relative profit per acre from broom 
corn and maize. Beginning in this small way this 
topic developed into gardening and agriculture, factory 
processes and machinery, collection and distribution of 
products by commercial routes, and a survey of this 
business in its geographical extension. It is a good 
type of the raw production in agriculture, its passing
-P-A-G-E-139
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 131 
into manufacture and commercial handling, and the 
sale of the finished product. It involves a whole series 
of connected purposeful projects. 
The Nashville stockade and an Indian project. — At 
Nashville a project of particular interest to children is 
the reproduction in miniature form of the old stockade 
or fort consisting of log houses and palisades and 
massive wooden gate. Still another project connected 
with this old rectangular wooden fort is suggested by the 
lively story of the last desperate effort by the Indians to 
capture the place — a project showing Indian strategy. 
In some thick bushes on the hill slope, a quarter of a 
mile below the fort, a large force of Indian warriors was 
placed in ambush. The following morning a small 
body of Indians on horseback rode up toward the gate 
as if to attack it. This was a challenge to the brave 
men within the fort to battle. Robertson and a 
dozen or more men on horseback threw open the gate 
and rode out to meet them. After a little skirmishing 
the Indians retreated down the slope, the white men 
pursuing. When the whites were a half-mile from the 
fort, the Indians sprang from their ambush and shut 
off the retreat. The white men then dismounted in 
readiness to fight and their horses being released gal- 
loped back toward the fort. Many of the Indians ran 
off to capture these loose horses. Mrs. Robertson, in 
the fort, seeing the dangerous plight of the men, threw 
open the gate and let loose some fifty fierce dogs that 
were kept within. These dogs, barking and growling 
as they went, made a furious dash upon the Indians. 
While the Indians were chasing the horses and fighting 
these furious dogs, the white men managed to break
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
through the line and reach the fort, leaving a few of 
their companions dead on the field. This was the last 
effort made by the Indians to capture Nashborough. 
This local story of Indian warfare and of a stockaded 
fort at Nashville suggests others of similar character in 
Kentucky and Ohio and in other states east and west. 
An exactly similar effort was made by the Indians to 
capture Boonesboro, and Daniel Boone was severely 
wounded and earried back into the fort by his friend 
Simon Kenton. Braddock’s defeat, in which Wash- 
ington figured, was due to a similar ambuscade by 
Indians. The battle of Oriskany on the Mohawk and 
St. Clair’s defeat in Ohio show the same type of Indian 
strategy. The more extended study of the struggle of 
the Indians with the whites in America will reveal the 
fact that the attack on Nashborough interprets the 
spirit and method of Indian warfare in this country for 
three hundred years. Thus the study of a local history 
topic and the working out of local projects wisely used 
throw a strong light upon a whole succession of impor- 
tant topics throughout our history. 
Home projects open the way into the big world. — 
Home projects like these, springing out of the direct 
environment of children and suitable to their needs, 
open the gates and make a clear passageway to many 
of the most important topics in later study. 
In intermediate grades we come in contact with 
those larger projects in history, geography, science, and 
literature, which open up important sections of that 
beckoning world that lies just beyond the home, though 
dealing with subjects intimately related to the home 
interests. The vastness and variety of knowledge
-P-A-G-E-141
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 133 
materials offered at this entrance upon the larger world 
and its seeming complexity compel us to exercise our 
best wisdom in selecting the types to be studied. 
Teachers have been struggling with this problem for 
years but the inrush of new studies and the swift in- 
crease in modern educational needs have kept the 
curriculum expanding into larger and yet larger dimen- 
sions. The time now has come to reorganize. We are 
face to face with a serious problem of reconstruction on 
a big, comprehensive, and simple plan. 
Examples of major projects. — Under the pressure 
of this excessive modern curriculum the demand for 
simplification on the basis of a few central projects 
has grown steadily stronger. Teachers have been ex- 
panding their minds to take in the larger proportions 
of these major units of knowledge. In the place of 
the present tedious and almost endless enumeration 
of facts and items, a limited group of major projects is 
set up, each of which exercises dominion over a large 
field of knowledge; for example, the purchase of 
Louisiana, which set the pace for our vast territorial 
expansion; the framing of our Federal Constitution 
of 1787, whose governmental structure after a cen- 
tury’s growth is the most imposing political fabric in 
the world; the steel production at Pittsburgh, one of 
the outstanding enterprises of modern capital; Bur- 
goyne’s campaign in the Revolution with its far-reach- 
ing results; the growth of the Pennsylvania Railroad 
System to its colossal influence upon national traffic; 
the influx of foreign people and the effects of immigra- 
tion upon the growth of the United States; the inven- 
tion and progressive use of the steam engine in its

various forms; the engineering and sanitary problem 
of the Chicago water supply and drainage. These 
genuine projects are colossal in size, simple in thought, 
and concrete in demonstration. They bring into bold 
relief the prominent forces at work in human affairs. 
Big projects interpret modern life. — The organiza- 
tion of such teaching units, while comprehensive in 
scope, is simple and natural in orderly development. 
Such bold object lessons frame up the world to chil- 
dren in grand pictures and panoramic surveys. The 
Brooklyn Bridge, the Panama Canal, a battle fleet, 
and a flying squadron of airplanes are quite as striking 
and wonderful as Aladdin’s palace or the adventures 
of Hercules and of other demigods of the olden time. 
These vast projects of our own age are expressions of 
the brawny and brainy builders of our new world. 
They formulate the plans and work out the processes 
of our modern institutional life, such as city govern- 
ments, churches, universities, insurance companies, 
canals and traffic routes, ocean steamship lines, mining, 
manufacturing, and banking companies, publishing 
houses, and metropolitan newspapers. Expanded into 
complete and powerful object lessons, they interpret 
the modern world in its predominant activities. They 
are the strategic centers of enterprising thought, and 
it would be safe to surmise that they are destined to 
be the chief constituent units in reconstructing the 
curriculum. | 
The project unit applied to various studies. — We 
may observe in schools of all grades from primary to 
university unmistakable tendencies among curriculum 
makers to adopt the large unit, or type-study plan.
-P-A-G-E-143
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 135 
Even the recent textbooks in history and geography 
show strong symptoms of this reconstructive principle 
at work. Sufficient numbers of these large organized 
topics have been worked out and tested in classroom 
instruction to form a basis for judging their value as 
standard measuring units for class work, and as aground 
plan for the progressive reconstruction of the curricu- 
lum. This plan should be deliberately tested out as 
fast as the central topics in the main thought studies 
are selected and brought into well-organized, elaborate 
treatment. For reading and literature many of the 
standard units have been selected and put to service, 
even in the earlier grades, as ‘Aladdin,’ ‘Ulysses’ 
Adventures,’ ‘Hiawatha,’ and “Robinson Crusoe.” 
Nature study and applied science furnish excellent 
themes for the monographic treatment of fundamental 
types, as the life history of the milkweed butterfly, 
the story of the beaver, a squirrel family; the biograph- 
ical stories of important discoveries and inventions, 
as Gorgas’ experience with yellow fever, Stephenson’s 
first locomotive and its application to railroading, 
Howe’s sewing machine, Morse’s telegraph, and Mar- 
coni’s wireless. Many of the important topics in 
history and geography are best conceived of as compre- 
hensive projects, for such they were in very fact, as 
Peter the Great’s founding of Petrograd, Luther’s trans- 
lation of the Bible, Magellan’s venturesome voyage, 
the Suez Canal, the Eads’ jetties at the Mississippi 
Delta, the Niagara water-power project. 
New Orleans treated as a series of projects. — A 
recent and apt illustration of the large projects is the 
harbor improvement now under way at New Orleans.

136 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
The history of New Orleans for a hundred and twenty 
years and more is the stirring account of a progressive 
series of expanding projects. The first settlement 
under D’Iberville was a scheme of expansion by the 
French. The purchase of Louisiana under Jefferson’s 
direction was a project for getting control of the 
mouth of the Mississippi River as an outlet for the 
commerce of the great valley. Its other possibilities 
were so great that statesmen were dazed by its magni- 
tude, and many thought the purchase price so extrava- 
gant that it would bankrupt the Treasury. 
The levees and jetties. — For a hundred years New 
Orleans has been deeply concerned in the construction 
of levees as a means of protecting the city from dis- 
astrous floods, recurring each springtime. For many 
years the shallow mud bars at the delta’s mouths pre- 
vented the entrance of ocean vessels and almost ruined 
the city’s commerce. Captain Eads’ wisely conceived 
project of building the willow-mattress jetties as a 
means of producing a deep passage through this 
shallow mud bar was worked out with full success and 
completely removed this obstruction to river com- 
merce. This has been descriptively worked out and 
used as & typical life project in river improvement. 
A problem of increasing difficulty at New Orleans 
has been that of handling the growing volume of 
products coming by ship from abroad and by railroad 
and river from the interior. At the river front where 
ships and railroads meet, it has been necessary to work 
out a series of imposing projects for harbor improve- 
ment including wharves, warehouses, and dock ma- 
chinery for the handling of goods. The numerous
-P-A-G-E-145
PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 137 
railroads centering at New Orleans and the thirty- 
eight lines of ocean steamers that dock along the river 
front have brought on a steady increase of traffic in a 
great variety of staple products. 
Effect of the Panama Canal. — The completion of 
the Panama Canal and its opening to world traffic have 
had a powerful influence toward increasing the com- 
merce of New Orleans and in the future are likely to 
increase it more and more. It not only opens the 
way for big traffic along the west coast of North and 
South America but also with eastern Asia and Aus- 
tralia. The development of trade with South America 
and Mexico alone offers an immense traffic, and the 
shortening of trade routes to the countries surrounding 
the Pacific Ocean may shift a large part of the American 
trade to New Orleans. New Orleans is about 600 
miles nearer to Panama than is New York City. The 
products of the Mississippi Valley, the production 
center of the United States, can be shipped much more 
cheaply to New Orleans than to New York, Phila- 
delphia, and other Atlantic ports. Even in sending 
products to European countries, New Orleans is a 
nearer and cheaper port than New York for a large 
part of the Mississippi Valley. The concentration of 
great railroad lines at New Orleans, even without the 
river traffic, is bringing a vast quantity of raw products 
into New Orleans. The competition of the river 
traffic with rail routes will keep railroad rates down at 
all times, because the lower Mississippi River is open 
to traffic throughout the whole year. It does not 
seem unreasonable that the natural drift of commerce 
down the Mississippi which was so strong in the early 
 
-P-A-G-E-146

! 
1388 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
history of the great valley should be restored, and 
products on a large scale should find their natural out- 
let to the markets of the world through New Orleans. 
This increasing concentration of world commerce at 
New Orleans has brought out the fact that the eight 
miles of dockage along the river front are totally 
inadequate to meet present and future demands. 
The Inner Harbor or Industrial Canal project. — In 
addition to the docks and harbor advantages along the 
river front for many miles, the Dock Board has re- 
cently undertaken a great engineering project which 
will double the shipping and harbor advantages of 
New Orleans. This project is known as the new 
Inner Harbor or Industrial Canal. The Inner Harbor, 
already well under way, opens up a new outlet to the 
sea for the commerce of New Orleans by way of Lake 
Pontchartrain. 
On the east side of the city a broad and deep canal 
is being excavated which reaches from the river back 
to Lake Pontchartrain. A deep channel through the 
lake and a passage out into the deep water of the 
Gulf will be dredged out so that large ocean vessels 
may come into the city harbor by this new passage. 
The distance to the sea is only about half as great 
as the way down the river and through the jetties. 
This Industrial Canal is six miles in length from 
the river to the lake and three hundred feet wide. 
One great advantage of this Inner Harbor is that 
the water remains nearly at the same level, which is 
really sea level with little tide, while the River changes 
more than twenty feet between low and high water. 
This new harbor will thus be more convenient for 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 139 
loading and unloading ships. At the river end of the 
canal is a lock six hundred feet long and seventy- 
five feet wide and thirty feet deep, which will allow 
large vessels to pass back and forth between the open 
river and the Inner Harbor. At any stage of water 
in the river, vessels can pass through the lock into the 
Inner Harbor with its fixed level. About a mile back 
from the river entrance to the canal, it broadens out 
into a turning basin for ships, one thousand feet by 
eight hundred and fifty feet. At one end of this turn- 
ing basin is an eighty-acre shipyard, and another large 
shipbuilding plant is located at the lake end of the 
canal. 
The Dock Board at the present time is spending 
about twelve million dollars on this new Inner Harbor, 
but it is estimated that the work when fully completed 
with a thirty-five foot passage to the open sea will 
cost twenty-five millions. Along the sides of this new 
Inner Harbor will be built docks, sheds, and warehouses 
for the movement and storage of goods. On both 
sides of this broad canal private companies can estab- 
lish packing houses, steel rolling mills, coal and lumber 
yards, shipyards, automobile works, flour mills, chemical 
works, and warehouses of all kinds. At the river 
entrance to the canal the Government of the United 
States has built three great depot warehouses six 
stories high and a wharf and wharf house nearly 
half a mile long. 
The Inner Harbor is also served by the Public Belt 
Railroad which connects the river front and all the 
docks and railroads. 
It is called the Industrial Canal, because it supplies
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
opportunity for the establishment of all kinds of 
private industries which was not possible along the 
river front. It also offers an easy approach for coal 
barges from Alabama and for lumber and other raw 
materials coming in from the coastal regions. 
New Orleans has also been deeply concerned with 
projects that relate to the improvement of navigation 
along the Mississippi River and its great tributaries. 
Deep waterways to the Gulf. — A group of impor- 
tant projects for improving the Mississippi River navi- 
gation has been brought to public notice frequently of 
late years, known as the ‘‘deep waterways to the 
Gulf.” It has been seriously proposed to make a 
deep, wide, twelve-foot passage for large boats and 
barges from Chicago down_the Illinois to the Missis- 
sippi River. This would open the way for a cheap 
traffic in heavy products from Chicago to New Orleans 
and return. The Chicago Drainage Canal project, 
costing many millions, already supplies forty miles 
of such a deep waterway, and by extending it down 
the Illinois and by deepening the lower Illinois River 
such a cheap and commodious water route can be 
provided. The Illinois Legislature at one time ap- 
proved the construction of this deep waterway at an 
expense of twenty million dollars. In like manner the 
upper Ohio from Pittsburgh to the Mississippi, and the 
upper Mississippi from St. Paul down were to be 
deepened and made navigable for large steamboats and 
barges. 
If these plans should be carried out, as is not un- 
likely, a rapid increase in river traffic on these great 
Western rivers may follow, and the trade of New
-P-A-G-E-149
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 141 
Orleans with the upper Mississippi Valley will be much 
increased. The eastbound trunk railroads which now 
carry most of the heavy products eastward to New 
York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Baltimore would 
naturally object. 
It has been claimed also by some traffic experts 
that the river traffic will never be restored, first, be- 
cause the railroads are so much speedier in loading 
and transporting goods and, second, because the load- 
ing and unloading of heavy goods along the river 
wharves are so difficult and expensive. We know, 
however, that the water traffic on the lakes and East- 
ern rivers like the Hudson is very extensive; also on 
the rivers of Europe. The Panama Canal on the 
ocean side opening up world traffic and the deep water- 
ways on the land side gathering products cheaply from 
the whole Mississippi Valley are likely to greatly in- 
crease the importance of New Orleans as a world port. 
Manufacturing projects. — In working over cheap 
raw products into manufactured forms New Orleans 
has already made great progress. The sugar refiner- 
ies, the rice-cleaning plants, the great ship-building 
yards, the flour mills, the packing houses, the planing 
mills and woodworking plants, the canneries for 
syrups, the iron foundries, and machine shops are 
examples of these industrial projects already developed. 
New Orleans has peculiar and even remarkable ad- 
vantages for developing manufactures: first, the vast 
quantity and variety of cheap raw products constantly 
pouring into the city from the Mississippi Valley and 
from foreign countries; second, a great abundance of 
cheap fuel in coal, petroleum, gas, and wood; third,  
-P-A-G-E-150
Ne ee em Ten ee eet er Pe Ee Ten are Te ee Cm 
142 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
cheap and abundant transportation of goods in many 
directions both by water and by rail; fourth, plenty 
of reasonably cheap and contented labor; fifth, a 
mild climate with less expense for food, clothing, and 
housing. 
The construction of the new Inner Harbor is designed 
largely to furnish a good location on deep water for 
the establishment of manufacturing plants where raw 
materials, fuel, and transport are most inexpensive and 
easy. It is probable that New Orleans now stands 
at the beginning of a vast increase in her manufacturing 
activities. 
A strong combination of influences. — It is worth 
while observing that a commanding seaport like New 
Orleans, furnishing the central commercial outlet to 
an immense valley and river system for a century and 
more, has been directly and vitally interested in a 
succession of costly projects far and near, including 
the jetties, the river levees, the local harbor improve- 
ments, the deep water navigation of the Ohio and 
upper Mississippi, the Panama Canal, and the estab- 
lishment of industrial plants. The projecting of steam- 
ship lines and railroads centering here have been like- 
wise an expression in large part of the enterprising 
spirit of the people. In the execution of all these 
imposing projects, the city, the State Government, 
and the United States Government have made large 
contributions, while engineers like Captain Eads and 
statesmen like Jefferson have also greatly contributed 
to these successful ventures. 
Comparisons. — Before leaving this topic it will be 
profitable to set up a comparison of these New Orleans  
-P-A-G-E-151
PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 143 
projects with similar important harbor improvements 
and excavations at Galveston and Houston. Among 
these are the massive sea wall at Galveston for the 
protection of city and harbor, the opening of a deep 
passage up the bayou to Houston, and the excavation 
of a broad turning basin within the city limits. Ocean 
vessels now sail into the great bay, up this deep passage 
to the turning basin and unload and load their cargoes 
at the Houston docks and warehouses. 
Galveston and Houston. — Galveston and Houston 
with numerous railroads radiating into Texas, Okla- 
homa, and other states control an extensive trade area 
in the Southwest and compete with New Orleans for 
cotton, rice, lumber, and other products. The number 
of railroad lines centering at Houston, as shown on a 
railroad map, is equal to that of New Orleans. New 
Orleans has the advantage, however, of the river trade, 
whatever that may be worth. 
San Francisco. — Although San Francisco has a 
magnificent natural harbor, the increase of trade which 
followed the opening of the Panama Canal has stimu- 
lated expensive harbor improvements, such as the con- 
struction of extensive docks and the excavation of a 
deep harbor channel and the building of a sea wall at 
Oakland across the bay from San Francisco. 
Los Angeles. — On the coast to the south of Los 
Angeles, at San Pedro, a large outer and inner harbor 
has been developed under the protection of a break- 
water extending two miles into the sea. This was 
constructed by the Government at an expense of three 
million dollars as a part of the harbor improvement. 
But the Mississippi Valley which forms the hinterland 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    144 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
for New Orleans and Houston is far greater in extent 
and production than the valleys of California on the 
Western coast. 
Portland. — At the mouth of the Columbia a shallow 
and dangerous bar obstructed the entrance of vessels 
en route to Portland. Storms and fogs added to the 
dangers of this river entrance. At great expense the 
Government has constructed jetties and opened a deep 
passage for ocean vessels, which reminds us of the 
similar project at the mouth of the Mississippi. Port- 
land like New Orleans is about one hundred miles 
from the mouth of the river. Which has the better 
position for developing trade, Portland on the lower 
Columbia or New Orleans on the Mississippi? 
The Atlantic seaports.— The Atlantic seaboard 
cities, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and others, 
have likewise undertaken vast harbor improvements. 
Examples of this are the blowing up of the rocks and 
the opening of a clear passage at Hell Gate, New York, 
and the dredging out of the great bar just outside of 
the Narrows so as to open a deep passage for ocean 
ships into the New York harbor. The cities on the 
Great Lakes, Chicago and Cleveland and others, have 
excavated deep passageways along the channels of 
their small rivers to handle the immense shipping de- 
veloped on these inland waters. 
National scope of these projects.— From these 
numerous and important examples of costly projects 
in the way of harbor extension and wharf construction 
we may draw the conclusion that the development of 
world traffic centering in our chief seaport cities has 
been one of the marked features of progress on a world
-P-A-G-E-153
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 145 
scale and has produced a series of great national enter- 
prises of the first rank. 
Port projects in Europe. — Indeed a later comparison 
with European port cities will show that they have 
been engaged in still larger projects. Glasgow during 
a century spent a hundred million dollars on her river 
dredging and harbor excavations and dock construc- 
tion. Liverpool, Antwerp, Hamburg, Marseilles, and 
Petrograd have forged to the front in vast harbor- 
expansion projects. 
By following this line of thought to its natural 
consequences we are convinced that the progressive 
nations of the world in the last hundred years have 
been turning a large part of their wealth and energy 
into projects of harbor extension. The increase in 
size and draft of ocean vessels and the development of 
a vast merchant marine have brought on a more ex- 
tensive interchange of products between all nations, 
and the great seaport cities have been compelled to 
expand and duplicate their harbor facilities. The 
future development of international exchange along 
the ocean highways gives promise of a still greater 
expansion. The Panama Canal itself is the foremost 
of all projects for the improvement of ocean trade. 
The developing world scope of such projects. — In 
the later study of geography, the story of harbor ad- 
vantages and improvements can ke extended to the 
ports of Asia, Australia, Africa, and South America. 
The development of deep and commodious harbors 
fully equipped with modern docks and machinery opens 
up a remarkable chapter in the history of man’s 
ingenuity and resourcefulness in adapting himself to
-P-A-G-E-154
  146 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
natural conditions. Such a topic is found to have a 
very broad scope, first, as it bears on New Orleans in 
its numerous and far-extending relations at home and 
abroad and, secondly, as the same idea of harbor 
improvement is applied to various seaport cities on 
the American seaboard and later to other ports stand- 
ing guard over the gateways of commerce for other 
nations. Such an elaborate study of two or three 
chief seaports of the United States (New York, New 
Orleans, and San Francisco) with such a progressive 
comparison with other American ports as is natural 
will cover a large extent of American geography. It 
illustrates clearly the concentration of extensive knowl- 
edge around one central developing thought, which 
furnishes a full understanding of a multitude of salient 
projects in the modern world. 
A teaching project so extensive and many-sided as 
New Orleans as a Gulf port would require at least a 
dozen or fifteen lessons with fifth- or sixth-grade chil- 
dren. The second stage of comparison with other sea- 
ports on the Gulf coast, as well as on the Pacific and 
Atlantic coasts and on the Great Lakes, will require 
several lessons, not to speak of later similar studies in 
seaports of Europe, Asia, etc. ‘The New Orleans topic 
naturally includes not only the immediate harbor im- 
provements of New Orleans but also such projects on 
the Mississippi as the Eads’ jetties, the extensive levee 
system, the deep-water navigation of the Northern 
streams, and river dredging. It is also associated 
closely with the explorations of La Salle and D’Iber- 
ville, with the Louisiana Purchase, and with Andrew 
Jackson and the Civil War history. The expansion of

the topic which brings in a comparison with other ocean 
and lake ports leads into well-defined series of big 
topics on great seaport cities. The following series of 
typical projects on river and ocean ports has been 
elaborately worked out and handled in class instruc- 
tion: 1. New Orleans as a Gulf port. 2. San Fran- 
cisco and the Golden Gate. 3. The growth of Chicago. 
4. The harbor and shipping of New York City. 5. 
Glasgow harbor improvement and shipbuilding. 6. 
The rebuilding of Vienna. 7. Petrograd, founded by 
Peter the Great. This list might be further extended 
by studies on Constantinople, Calcutta on the Ganges, 
and Rio Janeiro in Brazil. 
On the basis of this earlier elaborate treatment of 
American ports the later topics could be handled rapidly 
in much less time. 
A simple series of such related units worked out in 
the grades and closely connected and organized into a 
developing sequence would illustrate our plan of or- 
ganization through the grades. 
Enrichment of individual projects. — If the proposed 
plan of reorganizing studies on the basis of typical life 
projects is to be made effective, the important centers 
of organization must be wisely selected and arranged. 
What is still more difficult, each of these large teaching 
units ought to be elaborately developed and enriched 
from scholarly source materials and expanded into a 
comprehensive thought movement. Who is to com- 
bine this liberal survey of all studies with deep, practical 
scholarship in individual topics? Each of these im- 
portant type studies, like a monograph, should be a 
masterpiece of productive scholarship combined with
-P-A-G-E-156
  148 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
simplicity and pedagogical appropriateness to children. 
It is an educational enterprise of the first magnitude, 
and it lies on the exact level of the daily needs of the 
school. A group of strong, scholarly, practical teachers 
is needed who are willing to roll up their sleeves, take 
the pickax and dig down to the roots of knowledge in 
every important school topic that deserves to rank as a 
center of organization. 
Who is to lead in organizing and enriching these 
large units? — The great majority of untrained teachers 
have no qualifications for such intensive organizing 
scholarship. Even experienced, well-trained teachers 
are too absorbed and preoccupied with the numerous 
details of teaching in several subjects to find time for 
such original effort in elaborating big topics. The 
scholarly specialists in colleges and normal schools have 
the full equipment of knowledge necessary for such 
intensive work in special branches of study, but their 
minds have a strong bent toward the academic instruc- 
tion of adults, and this highly urgent problem of the 
elementary school has not yet caught their attention 
and interest. The pedagogical specialists in our normal 
schools, colleges, and universities are not engaged in 
this work but are devoted to an educational cult which 
deals too much in generalities and verbal distinctions 
and definitions touching education. The fruitful, 
instructive working out of special themes, organized 
into a rich concrete setting, is a sweaty, burdensome, 
toilsome enterprise demanding profound knowledge, 
research, originality, and unabated enthusiasm. It is 
not one of the phases of a soft pedagogy. Grasped in 
its full scope and in its deeper values, however, this
-P-A-G-E-157
  PROJECTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 149 
task of reorganizing the elementary course of study on 
a sound basis of typical projects is inexpressibly im- 
portant and inspiring. It would be difficult to name 
any problem in modern civilization of equal value. 
SUMMARY 
As a means of overcoming the difficulties of dealing with our 
present disorganized curriculum, it is proposed to concentrate 
study upon these central, typical projects, the larger units of organ- 
ization. 
Such projects are peculiarly appropriate to children because they 
are full of life impulse and activity and lead directly into the outer 
world of affairs toward which the children have such a natural 
powerful drift. 
In the realm of concrete life projects the child and the adult 
are in full accord and are developing straight into the field of a 
broad intelligent citizenship. 
The project is the means of incorporating the child’s energetic 
spirit into the ongoing world processes. 
Life just outside of the school walls is made up of such enter- 
prising projects, but they are not easily discovered in school books 
nor in the thoughts of schoolmasters. 
The demonstration of any single project like that on broom 
corn or that on the New Orleans harbor improvement demands an 
extensive treatment. It is no small matter to work out adequately 
one of these important projects. The idea which is the motive 
power in the development of such a project demands a strong 
practical life setting. 
The later chapters on’ the Virginia Plantation and the Louisiana 
Purchase will furnish still more complete demonstrations.

CHAPTER v “ 
THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION —A TYPE 
STUDY IN PROJECTS 
The descriptive setting for a project.— In the 
treatment of a typical life project it is of no little impor- 
tance to decide how elaborate and extensive the descrip- 
tive account should be. Where there is an important 
idea to be developed, as in the case of the Virginia 
Plantation, it requires a liberal amount of time and 
effort to collect and organize the appropriate descrip- 
tive facts that furnish a complete setting for the idea. 
In this case it is needful to reproduce a historical situa- 
tion which has a central motive and numerous side 
lights. So deep-seated and far-reaching is this idea in 
its influence that it is only gradually, by tracing out 
its important bearings, that we discover its dominant 
quality. This constructive, expanding thought-process 
leads on step by step to a complete objectification of the 
idea as a powerful organizing agency in the midst of 
the hurly-burly of life. It develops into a great his- 
torical object lesson with a central motive powerfully 
active and influential in the world’s business. In other 
words this Virginia Plantation, as a typical life project, 
takes up a good deal of room in the historic world, and 
there is no way of cramping it in the school treatment 
into a small space without destroying its meaning and 
value. 
151 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  152 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
Only a few fully expanded projects proposed. — This 
is one excuse — and it is a good one — for spending so 
much time on one topic, one big teaching unit or proj- 
ect. It is worth while to make this point plain be- 
cause we have the set purpose of constructing a course 
of study out of such big topics, every one of which is a 
basal center of organization and fills a large place in the 
whole plan. Another way of expressing our main pur- 
pose is to say that we propose to concentrate attention 
upon afew main strongholds of knowledge and to neglect 
an almost interminable number of little things which 
have heretofore received considerable attention. It 
would be a grand forward step in education if we could 
show children how to pay their full respects to a small 
group of simple, fundamental ideas embodied in these 
large lifelike demonstrations. As one of these ideas 
travels its natural course within a thoughtful inquisitive 
mind, it seems to show two marked stages in its prog- 
ress. The first is often called the concrete or descrip- 
tive stage, where the idea is first clearly identified and 
understood in one complete, lifelike setting. The 
second stage is that in which the idea, by successive 
applications to a variety of kindred phenomena, expands 
into a world meaning — a general concept. 
Our applied psychology has long accepted the above- 
mentioned thought movement as fundamental but has 
almost totally failed to demonstrate its use on large 
constructive units of study. This failure to apply 
well-known psychological principles to the elaborate 
treatment of large teaching units is a fatal weak- 
ness in our present curriculum, because it makes 
no provision for the adequate treatment of these
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 153 
central teaching units, the backbone of a course of 
study. 
The Virginia Plantation an example of enlarged 
treatment.— The Virginia Plantation as here pre- 
sented is an effort to illustrate this expansive treatment 
of an important project or unit of study. We need 
these central units developed on an enlarged, unprece- 
dented scale. The proper full treatment of one of 
these big units may well strike us at first with sur- 
prise and incredulity. We seem to need this shock of 
astonishment as a means of recovering our mental 
balance and thus, as it were, forcing ourselves to ac- 
knowledge the predominance of a few pivotal units 
and centers of organization. 
In the early settlement of Virginia the land was 
held in common, and the products were gathered 
into a common storehouse. But this plan of public 
ownership failed to bring growth and prosperity to 
the colony. Accordingly in 1614 Governor Dale 
made a beginning of private allotments of land to 
individuals. When. Dale returned to England in 
1616 there were 81 farmers tilling their lands pri- 
vately while about 205 officers and laborers managed 
and cultivated the public lands. The entire population 
was 381. 
There were as yet no plows, but much poultry; there 
were also a few horses and considerable numbers of 
hogs, goats, and cattle. Tobacco had begun to be 
cultivated and brought a good price. 
The land system. — There was one commodity of 
which the company which settled Virginia had a large 
supply; namely, land — millions of acres of it, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
various ways in which this land was distributed are 
of much interest. 
One tract of land on the James of 1,000 acres was 
reserved for the clergy, 3,000 for the governor, 10,000 for 
establishing a college, and 12,000, in four tracts near 
the four chief settlements, were reserved for the colony 
as a whole for public purposes. Many large tracts of 
land were also granted by the company to certain 
groups or societies of wealthy gentlemen who were 
expected to send out emigrants and laborers to settle 
and develop them. The largest of these was a grant of 
200,000 acres near the mouth of the Chickahominy 
River and called Southampton or Smith’s Hundred. 
Three hundred colonists were sent by the landowners 
to settle this tract. 
Martin’s Hundred on the south side of the James 
contained 80,000 acres. Several other large grants 
were made to such groups, but this method of appor- 
tioning such large plantations or settlements used up 
the land too rapidly. Such estates, like English manors, 
were somewhat independent of the government of the 
province, and the head man or commander of such a 
settlement or hundred was sometimes defiant of the 
laws of the assembly. 
A still more important method of land distribution 
was that of dividing it up among the settlers and ad- 
venturers. (By adventurers are meant the stockholders 
who had contributed money to the London Company 
as owners of shares.) Each stockholder who had con- 
tributed twelve pounds and ten shillings to the treasury 
of the company was to receive one hundred acres of 
land on the first division and another hundred upon the 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 155 
second and later division of lands on condition the first 
grant was improved. 
The head rights system. — It was provided also, by 
what was called the system of head rights, that for each 
person brought into the colony by a planter or adven- 
turer and remaining for three years, the person at whose 
expense he came was to receive fifty acres of land on 
the first division and another fifty acres on the second 
division and perhaps likewise on the third. This 
system of encouraging the planters to bring servants or 
laborers into the province rapidly increased the number 
of people, insured a large body of laborers, and caused 
the land to be rapidly divided up among the settlers as 
private owners of either large or small estates. The 
smaller farmers worked on their own lands with a few 
laborers, while the owners of large estates had numerous 
servants and, later on, slaves. é 
Again, a free settler paying his own charges and 
bringing a family could receive one hundred acres on 
the first division, one hundred more on the second, 
and fifty acres on each division for each adult member 
of his family. : 
With the dissolution of the company in 1624 and the 
change of government, most of the land that had been 
reserved to the college and to the province was also 
divided up and distributed to private owners so that a 
complete system of private landownership was finally 
established. The people as a whole had become indus- 
trious and frugal, the laziness and wastefulness of the 
early days of common land and labor were over. 
It is very evident that the rapid settlement of Vir- 
ginia from 1616 on was largely due to the fact that, 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
156 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
many people in England desired to secure landed estates 
in America and that even respectable poor men could 
secure good farms and by labor and thrift steadily 
increase their holdings. 
The amount of rich, productive lands which Virginia 
had to distribute to settlers was the most important 
inducement to the early inhabitants of the province. 
The cultivation of tobacco was very profitable, and the 
wheat, corn, and vegetables raised, with the cattle, 
horses, sheep, and poultry, supplied the people with 
abundance of food, clothing, etc. 
The importance of land questions is indicated by 
the fact that a large share of the laws and discussions 
of the first assembly of Virginia (the first House of 
Burgesses) related to the distribution of lands, to the 
rights of laborers and tenants on estates, and to the 
public grants. 
A similar land system in Maryland. — Not only in 
Virginia but in Maryland and other colonies the ques- 
tion of land distribution was of the highest importance. 
In 1633 Lord Baltimore made an announcement of the 
conditions offered to settlers in Maryland. “It pro- 
vided that each free planter should pay the cost of his 
outfit and transportation, which amounted to about 
twenty pounds. To every married man who thus 
provided for the voyage and for that of his family the 
proprietor promised one hundred acres of land for him- 
self and one hundred for his wife, if she accompanied 
him, one hundred acres also for each adult servant and 
fifty for each child under sixteen years of age. Two 
thousand acres should also be given to each adventurer 
who in the year 1633 should take into the province for

ee ee ne et tee 
THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 157 
the purpose of settlement five men between the ages of 
sixteen and fifty. 
The purpose of these grants was to encourage the 
settlement of the country. The manor as a whole was 
almost an exact copy of the estate of an English country 
gentleman. There was the great manor house with 
its spacious rooms and hall; near by the chapel and the 
dwellings of the workmen (later slaves), while the estate 
was at first divided among the tenants holding leases 
for twenty-one years. 
Land grants at New Amsterdam. — In New Amster- 
dam, during the earliest settlements, large grants were 
made to the patroons, who were lords of manors on a still 
larger scale. The Van Rensselaer family at one time 
ruled over a tract of 700,000 acres near Albany. Later, 
during the English rule, large freehold estates were 
established in New York with the purpose of encourag- 
ing settlement. The patroons, or large owners, sent 
out settlers equipped with tools and resources for de- 
veloping the estate. The land of the estate was di- 
vided up among tenants who paid a rental. But a 
great many grants of smaller estates and farms of one 
thousand acres or less were made, and these small 
holdings in the end predominated. 
In the Carolinas the first distribution of lands was 
in large estates, although a wider distribution among 
small holders followed later. 
The coming of the Cavaliers. — The system of large 
estates or plantations was greatly favored and extended 
in Virginia by the coming of the Cavaliers in the period 
from 1649 to 1660. With the death of Charles I and 
the supremacy of Cromwell the Royalists in England  
-P-A-G-E-166
158 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
were put in an unfavorable plight, and many of them 
migrated with their possessions to Virginia. Governor 
Berkeley had previously invited the Royalists to settle 
in Virginia and offered them greater inducements than 
any other colony. During these eleven years after 
1648 the population of Virginia increased from 15,000 
to 38,000. At the same time the number of large 
grants, as estates, increased as follows: from 1651-55 
three grants, from 1656-66 twenty grants, from 1667-79 
thirty-seven grants. The size of individual grants 
increased also in this and the following period from 
650 acres to as high as 10,000 acres. This rapid increase 
in population and also in the number and size of private 
land grants is directly due to this influx of well-to-do 
Cavaliers. They evidently came to America prepared 
to establish and develop large estates as homes. 
The result after a few years of growth was a pro- 
nounced type of Cavalier gentlemen Americanized into 
plantation lords of Virginia. 
A typical plantation or plantation project. — One of 
these Virginia plantations of 5,000 or 6,000 acres, with 
its tobacco fields, forest lands, “great house” and ad- 
jacent buildings, and the various groups of slaves, over- 
seers, and white families belonging to it, presents a 
picture of free patriarchal life which has a peculiar 
interest and charm. The development and manage- 
ment of such a plantation is a typical American project. 
The great house of the owner, of wood or brick, stood 
upon some commanding site overlooking the river 
(James, Rappahannock, or Potomac) with broad lawns 
shaded by oaks, walnuts, or other forest giants. At the 
river was a landing where the large and smaller boats  
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 159 
of the planter lay at rest and where sailing vessels from 
London or Bristol unloaded their English goods and 
took on the hogsheads of tobacco or cargo of wheat. 
The plantation house had a large chimney at each end 
and a broad porch in front and a central hall with the 
big dining room on one side, corresponding to the great 
hall of an English manor house, or feudal castle. 
The’ home house.— The planter’s family might 
require from half a dozen to twenty rooms for sitting 
rooms, parlors, bedrooms, ete. Back of this mansion 
and separated from it, to isolate the smells and heat 
attendant upon cooking, was the kitchen with its great 
fireplace, fitted out with a complete collection of cranes, 
pothooks, kettles, gridirons, and other cooking utensils. 
The opening was sometimes twelve feet long, six feet 
high, and five feet deep, and it would be comfortably 
filled by a roasting ox. Such a fireplace, with its cook- 
ing outfit, is still seen in the kitchen at Mt. Vernon 
and at other old Colonial homesteads. The large 
family with servants and the lavish hospitality of the 
planter made it often necessary to equip the kitchen 
and dining hall adequately for feasting a large company 
of people. 
At some distance from the great house was a hamlet 
of log huts or rough board structures, often of a tumble- 
down appearance, but teeming with the woolly heads of 
pickaninnies and older negro servants. These huts were 
furnished with a very meager outfit of stools and kitchen 
utensils. The houses of the white overseers were more 
respectable and nearer the mansion. 
Other buildings. — The barns and stables and grana- 
ries, with the dairy and milk house or spring house, were  
-P-A-G-E-168
160 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
essentials to a plantation; the tobacco barns, for sort- 
ing, curing, and packing of tobacco, the smokehouse 
for curing hams and bacon, the blacksmith shop, a 
tannery for leather production, the carpenter shop 
and the room for spinning and weaving — all these 
were necessary on a big estate. In addition to these 
the plantation could often boast a sawmill for sawing up 
lumber from the forest for the various uses of building, 
cooperage, boats, etc., a brickyard, a cider press, a still 
for the manufacture of rum, and, most important, a store 
where goods landed from the English ships could be 
arranged and sold out to the various people of the home 
plantation and to those of smaller neighboring farms. 
The garden.— The garden and the orchard also 
were a very important adjunct, and the flower beds 
were cultivated sometimes with much care. The 
forests supplied not only lumber and fuel but charcoal 
and game; the rivers and Chesapeake Bay added to 
the good things of the table — bass, terrapins, oysters, 
canvasbacks, and other waterfowl. There was now, 
unlike the old days of the starving time, a rich abun- 
dance of food and drink, and the reigning hospitality 
encouraged a lavish use of well-cooked viands. At 
that time there was probably no place in the world 
where people were better fed than in Virginia. 
Gunston — the Mason plantation.— Some writers 
have described the Virginia planters as somewhat lazy 
and luxurious in their habits, but John Fiske, while 
admitting that there may have been some specimens of 
slothful planters who lay on their couches drinking 
punch and fanned by negro slaves, quotes from John 
Mason of Gunston, as follows: “It was very much the  
-P-A-G-E-169
THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 161 
practice with gentlemen of landed and slave estates so 
to organize them as to have considerable resources 
within themselves; to employ and pay but few trades- 
men, and to buy little or none of the coarse stuffs and 
materials used by them. Thus among his slaves my 
father had carpenters, coopers, sawyers, blacksmiths, 
tanners, curriers, shoemakers, spinners, weavers, and 
knitters, and even a distiller. His woods furnished 
timber and plank for the carpenters and coopers and 
charcoal for the blacksmith; his cattle killed for his 
own consumption and for sale supplied skins for the 
tanners, curriers, and shoemakers; and his sheep gave 
wool and his fields produced cotton and flax for the 
weavers and spinners and his orchards fruit for the 
distiller. His carpenters and sawyers built and kept 
in repair all the dwelling houses, barns, stables, ploughs, 
harrows, gates, etc. on the plantation and the outhouses 
at the house. His coopers made the hogsheads the 
tobacco was prized in and the tight casks to hold the 
cider and other liquors. The tanners and curriers, 
with the proper vats, etc., tanned and dressed the skins 
for upper as for lower leather to the full amount of the 
consumption of the estate, and the shoemakers made 
them into shoes for the negroes. A professed shoe- 
maker was hired for three or four months in the year 
to come and make up the shoes for the white part of the 
family. The blacksmiths did all the ironwork required 
by the establishment, as making and repairing ploughs, 
harrows, teeth, chains, bolts, etc. The spinners, 
weavers, and knitters made all the coarse cloths and 
stockings used by the negroes and some of finer texture , 
worn by the white family, nearly all worn by the 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
children of it. The distiller made every fall a good deal 
of apple, peach, and persimmon brandy. The art of 
distilling from grains was not then among us, and but 
few public distilleries. All these operations were carried 
on at the home house, and their results distributed as 
oceasion required to the different plantations. More- 
over, all the beeves and hogs for consumption or sale 
were driven up and slaughtered there at the proper 
seasons and whatever was to be preserved was salted 
and packed away for after distribution. 
“My father kept no steward or clerk about him. 
He kept his own books and superintended, with the 
assistance of a trusty slave or two and occasionally 
of some of his sons, all the operations at or about the 
home house above described. ‘To carry on these oper- 
ations to the extent required, it will be seen that a con- 
siderable force was necessary besides the house servants, 
who for such a household, a large family, and entertain- 
ing a great deal of company, must be numerous; and 
such a force was constantly kept there, independently 
of any of the plantations and besides occasional drafts 
from them of labour for particular occasions. As I had 
during my youth constant intercourse with all these 
people, I remember them all and their several employ- 
ments as if it was yesterday.” 
Colonel Mason had some 500 persons on his estate 
and was known to have sent from his private wharf a 
shipment of 23,000 bushels of wheat at one shipment. 
To look after all this work would give a man little time 
for idleness. 
The plantation was complete in itself, supplying 
from its own resources most of the needs of life: the 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 163 
meat was from its own cattle, sheep, and swine; houses, 
barns, and sheds were built from lumber from trees 
felled on the plantation; leather was tanned from the 
hides of home animals, and the shoemaker made up the 
shoes; tobacco was raised and cured and shipped from 
the wharf; the plantation distiller made applejack, 
peach, and persimmon brandy from the fruits of the 
plantation; hemp and cotton gathered from the fields 
and wool from the sheep supplied the spinners, weavers, 
and knitters of the household with materials; the garden 
and farm furnished vegetables and grains for the use 
of the table. 
The plantation store. — The plantation store was an 
important establishment where all those needful articles 
not supplied by the crude household industries could 
be brought from the ship from old England. It con- 
tained dry goods, millinery, hardware and tools, drugs 
and chinaware, jewelry and furniture, and finer grades 
of shoes, hats, cutlery, glassware, paper, books, and 
machines. It contained a miscellaneous multitude of 
the luxuries, trinkets, and necessities which in our day 
are sold in a score of separate stores. 
No large city.— So complete in its own resources 
was the plantation and, with the assistance of the store, 
so self-sufficient in supplying all its needs (by its direct 
connection at its wharf with English ships) that towns 
refused to grow in Virginia. The general feeling in the 
colony was that they ought to have some big towns so 
as to be like their neighbors in Philadelphia and New 
York. Accordingly the House of Burgesses in 1662 
passed a law requiring 32 brick houses to be built in 
Jamestown and forbidding vessels under heavy penalties 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
164 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
from ascending the James River beyond Jamestown for 
the purpose of landing goods or taking on cargoes of 
tobacco. The purpose was to compel planters and 
ships to concentrate their business at Jamestown. But 
the law was violated and disregarded. The plantation 
idea was the stronger, and the town remained puny and 
unimportant. 
Dependence on British merchants. — One interest- 
ing result of the direct trade of British ships with the 
private wharves of planters was a growing and even 
disagreeable dependence of the planters upon the 
merchants in London and Bristol. All English goods 
and luxuries brought to the planter were paid for in 
tobacco, which had become the currency as well as the 
chief product of the colony. On account of their 
extravagant habits the planters grew into a credit 
system by which the coming crop of tobacco was often 
mortgaged for English goods needed on the plantation. 
The merchant was pleased with this credit system since 
it assured him the planter’s crop on very reasonable 
terms and at the same time enabled him to dispose of 
his own wares at good prices. 
Navigation Acts. — The Navigation Acts passed by 
Parliament, beginning in 1660, brought still further 
advantage to the British merchant. They required all 
tobacco, from Virginia to be carried to England by 
English ships and forbade the colonies sending their 
tobacco to Holland and other countries where much of 
it had been selling at good prices. The transfer of the 
whole trade to English merchants enabled them to 
monopolize the traffic and to pay very low prices. At 
the same time they were inclined to double the price on

THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 165 
their own goods shipped to Virginia. In Virginia there 
was also such overproduction of tobacco that planters 
could scarcely pay their heavy debts to the merchants. 
In other words the result of the Navigation Laws was 
that Virginia planters received half price for their 
tobacco and paid two prices for English goods. The 
feelings aroused by the Navigation Laws among the 
Virginia planters are therefore easily imagined. 
Virginia hospitality. — It was natural for the Vir- 
ginia gentlemen to exercise a bountiful hospitality. 
They set a good table, not omitting choice wines and 
strong waters. They kept a big household of servants; 
they entertained lavishly practically everybody who 
came. For it was by the interchange of long visits 
and by entertaining travelers they came in contact with 
the larger world. In dress and amusements they aped 
the manners of the English aristocracy. They sent 
their sons to Oxford to be educated. Weddings and 
funerals, where scores of people came long distances as 
guests, were expensive affairs. 
The best breeds of fine horses were kept for riding 
and racing. The law fined the common man for enter- 
ing a horse for a race. Horse racing was a sport only 
for gentlemen. Fox-hunting was a favorite amuse- 
ment. When the planter entered his barge with his 
well-dressed family and liveried servants to descend 
the river to Williamsburg for the meeting of the House 
of Burgesses and to engage in the balls and festivities 
of the season, he did not distinguish himself by a modest 
appearance. 
Leaders. — The planters held also a monopoly of 
political influence; they were the vestrymen of the  
-P-A-G-E-174
166 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
neighboring parish and determined local taxes and the 
choice of local officers and clergy. At the county seat 
they were the judges of the court, sheriffs, and other 
officers. At Williamsburg they served as members of 
the House of Burgesses. In brief they exercised, 
naturally, political leadership in local, county, and 
State affairs. 
The planter—a regal patriarch.— The Virginia 
planter on his large estate, with his liberal hospitality 
and tributary household and slaves, was a sort of regal 
patriarch, a person of large independence and authority. 
This ideal of life which was cherished by the Virginia 
planters was a controlling influence in the Old Do- 
minion. Even now it has a peculiar attractiveness. 
We look back upon that period as a sort of ‘‘golden age.” 
Moreover, the families who best represented that era 
and those Virginia homesteads, as the Randolphs, 
Harrisons, Byrds, Washingtons, Lees, Jeffersons, Madi- 
sons, Masons, Tylers, and many others, have given us 
some of the greatest men in our history. The ideal of 
life which they cherished in their private estates was 
the central idea in their civilization and to a consider- 
able extent spread to the whole Southland. : 
Burke, in his Speech on Conciliation with America, 
expresses the high spirit of independence in the South- 
ern planters and well interprets its power and meaning. 
Old Colonial houses. — In Virginia the centers of 
historical interest during the Colonial period are certain 
old plantation houses, as Westover, the house of Colonel 
Byrd, Upper and Lower Brandon, whose great houses 
still look down upon the James, and Gunston, where 
the Mason family resided for generations. Greenway 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 167 
Court, Mount Vernon, and, later, Arlington have a 
historical interest in connection with Washington and 
the Lees greater than that of any cities in Virginia. 
Certain small towns, as Alexandria, Jamestown, and 
Norfolk, have historical significance, but the center of 
interest is the plantation house. 
In other colonies Philadelphia, Charlestown, New 
York, and Boston are the historical centers, the places 
to which we turn for the study of important events, 
but to get at the leading characters and even assem- 
blages of Virginia history we turn frequently to what is 
going on at Mt. Vernon or at Monticello or at the home 
of the Lees. 
Important results. — The indirect results of this 
predominance of the plantation ideal of good living are 
worthy of observation. 
(1) There were no large cities in Virginia. City 
life was not attractive to these people. They could 
not be induced even by severe laws to congregate in 
cities. They preferred the independence and amplitude 
of life on their estates. The short winter festivities 
and balls at the capital they enjoyed, but their homes 
were far more attractive. In our days the powerful 
drift is toward urban life, although the well-to-do are 
again betaking themselves to the country. 
(2) There was no free school, and the widely sepa- 
rated plantations made it impossible to establish and 
develop a strong system of schools. The early life of 
Washington and of other Virginia worthies makes clear 
that the “Old Field Schools’ were important in an 
early day, and the Virginians, many of them, had an 
appreciation of education but their situation compelled
-P-A-G-E-176
  168 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
them to resort to private tutors and governesses for 
the families of wealthy planters. 
(3) Plantation life furnished a soil in which slavery 
flourished and grew strong. The presence of large 
estates and the cultivation of a single great staple 
product like tobacco made slavery very welcome to 
the planters. There were many individual planters 
like Jefferson and Washington who described clearly 
and deplored the growing evils of slavery. But the 
conditions of plantation life on the whole were so favor- 
able that slavery grew like a weed in rank soil. 
(4) In connection with this there continued a low, 
primitive state of agriculture. It was a broad, loose, 
and shiftless mode of cropping the land. As tobacco 
culture drained the soil of its strength, new forests were 
cut down and new fields opened, while the old exhausted 
fields returned again to forest. What we now call 
scientific agriculture with a proper rotation of crops 
and preservation of soils and improvements in products 
was unknown to the plantation. 
(5) Side by side with aristocratic estates of the 
great planters there grew up a shiftless class of poor 
whites springing from the redemptioners, servants 
bound to labor, and occasional batches of criminals 
which were sent to Virginia from England. The plan- 
tation system from the earliest times demanded a cheap 
form of labor which was at first largely supplied by 
these lower orders of white servants and later by black 
slaves. 
(6) Such a patriarchal agricultural system gave 
little chance for the development of manufactures. 
With the exception of the crude household industries
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 169 
of providing lumber, blacksmithing, cooperage, tanning, 
dairy products, coarse weaving of cloths, butchering 
and smoking meats, brick making, and other common 
provision for food, clothing, and shelter, all finer manu- 
factured articles were derived straight from England. 
English customs and fashions in dress, house furnishing, 
and amusements prevailed, and a complete dependence 
upon the mother country for manufactured articles 
was natural. Even to this day manufacturing has 
developed but slowly in Virginia. 
(7) In conclusion it may be said that the planters 
constituted not only a social but a political and landed 
aristocracy. In point of intelligence, wealth, and politi- 
cal influence, they were leaders and makers of Virginia 
history. 
The plantation system first developed strongly in 
Virginia. The extent to which it was adopted and 
became prevalent in other Southern states is a matter 
of interesting inquiry. 
North Carolina. — The original attempts at settle- 
ment by Raleigh in North Carolina were failures. The 
later settlements by a group of English nobles, under 
the leadership of Clarendon and Locke, were an effort 
to establish the feudal system with grants of large 
estates, and the English manor system was projected 
in the woods and coast lands of Carolina. These settle- 
ments were only partially successful. The real settle- 
ment of North Carolina was chiefly by the overflow 
population of Virginia. 
South Carolina. — In South Carolina the situation 
was different. French Huguenots, escaping persecu- 
tion, and Puritans, like those of New England, made 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
up a large part of the early settlers. They soon 
established the city of Charleston. The cultivation 
of rice in the great swamps became almost as impor- 
tant as tobacco culture in Virginia. Large rice planta- 
tions were laid out, but, the swamps being too hot and 
unhealthy for white people, most of the planters had 
their residences in Charleston. Negro slaves were 
found to be extremely serviceable in the rice swamps 
and were bought from the slave traders in large num- 
bers. It was not long before three fourths of the 
population of South Carolina were black slaves. More- 
over, slavery took on a harsher form in South Carolina 
than in Virginia because slaves did not live so much 
in white families as trusted domestics but on the rice 
plantations under the control of overseers and slave- 
driving taskmasters. There existed a fear and dread 
of negro insurrection in South Carolina, and this was 
intensified by the uprising of blacks in 1740 when they 
were quickly suppressed by the superior discipline of 
the whites. 
In Charleston itself there was much wealth and 
social refinement. The whole life of the Colony 
centered in this one spot. There was much social 
gayety, a good theatre, schools, and a progressive 
spirit. The contact with England was closer than in 
Virginia, and Charleston was more liberal and more 
directly influenced by Europe than even Boston and 
Philadelphia. 
In spite of striking differences between the char- 
acter of the early settlers in Virginia and South Caro- 
lina, they were much alike in establishing great planta- 
tions with an exclusive class of rich landowners and a
-P-A-G-E-179
THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 171 
great body of black slaves as the basis of the labor 
system. 
Georgia, under the guidance of the noble Oglethorpe, 
tried to establish a free democratic state, but, after a 
short struggle to keep out slavery and rum, both were 
freely admitted and Georgia submitted to the planta- 
tion and slave system coming in the South. VY e 
Cotton, rice, and sugar plantations.— In the de- 
velopment of the Southern States during the Colonial 
period and later, the general conditions were favorable 
on the whole to the growth of large estates and a slave 
system of labor. With the introduction of cotton 
culture on a large scale, cotton plantations with black 
labor spread over the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, 
and Mississippi. Great staple products, easily raised 
by slave labor, such as tobacco, cotton, and rice, were 
all alike favorable to the growth of the plantation 
style of society and its attendant institutions. Eventu- 
ally along the banks of the Mississippi in Louisiana, 
and even in Texas, the plantation lord was seen enjoy- 
ing his patriarchal rights over broad acres, directing 
his overseers in ruling groups of black field hands and 
dwelling in his mansion house as a sort of lordly 
proprietor. 
Massachusetts and the township settlements. — In 
Massachusetts the division of lands among the early 
settlers was based upon township grants. The people 
who settled together in a village were given the right 
to own and control a township of surrounding land, 
and they divided up this district among themselves in 
such way as pleased them. 
The Puritans in England about 1628 were badly  
-P-A-G-E-180
172 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
treated by Charles I, the king, and many of them 
decided to come to America where they hoped to enjoy 
religious freedom. In 1630 and for several years after 
many shiploads of Puritans came to the neighborhood 
of Boston and sought places for settlement. 
They usually settled by congregations under the 
leadership of a pastor. An English pastor and a num- 
ber of families of his congregation (a hundred persons 
or more) would sell their homes in England and take 
ship for Massachusetts. Upon arriving in Boston they 
would request from the Governor and Council at 
Boston a tract of land where they could settle together, 
build a village, divide up the land, and manage their 
own affairs. 
Cambridge settlement and the town meeting. — An 
example of this was the settlement at Newtown, now 
called Cambridge. The land granted to this congre- 
gation lay along the north bank of the Charles River 
and covered several square miles. In locating the 
village three streets were laid out running north from 
the river, and two other streets, crossing these and 
running parallel to the river. Leading men in the 
settlement, chosen by the voters, made the selection of 
the site, laid out the streets, and then proceeded to make 
allotments of town lots, or home lots, for each family. 
“The settlement of a town normally began with 
the laying out of the village plot and the assignment of 
home lots. This, to an extent, determined the loca- 
tion of highways, of the village common, and of some 
of the outlying fields.) On or near the common the 
church was built, and, in not a few cases, the site that 
was chosen for this building went far toward determin-  
-P-A-G-E-181
  THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 173 
ing the entire layout of the town. The idea of a home 
lot was a plot of ground for a dwelling house and out- 
buildings, for a dooryard and a garden, and usually an 
enclosure for feeding cattle and raising corn. 
“In Salem, at the beginning, the home lots appear 
to have contained two acres each. Somewhat later 
they were reduced to one acre. Some of the home 
lots at Cambridge (Newtown) were as small as a quar- 
ter of an acre.” — (Osgood, The American Colonies in 
the 17th Century, Vol. I, Chapter Eleven.) 
At Cambridge the land that could be used for 
cultivation lay to the north, east, and west of the 
town. ‘There were extensive marshes along the river 
and to the east and west. The land belonging to the 
town was divided into several different fields or tracts 
for different uses. Near the village lay the “cow 
common,” the “pine swamp field,” the ‘‘ox pasture,” 
the “planting field,” the “little neck.” Further away 
lay the great marshes, the “west field” adjoining the 
great swamp, and the more remote pastures for stock, 
and the woodlands. 
At first these large fields, pastures, and woodlands 
were held and used in common, but gradually allot- 
ments were made to the different families in the 
various fields so that the head of a family would own 
small strips of land in half a dozen or more fields. 
“The settlers made use of the upland for home lots 
and planting fields. The meadow was generally used 
for hay and pasture. From the marshes and swamps 
hay and thatch were procured. In the remote un- 
cleared or partially cleared tracts, swine, sheep, and 
young cattle were pastured. Oxen, horses, and milch

a ee Se ee ee ee ee a 
174 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM | 
cows were pastured upon land nearer the village. That 
part of the cattle which were daily driven to and from 
their pasture occupied the chief attention of the town 
herdsman. In the autumn, after the hay and other 
crops had been gathered, the cattle were admitted to 
the meadows and upland fields.” (Osgood.) 
When a congregation had once settled upon such a 
township of land or grant from the General Court, and 
a village with allotments in town and fields had been 
made, the people or settlers were left free to manage 
their own local affairs in the town meeting. The men 
of the settlement came together at the church for a town 
meeting, elected a chairman or moderator, passed laws 
regulating their town affairs, elected a committee of 
selectmen, and magistrates as they were needed. 
In this town meeting many matters of interest to 
the village and township were taken up, freely dis- 
cussed, and decisions made by majority vote. Besides 
allotments of land they settled also the salaries and 
duties of herdsmen, the building and repair of roads 
and bridges, the laying of taxes, arrangements for 
schools and schoolmasters, the building of forts and 
palisades for defense, the election of selectmen and 
local officers, the construction of churches and other 
public buildings, the regulation of timber and forests, 
the duties and expenses of militia companies, the duties 
of servants and apprentices to their masters, attendance 
upon church service, and even dress and manners of 
the people. Each town, at its yearly town meeting, 
elected also two men to represent the town in the 
General Court or Legislature which met at Boston to 
make laws for the entire colony of Massachusetts.
-P-A-G-E-183
  
THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 175 
The town meeting was very democratic, and the 
common man was free to discuss proposed laws and to 
vote on an equality with the best. While some men 
had more ability, education, and wealth than others, 
nearly all were farmers, and not any were very rich, 
and very few were poor. In all the important affairs 
of life, the people ruled themselves and became intelli- 
gent and independent in discussing public affairs. 
Each man worked on his own land, built his own 
house with the help of his sons, and the mother and 
daughter did the work in the home. 
A free school was required in every town, and 
nearly all children learned to read the Bible, write, 
and cipher. 
Coming of the Puritans. — About 1630 the Puritans 
from England began to reach Massachusetts in large 
numbers. Soon nine towns were settled about Boston. 
At first the congregations settled on the peninsulas 
along the coast. But soon they began to select tracts 
inland for towns, and it was not long before Thomas 
Hooker, a clergyman, led a company across the country 
and through the woods to the Connecticut Valley 
(1635). 
Thus the towns grew rapidly and spread along the 
coast and westward. Each town elected two dele- 
gates as members of the General Court or Legislature 
of the Colony which made laws for all the towns and 
people of Massachusetts. 
The Legislature or General Court. — Many impor- 
tant matters must be looked after by the Governor 
and Legislature of the Colony: difficulties with the 
Indians, shipping and trade with other colonies,
-P-A-G-E-184
    176 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
disputes between the towns, the laws regulating schools 
and colleges, the choice of a governor and judges of 
the courts, the important relations of Massachusetts 
to England and the English Government, the conduct 
of wars, the regulations for the militia, the building of 
forts, and many other things. But the General Court 
itself was mostly made up of delegates from the towns, 
and these were farmers and common men, not rich 
landowners as in Virginia. The governors and a few 
' leading men in Boston were men of college education 
and wealth, but the great majority of the Puritans in 
the towns and in the Legislature were intelligent, inde- 
pendent workingmen of the common people. 
Comparison of Virginia with Massachusetts. — A 
comparison of Virginia with Massachusetts with re- 
spect to the land system of the two colonies, the slave 
plantation in Virginia and the free towns in Massa- 
chusetts, will show a striking contrast. In Massa- 
chusetts, Boston and the towns generally are the centers 
of influence and of historic interest. The free school 
developed strongly from the start in the towns with 
their concentration of people and in the villages with 
small near-by farms. Slavery originally prevailed in 
Massachusetts; but as the soil was unfavorable, there 
was little use for slaves on the small farms, and even 
from New England kitchens they disappeared. Agri- 
culture in Massachusetts, with its small estates and 
poor soil, reached as high a state as the conditions 
would permit. There never developed in New England 
a distinct class of poor whites, although some redemp- 
tioners were sent there. In New England there early 
developed a variety of industries, such as farming,
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 177 
fishing, shipbuilding, lumbering, and the carrying trade 
on the ocean. As soon as the chance offered, before 
and after the Revolution, manufactures sprang up and 
flourished. While there was a pronounced aristocratic 
leadership in Massachusetts’ society from the start, 
democracy was also strong and grew stronger, securing 
the commanding influence of the great middle class. 
The ideal of life on the plantation. — Again it must 
be confessed that the one ideal of life which was seen 
illustrated in the best Southern planters was a marvel- 
ously attractive one. It seemed to combine the best 
elements of old English feudalism as seen in the country 
life of an English gentleman with the boundless rich- 
ness and freedom of the New World forests. In Vir- 
ginia and throughout the South it turned out a remark- 
able succession of leaders in state affairs. If this 
system could have been developed as it was originally 
planned and begun in Maryland, with a body of free, 
self-governing tenants on each manor, it might have 
produced a strong and permanent form of society 
throughout the South. But unfortunately slavery 
took the place of a free tenantry, struck its roots deep 
into the plantation life, and grew into a vital connection 
with it. But this ideal of the planter’s life became the 
strong unifying and controlling motive of the civiliza- 
tion of the South. 
On the other hand, the Massachusetts land system, 
with its town democracy, with its public schools and 
churches, with its cities and growth of manufactures, 
spread over the whole of New England and later passed 
over to New York, Ohio, and the Western states. 
In comparing Virginia with Massachusetts we may
-P-A-G-E-186
    178 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
say we have a great contrast in the land and labor 
systems — an aristocracy and a democracy. 
A full picture. — In the above treatment of the Vir- 
ginia Plantation a pronounced effort is made to exhibit 
plantation life in a complete picture of its ongoing 
activities, centered around the great home house with 
its aristocratic family traditions and leadership. It is 
a pronounced exhibit of patriarchal home-and-family 
life. In the second stage of treatment it expands into 
a social and political system that spread its influence 
and its organizing principle throughout the Southern 
States and dominated the South for two hundred years. 
The above treatment inadequate. — And yet, elab- 
orate as this treatment is— in comparison with the 
usual textbook’s meager handling of this topic — it is 
still noticeably inadequate. In dealing with this topic 
in the classroom it will be helpful to expand it with 
plantation maps and pictures and with contemporary 
descriptions from old letters and diaries (source ma- 
terials). The imagination with its constructive power 
must be appealed to until we can forget the present 
and live over again this plantation life. It is not 
merely that we reconstruct this image of those times 
and gather its forces around a center of influence, 
but the very spirit of that age should animate the 
picture. Worked up into its complete form it might 
be called a dramatization of plantation life. It de- 
mands much time and space and especially artistic 
spirit in grouping and combining of elements in the 
picture. To some extent the teacher can make up 
this deficiency by enlisting the enterprising spirit of 
the children in working out some of the projects
-P-A-G-E-187
THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 179 
belonging properly to plantation life, as making a loom 
for weaving coarse textiles, the construction of a fire- 
place with its equipment, the making and wearing of 
Colonial costumes, and especially the working out of 
a plan of the old Colonial mansion as seen at Mt. 
Vernon, at Arlington, and elsewhere. 
Map making and other projects. — One of the most 
appropriate projects for each child in the class is to 
make a map to the scale of a five thousand-acre planta- 
tion, locating the home house and showing the arrange- 
ment of other buildings, the division into farms under 
overseers, and the distribution into fields for cultiva- 
tion, forests, and pasture lands. Later a complete 
map of the village and township division and distribu- 
tion of lands in a Massachusetts settlement should be 
prepared by the children, representing the village 
streets, church, common, school, private-home lots, 
fields, forests, swamps, stockade, and roads, with the 
township boundaries. Children should be encouraged 
to collect and mount pictures, make illustrative maps, 
and prepare an exhibit of well-arranged materials show- 
ing the interesting features of the Southern plantation 
and later of the Massachusetts town-meeting plan of 
living. 
All this machinery of graphic presentation and of 
constructive activity is designed to bring into full 
consciousness one single central idea in its complete 
life environment. This idea is to find its clear demon- 
stration in one powerful concentrated object lesson. 
This is what we mean by the first stage in the develop- 
ment of a project —its concrete embodiment in a 
convincing example.
-P-A-G-E-188
  180 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
The stage of expansion.— When a child is once 
grounded in this sort of genuine, realistic knowledge of 
a subject, he is well prepared for the next step in think- 
ing. Having thoroughly mastered this fundamental 
idea in a limited, single life setting, he is prepared to 
expand it and apply it successfully to other fields of ex- 
perience. For there are plenty of kindred fields where 
it is the main principle of interpretation. The Virginia 
Plantation idea grows strong at home and expands 
under modified conditions throughout the Southern 
States. It shows itself in a different form in Maryland, 
New York, and Pennsylvania, while in Massachusetts 
the social and economic organization based upon a 
different land system produces a distinct contrast. 
Comparison, a serious thought process. — This proc- 
ess of expanding the idea and of enlarging its scope by 
varied applications leads to a series of comparisons. 
The business of making comparisons along fundamental 
channels of thought, on the basis of full knowledge of 
the things compared, is a very serious matter in edu- 
cation. It strikes pretty close to the hub and center 
of right thinking. It is a process of measuring with 
standard units and of weighing out values. When 
we arrive at the threshold of this serious act of making 
valid comparisons and conclusions, we may look back 
and realize the supreme value of the work that has 
preceded in the first stage. We were then develop- 
ing into a full concrete demonstration the basal unit 
of measure with which, as a standard instrument, we 
make the measurements and determine values. 
Three phases of comparison. — In the handling of 
the Virginia Plantation the opportunity for making
-P-A-G-E-189
  THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 181 
valid comparisons is offered on three occasions. First, 
the head-rights system of the Virginia Company is 
compared with a similar plan in vogue with Lord 
Baltimore in Maryland and the patroon estates in the 
New York Colony. Second, there is a comparison of 
the Virginia Plantation with a similar system of land- 
ownership in the Carolinas, Georgia, and all the South- 
ern territories until it grew into a landed aristocracy 
for the whole South. Third, there is a full and extended 
comparison of the Virginia Plantation with the town- 
meeting land system of Massachusetts and New Eng- 
land. This last comparison leads to a striking con- 
trast and exhibits two opposite systems of land tenure 
and of social organization. On the basis of these con- 
trasted land systems and the social order built upon 
them, two civilizations developed in this country and 
ran parallel. In spite of common elements the differ- 
ences were so great that they drifted into serious and 
later into bitter conflict. 
Two ideas. — At the end of this journey in the 
historical field we may look back and see that in early 
Colonial times two basal ideas were deeply planted, 
one in Virginia and one in Massachusetts, which were 
destined to a long and powerful development. These 
two ideas, embodied in the fundamental social order, 
shaped American history to a large degree for more 
than two hundred years. To bring out the full force 
of these two ideas requires an elaborate treatment in 
what we call a large teaching unit, or project. 
The second stage of expanding the topic into its 
larger dimensions is seen to be less elaborately worked 
out than the first or concrete, descriptive stage. The
-P-A-G-E-190
182 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
* comparisons are suggested rather than executed in 
detail. The conclusions arrived at should be the result 
of a child’s own reasonings and should not be imposed. 
While in the printed matter the discussion of the 
second stage is more condensed and brief, in the class- 
room instruction the time required may be equally great. 
Self-activity in reasoning. —It is perhaps impos- 
sible to describe in detail or at least to foretell exactly 
what course this process of thinking should take, this 
measuring activity based on comparison and inference. 
This is the point where, on the basis of material pre- 
viously offered, the student should be thrown upon his 
own resources and held to account for conclusions 
drawn. The business of the teacher is largely to see 
that all the data are at hand, that important con- 
siderations are not overlooked. He is to be rather an 
observer and critic of the students’ reasoning processes. 
The use of sources and of extended reasoning. — 
In this second stage, even in the elaborate treatment of 
the topic, the book will furnish little more than the 
data for suggested lines of reasoning. A fuller knowl- 
edge upon which reasoning is to be based may be 
sought for in readings and reference books. It is 
indeed of fundamental importance that this reasoning 
on the basis of comparison, seeing similarities and con- 
trasts, forming analogies and drawing conclusions, - 
should not be neglected or treated in any scant fashion. 
It is in this way chiefly that the learner finds out how 
to use his knowledge, how to test its value, how to 
organize it more strongly in its basal sequences. This 
is in fact the main stage of organization — of serious 
thinking.
-P-A-G-E-191
  THE VIRGINIA PLANTATION 183 
It will bear repetition at this point that these two: 
stages in the process of thinking are both commonly 
neglected: first, the elaborately constructed object 
lesson as the strong embodiment of an idea; second, 
the expansion of this idea through comparison to 
reasoned conclusions showing its larger scope. We 
have thrown the whole weight of our argument upon 
the enlargement and intensification of these two stages. 
Out of this conviction springs the demand for the 
enlarged unit of study which lays a solid foundation 
for a well thought-out organization of knowledge. Fhe 
Virginia Plantation honestly and thoroughly mastered 
as an important center of organized knowledge is 
believed to be worth more than any amount of mere 
facts and knowledge frailties. 
QUESTIONS AND PROJECTS 
1. To what extent is the description of the land system of early 
Virginia and of the other colonies a proper introduction to the 
plantation project? 
2. In how many different ways were lands distributed or sold 
in the various colonies as a means of encouraging settlement? 
8. This chapter furnishes a description of the Virginia Planta- 
tion, its mode of life, and its manner of conducting plantation 
enterprises. In the classroom this would naturally resolve itself 
into a series of projects in plantation management. These may be 
suggested as follows: 
a. As a prospective planter looking for a site upon which to 
locate such a plantation of about 5,000 acres, what would be your 
main considerations? 
b.. After having selected the site for such a plantation make a 
survey of it and construct a map showing the location of the home 
house, slave quarters, overseers’ houses, fields, stables, pastures, 
woods, etc. 
c. Let each child make a map on a simple scale showing the 
general plan and layout of the whole plantation; the division of

‘he entire estate into separate farms for management purposes 
would require another map. 
d. The planning of roads, bridges, gates, fences, and highways to 
neighboring plantations. 
e. The training of slaves in skill and efficiency as carpenters, 
blacksmiths, coopers, tanners, weavers, etc. 
f. The arrangement and conduct of domestic affairs in the 
household and the control of house servants. 
g. Care of the home garden and orchard and assignment of 
gardens to overseers’ families and to the slave households. 
h. Providing lumber for the construction and upkeep of houses, 
stables, carpenter and cooper shops, fencing, tobacco sheds, etc. 
t. The raising and curing of tobacco and the storing and later 
shipment of grain and tobacco. Also the keeping of accounts with 
the British merchants at Bristol or, London. 
j. The general supervision of spinners and weavers by the matron 
of the household. 
k. The general supervision of plantation workers and provision 
for slaves in health and in sickness. 
l, Care and breeding of thoroughbred stock, such as cattle and 
horses, sheep and hogs. 
m. The slaughtering of cattle and hogs, and the smoking, curing, 
and packing of meats in the fall; also the tanning of the hides for 
various uses. 
n. The entertainment of guests and visitors from more distant 
plantations. 
o. The ordering of a bill of necessaries and luxuries from the 
British agent in England. 
4. Observe the effects of the plantation system of labor and of 
social life upon the character of the planter and his family. 
5. Observe the effects of the plantation system upon the economic 
development of the South. 
6. The contrast with the land and labor system as it developed 
in the North is of marked significance.

CHAPTER VI 
THE GERMINATION AND GROWTH OF IDEAS 
IN LARGE UNITS OF STUDY 
The analogy of plant growth. — The conditions under 
which ideas spring into life and wax strong have called 
forth the best reflective thought of educators. Since 
the days of Comenius and probably long before, the 
resemblance of ideas to plants in the growing process 
has been noted and enforced. This analogy suggests 
the two steps in the process of thinking, the genesis 
or germination of ideas and their later growth and 
cultivation. The analogy of plant growth suggests 
further that ideational activity is a continuous process 
of development. An idea is not a static condition or 
product, but a thought movement based on a trans- 
mission of nervous energy. Our recent psychology is 
a psychology of movement, of pathways of nervous 
effort, corresponding to ideo-motor action. Thought 
getting is not the bodily transfer of ideas to the memory 
for storage — not a static collection, but it is an active 
fusion of old and new trains of thought by assimilation. 
In learning the mind forges into new realms, holding 
fast to its old ideas as magnets with which to attract 
and interpret the new, and vice versa. 
In considering the conditions under which ideas 
spring up and grow during the school period, we may 
take for granted the early development of sensation 
185

~~ HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
ide perception, of ‘sallaktstod] of reason and will as 
treated in the psychologies. This assumption being 
made, how do children apply themselves to the acqui- 
sition and further expansion of their ideas? In their 
studies children are regularly confronted with new 
situations, new projects which are more or less difficult 
to interpret. In fact it is the business of the school 
to bring on these difficulties in an orderly series and to 
introduce the strangers one after another. Let it 
further be granted that we have been fortunate in the 
selection of the main ideas in each study. So we are 
face to face with this problem of the genesis and 
development of such thoughts in the child’s mind. 
) The parable of the mustard seed is the unapproach- 
| able illustration of this process: ‘‘Another parable put 
he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven 
is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and 
sowed in his field, which indeed is the least of all seeds; 
but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and 
becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and 
lodge in the branches thereof.” By the use of this 
analogy Jesus was planting the idea of the new kingdom 
in the minds of his disciples. 
Conditions for germination and growth. — The chief 
business of the teacher is to plant and cultivate ideas 
in the minds of children. Under favorable conditions 
they will germinate and spring into conscious life. What 
are these conditions? 
The gardener who wants a good crop pays careful 
attention to the selection of his seeds and to the right 
soil conditions, to warmth and moisture at the plant- 
ing time. The teacher has a similar program to follow
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 187 
in the cultivation of ideas: first, a careful choice of 
those potential ideas most worth cultivating; second, 
a study of the mental conditions under which ideas 
germinate; and, third, wise cultivation. Those seeds 
in gardens which fail to sprout and grow are a measure 
of wasted effort. In the same way those ideas which 
do not germinate in the mind are dead and worse than 
useless. In teaching there may be much greater rela- 
tive waste than in gardening. 
Growth is the chief thing. — But the one indispen- 
sable thing in both cases is spontaneous, healthy life 
and growth. Every idea, like a young oak, must 
grow or perish. How many so-called ideas are planted 
in children’s minds which lack this one essential — the 
life energy! One acorn sprouting into life is worth 
a thousand or a million rotting in the ground without 
sending up a shoot. A single idea actually opening 
up and expanding in one human mind is a potential 
force and may change the history of the world. In 
fact it has so happened many and many a time. A 
million ideas stillborn fade into nothing. How to get 
a few of the best ideas to growing naturally in a child’s 
mind is the thing of chief import in education. Other 
things are important and necessary, but this is pre- 
eminently the chief thing. 
Ideas like tender plants. — To provide all the con- 
ditions favorable to the planting and growth of ideas 
in children’s minds is a serious task because it is so 
easy to neglect or overlook one or more of the essen- 
tials. Going back to our analogy, observe that seeds 
do not thrive, do not even sprout in a dry soil. If one 
important condition is lacking, all the others are
-P-A-G-E-196
  188 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
rendered useless. In the western United States are 
millions of acres of good land, fertile soil, warm sunlight, 
with only one condition lacking — moisture. The re- 
sult is a desert. A teacher may possess three essential 
qualities, and absence of the fourth nullifies the whole. 
The time for extreme care is the period when seeds are 
germinating and, a little later, when plants are young 
and tender. Young ideas too are tender plants and 
sensitive to environment. They shrivel up at the 
touch of harsh and unfriendly conditions. Ideas are 
easily frosted and killed, especially the best ones. They 
are very delicate plants. They must have a favoring, 
friendly, almost motherly atmosphere. Imagine, if 
you can, a harsh, severe teacher guiding a reading class 
through A Christmas Carol or The King of the Golden 
River or Evangeline or the Twenty-third Psalm. It is 
unthinkable. But even where the higher sentiments 
are not involved, all the conditions favorable to a full, 
wholesome mental awakening must be taken into 
account. 
The planting of one organizing idea a great achieve- 
ment. — The planting of one productive, organizing 
idea in the mind of a child so that it shoots up into a 
vigorous growth is a notable and worthy achievement. 
It is not a piece of routine work like learning an addi- 
tion table or the rote memorizing of a poem. To 
preside over the planting and germination of one fruit- 
ful idea in a child’s mind is a high point of superiority 
in a first-class teacher. It is the complete initiation 
of a thought movement destined to develop and or- 
ganize experiences through life. One strong, good idea 
rooted in a child’s mind and well started on its proper
-P-A-G-E-197
THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 189 
career sets the standard toward which all best things 
tend. A real nucleus has been formed around which 
to organize and develop a life purpose. It is the vital, 
essential thing in instruction, and every term in school 
should see a few such important things happen, a few 
life centers established around which knowledge has 
begun to organize, and a thought movement initiated 
which is to go on. 
A child is fortunate who can find one teacher in a 
single study who can give him this kind of start in 
his thinking. The strength and quality of this sort 
of thought, once originated in any study, tend to 
spread outward into other studies and forward into 
life. It is a sad experience for any child to go through 
school without having discovered a single one of these 
fountains of knowledge which pours out its treasures 
in an endless stream. We have one very good example 
which is precisely to the point. At the close of his 
remarkable conversation with the woman at the well, 
Jesus said, “But whosoever drinketh of the water that 
I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that 
I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing 
up into everlasting life.’ In the best sense teachers 
wish to open up fountains of living thought which are 
perennial and inexhaustible. For such is the nature 
of the best ideas operating in their full strength. 
One idea of large and growing importance in the life 
of the people is the improvement of city life by the 
introduction of sanitary and beautifying conditions. 
The remarkable era of reconstruction of Vienna after 
1858 by which a dirty, unhealthful, medieval city 
was completely overhauled in the interest of modern
-P-A-G-E-198
199 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
sanitary and social science may serve to illustrate our 
theme — the conditions for the germination of strong 
ideas in the mind. 
Illustration of Vienna. — Vienna was up to 1858 one 
of the worst-conditioned capitals of Europe. It con- 
sisted of about 600,000 people crowded into a square 
mile of territory and hemmed in by a heavy medieval 
wall, moat, and glacis. The streets were narrow, 
crooked, and dirty. There was no satisfactory water 
and sewage system. Pestilence prevailed, and the 
death rate was very high, about forty-two to the 
thousand yearly. People were crowded into damp cel- 
lars and small garrets. With a rapidly growing popu- 
lation there was no chance for expansion because of 
the mighty encircling wall. The villages that had 
sprung up outside of the city were wretched suburbs 
without proper plan or street connection with the 
city. 
This was the condition of Vienna during the early 
years of the rule of Francis Joseph. An idea came to 
the young king, and under his enlightened leadership 
a royal commission of trained engineers, sanitary ex- 
perts, and architects was organized which in a few 
years worked out a comprehensive plan for enlarging 
and rebuilding the city, 1848-57. It was the idea of a 
complete reconstruction of the city of Vienna. 
The wall, ditch, and a considerable strip of land 
beyond them and encircling the city were public prop- 
erty. Under the lead of Francis Joseph the royal 
commission decided to level the great wall, to fill up 
the ditch, and, taking advantage of this broad circle of 
free territory which in area was almost equal to that 
|
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 191 
of the inner city, to work out a magnificent scheme of 
public improvement. 
Beginning in 1858 three years were employed in 
demolishing the useless medieval walls and in leveling 
and clearing the space. In the meantime a complete 
scheme for rebuilding and beautifying the city had 
been planned with the idea of converting this cleared 
zone into a great circle of parks and boulevards with 
broad and commanding spaces for imposing national 
buildings in a proper setting of lawns, shrubbery, and 
trees. One broad circling boulevard passing through 
the middle of this cleared zone and completely girdling 
the old city formed the basis for the reconstruction of 
the street plan of the enlarged capital. The noble 
Ringstrasse, from one hundred fifty to two hundred 
feet wide, with its adjacent pleasure grounds and its 
remarkable series of public buildings, was thus the 
outward result of this broad-minded effort to rebuild 
and modernize a great city. The expansion of the 
city beyond the Ringstrasse along the line of broad 
avenues radiating outward from it brought into exist- 
ence the much larger modern city of Vienna. 
At the same time, in the interest of improved sanitary 
and other requirements, the old inner city was re- 
modeled, its narrow streets straightened and widened, 
and broad connecting thoroughfares opened up. This 
involved a large destruction of old buildings and recon- 
struction on a superior plan. Improved city housing 
with abandonment of cellars and garrets was aimed at. 
These improvements of the street plan of the city were 
attended with wholesale and costly betterments in 
sanitary and municipal equipments. A complete and
-P-A-G-E-200
ce mee Te ene ee meme reer ee 
192 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
adequate water system was projected with a great 
aqueduct which brought pure mountain water from 
the Alps, eighty miles distant, and distributed it 
through water mains arranged according to the new 
street plan. A reorganization and extension of the 
sewer system was provided, and a great trunk sewer 
was built which collected and carried the waste and 
sewage of the city into the Danube several miles below. 
The construction of extensive public markets and abat- 
toirs, or slaughterhouses, for the inspection and super- 
vision of food supplies further contributed to more 
sanitary modes of living. At the same time was under- 
taken the construction, at liberal expense, of new and 
ample school buildings, and a complete system of 
popular education for all classes was worked out. 
These municipal betterments, especially those of a 
sanitary character, greatly improved the health condi- 
tions in the city and reduced correspondingly the death 
rate. This means the saving of the lives of many 
thousands of people each year by improved sanitary 
conditions in one city alone. In the end, for the 
enlarged city, this meant twenty lives were saved each 
year for every thousand of the population owing to 
the improved sanitary conditions, or forty thousand 
lives in all, yearly. 
The idea of rebuilding Vienna, thus briefly described, 
merely illustrates what has taken place during the last 
fifty years not only in Vienna but in Berlin, in Buda- 
Pesth, in Glasgow, in Naples, and in nearly all the 
large European cities. Our American cities have also 
had the same problems to deal with, and even smaller 
cities and towns must make provision for pure water,
-P-A-G-E-201
  
THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 193 
for sewage disposal, for street improvement, hospitals, 
parks, and public buildings. The problem is much 
the same for all cities and towns the world over. 
How to lodge ideas in the mind. — It will be allowed 
that the one idea of city improvement as illustrated 
by Vienna, on account of its universal importance to 
the welfare of the people in all cities and towns, deserves 
to be thoroughly appreciated by children. Nor is it 
a matter of mere information but of clear and strong 
conviction as to what must be done if society is to 
protect itself. How is such a convincing idea to ger- 
minate and get a strong initial growth in the mind? If 
one wished to influence a city council or a body of 
citizens to take action in a similar case of city improve- 
ment, how could one bring this idea home to them in 
such a way as to be conclusively convincing? How 
may an idea find lodgment in a child’s mind so that 
it will take deep root and, like a living shoot grafted 
into an apple tree, take up into itself the full strength 
of the mind into which it has been grafted? It seems 
apparent that an adequate description of the whole 
situation, the idea in its full life setting, is necessary 
before the mind can render to itself any judgment. 
The more complete the demonstration of an idea in 
all its essential, concrete relations, the more convincing 
is its effect. An idea clearly seen in its main bearings 
in some concrete illustration is overwhelming as a 
demonstration of truth. Whether an idea takes root 
in the mind or not depends upon whether the mind 
itself is converted into a soil and an environment in 
which this idea can take deep hold. Ideas do not 
sprout in an empty mind or in a vacuum. Somehow  
-P-A-G-E-202
ee eres TN MMe EE ete er eee eee CP aMMeE TS esa eae see cy eee 
194 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
a fertile, receptive, and favoring mental environment 
must be supplied, else ideas can get no living hold. 
The generative environment for an idea. — The pre- 
sumption is that in approaching some new problem the 
learning mind is not in full possession of the body of 
facts and relations upon which its meaning rests. At 
any rate it is necessary to bring together old facts and 
new and to combine them into a complete setting favor- 
able to the hearty reception of the new idea. In other 
words it is necessary to build up a soil and to create 
an environment in which an idea may germinate. Any 
idea important enough to command our attention rests 
upon a complex combination of facts so grouped as 
to throw this idea clearly into prominence. For the 
time being it gains a complete monopoly of attention 
and interest. It is difficult to see how this idea can 
come into existence or can be recognized in its true 
value except as it emerges into view as naturally 
springing out of this complex generative environ- 
ment. 
No short cut to ideas. — One conclusion that may 
be drawn from such considerations is that there is no 
abbreviated or short process for propagating ideas in 
the mind. Just as good seeds. require soil and warmth 
and moisture and favoring protection and adequate 
time for natural germination, so with ideas. The 
process can not be hastened without serious damage. 
All our impatience for quick results must stop short 
out of respect for the mind’s natural and rightful modes 
of action. It is both presumptuous and stupid to try 
to force nature. And yet, in spite of this warning, the 
short-cut method, the bobtailed process of giving chil-  
-P-A-G-E-203
THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 195 
dren condensed, generalized statements as substitutes 
for ideas is common practice among teachers. It is 
a common folly. An idea thus shorn of its vital rela- 
tions and trimmed down to the brief dimensions of a 
formal textbook statement is like a bird stripped of 
feathers, helpless, ugly, and out of all relation to life. 
This effort to strip ideas of their proper and decent 
clothing deserves to be harshly punished because it 
is an unwitting crime against childhood. An idea 
must be well-feathered, else it will remain unfledged 
and never get out of the nest. These full-fledged ideas 
are the messengers of the mind which function in the 
world. They arouse and strengthen the child’s own 
potential energies. 
The controlling ideas are few.— The number of 
important ideas in one study and in all studies is not so 
great but that we can well afford to grant ample time 
and circumstance for their complete natural germina- 
tion. Otherwise education is a fraud. There is no 
ground for haste or anxiety lest children may not com- 
pass a prescribed quantity of knowledge. Ideas are 
not quantitative and can not be scored on that basis. 
The leading ideas are far too important to be measured 
on quantitative standards. 
If then these ideas are so all-important and if we can 
afford to give them all the time necessary to their 
complete germination and growth, the question how 
to provide these conditions becomes the significant 
problem. What are these conditions? Let us say it 
over again: 
An idea, like a plant, requires a favorable habitat, 
that is, a complete environment that provides for its
-P-A-G-E-204
196 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
germination and continuous growth. In order to raise 
a banana tree in our Northern climate, we must create 
in the plant house the conditions of soil and moisture, 
of warmth and sunshine corresponding to the tropics. 
Every idea requires for its nourishment and complete 
growth a peculiar and appropriate habitat. If this 
point of view is correct, that a single idea is important 
enough to set the teacher to the serious task of creating 
a special environment in which it can grow and thrive, 
he may get a new and surprising notion of what teach- 
ing is. The plant house is an elaborate and expensive 
luxury. It requires much intelligence, labor, and ex- 
pense to provide it. If the teacher is called upon to 
expend a corresponding amount of thought and effort 
in housing one idea or in getting children to house it, 
he has, to say the least, a highly enterprising and 
extensive task. At first view this may appear as an 
unheard-of, a preposterous extension of the teacher’s 
problem. It is certainly no trifle. On the other hand 
it may suggest the simplest way for getting the result 
at which we aim. We fall back here upon our main 
proposition. A few big, full topics are better than a 
host of cramped and undeveloped ones. A few impor- 
tant ideas organize and simplify the whole field of 
knowledge. We are beginning to see that big ideas 
demand the major part of our attention and effort in 
school studies. In literature, such as we use in the 
schools, this conclusion is now acknowledged in its full 
breadth. Our best writers, like Scott and Hawthorne, 
require a whole book or story in which to create the 
full environment for a single idea, as Ivanhoe, The 
Scarlet Letter, and The Great Stone Face.  
-P-A-G-E-205
  THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 197 
The home idea. — We are now called upon to re- 
adjust our mental vision, to expand our thoughts to 
the comprehensive meaning of the big unit of study as 
the embodiment of an idea. If we desire, for example, 
to cultivate in children a full appreciation of the modern 
dwelling house as an ideal home for the family, how 
should we go about the task? I fear that certain of 
us, as schoolmasters, would sum it up in one brief 
sentence and describe it thus: “It is a building of nine 
rooms with living room, dining room, kitchen, bath- 
room, sleeping rooms and sun parlor, basement and 
garret, with furnace heat, all modern improvements, 
and favorably located.” This is the condensed real 
estate formula for the description of a house, and such 
condensations are now the vogue. But the home idea 
is something totally different from this blunt, trite 
phraseology of the real estate agent. Even a palace 
gorgeously described might well miss the whole point. 
We can approach this idea through several different 
studies and allow it thus to develop gradually to its 
full, generous meaning. It may begin early in a fairy 
tale like Beauty and the Beast or the Bible story of 
Samuel or Hawthorne’s story, The Great Stone Face. 
In the home geography of the third or fourth grade, it 
may further develop one of its phases in lessons on 
house construction. From time to time the children 
may be taken to see and observe closely a house in 
process of building. They watch the basement excava- 
tion, the walls, and drainage with the relation to water 
main and sewer, if in town. The floor plans of the 
architect or contractor may be examined and discussed 
in class with reference to good arrangement and wise
-P-A-G-E-206
  198 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
provision for family use. The rough framework of the 
beginning structure is of particular interest. The 
corner posts, joists, beams, and supports reveal the 
strong skeleton of the structure. While the building 
is in this preliminary stage of construction, they may 
observe the arrangements for water and steam pipes, 
the ventilating shafts, the electric wiring, the soil pipe 
and plumbing, the gas pipes, the chimneys, the posi- 
tions of doors and windows. The special conveniences 
are noted for pantry and kitchen arrangements, the 
toilets, the closets for clothing, and the use of waste 
room for storage. A later visit will give opportunity 
to study the interior finish of millwork in doors, panels, 
floors, mantels, stairways, the carved woodwork, the 
painting, filling, and varnishing of woods, the decora- 
tion of walls, the tinting and color scheme of rooms. 
Finally the equipment of rooms with furniture, books, 
pictures, curtains, piano, and other home needs and 
conveniences for use or entertainment or ornament 
helps to express the real meaning of the home idea, at 
least this aspect of the house and its equipment. All 
these worked out in their proper relations and judged 
from the standpoint of the original plan are means of 
giving children a more or less adequate sense of the 
things needful for the standard house as ahome. Even 
the yard with its grass plots and shady nooks is worthy 
of careful thought. The home garden also with its 
vegetables and fruits for use in the home and the 
labors connected with the care and cultivation, the 
storage and preparation of the same are a part of this 
home. The chicken house and barn may demand the 
same consideration.
-P-A-G-E-207
THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 199 
What a variety of materials, of tools and processes, 
and of skilled workmen drawn from distant places 
must work together to produce what we call a con- 
venient and complete home! 
Again an observation of this house in relation to the 
city water supply, to the gas main, to the electric 
circuits, to sewage disposal, to street paving and good 
roads, to electric cars and stations, to markets and 
schools and churches brings to mind a whole group of 
important questions, social, industrial, and educational. 
Also sanitary and health problems are broached which 
bring out clearly the intimate relation of this home to 
the larger community. 
The idea of what the home and its environment 
ought to be does not spring up in a moment or out of 
one short sentence or definition. It is an idea that 
comes to life with the growth of a natural experience, 
the opening up of a complete environment, and this 
only gradually brought to consciousness. It is full of 
experiences that should be keenly felt and fully ap- 
preciated because they lie at the basis of all studies. 
The idea is too important and fundamental to allow 
hasty or barren treatment. In fact what is thus far 
suggested is merely the beginning of a much richer 
development of thought. We need to draw upon 
poetry and music and biography and social life to give 
this home idea its true meaning. Biography and litera- 
ture are full of the home idea, A Christmas Carol, 
Snow-bound, The Cotter’s Saturday Night, My Ain 
Fireside, and many others. 
It would be an achievement of no small concern to 
society if every child in the school should grow by 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
200 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
degrees into a sensible and convincing respect for the 
home as it ought to be, for the standards of home 
living regarding comfort, convenience, and sanitation, 
touching also the home relations and family affections, 
that is, the better spirit of the home as exemplified for 
example in Snow-bound. The ideal is the home in 
the “house beautiful.” : 
In summing up this suggested treatment of the 
home idea we may say that it is the function of the 
school to produce an environment of home experience 
and of home ideals in which this concept of home may 
come to life and flourish. 
The original productive environment of an idea. — 
If we go back to the situation in which an important 
idea originated, the historical conditions out of which 
it first emerged into prominence, we shall find its vivid 
and full explanation. In other words a given set of 
conditions necessarily gives birth to an idea. The 
idea of self-government in the town meeting sprang 
up in the early settlements of New England as a natural 
outgrowth of those conditions. Its appearance at that 
time was almost spontaneous. If we desire to have 
children understand this idea of self-government, de- 
scribe with elaborate fulness the town-meeting life and 
the pioneer Puritan’s method of managing his local 
affairs. This concept will be seen coming forth of 
necessity, showing itself clearly as the key to the solu- 
tion of his problems. The invention of the cotton gin 
came at the nick of time, just as the conditions were 
ripe for it. Give this environment and the conjunc- 
tion of causes producing it, and you have the idea in 
its real essence. Our American Revolution and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 201 
idea of freedom that centered in it arose out of condi- 
tions that inevitably produced it. The first mowers 
and reapers followed closely the expansion of our agri- 
culture over the broad fields of Illinois and the West 
when the old method of scythe and cradle no longer 
satisfied the enlarged Western conditions. The press- 
ing need for closer and stronger union of the thirteen 
colonies in 1787 was so keenly felt by the leading 
men that they found themselves under an imperative 
necessity of erecting a new state, a federated govern- 
ment. 
Great ideas and institutions based upon them spring 
up under environments that naturally produce them. 
This suggests clearly that, if we wish certain ideas to 
spring up in the minds of children, we should reproduce 
in as vivid a form as possible the actual facts and condi- 
tions of the original environment from which they 
came. Transplant the children completely into that 
environment. It requires an elaborate effort of con- 
structive imagination, building up complete life pic- 
tures out of abundant lifelike material. The historian 
who possesses the historical imagination, out of the 
fulness of his knowledge, is able to set these great 
pictures before us. This is exactly what the best 
historical novelist does or tries to do. Ivanhoe appears 
under feudal conditions on horseback, clad in armor 
with lance in rest or riding up to strike the ringing 
plate as a challenge to his Norman adversaries. The 
idea of feudal heroism demands that the knight be 
so accoutered and so surrounded. Under a different 
environment such a knight would be a meaningless and 
even ridiculous figure. Each idea has its appropriate 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
    202 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
setting and, shorn of this setting, has no meaning or 
else a perverted and ridiculous meaning. 
Dull verbal statements. — A mere statement of an 
idea stripped of its accessories and conditioning cir- 
cumstances is verbal jargon. We are familiar with the 
expression, ‘‘Words, words, words.”’ Take for illustra- 
tion the following statements from two of our standard 
grammar-school texts in history: ‘The English idea 
of representative government signified representation 
of all classes of the community and not at all repre- 
sentation by population.” The trained historian would 
understand this, but for the child it is necessary to give 
a full statement of the situation in England, showing 
how the right to vote was distributed and exercised. 
A second instance: “It was Thomas Jefferson, Presi- 
dent of the United States from 1801-1809, whose 
sound democratic instincts and robust political philos- 
ophy prevented the Federal Government from becom- 
ing too closely allied with the interests of political 
classes and helped to make it what it should be—a 
government of the people, by the people, for the 
people.” A student well versed in our history would 
have to think closely to grasp the full meaning of this 
sentence. It is doubtful whether a full chapter of 
illustrative political and biographical description would 
place a sufficient environment around this sentence to 
make it fully intelligible to an average school child. 
It requires time and circumstances and a picture- 
building imagination to clothe an idea with these vivid 
surroundings which reveal it in a clear life meaning. 
Thus far in this chapter we have been discussing the 
germination and growth of ideas in their beginning
-P-A-G-E-211
  
THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 203 
stage, when they first break forth into full meaning. 
The later development of these ideas as they go on 
expanding through the course of study is discussed 
further on. But this initial stage in the development 
of thought is of vast importance. It is the springtime 
of knowledge and it calls for a bounteous use of rich 
sensory and source materials. 
Growth of the idea of representative government. — 
The original permanent stronghold of thought in any 
study is a group of simple but large ideas whose gradual 
mastery leads up to a broad survey and control of the 
whole study. In American history such a fundamental 
idea appears in the growth of the law-making power. 
Beginning in a small way in the earliest legislatures of 
the colonies, the idea of self-government through their 
own chosen representatives grew into a controlling 
influence backed by an overwhelming sentiment among 
the people in each colony. Under the Constitution 
this idea took on much larger proportions and broad- 
ened to meet the necessities of an enlarging population 
and territory. At the present time this idea is still 
powerfully operative in our state legislatures, in city 
councils, and in our National Congress and is one of 
the chief agencies for working out the solution of our 
political and social problems. At every stage of its 
growing influence this idea can be illustrated by strik- 
ing typical examples advancing from the earlier simple 
forms to the later and more complex. A few such 
ideas, developing continuously through our history and 
properly interrelated, constitute the backbone of our 
historical study. 
But a warning against misunderstanding is here 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
    204 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
necessary. Not the final abstractions of mature scien- 
tific thinkers are here aimed at but the root ideas spring- 
ing out of concrete experimental studies and pointing 
toward larger thought developments. 
It is no small task to pick out these simple, central, 
and far-reaching truths. It can hardly be called unkind 
criticism of our textbooks and courses of study to say 
that they have not yet sufficiently isolated the few 
underlying, continuously developing ideas in each study 
from a burdensome mass of mere facts. If we can get 
at the main centers of thought in the right way, the 
secondary facts will easily find their proper places and 
meanings. 
Ideas are standard measures. — This doubly sifted 
and rigidly selected thought material of the best studies 
is of supreme importance. The world’s enduring 
wealth is treasured in these ideas. Other kinds of 
wealth perish in the using, but these social ideas and 
principles, thus far wrought out through ages of con- 
flict, are a kind of wealth for which we have no adequate 
standards of measurement. They are themselves the 
standards upon which the worth of other things is 
measured. This increasing fund of ideas is the gift 
of one age to the next, but the manner in which this gift 
is handed over to the children is the important thing. 
It is this hoarded treasury of imperishable thought 
that the teacher guards. It is also his stock in trade. 
It is an intangible asset not easily made manifest to 
the worldly-minded. Yet it is our main reliance. 
Select diamonds are valuable, but select ideas are in- 
valuable. We could not afford to trade off the parable 
of the Good Samaritan for the greatest railroad system
-P-A-G-E-213
  
THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 205 
with full equipment. Mrs. Browning’s poem, The Cry 
of the Children, is a greater source of strength to 
England than a battleship. 
The genuine school course is made up of the choice 
part of this best thought inheritance, and the teacher 
is not only the custodian of this treasure but the banker 
who puts it into circulation and provides for its wide- 
spread service. He transplants these ideas into the 
fresh soil of the oncoming youth, giving them a better 
chance than ever to grow into a full fruitage. 
To pick out the few choice stories, ballads, and 
biographies, the lasting folk songs, hymns, and na- 
tional tunes, the striking types of mountains, cities, and 
industries, the representative trees, plants, and insects; 
to arrange them into a well-ordered series for boys and 
girls — this is the problem of the curriculum. 
When the selection and arrangement of this treasury 
of ideas has been wisely accomplished, the still greater 
task remains to find the teachers who are skilled “to 
bring forth from this treasure things new and old.” 
Such at least is our ideal. 
Forms and symbols. — But, alas, obstructions are 
thrust in between the teacher and his program of ideas. 
Other cares and duties preoccupy his mind and conceal 
his chief duty — to plant and to cultivate in children’s 
minds the best ideas — to put every child in possession 
of his main inheritance of thought. The attention of 
children, likewise, is drawn away by other demands. 
First, there is necessarily imposed upon children a 
mastery of the forms and symbols required to express 
knowledge. There are alphabets and primers, correct 
forms and usages in language, the irregularities and
-P-A-G-E-214
    206 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
eccentricities of English spelling, forms and movements 
in writing, figures and symbols of arithmetic, punc- 
tuation marks and their uses, diacritical signs used in 
dictionaries, notation in music, styles of letter writing 
and composition, customary drills in phonic sounds, 
and oral reading. These conventionalities with the 
repetitions, drills, and written tests necessary to their 
mastery and correct use demand a large share of time. 
They are often put first in school courses and are given 
the main consideration. They are necessary but may 
be overemphasized. 
Nicety of skill. — In addition to a reasonable mastery | 
of these necessary forms teachers are tempted to sub- 
stitute for ideal education a set of schoolmasterish 
accomplishments in the superior control and expert use 
of these forms, such as excessivé néatness and perfect 
style in writing, faultless diagrams of sentences, beauti- 
fully executed maps, skillful tool practice and execu- 
tion in manual training, the perfect finish of a penrack, 
desk, or picture frame, marked ability to spell curious 
and unusual words, elaborate elocutionary drills, showy 
exhibits of pictures, drawings, or constructive work, 
finished up perhaps by the teacher. These favorite 
school arts easily gain the upper hand and even the 
monopoly of school effort. Neatly and handsomely 
done they are deemed worthy of great praise. But 
the schoolmaster should remember that the most beau- 
tiful illuminated manuscripts were made at a time when 
learning itself in the hands of the monks had reached an 
absolute standstill. People had stopped thinking. 
Overdone these school arts produce mental stag- 
nation whether of the individual or of the school. A
-P-A-G-E-215
THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 207 
school system thus fossilized needs a reformer who will 
pour the new wine of expanding ideas into these cher- 
ished forms and shatter them. We can not pile up 
these formalities high enough and broad enough but 
that a single idea will explode the whole. 
Education is based primarily not upon perfection of 
conventional forms or upon nicety of expert execution 
but upon the strength and vitality of the dominant 
ideas. Wherever powerful ideas take possession of a 
child’s mind, these formalities are swallowed up in 
greater things. “The letter killeth, but the spirit maketh 
alive.” 
Materialism.— Another serious interference with 
the teacher’s true work in the planting and culture of 
ideas is what may be called didactic materialism, that is, 
the devotion to materialistic, low-grade knowledge. 
Facts are measured out quantitatively, as it were, by 
the bushel or barrel or carload. The quality and 
worth of ideas can not be measured by such standards. 
We live in an age overshadowed by a dull, fact-cramming 
materialism, and our school work has taken on the dull 
spirit and color of its materialistic environment. 
The subject matter of the school course is gross, cumber- 
some, and complex. ‘To the child it seems endless and 
impenetrable, and even to the teacher its quantity is 
confusing and distressing. The whole mass needs to be 
lightened and spiritualized. The predominance of a 
few great ideas would simplify and expose its inner 
structure and meaning. 
A pious fraud.— There is a strong semblance of 
knowledge in our textbooks and many a teacher is de- 
ceived thereby. But this purely formal kind of knowl-  
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
edge is half sham. The brief announcements of the 
book bear a bold front and appear to throw open the 
doorway of knowledge. But passing over this thresh- 
old we meet disappointment. We are practicing upon 
the children a sort of pious fraud. The show of knowl- 
edge is mostly in the flaming advertisement on'the out- 
side front. Our textbooks consist largely of these 
headlines and advertisements with a disappointing 
meagerness of real content. We find instead lists of 
facts, not full-fledged and expanding thoughts pricking 
the mind to action. They are mere collections of the 
epitaphs of knowledge rather than living and growing 
ideas. Our schoolbooks are heavy condensations, cyclo- 
pedias, indigestible chunks, names, or brief tabulated 
lists like the catalogue of a library. This is the mere 
external shell of knowledge. The important ideas lie 
concealed from the child in this mass of_rubbish. The 
old familiar phrases are almost justified — such knowl- 
edge is like a needle in a haystack, a few grains of wheat 
in a bushel of chaff. 
Dull commonplaces.— The following quotations 
from some of our standard texts illustrate the above 
statements. 
1. ‘New England is almost entirely made up of 
strong rocks, like those forming the Appalachian Moun- 
tains. It has a diversified surface, but along the coast 
it is generally low, especially in the three southern 
states. This upland was once a peneplain, that is, it 
was worn down by the action of the atmosphere and 
the rivers almost to the level of the sea. Later it was 
elevated to its present position and the lowland 
became an upland.”
-P-A-G-E-217
ee ee te eee 
THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 209 
2. “The imports of France are chiefly wool, raw silk, 
coal, cotton, and grain of which about one tenth in total 
value comes from the United States. Its exports are 
mainly silk and woolen manufactures and wine of which 
the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Germany receive 
the greater part.” 
8. “Moscow, another residence of the Czar, is but little 
smaller than St. Petersburg. Warsaw is a city larger 
than Boston and is an important center of manufacture 
and trade. Odessa is a flourishing modern city some- 
what larger than Cincinnati and the chief wheat ship- 
ping port. Karkof and Kief are large trade centers of 
the agricultural region and Riga is the great northern 
seaport. Each of these cities is about as large as 
Minneapolis.” 
These are average statements such as our geographies 
furnish ad infinitum, and they contain some information. 
But think of large textbooks filled from cover to cover 
with this mocking emptiness. The hours of youth are 
too precious to be spent in collecting this low-grade in- 
formation stuff. We put up with a degree of dullness in 
textbooks that would be nowhere else tolerated. Evena 
cheap daily newspaper would get at the root of thought 
in a more lively and significant way than this. 
The excessive variety and quantity of this low-grade 
information has been steadily increasing with the 
multiplication and extension of studies. The burden 
of trifling and undigested knowledge grows oppressive. 
The more such facts we gather into our textbooks the 
less intelligible they become, the more they produce a 
condition of mental stagnation, of mental dyspepsia, 
of mind paralysis.
-P-A-G-E-218
    210 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
This is what we mean by materialism in education, 
an increasing mass of facts, a decreasing power of in- 
sight into essential meanings. Facts well selected are 
indispensable. They furnish the soil for the planting 
and growth of ideas, but the excessive multiplication 
of humdrum facts obscures the whole range of knowl- 
edge. Requiring children to memorize and recite this 
sort of stuff from day to day produces a condition 
bordering on stupidity (even in bright minds). That 
these statements are somewhere near the truth any- 
one may convince himself who will take the pains to 
examine a class of older children from an average school 
where such drills are common. The almost utter lack 
of thought or power to interpret the meanings of the 
facts learned is a constant source of regret, if not of 
wonder. 
A greater surprise still is met in the discovery that 
even rich and fruitful thought studies, like science, 
history, and geography, are most beclouded with this 
overhanging materialism, this cumbersome load of ill- 
interpreted facts. 
Ideas, on the contrary, like lighthouses along the shore, 
should guide the student through the course of study. 
It is the nature of ideas to bring enlightenment and 
uplift, to unburden and liberate the mind, to send the 
light of intelligence flashing through the tangled mass 
of facts, and to bring order out of chaos. 
To continue piling up facts in the course of study 
after this dumpish fashion is to increase the mental 
confusion of children, to augment, if not to produce, 
stupidity. This is materialism in education in unhappy 
contrast to ideas and idealism.

  THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 211 
Three false substitutes for ideas. — We have thus 
mentioned three fraudulent substitutes for ideas, three 
prolific sources of dullness and excessive routine in our 
schools: first, the overemphasis of mere forms and 
symbols; second, the dexterities and showy accomplish- 
ments upon which the teacher’s heart is set; and, third, 
the fact-cramming materialism which overloads our 
school course with heavy, low-grade freight. 
It is the first duty of teachers to restore ideas to their 
rightful authority and leadership in education, to expel 
these usurpers or at least to reduce them to their proper 
subordinate position as servants to the lawfully con- 
stituted ruling ideas. Strong, vitalizing ideas, re- 
enforced by the influence of the teacher, are more than 
competent to break down these three long-established 
obstructions in the pathway of good teaching. 
What is the plan of campaign by which a decisive 
victory can be achieved against the combined forces of 
formalism, showy routine, and materialism? 
Children just entering the primary school stand face 
to face with the first obstacle, the forms and symbols. 
How shall thought invigorate the necessary form drills 
and exercises of primary reading? Many excellent 
primary teachers have struggled for years with the 
problem of yoking together thought and form. The 
victory over this difficulty has been won by giving the 
primacy to ideas and the second or subordinate place 
to forms. The current of vitalizing thought is the one 
stream which invigorates the whole of primary educa- 
tion. The classic stories, songs, games, nature studies, 
and poems which precede and accompany early reading 
exercises keep interesting and valuable thought always
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
} 
in the forefront. The child’s mind that from the earliest 
years is kept alert and expanding with vital ideas will 
bring a reénforcement to all reading exercises which no 
amount of word drills may supply. 
There is indeed some excuse for lack of thought in 
early primary reading, in writing, and in spelling. The 
mastery of symbols and word forms requires much 
labor without marked progress in thought. But an 
exclusive preoccupation of children, for weeks or months 
at a time, with word forms and sentence drills is danger- 
ous to mental growth and is not conducive to the best 
progress in reading itself. A child’s mind requires 
awakening and enrichment with ideas and in full meas- 
ure, even before the drills in reading begin as well as 
later and throughout the course. In all other studies 
where a knowledge and mastery of forms is required 
the same principle holds. 
The second obstruction to the child’s progress is built 
by the teacher himself directly across the pathway of 
knowledge. It is the teacher’s own preference for a 
highly developed skill in oral reading, in drawing, in 
elocution, in writing, in number drills, or even in con- 
structive work. It is the too early triumph of formal 
technique. The nicety of workmanship in small things 
and facile skill in execution are persuasive allurements 
to small minds. That boy is fortunate whose mind is 
too large to be taken in or whose teacher is too sensible 
to allow him to be satisfied with the graceful and showy 
penmanship of the commercial school or with the easy 
execution of a few rattling tunes on the violin. During 
the period of youthful growth, of continually enlarging 
conceptions, fine technical execution should never be
-P-A-G-E-221
  
THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 213 
set up as the main object. Children should be con- 
stantly outgrowing their present selves, casting off 
their old garments, like a caterpillar, by successive 
molts, pushing on rapidly to new and higher stages of 
growth in thought. There is no surer sign of arrested 
development, of the stoppage of the normal growth in 
both teacher and pupils than devotion to these pet drills 
and formal hobbies of the schoolmaster. In climbing up 
the rugged hill of knowledge the teacher (forgetting the 
law of growth) loves to stop midway to cultivate some 
small formal patch and to stay his pupils in this narrow 
enclosure. An eternal vigilance in keeping open the ave- 
nues of quickening thought and expanding intelligence is 
the only hope against this relapse into contented routine. 
Our present school course itself with its increasing 
accumulation of ill-assorted facts is the third principal 
obstruction in the pathway of a growing mind. Mind, 
in order to strengthen, must have mind nourishment to 
feed upon, not a preponderance of rank material sub- 
stance. From the dull monotony of encyclopedias and 
the ponderous materialism of our textbooks there is but 
one escape; namely, that into the inspiriting world of 
thought. There is but one cure for materialism and that 
is idealism. To simplify and reorganize our course 
of study around a hierarchy of ruling ideas — this is 
the manifest solution of the third great difficulty in 
education. 
From all these excursions into the fields of dullness 
and mental inertia, we return always to the source of 
power and light — ideas. 
Education begins and culminates in ideas. — Those 
studies which quicken growing minds should have the
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
preéminent leadership in education. There is to-day 
less controversy than formerly as to what the thought- 
provoking studies are. By common consent, though 
not without much grumbling, the unfruitful, thought- 
deficient studies, like spelling, writing, formal grammar, 
and reading, have been pushed into the background 
while the stoutly equipped burden-bearing thought 
studies have forged to the front as the real fighting 
squadron. The baggage train can bring up the facts. 
The thought life of children can not rise above the 
sources from which it springs. The territory, drained 
by the formal, instrumental studies is an arid land whose 
springs are mostly dried up. But the best parts of 
literature, biography, science, and geography abound 
in copious fountains of inspiriting thought. The 
whole force of education culminates in the progressive, 
stimulative ideas furnished by these studies, Their 
one purpose is to master the world from the standpoint 
of ideas, to unravel the tangled complexity of human 
affairs, and to make the solid world itself transparent. 
through the penetrating and interpretative power of 
thought. When we reach the heart of things in studies 
and in life, we are in touch with these central ideas as 
with nerve centers. The best writers among poets, 
scientists, and historians for both children and adults 
are already in this current and movement of thought. 
Their works are the visible expressions of these 
fundamental ideas. The purport of education is to 
complete the circuit by establishing the connection of 
each child’s mind with these vital ideas as sources of 
power. 
Education rests upon the conviction that ideas which
-P-A-G-E-223
  
THE GROWTH OF IDEAS 215 
become deeply rooted in childhood and youth grow into 
dominant power and control in later years. 
Many personal illustrations may be cited to show 
this concentration of influence in the channel of single 
ideas. Even in boyhood William Penn possessed 
strong religious convictions. He early conceived the 
idea of religious freedom and toleration, and it wrought 
so strongly upon his mind that he suffered long im- 
prisonment in loathsome jails in its defense and later 
exerted himself powerfully and successfully in obtaining 
relief for his persecuted friends. With his growing 
character and influence this conception of freedom of 
conscience in religious affairs evolved into such strength 
that he undertook at great expense of money and labor 
the liberal planting of this idea in the province of 
Pennsylvania. Through years of disappointment, tribu- 
lation, and anxiety he adhered to his deeply rooted con- 
viction and founded upon it one of the most influential 
and progressive commonwealths of modern times. 
Samuel Adams, at the age of twenty-one, in 1748, in 
his commencement oration at Harvard discussed the 
question: ‘Whether it be lawful to resist the supreme 
magistrate, if the commonwealth can not otherwise be 
preserved.” Twenty-one years later upon entering 
the Massachusetts Assembly he took up the gauntlet 
against the governor of the colony and the king of 
England. The simple right of Englishmen to govern 
themselves, to make their own laws, and dispose of 
their own property was the strong thought that sus- 
tained Samuel Adams and his companions in the eleven 
years of struggle with England which brought on the 
Revolution and has changed the politics of the world.

Summary 
~The origin and growth of ideas as they spring up and develop 
naturally in the child’s mind are matters of prime consideration in 
x planning a course of study. 
J For their germination and growth ideas require a complete, fav- 
orable habitat, a natural life environment. 
The biography of an idea is seen in the reconstruction of Vienna 
and in the growth of the concept of the home. The original en- 
vironment from which an idea sprang deserves a careful study. 
The growth of ideas has been interfered with by three powerful 
school tendencies: overemphasis of forms, showy dexterities, and 
the dull materialism of dry facts. 
The inspiring growth of ideas is the sole resource against these 
strong tendencies toward dullness and inertia. 
Each child should come into vital contact with these ideas as 
sources of power. They properly organize knowledge into tenden- 
cies and habits.

  CHAPTER VII 
THE ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED 
COURSE 
The tendency to scatter.—If the theory of a few 
basal types as a groundwork for the organization of 
knowledge is correct, the way may be opened for a 
surprising economy of effort in mastering studies. The 
need for such economies is apparent. Our present 
course has diffused itself widely and superficially over 
many diverse fields of knowledge. It is extravagantly 
loose-jointed and incoherent. With its manifold de- 
mands modern education shows a clearly marked im- 
pulse to scatter and to run at random through the 
newly opened territories of knowledge. Even the 
children have been turned loose in all directions on 
exploring trips. Thus the forces of education have 
been dispersed upon many different errands and have 
not yet returned to headquarters. It may be doubted 
whether we have any headquarters. Our new-found 
freedom to scatter abroad has not yet been fully satis- 
fied, and the return movement toward organization 
has scarcely set in with full strength. Yet this dis- 
bursement of mental effort over al the spheres and 
hemispheres of knowledge has set sober minds to think- 
ing. The broad road of “scatteration” in studies may 
be the road to failure if not to destruction. ‘‘For strait 
is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto 
life,” and fulness of life is what we properly covet.

Proofs furnished by well-organized units. — As a 
means of curbing this present broadcast tendency in 
education, we undertake to emphasize the basal sim- 
plicity of well-organized knowledge, that is, knowledge 
in which large thoughts function constructively. What 
are the tangible proofs that organization can correct the 
evils of our congested and weakly articulated course of 
study? A few big constructive object lessons in or- 
ganization springing directly from the heart of school 
studies are indispensable. Some of these have already 
been presented. The proposition is not merely to 
work out, exhibit, and emphasize these large teaching 
units but to group around them as developing centers 
of organized knowledge the essentials of a course of 
study. We are under obligation to present the proofs 
of a practically organized and thus simplified course. 
Prevention of waste. — On the negative side the 
purpose of reorganization is to eliminate waste, to get 
rid of the burdensome and superfluous materials that 
serve only to clog the progress of thought. A closer 
inquiry will bring to light a surprising amount of this 
unprofitable waste material. On the positive side 
organization economizes by centering effort upon the 
main productive channels of thought and experience. 
The large teaching unit—-a new term.— The 
chief instrument at hand for accomplishing this purpose 
of economical organization is the large teaching unit. 
It is a body of knowledge collected from different sources 
and unified on the basis of some constructive idea or 
purpose, as the Louisiana Purchase, illustrating our 
westward expansion. It is a rational thought move- 
ment combining into one organic whole an extensive  
-P-A-G-E-228
220 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
and varied collection of knowledge. We use other 
terms also to express this large assemblage of related 
facts, as unit of study, project, type study, enlarged object 
lesson, or instructional unit. The fact that we are com- 
pelled to make such elaborate efforts to explain the 
meaning of this term is proof that it is somewhat un- 
familiar and is only gradually finding its way into 
pedagogical literature. Yet it is the only approach to 
rational simplification. Perhaps the fact that we have 
no familiar term or phrase to express this ground or- 
ganization of knowledge into large units is proof that 
teachers as a rule have paid little attention to organiza- 
tion and have been satisfied with fragmentary and 
unrelated facts. Our textbooks and disjointed courses 
of study would lead us to the same conclusion. The 
familiar word ‘‘topic’” bears some resemblance to the 
unit of study, but it fails to connote that progressive 
organization around a center of thought, and it fails 
likewise to express the dynamic quality of growth and 
expansion in thought. 
The large organization of studies belated. — The 
active world outside of the school has been at work in 
recent years organizing and reorganizing its resources 
and its activities into larger and again into still larger 
units or wholes. Huge organizations of men, of capital, 
and of physical resources have become commonplace, 
eg. railroad systems, insurance companies, express 
agencies, the post office, the large city banks, the United 
States Steel Corporation, universities, and mail-order 
houses. While the business and industrial world has 
been learning and applying the lessons of economy from 
organization on a large scale, the schools have fallen
-P-A-G-E-229
ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 221 
behind. They are still busily repeating the names of 
isolated capes and bays and islands and towns and 
products and other miscellaneous facts, in the same 
old-fashioned routine, as if organization had never been 
heard of. As compared with practical life the schools 
are fifty years behind the times in the matter of the 
effective organization of knowledge materials. Modern 
business could not be carried on at all on such a dis- 
orderly basis. 
Children should be trained for an organized world. — 
Moreover it is now the recognized special duty of the 
school to fit children for the organized social and co- 
operative activities with which they are environed. 
The child will never understand this: world until he 
finds his way intelligently into these new and more 
complex organizations which society and business in 
their growth have achieved. This intimate relation 
between the organization of school studies and the 
organization of practical activities in society is no mere 
accident. It lies at the very center of our problem of 
the reconstruction of studies. The organizations seen 
in life about us are big, conspicuous object lessons, 
revealing clearly to teachers and children the powerful 
agencies that shape and dominate the world’s life. 
The child who plods along through school studies, 
memorizing lists of unrelated facts and miscellaneous 
data, is getting no taste of real life, is getting no grasp 
of the system of things to which he is shortly coming. 
All too soon he will be thrown into an active bustling 
world where persons and things are thoroughly organ- 
ized into large enterprises and developing projects. 
Many of the most important things will seem strange 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  222 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
and unaccountable to him, because this is not the kind 
of a world he has been studying about in the schools. 
He has learned the names of the rivers of Russia, the 
list of British kings, and the definitions of the eight 
parts of speech, but the open shop is a closed secret to 
him; the city water supply, whether it brings health 
or disease, is a mystery; even the electric current that 
lights the home and cooks the breakfast bacon comes 
from somewhere out of the great unknown. At home 
or from the newspapers the child may have learned 
something about these big social projects, but the 
school in its principal studies is tolerably immune from 
any close contact with life interests. It prefers a 
cloistered bookish curriculum of its own peculiar tradi- 
tional fabrication. To say the least, it has not yet 
found in the practical organizations of real life the basis 
for its own organization of school studies. 
A welcome task for the child. — If this is really the 
inviting task set before the child, to get the effective 
mastery of his environment in its own main features, 
the chief economy in education will be found in center- 
ing his energies upon this task in its typical problems. 
It is a welcome task to the child because nothing suits 
him better than to engage his thoughts and his active 
efforts with the ongoing activities and projects that 
face him in the doing world with which he is in perpetual 
contact. To turn the child away from this task into 
a bookish world of remote and disconnected facts and 
cloudy generalities which seldom hitch up with life 
projects is a sinful waste of youthful energy. That 
there is an enormous waste in fruitless efforts at study 
is painfully evident to any experienced teacher who has 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 223 
‘ observed the work in all grades from primary through 
the high school. 
Moreover, such waste is largely due to a bad ee 
tion and organization of materials in our commonly 
accepted course of study. Even a first-class teacher 
is seriously handicapped in being compelled to follow 
rigidly such a detailed course of study. Very much 
depends upon the resourcefulness of a good teacher, 
but every superintendent should remember that he can 
seriously cripple the best efforts of his superior teachers 
by laying down and requiring of all teachers a fixed, 
detailed routine of studies that has all the defects and 
faults of which we have been talking. 
Large units eliminate waste. — An instruction which 
is limited to well-selected teaching units relieves itself 
at one stroke of quantities of merely factual knowledge 
which till now has held a respectable place in our 
curriculum. This low-grade factual material, when 
brought into comparison with vital thought centers, 
is of such trifling worth that it can not maintain its 
respectability. To drop out this accumulation of 
deadwood from studies need not awaken our sympathy. 
Tradition has already kept it in place too long, and we 
may let it disappear without regrets. Even the dull 
lists of so-called important facts deserve to go the same 
road to oblivion unless they can be energized and asso- 
ciated with other materials so as to contribute to im- 
portant thought centers. Bare facts and miscellaneous 
collections of so-called important facts, which have 
not found their proper companionship in some well- 
organized group, are of no use to anybody. But just 
such facts grouped and welded together by a strong 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  224 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
aggressive purpose may be of supreme value. If we 
could once set up the true standards of value and, on 
this basis, clear the ground of all the waste material 
that now cumbers the course, we should then be able 
to organize studies on a simple plan. But this means 
laying the axe to the root of the tree and hewing out 
whatever is an offense. 
Poor arguments rejected. — The various arguments 
that have been set up in behalf of this static, materialis- 
tic, or merely factual knowledge — that it serves well 
the purpose of discipline; that the facts may possibly 
prove valuable upon some future occasion; that they 
furnish a broad survey of important fields — all these 
alike may be thrown into the discard. They are the 
patched-up defenses of a bad system. The labor 
wasted on this kind of dull, shallow study is far in excess 
of any value that can be derived from it. Besides, it 
has a negative, below-zero effect. It dulls and blurs 
the mental vision instead of making it sharp and keen. 
This bad effect is really its death warrant. It deserves 
to hang for the evil it has produced. We demand a 
course of study that is primarily qualified to stimulate 
the mind — not to blunt it or kill it. There is neces- 
sarily some uninspiring work to be done in all studies, 
but we need not go out of our way to increase dullness. 
We can far better afford to accentuate the live centers 
of thought — the main strongholds of organization — 
and to cast aside the superfluous inutilities. 
The well-tested results of large units in practice. — 
The superior value of large topics is no longer a matter 
of conjecture or of untried theory. Many classes of 
boys and girls of intermediate and grammar grades
-P-A-G-E-233
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 225 
have been given a taste of these large teaching units. 
The highly valuable results are now matters of record. 
In these large study units we now possess well-tested 
standard values as illustrated by well-taught master- 
pieces in literature and by typical projects in geography, 
history, and science. In view of these results there is 
no longer any sufficient excuse for retaining a patched- 
up, miscellaneous, and wasteful course of study. For 
lack of organization out of strong thought elements 
such a course is extravagantly wasteful of time and 
effort. 
Tests and measurements a means of elimination. — 
One of the valuable results arising from the present 
system of tests and measurements is the plan to reduce 
the necessary formal studies to their lowest terms and 
to determine the most economic methods for mastering 
these essentials. This process is now well under way 
and has the effect of abolishing much waste and of 
confining the symbolic studies to their narrowest limits. 
This includes language in its various forms, much of 
elementary reading and arithmetic, spelling and writing, 
and the purely symbolic elements of all other studies. 
The importance of mastering these forms as useful 
and necessary instruments in education gives them a 
place among the indispensables. 
Important ideas build the framework of studies. — 
But a still greater economy and removal of waste can 
be provided for by a yet stronger emphasis of thought 
centers in the controlling content studies. Important 
ideas are the sole organizers of knowledge. Con- 
cretely illustrated and expanded into their full mean- 
ings, such ideas furnish the constituent units in the
-P-A-G-E-234
    226 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
larger organization of the curriculum — like the states 
in the formation of the Union. Big ideas supply the 
constructive framework of these studies without which 
they collapse into a shapeless mass. But why waste 
time in overemphasizing ideas as centers of thought in 
school studies? Our excuse for this renewed and re- 
peated emphasis upon ideas is the simple truth that 
important ideas have been pushed into the background 
by the hordes of merely factual materialistic substitutes. 
Ideas now fail to dominate even in prolific thought 
studies. The great rabble of facts and generalities has 
poured in and preémpted the fields of study. You will 
look in vain anywhere in our present course of study 
to find any great idea unfolding itself in its full strength. 
This fact enfeebles all studies. 
There is one possible exception — the masterpiece 
of literature, well selected and well taught as an or- 
ganized, artistic whole. But too often even this is 
dealt with from the standpoint of the merely factual, 
degraded to the level of the commonplace. Instead 
of such intelligent groupings of liberal knowledge in- 
formed with the best ideals, our course displays a mul- 
titude of dry facts and summaries strung out in endless 
tiresome succession. This is little better than trash. 
It should be cleared out and thrown away, and a few 
vital constructive ideas substituted. This substitution 
of organized thought centers in place of the present 
conglomerate heap of facts and generalities would be 
the essence of economy and of good sense in education. 
The trivial and the important. — Our present course 
of study is guilty of an extravagant waste by dealing 
with many trivial matters as if they were important
-P-A-G-E-235
  
ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 227 
and by dealing with really important matters in a 
trivial way. In the well-known Scriptural phrase, we 
tithe mint and anise and cummin, but we omit the 
weightier matters of the law. It is time now to stop 
waste, to return to the weightier matters, and to found 
a course of study upon the central constructive ideas. 
We need what might be called powerful consolidation 
centers in studies — except that, as they are growing 
and developing centers of organization, they are not 
static. The outstanding superiority of these big units 
as commanding thought centers is so imposing that the 
jostling crowd of petty topics and small truisms in the 
course can not fail to show their littleness, their in- 
significance. Every time we give a large teaching unit 
full swing to develop its entire strength as a knowledge 
builder, the host of dwarfed topics in our present course 
shrivel up. Whatever is insignificant or stands alone, 
unrelated to the centers of thought, fades out of sight. 
This plan gives us an easy elimination of objectionable 
features. Here is a natural principle of exclusion based 
on demonstrated standard values. 
The growing strength and cumulative value of 
typical units. — In addition to what has thus far been 
said about central teaching units, they have what we 
may now call a cumulative value. Great as may be 
their primary value in their first full expansion as large 
object lessons, they are destined to still larger unfolding 
in future studies. They are deep-seated and long- 
lived creations of the mind and, as they grow toward 
maturity, their vital energy increases. A strong topic 
on sanitation in fifth and sixth grades will grow into 
larger, stronger kindred topics in seventh and eighth
-P-A-G-E-236
    228 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
grades, and a closely related idea will reappear greatly 
reénforced in high-school and college courses. The big 
units of study or thought centers in the elementary 
school strike deep into fundamentals, and their organ- 
izing strength and interpreting value will increase as 
the course of study evolves in its natural order. Such 
teaching units on their first appearance grow into 
strong, full centers of organization, and these develop 
through kindred types in later years into powerful, 
continuous strands of well-knit, firmly organized knowl- 
edge. This is the result we are aiming at in the re- 
construction of the course—a steady, cumulative, 
strengthening organization of knowledge. 
Objection to large units on the score of economy. — 
We have just been discussing the need of economy in 
the studies, and now we are met by a sharp objection 
to large teaching units on this very ground — that 
they are uneconomical, that they consume so much 
time. This is a natural retort from those who object 
to big topics. In fact large units of study require more 
time than anything of which we know. The elaborate, 
intensive treatment of a great project, like the rebuild- 
ing of Paris and of modern cities, requires a large, a very 
liberal consumption of time — out of all proportion to 
our present distribution of time in school subjects. At 
the first glance this unusual expenditure of time and 
effort on one topic appears to be the very contradiction 
of economy. But this seeming extravagance in the 
expanded treatment of important topics is what we 
wish to emphasize as the best form of economy. On 
the other hand the equal distribution of time in small 
allotments over a multitude of major and minor topics
-P-A-G-E-237
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 229 
is an utter waste and extravagant squandering of time 
of the very worst sort. The notion that an almost 
limitless number of topics in history or geography are 
of equal importance and require each the same amount 
of time is a piece of sublime foolishness. It leads to a 
pitiful tragedy in school studies. The characteristic 
thing about knowledge is the supreme, the transcendent 
value of a few fundamental ideas, the far-reaching 
import of a few centers of thought. When we en- 
counter one of these powerful thought centers suitable 
to the capacity of children, we should spend upon it all 
the time and collect all the knowledge resources that 
are necessary to secure a full understanding and a 
complete mastery of it. 
Parable of the miner. — A miner who strikes a rich 
vein of gold can afford to dig deep, employ help and 
machinery, and put large expense and labor into the 
full exploitation of his claim. A thin weak vein of gold 
is not worth working at all. Likewise in school topics 
we can not afford to spend even a small amount of time 
on shallow, trivial topics. There is only one thing to 
do with this whole vast collection of small or trivial 
topics in our present course, and that is to drop them 
out of notice as quickly as possible. On the other hand, 
we can not afford to treat important topics in a scant 
or trivial way. Put into the course of study only those 
topics which have high potential value, and give to 
each such unit its full, unstinted allotment of time and 
illustrative content according to its worth. This 
would give us a stimulating and highly productive 
course of study. An acre of land, enriched and inten- 
sively cultivated, is sometimes more profitable than a
-P-A-G-E-238
230 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
hundred acres treated in a careless and wasteful fashion. 
A run-down cotton plantation in North Carolina which 
had not been paying expenses because of wasteful 
exhaustion of the soil by long cropping and careless 
treatment was taken in hand by a thrifty, scientific 
farmer. By deep plowing, fertilizing, and intensive 
culture, by drainage and crop rotation, by careful har- 
vesting and marketing of his products, and by use of live 
stock, in the course of four or five years he restored this 
farm to fertility and made it a profitable investment. 
The studies of children on important topics should be 
full and intensive rather than shallow and extensive. 
In reply to the criticism that the full treatment of 
large teaching units is a waste of time, we may say that 
the large amount of time spent on such a unit is the 
proper and only measure of its value, the complete 
demonstration of its solid importance. To give each 
subject its full due would be a safe rule to follow in all 
studies. Indeed the full treatment of a large topic is a 
first-class achievement in study; it is a very landmark 
of real progress and is the only way to establish both 
teacher and children in a sound method of study. 
Rich scholarship in elementary schools. — This 
expansive handling of large teaching units is no trifling 
matter. It looms more and more into importance as 
we try to deal with it. One reason why it requires so 
much time is that it demands deep, sound, practical 
scholarship — indeed a very respectable kind of scholar- 
ship — such as we have not taken much pains to culti- 
vate in the elementary schools. Unhappily there is 
to-day in general a depreciatory attitude toward the 
scholarship of the elementary school. It is treated
-P-A-G-E-239
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 231 
slightingly even by the normal schools. The actual 
course of study with its wholly inadequate treatment 
of important subjects has brought the whole school 
into contempt. But there is no ground whatever for 
the opinion that the elementary course of study should 
be lacking in strong, rich, scholarly fullness and organi- 
zation. This enrichment with scholarly intensive 
knowledge is precisely what our elementary school most 
needs, in fact, is the very thing for which it is famishing. 
Famishing is a strong word, but strong words are some- 
times needed, as in this case. Jesus said, “If a child 
ask bread, will ye give him a stone?” We have been 
giving the children some stony diet in the course of 
study. Our textbooks are proverbially dull. It would 
take a genius to make them any duller. Many of them 
are shamefully trite and insipid and commonplace. 
This is not necessary. It is a totally false conception 
of what children are qualified to do and to enjoy. To 
impose this dull and unimportant information upon 
children is a misappropriation of school funds and of 
school facilities and a crime against children. 
No short cut to the interpretation of ideas. — The 
elaborate treatment of an important type study is 
therefore a merciful economy, a relief and inspiration 
to children. In this case the old proverb holds that 
“the longest way round is the shortest way home.” 
There is no short cut to the unfolding of fundamental 
ideas. Any attempt to condense and abbreviate big 
study units is more than a foolish waste of time. Such 
ill-advised efforts to shorten the process of learning are 
positive blunders. There is imminent danger of short- 
circuiting the process of learning so as to get a hurtful
-P-A-G-E-240
  f 
232 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
result. Instead of sharpening the child’s mind we dull 
it. Our textbooks have tried this shortening process, 
and they are now loaded up with abrupt, scrappy, dull 
statements about important topics. The result is not 
an easy road to learning but a way made artificially 
long and tedious and trifling. Instead of a full treat- 
ment we give important subjects what Daniel Webster 
called “‘the cold respect of a passing glance.” This is 
not the happy way to instruct, but the sure way to 
mutilate and spoil and devitalize knowledge. 
To grow large trees on a forest tract we must not 
crowd them closely together. Each tree, to expand to © 
its full size, must have adequate room to spread on all 
sides. In like manner the magisterial units of study 
require plenty of time and space in which to develop. 
There is no short method, no haste, for haste makes 
waste. In its process of organization the major unit 
draws to its support and incorporates into its own or- 
ganic growth the whole range of pertinent knowledge. 
No effort is thrown away on unrelated facts. More 
and more a center is created for complete correlation 
with other studies and with experience. The founda- 
tions of knowledge are laid deep and strong in this 
energetic, determinate growth of thought. 
The equipoise between facts and ideas. — A very 
common difficulty in everyday instruction is found in 
the skillful choosing and grouping of illustrative ex- 
amples upon abstract principles. Some teachers im- 
pose abstract rules and principles without adequate 
illustrations; others teach numerous facts without bear- 
ing on fundamental principles. A constant and intru- 
sive problem in teaching and one ever-recurrent in all
-P-A-G-E-241
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 233 
studies is the sharp demand for apt demonstrations of 
essential truths. In this matter there are two com- 
mon ways of attempting the impossible — one is to 
teach rules and principles without illustrations; the 
other is to assume the meanings of facts without noting 
their bearings on fundamental principles. In the in- 
troduction to new and difficult topics the really serious 
problem is how to get the right combination between 
illustrative facts and general principles. The fully 
elaborated project is a determined effort to solve this 
problem, to set up an unimpeachable demonstration 
of this process that bridges the connection between fact 
and idea. If we could strike the golden mean so as to 
get just the right combination between illustrative 
facts and general principles, we should solve the most 
serious problem that troubles all teachers. This is the 
true economy of the teaching process. 
The successful project maintains an equipoise be- 
tween the organizing concept and the factual material 
required to give this concept its life setting. This 
balanced relation between the grosser facts of experi- 
ence and the clarifying, refining thought is always 
difficult to guarantee. Enormous waste attends the 
clumsy gathering of facts without accent upon inform- 
ing ideas, and there is an equal waste in fumbling at 
fugitive concepts without sure backing in appropriate 
facts. The two standard blunders in teaching are, first, 
this overemphasis of unrelated individual facts and, 
second, the insistent offer of bald abstractions or dictated 
conclusions with scant or inadequate illustrations. 
Coéperation and intimate association between facts 
and ideas. — The completely expanded type study or
-P-A-G-E-242
  234 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
project is an effort to bring about a complete codper- 
ation between these two contrasted but complementary 
elements of knowledge, to bring the explanatory facts 
together into such a grouping that the idea springs out 
of them as the plant from the soil. To isolate facts 
from ideas and to treat each of them separately is fatal 
to both and is fearfully wasteful. 
Architect and workman. — In constructing a house 
the architect furnishes the plans and specifications; the 
contractor and the craftsmen, versed in tools and 
materials, apply the technique of construction to the 
building processes and plans. But after all the archi- 
tect must rely on intelligent workmen who can read 
and interpret the blue prints as a basis for exercising 
their technique, in short, can carry the ideas into the 
materials. 
Large teaching units the basis for the union between 
facts and ideas. — We have been dealing here with a 
difficult problem which those are compelled to face who 
are selecting and grouping knowledge materials into 
such teaching units as are most suitable for instruction. 
Our textbooks and teaching plans have been at fault 
in not setting up as a basis for study much larger 
teaching units or wholes. Organized standard units of 
instruction as substitutes for the multitude of short and 
scrappy topics are the need of the hour. The course 
of study has reached a stage where teachers must ex- 
pand their conceptions of the major teaching unit and 
give it much larger dimensions. The numerous small 
topics have had their day, but they belong to the past. 
They have been weighed in the balance and found want- 
ing. They are now giving way to a stalwart breed of
-P-A-G-E-243
  
ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 235 
major topics, each one of which is in itself a powerful 
center of organization, e.g. a project, such as reforesting 
the pine lands. One of these standard major units 
grows into a body of well-arranged knowledge in which 
some one idea in process of development is the principle 
of organization. Teachers must learn to grapple with 
these expanding projects which are thought enterprises 
of large import. A great unit of study is the proper 
housing of a single significant idea, e.g. the Pennsyl- 
vania Railroad Station in New York City. Such an 
important idea, if put to work properly, will build its 
own house; it will bring together and organize into a 
well-constructed whole the body of factual material 
required for its complete exposition. This is what is 
meant by the proper equipoise between facts and ideas; 
namely, the constructive idea at work building up a 
composite unit of knowledge out of the factual materials 
suited to its purpose. Project ideas demand a full scope 
and plenty of material or they can not do their work. 
Niagara Falls is such a combination. — The hydro- 
electric power plant at Niagara Falls is the product of 
such a creative idea, and worked out as a project it 
forms a first-class teaching unit or type study. To 
bring into a well-ordered treatment all the facts re- 
quired to give it its full meaning as a representative 
of such water powers in the world demands a full 
scientific knowledge and a higher order of organizing 
ability. Just as the power plant itself is the concrete 
embodiment of the idea, so the completely organized 
unit of study is the adequate expression of this idea in 
its growing life process. In teaching this subject the 
main difficulty lies in getting the right combination
-P-A-G-E-244
  236 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
between the knowledge facts involved in this study 
and the developing, organizing idea which must be 
brought out by the grouping of these facts. A project, 
like the Niagara power plant, described in its original 
construction and later operation is a genuine combi- 
nation of these elements because it is a reproduction of a 
life situation. It follows the actual process in which 
the idea was evolved by the engineers on the basis of 
the given facts. Our course of study should be made 
up in large part of such fully expanded practical units 
of organized knowledge, such well-balanced combi- 
nations of the factual and the ideal. 
Examples of quick interpretation. — The quick and 
correct interpretation of new problems arising in fresh 
subjects is a sure test of the economical use of knowledge 
previously gained. A trained physician can examine 
a sick man and in a few moments of observation and 
testing, as a usual thing, can promptly and correctly 
diagnose his case. The doctor’s previous experience 
and knowledge are at ready command and unless the 
case is overcomplicated he can give a quick judgment 
and at once prescribe the proper treatment. The 
expert physician, who is correct in the prompt diagnosis 
of cases and judicious in method of treatment, is a first- 
class illustration of a well-educated person so far as his 
special calling is concerned. His knowledge and ex- 
perience function promptly and accurately. This is 
true economy. 
An expert machinist can inspect a new machine, and 
in a few minutes explain its construction and interpret 
its value, and, if any thing is wrong with its action, he 
can quickly detect and correct the fault. His knowl- 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 237 
edge and experience are ready for use. This power to 
turn knowledge into instant use and to apply it skill- 
fully to new situations is the final stage of a complete 
educational process. 
The mastery of a few fundamental ideas to be used 
as quick interpreters.— It would be a new-found 
economy in study if children early in the course could 
really master a few fundamental ideas in each study. 
These would act swiftly as interpreters of hundreds of 
new but kindred topics in later studies. The number 
of such fundamental ideas is small and as types they 
have a far-reaching interpretative value, far greater in 
breadth and intensity than we have usually supposed. 
The enlarged type study is designed to set forth one of 
these fundamental ideas — to give it a full illumination, 
to let the idea grow and expand till it becomes in the 
child a clear tendency and correct habit of thought. 
In the second stage of expansion the type is variously ~ 
applied till the thought becomes more flexible in adjust- 
ing itself to new situations. This original elaborate 
treatment of the fundamental idea gives it a permanent 
ascendency in the mind. Every time a complete type 
study has been intensively worked out and applied 
the child has been equipped with a new instrument of 
interpretation which will operate efficiently over a large 
area of knowledge. One case fully mastered interprets 
the many. y 
Time well spent in elaborating big topics. — The 
unusual amount of time spent on one type study is thus 
more than compensated in two ways: First, in itself 
alone the type study is a profitable, stimulating, and 
comprehensive organization of knowledge. Second, it
-P-A-G-E-246
a ee Re ee ae ee Eee Tae 
238 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
is the key which is destined to unlock a large treasury 
of knowledge which lies waiting along the highway of 
studies. This powerful combination between fruitful 
fields of study now opening up and the still richer fields 
that lie ahead in succeeding studies gives a steady or- 
ganization of knowledge all along the line. Such a plan 
must result in a vital, connected system of thought. 
In well-guided studies of this sort there is no waste. 
Waste comes from haggling over a multitude of little 
things. Waste arises from scurrying through a course 
of study, from scattering attention over a host of minor 
topics which give no deep, permanent impressions and 
leave no assets in the form of organized usable knowl- 
edge. The mastery of one type study, like Mount 
Shasta as a typical volcano, goes more than halfway 
toward the mastery of all voleani¢ mountains and lava- 
strewn areas the world over. By centering study upon 
the few fundamental ideas, we are getting a strong 
control over those powerful factors of interpretation 
which lie at the center of all studies. As strongholds 
of thought they form the bridgeheads for future aggres- 
sive movement and organization. 
The waste in half learning. — There is no economy 
in half learning things—in a slipshod, superficial 
study. Such instruction Yéaves weak and vanishing 
impresst#ns. We require knowledge that has a keener 
edge to it. We can little afford to whitewash the mind 
_ with superficial: or feigned information. It is soon 
- washed off and forgotten, and the labor has been wasted, 
to say nothing of the bad habits formed. 
In striking contrast to this cheap, shallow culture 
the searching type study goes deep after the taproot  
-P-A-G-E-247
Se ee ee ee eee ee 
ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED CQURSE 239 
of knowledge at the very start and continues to deepen 
and enrich the whole subject as it advances. It ex- 
hausts descriptive and picturesque language and con- 
structive imagery in the effort to expose the stronger 
elements of experience. It throws a searchlight far 
into the important aspects and relations of the subject. 
It drills into the hard spots and blasts out startling 
facts. It looks ahead for the wider relations and 
applications of the main principle. General Grant 
said that he could never forget the sharply experi- 
enced facts of his campaign in Tennessee and south- 
ward against Vicksburg because experience had burned 
them into his memory. 
The first Pacific railway. — In a strongly developed 
project, like the building of the first Pacific railway, 
the rugged and knotty problems of engineering through 
the mountains, the boring of treacherous tunnels, the 
construction of massive snowsheds, the bridging of deep 
chasms, the breaking through mountain snows forty 
feet deep, the blasting out of steep cliffs for a roadway 
—these stinging facts must be byrned into a child’s 
memory by a process that is closely akin to experience. 
Take time to dig deep. — While this genuine extract 
from life experience is driving its impressions deep into 
a child’s mind, we need not be afraid of squandering 
time. The time and effort spent in gettiff theses 
rooted experiences are precious and profitable to the 
utmost. In building a great power dam across the 
Mississippi River at Keokuk, it required much time and - 
titanic labor to sink the cofferdams, to dig out the softer 
stone and work down to the bedrock upon which the 
power dam itself was then founded. Much effort is 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 HOW ‘TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
consumed in figuring out and bringing to a full realiza- 
tion the foundation stage of any big project while the 
main idea is emerging slowly out of the depths of ex- 
perience. Let the mind work out its task and give it 
time to gather all the hard-earned materials it needs to 
bring to pass a final and complete achievement. 
The master key that unlocks many doors. — The 
results of such a rugged mental experience will not soon 
vanish. This earned knowledge has taken up its 
habitat in the child’s mind and is there for good. The 
interpretation of a host of kindred subjects in the future 
is a ready and swift and appropriate continuation. 
The child now possesses the master key to that whole 
line of projects. Wherever in future experience similar 
subjects are even touched, the mind is alert and quick 
to interpret. A person is swift to translate meaning 
into any field of knowledge where he has had a convinc- 
ing and soul-stirring experience. 
A rapid forward movement in later studies.— In 
the later years of the school course we have a right to 
expect a quick response and keen, wide-awake inter- 
pretation of the larger problems rising to view. The 
surest way to get this result is to provide for deep, 
strong, and impressive experiences in the simpler objec- 
tive phases of these samé subjects in earlier years. 
There should be nothing shallow and superficial in the 
treatment of topics in the intermediate grades. Care- 
lessness and superficial and slipshod studies here are 
positive disqualifications for later important subjects 
and for effective thinking in later years. The very 
best elaborate organization of big topics, combined 
with perfected skill in handling such units in the class-
-P-A-G-E-249
ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 241 
room, is the teacher’s only standard for intermediate 
grades. This is good gospel, but it means hard work 
along the road of preparation for teaching. 
A mistaken method. — Unfortunately our present 
course of study is largely based on the notion of supply- 
ing children in these early grades with vague, general 
concepts, which later-acquired knowledge and experi- 
ence may somehow mysteriously develop into clearness. 
The exact opposite to this is the plain truth. Far 
better would be a plan for clear, vivid, experimental 
studiés in all these early years, because such intensive 
experience accelerates progress in later studies. 
Why children fail in the use of knowledge. — There 
is no doubt that these dull studies and vague concepts™ 
imposed upon children in early years are responsible for 
their well-known weakness and inability to remember, 
to think, and to make use of what they have previously 
learned. It is, indeed, a common and almost universal 
complaint among teachers that older children can not 
use and apply what they are supposed to have learned. 
They never knew it! In these very things they never 
had a realistic and solid experience of knowledge. 
They have been befuddled instead of clearly instructed. 
Why should we blame children for our own faults? 
They do what we require of them. We need a course of 
study based not on an outgrown, worthless tradition 
but on a clear concept of the experimental basis of 
knowledge in every important topic. This good begin- 
ning should be continued through the succeeding years 
in a series of strongly experienced projects. 
A change in practice required. — The psychology 
of the concrete, intensively developing type study is 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
    242 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
the exact opposite of this dull, routine method. In 
short, the best theory and the daily practice in schools 
are in stout opposition. The present practice in inter- 
mediate grades begins with a dull plodding method, a 
collection of dictated generalities, and ends in a formal, 
verbal kind of knowledge that fades out of memory. 
In every important topic, on the contrary, knowledge 
should begin in deep, strong, sharp experience. We 
should require important intensive object lessons true 
to life. Our standard of achievement in knowledge 
should not be a certain quantity of dictated facts or a 
collection of smoothly phrased generalities, but hearty, 
convincing experiences, gained by sharp direct contact 
with important realities. 
The significance of fundamental types. — This in- 
grained perversity in our methods of imposing a false 
show of much knowledge upon children should give 
way to a solid mastery of a few basal subjects whose 
powerful influence can then be felt as a reénforcing 
energy through the whole course of study. A big 
topic, like flour milling at Minneapolis, in the fourth 
grade will clearly explain several important topics in 
later grades. The same fundamental ideas develop 
from the first progressively through all the grades and 
far beyond. When children reach the grammar grades, 
they are sure to have need for the very same types of 
thought which they have dealt with concretely in the 
earlier grades. The new and complex problems that 
children meet in the grammar grades bear a strong 
family resemblance to the topics dealt with in the lower 
grades and yet in a changed and enlarged environment. 
Because of this continual and well-planned recurrence
-P-A-G-E-251
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 243 
of kindred topics, we are disposed to give in early years 
a special emphasis to anticipatory types— such as 
river types, biographical types, physiographic types, 
city types, industrial types, literary types, etc. 
A failure to gauge the value of types. — Our present 
course of study shows little respect for types. The 
deeper inherent connections between earlier and later 
studies, welding them together into one continuous 
process of thought, is not set up as a basis for growth 
and organization of knowledge. Yet without this, 
what organization are we likely to find that is con- 
tinuously constructive through the school years? Does 
it make any difference whether the well-rounded sub- 
ject that a child masters to-day has a vital explanatory 
bearing on a whole series of kindred topics sure to come 
up to-morrow, a year hence, and so on in succession — 
all the members of which show the impress of one 
typical constructive idea? 
The original type study developed into a strong 
thought movement represents the continuous under- 
ground connection that binds a whole series of impor- 
tant teaching units into one chain. In its beginning it 
should stand out strong and clear and demonstrative, 
and with each successive enlargement it will gather and 
consolidate into a central core the intense meaning 
and whole scope of knowledge that its principle 
naturally embraces. 
The consolidation of knowledge. — The chief econ- 
omy possible in planning the curriculum lies in this 
consolidation of knowledge and of mental habit along 
a few avenues of organized active intelligence, where 
everything counts, where the facts are not accidental
-P-A-G-E-252
  244 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
or contingent but contributory and essential, where the 
acquirements of to-day play directly into future situ- 
ations with a strong accent and a keen interpretation. 
Our present course of study is open to radical reorgani- 
zation in this particular in the interest of economy and 
efficiency. 
A common plan of reviews. — Another efficient 
means of economizing in studies is a better provision 
for effective reviews. Such a review is based upon a 
comparison of later with earlier kindred topics and 
develops a regular constructive continuity of thought, 
stretching through the course. It is all the time estab- 
lishing thought connections of similarity and contrast 
between earlier and later studies. Each typical project 
becomes thus an important link in a chain of type 
studies welded together by one fundamental idea. 
Comparison is the means employed in building up the 
series and in establishing a strong continuity of thought 
through the whole chain of topics. The present com- 
mon plan of reviews, based on a long tradition, provides 
for a recurrent repetition of facts and statements in the 
same order as first delivered with little or no emphasis 
upon thought relations. It is characterized by frequent 
reiteration and drill and much consumption of time. 
It is enforced by rigid schoolmasters in this manual- 
of-arms method. The review itself is not a reflective 
process. The memory is particularly emphasized, and 
a stiff examination on definitely prescribed facts and 
statements is the final test of efficiency. Some teach- 
ers add greatly to the student’s burden by extending 
this austere process quantitatively over a large area of 
knowledge. This mode of procedure encourages rever-
-P-A-G-E-253
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 245 
ence for the textbook and for its infallible and fixed 
statement of truth, and many teachers believe that 
this plan results in an admirable kind of thorough- 
ness. It unquestionably produces showy results and 
a lot of hard work for the student, and this passes 
currently for good teaching. It is, however, a decep- 
tive form of thoroughness based too much upon verbal 
mastery. 
The Jesuit schools, in carrying out their ratio studio- 
rum, applied this review method with a machinelike 
accuracy and completeness which gave them a great 
repute in the then teaching world. It suited their 
medieval, scholastic aim and their rigid linguistic plan 
of studies. But it is a narrow, arbitrary scheme and 
fits clumsily, if at all, into the rational richness and 
variety of our modern thought studies. It breaks the 
spirit of independent thought and initiative. This 
method of periodical, systematic reviews for the sake 
of discipline and thoroughness has come down to us 
through a long, deep-rutted tradition. It is founded 
upon the conception of knowledge as a definite and 
fixed quantity of information which can be mastered 
through a memory process. The scribes and Pharisees 
in their day had a body of religious doctrine which had 
been mastered in this exact way and petrified into rigid 
forms and was incapable of adjustment or progress. 
Reviews based upon a growing process of thought. — 
As a substitute for this traditional review of stationary 
facts a plan of review is here proposed based upon a 
quite different conception of knowledge — as a growing 
and expanding process of thought. Dynamic construc- 
tive ideas, naturally expanding in scope, are the active 
®
-P-A-G-E-254
  246 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
agents in organizing knowledge, and this involves the 
constant reorganization of old knowledge as it is brought 
into combination with the new. Reviews should ex- 
press the growth of old ideas as they expand into new 
and larger relations. This may sound bold and start- 
ling at first, but it is strictly true. This is exactly 
expressed in the Sermon on the Mount when Jesus, in 
presenting his new idea of the kingdom of Heaven, 
said, “I came not to destroy the Law and the Prophets 
but to fulfil,” and he certainly gave those ancient ideas 
a new and unheard-of fulfilment and enlargement. 
Naming the Mosaic ideas in succession he showed how 
each should be expanded into this new and larger, more 
humane conception of life. Just as soon as we accept 
the proposition that our whole course of study rests 
upon a few basal ideas that develop continuously and 
strongly through the years of school life and far beyond, 
we shall see clearly that this constant and close inter- 
action and integration between old and new knowledge, 
by which these leading ideas have a chance to grow, is 
the very essence of progress in studies. The great 
difficulty with static reviews, oft repeated, is that they 
mark the stoppage of thought and interfere with this 
natural process. If the static review becomes dominant 
in instruction, it throttles education in its cradle. 
The curriculum makers. — These basal ideas emerge 
into prominence from time to time throughout the 
course in the form of projects or large teaching units. 
They become the nuclei or centers of organization in 
the whole forward movement. Such powerful units of 
thought or of knowledge are not themselves static; 
they are discoveries; they express the big jumps or for- 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
  
ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 247 
ward impulses in thought. They are the main stages of 
the advance march into knowledge. Every fundamental 
idea expands through the course of study in a succession 
of impulsive movements through these large kindred 
stages in a developing order. Unless such a chain is 
forged out of important units that are firmly linked 
together by one strong bond of thought, knowledge 
falls to pieces like a rope of sand. The cumulative 
results of such a closely woven series of large units is 
the very economy of time and effort in mastering an 
extensive field of knowledge. The right kind of com- 
parative review is the instrument which brings the 
series of large topics into a connected chain of thought 
and throws into prominence the simple idea that gov- 
erns the whole. Several complete illustrations of this 
strong serial combination of kindred topics are given 
in the previous and in succeeding chapters; for example, 
the series of canal topics, the series of self-government, 
the series of river studies. Hach main study or at 
least each group of closely related studies has a few 
of these chief arteries (or main channels) of thought. 
Such fundamental thought movements, because they 
are perpetually at work organizing the materials of 
knowledge into powerful strands continuous through- 
out the course, may well be called the curriculum 
makers. 
The backward- and forward-looking constructive 
review. — The constructive review is a powerful factor 
in fitting together the successive parts of this develop- 
ing organic course of study. It may be called a scheme 
of reviews based upon a deliberate and systematic use of 
comparisons. This means that in handling any new 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
248 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
subject the teacher makes a business of reaching 
back into previous kindred studies and linking all 
topics that show important relations with the new 
subject. 
The Nile as a basis of comparison in review. — The 
Nile River coming somewhat late in the course should 
be specifically compared with the Mississippi and the 
Rhine as to deltas, with the St. Lawrence as to the 
Great Lakes system, with the Colorado, the Ganges, 
and the Euphrates with respect to irrigation, with the 
valleys of Mesopotamia, Yangtze, and Rhine as to 
historical significance. It should be contrasted with 
other great equatorial rivers as the Congo and the 
Amazon. Such comparisons should be specific and 
detailed, based upon fuller knowledge of both subjects 
“compared, and should result in new conceptions and 
bold conclusions. In our early studies of geography 
we should have had a full study of the Hudson, the 
St. Lawrence, and the Mississippi. A full treatment 
later on of the Rhine in Europe will give opportunity 
to measure the Rhine by these well-developed stand- 
ards. The water power of the Rhine at Schaffhausen 
in Switzerland is compared with the power used by the 
big flour mills of Minneapolis. The scenery of the 
Middle Rhine gorge is compared with the highlands 
of the Hudson. The highlands are more striking as 
picturesque mountains, but the tops of the Rhine cliffs 
are decorated with ruined medieval castles. The 
Rhine springs from the high Central Alps and from 
glaciers, while the Hudson comes from the low forest- 
covered Adirondacks. New York on the Hudson is 
twice as large as all the numerous large cities on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 249 é 
Rhine put together. Why has the Rhine a delta and 
the Hudson none? How do the Rhine lakes of Switzer- 
land compare with the series of Great Lakes on the 
upper St. Lawrence? Are there any floods on the 
Rhine and the St. Lawrence? Why have we far greater 
floods on the Ohio and lower Mississippi? The Rhine 
is famous through two thousand years of history, and 
many old stories and legends are associated with its 
ancient castles. Has the Hudson anything to compare 
with this? How is the Hudson renowned in history 
and legend. Consider Irving’s stories, Washington 
and Arnold, Burgoyne’s invasion, Cooper’s novels, 
etc. Such comparisons convert every new topic for 
study into a detailed and effective review of numerous 
previous studies. Later and earlier subjects, no 
matter how far apart in time or space, are brought close 
together, definitely measured, and their relative values 
sifted out. 
Comparisons are based on topics that have been 
thoroughly studied. — Such elaborate comparisons are 
serious undertakings and are designed to fill up a large 
place in the whole plan of instruction. They pre- 
suppose the earlier intensive treatment of all leading 
topics as a basis for later comparisons. Shallow and 
superficial treatment of important topics offers no 
proper basis for later comparisons. Comparisons are a 
prominent part of a plan for a thorough and masterly 
study of a series of related projects. They require 
a deeper penetration into the essential thought problems 
in every subject studied. They furnish a thoughtful, 
reflective process for working over and assimilating 
knowledge. é  
-P-A-G-E-258
    250 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
Comparison is a method of research into large values, 
a mode of standardizing the materials of knowledge 
and of continually grouping them in their proper 
centers. Comparative judging is at the bottom of 
every simile and metaphor and analogy showing the 
constant dependence of the mind upon measurements 
as the means and method of thought. Every parable 
is a striking comparison. Hyperbole and keen forms 
of wit are comparisons. Emerson says, for instance, 
“The mountain and the squirrel had a quarrel.’”’ After 
@ comparison of merits the squirrel says, 
“Tf I can not carry forests on my back, 
Neither can you crack a nut.” 
Historic comparison. — In history, biographical com- 
parisons with regard to personal qualities and achieve- 
ments give an excellent exercise in discriminative 
judgment. Robert Bruce, as described in Scott’s 
Tales of a Grandfather, will stand comparison with 
David, the outlaw king, in Hebrew history, with Wil- 
liam Tell in Switzerland, with Robin Hood in England, 
and with Daniel Boone in Kentucky. These are 
kindred spirits and in far distant times and places show 
in striking variation the qualities of nobility and high 
purpose in action. Grouping these men together and 
comparing them with one another, each in his special 
environment and exploits, give a review more valuable 
than any other we can devise or suggest. 
The full, even elaborate, study of William Penn as a 
religious leader, later brought into definite comparison 
with John Winthrop, Roger Williams, and Lord Bal- 
timore, with an inquiry into the peculiar religious views 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 251 
of each and how their ideas worked out in the early 
settlements, will do much to clear up the life and pur- 
poses of the early founders of American states. 
In previous chapters we have given repeated examples 
of this plan of review by comparison, and it may be 
appropriate now to draw the conclusions that may be 
reasonably inferred from this systematic curriculum 
plan for close association of old and new studies every 
day and in every large teaching unit. 
The significance of comparison as an organizer and 
simplifier of knowledge. — It is a deliberate, continu- 
ous process of progressive organization remiss d with 
thoughtful reorganization stretching through the years. 
It may be called a natural process in the sense that, 
while it demands thoughtful effort, it meets a vigorous 
and hearty response from the children. The fact is 
deserving of special emphasis that the similarity dis- 
covered in kindred topics develops a deep and powerful 
trend of interested thought in a long sequence of impor- 
tant teaching units. It rewards well the keener con- 
tinued attention brought to bear upon it, because in its 
process of organization it becomes a powerful simplifier 
of knowledge and results in what we may call the best 
economy of time and effort in studies. The review 
by comparison is the well-chosen means of increasing 
and cementing the natural and vital relationships that 
should exist between the different parts of knowledge 
— up and down the course and crosswise among studies 
—all converging toward simplicity and economy. 
Comparison develops into a superior kind of thinking, 
and it pays to put into it as much time and serious 
effort as are necessary to make it completely effective. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  252 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
It discovers new and unthought-of qualities in past ex- 
perience and at the same time clears up new problems. 
It is both regressive and progressive. Even originality 
of thought, a rare manifestation, has a chance to appear. 
The traditional course often repeats a whole year’s 
work. — The traditional memoriter review is a repeti- 
tion of the same outline of topics previously studied. 
In one state course of study the same outline of topics 
used in the fourth grade is repeated in the fifth grade. 
There is a strict identity or duplication of topics in the 
same order with slight variations in phraseology. There 
is a purpose, of course, to enlarge somewhat in the 
second year upon the treatment of the previous year, 
but the enlargement is not serious, as the treatment in 
both cases is very superficial. It is the same mechanical 
round of static reviews and dull repetitions, as if all the 
children in the class were retarded or delinquent and 
were required to repeat the year’s work. This is merely 
an illustration, but not extreme, of what is a commonly 
accepted plan in courses; namely, to repeat in a later 
year the same outline of topics assigned one or two or 
three years earlier, a very familiar practice in geography 
and history and language. 
It is a common and rightful complaint in many 
schools that the last year’s work of the grammar school 
is a stale rehash of topics that have been gone over time 
and again in the preceding grades. There is no real 
progress into new fields of knowledge. Then we hear 
gloomy complaints that children show no interest and 
no desire to go on to the high school. Such lifeless repe- 
titions and stolid reviews are not founded on any sound 
basis in human nature and should be regarded as a
-P-A-G-E-261
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 253 
part of the worn-out machinery of the schools to be 
sent to the scrap heap. 
A large teaching unit is never treated twice. — In 
this plan for a reorganization of the curriculum on the 
basis of large types, carefully selected and arranged, 
no large teaching unit is ever handled twice. But once 
indeed it is given a complete overhauling, an elaborate, 
and, if you please, masterly treatment. There is no 
good reason, for example, why the poem, Evangeline, 
should be treated as a complete piece of literature 
twice or three times at different points in grammar 
grades. We should use our best judgment in deter- 
mining in what year it can be most appropriately used, 
if at all, and then at that time expend all the effort and 
skill necessary to give it a complete artistic treatment 
so as to allow the children to appropriate it apprecia- 
tively in the very best way. At all events they should 
not be required to plod through this story two or three 
times superficially, on the ground that they are not 
expected to get much the first time and by repetition 
may add a little more the second or third time. What 
is true of literary masterpieces may be equally true of 
all first-class units of study in history, science, and 
geography. On the other hand frequent comparisons 
of Evangeline with other poems of kindred spirit and 
quality may be made throughout the succeeding course 
and are an essential part of the forward and backward 
movement in thinking. 
A large undertaking looking toward a great achieve- 
ment. — The elaborate presentation, discussion, and 
mastery of a first-class teaching unit at one time should 
be a memorable, outstanding event in the lives of
-P-A-G-E-262
    254 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
children, and the convincing impression of its value 
should abide as a standard of comparison and judgment 
for future years. It should make itself felt all along 
the line as a basis of future growth and organization. 
In short in every important study project we are de- 
manding a deeper insight and a far broader range of 
thinking back and forth along the main pathways of 
knowledge. Our thought should penetrate farther into 
each important topic and should connect each subject 
with all kindred subjects previously studied and later 
on correlate this topic with those which are to follow. 
It is time now to say good-by to the scrappy, barren, 
outline treatment of numerous topics, to rigid, thought- 
less reviews. We should take this matter of teaching 
seriously and allow children to deal with big subjects 
after a large fashion. This will set up a standard for 
teaching which will make it the greatest of arts. The 
building up of a practically organized body of knowledge, 
with the habits of thought and judgment necessarily in- 
volved, is an educational project well worthy of our most 
serious consideration. 
Every big topic opens up a new world. — Every 
big unit of study taken up in fourth or fifth grade, at 
its first appearance, gives ample entrance to a wide-open 
field of profitable knowledge, a sort of paradise for the 
young thinker and explorer. It is no rehash of old 
materials. Yet it seeks a revival and reacquaintance 
with all kindred knowledge that has preceded it. Every 
big topic should be the discovery of a new world, and 
in this enterprise every child should be a young Colum- 
bus looking out with genuine and open-eyed wonder 
as this new world begins to disclose its treasures. Nor
-P-A-G-E-263
ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 255 
should the child suffer any disappointment or dis- 
illusionment as he goes deeper into his subject. He is 
like Boone descending for the first time into that 
valley of Kentucky where he found a genuine hunting 
ground that matched up to his vivid anticipation and 
satisfied him to the full. Every year’s study in history 
or science or geography takes up a fresh new series of 
topics. While intimately related to previous experi- 
ences, they are advanced posts in the onward march 
and possess a full measure of adventure, of freshness 
and novelty. The world of experience is more than 
rich enough in promising and gratifying subjects of 
study so that we need not fall back upon dull and 
spiritless repetitions of worn-out topics. 
An unlimited supply of rich and resourceful topics. 
— Truly there is an abounding supply of resourceful 
projects, rich as the best mines of gold and exactly 
suitable for children. This demand for new and ex- 
panding and liberalizing topics every term is legitimate, 
and, so long as these superior resources for mental en- 
richment are available, the failure to supply them is 
little short of a crime. 
As children move forward on the stepping-stones of 
these large learning units, the scope of knowledge 
widens and the roots go deeper so that later studies 
become more productive and profitable. Fresh fields 
are constantly opening up, and the older fields are 
yielding a stronger harvest. The retrospect and use of 
knowledge already acquired are as valuable in organiz- 
ing the whole range of experiences as the forward move- 
ment, and the two should be kept in balance in every 
big unit. 
   
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
Simplification. — This review by comparison by 
which kindred topics, new and old, are brought together 
and wrought into one firmly woven fabric of knowledge 
involves no duplication. On the contrary it cultivates 
and enforces the strictest economy in the utilization 
of our mental resources. By steady progressive or- 
ganization along the few chosen highways of thought 
and by a full allotment of time to comparison and 
reflective association, the simpler framework of world 
knowledge comes gradually into view, and the great 
things are seen to be the simple things. The quiet 
predominance of a few simple ground ideas, extending 
and enforcing their influence through the whole process 
of education, will liberate the child’s powers and 
organize his whole world. 
The close partnership of form and content studies. 
— In learning to read it is necessary for children to 
master the symbols and word forms and sentence 
structure of written and printed language. At the 
same time, by means of the oral narration of stories 
and by activities in and out of school, they are gaining 
a wide variety of experiences both of human affairs and 
of nature lore. Teachers have been much exercised in 
recent years in efforts to bring this first group of formal 
studies into full codperation with the second group of 
experience and content studies. This problem of 
harmonizing form and content is present in all studies 
throughout the curriculum but is boldly prominent in 
primary grades. The important thought studies have 
been steadily pushing to the front and have now as- 
sumed the definite leadership in shaping the curriculum. 
The expansive enrichment of elementary studies
-P-A-G-E-265
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 257 
through literature, the fine arts, biography, geography, 
science, and the arts of life is a surprising achievement 
of recent years. The older curriculum gave predomi- 
nance to the formal arts of expression, but the tables 
have been turned and now the more energetic, enriching 
content studies have come into their proper leadership. 
The deeper thought studies just mentioned furnish 
the main ideas as central strands of organization which 
we have been discussing. They supply the ground 
plan and framework of studies by furnishing the basal 
constructive ideas that steadily organize knowledge. 
As a result of this changed relation of relative impor- 
tance, the form studies have been shrinking to smaller 
dimensions, and the system of tests and measurements 
is bringing them properly into still closer quarters, 
limiting them to the manifest essentials. But the 
problem of combining thought with form remajns an 
ever-present and difficult task. 
Intense activity in thought studies contributes to 
the mastery of forms. — Economy of time and effort 
in both teaching and learning rests upon a close co- 
partnership between thought and form, constantly 
acting and reacting upon each other. There are several 
ways in which the topics rich in thought contribute to 
a quicker mastery and better use of essential forms in 
reading, spelling, and language. Teachers have worked 
this problem out in several ways: First, the strong 
thought studies put the mind into such an intense 
activity that there is needed mental strength to do two 
things at once, to master both thought and form. The 
heat of strong thinking welds thought and language 
together far better than concentration of attention upon
-P-A-G-E-266
    258 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
mere forms of expression. In listening to an interesting 
story of Robinson Crusoe or of Robin Hood, children 
will unconsciously absorb words and phrases and whole 
sentences, and in reproducing it will express themselves 
far better than when laboring at some forced and 
formal language exercise. This fine experience in com- 
bining thought and language repeats itself in the whole 
range of engrossing topics which we have been discuss- 
ing under the name of central units. This striking 
fact of the absorption of thought and language together 
is not stated here as anything new but fortunately as a 
happy commonplace in teaching experience wherever 
strong, rich thought subjects suitable for children are 
properly dealt with. Since this problem of combining 
thought and form is present in all studies and in almost 
every lesson, the economies that can be practiced (the 
saving of waste) by a wise use of stimulating thought 
studies are almost without limit. 
The energy supplied by distant aims. —The enriching 
content studies, in the second place, fill the child with 
generous impulses and forward-pushing ambitions to- 
ward the widening of experience and knowledge. They 
shape up the higher standards of achievement and 
brighten up those more-distant goals which help to keep 
up one’s courage and steadfastness in the midst of strain 
and effort. Nothing is more important or economical 
than setting up these distant aims and supplying the 
energy required for achieving them against opposition 
and difficulty. Among these difficulties is the labor of 
mastering the formal or instrumental arts. When the 
student has gotten into vigorous action along the higher 
lines of thought and discovers that he needs the equip-
-P-A-G-E-267
  ECONOMIES OF AN ORGANIZED COURSE 259 
ment of the instrumental arts of expression, he is more 
willing to devote effort to their mastery. For the 
development of the thought studies themselves is 
narrowly conditioned by the necessity of formal and 
accurate expression. 
Summary 
The present course of study is made up of an immense collection 
of poorly organized materials. Economy in the selection and 
arrangement of these materials is the crying need. 
The gradual unfolding of a few fundamental thoughts embodied 
in large units of instruction would clarify the whole vast field of 
knowledge. In contrast to this, immense waste results from half- 
way learning a multitude of disconnected facts. 
Ideas growing and expanding naturally into big units of study 
are the sole organizers, and the more comprehensive the scope of 
such ideas the fewer are the centers of organization. Economy in 
knowledge-getting demands this concentration at a few points and 
along a few lines. 
The only way to abbreviate the course of study is to expand 
its big topics; in other words, to give full scope to a few organizing 
principles. 
The elementary course of study has a limited store of inexhaust- 
ible gold mines where the treasures of the earth have been col- 
lected. These are the places to dig. But children should not 
wander at random prospecting over all the desert and waste places. 
The multiplication of small topics and the endless stringing together 
of commonplace facts amount to extravagant folly. 
Curriculum makers must do some broad-minded, comprehensive 
thi casting aside for the time being a great mass of trivial 
and minor details. 
When the centers of organization have been once determined 
upon, they must be copiously enlarged. They should be allowed 
to monopolize the whole field of knowledge, pushing the minor 
topics into the background. 
The economy ofthis plan is shown in four leading points: 
1. The complete elaboration of a large teaching unit preserves 
the balance between facts and ideas — between the material and 
spiritual — between body and soul in matters educational. The  
-P-A-G-E-268
TM a etn Erne mer Ln ee men nee 
260 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
failure to maintain this wholesome balance disjoints and weakens 
the whole scheme of education. 
2. An important idea once mastered runs into a rapid inter- 
pretation of a whole series of later studies. We are in search of 
these master keys which will open many doorways into world 
knowledge. These master keys have been discovered in the 
fundamental types. 
8. A succession of type studies continuous in one line of thought 
provides a basis for constructive organizing reviews. Such review 
comparisons consolidate knowledge along the chief highways of 
thought, and they would save the children more than a year’s time. 
The present plan of oft-repeated static reviews of the same round 
of topics from grade to grade is a tedious and deplorable waste. 
4. The elaborate treatment of these masterly units of instruction 
produces naturally a binding correlation between the chief studies 
and abolishes the old artificial separation of studies. This plan 
gives a mutual interaction among all the studies and a constant 
review by each of materials in others. The formal and content 
studies are likewise so-closely correlated that each group reénforces 
the other. 
The fundamental ideas in big topics are the curriculum builders 
on a simple, economical, comprehensive plan.   QUESTIONS FOR STUDY

  CHAPTER VIII 
THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 
OF SUCH ORGANIZATION 
The energy released and set to work by projects. — 
A boy digging for fish bait or his father preparing fish 
nets for a catch has an adequate motive for effort. In 
planning and laying the first Atlantic cable, Cyrus W. 
Field encountered difficulties and failures but pushed 
resolutely on with unabated purpose, confident in the 
value of his project. The project that looks forward 
to a definite and well-conceived result has an unrivaled 
capacity for drawing to itself and for organizing the 
particular materials and resources which contribute to 
this end. A project wisely conceived by some daring 
soul like Columbus holds within itself a rational energy 
that not only brings to its support just the required 
instrumentalities but also supplies the momentum that 
breaks through opposition. There is a sort of titanic 
energy involved in the execution of large social and 
industrial projects that brooks no interference and 
pushes on to full achievement. The building of the 
first Pacific railway was a notable illustration of speed 
and energy in successful construction. Projects like 
the Cologne Cathedral sometimes display a persistent 
and long-lived energy. It was six hundred years in 
building. A university grows and organizes its re- 
sources with ever-widening influence through years and 
262
-P-A-G-E-271
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 263 
centuries. David Livingstone spent a lifetime in 
getting well started in his project of opening up central 
Africa. Decades and perhaps centuries will be required 
to develop and reap the fruits of his initial efforts. 
Hannibal’s historic march from Spain across the Alps 
to attack Rome was backed by a determined energy. 
Urged by a powerful impulse he displayed an unrivaled 
intelligence and persistence in enrolling and directing 
the men and resources necessary to the execution of his 
purpose. In professional and business enterprises 
which constitute a very large proportion of the world’s 
progressive, essential work, this prodigious long-lived 
energy in the pursuit of definite plans is the basis of 
achievement. Banking houses, like the Rothchilds, 
and commercial enterprises, such as railroads, grow and 
expand far beyond the lifetimes of their founders. 
The initial energy manifested in a social project like 
that of the Red Cross Society constantly renews itself 
and enlarges its scope into a continuous and unending 
series of benefactions. Large benevolences and social 
projects that answer well the needs of society grow into 
institutions and acquire an almost endless lease of life. 
In peaceful times society is thus capable of becoming 
a living, growing, improving organism. 
Energy in municipal projects.— The growth of a 
modern city is simply the expansion of a group of 
municipal projects, centering around and growing out 
of the needs of the developing community, such as 
rapid transit, water supply, parks, and fire protection. 
These projects perpetually expand with the city’s 
growth and necessities. A powerful codperative social 
spirit is required in such projects, constantly alert and  
-P-A-G-E-272
    264 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
active, to ensure to any growing city the wholesome 
development of its community life. The real worth 
and character of a community are best expressed in the 
kind of projects wisely undertaken and carried through 
to final achievement. This persistent, invulnerable en- 
ergy which is the life principle of personal and social 
projects is the reconstructive force which should be put 
to work in reshaping the curriculum. These typical 
life projects will now be examined with a view to dis- 
covering their sources of strength and predominance as 
organizers of knowledge for school purposes. 
The genetic impulse. — The forces that give birth 
to a project and launch it upon its career provide a 
strong motive for effort. Observe for example the origin 
of such a project as the Old National Road. It sprang 
out of a keenly felt need for easier and quicker com- 
munication between the Western settlers and their old 
friends across the mountains. Again, the Constitution 
of 1787 was framed by men who were under a powerful 
compulsion to find relief from a governmental chaos 
that was steadily growing worse. Still further back in 
our history, the voyage of the Pilgrims in the May- 
flower was undertaken by a zealous people escaping 
from unbearable conditions and hoping for a great 
relief. The Suez Canal and the Brooklyn Bridge were 
public projects imperatively called for by pressing 
needs. They were a direct outgrowth and expression 
of economic forces that had to be considered. In such 
enterprises whatever aid can be supplied by science or 
invention or previous historical experience is called 
into service and absorbed into the scheme. For ex- 
ample, in the preliminary surveys and plans for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 265 
Panama Canal and in the subsequent problems of con- 
struction, nearly all the modern scientific inventions 
and resources as well as civic and industrial organiza- 
tions on a large scale were drawn into direct and com- 
bined service. Such projects demand a fundamental 
knowledge of the scientific facts in their life connections 
and a close adjustment of reasoning processes to the 
practical needs. This renders the typical life project 
an almost perfect example of sound thinking under the 
stress of practical compulsion. The genetic and dy- 
namic force that runs the machinery of thinking is here 
at its maximum. What is called motivation in such 
cases is grounded not on artificial stimuli but upon the 
urgencies of life itself. All these are examples of the life 
energy at work in practical social projects. Why not 
take up these projects bodily into the school program 
and give them the right of way in organizing knowledge? 
Projects demand a severe form of reasoning. — 
This historic, natural evolution of the project lays 
down a more substantial basis for the right organization 
of knowledge than the school heretofore has furnished 
with its artificial groupings and its systematic outlines. 
A project like the laying of the first Atlantic cable is 
subjected to sharper and more decisive tests than those 
usually applied to reasoning in formal school subjects. 
A practical project, developing under the life strain, 
meets with more unexpected contingencies than the 
problems set by the schoolmaster. Real projects are 
more exacting and uncompromising in their demands 
for foresight and reflective thought. The successful 
execution of such plans requires a masterly control and 
organization of the whole range of essential facts. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  266 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
military project like Burgoyne’s invasion, which de- 
veloped under the pressure of complex, widely scat- 
tered, and unstable forces, calls into play a high degree 
of comprehensive and flexible thinking. The early 
successes of Burgoyne on Lake Champlain and quick- 
following reverses as he moved southward to the Hud- 
son demand a rapid shifting and readjustment of 
thought. The maneuvering and fighting qualities of 
the British generals, Burgoyne, Fraser, Baum, and 
Breyman, are estimated and compared with those of the 
American generals, Schuyler, Warner, Gates, Stark, 
Arnold, and Washington. The larger codperative 
action of the American leaders is contrasted with the 
failure of the British in combined effort. The far- 
reaching results of Burgoyne’s surrender, first, in its 
effects upon the American Congress and people, second, 
on the British Parliament and politics, and, third, on 
France and other European countries are clearly 
thought out. The consequent reorganization of the 
world forces combined against England gave a new 
aspect to the remainder of the Revolutionary War. 
A detailed, comprehensive, many-sided study of one 
such military campaign dealing adequately with the 
main forces that were operating and decisive in produc- 
ing results would exhibit the keen competitive ver- 
satility of thought required in such difficult. practical 
projects. Why not appropriate these projects and 
incorporate them into the curriculum? 
The strong historic sequence. — Of all studies his- 
tory furnishes the standard examples of the genetic or 
historic evolution of projects. It deals with the begin- 
nings and causal connection of events in the process of
-P-A-G-E-275
INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 267 
development — the emergence of these projects out 
of social causes and life forces. The history of a project 
like the annexation of Texas gives the whole series of 
stages through which this strong purpose was carried 
to success. The Erie Canal was such a motivated far- 
seeing scheme, planned and executed through a long 
series of steps in the face of stubborn political opposition 
and of constructional difficulties. Its later enlarge- 
ment by means of vast and expensive reconstructions 
is a continuation of this energetic historical sequence. 
The deeper-lying relations between events and the 
unbroken sequence of cause and effect through a long 
process demand close, reliable thinking. A complete 
and connected study of the Plymouth settlement re- 
veals this deeper logic of sound practical thought. 
The Pilgrims with gritty determination and a high 
faith were working out a long-developing project amid 
the rude, wild surroundings of the Plymouth settle- 
ment. A scant and superficial survey of the main facts 
is wholly inadequate. A full and sympathetic knowl- 
edge of the whole range of their hard-pressing experi- 
ences kept up through a period of years is the only 
basis of right judgment on the character and achieve- 
thent of the Pilgrims. Many instances can be given 
of this logic of events, this grinding out of results be- 
tween the upper and nether millstones of experience. 
The initial struggle for existence in the early history of 
Boonesboro, Kentucky, and again the building of the 
Chicago drainage canal are enterprises of the severe 
project type which, in a proper elaboration, enable 
us to sense the difficulties out of which such under- 
takings are born and fostered and developed,
-P-A-G-E-276
    268 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
The main institutions that we cherish in state and 
church and society had their beginnings in these out- 
cropping historic projects which grew up and estab- 
lished themselves under such laborious, strenuous con- 
ditions. To reconstruct these historic projects from 
their doubtful beginnings, hard limitations, and serious 
hindrances and to trace the slow emergence into suc- 
cess will furnish examples of organization based upon 
a progressive dynamic movement. 
The logic of close-fitting practical events. — The 
natural evolution of projects enforces this keener 
experimental penetration into the inexorable logic of 
practical events. It is frequently remarked that we 
get a real understanding of the present through our 
knowledge of the past. But this is true only in those 
historic achievements, in the intensive, connected 
study of which we have endured the pains and penalties 
imposed upon those who were hardy, struggling pioneers 
and who stubbornly worked out the problems. As 
learners we must partake measurably of the rough 
and raw experiences of those who were explorers and 
road builders, who opened the first wilderness paths 
as did La Salle, Boone, and Frémont. The logic of 
events based on the stringent law of cause and effect 
is a sharp corrective of faults and a severe punisher of 
mistakes in thinking. Our condensed bookish outlines 
of topics give no notion whatever of this life struggle 
against opposing odds, of this close-fitting sequence of 
facts in de> Ie economic or governmental projects. 
The early, crude beginnings of our United States Post 
Office and the long, slow series of improvements by 
which it has been developed to its present vast scope 
: 
|
-P-A-G-E-277
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 269 
and efficiency illustrate the close thinking required in 
mastering such a continuous historic evolution. An 
enterprise that develops through its natural and inevit- 
able stages in rigid conformity to wisely directed effort 
exercises a powerful pull upon the interest, attention, 
and thinking capacity of the student. He builds up a 
consistent and intelligent sequence and organization of 
knowledge. 
Fiske’s ‘Critical Period of American History.””—Some 
of the best historical writing, in books lying just outside 
of the prescribed course of study, deals with important 
historical projects in this fruitful thought-stimulating 
manner. Fiske’s ‘Critical Period of American His- 
tory,” which deals thus intensively with the disrupting 
influences at work in the colonies, which forced many 
leading men to the conviction that a stronger central 
government was necessary, is a connected setting forth 
of this weighty governmental project. When history 
is dealt with in this pragmatic fashion, grounded in a 
deep practical scholarship dealing with progressive 
events and expanding into powerful units of study, it 
sets up a high standard of constructive organization. 
The genesis of projects in geography and science. — 
This keener onset upon knowledge, based upon the 
strong genetic impulse, may be fully shared by both 
geography and science. Many of the most important 
projects in geography and science naturally take on 
this constructive historic treatment. The expensive 
river and harbor improvement of Glasgow not only 
explains the present commercial and industrial impor- 
tance of Glasgow but is also a striking chapter in the 
historical development of commerce. This improve-
-P-A-G-E-278
270 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
ment was begun in a very simple way more than a 
hundred years ago by dredging and deepening the 
shallow places in the Clyde River. In its progress it 
exhibits a definite historical series of aggressive im- 
provement projects in deep dredging and harbor exca- 
vation. It produced a steady increase at Glasgow in 
world commerce and developed a vast shipping interest. 
Another instance is the construction of levees along 
the banks of the Mississippi River to control the floods 
and protect the cities and rich lowlands of the flood 
plain. The present levee system is the result of a long 
series of river-improvement projects, historically de- 
veloped and looking well to the future for greater re- 
sults. This topic should be treated as a developing 
project, thus giving it the impulse and momentum of a 
great social and economic enterprise in which man has 
undertaken to get control for his own benefit of some 
of the larger forces in the field of river geography. Such 
a developing project is never a bald exhibit of mere 
results; in short, it is not static. It develops through a 
strong genetic sequence into a series of problems. In 
the teaching process every geographic project should 
begin with the inception and grow into a developing 
history of the project. Otherwise the natural, logical 
order of thinking and of solving problems is not only 
interfered with but nullified. The Salt River project 
for reclaiming 240,000 acres of arid land in Arizona is a 
complete demonstration of just such a practically 
organized life project. In such a case geographic 
knowledge organizes itself under the powerful impulse 
of a genuine civic and social purpose. It is a strong 
contribution of the project idea in teaching that it  
-P-A-G-E-279
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 271 
reveals this driving energy of the original historical 
movement in large teaching units. History thus takes 
on an important and intimate relation to several other 
studies since they also are absorbed into this historic, 
dynamic method of treatment. 
Scientific projects.— In applied science, for ex- 
ample, the problem of getting rid of typhoid fever in 
town or city is a scientific community project to be 
carried out in a series of steps lasting months and years. 
We have the histories of several successful projects of 
this sort. In handling one of these we may get the 
benefit of this strong community impulse for social 
betterment of health conditions in its historical growth. 
Modern society has been compelled to take up these 
municipal projects and scientific health problems, 
many of which have a state and national and even inter- 
national scope. Among these may be mentioned the 
need for securing a pure milk supply in cities, how to get 
a sanitary municipal market, the quarantine of seaport 
cities, the antituberculosis campaign, the protection 
of children and women in factories, sanitary housing 
in cities. All such projects under life pressure generate 
a fund of coéperative social energy, and, as fast as these 
projects are absorbed into the school course, the school 
studies are receiving the powerful reénforcement of 
this combining, energetic, and social spirit. In con- 
trast to this, one of the most serious faults of our old 
course of study is the static, unyielding inertia of its 
facts and knowledge materials, the almost total lack of 
incentive or of social impulse in the direction of whole- 
some, common enterprise. All real thinking must be 
forward-moving, propulsive, dynamic. These positive
-P-A-G-E-280
    272 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
dynamic elements are found in every project which is 
genetic or historic in its origin and growth. 
The biographic impulse. — A project like the Erie 
Canal in which De Witt Clinton took such a leading 
part has also the merit of a strong biographical interest. 
De Witt Clinton is fighting against strong odds in 
working out his purpose. It is an absorbing personal 
enterprise pushing toward achievement. The difficul- 
ties and problems are not only concrete; they also bring 
out the immediate expression of individual force and 
strength of character. This deep concern felt for the 
success of an individual behind the project lends a 
vigor of thought which no other agency can contribute. 
The energetic person who undertakes a large, new proj- 
ect which is still doubtful in its issue finds many people 
skeptical and others strongly opposed. He puts into 
the scheme all his energy and mental resource and grows 
into the dimensions of a hero, as did Magellan. The 
part of history which engrosses the attention and 
imagination of young people is that which describes 
the projects undertaken and executed by masterful 
individuals who show force and flexibility of character, 
as George Rogers Clark in his campaign for the capture 
of Kaskaskia and Vincennes. With insignificant re- 
sources but with an astonishing strength of resolution 
he gathered an army, took these forts, conquered the 
Northwest Territory, and held it against the British 
till the close of the war. ‘ 
Importance of biography. — In educational circles 
we have come to realize that biography at its best is 
the vital part of history, and more and more we are 
shaping our course of study in grammar schools and
-P-A-G-E-281
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 273 
even in high schools and colleges on this basis. Car- 
lyle in his “Heroes and Hero Worship” and Emerson 
in his “Representative Men’? have demonstrated the 
far-reaching significance of this personal element in 
history. Macaulay’s biographical essays and Plu- 
tarch’s ‘‘Lives” are in themselves classic demonstra- 
tions of this biographical interest. The biographies of 
Abraham, Moses, David, Elijah, John the Baptist, 
and St. Paul are conspicuous Bible examples. The 
heroes and makers of history are those marked char- 
acters who have undertaken and achieved important 
projects, such as Magellan, William Penn, David Liv- 
ingstone, Florence Nightingale, Cyrus W. Field, Hor- 
ace Mann, Sir Walter Scott, John Paul Jones, and 
Benjamin Franklin. 
The project itself introduces a compelling motive, an 
energetic, purposeful effort. Now, when the project is re- 
enforced by an engaging and striking personality, which 
throws itself vigorously into the scheme of action, as 
when Washington worked out his masterly project for 
concentrating land and sea forces around Cornwallis 
at Yorktown, we have an ideal problem for the child 
to deal with. In this combination of the project in- 
terest with biographical interest we touch the strongest 
center of influence in historical and other studies. 
Strength and scope of American biography. — What- 
ever potential value the biographical project may have 
as applied to history is of special and pronounced value 
in American history, because our people in the gross 
and individually for three hundred years have been 
engaged in setting up and working out important and 
engrossing projects. The subjugation of an untamed
-P-A-G-E-282
  274 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
continent has opened up enterprises of every descrip- 
tion. The pioneer explorers and settlers in carrying 
through their plans pitted strength and shrewdness 
against the obstacles and dangers of the wilderness. 
No other country in its early history had such an en- 
terprising group of bold, resourceful leaders. They 
were explorers, pathfinders, Indian fighters, and found- 
ers of settlements. Later they engaged in road build- 
ing; in the exploitation of forests and prairies; in mining 
coal, gold, and copper; in the construction of canals 
and tunnels and railways; in the bridging of rivers, the 
navigation of lakes and streams, the drainage of 
swamps, the planting and development of cities; and 
in the organization and development of business en- 
terprises. Our people in the short period of three 
hundred years have worked out more imposing projects, 
conspicuous enterprises on a large scale of operation, 
than any other nation in a thousand years. This holds 
not only in large industrial and material interests but 
also in constitutions and government, in humane social 
organizations, in the expansion of church activities, 
and in the remarkable growth of educational institu- 
tions. In all these great enterprises, from the days of 
frontier settlements to the present, strong leaders of 
distinctive personality stand in the front ranks as rep- 
resentatives of the people, for example, Roger Williams, 
Anne Hutchinson, Oglethorpe, Robertson, Peter Cart- 
wright, Andrew Jackson, John C. Frémont, Daniel 
Boone, George Rogers Clark, Captain Eads, Eli Whit- 
ney, Clara Barton, Frances Willard, Samuel F. B. 
Morse, and a host of others. 
Moreover, if children are to learn how to adjust
-P-A-G-E-283
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 275 
themselves to the modern world, these very projects 
offer the best channels of thought through which to 
enter into this domain and thus master the varied in- 
stitutions in our present social order. For they all be- 
gan in just such projects and developed out of them 
into the present order. 
Geographic projects are biographical. — Again the 
biographical impulse may contribute its strong reén- 
forcement to geographic and scientific studies quite as 
effectively as to history. Captain Eads’ project for 
cleaning out the mud-choked mouths of the Mississippi 
and thus opening it to world commerce is not only a 
story of strong personal interest in high achievement 
but at the same time an important type and center of 
organization in geography. His construction of the 
St. Louis bridge is of similar import. Cyrus W. Field’s 
persevering efforts in laying the first Atlantic cable is 
a combined biographic and geographic story. Powell’s 
adventurous journey with a small party of men down 
through the Grand Canyon of the Colorado is a thrilling 
geographical excursion. Peter Cooper’s supervision of 
the construction of the Croton aqueduct for New York 
City’s water supply is the same combination of biog- 
raphy with local geography and community welfare. 
One of the best geographic stories is the tale of Living- 
stone’s explorations in central Africa. A significant 
topic in geography and history is Peter the Great’s 
founding of the city of Petrograd, and equally valuable 
is Francis Joseph’s reconstruction of Vienna. To un- 
derstand a bold railroad enterprise, study the biography 
of a great railroad builder, like James J. Hill of Minne- 
sota. To understand gold mining follow the adven-

tures of a prospector and gold miner in Colorado. Mr. 
Dalrymple’s project in developing a large wheat farm 
in Dakota gives us lively and lasting imagery relative 
to the wheat industry in the Northwest. 
Science biographies. — In science likewise we have 
a group of almost thrilling biographies that introduce 
us in an admirable fashion to the discovery and use of 
nature’s secrets and laws, for example, Watt’s in- 
vention of the steam engine and Stephenson’s applica- 
tion of it in the locomotive and railroading, Franklin’s 
discoveries in electricity, and the marvelous work of his 
successors, Pasteur’s investigations in bacteriology and 
their application to wine making, to the prevention of 
diseases of the silkworm, and later to human and 
animal diseases. 
The story of how Gorgas cleared Havana of yellow 
fever and later got rid of yellow fever and malaria at 
Panama is a thrilling science tale. The personal stories 
of Kepler’s and Newton’s discoveries, the biographies 
of Darwin, Agassiz, and Hugh Miller, of Edison and 
Marconi, the life stories of Audubon and Thoreau — 
these and others illustrate the principle of biography 
superimposed on the idea of discovery and invention. 
No better gateway into the scientific field may be 
found than the interesting narrative of the scientist 
himself and how he pursued his projects of discovery. 
Biography reénforces social projects. — In the biog- 
raphy projects, therefore, may be found a rejuvenation 
of interest and devotion to history, geography, and 
science among young people, and these efforts prop- 
erly selected and treated become growing centers of 
organization and clear types of the leading principles
-P-A-G-E-285
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 277 
as applied to modern social and industrial life. An- 
other advantage of biography as a direct contribution 
to economic and social projects is the strong drift 
toward community betterment, toward social enter- 
prises of every kind, as shown in these biographical 
narratives. When Peter Cooper built the Cooper 
Union in New York City and carried out his life project 
of helping the working boys and girls of Lower New 
York, he was devoting his wealth and personal influence 
to a large scheme of social betterment. In this case 
the individual biography becomes the representative 
of a liberal social idea. Johns Hopkins, by founding 
the great hospital at Baltimore, was contributing his 
personal resources to a public need. George Peabody 
in bestowing his wealth upon the needy cause of public 
education in the South at the end of the Civil War 
was merging his personality in a broad social good. 
When Roosevelt was police commissioner of New York 
City, his forcible leadership was directed towards the 
improvement of political conditions. 
Projects are social. — All great projects are essen- 
tially social in their bearings and influence. In this 
sense every worthy biography is the personal embodi- 
ment of an important social idea. Morse in building 
the first telegraph line, Fulton in making a success of 
the first steamboat, Luther in his translation of the 
Bible, Howard in his plan of prison reform are exam- 
ples. Important biographies are representative or 
typical. The individual is merely an interesting agent 
or means of demonstrating the value of some social 
project that may then spread its useful influence 
broadly in society.
-P-A-G-E-286
278 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
This quality of biographical leadership finds striking 
illustrations in our modern commercial and educational 
life and among scientists we have a turn for the prac- 
tical, We need only to mention such men as Ezra 
Cornell who founded Cornell University, Vassar of 
Vassar College, Horace Greeley, Henry George, Robert 
Morris the financier of the Revolution, Eli Whitney, 
Samuel Slater, Bessemer, Abbe, and Edison. These 
men had their individual projects which involved, 
however, schemes of general social improvement. The 
aim of education most commonly accepted in recent 
years is that of socializing the individual and of fitting 
him to the economic and social environment. 
Biographies better than legal codes and constitu- 
tions. — It is a proof of the labored dullness that has 
spread its blighting influence over our school studies 
that life-giving biography, so strong and forcible in its 
effects, has been so much neglected in geography and 
science and, until of late, even in history. In civics 
we are still droning over the dull generalities of gov- 
ernments and constitutions and taxing power and are 
neglecting the men who made governments and con- 
stitutions and taxing systems. The life and deeds of 
Moses are far more instructive materials of education 
for young people than the system of laws which he 
codified. The lives of the men who made the Consti- 
tution of the United States are far more interesting and 
instructive to children than the Constitution itself. 
They developed it largely out of their own experiences 
and needs in dealing with government. No instru- 
ment of government can have much meaning unless we 
see clearly the historic background out of which it
-P-A-G-E-287
  
INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 279 
arose, the men whose experiences and ideas were the 
materials out of which they constructed it. 
A superior class of biographies is required. — This 
reénforcement of history, geography, and science by the 
vivid portrayal of strong leadership in men of achieve- 
ment opens the way to a vital strengthening of the 
curriculum. Biography plays powerfully into the 
genetic thought movement in actively developing 
projects. Such results, however, will not spring from 
feeble, poorly constructed biographies (mere praise of 
great men) or from shallow moralizing upon their vir- 
tues. Superficial, eulogistic stories of men and women 
will not serve the purpose. Well-chosen and well- 
wrought biographies of strong intellectual fiber should 
stimulate thought and reflection in children. Such 
stories should be spiced with anecdotes and sharp por- 
trayals of personal qualities. The deeds of men of 
action should be set forth in strong language, adequate 
to express fitly and portray fully the deeper experience 
of a personal nature. Big, worthy tasks of individual 
enterprise and of social service should be clearly ex- 
hibited in their hard-earned, struggling development. 
A strong handling of biography. — The severer prob- 
lems and difficulties of personal experience offer a 
chance to appreciate some of the sterner trials and 
achievements of life. The problems set up should 
stimulate reflective thinking. This stronger handling 
of significant biography cultivates breadth and tenacity 
of mental energy. The many-sided and versatile auto- 
biography of Benjamin Franklin suggests the intel- 
lectual quality, richness, and energy of thought that 
ought to be found in biography appropriate to older 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  2830 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
school children. There is a stimulation to sound 
thinking and a breadth of survey over larger areas of 
experience in such a biography that cultivates at a high 
tension the real art of thinking. To be sure, such well- 
wrought biographical narratives are, like all best 
things, rich and rare and not to be had for the asking. 
But much good American biography is already avail- 
able, and an intelligent demand will call forth still 
more. The best talent among writers should be dis- 
covered and drawn upon to produce this high quality 
of invigorating biographical story. Fortunately Amer- 
ican history has produced a strong array of worthy 
characters fully deserving of such biographical honors. 
The abundant source materials are within reach which 
will give the full, strong setting for these life histories. 
The best sources of suitable information should be 
drawn upon copiously and grouped artistically to fur- 
nish out these hero tales from real life and to give them 
their deserved places of honor in the happy yet serious 
instruction of children. 
Scant use made thus far of best biography. — The 
schools are now ready to receive and utilize these 
choice narratives as fast as they can be elaborated into 
complete stories. But our condensed textbooks and 
usual outline courses of study, until lately, have been 
almost oblivious of the existence of such powerfully 
educative material. They relegate all such matters to 
the supplementary and library books which the major- 
ity of schools probably do not possess. They are still 
dealing out the old conventional platitudes and mean- 
ingless commonplaces which have been the stock in 
trade of mere bookmakers for a long time. The
-P-A-G-E-289
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 281 
constantly increasing number of supplementary readers 
in geography, history, and science is a clear proof that 
the people generally are tired of this long-drawn-out 
misery of dullness. The supplementary readers are 
rich in descriptive matter and should be still further 
improved by focusing and organizing their illustrative 
material more consciously upon the central projects 
of American history and geography. 
Why should not these better organized and more 
educative materials be directly incorporated into the 
textbooks and not stored away in libraries and sup- 
plementary books which for the majority of schools 
have scarcely an existence? Even the majority of 
teachers are not well acquainted with this better class 
of stimulating thought materials, and they never will 
be so long as our present system of inferior textbooks 
prevails. A strong effort should be made to transform 
our textbooks of history, geography, and science so as 
to furnish a lively and rousing treatment of the most 
important projects and biographical stories. 
A worthy task for specialists. — One of the main 
difficulties in our present revision of the curriculum is 
to get a reorganization of this fuller descriptive and 
biographical information around the central types. 
Why should not our specialists in science, geography, 
and history, whose scholarly studies have given them 
a full command of these abundant sources, wake up to 
the situation? They are particularly qualified for 
bringing together and organizing for school use this 
strongly stimulating instructional material. Instead 
of framing lifeless textbooks of the stereotyped order, 
why not give themselves the joy of producing big
-P-A-G-E-290
  282 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
graphic and biographic projects dealing with national 
and world affairs so as to arouse the interest of boys and 
girls and thus to set them thinking? This is the pres- 
ent need of the school compared with which most 
other things are trivial. 
How to forge the connecting link between child 
and society. — When Samuel Morse in 1844 sent his first 
telegraphic message from Baltimore to Washington, he 
gave the first full proof of the success of his project of 
sending long-distance messages. He had been working 
for years on this project, and the sending of this first 
message was a great personal triumph. But his per- 
sonal success was the mere beginning of a widespread 
benefit to the nation and soon to the whole world. A 
full biographical account of Morse’s experiments lead- 
ing up to the successful use of his invention gives a 
strong link of connection between the success of his 
personal project and the larger interests of society 
which he served. Whenever a private individual 
works out a project which is then transformed into a 
scheme of large social benefit, the link is forged be- 
tween the individual and the social whole. Thus the 
individual biographies of inventors, discoverers, and 
leaders of progress are merged into the larger enter- 
prises of cities, of states, and of nations. Strong 
characters in history are chiefly distinguished by the 
fact that they are exponents of some significant social 
idea or enterprise, as was Florence Nightingale, when 
she boldly entered a new field and, serving as a nurse, 
organized hospitals for the care of sick and wounded 
soldiers on battlefields; or Peter Cooper who syste- 
matically saved up his great fortune through a long
-P-A-G-E-291
INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 283 
period of years for the purpose of founding the Cooper 
Union in Lower New York; or William Penn whose in- 
dividual fortune was expended in founding a colony for 
the protection of the Quakers and of others harassed 
by religious persecution. 
Social enterprises.— In the educative process of 
gradually inducting children into the complex machin- 
ery of industrial and social life the biographies of states- 
men, of inventors, and of industrial leaders are accord- 
ingly of superior value. The personal stories of their 
individual achievements, while interesting, instruc- 
tive, and inspiring, lead directly into larger social 
problems which children are called upon to under- 
stand. One after another the strong social instrumen- 
talities operating around the characters are brought to 
the notice and made clear to the understanding of the 
child by a full demonstration of typical projects which 
are in fact biographical exploits. In this manner, by 
virtue of the growing personal interest in the undertak- 
ing, the reader identifies his knowledge and his impulses 
with the larger enterprises of society itself. Through this 
gradually increasing acquaintance with society and its 
purposes he becomes an intelligent judge of social con- 
ditions and an interested, codperative worker in local 
social and larger world affairs. 
Society demands this social enrichment. — The 
great social and economic agencies of society, as fast as 
they become intelligently interested in school affairs, 
are strongly demanding this readjustment of the school 
course to social needs, this intensive enrichment of 
school topics in the combined interest of children and 
of society. The stirring biographies of leaders in
-P-A-G-E-292
  284 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
projects for social betterment are among the most ef- 
fective, well-chosen means of accomplishing this piece 
of educational work. They supply the rich content 
and inspiring motive which draw the young directly 
‘into outside social problems and life interests. Per- 
haps one significant reason why teachers are leaving 
the schools is that they, like boys and girls, wish to 
break out into a world where things of consequence are 
taking place. For the benefit also of teachers the school 
requires a closer contact with life in its active business 
and industrial phases. A dull, lifeless course of study 
strips the teacher of his proper incentives, and incentives 
are vital in any profession. If we want lazy, sluggish 
teachers in the schools, all that is necessary is to pro- 
long the present misery of dull monotony in the school 
studies. The better class of teachers will make their 
escape out into a world of freedom and action. By 
intensive biographic and social treatment teachers 
themselves should share in world activities. Of all 
places in the world the school should be in lively 
contact with the energetic forces of life. We have 
been complaining much because children refuse to 
stay longer in the schools. But now we may dis- 
cover that many of the best teachers refuse to stay in 
such a dull place. A dry and lifeless course of study 
is sure to drive the stronger teachers out of the pro- 
fession. 
A key to the social complex. — When Johns Hopkins 
bestowed his wealth upon the university that bears his 
name and also founded the great hospital at Baltimore, 
he was deeply interested in two private projects, which 
at the same time looked toward the public benefit.
-P-A-G-E-293
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 285 
These two private projects have developed into in- 
stitutions whose good effects have been felt not only 
in Baltimore but in widening circles throughout the 
world in stimulating scientific and educational research 
and progress. When Horace Mann set out on his 
campaign for founding normal schools in Massachu- 
setts eighty years ago, his personal interest was 
strongly involved in this particular scheme, but he was 
also setting in motion influences which have resulted in 
an extensive system of normal schools and teachers’ 
colleges which have become the bulwark of our educa- 
tional system. Booker Washington in starting the 
school at Tuskegee was engaged at first in a small 
private enterprise which under his personal leadership 
developed into a demonstration of negro education 
which has already had a far-reaching influence upon 
the negro race and has become a source of hope and 
inspiration for a whole nation in dealing with the race 
problem. Such private undertakings are in reality 
the response of individuals to powerful and insistent 
social and educational needs. They are distinct mani- 
festations of the identification of private interest and 
initiative with larger community enterprises. 
The social-educative process based on projects. — 
The typical life project, undertaken at first by the 
individual, is environed and intimately tied up with 
broader social and economic interests. Indeed it 
originates in a strongly felt social need and is a reorgani- 
zation of forces to meet this emergency. The study 
of these projects as they spring up, grow, and organize 
life activities in society is the most direct and effective 
teaching method for mastering the machinery of the  
-P-A-G-E-294
  286 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
economic and social world. The social system en masse 
is too complex and overpowering for the child’s in- 
telligence. But the single project, impersonated by a 
marked character and worked out in society as a con- 
crete demonstration, is the key that unlocks the social 
complex. As soon as the typical character of a project 
is detected, by applying its lesson to other kindred 
projects, its far-reaching scope and interpretative value 
are made to appear. 
The first railroad built by Stephenson in England 
was just such a project. As it grew and developed its 
successful method of handling traffic, other roads were 
built and eventually our complex rail system was 
evolved. Our present steamship navigation is the 
lengthened shadow of the first steam vessel. The 
present industrial processes and institutions in society 
were first invented or thought out by individuals as 
single projects and became in time the standard modes 
of economic and social procedure. The progress which 
the world has made can be effectively demonstrated 
by working over again the historic projects, and the 
immediate present can be understood by tracing the 
development of the old into new projects as fast as 
modern needs require. To immerse the child’s mind 
in the best historic projects which have developed into 
our present institutions and to keep his thoughts mov- 
ing intelligently in these channels is a wise direction 
of the educational forces. 
The social, codperative instinct strong in children. — 
The child is by nature a social spirit and responds at 
once to the social stimuli. The ambition to serve in 
social enterprises is spontaneous, and the impulse to
-P-A-G-E-295
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 287 
follow active, brainy leaders in successful projects is 
instinctive. The motive to participate in common 
action is one of the strong forces in human nature and 
when cultivated in right ways is of untold value to 
society. Codperation in common projects is the funda- 
mental need in every community, city, or state. In 
no other way can the community live and thrive. By 
an intensive study of these social projects children are 
drawn into full sympathy for such enterprises and at the 
same time are becoming intelligently acquainted with 
the forces at work in helpful movements. Franklin’s 
life as described in his ‘‘Autobiography” is a strong 
stimulus to social spirit because he engaged so freely 
in a great variety of beneficial projects of direct service 
to the community in which he lived. He remarks also 
that in early life he read a book on projects that set 
his mind to work in this field and influenced his action 
in later years. 
Results of cultivating the social impulse. — The 
bent of mind toward working out useful projects, if it 
could be encouraged and fostered in the schools, would 
be of priceless value. It would be impossible to meas- 
ure the contribution of such an educative procedure 
to the public welfare. It would be a consummation 
of what education could accomplish under happy aus- 
pices. It would produce a complete reconciliation 
and harmony between the impulse for activity of the 
growing youth and the forces and institutional activi- 
ties at work in the outside world. The educational 
processes and the materials of study in their true or- 
ganization would be those of life itself. When children 
pass from the school into business or trade or profession, 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
r 1 
288 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
there would be no break but a natural order of develop- 
ing experience. 
A complete experience — Frémont. — Frémont in 
his second exploration of the Western mountains 
found himself and his party of twenty-five men in mid- 
winter on the east side of the lofty snow-clad Sierra 
: Nevada range. From solar observations taken Fré- 
mont knew that only seventy miles distant on the west 
side of this high mountain wall was the ranch of Captain 
Sutter on the Sacramento River. His men agreed with 
Frémont to make the desperate effort to climb this 
mountain ridge and cross to the other side. Some 
sixty-seven horses and mules carried their baggage and 
equipment. The higher they climbed up the ridges, 
the deeper was the snow and the more rugged the steep, 
rocky slopes and the more bitter the cold. They made 
mauls and went ahead to break a path through the 
deep snow. Both horses and men gave out in toiling 
up the slippery slopes and often fell back. * After three 
weeks of incessant toil they reached the higher levels 
where in places the snow was twenty feet deep. Mules 
and horses were killed and their flesh cooked and eaten. 
At last they stood on the summit of the snowy ridge, 
more than nine thousand feet above sea level, and 
looked down into the warm green valley of the Sacra- 
mento River. In their weakened and starved condi- 
tion the rugged descent on the west slope was almost 
as toilsome as their upward climb had been. When at 
last the valley widened out and the green, grassy hill- 
sides appeared and the hungry mules and horses could 
eat their fill, the men rejoiced that they had escaped 
from the Arctie snows and dangers of their remarkable 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 289. 
journey. Not a man was lost, but half of the mules 
and horses had been sacrificed in the mountains. 
Frémont had pushed ahead to Sutter’s fort and re- 
turned with food and supplies. Great was the rejoicing 
when the men found themselves again in a land of 
plenty and comfort! 
If the complete story of this remarkable passage of 
the mountains in midwinter is presented vividly and 
discussed step by step with children, they will share the 
difficulties and hardships and sufferings of the men. 
The brave persistence of the adventurers, meeting 
almost overwhelming difficulties, excites wonder and 
sympathy. Children get a new experience of what 
average heroic men can go through with, and they will 
rejoice in the final complete success of their efforts. 
Just to the extent to which the children have appreci- 
ated these severe trials and struggles have they shared 
in the hard experiences through which the men had 
passed. 
Every topic a life experience. — When children 
finally complete such a narrative, they may draw a 
long breath and realize that they themselves have had 
a new experience with life. They have seen and felt 
things that open up a new world to them. Every 
important teaching unit which children are called upon 
to grapple with in their studies might be pre- 
sented and discussed in such a way as to completely 
engross their mental energies and command their un- 
divided thoughts and efforts. When they pause at 
the end of such a complete treatment of the topic and 
look back upon the whole subject, they will realize 
that they have passed through a great experience.  
-P-A-G-E-298
  290 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
A course of study converted into life experience. — 
Why should not a course of study consist of a series of 
strong, vigorous, lasting experiences? To gain an 
actual and telling experience in some field of action is 
of far greater worth than any quantity of padded in- 
formation. It is no small matter to transform school 
topics into rugged life experiences, to allow a child to 
construct in his own thinking a body of knowledge 
which, like the walls of the famous castle, is built of 
living stones, that is, brave warriors. If children’s 
thoughts are kept busy with these strong developing 
projects, they are in the midst of the hurly-burly of life 
and are gaining genuine experiences accompanied by 
such knowledge as adheres to real life enterprises. 
The dynamic quality of such thinking as merges the 
individual interest into social projects is its chief virtue. 
Make this aggressive spirit triumphant in school studies 
and keep it actively at work organizing experimental 
knowledge along the main highways of human en- 
deavor, and results will come in the form of organized 
knowledge and in developed individual and social 
character. 
SumMMary 
By setting up an important and desirable end to be achieved the 
project arouses all the latent energy required for successful conquest. 
The project is the most dynamic form that instruction can take 
because it awakens the strong natural impulse for definite achieve- 
mths vigorous motivation exhibits itself in all kinds of individual 
and social projects or enterprises. 
These life projects carried forward under rigorous practical con- 
ditions are exacting in their demands on thought and action. 
Projects worked out in their original genetic environments are 
best suited for incorporation into school work.
-P-A-G-E-299
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS 291 
The biographic interest reénforces a great variety of these life 
enterprises, in history, geography, and science. American history 
consists of a great succession of individual and social projects. Out 
of these energetic projects have sprung our peculiar American 
institutions. 
Biographical projects are the introductions to social and political 
enterprises of great moment. The individual interest merges in 
and is representative of the broad social interest. 
These developing projects furnish the keys to our complex social 
organization and give children an intelligent introduction to the 
world of affairs where they may learn to live and act with dis- 
cretion. 
Fully developed and organized and rounded out in their actual 
life relations these projects give the nearest approach to real experi- 
ence that the school is capable of producing.

  CHAPTER IX 
THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE — ONE OF A 
SERIES OF GREAT PROJECTS 
Organization on a broader scale. — The argument 
in favor of the reorganization of the curriculum on the 
basis of large teaching units has been reénforced already 
by specific illustration in the case of the New Orleans 
project and of the land project described in the Virginia 
Plantation. But the scope of the organizing principle 
in one of these large units is so extensive and the variety 
of such projects so great that other illustrations, de- 
veloped perhaps on a still broader scale, are needed. 
The full strength of a typical life project as an organizer 
of knowledge is best shown by tracing the development 
of the original project into later kindred projects dis- 
tributed through the course of study. The growth of 
the same fundamental idea through a succession of 
large projects continuous through the grades and con- 
stantly enlarging its scope furnishes an example of 
organization on a broad scale. 
Outlines are inadequate. — This serial development 
of basal themes on the stepping-stones furnished by 
big, central object lessons is our ground plan of organi- 
zation. When this process of learning is dealt with as 
one continuous, developing thought movement, it shows 
four significant phases of expansion. But a mere 
logical statement of principles involved in such a 
292
-P-A-G-E-301
  THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE 293 
thought movement is inadequate. An expanded ob- 
jective demonstration is required which shows plainly 
the four developing stages in the growth of such a 
project, expanding eventually into a series of projects 
or complete units. We might suggest this movement 
by giving brief outlines, but even elaborately prepared 
outlines are unsatisfactory, because they omit the 
descriptive content, the illustrative enrichment so 
essential and yet so difficult for teachers to secure. 
The life-giving elements can not be furnished by such 
an outline, and organization without such enrichment 
is merely predicated and not real. Outlines carefully 
developed on the basis of abundant source materials are 
excellent for those who make them. But a young 
teacher with nothing to work with but furnished out- 
lines is in dire straits. To a busy teacher who is eager 
for good teaching material, somebody else’s outline is 
little better than an aggravation. 
Complete demonstrations of large units. — The 
would-be poet will not recommend himself highly to 
lovers of verse by preparing outlines upon which others 
are advised to construct great poems; likewise the 
ambitious orator will scarcely win applause by supply- 
ing outlines upon which others should indite great 
speeches. Such formal, dictated outlines have not the 
true ring of genuine performance. So-called educators 
should not be allowed to mystify teachers by furnishing 
shallow, pretentious outlines. It will be a great day for 
education when real thinkers begin to vie with each 
other in the effort to produce superior and genuine 
organizations of knowledge, complete in treatment and 
method. They should be adequate and suitable for

  294 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
school use, what — for lack of a better name — might 
be called masterpieces in the teaching art, showing a 
complete exposition of the subject. 
An effort to meet this need. — We find it necessary, 
therefore, so far as in us lies, to enter again into a rather 
full treatment of one of these large units so as to give 
an unequivocal demonstration of its scope and organiz- 
ing capacity. There is a serious lack of such demon- 
strated organizations, and somebody ought to make 
the attempt. Until explicit examples of such intensive, 
scholarly treatment of large units of study are furnished, 
teachers generally are apt to make but little progress 
in their own efforts at organizing. They need illustra- 
tions. They do not comprehend what is meant by 
centers of organization or problem projects or natural 
sequence or intensive treatment. 
Organize in a connected series of large units. — 
There seems to be little doubt that this effort to work 
out complete illustrative monographs on important 
topics is a serious and difficult undertaking in practical 
education. But they are much needed and the time 
is now ripe for a far simpler organization of studies on 
the basis of these central units as a means of escape 
from multiplicity and from a certain troublesome 
confusion among studies. The proposal now is to 
simplify knowledge by grouping its elements atound 
a few basal centers of organization. With each ad- 
vance into the fields of knowledge these central units 
should be connected into progressive thought move- 
ments continuous throughout the course. Any impor- 
tant typical project is one link in a chain of related 
projects stretching longitudinally through the course. 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE 295 
When properly developed in sequence these related 
projects represent in combination the organization of 
extensive knowledge along the developing course of a 
fundamental constructive idea. The topic selected 
as the first center of organization is the purchase of 
Louisiana during Jefferson’s administration. It was 
a government project and one important stage in the 
steady movement for territorial expansion which is a 
marked feature of American progress. 
Tue PurcHASE oF LOUISIANA 
The causes leading up to the purchase of Louisiana 
include a series of great events involving the United 
States and several of the large nations of Europe. 
The French, originally, by pushing west along the 
Great Lakes and south along the Mississippi River, 
had owned and occupied by forts and settlements the 
whole eastern half of the great valley. But when the 
French lost Canada in 1763, the English naturally came 
into possession of all this territory east of the Mis- 
sissippi except Florida and New Orleans. 
The westward pressure of the pioneers. — With the 
close of the Revolution the thirteen colonies came into 
the ownership of the Northwest Territory, and England 
in turn was shut out. By the beginning of the nine- 
teenth century (1800) the westward-pushing pioneers 
had forced their way into the Ohio Valley and were 
building up strong settlements (the basis for new states) 
from Alabama to Illinois. As these rugged and power- 
ful pioneers moved westward, driving back the fierce 
Indian tribes, they were certain soon to cross the 
Mississippi into the still greater West. Being shut
-P-A-G-E-304
  296 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
out by the Allegheny Mountains from the Eastern 
states and finding it almost impossible to ship their 
heavy products over the long, rough mountain roads to 
Eastern markets, they turned their eyes toward the 
mouth of the Mississippi River as the natural and only 
outlet for their products. It was so easy to load flat- 
boats with bacon, grain, tobacco, and whiskey and send 
them floating down the rivers to New Orleans, whence 
they found their way in ships to the Eastern cities, to 
Europe, and the West Indies. The conviction grew 
powerful among the Westerners that they must have 
the mouth of the Mississippi and thus secure a safe 
market in that direction for their goods. 
Spain in control. — But Spain owned New Orleans 
and all the Louisiana country, with all the region west 
of the Mississippi. Trouble and war were almost cer- 
tain to arise between the United States and any country 
that held the mouth of the Mississippi. At this time 
Spain was one of the powerful nations of Europe, own- 
ing Florida, Louisiana, Mexico, and nearly all of South 
America except Brazil. 
Danger from Napoleon. — But in 1803 Spain had 
traded Louisiana to France, and Napoleon, the most 
powerful ruler in Europe, was planning to send out 
armies and settlers to build up a great French province 
in Louisiana. With his remarkable energy and success 
Napoleon threatened to destroy the prospects of the 
Western settlements. 
At this critical moment came an unexpected oppor- 
tunity to purchase the Louisiana territory for the 
United States. In the midst of his plans for building 
up a powerful French empire in Louisiana, Napoleon
-P-A-G-E-305
THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE 297° 
found that a war with England was rapidly approaching. 
He was suddenly called upon to make great prep- 
arations for an invasion of England, and this re- 
quired large expenditures. At the same time a strong 
French army sent to San Domingo to suppress a rebel- 
lion of the negroes led by Toussaint was almost de- 
stroyed by yellow fever and by Toussaint’s resistance. 
This strongly suggested to Napoleon the difficulty of 
sending armies to America. 
Napoleon’s offer.—In the meantime President 
Jefferson had sent envoys to Napoleon to try to pur- 
chase New Orleans so as to secure the mouth of the 
Mississippi for the United States. For a long time the 
American envoys could make no headway. But pressed 
by his threatened war with England, Napoleon sud- 
denly changed his plans and suggested that he would 
sell New Orleans. Livingston and Monroe, our envoys 
in France, were authorized to offer two million dollars 
for New Orleans, but they were completely surprised 
by an offer of Napoleon to sell the whole of Louisiana 
for twenty millions. This was more than they had 
bargained for and more than they wanted. They 
didn’t know what they could do with such an immense 
territory. It would be like an elephant on their hands; 
it would at once double the size of the United States. 
Besides, Jefferson did not believe that he had any right 
according to the Constitution to purchase new terri- 
tory. As a close-construction Democrat he did not 
think that a President should do anything not expressly 
granted by the Constitution. 
Jefferson knew also that the people of the United ~ 
States and especially the Westerners were determined ~ 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  298 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
to have the mouth of the Mississippi River even if 
they had to go to war for it. Now was the chance to 
get it without war, a chance that might never occur 
again in the lifetime of the Nation. The American 
envoys were considering these things, and they grad- 
ually enlarged their minds to take in the bigness of this 
purchase. Finally, in April, 1803, they decided to 
take the responsibility and completed the agreement 
with Napoleon to purchase Louisiana for about fifteen 
million dollars. It may almost be said that Napoleon 
forced them to take the whole of Louisiana, although 
neither the envoys nor the President desired it. This 
shows how little even great statesmen at that time ap- 
preciated the value of the Louisiana territory. Na- 
poleon said that it would be of no advantage for him to 
own the rest of Louisiana unless he could control the 
mouth of the Mississippi River. 
The purchase.— When the news of this offer 
reached America, it aroused much excitement and dis- 
cussion. There was strong opposition in Congress 
against paying out such an immense sum of money for 
a region at that time unexplored and very little known. 
The President felt compelled to approve of it although 
contrary to his principles. Congress passed a bill rat- 
ifying the purchase and appropriating the necessary 
money. In November, 1803, the transfer from the 
French to the United States was formally made at 
New Orleans, and the American flag was raised. The 
taxable property of this region to-day is valued at 
many hundreds of times the purchase price. 
This new territory contained nearly a million square 
miles or about three times as much as the original thir- 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
  THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE 299 
teen colonies. The Northwest Territory, including the 
five states north of the Ohio River, which fell to the 
United States at the close of the Revolution included 
about one fourth as much land as the Louisiana terri- 
tory, or 248,000 square miles. At the present time the 
Louisiana territory, comprising the major part of 
thirteen states, has a population of 15,000,000 or 
about three times the population of the United States 
in 1803, the time of the purchase. What its popula- 
tion may be in another hundred years we can hardly 
estimate. 
The historical influence of this vast cession of terri- 
tory upon the Union and its future growth makes this 
purchase one of the most important events in American 
history. The whole Mississippi Valley was now des- 
tined to be occupied by one nation. Even now more 
than half the population of the United States is found 
in this valley. After taking possession of the country 
as far as the Rocky Mountains, it was almost certain 
that this vigorous Yankee race would push on to the 
Pacific shores and thus occupy the whole territory later 
contained in the United States. There was no race 
to the south or to the north that could check the west- 
ward march of this strong people. 
Lewis and Clark. — At the time of the purchase this 
region had a very small population, mostly in Louisiana 
at or near New Orleans, about 50,000 in all, including 
a few French villages like St. Louis farther up the river. 
This region, as a whole, was but little known, a few ex- 
ploring parties and trappers having passed across its 
plains or along its river courses. The greater part 
of it was wholly unknown.

300 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
As soon as the purchase had been settled, President 
Jefferson formed a plan for exploring this vast unknown 
country which had so suddenly and unexpectedly fallen 
to our share. Two young men, friends of the President, 
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark (a younger brother 
of George Rogers Clark), were put in joint command 
of a small exploring party which was to make its way 
up the Missouri River to the mountains and then, 
crossing them, to find a route to the Pacific Ocean. 
They were to report to the Government upon the rivers 
and mountains, the best routes for traffic, the character 
of the Indian tribes, the natural products, minerals, and 
wild animals of the region. 
In the original party there were twenty-eight, four- 
teen being soldiers of the regular army. They were 
carefully picked men. Besides, there were nine boat- 
men and some soldiers who were to go as far as the 
Mandan tribes. They equipped themselves with three 
boats, the largest being a keel boat fifty-five feet in 
length and supplied with twenty-two oars and a mast 
for a sail. 
Early in the spring of 1804 they started from St. 
Louis and pushed up against the swift current of the 
Missouri River, which made their journey slow and 
laborious. In Missouri they found the country heav- 
ily wooded, but turning northward they came into the 
more open country where larger game abounded. 
Two French voyageurs who knew the country were with 
them to act as hunters and as interpreters with the 
Indians. At Council Bluffs they met chiefs of some 
of the Indian tribes and tried to explain to them the 
transfer of control of this whole country to the United 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE 301 
States Government. By the opening of the winter 
they came into the country of the Mandan Indians in 
Dakota, built log huts on an island in the river, hunted 
during the winter months, and made preparations for 
a further spring journey. 
The next spring they followed the Missouri to the 
great falls, pushed up through the deep canyon called 
“the gate of the mountains,’ and found themselves in 
the midst of the wilderness of mountains at the head- 
waters of the Missouri. Game was scarce, the Indians 
were gone, and the passage over the main range was 
extremely difficult. Passing beyond the range, they 
found it impossible to go down the branch of the Co- 
lumbia because of falls, rapids, and canyons. They 
turned back across the range, followed the valley north- 
ward a hundred miles, and finally broke a way across 
the range through snow and cold to a stream down 
which they were able to descend in boats. They came 
out of the mountains on the west side in a haggard, 
half-starved condition. But fish and food were plenti- 
ful, the Indians friendly, and they pushed down to 
the Columbia and on to the coast. 
The second winter they spent near the ocean in a 
camp built on the banks of the Columbia, suffering 
much from the rainy weather and from lack of nour- 
ishing food. But they had accomplished the main 
purpose of their journey, explored a large area of ab- 
solutely unknown country, and were now ready to 
return. 
Not finding an English ship with supplies as they 
expected, they turned back poorly furnished for the 
return journey across the mountains and plains. But 
 
-P-A-G-E-310

302 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
the Indians of the Columbia treated them well and 
supplied them with provisions and horses, and they 
reached the mountains before cold weather set in. 
From their previous experience they were able to 
shorten their trip across the mountains. Just east of 
the mountains they had some exciting adventures with 
the Indians and grizzly bears. One division of the 
party went down the Missouri in boats, the other passed 
down the Yellowstone, and they came together at the 
junction of the two rivers. 
) From this point the journey down the Missouri was 
| easy and rapid, and they reached St. Louis without 
| serious difficulty. They had lost but one man on the 
way. In spite of exposure, danger, and hardships of 
| all kinds, the men had kept well. For nearly two years 
the party of Lewis and Clark had not been heard from, 
and many believed that all of them had perished. 
They brought back full and interesting reports of 
the country, which were furnished to Congress and 
the President. They had traveled about 9,000 miles 
through a region almost completely unknown and had 
awakened a great interest in these new possessions. 
This was the first of a series of exploring trips de- 
signed to make known the geography and resources of 
the country. 
Pike on the Upper Mississippi. — Zebulon Pike took 
a boat voyage up the Upper Mississippi in 1805 to its 
sources in the lakes and made an interesting report to 
the Government. The next year he led a small com- 
pany up the Missouri and across the plains till Pike’s 
Peak was first seen and located and the sources of the 
Arkansas iver traced into the mountains. The next

spring he moved down into what is now New Mexico, 
was arrested and held prisoner for invading Mexican 
territory with an armed force, but was later released. 
Frémont’s explorations. — The great pathfinder of 
the Rocky Mountains was John C. Frémont, who made 
his first expedition to the Rocky Mountains in 1842. 
On a second trip he passed across the Rockies, explored 
Salt Lake, traveled northwest to the Columbia River, 
returned south, and during the winter crossed the 
snow-covered Sierra Nevada Mountains into central 
California. During the War with Mexico he raised a 
force in California and won it for the United States. 
Later he traveled and explored the rivers and passes 
of the Rocky Mountains to find the best routes of travel 
and traffic between the East and the West. His ex- 
plorations were largely beyond the Louisiana Purchase 
but included this region also. 
These were a few of the pioneer explorers who tray- 
eled with small parties across the plains and moun- 
tains, enduring remarkable hardships and reporting to 
the Government and the American people the wonders 
of this vast new land. 
The Florida Purchase. — The purchase of Louisiana 
was followed by other important purchases of territory 
which have continued to enlarge the land area of the 
United States. In 1819 Florida, which had been 
owned by Spain and had caused the United States 
much trouble by reason of Indian attacks and also by 
helping England as a base for carrying on the War of 
1812, was purchased by the United States for five mil- 
lion dollars. This rounded out our territory in that 
direction, and since then Florida has become a flourish-

  304 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
ing state, famous for fruit culture and much visited by 
Northern people as a place for winter residence. 
Texas and Mexico. — The early history of Texas 
is one of the most thrilling stories of the American 
frontier. The rapid growth of Texas after the 
Civil War and especially in the last twenty years 
has made it one of the leading states in wealth and 
population. 
Texas, which had become an independent state 
by revolting against Mexico, was admitted to the 
Union as a state in 1845. 
Oregon. — The War with Mexico, which was largely 
undertaken for winning from Mexico the lands of the 
southwest, ended in the cession of a very large tract of 
land to the United States, including California and New 
Mexico and in fact all the land west of the Louisiana 
Purchase and south of Oregon. For this region the 
United States also paid Mexico fifteen millions, besides 
important claims amounting to three millions. With 
the incorporation of Texas and the Mexican cessions 
into the territory of the United States a large Spanish- 
Mexican population was taken. Thus the present 
boundaries (including the Gadsden Purchase) were 
established. Only a year later than the admission of 
Texas, 1846, the dispute about Oregon (between Eng- 
land and the United States) was settled by extending 
the old line of 49° westward to the Pacific. The Oregon 
country has since developed into the prosperous states 
of Washington and Oregon and parts of other states. 
The westward movement of the people and their occu- 
pation of all the territory now in the United States were 
thus provided for.
-P-A-G-E-313
  THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE 305 
Alaska. —In 1867 the United States Government, 
under the leadership of Secretary Seward, purchased 
from Russia the Alaskan territory for $7,200,000. It 
contained an area of 591,000 square miles or more 
than one half as much as the Louisiana Purchase. 
Alaska also in recent years has developed unexpected 
wealth in its gold mines, its coal and other minerals, its 
forests and fisheries. 
In December, 1898, at the close of the War with Spain, 
the United States, by the payment of twenty million 
dollars, received full possession of Porto Rico and the 
Spanish islands of the West Indies, the island of Guam 
in the Pacific (one of the Ladrones), and the Philippines. 
During the Spanish War, the Hawaiian Islands de- 
sired protection and annexation to the United States 
and were also taken into the possession of the Union. 
Thus the long series of additions to our territory 
stretches out through our history and shows the aggres- 
sive character of our people in their westward move- 
ment. 
In 1910 the territorial area of the United States (not 
including Alaska and the Philippines) was 3,026,789 
square miles. With Alaska and the Philippines the 
area of the United States is 3,624,122 square miles.

CHAPTER X 
REMARKS ON ORGANIZATION AS ILLUS- 
TRATED BY THE LOUISIANA TOPIC 
AS A TYPE STUDY 
The broad scope of this unit. — This project ade- 
quately worked out illustrates organization in four 
different aspects: 
First, when treated in its purely historical relations, 
it brings together and focuses upon Jefferson’s final 
action (his decision to make the purchase and his 
recommendation to Congress) a large amount of in- 
teresting historical data; namely, the previous history 
of French and Spanish explorations and claims; the 
determined ambition of Napoleon to found a strong 
French state in Louisiana; the westward progress of 
American settlements beyond the Alleghenies and their 
insistent demand that the United States control the 
mouth of the Mississippi even if it made war necessary; 
the European situation and Napoleon’s sudden change 
of purpose and his offer to sell the whole of Louisiana; 
the surprise of the American envoys, Livingston and 
Monroe, over this astonishing proposal; the sharp 
dilemma into which President Jefferson was thrown 
when called upon to choose between what he considered 
his duty under the Constitution and the practical 
necessity for taking advantage of the situation and for 
securing this great accession of territory; and, finally, 
307
-P-A-G-E-316
308 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
the money question — how to raise this enormous sum 
for the purchase price. 
Later followed the sending out of Lewis and Clark 
to explore and report on this vast, largely unknown 
territory, which was preceded by the official act of 
taking possession of the new territory at New Orleans. 
Descriptively presented, this historic event and its 
probable outcome have a strong dramatic interest. At 
the crisis two notable historic personalities stand out 
strongly, Jefferson and Napoleon, while the diplomatic 
maneuvers of the envoys in France and the lively de- 
bates in Congress furnish an interesting background. 
As a sequel the journey of Lewis and Clark up the 
Missouri, across the Rockies, and down the Columbia 
to the Pacific is the most adventurous and significant 
exploration project in our Western history. A pros- 
pective survey of the results likely to flow from this 
great historic act will add much to its meaning. The 
whole Mississippi Valley to the Rocky Mountains is 
drawn into the Union with the promise of many new 
states. There is also more than a strong suggestion 
that the people will push on to the Pacific and thus 
complete the great westward movement. 
The grouping of important facts about one center. — 
The characteristic feature of this unit of study is the 
wide range and variety of important historic data 
organized and focused upon this central topic. Around 
the simple fact of this purchase are grouped diplomacy 
at Paris and Washington, important legislative dis- 
cussion and action in Congress and in the French 
chamber, a vast scheme of public finance, the decision 
of a great constitutional question of much significance
-P-A-G-E-317
  REMARKS ON ORGANIZATION 309 
for the future, the strong personal traits of great his- 
toric characters, a crisis in European history, the west- 
ward expansion of settlement in America, and the 
opening up of a still larger area for exploration and 
settlement in the West. This is a powerful demon- 
stration of the great extent and variety of historical 
materials that properly and wisely may be grouped 
around one central organizing idea. 
Many phases of geography presented. — The second 
phase of organization wrapped up in this treatment 
of the Louisiana Purchase is the extensive incorpo- 
ration of geography and other school studies with his- 
tory. At the beginning and throughout the whole 
treatment of this subject, local and world maps are 
in constant use and geographical data are as essential 
to a proper understanding as history itself. General 
maps of America and of Europe, a special series of his- 
torical maps exhibiting this expansion in territory, step 
by step, the definite sketching on paper and on the 
blackboard of the Louisiana and later accessions, a 
detailed map of the course followed by Lewis and Clark, 
the early maps of exploration and discovery of Euro- 
pean states in North America showing the influence of 
the Allegheny Mountains upon the Mississippi Valley 
and its settlements — all these phases of geography 
are essential to a real understanding of this central 
historic project. This geographic background is so 
determining that no rational separation between the 
historic and geographic data is possible. They are 
organized into one large whole which continues in one 
combined development through kindred topics later in 
the course. 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
ee ee eer eae mee no nr rere 
310 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
Scientific data abundant. — Even the scientific fea- 
tures of the Louisiana topic come into prominence in the 
Lewis and Clark enterprise which was a combined geo- 
graphic and scientific expedition sent out by the Govern- 
ment to explore and report on climate, products, plants 
and animals, mineral deposits, and the economic re- 
sources of this vast region. Even the study of Indian 
tribes, their characters and customs, was an important 
phase of their plan and purpose. Scientific experts at- 
tended the expedition for the purpose of collecting 
scientific data and materials. Ultimately these re- 
sources of the new region were what most concerned the 
American people in making this expensive purchase. 
Arithmetical calculations contribute much. — Arith- 
metic is also put to good use in clearing up important 
questions relating to financial estimates and the extent 
of territorial claims. The necessary mathematical 
calculations involved in the study and comparison of 
areas, populations, land values, and costs offer an ex- 
tensive field for problems in calculation. Such calcula- 
tions are important because they bring into the topic 
a much sharper definition of meanings and values. 
For example, let the children figure out the value of the 
Louisiana tract at ten dollars per acre and compare 
the result with the purchase price and again at one 
hundred dollars per acre. Again, compare the sums paid 
out by the Government at various times for Louisiana, 
Florida, Mexico, Alaska, and the Philippines. What 
was the cost of the Lewis and Clark expedition, and 
how were the leaders and men of the party paid? Com- 
pare the land areas controlled by the United States 
with those of England, China, and other countries.
-P-A-G-E-319
  REMARKS ON ORGANIZATION 311 
Effective language.— The language training in- 
volved in a series of lessons on the Louisiana Purchase, 
both oral and written, because of the variety and rich- 
ness of the topics dealt with, gives the most effective 
kind of language development. An adequate reproduc- 
tion of such lessons is more valuable than mere drills 
or formal exercises, because strong thought material 
contributes to independence and fullness of sentence 
construction. Such is the inevitable correlation of these 
important studies. 
Life itself demands this grouping of studies. — A 
completely developed project like this is grounded in a 
life situation that naturally combines this related group 
of studies into an inseparable whole. Human activi- 
ties, operating under natural and necessary conditions, 
gave birth to this practical organization of knowledge. 
The schoolmaster can not improve on this organiza- 
tion. He would better accept it and operate on this 
basis, for his purpose is to train children to an under- 
standing of life itself as exhibited in such projects. The 
big organized topic is the natural product of a habit of 
thought which sees things in their proper, many-sided 
relations and in their larger groupings. There is no 
way of avoiding strong, central units of study if we 
think properly. This second stage of correlating im- 
portant studies into family groups such as practical 
life everywhere exhibits involves an important recon- 
structive principle in curriculum making. 
Survey of earlier territorial extensions. — The third 
aspect of organization in the treatment of the Loui- 
siana Purchase is seen in the expansion of this topic to 
include the later accessions of territory down to the
-P-A-G-E-320
  312 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
present time. Indeed we may look backward to the 
territorial expansion of our country from the Colonial 
period on and compare Louisiana especially to the ac- 
quisition of the Northwest Territory at the close of the 
Revolution. In fact the conquest of the Northwest 
Territory by George Rogers Clark during the Revolu- 
tion and Franklin’s successful demand that the right 
of the colonies to this territory be allowed in the Treaty 
of Paris together make up one of the central topics in 
American history. As a full unit of study it should 
precede the treatment of the Louisiana Purchase and 
form one great link in the chain of territorial develop- 
ment. 
Later acquisitions. — The Louisiana Purchase itself 
was not only the largest territory gained at any one 
time, but it settled once for all an acute constitutional 
question — the right or, at least, the power of the Fed- 
eral Government to purchase new territory. This es- 
tablished a precedent which afterward held for impor- 
tant later extensions and purchases. The first of these 
was Florida, thus settling our boundaries on the south- 
east. The Texas cession, the Mexican purchase, in- 
cluding California and the Southwest, should be com- 
pared in extent and importance with the Louisiana 
Purchase. A careful study of the maps of these west- 
ern sections of our country, in view of their present 
development of resources and of population, will give 
unusual zest and meaning to such comparisons. The 
Oregon claim was based in part upon the explorations 
of Lewis and Clark, who first opened up extensive por- 
tions of the Northwest. The settlement of the Oregon 
question rounded out our territories to the Western

seas. The methods by which these new lands were 
gained, whether by conquest or by purchase, are de- 
serving of fair, unbiased judgment, with a full consid- 
eration of the motives that inspired our people in ac- 
quiring these territories. The acquisition of Alaska, 
the Philippines, Porto Rico, and Hawaii and the treat- 
ment of these as possessions of the United States close 
up this great period of westward expansion and also 
bring to the front important questions of Colonial policy 
and the right to govern the people of such acquired 
territories. 
A complete historical cycle. — Out of a comparison 
of these acquisitions and of the problems involved there 
develops a long forward movement from the Colonial 
times to the present, showing a steady westward ad- 
vance of population and a strong demand for more 
territory till our possession of the great central zone 
across North America was complete. The purchase of 
Louisiana is the central stadium in this more than cen- 
tury-long movement to determine the boundaries of a 
great nation. It is the nucleus around which we can 
organize and unify the whole great cycle of events. 
This plan of expanding the Louisiana project both 
backward and forward into a series of kindred topics 
developing through our whole national history gives'a 
stronger significance and a permanent organization of 
knowledge on a life basis. 
A framework for later inclusions. — Such an impor- 
tant and fundamental historical development, once 
mastered in a full and adequate survey, becomes then 
the framework into which we can fit constructively 
many other important related topics in our expanding  
-P-A-G-E-322
  314 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
national life. For example, the great highways, canals, 
and railroads developed between the East and the ex- 
panding West are the immediate outcome of this west- 
ward growth in territory and of the flow of population 
into these new regions. Close upon the heels of this 
westward expansion comes the admission of new states 
into the Union with the really tremendous problems 
involved, as in the case of the admission of Missouri 
and of California. The admission of such vast terri- 
tories into our domain has been called revolutionary 
because it compelled all Americans to expand their 
conceptions of national life to unheard-of proportions. 
Some of our great statesmen even were slow to grasp 
the meaning of these swift and colossal changes. 
A comprehensive interpretation.— The Louisiana 
Purchase as a large national project lies midway in our 
American history between the early Colonial develop- 
ments as its forerunners and the later expansions of the 
nineteenth century as its lineal successors. The spirit 
of this whole historic movement for three hundred 
years and more has been one of aggressive appropria- 
tion of new territory in the westward march of the people 
and of the Nation. The comparison of the Louisiana 
Purchase with these earlier and later projects of ex- 
pansion brings into conspicuous evidence one of the 
powerful tendencies that interprets and unifies the 
whole of our American history. 
A new and still greater teaching unit. — With this 
great topic completely mastered as a vantage ground 
we may take a glance — and more than a glance — at 
British Colonial development. In dipping into Eng- 
lish Colonial history we soon find that we are dealing
-P-A-G-E-323
  REMARKS ON ORGANIZATION 315 
with a more extensive and varied field of study and one 
closely akin to our topic of American expansion. In 
fact it is the same topic from the standpoint of another 
nation, quite differently conditioned. At some later 
point in the seventh or eighth grade a full treatment of 
England’s Colonial expansion, as illustrated in India 
and one or two more of her great colonies, as Australia, 
will furnish us another typical life project belonging 
to the same series as the Louisiana Purchase. The 
history of the British Colonial Empire soon reveals 
itself as a marvelous introduction to modern history 
and geography from the European standpoint. But 
before making comparisons and drawing conclusions it 
will be wise to make such a study of England’s pos- 
sessions and how she gained them as will enable us to 
form a sound basis for comparison.

EXPANSION 
Robert Clive. — The treaty of peace of 1763 which 
surrendered Canada to the British also established the 
British power in India where the French had again suf- 
fered defeat. A young clerk, Robert Clive, in the 
service of the East India Company was chiefly respon- 
sible for this success of the British in India. Both the 
French and English had established trading posts along 
the eastern coast of India and were competing for the 
rich trade in silk and oriental wares. One of the 
French leaders, Dupleix, decided to drive out the Brit- 
ish and by establishing friendly relations with native 
princes secure the control of India and of the lucrative 
Eastern trade. Dupleix was at first completely suc-

cessful. When Madras and its fort were captured by 
the French, Clive had escaped in disguise to one of the 
smaller stations. Dupleix now joined forces with a 
powerful native prince and helped to establish him as 
ruler in aaa India, known as the Carnatic. At 
this juncture, when the French power was at its height 
and seemed to threaten the British merchants with 
complete ruin, clive came to the front and offered to 
strike a blow in defense of the English company. 
With a small force of two hundred English and three 
hundred nie clr he made a rapid march through 
storms to Arcot, the capital of the Indian prince, and 
captured its great fortress. Knowing that he would 
be fiercely attacked by the combined French and their 
allies, Clive dhashoned his earthworks and gathered 
supplies. Here 
an army that 
finally made a 
and well prep 
after received 
the French and he was besieged for fifty-one days by 
increased to ten thousand men who 
furious attack. But Clive was resolute 
red and drove them back. He soon 
elp and succeeded later in defeating 
in destroying largely the extraordinary 
power which Dupleix had built up in this part of India. 
The Battle of Plassey. — Returning to England in 
1750 on account of broken health, Clive was received 
with honor and treated as the hero of India. A few 
years later upon returning to India with restored 
health he was soon called upon to lead a small army 
against a native prince in Bengal who had committed 
a great crime against the English merchants by throw- 
ing a company of one hundred and forty-six into the 
“Black Hole” at Calcutta, where most of them perished, 
In the battle of Plassey which soon followed Clive, in

command of an army of three thousand men, only nine 
hundred of whom were British soldiers, defeated and 
scattered a great army of thirty thousand which had 
been brought against him by the Nabob of Bengal. 
This was followed by later victories which laid the 
foundations of British power in India and gave Clive 
great repute. 
Warren Hastings. — A second great governor and 
ruler sent by the East India Company to India was 
Warren Hastings. In the period from 1773 to 1785 he 
subdued a number of Indian princes and extended the 
British power over northern and central India. 
Cornwallis as Governor General. — All these early 
conquests were made under the direction of the East 
India Company, a body of British merchants in trade. 
Just after the close of the Revolutionary War the Brit- 
ish Government assumed control of the affairs of the 
East India Company and appointed a Governor Gen- 
eral to manage the political affairs of the colony, leaving 
the company the right to direct trade and commerce. 
Lord Cornwallis, who surrendered a British army at 
Yorktown, was the first Governor General of India, 
and he also enlarged the British influence by extending 
it into other provinces. For a long time the English 
continued to rule the vast populations of this Indian 
Empire and to bring new states under their control. 
While the English rulers introduced many improve- 
ments and administered justice better than the native 
princes, still there had been many injustices and wrong 
dealings on the part of the English, and there was a 
growing desire among the natives to throw off the 
British yoke.

utiny.— In 1857 this feeling broke 
prising, known as the Indian Mutiny 
or Sepoy Rebellion. Cruel massacres were perpetrated 
against the captured English, even against women and 
children. For a time it seemed as if the whole of India 
was casting off the foreign rulers. But the small forces 
of British Ao in different cities bravely held their 
ground; they defeated the native troops in many bat-

duced a system of courts of law based on English prac- 
tice but adapted to Indian customs. In this way a 
greatly improved method of administering justice 
among all the people was carried out. An extensive 
system of railroads has been built which has vastly 
improved the distribution of products. An elaborate 
scheme for id tvting great irrigation projects has 
been put in aie along the large rivers which has

brought more than 50,000,000 acres of land under reg- 
ular cultivation and thus largely prevented the dis- 
tressing famines which were formerly common in India. 
The great colony. — India is the greatest colony 
that any nation has ever ruled from a distance. In 
more recent times the English have been granting the 
people of India more freedom and a greater share in the 
management of their own affairs. For nearly a hun- 
dred and seventy years since the days of Clive, England 
has steadily extended and increased her power and 
influence in this most populous and wealthy of all 
provinces. During the World War India not only 
failed to take advantage of the situation to rise against 
England but even sent native armies into Europe to 
support the cause of England against her enemies. 
India is known as a crown colony because its gov- 
ernment and administration are in the hands of the 
English. The people of India have not yet been granted 
self-government. It is indeed a marvelous thing that 
a hundred thousand English have long exercised au- 
thority over a nation of 300,000,000 people. 
South African colonies. — South Africa at Cape 
Town was settled first by the Dutch in 1650 and the 
district about the Cape was occupied by Dutch farmers 
till 1795 when the fort was captured by the British. 
Having been given back to the Dutch it was recap- 
tured during a war with Holland in 1806 and finally 
secured to England by a payment of thirty million 
dollars to Holland. 
The British Government was doubly desirous of 
securing this territory because it was the most impor- 
tant station on the old route between England and her
-P-A-G-E-328
    320 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
great possessions in India. Before the Suez Canal 
was built England greatly needed Cape Town as a 
naval station. Cape Town and settlement formed the 
best vantage ground from which to extend the power of 
England over South Africa. For a long time it was 
difficult to persuade Englishmen to settle in South 
Africa, and this colony remained for many years poorly 
developed. But in 1870 the diamond fields were opened 
up, and Englishmen flocked into Africa by way of Cape 
Town. England has had no end of serious troubles 
in South Africa with the Dutch Boers, with the fierce 
tribe of Kaffirs, with the Zulu tribes, and lastly with the 
South African Republic, called the “Transvaal.” But 
she has gradually extended her domains northward 
against all opposition. 
Convict settlements. — Australia, England’s next 
most important: colony in the East, has a wholly differ- 
ent history. It was first explored by Captain Cook in 
1769-70. Its early settlement was by a convict class. 
It was so remote that the British Government decided 
to deport its prisoners taken from the jails to these 
far-away shores, where they were formed into penal 
settlements. For many years these unfortunates 
were transported to those distant settlements at the 
rate of two thousand to three thousand per year. 
Once there, they were under military control and were 
compelled to work to earn their food and other sup- 
plies. They suffered great hardships and were much 
abused by the soldiers who guarded them. Before 
1836 it is estimated that one hundred and three thou- 
sand convicts had been transported by England to 
Australia and Tasmania. And in 1840 there were 
|
-P-A-G-E-329
REMARKS ON ORGANIZATION 321 
forty thousand of these convicts living in Australia — 
more than half the population of the country at that 
time. 
Rapid growth and improvement. — The introduc- 
tion of sheep and the production of a fine quality of 
wool for export to England encouraged immigration. 
Cheap land also attracted settlers. The convicts were 
kept busy building roads and as servants to the farmers. 
In 1851 gold was discovered and people flocked to 
South Australia from all parts of the world. In afew 
years Melbourne had a population of two hundred 
thousand. Between the years 1850 and 1865 seven 
hundred sixty-one thousand people came to Australia, 
mostly of the English-speaking classes. Many of 
these were adventurers and a period of disorder fol- 
lowed. But the gold fever soon subsided, and people, 
turned more to the settled occupations of farming, 
stock raising, and commerce. Coal, copper, and silver 
were discovered in other parts of the country. Sugar 
and cotton plantations were developed in the warmer 
parts of Australia in the northeast. An excellent 
system of schools was established. Roads were built, 
and a railroad system to connect the colonies was begun. 
A confederation of states.— As population and 
settlements increased, the different states began to 
come closer to each other and to work together for 
common interests. They began even to talk of a 
confederation of the Australian states under one general 
control. From 1852 on, the sentiment grew more 
favorable to the confederation of the colonies under 
one government and various conventions were held to 
devise a plan of union. A constitution similar to that
-P-A-G-E-330
  322 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
of the United States was worked out and adopted in 
1900. This government which unites all the states of 
Australia into a federal union has a legislature of two 
houses elected by the people, a judiciary, and a Gov- 
ernor General appointed by the Crown. 
The government of Australia is like that of Canada 
which is also a federation of states with independence 
in all local and purely Canadian affairs. Quite re- 
cently the South African colonies have formed a similar 
union of federated states which in time seems destined 
to grow into a powerful nation. 
Three federal states. — Among the English colonies, 
therefore, there have developed three great federal 
states, Canada, Australia, and South Africa, all based 
upon an organization of government similar to that 
of the United States. New Zealand also is a free, self- 
governing state of Englishmen. 
Crown colonies. — Nearly all the other colonies of 
England, like India, are crown colonies, that is, con- 
trolled directly by the government of England and 
without independent, law-making assemblies of their 
own choice. The English Parliament legislates for the 
crown colonies, such as India, the Sudan, Jamaica, and 
other islands in the West Indies and East Indies. The 
crown colonies are peopled by alien races not speaking 
the English tongue and not yet sufficiently developed 
to be fully self-governing. 
The Mediterranean route to India.— With the 
building of the Suez Canal in 1869 a new and much 
shorter route to India was provided. Because of her 
great Colonial possessions in the East — India, Singa- 
pore, Hongkong, and the islands, Australia and New   
 
-P-A-G-E-331
  REMARKS ON ORGANIZATION 323 
Zealand — England found it most essential that she 
should control this Mediterranean route. Although 
the Canal was built by a French company, England 
bought a controlling interest in it and even secured a 
dominant influence in Egypt so as to better guard the 
Canal. By establishing great fortresses and coaling 
stations at Gibraltar, Malta, and Aden, this short route 
to India became a grand highway of English commerce 
and was powerfully guarded as an essential part of 
England’s Colonial system. 
Island colonies. — At various times, partly by wars 
with European states, England has gained possession 
of important islands in the East Indies, for example, 
Ceylon, parts of Borneo, and New Guinea; the Solomon 
and Fiji Islands; in the West Indies, Jamaica and the 
Windward group; in the Atlantic, the Falklands, St. 
Helena, the Bahamas, and the Bermudas; in the Pacific, 
several smaller groups. 
In Africa and Asia, England has enlarged her terri- 
tories by gradually increasing her “spheres of influ- 
ence,” as in the Sudan, and South Africa. 
In these various ways the British Empire has grown 
till it comprises a land area of more than eleven million 
square miles or about one fifth of the total land area of 
the world. Much of this lies in the temperate zones and 
in the more habitable parts of the earth where the 
stronger races develop. 
The United States was for one hundred and fifty 
years a part of the British Colonial system, but the 
American Revolution broke the connection with Eng- 
land. As soon as the colonies became established in 
a new nation, the United States at once started out on 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
    324 HOW TO iloidtbi THE CURRICULUM 
its own course in territorial expansion, thus developing 
into a great world power. 
In the last four centuries the growth in numbers of 
the English-speaking races has had a remarkable de- 
velopment, partly by the increase of population in the 
British Isles, partly in the English colonies, and even 
more in the United States. 
England has been the chief colonizing nation of mod- 
ern times and has spread Anglo-Saxon civilization and 
speech through the best parts of the world. 
Spain’s colonies. —In the first large schemes of 
colonization and conquest which followed the discov- 
eries of Columbus and Magellan, Spain took the lead 
and gained possession of some of the finest portions of 
the world. By the conquests of the Spaniards in the 
West Indies, in Mexico, and in Peru, Spain quickly 
extended her rule over a large portion of South America 
and of the southern and western portions of North 
America. She gained also considerable possessions in 
the East Indies. 
Spain’s harsh rule and the loss of her colonies. — 
In all her colonizing schemes, however, Spain was a 
brutal conqueror, sacrificing everything to the desire 
for gold and plunder, instead of becoming a colonizer 
desirous of settling and developing these new countries. 
Spain ruled her colonies harshly and taxed them heavily 
for her own enrichment with very little regard for the 
welfare of the subject natives or even of the Spanish 
settlers. In consequence she soon lost a good share of 
her Colonial possessions. Mexico and the South Ameri- 
can states revolted from Spain and, after some fifteen 
years of varying struggles with Spanish soldiers, by 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  REMARKS ON ORGANIZATION 325 
1826 had gained independence and expelled the Spanish 
authority from all the states of North and South Amer- 
ica. Spain did not seem to learn much by experience 
and continued her harsh rule in the West Indies which 
brought on a war with the United States and resulted 
in the loss of Cuba and the Philippines. To-day Spain 
rules over a few small islands and some little territory 
in Africa but has long ceased to figure as one of the 
great colonizing nations. 
Portugal’s colonies. — Portugal like Spain at one 
time had extensive Colonial possessions. In 1540 the 
Portuguese, who were the first to explore the west and 
east coasts of Africa, had a continuous line of posses- 
sions along both shores of Africa, on the mainland of 
India, and in islands of the East Indian seas. They 
had gained full control of the commerce of the East 
Indies, which at that time was the richest in the world, 
and they brought back immense wealth from their 
commercial and military expeditions, The Portu- 
guese navigators and soldiers of that time were brave 
and reckless adventurers, and the nations of the East 
with their riches of gold, diamonds, spices, silks, and 
other fine fabrics fell an easy prey to them. Later they 
also gained and held for many years Brazil, the largest 
of the South American states. But Portugal did not 
long maintain this leadership. Like the Spaniards the 
Portuguese were harsh conquerors and plunderers, not 
wise rulers of conquered races. At present Portugal 
still keeps two large territories on the east and west 
coasts of Africa and a few islands in the Atlantic and 
in the East Indies, but her vast possessions, like those 
of Spain, passed out of her hands.
-P-A-G-E-334
  326 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
Other Colonial systems. — Next to England Holland 
has been most successful in gaining and holding impor- 
tant Colonial possessions, especially among the islands 
of the East Indies, as Java. 
France also was one of the great colonizing nations, 
holding at one time the greater part of North America. 
At present France has extensive possessions in the 
north and west of Africa and in the borders of India 
and China. 
Since Germany in the last forty years has come into 
prominent leadership in Europe, she has also tried to 
secure a hold upon important colonies. But Germany 
started too late in the race for colonies and secured only 
a few territories on the east and west coasts of Africa 
and a few islands in the Pacific, which were recently 
lost again. 
Europe the source of colonization. — This study of 
the Colonial development of the European states since 
the times of Columbus shows that, while Europe is the 
smallest. of the continents, the energetic European 
states during the last four hundred years have explored 
all the other continents, have sent out settlers to col- 
onize the best parts of North and South America, Aus- 
tralia, and Africa, and have taken possession of and 
brought under their control many millions of the native 
races of these foreign lands. The great commercial 
water routes to all parts of the earth have been laid 
out by Europeans, and the commerce of the world to- 
day is carried almost entirely in the ships and under 
the control of Europeans. 
Comparison of Colonial empires. — This somewhat 
extensive treatment of the British Colonial system 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
  REMARKS ON ORGANIZATION 327 
followed by a brief survey of the colonies of Spain and 
of other countries lays the basis for a profitable series 
of comparisons, first, between American expansion and 
British colonization; second, between England’s own 
colonies showing remarkable variety and contrast; and 
third, between the English colonizing system and that 
of Spain and of other countries of Europe. The striking 
contrast between England’s growth and Spain’s de- 
cline in Colonial possessions, with the reasons that may 
be assigned for the difference, may set children to 
thinking on some very fundamental problems. Eng- 
land’s wars of conquest in India and South Africa may 
be profitably compared with our own wars against the 
American Indians and with Mexico. They are found 
to be very similar problems. Why does England allow 
practical independence and self-government in Canada 
and Australia and yet impose her own laws upon India? 
In connection with the deporting of convicts to Aus- 
tralia it may be recalled that shiploads of criminals 
were sent to Virginia in the early days and of debtors to 
Georgia, while by way of contrast the Puritans and 
Quakers were of a very strictly moral and religious order. 
Geographical and historical expansion.— Such a 
studious and later comparative inquiry into the Colonial 
systems developed by the leading nations of Europe in 
the last four hundred years is a gradual opening out of 
world geography by following the very paths traveled 
by explorers and colonizers. A more vivid and life- 
like portrayal of lands and people, of climates and 
products, and of world relations would not be possible. 
The great traffic routes by sea and land are seen in 
their beginnings and are laid out along ocean ways

which commerce and travel have been following these 
hundreds of years till now. This historical develop- 
ment of geography is profoundly significant as an in- 
terpretation of the most powerful influences that have 
been at work shaping our world as it is to-day. History 
and geography move along together in absolute inter- 
dependence, while natural science and mathematics 
have been coéperative with such leading studies in this 
marvelous game of life. 
A fourth great unit of study — the territorial settle- 
ments following the World War. — In concluding this 
series of great units of study, continuous in their de- 
velopment through the grades, we have one large topic 
still to mention which is the culmination of the series; 
namely, the redistribution of territories at the con- 
clusion of the recent World War. This tearing down 
of old nationalities and setting up new states, the dis- 
tribution among the Allies of conquered provinces, the 
determination of mandates, and the readjustments of 
territorial boundaries are perceived to be direct con- 
tinuations of the powerful efforts at expansion which 
have marked the fundamental drift among energetic 
modern nations. This great topic comes last because it 
is last, because we can get little understanding of it with- 
out a knowledge of powerful colonization movements 
which have preceded it and have led up to it. The 
strong drift of modern nations toward territorial ex- 
pansion and colonization, in view of the commercial 
and industrial advantages that spring from such im- 
perial expansion, furnishes basal motivation for great 
national impulses and enterprises and offers an illu- 
minating chapter in modern history.

CHAPTER XI 
A SUGGESTED CURRICULUM 
The following outline of large teaching units covers 
the fields of geography, history, science, and literature. 
This outline of a curriculum compasses mainly five 
grades, from the fourth through the eighth. A short 
preliminary list is given also for primary grades, but 
the plan for the primary grades is not here worked 
out in full. ~The large topics start strongly in the 
fourth grade and are continued through the eighth. 
About a dozen weighty topics — typical life projects 
— are suggested for each study in each of the five 
grades (fourth to eighth inclusive). 
In the geography forty or more out of the sixty large 
units have been worked out and put in print and are 
included in the reference lists. Most of the remaining 
twenty have also been developed and tried out in the 
classroom but have not been printed for general use. 
In history about half of the topics have been written 
up and put in print — especially the history stories 
and topics of the fourth and fifth grades. In the seventh 
and eighth grades historical books and materials are 
now available which contain a fuller discussion of these 
topics, but the teacher would need access to a moderate 
library to carry out this plan under present conditions. 
Where departmental teaching is carried on in the sixth, 
331
-P-A-G-E-340
332 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
seventh, and eighth grades, such a plan of dealing with 
large topics would be very appropriate. 
The list of selections in literature is made up of 
complete stories, poems, and literary products now in 
common use. For some years teachers have been 
treating these subjects as literary wholes. It is sug- 
gested that by selecting fundamental types in literature 
each of these may become a center around which to 
group kindred selections for comparison. The basal or 
typical idea in a literary selection would need to be 
brought out in its full setting and then made the basis 
of @ series of comparisons with other kindred and con- 
trasted selections. 
The selected science topics are also chosen with the 
idea of giving to each an elaborate treatment and of 
then working out comparisons with kindred topics so 
as to give a wider scope to the whole project. A few of 
these science topics have been tried out and are in 
printed form, but most of them would require study 
and elaboration by the teacher from special supple- 
mentary books dealing with science topics. It would 
be better to develop a few of these topics elaborately as 
types than to scatter broadly over the wide fields of 
science. We need more of these special subjects 
fully worked out and thus made available for teachers’ 
us 
(ia accordance with this plan of handling twelve or 
ss topics a year in each study one of these units or 
teaching projects would require from two to four weeks 
of study. At the rate of five lessons a week (from 
thirty to forty minutes each) this would allow from ten 
to twenty lessons to each large unit. This is not too
-P-A-G-E-341
A SUGGESTED CURRICULUM 333 
much time for the complete and thorough treatment 
of such large topics. This more expanded treatment 
of subjects is seen in the illustrative examples of type 
studies already presented. It may cause some surprise, 
however, to note that the second stage of expansion 
through numerous comparisons is really much more 
extensive than is properly indicated by these examples. 
In fact it is difficult to reveal the meaning of this varied 
thinking process except in the classroom. This expan- 
sive development of an idea into a national or world 
scope requires a large and unexpected expenditure of 
time. The full meaning of a type study is not brought 
to light until we discover a whole series of these wide- 
reaching relations which are now commonly overlooked. 
In just such ways we find out the comprehensive 
organizing power of a liberal idea and how it happens 
that a few such big topics bring together and organize 
the essentials of a course of study. 
The main organization of the curriculum must center 
about these thought studies. The formal studies, 
reading, writing, and spelling, are in the process of ad- 
justing themselves to these central content subjects. 
The tributary essential arts are coming to support this 
central plan of organization. The outlines of these 
formal studies and of arithmetic will not differ es- 
sentially from the courses now in vogue. 
The typical projects developed in the courses in the 
industrial arts and in the household arts will fit suitably 
into this curriculum of large units. In fact these arts 
furnish the best simple, objective examples we have of 
typical life projects which are complete units of in- 
telligent design and construction. Such an outline  
-P-A-G-E-342
  334 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
course is given in the book, “Teaching of Industrial 
Arts in the Elementary School,” published by The Mac- 
millan Company. 
The marked feature of the following course of study 
is its brevity, but the striking thing about each topic 
named is the wide extent of knowledge it reaches out for 
and organizes. The purpose of this brief outline is to 
simplify and at the same time enrich the study of these 
subjects in the school. This is accomplished, first, by 
omitting a large number of minor topics, and, second, 
by expanding the large topics into a full descriptive 
treatment. 
The secret of success lies in this process of choosing 
out a few of the most important centers and types — a 
select few of the best history, geographic, or literary 
units — and of enlarging them to such an extent as to 
draw out their full educative value. We propose to 
organize around these centers a far stronger body of 
knowledge than children can get from a condensed and 
somewhat scrappy treatment of many topics. These 
big topics are prominently set forth in the outline, and 
a few of the main headings are suggested so as to give 
an inkling of the richness that lies behind. Each of 
these important units has coiled up within it a germinal 
idea which is its life principle, and to bring this out 
in full strength requires an elaborate treatment. The 
idea must have opportunity to germinate and grow 
and expand on a large scale, else it can never exhibit 
its true value. 
We wish to avoid the foolish waste of spreading out 
over a multitude of subjects, large and small. An in- 
tensive treatment of a limited number of standard
-P-A-G-E-343
A SUGGESTED CURRICULUM 335 
units will give a comprehensive and well-connected 
survey of a whole school study and incidentally throw 
an important light upon a group of other studies. 
In this course of study, also, there is a well-devised 
continuity of thought running through the entire plan 
from the third and fourth grade to the eighth. A few 
lines of thought are kept steadily developing from 
grade to grade on the basis of types. For example, in 
geography there is a series on rivers, a series on cities, 
on traffic routes, on manufacturing industries, on agri- 
cultural topics, on physiographic units. In history, 
the steady growth of ideas and institutions is a com- 
manding characteristic. In every case later topics 
build on the base furnished by those types preceding 
them in the grades, and the later topics review those 
preceding by comparison. There are no static, formal 
reviews of topics previously studied. The older types 
furnish standards of measure upon which to interpret 
and estimate the worth of the new. This is one form 
of review that necessitates real thinking and combines 
the new with the old by a steady process of growth. 
How do these important units of study relate them- 
selves to the textbooks in common use? Teachers 
have been trying to find out what are the centrally 
important topics among the greater number presented 
in the books. This course will enable them to discover 
these centers and to focus attention upon them. It is 
admitted on all sides that a fuller treatment is re- 
quired of these central topics. The references given 
in each grade are to the special pamphlets and books 
which furnish this enlarged treatment of typical units, 
A large number of these monographs on special topics 
   
-P-A-G-E-344
  336 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM 
have been worked out and printed and are now within 
the reach of teachers and can even be put into the 
hands of children. These pamphlets can be used in 
connection with any of the regular geography texts as 
a direct means of enriching and organizing the main 
subjects of study. There is an almost universal de- 
mand in the schools for larger and richer supplemen- 
tary materials with which to reénforce the brief state- 
ments of the regular textbooks. 
In conclusion we may say that the superiority for 
educative purposes of these controlling units of thought, 
intensively studied, over the brief and shallow treat- 
ment of numerous smaller topics is generally acknowl- 
edged. Even the textbooks are beginning to show a 
preference for larger topics and richer treatment. The 
present need of the schools is a marked simplification 
and an expansive enrichment of the main subjects of 
study. This will give children the right impulse, put 
classroom method on a stronger basis, and make the 
course of study as a whole progressive and dynamic in 
its influence.

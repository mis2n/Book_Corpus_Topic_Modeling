  AUTHORS’ PREFACE 
To Professor Hill we owe the suggestion of a curriculum 
worked out in terms of behavior. It was at her suggestion , 
that we compiled this curriculum, which is the outgrowth 
of a number of years of experience and experiment under her 
direction in the Horace Mann Kindergarten and First Grade. 
Professor Hill has given her continued support and inspira- 
tion throughout the undertaking. 
We also thank Miriam Cragin, Bess V. Cunningham, 
Janet S. McCastline, Grace A. Taylor, and George P. Conard 
for help in the preparation of the curriculum.

INTRODUCTION 
At last the young child seems to be coming into his legiti- 
mate inheritance of scientific investigation and education. 
Up to the present time no period has been so neglected as 
that of childhood. It has been left to drift with the tide of 
ignorance and chance in physical, mental, and moral care. 
But to-day the situation is changing. A 
The first reformers to approach this problem from the 
scientific angle were physicians and nurses. Through their 
continued attack on the ignorance and neglect in the physical 
care of young children, they have succeeded in awakening 
the public to the importance of health conditions in early 
life, and have cut both mortality and morbidity to a remark- 
able degree. As a consequence, thousands of little children 
who, a quarter of a century ago, were doomed to a premature 
death, now survive to lives of health and usefulness. This 
health propaganda which has been so intelligently conducted 
by child specialists, both in medicine and nursing, is raising 
the level of physical care given infants and young children in 
the home and in the school. Laudable as this movement is, 
however, it must be followed by an equally vigilant investiga- 
tion of all those conditions which make for mental and 
emotional health, or the little lives may be saved to an ex- 
istence not worth the living. Surely, “life is more than meat 
and the body than raiment,” even in infancy and early child- 
hood. The mental and emotional life are dawning from the 
very beginning and are worthy of as much respect as the body,

with its more tangible and insistent demands. When educa- 
tors manifest a reverence for the dawning mental life compara- 
ble to the respectful study and attention now bestowed by 
physicians on the physical life of young children, the profes- 
sion of teaching may hope to rank with that of modern medi- 
cine. Fortunately for the young child, as well as for society, 
we have many evidences of a growing public appreciation of 
the effects of these early mental and emotional states upon 
later sanity, progress, and efficiency in the school and in life. 
Several of our largest American universities now offer either 
scientific or research courses on the nature and care of the 
pre-kindergarten and the pre-school child, and all of our teach- 
ers colleges have well-equipped departments of kindergarten 
and primary education. Among the universities offering re- 
search courses on the pre-school child are Johns Hopkins, 
Yale, Harvard, the University of Iowa, and Columbia. When 
the results of these researches are taken advantage of by 
superintendents, supervisors, and principals of schools, as well 
as by teachers of primary, kindergarten, and nursery schools, 
we may hope to have a public education as efficient in the 
regulation and development of the processes of mental growth 
as modern medicine has become in its conservation and con- 
trol of physical life. 
Another evidence of the growing appreciation of the edu- 
cational possibilities of early childhood is manifested in the 
opportunities being provided by our universities for the train- 
ing of teachers of early childhood. In this day and genera- 
tion it is perfectly possible for teachers of nursery schools, 
kindergarten, and primary schools to receive training for their 
professions equal to that offered for teachers of high schools 
and colleges. If future teachers in this field do not measure

up to teachers in higher education, it will not be for want 
of opportunities for equal professional preparation. 
Funds for investigation and research are now being be- 
stowed upon universities for the establishment of laboratories 
serving as experimental nurseries and kindergartens. Doc- 
tor John Watson says: “In so far as I have learned anything 
from experiments on infants and young children, they show, 
first, that parents, and second, that early grade teachers, 
equally must share the responsibility for making or marring 
the emotional life of the average child. We can only gradually 
educate the general run of parents, but we can more rapidly 
improve matters by making the position of the early grade 
teacher the most desirable and best paid one in our schools. 
When this has been done, we must next secure exceptional 
teachers for these grades. . . . We should like to see these 
early grades given over to students of child psychology— 
men and women who have specialized in psychology and 
psychopathology.” 
Teachers College has, from its earliest history, opened its 
doors to the teachers of young children, making it possible 
for those who wish to specialize in this field to approximate 
the same standards of efficiency as those demanded in ele- 
mentary and high schools. From the very beginning it had 
a kindergarten department, which was the first to become a 
part of a university scheme of education. Opportunities for 
experiment and better educational procedure in the kinder- 
garten were given encouragement and appreciation, and as 
each experiment culminated on a higher level of teaching, an 
effort has been made to circulate the results in the teaching 
profession, so that the benefits might lift the standards of 
teaching of young children in this country and abroad. This
-P-A-G-E-10

department would prove itself unworthy of this generous sup- 
port should it to-day fail to turn over to others the benefits 
of its opportunities. 
For this reason we are now preparing a series of mono- 
graphs for teachers and for mothers of young children, hoping 
to issue them at a sufficiently moderate price to get them 
into the hands of classroom teachers and in the home. The 
first of this series is this curriculum. Though now pre- 
sented to the public for the first time, it is the culmination 
of many years of study and experiment. All members of 
the department, instructors and students, have co-operated 
in working out a practice based upon the principles under- 
lying this curriculum, but the present form is the work of the 
special committee whose names appear as authors. Several 
members of this committee have served as instructors in this 
department for many years, thus co-operating with the di- 
rector, not only in this experiment but in those preceding 
experiments described below out of which this curriculum 
has grown. While the present form is tentative and issued 
to stimulate further experiment, study, and criticism, it is 
thought best to publish it at once, in response to the oft-re- 
peated requests for literature covering the investigations in 
the kindergarten and first grade of this department. 
As early as 1905 Teachers College made it possible for an 
experiment to be initiated in the kindergarten of the Speyer 
School with children from three or four to six years of age. 
The group with which this was tried was in charge of Miss 
Luella A. Palmer, Director of the public school kindergartens 
of Greater New York, who was at that time a graduate student 
in this department. The experiment started in 1905 was one 
of the earliest attempts in any field of education to apply
-P-A-G-E-11
INTRODUCTION xi 
the principles of democracy to school organization. To pro- 
vide conditions suitable for training in the beginnings of self- 
government, wide opportunities were offered the children for 
learning from each other, through their own experience, em- 
phasis being laid upon the initiation and execution of their 
own purposes and plans. While this 1905 experiment was 
timid as compared with the later experiments which grew 
out of it, choices and decisions were turned over to the chil- 
dren whenever possible to do so without waste of time and 
effort. A conscious attempt was also made to work out a 
technique of teaching, built upon a new conception of the 
teacher as a guide rather than as a dictator. The teacher was 
conceived of as the mature member of a social group of im- 
mature beings, in which her wider experience, wiser judgment, 
greater knowledge and technique were to be at the disposal of 
the children, when she or they felt the need of adult direction. 
Few observers were interested, since the procedure seemed 
radical in the extreme, as compared with the conservative 
and formal kindergartens and first grades of the day. For 
this reason, it was deemed advisable to defer the continuation 
of this venture until 1915, when better conditions were af- 
forded in the kindergarten and playground of the Horace 
Mann School. Much wider interest was awakened by this 
second attempt. This increased interest was manifested in 
a request, coming from both parents and school, for the con- 
tinuation of this type of organization in the first grade. To 
promote its success, one of the teachers, who had participated 
in the previous experiment in the kindergarten, was selected 
to carry on similar work with the same group of children in 
the first grade. 
The second trial of this experiment found us far more 
   
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii INTRODUCTION 
courageous, as the 1905 attempt had convinced us that even 
young children were far more capable of learning self-govern- 
ment than we had dreamed. One of the most marked re- 
sults of these opportunities for learning self-direction was 
the decreasing necessity for teacher-administered discipline 
and punishment. Not only those teachers who participated, 
but the majority of those who observed consecutively, were 
convinced that a social organization based upon wisely di- 
rected liberty was the only medium in which habits of self- 
direction and social co-operation could be established. In 
this way the school served as a laboratory of democracy, in 
which the technique of democratic citizenship could be gradu- 
ally acquired. 
Even in 1915, however, this torm of social organization im- 
pressed the more conservative pedagogical minds as radical 
and wasteful. In order, therefore, to justify the results of 
such training through some more convincing evidence than 
the mere enthusiasm of those who were conducting the ex- 
periment, it was realized that some method of recording daily 
work must be devised. Up to this time few systematic efforts 
had been made to record the progress of young children. 
With no precedent at our disposal, we decided to appoint 
special observers to make records of what they considered 
typical outcomes in the individual and social behavior of the 
group. These were listed as carefully as the scientific train- 
ing of teachers at that time permitted, and the results were 
tabulated. The observers, disagreeing in minor details, unan- 
imously agreed that this freer organization offered condi- 
tions in which the children learned initiative, independence, 
perseverance, concentration, and social co-operation such as 
the old order had never provided. 
It was then discovered that these records of the children’s
-P-A-G-E-13
  INTRODUCTION xiii 
progress served, not only as a statement of what had actually 
transpired, but as standards of possible attainment through 
the more freely organized work and play. 
Some of the captions used in this early record sheet under 
which we classified the attainments of the children were: 
ability to initiate purposes and plans, ability to persevere 
or “stick to one’s job” in spite of difficulties, ability to lead 
and follow intelligently, ability to work alone or in a group, 
ability to know when one needs help and when and where 
such help is to be secured, ability to give fair criticism to self 
and others and finally to profit by such criticism. 
This method of recording children’s progress, improved in 
form from year to year, was used from 1915 to 1921. At this 
juncture the need for the criticism and direction of a highly 
trained psychologist was recognized. The difficulty lay in 
finding an expert willing to do pioneer work in the psychology 
of these early years. When criticism was asked, psychologists 
invariably pointed out that little help could be given, because 
the captions under which the records were made dealt almost 
exclusively with non-measurable qualities, those not suf- 
ficiently objective to induce psychologists to attempt to scale 
or measure them. While the qualities, as such, were approved 
and acknowledged as of unquestioned worth, they were too 
vague, too indefinite, to warrant attempts at scientific mea- 
surement. It was agreed that some more objective outcomes 
must be found before further attempts could be made to 
measure the progress of young children. 
At this stage of the experiment, the department secured 
the services of Doctor Agnes Rogers, who directed us in the 
process of breaking up the captions of our previous records 
into the more specific abilities and habits involved. 
After working with some three or four hundred leaders in
-P-A-G-E-14
xiv INTRODUCTION 
kindergarten and primary education, specific habits which 
the majority agreed that young children should form were 
listed and a tentative “Habit Inventory” was published.* 
This was used as the basis of further study and experiment, 
not only in the kindergarten and first grade of the Horace 
Mann School, but with groups of children under the direction 
of the teachers co-operating with Doctor Rogers in the in- 
ventory and habit scale. 
As this inventory was used, the observers noted, not only 
the obvious improvement and acceleration of habit-forma- 
tion with the children, but also that the supervisors and class- 
room teachers began to think of all instruction in terms of 
desirable changes in thought, feeling, or conduct; in other 
words, in terms of changed behavior due to a changed nervous 
system. As was but natural, changes in behavior were ap- 
preciated first in the realm of moral and social conduct. But 
as the study proceeded, the conception of behavior grew to 
include, not only those technical activities listed as conduct, 
but all those changes in thought and feeling, directly or in- 
directly, immediately or remotely, leading to and influencing 
behavior. 
In order to clarify our own thinking in the use of psycho- 
logical terms and in listing these changes in the child’s be- 
havior, whether in the realm of thought and feeling, in appre- 
ciation, attitudes, and ideals, or in the more overt modifica- 
tions in conduct, some definition of the technical differences 
in these phenomena had to be agreed upon. Recourse was 
had to Doctor Edward L. Thorndike’s writings and the fol- 
lowing conception of behavior accepted: 
“T use it to refer to those activities of thought, feeling, 
*A Tentative Inventory of Habits: Bureau of Publications, Teachers College. 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  INTRODUCTION xv 
and conduct in the broadest sense which an animal—here, 
man—exhibits, which are omitted from discussion by the 
physics, chemistry, and ordinary psychology of to-day, and 
which are referred by popular usage to intellect, character, 
skill, and temperament. Behavior, then, is not contrasted 
with, but exclusive of, conscious life.” 
Two results of accepting this point of view followed: first, 
all outward evidences of ability to appreciate the beauty of 
music, art, or literature were considered of too great im- 
ortance to omit in our records of desirable changes; second, 
subject-matter, as such, was thought of in terms of activities 
nd experiences leading to desirable changes in thought and 
eeling, or in conduct. As a consequence, instead of making 
ur “Habit Inventory” an appendix to the curriculum. then 
use with its subject-matter, knowledge and technique, we 
ound ourselves gradually transforming the curriculum, as 
whole, by applying the principles of habit formation to all 
f the school subjects. Thus the proper conduct of the three 
’s or the correct technique of the fine and industrial arts be- 
ame as evident as the so-called moral or social conduct. 
Fach school subject was studied from the viewpoint of the 
lesirable improvements in thought, feeling, and conduct 
hich might thereby be stimulated and established in habits 
if behavior. Thus the activities of each subject were listed 
one column; opposite were listed the desired changes which 
ould grow out of these activities. 
This has proved a difficult task for laymen to attempt, 
d it has been a project requiring unremitting labor for many 
onths on the part of the department, as a whole, and the 
mmittee in particular. Faulty though this first presenta- 
n may be, it has at least set up definite aims and objectives        
       
   
   
         
           
      
-P-A-G-E-16
  xvi INTRODUCTION 
to the teachers of young children, laying the emphasis, not 
on knowledge or appreciation, as such, but on desirable 
changes or improvements in these—in the changed nervous 
system which leads to habits of behavior, finally culminating 
in character. 
This step forward from a ‘Habit Inventory” at large to 
the study of each aspect of the curriculum, not as a formal 
school subject, but as a social situation rich in activities and 
experiences leading to the formation of desirable habits, 
avoids a danger which we had realized from the first; that is, 
of teaching habits out of their organic relation to situations. 
From the first we had feared that habits might be taugh 
arbitrarily, separated from social situations which give ris 
to the necessity for their formation. When conduct is ac 
quired in a social situation, it not only takes on meaning bu’ 
is likely to be associated in the mind of the child with a sen: 
of satisfaction or pleasure. For this reason, the child, as we 
as the teacher, must be helped to a realization of the neces. 
sity for the conduct desired. This possibility is increased i 
the conduct set as the objective is acquired in experience 
in a situation, the conduct itself serving, not only as an ai 
but as a desirable and economical solution of the proble 
involved in the experience. 
When the child, as well as the teacher, is thus made co 
scious of the acquired conduct as a happy means of solvin; 
individual or group problems, the result is associated wi 
satisfaction. It is a psychological law that any activity whi 
is not associated with a sense of satisfaction may be lost. I 
other words, it is not likely to be repeated except when di 
tated by external authority. The economy of learning co! 
duct in experience may be illustrated with any habit select      
    
   
    
    
   
   
    
   
    
-P-A-G-E-17
  INTRODUCTION xvii 
from the “Habit Inventory”; for example, one of the habits 
listed was the proper technique or conduct of crossing the 
street, a habit of tremendous importance in safeguarding the 
lives of little children in large cities. In the curricula of the 
past, the knowledge and conduct involved in this habit would 
find no place; or, if considered worthy of a place in the curricu- 
lum, it would have been presented to the child as a matter of 
information, leaving the application to mere chance. In this 
curriculum, however, this desirable conduct is not presented 
as unapplied knowledge, or taught out of the experience which 
calls for it. The school excursion would be selected as the 
best social situation for teaching the child “Safety First.” 
Here is the medium in which this particular knowledge, ideal 
or conduct can be learned with the minimum of time and 
effort on the part of both teacher and child. 
In making this curriculum one group of teachers started 
with the subject or situation, listing the inherent activities 
and conducts desired; the other group approached from the 
standpoint of the specific habit of conduct listed in the in- 
ventory, searching for the natural situations in which to set 
the habit to be formed. Thus, whether one started with the 
inventory or with the situation, the outward result was the 
same; but in school practice it makes a vast difference whether 
the teacher views a habit as something to be taught at any 
time, or under any conditions, or as a form of activity organi- 
cally related to an experience or situation in which the raison 
@étre for learning arises. 
No attempt is here made to present a curriculum as a 
whole, with the specific story to be told or read, the song to 
be sung, the game to be played, etc. Instead, an effort has 
been made to set up the different objectives, when the song
-P-A-G-E-18
  xviii INTRODUCTION 
is sung or listened to, the story read or told, which, if attained, 
will lead to changes in thought, feeling, and conduct in each 
of these situations. 
While improvement in conduct leading to habit is our most 
fundamental aim in making this curriculum, changes in 
thought and feeling, changes in appreciation, ideals, and atti- 
tudes, have not been omitted. Though the knowledge and 
ideals involved are not listed separately, it should be noted 
that they usually appear under the heading of activities or 
outcomes. A separate, more specific and detailed listing of 
the knowledge and ideals involved in these activities and 
conducts is being attempted as this, the first of a series of 
monographs on the education of young children, goes to 
press. 
Since the technical meaning of conduct is better under- 
stood by the classroom teacher than that of behavior, we are 
venturing to call this a ‘Conduct Curriculum,” though a 
“Curriculum of Behavior” might be technically more cor- 
tect. Psychologists will pardon this verbal change, if by the 
use of the term we get over to the public the idea that educa- 
tion must set as its objective the changed child—the child in 
which desirable changes in thought, feeling, and conduct are 
sought and achieved day by day, until habit and character 
have been established. 
In previous experiments we have attempted to apply the 
principles of education set forth by Doctor John Dewey, espe- 
cially in his theory of the socialized school, the relation of 
interest to effort, and the conditions of moral training and of 
thinking. In this experiment we have endeavored to con- 
serve these brilliant contributions. An effort has, however, 
been made to analyze these into more definite and measurable
-P-A-G-E-19
  INTRODUCTION xix 
form, in closer accord with the standards of present-day psy- 
chology. To those psychologists who have given criticism, 
direction, or encouragement to this lay effort we wish to ex- 
press our gratitude, while in no way holding them responsible 
for this attempt to utilize their contributions. In one ca- 
pacity or another, directly or indirectly, we have been assisted 
by Doctors Thorndike, Rogers, Gates, McCall, Cunningham, 
and Taylor. 
This endeavor to define the objectives in each school situa- 
tion is already bearing its fruit in the education of young 
children in better teaching and better learning. Much vague- 
ness has been eliminated, and even the untrained teacher 
can face each period in the schedule of the school day with 
a clearer consciousness of what she and the children must 
seek and achieve. In setting these very definite aims and 
objectives we must, however, endeavor to make them a 
means of wider freedom. Otherwise we may clip the wings 
of the child, robbing these early years of their naive and care- 
free spontaneity and creativity. The objectives must not 
curtail the child’s opportunities for originality and initiative. 
On the contrary, we must make habit serve as a means to a 
more productive creativity. The relation of originality and 
creativity to technique, habit, and routine has been pointed 
out by Doctor Edward L. Thorndike in his pamphlet on 
“Education for Initiative and Originality.” He says: “Orig- 
inality must not mean weakness in doing routine work in old 
ways, or any essential dislike of traditional knowledge or 
customs as such, or any paucity of fixed habits; but strength 
in doing work that is new, or doing it in new ways, an atti- 
tude of hoping to change knowledge or practice for the better, 
an organization of habits that causes their progressive modi-

fication. It is my privilege to know a fair number of original 
thinkers and workers in science, medicine, the ministry, law, 
and business. Such men are extraordinarily competent in 
routine work and extraordinarily strong in mere knowledge. 
The most original children of my acquaintance are so, not by 
any denial of the claims of mere lesson-learning and skill- 
acquiring in traditional ways. On the contrary, they could 
beat pedants and hacks of equal age at their own games. 
Occasionally they, and like minds of older age, become justly 
sceptical of the past and impatient of methods adapted to 
dull minds, but they never have the hopeless scepticism of 
the fool who does not care enough about the past even to 
learn its contributions.” 
In this day and generation one must not be unduly opti- 
mistic as to the result of experiments. Enthusiasm is entirely 
out of style in scientific circles and the day for faith in 
panaceas is past. Nevertheless, one might timidly venture 
to prophesy a better future for both school and society when 
the behavioristic conception of education shall be applied in 
the early impressionable years of childhood. The apprecia- 
tion of the importance of these early years is increasing all 
over the world. From England we get the title of Edmond 
Holmes’ most recent book, ‘‘Give me the Young.” In Amer- 
ica, Arnold Gesell says, regarding the relation of the pre- 
school period to all later stages of development: “There is 
one stage which has an autocratic position in the series, and 
therefore dominates all the rest—the autocracy of priority. 
The pre-school period is biologically the most important 
period in the development of an individual for the simple 
but sufficient reason that it comes first. Coming first in a 
dynamic sequence, it inevitably influences all subsequent
-P-A-G-E-21
  INTRODUCTION xxi 
development. These years determine character, much as 
the foundation and frame determine a structure... . The 
very laws of growth make these the most formative of all 
years. The younger the creature the more rapid its growth. 
In a certain sense the amount of mental growth which takes 
place in the first sexennium of life far exceeds anything which 
the child achieves in any subsequent period.” 
As a young nation we stirred the enthusiasm of other 
| peoples, over a century ago, in a declaration of the principles 
of national government. To-day, not only critics across the 
seas but we ourselves, in moments of discouragement, are 
prone to pronounce our national experiment a failure in the 
application of these principles to national conduct. We cling 
to our principles when asking the reason for repeated failure. 
Some would say we begin our training too late in life, thus 
overlooking the rare opportunities our schools offer for train- 
ing in democratic citizenship. 
When the wasted possibilities of these pads years of child- 
hood are utilized, when thought and feeling are transformed 
into desirable behavior, a “Great Society”? may not be a 
dream but a prophecy based on a reasonable hope.

I. THE SCHOOL SITUATION 
1. THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT 
The Horace Mann School is the demonstration school of 
Teachers College, Columbia University. The kindergartens 
are in Teachers College; the first grade (Room ror) is in the 
Horace Mann School building. 
The outdoor play space is limited and there is no provision 
for school gardens. The kindergarten and ‘first-grade chil- 
dren use the University campus, which is across the street 
from Teachers College. The first grade also uses 120th Street, 
which is closed to traffic during school hours. Riverside Park 
and Morningside Park are within easy walking distance. 
The entire school and college plant, including the swim- 
ming-pool, shops, museum, libraries, studios, laboratories, 
and engine-room, is open to the children for excursions and 
demonstrations. 
2. THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND 
The children attending the Horace Mann kindergarten and 
first grade come from families living in comfortable circum- 
stances. A few children are from wealthy families and a few 
from the families of students in the College. 
The fathers of the children are for the most part profes- 
sional men: teachers, lawyers, doctors. Some are business 
men. Practically all of the mothers have some interest out- 
side of the home which occupies part of their time. Many 
of them are following some definite line of study in House- 
hold Arts, Nutrition, or some of the various phases of 
I
-P-A-G-E-28
  2 CONDUCT CURRICULUM 
Psychology, while others are actively engaged professionally 
or in business, either from necessity or from choice. In many 
cases one parent is a college graduate, in some cases both 
parents. 
The group is drawn largely from American families, but 
there is a small representation of other nationalities—Eng- 
lish, French, Japanese, Russian, etc. 
The majority of the children live within easy walking dis- 
_ tance of the school, though some have to come long distances 
in public or private conveyances. Only a few families have 
automobiles. 
The homes are, in the main, apartments. In most homes 
there is a maid, and in a number there is a nurse or governess. 
Almost all the children leave the city during the summer 
months, going to the seashore, mountains, farms, and occa- 
sionally abroad. 
The children’s days and diet are carefully planned, with 
early hours and balanced foods, simple clothing, and fresh 
air. Nearly all of the children are taken out of doors in the 
afternoon for play in the campus or parks, where they have 
the opportunity of playing with other children and sharing 
their toys. About 25 per cent of the children are “only” 
children. 
Most of the children have had the experience of going to 
the moving pictures and other entertainments, but are not 
often taken to these. Nearly all have visited the Museum 
of Natural History, the Zoo, and a few have been to the 
Metropolitan Museum and the Aquarium. 
The parents frequently visit the school and hold confer- 
ences with the teachers with regard to the work of the chil- 
dren.
-P-A-G-E-29
  HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN 3 
3. THE PARENTS’ ASSOCIATION 
The Horace Mann School has a Parents’ Association, the 
members being the fathers and mothers of the children from 
the kindergarten through the high school. 
A meeting to discuss some subject of general interest is 
held once a month in the evening. These meetings are open 
to all members. 
The general organization is divided into class groups, each 
group being represented by a “grade mother” as chairman. 
These groups meet at their own convenience and carry on 
the line of activity or study which seems most necessary in 
relation to the specific problems connected with their chil- 
dren. Some of the topics discussed in group meetings of the 
kindergarten and first grade have been Nutrition, Emotional 
Life of the Child, Control and Discipline, Work and Aims of 
the Kindergarten and First Grade, Children’s Books, What 
to Tell Children along Biological Lines. 
The mothers co-operate with the children in the sale held 
each year for the benefit of some local charity, and have their 
table of fancy articles and cakes, which they donate and sell. 
The Parents’ Organization makes for close relationship 
between the home and the school. The parents, being in- 
telligently interested in the efforts and activities of the school, 
are always ready to co-operate in any phase of activity the 
school may wish to carry out. 
4. HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN 
Once a year each child in the kindergarten and first grade 
is given a complete physical examination. The objects of 
this physical examination are: (1) To keep a record of the
-P-A-G-E-30
  4 CONDUCT CURRICULUM 
pupil’s progress in growth and health from year to year, (2) 
to discover and to suggest ways and means of correcting any 
remediable defects or physical abnormalities. 
Physical defects and deviations from the normal are fol- 
lowed up from time to time through the appropriate channels: 
the home, the school, or the office of the school physician. 
The physical examination is made as early in the school 
year as circumstances permit. It includes the filing of a per- 
sonal history blank filled in by the parent or guardian, who 
is notified of the time and place of the pupil’s physical ex- 
amination and invited to be present. 
At the physical examination the child’s exact age is re- 
corded, his hearing is tested, also his vision and color per- 
ception. The child is observed for signs of nervousness, 
peculiarities of gait, defects of posture, speech, etc. He then 
goes into the dressing-room, undresses, and puts on an ex- 
amination robe. From here he passes into the office of the 
school physician, where his height, weight, lung capacity, 
strength of right and left forearm and chest measurements 
are taken. Signs of eye-strain are recorded, also condition 
and eruption of the teeth, condition of the nose, throat, ton- 
.sils, cervical and thyroid glands, signs of adenoids, and con- 
dition-of the skin. The heart and lungs are examined, hernia 
is looked fory scars from operations are noted and their con- 
dition observed. A record is made of scar from vaccination. 
The general posture, spine, and feet are examined. Marked 
defects in posture and especially weak feet are referred to 
a special teacher of corrective gymnastics for further examina- 
tion and appropriate corrective treatment. A record is made 
as to whether the child is above or below weight for his age 
and height.
-P-A-G-E-31
MENTAL STATUS OF THE CHILDREN 5 
In 1922-1923 out of 96 kindergarten children, as a result 
of the physical examination 85 were graded as good in gen- 
eral physical condition, 10 as fair. and only 1 as poor. 
After even one day’s absence from school on account of 
illness, a child may be readmitted to the school only after he 
has been seen by the school physician and given written per- 
mission to return to his classroom. This precaution is taken 
to protect the pupil himself from going into a group of chil- 
dren when he is below par, and also to protect the group 
against any disease which the pupil might spread were in- 
fectious symptoms still present. 
It is almost impossible for the school to prevent the primary 
cases of infectious diseases. This may be done to a certain 
degree by ever-vigilant parents who keep their children at 
home for the very slightest sign of ill-health. The school 
does try, however, to eliminate secondary cases of infectious 
diseases by notifying the parents of susceptible children as 
soon as an infectious disease has been discovered or reported 
in the group. When the parents are thus notified suggestions 
are made which if carefully followed should do much to pre- 
vent the recurrence of the particular disease in question. 
The children are weighed and measured every two weeks, 
and a careful record of height and weight is kept. 
Emergencies, such as bumps, bruises, sudden indisposi- 
tions, etc., are taken care of in the office of the school physi- 
an.

  II. PRINCIPLES, METHOD, AND ORGANIZATION 
1, EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING 
THE CURRICULUM o The Kindergarten-First-Grade situation should be one in — 
which the children have every opportunity for physi- 
cal development: 
(a) A hygienic environment, space. sunshine, and air. 
(6) Freedom to move in the environment and ma- 
terials which encourage activity. 
2. The situation must provide for intellectual growth, with 
consideration for individual differences. 
3. The emotional life of the child should be well balanced. 
It is as important to avoid emotional overstimulation 
as to avoid physical and mental strain. 
4. The social organization should be democratic in spirit 
and should allow for: 
(a) Authority, leadership, participation, and co-opera- 
tion. 
(6) Opportunity for the gradual taking over by the 
children of responsibility for the organization 
and conduct of the group. 
5. For the child of this age moral training is fargely social 
adaptation. The teacher should be conscious of the 
opportunities for such training and of the necessity 
for the formation of habits and attitudes such as obedi- 
ence, consideration for others, respect, and reverence. 
The amount of actual religious experience to be given 
is a matter for the individual teacher to decide.

-P-A-G-E-37
  METHOD It 
2. METHOD 
THE Curtp’s Part 
The child’s part is to respond to various materials placed \ 
where they are readily available to him and to use these to 
carry out problems of his own. He responds also to other 
stimuli provided by the teacher or the group. The child, as 
far as possible, purposes, plans, carries out, and judges the 
result of his problems. He should leatn when to ask for help 
and how to accept and use suggestion and criticism, both 
from the teacher and from other children. He should learn 
how to work harmoniously in a group as either leader or fol- 
lower, to share materials, and sometimes to subordinate his 
own interests to those of the group. =. 
es 
Tue TEACHER’S Part 
The teacher’s part is to supply the environment which will 
call out desired responses in the children. She is there to 
control the situation without dominating it. She should be 
able to raise standards of work step by step through: 
(a) Giving help in technique, information, suggestion, 
and criticism when necessary. 
(6) Supplying problems when the child has no worth- 
while problems of his own, or when she sees the 
need for a certain type of work. 
The teacher studies the children individually and keeps 
careful records of their work and progress. 
SuBjJeEcT-MATTER 
The subject-matter of the curriculum is supplied by both 
children and teacher. It may arise in different ways:
-P-A-G-E-38
  
12 CONDUCT CURRICULUM 
(a) Through responses of the children to the environ- 
ment provided. This environment is planned to 
meet tendencies which careful study of children 
has shown to be uppermost at a given age. The 
environment is not static, but changes to meet 
the growing needs of the group. 
(6) Through direct suggestions from the teacher or chil- 
dren. This includes subject-matter which arises 
through outside experiences the children may 
have and in which they wish the group to parti- 
cipate. 
/ eg. A child who had been to the silk show 
brought a cocoon to kindergarten; this led to dis- 
cussion of silkworms and silk. 
It also includes certain experiences which the teacher 
knows to be valuable and wishes the group to 
have. 
e.g. A child made a table-cover and wished to 
know how to decorate it. The teacher showed her 
how to use stick printing. Other children became 
interested in the new method of decoration. 
(c) Through tradition. 
1. Certain holidays and activities recur each 
year: 
While the activities differ, certain phases of 
them remain the same. 
e.g. The Christmas celebration with its 
service in the chapel, making gifts for parents, 
the Christmas party. 
The spring sale with the making of articles 
for the sale, etc.
-P-A-G-E-39
  ORGANIZATION 13 
2. Certain activities are reintroduced each year 
by children who have had older brothers or 
sisters in the kindergarten. 
' e.g. A child will ask for a certain material 
not at that time in evidence, because he has 
seen his sister or brother use it. 
Subject-matter seldom centres around one particular in- 
terest; the interests of children from 2 to 7 being in the main 
immediate and individual. Occasionally, as in the prepara- 
tion for Christmas or the spring festival, handwork, dramatic 
play, songs, and other activities naturally correlate with the 
interest in these festivals. 
All subject-matter brought in or suggested by the children 
is not equally valuable. The teacher must discriminate and 
select only that which is worth-while. 
3. ORGANIZATION 
The ideal of organization in the kindergarten and first grade 
is to make the situation as far as possible a democratic one, 
so that_the children will learn the ideals and conduct of a 
democracy. 
As the children are immature they cannot be entirely re- 
sponsible for Ueyeaet of the room—they have a right to 
the protection of authority. Because the teacher is respon- 
sible for the welfare of the children her first duty is to estab- 
lish definitely her authority. One way in which she does 
this is by expecting and getting immediate response to a piano 
signal. On hearing the signal the children leave their work 
and either stand quietly listening to what the teacher has 
to say or come quietly to the piano. The teacher uses her
-P-A-G-E-40
    14 CONDUCT CURRICULUM 
authority for the safety of the children, in emergencies, and 
for the public welfare. She may establish certain rules such 
as instant response to signals in fire-drill, quiet in the halls, 
but the reason for these rules is talked over with the children 
and understood by them. 
There should be a gradual sharing by the children of re- 
sponsibility for the organization and control of the room. 
In the youngest group there is little group consciousness and 
the organization is almost entirely by the teacher. With the 
older kindergarten children there is a definite response to 
public opinion, the children are able to make many of their 
own rules and to offer intelligent solutions to problems which 
arise. The first-grade children not only make practically all 
their own rules, but are able to see the situation which calls 
for the making of a rule. 
Group meetings are called whenever situations arise which 
make them necessary. There is a marked growth in the chil- 
dren’s ability to take part in and be responsible for these meet- 
ings. The following illustrations are suggestive of the stages 
in this growth: 
1. The teacher sees the situation, calls a meeting, puts 
the problem before the children, asks their help 
in the solution of it. The children may at first 
have very little to offer, the teacher may have to 
give the solution herself. 
e.g. There was a tendency for a number of 
children to ride on the merry-go-round, which is 
built for three. A meeting was called to discuss 
the situation. The suggestions offered were im- 
practical; 7. ¢., “Put a fence around the merry-go- 
round.” “Put it out of the room.” The teacher
-P-A-G-E-41
  ORGANIZATION 15 
then offered her suggestion that a rule be made 
allowing only three children on the merry-go-round 
at one time. This suggestion was accepted and 
obeyed by the group. 
2. The teacher sees the situation, calls a meeting, puts 
the problem before the children and asks their 
help in its solution. The children offer reasonable 
suggestions, the best of which is accepted by the 
group. 
e.g. In the first-grade room swinging on the 
rope during work period made it dangerous for 
those carrying scissors and other materials. The 
children, in a group meeting, decided that the rope 
should be used for climbing but not for swinging 
during work period. A rule to this effect was made 
and carried out by the group. 
3. The children see the situation, ask to have a meeting 
called, and offer their, solution of the difficulty. 
e.g. There was confusion in the hanging up of 
wraps after the first-grade recess. The children saw 
the need for a group meeting and offered a satis- 
factory solution. 
The solution to a problem may be either in the form of a 
rule or a suggestion, there being comparatively few actual 
rules. It is important for teacher and children to see that 
ithe rules made are kept. However, a rule made by the chil- 
ren themselves is not as often broken as one made by the 
eacher. 
Other meetings are called to discuss such topics as: 
1. The children’s responsibility for the care of the room 
and of materials.
-P-A-G-E-42
16 CONDUCT CURRICULUM 
2. The children’s work: 
What constitutes a good product. 
Why a certain product or method of work is 
poor and what can be done to improve it. 
3. Other subjects of interest, often introduced by the 
children: ‘ 
Plans for excursions, the weather, birthdays, in- 
teresting things the children have seen, etc. 
In these meetings, as in the meetings for organization, there 
should be growth in the responsibility of the children for the 
conduct of the meeting and the subject-matter introduced. 
Some of the specific conducts which are a result of these meet- 
ings are: 
1. Speaking distinctly and audibly. 
2. Standing when speaking to a group. 
3. Speaking one at a time. 
4. Speaking only when there is something worth while 
to say, and keeping to the point. 
5. Sitting still and listening while another child is speak- 
ing. 
. Voting on a proposal by raising hands. 
7. Realizing that it is the vote of the majority that 
counts.

III, THE TYPICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE CURRIC- 
ULUM AS RELATED TO DESIRABLE CHANGES 
IN THOUGHT, FEELING, AND CONDUCT 
The different divisions of the curriculum have been con- 
sidered under: 
(a) The activities involved. 
(6) The changes in thought, feeling, and conduct to 
which these activities lead. 
An attempt has been made to follow a uniform plan, but 
some adaptations have been necessary, as certain parts of the 
curriculum do not lend themselves to this plan. In general 
the form which has been followed is the listing of the typical 
activities of each group in each subject. The desirable 
changes in thought, feeling, and conduct to which these ac- 
tivities lead have been listed in a second column. 
The activities listed have not been selected arbitrarily by 
the committee. They are the result of years of study of the 
activities which are likely to occur in certain situations and 
to recur each year. The list is by no means a final or pre- 
scribed one. Other activities may grow out of the children’s 
interests, and it is not supposed that all the activities sug- 
gested will occur in one year’s work. 
With a few exceptions each column has been divided into 
our groups for each subject. These groupings also are merely 
suggestive. There can be no definite line of demarcation— 
it is expected that there will be a steady and continuous growth 
rom year to year. One hundred per cent efficiency is neither 
xpected nor desired.

-P-A-G-E-44
18 CONDUCT CURRICULUM 
1. THE WORK PERIOD 
In the morning when the children come into the room they 
have time to speak to the teachers, to the other children, to 
attend to their pets, plants, or to any special interest. There 
is no set time for work to begin. 
As the child selects his own problems, the activities of the 
work period are many and varied. The teacher guides selec- 
tion when necessary, suggesting to a child who needs group 
play that he join a group playing with the large blocks; to a 
too active child that he work at the tables. She holds the 
children up to the standard of their highest achievement, 
raises standards of workmanship through individual sugges- 
tion and help and through group criticism; and introduces 
new activities when the need for them is evident. (See 
“Method.”) 
In this period materials are provided which stimulate: 
1./ Activities which give physical development (particu- 
larly needed by these apartment-house children.) 
e.g. Using apparatus, playing with the large 
blocks, working with wood, etc. 
2. Activities through which the child learns to play 
with other children. 
e.g. Using apparatus, using blocks, playing 
with dolls, etc. 
3. Activities which give opportunity for thinking 
through a problem, for planning and originating. 
e.g. Using blocks, taking part in dramatic 
play, using industrial and fine arts materials, etc. 
4. | Activities which give opportunity for satisfying a 
play or practical need.
-P-A-G-E-45
THE WORK PERIOD IQ 
e.g. Making things for dolls, making a work- 
apron, etc. 5 
5. Activities which give opportunity for imaginative 
play. 
e.g. Playing in house built with blocks, play- 
ing with dolls, playing in the sand, etc. 
6./ Activities through which the child learns to be re- 
sponsible for and to take care of his own and others’ 
possessions. 
e.g. Getting out and putting away materials, 
cleaning up after work period, watering plants, etc. 
Standards for judging the degree to which an activity is valu- 
able: 
1. Is it the type of activity needed by the child at that 
time ? 
e.g. A child who has been swinging on the 
ropes for some time should change to a quieter 
activity. (The children themselves should gradu- 
ally take the responsibility for this.) 
2. Is the child’s use of the material legitimate ? 
e.g. A child may be using material roughly or 
in a way that annoys the others, or he may not 
have chosen the material best suited to his pur- 
pose. 
3. Is the work that the child is doing up to his highest 
standard and does it show progression, or is he 
merely manipulating material or repeating an ac- 
tivity ? 
e.g. A child may be pounding clay or mak-

20 CONDUCT CURRICULUM 
(Manipulation of material is, of course, legitimate 
with the younger group and with the older group 
at the beginning of the year.) 
Note.—One of the advantages of the informally or- 
ganized work period is that the child can progress 
at his own rate. 
Standards for judging material : 
1. Does the material encourage thinking ? 
2. Can the child use it to make a worth-while usable 
product ? 
e.g. Sewing a doll’s dress or an apron rather 
than a sewing-card. 
3. Is the material such that the child’s use of it will 
not cause eye or muscle strain? 
e.g. Large stone floor tiles instead of wooden 
tablets. 
4. Does the material conform to art and industrial 
standards ? 
5. If the material is permanent, is it durable and 
hygienic? 
e.g. Schoenhut wooden dolls rather than 
breakable or rag dolls.

(0) HYGIENE AND SAFETY 
Hygiene is incidental to all the activities of the day, being 
taught through actual situations as they arise. Conversa- 
tion at lunch-time often centres around such topics as the 
best kinds of food to eat, the correct way to eat, why we 
should keep food clean. Conversations at the lunch-table 
are frequently the means of inducing children who do not 
like cereals or vegetables to eat them, and every effort is made 
to co-operate with the home in this way. Discussions of cer- 
tain topics, such as the importance of cleaning teeth and 
having windows open at night, are not necessary with these 
children, as such matters are taken care of in the homes. 
Hygiene is such an important part of the lunch period 
that the conducts for that period are listed in the section 
“Lunch,” and to avoid repetition are only briefly touched 
upon here.

Materials 
Because of great differences in singing ability among the 
children it seems essential to divide them into groups accord- 
ing to their ability. Consequently the voices of the children 
are tested at the beginning of school and several times dur- 
ing the year. The children are classified into groups on the 
following basis: 
C Group—Able to reproduce simple series of tones accurately. 
B Group—Able to match one or two tones correctly but not 
a long series of tones. 
A Group—Unable to match one tone correctly. 
In selecting song material the needs of these three groups 
are kept in mind, so that the songs chosen are suited to their 
varying abilities. The following points are considered in 
song selection: 
Words: 
Childlike in idea and expression. 
Appealing and interesting in theme. 
Possessing literary merit. 
Short.

  IV. RECORDS OF CHILDREN’S WORK AND 
PROGRESS 
There are three types of records kept in the kindergarten 
and first grade: 
1. Individual daily record of children’s work. 
2. Yearly record of children’s development and progress. 
3- Weekly record of the activities of the curriculum. 
1. Individual daily record. 
This is a record of the child’s work during the work period, 
and is kept under three main heads: 
(a) Problem. 
(0) Interest (type of). 
(©) Development of product. 
2. Yearly record. 
This is written up four times yearly and records: 
(a) The child’s physical development. 
(6) The child’s social and intellectual development, in- 
cluding a rating of the child’s standing in the various 
subjects of the curriculum. 
3. Weekly record of the activities of the curriculum. 
This is written up every week, records the group activities 
of the week and is suggestive for further plans. 
Nore.—These record blanks may be obtained from the 
Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, New York City.

V. STANDARDS FOR PROMOTION 
CHILDREN’S STANDARDS FOR PROMOTION 
In each group the question of promotion is discussed 
and the children tell what they think they should know in 
order to be promoted. 
Some examples of children’s standards for promotion: 
Come when piano calls. 
Be quiet in halls. 
Do not get much sand on the floor. 
Share with others. 
Group IIT | Don’t waste clay, paper, or anything. 
Work and not play all morning. 
Learn how to read and write. 
Be steady, don’t talk too much. Group IT 
  First Grade { 
TEACHERS’ STANDARDS FOR PROMOTION 
At the end of the year the question of promotion is con- 
sidered from two aspects: 
1. Which children in the kindergarten are ready for pro- 
motion to an older kindergarten group or to the first 
grade. 
2. To which of the first grades shall each child who is 
ready for promotion be sent. (There are three first 
grades—one for the immature children, two for the 
more mature children.)

-P-A-G-E-162
  122 CONDUCT CURRICULUM 
In recommending children for promotion the teacher takes 
+ into consideration: 
1. The chronological age of the child. 
2. The mental age of the child as shown by the intelligence 
test. 
3. The child’s record in kindergarten as shown by the 
yearly record sheet. 
On the promotion blank the child is scored on four points, 
| the basis for scoring being 5 to 25 for each point. The yearly 
. record sheet and the daily record of work are both of assist- 
» ance in computing the child’s score. 
The points on which the child is scored: 
1. Ability to work intelligently (25 points). 
Does he plan his work? 
Does he carry through a problem? 
Is his work up to the standard of the group? 
2. Ability to co-operate in a spontaneous group (25 
points). 
Does he hold his own without being too aggressive? 
or 
Does he hold his own too aggressively ? 
3. Ability to participate in an organized group (25 points). 
Does he contribute? 
Does he take part? 
or 
Is he a non-participant ? 4 
t 
4. Responsibility (25 points). 
Is he responsible for self (e. g., going through halls, 
crossing streets). 
Is he socially responsible?
-P-A-G-E-163
STANDARDS FOR PROMOTION 123 
Does he take turns? 
Does he care for the welfare of others? 
In general the children who score the highest are sent to 
the advanced first grades, but the emotional stability of each 
child must also be considered, and the teacher’s judgment 
with regard to this finally determines where the child shall 
be placed. 
EXAMPLES OF WORKING OUT OF PROMOTION SCORES 
When scoring the children on a basis of 5-25 on the four 
points indicated, the teacher first scores the three children 
in the group who seem to her to represent the highest, medium, 
and lowest abilities for each point. 
  Point I Point IT 
Above average....Jane Smith 25 Jane Smith 25 
. Bobby Jones 15 Tom Smith 15 
Below average....Mary Brown 5 Mary Brown 5 
ete. 
The teacher then has some basis for comparison, and al- 
though this basis may not be strictly scientific it has proved 
its value and approximate accuracy. Each teacher scores 
all the children independently, so the child has the advantage 
of more than one judgment. The scores are then averaged.

  GENERAL PREFACE 
For the past six years the writer has been closely associated 
with the authors of the teaching enterprise of which the present 
volume is the outcome. He has watched them formulate their 
objectives, organize and recast their material, try out and dis- 
card one device in the technique of teaching after another— 
all in the presence of the most impartially critical of audiences: 
a succession of boys and girls who learn or do not learn ac- 
cording as we succeed or fail as teachers. The experimental 
organization of a course requires patience; if it does not work 
satisfactorily this year, we can forthwith form our hypotheses 
touching the cause of failure; but we must wait a year before 
we can experiment further. Such has been the history of the 
development of this text. 
The mission of the older textbooks in science was apt to be 
the teaching of principles which were or were not, as fate de- 
creed, applied to the interpretation of the environment. Educa- 
tion was confounded with erudition, and the more a boy knew, 
the better educated he was presumed to be. The general science 
movement interprets its task to be that of helping the younger 
generation to understand the world in which it finds itself. 
We accordingly do not teach principles and then apply them: 
we teach the child about the world, and in the process certain 
of the fundamental principles of science come to be definite 
realities. The center of effort, however, is the child and his 
adjustment, and not knowledge for its own sake. 
The authors have been singularly diligent in their adherence 
to this guidance. The environment is presented in some 
seventeen units, embracing the principal aspects in which it is 
manifested in the common life of society. Attention is focused 
Vv
-P-A-G-E-6
  vi GENERAL PREFACE 
upon the understanding of the world in each of these aspects. 
The pupil is first taken up into a high place and shown the 
scene as a whole, not as a syllabus or table of contents, but 
as a coherent and comprehensible picture. The process is 
repeated for each of the seventeen units and for each of the 
major phases of each unit. Each unit can be understood by 
the pupil in terms of its concrete meaning to his own life and 
to that of the society of which he is a part. This is very 
different from beginning with a definition of physics or chem- 
istry and thence pursuing the presentation in the logical order 
of development of the science. It is different too from a 
series of chapters describing natural phenomena and their 
meaning, capable of being read, and memorized if you will, 
but not capable of producing any modification of the pupil’s 
attitude toward his world except in casual instances. 
Successful learning in this or in any related field implies 
not only the acquisition of new concepts and the attainment 
of new attitudes, but it implies the inclination to seek farther 
and the ability to do so. The essence of educating an American 
citizen is to set him going under his own power and point him 
right. In a word, successful teaching results in the develop- 
ment of ability to study and the discovery of intellectual 
interest. 
The backbone of the text is therefore the exercises provided 
for study. Rightly understood, these are not directions for 
study, but the media in which directed study can be done and 
in which the kind of study ability which is specific to the 
sciences can grow. If the text were simply descriptive and 
explanatory material interestingly illustrated, it would doubt- 
less be valuable for reading purposes but scarcely worthwhile 
for assigning class meetings or for paying teachers to work 
with. The teacher and the descriptive pages are essential to 
the learning process, but understanding and insight appear 
only as the result of hard study, prolonged study, and well 
directed study.

GENERAL PREFACE vii 
The test of learning is: what will the pupil of his own initi- 
ative do with it? Accordingly, the exercises throughout are 
their own testing, and the ultimate test is furnished in the 
voluntary supplementary projects listed for each unit. If 
the pupil elects to work at these projects as he has oppor- 
tunity, we have perhaps the best possible evidence that the 
course is establishing in him the new attitudes which are not 
only the ultimate test of learning but are learning itself.

AUTHORS’ PREFACE 
AND 
FOREWORD TO TEACHERS 
The contributions of science study to present-day life are 
so manifold and important that we have come to speak of 
this age as the age of science. Everywhere, in the home, 
the school, the playground, the workshop, and the community 
in general, the phenomena and applications of science influence 
our lives. Citizens of today can better understand, enjoy, 
appreciate, and control their environment, and adjust them- 
selves to it, through knowledge of the science involved in the 
daily problems of sensible, happy, healthful; comfortable, and 
efficient living. Their intellectual, moral, and ethical char- 
acter depends in part upon their understanding of and their 
attitude toward the forces and materials of nature. 
Our boys and girls grow up in this scientific age and become 
the citizens of the next generation. At the adolescent period 
their natural interest in the environment creates a desire and a 
demand to know something of the great contributions of 
science to modern life and to human progress; their near 
approach to adult citizenship makes the need for science 
knowledge and for correct attitudes toward science problems 
imperative. They must be acquainted with and have training 
in the proper methods of thinking about such problems, so 
that they may be able to do such thinking for themselves. 
The immediate aim of science instruction in the years fol- 
lowing the elementary school period is, therefore, the broad- 
ening of the youth’s experiences with the forces and materials 
of his environment and the developing of an attitude of open- 
mindedness and a spirit of inquiry concerning the nature, value, 
and use of science in modern life. Along with this experience- 
getting and attitude-forming come the power and inclination 
to do effectively what civilization demands of every citizen.

    x PREFACE AND FOREWORD TO TEACHERS 
And out of these results grow the appreciation of nature and 
the cultural and enjoyment values which help to build indi- 
viduality and character. The ultimate aim of introductory 
science is, then, the active and wholesome participation in the 
desirable activities of life, or good citizenship. If science in- 
struction in the early years of high school meets this objec- 
tive, it will in an equal degree meet the objective of exploring 
the fields of science, and will thereby stimulate and guide 
the student in his later study. 
The formulation of the,course of study in science for the 
adolescent youth is a difficult task. Such a course must 
attain the aims stated in the preceding paragraph. The 
subject-matter and the method of study must appeal to the 
student. The knowledge and training involved must be 
worthwhile and usable in daily life. Careful selection from 
a wide field of knowledge must be made. The content must 
be organized for an actual study or teaching situation. The 
method of presentation must conform to the best modern 
practice. Only by trial and error in the classroom can all 
of these criteria be met. 
We, the authors, have thoroughly tested the study material 
in this book in the light of valid criteria. Since 1913 we have 
been associated in science classrooms with students of the 
adolescent age. Their interests, needs, and abilities have been 
carefully studied. Available educational literature and actual 
practice bearing on science instruction have been thoroughly 
examined and observed. 
Eight years ago we began to formulate mimeographed study 
material for use in the classroom... Each year since that time 
the material has been revised according to the valid criticisms 
arising during its use. A considerable number of other teach- 
ers in the department and in other schools have assisted 
in this work. Many secondary-school administrators and 
teachers of science have visited our classes and have offered 
numerous criticisms and suggestions for improvement. Par- 
ticular assistance has been given by the hundreds of science
-P-A-G-E-11
  PREFACE AND FOREWORD TO TEACHERS xi 
teachers who have been students in our teacher-training 
courses during the eight-year period. 
In the selection of subject-matter four major points have 
been constantly before us: 
First, the subject-matter must be based upon past experi- 
ences of boys and girls and must broaden their knowledge of 
the environment. Knowledge which will result in an adjust- 
ment to the environment will necessarily emphasize the hygienic 
aspects of daily life. Reference to the table of Contents 
will show how this principle of selection has been kept in mind 
throughout the course. Second, these materials must satisfy 
the student’s natural interests in the phenomena and applica- 
tions of science. Thousands of questions by students, various 
investigations of their interests made by different educators, 
and, above all, daily association with a large number of classes 
over a period of years have assisted in meeting this second 
criterion. Third, the subject-matter must be of the proper 
degree of difficulty. The ability of the students thoroughly 
to understand the content of the course under classroom con- 
ditions has been, therefore, a guiding principle. This requires 
a degree of difficulty which insures a proper demand on the 
student’s power of thinking as well as the satisfaction which 
comes through successful accomplishment of the activities 
involved. Fourth, the organization of the materials for teach- 
ing purposes and the consequent method of study must give 
training in proper methods of study in order to develop desir- 
able attitudes, correct study habits, high ideals, wholesome 
interests, and worthwhile perspectives. 
The selection of subject-matter for a course is no more 
important than the organization and presentation of such 
subject-matter for training students. During the years of 
experimentation on the course presented in this text many 
plans of organization have been tested. The result of the 
classroom experimentation has led us to organize the content 
into relatively few units, each unit representing a major topic 
or problem of everyday social significance. With such a plan
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii PREFACE AND FOREWORD TO TEACHERS 
students approach and see the facts and principles of science 
in their proper environmental relations, and use only such 
facts and principles as are necessary to solve the major prob- 
lems of their surroundings. The artificial distinctions be- 
tween special sciences as organized by specialists are of little 
consequence in the life of the average citizen and are, there- 
fore, postponed to later elective courses in science. 
The number of units is small. This is in accord with the 
recommendations of several recent committees on intro- 
ductory science courses. Experimentation has shown that 
such a plan eliminates the piecemeal memoriter type of learn- 
ing which resulted when the course was divided into many 
chapters or units, and provides instead a medium for the 
understanding of worthwhile phases of the environment 
through more extended and more thorough study of the rela- 
tionships of the science facts involved. Moreover, tests have 
proved that even the facts and principles of science are better 
remembered when studied as a part of a major problem. The 
small number of units has, therefore, been decided upon to 
afford real training value and to eliminate the encyclopedic 
treatment of science. 
While the content of the various units is arranged in a 
sequential order of development which gives the student a 
story of his environment, it is well to think of each unit as a 
“block of study.” Essentially the book is a study-book. Each 
unit is constructed in such way that the laws of learning and of 
problem-solving are used. This plan of organization demands 
that the treatment be full enough to cover the gaps so com- 
mon in an encyclopedic treatment of science. The study of 
a considerable amount of related material is the only sure way 
to arrive at a thorough understanding of a problem. 
The Pretiminary Exercises which precede each unit 
furnish concrete means for recall of past experiences and 
knowledge pertinent to the new unit. At the same time they 
review units previously studied in so far as the knowledge is 
necessary in the new topic or problem. Such recall and review
-P-A-G-E-13
  PREFACE AND FOREWORD TO TEACHERS xiii 
motivate the work and are in accord with the important prin- 
ciple of proceeding from the known to the unknown. The 
exercises are so stated that each student can test himself in 
writing and thereby furnish the teacher with a diagnostic 
measure of his students’ residue of knowledge before they 
proceed further in the unit. With such diagnosis the teacher 
may know which points to emphasize in the later study and 
may also properly fit the course to the individual student. 
A Srory or THE Unir follows the PRELIMINARY EXERCISES. 
This brief sketch of the unit content covers only a few pages. 
It gives the pupil a bird’s-eye-view of the unit, emphasizing 
the development of man’s knowledge in the particular topic, 
his dependence upon the understanding of that topic, and his 
use of such understanding. Moreover, it further motivates 
his later study and assists him in relating the less important 
details of the problems which follow to the central idea of the 
unit. Experimentation has shown that the story serves its 
purpose best if presented by the teacher in a short, clear talk 
of from 10 to 20 minutes. 
With the proper motivation and with an over-view of the 
unit in mind, the pupil next turns to a careful, detailed study 
of the important problems into which the unit is naturally sub- 
divided in daily life. Here he is provided with many activities 
which broaden his knowledge and give him training in the 
proper study attitudes and in the methods of solving prob- 
lems. Throughout the problems he finds various exercises, 
planned not only to recall usable experiences and to acquire 
new ones, but also to test his understanding of the reading and 
of the experiments performed during his study. 
The content of the problems is so planned that either the 
individual or the group method of instruction may be used. 
The exercises may be done by individual pupils or used as a 
basis for class discussion and quiz. In either case they give 
training and practice in such important activities as: (a) oral 
or written expression, (b) silent reading, (c) interpretation of 
the printed page, (d) interpretation of experiments, (e) inter-
-P-A-G-E-14
  xiv PREFACE AND FOREWORD TO TEACHERS 
pretation of maps, diagrams, tables, or graphs, (f) preparing 
outlines, (g) summarizing knowledge, (h) reorganizing knowl- 
edge for new purposes, (2) drawing, (j) finding information in 
source material, and (k) studying home and shop appliances. 
These activities thus furnish abundant opportunity for 
correlation of the work in science with courses in English, 
mathematics, drawing, civics, and manual or domestic art. 
Since each kind of activity appears in several different parts 
of the course, there will result the value of practice and repeti- 
tion in correct methods of performing such activities. 
Especial attention has been given throughout the text to 
the experiments and illustrations. The materials and appar- 
atus for the experiments have been selected so that the small 
school as well as the large school will have no difficulty in 
securing them. The Teacher’s Guide-Book contains sug- 
gestions for many alternative experiments. An unusually 
large number of illustrations to which the text makes constant 
reference has been included. In order to insure the study of 
these illustrations, exercises have been formulated which 
require the students to make careful analyses of them. 
In order to provide for individual differences of interest 
and ability there are ApprITIONAL EXERCISES AND PRoJEcTS 
placed at the end of each unit. At the end of the text proper 
there are lists of Topics AND Prosects FoR INVESTIGATION 
and RererENcEs for each unit. The AppirioNaL ExERcIsES 
AND Prosects are of such nature that the better students can 
do them with little or no further study beyond the unit con- 
tent. The Topics AND ProJEectTs FoR INVESTIGATION represent 
subjects which are related to the unit, but which will require 
considerable study or experimentation beyond the subject- 
matter of the unit. The Rererences will suggest extended 
source material for further study. The best references for 
the Topics AND ProsEcTs FoR INVESTIGATION are given after 
each topic or project. The teacher may shorten the course 
here outlined by judicious elimination of some of the numerous 
exercises. On the other hand, the course may be extended
-P-A-G-E-15
  PREFACE AND FOREWORD TO TEACHERS XV 
by the inclusion of as many of the AppITIONAL EXERCISES AND 
Prosects or of the Topics aND ProsecTs FOR INVESTIGATION 
as may seem desirable. The list of references is intentionally 
made very long to assure that some of the books given may be 
found in any library. Selected lists with publishers’ names 
and prices will be found in the Teacher’s Guide-Book. 
On page xxi will be found a section To THE StupEnT. 
This section contains a brief story of the entire course. It 
also includes directions on ‘How to Study This Book.” These 
will assist the student to understand the “how and why” of 
each step in his study, thus making his various activities 
purposeful. The teacher should not fail to direct his students 
to read this section carefully before beginning the study of 
Unit I. Detailed instructions and suggestions to the teacher 
will be found in the Teachers’ Guide-Book, which may be 
obtained from the publishers. 
The pronunciation of all difficult words and of proper names 
is given in the Pronunciation List beginning on page 575. 
It is urged that the teachers encourage in the students the 
habit of using the List and of pronouncing all terms correctly. 
The pronunciations are given according to Webster’s Dic- 
tionary.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
  Space does not permit us to express our grateful appreciation 
to each of the large number of critics of the manuscript of 
this book. We trust that it will not be invidious, therefore, if 
we here thank the few who have given most during the years 
of experimentation involved in a task made pleasant by their 
encouragement and assistance. Our first debt is to Mr. 
Charles H. Judd, Director of the School of Education of the 
University of Chicago, and to Mr. W. C. Reavis, Principal, 
University High School, for the opportunity presented. Par- 
ticular gratitude is felt for the constant guidance and assist- 
ance of Mr. H. C. Morrison, Superintendent of the Laboratory 
Schools, who has given most freely of his time and energy 
during the last six years and who has made possible the con- 
ditions of the experiment during the most important stages of 
the development of the materials. 
- To the following who have read the final manuscript of 
this book we are glad to express our thanks, but they are in 
no sense to be held responsible for the content or plan: Miss 
Katherine Neumayer, East High School, Aurora, Illinois, Mr. 
Daniel R. Campbell, Stuyvesant High School, New York 
City, Mr. Rae G. Van Cleve, Fairfax High School, Los Angeles, 
California, Mr. W. Kiang, University of Wisconsin, Mr. James 
G. Pentz, Director of Inspection of High Schools, State of 
Pennsylvania, Mr. George J. Baltzar, Washington High School, 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Our thanks are also due Dr. Arthur 
. J. Cramp of the American Medical Association, who read the 
proofs of Unit VII, and Mr. Storrs B. Barrett of Yerkes 
Observatory for his critical reading of Unit I. 
The illustrations are important and essential. We are in- 
debted to many organizations and institutions for these. 
’ Finally, we wish to remember our own teachers of previous 
years, who have caused us to retain an interest in the education 
of boys and girls even above our interest in any special science.

  TO THE STUDENT 
Nature holds many interesting secrets. Some of these you 
learn by observing what goes on around you; others you read 
about or hear discussed from time to time; many you can 
never hope to know unless you study science. Until you have 
studied the science of nature (natural science), you will be 
ignorant of the wonderful forces and materials which nature 
has provided for your education, your comfort, your enjoy- 
ment, and your well-being. Like the primitive man of old or 
the savage of today, you can have only ignorance, fear, and 
strange superstitions about your surroundings. With a knowl- 
edge of science and the scientific way of thinking about life, 
you will come to know, enjoy, and appreciate nature, and 
therefore be a happier and better member of your home and 
community. 
This book will, if you use it properly, acquaint you with 
some forces and materials of nature and, at the same time, 
show you how to think about your surroundings in a scientific 
way. The story of the “things” to be studied and the method 
you will use are stated in Sections (A) and (B) following. 
(A) THE STORY OF THIS BOOK 
Imagine, for a moment, that you are living centuries ago 
when man knew little about the earth and its place among the 
heavenly bodies. The shape, size, and movements of the 
earth are unknown to you. The causes of day and night and 
the seasons have not been explained. The changes in weather 
and their causes, as well as the climate of your region, are 
puzzles; perhaps man has not even tried to understand them. 
You and your neighbors spend the days providing food and 
seeking ways to protect yourselves against the weather, climate, 
beasts, fire, and other men. You live on raw food and know 
XXL 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  xxiv TO THE STUDENT 
little or nothing about cultivating the soil. Your water supply 
is obtained from springs or streams. There is no knowledge 
of how to keep in good health. The cause of disease and 
methods of protecting yourself from disease have not been 
considered. Present-day clothing and building materials do 
not exist. Machinery for farming and factory use has not 
been invented; there are no farms or factories. The use of 
fire for manufacturing materials such as iron, steel, cement, 
and glass, is yet undiscovered. Dwellings, such as they are, 
are neither heated nor lighted. The many conveniences and 
devices in your present-day home are lacking. 
“What a strange world!” you say. It does seem strange to 
one who has known only the world of the twentieth century. 
Yet, for centuries man lived in such primitive conditions. All 
sorts of strange imaginings and notions were his. As the years 
passed, however, he began to understand nature better. Being 
able to see, hear, smell, taste, feel, and, above all, to think 
and to reason with himself and his neighbors, he came to 
explain some of nature’s wonders. Particularly during the 
last few centuries he has made great progress in his knowledge 
and use of the things which nature provides. 
Today, because of the many discoveries and inventions, we 
live in an age of science. We know something of the place of 
the earth in the universe, its movements, and their effects. 
Climate and weather are understood, at least in part. A 
knowledge of farming allows us to produce a great variety of 
foods which we know how to select, prepare, cook, serve, and 
preserve in different ways. A purified water supply can be 
obtained and distributed to our buildings, and the dangerous 
wastes and sewage can be made harmless. The value to 
health of good food, pure water, fresh air, exercise, sleep, rest, 
and proper clothing is understood, and the causes and methods 
of prevention of many diseases have been discovered. Man 
has learned how to make use of such forces as fire, steam, air, 
water, electricity, heat, light, and sound. Various building 
materials, heating and cooking devices, lighting devices, ma-
-P-A-G-E-25
  TO THE STUDENT XXV 
chines, engines, electrical inventions, and methods of trans- 
portation and communication show further the great difference 
between the life of today and the life of years past. 
The field of man’s knowledge is so large that it would re- 
quire many years to know thoroughly only one small portion 
of the science of your surroundings. You can, however, by a 
careful study of this book get a start into the secrets of science, 
and also develop an interest for the further study of some 
particular science in later years. 
Let us get first a bird’s-eye view of the earth on which we 
live and of what man has learned about some of the great 
forces and materials of nature. Look, now, through the table 
of Contents to see the titles of the different units, or major 
topics, which you will study. Then return to this story, 
keeping in mind that the following paragraphs give a picture 
of each unit. The paragraphs consider the units in the same 
order in which they are listed in the table of Contents. 
Tue Eartu on Wuicu You Live is but a small part of the 
great Universe (Unit I). Thousands of stars are scattered 
in space. These stars are really enormous bodies millions and 
millions of miles from the earth. One of the stars, the nearest 
to the earth, is the sun—the center around which the earth 
and seven other planets revolve. The sun, planets, and moons 
are the principal members of the solar system, or sun’s family. 
Of all these bodies the earth is most interesting to you because 
it is your home. Its forces and materials, and the heat and 
light from the sun, make life possible; its movements cause 
day and night, the seasons, changes in time, weather, and 
climate; the land, water, and air furnish you with the essentials 
and comforts for your daily existence. 
While there are many forces and materials in your surround- 
ings, perhaps no two forces are more important than WEATHER 
AnD Cumate (Unit II). These determine where you live, 
what you eat, the clothes you wear, the kind of houses in 
which you live, your health, and, in faci, nearly everything 
you have and do. Favorable weather and climate have been, 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
    Xxvi TO THE STUDENT 
since the earliest days of man’s existence, two of the greatest 
factors in his progress. Climate and civilization appear to be 
closely related. Moreover, as man has learned to understand and 
predict weather changes and to know the climates of different 
regions, he has been able to live more comfortably and efficiently. 
Your existence on the earth requires certain essential ma- 
terials. Provipinc A Goop Foop Suppry (Unit III) is one 
of our most important problems. Your food supply has 
always come from the green plants, which are the food fac- 
tories of the earth. Whether you eat the plant products or 
the animals which feed on the plants, you must depend upon 
the plants for your daily menu. In early times man lived on 
raw plants and animals. He had no scientific way to select, 
prepare, cook, or preserve his food. As the centuries passed, 
he learned to make use of fire for cooking. A study of the 
composition of foods and the use which the body makes of 
the different kinds led to a knowledge of how to select that 
which is best to insure a healthy body. The cause of decay 
and scientific methods of preserving and transporting foods 
were also discovered. 
Nature has furnished you with another essential for life. 
Without water you can live but a short time. OBTAINING A 
Goop Water Suprty (Unit IV) is another of man’s great 
problems in life. Even in primitive times communities were 
established where nature provided springs or other sources 
of fresh water. Later, water was obtained from underground 
sources or from distant lakes and rivers. Today every com- 
munity has as one of its most important problems that of 
furnishing its inhabitants with a plentiful and pure water 
supply. Pumps, reservoirs, pipes, faucets, and hydrants 
are now in use. The water used for drinking purposes 
must be pure, that is, free from the germs which cause such 
diseases as typhoid fever and cholera. Science has made it 
possible not only to obtain and distribute the necessary supply 
for all purposes, but also to prevent the germs from entering 
it and to purify the water which does contain these germs.
-P-A-G-E-27
  TO THE STUDENT xxvii 
Following the unit on water supply, we shall consider one 
of man’s greatest problems in life—that of KEEPING IN Goop 
PuysicaL Conpition (Unit V). The human body is a very 
complex machine, which requires as essentials food, water, 
and air. Man’s study of his own body has taught him how 
it works, the uses it makes of the three essential materials 
which are taken into it through the mouth and nose, the 
value and need of exercise, sleep, rest, and proper clothing, 
the care of its different parts, and first aid measures in emer- 
gencies. The science of keeping well is one of man’s greatest 
fields of discovery. It is a science which you should know if 
you wish to be healthy, happy, and efficient. 
As indicated in the last paragraph, proper methods of 
SELECTING AND CaRING FoR OuR CLorHine (Unit VI) have be- 
come a practical necessity for life. This is particularly true 
in certain regions where the climate and weather changes are 
marked. Cotton, linen, wool, and silk furnish us with many 
kinds of clothes. Rubber, straw, leather, and paper are also 
used. A knowledge of chemicals and their actions has made it 
possible to bleach, cleanse, and dye clothing materials as well as 
to make new materials. The body’s need for protection and 
our artistic sense have led to the science of procuring and manu- 
facturing clothing materials. Our knowledge of sanitation 
and our pride in cleanliness have resulted in our study of 
methods of keeping our clothes clean. 
In connection with the care of the body and proper clothing 
we naturally think of the dangers of disease. No discovery of 
man is more important than that which Louis Pasteur, a 
French scientist, made during the latter part of the nineteenth 
century. It was he who first learned that the real cause of a 
certain disease was the presence of germs. As a result, we 
know today that most deseases are caused by germs, and it is 
possible to understand in part how the germs get into our 
bodies, how they make us sick, how we may avoid the spread- 
ing of disease, how we can protect the body against the rav- 
ages of the germs, and how our bodies should be treated when  
-P-A-G-E-28
xxviii TO THE STUDENT 
  we are siek. ProTecTING OuRSELVES From DisnasE (Unit VII) 
has thus become a scientific matter of daily importance. 
In his struggle with nature, man early learned how to 
make use of one of her greatest gifts, fire. Through a study 
of Tue Nature aND ConTROL OF Fire (Unit VIII), man has 
found that fire can be used to cook his food, to furnish heat 
and light, and to make many of his building materials and 
tools. He has also learned what materials burn, and that the 
air and a certain temperature are necessary to cause burning. 
A great variety of uses of fire has been discovered. Many 
kinds of fire materials, or fuels, are used. Man’s knowledge of 
fire has been one of his triumphs in understanding nature. He 
knows how to use it and also how to prevent its dangers. 
Man seems never to be satisfied with his present conditions 
and knowledge. His desire for comfort, health, and efficiency, 
and his competition with others, have caused him to study and 
to discover many truths about nature, and to perfect many 
new inventions. Provipineg Heat anp Fresu Arr IN Our 
Burtpines (Unit IX) represents two great steps in man’s 
progress. Since the early days when man sat around the 
campfire or open fire to keep warm, great progress has been 
made in perfecting heating devices. We have our fireplaces, 
stoves, furnaces, fireless cookers, and other devices for using 
heat. What a change from the unpleasant open fire in one 
corner of the room and the smoky air within the hut to the 
modern steam or hot-water heating plant! 
Through the use of fire and fuels, many MATERIALS FOR 
Construction (Unit X) have been made. In primitive 
times man lived in shelters made of trees or earth, and used 
for his tools such crude devices as he could make from wood 
or stone. When, however, he learned how to manufacture 
iron and steel and other metals, he could make tools, machines, 
and thousands of devices which we use today. Wood and 
stone could be cut to any shape; lime, cement, and glass could 
be manufactured; fireproof buildings could be. constructed; 
modern heating devices could be made. Contrast our modern
-P-A-G-E-29
  
  TO THE STUDENT xxix 
homes and modern machinery with the shelters and crude tools 
of primitive man, and you will see what science has done for 
us in providing materials which we can use for making things. 
Equally great progress has been made in man’s use of tools 
and Macuines ror Doinc Worx (Unit XI). The crude 
tools of former years, made of wood and stone, have been 
replaced by all sorts of metal tools and machines. Fire has 
made it possible to manufacture these, and today we find a 
variety of devices used to help man do what he formerly did 
with his unaided strength. Many of the simple tools and 
machines which use man’s own strength as a source of “power” 
are found in every home and in every factory. 
Man has also learned to save his strength and time by 
Purtine THE Forces or AIR AND WATER TO Work (Unit XII). 
He uses air pressure to operate pumps, siphons, and various sim- 
ple devices. Air can be compressed and used to operate air 
brakes on trains as well as to inflate automobile tires. Wind- 
mills have been devised to make use of air in motion. Water 
has also been put to work in running water wheels of various 
kinds for the purposes of operating machines and of generating 
electricity. 
As fire came to be better understood, it was used as a source 
of power. It is the heat of burning fuel which generates steam 
in the steam engine and which produces the power in a gas or 
gasoline engine. The forces of steam and exploding gas in 
these two kinds of engines saw our wood, cultivate the soil, 
dig ditches, harvest the crops, make roads, propel our auto- 
mobiles, steamships, airplanes, and locomotives, run all kinds 
of complicated machines in factories, and, in many other ways, 
work for us. Ustne Steam anp Expiopine Gas ror PowER 
(Unit XIII) will be an interesting problem for your study. 
And now we come to GENERATING AND Usine ELEecrriciry 
(Unit XIV), in which everyone is interested. Fire and elec- 
tricity are the great sources of power used today. The first 
part of our study of electricity will consider how electricity is 
generated by cells. You have seen or used dry cells and storage  
-P-A-G-E-30
  XXX TO THE STUDENT 
cells. But do you know how they furnish electricity and how 
they are made? Our second step in understanding electricity 
is to consider how electricity is made by dynamos and how it 
is used for running machinery, for electroplating, and for 
furnishing heat. At the same time you will learn how the 
electric motor works, for it is this machine which makes use 
of the electricity generated by dynamos, and so helps us to do 
our work. 
Fire and electricity have been referred to as two of na- 
ture’s greatest forces which man has used for heat, light, and 
power. Through the use of these forces for LicghHTiInc OuR 
BurnpIncs AND Streets (Unit XV), our modern homes, 
factories, office buildings, and streets have become safer, more 
pleasant, and more comfortable. Artificial light is only another 
of man’s great discoveries which has changed our ways of 
living. The use of gas and electric light, as well as a better 
understanding of how to use the sunlight, has contributed much 
to our civilization. 
By the use of electricity and other forces we have made 
great progress in Communicating Wira Our NeIcHBoRS 
(Unit XVI). As man came to live in different sections of 
a country and in different countries, he needed ways to 
communicate with people at a distance. Think how modern 
communication compares with the crude methods of sending 
messages used until only a few score years ago. Today we 
talk by long distance telephone from one end of the country 
to the other and send wireless messages across the oceans. 
How do these instruments make use of electricity to send our 
messages? Certainly you will wish to find out in your study. 
One of the very important purposes of air, steam, and 
electric power is that of TRANSPORTATION BY LAND, WATER, 
AND Arr (Unit XVII). Modern methods of transportation 
have made it possible to travel and to exchange all kinds 
of materials with people living in different states and differ- 
ent countries. From the previous part of this story you 
understand something of how nature’s great forces have been
-P-A-G-E-31
  TO THE STUDENT xxxi 
harnessed by man. You know that engines, motors, and other 
devices furnish “power’’ for running machinery and for trans- 
portation on land. In this last unit of the book you will see 
how man has learned to travel by land, water, and air. 
If you would know more about the wonderful discoveries 
and inventions mentioned in this story, you must study them. 
You must read the text, do the experiments, and test your 
understanding by means of the exercises. The scientist who 
thoroughly studies any problem constantly keeps his problem 
in mind, and then by reading and experimenting tries to solve 
it. He does not ‘jump to conclusions,” nor is he satisfied with 
half-knowing. He works carefully and accurately until he 
feels sure that his conclusion or answer is correct. It is in this 
spirit that you should study this book, following the sugges- 
tions given in Section (B.) 
(B) HOW TO STUDY THIS BOOK 
At the beginning of each unit of this course you will find 
several PreLiminaRY Exercises. These will help you to re- 
call what you already know about the subject-matter of each 
unit. Write your answers in your notebook. If you cannot do 
all of them at the start, do those which you can. Most of 
these exercises were suggested by boys and girls in other 
science classes. It will be interesting to see how many you 
can do before studying the unit. At the end of the unit you 
can return to these exercises and complete all of them, chang- 
ing any answers which were not correctly made before your 
study of the unit. 
Following the doing of the exercises, the teacher will tell 
you the story of the unit, or you may be asked to read it as it 
is given on the first few pages. This story will make your 
study more interesting and more meaningful, for you will 
see where you are going and how each day’s work relates to 
the unit. Ask the teacher to explain the points you do not 
understand when the Story or THE UNir is finished. If you
-P-A-G-E-32
  xxxii TO THE STUDENT 
have questions about points which were not mentioned, write 
them on a sheet of paper and hand them to the teacher or to 
the class secretary. These questions can then be answered 
later in class discussion. When you clearly understand the 
story, make a brief outline of the main points. Then write 
the story of the unit in your notebook as you would tell it to 
your parents, your younger brother or sister, or your friends. 
Each main point of your outline will make one paragraph of 
your story. 
With a clear picture of the unit in mind, you can now begin 
to study the problems which follow. Each of these problems 
you can solve by careful study. When you take up.a problem, 
read it through rapidly to see what it is about; then go back 
and study it carefully, doing the experiments and exercises. 
Look up all cross references given in the text. Also, use the 
table of Conrents for further help on any subject. Follow 
the suggestions given at the beginning of the index. The 
pronunciation of all difficult terms and names are given in a 
Pronunciation List beginning on page 575. During your 
study of this book learn to pronounce the words correctly. 
The exercises you will enjoy doing because they will give you 
an opportunity to show how well you understand the problem. 
If you cannot do them at the first attempt, go over the problem 
again, and, if other books are at hand, read what they say 
about this problem. (See REFERENCES AND GUIDE FOR 
ADDITIONAL Srupy, page 513.) When you are sure that you 
can do the exercise, do it. This method of study will let 
you test yourself. You will know when you really understand 
the problem or any part of it. 
When you have finished all of the problems and the exer- 
cises and feel that you fully understand the unit, you may 
be asked to make an outline of all you have learned. This 
outline may be topical or in statement form, as the teacher 
requests. Write the title at the top of your notebook paper, 
and then write the main points below, dividing each main 
point into the important ideas which you have gained in your
-P-A-G-E-33
  TO THE STUDENT xxxiii 
study. Instead of the outline, your teacher may ask you to 
write the complete story. 
When all students have finished the outline or story, the 
class will spend a day or two discussing the unit. You may 
be asked to talk on the entire unit, on one of the main points 
in your outline, or on one of a list of recitation topics given 
by the teacher. In any case, you should be able to speak on 
your topic before the class for several minutes, using the black- 
board to illustrate what you say or sometimes performing ex- 
periments before the class, in order to make your speech inter- 
esting and clear. If you know your subject thoroughly, you 
will enjoy talking about it to the class. Moreover, your class- 
mates will enjoy your talk if you give it with clearness and in 
an interesting, forceful way. 
If you finish your work on any unit ahead of your class, or if 
you have extra time outside of class, you may have the privilege 
of doing additional work. Consult with your teacher about 
your plans, and bear in mind that there are three kinds of ad- 
ditional or supplementary study which you may choose to do. 
First, you may do the AppiTIOoNAL EXERCISES AND PROJECTS 
listed at the end of each unit. Second, you may read one or 
more of the interesting RererENnces listed in the section 
beginning on page 513. Third, you may select one of the 
Topics AND Prosects For INVESTIGATION following the RrrmR- 
ENCES on each unit. 
The AppiTionaAL EXERCISES AND Progects are for the care- 
ful, rapid worker. They are good tests to see if you can use 
the knowledge gained in the study of the unit to solve new 
problems. Most of them require but little time and may be 
done in the classroom when you have a few spare minutes. 
For your guidance in further reading turn to the REFERENCES 
AND GUIDE FoR ADDITIONAL Srupy beginning on page 513. 
There you will find a list of books and pamphlets for each unit. 
Following the list and under the title “Guide to References” 
are two kinds of reading material. Those marked “General” 
present subject-matter similar to that considered in your study
-P-A-G-E-34
  Xxxiv TO THE STUDENT 
of the particular unit. Then appear other references dealing 
with “Specific Topics” or problems met in the unit. Through 
reading these general and special references you will better 
understand the unit. 
The Topics AND Prosects ror INVESTIGATION are for those 
students who wish to undertake work outside the class. Each 
topic or project will require careful study. Consult with your 
teacher before selecting one. When you have completed the 
work on one of these, you should be ready to give an oral or 
written report to the class or to the teacher. 
Real success in your work during the course in science means 
that you will do three things: (1) complete the required work 
on each unit promptly and thoroughly; (2) do considerable 
outside reading in the reference books, magazines, and pam- 
phlets; (8) do the additional exercises at the end of each unit 
and also several topics and projects for investigation. Then 
you will feel the satisfaction of having proved that you have the 
qualities of a good citizen.

THE EARTH ON WHICH YOU LIVE 
How to begin your study of this unit. Do the Preliminary 
Exercises below. These will help you in the later study of 
the unit. Write out as many of the exercises in your note- 
book as you can, making a title for each. For example, call 
Exercise 1 “Heavenly Bodies I Know.” Follow the plan 
given on page xxxi in the preceding section, ‘To the Student,” 
which you should read before beginning work on this unit. 
PRELIMINARY EXERCISES 
1. Name as many different kinds of heavenly bodies as you can. 
2. Make a list of the eight planets. If you can, arrange them in 
the order of their size, from largest to smallest. 
3. What are two movements of the earth? How do these 
movements influence your life? 
4. Write a paragraph on the subject, “Why I Believe the 
Earth Is Round.” 
5. How does the time of sunrise and sunset change throughout 
the year? 
6. The solid surface of the earth was once nothing but rock. How 
do you account for the presence of the different kinds of soil which 
exist today? 
7. Why is it hotter in summer than in winter? 
8. People set their watches ahead or back at certain places when 
they travel east or west. Why do they do so?

THE STORY OF UNIT I 
The little earth on which you live is only one among billions 
of heavenly bodies. As you look at the sky on a clear, moon- 
less night, there seems to be no end to space and to the number

Fig. 1. A Starry Night 
Seen through a telescope, a small part of the sky shows count- 
less stars, some of which appear to be arranged in clusters.   of heavenly bodies (Figure 1). You can see over 2,000 stars. 
Millions of others are too far away to be seen with the naked 
eye, or are hidden from your view by the earth. There are 
probably over one billion (1,000,000,000) stars in our star system, 
or galaxy. You can realize that the number of bodies in our 
galaxy is very great if you look at the Milky Way and know 
that this Milky Way is made up of stars, millions of miles apart. 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE STORY OF UNIT I 3 
But our galaxy is not the end of space and of the heavenly 
bodies. Far outside of our galaxy are other galaxies, probably 
many, each made up of millions of stars and other bodies. 
These, when seen with 
powerful telescopes, look 
like great whirling masses 
and are called spiral neb- 
ulas (Figure 2). All of 
the galaxies and the spaces 
between them make up 
our universe. 
Now let us come back to 
our own galaxy. Our mil- 
lions of stars, or suns, vary 
greatly in size and appear- 
ance. Some are smaller 
than our sun, which is over 
1,000,000 times as large as 
the earth ; others are many Fig. 2. A Spiral Nebula

white; others look yellow, eae 
like our sun; a few are only hot enough to have a reddish appear- 
ance. All are moving rapidly through space, although at our 
great distance they seem to be standing still. 
The star nearest to the earth is our sun. Because it is only 
93,000,000 miles away, it looks very large and bright, and 
yet it is only a medium-sized star. It is hundreds of thousands 
of times nearer to us than the next nearest star. It, therefore, 
looks much larger than the distant stars and can send to the 
earth much more heat and light. 
While the stars are millions of miles from the sun, there are 
several large bodies, not stars, near the sun. The most im- 
portant of these are the planets, or wanderers, so-called because 
they seem to move so rapidly. Imagine that you are far out Courtesy Yerkes Observatory

sun appears very bright because, like all visible stars, it is 
extremely hot and therefore gives off much light. Eight 
planets can be seen. These do not give light of their own, but

are not real stars, but small bodies which fall from space 
into the air covering of the earth. As they pass through the 
air they become very hot because of the resistance of the air. 
Sometimes they “burn up” 
and fall to the earth as dust. 
These meteors can be seen 
from the earth because they 
give off light when hot. 
Often they fall to the earth 
and are found to vary 
greatly in size. Some are 
no larger than marbles; 
others weigh several tons.

Of all the bodies in the universe the earth is naturally the 
most important and most interesting to you, for it is your 
home. This great ball, nearly 8000 miles in diameter and 
25,000 miles in circumference, has two movements which 
greatly influence your life. Your daily work and sleep, your 
work and play at different seasons of the year, and even the

To locate any of the seven constellations, hold this map or chart directly 
north of the eye, having Polaris of the map in line with Polaris of the 
sky. Turn the map until the name of the present month of the year is 
at the bottom, and at 8:00 p. m. the constellations will appear in the sky 
in practically the same positions as on the map. 
You must keep in mind that the constellations appear to turn 
around the North Star, or Polaris, or rather around a center 
near the North Star, if you wish to find them at any time

of the year. Those in the northern sky near Polaris are always 
visible in the Northern Hemisphere. 
To find the North Star, start at the Big Dipper. The two 
stars (A) and (B) in Figure 9, on the side of the bowl opposite 
the handle, are called the pointers. Imagine a line drawn 
through these two stars, starting at the bottom of the bowl 
and extending beyond the Dipper five times the distance 
between the pointers, and you come to the North Star, which 
is about as bright as the pointers. 
The North Star is the end star of the handle of the Little 
Dipper, a group of seven stars in Ursa Minor. If you imagine 
yourself coming out the line which you followed from the Big 
Dipper to the North Star, and then, when you reach the 
North Star, turning to the left, you can easily find the 
Little Dipper. 
A third constellation near by is Cassiopeia (kis’i-6-pe’ya), the 
queen on her chair. To find her, draw a line from the middle 
of the handle of the Big Dipper to the North Star and extend it 
as far beyond as the distance from the Big Dipper to the North 
Star. Here you find a ““W” shaped group of five bright stars 
which form the chair on which the queen is seated. 
Going two-thirds of the way from the North Star toward 
Cassiopeia and making a left turn, you find Cepheus (sé’fis), 
the queen’s husband. From the maps showing the constellations 
you can work out the location of any of 
the other constellations, such as Perseus 
(the son of Jupiter), Auriga (6-ri’ga) (the 
charioteer), Bootes (the bear driver), Hercules 
(the warrior), and Draco (the dragon). 
After you find the principal constellations, 
you can locate the bright stars, numbered pests Fig. 10. Big Dipper in Figure 8, by the names below the figure. aa ‘August Position

  12 THE EARTH ON WHICH YOU LIVE 
PROBLEM 2: WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE PRINCIPAL 
BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM? 
The sun is the center of the solar system. Although it is 
a small star, the sun is so near us that it furnishes the heat 
and light which make life possible. It also keeps the earth 
and other planets in their paths by its attraction for them. 
This attraction is called gravity. The size of the sun is enor- 
mous when compared with the earth; its diameter is about 110 
times as great, it weighs over 300,000 times as much, and it 
occupies over 1,000,000 times as much space. This great ball 
of fire rotates on its axis just as the earth does. 
The planets are not all alike. The eight planets are similar 
in many respects, but like members of any family they differ 
in a number of ways. Since you already know that they travel 
around the sun, let us see how they differ from each other. 
We will consider them in the order of their distance from the sun. 
Mercury, called the messenger because of its great speed, 
is the nearest planet to the sun and the smallest in size. Be- 
cause it is so small, the force of gravity is not great enough to 
hold air around the planet. It is often quite close to the 
earth, but is usually invisible because it is so near the sun 
and therefore lost in its rays. When visible to the naked eye, 
Mercury is seen as a red body, but appears to have a dull 
silver color when observed through a telescope. 
Venus, the lovely planet which you so often see as the even- 
ing or morning “star,’”’ is nearer the earth than any of the 
. other planets when it is on the same side of the sun as the earth. 
It shines in the west as the evening star for a period of seven 
or eight months, then disappears for a few weeks, and appears 
again in the east as the morning star. When viewed through 
a telescope, Venus shows, at different times, the various shapes 
of our moon. Like the earth it travels around the sun in a 
nearly circular orbit. In fact, it is so much like the earth 
that the two are often spoken of as the twin planets. 
Because we shall study the earth in later problems, let 
us next consider Mars, the red planet, so named for the
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE PLANETS AND THE MOON 13 
god of war. Rotating on its axis like a spinning top once in 
24 hours and 37 minutes, its day and night are almost of the 
same length as ours. Like the earth, Mars has four seasons. 
It is doubtful whether there is any air 
around it, but a white spot which can 
be seen through a telescope near its 
north pole during the winter season, and 
which looks like snow, suggests that 
there may be some water vapor around 
the planet (Figure 11). This spot is not 
visible when it is summer on Mars. 
As we move farther from the sun and 
leave Mars and the other small, or 
minor, planets behind, we come to the 
major planets, of which the nearest to 
the sun is Jupiter, the giant. Like the 
other major planets, its surface is prob- 
ably composed of gases. A thousand Fig- 11. ees Caps’ 
times as large in volume as the earth, en Le erate 
and larger than all of the other planets appear and sometimes 
put together, Jupiter rotates on its disappear at different 
axis in 9 hours and 55 minutes, at the *“*S°PS °° aoe 
enormous speed of 30,000 miles per hour, and, being far from 
the sun, revolves around the sun in approximately twelve of our 
years. Nine moons revolve around Jupiter, two of them larger 
than the planet Mercury. Four of 
these moons were the first heavenly 
bodies to be discovered with the tel- 
escope. Galileo, an Italian using the 
first telescope, found them in 1610. 
Saturn, the next planet from the sun, 
is, on account of its rings, one of the 
most beautiful planets when observed 
through the telescope (Figure 12). These rings are nothing 
more than a great number of very small satellites, revolving 
around the planet. It rotates rapidly on its axis and revolves     Courtesy Yerkes Observatory

14 THE EARTH ON WHICH YOU LIVE 
around the sun in 293 years. It has four seasons like the earth, 
but they are each over seven years long. Ten moons, one larger 
than our moon, revolve around Saturn. 
When Herschel, an English astronomer, made his own tele- 
scope in 1781, he discovered a moving “star’’ which was at 
first thought to be a comet, but proved to be a planet. This 
planet, which is farther from the sun than Saturn, is called 
Uranus, although in England it is sometimes called Herschel, 
after its discoverer. It has a volume sixty-five times as great 
as that of the earth. Four moons 
revolve around the planet. 
The last of the planets is Neptune, 
four and one-half times as great in 
diameter as our earth, and thirty 
times as far from the sun. It can- 
not be seen with the naked eye. 
The most interesting thing about 
Neptune is the way in which it 
was discovered. Astronomers had 
noticed that Uranus did not travel 
in exactly the path which they

located it with the telescope, and named it Neptune.     Exercise 2. Name the planets on which you think life does not 
exist. Following each, give your reasons. 
The moon is our nearest neighbor. Although several of the 
planets have one or more moons, the moon of the most interest 
and importance to us is that of the earth (Figure 13). This 
satellite is very different from the earth. Because it is only
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE PLANETS AND THE MOON 15 
240,000 miles away, it looks as large as the sun, but it is really 
only 2160 miles in diameter and weighs only one-eightieth as 
much as the earth. You could not live on the moon, for there 
are on it no air, no water, no soil, no plants, and no animals. 
The surface is solid rock. When viewed through a telescope, it 
appears very rough with high mountain-like projections and 
with large holes like the craters of volcanoes. 
The moon has two important movements. It travels around 
the sun in its orbit, and as it does so it moves back and forth 
across the orbit 
of the earth, as Joon What Really Happens ae

  Experiment 1: How does the moon move around the earth? 
Draw a large circle several feet in diameter. Imagine that the sun 
is at the center of the circle and that the earth revolves around it 
along the circumference of the circle. Place a large ball or orange 
on the circumference to represent the earth. Now obtain a small

ball or a marble to represent the moon. Have the earth and moon 
in the positions shown at the right of the upper part of Figure 14. 
Now move the earth along the circumference of the circle (its orbit), 
and at the same time move the moon along its orbit as shown in the 
figure. Note that the moon is actually revolving around the earth as 
you proceed to the different positions of the earth and moon as repre- 
sented in Figure 14. 
From your experiment and your study of Figure 14 you can 
imagine the earth and moon in space, moving around the sun. 
You see the earth making one revolution in 365} days, and 
the moon going along like a real satellite. However, the moon 
travels in its own orbit and thus makes a complete turn around 
the earth once every 29} days, or a little less than a month. 
From the earth you see the moon rise and set as the earth 
rotates. If you note the time when the moon rises on two 
successive nights, you will find that it rises about 50 minutes 
later each night. This, you can see from your experiment, is 
true, because the moon revolves around the earth. 
The moon appears to change shape. An interesting thing 
about the moon is its apparent change in shape. On different 
nights it sometimes appears round, sometimes like a very 
thin crescent, and at other times like a quarter-circle. This 
change is only apparent; that is, the shape merely seems to 
change. The moon, like the planets, does not give light of its 
own, but reflects the light of the sun. The half of the moon 
that faces the sun is always lighted, but is not always visible 
from the earth. If all of the surface of the moon which faces 
the earth could always be seen, the moon would appear round 
or full at all times. An experiment in a dark room will show 
how it appears in different shapes, or phases. 
Experiment 2: Why does the moon appear to change its shape? 
Obtain a candle and a tennis ball, which are to be used to 
represent the sun and moon, respectively. You are to represent 
the earth. Place the lighted candle on a table or stand. With 
your back to the candle hold the ball (the moon) in your out- 
stretched hand, high enough above your head to allow the light

to strike the ball. What part of the ball is lighted by the candle 
(the sun)? Now turn around slowly from right to left, keeping 
the ball in front of you 
and slightly above your 
head so the light will 
strike it. Observe what 
part of the ball is 
lighted as you turn. 
Repeat your turn, stop-

The moon is one 
of the causes of the 
tides. If you have 
ever been at the

observed the regular

the water at different 
hours of the day. 
These tides, which are 
so important to people 
who live and work on 
the ocean front, are 
due in part to the 
moon. Twice in about 
25 hours the tides rise 
and fall, producing

period of a little more than a day. The moon helps to cause these 
tides by its attraction for the earth. As the earth rotates, the 
   
-P-A-G-E-53
  
THE PLANETS AND THE MOON 19 
part of its surface nearest the moon is attracted more than the 
other sides of the earth. This is true because the nearer bodies 
are to each other, the greater is the force of gravity. This attrac- 
tion causes the water in the seas and in the mouths of rivers that 
run into the sea to be pulled up a few feet higher at this part 
of the surface, causing a high tide (Figure 18). On the opposite 
side of the earth, which is farthest away from the moon, the 
moon’s attraction is not so great, but the water is piled up 
  
  Fig. 18. How Tides Are Caused 
The water, being a liquid, is free to move and, having weight, is at- 
traeted by the sun and moon. This causes it to rise at certain places and 
thus become lower at other places. Meanwhile the earth rotates, and the 
places of low tide and high tide change constantly. 
there by the outward, or centrifugal, force of the rapid spin- 
ning of the earth and by the attraction of the sun. These 
two forces produce a high tide at that place. Between these 
two parts of the surface the attraction of the moon and sun 
is more nearly balanced by the centrifugal force of the rotat- 
ing earth. The water at these places is, therefore, low (Figure 
18). You can see, then, why there are two low tides and two 
high tides daily on any seashore. You might expect a high 
tide to occur every 12 hours because the earth rotates once 
in 24 hours. You will recall, however, that the moon is 50 
minutes later each day. Thus the high tide occurs every 12 
hours and 25 minutes. 
Exercise 6. State three forces which cause tides.

PROBLEM 3: HOW DID THE EARTH COME TO BE 
AS IT IS TODAY? 
The earth was probably formed from a nebula. No one knows 
with certainty how the earth was formed. Many astronomers 
believe that our entire solar system came from a nebula. This 
nebula, they think, was formed when a star and our sun came 
near each other in their travels through space. As they passed, 
their great attractions for each other caused one of them 
partly to be pulled to pieces, and set the smaller pieces into a 
twisting or revolving motion around the central part. This 
nebula, called a solar nebula, probably looked much like the 
spiral nebula shown in Figure 2. It was millions of miles in 
diameter. Here and there in the twisting nebula were the larger 
spots or masses of solid material, surrounded by the smaller 
pieces and gases. 
As this nebula rotated, the thinner materials in it collected 
around the thicker or denser spots. The center became the 
sun and the spots became the planets, moons, and planetoids. 
All of these bodies continued to rotate. The planets revolved 
around the sun, or center, and the moon around the planets 
as well as around the sun. 
The earth is very old. Scientists have estimated the age of 
the earth by calculating how long a time would be required 
for streams to carry enough salt into the seas to make them 
as salty as they are now, by studying the rock formations, 
and by determining how long it takes to crumble rocks into 
soil and to cut gorges like that of the Niagara River. These 
estimates vary from 100,000,000 to 1,500,000,000 years. 
The earth is ever changing. As the interior of the earth 
cooled, the solid crust was pushed up in some places. This 
action formed mountains and plateaus and left low places at 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  22 THE EARTH ON WHICH YOU LIVE 
other parts of the earth’s surface. The surface of the earth 
became very irregular. Some of these low places filled with 
water, forming the oceans.

Fig. 19. From Rock to Soil 
Roots of trees, falling rock, burrowing animals, waves, and changes of 
temperature are some of the forces acting on rock to crumble it into soil. 
But for these forces fertile fields would be impossible. 
During the millions of years since this happened, the rock 
surface of the earth has been broken up and moved in many 
ways (Figure 19). The air caused some of the rocks to crumble. 
Water, freezing in the cracks of the rocks, split them into 
smaller pieces. Running water has cut into the rocks and 
ground the broken pieces into fine particles which were carried 
along by the water and dropped in other places as different 
kinds of soil. The action of waves along the shores of lakes 
and oceans has worn away rocks and carried the pieces to other 
places. Also great ice sheets, or glaciers, broke and ground 
the rocks, and carried them to other regions, and wind moved 
the finer particles from one place to another. All of these 
changes in the earth’s crust are still going on.
-P-A-G-E-57
LENGTHS OF DAYS AND NIGHTS 23 
One of the most remarkable changes on the earth was the 
coming of living things. In some way, and many centuries ago, 
life began in the soil and water. Today there are millions 
upon millions of plants and animals. These vary in size from 
the most minute living things, so small that they may be seen 
only with the aid of the most powerful microscopes, to such 
huge plants as the giant trees of the forest or such enormous 
animals as the elephant and the whale. All of these, includ- 
ing yourself, live together and are dependent upon each other 
as well as upon the many materials and forces of nature. The 
materials obtained from the rock, soil, water, and air furnish 
you and all living things with everything needed except the 
light and heat from the sun. These materials and the many 
forces of nature, such as growth, disease, weather and climate 
changes, heat, light, electricity, wind, and others, determine 
how and where living things grow. They are a part of your 
surroundings, or environment. 
You see from this that your environment is very complex 
and interesting. It will be even more interesting as you learn 
more about science.

PROBLEM 4: WHY DO THE DAYS AND NIGHTS 
DIFFER IN LENGTH? 
But a few centuries ago man believed that the sun revolved 
around the earth, and that the earth was flat and surrounded 
by water. Later, man learned that the earth is round, that 
it spins on its axis, and that it revolves around the sun. 
Exercise 10. Give one reason for believing each statement in the 
last sentence to be true. 
The days and nights vary in length. The earth receives 
its light from the sun. Being round, only one-half of the 
earth’s surface can be lighted at one time. Since the earth 
rotates on its axis at a regular speed, once every 24 hours, you 
might expect the sun to rise and set at the same time every day. 
If this happened the days and nights would be of equal length. 
Why? You know that the days and nights are not of equal 
length at different times of the year. 
Exercise 11. Look up in an almanac the exact times of sunrise 
and sunset for the first day of each month and determine the 
exact length of day and night. Place your results in a table as 
indicated. As a conclusion state what you have learned about the 
length of day and night at different seasons of the year.

The angle of the sun’s rays varies. You recall from geog- 
raphy that the unequal days and nights are caused by the 
inclination of the earth’s axis. That is, the earth rotates in a 
plane inclined or tilted 233° to the plane in which it revolves 
around the sun. A simple experiment will make this clear.
-P-A-G-E-59
  
LENGTHS OF DAYS AND NIGHTS 25 
Experiment 3: What causes the days and nights to 
be of unequal length? 
Push a straight wire or knitting needle about 6 to 8 inches long 
through the center of a tennis ball or a hollow rubber ball. The 
points where the needle leaves the ball should be marked N and S 
to represent the North and South poles. The candle is the sun and 
the ball is the earth. Now place an X on the earth to indicate the 
latitude at which you live. Draw a circle through X so that all points 
of the circle are at an equal distance from the North Pole. 
Place a short lighted candle at the center of a circle one foot in 
diameter, drawn on a large piece of paper. The room should be 
dark. Place the earth directly south of the sun and have the North 
Pole end of the axis (the needle) point to the North Star. Note that 
the axis and plane of rotation of the earth are now tilted to the plane 
of revolution, or the table top (Figure 20). 
  Fig. 20. Days and Nights Vary in Length 
Observe that one-half of the earth is lighted, but that over one-half 
of the circle through X is lighted. If the earth is rotated, it will be 
seen that X remains in the light for more than one-half of one rotation. 
The day is longer than the night at X. Move the earth around the 
circle to a position east of the sun, but keep the axis pointed to the 
North Star. Rotate the ball and note that X is in the light for exactly 
one-half of a rotation. The day is now equal to the night. Let the 
earth be revolved on the circle until it is north of the sun. The day 
at X is now shorter than the night. When the earth is moved still 
further around and is west of the sun, the day and night at X are equal.

  26 THE EARTH ON WHICH YOU LIVE 
Exercise 12. Having in mind what you saw in the experiment, 
imagine the earth and the sun in space, and state the reasons 
why we have unequal days and nights at different times of the 
year in the Northern Hemisphere. 
PROBLEM 5: WHY DO THE SEASONS CHANGE? 
The changes in the seasons are as important to you as the 
varying lengths of days and nights. Throughout the greater 
part of the United States these seasonal changes affect life 
in various ways. Particularly in the country the seasons 
determine the kind of work that must be done. In both country 
and city the seasons govern largely the kind of clothes you 
wear, the games you play, the weather you have, and even the 
kind of food you eat. You know that it is warmer in summer 
than in winter, and that spring and autumn are more or less 
similar in temperature. As a scientist you should be able to 
explain why these changes occur. 
The angle of the sun’s rays changes every day. From 
your previous study you recall that the seasons are caused 
by the rotation and revolution of the earth. In the United 
States the sun rises a little south of east in winter and a little 
north of east in summer. You have probably observed that 
the sun is more nearly overhead at noon on a summer day 
in the Northern Hemisphere than it is at noon on a winter 
day (Figure 21). A simple experiment will show that the 
angle at which the sun’s rays strike the earth varies from 
day to day. 
Experiment 4: How does the angle of the sun’s rays change 
from day to day at the same hour? 
Cut a small round hole, about one-half an inch in diameter, 
in a piece of cardboard. Place the cardboard in a south window of 
a room so that the sun’s rays will pass through the hole and strike 
a piece of paper on the floor, window sill, or table. Draw the outline 
of the spot where the beam of light which passes through the hole 
strikes the paper. Write the date and the hour inside the outline. 
At intervals of ten minutes repeat. On succeeding days, at exactly 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  
CHANGE OF SEASONS 27 
the same time of day, draw the outlines of the spots, and note that 
the paths of the spots are farther from, or nearer to, the window. 
The changing position of the spots from day to day shows that the 
sun’s rays strike the earth at different angles on different days.

Fig. 21. Where the Sun Appears to Be 
If the axis of the earth were not inclined to its orbit, the sun would 
appear to rise in the same direction throughout the year; there would be 
no change of seasons. 
Exercise 13. If you carried out Experiment 4 on every day 
of the year, how would the distance of the spot from the window 
change? What does this show regarding the change in the angle 
of the sun’s rays (a) from January to March, (b) from April to 
June, (c) from July to September, (d) from October to December? 
The angle of the sun’s rays affects temperature. Does 
the angle of the sun’s rays determine the amount of heat 
which the earth receives from the sun? If it does you can 
see one reason why seasons occur, for you have found from 
the preceding experiment that the angle of the rays varies 
at different seasons. That the sun does warm the earth you 
know from experience. The rays come through the space
-P-A-G-E-62
  28 THE EARTH ON WHICH YOU LIVE 
between the sun and the atmosphere, and then through the air 
before they strike the earth. They do not heat the space 
, above the air, for there is no material present. However, when 
the rays strike the air and the surface of the earth, they change 
to heat which affects the temperature. 
You can learn from an experiment one reason why the angle 
of the sun’s rays has an effect on the temperature of the earth’s 
surface. 
Experiment 5: How does the angle of the sun’s rays determine 
the amount of light and heat the earth receives? 
(a) Bend a piece of cardboard so as to make a square tube one 
square inch in cross-section and one foot long, as shown in Figure 22. 
Paste a narrow strip of heavy 
cardboard to one of the inside 
walls of the tube so that the 
¢ a strip extends 6 inches beyond 
the end of the tube. Darken 
\ the room and hold a candle 
flame or a flash-light at the 
upper end of the tube. Incline 
the tube, resting the end of the narrow strip on the table and having 
the tube at about a 25-degree angle with the table top, as in the 
figure. This will allow a beam of light one inch square to strike the 
table. Make the outline of the spot of light 
caused by the beam which passes through the 
tube. Also note the brightness of the spot. 
(b) Now change the position of the tube 
so that the beam of light strikes the table at 
an angle of about 75 degrees. Be sure that 
the end of the narrow strip of cardboard 
just touches the table, as in Figure 23. Mark 
the outline of the spot of light, and also ob- 
serve its brightness. 
Compare the sizes of the two spots obtained 
in (a) and (6), measuring them and determining 
the area of each. 
You see that the same beam of light covers less space when 
the angle at which it strikes the table is greater. You can also 
  Fig. 22 
  Fig. 23 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
CHANGE OF SEASONS 29 
see that the spot is brighter when the beam strikes the table 
more nearly vertically. There is more light on the same area. 
Exercise 14. The figures in Experiment 5 represent the sun and 
the earth. Figure 22 shows the angle of the sun’s rays in winter; 
Figure 23, the angle in summer. What is true about the amount of 
light and heat received from the sun at noon on a summer day com- 
pared with that received at noon on a winter day? Explain. 
There is another point which you must consider in explain- 
ing why the angle of the sun’s rays affects temperature. As 
the rays of the sun come through the air toward the earth, 
they lose some heat to the air, because some of the rays strike 
particles of air. Dust particles in the air also help to stop the 
rays, and thus all of the heat does not reach the earth. Now 
in winter the rays come at a great slant and must, therefore, 
pass through a longer column of air than in summer when they 
are more nearly vertical. As a result they give up more of 
their heat to the air in winter, and so have less heat left when 
they strike the earth. In summer the rays are more nearly 
vertical, and, having to pass through a shorter column of air, 
they bring more heat to the surface of the earth. 
Exercise 15. From Exercise 11 and Experiment 5 state two reasons 
why summer is hotter than winter in the Northern Hemisphere. 
PROBLEM 6: HOW DO WE GET CORRECT TIME? 
The earth is our best clock. The movements of the earth 
not only determine day and night and the seasons, but also 
our time. The most regular movement of any body which 
we know is the rotation of the earth on its axis. It varies less 
than one one-hundredth of a second in a thousand years when 
measured by the stars. This movement of the earth is, there- 
fore, the best clock in the world, and it is actually used to keep 
correct time. j 
“What time is it?” is a question which you hear many times 
every day. Ordinarily you look at a watch or clock, or perhaps 
at the sun for the answer; very seldom do you find that two   
 
-P-A-G-E-64
30 THE EARTH ON WHICH YOU LIVE 
clocks or watches exactly agree. In ordinary life it makes 
little difference whether two watches are exactly correct, but 
on a railroad, for example, a difference of a few seconds may 
mean the loss of life. Why? Here, as in certain other affairs 
of life, it is necessary to have correct time. 
Naturally you ask, Where do we get correct time? If you 
asked the question of many people, a majority would say that 
we get it from the 
Western Union or the 
Naval Observatory. But 
suppose you ask, Where 
do the Western Union 
and the Naval Okserva- 
tory get time, and how 
are they sure that their 
time is correct? Most of 
us would answer, “from 
the sun.” But few of 
us could tell just how the 
sun is used to tell time, 
and few of us know that

or west of the meridian which passes gbserying the stars.

live? What are the latitude and longi- Seale daily ‘ude of the North’ Pole? activities depend largely 
upon daylight and dark- 
ness, we use solar time, or sun time. Sun time is found in this 
way: a telescope is set in a true north and south line, that is, on 
a meridian (Figure 24). The exact time when the sun appears in 
the middle of the telescope is recorded. Thisis noon. On the next 
day the passing of the sun over the meridian is again recorded. 
The time between the two records is the true solar day. The 
average of the solar days for a year is called the mean solar   
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  GETTING CORRECT TIME 31 
day. This we divide into 24 hours, each hour into 60 minutes, 
and each minute into 60 seconds. 
Time varies with the longitude. The mean solar time 
varies at places having different longitudes. If it is noon at 
Chicago, you know that it is afternoon in New York and fore- 
noon at Denver. It is 25,000 miles around the earth at the 
equator, and since it takes 24 hours for the earth to make one 
rotation, the mean solar time must vary one hour for a little 
over 1000 miles, or about one minute for 17 miles at the equator. 
In the latitude of 40 degrees north (40°N), from 12 to 13 miles 
make one minute’s difference in the time. Since there are 360 
degrees in a circle, you see that to go once around, the earth 
moves through 360 degrees. This rotation requires 24 hours. 
Therefore the earth moves through 15 degrees per hour. If, 
then, it is twelve o’clock (noon) at a place having 0° longitude, 
it would be one hour later at a place having 15° East longitude 
(Figure 24). 
Because the local times vary, there would be great confusion 
if everyone used local mean solar time. To avoid this con- 
fusion, and particularly to help the railroads in making their 
schedules, our government in 1883 adopted Standard Time. 
The 75th meridian, passing through Philadelphia, was made 
the starting point, and all places east and west within one-half 
hour of the local time of this meridian adopted the local time 
of the meridian. This is the Eastern Time Belt (Figure 25, page 
32). West of this belt is the Central Time Belt. Going westward, 
we find the Mountain Time Belt and the Pacific Time Belt. 
This division of the United States into time belts makes it 
necessary for travelers going westward to set their watches 
back one hour whenever they cross from one belt into another. 
If you were making a journey from San Francisco to New 
York, how many times would you set your watch ahead one 
hour?

Each belt extends about 74 degrees east and west of its meridian. This 
meridian is exactly 15 degrees from the meridian of the adjoining belt. 
The boundaries of the different belts are irregular because it was found 
more convenient in operating the railroads to change times at certain 
stations.

THE STORY OF UNIT Il 
In Unit I you became acquainted with the earth as a mem- 
ber of the solar system. You found that the composition and 
movements of the earth constantly influence your life. Nature 
has provided many forces and materials which determine how 
you live and what you do every day.

Fig. 29. Life in a Cold Climate 
Far from the equator, where the rays of the sun are always slanting, 
the temperature is cold. Life is very primitive here. Clothing is made 
of skins and furs. On hunting trips the natives often make shelters of 
ice and snow, called igloos. The hunters in this figure are packing snow 
into the cracks between the blocks of ice used to make the shelter. 
No forces of nature affect you more than the weather and 
climate of the region in which you live. Even from the earliest 
days of man’s existence on earth these great forces have de- 
termined man’s dwelling place as well as his activities and mode 
of living. The kinds of plants and animals that exist, the kind 
of food you eat, the clothes you wear, the type of houses in

which you live, the work you do, the way you travel, your 
health, the games you play; in fact, practically everything you 
do and have depends upon the changes in weather and upon 
the climate of your 
environment. 
Of these two fac- 
tors climate is the 
more important to 
you. To appreciate 
this you need only 
to think how differ- 
ent your life would 
be if you moved to 
a different climate. 
Far in the Northyou 
would live like the 
Eskimos (Figure 
29). You would 
dwell in houses of 
ice or in under- 
ground huts, wear 
clothes made of the 
skins of animals 
(Figure 155, Unit 
VJ), and live largely 
on fish and meat.

to a very warm cli- 
mate, you could live

of the Eskimos (Figure 30). And in the temperate regions you 
would find life far different from that in the coldand hot climates.

    38 WEATHER AND CLIMATE 
If you wish to understand these great forces of weather and 
climate, you must remember that the sun furnishes the earth 
with heat. The amount of heat, as you know, varies with 
the angle of the sun’s rays, with the length of day and night, 
and with the condition of the sky. The latitude of a region is, 
therefore, an important factor in determining the temperature 
of aregion. In the far North or far South, where the days are 
short in winter and the sun’s rays strike the earth at an extreme 
slant, the sun gives little heat. The climate and weather 
are cold in such latitudes. Similarly, in the tropical regions, 
where the days are long and the sun’s rays are more nearly 
vertical at all times, the climate and weather are hot. Between 
these two regions the temperate climates exist. Thus you see 
that temperature is one of the important factors of weather 
and climate. 
Now you must not think that temperature is the only 
factor of weather and climate. We may have hot or cold 
climates and hot or cold weather, but we may also have wet 
or dry climates and wet or dry weather. The air is porous, 
much like a sponge. This allows water to evaporate from the 
earth, that is, to change to a gas and mix with the air. How- 
ever, it does not always remain in the air. Sometimes it 
turns to small droplets, forming clouds, or it may fall to the 
earth as rain, mist, snow, or hail. Thus at different times we 
may have clear weather, cloudy weather, and rainy or snowy 
weather. Since the amount of water which evaporates into the 
air and the amount of water which comes out of the air vary in 
different places, you see that a region may have a wet, a dry, 
or a damp climate. 
Though changes in temperature and moisture conditions 
largely determine the climate and weather of a region, there are 
several other factors which must be considered. One of these 
is the altitude of a region. Thus a high mountain has a climate 
and weather unlike that of a valley on either side of the moun- 
tain. Another influence is the presence of large bodies of water 
which may affect both the temperature and the amount of
-P-A-G-E-73

WHY AIR TEMPERATURE VARIES 39 
moisture in the air. For example, the climate of cities on the 
eastern shore of one of the Great Lakes differs noticeably from 
the climate of cities on the western shore, even though they are 
in the same latitude. A third factor is the presence of warm 
or cold ocean currents, as you recall from your study of geog- 
raphy. Still another is the general movement of the air 
on the surface of the earth, and the local movements, or local 
winds. And one more important factor is the nature of the 
surface of the earth. You probably recall, for example, that 
the presence of mountains causes a dry climate in a region on 
the opposite side from which the general winds come. The 
desert region in the southwestern part of the United States is 
a good example of the effect of mountains on climate and 
weather. 
The causes of weather changes and of climate present many 
interesting problems. Let us turn to some of these and learn 
to understand our environment better. 
PROBLEM 1: WHY DOES THE TEMPERATURE 
OF THE AIR CHANGE? 
Probably the most common of all words used to describe 
weather and climate are those which refer to the temperature 
of the air, such as hot, warm, moderate, cool, and cold: 
The sun is the source of the earth’s heat. You recall that 
the sun is the source of the heat which causes changes in 
temperature. (See page 27.) You will also remember that 
the sun does not send heat to the earth, for heat cannot pass 
through an empty space. Since the space between the sun and 
the air covering of the earth contains no material, heat cannot 
come through it. This space is much like that between the 
two walls of a vacuum bottle: most of the air has been removed, 
and therefore little heat is allowed to enter or to get out of the 
bottle. The sun does send waves of light and radiant energy 
through the space between the sun and the earth. It is this 
radiant energy which produces the heat when it strikes the 
air and the surface of the earth.

  40 WEATHER AND CLIMATE 
Experiment 6: How is the earth warmed by the sun? 
Obtain two test tubes. Partly cover one of the test tubes with 
smoke by rotating it in a candle flame. Place the two tubes in 
an upright position (Figure 31) and nearly fill each tube with 
water. Take the temperature of the water in each tube. Now 
bring the tubes into the direct sunlight; leave them there for 15 
minutes. Again take the temperature of the water and record 
the readings. Remove the 
apparatus from the sun- 
light, allow it to stand for 
15 minutes, and take the 
temperature of the water 
in each tube. What do 
the results show? 
Only a part of the ra- 
diant energy from the sun 
changes to heat when it 
passes through a material 
like air, colorless glass, 
or water. But when it 
strikes a material which 
holds it or absorbs it, like

the sun? soil or the black deposit 
on the test tube, much 
of the radiant energy is 
changed to heat. A clean 
windowpane is warmed 
but little by the radiant energy from the sun, but the floor 
inside the room, where the same energy is absorbed, is 
warmed considerably. 
Exercise 1. On a clear day a sidewalk feels warmer than the 
air above it. Explain. 
All materials are not equally warmed by the sun. Let us now 
try to understand how the temperature of the air depends up- 
on the kind of material on the earth’s surface. The light and 
radiant energy from the sun may be transmitted through

transparent materials like glass or air; they may be reflected, 
in part, by water, light-colored materials, or shiny surfaces; 
or they may be almost entirely absorbed by dull, dark-colored 
materials (Figure 32).

Fig. 32. Radiant Energy May Be Reflected, Transmitted, and Absorbed 
The arrows from above represent radiant energy from the sun. The 
air allows much of the energy to pass through it and to strike the different 
materials on the surface of the earth. The arrows pointing upward show 
reflected radiant energy. The length of these arrows shows roughly the 
amount of radiant energy reflected. Which substance becomes hottest on 
the surface? 
Exercise 2. _ Will the same amount of sunshine cause equal 
changes in the temperature of the air above black soil, clay, rocks, 
and sand? Explain your answer. Will these materials lose heat 
at the same rate? (See Experiment 6.) 
If a material is partly transparent, like water, the radiant 
energy goes some distance into the water before it is changed 
to heat. Thus more material must be heated than in cases 
where the energy is nearly all absorbed at the surface. 
Exercise 3. From Figure 32 give one reason why a large body 
of water does not become warm in the spring as quickly as the 
surface of the land around it does. (There are other reasons 
why this is true.) 
A second reason why the air above different materials of 
the earth’s surface varies in temperature is the fact that all 
materials do not change equally in temperature for the same 
amount of heat absorbed. Every kind of material has a different 
capacity for heat. You can think of two different materials of
-P-A-G-E-76
  42 WEATHER AND CLIMATE 
the same weight as two boys of the same size. Compare the 
heat to the amount of food eaten by the two boys, and the 
temperature to the satisfaction which they feel in eating. If 
they eat the same amount of food, one may be but little satisfied, 
while the other may be more nearly satisfied. Similarly, two 
different materials having the same weight may receive the 
same heat from the sun with the result that one becomes but 
little warmer, while the other, which requires only a small 
amount of heat to make it hot, becomes much warmer. 
Exercise 4. Review your study of the problem up to this point 
and state two general reasons why the temperature of the air 
varies. (Remember that the air is heated by contact with the 
surface of the earth.) 
Hours of sunshine and angle of sun’s rays affect temperature. 
Two additional reasons why the air is not at the same tem- 
perature at all times and in all places you will recall from 
Unit I. The first is the length of time during which the sun 
shines. This varies with the condition of the sky and the 
season of the year. The second is the angle of the sun’s 
rays, which depends upon the latitude and which changes 
from hour to hour during the day, and from season to season. 
Altitude must be considered. A fifth cause of difference in 
temperature is the altitude of the earth’s surface. The air 
covering of the earth keeps the heat of the earth’s surface 
from escaping rapidly. It acts like a blanket to hold the heat 
near the surface of the earth. At high altitudes the air is thin, 
and the heat can easily escape as radiant energy. At low alti- 
tudes, such as in deep valleys or near sea level, the air is packed 
more closely together because of the weight of the air above it, 
and the heat cannot escape so rapidly. The temperature is 
about one degree colder, as measured on our ordinary ther- 
mometer, for every 300 feet above the surface of the earth. 
If it were not for the air, the temperature of the earth would 
be so hot during the day, and so cold during the night, that no 
living thing could exist. The earth’s surface would be like the 
moon’s surface, just a mass of rock.
-P-A-G-E-77
  WHY AIR TEMPERATURE VARIES 43 
The five causes mentioned not only determine the tempera- 
ture of the surface of the earth, but they also produce changes 
in the temperature of the air. This is true because the air is in 
constant contact with the earth and receives most of its heat 
from the earth. 
Also, you must bear in mind that the air is constantly mov- 
ing and that the warm or cold air over one place may move to

PROBLEM 2: HOW AND WHY ARE CHANGES IN 
TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR MEASURED? 
Galileo invented the thermometer. In order to get an 
accurate way to measure changes in temperature Galileo, an 
Italian scientist, made the first thermometer, in 1592. (‘“Ther- 
  GOLORED ioeeeee! Lipuip

ject was hotter

or when two 
bodies were 
at the same 
temperature. mometer” comes from two words, thermos, mean- 
ing heat, and meter, meaning measure.) His 
device looked something like the apparatus 
shown in Figure 34. By bringing a hot object 
near the container, the air inside was warmed 
and expanded, driving the liquid down the tube. 
The distance to which the liquid moved indicated 
whether the object was hotter or colder than 
some other object held near the container. The 
instrument was, of course, not very accurate. 
Our present-day thermometers use mercury 
or alcohol. Since Galileo’s time different kinds 
of thermometers have been made. The ones 
which we use today for taking the temperature of 
the air are the mercury and alcohol thermome- 
ters. Usually some coloring matter is added to 
the alcohol so that it can be seen more plainly. 
Exercise 7. Examine a thermometer carefully. 
Is the wall of the upper part of the thermometer 
thick or thin? How large is the tube inside? Does 
it connect with the bulb at the lower end of the 
tube? What part of the bulb and tube is filled 
with the liquid? Why must all air be removed 
from a thermometer? What is the room tempera- 
ture? Warm the bulb with your hand and observe 
whether the thread of liquid in the tube moves. 
Place the bulb in cold water. How does this change the height 
of the liquid? 
Write a paragraph in which you explain how the thermometer 
works. Be sure that you have included the answers to all the 
questions of this exercise.
-P-A-G-E-79
  MEASURING CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE 45 
If you examine different thermometers, you find that they 
are not all marked the same way. There are two common 
scales or methods of marking. OF 
The common thermometer which 
is used in your homes and at the 
Weather Bureau is called the 
Fahrenheit thermometer. It was 
firs; marked by the German 
scientist, Fahrenheit, in 1714. 
In many countries and every- 
where in science laboratories the 
centigrade thermometer is used. 
From Figure 35 you see that 
zero degrees on the centigrade 
(0°C.) is the same as 32 degrees 
on the Fahrenheit (382°F.), and 
that 100° on the centigrade 
(100°C.) is the same as 212° on 
the Fahrenheit (212°F). 
Since there are 180 degrees 
between the boiling and freez- 
ing points of water on the Fah- o 
renheit scale and only 100 degrees Fig. 35. Comparison of Centi- - grade and Fahrenheit on the centigrade scale, one Scales 
degree centigrade is % times as 
big as one degree Fahrenheit. For the same difference in 
temperature there are $ as many degrees on the centigrade 
as on the Fahrenheit or $ times as many on the Fahrenheit 
as on the centigrade. You can change the temperature on one 
scale to the corresponding temperature on the other, thus: 
(a) 212° F. = (212-32) x§ =100° C. 
(b) 100° C. =( x 100) +32 =212° F. 
Exercise 8. Suppose you are in a country where the centigrade 
thermometer is used and the thermometer reads 38°. Find, by 
studying Figure 35, what temperature a Fahrenheit thermometer 
would show. Prove your answer by calculation.

Records of temperature are important. If you go to a 
Weather Bureau station, you may see both the mercury ther- 
mometer and a thermometer called the thermograph (Figure

Fig. 36. A-Recording Thermometer 
Inside the cylinder is a clock which makes the 
cylinder and the record sheet revolve once in a 
week. The metal coil is the thermometer. It 
opens slightly when warmed, causing the pen 
to move upward, and closes when cooled, causing 
the pen to move downward. Thus an irreg- 
ular line is drawn on the sheet, giving a record 
of the temperature for an entire week. 36), which makes 
a record of the 
temperature. Rec- 
ords of the tem-

times and in all 
parts of our coun- 
try are accurate-

These furnish a 
part of the infor- 
mation which the 
Bureau needs to 
predict weather 
and to determine 
the average tem- 
perature of every 
region. In later 
problems you will 
see the great im- 
portance of such 
records. 
PROBLEM 3: WHAT CAUSES CHANGES IN RAINFALL? 
Water evaporates from the earth. Water is always evapo- 
rating from the surface of the earth and going into the air. 
You have often noticed how quickly the streets or roads dry 
after a rain. Soils dry out and become parched in the hot 
sun. Grass and other vegetation dry up in the summer 
time as they lose their water. Everywhere on the earth 
liquid water changes to water vapor and enters the air as an 
invisible gas.
-P-A-G-E-81
  CAUSES OF CHANGES IN RAINFALL 47 
The amount of water which evaporates from the surface of 
the earth depends largely upon the temperature. A plowed 
field, a ball-field, a street, or a tennis court will dry very 
rapidly when the “sun is hot.” 
Experiment 7: Does the rate at which water evaporates into the air 
depend on temperature? 
Place equal amounts of water in two tin cups. Mark accu- 
rately the level of the water in each cup. Stand one in a cool place 
and the other in a warm place (in the sunshine or over a warm 
radiator). On the next day examine each vessel and find if water 
has evaporated. From which vessel has water evaporated the 
more rapidly? Why? 
Water evaporates more rapidly when the temperature is 
high than when it is low. This is true for two reasons: first, 
heat causes water to change to water vapor, and second, 
warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air can. The 
amount of water vapor in the air is spoken of as humidity. 
Air is humid when it contains much water vapor. 
Water vapor condenses when air is cooled. If air which 
contains water vapor is cooled enough, some of the water 
vapor will come out of the air and form liquid water. We 
say that vapor condenses when it changes to a liquid. 
Experiment 8: To cause water vapor to come out of 
the air, or condense. 
Pour a little water into a tin eup or bright metal vessel. Drop 
a few small pieces of ice into the water and stir the mixture. Watch 
the outside wall of the vessel. What do you see? How do you 
explain the result? 
Exercise 9. Explain why drops of water form on the outside of 
a pitcher of ice water when it stands in a warm room. 
Air that is warmed near the surface of the earth is forced 
upward by the colder air around it. As it rises it is cooled, and 
the water vapor condenses into little drops, forming clouds. 
Also, if the winds bring humid air to a cooler region, clouds
-P-A-G-E-82
    
48 WEATHER AND CLIMATE 
are formed. If little condensation takes place, the clouds are 
light-colored, but if there is a great amount of condensation, 
the clouds are dark. The very dark rain clouds which appear 
just before a storm contain many droplets of water. At very 
high altitudes, where it is very cold, the drops may freeze,

forming ice-crystals. Four of the more common kinds of 
clouds are shown in Figures 37, 38, 39, and 40. 
When humid air is cooled to a great extent, much condensa- 
tion occurs. The droplets become so numerous that they 
form into larger drops of mist or rain. Rain drops are too 
heavy to float in the air, and they fall to the earth. Thus it 
often happens that a south wind which contains much water 
vapor brings rain. If the wind comes northward at a con- 
siderable speed, and is forced upward by the cooler air around 
it, it becomes cooler very rapidly. Thus clouds and rain 
may form quickly.

50 WEATHER AND CLIMATE 
Rain drops in falling may pass through layers of air which 
are below the freezing point. The drops may then be frozen 
into pellets and fall to the ground as sleet, or they may be 
carried upward and downward several times by air currents. 
In the latter case on each trip a layer of ice is added until they

around the sun or moon. 
become large hazlstones and fall to the earth. Figure 41 shows 
the appearance of some large hailstones. Figure 42 is a sec- 
tion drawing made from a hailstone cut in half. 
When the temperature of a region where condensation 
occurs is at 0° C. or 32° F., or below this temperature, the 
vapor separates from the air, changing to a solid in the form 
of snow crystals (Figure 43). Of course this can happen only 
during the colder seasons, except at very high altitudes. 
Dew and frost are other forms of water which come from 
the air. When the weather is clear and the night is cool, the

: ee ; earth loses its heat very rapidly. The water vapor in the air 
near the surface of the earth is condensed on the grass or 
ground, or on other materials near the earth. Why? If the 
temperature is above 32° F., the 
vapor condenses, form- 
ing dew, but if the 
temperature is below 
freezing (0° C. or 32°

be deposited as frost.

Note that six seems to be the favorite number for snow. All! of these 
crystals have six sides, six points, or six lines leading out from the center. 
The amount of rainfall varies in different places. From 
your previous study you see that the amount of rainfall must 
depend upon the temperature and humidity of the air. These 
two conditions are very closely related. A high temperature 
on the surface of the earth causes the water in the soil, on 
vegetation, and in the bodies of water to evaporate quickly.
-P-A-G-E-86
    52 WEATHER AND CLIMATE 
At the same time the air in contact with the surface of the 
earth is warmed and can take up more water vapor. When 
such air is cooled, a large amount of rainfall will result. 
Wherever the changes in temperature and humidity are 
great and occur frequently, the rainfall is heavy. The tor- 
rent-like rains of the tropical regions illustrate best the pre- 
ceding statement. Here the surface of the earth and the air 
become greatly heated every day. The warm, humid air rises 
into the cooler layers above, and heavy rains result almost 
every afternoon. These changes in temperature and humid- 
ity may also be brought about by the winds, or movements of 
air along the surface of the earth. For example, a wind blow- 
ing over a warm valley or body of water may become laden 
with moisture, and then move up a mountain slope and become 
greatly cooled, the result being a heavy rainfall. 
The last statement suggests that the nature of the surface 
of the earth is another important factor in rainfall. The 
topography of the earth, that is, the presence of valleys, rivers, 
lakes, mountains, plateaus, oceans, and all other land and 
water forms, influences the temperature and humidity of the 
air. Because the surface of the earth is composed of different 
materials, and because of the differences in altitude, the 
earth is unequally heated by the sun. As the air moves over 
these different regions, its temperature changes. Also, the 
humidity of the air changes because of the amount of evapora- 
tion which may take place over the different regions. Thus a 
warm wind blowing over a warm body of water takes up great 
amounts of water. This air may rise to cooler layers directly 
above; it may be carried by the wind to regions of higher 
altitude; it may be moved to other parts of the surface of the 
earth which are cooler. Such changes produce great rainfall. 
Just as great rainfall depends upon the factors mentioned, 
so does little rainfall depend upon them. When cool air, which 
has lost much of its water vapor, moves to warmer regions, 
it is able to take up more water vapor. In the United States 
you find one excellent illustration of this. As the warm,
-P-A-G-E-87
       
     
      CAUSES OF CHANGES IN RAINFALL 53 
moist air from the Pacific moves over the mountains in its 
eastward movement, it drops much of its moisture in the form 
of rain and snow. As it comes down the eastern slope of the 
mountains, it is warmed, and its capacity for holding water 
is increased. It therefore takes up water vapor from the land, 
producing the vast desert region just east of the Rockies.

PROBLEM 4: WHY DOES THE WIND BLOW? 
You have learned that the movement of air, or wind, is an 
important factor of weather and climate. Wind is always 
changing direction and speed. Sometimes it brings “muggy” 
weather and rain; at other times it gives us cool and fair 
weather; at still other times it carries with it snow or sleet. 
What causes it to move and what determines its speed? 
Air is material. If you consider the properties, or charac- 
teristics, of air, you can explain why the wind blows.

Air seems to have no weight, because it is all around and inside us. 
If we lived in water instead of air, water would seem to have no weight, 
and yet we know it has. So has air. 
Experiment 9: Has air weight? 
Balance a bottle of air, fitted with a very tight stopper, a delivery 
tube, and a bicycle-tire valve, on a meter stick, as in Figure 45, 
or on a good balance. Now pump air into the bottle with a bicycle- 
or automobile-tire pump. Be careful not to change the positions 
of the weight and bottle on the stick. (If a tack is driven through 
the string inio the stick, the position of the bottle will not change.) 
Remove the pump. Does the weight still balance the bottle? 
How do you explain the result?

(a) Tie a piece of dentist’s rubber dam, a piece of a rubber

thistle tube which has a short 
rubber tubing connected to 
the stem (Figure 46). (The top 
of the tube or funnel should be 
ground by rubbing it on sand 
paper until it is level.) Hold 
the apparatus in a vertical po- 
sition with the rubber dam 
facing upward. ‘Suck out’ 
some of the air, and tie a 
string around the rubber tub- 
ing to keep the outside air from 
going back through the tube

side down. Do you find that the force acts in all directions? 
(b) Remove the string from the rubber connection and allow 
the air to enter. What happens? Place some vaseline on a glass 
plate large enough to cover the mouth of the funnel, and hold 
the plate securely against the rubber. Again ‘suck out’’ some air 
and tie the string around the rubber tubing. Does the rubber 
bulge inward? Was the bulging in the first part of the experiment 
due to “suction”? Slide the glass plate aside and note that the 
rubber is forced inward. The force which causes the bulging must 
be from the outside. Why? (If you have an air pump and bladder 
glass [Figure 47], you can show this air pressure in a much more 
striking way.) 
Air pressure is all around you, pushing equally in all direc- 
tions, as the experiment clearly shows. You are not conscious 
of it, because the pressure is the same in all directions and 
because there is air inside your body as well as outside. This 
pressure is due to the weight of the air, and is approximately

of the earth. 
Exercise 13. What is the total force of the air on a garden plot

Differences in air pressure cause winds. It is now easy 
to understand how a diff- 
erence of pressure in diff- 
erent places causes the 
airtomove. If the pres-

pounds on a surface one

some of the air from the

toward the former place,

is great, the movement 
of air from one place to 
another is rapid. Such movement of the air is called wind. 
Changes in temperature cause winds. You recall from 
Problem 1 that the temperature of the surface of the earth 
and the temperature of the air vary greatly in different places. 
Let us see what happens when the temperature of the air 
changes.

Experiment 11: How does the volume of air change 
when heated and cooled? 
Take a test tube and. lower it mouth-downward until the open 
end is just below the surface of water in a glass or pan. Hold or 
clamp the test tube in this position and then warm the tube with a 
flame. What happens? After several bubbles of air have come out 
of the tube, remove the flame and allow the air remaining in the 
tube to cool. What happens as it cools? Answer the question in 
the title of this experiment. 
Experiment 12: Which is heavier for the same volume, 
hot air or cold air? 
Balance a large open-mouthed bottle or flask on a meter or yard 
stick, as shown in Figure 45, page 54. When you have the bottle 
or flask and the weight exactly balanced, bring a flame against the 
bottle or flask, moving the flame back and forth and around the 
container to warm it evenly on all sides. This will warm all of the 
air in the bottle or flask. Note that the end of the meter stick to 
which the bottle or flask is attached has moved upward. Recall 
from Experiment 11 that air increases in volume, or expands, when 
heated. Some of the air has been driven out of the container 
because the air expanded when heated. The weight of the air in 
the container is less when it is hot than when it was cold. . Write 
an answer to the question of this experiment, and explain why 
your answer is correct. 
From Experiments 11 and 12 you see (a) that air expands 
when heated, and contracts, or decreases in volume, when 
cooled; and (6) that cold air is heavier than the same volume 
of warm or hot air. Similarly, when the air over one region 
becomes heated, it expands and becomes lighter than the cold 
air over other parts of the surface of the earth. The cold air, 
being heavier than an equal volume of warm air, is then pulled 
downward by gravity, flows along the surface of the earth to 
the warmer region and under the lighter warm air, and pushes 
the warm air upward. Or we may say that the pressure of 
the air in the cooler region is greater than that in the warm 
region, and the cooler air is, therefore, forced to flow toward 
and into the warm region, causing a wind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
58 WEATHER AND CLIMATE 
Air pressure is measured with a barometer. By knowing 
exactly the pressure at different places, the weather-man can 
predict not only the direction of the wind, but also the speed. 
But there must be some way to measure the pressure accu- 
rately. In the seventeenth century Galileo first suggested that 
air exerted pressure, and sought to 
devise an instrument to measure it. 
He succeeded fairly well by filling a 
long tube, closed at one end, with 
water, and inverting the tube in a tub of 
water. He found that water remained 
in the tube to a height of about 33 to 
34 feet, held there by the pressure of 
the air on the water in the tub outside 
the tube. He also discovered with this 
clumsy instrument that the air pressure 
changed, for the water in the tube did 
not always remain at the same height. 
One of Galileo’s pupils, Torricelli, be- 
came interested in this experiment and 
decided to use mercury instead of water, 
BRerte asanenreeeursice> that the tube would not need to be 
and “meter” means meas- SO long. He knew that mercury is 13.6 
ure. This instrument times as heavy as water and calculated 
measures weather, that is, that a tube about three feet long could one factor of weather, er ? g 
namely, air pressure. be used. The instrument which Torri- 
celli made was the first modern barom- 
eter such as we use today to measure air pressure accurately. 
You can easily make an instrument like this. 
  Fig. 48. A Simple

Experiment 13: To make and use a barometer for 
measuring air pressure. 
Heat one end of a glass tube about three feet long in a flame 
until it melts and closes. When it is cool, fill it with mercury. 
Place your finger over the open end and invert it in a dish of 
mercury (Figure 48). Does the mercury completely fill the tube
-P-A-G-E-93
  
WHY THE WIND BLOWS 59 
after your finger is removed? What is left between the mercury 
and the top of the tube? Measure the height of the mercury in 
the tube above the level of the mercury in the dish. Allow it to 
stand, and measure the height of the mercury column from day 
to day. Explain why this height changes.

Is there any relation between the height of the mer- 
cury and the kind of weather?      
     
  Exercise 15. Why must the space above the mer- 
cury in the barometer be a vacuum, that is, a space 
without anything in it? 
Barometers measure the air pressure in inches 
of mercury. The air pressure on the mercury in 
the dish holds the mercury up in the tube. It acts 
just like a balance. As the air pressure becomes 
less, the mercury fajls until it just balances the air, 
and as the air pressure increases, the mercury is 
forced up until it again balances the air. If you

column which is above the open arm of the tube and which 
extends upward to the top of the air covering of the earth, 
weighs just as much as the mercury in the closed end of the tube. 
Exercise 16. If the air pressure in a certain region is 30.2 inches 
and the air pressure in another region near by is 30 inches, which 
way will the wind blow at a place between these two regions? Make 
a drawing to illustrate this, and explain your drawing.

PROBLEM 5: WHY DO WEATHER CHANGES USUALLY COME

UNITED STATES? 
The prevailing westerlies bring fair and stormy weather. 
The United States is in the belt of prevailing westerlies. This 
is one of the general belts of winds which are always present 
on the surface of the earth. These westerlies, made up of 
large areas of calm weather and areas of stormy weather from 
500 to 1000 miles in diameter, move eastward across the 
country. The area of calm, or high pressure, so called because 
the barometer rises as it approaches, usually brings fair and

Exercise 17, Examine Figure 50. Name the states in which 
the centers of high pressure and low pressure are located. 
In the “high” the air moves downward and outward from 
the center. It becomes warmed as it approaches the earth, and 
can hold more moisture. There is little rain, therefore, in the 
“high” area. The air which moves outward does not go di-

The “low” area is the region of stormy weather, that is, 
cloudiness, rain, snow, or thunderstorms. The air at the center 
of the “low” rises, and the air around the center moves inward 
with a spiral motion, as shown in Figure 51. This spiral mo- 
tion, caused by the rotation of the earth, is exactly opposite

that in the “high.” As the air in the southern half of the 
“low” moves northward, it becomes cooled. Clouds and 
rain often result. (See page 48.) This is particularly true 
of the southeastern quarter of the “low.” Here most rains 
occur and thunderstorms are frequent in the summer season. 
Exercise 18. What changes in temperature, air pressure, and 
sky conditions take place when (1) a “high” approaches, (2) a 
“high” passes, (3) a “low” approaches, (4) a “low” passes? Explain.

or travel at the speed shown. Many conditions of unequal 
heating and local winds interfere with the general movement. 
If it were not for these interferences, it would be easy to predict 
the changes in weather. 
Prediction of weather requires accurate information. In 
order to predict weather the forecaster must have accurate 
reports of all weather conditions in different sections of the 
country. Every morning at eight o’clock over 2000 weather 
stations scattered throughout the United States, the West 
Indies, and Canada, telegraph the weather conditions to the 
Weather Bureau at Washington. These reports give the air 
pressure, the direction and speed of the wind, the temperature, 
the amount of rain or snow, the sky conditions, and the highest 
and lowest temperatures since the report of the day before. 
These facts are then charted on blank weather maps. Three 
of the completed maps are shown in Figures 50, 53, and 54. 
These maps also show the direction and speed of the movement 
of the “low” across the country. 
Exercise 20. Consult the key to the maps, given in Figure 50, 
and state the kind of weather which existed in your region on the 
day for which Figure 50 shows the weather in the United States. 
Include: (1) condition of sky, (2) direction of wind, (3) baro- 
metric pressure, (4) temperature. 
Exercise 21. The United States Weather Bureau gives the 
following statements as aids in predicting weather: 
(a) When the wind sets in from points between south and southeast 
and the barometer falls steadily, a storm is approaching from the west or 
northwest, and its center will pass near or north of the observer within 
12 or 24 hours, with the wind shifting by way of southwest and west. 
(b) When the wind sets in from points between east and northeast 
and the barometer falls steadily, a storm is approaching from the south 
or southwest, and its center will pass near to the south or east of the 
observer within 12 or 24 hours, with wind shifting to northwest by way 
of north. 
(c) The rapidity of the storm’s approach and its intensity will be 
indicated by the rate and the amount of the fall in the barometer. 
Explain the reasons for the facts mentioned in each statement.

made safer, property and lives along rivers are saved, foods 
like fruit and vegetables are kept from damage while they are

safe through the use of these forecasts.

storm signals (Figure 55) are displayed at over 300 stations 
along the coasts of the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, 
and the Great Lakes. Warnings of hurricanes are of special value. 
The farmer depends upon these forecasts to a great extent. 
Frost warnings in fruit districts allow him to provide against

out such warning, cold waves might freeze the buds, blossoms, 
or fruit and destroy the entire crop. Grapes may be picked 
early if a frost is predicted. Raisins may be protected against 
rain. It is estimated that one frost warning alone saved fruit 
growers of Florida over $100,000 in a single night. In the 
summer the forecasts of extremely hot waves are helpful in 
forest regions where foresters take great care to avoid fires.

are saved by the flood warnings of the Weather Bureau. A 
heavy rain at the headwaters of a river may cause a flood farther 
down stream. With proper warning, cities may protect the 
banks against overflowing, and prevent great damage such as 
occurred in Ohio cities a few years ago. Cattle which are being 
pastured on river-bottom land can be driven to safety on higher 
land. People may move out of low sections near the river. 
The railroads and ships are very dependent upon the Weather 
Bureau in the shipment of food products which may be frozen 
by sudden cold waves or spoiled by hot weather. Fruit, 
vegetables, oysters, fish, eggs, soft drinks, and many other 
food-stuffs must be properly protected during shipment. The 
weather forecasts predict what temperatures are to be expected 
during the next few days, and perishable goods can be pro- 
tected by proper covering against the cold wave or by 
proper refrigeration against the hot wave. Produce may be 
hurried to its destination ahead of the change in temperature, 
or shipment postponed until the weather is more favorable. 
The same care must be taken in shipping live stock, meat, 
and many other products. 
Even in city life many activities depend upon a knowledge 
of the coming weather. Our coal supply must be sufficient 
for a cold spell. Gas companies must know of the approach 
of a cold wave so they can furnish more gas, while ice com- 
panies must know of coming hot waves so they may have a 
good supply of ice on hand. Automobile radiators must be 
drained when a cold spell comes or must be filled with an 
“anti-freeze” liquid. Greenhouses must provide against freez- 
ing. Cities must provide additional help for sprinkling streets 
during a hot wave, or for removing snow from streets after 
a heavy snowstorm. 
In recent years a study of the weather in the layers of the 
air far above the surface of the earth has been of value to 
aviation. Flyers must know the conditions of the air through 
which they travel. The famous flight around the earth in 
1924 would never have been possible without a thorough

knowledge of weather conditions. Balloons carrying weather 
instruments to different altitudes have made such knowledge 
possible, by helping to locate good air lanes along which the 
airplanes may travel with the least difficulty and danger. 
Exercise 22. If you were asked to take one side of a debate on 
the question: “Resolved, that the weather forecasts are more 
valuable to the farmers than to city dwellers,’ which side would 
you take? Prepare a five-minute speech for your side. 
An important part of the work of the Weather Bureau is 
the study of climate. Records of weather kept over periods 
of years furnish the data for determining the climate of a 
region. For example, if the records show that the average 
temperature of a region for a long period is low and that the 
total rainfall is light, such a place has a cold, dry climate. 
Conversely, a region with heavy rainfall and a high average 
temperature has a hot, wet climate. You must, of course, 
bear in mind that in the temperate zone the seasons cause 
great changes in temperature and humidity. 
The value of a knowledge of climate may be seen from the 
following statement taken from the pamphlet The Weather 
Bureau, published by the Government Printing Office: 
The miscellaneous climatological data are used in medical and 
scientific studies of the relation of weather to diseases and other 
conditions of health, life, or human pursuits; by railroad companies 
in the adjustment of claims and demurrage charges; by home- 
seekers; by invalids in search of health resorts; by irrigation 
investigators; by contractors and builders in settling labor ac- 
counts; by merchants in studies of the relation of the weather to 
their daily sales; by gas and electric light companies in showing 
their customers the relation of their monthly bills to the varying 
hours of daylight at different seasons of the year; as adequate 
testimony in court proceedings; in dry-farming investigations; 
in life and migration of insect pests; in plans for the development 
of the arid regions; in the preparation of historical records; by 
bond and investment companies in determining the loan values 
of farm lands in newly opened countries; in short, in nearly every 
calling in which the weather plays any part.

THE STORY OF UNIT III 
Before man had learned to understand and use the forces 
and materials of nature, his food supply depended almost 
entirely upon the climate of the region in which he lived. He 
made his home where nature provided enough food to support 
life. Most of his 
time was spent in 
search of something 
toeat. The stream, 
lake, ocean, field, 
and forest furnished 
him with such food 
as he could obtain 
by fishing and 
hunting. Fish, ani- 
mals, berries, leaves, 
stems, roots, and 
seeds made up his 
daily menu. He 
learned what was ‘Underwood and Underwood

food in his neigh- 
borhood became exhausted, he moved on to other places. Each 
day he struggled with nature against starvation. 
When he had discovered the use of fire, he began to cook 
certain foods. This, he found, improved their flavor. For 
a long time he was satisfied to roast his food over an open 
fire (Figure 57), or in the hot ashes. When he learned how to 
use fire in making fireproof vessels of clay, he found another 
method of preparing his food: he was able to stew and boil his 
foods in water (Figure 58). Perhaps he also found that cooked 
foods did not spoil so quickly as raw foods, and thus he was 
able to keep them longer without spoiling.
-P-A-G-E-106
      72 PROVIDING A GOOD FOOD SUPPLY 
One of the important early steps in man’s struggle with 
nature in certain climates took place when he began to tame 
wild animals and keep them as a source of food for the 
long winter months. 
The animals produced 
their young and fur- 
nished him with a 
constant supply of 
animal food. At the 
same time he found 
it necessary to secure 
plant food for the 
animals. This was pos- 
ae é =2\ sible, because by this 
Fig. 58. Stewing Food in a Pot of Water time he had learned to 
cultivate the soil and 
grow certain grain- 
producing plants. He was now a man of property; he began to 
build a more or less permanent home and to live in communities. 
With the growth of population in the community and with 
the establishment of other communities came the need for 
better methods of farming and of exchanging goods. New 
varieties of crops and new animals were raised. An increas- 
ing number of devices to aid in the cultivation of the soil and 
to increase the comforts of home were manufactured. The 
farmer sent his food products to the city, where they were 
sold or stored for future use, and the city dwellers exchanged 
manufactured goods for them. Thus, gradually, there grew 
up our present civilization, in which each community and 
each man takes part in producing, manufacturing, and 
exchanging the foods which are essential to our daily life. 
We see that this great development took place as a result of 
man’s discoveries in his struggle with nature. 
In his study of nature man found that his food supply was 
dependent not only upon the climate but also upon the kind 
of soil. The climate could not be changed; so he directed his Stoves are still unknown in many places.

efforts toward cultivating and improving the land. By 
cultivating the soil in various ways he was able to raise many 
new food-producing plants. By irrigating (Figures 59 and 60),

he made it possible to raise usable plants and animals in regions 
which were until then of little if any value to him. By drain- 
ing he made huge areas of swamp-land into fertile fields. 
By experimenting he produced plants and animals better 
adapted to live in different climates. By fertilizing the soil 
with materials needed for plant growth, he greatly increased 
the productivity of the soil. Government and state experiment 
stations were established to examine the soils, to learn the best 
methods of cultivation for different crops, to find what crops 
are best suited to the soil, to determine the kind of fertilizers 
necessary to keep the soils in good condition, to study methods 
of irrigating and draining, and to devise ways of protecting 
crops against injurious insects and such other living enemies 
as wheat rust, scales on trees, and mildew. With a larger 
supply of plant food, more animals, such as cattle, hogs, sheep, 
and chickens, could be raised. Thus our supply of both plant 
and animal food has been increased by the introduction of 
modern methods of agriculture. 
Along with this knowledge of how to raise plants and ani- 
mals has come an increased knowledge of the kinds of food 
which the human body needs. It has been found that a 
proper food supply must furnish several kinds of materials to 
the body. 
Proteins, contained in such foods as peas, beans, eggs, and 
lean meat, are required to build and repair the body. Carbo- 
hydrates, which include starch and sugar, and which are pres- 
ent in many vegetables and in grains, must be eaten in order 
to supply the energy which keeps us warm and enables us to 
move. Fats, found in vegetable oils, butter, milk, and meats, 
are also needed for furnishing energy and may be stored in 
the body for future use. Mznerals are important as builders 
of bone and other parts of the body, such as the blood. Water 
is also an essential, and is obtained in foods as well as in its 
natural form. Recent investigations have also shown that 
certain foods, such as butter, beef, eggs, milk, and apples, 
contain materials called vitamines, which are necessary for
-P-A-G-E-109
THE STORY OF UNIT III 75 
body health. A knowledge of the uses of these various food 
substances and of the correct proportion of each in our daily 
menu is necessary to everyone who wishes to provide his body 
with the kind and with the amount of food which will keep it 
in a healthy condition. 
Man has made still another important discovery in con- 
nection with his food supply. He has learned why foods 
spoil and how to 
prevent them from 
spoiling. This is of 
great importance to 
all of us today, since 
foods must be shipped 
long distances and 
must be kept for long 
periods of time be- 
fore they are used. 
Having learned that

keep them from spoil- 
ing the food. Their growth may be prevented, or they may 
be killed. Organisms are killed by high temperatures; at 
very low temperatures they cannot grow and produce poisons. 
Thus, drying foods or keeping them cool in refrigerators pre- 
vents the growth of these small organisms, so that the food 
remains in good condition (Figure 61). Similarly, cooking, 
heating, and treating foods with certain chemicals kill the 
organisms. These and other methods of preservation not 
only make it possible for us to keep foods for long periods, but 
they also prevent the entrance into our bodies of disease-pro- 
ducing germs which may be present in spoiled food.

sources which you might add, you find that the principal 
plant foods are fruits, vegetables, and grains from the garden 
or field. Similarly, you see that the important animal foods 
are obtained from cattle, 
hogs, sheep, fowls, and fish.

many of your foods are 
obtained directly from the 
farm. But if you live in

meat per capita has been estimated to be about

food, we can easily see that each of us eats many 
times his weight in

of the plants, various parts of these animals are used. The 
most commonly eaten parts are the flesh, heart, liver, pancreas, 
and brains. Often in the country these animals are killed and 
the meat used as needed, being kept from spoiling by ‘refrig- 
eration, smoking, or salting. In the small town the animals 
are slaughtered by the meat-market man from day to day and 
kept in the refrigerator, so 
that fresh meats may be

and it is estimated that the value of poultry products is equal 
to that of our wheat crops. Because the supply of the animals 
mentioned in this paragraph is more or less limited or because 
the cost of raising and shipping them is great, they are usually 
more expensive than the other meat foods previously discussed. 
Few meals would be complete without one or more animal 
products such as cream, milk, butter, cheese, and eggs. They 
have a very high food value and are therefore economical 
foods. Tremendous quantities of them are produced and 
used each year. For example, the total production of eggs 
in the United States for one year would build a wall of eggs 
thirty feet high and one egg thick from New York to San 
Francisco. New York State alone supplies enough milk in 
a single year to fill a lake one mile long, a quarter of a mile 
wide, and ten feet deep.

All foods come from plants. Although both plants and ani- 
mals are used as sources of our food supply, the green plants 
are really the food factories of the world. They take from the 
soil, water, and air the materials of which our food is com- 
posed. Water and minerals enter the plant through the roots 
and are transported through the stem to the plant leaves 
(Figure 69). Air containing oxygen and carbon dioxide enters 
the leaves through thousands of tiny openings (stomates) in

many small masses of chlorophyll, which has the property of 
using the light energy from the sun in such a way that the 
water and carbon-dioxide gas are changed to carbohydrates. 
During this process, oxygen 
is given off through the sto- 
mates. Since burning, de- 
caying, and breathing take 
oxygen out of the air, this 
action of leaves in giving off 
oxygen is very important in 
that it keeps the necessary 
supply of oxygen in the air.

the various parts of

of these stored ma- 
terials furnish the food for animals and man; others are used by 
the plant in growing. Since animals cannot combine the raw 
products from the soil and air as the green plants do, they must 
eat plants and change them into new animal materials. Thus 
all of our food supply comes directly or indirectly from plants. 
It is also interesting to note that when the plants and animals 
die and decay, the materials of which they are composed be- 
come a part of the soil and air and furnish raw products for 
other growing plants. MAN

WHY DO YOU EAT FOOD? 83 
PROBLEM 2: WHY DO YOU EAT FOOD? 
The body is a complex machine. Two common answers to 
the question of Problem 2 are: (1) “to keep alive,’ (2) “to 
satisfy hunger.’ Neither of these answers explains how the 
body uses food. To give a more scientific answer you must 
consider what becomes of the food which 
. is taken into the body. You must think 
of the body as a complicated machine 
which requires some force or energy to 
keep it in running order and some mate- 
rials to make it grow and keep in repair. 
The body may be compared with a steam 
engine by showing the similarities and 
differences between the two. Both require 
energy to make them move; both work 
best at a certain temperature; both must 
be kept in repair. On the other hand, the 
body can grow and repair itself, two qual- 
ities which the engine does not have. Also, 
the body generates its own power within 
itself, while the engine must be supplied 
with energy, in the form of steam, from 
a boiler outside the engine. Moreover, 
the body is composed of millions of parts 
made of many different materials, whereas 
the engine has relatively few parts, which 
are made almost entirely of iron and steel. 
The body grows.     Fig. 72. A Typical 
Cell 
Your body is made 
of countless millions of 
cells. They are com- 
posed of protoplasm, 
which is the living ma- 
terial in all living 
things. In the center 
is a somewhat denser 
protoplasm, the nucle- 
us. If this is destroyed, 
the cell dies. 
One of the most striking qualities of a 
living thing, like the human body, is its power to grow. Year 
after year during the earlier part of one’s life the body becomes 
larger. This growth comes about through the increase in 
the very great number of minute cells of which the human 
machine is composed. Figure 72 shows the structure of a 
typical cell. The cells which make up the various parts of 
the body are of many different kinds.
-P-A-G-E-120
  84 PROVIDING A GOOD FOOD SUPPLY 
The plant and animal foods which you eat contain the 
materials which the body uses to manufacture the necessary 
cells. As you grow, new cells of all kinds are produced by 
the division of the old cells (Figure 73), and each part of the 
body increases in size. 
Of course, you must 
eat the proper variety 
of foods to supply the 
needed materials. If 
you do, the body 
changes these foods 
into the required hu- 
man materials, and 
you gradually become

cells, each like the parent cell. The nucleus 
divides, forming two nuclei, one for each cell. heat. Have you ever 
tried to start an auto- 
mobile engine on a cold day? And do you recall how the 
engine “sputters” and “coughs” until it is thoroughly warm? 
Perhaps you have also noticed that the engine does not run 
so well when it becomes too hot. Your body is much like 
the engine. It operates best at a certain temperature. Un- 
like the engine, however, the human body is always at the same 
temperature if you are in good health. Very warm or very 
cold air does not change the temperature of the body as it 
does in the case of the engine. The body usually remains at 
98.6° F., its normal working temperature. It is only in case 
of sickness that it may drop much below this point and have 
a sub-normal temperature, or that it may rise considerably 
above 98.6° F. and produce a fever. 
The heat which keeps the body warm is furnished by the 
food which you eat and the oxygen you breathe. In the engine 
the heat required to change the water into steam is produced 
by the combination of the oxygen gas in the air with the
-P-A-G-E-121
  WHY DO YOU EAT FOOD? 85 
fuel. In the body, oxygen is taken into the lungs when you 
breathe. This oxygen passes through the thin walls of the tiny 
blood vessels in the lungs and gets into the blood (Figure 74). 
The blood is then sent back 
to the heart, which pumps it 
through the rest of the body. 
The food you eat is also taken 
into the blood and transported 
through the body. As the blood 
circulates, it is constantly giving 
up food materials and oxygen to 
cells that need them. The food 
may be manufactured into new 
cells or used to repair old cells, 
or it may be stored for future 
use. 
The different cells and food 
materials stored by the body 
are “burned” by the oxygen, 
producing heat. This type of 
“burning” is so slow that no 
flame is present as in the case 
of coal or wood. It is called 
slow oxidation. The heat given 
off by the oxidation of the cells 
and food materials keeps the 
body warm. Producing heat 
to keep the temperature of 
the body uniform is, therefore, 
another use of food. 
Food furnishes energy for 
bodily activities. Some part of   
  Fig. 74. How Oxygen is Carried 
to All Parts of the Body

rom the heart, and the veins

your waking hours you are active doing such things as

ing, and seeing. In your sleep you breathe, your heart

  86 PROVIDING A GOOD FOOD SUPPLY 
continues to pump blood, and various other activities are 
going on inside your body. Every one of these activities 
requires some force or energy to produce it. This energy 
is supplied by the slow oxidation which is constantly 
taking place in the cells. The proper energy-producing food 
materials must therefore be present in every active part of the 
body. 
How this energy is produced will, perhaps, be clearer by 
further comparing the body with the engine. In order to 
make the engine move, steam is needed. The energy of the 
steam comes from the heat produced by burning coal. The 
heat energy is first changed to the energy, or force, of steam. 
This, in turn, drives the engine and gives it energy of motion, 
which may be used to pull a train, saw wood, or run a dynamo. 
Similarly, in the body the energy produced by oxidation of 
the cell materials may be used to move any number of the 
more than five hundred different muscles, to send nerve 
messages throughout the body, or to think. There are, how- 
ever, two important differences here between the engine and 
the body. The fuel is outside the engine, while the body uses 
fuel within itself; also, the fuel for the engine is not made 
of the same material as the engine, but the fuel of the body is 
part of the body itself. There is, then, a third reason why 
you eat, namely, to produce the energy which makes the activ- 
ities of life possible. 
The body must be kept in repair. When a steam engine 
is used, its parts become worn or broken. These must be 
repaired or replaced by new parts. Likewise the cells which 
make up the body are constantly being worn out. Every 
time you wink your eye, sit down, get up, think, look, listen, 
or move any part of the body, certain cells are destroyed. 
These must be replaced. Food materials are required to 
rebuild the worn parts. The human machine changes the 
food into living material and repairs the damage done. This 
wonderful power of repair in the human body is shown strik~ 
ingly in the case of broken bones or serious cuts. With the
-P-A-G-E-123

broken ends of bones or the cut parts held together by band- 
ages, new cells grow (Figure 73, page 84,) and in a short time 
the damage is repaired. 
You may summarize the answer to Problem 2, then, by giving 
four reasons for eating food: (1) to furnish material for growth, 
(2) to supply the heat which maintains the temperature of 
the body, (3) to produce the energy required by various activi- 
ties, and (4) to keep the body in repair. Perhaps one other 
use of food might be mentioned, namely, storage for future 
use. When more food than is necessary for the four purposes 
given is taken into the body, some of it may be stored. 
Exercise §. Explain why people eat more in winter than in 
summer. 
Exercise 6. Bears find a convenient hole to rest in during the 
winter and eat no food during that time. How do they keep 
alive? 
Exercise 7. Why does hard work or strenuous exercise increase 
your hunger? Why do you breathe more rapidly during such 
work or exercise? 
PROBLEM 3: WHAT KINDS OF FOOD SHOULD YOU EAT? 
You have seen that food not only satisfies your appetite, 
but that it serves four important purposes in the body. In 
order to serve these purposes several kinds of food materials 
are essential. It therefore becomes necessary for the chemist 
to analyze the different kinds of foods, that is, to determine 
what food materials they contain, so that people may be able 
to select a proper diet. 
Experiment 16: How can the presence of starch, sugar, 
protein, fat, and minerals in foods be shown? 
1. Starch 
(a) Cut a thin slice of potato. Place it in water and scrape 
it with a knife. Remove the potato slice and boil the scrapings 
in the water. Test for starch with iodine solution. (Tincture of 
iodine, which can be obtained at a drug store, may be used.) 
Result? Add only a few drops of the iodine.
-P-A-G-E-124
  88 PROVIDING A GOOD FOOD SUPPLY 
(b) Other materials, such as beans, peas, oatmeal, rice, crackers, 
and bread, can also be tested for starch. Make a paste of the ma- 
terial by grinding it in a little cold water. Then add hot water, 
mix thoroughly, and allow to cool. Test the mixture with iodine. 
Record whether or not starch is present. 
2. Sugar 
(a) Grind some raisins and add a little water. Allow the solid 
materials to settle, and then pour off the liquid into a test tube. 
Add about one cubic centimeter (1 ¢.c.) of Fehling’s solution to 
the liquid, and boil. A yellow-red céolor shows the presence of 
grape sugar. (Fehling’s solution may be obtained at any drug store.) 
(b) Test other foods as directed in (a), and record your results. 
3. Protein 
(a) Place a small portion of the white of an egg in a test tube 
and add a little water. Then add 5 c.c. of nitric acid and heat 
gradually to boiling. Allow the solution to cool, pour off the acid, 
and add 10 c. c. of ammonium hydroxide. <A deep orange color shows 
the presence of protein. 
(6) Test other materials, such as meat, flour, and bread, and 
record your results. 
4. Fat 
(a) Rub a small piece of lard or butter on a sheet of glazed paper. 
Hold the paper over a flame until the butter melts, and then hold 
the paper up to the light. The spot made by the butter becomes 
translucent; that is, it allows light to pass through the paper. 
(b) Test peanuts for fat by crushing them in a mortar and then 
rubbing the powder on thin paper. 
(c) Test other materials for fat. (Unless fat is present in large 
quantities, it is very difficult to detect it by these methods.) 
5. Minerals 
(a) Obtain a small piece of bread and heat it at a high tempera- 
ture until all of the materials which will burn have disappeared. 
The remaining material, ashes, is composed of minerals. 
(6) Heat a beaker or dish of water until the water is completely 
evaporated. Note the white solid material left on the sides of the 
beaker. These are minerals which remained in the beaker after the 
water had evaporated. 
(c) Test other food materials for minerals as directed in (a).

Place a + sign in the proper column to the right of the food 
if your tests show that starch, sugar, protein, or fat is present. 
If the test does not show the presence of starch, sugar, protein, 
or fat, place a — sign in the proper column. 
Proper diet depends upon climate. The climate of a region 
not only governs the kinds of food which are available, but it 
also determines the kind of food man should eat. In the 
frigid Arctic regions, for example, the supply consists largely 
of animal foods, for few plants grow in very cold climates. 
Moreover, the temperature of the air is much lower than that 
of the body, and the body loses a great deal of heat. This 
makes it necessary to eat foods which will produce a large 
amount of heat, and explains why fatty foods are used in great 
quantity by inhabitants of Arctic regions. 
In warm climates, like the tropics, many plant foods are to 
be had, and the body needs little heat-producing food. There- 
fore few fatty foods are eaten there. The climate of our own 
country makes possible an abundant supply of both plants and 
animals. Since the climate varies with the season of the year, 
it is necessary to select the proper amount of heat-producing 
foods during the different seasons. Thus you eat more foods 
containing carbohydrates and fats in the winter than in the 
summer. Throughout the year in any climate you need, of 
course, the other kinds of food for the growth and repair of the 
human machine. 
Proper diet depends upon your activities in life. Have 
you noticed that you become very hungry after a strenuous 
game or after several hours of hard physical work? Your appe- 
tite is nature’s signal that food is needed. The physical exer-  
-P-A-G-E-126
  90 PROVIDING A GOOD FOOD SUPPLY 
tion tears down the muscle cells and uses up the stored supply 
of food. More food is needed to repair the cells and to 
restore the energy of the body. Since, as you recall, proteins 
are needed to rebuild the cells, your body requires that you 
select some foods which contain this food material, as well as 
other kinds of food. Without proteins

eon 6% The living substance in the cells is 
called protoplasm. It looks much like

posed of several simple substances, or 
elements. Everything in the world, 
_ living and non-living, is composed of 
Oxygen(65%) these elements, 85 of which are known. 
They are called elements because they 
have never been separated into simpler 
substances. The principal ones which 
2 are necessary to build protoplasm are Fig. 75. Percentage of the z Important Elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen

These clementsarecon- Of the same elements and can furnish 
tained in the water you the necessary materials to rebuild the 
cue and the food you cells which are worn out so rapidly by 
the bodily activities. You see, there- 
fore, that meats, fish, eggs, milk, and other protein foods must 
be eaten at all times, but that such foods should be consumed 
in larger quantity when one is engaged in vigorous physical 
work or in sports that involve strenuous exercise. 
There is, however, always the danger of eating too much 
protein. It is often the case that boys and girls eat so much 
protein food at one meal that their appetite is satisfied, and 
they take little of fats and carbohydrates. This is undesirable 
for several reasons. First, without carbohydrates and fats 
the protein food must furnish fuel as well as repair materials. 
This is not economical, because the common protein foods are    100%
-P-A-G-E-127
PROPER KINDS OF FOOD 91 
usually the more expensive. Second, the protein foods are 
not so easily digested as the carbohydrates and fats, and 
produce more harmful waste materials. Such practice, there- 
fore, puts an extra strain on the digestive apparatus of the 
body. Also, the kidneys and liver must work overtime to free 
the body from the unnecessarily large amount of wastes. 
You should gain the idea from the preceding paragraph that 
a variety of foods makes up a well-balanced diet. There should 
be enough of each kind of food in the daily menu, or diet, 
to serve all purposes. This is particularly true in the city, 
where much of our time is spent in school or in the office, and 
where the proper amount of physical exercise is not always 
secured. Such sedentary, or physically inactive, life and the 
present-day condensed or concentrated foods are likely to 
produce constipation. If the bowels are not kept free from the 
harmful wastes by daily or more frequent movements, these 
wastes produce poisonous materials which cause digestive dis- 
orders. Thus you need vegetables and fruits and certain min- 
erals, all of which promote the bowel movements and _pre- 
vent constipation. Many of the vegetable foods, like whole- 
wheat bread, unpeeled potatoes, peas, and beans, are the most 
economical sources of protein, and contain the proper pro- 
portion of protein and the other food materials. 
Proper diet depends upon age, weight, and height. Age is 
an important factor in selecting food. Young people who are 
growing rapidly require a larger amount of food in proportion 
to their weight than older people. The former need to build 
many new cells in growing, while the latter need only to repair 
the torn-down cells. Also, younger people are usually more 
active and therefore require more energy-producing food. 
Probably you have often been reminded of the fact that you 
eat more food than do older members of your family. This 
is reasonable at a certain age. You should not, however, 
overeat just to satisfy your appetite, for your appetite is not 
always a safe index of the amount of food which the body
-P-A-G-E-128
  92 PROVIDING A GOOD FOOD SUPPLY 
should have. You may leave the table hungry and still have 
eaten all your body requires. 
The amount of food which you require depends also on 
your size, that is, your height and weight. Table III shows 
the correct weights of boys and girls of different ages and 
different heights. Examine the table and compare your 
weight with that given for your age and height. If your 
weight is only a few pounds above or below the figure given 
for your age and height, it is not a serious matter. If, how-

ever, you are more than 15 pounds underweight, your diet 
should be improved. On the other hand, considerable over- 
weight means that you are too fat. This should lead you to 
exercise more, and eat less of those foods which produce fat, 
such as sugar, fats, and starch. Candy and ice-cream are two 
such fat-producing foods which you should avoid. By guard- 
ing against your appetite and by taking the proper exercise 
you may do much to reduce your weight and figure to 
normal. You should have some expert, like the doctor or the 
home-economics teacher, determine your diet. Some sample 
meals planned by experts are shown in Figures 76, 77, and 78.

is equal to the weight of approximately 1 quart of water, or 
2.2 lbs.) Or it may be defined as the quantity of heat required 
to raise the temperature of one pound of water about four 
degrees Fahrenheit. You can think of the calorie as the 
amount of heat from a gas flame which will warm a pound 
of water (about one pint) four degrees as measured with the 
ordinary household thermometer. By careful experimenting 
it has been found that one gram of each of the following kinds 
of food produces, when burned, or oxidized, in the body, the 
number of calories shown: 
(a) 1 gram of protein produces 4.1 calories. 
(6) 1 gram of carbohydrate produces 4.1 calories. 
(c) 1 gram of fat produces 9.1 calories. 
From these figures it is easy to determine the fuel value of 
a meal. All that you need to know is the percentage of pro- 
tein, carbohydrate, and fat in each of the foods, and the weight 
of each kind of food which you eat. It would, of course, be 
very inconvenient and practically impossible in the home 
to determine the exact fuel value of each food which you eat, 
and thus select the correct amount of food for its fuel value. 
Scientists have done this for all foods. People who know how 
much food they need to keep in good health can, therefore, 
select foods of the proper fuel value. 
The fuel value of foods required by different persons varies 
according to the factors already discussed, such as climate, 
age, physical exertion, and size. Standards have been worked 
out by experts in this field. A man doing moderately active 
muscular work requires about 3500 calories per day; a man 
doing light muscular work and a boy of 15 require about 3150 
calories per day; a man at sedentary occupation, a woman at 
moderately active work, a boy from 13 to 14 and a girl from 15 
to 16 years of age require about 2800 calories per day; a woman 
at light work, a boy 12, and a girl from 13 to 14 years of age 
require about 2450 calories; a boy from 10 to 11 and a girl 
from 10 to 12 years of age require about 1800 calories per day. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  96 PROVIDING A GOOD FOOD SUPPLY 
Of course, these standards are not to be considered exact for all 
people, but they furnish a guide by means of which we may 
regulate our daily diet. 
Though you cannot measure the number of calories you re- 
quire, you can see from this study that it is sensible to think 
about the fuel value of your food. Figure 80 shows the fuel 
value as well as the composition of some common foods. You 
can determine approximately the amount of food which makes 
you feel best, and then eat accordingly, knowing that over- 
eating to satisfy an excessive appetite does you harm instead 
of good. Overfeeding the body is much like overfeeding a 
gasoline engine with a mix- 
ture which is too rich. It 
reduces the power of the 
machine and soon puts it 
out of running order.

which prepare the food for the body’s use, and in other ways

some minerals, but the principal supply comes from water, 
milk, and vegetables. Drinking water, as well as that con- 
tained in vegetables and fruits, carries with it minerals from 
the soil and rocks over which it passes before you use it. Since 
these minerals are a necessary part of one’s bodily nourishment, 
your food must be selected so that you obtain a sufficient 
supply of them. 
Certain substances called vitamines are necessary parts of 
a proper diet (Figure 79). Several kinds of these substances 
are known, all of which are required to keep the body growing

is present to a considerable amount in milk, cod-liver oil, 
butter, eggs, and vegetables like lettuce and spinach. Another 
kind, known as Water Soluble B vitamines, occurs in milk, yeast, 
most vegetables, and in cereals made of whole grains. A third 
kind, Water Soluble C vitamines, is most abundant in fresh 
fruits and vegetables. Table IV shows the presence of these 
substances in some common foods. 
The body requires a balanced diet. From the previous dis- 
cussion you see that there should be considerable variety in 
your foods. A satisfactory diet requires that you eat such 
foods as will provide the correct proportion of fats, carbo-

should drink plenty of water.

Water is necessary. Water is quite as necessary to the 
body as the foods which have been discussed. Though it does 
not oxidize to produce heat and energy, it does serve many 
purposes. First, it contains certain minerals which the body 
needs. Second, it helps to digest the food. Third, it makes 
it possible for digested food and blood to be carried to all parts 
of the body. Fourth, by means 
of the urine and perspiration it 
carries the waste products from 
the body, and fifth, it keeps the 
wastes of the bowels moist so that 
they can be removed. Doctors 
advise that every person drink 
at least six glasses of water a 
day.

what difference mere cooking makes in the taste of certain foods. 
Also by cooking, many foods may be better seasoned, and ap-

they appear as in Figure 81. After they are cooked in boiling 
water or in the oven for a short time, they change their appear-

ance as shown in Figure 82. The cell walls around the starch 
grains are broken open. This. allows the saliva in the mouth 
to come into more direct contact with the starch and to change 
it to sugar, which is one step in digestion. Cooking meat 
softens the fibers and tissues which hold it together. This 
allows the meat to be more easily cut and ground by the teeth 
before it is swallowed. The di- 
gestive juices in the stomach can 
then act on it more easily.

(c) Boil a small piece of beef in water for thirty minutes. 
Compare the boiled beef with raw beef. In what ways has it been

  The action of heat on raw foods is brought about by five 
common methods: (1) cooking in hot water—boiling or stew- 
ing; (2) cooking in the hot air in the kitchen oven or over 
a camp fire—baking or roasting; (3) cooking in the flames or 
directly over the fire—broiling; (4) cooking in hot fat or grease— 
frying; (5) cooking in steam—steaming. 
The proper use of these different methods is a science and 
an art which have been studied for many years. Much food 
is made indigestible and useless to the body by improper cook-

ing. The best directions for cooking are contained in good 
cook-books, which should be consulted by one who does not 
know the principles of preparing food for eating. 
Exercise 12. Consult a good cook-book to find as many impor- 
tant principles of cooking as you can, and make a list of them. 
After each give a reason for the method used. 
Your list will include the following, which are 
given as samples to show you what is wanted: 
1. The method of cooking which makes food 
most appetizing and digestible is the best method, 
because the body can then get the greatest value 
from it. 
2. Some vegetables should not be cooked for a 
long time, because the vitamines are destroyed. 
8. Some vegetables should be cooked in open 
vessels, because this allows........ (complete this 
and then add others), etc.

chine (Figure 83), is always a source of 
danger. Uncooked beef may carry into the human body tape- 
worms, as well as the germs which cause tuberculosis and 
foot-and-mouth disease. Proper cooking or heating will destroy 
these harmful living things and make the food safe. 
There is another way in which cooking may make foods 
safe. Certain organisms in the food cause the food to spoil. 
During the spoiling or decay, poisons may be produced. These 
poisons, taken into the body with the spoiled foods, may 
cause what is commonly called ptomaine poisoning. Proper 
cooking of the fresh food destroys the organisms and thereby 
keeps the food from spoiling and free from poisons. The heat 
may also destroy the poisons in spoiled food, but it is not a 
safe policy to depend upon this.

Exercise 14. Make a list of cooked foods which you eat, and 
after each state the method of cooking generally used. Which is 
the most common method? Why is this so? 
PROBLEM 5: HOW ARE FOODS KEPT FROM SPOILING? 
Foods must be protected from living organisms. Raw foods, 
whether from plants or animals, must be properly cared for 
or they begin to spoil, or decay, in a short time. Millions of 
dollars’ worth of food is wasted.every year on account of care- 
less handling. To prevent this decay the food must be pro- 
tected against the living organisms which get into it and change 
its composition. This change is called decomposition, for the 
materials in the food-stuff are really broken up, forming new 
materials. These give the food a bad taste or a bad odor, and 
often cause it to become poisonous. 
How harmful organisms get into food was a mystery for a 
long time. But gradually it became known that three kinds 
of organisms may come from the air, as shown by the following 
experiment. 
Experiment 18: To show that living organisms may get 
into exposed foods. 
(a) Moisten a slice of bread. Expose it for a half-hour and 
then place it in a fruit jar or dish. Cover the jar or dish so that 
the bread will remain moist, and keep it in a warm place. Examine 
it from day to day. At the same time put into another jar a slice 
of fresh unmoistened bread. Compare the two slices of bread for 
at least a week. What do you conclude? 
(b) Make one pint of a solution of corn syrup or molasses, 
using about one-tenth as much syrup as water. Divide this into 
three portions. Place one portion in an open vessel in the ice-box. 
Put the second portion in a vessel and boil it for a half-hour; 
then cover the vessel air tight and set it in a warm place. Leave 
the third portion in an open vessel in a warm place. Examine the 
different solutions from day to day. Can you explain the results?
-P-A-G-E-140
  104 PROVIDING A GOOD FOOD SUPPLY 
Usually two kinds of plant growths appear on moist bread, 
molds and bacteria. There are many varieties of each. You 
may observe at least two molds on the bread. The most 
common is the cotton-like material covered with black dots, 
called bread mold 
(Figure 84). An- 
other common vari- 
ety is the blue mold. 
If you examine 
these molds under 
the microscope, 
you will see that 
Fig. 84. Bread Mold they bear. spore cups containing 
hundreds of spores (Figure 85). Each of these spores, like 
seeds, can produce a new plant when it comes into contact 
with warm, moist food, on which it can grow. Here and there 
on the bread you may see other spots where the bread becomes 
yellow or discolored, and 
pasty. Some of these are 
caused by bacteria (Figure 
175, page 200). The bac- 
teria also produce spores, 
but not in the same way as 
the molds. These spores of 
bacteria and molds are so 
small that they may be car- 
ried in the air and thus get _—‘Fig. 85. Spore Cups and Spores of

and worthless. 4 
While mold may appear on the warm exposed syrup solu- 
tion used in Experiment 18, there will also be seen small 
bubbles of gas rising from the solution. In time the syrup will 
smell sour. These changes are caused by yeasts. Under the 
   
-P-A-G-E-141
      KEEPING FOODS FROM SPOILING 105 
microscope they appear something like Figure 86. These 
plant organisms feed on the sugar and change it to alcohol 
and carbon-dioxide gas. This process is called fermentation. 
The gas causes the bubbles 
which you see. The alcohol is 
changed to vinegar (acetic 
acid), which causes the sour 
odor and taste after it has 
stood for several days. 
  Exercise 15. From Experiment 
18 and your reading explain sev- 
eral ways by which foods might 
be prevented from spoiling. These microscopic plants cause 
fruits and fruit juices to ferment. Fig. 86. Yeast Plants

riers. It is clear that care in keeping food free from decay is 
absolutely essential, to our pocketbooks and to our health. 
There are five important ways to keep food from spoiling. 
First, proper handling and storing of food are necessary. A 
few illustrations will suggest to your minds many things which 
you can do to keep food pure. Foodstuffs should be kept 
covered, particularly in the market, the restaurant, the fruit 
stand, and the home (Figures 87 and 88). In picking and 
marketing fruit or vegetables, nature’s covering, such as the

What is wrong with the meat market shown in this picture? 
peel, or skin, or husk, should not be broken or cut. Potatoes, 
turnips, beets, and other vegetables should not be stored in 
moist, warm places. Milk should be protected by sanitary 
milking, by shipping in clean cans, by using absolutely clean 
bottles, and by pasteurization. 
Experiment 19: How is milk pasteurized? 
(a) Fill a test tube half full of milk. Place the test tube of 
milk in a beaker of water (Figure 89), and heat the beaker with 
a small flame. Take the temperature of the water in the beaker
-P-A-G-E-143
  KEEPING FOODS FROM SPOILING 107 
and regulate the flame so that the temperature will remain at 
144°F. Heat for 30 minutes at this temperature. 
(b) Plug the tube of milk with a little cotton and set it aside. 
Fill another test tube half full of unpasteurized milk and set it 
aside with the pasteurized milk. Taste the 
milk in both test tubes every day for several 
days. Which milk remains sweet longer? 
You can pasteurize milk at home by 
using the apparatus shown in Figure 90... 
To do this you will need an iron pail fitted 
with a false bottom. This false bottom 
may be made by obtaining a piece of tin 
slightly larger than the bottom of the pail 
and cutting several holes through it. The 
false bottom is necessary to prevent the 
bottles from breaking. Fill the pail with 
water so that the level is about the same 
as that of the milk in the bottles, and heat 
to a temperature of 144°F. ” Fig. 89; ‘Pasteurizing

Exercise 16. Make a list of different ways

Second, foods ‘may be preserved by 
cooking and canning. The bacteria, 
yeasts, and molds are killed by being 
heated to a high. temperature. Thus 
fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat are 
cooked in boiling water, and while hot, 
packed in cans, or they may be placed

Home Pasteurization and kills the germs. The cans are sealed 
with paraffin or with other air-tight 
covers to prevent new organisms from entering. This also keeps 
out air, which is necessary for growing organisms. Meats are 
often cooked (fried or roasted), placed in jars, and covered

  108 PROVIDING A GOOD FOOD SUPPLY 
with hot lard which, when cool, protects the meat from spoil- 
ing. Often sugar or salt is added to season the food and to 
help preserve it. 
Exercise 17. Consult a cook-book and give the best ways to 
can or preserve cooked foods. For example, cherries: place in 
jars with correct amount of sugar; put the jars in hot water for 
40 minutes, seal while hot, and stand jars upside down until cold. 
Third, foods may 
be preserved by add- 
ing certain chemicals 
which prevent the 
growth of organisms. 
This practice is not 
objectionable if the 
preservatives them- 
selves are not poisons. 
Sugar, spices, salt, and 
vinegar are often used 
in home canning and 
are not dangerous.

You can’ under- 
stand, then, why dried fruit. vegetables, and meat are not 
easily spoiled. 
Exercise 20. List different foods that are dried to keep them 
from spoiling. (Ask your grocer.) 
Fifth, organisms can be kept from growing by keeping food 
at a low temperature (Figure 91.) 
In the home the refrigerator is 
used for this purpose. The air 
in the refrigerator circulates, as 
shown in Figure 92, and, as long 
as ice is present, the food is kept 
cool. Many foods must be shipped 
in refrigerator cars (see Figure 61). 
When uncanned food is stored for 
any length of time, it is kept in cold 
storage rooms. Also, many canned 
foods are placed in cold storage. 
Exercise 21. Make a section drawing 
of your home refrigerator. Indicate 
the direction of air currents by arrows 
after you have carefully examined the 
construction of the interior. Explain 
your drawing. (See page 57.)

that it is hard to realize that there are only three necessities 
without which life cannot exist: air, water, and food. Studies

but many cities must go long distances to get a sufficient 
amount. Table V shows the enormous quantity of water 
needed to supply certain large cities.

population, new sources of supply must be discovered in order 
to meet the needs of everyone. 
Many cities have an abundant supply of water, but no

parts of the city, a system of pipes, or mains, is laid, sufficient 
in size to meet the needs of the locality served (Figure 95). 
But with the increase in population and business, buildings 
are made higher and set closer together, and thus a larger 
number of people are crowded into a given district. The old 
mains, therefore, must be replaced by larger ones, capable of 
delivering a larger volume of water. The demand for water 
varies with the time of the day (Figure 96). During some 
parts of the day many systems cannot pump enough water to 
meet the require- 
ments; as a re-

  supply sufficient 
water for fighting fires, and they also furnish a reserve to meet 
the needs during the rush hours of the day. 
Another requirement of a good water supply is that the 
water be pure. Water which is obtained from shallow wells 
is frequently impure because surface impurities seep into 
the well. Streams become polluted by materials which wash 
into them from the banks, or by the sewage of cities. Water 
obtained from these unsafe sources contains germs which 
are responsible for typhoid fever and other diseases. In 
cases where the source of water is unsafe, it is necessary to 
provide some method of removing the germs and other im- 
purities. 
A very desirable feature of a good water supply is that the 
water be soft; that is, it should not contain certain minerals
-P-A-G-E-151
THE STORY OF UNIT IV 115 
dissolved in it. Soft water is especially desirable for launder- 
ing, because it requires but little soap to make good suds. 
When hard water is used in boilers to make steam, the minerals 
remain in the boilers and form a deposit called “boiler scale.” 
This scale causes the boiler to heat unequally, and also increases 
the amount of fuel required to heat the water. For these rea- 
sons it is very desirable that the water be soft if it is used for 
home and industrial purposes.

of a good water supply which have already been mentioned, 
we must add the requirement that it be cheap enough so that 
all can use it. Securing a good water supply is a problem 
which involves the consideration of many factors and requires 
the advice and skill of experts. One of the clearest signs of a 
progressive community is a plentiful and wholesome water 
supply as well as an efficient method of distribution.

116 OBTAINING A GOOD WATER SUPPLY 
PROBLEM 1: WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT SOURCES 
OF WATER? 
Our water supply is dependent upon the rainfall. There 
are two principal sources of water supply, surface water and 
ground water. Both of these sources of supply are dependent 
upon the rainfall. When rain, or any other form of water, 
strikes the ground, one of three things may happen to it: it 
may run off into streams, lakes, or ocean; it may sink into the

ground; or, it may evaporate into the air. A light rain falling 
in the forest or upon grass lands may nearly all soak into the 
soil. A heavy rain falling on the same land will run off, in 
part, into nearby streams. The heaviness of the rainfall, the 
amount of vegetation, the slope of the land, the temperature 
of the air, the kind of soil upon which the rain falls, all deter- 
mine what happens to the water. We are interested in the 
part which flows into the streams and that which sinks into 
the soil, because this furnishes our water supply. 
We obtain water from many sources. Probably the most 
satisfactory source of water supply is that furnished by moun- 
tain lakes and streams. The water obtained from these 
sources is generally pure, and, if obtained from high up in

the.mountains, it is not necessary to use pumps to bring it to 
the city and force it through the mains. New York City, 
not situated in a mountainous district, has bought over 900 
square miles of mountainous 
land and has constructed 
reservoirs to collect the water 
which falls upon this area. 
Rivers furnish an abundant 
supply of water, but in most 
instances it must be purified 
before it can be used. In some 
cases the water is pumped di- 
rectly from the river to settling 
basins (Figure 97) where the 
impurities are removed. In 
other cases wells are sunk along 
the banks of the river, and

  118 OBTAINING A GOOD WATER SUPPLY 
In the sources of water which we have discussed, the supply 
has been kept up largely by that part of the rain which flows 
off. The part which sinks into 
the ground furnishes another 
source of supply, which we obtain 
by sinking wells. The rain which 
soaks through the soil sinks until 
it reaches solid rock and can go

above the rock. This part of the

IMPORTANT SOURCES OF WATER 119 
Exercise 1. Figures 101 and 102 show two shallow wells. Which 
furnishes the safer source of water? Why? Refer to Experiment 20. 
Deep wells furnish us with pure water. Water sometimes 
seeps into the solid-rock layer through cracks and crevices 
and enters porous layers of rock, 
like sandstone, underneath. The 
water, having passed through a 
great depth of soil, is thus freed 
from impurities. Now, if we sink a 
well by driving a pipe through the 
soil and non-porous rock into the 
porous-rock layer, water will rise 
in the pipe to the level of the top 
of the water table. This type of 
well is called a deep well, or driven == =a 
well, Wells of this type are much LULL

Water enters the porous sandstone layer where it comes to the surface. 
In one place a layer of porous rock may come to the surface, and in another

Exercise 2. Which of the sources of water 
mentioned in this problem will best meet the 
five requirements of a good water supply for

which you have given for rural communities 
will not meet the requirements for a city

Exercise 3. Describe the source of your 
local water supply. 
PROBLEM 2: HOW DO PUMPS WORK? 
The lift pump uses air pressure. The 
common pumps 
which are used 
to raise water 
from wells are 
called lift pumps 
the water out of 
tight in the cylinder, is moved up mien ca 
and down by the piston rod when 
the pump handle is forced down and i i HE i 0 
  up. A valve (Valve 1) is placed in a 
the shaft just below the pump Fig. 105. A Lift Pump 
cylinder. There is also a valve 
(Valve 2) in the piston. An experiment will make clear the 
construction and operation of the pump.
-P-A-G-E-157
  HOW PUMPS WORK 
Experiment 21: How is a lift pump constructed and operated? 
  121 
(a) Obtain a glass tube one or two inches in diameter and 
twelve inches long. (A lamp chimney with straight sides will 
serve.) Fit a one-holed cork in the lower end. Cut a piece of 
rubber sheeting or oilcloth slightly larger 
than the hole in the cork. Place the rubber 
over the hole in the cork, fastening it at one 
side with a tack. This makes the lower valve 
(Valve 1, Figure 106). To make the piston 
obtain a two-holed cork slightly smaller than 
the inside of the glass tube and wrap thread 
around it until it fits snugly inside the glass 
tube. Construct a valve of rubber sheeting 
or oilcloth over one hole in the piston. Into 
the other hole force a round wooden stick 
about 16 inches long, and fasten it securely 
to the cork by means of pins, as shown in 
the figure. This forms the piston rod. Now 
fit a two-holed stopper to the upper end of 
the glass tube. The piston rod slides through 
one of the holes. Bend a glass tube six inches 
long into a right angle and insert this in the 
other hole. This makes the spout. 
(b) Push the piston down and pour a 
little water into the cylinder after loosening 
the upper cork. Place the cork in position 
again and pull the piston upward. Does the 
lower valve open or close? Does the valve 
in the piston open or close? Observe that 
the water follows the piston upward. (It may 
be necessary to move the pistof up and down 
several times.) 
(c) The space under the piston is now filled 
with water. Push the piston down. Describe

piston? 
(d) The water is now above the piston. Raise the piston and 
note which valve is open and which valve is closed. How does 
the water get out of the pump?
-P-A-G-E-158
  122 OBTAINING A GOOD WATER SUPPLY 
You can now tell how the pump works, but can you tell why 
the water rises from the well when the piston moves upwards? 
Water does not run up-hill, nor does it rise in a pipe unless it 
is forced. 
Experiment 22: What is the force which causes the water to 
rise in the pipe? 
(a) Fit a test tube with a one-holed cork. Insert a piece of 
glass tubing about two feet long in the cork so that it will extend 
down to the bottom of the test 
tube. Fill the test tube with water 
and insert cork. Apply your lips 
+o the glass tubing and try to “suck” 
the water up into the glass tube. 
Do you succeed in doing this? 
(b) Loosen the cork so that the 
air can get into the test tube above 
the water, and repeat. Does the 
water rise in the tube? sPouT

water will rise in a tube or pipe

moved, provided that the outside 
air can get to the water around the 
Fig.107. A Simple Force Pump pipe. This experiment will give 
you a start on answering the 
question, ‘“‘Why does the water come up from the well?” The 
air pressure on the outside presses on the water in the well. 
The air presses down inside of the pump also, but it presses 
against the top of the piston and not on the water below the 
piston. The piston fits air-tight in the cylinder. When it is 
raised, it tends to leave below the piston a space which contains 
no air. The air pressure on the water in the well, thus being 
greater than the air pressure on the water below the piston, 
forces the water up from the well into the cylinder of the 
pump, just as it forees mercury into a tube from which air 
has been removed. (See page 58.)
-P-A-G-E-159
HOW PUMPS WORK 123 
Exercise 4. Make three drawings showing the position of the 
valves and the movement of the water during (1) the first upstroke 
of the piston, (2) the downstroke of the piston, and (3) the second 
upstroke of the piston. Explain each drawing, giving your reason 
for the position of the valves and the movement of the water. 
The force pump pushes the water out. When it is necessary 
to supply water at a higher level than the pump, force pumps 
are used instead of lift pumps. 
The simplest type of force pump 
is shown in Figure 107. When the 
piston is pulled upward, Valve 2 
closes, and water rises in the pump, 
forcing Valve 1 open, as in the lift 
pump. On the downward stroke 
of the piston, Valve 1 is closed by 
the pressure above it and Valve 
2 opens, allowing the water to be 
forced through the spout. Since 
the water flows only on the down- 
stroke of the piston, this type of 
force pump cannot be used where 
  " ~. Fig. 108. An Air-Dome a steady stream is desired. Force Pump 
Exercise. 5. What is the difference between the construction and 
operation of the lift pump and the force pump? 
Some force pumps throw a steady stream of water. The 
air-dome force pump (Figure 108) is a pump of this type. 
It is constructed like the common force pump, but has one 
additional part, the air-dome. As the piston moves down, 
the water is forced through Valve 2 more rapidly than it can 
flow from the small spout. The excess water is forced into 
the air-dome, pushing the air into a smaller space. When 
air is pushed into a smaller space, or compressed, it exerts an 
outward pressure. On the upstroke of the piston, Valve 2 
closes and the water continues to flow. Why? Such pumps 
   
-P-A-G-E-160
  124 OBTAINING A GOOD WATER SUPPLY 
are used for small water supplies and in fire engines where it is 
necessary to force a continuous stream of water to great height. 
Exercise 6. Explain 
why the air-dome 
force pump throws a 
steady stream of 
water. 
The double-act- 
ing pump (Figure 
109) is commonly 
used in city pump- 
ing systems and on 
fire engines. There 
are two intake 
valves, Valve 3 and 
Valve 4, and two 
outlet valves, Valve 
1 and Valve 2. 
The piston moves 
back and forth 
between these two 
sets of valves, pro- 
pelled by steam, gas, 
or electric power.

Exercise 7. Summarize the action of the double-acting pump 
by answering the following questions: What is the position of 
each valve (that is, is it open or closed) when the piston moves to 
the right? What is the position of each valve when the piston 
moves to the left? Give your reasons for each answer. 
PROBLEM 3: WHY DO CITIES CONSTRUCT RESER- 
VOIRS AND STANDPIPES? 
When one is touring through the country by automobile or 
train, the first indication of a city or town is usually the sight 
of a reservoir or standpipe. Standpipes are constructed in
-P-A-G-E-161
  RESERVOIRS AND STANDPIPES 125 
various ways. Some are steel cylinders with straight sides 
(Figure 110). Others are small tanks or reservoirs held up in 
the air by a steel framework (Figure 111). These reservoirs 
are filled with water from pipes which come 
from the source of supply. The kind of 
standpipe used depends upon the size of 
the city. Why are these reservoirs and 
standpipes usually located at the highest 
place in a city or town? 
Experiment 23: How high will water rise 
in pipes connected with a reser- 
voir or standpipe? 
Connect to a large pail or jar, fitted with a 
stopper through a hole in the bottom, a long 
rubber delivery tube. Place the jar on a high

In some cities which have tall buildings the city reservoir is not

top of the building. Wateris pumped into this

water to different parts of the building are 
connected with the tank so that water may 
be supplied to the top floors. 
A standpipe or reservoir keeps an even 
pressure throughout the system. When 
pumps. are used to keep the water flowing 
through the mains, the water will rise to 
different levels at different times of the 
day, because the amount of water used at 
all hours is not the same. An abundant 
supply of water is especially needed in case 
of fire. Some cities which have pumping 
systems use also a reservoir or standpipe so 
that an abundant supply of water is always 
on hand in case of fire or a “break down” 
of pumps. Standpipes and reservoirs in 
connection with pumping systems insure a supply of water 
when it is most needed.

  CONTROL OF WATER FLOW 127 
PROBLEM 4: HOW IS THE FLOW OF WATER CON- 
TROLLED IN OUR BUILDINGS? 
Faucets control the flow of water. In order that the water 
may not be wasted, it is necessary that we have some devices 
to turn it on and off when we use it. This is commonly done 
by means of faucets and flush-tanks. . 
Figure 113 shows a section of the com- 
monest type of faucet. The handle is seen 
to be attached to a screw which fits into the 
upper part of the faucet. The lower end of 
this screw is usually faced with a flat fiber 
or leather washer. This flat washer covers 
the circular opening, or seat, at the bottom. 
If the handle is turned, the washer is raised and the water can 
flow through the opening. When the faucet is turned off, the 
screw forces the leather washer down against the opening 
and the water is shut off. The handle rod usually has some 
packing of cotton twine around it. Sometimes this packing 
gets loose and the faucet leaks. Also, after a time the fiber 
washer may get worn, and the water will trickle out. In 
crder to prevent this waste of water, all of the working parts 
of the faucet must be kept in good condition. 
In our houses we are careful to see that the faucets are not 
left open, but in hotels and in other public 
places much water is wasted if the screw 
type of faucet is used. To control this, 
self-closing faucets have been devised. 
Figure 114 shows a common type of this 
faucet. When the handle is turned, the 
screw causes the plunger to move up- 
ward, compressing the spring. The spring

  128 OBTAINING A GOOD WATER SUPPLY 
Modern houses have flush-tanks. One of the necessary sani- 
tary devices for controlling the water supply in the house is 
the flush-tank, connected with the toilet (Figure 115). The 
flush-tank is generally located on a pipe above the toilet, but 
in some cases it is built into the 
wall. If you remove the lid of 
the tank, you see a hollow cop- 
per ball about four inches in 
diameter. This ball floats on 
the water. By pulling on a 
chain, pressing a button, or turn- 
ing a lever, the outlet valve is 
opened, and the water flows 
down into the bowl. As the 
water sinks, the copper ball sinks 
with it and opens the inlet valve, 
which is attached to the other 
end of the rod connected with   
  
  Fig. 115. A Flush-Tank and 
Bowl 
There are many kinds of flush- 
tanks. The one pictured here is 
a common variety, but all kinds the ball, and the water enters 
the tank. The outlet valve 
slowly sinks back into position 
and closes the opening into the 
bowl, and the tank fills with work on the same principle. i 
water. The copper ball rises 
with the water, closing the inlet valve, and the tank is ready 
to repeat the operation. At times, on account of their worn 
condition or improper adjustment, these valves may not 
completely shut off the flow of water into the tank or into the 
bowl. The bowl is so constructed that all of the water does 
not flow out through the drainpipe. The water which remains 
in the bowl prevents the odors of sewer gas, which may be in 
the drainpipe. from entering the room. 
Exercise 11. Make a drawing of the flush-tank showing the 
position of the various parts when the float-ball is down. If you 
can remove the lid of the flush-tank in your house, do so. Operate 
the lever or chain and observe what happens inside the tank.
-P-A-G-E-165
  CONTROL OF WATER FLOW 129 
Every building should have a drainage system. Another 
problem in the control of water in the house is the removal 
of the waste water. This is a matter which is of importance, 
not only from the standpoint of convenience, but also from 
that of health. Every house which is supplied with city 
water must also have a drain- 
age system. Figure 116 shows 
the plumbing in a modern resi- 
dence. You will notice that, be- 
low each bath tub or sink there 
is a curve in the pipe. This 
curve, or trap, is always full of 
water and prevents sewer gas, 
which is both unpleasant and 
dangerous, from entering the 
house. The soil pipe, which ex- 
tends above the house, prevents 
these gases from accumulating 
in the drainage system. Ex- 
amine Figure 116 and locate the 
traps and soil pipe. Sometimes 
the traps get filled with grease A 
or other materials and the water Fig. 116. Plumbing in a Modern

drain, this grease will not ac- 
cumulate, and the water will not be blocked. In case solids 
get lodged in this trap, another remedy is used. Such a con- 
dition may be remedied by unscrewing a small plug which is 
usually placed in the lower bend of the trap, taking out the 
materials, and replacing the plug.

Exercise 13. From the results obtained in Experiment 24 explain 
how the water is heated in the tank shown in Figure 117. When a 
hot-water faucet is opened, what happens in the tank? 
In many buildings heating coils are placed in the fire-boxes 
of furnaces to furnish hot water. These coils may or may 
not be connected with a 
storage tank. If they are 
not connected with a tank, 
the hot water is soon ex-

The heater usually consists 
of a coil of copper water-pipes 
surrounded by an iron jacket, 
and connected with a hot-water tank (Figure 119). The heat 
from the flame passes upward and circulates around the water- 
pipes, which offer a large amount of surface to the flame, thus 
heating the water very quickly. The gas is burned inside of 
the jacket at the base of the heating coils, and the size of the 
flame is controlled automatically. At the bottom of the 
storage tank is a copper tube, which expands when heated 
and contracts when cooled. This copper tube is connected 
with the gas supply. When the water is cold, the tube contracts

supply this should be the “Golden Rule,” for our water supply 
is easily contaminated with disease germs unless the proper 
precautions are taken. There 
are three main sources of pol- 
lution: (1) wastes from human 
beings and animals, (2) decay- 
ing plant and animal life, and 
(3) garbage. Of the three, 
wastes from human beings 
and animals are the most 
dangerous because they may 
contain germs of at least five diseases: typhoid fever, cholera, 
diarrhea, enteritis, and dysentery.    Fig. 122. (See Exercise 16.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
         KEEPING THE WATER SUPPLY PURE 133 
Shallow wells which are improperly constructed or located 
are common sources of danger. 
Exercise 16. Figures 120, 121, and 122 show three possible loca- 
tions of a well in regard to the surface drainage and the under- 
ground drainage. Which of the three locations of the well is the 
most desirable? Why? 
In houses where the well is used as a source of water and 
there is no sewage system, it is necessary to construct a cess- 
pool or septic tank to dispose 
of the sewage. The cesspool 
is merely a hole in the 
ground, ten or twelve feet 
deep and four or five feet in 
diameter. This is usually 
lined with stones. It is in- 
tended that the solid ma- 
terials will be broken up by 
the bacteria and form liquids 
which together with the liq- 
uid parts of the sewage will 
soak into the ground. At the 
best this is a very insanitary method of sewage disposal, and if it 
is used, the cesspool should be at least fifty feet from the well, 
and its drainage should be away from the water supply. The 
septic tank is made of concrete (Figure 123). In this device 
the solid materials are completely changed to liquid, which

decomposition by the bacteria before it drains into the soil. PIPE LINE TO TOILET IN HOUSE

The septic tank is located some dis- 
tance away from the house. 
Exercise 17. Why is the septic tank more sanitary than the 
cesspool for sewage disposal? 
It is a very difficult problem to safeguard the water supply 
of a city, because in most instances the source of supply is 
surface water. Cities which obtain their water from rivers 
and lakes must prevent, if possible, the discharge of sewage 
and wastes into the water within certain distances from the

city. Most cities obtain the water upstream from where they 
empty their sewage, but they do not always consider the 
danger to other communities located downstream. 
The purity of 
the water supply 
depends largely 
on the proper 
disposal of the 
sewage. A mod- 
ern and_ scien- 
tific method of 
disposal is to 
collect the sew- 
age into very 
large basins or 
septic tanks, 
where the sew-

hypochlorite of 
lime, and then drained into the soil or into a stream. Another 
method is shown in Figure 124. 
As a measure of precaution the water supply should be 
regularly tested. Most cities make daily or weekly tests 
of their water supply, and in case exceptionally large numbers 
of disease-producing bacteria are present, the water is treated 
chemically, and people are warned to boil the water before 
drinking it. The State Board of Health also maintains a labora- 
tory, and an analysis of water is made free or at a small cost.

much more complicated than in a rural home?

Fig. 125. A Sand Water-Filter for a Large City 
The layers of sand and gravel are made very thick so that the water 
trickles through very slowly.     
the river can be made fit for drinking. The water in the river 
may contain all sorts of impurities, such as decayed animal and 
vegetable matter, sewage from towns along = 
the banks, and disease-producing germs. 
Yet this water may be made fairly safe. 
Perhaps the commonest method of re- 
moving impurities from water is filtration. 
Experiment 25: How is water made pure . 
by filtration? 
Tie a cloth over the bottom of a lamp chim- 
ney and support it on a tumbler (Figure 126). 
Pour in some coarse sand to make a layer 
about two inches thick. Now pour in fine sand 5 
within an inch of the top. Make a mixture of Fig. 126 
muddy water and pour it in at the top of the PaeHD nee Paeratne

Figure 125 shows a type of sand filter commonly used by 
many cities.

The larger of the 
two tanks is a cooler 
and storage tank. 
Figure 128 shows a 
sectional view of 
the smaller tank, 
which contains the 
filter proper.      Standard Filter Co. Analysis of the water shows that soil particles 
and practically all disease-producing germs 
are removed by this process. Figures 127 
and 128 show a filter which may be used in 
the home. In this filter the water is forced 
by the pressure in the water system through 
a porous porcelain tube which removes all 
impurities. 
Another practi- 
cal method of 
purifying water is 
storing it in a res- 
ervoir for several 
weeks. Suspended 
impurities, suchas 
soil particles,slow- 
ly settle to the 
bottom and the 
water becomes 
clear (Figure 129). 
This does not 
mean that the 
water is yet pure, 
for the clearest 
water may contain millions of dis- 
ease germs. But because the reser- 
voir is uncovered, the germs are de- 
stroyed by the sunlight and by the 
oxygen dissolved in the water 
(Figure 130). Certain bacteria in 
the water also help to decompose 
some of the decaying material and 
to destroy some of the disease pro- 
ducing germs.

more oxygen.

Experiment 26: How can muddy water be cleared? 
Fill two small bottles with muddy water. Put a small quantity 
of alum solution in one bottle. Allow the two bottles to stand, ob- 
serving the changes in appearance of the water in each bottle. After 
twenty-four hours have passed, note which bottle contains the 
clearer water. 
The alum causes the minute particles of soil to come together 
and form larger particles. These larger particles sink to the 
bottom of the container. As they sink, they carry with them 
many of the bacteria present. In large 
cities the water is treated with alum and 
later filtered or treated with chemicals. 
In cases where the water supply is badly 
contaminated, some other method of killing 
the disease-producing germs must be prac- 
ticed. In some cities this is done by putting 
a small amount of chlorine gas, or bleach- 
ing powder, into the water. The chlorine 
gas or bleaching powder kills the germs. 
These materials are objectionable in that 
Fig. Rake nt they give the water a peculiar taste if they 
are used in large quantity. Another way of 
making sure that the water is free from disease-producing 
germs is to boil it for half an hour. 
In order completely to remove the germs as well as all other 
impurities water is distilled. 
  Experiment 27: How does distillation remove impurities 
from water? 
Construct an apparatus as shown in Figure 131. Fill the flask 
one-fourth full of muddy water containing two or three teaspoon- 
fuls of salt or sugar, and some ink. Heat the flask. When the 
water commences to boil, reduce the size of the flame so that it 
will boil slowly. Note the drops of water which collect in the 
delivery tube and in the test tube. Examine the water in the 
test tube. Taste it. Is it pure?

  UNIT V 
KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 
PRELIMINARY EXERCISE 
Write a composition entitled “Keeping Physically Fit.” Tell all 
you know about your own body and how you should take care of it. 
THE STORY OF UNIT V 
In whatever climate and under whatever weather condi- 
tions we live, our first problem is that of keeping well, for both 
our efficiency and comfort depend upon our health. It is said 
that a Chinaman pays his doctor to keep him well, and that 
the doctor’s pay stops when he gets sick. Whether or not 
this is true, it is not a bad idea, for an ounce of prevention in 
matters of health is worth a pound of cure. 
Our present indoor life makes the problem of keeping well 
more complicated than it was in the days when man spent 
most of his time outdoors. Buildings and houses must be 
properly heated and ventilated in order to assist in keeping 
the human machine in its best condition. A large proportion 
of our population do no hard physical work. This makes it 
necessary for them to obtain their exercise after work hours. 
Competition in the business world has so increased that man 
must keep incessantly “on the job” in order to succeed. This 
speeding up of life in the modern world has resulted in a greater 
strain on the human body and has required us to pay careful 
attention to our bodily needs. 
The human body consists of many systems which work 
together harmoniously (Figures 74, 132, and 136). Each has 
a special work to do. For example, the body is supported by a 
framework of bones, known as the bony system. Attached 
to the bones, which make up the skeleton, are muscles, com- 
140
-P-A-G-E-177

-P-A-G-E-178
  142 KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 
posing the muscular system, which enables us to move our 
arms, legs, fingers, head, and ribs. In addition to these parts 
of the body whose movements we can see, there are other 
internal parts such as the stomach, intestines, and heart, 
which also are moved by the action of muscles. The duty of 
the digestive system, which consists of the teeth, stomach, and 
intestines, is to prepare the food so it may be used by the body. 
A special system is required, however, to carry the food to 
the different parts of the body. This is the duty of the cir- 
culatory system, which consists of the heart, blood vessels, and 
blood. Oxygen is necessary to obtain energy from the food. 
The respiratory system, which consists of the lungs and air 
passages, secures this oxygen from the air and also throws off 
certain wastes which are formed when the foods combine 
with oxygen. Here again the circulatory system must carry 
the oxygen to the cells and the wastes away from them. 
Other wastes from the foods and broken-down cells are 
eliminated by the excretory system, which includes the intestines, 
kidneys, liver, and skin. You can see that every system of 
the body must be in good working order, because every part 
of the body is dependent upon every other part. Of course, 
in a complex machine of this kind there must be some con- 
trolling force which will direct the activities of the different 
parts. This is the work of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, 
which make up the nervous system. 
In the different systems mentioned above are many organs, 
each of which has some special part to play in the body. For 
example, the stomach and intestines are organs, each of which 
has a particular use in the digestive process. The organs 
themselves are also made of different kinds of material called 
tissues. Muscles, bones, glands, nerves, and tendons are all 
tissues, and each has a definite work, or function, to perform. 
If the tissues are examined under a high-power microscope, 
it is found that they are composed of very small parts called 
cells (Figure 133). The cell is the smallest unit into which’ 
living material can be divided, and for this reason it is 
   
-P-A-G-E-179
THE STORY OF UNIT V 143 
called the structural unit of living matter. The cells might 
be compared to the grains of sugar which make up a cake of 
loaf sugar. They differ, however, from the grains of sugar

tongue; (d) Cartilage cell; (e) Goblet cell from intestines; (f) Ciliated 
cells from bronchial tube. 
in that there are many different kinds of cells in the body, 
each of which has a special work to do. 
To keep the cells, tissues, organs, and systems in good 
condition so that there will be good teamwork is the problem 
of keeping well. Three kinds of material, each in the proper 
amount, are essential to one’s physical well-being—pure food, 
pure water, and pure air. To understand how these materials 
are used by the body and how to take care of the various parts 
of the body which prepare these materials for use, makes for 
proper living.
-P-A-G-E-180
    144 KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 
Two other necessities which are intimately connected with 
healthy living are proper exercise and rest. Exercise helps 
get rid of undesirable wastes in the body and also assists the 
various organs of the body in their work. Rest and sleep 
give the body time to rebuild and repair the cells which are 
broken down. 
Keeping physically fit is thus a matter which is largely 
within the control of every individual. It consists in practicing 
healthful habits of living. To know what these habits are and 
the reasons for them, and then to practice them day by day 
until they become a part of us will enable us to live longer and 
more comfortably. 
PROBLEM 1: WHAT BECOMES OF THE FOOD YOU EAT? 
Digestion changes food to a liquid form. You already know 
that the food you eat is changed into body material or is used 
for supplying energy. Since the food must be transported to 
all parts of the body by the blood, it must pass through the 
walls of the digestive organs to the blood. This can take 
place only if the foods are in the form of a liquid. Since 
most of the food we eat is solid, it is necessary to change it to 
the liquid state. Digestion has for its purpose the changing 
of foods from a solid to a liquid state so that they may pass 
through the walls of the digestive organs and be carried to the 
different parts of the body. 
Experiment 28: How can solids be changed to liquids? 
(a) Add a pinch of salt or sugar to a test tube half full of water, 
and shake. Hold the test tube up to the light. What has become 
of the solid? When a solid mixes with a liquid so that the particles 
are no longer visible, the solid is said to be in solution; that is, 
the solid has dissolved. 
(b) Drop a small piece of limestone or marble about the size of 
a pea into a little water and shake it. Does it dissolve? Add 5 
ce. c. of hydrochloric acid to the water. Notice the small bubbles 
of carbon-dioxide gas which are formed. Allow it to stand until the 
next day. What finally becomes of the limestone? 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  WHAT BECOMES OF FOOD YOU EAT? 145 
From the first part of the experiment you see that sugar or 
salt will dissolve if it is placed in water. There are many ma- 
terials which dissolve in this manner. Not all materials, how- 
ever, will dissolve in water. Limestone, for example, is not 
soluble in water. One might think that the limestone dis- 
solved in the acid, but this is not the case. The acid acted 
upon the limestone and produced a chemical change in it. 
When a material is changed chemi- 
cally, it becomes a new material. The 
hydrochloric acid combined with the 
limestone and produced carbon- 
dioxide gas, which passed off into the 
air and left a new substance called 
calcium chloride. The calcium chlo- 
ride is soluble in water; so it dissolv- 
ed and disappeared. Digestion is 
accomplished in our body in a 
similar way. Various digestive fluids 
are found in the digestive organs. 
These fluids dissolve our foods or 
change them into new materials which 
will dissolve. 
The digestive process begins in the 
mouth. The teeth perform the first 
act in the process of digestion. They j are 
are so constructed that they can tear, Peele a ee el 
grind, and cut the food. When the 
foods are ground up, they may be easily penetrated by the 
digestive fluids of the mouth, stomach, and intestines. In 
order that the food be thoroughly masticated, one must eat 
slowly. This has two values: it reduces the food to small 
bits, and it also stimulates the flow of the ‘digestive fluids. 
Both of these actions result in more thorough digestion. 
Figure 134 shows a longitudinal, or lengthwise, section of a 
tooth with its parts labeled. When the outside enamel, which 
‘is very hard, is worn off, the softer parts on the inside soon 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 146 
decay. This decay is caused by the action of certain bacteria 
which form an acid from the bits of food left between the teeth. 
To prevent this, it is necessary to clean the teeth thoroughly 
after each meal. It is well worth while to have a dentist 
examine the teeth once or twice a year to detect spots which 
are decaying and which may be filled before they are large 
enough to cause pain or loss 
of the tooth. The teeth are 
necessary for proper mastica- 
tion of food, and as such they 
should be carefully guarded 
against decay. 
Exercise 1. Enumerate several 
foolish practices which people 
do to or with their teeth, such 
as picking them with a pin, etc. 
After each tell why it is a foolish 
practice. 
       Blood Vessels During mastication the food 
is mixed with a fluid called 
saliva. This is manufactured 
in the salivary glands (Figure Submaxillary Sublingual Gland Gland 
Fig. 135. The Salivary Glands 
There are three pairs of salivary 
glands: the parotid glands lie under 
each ear, the submaxillary glands 
lie below the two halves of the 
lower jaw, and the sublingual glands 
lie under the tongue. 185) and is forced into the 
mouth through ducts. It has 
two uses: first, it moistens 
dry foods, like crackers, so that 
they may be easily swallowed; 
second, it digests the starch. 
You remember that foods like potatoes contain large quan- 
tities of starch. This starch must be digested before it can 
pass through the walls of the intestines. This digestion is 
partially accomplished by the saliva. 
Experiment 29: What effect does saliva have upon starch? 
(a) Drop a small piece of starch about half the size of a pea in. 
a test tube half full of water. Shake the tube vigorously. Does

starch? 
Proteins are di- 
gested in the stom- 
ach. After the 
food is thoroughly 
masticated and 
moistened with 
saliva, it passes 
back through the 
mouth into the 
esophagus, which 
opens into the 
stomach (Figure 
136). The stomach 
(Figure 137) is a 
pear-shaped mus- 
cular organ with a 
capacity of from 
three to five pints.

Experiment 30: What effect does gastric juice have upon proteins? 
(a) Artificial gastric juice can bé prepared by mixing one-half 
gram of pepsin (which can be obtained at any drug store) with 
2 c.c. of hydrochloric acid and 50 ¢.c. of water. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  148 KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 
(6) Boil an egg in some water. Cut the white of the egg into 
small bits, or press it through a wire gauze. Add a small portion 
of this to the artificial gastric juice, and keep the temperature at 
about 100°F. for two or three hours. What effect does the gastric 
juice have upon the egg? 
(c) Repeat (6), using the same amount of egg and artificial 
gastric juice, and shake the test tube often. Compare the results 
obtained with those obtained in part (b). What effect does 
shaking have upon the rate of digestion? 
The action of the gastric juice on the foods is assisted by the 
muscles of the stomach. 
Whenthesemuscles contract, 
they become shorter and 
thicker; when they relax, 
they become. longer and 
narrower. By alternately 
contracting and _ relaxing 
they keep the contents of 
the stomach in motion and 
thus mix the foods with 
the gastric juice. 
Digestion is completed 
in the intestines. The Observe the folds of muscles on the 
inside walls. Turn to Figure 136 to Contents of the stomach are see where this organ is located. emptied into the small in- 
testine, which is a coiled 
tube about twenty-two feet long. Here the food is further 
mixed with intestinal juice, with bile which comes from the liver, 
and with pancreatic juice, which is manufactured by the pancreas 
(Figure 136). These juices complete the action of dissolving 
digestible parts of the food. Most of the food is absorbed 
through the walls of the small intestine by the blood (Figure 138). 
Some of the food, both digested and undigested, together 
with the digestive juices, passes into the large intestine (Fig- 
ure 136). Dissolved foods are absorbed here, while the undi- 
gested food is gathered and passed out of the body, or excreted. 
  Fig. 137. The Stomach

  WHAT BECOMES OF AIR YOU BREATHE? 149 
The bowels must move regularly. It is most important 
to our health that undigested food be excreted. (See page 
91.) The lower part of the intestines contains many bac- 
teria, which change 
some of these waste 
materials into poi- 
sons. These poi- 
sons are taken up 
by the blood and 
produce a bad ef- 
fect on the whole 
body. They fre- 
quently cause dull, 
sick headaches. In 
order to prevent 
this, the intestines 
should be evacua- 
ted at least once 
aday. Incase this Fig. 138. A Cross-Section of the Small Intestine

Exercise 2. Write a story telling the experiences of a piece of 
bread from the time you eat it until it is changed into part of

PROBLEM 2: WHAT BECOMES OF THE AIR YOU BREATHE? 
The air is a mixture of colorless gases. It is hard to realize 
that material may be invisible. Yet you live in an ocean of 
air composed of colorless gases. Chemists have very accurately 
determined what these gases are and the quantity of each, 
as shown by the table on the next page.

Unfortunately the air you breathe is not always pure. It 
may contain smoke, dust particles, or disease germs. These 
dust particles may be seen by means of a simple experiment. 
Experiment 31: How can the dust particles in the air be made visible? 
Select a room which has windows on the south. Choose a day 
when the sun is very bright and pull down the shades so that the 
room will be quite dark. Now pull 
one of the shades aside so that a 
thin streak of sunlight can enter 
the room. Observe the path of the 
sunlight through the darkened room. 
What do you see? 
If these dust particles enter the 
lungs, they may lodge in the lung 
tissues and cause serious trouble. 
Of course, one cannot always 
choose the kind of air he breathes, 
but he can, to some extent, prevent 
the entrance of these particles into

through the nose. Inside the nose are many fine hairs which act 
as a sieve in sifting out some of the larger dust particles. The 
actual surface of the inner nose is very great because of the pro- 
jection of the turbinate bones (Figure 139) which extend into the 
passage. These bones are covered with a thin, moist mucous 
membrane. As the air passes over this membrane, dust particles 
and germs are caught by the sticky surface. This membrane

apparent. Mouth breathing not only looks bad, but it per- 
mits the impurities in the air to enter the lungs, thus increas- 
ing the likelihood of disease. 
The oxygen enters the blood in the 
lungs. From the nose, the air passes 
into the pharynx (Figure 74, page 85), 
then down into the windpipe, or trachea 
(Figure 140). The trachea divides into

are lined with mucous membrane containing thousands of tiny 
blood vessels. Some of the oxygen in the air passes through 
the membrane into the blood vessels, and combines with the 
red corpuscles (Figure 142). These corpuscles carry the oxygen 
to all parts of the body, where it is gradually given up to the 
cells (Figure 141). In exchange for the oxygen, the cells give

up carbon dioxide, which is a waste material formed when the 
food combines with oxygen. 
If you examine the blood vessels in your arm, you notice 
that the blood appears blue. If, however, one of these blood 
vessels is cut, the blood which you see is red. Why is this 
true? To understand this you must know more about the 
circulation of the blood. While the blood is in the lungs, some 
of the material in the red corpuscles combines with the oxygen 
and produces a red substance which gives the blood its color. 
The blood then flows back to the heart, where it is pumped 
all over the body. As the corpuscles give up their oxygen, 
the color of the blood changes to blue. The blood vessels 
which you see through the skin contain blood which has given 
up its oxygen. This blood goes back to the lungs, where it 
gives up its carbon dioxide, obtains a fresh supply of oxygen, 
and is again pumped over the body. 
Exercise 3. Why is “blue” blood never seen outside the body? 
That carbon dioxide is given back to the air in the lungs, you 
can see by the following experiment.

air with the time it burns in ordinary air. (Remember that burn- 
ing is caused by oxygen.) How do you account for the results? 
(d) Heat a small piece of charcoal in a flame until it glows red. 
Then quickly drop it into a dry bottle and cover it with a glass 
plate. Wait until the charcoal “goes 
out,” and then pour a little limewater 
into the bottle and re-cover with the 
glass plate. Shake the bottle vigor- 
ously for a minute or two and note 
that the limewaterturns milky. This 
is the chemist’s test for carbon diox- 
ide. Pour a little limewater into a 
bottle of ordinary air and shake it. 
Does it turn milky? What does this pees Appar so 
show? Now insert a glass tube into the rpenmen 
limewater and blow through it for several minutes. How do you ac- 
count for the change in the limewater?   
  Your experiment shows you that expired air is different 
from ordinary air in four respects: (1) its temperature is 
higher; (2) it contains more water vapor; (3) it contains less 
oxygen; and (4) it contains more carbon dioxide. Breathing, 
therefore, is of value not only in furnishing the cells with 
oxygen but also in reducing the body temperature and in 
getting rid of wastes. 
Deep breathing is necessary. Since breathing is such an 
important process, it is necessary that all parts of the breath- 
ing mechanism be kept in good order. Probably one of the 
most important health habits which one can acquire is the habit 
of deep breathing through the nose. If deep breathing is not 
practiced, part of the lung surface is not used. As a conse- 
quence the unused parts are readily attacked by disease germs. 
To prevent shallow breathing one must stand and sit erect. 
The clothing around the chest and waist should be loose 
enough so that it will not interfere with the elevation of the 
ribs, which takes place when air enters the body. Plenty of 
exercise, which results in deep breathing, insures that all parts 
of the lung surface are in use. 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  154 KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 
Proper ventilation secures fresh air. Another important 
condition in keeping the breathing mechanism in good order is 
proper ventilation of our buildings. Ventilation accomplishes 
two results: it brings in fresh air, and gets rid of the air which 
has been changed by breathing. When possible, the air should 
come into the room through several small openings rather 
than one large opening. That is, in a room having several 
windows, some should be raised slightly at the bottom and 
others lowered slightly from the top. This will prevent strong 
drafts. Especial attention should be given to sleeping-rooms. 
Experiment 33: How may you use the windows in a room to 
secure the best ventilation? 
(a) Obtain a wooden box about 1 foot by 6 inches by 6 inches. 
Remove one side of the box. Bore two small holes about one- 
half inch in diameter in each end of the box. 
One hole should be at the bottom and one 
at the top, as shown in Figure 145. Each 
hole should then be stoppered with a cork. 
(b) Remove the cork from one of the 
holes near the bottom of the box. Light

You can determine this by noting the length of time the candle

  VALUE OF REST AND EXERCISE 155 
Exercise 5. Complete the following statement, using the best answer: 
Deep breathing is necessary because: 
1. It enables us to exercise more vigorously. 2. It makes us breathe 
faster. 3. It develops our lungs. 4. It prevents disease. 
Exercise 6. At least 30 cubic feet of air per person should be 
furnished in a room every minute. How many cubic feet of 
air are necessary in your school room every hour? How many 
times an hour should the air in the room be changed completely? 
PROBLEM 3: WHY IS PLENTY OF EXERCISE AND 
REST NECESSARY? 
Exercise of the proper kind has a beneficial effect upon every 
process in the human body. For this reason everyone should 
take some exercise every day of his life. It is better to exer- 
cise out-of-doors, because there is a more plentiful supply of 
fresh air, and because of the beneficial effect of sunshine. 
Hard mental work should be followed by light exercise. 
Exercise is particularly necessary for the brain-worker. When 
one studies hard, an increased supply of blood is sent to the 
brain, which diminishes the quantity in the stomach, muscles, 
and other parts of the body. Exercise sends the blood to 
these parts of the body and thus restores the circulation of 
the body to normal. It is therefore desirable to follow hard 
study with some light exercise. 
Experiment 34: What effect does exercise have upon the rate at 
which the heart beats? 
(a) When your heart pumps blood into the arteries, a wave of 
blood is sent through them. In order to count the number of 
heartbeats per minute it is only necessary to find a place where 
there is an artery close to the surface of the body. This can be 
found in the wrist or behind the ear. After you have been sitting 
still for some time, find out how many times your heart beats 
per minute by taking your pulse. 
(b) Take some light exercise and again count your pulse. 
How do the results obtained while you are quiet differ from those 
taken immediately after exercise? 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  156 KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 
When one exercises, the heart beats faster and the blood 
circulates more rapidly. More oxygen and food are thus 
carried to the cells, and the wastes of the cells are removed 
more rapidly. These changes which take place as the result 
of exercise keep the whole circulatory system in good working 
order. 
Exercise helps us get rid of waste materials. Everyone 
marvels at the endurance of runners in long-distance or mara- 
thon races. This endurance is, of course, the result of long 
continued training. With exercise, the rate of breathing 
increases, and by breathing correctly, we can use our lungs 
to their fullest capacity. This enables us to obtain a sufficient 
supply of oxygen to meet the increased rate of blood flow and 
also to get rid of the wastes formed as a result of the rapid 
burning of food and the destruction of body cells. 
Another very important result of exercise is the increase 
in the amount of perspiration poured on the skin. Perspira- 
tion contains some of the body wastes, and thus the skin is 
one of the important organs of excretion. The kidneys and 
liver are also organs of excretion, and they are frequently over- 
worked, especially if we eat large quantities of protein food. 
(See page 91.) Exercise, by increasing the amount of per- 
spiration poured on the skin, thus helps the kidneys and liver 
in removing body wastes. 
Rest and sleep are also necessary to keep the organs of the 
body in good condition. Long-continued brain or muscular 
work makes us feel tired. During work of this kind the cells 
are broken down and need rest or sleep, which will give them 
time to repair themselves. It is frequently restful to change 
the kind of work being done, as this calls into play the action 
of different muscle and nerve cells, thus permitting the blood 
to carry away the waste materials which have accumulated 
and allowing the overworked cells to rest. There is, however, 
-no substitute for rest and sleep. 
Exercise 7. Write a paragraph comparing the effect of exercise 
and sleep upon different parts of the body.
-P-A-G-E-193
WHY SHOULD WE BATHE? 157 
PROBLEM 4: WHY SHOULD WE BATHE? 
Bathing removes wastes from the skin. You are aware 
that when you exercise vigorously, perspiration from the 
sweat glands (Figure 146) is poured on the skin. This process, 
however, is going on continuously, even when you sleep. 
The sweat glands take waste 
materials from the blood and 
pour them out on the skin. 
Some of these waste materials 
are solid and some are liquid. 
In order to prevent the pores 
from clogging up with the ae- 
cumulation of solid materials 
from the perspiration and dirt 
from the outside, it is neces- 
sary that you bathe frequent- 
ly. Hot water and soap are 
required to cleanse the body 
thoroughly. 
Bathing affects the circula- 
tory system. In taking baths 
you must consider the effects 
of different kinds of baths 
upon the body. Hot baths 
    open up the pores and in- 
crease the perspiration. They 
also cause the blood vessels 
near the skin to expand so Fig. 146. Sweat Glands in the Skin 
The skin is divided into two 
layers, the epidermis and the der- 
mis. The sweat glands and blood 
vessels are in the dermis. 
that the body loses heat faster. 
When the skin is in this condition, one is very liable to “take 
cold.” For this reason a hot bath should be followed by a 
very short cold bath. This will close the pores and drive 
the blood to the inner parts of the body. The cold bath 
should be followed immediately by a brisk rub with a coarse 
towel. This causes a second reaction of the blood vessels, 
and the skin again becomes pink, or “glows.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  158 KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 
Bathing of the sort just described is very valuable, not only 
from the standpoint of cleanliness, but also from its effect 
upon the blood vessels. The blood. vessels have circular 
muscles which regulate the flow of the blood (Figure 147). 
When the muscles of the blood vessels in the skin contract, 
the blood is sent to the inner parts of the body. When these 
muscles relax, the blood vessels become larger and more 
blood passes through the skin. In this way the body heat is 
automatically controlled, since, 
when a large quantity of blood 
flows through the skin, heat 
is lost, and when the blood 
is sent to the inner parts of 
the body, heat is saved. In 
order to keep the body tem- 
perature constant it is neces- 
sary that these changes in the 
size of the blood vessels take 
place very rapidly in response 
to a given change of outside 
temperature. Hot and cold 
baths give these muscles con- 
stant exercise and thus keep them in good condition. 
Baths should be taken at the proper time. The time for 
taking baths is also worthy of consideration. Baths should 
never be taken immediately after meals since they draw the 
blood away from the digestive organs and thus interfere with 
digestion. A hot shower bath followed by a shorter cold 
shower is an excellent way to start the day because of the 
good effects upon the circulatory and the nervous systems. 
During the hot summer months sponging off the body with 
cold or tepid water is a good way to secure sound sleep.

Observe the thick muscular walls. 
Exercise 8. Why should one always bathe after hard exercise? 
Exercise 9. Explain how a hot bath immediately followed by 
a cold bath has nearly the same effect upon the body as hard 
exercise.

  EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO 159 
PROBLEM 5: WHY SHOULD WE NOT USE ALCOHOL 
AND TOBACCO? 
Alcohol lowers the resistance of the body. Keeping in 
good physical condition results in making the body cells strong 
enough to resist the action of disease germs. It also keeps the 
different organs in the body in good working order. Perhaps 
the most serious effect of alcohol upon the body is the lowering 
of its resistance. This makes it easier for the germs to attack 
the body and cause serious or fatal illness. Mortality records, 
or death records, of life-insurance companies furnish informa- 
tion for determining the effect of alcohol upon the resistance 
of the body. Many studies of this kind have been made. 
One company reports that 40 per cent of the policy applicants 
are rejected for causes connected with the use of alcohol. 
Another company, which divides its policy-holders into 
“drinkers” and “‘non-drinkers,”’ shows the following mortality 
in the two groups: Out of the number of deaths expected 
among the non-drinkers during a period of 40 years, 71.54 
per cent died. Of those who drank, 94 per cent died. This 
gives clear evidence that the use of alcohol shortens one’s span 
of life. 
How does alcohol lower the resistance of the body? To 
answer this question we must examine its effect, upon different 
parts of the body. Probably the most noticeable effect of 
alcohol is its action upon the blood vessels in the skin. A 
small amount of alcohol causes these blood vessels to enlarge, 
and hence the body loses heat rapidly. This loss of heat 
requires the body to oxidize more food to make good the loss. 
Thus the body is overworked. A second effect is this: Small 
quantities of alcohol have been found to increase the flow 
of the gastric juice, but this increase is always followed by a 
decrease in the flow after the stimulation has worn off; in time 
the gastric glands cease to work without the presence of alcohol 
or some other stimulant. A third effect of alcohol is its action 
upon the muscle cells of the heart. These cells may be changed 
to fat, and thus the heart, which is really a pump, cannot force 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  160 KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 
the blood through the body at the proper rate. This destruc- 
tion of the vital cells and their replacement by fat take place 
in many parts of the body. It is, therefore, easy to understand 
how alcohol lowers the resistance of the human body. 
Alcohol affects our daily work. Employers have recognized 
for years that men who are habitual users of alcohol are not 
so efficient in their work as men who do not use alcohol. Rec- 
ognition of this fact has led many employers to draw up rules 
prohibiting the use of alcohol during work hours. Others 
have gone still further in refusing to employ men who use 
alcohol at any time or in any amount. This is particularly 
true of railroads, where the lives of thousands of people de- 
pend upon the clear-headedness of their employees. 
Many experiments have been carried on to determine the 
effect. of alcohol upon one’s ability to work. One such ex- 
periment was carried on with a group of typesetters. The 
results showed that even one ounce of alcohol per day was 
sufficient to reduce by 10 per cent the amount of work done. 
Another experiment determined the effect of alcohol upon 
one’s speed in responding to certain stimulations. The person 
sits at a table with his finger on a telegraph key. A light 
is flashed and he releases the key. The time between the sig- 
nal and the release of the key is measured. This is called the 
reaction time. The experiment showed that the reaction 
time was decreased if the test was made immediately after 
the alcohol was taken, but if made some time afterwards, the 
reaction time rose much above normal. Reaction time is 
very important when a quick decision is needed, as, for example, 
in avoiding a collision with an automobile or in running ma- 
chinery of any kind. Since alcohol finally results in increasing 
the reaction time, it is easily seen that it slows up one’s rate 
of work. 
Accuracy is very important in many lines of work. An 
experiment somewhat like the one previously reported indi- 
cates the effect of alcohol upon accuracy. The person is 
seated at a table with each hand placed on a telegraph key.
-P-A-G-E-197
  EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO 161 
If a white light appears, he is to press one key, and if a red 
light appears, he is to press the other key. Tests have shown 
that a small amount of alcohol caused the keys to be released 
more rapidly than before alcohol was taken, but the person 
tested released the wrong key much more frequently than 
before. This effect of alcohol in making the individual more 
liable to quick and unconsidered judgments is one of the chief 
causes of the decrease in efficiency. 
Alcohol lowers moral standards. Human society through 
countless generations has built up standards of conduct and 
ideals of right and wrong. The individual has also developed 
will power and the ability of self-restraint. This ability is under 
the control of the highest center of the nervous system, the 
brain. One of the first effects of alcohol is to dull or paralyze 
this nerve-center, and the individual loses the qualities which 
distinguish him from the savage. A person under the influ- 
ence of alcohol will do and say things which he will not do or 
say when he is in full possession of his senses. In the occa- 
sional drinker, this dulling of the sense of right and wrong is 
only temporary, but there is always the grave danger that its 
use will become habitual. The result of such long-continued 
habit is a complete breaking down of the refinements which 
modern civilization has made, and moral degeneracy results. 
Tobacco is especially harmful to growing boys and girls. 
The effect of tobacco upon the human system has also been 
a subject of investigation by scientists. Their findings have 
shown that it is especially harmful to young people. Most of 
the states have recognized this by passing laws which prohibit 
the sale of tobacco to minors. Not only is the use of tobacco 
an offensive habit, but experiments have demonstrated that 
the average scholarship of tobacco-users in schools and colleges 
is lower than that of students who do not use tobacco. 
Colleges and high schools which are leaders in athletics have 
also found that the use of tobacco interferes with the efficiency 
of their athletes, and have prohibited the use of tobacco by 
the members of their athletic teams. In general, experiments 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  162 KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 
have shown that tobacco has at least three bad effects on the 
human body: (1) it interferes with the growth of the heart 
and produces a weakened condition known as “tobacco heart”’; 
(2) it interferes with the respiratory system by irritating the 
delicate membranes of the throat and lungs; and (8) it inter- 
feres with the action of the digestive juices. These findings 
indicate that the tobacco habit is decidedly injurious. 
PROBLEM 6: HOW CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR EYES? 
Our eyes contribute more to our happiness and our success 
in life than any of the other sense organs. If they are not 
properly cared for, such 
eaueous human | MEE : .| neglect may not only 
result in defective sight 
but may also affect the 
nervous system, causing 
headaches and a general 
decline in health. A 
knowledge of how to 
take care of the eyes is 
dependent upon an un- 
- : derstanding of how they

if cut in halves from front to back. A eae      
  structed. If you could 
see a section of your eye, it would appear as shown in Figure 
148. This “ball of your eye” is really ball-shaped. It is set 
in a bony socket and further protected by the eyelids and 
eye-lashes. Muscles are attached to the eyeball so that it 
can be turned easily and quickly in different directions. 
A study of the structure of the eye will help you to under- 
stand how it works. Starting on the outside you find a tough 
outside coat around the entire eyeball, except where the 
optic nerve leaves at the back. This coat, called the sclerotic 
coat, is white in color, except in the central part of the front 
of the eye, where it is transparent. This transparent part is
-P-A-G-E-199
  CARING FOR YOUR EYES 163 
called the cornea. It is the window through which light can 
enter the eye. The white part around the cornea is often 
called the ‘‘white of the eye.” 
Inside the sclerotic coat is a second covering called the 
choroid coat. This has a circular opening in front, directly 
back of the cornea. The part of the choroid coat around this 
opening looks much like a circular curtain, and is called the 
iris. The color of this curtain varies, giving different colors 
to different eyes. The iris is controlled by small muscles so 
that the opening can be made smaller or larger. The opening 
is called the pupil. Its size governs the amount of light which 
can enter the eye. 
The inside coat of the eye is called the retina. This is the 
sensitive part. It receives the light which enters the eye and 
produces the picture. It acts much like the film or plate of 
a camera. Many small branches of the optic nerve end in 
the retina. These nerve endings are affected by the light, 
and send their sensations to the brain, making a mind-picture 
of the objects and colors seen. 
Directly back of the iris is a transparent lens, shaped some- 
thing like a burning-glass or the lens in a camera (Figure 148). 
Since it bulges out on both sides, it is called a double convex 
lens. It is made of soft material, and its shape is readily 
changed by means of muscles attached to it. The muscles 
can make it thinner or flatter and thicker or rounder, as neces- 
sary. The space behind the lens is filled with a transparent 
jelly-like substance called vitreous humor. This keeps the 
eyeball round. Between the cornea and the lens is a clear 
liquid called the aqueous humor. 
How we see. When we see an object, it is because that 
object is sending light to our eyes. The light from the sun, 
an electric light, or some other light-giving body may come 
directly to the eye or be reflected from some object. When 
the rays of light from the object enter the eye, they pass 
through the lens, which bends them, changing their direction 
before they strike the retina.

lens a foot or two in front of the candle (Figure 149), and then 
hold a piece of paper back of the lens so that a distinct image of 
the candle will fall on the paper. The candle is then said to be in 
focus. Note how far back the paper is from the lens. 
(b) Repeat (a), holding the lens more than a foot or two in front 
of the candle. How far back of the lens must the paper be held to 
get a distinct image? 
From this experiment you see that objects close to a lens 
come to a focus farther back than objects far away from a lens. 
Since the retina upon which the image comes to a focus in 
the eye is always the same distance back of the lens, the eye 
must have some method of bringing the rays of light from dis- 
tant and near objects to a focus. This is accomplished by 
changing the shape of the lens. 
Experiment 36: How does the shape of the lens change the 
focus of the rays? 
(a) Obtain two double convex lenses, one more convex than 
the other. 
(b) Place a candle two feet in front of the flatter lens and bring 
the candle to a focus on a piece of paper held behind the lens.

flatter. You can now un- 
derstand how the eye can 
bring far and near objects 
into focus. When an object 
is close to the eye, the 
image would tend to fall 
back of the retina. In order 
to prevent this, the muscles 
contract and make the lens 
more convex so that the 
image will come to a focus on the retina. Ciliary Muscle From the experiment you see 
that the more convex the lens, 
the closer the focus will be. 
The muscles which hold the 
lens of the eye are attached to 
the choroid coat (Figure 150). 
‘When these muscles contract, 
the pull on the lens is lessened, 
and the lens becomes thicker 
or more convex. When the 
muscles relax, the choroid 
coat goes back into place and 
pulls on the lens, making it

Near and Far Objects 
In the upper drawing, the object 
is near the eye and the lens is convex. 
In the lower drawing the object is 
farther away from the eye and the 
lens is less convex. 
By changing the 
pull on the lens, the muscles are therefore able to change 
the convexity of the lens so that the image will always fall 
upon the retina (Figure 151).

How to avoid eye strain. If you study or read for too long 
a time, you are conscious of a sense of eye strain. This is 
due to the fact that the muscles holding the lens must be kept 
contracted so that the page will stay in focus. This fatigues, 
or tires, the muscles, causing a strain. Usually this can be 
avoided by looking up occasionally and focusing the eye on 
some distant object so that the muscles will relax. Too bright 
a light or too dim a light also causes eye strain. When possible, 
the light should come from the left side so that the shadows 
cast by the right hand will not fall on the work. 
Some eyes are defective. Often the eyes themselves are 
so defective that they will not focus properly for far and near 
objects. Defects of this kind can only be remedied by the 
use of glasses. If you are unable to see both far and near objects 
distinctly or if sometimes objects appear blurred, you should 
go to a well trained specialist and have your eyes examined. 
Exercise 10. Far- and near-sightedness are sometimes caused 
by the size of the eyeball, which may be too long or too short. 
Is the eyeball too long or too short in near-sightedness? In far- 
sightedness? Prove your answer by making a drawing something 
like Figure 151. 
Exercise 11. Glasses are worn to correct the defects of near- 
sightedness and far-sightedness. Convex glasses bring the focus 
closer to the lens; concave glasses throw the focus back farther 
from the lens. Which type of glasses would correct near-sighted- 
ness? Far-sightedness? 
Exercise 12. Write a paragraph entitled “How I can take care 
of my eyes.” 
PROBLEM 7: WHAT CAN YOU DO IN CASE OF ACCIDENT? 
Very few people pass through life without coming into con- 
tact with a situation in which they need a knowledge of first 
aid to the injured or sick. Of course, a doctor is necessary 
in a great many cases, but doctors are not always on the spot, 
and in most instances a great deal can be done before the 
doctor arrives.
-P-A-G-E-203
  WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF ACCIDENT 167 
Cuts and scratches should be treated. Perhaps the simplest 
case of first aid is presented by injuries due to cuts or scratches. 
These are not often dangerous, but sometimes the smallest 
cut or scratch may cause death. For this reason they should 
be treated. The first thing 
to do is to make them 
bleed so as to wash out any 
germs which might infect 
them. This is done by 
squeezing them well at the 
sides. If the wound is 
then painted with iodine 
and covered with a piece of 
antiseptic gauze, no danger Fig. 152, Stopping a Bleeding Artery 
of infection will follow. In 
case the wound is serious, the clothing should be removed 
from around it, and the wound exposed to the air. If the 
wound is bleeding freely, it should be bandaged tightly with 
antiseptic gauze, and a doctor should be called at once. 
In case of a cut artery bleeding must be stopped. In some 
cases the blood may come in jets or spurts. This shows that 
an artery has been cut, and it is necessary to check the blood 
flow immediately. Pressure therefore should be applied to 
the artery between the wound and the heart. In case the 
injury is in an arm or leg, this can be done most effectively 
by tying a knot in a handkerchief and laying this over the 
artery (Figure 152). Insert a stick through the bandage and 
twist it so that the knot will apply pressure to the artery, 
and thus stop the bleeding. Loosen the bandage occasionally 
to see if the bleeding has stopped, because if it is kept tight- 
ened too long it will cause trouble. In cases of this kind a 
doctor should be summoned as quickly as possible. 
Bruises and sprains should be treated with cold applica- 
tions. Bruises and sprains may also be treated by first aid. 
Bruises should be treated by placing something cold on them. 
A cloth which has been wrung out in cold water is usually 
   
-P-A-G-E-204
  168 KEEPING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION 
sufficient. In cases of sprain, cold applications are also desir- 
able. Severe sprains should be treated by a physician. 
Drowning and suffocation demand artificial respiration. 
The body must always be able to take in good air and get 
rid of bad air. Inability to do this causes suffocation. When 
a person has been under water for some time or in a room

and suffocation, but also in.cases of severe electric shock where uncon- 
sciousness has resulted. 
containing poisonous gases, breathing stops. These persons 
frequently can be brought back to consciousness by helping 
them to breathe. The American Red Cross textbook on 
First Aid and Relief Columns gives the following directions: 
The patient is laid on the ground, face down. The arm may be 
stretched out at full length over his head, or one arm may be 
bent so the forehead rests upon it. In either case the face must 
be placed slightly to one side so that the ground will not block 
off the air from nose and mouth. As soon as the patient is in 
proper position, the operator kneels at one side, or astride the 
body, but without resting his weight upon it (Figure 153). The 
palms of his hands are placed on the short ribs across the small of 
the back; with the thumbs nearly together. The operator, by let-
-P-A-G-E-205
WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF ACCIDENT 169 
ting his weight fall on his wrists and by bending his body forward, 
decreases the size of the chest and the air is expelled from the 
lungs. The pressure is then released by the operator swinging 
backward; the elastic chest springs out to its original size, and 
the air is drawn into the lungs. The movement is at the rate of 
twelve to fourteen a minute. Better time with a watch.......... 
Whatever the method of artificial respiration used, it should be 
kept up for at least an hour and a half. 
Injuries due to heat and cold need special treatment. 
Another class of injuries which need special attention are 
those due to heat and cold, such as burns and scalds, sun- 
stroke and frost-bite. Burns and scalds should be treated 
by excluding the air. Vaseline, olive oil, cream, or a thin 
paste made of baking soda can be used. The burn should 
then be lightly bandaged. Except in cases of severe burns, 
a doctor is not necessary. In cases of sunstroke a doctor 
should be sent for at once, and in the meantime the patient 
should be treated by rubbing cold water or ice over the face, 
chest, neck, and arm-pits. The object of such treatment is 
to reduce the body temperature. In cases of frost bite the 
frozen part should be brought back to normal temperature 
slowly. This may be done by rubbing the affected part with 
snow or cold water, and then gradually use warm and warmer 
water. 
Foreign bodies in the eye must be removed. Sand, cinders, 
or particles of dust in the eye cause a great deal of pain. In 
removing them, the first thing to remember is not to rub the 
eye, because such rubbing may injure some of the delicate parts. 
If the eye is closed and the tears allowed to accumulate, the 
object will frequently be washed out. Or the upper lid may 
be pulled down over the lower several times. Sometimes if 
the nostril on the opposite side is closed and the patient blows 
his nose very hard, the desired result will be secured. If this 
does not remove the object, have the patient look up, press 
the lower lid down, and examine the lower surface. If the 
object is seen, wipe it off with the corner of a clean handker-

chief or with a piece of cotton. To remove objects under the 
upper lid, have the patient lean back in a chair, place a pencil 
across the upper lid, and turn the lid back over the pencil. 
The patient should look downward.

THE STORY OF UNIT VI 
The kind of clothing 
which people wear depends 
to a great extent upon the 
climate. Of course, there 
are great differences in the 
cut and style of clothes, 
which have no relation to 
climate, but even the prevailing fashions follow the dictates 
of Mother Nature. In regions where it is hot the year round, 
as in parts of Africa, the chief characteristic of clothing is 
its scantiness (Figure 154). In the land of the Eskimo heavy

furs and hides are the prevailing mode (Figure 155). In our 
own country, where the climate changes from season to season, 
a great variety of clothing is worn. 
Clothes are necessary to protect our bodies from the heat 
and cold. You all know that the temperature of the healthy 
human body is al- 
ways the same. It 
varies somewhat in 
different persons, 
but it is approxi- 
mately 98.6°F. At 
this temperature 
our bodies feel most 
comfortable and 
can work most effi- 
ciently. The body 
is like a gasoline

drum-beaters in Figure 154. or too cold. When 
you go out on co!d days, the body must be sufficiently coy- 
ered so that the heat produced inside you cannot escape. 
Otherwise the body may get chilled. On hot days the prob- 
lem is to wear clothing which allows the body heat to escape 
and which will not absorb too much heat from the outside 
air. Selecting the proper kind of clothing and clothing ma- 
terials to adapt oneself to changes in climate depends on one’s 
knowledge of the different materials and on common sense. 
If you go into a dry-goods store or look in the windows of 
a big department store, you see all kinds and colors of mate- 
rials from which clothing is made. If you ask the names of 
the different kinds of goods, you will hear such words as dimity, 
organdy, mohair, crépe de Chine, swiss, lawn, crash, serge, 
worsted, linen, velvet, velour, satin, cashmere, tweed, voile, 
calico, and many others. All of these different kinds of cloth,
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE STORY OF UNIT VI 173 
or fabrics, are made from four kinds of raw materials, or fibers: 
wool, silk, cotton, and flax. We can go still further and 
classify the fibers as either animal or vegetable fibers. Woo 
comes from sheep, silk is spun by the silkworm (Figure 156), 
cotton grows on the cotton plant po 
(Figures 157 and 158), and linen is 
made from the fibers of the flax 
plant. Fabrics may be woven from 
a single raw material, or they may 
be a mixture of different materials. 
The different kinds of cloth are 
due to differences in weave and to 
the kinds of fiber they contain, but 
each may be classified as wool, silk, 
cotton, linen, or mixed goods. 
Each kind of material has certain 
properties which make it valuable 
for use as clothing. For our sum- 
mer clothes we use one kind of ma- 
terial; for our winter clothes we use 
another. Clothing worn next to the 
skin must also have different prop- Fig. 156. Cocoon of the Silk-

which are used to make clothing, body this cocoon made of fine : cf silk fibers. two other materials are in general 
use, rubber and leather. By the use of these materials we 
secure added warmth and protection for our clothing and 
bodies on rainy days. Thus by varying the kind of clothing 
worn, we can successfully adapt ourselves to hot and cold as 
well as to wet and dry weather. 
Fibers may be distinguished from each other, because each 
has certain physical and chemical properties. Each kind of 
fiber possesses certain characteristics which identify it if it is 
examined under a high-power microscope. This is probably 
the surest test, although there are others that may be used.

Some fibers absorb water or oil more rapidly than others; this 
test may be used to distinguish them. Experts can generally 
ell the kind of fiber by the feel of the cloth. Tests like those 
described above are called physical tests. Vegetable fibers 
can be distinguished very easily by burning them or by treat- 
ing them with certain chemicals, as you will find in a later

experiment. Cotton cannot be distinguished from linen by 
a chemical test because they are both composed of the same 
elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Silk is composed 
of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen; and wool con- 
tains the same elements as silk, with the addition of sulphur. 
Because of their different composition, these fibers can be 
distinguished by chemical tests, that is, by seeing how different 
chemicals act upon them. 
Economy, sanitation, and our own pride demand that we 
keep our clothes clean and in good condition. You probably

have never thought that there is science in “washing clothes,” 
but if you watch some one ‘do a washing”’ you will see many 
things which will puzzle you. You know that different chem- 
icals, such as washing soda and borax, are used, but do you 
know why? Some clothes are washed in very hot water and 
may be rinsed in cold water, but 
others must be washed in warm water 
and rinsed in water of the same tem- 
perature. Some clothes may be 
rubbed vigorously on a washboard, 
while others should not be. By mak- 
ing good soapsuds the labor required 
to get the clothes clean is greatly re- 
duced, but different kinds of soap 
must be used for different fabrics.

to determine the kind of stain. One must know whether it is 
grease, ink, paint, mildew, blood, grass, or rust, and each kind 
of stain must be removed by a different method, depending 
upon the chemical nature of the stain and of the fiber.

PROBLEM 1: HOW DOES CLOTHING KEEP 
US WARM OR COOL? 
The body must regulate its temperature. During the sum- 
mer time when it is very warm, the clothing must help the 
body get rid of heat and also keep the heat of the air from 
warming the body. During the winter it must prevent the 
loss of heat. The body itself has several methods of keeping 
its temperature constant, but sometimes the heat-regulating 
mechanism of the body is interfered with by the clothes we 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  176 SELECTING AND CARING FOR CLOTHING 
wear. We must, therefore, first understand how the body 
regulates its temperature. 
Heat and energy are produced in the body by the combina 
tion of oxygen with the food which one eats. (See page 85.) 
The amount of heat produced depends upon the quantity of 
heat-producing foods which are eaten and upon the amount 
of oxidation which takes place within the body. On very hot 
days when one exercises vigorously more heat may be pro- 
duced than is necessary to keep the body at the correct tem- 
perature (98.6°F.); consequently, the body must get rid of 
some of its heat. You have already seen that under such 
circumstances the blood vessels in the skin get larger, and 
greater amounts of blood flow through it. (See page 158.) If 
the body is warmer than the surrounding air or clothing, some 
of its heat changes to radiant energy (see page 40), and the 
body thus loses heat. We say that the body loses heat by 
radiation. The amount of heat changed to radiant energy de- 
pends upon the difference between the temperature of the 
body and that of its surroundings. When the blood vessels in 
the skin are dilated, that is, when the muscles are relaxed, 
more blood flows through the skin, and more heat is changed 
to radiant energy. 
The body is also cooled by passing on some of its heat to 
the clothing and air. 
Experiment 37: How does the body give up heat? 
(a). Obtain a piece of metal. Allow it to remain in the room 
long enough to have the same temperature as the air in the room. 
(b) Touch the piece of metal with your finger. Does it feel cold 
or warm? 
The metal is at a lower temperature than the body. Heat 
therefore passes from the body to the metal. The particles 
of which the metal is composed are able to pass this heat 
along to the other particles, that is, to conduct the heat. The 
metal feels colder than other objects in the room, such as the 
table, because the metal conducts heat away from the body.
-P-A-G-E-213
  BODY TEMPERATURE AND CLOTHING 177 
Likewise, air and clothing in contact with the body conduct 
heat away from the body if they are at a lower temperature. 
A third way in which the body loses heat is by pouring per- 
spiration on the skin. (See Figure 146, page 157.) Part of 
this perspiration evaporates directly from the skin, and part 
is absorbed by the clothing and then evaporated. 
Experiment 38: What effect does evaporation of a liquid have upon 
the temperature of the body from which it evaporates? 
Take the temperature of the room. Tie a small piece of cotton 
around the bulb of the thermometer. Dip the bulb of the ther- 
mometer in some water which is at room temperature. Remove 
the thermometer from the water and allow it to stand for one 
minute. Note the temperature. Read the next paragraph and ex- 
plain it on the basis of this experiment. 
It requires heat to change water or any liquid to a gas. The 
perspiration which is given off through the skin changes to 
water vapor, and the heat necessary to make it do this is 
taken from the body, which is thereby cooled. 
Under certain conditions water evaporates quickly, and under 
other conditions it evaporates slowly. The rate at which it 
evaporates can be measured by the cooling effect. The follow- 
ing experiment shows the effect of air currents and the amount 
of water in the air upon the rate of evaporation. 
Experiment 39: Upon what does the rate of evaporation depend? 
(a) Repeat Experiment 38 and note the number of degrees 
change in temperature. 
(b) Fan the thermometer which has the wet cotton on the bulb. 
Note the temperature and compare with the results obtained in 
(a). What effect does the movement of the air have upon the 
rate of evaporation? Remember that the greater the evapora- 
tion, the greater will be the cooling effect. 
(c) Pour water into a test tube to a depth of one-half inch. 
Cork the test tube tightly and allow it to stand until the next day. 
The air in the test tube will be saturated with water vapor. On 
the next day insert a thermometer in a one-holed cork which will 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  178 SELECTING AND CARING FOR CLOTHING 
fit the test tube. Tie a small piece of cotton around the bulb and 
moisten it. Then quickly remove the cork from the test tube and 
insert the cork containing the thermometer. Push the bulb of 
the thermometer down into the water and record the temperature. 
Then raise the thermometer until the bulb is in the saturated air. 
Allow the thermometer to stay in this position for one minute and 
then read the temperature. Compare the temperature change 
with the results obtained in (a). What effect does the presence 
of a large quantity of water vapor in the air have upon the rate 
of evaporation? 
The rate of evaporation from the body is increased by con- 
tact of the body with a current of air; it therefore loses heat 
much faster than when it is surrounded by still air. This 
explains why you become chilled when sitting in a draft or 
wind after exercising. When the air is very humid or full 
of water vapor, evaporation takes place very slowly. Under 
such conditions the body cannot lose much heat by evaporation. 
Exercise 1. Explain how the body automatically keeps its 
temperature at about 98.6°F. 
Clothing assists the body in maintaining an even tempera- 
ture. The rate at which the body loses heat by conduction 
and radiation and by the evaporation of perspiration can be 
largely controlled by the selection of the proper kind of under- 
wear and outer clothing. In the summer time underwear 
must be made of materials which will absorb the perspira- 
tion quickly and which will lose it rapidly. Cotton and 
linen possess these characteristics and therefore make satis- 
factory summer underwear. Silk also absorbs water quickly 
and loses it rapidly, but its high cost prevents general wear. 
The outer clothing in the summer must also lose its moisture 
quickly, because if it does not, the layer of air between the 
inner and outer clothing will become saturated with water and 
prevent evaporation from the skin. Outer clothing for summer 
wear is largely cotton, linen, silk, or a mixture of wool with 
cotton and silk.
-P-A-G-E-215
BODY TEMPERATURE AND CLOTHING 179 
The most noticeable difference in summer and winter cloth- 
ing is the difference in color. Dark-colored clothes are worn 
in the winter and light-colored clothes in the summer. In 
the summer time we receive much radiant energy from the 
sun. This energy is absorbed by our clothing, and the heat 
is conducted to the body. The amount of energy absorbed 
depends somewhat on the color of the material, as shown by 
the following experiment. 
Experiment 40: Which absorbs more radiant energy, light- 
or dark-colored cloth? 
Obtain two test tubes of the same size. Wrap a piece of white 
cotton cloth around one test tube and a piece of dark cloth around 
the other. Arrange them 
as shown in Figure 31, 
page 40. Now place the 
apparatus in bright sun- 
light, and after several 
minutes read the tem- 
perature in each tube. 
Which of the two pieces 
of cloth absorbs the more 
heat? Explain how the 
experiment shows this. 
  ; Fig. 159. Loosely Woven and Tightl In winter the greater e eee Fabrics oo 
amount of heat is lost 
from the body by conduction and radiation, because the 
amount of perspiration which evaporates from the body is 
small. The problem of selecting clothing in winter is that of 
securing materials which will not readily conduct heat. 
Wool is the poorest conductor of heat and can be woven very 
loosely. When woven loosely, it contains large air spaces 
between the meshes (Figure 159). Air is a very poor conductor 
of heat and thus aids the wool in preventing loss of heat by 
conduction. For undergarments a mixture of cotton and 
wool is superior to all-wool, because the cotton prevents the 
closing of the mesh when the wool is washed. For outside 
   
-P-A-G-E-216
  180 SELECTING AND CARING FOR CLOTHING 
wear in the winter, wool is the most satisfactory material 
because of its weight, its looseness of weave, and its non- 
conductivity of heat. 
Rubber and leather do not absorb water readily. Water 
cannot pass through rubber, which is, therefore, used for rain- 
coats and for overshoes. Leather does not absorb water 
readily, and can be made waterproof by certain waterproof 
dressings which fill up the pores. Damp clothing of any kind 
is very dangerous to the wearer, especially in the winter when 
he may be exposed to drafts. The evaporation of the mois- 
ture rapidly lowers the body temperature and makes it easy 
to “catch cold.” A good raincoat and a pair of rubbers are 
necessities for everyone, and will more than pay for them- 
selves by keeping one’s clothes and shoes in good condition 
and by preventing sickness.

PROBLEM 2: HOW CAN YOU KNOW THE KINDS OF 
FIBERS IN YOUR CLOTHES? 
Some time in the future a law will probably be passed requir- 
ing cloth manufacturers to label their goods with such marks 
as “all linen,” “half cotton,” “wool,” or “wool and cotton.” 
Until that time comes the purchaser must have some way of 
telling whether a material is what it is said to be. There are 
many ways of adulterating fabrics, that is, adding foreign 
materials to them. One is to weight the cloth by filling the 
open mesh with gums, clays, starches, or other materials. After 
the cloth is washed, these materials fall out and leave a much 
more open mesh or weave. Silk is very commonly adulterated 
in this fashion to increase its weight. A common practice 
is to combine cotton and wool, or cotton and linen, and then
-P-A-G-E-217

sell the product as fine wool or pure linen. Cotton is sometimes 
treated with chemicals so that it resembles silk or linen.

Fibers 
Wool fibers are 
obtained from differ-

ance. Microscopes are 
used to test fibers. Each kind of fiber has 
a certain characteristic appearance when 
examined under a microscope. The cotton 
fiber has a natural twist, and under the 
microscope it appears as a twisted, 
smooth, flat band (Figure 161). The 
fibers are from one to two inches long 
and have a diameter of about .0007 inch. 
A small thread is composed of thousands 
of these tiny fibers so interwoven that 
it is difficult to distinguish them. The 
wool fiber under the microscope appears 
kinky and has an outer covering like the 
scales of a fish, each scale overlapped 
by the one above (Figure 162). These 
scales are really tiny cells which make 
up the outer covering of the wool. The

Fibers may be tested at home. To de- 
termine the kind of fibers in a fabric when 
a microscope is not available, it is necessary 
to use certain chemical or physical tests, such 
as those given in the following experiment. 
Experiment 41: How can fibers be identified? 
1. Burning test 
(a) Obtain a piece of cotton cloth. Light 
a small piece with a match. Observe the odor, 
the color of the flame, and the rapidity of 
burning. 
(b) Repeat (a), using linen. 
(c) Repeat (a), using wool. 
(d) Repeat (a), using silk. 
2. Litmus test 
(a) Moisten a strip of blue litmus paper. 
Heat a piece of cotton in a dry test tube and 
hold the litmus paper in the smoke which 
comes from the tube. Note the color change. 
Repeat, using a strip of red litmus paper, and 
note any color change. 
(b) Repeat (a), using linen. 
(c) Repeat (a), using wool. 
(d) Repeat (a), using silk. 
3. Lye test 
(a) Make a solution of two teaspoonfuls 
of lye to a cup of water or use a five per cent

five minutes. Pour the solution and cotton out into’a small dish. 
Remove the cotton from the lye with a pair of forceps, and rinse 
it in water. Test the strength of the cloth. 
(b) Repeat (a), using linen. 
(c) Repeat (a), using wool. 
(d) Repeat (a), using silk. 
4. To distinguish cotton from linen 
(a) Obtain a piece of mixed cotton and linen fabric. Place it 
in a beaker of water to which have been added two or three drops 
of hydrochloric acid, and heat. This will remove the starch and 
other materials which have been added to the cloth to make it 
stiffer. 
(6) Allow the fabric to dry and then place a drop of olive oil 
on it. Note that the linen threads absorb the oil more rapidly 
than the cotton threads. 
5. To distinguish wool from silk 
(a) Heat a piece of wool in a test tube. Hold a strip of filter 
paper moistened with lead acetate at the mouth of the tube. 
Result? 
(b) Repeat (a), using a clean test tube, with silk. Does the 
paper change color?

PROBLEM 3: HOW ARE CLOTHES LAUNDERED? 
There are two principal classes of substances which must 
be removed by washing: (1) body perspiration which con- 
tains oily materials, and (2) particles of dirt or grease caught 
in the meshes of the fabric. These are usually removed by the 
use of soap or other chemicals. 
Soap is the most common substance used for washing 
clothes. Did you ever try to wash grease from your hands 
with plain water? A sticky, greasy 
mass is the only result; the water 
will not remove the grease. But the 
addition of soap, followed by rubbing, 
will remove it. How does the soap 
work? 
Experiment 42: Why does the addition 
of soap to water help remove 
  grease?

emulsified to form these Does the oil mix with the water? Allow

Are the oil and water mixed? 
(b) Rub some soap in 100 c. ¢. of water until good suds or lather 
is formed. Pour this into a bottle, add ten to twelve drops of 
olive oil, and shake vigorously. Do the oil and the soap solution mix? 
Let the mixture stand until the next day. Compare results with 
those of part (a) of the experiment. 
When a greasy fabric is rubbed with soapy water, the par- 
ticles of grease are broken up into finer particles. Each of 
the finer particles is surrounded by a film of soapy water and 
is suspended, or floats, in the soapy water in the form of a tiny 
drop. This is called an emulsion (Figure 165). The soap is 
said to emulsify the oil or grease. These small emulsified 
particles of oil or grease may then be carried away by rinsing 
the fabric.
-P-A-G-E-221
LAUNDERING CLOTHES 185 
Soft water is better than hard water for the laundry. Prac- 
tically all natural water, with the exception of rain water, 
contains minerals which have been dissolved out of the rocks 
and soil. Water which contains but few minerals is said to be 
“soft,’’ while water which contains large quantities of certain 
minerals is called “hard water.” For laundry purposes the 
soft water is more satisfactory than hard water. 
Experiment 43: Why is soft water more desirable than hard 
water for laundry purposes? 
(a) Make a soap solution by placing Ivory or castile shavings 
in a bottle of rain water or distilled water. Add shavings until 
no more soap will dissolve after the bottle is well shaken. 
(6) To a test tube half full of distilled water or rain water, add 
the soapy water made in (a) drop by drop (use a medicine dropper), 
shaking after each drop. (The test tube should be stoppered, 
or covered securely with the thumb, while shaking.) When a 
layer of lather about one-half inch deep remains on top of the 
water for a minute, the test is complete. How many drops are 
necessary to make this lather? 
(c) Repeat (b), using, instead of distilled water, water from a 
well or from the city supply. Compare the amount of soap re- 
quired to make a lather with the amount required for the same 
volume of distilled water. 
(d) Make up some very hard water by dissolving some calcium 
sulphate or magnesium sulphate in distilled water. Repeat (6). 
Hold the test tube up to the light and note the tiny flakes in the 
water. Compare the amounts required in (a), (6), and (c). What 
is your conclusion? 
The next question which we must answer is, “Why does 
it take more soap to make suds with hard water than it does 
with soft water?’’? When soap was added to the hard water 
in part (d) of the preceding experiment, your attention was 
called to the white flakes which were formed. These flakes 
were formed by the combination of the soap with the minerals 
in the water. The new materials which were formed were not 
soluble in water; so they separated out as solids. Chemists 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  186 SELECTING AND CARING FOR CLOTHING 
say that such insoluble materials are precipitated, because they 
settle to the bottom. Before the soap would form suds, it was 
necessary to remove all of the minerals which caused the soap 
to precipitate. After this was done, the soap could form 
suds and remove the dirt. 
Many substances may be used to soften water. When 
soft water is not available for washing purposes, it is custom- 
ary to add certain materials, such as 
borax, washing soda, or ammonia, 
to the hard water. 
Experiment 44: What effect do borax, 
washing soda, and ammonia 
have upon hard water? 
(a) For use in this experiment make 
some hard water as in part (d) of

Exercise 5. Write a paragraph on “The Use of Hard Water for 
Laundry Purposes,” telling why hard water should not be used 
unless softened, how it can be softened,-and why soft water should 
be used. 
There are several steps in the proper washing of clothes. 
When the clothes are soaked, the dirt is softened by the swelling

LAUNDERING CLOTHES — 187 
of the fibers. Wool and silk should never be soaked for a long 
time in water with soap which contains free lye, or alkali, or 
in water containing washing soda. In both cases the alkali 
in the soap and the alkali formed by the washing soda will 
attack the fiber and weaken it. Wool and silk should never 
be soaked in hot water and immediately put into cold water. 
Both the wool fiber and the silk fiber, being composed of animal 
material, are very sensi- 
tive to heat and cold. In 
wool, you remember, the 
outer covering consists of 
scale-like cells which over- 
lap. In the presence of 
alkalies or in changing 
from hot to cold water, the 
scales interlock and the : 
fibers shrink to a felt-like i 
mass. This is called felting (b)

or by hot and cold water.      
Exercise 6. Why do woolen sweaters sometimes shrink and lose 
their soft feel when washed? 
After clothes are soaked for an hour or two, it is the custom 
to rub them on a washboard or to place them in a washing- 
machine (Figure 166). This assists the action of the soap by 
bringing it into closer contact with the particles of dust and 
grease, and thus helps remove them from the clothes. Too much 
rubbing will cause wool to felt and lose its softness and elas- 
ticity. Hard rubbing also breaks the fibers of silk, weakens 
them, and takes away the luster. Cotton and linen materials 
may be rubbed without injury, but in the case of colored mate- 
rials, more soaking and less rubbing are desirable. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
188 SELECTING AND CARING FOR CLOTHING 
All soap, dirt, and materials released by the action of water- 
softeners must be removed by rinsing in water. It is much 
better to rinse in warm water, because the soap will dissolve 
better in warm water than in cod. In rinsing wool or silk 
the temperature of the rinsing water should be as near that 
of the washing water as possible. Cotton and linen may be 
rinsed in either cold or hot water, because heat has very little 
effect upon vegetable fibers. 
Generally the clothes are whitened by means of blueing. 
Did you ever notice what appeared to be rust stains on cloth- 
ing? One kind of blueing contains iron. Alkalies, such as 
are found in some soaps and weshing soda, act chemically 
upon this blueing, forming iron rust, thus leaving a stain on 
the fabric. To prevent rust from forming, it is only neces- 
sary to rinse the clothes carefully in order to make sure that 
all of the alkalies are removed. After blueing, the clothes 
are wrung out and hung up to dry. 
Exercise 7. State the steps in wishing clothes, and explain 
the importance of each step. 
Exercise 8. In what ways should the washing of animal and vege- 
table fibers differ? 
PROBLEM 4: HOW ARE SPOTS AND STAINS REMOVED 
FROM CLOTHING? 
In removing spots and stains from clothing two things must 
be kept in mind: (1) the nature of the fabric, and (2) the kind 
of stain. The vegetable fibers which, compose cotton and linen 
are very resistant to the action of chemicals and are not easily 
injured by rubbing. The animal fibers which compose wool 
and silk cannot be treated with as strong chemicals or rubbed 
so vigorously as the vegetable fibers. There are three general 
methods of removing spots and stains: (1) by dissolving the 
stain in some material such as water, alcohol, gasoline, benzine, 
naphtha, chloroform, or carbon tetrachloride; (2) by absorbing 
the stain with blotting paper, powdered French chalk, or mag- 
nesia; and (3) by chemical action.
-P-A-G-E-225
  
REMOVING SPOTS AND STAINS 189 
The first thing to do in removing a stain is to determine the 
kind of stain. Look over your own clothes and find some spots 
or stains. What kinds are they? There are many varieties, 
but we shall study the removal of only the common ones. 
Experiment 45: How can grease spots and stains be removed 
by dissolving the stain or grease? 
(a) Make a small grease spot on a piece of cloth by placing a 
drop of oil on it. Moisten a rag with one of the following sub- 
stances: benzine, gasoline, naphtha, ether, alcohol, or carbon 
tetrachloride. (Caution: All of these liquids, with the exception 
of carbon tetrachloride, are inflammable. Keep away from a 
flame.) Always rub from the outside of the spot towards the 
center. Why? If one of the liquids will not remove the spot, 
try others until one is found that will. 
(6) Place a little fruit juice on a piece of white cloth. Pour 
boiling water through the cloth. Result? Explain. 
Experiment 46: How are grease spots and stains removed by 
absorbing the grease or stain? 
(a) Place some powdered French chalk or magnesium carbonate 
over a grease spot on a piece of cloth. Allow it to stand for several 
hours. Result? How is the grease removed? 
(6) Place a piece of cloth with a grease spot on it between two 
blotting papers. Press with a hot iron. Result? What is the 
purpose of the hot iron? Of the blotting paper? 
(c) Place a drop of ink on any white fabric. Before the ink 
dries, place the fabric in a cup of milk and let it stand for several 
days. Remove the fabric and rinse it in water. Result? 
In the two methods of removing grease or stains described 
in Experiments 45 and 46, it was not necessary to use ma- 
terials which have a chemical action on the grease or stains. 
Some stains, however, can be removed only by using materials 
which will act chemically upon them. If the fabric is white, 
this can be done without danger to the fabric. If the fabric 
is colored, the action of the chemical may be such as to cause 
the color of the fabric to change, and great care must be taken. 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
190 SELECTING AND CARING FOR CLOTHING 
Experiment 47: How are spots and stains removed by 
chemical action? 
(a) Procure a piece of cloth stained with iron rust. Wet the 
stain with water, touch it with a arop of hydrochloric acid on the 
end of a stirring rod (Figure 168), and rinse the fabric in water. 
Theiron rust is changed by the acid 
intoa soluble material which washes 
away. Whenrinsed, add a drop of 
ammonium hydroxide, which will 
act upon any acid which remains 
to form a new harmless substance. 
(b) Obtain a piece of white cot- 
ton material and spot it with ink. 
Make a weak solution of calcium 
hypochlorite, or, as it is com- 
monly called, bleaching powder. 
  Fig. 168. Apparatus for Experi- i 5 
ment 47 Soak the cotton in the solution 
and add a few drops of dilute 
hydrochloric acid. After the spot is bleached, rinse thoroughly and 
dry. The solution of bleaching powder should not be used in 
bleaching silk or woolen materials because the chlorine attacks 
the fiber and weakens it. 
Exercise 9. Make a list of the kinds of spots or stains which 
you usually get on your clothes. After each one list the appropriate 
method of removing it. If you do not know how to remove it, 
experiment with the methods given until you learn how.

THE STORY OF UNIT VIL 
In Unit V you learned the importance of keeping physically 
fit. You saw that proper care of your body is essential to 
your efficiency, comfort, and enjoyment in life. In this unit 
you will learn more about the causes of diseases, and how they 
are spread. With such knowledge you will not only be better 
able to guard your own health, but you will also know how 
192
-P-A-G-E-229
  THE STORY OF UNIT VII 193 
to safeguard your neighbor’s health and thereby make your 
neighborhood, town, or city a better place in which to live. 
Most of the diseases which attack you spread from one 
person to another. They are called communicable diseases, 
or contagious diseases, that is, dis- 
eases which may be passed on, or 
communicated, to others. Perhaps 
you have “caught” a cold or taken 
some other sickness from your play- 
mates; similarly, you may have 
passed on such disease to your 
friends. Carelessness and thought- 
lessness, or ignorance about the 
cause of disease and how it is spread, 
are not excusable, for we know to- 
day how to prevent the dangers of 
most communicable diseases. 
For centuries men lived in igno- 
rance of the causes of communicable , 5 Underwood and Underwood 
diseases. Often the diseases spread Fig. 169. Louis Pasteur

oceur. Perhaps you recall or have heard of the terrible epi- 
demic of influenza (‘‘flu””) which killed more than a half million 
persons in 1918. The great loss of lives from such epidemics is, 
however, becoming less and less since man has learned what 
causes such diseases and how to guard against them. 
Probably all communicable diseases are caused by germs, 
which as you know are very tiny invisible living plants or 
animals. These germs, on account of their small size, enter 
our bodies without our knowing it. They were discovered 
in 1865 by Louis Pasteur, a Frenchman, one of the greatest 
scientists of all time (Figure 169). His discovery was made 
while he was examining silkworms in France. He found the 
little germs in the bodies of the worms which became sick,
-P-A-G-E-230
  194 PROTECTING OURSELVES FROM DISEASE 
or died. Later he and other scientists studied the causes of 
disease in other animals and in man. As a result of these 
wonderful studies it has been proved that there are many 
kinds of germs. Those which cause disease are called patho- 
genic, which means “sorrow- 
producing.” Each of the va- 
rious communicable diseases 
is very likely caused by a 
different pathogenic germ, 
which may be communicated 
from one person to another. 
As soon as the cause of a 
disease is known, scientists 
can study how to treat the 
disease and how to keep it 
from spreading. Having thus 
studied the different disease 
germs which are known at 
the present time, they have   
  Fig. 170. A Dangerous Playmate 
The coughing boy not only has 
bad manners, but may spread dis- 
ease to his friends by means of the 
spray from his mouth. found many ways in which 
these are spread. One of 
the most common ways is 
through contact with clothing 
or articles touched by a sick 
person. Thus, handkerchiefs, bed-clothes, pencils, fruit, candy, 
drinking cups, and clothing may act as germ carriers. Coughing 
and sneezing also spread germs which travel on the small drop- 
lets of water thrown from the nose or mouth (Figure 170). 
Many animals act as carriers. Among these are flies, mosqui- 
toes, lice, dogs, and human beings. Still other common sources 
of disease germs are impure water and impure food. Later 
you will learn of other carriers, and find that not all kinds of 
germs are spread in the same way. 
The knowledge of the means of spreading disease suggests 
to you various ways to prevent taking a disease from your 
neighbor, or passing it on to others. The most important
-P-A-G-E-231
  THE STORY OF UNIT VII 195 
method of prevention has been studied in Unit V, that is, 
keeping physically fit. This is the best insurance against 
germs. Other methods of preventing 
disease are: (1) to avoid handling objects 
belonging to sick persons (Figure 171); 
(2) to avoid persons who cough or 
sneeze, and to protect others from your 
coughs and sneezes (Figure 172); (3) to 
ventilate your rooms well, for some dis- 
eases may be spread in the air; (4) to 
disinfect, or cleanse from germs, all 
clothing and articles touched by a person 
recovering from a communicable dis- 
ease; (5) to protect your food from the 
dangerous organisms; (6) to be sure that 
your water supply is pure; and (7) to 
heed the advice of nurses, doctors, and 
others who have become expert by ex- 
perience and study. You can perhaps 
add many more ways to this list. 
While an ounce of prevention is worth 
more than a pound of cure, we do not

  always avoid disease, and must, 
therefore, suffer sickness at times. 
Even though the body has in it cer- 
tain materials which may kill the 
germs, it is not always successful 
in its fight against these invisible 
enemies. If you are unfortunate 
enough to catch a disease, it becomes 
your duty to receive the proper 
medical attention and to do every- 
thing which you can to protect 
others from your sickness. You 
should follow the advice of doctors and boards of health. 
They have made a careful study of ways of caring for and

    196 PROTECTING OURSELVES FROM DISEASE 
treating the human body to cure it and to protect it against 
the ravages of disease. Medical treatment, quarantine, and 
other safeguards are the result of scientific study by thousands 
of trained physicians and scientists. 
Above all you should avoid using patent medicines, and 
refuse to consult ‘‘quack” doctors. Thousands and thousands 
of dollars are foolishly spent every day for these two kinds 
of frauds. Not only do they usually fail to cure sick people, 
but, what is worse, they do people such harm that it becomes 
much more difficult for good doctors to repair the damage 
done and cure the patient.

in its appearance and in its action. When seen under the

in Figure 1738. You should realize that there is a great 
variety of bacteria, not all of which are injurious or danger- 
ous. Many, like those which help to make the soil a better 
home for plants and those which destroy refuse by decay, 
are helpful to man. Others are harmless. Still others, the

pathogenic bacteria, are our worst enemies. It is these patho- 
genic bacteria which cause such contagious diseases as diph- 
theria, tuberculosis, measles, and typhoid fever. 
Animal germs also cause sickness. The animal organisms 
which cause disease are not so common as bacteria. These 
animal germs are one-celled and so much like bacteria that it 
is very hard to tell the difference between them (Figure 174). 
Several common diseases are caused by them, including dysen- 
tery, malarial fever, and sleeping sickness. 
  
  Fig. 174. A Malarial Parasite 
No. (1) shows how the parasites develop in odcysts on the outside 
of the mosquito’s stomach. No. (2) shows the many sporozoites within 
a single odcyst. In No. (3) one of the red-blood corpuscles has been 
invaded by a malarial parasite. Here it divides into many sections as 
shown in No. (4), breaking the wall of the red corpuscle. The new 
parasites and the poisons, No. (5), enter the blood stream. 
Germs are parasites and produce poisons. Any plant or 
animal which lives in the body of another living thing and takes 
its food from that living thing is known as a parasite. The 
living thing which furnishes the food is the host. The most 
dangerous of the animal and plant parasites are the pathogenic 
germs. 
Under favorable conditions germs grow very rapidly. If 
the body does not throw them off, or is not in good enough 
physical condition to keep them from growing, they begin to 
get larger. In a short time they divide into two cells in 
the same way that other cells do (see Figure 73, page 84). 
Then the two may grow and produce four. Thus, if a single
-P-A-G-E-234
  198 PROTECTING OURSELVES FROM DISEASE 
germ gets into the body and divides into two new germs in a 
half hour and these continue to multiply at the same rate, 
there may be formed over sixteen million germs in a half day. 
During their growth they attack different parts of the body, 
feeding upon the body cells and producing poisons called 
toxins. In many cases these toxins get into the blood and 
cause general sickness. Such general poisoning is called toxemia. 
Sometimes the toxins remain in certain parts and cause only 
local swelling, redness, and pain, as in some cases of sore throat 
or in boils. 
If the body does not conquer the germs, they continue to 
multiply and their poisons are produced in great quantity. 
These toxins first produce certain symptoms, or signs, such as 
a tired feeling, pain, headache, or fever. It is by the study of 
these symptoms that the doctor is usually able to diagnose, or 
identify, a disease. Often the place where the germs enter 
the body, such as the nose, throat, or a cut, becomes red, or 
inflamed. If the sickness or infection continues, more and 
more poisons are formed, and cause severe illness. In cases of 
local infections the germs may form pus, as in boils or abscesses. 
If the body is finally able to overcome the germs and their 
poisons, the body becomes well, but if the poisons are pro- 
duced in such great quantity that the body cannot success- 
fully combat them, death results. 
Exercise 1. Name the diseases you have had, and following 
each, state the symptoms which led you and the doctor to know 
what the disease was. 
Exercise 2. Make a class survey and enter your results in a 
table which shows the different communicable diseases members 
of the class have had and how many have had each disease. Which 
are the most common diseases for your group? 
Exercise 3. A single typhoid germ in a glass of water may make 
you seriously ill. How is this possible? 
Exercise 4. Calculate the possible number of germs produced in 
12 hours by a single germ. Compare your results with the number 
for a half a day stated in this problem.

PROBLEM 2: HOW ARE GERMS SPREAD? 
Every contagious disease is caused by a particular kind of 
germ coming from someone who has that disease. In some 
way the germ must be transferred or communicated to the 
person who becomes sick. Let us see more clearly how these 
dangerous parasites are spread, so that you can better under- 
stand how to avoid them. 
Experiment 48: How may germs be spread? 
Prepare several “bacteria gardens,” or ‘‘cultures,” as follows: 
Obtain several small round dishes or pans and an equal number 
of larger dishes which may act as covers for the smaller dishes. 
(Use petri-dishes and covers if available.) Place all of the dishes 
in clean water and boil the water for an hour. In the meantime 
place about four ounces of gelatine (used for making jello) in a 
quart of water. Add one-half ounce of beef extract or about a 
half pint of rich beef broth, one-half ounce of peptone (this is 
not absolutely necessary), a pinch of salt, and a pinch of baking 
soda. Heat the mixture until the gelatine is dissolved and the 
liquid is clear. Remove the dishes from the hot water and imme- 
diately pour enough of the hot culture liquid into each of the small 
dishes to make a thin layer on the bottom of the dish. Be sure to 
rest the dishes on a level surface. Cover the dishes with the larger 
dishes turned upside down. When the gelatine has cooled and 
hardened proceed as follows: 
1. Open the first dish for a half-hour to allow the air to come in 
contact with the culture; then cover. 
2. Open the second dish for only a moment and cough into it; 
then cover. 
3. Open the third dish and pour a-few drops of drinking water 
on the gelatine, spreading it around by shaking the dish; 
then cover. 
4. Open the fourth dish and rub your fingers across the culture; 
then cover. 
5. Leave the fifth dish covered. 
Keep all dishes in a warm place at about 70° or 80°F. for two or 
three days and then examine the “‘gardens.’”’ If bacteria have

entered, they will grow and produce white or yellow spots, as 
shown in Figures 175, 176, and 177. 
    Fig. 175. Petri-Dish 
Culture 
The cover was removed 
for 20 minutes. The large 
snow-like patch is a 
mold growth; the small 
spots are colonies of bac- 
teria.   
      
Fig. 176. Petri-Dish 
Culture 
The bright part, which 
looks like a finger-print, 
shows where a few drops 
of water were spread. 
There are many small 
colonies of bacteria here. Each bacterium grows in- 
to thousands, 
which make 
one of these 
little spots. 
The fifth dish 
will show no 
spots (Figure 
178). What 
conclusions to 
the question of 
the experiment 
do you reach? 
Note: If the 
gelatine = cul- 
tures cannot be 
made, you can 
use slices of 
potato. Wash 
the potato, slice it into pieces about one-quarter inch thick, and place 
these in saucers   
ordishes. Steam 
the saucers and 
potato — slices 
for a half hour; 
then remove 
and cover im- 
mediately with 
larger dishes. 
When the dish-

  Someone rubbed his fin- 
gers across the culture; he

colonies of bacteria to be

Germs are spread by the contact method. One very com- 
mon method of spreading germs is by contact with sick persons
-P-A-G-E-237
HOW ARE GERMS SPREAD? 201 
or with objects touched by them. Thus, kissing sick per- 
sons is a dangerous practice; tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles 
and scarlet fever are but a few of many diseases spread by 
direct contact. The kinds of objects which may spread disease 
are so many that only a few will be named: the common drink- 
ing cup (Figure 179), handkerchiefs, bed-clothing, razors, eat- 
ing utensils, dental instruments, towels, toilet seats, bathtubs, 
pencils, candy, and fruit. 
Spitting should also be mentioned in this connection. A 
person who has tuberculosis, for example, may spit on the 
sidewalk or in the washbowl. 
Millions of dangerous germs 
may be present ‘in the sputum. 
Later this sputum may come 
in contact with shoes, clothing, 
or the hands, and find its way 
into the body of another person. 
This method of transferring 
disease by contact is made still 
more dangerous by the fact that Fig. 179. The Common Drink-

carriers.”” Thus a person may 
have completely recovered from diphtheria or typhoid fever, 
or he may never have come down with the disease at all, and 
yet have the germs in his body. He may spread the disease 
by handling foods or by any of the above-mentioned ways. 
It is a fact that a certain cook in New York City, called 
“Typhoid Mary,’ who was not sick herself, caused over 
twenty cases of typhoid before she was discovered. Then, 
after having agreed never to be a cook again, she did not 
keep her promise, and a few years later caused many more 
cases of typhoid in a hospital where she went to work. 
Coughing and sneezing spread germs. With each cough 
or sneeze numerous small invisible drops of water from the 
linings of the nose and mouth are thrown into the air, as shown   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-238
    202 PROTECTING OURSELVES FROM DISEASE 
in Figures 170 and 172. Even in speaking these droplets are 
thrown out. If a person is sick or is a germ carrier, there is 
great danger that germs will be carried on the droplets. 
You might think that all air is dangerous because it carries 
disease germs. This is not so, because the germs find it hard 
to live in dry air and sunshine. Fortunately for all of us 
most of the pathogenic germs are not so hardy as many other 
germs, and they are soon destroyed outside the body. Never- 
theless there is some danger in dusty air. Dust in the air and soil 
may, for example, carry the tetanus germ, which causes lockjaw. 
Food and water are germ spreaders. You recall (see page 102) 
that food furnishes germs a oo home. Milk, vegetables, and 
oysters may carry 
typhoid, cholera, 
and other disease 
germs in great num- 
bers if infected dur- 
ing handling. And 
remember that “‘hu- 
man disease car- 
riers” may handle 
the food. Uncovered 
food is particularly 
dangerous (Figure 
Fig. 180. The Filthy Fly and Its Filthy Foot 88, page 106). 
It isn’t the buzz of its wings or the tickling What has been 
effect of its feet that makes this criminal gaid about food ap-

to water, except that germs find it harder to live in water than 
in food. In fact, the number of germs in water decreases when 
the water is allowed to stand in open containers exposed to 
sunlight (see Figure 97, page 116). There is, however, always 
the danger of typhoid and cholera germs in water. 
Certain insects act as carriers of disease germs. Among 
the germ-carrying insects the principal ones are flies and 
mosquitoes. The ordinary housefly (Figure 180) is in many 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
HOW ARE GERMS SPREAD? 203 
places the most dangerous of all. Its feet, as shown in Figure 
180, are very hairy, and as it goes about to all kinds of filth, 
such as manure, garbage cans, toilets, and impure food, it 
picks up some of this filth. Later it walks on fruits and other 
uncovered foods or finds its way into our houses and to the 
table. As it walks it leaves 
behind bits of filth con- 
taining disease germs. 
Figure 181 shows what 
may be seen a few days 
after a fly is allowed to 
walk across some jello, 
which contains food for 
bacteria. Each spot shows 
that a bacterium has been 
left behind and has grown 
into a colony of thousands. 
Typhoid fever and small- 
pox are quite commonly 
carried by the fly. Coe y Fig. 181. The Fly’s Gift Of the other insect E f % X very time the fly walks on your 
carriers certain kinds of food it leaves filth behind. 
mosquitoes are the most 
dangerous, although the mosquito most common in our 
country is practically harmless. Malarial and yellow fever 
are spread by mosquitoes, each by a particular kind. The 
malarial germ, an animal parasite (Figure 174), is taken into 
the mosquito’s body when the mosquito bites a person who 
has the germs in his blood. Then later the mosquito bites 
another person and may pass the germ into that person’s 
body. Some diseases carried by other insects are: typhus 
fever by the body louse, relapsing fever by bedbugs, lice, and 
ticks, and sleeping sickness by the tsetse fly.

contain a word of praise—a tribute—to those noble men who

and the methods of spreading germs. One case will illustrate 
the spirit with which true scientists work. In 1900, four doc- 
tors were sent to Cuba to study the cause of yellow fever. 
  Fig. 182. Dr. J. W. Lazear 
In 1900, while investigat-

ease was under control. The disease had killed hundreds of 
Cubans every year and was attack- 
ing our soldiers. These men thought 
the disease might be due to certain 
mosquitoes. There was only one 
way to prove their idea and that 
was to allow themselves to be bitten 
by the mosquitoes. Two of the 
brave doctors took the disease. One 
recovered after a severe illness, but 
the other sacrificed his life for the 
sake of his fellow men (Figure 182). 
The doctors having called for volun- 
teers to help them, two young men 
offered themselves. Both came down 
with the disease and later recovered, 
but one of Heh became physically 
disabled by the experiment. The 
result of the study was so satisfac- 
tory that within two years the dis-

this connection, “Would I be willing to do what these men 
did for the sake of other people?” The history of mankind 
shows many such sacrifices made for the benefit of us all.

  HOW THE BODY PROTECTS ITSELF 205 
PROBLEM 3: HOW DOES THE BODY PROTECT ITSELF 
AGAINST GERMS? 
The nose and eyes are the watchdogs of the lungs and 
mouth. The hairs in the nose and the moisture on the nasal 
passage stop dust from entering the throat and lungs. (See 
page 150.) In this way the delicate lung lining is protected, 
and the disease germs cannot easily find their way into the 
body. Moreover, the nose expels a liquid which washes out 
the dust and germs. More important than this, the nose and 
eyes watch over the mouth, detecting spoiled food by its un- 
natural odor and appearance. Thus the poisons and bacteria 
in decayed food, and germs, may be kept from the body. 
The skin is a sanitary cover of the body. The skin pro- 
tects the body from germs by keeping a sanitary cover over 
the easily infected interior parts. How important this is you 
may readily realize when you recall that the least cut or bruise 
of the skin may lead to a serious infec- 
tion. Also, you may know how very care- 
fully doctors cleanse their hands and 
instruments in water treated with germ- 
killing chemicals, germicides, before they 
cut or probe through the skin during an 
operation. 
The body contains an army of disease 
fighters. Inside the healthy body there is 
always ready an army to fight the patho-

Proper regard for the ones about us is one of the easiest 
and most successful ways to keep germs from spreading. 
Even before you come down with a communicable disease, 
you can know that you are becoming sick. Coughing or 
sneezing, sore throat, fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, 
breaking out with a rash, feeling tired and worthless, and 
having chills are some of the symptoms that you may be 
taking on or have taken a disease. In such cases it is your 
duty to stay in your room and call a doctor. To go out and 
be with other boys and girls is most unfair. 
Sick people should be kept away from others, and the great- 
est care in handling objects which they touch must be prac- 
ticed (Figure 184). It is wise for one who attends a sick person

to wear a slip-over gown which may be left in the sick-room. 
The hands should be carefully washed on leaving the room. 
Paper handkerchiefs and paper bags, which may later be burned, 
should be used as receptacles for 
discharges from the nose and 
mouth. Basins and other necessary 
metal or porcelain vessels should 
be kept clean and sanitary by 
washing in water containing germ-

Milk is one of the most dangerous carriers of disease.

The dial is on a thermometer which re-

milk goes to the bottling machine (Fig-

way into milk more com- 
monly from water used to 
wash or rinse the cans than 
from any other source. Men 
who handle the milk must 
not only be well, but they 
must also not be “human 
carriers” of disease. There 
is one instance on record 
where 400 cases of typhoid 
fever were caused by milk 
handled by a man who had 
not had the disease for over 
forty years. In another instance a milk-man who had sore 
throat caused over 200 cases of sore throat among his customers.
-P-A-G-E-247
  PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF DISEASE 211 
When milk is shipped into cities, it must be protected against 
bacteria (Figure 190). To kill any germs present, pasteuriza- 
tion is used (Figure 189). You remember this process from

milk are carefully examined. The pasteurization is also made 
to conform to certain require- 
ments. The process of heating 
milk to 144°F. for 30 minutes 
is the most satisfactory one. 
(See page 107.) This kills all

Bottles are not kept in the refrigerator, caps are removed

Protect yourself against other impure foods. Raw oysters 
are always a source of danger, for they may come from water 
which contains sewage or they may spoil through improper 
handling. One case on record shows that oysters from polluted 
water near Long Island, New York, were shipped to several 
cities and within a short time caused fifteen cases of typhoid 
fever and nearly a hundred cases of diarrhea. Nearly every 
one who attended a banquet in one of the towns where the 
oysters were served became ill. Such danger can be reduced 
to a great extent by keeping a careful check on the water 
from which oysters are taken. It is equally necessary that 
they be packed immediately, that they be kept covered and 
cold during shipping, and that they be served while they are 
fresh. 
Meats, fruits, and vegetables must all be considered as 
possible germ carriers. They may have been kept in unclean 
and uncovered places where germs could get on them. Then 
if they are not thoroughly cooked or washed, the germs may 
get into our bodies. Foods of all kinds should always be 
covered (see Figure 87, page 105). Perhaps the greatest 
danger lies in the preparation of food for the table by those 
who fail to keep their hands clean and by disease carriers. 
‘You have learned in the case of “Typhoid Mary” but one of 
many instances where these people spread disease and bring 
sorrow to others. Unfortunately “carriers” cannot always be 
detected. There should, however, be laws, as there are in 
some cities, which require that cooks and waiters in public 
eating places be regularly examined. And in the home every 
precaution should be taken by one who has had a communi- 
cable disease to protect members of his family and his guests 
from impure food. The best way to do this is to have regular 
physical examinations and to keep the hands especially clean 
when handling food.

A pure-water supply has reduced the death-rate from 78 per 100,000 
in 1892 to 3 per 100,000 in 1922. 
Prevent water-borne diseases. Practically every large city 
in the world finds it necessary to expend much money to keep 
its water supply from becoming polluted, and to purify it. 
Similarly, in the country every precaution against water- 
borne diseases should be practiced. There are many cases 
known where epidemics of typhoid fever have been caused 
by impure water. Figure 194 shows how the death-rate from 
water-borne disease can be reduced by providing a pure water 
supply. Figure 195 shows the effect on the typhoid death- 
rate of such sanitary methods as sewage disposal and pasteuriza- 
tion of milk.

Fight the filthy fly. Manure piles, garbage cans, open 
toilets, rubbish piles, and sewage are the joys of a fly’s life. 
In these the fly finds its appetizing food and a most desirable 
place to raise its young. Here the female fly may lay from 120 
to 150 eggs at a single time. Four or five such batches may be 
laid during a season. Under proper conditions of warmth 
and moisture each of these eggs grows into a larva, or small 
white worm, in less than a day; the larva, or maggot, becomes 
a pupa after about five days; the pupa in turn grows into a fly

Fig. 196. Four Stages in the Life of the Fly 
You see by examining the figure that a fly egg may develop into an 
adult fly in about 11 days. 
in five or six more days (Figure 196). Thus within a season a 
single fly may produce over 500 new flies, each of which 
endangers our lives. And as each female fly becomes two 
weeks old, she may lay eggs and so produce still more. Thus 
a single fly in April may multiply and bring into the world 
6,000,000,000,000 flies by September. 
It is clear that the most effective way to fight the fly is to 
prevent the fly from multiplying. Every one of the above- 
mentioned homes of the fly can be treated with chemicals 
which kill the fly eggs and which keep the fly from spending 
its time in such places. Thus, borax may be spread on manure, 
and lime or bleaching powder may be placed in garbage, 
open toilets, rubbish piles, and sewage. Garbage cans can be 
kept clean and covered, open toilets may be eliminated by 
building septic tanks, or they may be protected by screens,
-P-A-G-E-253
Pe eee ae PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF DISEASE 217 
rubbish piles can be burned or hauled away, and sewage can 
be mixed with water in septic tanks. (See page 133.) 
A second method of fighting the fly is to catch and kill the 
adult fly whenever possible. Sticky paper, poisons, fly traps, 
and fly swatters (Figure 197) 
are among the most effec- 
tive methods. You should 
bear in mind that for every 
adult female fly killed, you 
are really keeping millions 
of flies from coming into the 
world. This is especially 
true early in the spring. 
There is in these methods 
only one danger which you 
must remember, and that 
is the danger of some fly 
poisons to children and 
animals. 
The third method of 
guarding against the house 
fly is to keep it away from 
food materials and away 
from our bodies. How im- 
portant this is can be seen 
from the fact that an ex- 
amination of the feet of more than 100 flies showed that each 
fly carried over 1,000,000 germs. These germs may enter the 
body with the food we eat or when the fly comes in direct 
contact with the mouth or an open sore. Flies in the house 
are, of course, particularly dangerous when a member of 
the family has a communicable disease.

deaths in the world. In some tropical regions, such as India,

this figure. 
millions of people have died of malaria in a single year. In 
our southern states there were from two to three million cases 
a year before scientists learned what caused the disease. 
Yellow fever, spread by another kind of mosquito, has 
been until recent years very common in certain parts of Amer- 
ica. In New Orleans, for example, nearly 8000 people died in 
1853, and over 4000 in 1878. You probably recall from your 
geography how the United States Government succeeded in 
constructing the Panama Canal only because Colonel Gorgas 
of the Army Medical Department and his helpers went to 
the Canal Zone before the laborers arrived, and eliminated 
much of the danger from both yellow: and malarial fever 
(Figure 198). 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF DISEASE 219 
The principal methods by which the danger from all kinds 
of mosquitoes can be controlled may be considered under three 
heads: (a) preventing their growth, (b) killing the larvee and 
the pupe (Figure 
199), and (c) protect- 
ing ourselves against 
the full-grown mos- 
quito. The prevention 
of the growth of 
mosquitoes may be 
brought about by pro- 
tecting cisterns, cess- 
pools, rain barrels, 
sinks, and water pails 
by screens or covers, 
by draining and clear- 
ing swampy regions, 
by burying tin cans

ing the channels of

may be done by spreading oil on the water every few weeks in 
the spring (Figure 201) or by stocking any ponds with fish and 
frogs. The oil floats in a thin layer over the water. The larve 
and pupx, which must breathe, cannot get air because the oil 
fills their breathing tubes. Moreover, the adult mosquitoes 
cannot rest on the oily surface, and therefore cannot lay their 
eggs. Fish and frogs feed on the larve or wrigglers. The

PROBLEM 5: HOW CAN YOU HELP THE BODY PROTECT 
ITSELF AGAINST DISEASES? 
A good doctor helps the body protect itself. The greatest 
help in the treatment of the sick body comes through the . 
advice and care of a good doctor. Guarding the health of 
human beings is his business. He has studied the human 
machine, its workings and its ailments. The first suggestion 
in helping the body is, therefore, not to try to treat a disease 
yourself, nor to call on a ‘‘quack”’ or ‘‘fake”’ doctor, nor to use 
patent medicines and ‘‘dope’’ recommended by untrained per- 
sons (Figures 202 and 203). You will, if you are sensible, call 
a doctor whose training has been the best and whose character 
is known and recognized to be above criticism. And you should

call him early before any disease gets a firm hold on you.

examinations these trained experts may save you days of 
suffering. How the doctor determines what help the body needs 
in case of sickness and what medicine, if any, should be given, 
is too difficult for us to understand at this time. 
Immunity is aided by vaccines and antitoxins. Rest, good 
. air, exercise, proper diet, and medicines are not the only 
means of helping the body fight disease germs. There are 
two other important ways which may be used to assist the 
white corpuscles and the chemical substances within the body 
in their fight against germs. Thus, certain vaccines and antitoxic 
sera may be injected into the body to strengthen or reinforce 
the army of disease fighters and to make the body immune. 
The use of vaccines and their value may be illustrated in 
connection with smallpox. Dr. Edward Jenner, an English 
physician, in 1798 found that persons who were vaccinated
-P-A-G-E-259
  HELPING THE BODY FIGHT DISEASE 223 
did not take smallpox. He obtained the vaccine from the 
swellings on cows that had cowpox, a disease something like 
smallpox. All that was necessary was to place on scratches 
in the skin of persons some of the watery material, or lymph, 
from the swellings. As a result of his work and that of others 
the death-rate from smallpox has been greatly reduced, and the 
disease can be practically eliminated if people are regularly 
vaccinated. 
Today the vaccine is prepared in very pure form and so 
applied to the human body that there is little danger of infec- 
tion by other germs. The records of a certain city show 3811 
cases of smallpox over a certain period of years. One hundred 
seventy-one of these persons died, but among these there 
was not a single person who had been properly vaccinated. 
This is direct proof of the value of vaccination. Persons who 
are properly vaccinated develop a mild form of cowpox.. Dur- 
ing this mild disease the body manufactures ‘“anti-bodies”’ 
which overcome the disease and which remain for years to 
guard the body against attacks of smallpox. The average 
length of the immunity as a result of a vaccination is about 
seven years. 
Similar successful vaccination has been carried on against 
typhoid fever, para-typhoid fever, cholera, and rabies. When 
any of these vaccines is used, the body begins to manufacture 
the proper anti-bodies to fight the particular kind of germs. 
This method of producing immunity results in active immunity, 
for the body itself is active in making the anti-bodies. One 
illustration will show the great value of vaccination against 
typhoid fever. Among approximately 100,000 soldiers who 
took part in the Spanish-American War about 10,000 had 
serious cases of typhoid and 1500 died. In the World War 
all soldiers were vaccinated against typhoid and para-typhoid. 
Out of 4,000,000 soldiers there were only about 300 cases 
and 23 deaths. 
Antitoxins, given for diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), scarlet 
fever and certain other diseases, act in a different way from the
-P-A-G-E-260
    224 PROTECTING OURSELVES FROM DISEASE 
vaccines to produce immunity. The preparation of an anti- 
toxin is well illustrated by the method used in diphtheria. 
The diphtheria germs are grown in cultures in the laboratory. 
Here they produce their toxins. These toxins, without any live 
germs, are injected

antitoxin; the heavy line shows the death 
rate for places using antitoxin.   Some blood is then 
removed from the 
horse and from this the serum, or watery part of the blood, 
is taken. This serum, containing the antitoxin, is then injected 
into the body of one suffering from diphtheria. If this is done 
during the first day of attack by the diphtheria germs, the 
patient is well within a few days. If a patient waits two or 
three days before taking the antitoxic serum, he does not recover 
so quickly and certainly. And if he waits still longer, the 
serum does little good. This method of producing immunity 
results in passive immunity, because the anti-bodies are made 
outside the human body. Figure 204 shows how the death 
rate from diphtheria may be reduced by the use of antitoxin.

THE STORY OF UNIT VIII 
We shall never know how man first discovered that fire 
could be harnessed and made to work for him. His early 
acquaintance with fire may have come from a blazing forest 
set on fire by lightning; perhaps it came from a flaming vol- 
eano which lighted up the night and poured hot liquid rock 
and ashes down into the plains below. At first man probably 
regarded these happenings, or phenomena, of nature with awe 
or reverence; but soon his natural curiosity must have 
226
-P-A-G-E-263
  THE STORY OF UNIT VII 227 
triumphed over his fear. He found that fire could be used to 
cook his food, furnish light and heat for his shelter, and protect 
him from wild beasts. 
Many thousands of years have passed since primitive man 
first used fire for his simple needs, and with this passage of 
time, man’s knowledge of and 
dependence upon fire have great- 
ly increased. By its use he 
separates metals from their ores, 
he produces steam to run ma- 
chinery, and he makes the 
thousand-and-one articles which 
add to his comfort and effi- 
ciency. Can you picture what 
this world would be without fire? 
You have often heard how 
primitive peoples, like the Amer- 
ican Indians, obtained fire by 
rubbing together two sticks of 
dried wood (Figure 205). The 
friction of the rubbing surfaces Fig. 205. Obtaining Fire by 
caused enough heat to “set Friction 
fire’ to dry, decaying wood, The upright stick is rotated by 
leaves, or moss, which was placed the hands. The lower end of the 2 stick is pointed and fits into a 
around the rubbing surfaces. small hole in the lower block. 
One of the Boy Scout tests is 
to start a fire by this method. Try it, using hard wood for 
the upright stick and soft wood for the block. 
Our great-great-grandfathers made fire by striking together 
two materials such as steel and flint. When these materials 
are struck together, sparks are produced, and these are allowed 
to fall on easily kindled substances. The old flint-lock musket 
used this method of firing. The steel hammer struck against 
a piece of flint, sending a spark into the powder held in the 
priming cup just below the flint. This powder burned, carry- 
ing the fire through a small hole in the barrel of the gun, and

  228 NATURE AND CONTROL OF FIRE 
lighted the firing-charge of powder inside the barrel (Figure 206) . 
The modern friction gas-lighter and cigar-lighter (Figure 
207) operate in the same manner, a piece of flint being rubbed

When the trigger is pulled, the 
flint strikes the steel, and a spark 
is sent into the powder in priming 
cup. The fire gets to the charge in 
the barrel through a small hole. by a circular piece of steel. 
It was not until 1827 that 
the first match which could be 
lighted by rubbing the tip was 
invented. This was made pos- 
sible by discoveries of chem- 
ists, who learned more about 
the nature of fire. Thus the 
uncertain methods of rubbing 
sticks together and striking 
sparks have given way to the 
  match, which can be kindled 
at any time, at any place, and with very little effort. 
If you look around you, you see many materials which 
cannot be used for a fire, such as stone, 
soil, glass, brick, and water. Many other 
materials, such as paper, wood, cloth, bark, 
and coal, burn readily. Materials which will 
not burn are said to be incombustible, 
while materials which burn are known as 
combustible. The first requirement for a 
fire is a combustible material. 
Not all materials which burn are fuels. 
A combustible material is called a fuel if 
it has three characteristics: (1) it must

good fuel. Let us consider some materials, and see if they 
meet these requirements. 
We see at once that wood, coal, gas, and gasoline meet all 
of the requirements. A material like iron will burn in oxygen, 
but not in ordinary air. It cannot be classed as a fuel. Paper 
meets the first requirement, but does not give enough heat 
for the usual uses of fuels in stoves or furnaces. Many of our 
hard woods, such as oak, walnut, and 
mahogany, meet the first two require- 
ments, but their use for furniture and 
lumber makes them too expensive to 
be classed as important fuels. What is 
a good fuel at one time may not, be- 
cause of the discovery of new fuels or 
because it becomes searce, be a good ple 20 fon 
fuel at a later time. 
Though a fuel or combustible material is necessary for a fire, 
there are also other requirements. 
It is not always easy to start a fire in the woods or in a 
stove, even if you have good fire materials. Boy Scouts, Girl 
Scouts, and Camp Fire Girls know that the real trick of build- 
ing a fire is in arranging the wood or other fire materials. If 
the sticks are stacked around the center like the poles of an 
Indian wigwam (Figure 208) and the fire is started on the 
side from which the wind comes, a good blaze always results. 
The spaces between the sticks allow the air to come in and 
circulate through the wood. Without air the fire “goes out.” 
The second requirement for a fire is, therefore, a continuous 
supply of air. 
When you start a fire, you bring a lighted match to the 
paper or leaves. Why do the paper or leaves ‘catch on fire’’? 
The burning match gives off heat. This heat raises the temper- 
ature of the paper. The paper finally reaches a certain temper- 
ature at which it bursts into flame. This is called the burning 
temperature of the paper. Some materials, like coal and hard 
wood, have high burning temperatures; that is, they must 
      
  
  
-P-A-G-E-266
  230 NATURE AND CONTROL OF FIRE 
be heated to a high temperature before they will burst into 
flame. Other materials, like paper and corn-cobs, have low 
burning temperatures. The third requirement is that the 
material be heated to its 
burning temperature. 
A fire has two outstand- 
ing characteristics: first, 
it always produces heat and 
light, and second, the ma- 
terial which burns changes 
to new materials and gradu- 
ally disappears. In order 
to understand the nature 
of fire we must find out 
the causes which are re- 
sponsible for these charac- 
: — teristics. For it is only 
Fig. 209. How a Fire Gets Air through understanding that 
we can learn to control and use this wonderful gift of nature.     PROBLEM 1: HOW DOES A FIRE GET AIR? 
Convection currents supply a fire with air. When a ma- 
terial burns, fresh air must be constantly supplied. How does 
the fire do this? 
Experiment 50: How does fresh air reach the 
flame? 
(a) Place three or four matches at the 
side of a candle, as shown in Figure 209. 
Light the candle, place the chimney over it, 
and cover the top of the chimney. In a 
short time the candle goes out. Why? 
(b) Repeat (a), but do not cover the top 
of the chimney. Why does the candle con- 
tinue to burn?

glass front. One hole is cut in the top of the box and another 
in the side near the bottom. A lamp chimney is placed over the 
hole in the top, and a burning candle is placed inside of the box 
directly under the hole. Hold a piece of 
smoking punk-stick or paper over the 
chimney which stands above the candle. 
Does the smoke move up or down? Now 
move the smoking paper or stick to the 
hole at the side of the box. What happens? 
This movement of the air caused by differ- 
ences in temperature is called a convection 
current. Why does a difference in tem- 
perature cause a convection current? (See 
page 57.) 
Exercise 1. Make a drawing of the 
apparatus, and show by small arrows the 
direction of the air currents through it.

“How does the 
fire provide its own supply of fresh air?” 
  Fig. 211. Sectional View

  The air supply of stoves and furnaces 
Chimney Showing must be regulated. Stoves and furnaces 
Damper Closed have two devices for regulating the 
amount of air which passes through them. 
Near the bottom of the stove are air 
openings called drafts (Figure 212). The 
size of the openings is regulated by a slid- 
ing cover (Figure 212).. The draft regu- 
lates the amount of air which comes into 
the stove. A stove-pipe usually carries 
to the chimney the gases formed in burn- 
Fig. oar Draftsand ing. In this pipe a damper is placed (Fig- 
SNe ure 211). The damper is a circular piece of 
metal which just fits inside the stove-pipe. It is shown closed in 
Figure 212, and open in Figure 211. When it is open, the gases   
 
-P-A-G-E-268
    232 NATURE AND CONTROL OF FIRE 
and smoke may pass out of the chimney; when partially closed, it 
prevents the hot gases from escaping up the chimney too rapidly, 
and thus more heat is given to the room. By adjusting the 
draft and damper, any desired amount of air can be obtained. 
Exercise 2. How would 
you arrange the drafts and 
damper on a stove when 
you start the fire? What 
change would you make 
after the fire is well started? 
When you want less heat? 
The kerosene stove au- 
tomatically supplies its 
air. The. main parts of 
the kerosene cook-stove 
are the feed-reservoir, feed- 
pipe, burner, wick, and 
chimney (Figures 213 and 
214). The reservoir is usu- 
ally made of glass so that 
the oil level may always be seen. The oil flows by gravity 
through the feed-pipe and supplies the different burners. The 
burner holds the wick in place and is hollow in the center 
so that air may enter. Air may also enter around the burner 
on the outside of the wick. At the top of the burner is the 
flame-spreader, which throws the flame outward. The chimney 
is placed over the burner, and above the chimney is the grate. 
Except for the flame-spreader, the construction of the kerosene 
stove is but little different from that of the kerosene lamp. 
To put the stove in operation, the reservoir is filled with 
a good grade of kerosene oil. The kerosene flows by gravity 
through the feed-pipe and is absorbed by the wick, through 
which it rises. The flame-spreader is then lifted up and the 
wick is lighted. When the flame encircles the entire wick, 
the flame-spreader is lowered and the height of the wick is     Courtesy Cleveland Metal Products Co.

In the laboratory the Bunsen burner (Figure 
215), which uses natural or artificial gas for fuel,

  Experiment 51: How is the Bunsen burner constructed and 
how does it operate? 
(a) Unscrew the barrel from the base of the burner and remove 
the collar from the barrel. Observe the small hole in the delivery 
tube. Attach the delivery tube to a gas-jet, turn on the gas, and 
light it. Describe the flame produced. 
 
-P-A-G-E-270

(b) Turn off the gas and replace the barrel and collar. Turn 
the collar so that the holes are closed. Light the gas. Describe 
the flame produced. Turn the collar so that the holes are open. 
What effect does this extra supply of air have on the size and color 
of the flame? 
(c) Which is the hotter flame, the yellow or the blue? Obtain 
two beakers or tin cups of the same size. Pour just two inches of 
water in each beaker. Take the temperature of the water. Heat the 
water with the yel- 
low flame for three 
minutes and record 
the temperature. 
Without changing 
the amount of gas, 
turn the collar so 
that the holes are

(d) Where is the hottest part of the blue flame? Hold a wire 
gauze horizontally at the highest point of the flame, then lower 
it until it is just above the inner blue cone, and finally hold it 
just above the barrel of the burner. In which part of the flame 
would you place a material to heat it in the least time to the highest 
temperature? 
(e) Why is the blue flame hotter than the yellow flame? Hold 
a white dish in the yellow flame. Note that a black substance, 
carbon, collects on the dish. Repeat, holding a clean white dish 
in the blue flame. Is carbon given off by the blue flame? In 
which flame is the greater amount of burning taking place? Why? 
Recalling that the blue flame is smaller than the yellow flame 
when the supply of gas is the same, you can now give two reasons 
why the blue flame is hotter than the yellow. What are they? 
Exercise 4. Write a report on Experiment 51, including answers 
to all questions.

WHAT FIRE TAKES FROM AIR 235 
The kitchen gas-stove burner (Figure 216) is similar in con- 
struction and operation to the Bunsen burner. Examine your 
gas burner at home and locate the gas line, or delivery tube, air 
regulator, and mixing chamber. Turn on the gas and light it. 
Are the small flames blue or yellow? If the tips of the flame 
are slightly yellow, the flames smoke. In adjusting the air 
supply, the holes are usually opened until the flame “strikes 
back,” or explodes, when it is lighted. The holes are then 
closed slightly until no explosion takes place when the gas is 
lighted. This produces a mixture which secures the greatest 
quantity of heat from the smallest amount of gas. 
Exercise 5. What is the difference in the operation and construc- 
tion of a Bunsen burner and the kitchen gas stove? 
PROBLEM 2: WHAT DOES A FIRE TAKE OUT OF THE AIR? 
A fire uses but part of the air. Until 1777 it was thought 
that all of the air was necessary for burning. Previous to 
that time a gas had been discovered in which materials burned 
very brightly, but the experimenter did not know that this 
same gas was present in air and caused burning. You can 
readily prepare this gas in the laboratory. 
Experiment 52: How can the gas which causes 
burning be prepared? 
(a) Place enough red rust of mercury in a test 
tube to make a layer about one-eighth inch deep 
in the bottom of the tube. Heat the bottom of 
the tube, holding it in an inclined position (Figure 
217) and rotating it slowly to heat it evenly on 
all sides. From time to time thrust a glowing 
splinter of wood into the tube. What happens? 
How do you account for this? 
  Fig. 217. : : ‘ Apparatus f (6) Continue heating the tube until the red opentasaves 
powder has completely disappeared. Remove the 
tube from the flame, and, holding the mouth downward, tap it

236 NATURE AND CONTROL OF FIRE 
Lavoisier, one of the first great chemists, proved that this 
gas was the true cause of burning. By a series of experiments 
he showed that metals take this gas out of the air when 
they rust and that fuels will not burn in air from which this 
gas is removed. But if a rust, such as red rust of mercury, 
is heated and the gas passed back into this air, materials 
will again burn in it. In this way he demonstrated that the 
burning of fuels and the rusting of metals are caused by the 
same kind of gas. He called this gas oxygen. 
How much of the air is oxygen? This question may be 
answered by experiment. Iron rusts when it is placed in air. 
When it rusts it takes up oxygen. You may take advantage 
of this characteristic of iron to find what part of the air is 
oxygen. 
  Experiment 53: What is the percentage of oxygen in the air? 
(a) Fill a test tube with water and then pour out the water. 
This leaves the inside wall of the test tube moist. Sprinkle a 
pinch of iron filings or iron powder into the tube so that the 
filings are scattered over the inside wall. Invert 
the tube into a glass of water, and allow it 
to stand until the next day (Figure 218). 
What happens? How do you account for this? 
(See Experiment 22, page 122.) 
(b) Hold the tube so that the water: levels 
inside the tube and in the glass are the same. 
Place your finger or thumb over the mouth of 
the test tube, remove the tube from the glass, 
and turn it mouth upward. The water flows to

Apparatus for lighted match into the tube. What happens? 
Experiment 53 Why? Does this prove the conclusion you 
reached in part (a)? Why? 
(c) Measure the entire length of the tube, and then divide the 
length of the water column in the tube by the length of the tube. 
The result you obtain will be the percentage of oxygen present in the 
air. Why? 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  WHAT IS FLAME? 237 
Careful experiments have shown that approximately 21 per cent 
of the air is oxygen. Compare the results which you obtained with 
the actual percentage of oxygen in air. How do you account for the 
difference? (See Table VI, page 150.) 
Exercise 6. Why must fire have a constant supply of fresh air? 
Exercise 7. Why do materials burn more brightly in pure oxygen 
than in ordinary air? 
PROBLEM 3: WHAT IS FLAME? 
A burning piece of wood is hot. Before it is lighted, it is 
at the same temperature as the air around it. What is the 
source of the heat? In order to answer this question you 
must first consider some of the methods of producing heat. 
If you rub a coin on your sleeve a few minutes, it gets hot. 
The longer you rub, the hotter it gets. Like the wood before 
burning, the coin is cold before it is rubbed. In the rubbing 
of the coin, the energy of your muscles is transferred to the 
coin in the form of heat. Heat is simply another form of 
energy. Electricity is also a form of energy. When elec- 
tricity is passed through the wires of an electric toaster, the 
electrical energy is changed into heat energy. One form of 
energy can thus be changed into another form of energy. 
Exercise 8. Make a list of as many energy changes as you can. 
For example, electrical energy changes to light and heat energy in 
the electric lamp. 
If you pour a few drops of glycerine on a small pile of pow- 
dered potassium permanganate, the mixture will burst into 
flame and produce both heat and light. The potassium 
permanganate and glycerine possess energy which is changed 
into heat energy whenever they come in contact. The energy 
which they possess is called chemical energy. All materials 
contain chemical energy. Under certain conditions this 
energy can be changed into heat energy. This is what takes 
place when a material burns. The chemical energy of the ma- 
terials entering into the burning is changed into heat energy.
-P-A-G-E-274
  238 NATURE AND CONTROL OF FIRE 
When things burn they also produce another kind of energy 
which we call light, and we say that the materials burn with 
a flame. Perhaps the simplest way to understand how the 
flame is produced is to study a burning candle. 
Experiment 54: Where does the burning 
take place in a candle flame? 
Hold a match stick horizontally 
across the flame of a candle (Figure 
219) just above the wick, until it starts 
to burn. Remove it quickly from the 
flame and extinguish it. Examine 
the stick. Does the burning take 
place inside of the flame or on the 
outside of the flame? 
    Fig. 219. Apparatus for be 
Experiment 54 When a candle burns, it be- 
comes shorter and shorter. The 
wax of which the candle is composed melts. The liquid 
which is formed may be seen in the cup-shaped cavity at the 
top of the candle around the base of the wick. 
Experiment 55: How does the wax get to the part of the flame 
where the burning takes place? 
(a) Light a candle, and when it is burning well, rapidly lower 
a piece of white paper, held in a horizontal position, downward 
until it just touches the wick, and then remove it quickly. Examine 
the piece of.paper at the point where it touches the wick. What 
do you see? Account for the result. 
(b) Obtain a glass tube about six or seven inches long and 
about three-eighths inch in diameter, drawn to a small opening 
at one end. The opening should have a diameter about one-half 
as great as the diameter of the tube. Warm the tube, and then 
hold it in the candle flame, as shown in Figure 220. Light the 
gas which comes out of the end of the tube. This gas is unburned 
wax gas. It is formed at the wick because of the heat of the flame 
which turns the liquid to a gas. When it reaches the outer part 
of the flame, it combines with oxygen and burns.

Exercise 9. On the basis of Experiments 54 and 55 and what 
you know about the nature of burning, write a scientific explanation 
in answer to the following question: ‘How does a candle burn?” 
  
You know now how a candle 
burns, but you do not know why 
it burns with a visible flame. 
Experiment 56: Why does a candle 
burn with a visible flame? 
(a) Hold a white porcelain dish in 
a candle flame for a minute. Remove 
the dish and examine the part which 
was in the flame. What do you ob- 
serve? This material is carbon. How 
would you describe carbon? : ae

close the holes by turning the collar pasar Se 
at the bottom. Repeat (a). Do you get the same result? 
(c) Light a Bunsen burner and open the holes. How does the 
flame compare with the flame obtained when the holes are closed? 
Repeat (a). Do you get the same result? Obtain a match which 
is thoroughly charred, and powder it. Introduce some of this black 
powder into the holes of the Bunsen burner. What effect does 
this have on the color of the flame? Note that when the particles 
are heated, they glow and color the flame. Scrape some of the 
carbon off the white dish and introduce it into the holes of a Bunsen 
burner. Do you get the same results as with the charred match?           
Exercise 10. Explain how the last experiment proves that the color 
of the flame is due to glowing carbon particles. 
All materials which burn with a flame change to a gas 
before they combine with oxygen. When the oxygen combines 
with the gas, great heat is produced. This heat raises the 
temperature of any solid particles which may be in the gas 
until they glow, thus giving a color to the flame. In case 
there are no solid particles in the flame, the flame has no 
color; it is a non-luminous flame. All our common fuels burn 
with a visible flame caused by the glowing carbon particles.

PROBLEM 4: WHAT BECOMES OF MATERIALS WHEN 
THEY BURN? 
‘You know that fuels decrease in size when they burn (Figures 
221 and 222). A candle gets shorter and shorter until finally 
only a very small part of it remains. Experiments have 
shown you that part of the candle goes into the air in the form 
of tiny black particles of carbon. This, however, does not 
account for the entire candle.

Fig. 221. A Famous Hotel Before Destruction by Fire 
Most candles are made of a white solid called paraffin. 
It is composed of two substances: one of these is carbon, and 
the other is a colorless gas called hydrogen. It is hard to 
realize that a white solid could be made of a black solid and 
a colorless gas, yet this is true. You have seen in an earlier 
experiment that red rust of mercury consists of oxygen, a 
colorless gas, and mercury, a heavy silvery liquid. Both 
paraffin and red rust of mercury are compounds; that is, they 
are composed of more than one simple material. Oxygen, 
hydrogen, carbon, and mercury cannot be divided into simpler 
materials. They are therefore called elements. (See page 90.) 
Experiment 57: How does mixing two materials together differ 
from combining two materials? 
(a) Mix together equal parts by volume of sulphur and iron 
powder. Use enough of each so that you will have about one- 
half test tube of the mixture.
-P-A-G-E-277
  PRODUCTS OF BURNING 241 
(b) Examine the mixture of sulphur and iron. Can you dis- 
tinguish one from the other? Pour about one-fourth test tube of 
the mixture into water and shake thoroughly. Allow the mixture to 
stand for a few minutes. Are the materials now separated? Why? 
(c) Place about one-half inch of the mixture of iron and sulphur 
which you made in (a) in a test tube. Heat the test tube in a 
flame until a red glow spreads throughout the mixture, and then 
remove the tube from the flame. Allow the contents of the test

tube to cool, and then break the test tube so as to secure the 
material. Crush the material. Examine it carefully. Can you 
distinguish between the iron and the sulphur? Pour the ma- 
terial in a test tube of water, shake it, and allow it to stand 
a few minutes. Compare your results with those obtained in (0). 
You see from this experiment that when two materials are 
simply mixed together they do not change chemically. When 
two materials combine, as the iron and sulphur do when 
heated, a new material is formed which does not possess the 
same properties as the original materials. 
Now that you know paraffin is a compound of carbon and 
hydrogen, you can determine by experiment what becomes 
of it when it burns.

  242 NATURE AND CONTROL OF FIRE 
Experiment 58: What becomes of a candle when it burns? 
(a) Light a small candle and place a clean dry beaker mouth 
downward over the flame for a few seconds. Notice the film which 
covers the inside wall. This film is water. Another name for 
water is hydrogen oxide. It is formed by the 
combination of hydrogen and oxygen. 
(6) Light a candle and lower it into a clean 
bottle or jar. Cover the jar (Figure 223). When 
the flame “goes out,” remove the candle and 
pour enough limewater into the jar to make a 
layer about one-half inch deep. Cover the jar 
quickly with a glass plate and shake the contents. 
Observe that the limewater turns milky. Chem- 
ists have found that limewater turns milky only 
when a gas called carbon dioxide is present. 
  Fig. 223 
Apparatus for asc 
Experiment 58 The carbon dioxide is produced by the combina- 
tion of carbon and oxygen. 
The preceding experiment shows you that carbon dioxide 
and water are formed when a candle burns. Both of these 
materials are compounds, and when in the form of gases 
are colorless. To form them the oxygen must have combined 
with the elements in the paraffin. You can say, therefore, 
that when a material burns it combines with oxygen. 
Our common fuels, such as wood, coal, gas, and petroleum, 
contain carbon and hydrogen; like the candle they also com- 
bine with oxygen and form carbon dioxide and water. If 
the temperature of the flame is hot enough to keep them at 
their burning temperature and there is plenty of oxygen, 
these fuels will disappear in the same manner as the candle. 
Of course, in wood and coal there are minerals which will not 
burn; these are left as ashes. (See page 88.) When large 
amounts of fuel are thrown on a fire, the fire generally smokes, 
because there is not sufficient heat to raise the fuel to the 
burning temperature nor enough oxygen to burn it. -

  OUR COMMON FUELS 243 
PROBLEM 5: WHAT ARE OUR COMMON FUELS? 
Our modern life is dependent to a great extent upon fuels. 
Without fuels, fire could not serve its purposes and life would 
be very primitive indeed. The wonderful progress which 
man has made in recent centuries depends to a great extent 
upon the principal uses to which fuel is put, namely, light, 
heat, and power. 
The enormous quantity of the most important fuels used 
in the United States is almost unbelievable. Table VII shows 
the annual amounts used during recent years.

*Not cll used for fuel.   
Wood is still an important fuel. Wood was in many places 
probably the first fuel. It was easily obtained and the 
supply was plentiful. The early pioneers in the United States 
were wholly dependent upon it. But as the population 
increased, more land was needed for farming and more tim- 
ber for building. The land was cleared to make way for 
fields of grain and other food-producing plants. Timber was 
necessary to supply man’s wants, that is, to build him a shelter, 
to keep him warm, to make furniture, and to furnish him 
with the tools and conveniences which made possible a more 
comfortable and more efficient life. So the forests gradually 
disappeared. 
As wood became less plentiful, it became more expensive. 
It had to be shipped greater distances, and the cost of ship- 
ping was added to the cost of cutting. These additional 
costs made it more expensive than coal, especially in cities
-P-A-G-E-280
  244 NATURE AND CONTROL OF FIRE 
where enormous amounts of fuel were used. The coal could 
not only be produced and shipped more cheaply, but it required 
less space for storage. You see the truth of this statement 
when you realize that a wagon-load of coal gives about three 
to four times as much heat as a wagon-load of wood, or that 
a pound of coal gives as much heat as two pounds of wood.

Coal is our most important fuel. The two principal kinds 
of coal are hard, or anthracite, and soft, or bituminous (Figures 
224 and 225). In the mining of coal, shafts are sunk into the 
ground and tunnels, or galleries, run off from them at different 
levels. The coal occurs in horizontal layers (Figure 226). 
The composition of coal is the real basis upon which coals 
are classified by scientists, because it is the composition which 
will determine the properties and uses of the coal. Table VII 
shows the composition of these two kinds of coals. Note the 
large amounts of fixed carbon in the anthracite and the high 
percentage of volatile matter in the bituminous. “Volatile” 
refers to the part which escapes as a gas when the coal is 
heated; “fixed carbon” refers to the carbon that is left after 
the gases are driven off.

These men are using an electrically operated device for cutting channels 
into the coal so that it may be more easily loosened and broken up. 
Anthracite coal is frequently used in heating houses, be- 
cause it is a clean fuel. It contains so little volatile matter 
that it burns with practically no smoke. Since it burns slowly, 
stoves or furnaces need to be filled but once or twice a day. 
Bituminous coal is by far the more important kind. Manu- 
facturing plants and locomotives use enormous quantities of 
it for generating steam power, and many buildings are heated 
with it. Since the coal contains so much volatile matter,

Note the small anthracite field. There are a few minor deposits of 
hard coal in other sections of the United States.   
Exercise 13. The principal coal fields of the United States are 
shown in the map (Figure 227). From this map make a list 
showing the different states which produce

Gas is manufactured from coal. Soft 
coal is also employed in the making of coal 
gas, which is used in many cities for fuel. 
Experiment 59: How can you make gas 
from soft coal? 
Set up an apparatus as in Figure 228. 
Remove the stopper from the test tube and 
place in the tube a number of small pieces 
of soft coal. Replace the stopper and heat 
the tube by moving a flame back and forth 
under it. Observe what happens. When smoke comes from the 
small opening at the end of the delivery tube, bring a flame to this 
opening. What happens? Heat the test tube until no more gas is

contents. This is coke. Also note the brown liquid on the sides of 
the tube. This liquid is coal tar. 
In the commercial manufacture of coal gas, the coal is 
heated in iron retorts (Figure 229). The gas which is driven 
off from the coal contains coal gas, coal-tar gas, and ammonia

gas. These gases pass upward to the hydraulic main, which is 
a long horizontal pipe containing water. Part of the ammonia 
gas is absorbed here. In the condenser the coal tar is con- 
densed and collects in the tar well. In the scrubber the rest 
of the ammonia gas is absorbed by the spray of water. The 
purifier contains various chemicals which combine with any 
sulphur compounds contained in the gas. The gas collects 
in the gas holder, from which it is distributed to the consumer. 
Exercise 14. How does the gas you prepared in Experiment 59 
differ from commercial coal gas? 
Gas is sold at a certain rate per 100 cu. ft. The cost varies 
in different places and at different times. Large manufactur- 
ing plants which consume enormous amounts of gas obtain 
their supply at a lower rate than do private consumers of small 
quantities. The gas meter measures the volume of gas burned, 
and our gas bills vary with the quantity used. The meter

indicates exactly the number of cubic feet of gas which pass 
through it. The operation of the meter is rather complex

  The use of oil for fuel is increasing. In recent years the 
use of oil, or petroleum, for fuel has increased tremendously. 
A large number of 
ships are now burn- 
ing oil instead of 
coal, because it has 
been shown that for 
their use, oil is 
cheaper, cleaner, 
and produces less 
smoke than coal.

also rapidly gain- 
ing a hold. Oil is slightly more expensive than coal for 
this purpose, but oil furnaces are much more easily regu- 
lated than coal furnaces and require much less attention. 
The petroleum, called crude oil, is obtained from the ground 
by drilling holes through the soil and rock into the oil-bearing 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  OUR COMMON FUELS 249 
layers (Figure 232). The rocks in which the oil is found are 
called pay-sands. The crude petroleum which comes from 
the wells is a black oily liquid. It contains gasoline, fuel oil, 
kerosene, lubricating oil, para- 
ffin, and several other ingredients. 
Each of the liquids present in 
the crude oil has its own boiling 
point, and therefore each of the 
ingredients can be separated from 
the others. The oil is put ina 
large retort and heated for several 
hours to the boiling point of the 
most volatile liquid. The gas 
which comes off is led through a 
pipe cooled by water flowing 
over the pipe. The gas con- 
denses, and the liquid flows from 
the pipe to be collected in tanks. 
Then the temperature is raised 
to the. boiling point of the next 
most volatile liquid, until it has 
changed to a gas, and go on 
until the gases:cease to be formed. 
This process is called fractional 
distillation. The remaining ma- 
terial, a black tarry liquid, is 
cooled suddenly, and flakes of 
paraffin appear in it. This mix- 
ture is then poured through a

cloth. This holds the paraffin, which is later purified. 
Exercise 16. What is the difference between the distillation of 
water and the distillation of petroleum? (See page 138.) 
Natural gas is used in many regions. Natural gas is 
obtained in much the same way as oil. When the drill-pipe 
reaches the gas layer, the gas, being greatly compressed by 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
    250 NATURE AND CONTROL OF FIRE 
the layer of rock above, rushes out of the pipe with great 
force until the well is exhausted. Pipes carry the gas to stor- 
age tanks near the well or in neighboring cities. 
Conservation of fuels is necessary. The amount of fuel 
used in the world is so great that we may soon be faced with 
a fuel shortage. For this reason we must conserve our fuels. 
There are: several ways in which this may be done. One 
way is to eliminate waste in handling and storing. Enor- 
  
      
"Keystone View Co. 
Fig. 233. A Burning Oil Well 
Millions of dollars’ worth of oil are destroyed every year by fire. 
mous quantities of coal and wood are left on the ground and 
are never recovered. It is a common practice in boring for 
oil to “blow off” the gas which accompanies the oil in order 
to get the more valuable product. Great quantities of oil 
are lost because of fire and careless handling at the wells 
(Figure 233). Proper care of fuels will prevent great waste. 
A common method of wasting fuel is burning without the 
correct amount of air. Nearly one-third of the heat value of 
the coal used in our country passes up the chimney. This
-P-A-G-E-287
  PREVENTING DESTRUCTIVE FIRES 251 
loss can be eliminated by the’ proper control of the drafts 
and by proper feeding of the fuel. New inventions on stoves, 
furnaces, and heating.devices of all,kinds are needed as aids 
in the saying of fuel... Thus, by means:of making-our heating 
devices more efficient.we have another way by which we may 
conserye;fuel. : 
The development of water power: is one hope for the solu- 
tion ‘ofthe fuel problem.’ Very little of: the water power avail- 
able in this country is utilized. Water powér may be used 
to generate electricity, which can be ‘transported long dis- 
tances to run our machinery and furnish us with light and 
heat. If all this available power were used, it would result 
in a great saving of coal. 
What the future has in store for us in the way of new fuels 
cannot be predicted. Fuels having as their sources some 
new materials may be developed. There will always be a 
demand for fuel, and if new materials are found, they in turn 
will some day be exhausted, and new sources must again be 
found. 
Exercise 17. Make a summary of the principal ways by which 
our present supply of fuels may be conserved. 
Exercise 18. List the ways in which you can help save fuel. 
PROBLEM 6: HOW CAN DESTRUCTIVE FIRES BE 
PREVENTED? 
“Fire is a good servant but a bad master.’ When properly 
controlled, fire serves us in many important ways. Once 
beyond control, it is very dangerous and destructive. You 
have only to consider the great losses due to fire to appre- 
ciate the truth of this statement. In the United States alone 
the losses caused by fire amount to nearly one-half billion 
dollars every year. This loss would build 50,000 houses at 
10,000 dollars each. Add to these material losses the suffering 
of the injured and homeless and the lives lost, and you are 
impressed with the great necessity for better methods of fire

control (Figure 234). A great fire-extinguisher company states 
this loss in the following words: 
All of the buildings burned in the United States in a single year, 
if placed on one side of the street, would make a dreadful avenue 
of desolation reaching from Chicago to New York City, the mile- 
stones of which would be the charred bodies of human victims 
of fire. 
When one realizes that the majority of destructive fires are 
preventable, this tremendous loss of property and human lives 
is even more terrible. The development of new fireproof build- 
ing materials and increased care in the construction of buildings 
have done much towards preventing the rapid spread of fire, 
but the real prevention of fire is in the hands of the individual. 
If every person would make a continuous effort to take the 
proper precautions when using fire materials, this great loss 
would be nearly eliminated. 
The causes of these destructive fires may be classified under 
three heads. Table IX shows these three classes, and under 
each suggests several causes which belong to that class.

PROBLEM 7: HOW ARE FIRES “PUT OUT”? 
To prevent a fire is less difficult than to put it out. How- 
ever, the fire can be extinguished easily while it is small. You 
have only to keep in mind the requirements of a fire. Every 
method of extinguishing fire does one or 
both of these things: (1) it cuts off the 
supply of air, or (2) it cools the fuel below 
its burning temperature. 
When water is thrown on a fire, it cuts 
off the supply of air by covering the fuel 
with water and with the steam which is 
formed. The water also cools the fuel below 
the burning temperature. For extinguish- 
ing small fires but little water is necessary, 
since the amount of heat given off by the 
fire is not great. In large fires there is so 
much heat that it is sometimes 
difficult to cool the fire. More- 
over, the water cannot easily 
reach all parts of the burning 
materials even when thrown by 
the fire engines. Water is the 
most important fire extinguisher

      Carbon-dioxide extinguishers 
may be used for some fires. You recall that carbon

air. Figures 235 and 236 show a carbon-dioxide ex- oer 
tinguisher. Note the small bottle of sulphuric acid which is 
attached at the top, the solution of baking-soda in the tank, 
and the position of the tube.
-P-A-G-E-291
HOW FIRES ARE “PUT OUT” 255 
Experiment 60: How is a carbon-dioxide fire extinguisher 
made and used? 
(a) Dissolve a few spoonfuls of baking-soda (sodium bicarbon- 
ate) in about a half-pint of water. Place the solution in a glass 
or beaker and then add to it a few drops of concentrated sulphuric 
acid. The gas given off is carbon dioxide. 
(6) Set up a small demonstration fire ex- 
tinguisher like that shown in Figure 237. The 
solution of soda is made in the way described 
above. This should fill the bottle about two- 
thirds full. Place sulphuric acid in the small 
vial to a depth of one inch. Insert the stopper 
tightly by a twisting motion. Now invert the 
bottle quickly, emptying the acid into the soda ncaa 
solution, direct the stream of liquid into a pail on Kees) 
the floor, and bring it to an upright position. 
Be careful that the stream of liquid does not Fig. 237. Demon-

(c) Refill the extinguisher and test it on a small paper fire out- 
of-doors.           SULPHURIC. ‘ACID 
In some commercial extinguishers the bottle is placed in 
such a position that, when the tank is inverted, the acid will 
flow out. In others the cover is fitted with a screw-plunger 
which, when screwed down, breaks the bottle and allows the 
acid to mix with the soda solution. The carbon dioxide col- 
lects above the water in the tank. Soon the pressure of the 
gas is great enough to force the water out of the tube. If the 
gas is made very rapidly, the water spurts from the tube 
and can be thrown on a fire at some distance. The water 
lowers the temperature of the fire and cuts off the supply of 
oxygen. The carbon dioxide also helps to cut off the oxygen 
supply, because it is about one and one-half times as heavy as 
air. In a closed room where there are no currents of air, 
the carbon dioxide may be of considerable value. In open 
places the carbon dioxide might be carried away by wind, 
but the water would put out a small fire.
-P-A-G-E-292
    
256 NATURE AND CONTROL OF FIRE 
Exercise 20. Is the carbon dioxide or the water more important 
in the commercial fire extinguisher? Why do you think so? 
Carbon-tetrachloride extinguishers are very practical (Figure 
238). 
Liquid 
Pu mp 
Tube 
Piston 
    Fig. 238. Construction of Car- 
bon-Tetrachloride Fire 
Extinguisher 
When the piston-rod is pulled 
upwards, a partial vacuum is 
produced in the pump-tube. 
The liquid then enters through 
the ball valve into the pump- 
tube. On the down stroke the 
liquid flows through the slide- 
valve into the hollow piston-rod 
and is forced out the nozzle. 
  Many of these small “handy” extinguishers are used in 
automobiles, in houses, and in 
other buildings. The carbon 
tetrachloride changes to a vapor 
at very low temperature. The 
vapor is about five times as 
heavy as air, and will neither 
burn nor support burning. Be- 
cause of these properties it is 
an excellent fire extinguisher. A 
small force pump operated by a 
handle at the top of the ex- 
tinguisher, throws the liquid a 
considerable distance. For small 
fires the extinguisher is very 
serviceable (Figures 239 and 
240). 
Experiment 61: Why is carbon tetra- 
chloride instead of water used to 
extinguish gasoline fires? 
(a) Pour a small quantity of 
gasoline in an iron or porcelain dish 
and light it. Slowly pour some 
water on the burning gasoline. 
Does the water extinguish the 
flame? Explain the result. 
(b) Repeat (a), pouring carbon 
tetrachloride instead of water on 
the burning gasoline. Is the fire 
extinguished? Why? 
There are still other ways of extinguishing fires. For gaso-

THE STORY OF UNIT Ix 
There are three important purposes for which heat from fires 
is used in the home. These are: (1) to keep the tempera- 
ture of the air comfortable, (2) to provide fresh air, and (3) 
to cook our foods. In Unit VIII you learned how fuels burn 
and produce heat; in this unit you will see how man makes 
use of fire and fuels in heating and ventilating his buildings, 
and in cooking. 
How would you like to have your house heated by an open 
fire in the corner of the room? A little over two thousand 
years ago this was the common method. Less than a thou- 
sand years ago the only improvement which had been made 
was the addition of a hole in the roof so that the smoke might 
escape. Later, fireplaces were constructed at one side of the 
room and a chimney was added. This type of fireplace is 
259

even yet in common use in many parts of Europe. The next 
improvement was to locate the fireplace in the wall and build 
up the chimney from the 
outside (Figure 241). 
Old colonial houses in 
the United States had 
fireplaces constructed in 
this manner, and such 
fireplaces are becoming 
more and more common 
in modern houses. 
In 1742 Benjamin 
Franklin made a great 
improvement on the 
S fireplace. It was a 
Fig. 241. A Colonial Fireplace simple thing, but it led 
to the construction of 
the modern stove. He built a device having three sides, made 
of sheets of metal (Figure 242). This he placed inside the 
fireplace. When the 
metal became hot, it 
gave off much more heat 
to the room than did 
the open fireplace. 
Franklin’s idea led to 
the construction of the 
closed stove with a 
stove-pipe leading to the 
chimney. Still the stove 
was not satisfactory.

by an outer jacket containing air (Figure 243). As the air in 
this hot-air chamber was heated, a convection current was set 
up, and the warm air was thus forced through pipes to the 
rooms above. Somewhat later the space between the jacket 
and the firepot was filled with water, and pipes were pro- 
vided to carry the 
heated water to the 
different rooms(Fig- 
ure 244). However, 
in large buildings 
the transfer of 
heat by convection 
currents of air or 
water is notsatisfac-

nace, in which water 
may be changed into 
steam and the steam

pipes by pressure, is 
used in these build- 
ings (Figure 251,

      the fire in the furnace, stove, or fireplace to the different parts 
of the building. This transfer of heat takes place in different 
ways. The heat from the fire warms the metal sides of the 
stove or furnace and is conducted through the metal, warming 
the air or water, which in turn carries the heat to different parts 
of the building. In open fires, such as the fireplace, most of 
the heat is transferred as radiant energy. (See pages 39, 176, 
and 179.) In the problems which follow, each of these methods 
of heat transfer will be studied in greater detail.

    262 HEAT AND VENTILATION 
In addition to keeping the air in the house at the proper 
temperature, provision must be made to secure a frequent 
change of air by ventilation. Natural ventilation is, of course, 
supplied by opening windows and doors; artificial ventilation 
has been developed in connection with the different heating 
devices. There 
are three 
requirements 
for good heat- 
ing and venti- 
lation: (1) the 
correct tem- 
perature (68°- 
70°F.), (2) the 
proper hu- 
midity (see 
page 47), and

PROBLEM 1: WHY DOES A STOVE HEAT A ROOM 
BETTER THAN A FIREPLACE? 
How heat is transferred. You have already studied the 
construction of a stove (see page 231), and you know how the 
fire in it is regulated. The question which you will have to 
answer is “How is the heat of the fire transferred to the air, 
to the walls, and to the objects in the room?”
-P-A-G-E-299
STOVES AND FIREPLACES 263 
Experiment 62: How is the heat of the fire transferred to the 
stove walls? 
(a) Light a candle. Hold your hand about six inches above it. 
Can you feel the heat? Hold a piece of burning punk or smoking paper 
above the candle flame. Note the direction of the particles of smoke 
which are carried along by the air currents. 
(6) Place your hand at the side of the flame at a distance of two 
or three inches. The air between your hand and the candle moves 
toward the flame. How do you explain why your hand is warmed 
when the air between your hand and the candle moves toward the 
flame? (See pages 39 and 176.) 
Inside the stove a convection current is set up because of the 
difference between the temperature of the air over the fire 
and that of the air outside of the stove. Why? (See pages 
57 and 231.) The particles of gas which come from the burn- 
ing fuel are hot. As they pass upward from the fire, they touch 
the sides and top of the stove and give up part of their heat 
to the metal. At the same time the fire is radiating energy 
to the sides of the stove and warming them. 
The heat must then pass through the metal walls of the stove. 
Experiment 63: How does heat travel through the metal 
walls of the stove? 
Hold a long nail in the flame of a Bunsen burner or candle. Note 
that the end which you are holding becomes hotter and hotter, 
but never gets as hot as the end which is in the flame. 
How does the heat travel to your hand? Do the particles of 
iron near the fire travel through the iron and give up their 
heat to you? It is evident that you have here a method of 
heat transfer which is different from convection. The iron, 
like all other materials, is made of small particles, called mole- 
cules. The molecules in the part of the nail held in the flame 
received heat from it. Each of these molecules then passed 
on a little heat to its neighbor. The neighbor passed on some 
to the next molecule, and so on. In time the end of the iron 
you hold in your hand receives this heat, and it gets hotter 
and hotter. This method of heat transfer from particle to

particle is called conduction, and it is the way that heat trav- 
els through the metal walls of the stove. (See page 176.)

the stove are heated, they must pass on their heat to the room

heat by convection? By

The fireplace is less 
efficient than the stove. 
The fireplace (Figure 
246) heats a room 
largely by radiation. and the objects in the room. The 
particles of air in contact with the 
stove are heated by conduction. This 
sets up a convection current in the 
room, as shown in Figure 245, because 
of the differences in temperature of the 
air. These particles of heated air give 
up part of their heat to the walls and 
objects in the room when they come in 
contact with them. The walls and ob- 
jects are also heated by radiation from 
all parts of the stove, as shown in 
Figure 245. The stove thus heats 
a room by all three methods of heat 
transfer.

small part of their heat to the room. The walls of the chimney 
are heated by the hot gases, and this heat passes through the 
walls by conduction. The air in contact with the wall of 
the chimney is thus heated and sets up a small convection 
current. The radiant energy from 
the fire passes through the room 
to the walls, warming the air but 
little, and is changed to heat when 
it strikes the walls. The furniture 
and other objects in the room are 
warmed in the same manner. The 
walls and furniture heated by 
radiation give up part of their heat 
to the air and produce convection 
currents. The fireplace is not an 
efficient heating device, because 
most of the heat escapes through 
the chimney. ie iy a

The most modern and efficient fireplace is the ventilating 
fireplace (Figure 247). Fresh air is brought into the room by 
a metal pipe which passes up behind the fireplace and over 
the top of the fire, opening into the room. The hot gases 
from the fire pass around the pipe as they escape into the 
chimney, and warm the fresh air as it enters the room. Why 
does the fresh air come in through the pipe? The ventilat- 
ing fireplace heats the room in the same manner as the ordinary 
fireplace, and, in addition, uses the hot gases which pass up the 
chimney to heat the fresh air, thus starting a convection cur- 
rent in the room.

PROBLEM 2: HOW DOES A HOT-AIR FURNACE HEAT 
AND VENTILATE A BUILDING? 
If you examine a hot-air furnace, you see that it is simply a 
large stove surrounded by an air chamber (Figure 243). Lead- 
ing away from this chamber are several pipes, or ducts. ‘Trace 
each one of the ducts shown in Figure 248. Where do they 
go? In the rooms you find a grating, or register, over the
-P-A-G-E-303

duct. The figure shows two registers in each room; one is 
called the hot-air register, and the other is called the cold- 
air register. The air rises through one duct and falls in the 
other because of the convection current which is produced. 
Explain how the   
convection current 
is produced. (See

(Figure 249) has

PROBLEM 3: HOW DOES A HOT-WATER HEATING 
PLANT OPERATE? 
The hot-water heating plant (Figures 244 and 250) differs 
from the hot-air furnace in two ways: (1) the space between 
the jacket and the firebox is filled with water, and (2) the hot 
water is carried to the rooms through pipes called risers, 
where it circulates through a radiator, and is then returned by 
pipes called returns to the water jacket, or heater. The direc- 
tion of the hot 
: water through the 
[3 eas | we pipes is shown in 
; Figure 250. 
  
Exercise 8. Ex- 
plain why the water 
circulates through 
the pipes. (See 
page 130.) 
The hot-water 
system must be 
full when it is 
started, and this 
makes an outlet 
necessary to take 
care of the in- 
creased volume of 
water. Why does 
the volume of water increase? (See page 44.) An expansion 
tank is usually placed in the attic and is connected by a pipe 
to the heater. Leading from the top of the expansion tank to 
the roof is a small pipe through which the water may overflow. 
The amount of heat carried to a room can be regulated 
by closing or opening a valve in the pipe which brings the 
water to the radiator. Refer to Figure 250, and explain why 
closing the valve on one radiator does not stop the flow of 
water in other radiators.       [oma]

In'a steam heating plant water is changed into steam in a 
boiler placed over the firebox (Figure 251). 
Experiment 64: How is water Steam Dome 
changed to steam? : 
Pour some water in a tall beaker 
and place it over a wire gauze. Put 
a thermometer into the beaker. 
Place a burner under the gauze and 
light the gas. In a short time small 
bubbles appear. These are bubbles 
of air. Take the temperature. 
Continue to heat the water, until 
very large bubbles are formed. These 
bubbles are steam. Soon the bubbles 
of steam reach the surface of the 
water and escape into the air. Take 
the temperature.

this is approximately 100° C.

Scientists explain the expansion of any liquid like water by 
assuming the liquid is made up of millions of tiny particles 
called molecules. It is believed that when the liquid is heated, 
these molecules move farther apart, and therefore the liquid 
takes up more space. Finally the distance between the mole- 
cules is so great that the liquid changes to a gas, causing

rect explanation. 
Steam exerts pressure. The steam heating plant differs 
from the hot-air and hot-water systems in its method of trans- 
ferring the heat of the fire to the various rooms. You have 
learned what makes water and air circulate through a heating 
system. Let us now determine how steam is sent through the 
pipes of the system. 
Experiment 65: What causes the steam to circulate through 
the pipes? 
Place about one inch of water in a test tube. Stopper the tube 
with a cork, but do not insert the cork tightly. Heat the tube with 
a small flame. What happens shortly after the water begins to boil? 
In the steam heating plant the steam is forced to circulate 
through the pipes and radiators by pressure produced in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
  
STEAM HEATING PLANTS 271 
boiler. How does the steam exert pressure? As the water 
changes into steam, it expands hundreds of times, forcing the 
molecules of steam above the water in the boiler closer and 
closer together so that the steam is compressed. This steam 
exerts pressure when compressed, because of the motion of the 
molecules. The molecules are moving, and strike the walls of 
the containing vessel with great speed. 
Millions and millions of them bombard the eee 
walls. As the steam is compressed, more ’ 
molecules are forced into the same space, 
and the number striking the walls increases. 
This steady bombardment is like a stream 
of water playing on the side of a building. 
So many particles of water strike at a given Pitas 
time that a steady pressure is exerted 
against the wall. 
The steam heating plant (Figure 252) Fig. 253. Air Vent i for Radiator 
differs but little from the hot-water plant. 
Steam is carried to the radiators through the risers. In the 
radiators the steam condenses into water, giving up its heat. 
The water is carried back to the boiler by a return pipe. No 
expansion tank is necessary in this system. Why? Each 
radiator is fitted with an air vent (Figure 253) to allow the 
escape of the air which is driven from the water as it is heated, 
and from the pipes and radiators. When steam enters the 
radiator, the air is driven toward the air vent and escapes. As 
soon as the steam reaches the valves of the air vent, the heat 
from the steam automatically closes the valve, keeping the 
steam in the radiator. The condensed steam flows, back into 
the radiator through the siphon. The radiator warms the room 
in the same manner as that of the hot-water heating plant:     Courtesy Marsh & Co. 
Exercise 11. Make a drawing of a steam heating plant. Indicate 
the direction of the steam through the pipes. Show how the room

  272 HEAT AND VENTILATION 
PROBLEM 5: HOW IS GOOD VENTILATION SECURED? 
The ill effects of “bad air” are not caused by too much 
carbon dioxide. You recall (Unit V) that air expelled from the 
lungs differs in four ways from ordinary air. (See page 153.) 
Exercise 13. What changes take place in air during breathing? 
Years ago it was thought that the bad effects resulting 
from poor ventilation were due to the addition of carbon 
dioxide to the air during breathing, and the decrease in the 
amount of oxygen in the air. Recent experiments show that 
the ill effects from bad air are not due to these causes. 
There are several reasons why air 
becomes bad. If you have ever been in 
a crowded, poorly ventilated room, you 
have probably noticed the presence of 
bad odors. These odors may be due to 
several causes, such as decayed teeth, a 
disordered stomach, or unclean bodies 
and clothing. The temperature of the 
air in the room also increases because of 
the heat from the bodies of the people 
present. Since exhaled air contains a 
large amount of moisture, the humidity 
of the room also increases. Scientists 
now believe that these three changes in 
Fig. 254. Window Open the air—foul odors, high temperature, 
at Top and Bottom and high humidity, are the real causes of 
bad effects from poor ventilation. A good 
system of ventilation will prevent the temperature and humidity 
of the air from becoming too high, will keep the air clear of 
bad odors, and will keep it in motion. 
The temperature of the air should be correct. In Unit VI 
you learned how the body regulates its own temperature. (See 
page 175.) The temperature of a room should always be such 
that the heat-regulating mechanism of the body shall have as 
little to do as possible. If the temperature of the air is too low, 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
SECURING GOOD VENTILATION 273 
the body must adjust itself to this condition by decreasing the 
amount of blood in the skin or by burning more food. Why? If 
the temperature of the air is too high, the body must pour more 
perspiration on the skin and send more blood to the skin. Why? 
These changes require energy which must be taken from the 
body. Careful experimentation has shown that the best 
temperature for all-round 
bodily comfort and effi- 
ciency is from 68 to 70 de- 
grees Fahrenheit. 
The proper humidity 
should be maintained. 
When the humidity is very 
high, but little perspiration 
can be evaporated from the 
skin, and, as the body

humidity of the air may be 
too low. This is particularly true in the winter time when 
the cold dry air from out of doors is brought into the house 
and warmed. Why? (See page 52.) Dry air absorbs mois- 
ture very rapidly. The linings of the nose, throat, and bron- 
chial tubes must at all times be moist. Dry air will cause 
this moisture to evaporate rapidly from these linings, and may 
produce irritation. For this reason it is generally necessary 
to add moisture to the air during the winter months. In case 
the heating system does not provide enough moisture, pans of 
water can be placed on the stoves or on the radiator. 
Rooms and houses may be ventilated by windows. A very 
common method of ventilating rooms is by windows (Figure 
254). When the temperature of the air outside of the room 
is less than that inside, a convection current will be produced 
as the cold air enters and forces out the warmer air. Since 
the warmer air is near the ceiling, the window is opened at 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
274 HEAT AND VENTILATION 
the top as well as at the bottom. Why? In case the tem- 
perature of the air inside of the room is the same as that out- 
acl ANY’ side, no convection current 
|] Fi \\t will be produced, and no air 
W) will enter unless there is a 
breeze outdoors. To use this 
| breeze several windows must 
be opened so that the air 
may sweep through the room. 
Extremely strong drafts 
should be avoided, however, 
especially when one is not 
moving about. 
To secure ventilation and 
at the same time to prevent: 
strong drafts from blowing 
directly on one, it is advisable 
to use a window-board (Figure 255) which will cause the incom- 
ing air to be deflected upward. A frame fitting the window 
and covered with a cloth (Figure 256) will 
accomplish the same result and at the same 
time will prevent the entrance of dust. The 
effect which one should try to produce is that 
of a gentle current which will change the air 
often enough to provide about thirty cubic 
feet of fresh air a minute for each person. 
Heating devices also furnish ventilation. 
There are several other systems of ventilation 
used in connection with the heating system.

These hot coils raise the temperature of the air. The air is humidified 
and washed as it passes through streams of water in the air washer. The

to a temperature of from 80° to 120°. Part of the air from the blower

ing. This method greatly increases the volume of fresh air 
supplied. The air may be washed and humidified by forcing 
it through a spray of water. By warming the air to the proper

THE STORY OF UNIT X 
When you look around and see so many’ different objects, 
you wonder where they all come from and of what they are 
made. There seems to be no end to man’s use of different 
materials for constructing his houses, barns, factories, and 
other buildings; for making his tools and machinery; for pro- 
viding means of travel and transportation; for making the 
thousand-and-one things which he needs for his comfort, 
efficiency, and enjoyment. 
      Adobe House African Thache 
Fig. 260. Homes Unknown to Most of Us 
In early days man used only materials which nature pro- 
vided, such as straw, skins, wood, clay, bones, and stones. It 
was of these materials that he made his crude buildings (Fig- 
ures 259-261) and primitive tools. He had only to collect them
-P-A-G-E-316
  280 MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION 
and, perhaps, to shape them into usable forms. From stones 
he made his arrows, skinning tools, axes, grinding stones, and 
other devices for procuring and preparing his food, for shaping 
wood to build his shelters, and for defending himself against 
his enemies (Figure 262). Later he discovered in the earth 
certain metals which he shaped into many different forms. 
    Monlescrria © Castle Arizona    Fig. 261. Primitive Homes in Different Climates 
By the use of fire he made great progress in obtaining metals 
from their ores and in manufacturing all sorts of devices from 
these metals. Because we now use metals for so many pur- 
poses, we sometimes speak of the present age as the “metal 
age,” as-contrasted with the so-called “wood age” and “stone 
age’’ of past centuries. 
The preparation of building materials is one of the world’s 
greatest industries. Millions of people are daily working in 
mines, in stone quarries, in factories, and in fields and forests, 
where they collect, shape, and manufacture innumerable 
objects to satisfy our needs and comforts. These millions of 
workers are needed in order that we may have stones, cement, 
mortar and plaster, brick, tile, pottery, glass, iron and steel, 
many other metals, rope, wood, and hundreds of other things. 
And every year new materials come into use. The number 
of these different materials is so great because we are con- 
stantly searching for those which have certain properties, or 
qualities, best fitting them for particular uses. 
There are two kinds of properties, physical and chemical, 
which determine the use of materials. The physical properties
-P-A-G-E-317
  THE STORY OF UNIT X 281 
are those by which you recognize a material without changing 
it into some new material. For example, materials may be 
recognized by and may depend for their use upon properties 
like the following: color, hardness, strength, transparency 
(can you see through it?), malleability (can it be hammered

into sheets?), conductivity of heat (can heat travel through 
it?), conductivity of electricity (can electricity pass through 
it?), and physical staie (is it solid, liquid, or gaseous?). 
The chemical properties are those characteristics which a 
material shows when it undergoes chemical changes. Thus, 
wood decays when exposed to air and moisture; iron rusts 
unless protected from the air; wood burns; cement and stone 
are non-combustible; brass is acted upon by salt water and 
becomes porous and weak; some stones crumble as a result 
of the chemical action of the air. The durability and use of 
a material thus depend largely upon its chemical properties.
-P-A-G-E-318
    282 MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION 
It is because of these chemical properties that all kinds of 
preservatives and protective substances must be used to in- 
crease the durability of certain materials. Such preserva- 
tives make possible the use of materials which have desirable 
physical properties. For example, iron, which is strong and 
a good conductor of heat, may be used for locomotive boilers 
or other heating devices if it is protected from rusting by a 
coat of paint. Or, as another example, wood may be very 
durable for interior construction, but will decay very rapidly 
out-of-doors unless protected by the use of creosote or paint. 
There is one other factor, besides the properties of a ma- 
terial, which determines how widely it is used: unless a ma- 
terial is available in large quantity and at a relatively low cost, 
it must give way to a cheaper and more plentiful material. 
For this reason brick, stone, cement, and tile are being used 
instead of wood for many purposes. While the properties of 
these materials are a large factor in determining their greater 
use, it is also true that in some places these materials can be 
obtained or manufactured more cheaply than wood can be 
shipped and prepared. A striking example of this is the in- 
creased use of paper and cardboard for making boxes, which 
were formerly made almost entirely of wood. 
The more important construction materials are shown in 
Table X. Wood is listed first because it is still used in such 
enormous quantities. Then follow the principal groups of ma- 
terials with some of the more common examples of each group.

PROBLEM 1: HOW IS WOOD PREPARED FOR BUILDING 
PURPOSES? 
Wood is the most common building material. Everywhere 
about us we see things made of wood. The lumber industry 
is one of the most important in the United States. Not only 
is wood used for building houses and for making furniture, 
but it also finds many other uses, such as making boxes, side- 
walks, railroad cars, vehicles, fences, pavements, and handles 
for tools. The table below will give you some idea of the 
large quantity of wood used in certain years from 1880 to 1924.

*Figures are approximate, being estimated from graph in the U.§. Department of 
Agriculture, Bulletin 1119. 
The table shows the number of board feet of lumber used. 
(A “board foot” is a board one inch thick, twelve inches wide, 
and twelve inches long.) Roughly, about 70 per cent of the 
total amount of lumber consumed is used for general building
-P-A-G-E-320
284 MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION 
purposes. The remaining 30 per cent is used for making 
furniture, fences, boxes, paper, and other special articles. 
New ways of preparing lumber have taken the place of the 
old ways. For many years man prepared wood for different 
uses without the aid of machinery. The trees were felled with 
axes, and then cut into logs. The logs were used mainly for 
building crude but 
attractive houses, 
and for making 
roadbeds through 
swampy _ regions. 
Sometimes the logs 
were hewn with 
wide axes until they 
were square, or 
split into various 
shapes and used for 
fuel, rail fences,

The shingles, or ‘“‘shakes,”’ have been worn until , 
they are almost as thin as paper. straight saw came 
into use, and the 
trees were more easily felled and cut into proper lengths. 
Then came the circular saws, which made still easier and more 
rapid the sawing of the logs into posts, boards, shingles, and 
other shapes. With the coming of circular saws many saw 
mills were built in the forests. These sawmills were moved 
from place to place as the supply of timber made necessary. 
At the present time most of the logs are floated down stream 
to the mills (Figure 264), or hauled to railroad cars to be 
shipped to cities and towns where there are the sawmills. 
‘The rough-sawed lumber must be dried, or seasoned, before 
it can be used for finer construction. To season it, the lumber 
is stacked with air spaces between the boards and allowed to 
stand until the water it contains evaporates. Stacking the   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-321

lumber keeps it straight while it dries. Sometimes the green 
lumber is placed in large ovens, or kilns, where it is heated to 
evaporate the water. This requires less time than the natural 
drying or seasoning process. The dry lumber will not warp 
and lose its shape. 
The board lumber for finishing the outside of houses, for 
making furniture, refrigerators, window-sashes, and similar 
finished products, is sent through a planing machine which

removes the rough aunt: When a fine finish is desired, the 
lumber may be sandpapered, or surfaced, until it is smooth 
enough to be painted or stained. 
You see that four important processes are necessary in the 
preparation of wood for finer building purposes: (1) cutting 
and logging the trees; (2) sawing the logs; (3) seasoning the 
lumber; and (4) finishing the boards. 
The grain in lumber depends upon the growth of the tree 
and the method of sawing. All trees grow more rapidly in 
the spring than they do in the: ‘late summer or fall. When 
the growth is rapid, the cells of the wood are large and loosely

The picture of the log is so small that 
you cannot count the pairs of layers, but 
you can see many light and dark rings. arranged. During the sum- 
mer the cells grow slowly, 
are small, and arrange 
themselves very compact- 
ly, forming a dark, dense 
layer. No growth takes 
place in the winter. By 
examining the end of a log, 
one can see these alternate 
layers of dark compact 
cells and lighter loose cells. 
Each pair of layers of this 
kind shows a year’s growth 
from the center outward, 
as shown in Figure 265. 
The rings are called an- 
nual rings, and from the 
number of them you can tell about how old a tree is. 
Since the layers are not of equal depth in all parts of the tree, 
cutting across   
these unequal 
layers results 
inthedifferent 
grains,or pat- 
terns, which 
you see in 
many boards.

two oak boards, one tangential-sawed and the other quarter-

the center of the tree outward, has a different structure from 
that of other parts of the log (Figure 268). In hardwoods, 
like oak, these medullary rays add to the beauty of the lumber,

especially in quarter-sawed boards. Softwoods do not have 
the beautiful grain of the hardwoods. 
The terms “hardwood” and “softwood” are not well chosen. 
They refer to the method of growing and to the structure of 
the tree rather than to the hardness of the wood. However, 
as a rule hardwood is stronger and more durable than soft- 
wood. Hardwoods, like oak, ash, and maple, are much used

288 MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION 
in building heavy structures and in making furniture, flooring, 
and doors.. The softwoods, such as pine and cedar, are exten- 
sively used to make boxes, shingles, telegraph and fence posts, 
and window-sashes. 
Wood has certain advantages 
and disadvantages. Wood is 
lighter than most other construc- 
tion materials. It is easily shaped 
into different forms. The natural 
color and beautiful grain of wood 
cannot be duplicated in any other 
building material, except perhaps 
in the finer varieties of marble 
and expensive manufactured ma- 
terials. Wood is not a conductor 
of heat or electricity and can, 
he therefore, be used for making

The disadvantages of wood for 
some uses are so great that other materials have been substi- 
tuted for it. Wood decays rapidly when moist and exposed to 
air. Another great objection to the use of wood is its com- 
bustible nature. Because of this property, fireproof materials 
like metals, stone, cement, brick, tile, and terra cotta have been 
substituted for it. The development of machinery has made 
it necessary to use iron and other metals to a large extent. 
Not only must the materials of which machinery is made be 
fireproof, but they must have great strength and weight. The 
greater strength and durability of these substitute materials 
indicate another disadvantage in the use of wood.

PROBLEM 2: WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 
PRINCIPAL BUILDING STONES? 
The combustibility, rapid decay, great cost, and lack of 
strength of wood as a building material have led to the use 
of stones and other materials obtained from the earth. Espe- 
cially in large cities, safety from fire requires the use of non- 
combustible materials. Nearly $100,000,000 worth of stone is 
used in construction each year in the United States. 
There are five important building stones. Granite, sand- 
stone, limestone, marble, and slate are found in various parts 
of our country. The ease with which they can be quarried 
(Figure 269), cut, and transported, and the fact that large 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  290 MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION 
deposits are found near cities where they are used, have made 
them cheap. They wear better than wood, and can with- 
stand the strain of greater weights. For foundations and large 
buildings, they are especially fitted. Most of them are dur- 
able under all weather conditions. Can 
you distinguish one from another? 
Experiment 66: What are the properties of 
granite, sandstone, limestone, marble, 
and slate? 
  (a) Examine pieces of granite. In the 
coarse granites you can see distinctly three 
kinds of materials. The white glass-like 
i crystals are quartz. The dull white-to- men, the particles of the 5 PR a le ey Pe a salmon-colored masses are feldspar. Scat- 
small that it is difficult to tered between the quartz and the feldspar 
see them. are black particles of mica (isinglass). 
Sometimes these materials are very small 
and so thoroughly mixed that each cannot be recognized distinctly 
(Figure 270). The colors of the quartz and feldspar vary in different 
granites because of the presence of impurities. 
(6) Examine pieces of sandstone (Figure 
271). Can yousee the sand particles? Can you 
break away small grains of sand? Observe the 
layer-like formation of the stone and the color 
of several samples. This color is due to im- 
purities like those in the quartz or feldspar of 
granite. Do you think that sandstone can be 
cut and chiseled as easily as granite? Why? 
(c) Examine pieces of limestone (Figure Fig. 270. Granite

scratched? Does the limestone have a layer- 
like structure? Allow a few drops of hydrochloric acid to fall on a 
piece of the stone. What happens? The bubbles are carbon dioxide. 
(Try the acid test on sandstone and granite. Result?)

  CHARACTERISTICS OF BUILDING STONES 291 
(d) Examine pieces of marble (Figure 273). Note the crystalline 
appearance. Drop acid on the marble. Do bubbles appear? Is 
the marble as easy to scratch as limestone? Do 
you think it can be cut as easily? Has it a 
layer-like structure? 
(e) Examine pieces of slate (Figure 274). Note 
the smooth surface. Try the acid test. Try to 
break the slate, and observe that it splits into 
layers.

The great strength and durability of 
granite, the ease with which it can be 
highly polished, and the variety of colors 
of different kinds make it especially useful 
for large buildings, monuments, and 
tombstones. It is so compact that not 
enough water can enter between the par- 
ticles to cause the stone to break when 
the water freezes and expands. For this 
reason you may often find sharp projec- 
tions and faces of granite in mountain- 
ous regions, which have withstood the 
weather for many years. Gran- 
ites are so strong that a block 
of this stone one cubic inch in 
size can bear a pressure of from 
12,000 to 21,000 pounds without 
breaking. 
Sandstones are made of sand 
which has been compressed into

for heavy building purposes and do not last long under con- 
stant wear. You have undoubtedly seen steps made of sand- 
stone which were in part worn away by use. Sandstones of

and the lighter colored sandstones of St. Genevieve, Missouri, 
are among the most important deposits. 
Limestone is probably the most common of all natural 
building stones. It varies in color from nearly pure white 
to gray and black. It finds many uses other than ordinary 
building purposes, such as in the manufacturing of cement, 
fertilizers, glass, and lime, in making roadbeds for highways 
and railroads, and for freeing iron from its ore. It is usually 
very hard and cannot be easily cut. The gray-colored stone

is used extensively for trimming brick buildings. The largest 
quarries are found in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and Vermont 
(Figure 275). 
Marble is the most beautiful of all building stones. The 
pure white and the rich colors in different varieties give the

stone extensive use in constructing fine buildings (Figure 276). 
The white, gray, brown, reddish, and blue-colored varieties 
are particularly ornamental, although the white is easily 
stained. Its structure, or texture, allows it to be highly 
polished, but makes it hard to cut and chisel. The Vermont 
quarries are the most famous in this country. 
Slate is used principally for roofing and blackboards. The 
layer-like structure of the stone makes it possible to split 
the stone into slabs. These slabs may then be surfaced until 
they are quite smooth. The stone is fairly hard, but does 
not withstand great wear. The principal slate quarries are 
found in Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont.

Exercise 6. Examine different stones used in constructing your 
schoolhouse and other buildings. For what parts of the buildings is 
each kind of stone used? Why? 
Exercise 7. Make a collection of pieces of building stones, and see 
if you can recognize the different stones described in this problem. 
Exercise 8. Why are steps made of sandstone worn down rather 
rapidly? 
The building stones were formed in different ways. The 
process of formation of these building stones explains the 
differences in their structure and appearance. Granite is 
an igneous rock (igneous refers to fire). It was formed when the 
different rock materials which are in it, melted, mixed together, 
and then cooled. It therefore shows no layer-like structure. 
Sandstone and limestone are called sedimentary rocks. Sand- 
stone was once fine sand deposited in a body of water and later 
covered to a great depth with other materials, like mud or 
limestone, which compressed it into a hard stone. Similarly, 
limestone was formed in layers when millions and millions of 
small water creatures died and their skeletons sank to the 
bottom of the water to be covered with other deposits and 
pressed into solid stone. Marble and slate are known as 
metamorphic rocks. They were formed from sedimentary 
rocks which were covered by deep layers of other materials 
and then subjected to great heat, as well as to the pressure of 
the layers above. The great heat and pressure changed lime- 
stone to marble, and changed shale, that is, compressed clay 
deposits, to slate.

  USE OF CLAY IN CONSTRUCTION 295 
PROBLEM 3: HOW IS CLAY USED FOR CONSTRUCTION? 
Clay deposits are so common that for centuries great amounts 
of clay have been used in many different countries to make 
brick, tile, and other building materials, and also pottery. 
Parts of buildings made of sun-baked clay are still found in 
Egypt and in the valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. 
The adobe buildings of Mexico and of certain Indian tribes 
in the United States 
are other examples 
of the durability 
of unburned bricks 
(Figure 277). 
Clay is used 
in making bricks. 
The bricks of today 
are made of clay, 
sandy clay, or marls. 
When bricks of pure 
clay are molded and 
baked, they shrink, 
crack, and warp; Fig. 277. An Adobe Building 
therefore, sand, Indians in Colorado enjoying a holiday at 
ashes, or cinders are home on their adobe houses. 
sometimes added to 
overcome these defects. The sandy clays are composed of sand 
and clay. If too much sand is present in the bricks, they 
will be brittle. Pure clay must be added to such sandy clays 
until the proper mixture is obtained. Marl is a mixture of 
clay, sand, and a loose form of limestone. The limestone 
makes the brick very hard and non-porous when baked. 
There are also present in the marl small quantities of iron 
oxide, lime, and soda. It is the iron oxide which gives the 
brick its red color. Lime clays or marls which contain no 
iron oxide and no plant material form white bricks when they 
are baked.     Ewing Galloway

Experiment 67: How can bricks be made? 
Obtain some clay and moisten it enough to make a plastic mass. 
Shape this into small brick forms. Place some in the bright sun and 
others in a hot bake-oven for several hours. Examine the bricks 
when cold. You see that they are not very hard. The heat of the 
sun or the bake-oven is not great enough to make them hard. Now 
place them on a small pan over a burner or in the firebox of a stove 
or furnace and leave them for several hours. Remove them and see 
how they have changed in appearance and texture.

At the right is the brick-stuffer forcing out the long white bar of stiff 
clay. The machine at the left cuts the bar into bricks, which may be seen 
at the extreme left. 
In making bricks, the correct mixture of clay and other 
ingredients must first be prepared. From this point on, 
three different processes of shaping the clay are used. In 
one process the clay is moistened until quite plastic and is 
then pressed into molds. As it dries it contracts slightly, 
and the bricks can be removed and placed in ovens to be thor-

those of early times. A second process is called the stiff-clay 
process. The clay, properly mixed, is moistened. The 
plastic mass is placed in a big container that works like 
a sausage-stuffer (Figure 278). The clay is forced through a

are dried and placed in kilns, or ovens, where they are heated,

‘a second time. The composition of the glaze not only determines 
the color, but it also determines the smoothness or roughness of 
the surface of the baked tile. By selecting the proper materials 
and baking them at correct temperatures, a large variety of ma- 
terials like pottery, china, porcelain, and terra cotta can be made.

Pottery is made of clay. The clay that is used for pottery 
such as china and porcelain is very pure. It is free from iron 
compounds which would cause it to be colored when baked. 
In preparation the dry clay is ground to a very fine pee 
and then mixed with enough water to 
make it plastic. It is then shaped 
into plates, saucers, vases, or any de- 
sired form. The making of beauti- 
fully shaped vases is a fine art and 
must be done by hand, as shown in 
Figure 281. The simple forms, such 
as saucers and plates, may be shaped 
by machinery. 
After the forms are made and have 
dried for a short time, they are placed 
in kilns (Figure 282). Here they 
are heated to a high temperature for 
several hours and then allowed to cool 
in the kilns. When the objects are 
removed from the kiln, they are hard 
but porous articles, called bisque. Fig. 282. A Pottery Kiln

are used to place the design on the article, and it is then fired 
for a third time. The coloring materials melt into the glaze 
and give the desired color as a permanent part of the glaze. 
If you ever have an opportunity to make a trip through a 
pottery, you should be sure to do so, for pottery-making is a 
most interesting industry.

PROBLEM 4: HOW IS CEMENT MADE AND USED? 
Probably no building material has been substituted for 
wood to as great extent as cement. In recent years buildings, 
bridges, sidewalks, piers, fence posts, and roads, have been

The steel framework is ready.

  made of concrete, which is 
a mixture of cement, sand, 
and gravel or crushed stone. 
This concrete becomes as 
hard as stone. It is very 
durable and can be used 
under water as well as 
above ground. For large 
buildings, bridges, and other 
structures which must bear 
heavy weights and great 
strains, the concrete is re- 
inforced with iron rods, wire, 
or steel beams (Figures 283 
and 284). 
Cement is a combination 
of lime and clay. Cement 
is usually made by heating 
together a mixture of the 
proper amounts of clay and 
limestone, although there 
are some natural rocks 
which contain the right 
proportion of these two 
substances. When the arti- 
ficial or natural mixture is heated to a high temperature for 
a long time, the clay and the lime from the limestone combine 
to form a compound. This hard compound is then ground 
into a fine powder forming the cement which we use. 
Most cement is used to make concrete. When it is 
used fer construction purposes, cement is mixed with sand,

  MANUFACTURE AND USE OF CEMENT 301 
gravel or stone, and water to make concrete. The wet, 
“mushy” concrete is placed in forms made of wood until it 
becomes hard or “‘sets.”? The wooden forms are then removed. 
The “setting” or hardening is due to the action of the water 
upon the cement. The 
water is absorbed and 
combines with the cement 
to form a new compound 
so hard that it is called 
artificial rock. 
In making concrete, 
four things must be con- 
sidered. First, the mix- 
ture must be thoroughly 
wet or there will not be 
enough water to combine 
with the cement to form 
the artificial rock.

  from the other parts of 
the mixture, leaving only 
sand and gravel. The mass will then not harden properly. 
Third, there must be a correct proportion of cement, sand, and 
gravel or stone. If there is too much cement in the mixture, it 
will crack easily; if too little cement is used, the sand and 
gravel will not be cemented together well. Fourth, the concrete 
must be kept in the forms and be allowed to harden for days 
before it is used. Thus, in road-building traffic is not allowed 
on the road until weeks after the concrete is placed. 
The correct amounts of the cement, sand, gravel, and stone 
vary with the different uses of the concrete. For making side- 
walks, roadbeds, and foundations, the mixture may consist of 
one part cement, two to three parts sand, and four to six parts

gravel or crushed stone (Figure 285). The top layer of 
sidewalks and roadbeds is usually made of cement and fine 
sand without the gravel or crushed stone. This makes it 
possible to give the surface a smooth finish.

LIME AND ITS USES IN BUILDING 303 
PROBLEM 5: HOW IS LIME USED FOR BUILDING 
PURPOSES? 
Lime is made from limestone. You recall that limestone is 
one of the important building stones. While it is used directly 
for building, it is also the source of lime, a substance which is 
very important for construction purposes. 
  
    
Courtesy Rock Products 
Fig. 286. Six Limekilns in a Row 
The limestone is dumped into the top of the kiln from the platform 
shown at the top. See Figure 287 which shows the construction of a 
kiln. Each of these kilns can produce from 12 to 15 tons of lime a day, 
Experiment 69: How can you make lime? 
Break a lump of limestone into small pieces and place them in a 
crucible or small iron dish. Heat the limestone to a red heat for 
an hour. Allow it to cool. Observe that the white substance which 
is left crumbles easily. When it is quite cool, add a few drops of 
water and note that the lime becomes warm. (If you have no way to 
heat the limestone, get a small lump of quicklime from the lumber- 
yard or some other place where lime is sold.) 
Lime is the white material which you have probably seen 
where brick or stone walls were being built or where build- 
ings were being plastered. The stone-mason or brick-layer 
adds water to lumps of lime in a mortar-box. The water often 
becomes so warm by its chemical action on the lime that some 
of the water is changed to steam and rises above the box. 
   
-P-A-G-E-340
  304 MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION 
Lime is manufactured in large quantities in a way similar 
to that used in Experiment 69. Limestone is placed in a 
cylindrical kiln (Figures 286 and 287) lined with fire-brick. 
The fire around the bottom of the kiln is started, and the hot 
    
        
  Fig. 287. Sectional View 
of a Limekiln 
The hot gases from the 
fire-box pass upward and 
decompose the limestone. 
The lime sinks to the bot- 
tom, where it is dropped 
into the lime car when the 
draw gate is opened.   gases rise through the limestone, which 
decomposes, giving off carbon dioxide 
which escapes with the fire gases. The 
limestone becomes porous as it decom- 
poses, and some of it crumbles into 
powder. This lime, called quicklime, 
settles to the bottom of the kiln where 
it is removed, as shown in Figure 287. 
Lime is used to make mortar, plas- 
ter, and stucco. In very early times 
walls of brick and stone were laid with- 
out mortar, but even the Egyptians, 
Greeks, and Romans knew how to 
make and use mortar. Mortar and 
plaster are made in much the same 
way. Water is added to quicklime, 
with which it combines to form slaked 
lime. Then enough water is added 
to make a thin paste. Sand is mixed 
with this in proper amounts to make 
a stiff paste. Usually some cement is 
also added to give the mortar greater 
strength when it hardens. If it is de- 
sired to have colored mortar, coloring 
material is mixed in. For making 
plaster, hair or wood pulp is added 
to the mixture of sand and lime. 
These materials help to hold the plaster together. Stucco is 
a plaster or mortar used to finish the outside of buildings. 
The building is covered with wire netting or laths of wood 
or iron, and the stucco is then put on. The rough surface 
adds to the appearance and helps prevent cracks showing.
-P-A-G-E-341
GLASS AND ITS USES 305 
Experiment 70: How can you make mortar? 
Add water to some lumps of quicklime. Note how the lime 
crumbles and that it becomes too hot to touch. Continue to add 
water slowly, and stir until you have a thin paste. Then add sand 
until a thick paste results. Place this paste in a small box or between 
two bricks, and allow it to harden. After several days or weeks place 
a few drops of an acid on the mortar and note the bubbles formed by 
the action of the acid. The mortar has in part changed to limestone. 
When mortar, plaster, or stucco hardens or “sets,” the slaked 
lime combines with the carbon dioxide of the air to form 
limestone. In time the limestone becomes very hard and se- 
curely holds the sand particles in it. If cement is used with 
the lime and sand, the cement sets by combining with the water 
present and forms a hard stone. You can show the presence 
of limestone in hardened plaster, mortar, or stucco, by adding 
a few drops of acid and observing the bubbles of the gas formed. 
Exercise 14. State the differences in making lime, mortar, plaster, 
and concrete. 
Exercise 15. Collect samples of hardened plaster, mortar, and stucco. 
Test them with an acid to see if they contain limestone. 
PROBLEM 6: HOW IS GLASS MANUFACTURED? 
The peculiar properties of glass make it usable for many 
purposes. When glass is hot and soft it may be molded, pressed, 
or blown into any shape, but when cold, it is very hard and 
durable and is not acted upon by air, water, and most chem- 
icals. It breaks rather easily when struck a sharp blow, but 
can bear great weights without cracking. Sudden changes 
of temperature may crack it. When heated, it does not 
change to a liquid at a definite temperature like some solids (ice, 
fer example), but gradually becomes soft and plastic as the 
temperature is increased. In cooling it slowly changes back 
into a solid, allowing time for molding and shaping it. Prob- 
ably its most important property is its transparency; because 
of this property no good substitute for it has been found.

and heated by flames of burning gas. The hot gases from the

The man in the foreground is

ball of molten glass.    and melt the ingredients to- 
gether into a soft mass. When 
the mixture has thoroughly com- 
bined to form glass, it is ready 
to be blown, pressed, or rolled 
into shape. The mixture which 
is placed in the furnace to make 
common glass usually consists 
of sand, mixed with soda and 
limestone in about the following 
proportions: sand, 6 parts; soda, 
2 parts; limestone, 1 part. 
Window glass and cheap plate- 
glass are made of such mixtures. 
The different shapes of glass 
articles are produced by blow- 
ing, molding, and rolling. To 
make small tubes, the workman, 
called a glass-blower, dips one 
end of an iron tube, a few feet 
long, into the molten, or liquid, 
glass through a hole in the side 
of the furnace. He twists the 
tube and withdraws it, bringing 
out a small ball of glass on the 
end of the tube (Figure 288). 
By blowing in the other end he 
can form a small opening inside 
the ball, and then, by clamping one end of the glass ball in 
place by means of machinery and pulling on the iron tube, 
the hollow ball of glass can be drawn out into a long cylinder. 
For making window glass a large ball of glass on the end of 
a blowing-tube is blown into a long cylinder a foot or more

in diameter. The cylinder is then split lengthwise with a 
diamond glass-cutter and laid in an oven. Here it softens and 
becomes flat. It must then be heated again and allowed to 
cool very slowly in another oven. This process is called 
annealing. Annealed glass does not easily break or crack. 
For rolling plate-glass the molten liquid is drawn from the 
furnace into a large metal pot and then poured on a large flat 
iron table. Here rollers squeeze it to the proper thickness. 
The plate when cool is uneven and must be ground and sur- 
faced until it is flat and smooth. For making tumblers and 
bowls, and similar open vessels, the molten glass is poured 
into a mold of correct size for the outside of the vessel. A 
plunger which has the size and shape of the inside of the 
vessel is then pressed into the mold, squeezing the soft glass 
into shape. This process is called pressing. 
Exercise 16. Make a statement outline for a talk on “The Story of 
a Pane of Glass.” 
PROBLEM 7: HOW ARE METALS OBTAINED AND USED? 
We live in the ‘‘metal age.” The manufacture of iron 
and steel is the world’s greatest industry. Such great indus- 
trial centers as Pittsburgh, Gary, and Birmingham owe their 
development to the huge iron and steel plants. Large city 
buildings, bridges, steam engines, automobiles, ships, and 
railroads are but a few of the important constructions for 
which iron and other metals are used. Fences, nails, bolts, 
stoves, furnaces, sewers, tools, tableware, hardware, and 
thousands of other necessary articles are manufactured from 
metals like iron, copper, lead, zinc, and aluminum. Besides 
these more commonly used metals, there are many others, like 
manganese, mercury, arsenic, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, 
molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, silver, gold, platinum, tin, and 
tungsten. While a few of the metals are found free, or un- 
combined with other materials in the earth, for example, gold, 
platinum, and copper, the principal sources are rock-like ma- 
   
-P-A-G-E-344
    308 MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION 
terials, called ores, composed of compounds of the metals. It 
is from these ores that the metals are manufactured. 
Iron must be freed from its ore. Let us consider how 
iron, the most important of all metals, is obtained from its 
ores. After the iron ore is taken from the mine, it is shipped 
to the iron or steel mills. Here it is put through a process 
ealled smelting. This is carried out in a blast furnace (Figure 
  
     
    
Courtesy Colorado Fuel and Iron Company 
Fig. 289. Blast Furnaces 
One blast furnace is shown most clearly at the extreme right. You can 
see the small car on its way to the top of the furnace. It is filled with iron 
ore obtained from the huge pile of ore in the foreground. To the left of 
the blast furnace are large containers which heat the air before it enters 
the bottom of the furnace. Examine also Figure 290. 
289), which is a large steel tube lined with fire-brick. The ore 
is mixed with coke and limestone in proper amounts, as de- 
termined by the kind and quality of the ore used. This mix- 
ture is dropped into the furnace as shown in Figure 289. 
Hot air enters the furnace near the bottom and keeps the 
coke burning in the lower part of the furnace. As the coke 
burns, the limestone is heated and changes to lime and carbon
-P-A-G-E-345
  309 METAL AND ITS USES 
dioxide. (See page 304.) The lime left from the decomposed 
limestone combines with the melted rock-like impurities in the 
ore to form a liquid called slag. At the same time the iron is 
freed from the ore. It is melted by the great heat, and, being 
heavier than the slag, 
sinks to the bottom of 
the furnace. Through the 
openings at the side (Fig- 
ure 290) the slag and iron 
are drawn off from time 
to time. The slag be- 
comes hard when cool 
and is used to manufac- 
ture cement and fertili- 
zers. The iron is drawn 
off into molds, where it 
hardens and forms pig 
iron. Pig iron contains 
many impurities which 
must be removed before 
it can be used for mak- 
ing steel. If you are 
interested to know how 
steel and malleable iron 
are made, how tools are 
made of steel, and other 
interesting things about 
iron and steel, read about 
them in the references for

-P-A-G-E-346
  310 MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION 
kind of compound in which the metals are found in the earth. 
For example, lead, copper, zinc, and mercury are found in 
combination with sulphur. To get any one of these metals 
from its ore, it is necessary to roast or heat the ore in the pres- 
ence of oxygen. The oxygen burns away all or a part of the 
sulphur and combines with the metal, forming an oxide of the 
metal. The oxide can then be heated with coke or some other 
material which will remove the oxygen and leave the metal 
free. Other metals, like silver and aluminum, are separated 
from their ores by the use of electricity.

THE STORY OF UNIT XI 
In Unit X the present age was called ‘the metal age,” but 
it might just as well be called “the age of machinery,” for 
there is little work which man does today without the use of 
some device or machine. Few machines now used were known 
before the nineteenth century. As new materials for construc- 
tion, such as the metals, were discovered, many new machines 
could be made. The number and variety have become so great 
that we depend upon them every hour of the day. 
Everywhere, in homes, on the streets, in the fields, and in 
the offices and factories, man saves his strength and time 
through the use of simple devices. He has learned to make use

or lift some material. Though we use machines of different 
varieties to aid us in both kinds of work mentioned, we shall 
consider here only physical work and the devices used by man 
to do such physical work. 
To the scientist the term work means exerting a force 
through a distance; that is, the force must move something, 
or no work is done. This force may be your own physical

you do more work than 
when you lift a 25-pound 
sack of sugar the same 
height, or when you lift a 
50-pound sack to a stand 
one foot high. As another 
example, a man weighing 
250 pounds does more work 
in climbing stairs 50 feet 
high than in climbing 
stairs only 10 feet high. 
Similarly, more work is done 
than by a 75-pound boy who If by pulling, pushing, or lift- 
ing, you succeed in moving 
an object, you do work. You 
would not, however, do work 
in lifting, pulling, or pushing on 
a house, an automobile, or other 
large object which you could 
not move. You would not, in 
these cases, accomplish any- 
thing; that is, you would not 
move the object through a cer- 
tain distance. This gives you a 
new meaning of the word work. 
The amount of work which 
you do depends upon the force 
which is used and the distance 
through which the force is ex- 
erted. For example, if you lift 
a 50-pound sack of sugar from 
the floor to a table 3 feet high,

you see that the force used and the distance through which 
the force acts determine the amount of work done. 
You might think that the speed with 
which you move an object determines how 
much work is done. This is not true. 
Whether the 250-pound man runs up the 
stairs or walks up slowly makes no differ- 
ence in the amount of work done. It may 
make him more tired to run up the stairs, 
but he accomplishes exactly the same work 
in either case: he lifts 250 pounds to a height 
of 50 feet. The rate of doing work does 
not determine the amount of work done. 
It is to do work, that is, to exert a force 
through a distance in order to move an 
object, that machines are used. These 
devices help you in various ways. Besides 
saving your strength and time, machines

you may use a block and tackle 
(Figure 294), and by means of a small force lift the heavy 
barrel. Second, some machines allow you to use a large force 
to move a light object through a greater distance than the force 
is moved (Figure 295).

  316 MACHINES FOR DOING WORK 
Third, machines allow you to exert a force in one direction 
and move an object in another direction. For example, with a 
crowbar or pry-pole you can push downward on one end to move 
a weight upward with the other end. (See Figure 310, page 
328.) Or you can, by a pulley arrangement (Figure 296) pull in 
any one of several different directions to move the box upward. 
The forces used to operate these 
machines are many. In early times 
man used his own strength. Later, the 
strength of oxen and horses was of 
great assistance to him. Still later, as 
he discovered simple machines of 
different kinds, wind and water were 
harnessed to run his windmills and 
water wheels. In modern times steam, 
electricity, and the explosive force of 
gas provide forces which have com- 
pletely changed his way of doing work.

  PROBLEM 1: WHAT IS A MACHINE? 
Let us now get a clear idea of what a machine is and of 
the different kinds that are commonly used. Ordinarily you 
think of a machine as a complicated sort of thing like an 
automobile, a sewing machine, a reaper, or a washing machine. 
These are machines, but they are combinations of several 
different kinds of simple machines. Let us see what a simple 
machine is and how it works
-P-A-G-E-353
  WHAT IS A MACHINE? 317 
There are several types of simple machines. The most 
commonly used machines are found in your body. When 
you walk or run, sit down or get up, or lift, push, or pull an 
object, you do work by using the machines 
in the body. Like the sewing machine or 
locomotive, the human body contains many 
simple machines. Figure 297 shows, for 
example, one of the simple machines of 
the body. The muscle contracts and pulls 
up on the fore-arm, while the elbow does 
not move. The result is that the hand 
and the weight are lifted. Such a simple ihe sibesasteies 
machine is called a lever. Various arrange- a hinge; the muscle } shortens and pulls ments of the lever are used, as shown in the hand upward. 
Figure 314, page 331. 
A second type of simple machine is that shown in Figure 
298. Here, by turning the handle or wheel around as shown 
by the broken line, the heavy 
weight is slowly moved up- 
ward asthe rope wrapsaround 
the axle. Only a small force is 
necessary to move the handle, 
but a weight many times as 
great as the force (measured 
in pounds) is lifted. Any 
machine like this is called a 
wheel and azle. It might just

of a crank. The rope is wrapped on ghows several forms of this 
an axle attached to the wheel. Do you 
now see why this is called a wheel type. - 
and axle? A third example of a simple 
machine is seen in the plank 
with which a man is able to raise a heavy barrel into a wagon 
(Figure 293). Without the plank the man could not lift 
the barrel. With the machine he is able to roll the heavy

  318 MACHINES FOR DOING WORK 
object up the plank and place it in the wagon. The force 
in pounds necessary to push it along the inclined plank is 
far less than the weight of the barrel. This kind of machine 
  Fig. 299. 
A Jack-Screw 
As the handle turns 
away from you, the 
screw moves upward. is called an inclined plane. Screws of all 
kinds, such as the jack-screw shown in 
Figure 299, belong to this class of machines. 
By turning the handle of the jack-screw, a 
weight resting on top of the screw can be 
moved upward. Only a small force is 
needed to turn the handle, even if the weight 
lifted is alarge one. The inset in Figure 299, 
which illustrates a triangular piece of paper 
wrapped around a rod or pencil, makes it 
clear that the screw is nothing more than 
a circular inclined plane. Similarly, the grade of a road wind- 
ing up a mountain is an inclined plane which allows heavy 
loads to be raised to higher levels by the use of a small force. 
(See Figure 353, page 364.) 
A fourth kind of simple 
machine is the pulley. Figure 
300 shows two different uses of 
pulleys. The arrangement at 
the left makes it possible for the 
man to pull in one direction and 
move the weight in the opposite 
direction. The force necessary, 
however, is a little greater than 
the weight, because of the fric- 
tion of the pulley. The arrange- 
ment at the right requires only 
about one-half as much force as 
the weight lifted, but the force 
must move twice as far. Why?   
      
  Fig. 300. A Fixed and a Movable 
Pulley 
How far will the weight at the 
left be lifted if the hand moves 
downward one foot? How far will 
the weight at the right be lifted if 
the hand moves upward one foot? 
A fifth very common simple machine is the wedge (Figure 
301). Axes, picks, knives, plows, chisels, your front teeth, 
saws, and wedges for splitting wood are but a few examples. 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
    
WHAT IS A MACHINE? 319 
All of these are used to overcome the force which holds dif- 
ferent materials together. By means of a wedge it is possible 
for a small force to overcome a very great resistance. The 
force must, however, be exerted through a greater distance 
than that through which the resistance is moved. Thus, in 
Figure 301 suppose that the wedge is 2 inches thick at the top 
and 12 inches long. In order to spread the wood of the log 
  Fig. 301. Wedges in Daily Use 
Try to name the eight machines shown in this figure. 
2 inches, the force must be exerted through a distance of 
12 inches, or six times as far as the wood is separated. Thus 
you see that a small force on the wedge can overcome the 
great resistance of the wood. 
A sixth type of machine, which seems to be much different 
from those mentioned above, makes use of centrifugal force. 
Thus the stone in a sling has great force when the sling is 
whirled rapidly. The cream separator, for example, is a 
machine which makes use of this force caused by turning the 
crank. Water is pumped by centrifugal pumps in a similar 
way. Such machines are called centrifugal machines. A ma- 
chine of this kind is shown in Figure 339, page 353. 
   
-P-A-G-E-356
    320 MACHINES FOR DOING WORK 
Machines do not save work. You can see from the few 
examples mentioned that many simple machines are used to 
do work in the home, in the factory, and on the farm. They 
do not, however, as one commonly hears, “save work.” The 
amount of work needed to make a machine operate is, because 
of friction, always greater than the work which the machine 
does. Why, then, are they used? The answer to this question 
will explain what a machine is, and may be stated as follows: 
A machine is a device which uses energy to do work more effec- 
tively than it can be done without such device. 
The force which is used to operate a machine may be 
human or animal strength, or the energy of air, water, steam, 
electricity, light, or heat. In all cases the energy used on 
the machine must cause the machine to move some object 
by lifting, pulling, or pushing it, that is, by overcoming the 
resistance which tends to keep it from moving. The resistance 
may be due to the weight of the object caused by the attraction 
of the earth, or gravity, to friction between the object and 
the material on which the object rests, or to the force which 
holds parts of the same material together. Thus, when you 
use a machine to lift an object, that is, move it to a higher 
level, the work done results in raising the object against the 
pull of gravity; when you pull or push an object by the use 
of a machine, you must put force of some kind into the ma- 
chine so that the machine will overcome the friction between 
the object and the material on which it moves; when you use 
a machine to separate materials, as in the case of a wedge 
used to split wood or of a hammer used to pull a nail, you 
must exert a force on the machine, and the machine will then 
overcome the resistance of the materials to be separated. A 
machine does not save work. 
Exercise 1. From your study of the paragraphs above and from 
your own experiences with different kinds of machines make a list of 
the various machines which you know, grouping them under the 
following heads: (a) lever, (6) pulley, (c) inclined planes, (d) wheels 
and axles, or cranks, (e) wedges, (f) centrifugal machines.

HOW CAN YOU MEASURE WORK? 321 
Exercise 2. The principal reasons for using machines are given 
below. Copy these, and under each, name several common machines 
which illustrate each use. Give, following the name of the machine, 
a particular everyday use, as shown in the example under reason 1. 
(1) To move an object or overcome a resistance by using a force in 
a direction different from the direction in which the object is to be 
moved: 
Example: Crowbar (lever)—to raise a stone by pushing downward 
on the opposite end of the crowbar. 
(2) To lift a large weight by the use of a small force: 
(3) To overcome a great resistance by use of a smaller force: 
(4) To move a small weight through a great distance by using a 
large force through a small distance: 
(5) To move an object more rapidly than the speed of the force 
which is used to operate the machine. 
PROBLEM 2: HOW CAN YOU MEASURE WORK? 
Every machine is used to do work. If, therefore, you wish 
to know how much work is done, you must have some way of 
measuring it. Just as you use the inch, foot, yard, or mile 
as a unit to measure distance or length, so you must have a 
unit for the measurement of work. 
Work may be measured in different units. You know that 
the amount of work done by a machine depends upon the force 
exerted and the distance through which the object is moved. 
Work, you see, includes two factors: force and distance. 
The unit of work must, therefore, be a combination of a unit 
of force and a unit of distance. 
Now there are two different systems of measuring force 
and distance. The English system, which is commonly used 
in our country and in Great Britain, measures force in ounces, 
pounds, or tons, and distance in inches, feet, yards, rods, or 
miles. The metric system, used in most countries and by 
scientists in all countries, measures force in grams or kilograms 
and distance in millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. 
The metric system is the simpler of the two. It is often called 
the decimal system, because each unit is multiplied by ten

to get the next larger unit. This makes the system an easy one 
in which to calculate. Table XII and Figures 302 and 303 
show a few comparisons of the two systems. These will prove 
useful to you in calculation. 
You may use either the metric 
or the English system to measure 
work, but you must be careful not 
to measure force in 
one system and dis- 
i6~m tance in the other.

English system is 
the foot-pound; in 
the metric system 
it is the centimeter-gram. Thus, if you move or lift an object 
one foot with a pull or push of one pound, you do one foot-pound 
of work (Figure 304). Similarly, if you move or lift an object    Fig. 302. English and Metric Weights

PROBLEM 3: HOW DO MACHINES WORK? 
The number of different machines is so great that we shall 
consider only a few of the simpler types. Since the principle 
upon which all machines work is the same, let us see what 
this principle is by considering the inclined plane, the lever, 
the pulley, and the wheel and 
axle. If you understand 
these, you can explain any 
kind of simple machine. 
The inclined plane shows 
the machine principle. Per- 
haps the inclined plane is more 
easily understood than any 
Fig. 305. Sliding Friction other machine. 
  Experiment 71: How does an inclined plane work? 
(a) Get a smooth board a foot wide and eight feet long. Support 
one end of the board two feet above the table, allowing the other end 
to rest on the table. Provide also a small toy wagon or two sets of 
small wheels, a box, and some 
iron weights or stones. Place the 
weights or stones in the box and 
weigh the box and contents. Also 
weigh the wagon or wheels. At- 
tach a string or cord to the box 
and place it at the lower end of 
* the board. Put the wagon or 
wheels in the box. With a spring 
balance slowly pull the box and 
contents up the board (Figure 
305). Read the balance while you are pulling the load. Record the 
total weight of the load which you obtained by weighing box, 
wheels, and weights, and also the force necessary to move the load 
up the inclined plane. 
(b) Now place the wheels or wagon under the box (Figure 306) and 
again pull the load up the plane, reading the balance. Record the 
force which is required.

  HOW DO MACHINES WORK? 325 
Exercise 6. In both parts of Experiment 71 you see that the same 
weight or load was moved up the plane. What was the weight lifted? 
How high was it lifted? What force was required in part (a)? In part 
(b)? How much work was done by you in part (a)? How much use- 
ful work did the machine do? How much work did you do in part 
(6)? How much work did the machine do? What is the advantage 
of using such a machine? Write a report on the experiment, answer- 
ing these questions as a part of your report. 
  Fig. 307. Inclined Planes 
Each of these machines is an inclined plane of the screw type. Com- 
pare these with the ones in Figure 299. 
The inclined plane has a mechanical advantage. Experi- 
ment 71 shows that the inclined plane allows you to lift a heavy 
object with a small force, but that you must move the force 
through a greater distance than the weight is lifted. If there 
were no friction, it would require a force only one-fourth as 
great as the weight, for the distance through which the force 
acts is four times as great as the distance the weight is lifted. 
Such a machine would have a mechanical advantage of four, 
because the weight is four times as great as the force required 
to lift it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
    326 MACHINES FOR DOING WORK 
The efficiency of machines varies. The work which you 
put into the machine in part (a) of Experiment 71 is much 
greater than the work which the machine does for you. You 
exerted a certain pull through a distance of 8 feet to lift a 
certain weight 2 feet. If you divide the work out (2 feet times 
the weight of the load) by the work in (8 feet times the pull 
necessary to draw the load) and express the quotient in per 
cent, you have the percentage efficiency of the machine used in 
part (a). 
Exercise 7. What is the efficiency of the machine used in part 
(a) of Experiment 71? 
Exercise 8. What is the efficiency of the machine used in part (6)? 
No machine is one hundred per cent efficient. There is 
always some friction in every machine. The “work in” must 
be more than the “work out”’ because the ‘work in’? must over- 
come the friction as well as move the object. If there were no 
friction in the machine, the weight times the distance which 
it is lifted would equal the force times the distance it moves. 
This is the principle of every machine. It is easy to remember 
as the scientist states it: F times d; equals W times d,. (dy 
means the distance which the force moves; d, means the dis- 
tance which the weight is lifted.) 
Exercise 9. Make a list of ways not mentioned in the text in which 
inclined planes can be used. (See Figure 307 for suggestions.) 
Exercise 10. In order to get an automobile weighing 3200 pounds 
into a railroad car which is 4 feet above the ground, the automobile 
is pulled up two inclined planks 20 feet long. The force required 
is 1000 pounds. What is the “workin”? What is the “work out’? 
What is the efficiency? The actual mechanical advantage of the 
inclined plane is 3.2. If friction were neglected, it would be 5. 
Explain why these statements are true. 
The lever is much like the inclined plane. A Greek scientist 
once said that if he had a pole long enough and strong enough 
and a place to rest it, he could lift the earth. He had just 
discovered how to use a lever. Since his time many different 
kinds of levers have been used.

Experiment 72: How does a lever work? 
Balance a meterstick or a yardstick above a table by means of 
a string attached at the middle (Figure 308). Hang a large weight 
on the stick a few inches from the support. -On the other side of the 
support, or fulcrum, hang a known weight, which is only about one- 
fifth as great as the large weight, at such point on the stick that 
the small weight just causes the balance to tip, lifting the larger 
weight. Bring the balance to a hori- 
zontal position and measure the dis- 
tance of the weights above the table. Fu. 
Now allow the balance to tip until the 
small weight just touches the table. 
If the small weight is considered the Fig. 308 
force, how far did the force move? 
How far was the weight (the larger weight) lifted? What was 
the “work in’? The “work out”? What advantage has such a 
machine? What is the mechanical advantage of the machine? 
Shift the large weight to another position and repeat the entire 
experiment, answering the same questions for the second trial.

In every lever of the first class the force is applied at one 
side of the fulcrum, and the object lifted or the resistance over-

come is on the opposite side. Many common devices belong 
to this class, such as the tack-puller, shears, pliers, pry-pole, 
teeter-totter, and boat oars. When the dis- 
tance. between the force and the fulcrum is 
greater than the distance between the weight 
or the resistance 
and the fulcrum, 
the mechanicalad- 
vantage of the 
lever is more than 
Fig. 310. A Pry-Pole—A First-Class Lever one. This is true 
A second man places a block under the log because the force 
Pa is exerted through 
a greater distance than the weight or resistance is moved. 
Thus a long pry-pole (Figure 310) has a great mechanical 
advantage. When the weight and force are at the same 
distance from the fulcrum, the mechanical advantage is one, as 
in a balance (Figure 311). In cases where the force is closer

to the weight or resistance, as in the case of boat oars, the 
mechanical advantage is less than one. 
In second-class levers, such as the wheelbarrow and the

always more than one. The force always moves through a 
greater distance than the weight moves. The force is, there- 
fore, always less than the weight or resistance, unless the 
friction happens to be very great.

Third-class levers always have a mechanical advantage of 
less than one. The force must always be greater than the weight

third-class levers can

They make it possible

Exercise 12. A man has a pry-pole 10 feet long (Figure 310). He 
uses it as a first-class lever to lift a log, one end of which weighs 1000 
pounds. The fulcrum is one foot from the end under the log. Ex- 
plain how you determine what force he must exert to raise the log. 
Bear in mind that the log is lifted only one-ninth 
as far as the force is exerted, because the distance 
* from the fulcrum to the force is nine times as 
great as the distance from the log to the fulcrum. 
Exercise 13. To which class does each of the 
levers in Figure 316 belong? Why? List each 
device, and opposite it state whether it is a lever 
of the first class, second class, or third class. 
Pulleys are useful machines. You have 
seen combinations of pulleys used to lift 
objects, to pull boats out of the water, to 
operate cranes and derricks, and to move 
machinery. The simplest pulley is a fixed 
pulley (Figure 314). Its only advantage is 
to change the direction of the force, but even 
this is of great importance. You can, for 
example, lift an object to an upper story of 
a building by means of a pulley and a rope. 
You can use your weight to pull downward, 
moving the object upward. The force is practically equal to the 
weight, and one moves as far as the other. Why? If there 
were no friction, the force and the weight would be equal.

Experiment 73: How can different sys-

or resistance, you see that they are equal 
and move the same distance. If you wish to move the weight, it is 
necessary to add more force to overcome the friction.

a spring balance. Weigh the weight and pulley. Now lift the weight

and pulley by pulling upward on the balance, and read the balance 
as you move it upward. See how far the weight is lifted by moving 
the balance one foot. How does the relation of these distances com- 
pare with the number of strands of rope which support the pulley 
to which the weight is attached? What is the advantage of such an 
arrangement? Calculate the mechanical advantage and the efficiency 
of the machine. 
(c) Set up a four-strand pulley system as shown at the right in 
Figure 315. This is commonly called a block and tackle. Experiment 
with this as you did with the two-strand system. 
    
  
  Fig. 317. Different Pulley Systems 
In the systems which have two, four, and six strands supporting the 
movable pulley and the attached weight, is the tied end of the rope 
fastened to the movable or fixed pulley? 
Exercise 14. Why is a single fixed pulley ever used if it has a 
mechanical advantage of only one? 
Exercise 15. Draw the following systems of pulleys: 3-strand, 
4-strand, 5-strand, 6-strand, 7-strand. (See Figure 317 for help.) 
Exercise 16. The mechanical advantage of a set of pulleys is 
equal to the number of strands supporting the movable pulley, fric- 
tion neglected. Why is this true? Give the mechanical advantage 
of each system shown in Figure 317. 
The wheel and axle is very common. The wheel and axle 
is one of the oldest of the simple machines used by man. It 
finds a great variety of uses in the form of such machines as 
cranks of automobiles, coffee grinders, egg beaters, clothes 
wringers, and churns (Figure 320). The windlass (Figure 318) 
and the capstan (Figure 319) are wheels and axles used to pull 
heavy loads.
-P-A-G-E-369
  HOW DO MACHINES WORK? 333 
By examining Figure 319 you can see how the wheel and 
axle works. As the force moves the handle once around, the 
weight is moved by a distance equal to the circumference of 
the axle. Since the force moves much farther than the weight 
does, you see that a small force can move a large weight. 
The circumference of a circle is 22 times as great as its 
diameter. If the wheel has a diameter of 28 inches and the

axle has a diameter of 7 inches, how far does the force move in 
making one turn of the wheel? How far is the weight moved? 
How do these distances compare? Note that the comparison, 
or ratio, is the same as the ratio of the diameters of the wheel 
and the axle. 
When the diameter of the wheel is greater than the diam- 
eter of the axle, the mechanical advantage of the machine is 
greater than one, and the force must move farther than the 
weight is lifted. Neglecting friction, the mechanical advantage 
can always be obtained by dividing the diameter of the wheel 
by the diameter of the axle, or by dividing the radius of the 
wheel or the length of the crank by the radius of the axle.
-P-A-G-E-370
    334 MACHINES FOR DOING WORK 
Another form of the wheel and axle is seen in a system of 
pulleys connected by belts, as shown in Figure 321. Such an 
arrangement is often used to transmit the force of one machine 
to another part of the machine or to a second machine. These 
pulleys are belt pulleys and are not like the ones previously 
  Fig. 320. Wheels and Axles in Daily Use 
Name the seven wheel-and-axle machines shown in this figure. 
described. The pulleys marked P, P’, and P” are attached to 
engines and are known as the power pulleys. Those marked 
M, M’, and M” are attached to machines which are to be 
operated by the engines. 
If the pulleys are of the same size, they will turn at the 
same speed. The only advantage here is that the force can be 
transmitted to another machine some distance from the source 
of power. The belt may be twisted, of course, as in the middle 
drawing of Figure 321, in order to change the direction in 
which the second pulley runs. If the pulley on the engine is 
larger than the one attached to the machine, the machine 
pulley must make more revolutions than the engine, or power, 
pulley. Similarly, if the diameter of the engine pulley is only 
one-third the diameter of the machine pulley, the speed of the 
second pulley will be only one-third that of the first. By 
changing the sizes of the pulleys any desired speed of the
-P-A-G-E-371
  HOW DO MACHINES WORK? 335 
second pulley may be obtained. You sce that this is really a 
wheel and axle used to govern the speed of a machine. 
A very common form of the wheel and axle is the gear, 
which serves the same pur- 
pose as the belt pulleys just 
described. Years ago the force 
of a machine was transmitted 
to another part of the ma- 
chine, or to another machine, 
by means of two smooth cyl- 
inders placed against each 
other. The friction between 
these caused the second one 
to turn when the first was re- 
volved. Because they slipped

machine to be operated. The belts . 
transmit the power. Since these notches soon wore 
off, another improvement was 
made. Teeth were cut into the wheel or pulley, making what 
we now know as gear wheels. 
Gear wheels are used in a great many simple devices, as 
well as in most complex machines. If you examine Figure 318, 
you will find a small gear attached to the shaft of the wheel. 
This gear fits into a larger one on the axle. By such arrange- 
ment the force from the handles jis transmitted to the axle. 
In the egg beater (Figure 320) and in the wheel jack (Figure 
314), you find other simple machines which make use of 
gears to transmit the force. In more complex machines, like 
an automobile or a grain binder, many gears may be found. 
  Exercise 17, Examine various machines which have gears and 
answer the following questions: (a) Why are not machines made 
with a single gear wheel? (b) Why must the notches, or cogs, 
of two gear wheels like those in Figure 318 be of the same 
size?
-P-A-G-E-372
  336 MACHINES FOR DOING WORK 
Figure 322 shows how belt pulleys, gears, and gear chains 
may be used to transmit power. In the figure the large gear 
(A) is driving the small gear (B). Since there are four times as 
many cogs on the large wheel as on the small wheel, the small 
wheel will turn around four times while the large one goes

around once. Since the teeth on two gear wheels which fit 
together must be of the same size, it is easy to see that the 
diameter of the wheels gives us the relative speed of the gears, 
and, therefore, the relative speed of the two parts of the ma- 
chine to which the gears are attached. The common forms or 
types of the gears are the spur gear, the bevel gear, and the 
worm gear (Figure 323).

PROBLEM 4: HOW CAN MACHINES BE MADE MORE 
EFFICIENT? 
Machines do not save work. We use them because of other 
advantages, such as changing direction of a force, increasing 
the distance and speed at the expense of greater force, and 
increasing force at the expense of speed and distance. There 
is no machine which gives us something for nothing; there is 
no perpetual-motion machine; there is no possibility of getting 
as much out of a machine as we put into it. 
Friction decreases efficiency. In the experiment with the 
inclined plane (page 324), you found that the wheels or wagon 
increased the efficiency of the machine. Let us see why. 
Experiment 74: How can 
friction be reduced?

| (c) Place the box containing the weights and wheels on small shot

| Exercise 22. Record your results. State your conclusions. 
The forces required in parts (6) and (c) of Experiment 74 
are far less than that required in part (a). In part (a) the 
box slides along the 
table. Neither the 
table nor the bottom 
of the box is entirely 
smooth; so the par- 
ticles of both offer 
a resistance to the 
motion. The sur- 
face between table 
and box is very large; 
therefore the sliding 
friction is great. 
Friction can be re- 
duced. You see that 
machines can _ be 
made more efficient

—it is a more effi- 
cient machine—if the beam rests on a knife edge instead of on 
a large rough surface. The smaller the surface between two 
moving parts of any machine, or between one moving part and 
one stationary part, the less is the friction. Friction can be 
reduced by making the sliding friction as little as possible. 
Another way, as you have seen, is to substitute rolling friction 
for sliding friction. This can be done by using wheels and ball 
bearings or roller bearings (Figure 325). If these bearings are

SOURCE OF ALL FORCES 339 
kept well oiled, or lubricated, the machine becomes still more 
efficient. 
You must keep in mind, however, that friction is very 
necessary. If there were no friction or too little friction 
between the engine wheels and the railroad track, for example, 
the engine could not move. The wheels would spin around 
without moving forward or backward. Or if there were no 
friction between your shoes and the floor, you could not move 
unless someone pushed you or you had a way of pulling your- 
self along. And if you once got started, you could not stop. 
Exercise 23. What disadvantages of friction can you name? What 
advantages? 
Exercise 24. Oiling a machine makes it more efficient. Explain why. 
PROBLEM 5: WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF ALL FORCES 
USED WITH MACHINES? 
All forces come from the sun. We have considered so many 
different forces that it does not seem possible that all of these 
can come from the same source. Yet every one of them can 
be traced back to the sun. It is the energy from the sun that 
gives us the force which we can exert with our muscles, the 
force exerted by animals in pulling and pushing, and the 
force of wind, water, steam, explosions, and electricity. These 
forces are all a part of the energy, or ability to do work, which 
the different materials possess. Let us see how these various 
forms of energy come from the sun. 
Your muscular energy comes from the food you eat. As 
you expend some of your energy by exerting a force, you must, 
from time to time, take food. This food undergoes chemical 
changes and produces new compounds which build up new 
tissues in the body. These oxidize when you breathe and 
generate the heat of the body and the muscular energy to do 
work. (See page 85.) Now the food which you eat comes from 
plants, or from animals which feed on plants, and plants re- 
quire sunshine to grow and to produce the food. (See page 80.) 
Without sunshine, then, you could not have energy, and could
-P-A-G-E-376
340 MACHINES FOR DOING WORK 
dono work. The strength or energy of all animals can be traced 
to the sun in the same way. 
It is very easy also to trace to the sun the force of falling 
or running water. The heat from the sun evaporates the water 
from the surface of the earth. As it is cooled and condensed 
by changes in weather, it falls as rain or snow. (See page 47.) 
The rain or melted snow then runs down streams. The run- 
ning water possesses energy which may be used to run water 
wheels. It may fall over dams or water-falls and turn turbines. 
  
  
  
    
  
      
Fig. 326. Transformation of Energy 
Can you trace the changes in energy from the coal pile under the boiler, 
to the steam engine, to the dynamo, to the lights, etc., in the house? 
In either case it gets its energy from the sun, which caused the 
water to evaporate from lake, stream, or ocean, and to rise to 
higher levels. 
Another source of energy, which we use in many machines, 
is steam. Steam is made by heating water. The water, let 
us say, is heated by wood or coal. As the wood or coal burns, 
the chemical energy of its elements is changed to heat. (See 
page 237.) But wood and coal both come from plants, which 
could grow only when the sun gave them the necessary energy 
to manufacture the compounds of which they are made. And 
so the energy of the sun makes it possible for us to have the 
force of steam to pull our trains and run machinery. 
One kind of energy can be converted into another. The 
energy of the sun may change to chemical energy in the tree, 
the chemical energy changes to heat or light when the wood 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
  EXERCISES AND PROJECTS ON UNIT XI 341 
burns (see page 237), the heat may produce steam, the steam 
may run a dynamo and produce electricity, the electricity may 
be changed to heat or light. This transformation of one kind 
of energy to another is certainly one of the wonders of nature 
(Figure 326). Energy can be changed to another form, but 
it can never be destroyed. There is always the same amount 
of energy in the world. 
Exercise 25. Summarize Problem 4 and all cross references in the 
form of statements which tell how one form of energy may be changed 
into another, thus: 
1. Radiant energy from the sun is changed to heat when it is ab-

2. Electric energy is changed to light in an electric-light bulb.

THE STORY OF UNIT XII 
As man discovered simple machines and learned to combine 
them into more complicated machines, he sought ways to save 
his own strength through the use of other forces which nature 
had provided for him. Among these forces, other than his 
strength and the strength of animals, are those of air and 
water. Man has found various ways of using the energy which 
these materials possess and has made many devices which put 
these forces to work. As a result we have today diving bells, 
sailboats, windmills, vacuum-cleaners, air and water pumps, 
343

_ siphons, water wheels, turbines, air-brakes, hydraulic presses, 
hydraulic elevators, and a score of other labor-saving de- 
vices. 
You recall that air occupies space, that it exerts pressure, 
and that it is compressible. These characteristics of air are 
made use of todo work. Air is forced

The pressure of air is useful in water 
pumps, self-filling fountain pens, 
medicine droppers, vacuum-cleaners, 
the siphon, and other devices (Figure 
eaalepnoner, 329). The compressibility of air and 
the outward force of compressed air 
serve us in inflating automobile tires, 
foot-balls, and basket-balls, and in the 
operation of such machines as water 
pumps, air-brakes, and compressed-air 
engines. 
Water, though not compressible, 
does exert a pressure because of its 
weight. The pressure therefore de-

used to drive machinery if the water 
strikes against a water wheel or turbine (Figures 345 and 330). 
It may fall upon a paddle wheel, or may be allowed to strike 
the paddles or vanes of a turbine. In either case the energy 
which the water has at the top of the falls may be utilized to 
do work. 
Another way in which water is of help to us depends upon 
the facts that water is a non-compressible liquid and is free to 
move in all directions. For example, in a hydraulic press Air Pipe.

pressure may be exerted on a piston in a small cylinder by 
means of alever. This pressure forces water into a large tank 
  Fig. 329. Air-Pressure Devices 
These simple practical devices all operate by air pressure. 
Number 4 is a watering device for chickens. Number 5 is a pres- 
sure gauge for automobile tires. What are the others? 
into which is fitted a cylinder of greater diameter, thus push- 
ing upward on the large cylinder. As you shall see later, the 
force upward on the piston of 
the large cylinder is many times 
greater than the force exerted 
on the small piston. This makes 
it possible to use water as a 
means by which force may be 
transferred from one place to 
another and be multiplied many 
times (Figure 351, page 362). 
Since air and water have 
weight, they can exert a force 
when in motion. Moving air 
may run a windmill, which 
works for man by pumping wa- 
ter or by running other ma- 
  Fig. 330. A Water Turbine 
Before the turbine was installed, 
the water wheel was used. You can

chines (Figure 331). Running water may turn a paddle wheel 
and thus help to grind grain, saw wood, or generate electric- 
ity. As the air strikes the vanes of a windmill, or running 
water strikes the vanes of a water'wheel, the force exerted turns 
the wheel, and this foree may be 
transmitted to other machinery by 
means of belts or gears. Great im- 
provements have been made in the 
kind of machines used to harness 
the energy of moving air and water, 
but the force used is still the force 
of moving material. And it is in- 
teresting to know that man used 
the simple water wheel for nearly 
2000 years before he discovered the 
modern methods of utilizing water 
power.

in a mountain stream, the force is great enough to carry you 
off your feet. If the stream is large and moves rapidly, the 
force is tremendous. If you have been unfortunate enough to 
be in the path of a stream of water coming from a large fire 
hose, you need no words to help you realize the great force of 
such a stream. It is evident that the energy of moving air or 
moving water depends upon the weight and speed of the air or 
the water.

THE STORY OF UNIT XII 347 
This brings you to a new idea or term of science, power, a 
word which you have often heard and have perhaps used in- 
correctly. It is common to speak of power when you really 
mean force. You recall that force times distance equals work; 
and that energy is the ability to do work. What meaning do 
scientists give to the term power? Power is not the same as 
force, work, or energy. Let us suppose that you climb a stair 
which is 50 feet high, your weight being 100 pounds. The 
force that is necessary to lift you is 100 pounds; the work 
that you do is 5000 foot-pounds; the energy used is 5000 foot- 
pounds. : 
Now you may take two minutes to climb the stairs, or you 
may require ten minutes. In either case you do the same 
work, but in the first case you do it five times as fast. The 
rate of work in the two cases is different. It is this rate of 
doing work which scientists call power. In climbing the stair 
in two minutes you do 5000 foot-pounds of work in two 
minutes, or 2500 foot-pounds per minute. In the second case 
you do 5000 foot-pounds in ten minutes, or 500 foot-pounds 
per minute. Your power in the first case is five times as 
great as in the second. Similarly, water or air may, depending 
upon their speed and weight, do work at different rates. We 
say that the power depends upon the rate or speed with which 
the force is exerted, and we measure the rate of doing work in 
a new unit, called horse-power. Later you will understand by 
what method scientists have come to determine this unit and 
how it is used. 
You see, then, that air and water can save our strength; that 
air can be of use because it occupies space, exerts pressure, and 
is compressible; that the pressure of water may be utilized to 
do work; that the motion of air and water furnishes energy 
for man; that the speed of moving air and water determines 
the amount of energy which is available in a certain time, 
and that the rate of doing work, or the power of air and wa- 
-ter, depends upon the force and the speed with which the 
force is exerted.

  348 PUTTING AIR AND WATER TO WORK 
PROBLEM 1: HOW DOES AIR ENABLE MAN TO WORK 
UNDER WATER? 
In using diving bells or caissons for constructing foundations 
under water, or in building underground tunnels, it is necessary 
to have air for the workmen. This means that the water must 
be kept out by means of air. 
Air can be used to exclude water. You recall from Unit 
II that air is material. (See page 54.) 
Experiment 75: How can air displace water from a container? 
(a) Lower a tumbler, mouth downward, into a large vessel of 
water. Note that as the tumbler is forced down, the water rises 
into the tumbler but a small distance. How 
do you explain what you see? (See page 55.) 
(b) Lower a large funnel fitted with a rub- 
ber tube into a jar of water (Figure 332). 
Does water fill the funnel? Why? Blow into 
      
       
   
  * Wi the rubber tubing slowly and then withdraw 
iW your mouth. What happens during this proc- 
J ess, and how do you explain it? Again blow 
eal i pes until all the water is forced out of the funnel 
| iY and then pinch the rubber tubing. Does 
water enter the funnel? 
Fig. 332. Exercise 1. Write an explanation for each 
DisplacingWaterbyAit part of Experiment 75. 
When the diving bell, caisson, or tunnel is large and far 
under water, the pressure of the water is so great that it requires 
much force to keep the water out and to supply fresh air for 
the workmen. In order to force the air into the container 
where men work, compression pumps must be used. Figure 333 
shows how such a pump works. As the piston moves to the 
right, Valve B opens and Valve D closes. The air is forced 
through Valve B through the discharge pipe which leads to 
the bell, caisson, or tunnel. Then as the piston moves back 
(to the left), Valve B closes, and Valve D opens, allowing more 
air to enter through the intake pipe which leads to the outside
-P-A-G-E-385
  
WORKING UNDER WATER 349 
air. Valve C now closes and Valve A opens. Thus the out- 
side air is pumped into the container. 
To provide against danger resulting from the breakdown of 
the pump, the air is forced into large compressed-air tanks 
which are connected to the caisson or tunnel. These tanks 
have heavy walls, and air may be forced into them until the 
pressure reaches from 1000 to 2000 pounds per square inch.

Fig. 333. An Air Compression Pump 
The motor drives the flywheel which moves the piston rod and 
the attached piston back and forth. 
Should the pump cease to work for a time, there is no danger 
for the workmen, because the pressure in the tank will supply 
air until the pump is repaired or until the workmen can come 
out. Speaking tubes, electric bells, or telephones connect the 
workmen with the outside world. 
How men get into the diving bell or caisson. You have per- 
haps wondered how the workmen get into the bell, the caisson, 
or the tunnel. In the case of the bell, men enter before it is 
lowered into the water, and while it is being lowered, stay on 
the ledge built around the inside of the bell some distance 
above the bottom. The caisson and the tunnel are not so 
simple as the diving bell. In each of these are several com- 
partments with air-tight doors between them (Figure 334). 
Air is forced into each compartment until all water is driven out. 
The doors between the compartments are then closed. Then 
men enter the first compartment and close the outside door. 
 
-P-A-G-E-386
  350 PUTTING AIR AND WATER TO WORK 
Air is admitted slowly until the pressure in the first compart- 
ment is equal to that in the other parts of the tunnel or 
caisson. This requires 
some time, because a 
rapid change of the air 
pressure will injure the 
workmen. The door to 
the second compartment 
is now opened, and the 
men go in, closing the 
door behind them. This 
compartment may be the 
workshop. Fresh air is 
constantly supplied. 
As the men come out, 
they return to the first 
compartment and secure- 
ly close the trap-door 
behind them. The air 
pressure is now very 
slowly reduced by allow- 
ing air to escape. When 
the pressure is the same 
as that outside, they may 
safely come out. You see 
that the caisson is really

der-water tunnel in a

  USING ORDINARY AIR PRESSURE 351 
PROBLEM 2: HOW DOES ORDINARY AIR PRESSURE WORK FOR US? 
In addition to water pumps, which you studied in Unit IV, 
there are two other devices commonly used in the home which 
depend upon ordinary air pressure for their operation. The 
first is the s¢phon, used to transfer liquids from one place to 
another, and the second is the vacuwm-cleaner. 
How the siphon works. Did you ever use a rubber hose to 
get vinegar from a barrel, to take the water from a fish bowl, 
or to get gasoline from a tank? 
Experiment 76: How can you operate a siphon? 
Get a piece of rubber tubing several feet long. (A piece of garden 
hose may be used.) Lower one end of the tubing into a pail of water 
which stands on a table. Suck the air from the tubing until the water 
reaches your mouth. Why does the water fill the tubing? (See 
Experiment 10, page 55.) Pinch the end of the tubing air-tight, 
or place your finger over the end of the tubing without allowing air 
to enter, and bring this end into an empty pail on the floor. Open 
the end of the tube and observe that the water flows from it. Slowly 
raise the open end until it is almost at the level of the water in the 
pail on the table. How does the speed of flow change? Again lower 
the open end slowly. Does the rate of flow change? How? 
Experiment 77: What causes the water to flow from the siphon? 
Take a two-foot length of rubber tubing or a glass tube bent into a 
U shape, with each arm about one foot long. Fill the tube with 
water, keep your finger over one end, and 
invert the tube into two jars of water, as 
shown at the left in Figure 335. Remove 
your finger and raise one jar of water a few 
inches above the table. What happens? 
Replace the jar on the table. What happens? 
How do the lengths of the water columns 
in the two arms of the tube above the surface 
of the water in the jars compare when the siphon ceases to flow? 
Measure them. Note that when the water flows through the siphon, 
it flows toward the side having the longer arm above the surface of 
the water in the jar. In the siphon at the right (Figure 335), which is

which tube will the water, therefore, flow out first on account of 
the pull of gravity? If it flows out of one arm, what condition 
would result in the top part of the tube? 
How will the air pressure on the water in 
the left jar prevent such a condition? 
Exercise 3. Name as many uses of the 
siphon as you can. 
Exercise 4. Why do you suck the air out 
of the siphon to start it? 
Exercise 5. Why does the siphon continue

  : The vacuum-cleaner makes use of air pressure. One of the 
handiest devices around the home is the vacuum-cleaner. 
  Experiment 78: How can air pressure pick up light materials? 
Roll a large sheet of paper into a cylinder about half an inch in 
diameter. Place the cylinder over small pieces of paper, as in Fig- 
ure 336. Suck the 
air out of the paper 
tube by inhaling rap- 
idly. What happens 
to the small pieces of 
paper? From your 
study of air pressure 
explain why this hap- 
pens. (See page 55.) 
When some air is 
removed from a 
space, the remain- 
ing air becomes 
thinner and the 
pressure less. Such 
space is called a partial vacuum. The outside air is forced into 
such space by the surrounding air pressure. As the air rushes 
in, it carries along light materials like paper or dust, just as 
running water carries stones or sand.     Courtesy Hoover Co.

The important parts of the machines are labelled. Study the 
parts to understand the following explana- 
tion of the machine. As the electric motor 
rotates, it turns the fan. The fan pumps 
air into the dust bag. This produces a 
partial vacuum in the chamber around the 
fan, and the air from the outside rushes in, 
carrying with it the dust which has been 
loosened by the brush. The dust is then 
blown with the air into the dust bag. The 
air escapes through the fine mesh of the 
bag, but the dust is held.

FOR US? 
Compressed air serves us in many ways. 
pressed into a container, it exerts an outward pressure.

Fig. 340. 
A Pneumatic Water System 
The force pump forces water 
into the tank, compressing the air 
aboveit. This air then forces water 
through the pipes to the hot-water 
heater and the bath-room, or directly 
to the kitchen sink. (Pneumatic

  When air is com- 
You 
recall that the ordinary air 
pressure is about 15 pounds 
per square inch. Now, if two 
cubic feet of air are forced into 
a vessel having a space of one 
cubic foot, the air pressure in- 
side is 30 pounds per square 
inch; or if 10 cubic feet of air 
are forced into the vessel, the 
outward pressure of the com- 
pressed air is 150 pounds per 
square inch. You see, then, 
that compressed air may exert 
a great pressure. This pres- 
sure can be used in a number 
of ways. 
Perhaps the most common 
use of compressed air is for in- 
flating, or “blowing up,” auto- 
mobile tires. | Compression 
pumps, like that shown in Fig- 
ure 333, force air into heavy- 
walled tanks. Tubes with 
valves at the ends lead from 
these tanks. From these tubes we take the air to inflate our tires 
to a pressure of 40, 60, or 80 pounds.

At the same 
time it improves the riding qualities of the automobile. 
Other common uses of compressed air are found in com- 
pressed-air engines, in drills used in machine shops, mines, and 
stone quarries, in pneumatic riveters, and in forcing water from 
tanks to 2 rooms of houses (Figure 340).
-P-A-G-E-391
  USING COMPRESSED AIR 355 
The air-brake uses compressed air. Perhaps the most use- 
ful compressed-air device is the atr-brake for trolley cars and 
trains (Figure 341). On trains a compression pump on the 
engine forces air into a large tank or reservoir, keeping the air 
at a pressure of about 75 pounds per square inch. This reser- 
voir is connected by means of pipes and by air-tight couplings 
between cars to a smaller reservoir and the brakes under each 
shale conpucTor’s va.

car. While the pressure in the engine reservoir is at 75 pounds 
per square inch, the control valve is in such position that the 
two reservoirs are connected by the air-pipe. If the engineer 
opens the valve on the air-pipe connecting the engine reservoir 
to the car reservoir, if the couplings between cars become 
separated, or if the air-line is broken or cut, air escapes, and 
the pressure in the air-pipe becomes less. Whenever this 
happens, the pressure in the car reservoir turns the control 
valve in such a way that the compressed air enters the brake 
cylinder and forces the piston to the right with great force. 
The piston rod operates the brake levers, sets the brake shoes 
against the wheels, and stops the train. When the air is again 
turned on from the engine reservoir and the pipes are air-tight, 
the control valve turns so that the car reservoir is connected 
with the air-pipe, and the compressed air in the brake cylinder 
can escape. The heavy spring in the brake cylinder, which 
was compressed, now opens, pulling the piston rod back and 
releasing the brakes.

PROBLEM 4: HOW IS THE FORCE 
OF WIND HARNESSED? 
In country districts you often 
see a type of machine, the wind- 
mill (Figure 342), which utilizes 
the force of moving air to pump 
water and run machinery. The 
air strikes the wooden or steel 
blades, or vanes, of the wheel, 
causing the wheel to rotate just 
as a pinwheel (Figure 343) is 
made to turn by being blown upon 
or by the force of the air which 
rises over a warm radiator or

ward from each of the large gear wheels and is attached to the 
wheel at a point a few inches from the center. Such an arrange- 
ment is called an eccentric, meaning “off center.’”” Connected to 
the two short arms are two heavy eccentric rods, which extend 
upward and are held together by an arm across the top. The 
pump rod is attached to this arm, and, as the wheel turns, the 
piston rod of the pump is moved up and down (Figure 344).       
   
-P-A-G-E-393
  USING THE FORCE OF WIND ‘387 
The speed of the windmill depends upon the speed of the 
wind and upon the direction from which the wind strikes the 
blades. The pressure of a wind blowing at 30 miles an hour is 
about 5 pounds per square 
foot; at 50 miles an hour the 
pressure increases to about 15 
pounds per square foot. If 
there are 30 vanes on a wind- 
mill, each three feet long and 
one-half foot wide, and all of the 
force of a 30-mile wind could 
be utilized, the force would be 
3xX3X30X5, or 225 pounds. 
As a matter of fact, the wind 
does not strike directly against

PROBLEM 5: HOW IS WATER PUT TO WORK? 
The overshot water wheel was formerly much used. For 
hundreds of years the overshot water wheel was used to grind 
grain into flour and to saw wood. Even today in some parts of 
the country this device is found (Figure 345). A dam is 
built across a 
stream and the 
water is led 
through a wood- 
en or metal flume 
to the top of the 
wheel. The 
buckets or pad- 
dles of the wheel 
are turned by

grain grinder within the mill. A gate at the dam 
controls the flow of water through the flume. dles come to the 
bottom, they 
empty the water into the stream below and are carried upward 
by the weight of the water in the other buckets. Such a ma- 
chine, as you see, is really a wheel and axle. The “work in” is 
the product of the weight of the water and the distance which 
it moves while in the buckets. Some water is spilled, of 
course, but the source of energy is cheap, and the efficiency of 
the machine may be as high as 80 to 90 per cent. 
The turbine is more efficient than the water wheel. The 
turbine is a newer and more efficient device for harnessing the 
force of water at a dam. One kind of turbine is shown in 
Figure 346. The concrete dam is at the right. The water 
flows through the gate and enters the turbine below. Inside 
the turbine, stationary blades direct the water against the 
blades of the rotating part. The rotating part, or rotor, as it is 
called, turns the shaft to which it is attached. This shaft 
extends upward to the dynamo in the room above the turbine. 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  WATER WHEELS AND TURBINES 359 
There is so little waste of power in this type of turbine that 
the efficiency may be considerably above 90 per cent. 
Exercise 11. The turbine is more 
efficient than the overshot water 
wheel. Why? 
Undershot water wheels are 
also used. Anyone who has 
tried to wade a swift stream or 
who has been doused with wa- 
ter coming from a hose knows 
that the energy of running water 
depends upon the amount of 
water and the speed with which 
it moves. The earliest device 
for using the force of running 
water was probably the under- 
shot water wheel (Figure 347). 
This is commonly used in streams 
where there is a large amount of

water available. Much 
force is wasted in such an 
arrangement, for only the 
water which strikes the pad- 
dles or vanes can do work. 
As a result of this waste, 
most undershot wheels are 
only from 20 to 30 per cent 
efficient. 
One type of undershot 
wheel, however, is’ very 
efficient. This is the Pelion 
wheel (Figure 348), which is 
-used to a great extent in 
mountainous regions where 
the water can be brought from a place far above the wheel. 
The water is led down through a pipe ending in a nozzle,
-P-A-G-E-396
360 PUTTING AIR AND WATER TO WORK 
much like the nozzle on a garden hose, and strikes the cups 
at the end of the vanes. The water comes out of the nozzle 
at a high speed and drives the wheel very rapidly. Little 
force is wasted by this arrangement, and the efficiency of the 
wheel may be as high 
as 85 per cent. Like all 
water wheels the Pel- 
ton is a wheel-and- 
axle machine. The 
force is applied at the 
cups, and the shaft of 
the wheel is turned, 
transmitting the en- 
ergy for running ma- 
chinery.

ton. The piston of the 
small cylinder is operated by a lever. The cylinders and con- 
necting tube are filled with water, the smaller cylinder being 
connected with a water-supply source. When the piston in 
the small cylinder is pushed downward, water is forced into 
the large cylinder, causing the large piston to move upward, 
and exert a great force. 
The force is multiplied by such a machine. Suppose that a 
force of 100 pounds is applied to the small piston by pushing 
down on the lever, and suppose also that the small piston has 
an area of one square inch, while the area of the large piston

is 10 square inches. If 100 pounds of force are applied to 
the small piston, there will be 100 pounds of pressure against 
the water below the piston. Since the pressure in water is the 
same in all directions at any depth, there will be a pressure 
of 100 pounds on every square inch of surface inside the con- 
tainer. Water, being free to move 
and being non-compressible, will 
transmit this pressure to every 
square inch of water in the large 
cylinder and, therefore, against 
the large piston. If the large 
piston has an area of 10 square 
inches, as you supposed at the ey y 
start, there will be 100 times 10, Em, 
or 1000 pounds of force against Fig. 352. Sectional View of a 
the large piston. You see that Hydraulic Press 
the force exerted has been multi- 
plied ten times by such arrangement. The pistons can be made 
of different diameters; so the force may be multiplied as many 
times as the cross-section of the large piston is greater than the 
cross-section of the small piston. It will be seen that the 
small piston must move ten times as far as the large piston. 
While the force is multiplied ten times, the distance through 
which the force is exerted by the large piston is only ;'y as great 
as the distance through which the applied force moves.     
      
  
  Exercise 14. A hydraulic press does not save work. Explain, 
keeping in mind the scientific meaning of the word work. 
Exercise 15. Compare the hydraulic press which you just studied 
with a ten-strand pulley system, considering the mechanical advan- 
tage of force of each and the distances through which the force in 
and force out move. (See page 332.) 
Exercise 16. If the lever arm in Figure 352 is six feet long, the 
distance from the fulerum to the piston one foot, the area of the 
small piston four square inches, and the area of the large piston 100 
square inches, what force can be exerted with the device by applying 
a force of 50 pounds at the handle of the lever?

| PROBLEM 7: WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE 
TERM “HORSE-POWER”? 
| Probably everyone has heard that an automobile engine 
has a certain horse-power or that the water at a waterfall can 
develop so many horse-power. What is the meaning of the 
term horse-power and how is it measured? 
‘‘Horse-power’’ is the unit for measuring power. You recall 
that the terms force, work, energy, and power have different 
meanings. Force 
moving through a 
distance does work; 
anything which has 
the ability to do 
work possesses en- 
ergy; the rate at 
which work is done 
Fig. 353. Horse-Power is known as power. 
If the horse pulls the load with a force of 150 To measure force,

much work does he do in one minute?   
    
work, and energy 
you used certain 
units. Similarly, to measure power you must have a unit. The 
unit most commonly used is the horse-power. 
The term horse-power originally referred to the rate at which 
a horse works (Figure 353). A horse walking at the rate of 
two and one-half miles an hour for eight to ten hours a day 
should not be required to pull more than one-tenth or one- 
eighth of its own weight. If a horse weighs 1200 pounds and 
pulls one-eighth of its weight, it must pull 150 pounds. In 
one hour the horse would do 1505280 X24, or 1,980,000 foot- 
pounds. Divide this by 60 and you have 33,000 foot-pounds 
per minute. Scientists have agreed to take this rate of work 
as the unit of power and call it the horse-pdwer. 
When we say an engine has a horse-power of twenty-five, we 
mean that it can do 25 X 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute. 
Similarly, when it is said that 500,000 horse-power may be de- 
veloped by the water at the Keokuk dam on the Mississippi
-P-A-G-E-401
MEANING OF HORSE-POWER 365 
River, we mean that the water can do 500,000 times 33,000 
foot-pounds of work per minute. Stated in other terms, this 
means that the power which may be developed at Keokuk 
could lift a weight of 100 tons over 15 miles high in one minute. 
You see what a tremendous power the water at a single dam 
may have. 
Exercise 17. If the work done at the present time by the turbines 
at Keokuk is about 10,000,000,000 foot-pounds per minute, how many 
horse-power are developed? 
Exercise 18. Knowing your weight and the height of a stairway, 
walk up the stairway at your ordinary rate, noting how many seconds 
are required to reach the top. Calculate how many foot-pounds of 
work you did each minute. Take the average of two trials. What 
fraction of a horse-power expresses the rate at which you worked? 
Compare your results with those of someone who is heavier or lighter 
than you.

THE STORY OF UNIT XIII 
In man’s search for sources of energy to run his machines and 
to improve his methods of transportation, he has come to use 
the forces of air, water, steam, exploding gas, and electricity. 
You have learned how air and water are used. In a later 
unit you will see how electricity is generated and utilized. In 
the present unit you will consider two important forces, steam 
and exploding gas.

There is probably no force which does as much of our work 
as steam. Stationary steam engines run many machines in 
factories, generate electricity, help 
to build roads, dig canals, and in a 
variety of other ways save our 
strength and our time. Similarly, 
steam engines on _ locomotives, 
steamships, and automobiles fur- 
nish the force for rapid travel and 
transportation. How important 
steam is can be appreciated best 
when you think how different life 
would be without the steam engine 
and its numerous uses. Think, for 
example, of the difference between

Or, he can travel half-way across the 
United States in the same time which 
was required to go from Philadelphia to 
New York by stagecoach. 
The development of the use of steam 
has been very rapid.. Though a Greek, Fig. 358. 
named Hero, constructed a toy engine as Ger oatne san 
early as 150 B.c. (Figure 357), no practical use of steam was 
made before 1633 a.p., when an engine was used to pump water 
from coal mines in England. In 1784 James Watt, an English

scientist, constructed an engine much like those which we use 
today. Following that date many stationary engines were 
used, but Fulton was the first to make use of steam to propel a 
water vehicle, when, in 1807, he made his famous trip from 
New York to Albany in the Clermont. (See Figure 481, page 
483.) A little later, in 1829, Stephenson completed the Rocket, 
the first really successful locomotive for land transportation. 
Eccentric

  Fig. 359. A Steam Engine 
This is a common type of stationary steam engine. 
All forms of steam engines depend upon the energy of steam 
molecules. As water is heated, its molecules move more rapidly 
until some of the water changes to steam. (See page 269.) ni 
These steam molecules possess energy and can do work. Thus, 
if you generate steam in a test tube fitted with a stopper 
(Figure 358), the stopper is blown from the tube by the force 
of the millions of molecules of steam which strike it. In a 
similar way steam may be generated by the fire under a steam 
boiler. The steam may then be led by pipes into the cylinder 
of a steam engine (Figure 359). Here it exerts a tremendous 
pressure against the piston and moves the piston. By allow- 
ing the steam to enter the cylinder first on one side of the 
piston and then on the other, the piston is moved back and 
forth. A rod connected with the piston turns a flywheel.

  370 USING STEAM AND EXPLODING GAS 
The importance of the gas engine as a means of power is 
almost as great as that of the steam engine. The first practical 
gas engine was not invented until 1876. Since that time its 
development has been one of the most marvelous achievements 
of modern times. Machines of all kinds are operated by it.

Fig. 360. A Stationary Gas Engine 
This type of gas engine is used to run machinery of all sorts. 
Thus, on the farm it is used to saw wood, churn butter, thresh 
and grind grain, pump water, and run dynamos which furnish 
electric light. Often the engine is portable and can be moved 
from place to place to serve a great number of uses. ‘In fac- 
tories it is of similar importance. Perhaps its most commonly 
seen use is in the automobile, motorboat, and airplane, where 
it furnishes the power to drive these vehicles. Many ocean- 
going ships are coming to use the gasoline engine. 
The gas engine depends for its power upon exploding gas. 
A proper mixture of combustible gas and air is very explosive. 
Thus, if you mix some illuminating gas and air in the proper
-P-A-G-E-407

proportion in a wide-mouthed bottle and bring a flame to the 
mouth of the bottle, an explosion results. During such an 
explosion the gases formed by combination of the oxygen and 
he elements of the gas are greatly heated and expand rapidly. 
If the gas and oxygen are compressed in a closed space, a great

orce outward is produced by the explosion. Such force may 
e utilized within a cylinder of a gas engine (Figure 360) to 
move the piston. The piston may be connected by a rod to 
a crank shaft (Figure 361) and thus made to turn the wheel. 
You see that there is some similarity between the steam 
engine and the gas engine. In the steam engine the driving 
force is produced by the energy of the moving steam molecules 
which get their energy from the heat of the fire under the 
boiler. In the gas engine the driving force comes from the 
expansion of the gases which are produced by combination of 
the mixture of gas and oxygen. The ordinary automobile 
engine uses gasoline, which is changed to a gas and mixed with   
   
-P-A-G-E-408

air in the carburetor before the mixture is compressed and 
exploded in the cylinder. In both engines the piston moves 
backward and forward or upward and downward and is con- 
nected by a piston rod to the machine which it operates. 
Each kind of engine has certain advantages over the other. 
The steam engine is not so complicated and can be kept in

running condition much more easily than the gas engine. It 
does not require careful adjustment of parts like the carburetor, 
electric system, and gears of the gas engine. This makes it 
more reliable in operation. On the other hand, the gas engine 
is light; it weighs only one-half or one-third as much as a steam 
engine of the same power. ‘Thus, for use in automobiles and 
airplanes, where a light, compact, and efficient power plant 
is required, the gas engine is superior to the steam engine.

  HOW STEAM IS GENERATED 373 
PROBLEM 1: HOW IS STEAM GENERATED FOR POWER? 
The steam which is necessary to run a steam engine is gen- 
erated in boilers by heating water. A common type of boiler 
is the fire-tube boiler (Figure 362). It consists of iron tubes 
fastened inside a large cylinder made of steel plates from one- 
half to seven-eighths of an inch in thickness. The tubes ex- 
tend the full length 
and open at each end 
through the heavy steel 
ends of the boiler (Fig- 
ure 362). They may 
vary from two to 
four inches in diameter 
in boilers of different 
size. The boiler is so 
placed and constructed 
that the hot gases from 
the fire pass through 
the iron tubes on their 
way to the smokestack 
and heat the water 
which is in the spaces |4 
around the fire tubes. WATER BAFFLE

the space above the water level. Pipes leading from the top 
of the boiler carry the steam to the engine. 
Another form of boiler, which is used to generate steam in 
large quantities for stationary engines, is the water-tube boiler 
(Figure 363). In this boiler the water is in the tubes, and the 
hot gases from the fire pass over these tubes, heating the water 
inside. The steam collects in the upper part of the steam 
dome above. This very efficient type of boiler is used in 
many large steam-producing plants.

  374 USING STEAM AND EXPLODING GAS 
Exercise 1. Why are water-tube and fire-tube boilers used in- 
stead of cylindrical boilers which are heated by a fire underneath 
the cylinder? 
Boilers are fitted with safety valves. Since steam may 
exert a tremendous pressure in the boiler when the fire is too 
hot, there must be some way to 
avoid the bursting of the boiler. 
To prevent this, boilers are fitted 
with safety valves. Figure 364 shows 
one kind of safety valve. This is 
called the weight and lever safety 
valve. The device is fitted to the 
top of the boiler. The cone-shaped 
valve fits against the valve seat

oe) your reason. (See page hosition of the weight, any desired 
force can be exerted downward 
on the valve. When the pressure of the steam in the boiler 
becomes greater than the downward pressure of the valve, 
the valve is forced open, and the steam escapes through the 
blow-off pipe until the proper pressure is reached in the boiler. 
  Exercise 2. If the weight in Figure 364 weighs 20 pounds and is 
placed at a distance of 12 inches from the fulcrum, while the distance 
from the fulcrum to the valve stem is 4 inches, what force must the 
steam exert to open the valve? 
Locomotives require an enormous steam pressure. The 
great steam pressure required to run large locomotives is pos- 
sible because when the water is heated in an enclosed boiler, the 
boiling point of the water is changed, as shown in Experiment 79. 
Experiment 79: (To be done by the instructor) How does the boiling 
point of water depend upon the pressure? 
(a) Pour some water in a flask or in a tin can with a narrow neck. 
Fit a one-holed stopper with a thermometer and arrange the ap- 
paratus as in Figure 365. Heat the water until it boils, holding the
-P-A-G-E-411
HOW STEAM IS GENERATED 375 
thermometer so the stopper does not close the mouth of the vessel. 
The temperature will be about 100° C. or 212° F., depending upon 
the altitude of your school above sea-level. Now push the stopper 
slowly and gently (not securely) into the mouth of the flask, allowing 
a little steam to escape. What effect does this 
have upon the temperature? (Caution: Stand 
back an arm’s length.) 
(6) If mercury and glass tubing are available, 
arrange an apparatus as shown in Figure 366. 
Bring the water to boiling and note the tem- 
perature. Then insert the stopper tightly and 
heat the flask with a very small flame. The 
thermometer will give you the temperature, and 
the difference in level of the mercury in the two 
arms of the tube will give the pressure above the 
atmospheric pressure. You can take several 
different readings of the thermometer, and at 
the same time take a

Pressure and Boil- 
ing Point in the mercury level of one inch is equal to 
a pressure of .49 pound.) From these read- 
ings you can see how the boiling point varies 
with the pressure. 
Water changes to steam at approxi- 
mately 100°C. or 212°F., when heated in 
an open vessel. It cannot be heated 
above this temperature, for as more heat 
is added, more water changes to steam. 
This change of a liquid to a gas takes 
up the additional heat, and the temper- 
ature of the water remains at about 
100°C. or 212°F. In the boiler the steam 
cannot escape; it therefore exerts a pressure against the surface 
of the water. The water cannot change to steam so rapidly 
because of this pressure, and the added heat from the fire box
-P-A-G-E-412
    376 USING STEAM AND EXPLODING GAS 
increases the temperature of both the water and the steam. The 
speed at which the molecules of steam move depends upon their 
temperature; the higher the temperature, the greater the speed. 
In locomotives the temperature of the steam is often as high 
as 400°F. The need for this great pressure is clear when we 
consider that some of the giant locomotives are able to draw 
a loaded train a mile and a quarter long, weighing 17,000 tons. 
Exercise 3. Summarize the important ideas in Problem 1. 
PROBLEM 2: HOW DOES STEAM RUN AN ENGINE?

the parts which are essential to the engine. The steam comes

is an iron box located at the side of or directly above the 
cylinder. In the bottom or side of the steam chest are three 
openings. Two of these lead to the cylinder, and are called 
the ports. On the bottom of the steam chest rests a heavy 
metal block which is hollowed out on the lower side and which 
slides back and forth when pulled or pushed by the slide-valve 
rod. This metal block is called the slide valve, and is large 
enough always to cover one port and the exhaust through which 
the used steam leaves the engine. Inside the cylinder is a 
circular disk called the piston, to which is attached the piston rod.
-P-A-G-E-413
  HOW STEAM RUNS AN ENGINE 377 
The piston rod is attached to the flywheel shaft by the 
eccentric. Any motion of the piston rod will turn the flywheel. 
As the flywheel rotates, the slide-valve rod is moved backward 
and forward, opening and closing the ports at the proper time. 
How the engine works. Modern steam engines are double- 
acting. Steam enters the steam chest from the boiler (Figure 
367). From here it passes through port (A) and enters the 
cylinder, where it expands, forcing the piston toward the other 
end. Any steam in the other end of the cylinder is forced out 
of port (B) into the hollow of the slide valve and escapes through 
the exhaust, which opens into the outside air. As the piston 
moves, the piston rod, kept in a horizontal position by the 
sliding-guide, turns the wheel by means of the piston-rod 
eccentric. When the flywheel rotates, the slide-valve eccentric 
moves the slide valve toward the opposite end of the steam 
chest. By the time the piston has reached the left end of the 
cylinder, the slide valve has moved far enough in the opposite 
direction to uncover port (B) and connect port (A) with the 
exhaust. Steam now enters the cylinder from the steam chest 
through port (B) and forces the piston in the opposite direction, 
causing the wheel to continue its rotation. At the same time 
the steam in the right end of the cylinder is forced out into the 
air through the exhaust. As the piston reaches the right end, 
the slide valve has moved to the opposite end of the steam 
chest, and steam enters port (A), driving the piston in the op- 
posite direction. And so the back and forth motion of the 
piston is changed to the circular motion of the wheel, which 
continues to rotate so long as steam passes from boiler to 
steam chest. This flow of steam is controlled by a valve 
operated by a lever called the throtile. (See Figure 368.) 
Experiment 80: How does a toy steam engine work? 
Bring a toy steam engine to the classroom if there is none available 
in the room. Examine it carefully. Start the fire and study the 
operation of the engine. Make a section drawing showing the fire, 
the boiler, and the engine. 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
  378 USING STEAM AND EXPLODING GAS 
Flywheels are necessary on engines. The flywheel to 
which the piston is attached is a necessary part of the steam 
engine. It is very heavy, and it takes an enormous force to 
set it in motion. As its speed increases, it becomes more 
and more difficult to stop. This tendency of any object to 
remain in motion or to remain stationary is called inertia. 
The flywheel is a necessary part of the steam engine because 
it insures a constant speed. When the piston is at either end 
of the cylinder, there is no steam pressure on it. (Examine 
Figure 367 to see why this is true.) These are called the 
dead points. The inertia of the heavy flywheel moves the 
piston past these points, and so the steam can again exert 
pressure upon the piston. If it were not for the flywheel, the 
engine would slow up at the end of each stroke, and if the 
load were very heavy, it might stop. A belt may be run by 
the flywheel, as shown in Figure 333, page 349, or a small belt 
wheel may be rigidly attached to ihe axle of the flywheel. In 
some cases gears are used to transfer the energy of the wheel 
to machinery. 
Exercise 4. Make a drawing of the steam engine like that shown 
in Figure 367, but with the piston at the other end of the cylinder. 
Show the position of the slide valve and the direction of the steam 
through the engine. 
PROBLEM 3: HOW DOES A STEAM ENGINE RUN A 
LOCOMOTIVE? 
The ordinary locomotive has two engines, one on either side 
in front of the drive wheels and just outside the small wheels. 
Figure 368 shows one side of a locomotive. The piston rod is 
connected with an eccentric on the middle drive wheel. A long 
heavy bar, called the Johnson bar, is attached to this eccentric 
and to the eccentrics of the other drive wheels. As steam 
drives the piston back and forth, the drive wheels rotate. 
The friction between the wheels and the track is so great 
that the wheels cannot slip, and the locomotive is forced to 
move. The pistons, slide valves, and eccentrics in the two
-P-A-G-E-415
HOW GAS ENGINES OPERATE 379 
engines on either side of the locomotive are so arranged that 
when one engine is passing the “dead point,’ the engine on 
the other side is exerting its greatest force in rotating the 
wheels. The locomotive, therefore, cannot so stop that both 
engines are at their “dead points,’ and it is always ready to 
move when the engineer opens the throttle: valve and allows 
steam to pass to the steam chests. 
In order to keep up high steam pressure, a strong draft is 
required through the fire box. The smokestack is too short 
to be of value in this respect. (See page 231.) This in-

creased, or forced, draft is produced by leading the exhaust 
pipe from the engine into the smokestack. The rush of 
steam through the stack carries the burned gases out very 
rapidly, and fresh air enters the fire box through the draft 
openings. 
Exercise 5. You have probably read about engineers “reversing” 
their engine to prevent running into another train. What does the 
engineer do, and why does this slow down the train? 
PROBLEM 4: HOW IS THE FORCE OF EXPLODING GAS 
USED TO RUN AN ENGINE? 
All gas engines require an explosive mixture composed of 
a gas which will burn, and air. In some engines a gas like 
that employed for lighting purposes may be used. Perhaps 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
  380 | USING STEAM AND EXPLODING GAS 
the most common fuel is gasoline. Since gasoline must be 
changed to a vapor or gas before it is mixed with air to form 
an explosive mixture, you may properly speak of gasoline 
engines as gas engines. 
Gas engines consist of many parts. The part of the gas 
engine in which the explosion takes place is nothing more than 
a cylindrical hole, 
called the cylinder, 
bored into a block 
ofiron. Figure 369 
shows the top of 
the cylinder, which 
is closed by a cap, 
or cylinder head. 
Three holes open 
into the upper part 
of each cylinder. 
One is the opening 
for the spark plug. 
The other two 
openings are called 
Fig. 369 * the intake and the Cylinder Block of a Four-Cylinder Engine Ehiist Genes aie 
The spark plug openings are shown in the 
cylinder head, which is tilted back. The gasket ture of gas and air 
in the foreground is placed on top of the cylinder enters through the 
block, and then the cylinder head is screwed intake, and ex- 
down tight. xP de ploded gas is forced 
out of the exhaust. These two openings are controlled by 
valves which open and close automatically at the proper time. 
On the inside of the cylinder is the piston (Figure 361). 
The piston is connected by a rod to the crank shaft (Figures 
361, 371, and 372). At one end of the crank shaft is a large 
heavy flywheel from which the power is transmitted by a belt, 
clutch, or series of gears. The other end of the crank shaft is 
usually fitted with a crank for starting the engine. These 
parts make up the engine itself. 
 
-P-A-G-E-417
HOW GAS ENGINES OPERATE 381 
An explosive mixture does the work. To operate the 
engine the mixture of gasoline vapor and air must be admit- 
ted into the cylinder. To 
do this, gasoline must first 
be brought by pipes from 
the tank to the carburetor 
(Figure 370). The flow of 
the gasoline into the float 
chamber is regulated by a 
valve attached to the bottom 
part of the float. From 
the float chamber the gaso- 
line is sprayed into the mix- 
ing chamber, where it is 
mixed with the proper amount Fig. 370. Sectional View 
of air. of a Carburetor       
  
  
  Experiment 81: Why must the correct mixture of air and gas be 
used in a gasoline engine? 
(a) Obtain a small tin baking-powder can and punch a small hole 
through the lid. Also punch a small hole in the side of the can 
near the bottom. Fill the can with illuminating gas by means of a 
rubber tube leading to the small hole in the side. Stand back at a 
safe distance and bring a flame near the hole in the lid. What hap- 
pens? Stand back and observe the flame at the top of the can. As 
the gas burns at the top, air enters at the bottom. What happens 
when the correct mixture of gas and air is obtained? 
(0) If illuminating gas is not available, the experiment may be 
performed as follows: Warm the can in a flame, remove the lid, 
and pour in 15 or 20 drops of gasoline. Place the lid on the can and 
shake the can up and down until the gasoline vaporizes. Then bring 
a flame to the hole in the side. What happens? Repeat the experi- 
ment, using a different amount of gasoline until you find the correct 
mixture to make an explosion. 
Exercise 6. A gas engine is difficult to start in cold weather. Why? 
Exercise 7. The “choker” on the dashboard of an automobile

eeeraive 8. The carburetor must be adjusted at different seasons 
of the year. Why? 
The ordinary engine has four cycles. Now let us see how 
the engine uses the explosive mixture and produces force to 
do work. First, the mixture must pass from the carburetor

to the cylinder. This is accomplished automatically. As the 
piston moves downward (Figure 371A), a partial vacuum is 
produced in the cylinder. Why? As the intake valve opens, 
the pressure of the outside air will force air and gasoline 
vapor from the carburetor into the cylinder. This is called 
the intake stroke. 
The cylinder is now filled with an explosive mixture. If the 
piston is then forced upward, and both intake and exhaust 
valves are closed, the mixture will be compressed (Figure 
371B). The compressed mixture will produce a greater force 
when it is exploded than a mixture which is not compressed. 
Why? This stroke is called the compression stroke.
-P-A-G-E-419
  
       HOW GAS ENGINES OPERATE 383 
The piston is now at the top of the cylinder. The electric 
spark then passes across the gap between the points of the 
spark plug, igniting the mixture, and an explosion takes place. 
Both of the valves are closed, so that the full force of the 
explosion drives the piston downward. This is the explosion, 
or power stroke (Figure 371C). 
The cylinder is now full of exploded gas. On the upward 
stroke of the piston, the exhaust valve is opened, and the 
burned gases are driven out through the exhaust (Figure 371D). 
This is called the exhaust stroke. 
As soon as the piston starts downward again, the intake 
valve opens, and a fresh supply of gas and air enters the cyl- 
inder. This type is called a fowr-cycle engine. As soon as the 
four strokes are completed, the engine begins on the next cycle. 
Table XIII shows the different strokes and the position of 
the valves at each stroke.

8rd stroke | explosion downward closed closed 
4th stroke | exhaust upward open closed   
  
Since the gas engine delivers power only during the explo- 
sion stroke, some device is necessary to keep the engine going 
during the other three strokes. This is accomplished by the 
flywheel, which is attached to the crank shaft. The flywheel 
is very heavy, and it takes a great deal of force to put it in 
motion. (See page 378). As its speed increases, it becomes 
more and more difficult to stop. The inertia of the flywheel 
thus keeps the engine in motion during the intervals between 
the power strokes. 
The more cylinders there are, the smoother the engine runs. 
Automobiles have four, six, eight, or twelve cylinders, and

  the explosions are so timed that there is very little interval 
between the power strokes. In a one-cylinder engine there 
is one power stroke to every two revolutions of the flywheel.

HOW AUTOMOBILES ARE RUN 385 
An automobile has many systems. In addition to the power 
system there are several other parts necessary in the operation 
of a gas engine. An electrical system is needed to generate 
electricity and furnish it to the engine at the proper time. 
All of the moving parts must be well oiled to keep them from 
wearing out; some kind of lubrication system is needed to 
accomplish this. The tremendous heat produced in the ex- 
plosion must be carried away to prevent the engine from be- 
coming red-hot. An air or water cooling-system (Figure 372) 
takes care of this. In using the engine in automobiles, a 
transmission system is required so that the power of the engine 
may be transferred to the wheels. In order to keep an auto- 
mobile or gas engine in good running condition it is essential 
that the operation of each of these systems be kept at the 
highest efficiency. This means that each system and its rela- 
tion to the operation of the car or engine must be thoroughly 
understood. 
Exercise 9. Make a summary of the steps which are necessary 
to have the gasoline in the tank run a gas engine. Thus: 
1. The gasoline must pass to the carburetor, etc. 
PROBLEM 5: HOW DOES THE ENGINE RUN AN 
AUTOMOBILE? 
You know that when the engine of an automobile is started, 
the car is not set in motion. This means that the engine is 
not yet connected with the rear wheels. If you examine 
Figure 373, you will see how the engine is connected with 
and disconnected from the rear wheels. You recall that 
the gas engine includes a crank shaft and a flywheel, which 
are made to rotate by the force of exploding gas exerted on 
the pistons. In order to impart this motion to an auto- 
mobile a further set of devices is needed. In order of posi- 
tion from the flywheel of the engine to the rear axle of the 
car these devices are as follows: the clutch, the transmission 
gears, the propeller shaft, and the differential gears. We shall 
   
-P-A-G-E-422
386 USING STEAM AND EXPLODING GAS 
now see how each of these functions in making the power of 
the engine move the car. 
The flywheel, as you remember, is attached to the crank 
shaft of the engine. Connected with the flywheel is the clutch. 
This clutch can be moved backward by the clutch pedal, so that 
it will not come in contact with the flywheel. Thus, when 
you press your foot on the pedal, you disconnect the clutch 
from the engine, causing the clutch to stop turning. When the 
clutch pedal is released, the flywheel sets the clutch in motion. 
Back of the clutch is the gear box (Figure 373), which con- 
tains several gears. When the gear-shift is in neutral, the 
gears do not mesh, and no power is transmitted to the pro- 
peller shaft. When the gears are shifted into low speed, a 
small gear connected with the clutch drives a large gear 
connected to the propeller shaft. The small gear revolves 
more rapidly than the large gear, so that the propeller shaft 
will turn more slowly than the engine. Why? (See page 336.) 
When the gears are shifted to second speed, the sizes of the 
two gears are more nearly alike, and the car will move more 
rapidly. When the gears are shifted into high speed, in many 
cars the shaft from the clutch connects directly to the main 
shaft, and the propeller shaft will turn as fast as the engine. 
This system of gears is necessary because it requires more 
power to start the car than it does to keep it moving, and be- 
cause at different times different degrees of power and speed 
are needed. 
The power is transmitted to the rear wheels by the pro- 
peller or driving shaft, which is connected with the main shaft, 
as shown in Figure 373. Since the propeller shaft turns in a 
different direction from the rear wheels, another system of 
gears is necessary to change the direction of the power. This 
change of direction is accomplished by the differential, which 
is the large round part in the middle of the rear axle. The 
differential also permits one rear wheel to go faster than the 
other, which is of course necessary when the car is going 
around a corner.

               Electricity is one of the most useful forces which nature 
furnishes to man. By harnessing this foree man has come 
into possession of an unlimited source of energy. Electricity 
has many uses. It can drive machinery of all sorts, propel 
vehicles, lift heavy objects, and transmit messages. When it 
is passed through certain kinds of wire, it is changed into heat 
and light energy, as occurs in the electric toaster and the 
electric-light bulb. When it is passed through solutions of 
certain chemicals, it can decompose them. Use is made of 
this property to electroplate articles with gold and silver, to 
free metals from their ores, and to make new chemicals.. These 
are the most important uses of electricity, through which 
man has changed living conditions so that the humblest home

today may be supplied with conveniences which were beyond 
the reach of kings a hundred years ago. 
Generating or producing electricity is a very simple matter. 
One simple way to do it is to rub a ma- 
terial like hard rubber with a piece of 
wool. Another way is by passing a comb 
through your hair several times. If you 
then bring the comb near some small 
pieces of paper, they will be attracted and 
jump up to it. The comb has become 
electrified. This method of producing 
electricity was known as far back as 600 
s.c. The electric charge on the objects 
which are rubbed together is known as 
static electricity, for it was formerly 
thought that electricity does not move, or 
flow. Because of the method of producing 
it, it was called frictional electricity, and 
was for more than 2000 years the only 
  kind known. It was thought to have 
no practical value, and was of inter- 
est only to scientists, who regarded 
it as a rather curious property which 
some materials possessed. 
It was not until 1799 that Alessan- 
dro Volta, an Italian scientist, dis- 
covered a method of producing a 
current of electricity by inventing 
the electric cell. This cell is very 
simple and can easily be made by 
placing a strip of copper and 4 strip 
of zinc in a dilute solution of sulphu- 
ric acid (Figure 374). If this cell is

The electric energy is produced by the chemical action which

       THE STORY OF UNIT XIV 391 
takes place between the zinc and the sulphuric acid. During 
this chemical action the chemical energy of the zine and the 
sulphuric acid is changed into electric energy. 
Cells are easily obtained and furnish enough electricity 
to operate small electric appliances. The type in greatest 
use at present is called the dry cell 4 (

which connect with the push-button

find that they are connected to an elec- 
tric cell. If you take apart your flash- 
light, an electric cell will be found 
inside. When you press on the starter

tric cells are very useful, because they 
can be carried around from place to place with little inconven- 
ience and so made to furnish us with a small current of elec- 
tricity whenever we need it. 
Since man first recognized the wonderful source of power 
which electricity gave to him, he has been constantly experi- 
menting to find new methods of generating and using it. He 
discovered very early that the cell did not furnish sufficient 
electricity for his uses. Until 1831, however, the cell was the 
only source of current electricity. In that year, Faraday, a 
famous English scientist, discovered that an electric current 
could be generated by moving a coil of wire between the poles

of a horseshoe magnet (Figure 377). After about forty years 
of experimentation this method resulted in the perfection of 
a machine which would produce a heavy current of electricity. 
This machine, which is called the dynamo, may be run by a 
steam engine, gas engine, or water-wheel. Wires connected 
to the machine carry an electric current away from it. 
With a powerful source of electric 
energy, such as the dynamo sup- 
plied, man’s understanding and use 
of electricity increased rapidly. One 
of the many electrical devices in- 
vented was the electric motor. This 
is used to’ run fans, pumps, auto- 
mobiles, and machinery of all sorts.

  PROBLEM 1: HOW ARE CELLS USED AS A SOURCE OF 
ELECTRICITY? 
A complete circuit is necessary. The easiest way to under- 
stand how a simple cell is used is to construct one and connect 
it to some electrical device. 
Experiment 83: How is a simple cell constructed and connected so 
as to furnish an electric current? 
(a) Obtain a glass tumbler, a small strip of zine, and a strip of 
copper. Make a small hole in one end of each strip, so that a wire 
may be attached. Bend the end with the hole so that it will hang 
on the rim of the tumbler (Figure 375). Make a solution of sul-
-P-A-G-E-429
THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT 393 
phuric acid, using one part of acid to ten parts of water. (Always 
pour the acid into the water.) Pour this mixture into the tumbler. 
(6) Place the zine and 
copper strips in the solution 
and connect one of them by 
a wire to one binding post 
of an electric bell. Does 
the bell ring? Now connect 
the other strip to the other 
binding post of the bell. 
Does the bell ring? 
You see from Experi- 
ment 83 that both the 
zinc and copper strips 
have to be connected to the bell before it will ring. In all 
electric circuits a wire must be connected 
from the cell to the device which is being 
operated, and then another wire must be 
connected back to the other strip in the 
cell. Before electricity will flow from a 
ee Cate Mee TS cell, there must always be a complete 
cuit-Breaker electric circuit (Figure 378). Copper wire 
The circuit is made is generally used for this purpose because and broken by the push--, - Gre 
button. (SeeFigure3s0.) it is a good conductor of electricity. 
In operating an electric bell, a push- 
button is placed in the circuit (Figure 379). Figure 380 shows the 
construction of a push-button. A flat 
Yj strip of brass is fastened at the bottom,

  and one wire from the cell is attached to 
it. At the top is a piece of brass spring 
which is connected to the wire leading to ry Netti

pressed down, the current cannot pass, When the button is 
because the circuit is broken. When the mene i are he 
push-button is pressed down, the two 
pieces of brass are brought together and the circuit is made; 
therefore the current can pass. A device, like the push-button,

which can “make” or “break” the circuit is called a circwit-

  Fig. 381. A Double Throw-Switch 
This type of switch is common- 
ly used where a strong current 
passes through the circuit. to turn on or off electric lights 
or motors, are circuit-breakers. 
When connecting any electrical 
devices to a cell or other source 
of electricity, always check over 
your connections to be sure you 
have a complete circuit. 
‘You have probably heard about 
short-circuits. Let ussee what this 
term means. Electricity always 
travels by the shortest possible 
path, and, if two wires should 
happen to touch, as shown in Figure 384, only a small part of 
the current would pass through the bell, 
most of the current taking the short cut 
back to the cell. This is a short-circuit. 
One method of guarding against short 
circuits is to use insulated wire. Ma- 
terials like cotton, wool, silk, and rubber 
are non-conductors of electricity; that 
is, electricity will not travel through 
them. If the wires are wrapped with 
any of the above materials, the wires

This is the common electric-light socket. any danger of a short- 
circuit unless too great a 
current is sent through 
them. Short-circuiting 
will wear out a cell rap- 
idly, and may cause fires. 
Therefore, when you are 
making connections for

  THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT 395 
How a simple cell is made. In the last experiment you 
constructed a simple cell, using zinc and copper strips and 
sulphuric acid. The strips in a cell are called electrodes, and 
the liquid in which they are placed is 
called the electrolyte. In other words, the 
simple cell consists of a zine electrode and 
a copper electrode placed in the electrolyte, 
sulphuric acid. Certain materials must 
be used as electrodes; some cannot be used ie See a chore Circuit : nsulation would pre- 
as electrolytes, as Experiment 84 shows. venta short-circuit here. 
  Experiment 84: What materials are necessary in making a cell? 
(a) Construct a cell as in Experiment 83. What evidence of chem- 
ical action, such as the production of heat or bubbles of gas? 
(b) Obtain two copper strips and place them in a solution of sul- 
phuric acid. Do you note any evidence of chemical action? Con- 
nect with a bell. Does it ring? 
(c) Obtain a dry zine and dry copper electrode and place them in 
a solution of sugar and water. Do you note any evidence of chemical 
action? Connect with a bell. Does it ring? 
In order for electric energy to be produced by a cell, two 
different kinds of materials must be used for the electrodes. 
These materials must be conductors of electricity. Further- 
more, the electrolyte must be such that it will act chemically 
upon one of the electrodes. If the cell which you constructed 
is left connected for some time, you will see that the zinc is 
gradually dissolved by the acid. The copper electrode does 
not act with the sulphuric acid. It is therefore called the 
inactive electrode. Chemical energy is changed into electric 
energy by the action of the zinc with the sulphuric acid. There 
are many different types of cells, but all are constructed on the 
same principle as the simple cell. 
Exercise 1. Why is a dry cell more practical than the simple cell?

circuit, short-circuit, circuit-breaker.

396 GENERATING AND USING ELECTRICITY 
PROBLEM 2: HOW IS ELECTRICITY MEASURED? 
The flow of electricity through a wire is very similar to the 
flow of water through a pipe. In order to use cells properly it 
is first necessary to have an idea of the nature of an electric 
current. You remember (page 126) that in a gravity system 
he water flows through pipes because of the pressure of the 
water in the reservoir. This pressure is measured in pounds 
persquareinch. The 
] | quantity of water 
flowing through the 
pipes is measured 
in gallons per min- 
ute. The number 
of gallons which 
will flow through a pipe depends upon three things: (1) the 
pressure of the water in the reservoir; (2) the diameter of the 
pipe; and (3) the resistance which the surface of the pipe 
offers to the flow of the water. 
Exercise 4. When the plugs are unscrewed, will water flow faster 
through Pipe A or Pipe B (Figure 385)? Explain. 
Exercise 5. Water will flow faster through Pipe C than through 
Pipe D (Figure 385). Why is this true? 
Exercise 6. Select the tank which will furnish the greatest pres- 
sure; select the pipe with the least resistance.   
    
       
    
            
  
    
  
        
      
      
Fig. 385. Diagram for Exercises 4, 5, and 6 
  In an electric cell a greater electrical pressure is produced 
on the electrode which acts chemically with the electrolyte 
than upon the inactive electrode. Thus, in the simple cell 
the electrical pressure built up on the zine electrode causes 
a current to flow through the wire to the copper electrode. 
This electrical pressure is commonly called electromotive force 
(E.M.F.), and the unit which is used to measure it is called 
the volt. The electrical pressure of a simple cell such as you 
constructed is approximately one volt. When the electrodes of 
a cell are connected by a wire, the wire offers a resistance to 
the passage of electricity through it. The unit used to measure 
this electrical resistance is the ohm. The amount of current
-P-A-G-E-433
MEASURING ELECTRICITY 397 
flowing through the wire per second is measured by the ampere. 
Ascomparison of the units used in a water-supply system and 
those used in measuring electric current is given below. 
Water Execrricity 
FLOW Gallons per second Amperes 
PRESSURE Pounds per square inch Volts 
RESISTANCE Pounds per square inch Ohms 
If the water pressure in the pipes is increased by raising the 
height of water in the reservoir or by operating the pumps more 
rapidly, the amount of water flowing through the pipes will also 
be increased, because there will be a greater force to overcome 
the resistance which the pipes offer. In the same manner, if 
the electrical pressure is increased, the amount of current will 
increase. If a longer pipe or a smaller pipe is used, the resist- 
ance will be greater, and the amount of water flowing through 
it will decrease. If a longer wire or a smaller wire is used, the 
resistance to the current will increase, and consequently the 
amount of current passing through the wire will decrease. 
This relation of the electrical pressure, the current strength, 
and the resistance is expressed in the following way: 
electromotive force ae   
current strength = ; 
resistance 
or in terms of the units of measurement, 
volts amperes =-——- ohms 
This is called Ohm’s Law, in honor of the man who discovered 
it. You can easily see how this law may be applied. For 
example, suppose that the electromotive force of a cell is one 
volt and that it is connected to a bell which has a resistance of 
four ohms. How much current will flow through the wire? 
Since the number of amperes equals the volts divided by the 
ohms, if you divide one by four you find that one-fourth of an 
ampere flows through the wire. What would be the current 
strength if the electromotive force, or voltage, were doubled?

When connected to the lighting circuit, one-half ampere of electricity

PROBLEM 3: HOW SHOULD CELLS BE CONNECTED? 
If you wish to operate any electrical device by means of 
cells, the proper E.M.F. and the proper current flow must be 
obtained. This may be done by using the correct number of 
cells and the proper kind and length of wire for the circuit, by 
making good connections, and by using the correct “hook-up.” 
Experiment 85: What kind of wire will secure the largest 
possible current? 
(a) Obtain two pieces of copper wire of equal length, one about 
No. 30 to No. 36 and one about No. 18 or No. 20. Connect each one 
separately to a simple cell 
or a dry cell and measure the 
current strength with a com- 
pass. This can be done by 
placing a compass on the 
table and turning it so that 
the needle points north and 
south, as shown by the mark- 
ings on the dial. Now connect 
the electrodes with the larger 
of the two copper wires. 
Bring the wire over the com- 
pass, as shown in Figure 386. 
The compass needle changes position, and the strength of the current is 
indicated by the number of degrees the needle shifts. Now use the wire 
of small diameter and repeat the test. Compare the results obtained. 
(6) Obtain a piece of copper wire and a piece of iron or german- 
silver wire of exactly the same diameter and length. Connect as in (a) 
and measure the current. Compare results.

made by soldering. If bare wires are used, care must be taken 
that they do not touch and produce a short-circuit. 
Exercise 10. What changes would you make in the electric circuit 
in Figure 387 if you wanted the bell to ring as loudly as possible? Base 
your answers on the result of Experiment 85. 
Proper combinations of cells should be used. For some uses, 
such as in radio, it is necessary to hook up two or more cells, 
that is, a bat- 
tery of cells. 
There are two 
common meth- 
ods of con- 
necting cells, 
in series and 
in parallel.

Note that the negative electrode (the zinc) of one cell is 
connected to the positive electrode (the carbon) of the sec- 
ond cell (see Figure 376), and the negative electrode of the Jey Motor

  400 GENERATING AND USING ELECTRICITY 
second cell is connected to the positive electrode of the third 
cell. From the other two electrodes, marked (A) and (B), wires 
lead to the device to be operated. When cells are connected 
in series, the E.M.F. is increased. For example, the E.M.F. 
“of one dry cell is 1.5 volts. 
Two dry cells connected 
in series have an E.M.F. 
of 3 volts, and three dry 
cells connected in series 
have an E.M.F. of 4.5 
volts. In operating elec- 
trie bells, telegraphs, and 
motors where high voltage 
is required, a series con- 
nection usually gives the 
best results. 
Cells are connected in 
parallel as shown in Fig-

that the negative elec- 
trodes are joined. In this arrangement the total E.M.F. is 
the same as the voltage of one cell. This arrangement of cells 
is used when a high voltage is not required and when a contin- 
uous current is needed over a long period of time. Its chief 
use is in connecting cells for lighting vacuum tubes in radio 
sets. Thus, when you have a 1.5 volt radio tube, it is more 
economical to light it with two cells connected in parallel than 
to use two single cells, one after another.

connecting the cells in parallel. Which one of the two connections 
makes the motor run the faster? 
Exercise 11. Dry cells have an E.M.F. of 1.5 volts. Make a 
drawing showing how you would connect two cells to a 1.5-volt 
vacuum tube, such as is used in radio. (More than 1.5 volts forces 
so much current through the filament of the tube that the filament 
will melt, or “burn out” in a short time.) 
PROBLEM 4: HOW DOES A STORAGE CELL FURNISH AN 
ELECTRIC CURRENT? 
A storage cell is made up of two electrodes of different 
materials and an electrolyte, as is the simple cell. When 
the ordinary cell is used for a long time, the negative electrode 
is used up, and the cell becomes‘worthless. The storage cell 
also becomes inactive, or “dead,” after it is used for a long 
time, but its activity may be restored by charging.     
  Experiment 87: How is a storage cell constructed and charged? 
(a) Take two 1-by-4-inch lead plates. Make a solution of sul- 
phuric acid, using one part of acid to eight parts of water. Pour this 
solution into a tumbler. Place the lead plates in the solution so that 
they do not touch each other. 
(b) Attach the lead plates to an electric bell 1 | | 
(Figure 375). Does the bell ring? Explain. 
(c) Connect three dry cells in series to the 
lead plates and allow a current to pass through 
for three or four minutes (Figure 390). Note 
the bubbles which collect on one plate and the Leag 
change in color on the other plate. Plate

oa In the commercial 
storage battery several cells are used, the number depending 
upon the voltage required. The voltage of a storage cell is about 
two volts. For a six-volt battery three cells are connected in 
series. The materials used in batteries are usually lead for the 
negative electrodes, lead peroxide for the positive electrodes, 
and sulphuric acid for the electrolyte. These materials which 
compose the electrodes are pressed into frames, or grids. Each 
cell contains several positive and several negative grids or 
plates. Perforated hard-rubber plates or other non-conductors 
keep the plates from touching so they will not become short- 
circuited. Positive plates of the cells are connected to posi- 
tive, and negative plates to negative, as shown in Figure 391. 
 
-P-A-G-E-439
  STORAGE BATTERIES 
Unfortunately no ‘“fool-proof” stor- 
age battery has thus far been con- 
structed. Storage cells are easily ruined 
if they do not have the proper care. 
The water in the cell evaporates, which 
makes it necessary to add water occa- 
sionally. Distilled water is always used 
for this purpose, since it contains no 
minerals which might injure the cells. 
The solution should never be below the 
top of the plates. The condition of the 
cell can be determined by means of an 
hydrometer (Figures 392 and 393). Each 
hydrometer has a scale upon which are 
printed numbers from 1100 to 1300. A 
cell, to be fully charged, must register 403 
  Fig. 392. Hydrometer

and a Discharged Cell 
Which reading is that 
from 1270 to 1300. 
i Fig. 393. Testing a Storage Battery 
The filler plug is removed, and 
the hydrometer is inserted into 
the cell. Squeezing the bulb and 
then releasing it will cause some of 
the electrolyte to rise into the hy- 
drometer. Why? If it falls below 
  of the charged cell? 
1150, it is practically dis- 
charged and should be re- 
charged at once. If the cells 
test differently, they should be 
taken to a competent battery 
expert, because they are short- 
circuited, or something else is 
wrong. If for any reason the 
battery is not working proper- 
ly, never pour acid into it or 
try to fix it yourself. Take it 
to a battery station.

storage cell differs in its construc- 
tion and its operation from a

404 GENERATING AND USING ELECTRICITY 
PROBLEM 5: HOW DOES A DYNAMO GENERATE AN 
ELECTRIC CURRENT? 
Magnets can be used to produce electricity. In order to 
understand how a dynamo generates an electric current, it is 
first necessary to examine the force exerted by magnets. 
Experiment 88: What is the nature of the force exerted by magnets? 
(a) Place either a bar magnet or horseshoe magnet in a pile of iron 
filings and then pick it up. Do you find the same amount of filings 
clinging to all parts of the magnet? 
The points where the magnetism ap- 
pears to be concentrated are called poles. 
(b) Secure a thin piece of cardboard 
or a glass plate and some fine iron filings. 
Place the cardboard or glass plate over 
a horseshoe magnet, as shown in Figure 
394. Sprinkle some iron filings on the 
glass plate, gently tapping the plate as you do so. Make a drawing 
showing the arrangement of the filings. 
(c) Wrap 10 turns of insulated wire 
around a large iron nail. Connect the 
wire to a cell as shown in Figure 395. 
Bring the end of the nail near several 
smaller nails and note that the latter 
are drawn over to the magnetized nail. 
How many nails will it hold up? Dis- — 
connect one wire from the cell. What Fig. 395. Apparatus for Ex- 
effect does this have upon the magnet? periment 88, part (c) 
  Fig. 394. Apparatus for Ex- 
periment 88, part (b) 
  From the experiment you see that there are two kinds of 
magnets. The bar and the horseshoe magnets, made of steel, 
retain their magnetism and are therefore called permanent 
magnets. When a coil of wire through which an electric 
current is passing is wound around an iron nail, you have 
an electromagnet. This retains its magnetism only so long as 
the current is passing through it. It is a temporary magnet. 
The experiment also shows that invisible rays extend be- 
tween the poles of a magnet, which affect pieces of iron 
placed in their paths. These are magnetic rays or lines of force. 
 
-P-A-G-E-441
  ELECTRICITY FROM DYNAMOS 405 
Whenever a coil of wire is moved between the poles of a 
magnet, the wire must cut through the magnetic lines of force 
which extend from one pole to the other. 
Experiment 89: What effect do the lines of force have upon a coil 
of wire which cuts through them? 
(a) Wrap a large nail with about 40 turns of No. 24 or No. 22 
insulated copper wire, leaving about one-half inch of the nail exposed 
at each end. 
(b) Connect the two loose ends of the wire 
and hold the wire over the compass as shown 
in Figure 386, page 398. 
(c) Clamp the nail so that it cannot move 
(Figure 396), and bring a horseshoe magnet 
toward it so that the poles pass over the coil 
which is wound around the nail. Observe that 
the needle of the compass moves either to the 
right or left as the magnet approaches. When 
the magnet is not in motion, there is no move- 
ment of the compass needle. 
(d) Pull the magnet away from the coil. 
Note that the compass needle turns, but this Fig. 396. Apparatus 
time in the opposite direction to that of the for Experiment 89 
first time. 
  When the magnetic lines of force between the poles of the 
horseshoe magnet are forced over the coil of wire, a current 
of electricity is produced in the coil. This was shown by the 
movement of the compass needle, which detects the presence of 
electrical currents. Furthermore, the direction of the current 
depends upon the direction in which the lines of force cut the 
coil. This was shown by the compass needle, which turned 
one way when the magnet was brought to the coil and in the 
other direction when it was moved away. An electric current 
is thus produced in a coil of wire when the lines of force be- 
tween the poles of a magnet cut through the coil. It makes 
no difference whether the magnet or the coil is moved. When- 
ever lines of force are cut by a conductor, they produce:a 
current of electricity.

    406 GENERATING AND USING ELECTRICITY 
A dynamo has four essential parts. There are four essential 
parts to a dynamo (Figure 397): (1) field-magnets, or stator, (2) 
armature, or rotor,

the copper wire in the armature are connected to the slip- 
rings, which turn with the 
armature. The brushes slide 
on the slip-rings and conduct 
the electricity to the outside 
circuit. The shaft of the arma- 
ture is connected to a steam 
engine, water turbine, or other 
source of power, which causes 
the armature to rotate. In this Gat ley Genera DIPS:

to the outside circuit. Dynamos furnish much higher voltage 
than cells. The usual voltage is 110 or 220. The ordinary 
house-lighting circuit requires 110 volts. Dynamos constructed 
to operate lighting circuits are run at such speed that the 
current changes 
direction 60 times 
a second. This is 
called a 60-cycle 
alternating current.

tator is connected 
to the coils of the armature in such a way that when the direc- 
tion of the current changes in the coils, the brushes will touch 
only the segments of the commutator through which the 
current is always traveling in the same direction. Thus the 
brushes carry off a direct current to the outside circuit. 
The direct-current dynamo is commonly used to charge 
automobile storage batteries, because the current must always 
enter the battery from the same direction in order to produce 
a different chemical change on the two electrodes.

PROBLEM 6: HOW DOES AN ELECTRIC MOTOR OPERATE? 
An electric motor (Figure 400) is very similar in construc- 
tion to an electric dynamo; in fact, it can be made to serve

This is a 10 horse-power motor. Its actual

dynamo. The action 
of the motor, how- 
ever, is just oppo- 
site to the action 
of the dynamo. 
The dynamo pro- 
duces electricity; 
the motor uses 
electricity to do 
work. A simple 
motor, which will 
show how an elec- 
tric motor operates, 
is very easily con- 
structed. 
Experiment 90: How maya simple motor be constructed? 
(a) For the armature, obtain a straight-sided cork about two inches 
long and three-quarters inch in diameter. Cut or notch it on two sides 
and wind it with about: 20 turns of 
No. 22 or No. 24 insulated wire 
(Figure 401). Then cut two small 
pieces of No. 18 bare copper wire 
about an inch long. Push them into 
the cork at right angles to the wind- 
ing. Fasten the free ends of the 
wire on the cork, one to each of the 
wires in the cork. Place a horseshoe 
magnet over the armature. Connect 
a copper wire to each electrode of a 
dry cell. Bare the ends of the wire     Needle ‘P08 Shae

are up and down (Figure 402). (If the armature does not turn, 
connect up two more dry cells, or increase the number of magnets.) 
(b) Reverse the direction of the current through the motor by 
reversing the wires. What effect does this have upon the directions 
in which the armature rotates? 
The armature moves 
around in the motor 
because of the magnetic 
forces which are acting 
upon it. There are two 
magnetic fields: that of 
the field magnets and 
that around the coils of 
wire on the armature. 
If the current is brought 
into the armature when 
the coils of the arma- Fig. 402. Construction of Simple Motor 
ture are in a certain 
position, the two magnetic fields oppose each other, and the 
result of the magnetic forces is to cause the armature to turn. 
When the direction of the current is changed, the motor runs 
in the opposite direction. 
The speed of an electric motor is regulated by putting greater 
or less resistance into the circuit to change the current strength. 
(See page 397). A device for accomplishing this is called a 
rheostat. If you have a small electric motor, you can con- 
struct a rheostat to regulate its speed.         
  Experiment 91: How can a rheostat for a small motor be constructed? 
(a) Obtain some No. 24 or No. 30 iron or german-silver wire. 
Wind about 30 turns around a pencil. Now connect one end of the 
coil to a dry cell. Connect the other electrode of the cell to the 
motor. Attach a copper wire to the other binding post of the motor 
and touch the free end of the wire to the free end of the coil. Does 
the motor run? If it does, it will be necessary to add more turns 
to the coil until finally the motor will not run. Now obtain a wooden

PROBLEM 7: HOW CAN ELECTRICITY BE USED FOR 
ELECTROPLATING? 
One of the many uses of electricity is that of plating objects 
with gold, silver, copper, nickel, or other metals. If you 
examine some of the silverware at home, you may find it 
stamped with the words “Silver-plated.” Practically all 
silver dishes or other silver objects which are not stamped 
“Sterling Silver” are plated. 
Experiment 92: How are objects electroplated?

a glass tumbler or beaker. Obtain a clean silver dime and make

a little stirrup of copper wire so that the dime can be suspended in 
the solution. Also obtain a strip of copper about four inches long 
and a half-inch wide. Connect the coin to the negative electrode 
of a dry cell (see page 399) and the copper strip to the positive elec- 
trode of the same cell.

THE STORY OF UNIT XV 
Proper lighting of our buildings and streets makes them not 
only more attractive but also more healthful places in which to 
live. When man began to use glass for windows, which allowed 
the sunshine to enter. buildings during the day, and to invent 
devices to light his buildings and streets at night, he greatly 
changed his way of living. Imagine what the inside of build- 
ings would be without glass and artificial methods of lighting! 
The earliest methods of artificial lighting were the open fires 
outside the shelters of primitive people. As you have learned 
(see page 259), the open fire was also used inside the shelters. 
Later, animal fat was burned in open vessels. Wicks of various 
kinds were placed in the fat and ignited, providing a poor light 
which smoked and gave off unpleasant odors.. Sometimes the 
crude wicks were simply stuck into a piece of animal fat, such 
as whale blubber or candle-fish fat. In time man learned to 
413
-P-A-G-E-450
  
  414 LIGHTING OUR BUILDINGS AND STREETS 
make candles of the animal fat and also to make a lamp by 
putting oil in a vessel and placing a crude wick in the oil (Figure 
406). Hundreds of years later candles were made of paraffin.

At the right of the 
bowl you can see the 
crude wick which dip- 
ped into the fat or oil. Some early lighting devices are shown in 
Figure 407. Figure 409 illustrates various 
forms of present-day gas and electric 
lights. The first practical use of gas for 
lighting a building was made by an 
Englishman, Murdock, in 1792. With the 
discovery of ways to separate crude 
petroleum into different fuels, kerosene 
came into use in lamps about 1860. In 
1879 Edison gave us the first electric 
bulb, or incandescent light (Figure 408), 
though an electric are lamp which worked 
much like the one in Figure 422, page 431, 
was in use as early as 1862. It is interest- 
ing to note that all the modern ways of 
lighting our buildings and streets have been invented and 
perfected during the last one hundred and twenty-five years. 
The sun furnishes us with light during the day. At night

It required many many years for man to improve his methods of 
lighting by inventing these different devices. 
various devices illuminate our buildings and streets with arti- 
ficial light. In every case these devices involve the use of some

hot body which gives us light. It may be the glowing carbon 
particles in the flame of a candle, of a kerosene lamp, or of 
a burning gas jet, the hot glowing mantle 
of a gas light, or the hot filament of an 
electric-light bulb. 
Wherever and whenever material is 
extremely hot, it sends out light in all 
directions. You see an object, not because 
light goes from your eyes to the object, 
but because light comes from the object 
to your eyes. Light is a form of energy 
and may be produced in different ways. 
Meteors give off light as ‘‘shooting stars” 
when the friction of the air heats them; 
a piece of metal held in a fire gives light 
when it is heated by the chemical action 
in the fire; a filament or wire glows when 
the electricity which passes through it heats 
it; burning gas heats the gas mantle, and 
light results. It is evident that light is a 
form of energy which may be produced by 
transforming some other kind of energy.

You already know some of the characteristics of light energy. 
Among the properties of light are the following: light travels in

416 LIGHTING OUR BUILDINGS AND STREETS 
straight lines (Figure 410); light moves out from the source in 
all directions until it strikes something through which it cannot 
pass; the nearer you are to the source of light, the brighter the 
light shines; light readily

cannot see the light. Try it. materials, allow some light to 
come through them but not 
enough to enable you to see through them; light cannot 
pass through opaque materials, like wood, metals, or rocks. 
Through a study of these properties man has been able to 
improve his methods of lighting. He has learned that one source 
of light may be better than another, and he can select the 
proper source for a given purpose. Frosted windows or shades 
can be used to give a “soft” even light instead of a “hard” direct 
light. Light-colored walls may be used to brighten a room 
which receives but little light. The intensity or brightness of 
light can be measured, and lamps of the proper power can be 
selected. The most economical sources of light may be used. 
These are but a few of the great number of facts which most 
of us know. Why these are facts and how scientists have 
proved them, will furnish you with many interesting problems 
about light energy and the use you make of it every day of 
your life.   
  
      
PROBLEM 1: HOW IS LIGHT FROM THE SUN 
USED FOR ILLUMINATION? 
The sun is our best source of light. This form of energy 
comes from the sun to the earth, across the 93,000,000 miles of 
space at the rate of 186,000 miles per second, requiring only 
about eight minutes for the entire journey. So great is the 
amount of light sent out by the sun that even at this great 
distance the direct rays are so bright that they injure our eyes.  
-P-A-G-E-453
  USING THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN 417 
If this light came directly into our rooms through windows in 
the ceiling or in the roof, it would be not only unpleasant but 
injurious to the eye. To avoid the direct light and to make it 
possible to see out of our build- 
ings, windows are placed in the 
sides of buildings. Thus most 
of the light which enters comes 
from the sky, but not directly 
  Perpendicular 
from the sun. es Febece ines 
Sunlight is reflected by the 
atmosphere. As the sun’srays fig, 411, How Light Is Reflected 
come into the atmosphere, they 
strike innumerable small particles of air, water vapor, and dust. 
Experiment 93: What happens when sunlight strikes dust 
particles? 
Allow a beam of sunlight to enter a darkened room through a 
hole in a curtain or through a small opening between the curtain and 
the window frame. Fill the space through which the beam passes 
with chalk dust by clapping together two blackboard erasers. Is 
the beam of light visible now? Why? 
The experiment helps you to understand how the sun’s rays 
light the sky. The rays are reflected from the air, dust, and 
water-vapor particles and then come to the earth. 
Let us see by an experiment how light is reflected. 
Experiment 94: How is light reflected? 
(a) Draw a line across the middle of a piece of paper and stand 
a mirror on this line, called the base line. Stick a pin in the paper 
a few inches in front of and to the right of the middle of the mirror. 
Close one eye and move the head until the open eye is level with the 
table and in front of the left edge of the mirror. Look at the image 
of the pin in the mirror. Place a mark on the base line at the point 
where you see the image in the mirror. Stick a pin a few inches in 
front of the mirror on the line along which you are sighting, as in 
Figure 411. Remove the mirror and draw a line from each pin to
-P-A-G-E-454
  418 LIGHTING OUR BUILDINGS AND STREETS 
the point which you made on the base line. These lines form two 
angles (a and 6) with a line drawn perpendicular to the base line at 
the same point. How do these angles compare in size? (If you know 
how to use a protractor, measure the number of degrees in the angles 
and compare them.) 
(b) Repeat the experiment, changing the position of the first pin. 
The light from the first pin goes to the mirror and is reflected 
totheeye. The angle between the ray of light which strikes the 
mirror. and a line perpendicular to the mirror at that point is 
called the angle of incidence (angle a, Figure 411). The angle 
between the reflected ray and the perpendicular is called the 
angle of reflection (angle b). From the experiment, how does 
the angle of incidence compare in size with the angle of reflection? 
Not all surfaces reflect light as well as a mirror does. The 
kind of surface determines the amount of light reflected. 
Experiment 95: How does the surface of a material affect 
the reflected light? 
Hold a piece of heavy plate glass or a shiny metal surface in 
such position that the direct rays of sunlight strike it and then come 
to your eye. The reflected light is so bright that you should look 
at it for only an instant. Now use a piece of frosted glass or a piece 
of white rough paper instead of the smooth glass, and repeat the 
experiment. In which case is the reflected light more “blinding’’? 
In which case does it seem to be more evenly distributed? 
Diffused light is soft light. You are now ready to understand 
why the light from the sky is less bright and glaring than the 
direct sunlight. The rays from the sun come to the atmosphere 
along parallel lines. Some come directly through the air to the 
earth. Others strike the small particles of air, dust, and water 
vapor and are reflected. But the surfaces of the particles are 
so irregular and turned in so many different directions that the 
rays strike them at different angles. Since the angle of inci- 
dence equals the angle of reflection for every surface, the 
reflected rays come from the particles in many directions and 
mix together, or diffuse (Figure 412). This diffused light is 
 
-P-A-G-E-455
  USING THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN 419 
“soft,” because the rays are mixed up, while the parallel rays 
from the sun are “hard” and. blinding. 
It is largely the reflected light from the sky that we depend 
upon for the natural lighting of our buildings. Coming through 
the transparent or translucent win- 
dow, it strikes various parts of the 
room and is again reflected and 
diffused, making it still softer and 
more pleasing to the eye. If it 
were not for the dust particles, the 
sky would be dark except in the 
direction of the sun, and we should 
find it necessary to have our win- 
dows in the ceiling, so that the sun- 
light could come into our rooms and Fig. 412.

into them and there be changed to 
heat instead of being partly changed to heat when it strikes 
the dust particles in the air. 
Several factors determine proper lighting. The amount of 
light which enters our rooms depends largely upon the window 
space and the kind of glass used in the windows. In order to 
provide the proper amount of light, it is generally agreed that 
the window space should be at least from one-sixth to one-fourth 
of the floor space. If it is one-fourth or more, a room may 
receive enough light even on a cloudy day. 
The amount of light which enters a room is not the only factor 
to bear in mind in correct lighting. The color of the ceiling, the 
walls, the woodwork, and the furnishings has much to do with 
proper lighting. Dark-colored materials, as you already know, 
absorb much light, while light-colored materials reflect light. 
The window space and the kind of glass in the window may, be

correctly planned for a room, and yet the interior may be so 
dark-colored that much light is absorbed. Figure 413 shows 
two rooms with the same window space but with walls and fur- 
nishings of different colors.

light-colored, there is great:

windows are the greater is the amount of light which is reflected 
from the ceiling. If the ceiling is light-colored, much light can 
be reflected from it, and the light then comes from above, prop- 
erly diffused. Diffused light from above is the most desirable 
kind; it is nature’s method of lighting, and our eyes are best 
adapted to it, for nearly all outside light comes from above. 
Since the window space, the kind of glass, the color of the 
interior, and the position of the windows in a building are 
usually such that a room receives proper lighting on cloudy days, 
awnings, curtains, and shades are commonly used to regulate 
the light on bright days, as well as to keep out the direct rays 
of the sun. Usually the curtains and shades are made of trans- 
lucent materials. Since these materials diffuse the light, they 
prevent the unpleasant and harmful reflections from direct 
sunlight. However, it should always be borne in mind that 
curtains and shades if not properly arranged may interfere 
with proper ventilation.
-P-A-G-E-457
  USING THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN 421 
The direction from which the light comes is still another 
important thing to consider. As you have learned, light from 
above is most desirable, but usually we must get much light 
from the side. In general,

shadow of the hand is thus 
avoided. It should come 
from as high above our 
work as possible, however, 
to eliminate reflections. It 
should not come from the 
source in such a way that Fig. 414. Good and Bad Positions for

(Figure 414). In factories, 
shops, laboratories, and stores where it is impossible to arrange 
materials so that they may be well lighted from one side, 
the sky-light method is always best. Saw-toothed roofs with 
windows facing north give the most satisfactory illumination, 
because the light from the north sky is thoroughly diffused 
and therefore “even” and “soft.”

    422 LIGHTING OUR BUILDINGS AND STREETS 
PROBLEM 2: HOW DO GAS LIGHTS FURNISH 
ARTIFICIAL LIGHT? 
Before he discovered how to use electricity, man obtained 
his light from fire. Various kinds of candles, lamps, and gas 
burners were employed. All of these gave light when certain 
materials in the flame were heated until they glowed, or became 
incandescent. Since every flame contains burning gas, you may 
think of gas light as including candles, kerosene lamps, gasoline 
lamps, acetylene lamps, natural-gas burners, and artificial-gas 
burners. All gas light is produced in a similar way. There is 
always some solid material in the flame which is heated to incan- 
descence. (See Experiment 56, page 239.) Our problem here, 
then, will be to understand how kerosene, gasoline, natural and 
artificial gas, and acetylene, the most common fuels for light- 
ing purposes, produce flame and light in the simple devices of 
everyday use. 
Kerosene is used for lighting. Those of you who have lived 
or visited in the country have often seen the common kerosene 
lamp shown at the right in Figure 407. The wick extends into 
the bowl. The kerosene, or coal oil as it is often called, rises 
to the top of the wick by capillarity; that is, by being attracted 
upward through the fine, thread-like openings between the 
fibers in the wick. When the lamp is lighted, the kerosene 
at the top of the wick changes to a gas, or vapor, and combines 
with the oxygen. Kerosene continues to rise in the wick so 
long as the lamp burns. As the wick slowly burns away, it 
is turned up by means of the screw at the right of the burner. 
Kerosene is a hydrocarbon compound; that is, it is composed 
of hydrogen and carbon. Since the flame does not receive 
enough oxygen and also since the temperature is not hot 
enough to burn all of the carbon of the compound, some carbon 
escapes burning and rises through the flame, where it is heated 
to incandescence. The hydrogen burns, forming water. If 
the wick is properly trimmed, if it is not turned too high, and if 
the air holes at the bottom of the burner part are kept open by 
proper cleaning, most of the carbon is burned before it escapes
-P-A-G-E-459
  USING GAS LAMPS FOR LIGHT 423 
from the top of the flame. In such case there is little smoke. 
The products of burning are, then, water and carbon dioxide. 
The more modern form of kerosene lamp is shown in Figure 
415. This is often called the circular-wick kerosene lamp, 
because the wick is circular and extends all the way around the 
burner. Sometimes this lamp is called 
the center-draft kerosene lamp. 
Exercise 4. If the kerosene lamp in Figure 
415 smokes, what may be done to stop the 
smoking? 
Exercise 5. Examine Figure 415 and ex- 
plain: (a) how the wick is adjusted; (b) how 
the flame gets air; (c) how the flame gets kero- 
sene vapor; (d) why the chimney is used over 
the flame; (e) why this lamp gives more light 
than the kerosene lamp in Figure 407. 
Gas is used in many regions. Two 
kinds of gas are used for lighting in various 
parts of our country. In certain regions 
natural gas is obtained from wells similar 
to the petroleum wells described on page ae Racine 
248. Where natural gas is not available, By thewiss oF Mande 
artificial gas is manufactured from soft of frosted glass this 
coal. (See page 246.) These two kinds Tate 
of gas are commonly used where elec- 
tricity cannot be produced or obtained at low cost. 
Two kinds of burners, the open flame and the burner fitted 
with a mantle, are the means employed for producing gas light. 
The open flame is often nothing more than a flame at the end 
of the pipe. A valve is turned to allow the gas to escape, 
and the gas is lighted. The gas is composed largely of compounds 
of two elements, hydrogen and carbon. The hydrogen burns 
with a colorless flame, but some of the carbon particles become 
heated and glow, causing a luminous flame. Sometimes a fish- 
tail flame-spreader, or “lava-tip’’ is placed in the end of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-460
  424 Heuivid OUR BUILDINGS AND STREETS 
gas pipe, as shown in Figure 416. The fish-tail burner spreads 
the flame so that it gives more light, and a frosted-glass shade 
may be placed over the flame 
to diffuse the light and make

Globe fitted with a mantle. The

It is attached to the end of 
the gas pipe. The amount of air entering at the base can be 
regulated so that all of the carbon is 
burned, and thus a very hot blue flame | 
may be produced. Over this blue flame 
is the cup- or thimble-shaped mantle 
(Figure 416) composed of a meshwork of 
the white oxides of two rare metals, 
cerium and thorium. When the mantle 
is heated, it becomes incandescent and 
gives off a very bright white light. 
Gasoline lamps are of two kinds. A 
portable gasoline lamp in quite common 
use is shown in Figure 417. The gasoline 
is contained in the tank at the top. When Deets A Portable : : asoline Lamp

allowing a little gasoline to flow out of the tube into a small

flame. The hot gases of the flame 
passing upward keep the vapori- 
zing tube at the proper tempera- 
ture to vaporize the gasoline as it 
is needed. The flame gives but 
little light because there are in 
it few solid particles of carbon, 
the gas being almost completely 
burned by the large amount of air 
admitted. A mantle makes the 
flame light-giving, or luminous. 
A second form of gasoline lamp 
(Figures 418° and 419) has the 
gasoline tank at the bottom. To 
        
operate this lamp, air is first pumped into the space above the 
gasoline, through a valve at the top of the reservoir (Figure 419),

426 LIGHTING OUR BUILDINGS AND STREETS 
by means of an ordinary bicycle pump. The vaporizing tube 
is then heated as in the case of the previously described lamp, 
the thumb-screw is turned, opening the valve, and the gas is 
lighted at the mantle, which in this form of portable lamp 
usually hangs downward. The only 
essential difference between this lamp 
and the former one is the method of 
supplying gasoline to the vaporizing 
tube. Here compressed air is used to 
force the fuel to the vaporizing tube, 
while in the former, where the reser- 
voir was above the flame, gravity 
does the work. 
For lighting entire buildings where 
many lamps are required, a gasoline- 
gas machine is used. This is much 
like the portable lamp last discussed. 
  Be a. Banorste It consists of a reservoir, tubes lead- 
Seneca ing to different rooms or different See Figure 421 for the construction of the lamp. parts of the same room, and a num- 
ber of lamps quite similar to the one 
last described. To avoid danger of fire and explosion the reser- 
voir is often placed in a small building some distance from the 
building to be lighted. For very large lighting plants a blower 
is used to force air into the reservoir. The gasoline is forced 
out through a pipe and is vaporized and mixed with air before 
it reaches the lamp. ? 
Exercise 6. Recalling your study of the Bunsen burner (page 215), 
explain why the air must be carefully regulated in a gasoline-gas 
lamp to obtain the best light from the mantle. 
Acetylene gas does not require a mantle. Acetylene gas 
furnishes a very bright white light, more nearly like sunlight 
than that of any other gas. It is made by the action of water 
on calcium carbide. One of the simplest devices which uses 
acetylene is the bicycle lamp (Figures 420 and 421). Water is 
allowed to drop from the reservoir upon the calcium carbide in

JSING ELECTRICITY FOR LIGHT 427 
the generator. The wick prevents the water from flowing too 
rapidly. The acetylene produced by the chemical action of 
the water and the calcium carbide escapes through the burner 
at the top, mixes with air, and burns with an intense white 
flame. The pressure of the gas in the reservoir forces the gas 
out of the tube at a considerable 
speed. The amount of water neces- 
sary can be regulated by a valve. 
A knowledge of the operation of 
the bicycle lamp makes it easy to 
understand how acetylene can be [iso /_s 
used for lighting buildings. The gas ™™ a

PROBLEM 3: HOW DOES ELECTRICITY GIVE LIGHT? 
Electric light has become the modern source of illumination 
where a sufficient current of electricity is available. Windmills, 
water wheels or tubines, steam engines, and gas engines run 
dynamos for furnishing electric current to light our buildings 
and streets directly, or to charge storage batteries from which 
the electric current may be obtained when needed. 
Electricity produces heat and light. Since the electricity 
obtained from dynamos is the same as that generated by cells, 
you can use.the electric current from cells to find out how 
electricity causes heat and light. You know that certain 
materials, called conductors, carry the electric current, and 
that some of these conductors, like the wires in an electric 
bulb, become very hot when the current passes through them.
-P-A-G-E-464
428 LIGHTING OUR BUILDINGS AND STREETS 
Experiment 96: Are all conductors heated equally by an 
electric current? 
(a) Attach an insulated copper wire one foot long (No. 22 to 
No. 16) to the electrodes of a dry cell. Feel the wire. Does it 
change its temperature? (If a storage battery is available, repeat 
the experiment, using the battery instead of the dry cell.) 
(b) Repeat the experiment, using the dry cell and a piece of No. 30 
insulated copper wire one foot long. Is the wire heated by the current? 
(c) If different sizes of iron wire are available, repeat the experi- 
ment, using iron wire of the same sizes as the copper wires. Note 
that the iron wires are heated much more than the copper wires. 
If you try many different conductors in this way, you find 
that some materials are heated much more than others and that 
a wire of smaller diameter always becomes hotter than a large 
wire of the same material. Also, if you use the storage battery 
or several cells to produce a strong current, you find that the 
temperature of a conductor depends upon the amount of cur- 
rent which flows through the wire. 
No material is a perfect conductor of electricity; all offer 
some resistance to the current. This electrical resistance, much 
like friction, transforms some of the electric energy into heat. 
When the resistance is great, a considerable part of the electric 
energy is changed to heat, and the conductor becomes hot. 
Table XIV shows how some. common materials vary in their 
resistance to the electric current. In this table it is understood 
that the materials are of the same diameter and length and 
that the same voltage is used to send the current through them.

USING ELECTRICITY FOR LIGHT 429 
Exercise 9. From Table XIV list the materials in the order of 
their ability to conduct an electric current, starting with silver. 
When wires or other conductors become hot enough, they 
send out light. If the conductor is heated to a very high 
temperature, the light produced is nearly white. At such 
high temperatures most materials burn; so it is necessary to 
place the conductor in a bulb which contains no oxygen. 
Edison made the first electric-light bulb. Thomas Edison 
about fifty years ago became interested in this problem of 
electric lighting, and after many years of careful study invented 
the electric, or incandescent, bulb. His scientific genius led him 
to see that the problem could be solved by the use of a filament, 
or thread, made of a material which would not easily melt or 
vaporize when heated by an electric current. He also found it 
necessary to keep air away from the filament so that it would not 
burn. With this idea in mind he sought to make a very small 
thread of carbon and to place it in a container from which the 
air could be exhausted. By making carbon filaments from 
various materials like cotton and bamboo, placing them inside 
bulbs and removing the air, and connecting the filaments with 
a source of electricity, he succeeded in perfecting an electric- 
light bulb which gave satisfactory illumination (Figure 409). 
It was in 1880 that this wonderful invention was made. 
Tungsten filaments are now used. Many improvements 
on this crude light have been made by Edison and other 
scientists. Today the much more efficient tungsten-filament 
lights are rapidly displacing those with carbon filaments. 
Experiment 97: How is the electric bulb constructed? 
(a) Examine an electric-light bulb and the socket to see how the 
electricity enters and passes through the bulb. 
(b) Observe how the filament is attached to the wires which lead 
through the glass to the outside connections. How is the filament 
suspended to make it spread over considerable space? Whyis this done? 
(c) Compare the construction of a carbon-filament light and a 
tungsten light. ;

(d) Take a “burned out’ carbon-filament bulb, place it under 
water, and break off the tip of the bulb with a pair of pliers. Why 
does the water enter the bulb? Does it completely fill with water? 
Tf not, can. you guess why it does not? 
(e) If a “burned out’ nitrogen-filled tungsten-filament bulb is 
available, repeat (d), using it instead of a carbon-filament bulb. Re- 
sult? Can you explain the result? 
The tungsten bulb is superior to the carbon bulb in both the 
amount of light produced and in the color of the light. For these 
reasons the tungsten-filament lamp has largely displaced the 
carbon lamp. It requires only about one-fourth as much elec- 
tricity to produce the same amount of light, gives a whiter light, 
and does not “burn out’’ so quickly, although it is more easily 
broken. Such lights were made possible when scientists learned 
how to draw the metal tungsten into very fine wires. 
In recent years the tungsten bulbs have been filled with gases 
like nitrogen and argon which will not combine with the fila- 
ment. The air is first removed from the bulb as completely as 
possible, and the nitrogen or argon is then introduced and the 
bulb is sealed. The presence of these gases allows the filaments 
to be heated to a higher temperature than is possible in vacuum 
bulbs without vaporizing the metal. This increases the light- 
giving qualities of the filament. While the vacuum tungsten 
bulb gives about four times as much light as the carbon bulb 
for the same cost of electricity, the gas-filled tungsten bulb 
gives about eight times as much. 
The arc lamp is very efficient. Another form of electric 
light, formerly much used for street lighting and now often 
seen in stereopticons and motion-picture machines, is the 
electric arc lamp. This lamp consists of a mechanism for hold- 
ing two carbon rods, or electrodes, connected with the ordi- 
nary lighting current (Figure 422). If the rods are brought 
into contact, end to end, the ends become very hot. If they 
are separated by from one-fourth to one-half inch, the current: 
continues to flow across the gap between the rods, conducted 
by a stream of carbon vapor. This incandescent vapor is 
 
-P-A-G-E-467
  HOW BUILDINGS ARE WIRED 431 
called the electric arc. The position of the rods can be adjusted 
by hand or controlled automatically. Sometimes the carbon rods 
have cores made of different light-giving 
materials, which vaporize and produce 
what is known as the flaming arc. The 
ordinary carbon-rod are gives about as Wyre 
much light for the same current of elec- ee 
tricity as the vacuum tungsten lamp. 
The flaming are lamp is much more 
efficient, often giving nearly twice as 
much light for the same electrical energy 
as the gas-filled tungsten lamp. Circuit

PROBLEM 4: HOW ARE BUILDINGS WIRED FOR 
ELECTRIC LIGHTING? 
Since the electric current for practical lighting comes from 
powerful dynamos or large storage batteries, we must exercise 
care in protecting ourselves from the danger of severe shocks, 
and our buildings from the danger of fire. On page 253 you found 
a list of the various ways by which electricity may cause de- 
structive fires. You now want to know, also, how the lead-in 
wires, the fuse box, and the electric lamps are connected to 
avoid danger of fire and shock, and to make it possible to have 
light from any bulb in the building by merely turning a switch 
or pressing a button.

Water passes from the dam through the penstocks to the turbines in 
the basement of the power house. The turbines turn the dynamos in the 
dynamo room above. The dynamos send the current to the step-up 
transformers, which increase the voltage of the current. This high voltage 
is carried by transmission lines for many miles to local power stations, 
where the voltage is reduced before the current goes to the residences. 
voltage of the current from the generator which 
supplies the electrical energy must be changed to 
the proper voltage for the electric lights in the 
house. The E. M. F. of the current which enters 
the building is usually 110 volts. Two heavy 
insulated wires lead to the house, one carrying the 
current into the building and the other carrying it 
back to the transformer. If the generator gives a 
current with a voltage of 110 volts, no step-down 
transformer is necessary, and the wires leading to 
the building come directly from the generator. In- 
side the wall where the wires enter the house (Fig- 
  be % 5 Fig. 424. 
ure 425) is a large switch with two fuses, as shown A Switch and 
in Figure 424, which are encased in an asbestos- Fuse 
lined box. From this switch the wires lead through the meter

   HOW BUILDINGS ARE WIRED 433 
and then to a second fuse box and switch. If the building is 
large enough, several wires lead from each pole of the second 
switch, and different pairs of these wires, one wire from each 
pole of the switch, go to the branch fuse boxes located in dif- 
ferent parts of the building. From each of these fuse boxes two

for connections of service lines. 
   wires lead to the different rooms where the lights and small wall 
switches are connected to make the circuit complete. 
All wires inside the building are usually placed inside iron 
pipes, or conduits, to prevent short-circuits. With such con- 
duits for the wires, the proper construction of fuse boxes, and 
the use of proper fuses there is little danger of fire. If a short- 
circuit is made in any way on any part of the line, the fuse 
wires, being made of a metal which melts at a low temperature, 
immediately melt and break the part of the circuit which they 
control. The fuses in the first box are large, that is, can carry
-P-A-G-E-470
   
    434 LIGHTING OUR BUILDINGS AND STREETS      a heavy current, while those in the branch fuse boxes are small. 
A short-circuit in any part of the building will, therefore, 
“burn out” the fuse in the branch box. The lights in other 
parts of the building are then not affected. 
Electric lights are usually connected in parallel. In the 
wiring of the house (Figure 425), you observe that all but the

The electric light bulbs are shown by 
the circles numbered (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), 
(6), and (7). The main wires lead down 
the hall of a building, while the branches 
go to the lamps in the rooms. The wall 
switches are shown at (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), basement lights are con- 
nected across two lead 
wires, as illustrated in Fig- 
ure 426. This method of 
connecting lamps is called 
connecting in parallel. 
You see that any lamps 
can be turned off without 
breaking the circuit in 
other lamps. 
But there is one fact 
about connecting lamps 
in parallel which you 
  and (f). Any lamp can be turned on n : : should remember; namely, without disturbing the others. that when two or more 
lamps are connected in parallel across the lead wires, they allow 
more current to flow through the line than a single lamp does. 
It works just like putting two or three pipes instead of a single 
pipe between two tanks of water. Therefore, too many lamps 
should not be connected across the lead wires from a branch 
fuse box, because the current strength would then be greater 
than the wire could carry with safety. Fuses are inserted in the 
circuit to eliminate this danger. Usually the fuses in the branch 
boxes will carry 5 or 10 amperes. Since ordinary electric bulbs 
will carry about one-half ampere on a 110-volt circuit, you see 
that 12 such lamps in parallel allow about 6 amperes to flow. 
This is more current than a five-ampere fuse can carry, and it is 
therefore necessary to have fewer lamps on the branch circuit 
or to use a fuse with greater capacity. The former plan is the 
better, because the smaller fuse offers more protection against 
a short-circuit in the line. If a heavier fuse is used, so many

electrical devices may be put in the circuit that the current may 
heat the wire enough to burn off the insulation and start a fire. 
The construction of the fuses varies for different uses. In the 
branch fuse boxes screw-plug fuses (Figure 427) are commonly 
used. If an old fuse is available, break it with a hammer and 
find the small wire inside. Hold this in a flame and note how 
easily it melts. For 
the first and second

Exercise 15. Why are electric lamps in buildings not connected

PROBLEM 5: HOW ARE THE POWER AND COST 
OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT MEASURED? 
Light is measured in candle-power. The amount of light 
which is given off by any source can be measured. Scientists 
have given us a unit for measuring the intensity of light. This 
unit is called the candle-power. It formerly signified the bright- 
ness of the flame of a sperm (whale-oil) candle, seven-eighths 
   
-P-A-G-E-472
  436 LIGHTING OUR BUILDINGS AND STREETS 
of an inch in diameter, burning at the rate of 120 grains, or 
7.77 grams, of sperm an hour. Because it is impossible to 
make candles which give exactly the same amount of light, 
scientists now use electric-light bulbs to measure candle-power. 
By the use of the unit candle-power, it is possible to measure 
the light from the different devices in our homes. A kerosene 
lamp gives from 10 to 15 candle-power, depending upon the 
size and height of the wick; an ordinary flat gas flame gives 
from 15 to 25 candle-power; a gas mantle 
~\. for. ordinary gas lighting has a candle- 
“power of from 50 to: 100; mantles on 
gasoline gas burners usually give from 
100 to 150 candle-power; incandescent 
electric bulbs vary according to the size 
of the bulb, being commonly made in 
such sizes as 4, 8, 16, 32, 60, 100, and 
as high as 1000 candle-power; an electric

exactly the candle-power of these sources. 
The power of electric light is measured in watts. In electric 
lights it is more common to state the power of the lamp in watts. 
The watt is the unit for measuring the power of the electricity 
used. One watt of power is produced when a force of one volt 
sends one ampere of current through a wire (volts times amperes 
equals watts). The kind of filament in a bulb determines how 
much light will be given when a certain electrical power is 
used. This means that the relation between watts and candle- 
power depends upon the kind of filament. 
The ordinary carbon-filament lamp requires about 3.1 watts 
per candle-power ; the tungsten lamp requires about 1.25 watts 
per candle-power; and the gas-filled tungsten requires only 
about .5 watt per candle-power. These figures are for the

ordinary 110-volt: lighting circuit. If you examine an electric 
bulb and find it marked 25 watts (25W) or 50 watts (50W), you 
can know how many candle-power it gives. If it is a 50-watt 
Mazda (gas-filled tungsten) it gives, on a 110-volt circuit, 
50 divided by about .5, or approximately 100 candle-power. 
Exercise 16. What is the candle-power of light given by a 100- 
watt carbon lamp on a 110-volt circuit? 
Exercise 17. An electric bulb (tungsten vacuum bulb) gives a 
candle-power of 80. How many units of electric power does it use? 
Exercise 18. How much current flows through a 60-watt’ lamp 
connected in a 110-volt circuit? 
Cost of artificial light is easily determined. For illuminating 
gas, the meter measures the volume used, and the cost can be 
determined. (See page 248.) In electric lighting the cost 
depends upon the amount. of electric power used, which is

distance from the

more light than a candle does because the source is brighter.

But if the lamp is far away and the candle is near, the candle 
may give more light or illumination on your table or desk. 
Let us see how the distance from a source determines the 
amount of light which comes from that source.

a cardboard which has a hole one inch square at the center (Figure 
432). Allow the light to pass through the hole in the first cardboard 
and strike a second cardboard, which is marked off in square inches 
and which is held two feet from the candle. How many square 
inches does the beam of light cover on the second cardboard? Move 
the second cardboard three feet from the candle. How many square 
inches of space are covered by the beam of light? 
From the experiment you learn that a beam of light which 
is one square inch in cross-section at a distance of one foot from 
the source spreads until it covers four square inches at a dis- 
tance of two feet, and nine square inches at a distance of three 
feet from the source. If the same light spreads over more space, 
the illumination must be less. At a distance of two feet the 
space covered by the beam is twice as long and twice as broad,

| 
or four times as large as at a distance of one foot. Similarly, at 
a distance of three feet it is three times as long and three times 
as broad, or nine times as large. You see that a light gives only 
one-fourth as much illumination at a distance of two feet as it 
does at a distance of one foot. Similarly, at a distance of three 
ea feet it gives only one- 
f ninth as much as it 
ass) does at one foot from 
the source.

distance from the source. 
In artificial lighting, as in natural lighting, the amount of 
light in a room is of no greater importance than the softness of 
the light. The correct amount of diffused light is the best 
possible for the eye. It is this which you should always try 
to obtain, especially for reading. But remember that the 
direction from which the light comes is also important. (See 
page 421.) 
Several methods of lighting are employed. Three common 
methods of lighting rooms with electric lights are the direct 
method, the semi-direct, and the indirect method (Figure 433). 
In the first method the light comes directly from the source to 
the table or place of work. The bulb may be made of frosted 
glass to diffuse the light, or it may be a plain glass bulb. In 
either case the light may be glaring and unpleasant or tiresome 
 
-P-A-G-E-477
REGULATING ARTIFICIAL LIGHT 441 
to the eye. Little light is wasted in this way, however. Shades 
or reflectors may be used to make the light more intense. 
In the semi-direct method a translucent frosted bowl is placed 
under the lamp. Some of the light passes through the bowl and 
is diffused; some is reflected by the 
bowl to the ceiling and then comes 
back to the room. This combination of 
diffused light and diffused reflected 
light is pleasing to the eye. It tires 
the eye far less than the light received

the room. It is all reflected to the 
ceiling and then comes back into the room. The ceiling is of 
such material and color that the light is thoroughly diffused 
and quite white. It is the nearest approach to diffused sun- 
light and is, therefore, very soft and pleasing to the eye. The 
same effect is produced in many modern buildings by placing 
the lights in recesses around the top of the walls of the room. 
The light is then reflected from the ceiling, no light coming di- 
rectly from the source to the eye or to the lower part of the room.

do you consider most economical from a financial standpoint? From a

THE STORY OF UNIT XVI 
Communication is the means by which man has learned to 
live with others. Without the ability to speak, write, and read 
little progress could be made. Man would find it necessary to 
live unto himself, for he could not learn from others nor could 
he give his ideas to others. Under such conditions he could not 
hope to understand nature’s forces and materials; neither could 
he give to future generations the results of his thinking.

  face or noises which showed 
fear, surprise, anger, or other 
emotions. Later he came to 
use his hands and head to make 
signs which carried meaning to 
his companions. Pointing or 
beckoning with the hand was, 
perhaps, one of the earliest 
ways of giving crude directions 
and of conveying thought to 
others. 
Through the many centuries 
there gradually developed va- 
rious other methods of com- 
munication. Man learned to 
use his voice. This resulted 
in a spoken language, which 
was in its early stages un- 
doubtedly little more than 
grunts. During the same time 
crude methods of picture- 
writing and of making sym- 
bols for ideas led to a written 
language (Figure 435). In 
time, speaking and writing, as 
we know them today, became 
man’s means of intercourse.

After some centuries of im- 
provement in printing, we have today complicated typesetting 
machines and great printing presses for preparing books, maga- 
zines, and newspapers in an efficient way (Figure 437). From

knowledge of the past generations, as well as by the knowledge 
of what people of his own time all over the world are thinking 
and doing. Progress can be 
made to the extent that such 
intercourse is carried on. 
Another equally difficult 
problem had to be solved 
by man. With the develop- 
ment of speaking, writing, 
and printing he had to find 
ways by which his spoken 
or written ideas could be 
carried quickly from one 
lace to another, for, by

flashes of light, and other crude ways were no longer practical. 
Runners and riders could carry messages at considerable speed 
to other communities (Figure 438), but these ways were in 
time replaced by more modern methods. The growth of roads, 
railroads, and steamships helped to solve the problem by carry- 
ing the messages, or mail, great distances in a short time.

Fig. 438. The Pony Express 
The rider is off with the mail for villages or settlements across the plains. 
Even with the development of methods of rapid transporta- 
tion the world demanded still more speedy means of com- 
munication. Newspapers, letters, magazines, and books could 
be transported by road, rail, and water, but the more urgent 
messages of business and of world affairs, and the need for 
spreading news more rapidly required better methods of inter- 
course between communities. One force or energy which had not 
been used was electricity. Here was a possibility, and men be- 
gan to seek for and to find ways to use it. 
On May 24, 1844, and on June 7, 1875, two historic messages 
were sent by electricity. The first was the message by telegraph 
from Washington to Baltimore, ‘““What hath God wrought?” 
Samuel F. B. Morse had proved to the public the success of

Watson, “Mr. Watson, please come here; I want you.’’ Morse 
and Bell had made use of the previous electric discoveries of 
many scientists, and had given us two of the greatest inventions 
of the nineteenth century. 
When you include with these two inventions the electric 
buzzer, the electric bell, the ocean cables, and radio, you can 
understand how electric communication has completely changed 
man’s way of living and carrying on his business. The earlier 
means of communication, such as messengers on foot or on

horseback, puffs of smoke from hill tops, and even mail for 
important messages, have given way to the current of elec- 
tricity through wires and the waves of wireless. News, warnings 
of forest fires, floods, and frosts, weather forecasts, correct time, 
train dispatches, stock and market reports, distress (SOS) 
calls by ships, greetings, and business messages are but a few of

the many communications for which electricity is used (Figure 
441). How different the activities of our daily life would be 
without these modern methods of sending messages, and how 
little you would know of the great world in which you live! 
In this unit you will study the ways of sending messages by 
electricity. If space permitted, we should consider other im- 
portant methods of communication, such as printing, the mail 
service, and codes of various kinds. These you may read about 
in encyclopedias and in other reference books. They will furnish 
excellent subjects for reading at your leisure. 
Before you begin the study of the problems of this unit, you 
should have a general idea of the different methods of electric
-P-A-G-E-485
  SENDING MESSAGES BY TELEGRAPH 449 
communication. All of these are alike in certain respects. There 
are four essential parts in every system of sending messages by 
electricity. First, there must be a source of electric energy, such 
as the cell or dynamo. Second, some means of carrying the 
electric current from one place to another is necessary. This 
may be a set of wires, as in the doorbell or the ordinary tele- 
graph or telephone, or it may be merely space, even a vacu- 
um, as in the wireless or radio. Third, it is necessary to have 
some device for sending the message, such as the push- 
button of the doorbell, the key of the telegraph, the trans- 
mitter or mouthpiece of the telephone, or the microphone 
and transmitting apparatus of the wireless. And fourth, there 
must be some device to receive the message. Thus, a door- 
bell rings when the push-button is pressed; the telegraph 
receiver or sounder reproduces the dots and dashes of the 
sending-key; the telephone receiver reproduces the voice 
or sounds which set up electric currents in the transmitter; 
and the receiving set of the radio picks up the waves sent 
out by the sending station and reproduces the dots and dashes 
of the sending-key or the sounds which are made before the 
microphone or telephone in front of which the speaker or singer 
in the broadcasting station stands. 
To summarize, every system of electric communication 
consists of four essential parts: (1) a source of electric cur- 
rent, (2) material or space for carrying the electric energy, 
(3) a device to send the energy through the line or space, (4) a 
device for receiving the energy and changing it to sound waves. 
PROBLEM 1: HOW ARE MESSAGES SENT OVER WIRES 
BY TELEGRAPH? 
Since the invention of the early telegraph, shown with its 
inventor in Figure 440, many improvements have been made. 
Let us see how the telegraph works. 
In modern telegraphic communication the operator takes the 
message from the click of the sounder. Figure 442 shows the 
instruments and connections necessary for a simple telegraph.  
-P-A-G-E-486
    450 COMMUNICATING WITH OUR NEIGHBORS 
When the key is in the circuit with the key switch open, and 
the lever of the key is pressed down, the current from the 
battery comes to one binding post of the key, flows through 
the metal frame to the contact points, and then to the other 
  bitidi eg inp and through the wire to the binding post of the 
sounder. "From here it goes around the coil of the horseshoe

away from the magnet. As it 
moves upward, it strikes the screw above and produces a faint 
click. The time between the downward click and the upward 
click varies as the time during which the contact points of the 
key are in contact. If the interval is short, it is called a dot; if 
long, it is called a dash. These dots and dashes are sent in 
various combinations to represent letters, numbers, and even 
entire words or ideas. Such.combinations are known as code, 
and they make up code messages. 
Two systems of code are shown in Table XV. The early code 
used in this country was known as the American Morse Code. 
This is still used by land telegraph stations in our country. 
The International Morse Code, or Continental Code, is used           
 
-P-A-G-E-487

for land telegraphy in all foreign countries, and by all radio 
stations the world over. Note that in the American Morse there 
are spaces between the dots for the letters C, O, R, Y, and 
Z. These spaces make sending and receiving very difficult 
unless the spacing is carefully done at the key by the sender. 
In the other code only dots and dashes are used. This arrange-

SENDING MESSAGES BY TELEGRAPH 453 
The telegraph system between two stations requires a key and 
a sounder in each station. The arrangement for short distances 
is shown in Figure 445. A cell, or battery of cells, furnishes the 
electric current. The switches on the keys are kept closed. 
When an operator at Station A wishes to send a message to B, he 
opens his key switch, sends the call signal to B, and then closes 
his key switch. Station B then opens his switch, signals A to 
send the message, and closes his switch to receive A’s message. 
Exercise 1. Explain why the switches must be opened and closed 
as described in the preceding paragraph.

Experiment 100: How can you set up a telegraph line 
between two stations? 
With two cells, two keys, two sounders, and the necessary wire 
set up a telegraph system between two rooms or between two houses. 
You can use two wires, or one wire and the ground, to complete the 
circuit. Attaching the ground wire to a gas pipe or water pipe will 
serve as a ground or earth connection. 
Relays are necessary in a long-distance set. For long-dis- 
tance communication the simple set which you have just made 
will not work. The resistance of the long wire to the flow of 
electricity is so great that a few cells cannot send enough cur- 
rent to operate the sounder. To overcome this difficulty, the 
relay is used in each station, and the connections are made as in

Exercise 3. Does the relay strengthen the local circuit? Explain 
your answer. 
Exercise 4.. Why are the wires “grounded” at the local stations? 
PROBLEM 2: HOW DO THE ELECTRIC BELL AND 
ELECTRIC BUZZER WORK? 
The electric bell and buzzer save man many steps. By 
merely pressing a push-button one may ring a bell or sound a 
buzzer, calling for service or announcing one’s presence. A 
single push-button may be used to ring several 
bells, or a single bell may be rung by any one of 
a number of push-buttons located in different 
parts of the building. There are hundreds of \ 
uses of these simple methods of communication. 
The simplest bell is a single-stroke bell (Figure 
448). When the circuit is closed by pressing the 
push-button, the current flows through the elec- 
tromagnet, which immediately draws the arma- 
ture to the magnet, causing the clapper attached 
to the armature to strike the bell. The armature

the buzzer device, the rapid vibration of the armature causes 
the buzzing sound. The speed of the vibration can be con- 
trolled by changing the distance between the contact points. 
If this distance is great, more time is required for the vibrator 
to move, and it vibrates less rapidly, causing a low pitch, or 
note; if the distance is small, the buzzer has a high pitch.

How can the voice be sent over the telephone? The answer is, 
“Tt cannot.” How, then, can you hear the person at the other

the mouth, you would notice two chords of strong tissue (Figure 
450). These are called the vocal chords and are controlled by 
muscles. When they are stretched, and the air from the lungs 
is forced through them, they vibrate and cause sound waves to 
be set up in the air. 
Experiment 102: How is sound produced? 
(a) Strike a tuning-fork on the table. Hold it near your ear. Now 
look at it closely and ob-

glass of water until it 
touches the water (Figure 
451). What happens? 
(6) Stretch a short wire 
tightly (Figure 452). Pick 
or snap the wire at one end. Does the vibrating wire 
produce sound? Can you see and hear the wire vibrate 
after picking it? Add more weights to the free end of the wire 
and try again. Result?

The vibration of a string or a tuning-fork produces sound. 
You can understand then how the vocal cords produce sound

= The pitch of the sound de- 
pends upon how rapidly the 
cords vibrate. If you stretch 
a rubber band (Figure 453) 
and pick it, a sound of a cer-

stretch the band more tightly, 
the pitch is higher. In the

air from the lungs then sets them in rapid vibration, causing 
a high note. Or they

throat and mouth and 
the position of tongue 
and teeth make a dif-

(a) Strike one tuning-fork on the table and quickly hold it near 
another tuning-fork of the same pitch. Bring the second tuning-fork 
to your ear, and you find that it is now 
vibrating. The vibrations of the first fork 
set up air vibrations which in turn caused 
the second fork to vibrate. (You can do 
the same experiment by using two stretched 
wires having the same pitch.) 
(6) Get the pitch of a certain piano 
string. Then sing loudly the syllable O, 
in the same pitch, while the loud pedal 
of the piano is being pressed down so 
that the string is free to vibrate (Figure

the string vibrate. (You can do this with any stringed instrument.) 
Sound waves make the telephone possible. The simplest 
form of telephone is shown in Figure 456. The mouthpiece, or 
transmitter, is connected to a cell and a receiver. When some- 
one speaks into the transmitter, the air waves cause a thin

the receiver exactly like those caused by the speaker’s voice. 
The air waves strike the listener’s ear (Figure 456), and he 
hears the speaker’s words.

Now let us see more fully how the different parts of the 
ordinary telephone work. Figure 457 shows the various nec- 
essary instruments and connections of a telephone between two 
stations. At each station there are a battery, a transmitter, an 
induction coil or 
transformer, and 
a receiver. Note 
that the trans- 
mitter, battery, 
and primary coil 
| make one circuit 
rv m at each station,

The line between stations goes through the cen- ceivers and the 
traltelephone exchange. Inthe telephone the primary secondar’ coils 
coil is inside the secondary coil of the transformer ¥ oe 
of the induction 
coils are all on one circuit separate from the transmitter circuits. 
The telephone transmitter changes sound to electric energy. 
The transmitter is constructed as shown in Figure 458. The 
current from the local battery flows to the metal dise, or dia- 
phragm, then through the carbon particles in the little cylindri- 
cal box which is made of a non-conducting material, to the 
metal back of the transmitter, and then through the primary 
coil of the induction coil and back to the battery. 
When someone speaks into the transmitter, the vocal chords 
set up sound waves in the air (Figure 456), which strike the 
diaphragm and make it vibrate, just as the piano string in 
Experiment 103 was set in vibration by the voice. The dia- 
phragm is so sensitive that it vibrates according to the pitch 
and the quality of the sound. Since the carbon particles rest 
against the diaphragm, the vibration increases and decreases 
the pressure between the carbon particles. The current which 
flows through the transmitter varies according to the pressure, 
for, when the pressure is greater and the particles are in closer 
contact, the resistance is decreased and more current can flow 
through them. When the pressure is less and the contact 
between the particles is not so great, less current can flow. Receiver Lines

HOW THE TELEPHONE OPERATES 461 
The sound waves cause the current in the transmitter circuit 
to vary in strength because of the vibration of the diaphragm. 
The primary coil therefore rapidly changes in its magnetic 
power as the current through it changes. Thus, lines of magnetic 
force move out- 
ward as the mag- 
netism increases 
and inward when 
the magnetism 
decreases. These 
rapid changes in 
the lines of force 
which pass over the Fig. 458. The Transmitter

inonedirectionand at the right. The wires lead to the battery and 
then in the other, au o ne Covers 
cause an alternating electric current to flow in the secondary 
coil. Since there are many turns of wire in the secondary coil, 
the force, or voltage, of the electric current produced therein is 
greater than that in the pri- 
mary coil. This greater force 
can then send the electric 
current through the wire to 
the receiver miles away. 
However, the force of the 
current in the secondary-coil 
circuit varies in strength 
on account of the varying

important points. The transmitter speaking-tube receives the 
sound waves of the air set up by the vocal cords; the diaphragm

changes of pressure on the carbon particles; the changes of 
pressure cause the changes in the electric current through the 
primary coil of the induction coil; the variation of the current 
in the primary coil increases and decreases the current of 
greater force set up in the secondary coil; the varying current 
in the secondary coil and line causes differences in the strength 
of the magnetism in the coil around the magnet in the receiver;

as the transmitter diaphragm vibrates; these vibrations. start 
air waves like those of the speaker’s voice; these air waves

PROBLEM 4: HOW ARE WIRELESS MESSAGES SENT? 
Samuel F. B. Morse and Alexander Graham Bell are men 
who will always remain famous for their great inventions. 
Guglielmo Marconi, an Italian scientist, is, however, equally 
famous. In 1896, Marconi, a young man of 21 years, sent a 
message without the use of wires over a distance of two miles. 
While other men had proved that wireless messages were pos- 
sible, Marconi made such important improvements in this 
 
-P-A-G-E-500
    464 COMMUNICATING WITH OUR NEIGHBORS 
field that he must be given credit for his great inventions. 
Since that time many improvements have been made on the 
radio sending and receiving devices. Today millions of receiving 
sets are in use in our country, taking from space the messages, 
speeches, and music sent out by the thousands of sending sets. 
Hundreds of “‘broadcasting stations” add to the education 
and enjoyment of those who are fortunate enough to be able 
to build or purchase receiving sets, and who know how to 
“tune in’? on the various sending stations. 
Electric energy travels as particles and waves. To begin 
our understanding of radio, or wireless telegraphy and teleph- 
ony, let us see how electricity travels from one place to 
another. Any wire or conductor contains millions of small 
particles of electricity, or electrons. When these electrons are 
set in motion along the wire, we say the current is flowing. 
When the wire is attached to a cell or a dynamo, these so-called 
“generators” of electricity force the electrons to move, much 
as a pump forces water through a pipe. Thus by means of a 
key or a push-button we can complete a circuit, and the cell 
or dynamo which is connected in the circuit will pump electrons 
along the wire. At any point along the wire electrons will then 
be moving, and we have an electric current. 
In radio there are no conductors or wires to carry the cur- 
rent from the sending set to the receiving set. It is not well 
understood how this transmission takes place, but you can imag- 
ine something like this: The sending set sends out waves 
of electric energy similar to the magnetic lines of force around 
an electromagnet. These electric waves travel outward from 
the sending station in all directions. They travel through space 
in much the same way that waves move outward along the sur- 
face of water when a stone is thrown into a pond. There is one 
important difference, however, between water waves and radio 
waves: the former move outward in circles, while the latter 
move outward in spheres. That is, radio waves move in all 
directions from the sending set, just as sound waves move in 
all directions from a bell. (See page 458.) How these electric
-P-A-G-E-501
  MESSAGES BY WIRELESS 465 
waves are set in motion through space you will understand 
better by examining a simple sending set. 
A simple buzzer sending set is easily made. A simple send- 
ing set like that shown in Figure 462 may be used to send wire- 
less messages over 
  short distances. The 
set consists of a few Aerial 
electric cells, a key, an 
induction coil with a ie 
vibrator, an aerial, and Bite canteen ty 
a spark-gap. If you \ eons 
  : Vibrator examine the figure “ss 
carefully, you will see 
    
        that the cells are con- js HAC 
nected in cireuit with cones eu ye 
the key, the vibrator Batter 7 => Water Pipe 
of the induction coil, 
and the inner coil of 
the induction — coil. 
Note that the induc- 
tion coil consists of two coils. The inner one has a few turns of 
heavy insulated wire. It is called the primary coil because it is 
connected with the battery. The outer coil consists of many 
turns of fine insulated wire. This is the secondary coil. It is con- 
nected with the spark-gap, the aerial, and the ground. The wires 
of the primary and secondary coils are not in the same circuit. 
The primary circuit induces a current in the secondary coil. 
When the key is closed, the cells are connected in the circuit 
and force electrons through the key, wire, vibrator, contact 
point, primary coil, and the wire leading back to the cells. As 
soon as these electrons move in the primary coil, it becomes a 
magnet. The soft iron core of the magnet increases the mag- 
netism of the coil. The vibrator, being made of iron, is attracted 
to the core. This separates the vibrator from the contact point, 
breaking the circuit. No current can now flow, and the electro- 
magnet at once loses its magnetism. The spring of the vibrator Fig. 462. A Buzzer Sending Set 
If an induction coil is available, examine 
it to see how it works.
-P-A-G-E-502
      466 COMMUNICATING WITH OUR NEIGHBORS 
forces the vibrator back against the contact point, making the 
circuit once more. Immediately electrons start to flow again, 
since the cells are now connected in the circuit. The primary 
coil and core are again magnetized, and the vibrator is again 
pulled over, breaking the circuit. Thus the vibrator moves 
back and forth between the contact point and core, making 
and breaking the circuit many times each second. 
The sudden making of the primary circuit by the vibrator 
causes electrons to start moving and to flow rapidly through the 
wires of the primary coil for a moment. Then, the sudden 
breaking of the circuit immediately cuts off the cell (the pump), 
and the electrons slow down and stop. As the electrons start 
to move, they cause magnetic lines of force to move outward 
from the primary coil across the wires of the secondary coil. 
These magnetic lines of force cause the millions of electrons in 
the wires of the secondary coil to start moving, thus causing a 
current to flow in the secondary coil. Because there are many 
turns of wire in the secondary coil and because the magnetic 
lines of force come outward at such great speed, the electrons 
in the secondary wire are set in motion with great force. This 
produces a current with a high voltage. (See page 461.) 
At the breaking of the primary circuit, the electrons in this 
circuit slow down and stop. The magnetic lines of force now 
move inward toward the primary coil across the secondary coil 
wires. Thus they cut across these wires in the opposite direc- 
tion from that during the making of the primary circuit. This 
causes the electrons in the secondary coil to reverse their di- 
rection. You can see, then, that the current in the secondary 
coil flows in one direction one moment and in the reverse direc- 
tion the next moment. The alternating current thus set up, 
or induced, in the secondary coil has a much higher voltage, or 
force, than the current in the primary circuit, and alternates 
very rapidly because of the rapid making and breaking of the 
primary circuit by the vibrator. 
The secondary circuit sends out waves of electric energy. 
Now if you examine Figure 462 again, you will see that this
-P-A-G-E-503
  MESSAGES BY WIRELESS 467 
secondary coil is connected to 
the spark-gap, and that one 
ball of the spark-gap is con- 
nected to the aerial while the 
other is connected to the earth 
by means of the water pipe. 
The high voltage of the cur- 
rent set up in the secondary 
coil causes the electrons to leap 
across the spark-gap at a tre- 
mendous’ speed, producing 
sparks like lightning. (Since 
the voltage is so high, one 
should be careful not to place 
the hand near the induction 
coil or spark-gap while the 
spark is passing.) 
The sparks leap back and forth 
at such tremendous rate that 
the electrons in the aerial, the 
ground wire, and secondary coil 
are caused to alternate their 
direction millions of times a 
second. We say the current oscil- 
lates at high frequency, meaning 
that the direction of the current 
changes many, many times a 
second. Such rapid movement 
of the electrons in the aerial sets 
up waves in the space around 
the aerial. These waves then 
move outward across space. 
The distance which they travel 
depends upon the voltage of the 
secondary circuit and the atmos- 
pheric conditions. Parts Symbols

Since the waves are set up only when the key is pressed down, 
or closed, it is possible to send out the waves for short or long 
intervals, like the dots and dashes of a telegraph code. The 
waves of short and long intervals may be detected, or “picked 
up,” by a receiving set and heard as short or long buzzes in the 
head phones. The message sent with the 
key may, therefore, be understood by 
anyone who knows the code. 
There are many different kinds of send- 
ing sets. The sending sets for the radio- 
telephone used in broadcasting stations 
are far too complicated to study here. It 
is enough for us to know that they send 
out waves through space. The waves are, 
: however, changed somewhat by the voice 
i eee coe or music which enters the transmitter of 
| the telephone connected to the sending set. 
(See Figure 456, page 459.) The sounds in the sending sta- 
tion strike the telephone transmitter membrane, or trans- 
mitter, and change the radio waves in much the same way that 
sound changes the electric current in the ordinary telephone. 
Because different stations send waves of different lengths, it 
is necessary for us to “tune” our receiving sets so that we 
may be able to listen to the station which we wish to hear. 
Then our set can reproduce the changes in the waves caused 
by the voice or music at the broadcasting station, and we can 
enjoy the speech or concert.

PROBLEM 5: HOW DO SIMPLE RADIO RECEIVING 
SETS WORK? 
A very simple set will receive code messages. One of the 
simplest receiving sets with which you may hear code messages 
like those described in Problem 4 is shown in Figure 465. It 
consists of an aerial, a 
crystal detector, a pair of 
head phones or a tele- 
phone receiver, and the 
necessary connections. 
If such a set is “hooked 
up” in a room adjoining 
the room in which a 
sending set like that de- 
scribed in Problem 4 is a 
located, messages sent rte ad

may be heard. ae The necessary parts can be obtained at 
This simple receiving any radio store. 
set is easily set up. 
The aerial is either insulated or bare copper wire stretched 
across the room. Number 18 or Number 20 wire will serve. 
One end of the wire is left free; the other is attached to a 
water pipe. The head phones or receiver should have a resist- 
ance of more than 1000 ohms. The crystal detector and the 
phones are connected to the aerial wire as shown in the figure. 
The crystal is made of a mineral called galena. Directly above 
the crystal is a small wire which completes the circuit through 
the crystal detector when it touches the crystal. It may be 
necessary to shift the wire until it touches a certain part of 
the crystal before a signal can be heard in the phones. This 
part of the crystal is commonly called the ‘‘sensitive spot.” 
Let us see how this set works. You remember that the waves 
of electric energy which come through space from the sending 
set are caused by “high-frequency oscillations,’”’ or very rapid 
alternations of the electrons in the aerial of the sending set. Aerial

Some electrons would os- 
cillate in the branch circuit 
inwhich the crystal detector 
and phones are connected, 
except for the fact that such 
high-frequency alternations 
cannot pass through coils 
like those inside the phones. 
Moreover, the crystal has 
the property of allowing a 
current to pass through in 
one direction only. This 
direct current can flow 
through the phones. Since 
this current through the 
phones varies in strength 
because of the waves which 
strike the aerial, it causes 
the diaphragm of the head phones to vibrate, producing a buzz- 
like noise. The length of each buzz corresponds to the inter- 
val during which the key at the sending set is 
closed. Thus, short and long buzzes may be sent

this set it is possible 
to receive code or telephone messages from stations within a few 
miles, and to listen to one station without hearing other stations 
at the same time. The set consists of an aerial, a coil (called 
a “double-slide tuning-coil’”’), a ground wire, a condenser, a 
crystal detector, and head phones. The aerial may be placed 
in the house or outside, or bed springs may be used as an aerial 
if the sending station is a powerful one and is only a few miles 
away. If the aerial is placed outside the house, a lightning 
arrester should be used to prevent the danger of fire. The parts 
for the coil may be purchased at a radio store, and the coil can 
be wound, or the entire coil may be bought. Figure 468 shows 
how to make the connections. 
In order to listen to a broadcasting or code-sending station, 
the receiving set must be ‘“tuned’’; that is, it must be properly 
adjusted. The wire of the crystal detector must be on a sensitive 
spot, and the slides must be moved until they are in the correct    Telephone Crystal ——

position and the message is clearly heard in the head phones. 
The “tuning in” on any station may require considerable 
patience at the first attempt. Thereafter it is easy to do, since 
the positions of the slides for a 
certain sending station change 
but little from time to time. 
Note that there are two cir- 
cuits. The aerial circuit consists 
Y of the aerial, some turns of the 
tuning coil, one of the slides, and 
the ground wire. This is known 
as the primary circuit. The de- 
x tector circuit, often called the 
secondary circuit, consists of (1) 
a wire leading from the post of 
the coil to which the aerial is con- 
nected, (2) the crystal detector, 
(3) the phones, (4) a wire leading 
Telephone to the other slide, and (5) some 
turns of the coil. A condenser is

contact in this circuit is properly set. These oscillations cause 
similar oscillations in the part of the coil which is in the secon- 
dary circuit, if the slide contact in this circuit is in the correct 
position, but the crystal allows the electrons to flow through 
it in one direction only. Thus, if you have properly tuned in 
on a code-sending set, a varying direct current passes through 
the crystal and phones and causes the diaphragms in the head 
phones to vibrate and send out buzzes. Or, if the sending

set is a telephone sending station, the diaphragms vibrate just 
as the membrane in the transmitter at the sending station vi- 
brates, and you hear the speech or the music. 
Exercise 12. Figure 469 shows the symbols for the instruments 
in the coil crystal-detector set. Draw a “hook-up” of the set, using 
the symbols, and label the parts. 
PROBLEM 6: HOW IS A SIMPLE VACUUM-TUBE

The vacuum-tube receiver (Figure 470) is more commonly 
used than the sets previously described. It has three important

advantages over simpler and less expensive crystal sets. First, 
sending stations at a greater distance may be heard. Second, the 
sounds in the sending station are reproduced much more loudly. 
Third, it tunes better, making it possible to “tune in” any send- 
station without so much interference from other stations. It is 
therefore more selective than the crystal receiving set. 
All of the parts for this set may be purchased at any radio 
store. If a three-cell storage battery is used as the A battery, a

six-volt tube is needed; if the A battery is a dry cell, a one-and- 
one-half-volt tube is used; if the A battery consists of three 
dry cells connected in series, it will operate a 4.5-volt tube. 
The B battery has a voltage of 22.5 volts. The radio dealer will 
know the kind of in- 
struments necessary 
to make the set. 
To operate the 
set, the rheostat is 
turned until the

are turned to different positions. If no sending station is 
heard during this operation, the small arm is turned to another 
tap, and the moving of the dials is repeated. With a little 
patience and perseverance a station may be detected, although 
it may be necessary to move the rheostat to a different position 
and repeat the other operations. The best way to learn how 
to operate the set, once it is properly connected as shown in the 
figure, is patiently to turn to various positions the knobs or 
dials of the rheostat, the variable condenser, the switch arm, 
and the variable coupler. Once a station is heard, it can always 
be found again if you remember the position of the dials. If 
you operate a radio set, keep a record, or log, of the position 
of each dial for the various stations. 
How the set works is not easy to explain. It would require 
many pages to tell the whole story. Anyone who is interested 
can find sets like this described in simple books on the subject 
of radio.

           If you compare life today with life one hundred years ago, 
you realize that our present mode of living is possible only as 
the result of a speedier and more dependable method of trans- 
portation. What today are considered the necessities of life 
were regarded then as luxuries because of the time and the 
expense involved in obtaining them. Your clothing, your food, 
and your home present ample evidence of the value of trans- 
portation. You eat oranges from California, dates from Egypt, 
nuts from Brazil, wheat from Kansas, and cheese from New 
York. Your clothing may have grown on a sheep’s back in 
Australia. Your house may be constructed of lumber from 
Michigan, stone from Iowa, and glass from West Virginia, and 
furnished with materials which have come from all parts of the

Today our land vehicles are propelled by steam, gas, and 
electrical power. The first inventor who succeeded in propelling 
a vehicle by steam was Cugnot, a French army officer, in 1769. 
His machine (Figure 477) traveled on ordinary roads at the 
rate of three or four 
miles an hour, and 
had to stop every 
ten minutes to get 
up steam. This does 
not appear to have 
been very much of 
a success, but it is 
important because 
it proved that vehi- 
cles could be pro-

finally the first suc-

Stephenson, an Englishman, in 1829. The first practical railroad 
in the United States was built in 1831, and in 1869 the first

transcontinental railroad was constructed. Since that time the 
steam locomotive has been greatly improved, electric loco- 
motives have come into use, and new inventions, such as the 
air-brake and the automatic signal, have greatly increased 
the safety of railroad travel. 
The rise of the gasoline automobile to its present importance 
has been one of the greatest achievements of our modern age.

One of the far-reaching results of the invention of the auto-

possible to go hundreds of miles without being forced to travel 
on dirt. In some parts of the country the automobile is

successfully competing with the steam railroad both in carry- 
ing passengers and in hauling freight. Its extensive use on 
the farm and in the city has solved many of our transportation 
problems. 
Electric cars have also proved very practical for street rail- 
ways and for short lines between cities. Recently electric trains 
have been operated successfully in mountainous regions where 
water power is plentiful for generating electricity (Figure 479). 
At the present time the production of electricity is so expen- 
sive that it cannot successfully compete with steam when long 
distances must be traversed. In the years to come the water 
power of our country will be more fully utilized to produce  
-P-A-G-E-518
  482 TRANSPORTATION 
cheaper electrical power, and this method of transportation 
will be more fully developed. 
Transportation by water has also undergone many changes 
since man first learned this method of travel. It is not 
known when he first discovered that rivers and other bodies 
of water could be 
crossed by means of 
rafts or hollowed-out 
tree trunks. Prob- 
ably man’s first at- 
tempt at navigation 
was astride a tree 
trunk, which sup- 
ported his weight 
but did not allow 
him to carry his be- 
longings with him 
(Figure 480). Not 
satisfied with this, he must have thought of binding several trunks 
together so that he could carry a load. It was probably later 
than this that the hollowed-out tree trunk, or ‘“dug-out,”’ came 
into use. The dug-out enabled man to travel faster than he 
could on the clumsy raft, but it cut down the size of his load. 
Since these first discoveries, man has constantly tried to produce 
boats which could carry heavy loads, and at the same time, 
could be easily propelled through the water. The attempt to 
combine the useful characteristics of the raft and those of the 
dug-out has resulted in the many kinds of boats which we 
have today. 
Not only has man learned to build larger and larger ships and 
to construct them out of strong materials, such as iron and 
steel, but he has also greatly improved his method of driving 
them through the water. For several thousand years man con- 
tented himself with propelling his boat by hand. The galleys 
used in the time of the Romans were driven through the water 
mainly by huge oars manned by slaves. The earliest example

crossing large bodies of water.

scene carved on the walls of a temple about 2800 B. c. Long 
before that time man had probably discovered that the force 
of the wind could be used to drive small boats. But he was 
first obliged to discover how the sails could be attached to 
the boat, how to shift his sails to meet the winds from differ- 
ent directions, and 
then to construct 
his boat so that the 
force of the wind 
would not upset it. 
Man power and 
wind power fur-

means of propelling 
boats until the lat- 
ter part of the 
      
eighteenth century. Keystone View Co.

were made, but the 
honor of constructing the first practical steamboat goes to 
Robert Fulton, who ran the steamship Clermont up the Hudson 
River on August 17, 1807 (Figure 481). The early steamships 
were propelled by paddle wheels of a type generally used 
on inland waters today. The first boat to use the screw 
propeller was the Robert F. Stockton, in 1839. Since that time 
the screw propeller has entirely replaced the paddle wheel on 
ocean-going boats and on many lake boats. On small boats, 
the fuel oil engine and the electric motor have taken the 
place of the heavier steam engine, especially in lake and river 
transportation. 
The great changes which have taken place in water trans- 
portation can be summarized by comparing the flag-ship of 
Columbus with a modern ocean liner. The Santa Maria was

63 feet long and 20 feet wide (Figure 482). It depended en- 
tirely on wind power and could carry only about 150 tons. 
A crew of 52 men was required to man it. Columbus made his 
first trip across the Atlantic 
in about two months. One 
of our modern great ocean 
liners (Figure 483) is 920 
feet long and 100 feet wide. 
It can carry a load of 30,000 
tons. A crew of over a 
thousand is required to care 
for the passengers and to run 
it, and in addition it carries 
over 4500 passengers. Only 
five days are required to 
cross the Atlantic between 
Southampton and New 
York City. In carrying ca-

As far back as the Middle Ages men began to wonder if there 
was not some material which could float in the air like a ship 
upon the water. It was not, however, until 1783 that the 
first balloon was invented. The Montgolfier brothers, who 
lived in France, had observed the clouds which floated in the 
air, and they conceived the idea of filling a bag with a cloud 
of smoke (Figure 484). This they did, and to their great satis- 
faction, the bag ascended. Their next step was to fasten a 
basket to the bag and send up live animals. Finally Pilatrude 
Rozier volunteered to go up in it. On his first ascent the

The heated air used by the Montgolfiers was soon replaced by 
hydrogen, which is very much lighter than hot air and possesses

a greater lifting power. Since the early days of balloon construc- 
tion, much progress has been made, and now we have the huge, 
dirigible balloons. These can be steered, can carry tons of 
materials, and can remain in the air for many hours. 
While these successful experiments were being made with the 
balloon, man was still trying to develop a flying machine which 
was heavier than air and which could be driven at a high speed.
-P-A-G-E-522
    486 TRANSPORTATION 
Probably the first airplane which left the ground carrying a 
man was made by Ader, a Frenchman, in 1890. The balance 
of his machine was poor, however, and the machine was not 
practical. To be practical, 
an airplane must rise from 
the ground under its own 
power, fly through the air 
under perfect control, and 
return safely to the ground. 
The honor of inventing the 
first practical airplane goes 
to Orville andWilbur Wright, 
of Dayton, Ohio, who in 
1903 made many successful 
flights (Figure 485). The

securing traction. A force is used to drive the wheels and propel 
the vehicle forward. In order to do this there must be sufficient 
friction between the wheels and the ground to keep the wheels 
from slipping. In water transportation the problem of pro- 
pelling the boat forward is more complicated, since water does 
not present a solid surface like land. In addition to this is the 
problem of keeping afloat vessels constructed of iron and steel, 
since these materials are heavier than water. The problems in 
air transportation depend on whether a heavier-than-air or a

lighter-than-air ship is to be used. In balloons and dirigibles a 
lighter-than-air gas must be secured. In the airplane the 
resistance of the air must be utilized to enable the propeller to 
keep the plane up in the air and to steer it in its course. 
PROBLEM 1: WHAT ARE SOME IMPORTANT SCIENCE 
PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH LAND TRANSPORTATION? 
Power must be applied to the driving wheels. Transportation, 
to be effective, must be speedy. In utilizing the force of expand- 
ing steam, exploding gas, and electricity, many difficulties had 
to be overcome. You recall (see page 377) that the motion of 
the piston in the steam 
or gas engine is back- 
ward and forward or 
upward and downward. 
Such motion has to be 
changed to curvilinear 
motion; that is, the cir- 
cular movement of the 
wheel. This is accom- 
plished by the use of the 
eccentric in the steam 
engine (Figure 359) and Fig. 485. The Wrights’ First Airplane Flight

driving wheels. The 
method of doing this depends upon the kind of power used. 
In the steam engine the force of the expanding steam can be 
applied directly to the drive wheels. This is possible because the 
power of the engine does not depend upon the speed at which 
the engine is moving. As soon as the steam enters the cylinder, 
it develops its full power. This is not true in the case of the gas 
engine or electric motor. The greater the speed of the gas 
engine or electric motor, the greater is the power developed.     Keystone View Co.

Since it requires a much greater force to set an object in motion 
than it does to keep it moving, it is clear that the engine itself 
must be running at high speed before the car can be started. 
Of course it would be impossible to attach the engine to the 
driving wheels when it 
is going at a high speed 
and the wheels are not 
moving. For this rea- 
son automobiles are 
equipped with a clutch 
(Figure 373), which dis- 
connects the engine 
from the system of 
gears which transmit 
the power to the rear 
wheels. (See page 386.)

necessary in an electric

in the gasoline automobile.       Courtesy Portland Cement Association

Exercise 1. Why does a gas engine transmit more power to the 
drive wheels when it is running rapidly than when it is running slowly? 
Traction for the wheels is secured by friction. Another diffi- 
culty which is encountered in land transportation is that of 
securing traction. The surface over which the wheels run must 
be neither, too rough nor too smooth, in order to provide suffi- 
cient friction between the wheels and the surface upon which 
they turn, The early steam carriages failed largely because 
they could not secure proper traction on the roads. The 
development of railroads was delayed one hundred years because 
some mathematicians figured out that there would not be 
enough friction between iron wheels and iron rails to provide 
traction for a locomotive. 
Tf you have ever taken an automobile trip on muddy roads, 
you realize the need of good traction (Figure 486). The car

slips from one side of the road to the other, and much greater 
power must be used to attain the speed that could be secured 
on dry roads. Wrapping chains around the tires is simply a 
method of securing the foothold necessary to propel the car 
forward. Non-skid tires 
with their irregular 
outer surface are used 
for the same purpose.

Friction must bé reduced in the moving parts of a machine. 
You recall (see page 326) that the efficiency of a machine 
depends upon the amount of friction. Friction not only lowers 
the efficiency of a machine, but it causes the parts to wear out. 
For this reason automobiles are equipped with ball-bearings 
and with a lubricating system which covers movable parts 
with a film of oil and prevents the metal surfaces from coming 
into contact with each other. The gears (Figure 373) run in

   a bath of heavy oil, and the wheels, springs, axles, and steer- 
ing device are packed with hard grease. An abundant supply 
of oil is especially important in the engine, for without it the 
engine will become over-heated, causing the pistons to expand, 
the valves to warp, and the entire engine to be damaged. 
Shocks and jars must be eliminated. Comfort in riding is 
another important factor which must be considered in all forms 
of land transportation. Both the automobile and the train are 
equipped with springs which absorb the shock from irregulari-

      ties in the surface over which the wheels are run. This not only 
softens the shock to the rider, but at the same time reduces 
the wear on the car. Automobiles are equipped with air-filled 
tires. When the tire strikes a bump, the air in the tire takes up 
part of the shock. Balloon tires, which are much larger and 
which carry air at avery much lower pressure than ordinary 
tires, are proving satisfactory in further decreasing the wear 
and tear on the rider and the car. 
The surface offered to the resistance of the air must be as 
small as possible. Air offers so little resistance when one is 
walking that it is hard to realize that air resistance must be 
taken into consideration in designing locomotives and auto- 
mobiles. This is necessary, however, if high speed is desired, 
because if the speed is doubled, the resistance of the air becomes

WHY BOATS AND SHIPS FLOAT 491 
four times as great, and if it is tripled, the air resistance becomes 
nine times as great. For this reason we have the stream-line 
automobile and locomotive (Figure 488). When they are con- 
structed in this manner, the air which strikes them flows off 
at the sides. 
New methods of transportation will be developed. When one 
realizes that all of the important advances in transportation 
were made during the last one hundred years, it is easy to believe 
that the next century may unlock new forces which will be used 
to propel our vehicles, and new machines may be invented 
which will change methods of transportation as greatly as 
the inventions of the past century have done.

PROBLEM 2: WHY DO BOATS AND SHIPS FLOAT? 
Primitive man probably did not spend much time wondering 
why his boat floated; he was satisfied that it did. It is easy for 
you to see why wooden ships float, because you know that if 
you throw a piece of wood on the water it will not sink. It is 
perhaps not so easy to understand why boats made of iron, 
steel, or concrete, float, because these materials will sink when 
placed in water. If you roll a piece of tinfoil into a ball and place 
it in water, it will sink. If you then unroll the tinfoil and bend 
it up on the sides so as to make a little boat, it will float. If 
you can explain why it sinks when rolled into a ball and why it 
floats when smoothed out and made into a boat, you will be 
able to explain why iron and steel ships float. 
Materials weigh less in water than in air. Perhaps you 
have noticed that you can lift yourself with your hands very 
easily while in the water. You seem to weigh much less in 
the water than out of it. This will help you to understand 
how iron ships float. 
 
-P-A-G-E-528
  492 TRANSPORTATION 
Experiment 104: Do materials weigh less in water than in air? 
(a) Suspend a stone or piece of iron from a spring balance, and 
record the weight. 
(b) Lower the stone or piece of iron in a jar of water until it is 
completely covered, and again note the weight (Fig- 
ure 489). Does it weigh the same as it did in air? 
From your experiment you see that ma- 
terials weigh less in water than in the air. 
The water must overcome part of the force 
of gravity, because the amount of material 
is the same. This lifting force of water on 
a body placed in it is called buoyancy. 
Two forces act upon objects placed in 
water. When an object is placed on water, 
there are two forces acting upon it. There 
is the pull of gravity which tends to make it 
sink, and there is the lifting effect of the 
water which tends to make it float. If the 
pull of gravity is greater than the lifting effect 
of the water, the body sinks. If the upward 
force of the water is greater than the weight 
of the body in air, it then floats.

Experiment 105: Why does wood float?

meters, and weigh it in grams. Calculate the

ment 104. somewhat larger than the block of wood, and 
place the beaker in a pan. 
(c) Place the block of wood in the water (Figure 490). Observe 
that it sinks a little and pushes aside, or displaces, some of the water, 
which overflows into the pan. 
(d) Measure the number of cubic centimeters of water which were 
displaced. A cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram; so the 
weight of the water displaced will be the same number of grams as 
cubic centimeters. Compare the weight of the water displaced with 
 
-P-A-G-E-529
  
WHY BOATS AND SHIPS FLOAT 493 
that of the block of wood. (Keep in mind that a little of the water 
displaced sticks to the walls of the vessel.) 
Experiment 105 shows you two facts: (1) the wood sinks 
in the water until it displaces an amount of water equal to 
its own weight, which means that the buoyant force of the 
water is equal to the weight of the 
water displaced; (2) a cubic centi- 
meter of wood weighs less than a 
cubie centimeter of water. Since 
the wood does not weigh so much 
as an equal volume of water, it 
sinks only part way, until it dis- 
places its own weight. Part of the 
wood, therefore, remains above 
the surface of the water. 
If you repeat Experiment 105, using a piece of iron or a 
stone, you get somewhat different results. 
  Fig. 490. Apparatus for 
Experiment 105 
Experiment 106: Why do iron and stone sink when 
placed in water? 
Repeat the last experiment, using a piece of iron or stone. In 
this experiment you find that the weight of the water displaced is 
less than the weight of the iron or stone. Since the upward or buoy- 
ant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced, the iron or 
stone sinks, because the lifting force is not equal to the weight of the 
iron or stone. Floating objects always sink in water until they have 
displaced their own weight. Objects heavier than water always sink, 
because their weight is greater than the weight of water they can 
displace. 
Steel ships float because the average weight of each cubic 
centimeter or cubic foot of the ship is less than the weight of 
a cubic centimeter or cubic foot of water. This is true because 
there are great air spaces between the steel walls of the ship, 
and the ship is constructed so that it will displace a large 
amount of water.

Exercise 9. How can an engineer plan a boat so that before it is 
built he will be able to tell how far down in the water it will sink 
and how much of a load it will carry? 
PROBLEM 3: HOW ARE SHIPS PROPELLED AND STEERED? 
Sail boats use wind power to propel them. Boats propelled 
by wind are still used in many places, although the steamship, 
because of its greater speed and carry- 
ing power, is gradually displacing them 
for ocean travel. Skaters often use the 
force of the wind to blow them over the 
ice. Coming against the wind, they 
have to use their own energy, because 
they do not know how to make the wind 
drive them back against it. Sailors 
found long ago that they could not wait 
for the wind to blow in the direction 
they wished to go. They learned how 
to harness the wind and make it drive 
them where they willed. Sailing against

Poe rsidevob ene sa iad the sail is changed. Figure 491 shows a forward push is given 
to the boat. how the sails of a boat should be ar- 
ranged in order to sail into the wind. 
It is of course impossible to sail in exactly the same direction 
from which the wind blows. For example, if the wind were due 
north, and one wished to travel due north, it would be neces- 
sary to “tack,” that is, to sail northeast or northwest. By 
first sailing slightly northeast and then changing the sail so as 
to travel northwest, it is possible to maintain an average 
northerly direction.

PROPELLING AND STEERING SHIPS 495 
Steam boats are propelled by the paddle wheel and screw. 
Two methods of propelling steamships are in common use. The 
older method — is 
that of the large re- 
volving wheel fitted 
with broad blades 
or paddles. The 
wheels may be 
placed one on each 
side of the boat, or 
only one may be 
used at the stern 
(Figure 492). Since 
water has weight, it 
offers resistance to 
the passing of the 
blades through it. 
Therefore, as the Keystone View Co.

where a screw propeller will not work. 
wheel turns and the blades strike 
the water, the boat is pushed for- 
ward. The more modern propeller 
is shaped like the curved blades of 
an electric fan (Figures 493 and 
494). It revolves rapidly through 
the water, pushing the boat forward. 
Ships may be driven by one, 
two, or three screws. If the ship is 
driven by one screw, the shaft 
from the engine which drives the 
screw issues from a hole in the 
stern frame in front of the rudder. 
If two screws are used, one is 
placed on each side of the stern

frame. A three-screw ship has several advantages over a 
one-screw ship. In the first place, in case one screw is dis- 
abled, or if the engine which drives it breaks down, the ship 
can still be propelled by the other screws. It is also possible 
to drive the screws at different speeds, so that the ship can be 
steered without a rudder. This is of special value when the 
ship is being turned around. 
Exercise 10. State the advantages and disadvantages of the 
different methods of propelling ships.

The screw propeller and rudder are clearly visible at the stern of the

The compass is an aid to steering. When you travel on land, 
it is comparatively easy to find your way. Roads are laid out 
in more or less regular lines, and it is hardly necessary even 
to know the directions. On the ocean, travel is a different 
matter. When land is out of sight, the only natural direction- 
finders are the sun by day and the stars by night. Naviga- 
tors need to know, however, their exact position, so that they 
may be sure of traveling toward their destination in a reason-

     PROPELLING AND STEERING SHIPS 497 
ably direct route, and so that they may avoid shallow water 
and rocks. 
No one knows exactly when or where the compass (Figure 
495) originated, but history tells us that it was in use during 
the twelfth century. The compass dial, or card, was divided 
into thirty-two 
parts and perma- 
nently marked be- 
fore the close of the 
fourteenth century. 
The four cardinal 
points, north, east, 
south, and west 
were, of course, a 
part of man’s 
knowledge thou- 
sands of years ago.

tion. This end is 
called the north-seeking pole of the compass needle. Without 
doubt the ancients believed that the compass pointed to true 
north, but in most places on the earth’s surface it really points 
several degrees to the right or left of true north. Experiments 
also showed that as the compass was carried north or south 
on the surface of the earth, the needle tilted up or down. This 
led scientists to believe that the earth possesses magnetic poles. 
Sir James Ross in 1831 located the north magnetic pole of the 
earth. At that point the north-seeking end of the compass 
needle points straight down. This location was found to be 
about 1200 miles from the geographical north pole. Because     
  
-P-A-G-E-534

  of the difference in the position of the two poles, the compass 
needle will not point true north. Since 1831 maps have been 
constructed to show the difference between true north and the 
magnetic north (Figure 496). This difference is called the 
magnetic declination. 
Exercise 11. Locate 
your town or city

ticular time, and so 
other instruments have been invented to give this information. 
The ‘‘log’”’ records the rate of travel. Columbus had no idea 
of the distance he traveled, because he had no way of measuring 
it. The first device for measuring distance traveled appeared 
early in the seventeenth century. This instrument was 
called the log. It consisted of a stick of wood attached to a 
rope. On the rope were knots placed at regular intervals of 
about 50 feet. When navigators wished to find out how fast 
the ship was going, they threw the log overboard, and a sailor 
counted the number of knots which slipped through his hand in 
a given time, as measured by a half-minute sand glass. The 
number of knots which passed through the sailor’s hand in the 
half minute represented the number of nautical miles made an 
hour by the boat. The nautical mile is 1.14 times as long as the 
ordinary mile. The word knot is generally used by sailors to 
mean the nautical mile. The actual distance traveled a day   
      
  
-P-A-G-E-535
ee ee PROPELLING AND STEERING SHIPS 499 
can be determined by obtaining the average speed an hour and 
multiplying it by 24. The log used now consists of a steel 
torpedo-shaped rotator attached by a cable to a speedometer 
on the ship’s rail (Figure 497). The speed at which the rotator 
turns depends upon the 
speed of the ship. The 
small hand on the record- 
ing instrument indicates 
the rate of travel. The log, 
when used with the com- 
pass, furnishes a very rough 
estimate of the  ship’s 
position, but this method is 
always checked by means of 
other instruments.

latitude fixes the distance north or south of the equator, and 
the longitude fixes the distance east or west of the prime 
meridian at Greenwich. (See page 30.) This distance is 
measured in terms of degrees (°), minutes (’), and seconds 
(”).. By means of a map the navigator may easily deter- 
mine the latitude and longitude of different places. In the 
same manner the master of the ship, having once determined 
his latitude and longitude, can, by means of the map, locate 
his exact position.
-P-A-G-E-536
  500 TRANSPORTATION 
Longitude is determined by means of a chronometer and a 
sextant. The chronometer is simply a very accurate clock. 
Usually ships carry two chronometers; one is set according to 
Greenwich time (see page 31), and the other shows ship time, 
that is, actual time of day on board the ship. The sextant is 
an instrument used to measure the angle of the sun or some 
other heavenly body with the horizon line (Figure 498). Just

before noon, according to ship time, one of the ship’s officers 
begins his observation of the sun. The handle for the righ 
hand is held in a vertical position, and the horizon line is 
sighted through the telescope. Then the movable arm is adjusted 
until the light from the sun is reflected by the upper mirror to 
the horizon of the horizon mirror. When the sun has reache: 
its highest point, it will be exactly 12 noon. Comparison is 
then made between ship time and Greenwich time. Suppose 
that Greenwich time is 11 a. M. and the ship time is 12 noon. 
The difference in time is one hour. This means that the ship is 
at 15° East longitude. (See page 31.) 
The latitude is determined by means of the sextant. You 
know that on September 23rd and March 21st the sun is 
directly over the equator at noon. (See page 27.) It therefore 
makes an angle of 90° with the horizontal (Figure 499A). If        
-P-A-G-E-537
  
PROPELLING AND STEERING SHIPS 501 
one were located at the north pole on these days, the sun’s 
rays would be horizontal; that is,.one would see the sun by 
sighting directly along the horizon. If one were half way 
between the equator and the North Pole, that is, 45° latitude, 
the angle of the sun’s rays would make an angle of 45° with 
the horizontal 
(Figure 499B). Line Horizontal to Earth's Surface at North Pole North Pole    Therefore on these Equator

Since, however, 
the sun is not always directly over the equator, it is necessary 
to correct the angle according to the time of year. Navigators 
carry charts which give the correction for each day of the year. 
In determining the latitude, therefore, the angle of the sun 
with the horizon at 12 noon is determined with the sextant. 
This is the angle between the vertical arm and the movable 
arm when the sextant is correctly sighted at noon. This angle 
is then corrected according to the time of year. When the 
corrected angle is obtained, it is only necessary to look in the 
tables to find the correct latitude. 
At night, when the sun is not visible, the navigator obtains 
his position from the stars. The invention of radio and the 
radio compass has made it possible for the ship captain to work 
out his position by radio or to obtain it from radio stations. Line Horizontal to Earth's Surtace at 45°N.Lat.

PROBLEM 4: HOW DO BALLOONS AND DIRIGIBLES 
FLOAT IN THE AIR? 
The balloon is a great gas bag. The bag of the modern 
balloon is made of varnished silk or cotton treated with a rubber 
solution. The varnish and the rubber prevent the gas from 
leaking through the walls. On the 
outside of the bag is a strong net 
to which the basket is fastened 
(Figure 500). The basket is usu- 
ally made of bamboo or woven 
willow materials, which are very 
strong and light. In the side of 
the balloon near the top is the rip- 
ping panel. This consists of a light 
fabric sewed between two of the 
panels. When the ripping-panel 
cord is jerked, the fabric is torn 
open, and the gas escapes. This 
enables the aeronaut to make a 
quick descent. There is also a valve 
Fig. 500. Parts of a Balloon jn the neck of the balloon, which is 
Balloons cannot be steered opened automatically and prevents and are therefore at the mercy a : i the. wind the balloon from bursting if the 
pressure inside becomes too great. 
Balloons are filled with a lighter-than-air gas. To send a 
balloon up it is necessary to fill it with a gas which weighs 
much less than air. Hot air, coal gas, hydrogen, and helium 
have all been used for this purpose, because they are all lighter 
than air.   
  Experiment 107: How are balloons inflated? 
(a) Make some soapy water by dissolving soap in warm wate: 
and adding a little glycerine. Attach a soap-bubble pipe to the gas 
jet by a rubber tube. Dip the bowl of the pipe in the soapy water, 
mouth downwards, and turn the gas on slowly. When the soap
-P-A-G-E-539
         BALLOONS AND DIRIGIBLES 503 
bubble gets to be about four inches in diameter, shake it off. What 
does the bubble do? 
(b) A rubber balloon may also be filled with hydrogen. Generate 
a gallon bottle of hydrogen. To do this, place about 10 grams of 
zine in the bottle and add 20 cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid. 
Place the stopper in the bottle, as shown in Figure 501, but do not 
connect the rubber tube 
with the faucet. After a 
few minutes connect the 
tube which goes to the bot- 
tom of the bottle to the 
faucet, and connect the 
other tube to the balloon. 
When the faucet is opened, 
the water will force the gas 
out of the bottle into the 
balloon. As soon as the 
balloon is completely in- 
flated, pinch the end of it so 
that the gas cannot escape, 
and tie it securely. Take Fig. 501. Filling a Toy Balloon it out doors, release it, and with Hydrogen 
see how high it goes.         
     Faucet 
   
  One thousand cubic feet of air at a pressure of thirty inches 
of mercury and a temperature of 60°F. weigh about 75 pounds. 
One thousand cubic feet of coal gas at the same temperature 
and pressure weigh but 373 pounds. The same volume of 
hydrogen weighs but 5 pounds. The lifting force of the gas in 
the balloon is the difference between the weight of air and the 
weight of the same volume of gas. For example, the lifting power 
of hydrogen is 70 pounds per thousand cubic feet. Why? What 
is the lifting power of 1,000 cubic feet of coal gas? To eal- 
culate how heavy a load a balloon can lift, you must know 
four things: the weight of the balloon, its volume, the weight 
of the air it displaces, and the weight of the gas used to 
inflate it. Suppose you wish to find the lifting power of a 
balloon inflated with coal gas, the volume of which is 100,000

Ballooning requires great skill. Let us now see what the 
balloonist does when he goes on a trip. First he must inflate 
the bag. For this purpose he may have the bag suspended in 
the air, or it may be lying on the ground with the neck under- 
neath. If he uses hydrogen, it is only necessary to let the gas 
escape from big steel cylinders which contain the hydrogen 
under great pressure. As the gas rushes in, the bag grows 
larger and larger. At first the balloon displaces but little air, 
but as it swells it displaces more air. As a rule the bag is not 
fully inflated, because as it rises, the air pressure gets less, 
and the gas in the balloon expands. When the weight of the 
air displaced is greater than the weight of the balloon, the bag 
begins to tug at its moorings, and when released shoots up 
into the air. 
As it ascends, the gas inside the balloon expands, because the 
air pressure outside grows less. The automatic valve in the neck 
of the balloon opens when the pressure inside gets too great, 
and part of the gas escapes. The balloon continues to rise 
until it reaches a level where the air displaced equals the weight 
of the balloon. If the pilot wishes to go higher, he can throw 
out ballast. This usually consists of bags of sand. Relieved of 
this weight, the balloon will rise. If the pilot wishes to float 
at a lower level, he can open the valve and allow part of the 
gas to escape. Since the volume of the balloon becomes 
smaller, the balloon must sink to a lower level where the 
air is heavier.
-P-A-G-E-541
  BALLOONS AND DIRIGIBLES 505 
All of this time the balloonist is at the mercy of the wind. 
He does not feel the slightest air movement, because his balloon 
is floating along at the same rate of speed as the wind. If he 
gets out of sight of land, he has no means of telling how fast 
he is going or in what direc- 
tion. As the balloon travels, it 
generally revolves slowly. Of 
course the basket turns with it, 
so that even the compass will 
not tell the pilot his direction. 
If it were not for the leakage of 
gas, a balloon could remain in 
the air indefinitely. But because 
of this leakage it must finally 
come down. When it nears the 
ground, the trail rope is of great 
assistance in making a good 
landing. The trail rope is a 
heavy cable, and when the 
balloon comes so low that the 
rope touches the ground, the 
balloon‘is relieved of part'of its Saaa...27- epatone View Go.

the speed of the balloon. 
One sometimes sees a balloonist jump from the balloon and 
descend in a parachute. The parachute is a large umbrella-like 
structure (Figure 502) which is opened by the air as the 
balloonist falls. The resistance of the air buoys it up, and thus 
causes a gentle descent. Just before the pilot jumps, he pulls 
the ripping panel, and if the balloon is filled with coal or wood 
gas, you can see the huge clouds of black smoke pouring out. 
A dirigible or airship is more complicated than an ordinary 
balloon. The dirigible balloon or airship must be long and

jointed, with a stream line, so that it may be driven into the 
wind (Figure 503). The bag must also be rigidly constructed,

Pacific and Atlantic Photos 
Fig. 503. Dirigible Airships 
The Los Angeles is 656 feet long and holds 2,500,000 cubic feet of helium 
gas. At the time this picture was made, the other dirigibles were in the 
process of construction. The length of the G-Z-1 type is 900 feet.   
or nearly so. In one type of airship the bag is attached on the 
outside of a framework of aluminum which makes the bag rigid. 
Another type contains air bags, which, as the gas escapes, may 
be pumped full of air. The dirigible is propelled by gasoline 
engines which drive propellers, and is steered by a huge rudder 
at its rear. The first airship crossed the Atlantic in July, 1919. 
This ship was six hundred and forty feet long and had five 
engines, which altogether developed one thousand horse power. 
The Los Angeles, one of the later dirigibles, is 656 feet long and 
will carry more than forty tons of useful load. It has a cruising 
radius of about five thousand miles. The Shenandoah, built in 
America, has an effective lift of thirty tons and a cruising 
radius of four thousand miles.

   Helium gas is best for balloons and dirigibles. The chief 
danger of dirigibles and balloons is that of fire. Until a recent 
date the bags were always inflated with inflammable materials. 
In the search for a gas which was lighter than air and which 
would not burn, it was found that 
helium gas, which has a lifting power : 
92 per cent as great as hydrogen, iar, 
could be used. This gas, however, 
was too expensive to obtain until in 
1919, when a process was perfected 
in our country for securing it from 
natural gas. It is probable that with 
the wider possibilities which this gas 
presents, flying with dirigibles will Feats

    PROBLEM 5: HOW DO AIRPLANES MOVE THROUGH THE AIR? 
   
        
                            
       The airplane resembles the kite and the bird. Perhaps the 
simplest way to understand how an airplane flies is to see first 
what keeps a kite in the air. Figure 504 shows the forces which 
act upon a kite in the air. The wind strikes the under surface 
of the kite at an angle and produces two effects. One effect is to 
drive the kite upwards, and the other effect is to push it hori- 
zontally. The string keeps the surface of the kite facing the 
wind at the same angle. If the string were released, the kite 
would immediately come to the ground, because the force of 
the wind would straighten the kite out horizontally and there 
would be no upward push. Acting against the pull of gravity 
which tends to pull the kite down, is the upward force of the 
wind. The stronger the wind the greater this upward force
-P-A-G-E-544
     
  508 TRANSPORTATION 
will be, and the higher the kite will go. When you run very 
rapidly against the wind, the kite keeps mounting in the air, 
because you are increasing the force of the wind against its 
surface. If you stop running, the kite will not go higher unless 
there is a very strong wind. If that part of the force of the wind 
which produces the upward lift becomes less than the force of 
gravity, the kite will fall to the ground.

Fig. 505. A Modern Type of Airplane 
In this plane Charles A. Lindbergh made the first non-stop flight from 
New York to Paris. He left New York on May 20, 1927, and covered the 
distance of 3,610 miles in 33 hr. and 29 min. This plane has a wing spread 
of 46 ft. and a body length of 28 ft. The body is of metal and the wings 
of wood. The motor has nine cylinders and develops 200 horse-power. 
The airplane has been closely modeled after the bird (Figures 
505 and 506). The weight of its body is centered near the front, 
which counterbalances any tendency to whirl over backwards. 
Its wings are arched, with concave side downward, and are 
thicker in the front than in the back. The body tapers toward 
the ends. This cuts down the air resistance exactly as the 
body and head of a bird do. Its tail balances the effect of the 
wind on the planes so as to keep an even keel, and furnishes 
the means of steering.    
  
-P-A-G-E-545
  AIRPLANES 509 
The propeller blades bore through the air like a screw. Air- 
planes are always driven with powerful engines, because to 
remain in the air it is necessary to keep a speed of sixty miles 
an hour ormore. The engine is cranked by turning the propeller,

just as an automobile is started with a crank. The propeller 
cuts through the air at the rate of fifteen hundred or more 
revolutions a minute. Its action is like that of a screw. If 
you start a screw into a block of wood and turn it with a screw 
driver, its curved edges will cut through the wood, pulling the

screw deeper and deeper into the wood. The blades of the 
propeller are curved in somewhat the same manner, and as they 
revolve they cut deeper and deeper into the air, pulling the 
| airplane with them. Of course the air 
Elevator is not solid like wood and does not 
offer as much resistance. Its resistance 
is enough, however, so that the pro- 
peller works its way through it with 
every revolution. When the propeller 
is placed in front, it is called a tractor, 
and when placed behind, a pusher. 
When an airplane is flying through 
the air at a hundred miles an hour, 
the force of the wind against it is the

body of the plane tapers toward both 
the front and rear, so that wind resistance on the body 
is greatly reduced. Furthermore, the wings, or planes, are 
not set at such an angle that they will get the full force of the 
wind. In fact, they are almost parallel with the plane. All 
these factors make it possible for the plane to exist in the face 
of the terrific wind resistance which it encounters when mov- 
ing at such high speed. 
The elevator governs the upward and downward course of 
the airplane. The front planes themselves are not placed at a 
great enough angle for the machine to “take off” when it is on 
the ground. When the aviator wishes to ascend, the engine is 
started, and the propeller drives the machine along the ground. 
When the pilot is sure that the plane has gained sufficient speed, 
he pulls the proper lever, which lowers the elevator. The    
-P-A-G-E-547
AIRPLANES 511 
elevator is a small, movable plane or rudder located on the tail. 
When it is lowered (Figure 507), the pressure of the wind pushes 
the tail of the plane off the ground. If the elevator is now raised, 
the pressure of the wind pushes the tail down and the head up 
(Figure 508). This allows the wind 
to strike the underside of the 
planes. The force of the wind lifts 
the airplane as it does the kite. 
In descending, the elevator is low- 
ered and the wind pressure lifts 
the tail and lowers the front planes, 
thus decreasing the angle at which 
the wind strikes the front planes.

rudders. These offer resistance to 
the air current, just as the elevators do. By moving them to 
the right or left, the pilot can change the direction of the | 
  plane. 
Exercise 16. Outline the things an aviator must do to “take off,” 
ascend to an altitude of 1000 feet, fly at this level for a mile, and then 
return to his starting place.

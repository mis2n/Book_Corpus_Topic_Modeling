PREFACE 
“Typ CLASSICAL PsycHoLocists” is a companion volume 
in the field of psychology to the author’s “The Classical Moral- 
ists” in the sphere of ethics, and also to his “ Modern Classical 
Philosophers” in the domain of philosophy. Its aim is to pre- 
sent in a series of selections some of the most essential features 
of the psychological doctrines which have appeared from Anax- 
agoras to Wundt. The book is thus virtually a history of psy- 
chology, not derived from an ordinary description of systems, 
but based upon extracts from original sources and upon trans- 
lations of the authors themselves. Such a work, it is hoped, may 
prove adapted for colleges and universities as a text-book of 
reading accompanying courses of lectures in general psychology, 
and may become a necessary requirement of study made of all 
students before entering upon the study of the special divisions 
of existing psychology. The general reader, moreover, will find 
it an interesting volume of original material of the great 
psychologists from the earliest to the most recent times. 
From Aristotle’s “De Anima” there is reproduced at the 
outset the first extant history of psychological theories. With 
the name of Anaxagoras, who emphasizes the Nous as present 
in all things, but with insight as to its different forms in mind 
and matter, it was thought the work might fittingly begin. Em- 
pedocles is mentioned, who maintains that like is known by 
like, and that perception is due to elements in us coming in 
contact with similar elements outside. Democritus is also in- 
cluded, who believes the soul to consist of atoms, the peculiar 
fineness, smoothness, and mobility of which cause perception 
and thought. The second selection is taken from the Theaetetus 
of Plato, which Professor Jowett describes as the oldest work 
in psychology that has come down to us, and which here con- 
tains the contending Sophistic and Socratic views on the nature 
[3033 
aia    
-P-A-G-E-6
  vi PREFACE 
of perception. In it Protagoras affirms that the individual man 
is the measure of all things, whereas Socrates seeks to conduct 
Theaetetus by means of the dialogue to the acceptance of a 
universally valid knowledge. Although Plato’s psychological 
views are scattered through various dialogues, the Republic 
best contains his treatment of the fundamental problem of the 
relation of soul and body. There is consequently printed from 
it, his presentation of the three faculties of the soul, of the 
correlation of the faculties, and of the soul’s immortality. In 
Aristotle we have the greatest psychologist of the ancient 
world, and the one who first treated psychology as a separate 
science. To the introductory account of earlier theories by him, 
with which this work began, is here added a description from 
the ‘‘ De Anima” of his own doctrines. His conceptions of the 
essence of the soul, and its relation to the body as form to mat- 
ter, of the various activities of the five senses and the common 
sense, and of the functions of sensation, imagination, and 
thought, are given in full, as their importance demands. From 
Diogenes Laertius’ “ Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philoso- 
phers” is drawn the psychology of the Stoics, in which the ani- 
mating principle of the soul is described as a warm breath 
within us, with a resultant trichotomy of body, soul and 
spirit. From Diogenes Laertius is likewise taken the Epicurean 
psychology, in which the soul is conceived to be a bodily sub- 
stance composed of exceedingly fine atoms, which are allied in 
nature to air and fire, and are diffused throughout the whole 
body. Lucretius in the didactic poem on “The Nature of 
Things,” whereby Hellenistic thought was transferred to Rome, 
follows next with a description, like that of Epicurus, of sen- 
sation as everywhere occurring in the body; but he regards the 
mind as the directing principle “holding the fastnesses of life.” 
From the ‘‘Enneades” of Plotinus, who was the most eminent 
of the Neoplatonists, is reproduced the theory of emanation, in 
which the soul is deemed the image and product of the Nous, 
just as the Nous is of the One. 
In the medizval period, Tertullian, one of the greatest of the 
early Christian fathers, sets forth in the extracts presented from
-P-A-G-E-7

PREFACE vii 
his “Treatise on the Soul,”’ the corporeal nature of the soul, its 
simplicity, its source in the breath of God, its rationality, and 
its immortality. Gregory of Nyssa, who wrote in the latter part 
of the fourth century, here argues in the “ Endowment of Man,” 
that the intellect pervades all parts of the body aliké; but has 
in itself a divine beauty, since it is created in the image of 
the most beautiful. Augustine, in whom the Patristic period 
reached its culmination, emphasizes in his work “On the 
Trinity,” self-consciousness as the distinguishing characteristic 
of the mind arising from its immateriality, and regards memory, 
understanding, and particularly will, as its most important fac- 
ulties. Thomas Aquinas, who represents scholasticism in its 
full development, returns in the “Summa Theologica” to the 
Aristotelian doctrine of the rational soul as the essential form 
| of the body, and contends as against Augustine for the superi- 
ority of reason to will. 
The modern period is introduced with chapters from Thomas 
Hobbes’ “Human Nature,” in which the founder of empirical 
psychology reduces all mental processes to motions. An ample 
presentation is given of Descartes’ “The Passions of the Soul,” ‘ 
of which Professor David Irons says that “it would be difficult 
indeed to find any treatment of the emotions much superior to it 
in originality, thoroughness, and suggestiveness.”” Spinoza, who 
* teaches in “‘ The Ethics” that the soul and body are not two 
distinct substances, but that thought and extension are two of 
the many attributes of the one real being, seeks to prove by | 
the mathematical method in the part reproduced, that the 3 
order and connection of ideas are identical with the order and 
connection of things. From Leibnitz’ “Philosophical Works” 
selections have been made in which he presents his theory of 
monads, and likewise illustrates the interaction of soul and 
body after the manner of two clocks so constructed as to run 
in perfect harmony. Christian Wolff, whose name is chiefly 
associated with the faculty psychology, designates in those 
sections of the “ Rational Psychology” here chosen, the vis 
repraesentiva as the fundamental force and sufficient ground 
for everything that takes place in the soul.

viii PREFACE 
English empirical psychology is next traced through Locke, 
Berkeley, and Hume. From Locke’s “Essay on the Human 
Understanding” there is given, as Locke believes,‘‘the true 
history of the beginning of human knowledge,” wherein all our 
ideas are derived from sensation and reflection. Berkeley’s 
“Essay towards a new Theory of Vision” is reproduced with 
desirable fullness, as it contains his noted research into the differ- 
ence between the ideas of sight and touch, wherein he draws ~ 
the striking inference that the visible world is a visible lan- 
guage, which we learn to translate into the tactual experience 
that the visible phenomena naturally signify. Hume in the 
chapters from the “Treatise of Human Nature” would resolve 
all perceptions of the human mind into “impressions” and 
| “ideas,” differing only in force and liveliness, and also would 
derive our conception of necessary connection solely from the 
experience of the constant association of certain objects. 
Hartley was the chief precursor of English associational psy- 
chology, although preceded as he confesses by the modest Gay, 
and from the “ Observations on Man” are reprinted his two 
principal doctrines of vibrations, and of association. 
Charles Bonnet, the Swiss, and an early founder of physiolo- 
gical psychology, in the “Analytical Essay upon the Faculties 
of the Soul” of which his own “Abstract” has been in part 
translated, lays stress throughout on the dependence of psychical 
phenomena upon physical conditions, and considers the divers- 
ity of mental perceptions as really due to the different struc- 
tures of the various sensory fibres. The French psychologist 
Condillac, in the chapters from the ‘‘ Treatise of Sensations,” . 
views all psychical functions as transformations of sensations, 
and graphically illustrates his theory by the endowment of a 
marble statue with the different senses of man in succession. 
From Reid, founder of the Scotch School of common sense, 
those portions of the “Essays on the Intellectual Powers of 
Man” are given in which he analyzes the fundamental acts of 
sensation and perception, contending that the former is confined 
to the soul, but that the latter implies a belief in the existence of 
an external world. Brown’s eloquent ‘‘Lectures on the Philo-
-P-A-G-E-9
  PREFACE ix 
sophy of the Human Mind,” published after his death, contains 
a most subtle and brilliant analysis of muscular sensations, 
the inclusion of which, it is believed, must add substantial 
value to the pages of this work. 
With Herbart’s “ Textbook of Psychology” begins scientific 
psychological research, in which from the intensive relations of 
ideas and the laws of their change it is sought to derive the pos- 
sibility and necessity of applying mathematics to psychology. 
In Beneke’s “ Textbook of Psychology as Natural Science” a 
profound German psychologist seeks to reduce all psychical 
phenomena to four “fundamental processes.” Drobisch, who 
may be regarded as one of the distinguished representatives of 
mathematical psychology, presents in his “‘ Empirical Psychol- 
ogy,” the dynamics of ideas as the fundamental principle of ex- 
planation of psychical phenomena. Maine de Biran, whom 
Cousin thought the first metaphysician of the nineteenth cent- 
ury, has written some most instructive chapters in his ““ Essay 
upon the Foundations of Psychology,’ wherein he treats of 
voluntary effort as the primordial fact of our psychical life, 
analyzing it into the two distinct but inseparable elements of 
will and resistance of our own body, from which he derives the 
beginning of personality. 
The revival of English associational psychology is to be 
found in the chapters taken from James Mill’s “Analysis of the 
Phenomena of the Human Mind”; but its fullest fruition ap- 
pears in the laws of association reproduced at considerable 
length from Bain’s “ The Senses and the Intellect.” The cardi- 
nal feature of Spencer’s “‘ Principles of Psychology” is here pre- 
sented in the evolution of mind “ from an indefinite incoherent 
homogeneity to a definite coherent heterogeneity.” The selec- 
tion from Johannes Mueller’s “Elements of Physiology” will 
render more accessible his very important account of the gen- 
eral laws of sensation. A fitting place is naturally given also to 
Lotze’s theory of “local signs” as embodied in his “ Outlines of 
Psychology.” 
In more recent psychology, translations from Weber’s “ The 
Sense of Touch and the Common Feeling” of his well known
-P-A-G-E-10
  : PREFACE 
Law, and from Fechner’s “Elements of Psychophysics” of his 
“Measurement of Sensation,” are indispensable contributions in 
thedomainof psychophysics, being the experiments of the former, 
well described by Professor E. B. Titchener, as “the founda- 
tion stone of experimental psychology,” and the interpretation 
of the latter as the erection in large measure of “a whole build- 
ing.” The Young-Helmholtz theory of color vision has been 
translated from Helmholtz’s “ Manual of Physiological Optics,” 
which is regarded as the most important work that has yet ap- 
peared on the physiology and physics of vision. “‘ The Funda- 
mental Principles of a Theory of Light Sensation” by Hering 
will serve also to supplement those of Helmholtz, as a necessary 
foundation for the study of the more recent valuable contribu- 
tions which have been made to this subject. From Mach’s 
“Analysis of Sensations” is reproduced his theory of space per- 
ception, preceded by an account of the self intuition of the ego, 
which “every student of psychology should know.” Stumpf’s 
“Tone Psychology” contains a theory of tonal fusion, written 
by a recognised authority in this domain. The remarkable 
chapter of William James entitled “The Stream of Conscious- 
ness” is taken from his introductory “‘ Psychology.” Then fol- 
lows the James-Lange theory of emotions, in which a novel doc- 
trine is set forth by both writers with unusual brilliancy of 
style. Most characteristic and authoritative chapters from 
Wundt’s “Principles of Physiological Psychology” on the 
problem of physiological psychology, and from his “ Outlines of 
Psychology’ on volition and apperception, conclude the work. 
The outline of the selections in the preceding paragraphs 
traces the attempt, here made for the first time, to present his- 
torically in a single volume original texts containing funda- 
mental theories of the classical psychologists, alike in ancient, 
mediaeval, and modern times. The study of psychology as pur- 
sued to-day in several important divisions might suggest the 
desirability of a work of recent material from these various do- 
mains. An historical volume of the character of this book was, 
however, deemed not only more in harmony with the other works 
of the author’s series, but also as much more necessary for the
-P-A-G-E-11

use of students before entering upon investigations in special 
fields. Whilst a chronological order has been followed in gen- 
eral, slight variations have made it possible to group psycho- 
logists somewhat according to their schools, and the emphasis, 
moreover, in the most recent period, has been placed on the 
selection of those important laws and theories which have al- 
ready taken on a classical importance. The selections have 
been given with sufficient fullness, it is hoped, always to repro- 
duce the author and subject in an intelligible and connected 
way. Authorities will differ concerning the choice of authors 
and subjects. In this matter important advice has been re- 
ceived from the psychologists alike of Harvard University and 
also of other large American Universities. Although such valu- 
able opinion always has been carefully considered, the responsi- 
bility for the final decision naturally rests upon the editor. 
Thirteen authors appear in this work in selections trans- 
lated for the first time into English. To my colleague Pro- 
fessor Edward Kennard Rand, of the classical department of 
Harvard University, I am indebted for the translation from the 
Latin of “The essence and nature of the soul” contained in 
Christian Wolff’s “ Rational Psychology”; and to Dr. Herbert 
Sidney Langfeld of the Harvard Psychological Department for 
the translation from the German of ‘“‘ The measurement of sen- 
sation” in Gustav Fechner’s “Elements of Psychophysics.” 
The translations from the Greek of Gregory of Nyssa, from the 
Latin of Thomas Aquinas, from the French of Charles Bonnet 
and Maine de Biran, and from the German of Friedrich Ed- 
uard Beneke, Moritz Wilhelm Drobisch, Ernst Heinrich 
Weber, Heinrich von Helmholtz, Ewald Hering, Carl Stumpf, 
and Carl Lange in the text of H. Kurella, have been made 
by the author of this work. In French Professor Irving Babbitt 
and Dr. C.J. Ducasse, and in German Prof. W. G. Howard and 
Dr. J. Loewenberg of Harvard have made valuable suggestions. 
My thanks for permission to reprint selections of various psy- 
chologists are also due to the publishers and translators whose 
names will be found at the beginning of the respective chapters 
accompanying the titles of the works thus utilized. The book

will best attain its desired aims if its representative selections 
shall serve to inspire the perusal of the complete works of the 
classical psychologists, and if it shall aid in any measure to 
maintain the importance and prestige of classical psychology.

CHAPTER I—INTRODUCTION OF ARISTOTLE 
CoeniTIon is in oureyes a thing of beauty and worth, and this 
is true of one cognition more than another, either because it is 
exact or because it relates to more important and remarkable 
objects. On both these grounds we may with good reason claim 
a high place for the enquiry concerning the soul. It would seem, 
too, that an acquaintance with the subject contributes greatly 
to the whole domain of truth and, more particularly, to the 
study of nature, the soul being virtually the principle of all 
animal life. Our aim is to discover and ascertain the nature and 
essence of soul and, in the next place, all the accidents belonging 
to it; of which some are thought to be attributes peculiar to the 
soul itself, while others, it is held, belong to the animal also, but 
owe their existence to the soul. But everywhere and in every 
way it is extremely difficult to arrive at any trustworthy con-

  2) INTRODUCTION 
clusion on the subject. It is the same here as in many other 
enquiries. What we have to investigate is the essential nature 
of things and the What. It might therefore be thought that 
there is a single procedure applicable to all the objects whose 
essential nature we wish to discover, as demonstration is appli- 
cable to the properties which goalong with them: in that case 
we should have to enquire what this procedure is. If, however, 
there is no single procedure common to all sciences for defining 
the What, our task becomes still more difficult, as it will then 
be necessary to settle in each particular case the method to be 
pursued. Further, even if it be evident that it consists in de- 
monstration of some sort or division or some other procedure, 
there is still room for much perplexity and error, when we ask 
from what premisses our enquiry should start, for there are dif- 
ferent premisses for different sciences; for the science of num- 
bers, for example, and plane geometry. 
The first thing necessary is no doubt to determine under 
which of the summa genera soul comes and what it is; I mean, 
whether it is a particular thing, i.e. substance, or is quality or 
is quantity, or falls under any other of the categories already 
determined. We must further ask whether it is amongst things 
potentially existent or is rather a sort of actuality, the distinc- 
tion being all-important. Again, we must consider whether it 
is divisible or indivisible; whether, again, all and every soul is 
homogeneous or not; and, if not, whether the difference be- 
tween the various souls is a difference of species or a difference 
of genus: for at present discussions and investigations about 
soul would appear to be restricted to the human soul. We must 
take care not to overlook the question whether there is a single 
definition of soul answering to a single definition of animal; or 
whether there is a different definition foreach separate soul, as 
for horse and dog, man and god: animal, as the universal, being 
regarded either as non-existent or, if existent, as logically pos- 
terior. This is a question which might equally be raised in re- 
gard to any other common predicate. Further, on the assump- 
tion that there are not several souls, but merely several different 
parts in the same soul, it is a question whether we should begin
-P-A-G-E-25
  ARISTOTLE’S DE ANIMA 3 
by investigating soul as a whole or its several parts. And here 
again it is difficult to determine which of these parts are really 
distinct from one another and whether the several parts, or 
their functions, should be investigated first. Thus, e.g., should 
the process of thinking come first or the mind that thinks, the 
process of sensation or the sensitive faculty? And so everywhere 
else. But, if the functions should come first, again will arise the 
question whether we should first investigate the correlative 
objects. Shall we take, e.g., the sensible object before the fac- 
ulty of sense and the intelligible object before the intellect? 
It would seem that not only is the knowledge of a thing’s 
essential nature useful for discovering the causes of its attri- 
butes, as, e.g.,in mathematics the knowledge of what ismeant 
by the terms straight or curved, line or surface, aids us in dis- 
covering to how many right angles the angles of a triangle are 
equal: but also, conversely, a knowledge of the attributes is a 
considerable aid to the knowledge of what a thing is. For when 
we are able to give an account of all, or at any rate most, of the 
attributes as they are presented to us, then we shall be in a posi- 
tion to define most exactly the essential nature of the thing. 
In fact, the starting point of every demonstration is a defini- 
tion of what something is. Hence the definitions which lead 
to no information about attributes and do not facilitate even 
conjecture respecting them have clearly been framed for dia- 
lectic and are void of content, one and all. 
A further difficulty arises as to whether all attributes of the 
soul are also shared by that which contains the soul or whether 
any of them are peculiar to the soul itself: a question which it is 
indispensable, and yet by no means easy, to decide. It would 
appear that in most cases soul neither acts nor is acted upon 
apart from the body: as, e.g., in anger, confidence, desire and 
sensation in general. Thought, if anything, would seem to be 
peculiar to the soul. Yet, if thought is a sort of imagination, or 
not independent of imagination, it will follow that even thought 
cannot be independent of the body. If, then, there be any of 
the functions or affections of the soul peculiar to it, it will be 
possible for the soul to be separated from the body: if, on the
-P-A-G-E-26
  4 INTRODUCTION 
other hand, there is nothing of the sort peculiar to it, the soul 
will not be capable of separate existence. As with the straight 
line, so with it. The line, gud straight, has many properties; for 
instance, it touches the brazen sphere at a point; but it by no 
means follows that it will so touch it if separated. In fact it is 
inseparable, since it is always conjoined with body of some sort. 
So, too, the attributes of the soul appear to be all conjoined with 
body: such attributes, viz., as anger, mildness, fear, pity, cour- 
age; also joy, love and hate; all of which are attended by some 
particular affection of the body. This indeed is shown by the 
fact that sometimes violent and palpable incentives occur with- 
out producing in us exasperation or fear, while at other times 
we are moved by slight and scarcely perceptible causes, when 
the blood is up and the bodily condition that of anger. Still 
more is this evident from the fact that sometimes even without 
the occurrence of anything terrible men exhibit all the symp- 
toms of terror. If this be so, the attributes are evidently forms 
or notions realised in matter. Hence they must be defined ac- 
cordingly: anger, for instance, as a certain movement in a body 
of a given kind, or some part or faculty of it, produced by such 
and such a cause and for such and such an end. These facts at 
once bring the investigation of soul, whether in its entirety or 
in the particular aspect described, within the province of the 
natural philosopher. But every such attribute would be differ- 
ently defined by the physicist and the dialectician or philoso- 
pher. Anger, for instance, would be defined by the dialectician 
as desire for retaliation or the like, by the physicist as a ferment 
of the blood or heat which is about the heart: the one of them 
gives the matter, the other the form or notion. For the notion 
is the form of the thing, but this notion, if it is to be, must be 
realised in matter of a particular kind; just as in the case of.a 
house. The notion or definition of a house would be as follows: 
a shelter to protect us from harm by wind or rain or scorching 
heat; while another will describe it as stones, bricks and tim- 
ber; and again another as the form realised in these materials 
and subserving given ends. Which then of these is the true phy- 
sicist? Is it he who confines himself to the matter, while ignor-
-P-A-G-E-27
ARISTOTLE’S DE ANIMA 5 
ing the form? Or he who treats of the form exclusively? I an- 
swer, it is rather he who in his definition takes account of both. 
What then of each of the other two? Or shall we rather say 
that there is no one who deals with properties which are not 
separable nor yet treated as separable, but the physicist deals 
with all the active properties or passive affections belonging to 
body of a given sort and the corresponding matter? All attri- 
butes not regarded as so belonging he leaves to someone else: 
who in certain cases is an expert, a carpenter, for instance, or 
a physician. The attributes which, though inseparable, are not 
regarded as properties of body of a given sort, but are reached 
by abstraction, fall within the province of the mathematician: 
while attributes which are regarded as having separate exist- 
ence fall to the first philosopher or metaphysician. But to 
return to the point of digression. We were saying that the 
attributes of the soul are as such, —I mean, as anger and 
fear, inseparable from the physical matter of the animals to 
which they belong, and not, like line and surface, separable in 
thought. 
CHAPTER II — EARLY PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES 
In our enquiry concerning soul it is necessary to state the 
problems which must be solved as we proceed, and at the same 
time tocollect the views of our predecessors * who had anything 
to say on the subject, in order that we may adopt what is right 
in their conclusions and guard against their mistakes. Our en- 
quiry will begin by presenting what are commonly held to be in 
a special degree the natural attributes of soul. Now there are 
two points especially wherein that which is animate is held to 
differ from the inanimate, namely, motion and the act of sensa- 
tion: and these are approximately the two characteristics of soul 
handed down to us by our predecessors. There are some who 
* Aristotle introduces here the first extant history of psychological theo- 
ries.  
-P-A-G-E-28
    6 ANAXAGORAS 
maintain that soul is preéminently and primarily the cause of 
movement. But they imagined that that which is not itself in 
motion cannot move anything else, and thus they regarded the 
soul as a thing which is in motion. Hence Democritus affirms 
the soul to be a sort of fire or heat. For the “shapes” or atoms 
are infinite and those which are spherical he declares to be fire 
and soul: they may be compared with the so-called motes in the 
air, which are seen in the sunbeams that enter through our win- 
dows. The aggregate of such seeds, he tells us, forms the consti- 
tuent elementsof the whole of nature (and herein he agrees with 
Leucippus), while those of them which are spherical form the 
soul, because such figures most easily find their way through 
everything and, being themselves in motion, set other things in 
motion. The atomists assume that it is the soul which imparts 
motion to animals. It is for this reason that they make life de- 
pend upon respiration. For, when the surrounding air presses 
upon bodies and tends to extrude those atomic shapes which, 
because they are never at rest themselves, impart motion to 
animals, then they are reinforced from outside by the entry of 
other like atoms in respiration, which in fact, by helping to 
check compression and solidification, prevent the escape of the 
atoms already contained in the animals; and life, so they hold, 
continues so long as there is strength to do this. The doctrine 
of the Pythagoreans seems also to contain the same thought. 
Some of them identified soul with the motes in the air, others 
with that which sets these motes in motion: and as to these 
motes it has been stated that they are seen to be in incessant 
motion, even though there be a perfect calm. The view of 
others who describe the soul as that which moves itself tends in 
the same direction. For it would seem that all these thinkers 
regard motion as the most distinctive characteristic of the soul. 
Everything else, they think, is moved by the soul, but the soul is 
moved by itself: and this because they never see anything cause 
motion without itself being in motion. Similarly the soul is said 
to be the moving principle by Anaxagoras and all others who 
have held that mind sets the universe in motion; but not alto- 
gether in the same sense as by Democritus. The latter, indeed,
-P-A-G-E-29
    ARISTOTLE’S DE ANIMA 7 
absolutely identified soul and mind, holding that the presenta- 
tion to the senses is the truth: hence, he observed, Homer had 
well sung of Hector in his swoon that he lay ‘with other 
thoughts.’ Democritus, then, does not use the term mind to de- 
note a faculty conversant with truth, but regards mind as iden- 
tical with soul. Anaxagoras, however, is less exact in his use of 
the terms. In many places he speaks of mind as the cause of 
goodness and order, but elsewhere he identifies it with the soul: 
as where he attributes it to all animals, both great and small, 
high and low. As a matter of fact, however, mind in the sense 
of intelligence would not seem to be present in all animals alike, 
nor even in all men. 
Those, then, who have directed their attention to the motion 
of the animate being, conceived the soul as that which is most 
capable of causing motion: while those who laid stress on its 
knowledge and perception of all that exists identified the soul 
with the ultimate principles, whether they recognised a plu- 
rality of these or only one. Thus Empedocles compounded soul 
out of all the elements, while at the same time regarding each 
oneof them as a soul. His words are ‘‘ With earth we see earth, 
with water water, with air bright air, but ravaging fire by fire, 
love by love, and strife by gruesome strife.”” In the same man- 
ner Plato in the Timaeus constructs the soul out of the ele- 
ments. Like, he there maintains, is known by like, and the 
things we know are composed of the ultimate principles. In 
like manner it was explained in the lectures on philosophy, 
that the self-animal or universe is made up of the idea of One, 
and of the idea-numbers Two, or primary length, Three, pri- 
mary breadth, and Four, primary depth, and similarly with all 
the rest of the ideas. And again this has been put in another 
way as follows: reason isthe One, knowledge is the Two, because 
it proceeds by a single road to one conclusion, opinion is the 
number of a surface, Three, and sensation the number of a solid, 
Four. In fact, according to them the numbers, though they are 
the ideas themselves, or the ultimate principles, are neverthe- 
less derived from elements. And things are judged, some by 
reason, others by knowledge, others again by opinion and others
-P-A-G-E-30
  8 EMPEDOCLES 
by sensation: while these idea-numbers are forms of things. 
And since the soul was held to be thus cognitive as well as 
capable of causing motion, some thinkers have combined the 
two and defined the soul as a self-moving number. 
But there are differences of opinion as to the nature and 
number of the ultimate principles, especially between those 
thinkers who make the principles corporeal and those who make 
them incorporeal; and again between both of these and others 
who combine the two and take their principles from both. But, 
further, they differ also as to their number: some assuming a 
single principle, some a plurality. And, when they come to give 
an account of the soul, they do so in strict accordance with their 
several views. For they have assumed, not unnaturally, that 
the soul is that primary causewhich in its own nature is capable 
of producing motion. And this is why some identified soul with 
fire, this being the element which is made up of the finest parti- 
cles and is most nearly incorporeal, while further it is preémi- 
nently an element which both moves and sets other things in 
motion. Democritus has expressed more neatly the reason for 
each of these facts. Soul he regards as identical with mind, and 
this he makes to consist of the primary indivisible bodies and 
considers it to be a cause of motion from the fineness of its par- 
ticles and their shape. Now the shape which is most susceptible 
of motion is the spherical; and of atoms of this shape mind, 
like fire, consists. Anaxagoras, while apparently understand- 
ing by mind something different from soul, as we remarked 
above, really treats both as a single nature, except that it is 
preéminently mind which he takes as his first principle; he 
says at any rate that mind alone of things that exist is simple, 
unmixed, pure. But he refers both knowledge and motion to 
the same principle, when he says that mind sets the universe in 
motion. Thales, too, apparently, judging from the anecdotes 
related of him, conceived soul as a cause of motion, if it be true 
that he affirmed the loadstone to possess soul, because it at- 
tracts iron. Diogenes, however, as also some others, identified 
soul with air. Air, they thought, is made up of the finest parti- 
cles and is the first principle: and this explains the fact that the
-P-A-G-E-31
  ARISTOTLE’S DE ANIMA 9 
soul knows and is a cause of motion, knowing by virtue of being 
the primary element from which all else is derived, and causing 
motion by the extreme fineness of its parts. Heraclitus takes 
soul for his first principle, as he identifies it with the vapour 
from which he derives all other things, and further says that it 
is the least corporeal of things and in ceaseless flux; and that 
it is by something in motion that what is in motion is known; 
for he, like most philosophers, conceived all that exists to be 
in motion. Alcmaeon, too, seems to have had a similar concep- 
tion. For soul, he maintains, is immortal because it is like the 
beings which are immortal; and it has this attribute in virtue of 
being ever in motion: for he attributes continuousand unending 
motion to everything which is divine, moon, sun, stars and the 
whole heaven. Among cruder thinkers there have been some, 
like Hippon, who have even asserted the soul to be water. The 
reason for this view seems to have been the fact that in all ani- 
mals the seed is moist: in fact, Hippon refutes those who make 
the soul to be blood by pointing out that the seed is not blood, 
and that this seed is the rudimentary soul. Others, again, like 
Critias, maintain the soul to be blood, holding that it is sentience 
which is most distinctive of soul and that this is due to the 
nature of blood. Thus each of the four elements except earth 
has found its supporter. Earth, however, has not been put for- 
ward by anyone, except by those who have explained the soul 
to be derived from, or identical with, all the elements. 
Thus practically all define the soul by three characteristics, 
motion, perception and incorporeality; and each of these char- 
acteristics is referred to the ultimate principles. Hence all who 
define soul by its capacity for knowledge either make it an ele- 
ment or derive it from the elements, being on this point, with 
oneexception,in generalagreement. Like, they tell us,is known 
by like; and therefore, since the soul knows all things, they say 
it consists of all the ultimate principles. Thus those thinkers 
who admit only one cause and one element, as fire or air, assume 
the soul also to be oneelement; while those whoadmita plurality 
of principles assume plurality also in the soul. Anaxagoras alone 
says that mind cannot be acted upon and has nothing in com-  
-P-A-G-E-32
10 DEMOCRITUS 
mon with any other thing. How, if such be its nature, it will 
know anything and how its knowledge is to be explained, he 
has omitted to state; nor do his utterances afford a clue. All 
those who introduce pairs of opposites among their principles 
make the soul also to consist of opposites; while those who take 
one or other of the two opposites, either hot or cold or some- 
thing else of the sort, reduce the soul also to one or other of these 
elements. Hence, too, they etymologise according to their the- 
ories; some identify soul with heat, deriving Sj» from feiv, and 
contend that this identity accounts for the word for life; others 
say that what is cold is called soul from the respiratory process 
and consequent “cooling down,” deriving yuy7 from wuyxew. 
Such, then, are the views regarding soul which have come down 
to us and the grounds on which they are held.

and the non-existence of things which exist not (trav peév dvTwr, ds 
€or, TOV 8é ph dvT@V, ws od« Eotv). Have you never read that? 
Theaet. Yes, many a time. 
Soc. Does he not mean that things exist for me as they ap- 
pear (faivntac) to me, and for you as they appear to you, since 
you and I are men? 
Theaet. So he says, at any rate. 
Soc. As it is highly probable that a wise man does not talk 
nonsense, let us look for his meaning. Sometimes when the 
wind is blowing on all alike is not one of us cold and another 
not, or one slightly and another exceedingly cold? 
Theaet. No doubt. 
Soc. In that case shall we say that the wind in itself (ado é¢” 
éavr¢) is cold or not cold? Or shall we agree with Protagoras 
that it is cold to him who is cold and not to him who is not? 
Theaet. Protagoras seems to be right.

  12 PROTAGORAS 
Soc. Then it is to each as it appears to him? 
Theaet. Yes. 
Soc. And what appears is perceived? 
Theaet. Truly. 
Soc. Then in the case of such things as heat and cold appear- 
ance (favracia) and perception are one and the same. Every 
such thing, I daresay, exists as it is perceived? 
Theaet. That would seem to be so. 
Soc. And perception of reality (rod dvros), since it is know- 
ledge, can never be false? 
Theaet. So it appears. 
Soc. Then charmingly keen-witted was it of Protagoras to 
hint darkly at these things to us of the common crowd, while 
telling the truth to his disciples in secret. 
Theaet. What do you mean by that, Socrates? 
Soc. I shall tell you of a by no means contemptible theory 
to the effect that nothing exists purely by itself (ad76 xa’ aire), 
nor can you rightly give anything an exclusive name. If you 
speak of the large, you suggest the small, if of the heavy, you 
suggest the light, and so on. Nothing, be it either an attribute 
(rvs), or a kind of thing (67rovovobv), exists alone (évds). 
Moreover, it is inaccurate to speak of existence as the result of 
motion, collision and combination, since nothing really exists, 
but everything is always in process of change (yéyverar). On 
this point the whole array of wise men, except Parmenides, are 
agreed, Protagoras, Heraclitus, Empedocles, also the most 
famous names in both kinds of poetry, in comedy Epicharmus, 
and in tragedy Homer. When Homer says: Ocean and mother 
Tethys are the parents of the gods, he means that all the gods 
have sprung from ceaseless movement (fofs Te Kal xivijcews). 
Do you not think that this was his view? 
Theaet. Yes. 
Soc. Could we contend with this mighty host, whose captain 
is Homer, without laying ourselves open to ridicule? 
Theaet. It would be a risk, Socrates. 
Soc. Yes indeed, Theaetetus, since there are good proofs that 
what appears to be and comes into existence is produced by
-P-A-G-E-35
PLATO’S THEAETETUS 13 
motion, and what does not exist and perishes is produced by 
rest. For example, heat and fire, which produce and nourish 
everything else, are themselves produced by friction, which is 
motion. Is not that the source of fire? 
Theaet. Yes. 
Soc. And has not the race (yévos) of animals sprung from 
the same source? 
Theaet. It has surely. 
Soc. Why, what else? Is not the fashion (és) of the body 
destroyed by rest and inaction and preserved largely by exercise 
and movement? 
Theaet. Certainly. 
Soc. And the soul, is it not taught and preserved and im- 
proved by study and practice, which are motions, while through 
idleness, neglect and inattention it fails to learn, or what it 
learns it forgets? 
Theaet. That is true. 
Soc. Is motion not a good, then, for soul and body, and rest 
the reverse of good? 
Theaet. Evidently. 
Soc. May I not say further that storms preserve, while still- 
ness and calm and all such states of rest corrupt and destroy? 
And I am constrained to give this crowning illustration, that so 
long as the universe and the golden chain, as Homer calls the 
sun, move onward in their course, all things divine and human 
manifestly contrive to exist and are preserved; but, if they 
should stand still, everything would be destroyed, and then 
would come to pass the saying that the whole world is turned 
upside down. 
Theaet. Your explanation, I think, is clear, Socrates. 
Soc. Consider this, my friend, with regard first of all to the 
sense of sight. What you call whiteness does not exist in your 
eyes nor as an object outside of them, nor could you assign to it 
any particular place, for it would then be something fixed and 
stationary and not continuously generated. 
Theaet. How is that? 
Soc. Let us apply our former argument, in which we decided
-P-A-G-E-36
  
  14 PROTAGORAS 
that nothing exists as one thing and utterly by itself, and it will 
appear that white, black, or any other colour is produced when 
the glance of the eye comes into contact with the proper mo- 
tion. What we call a colour is neither the eye nor the object, 
but something which arises between them, and is different with 
different individuals. Or, would you contend that a colour ap- 
pears to you as it does to an animal, a dog for instance? 
Theaet. No indeed, I would not. 
Soc. Then would you hold that two human beings might 
have the same perceptions? Are you not sure, rather, that not 
even to yourself does a thing twice appear the same, since both 
you and it are continually changing? 
Theaet. Yes, I feel sure of that. 
Soc. Yet if the object, which we touch and compare in size 
with ourselves, be large or white or hot, it would not, when 
contrasted with one thing, be different from what it is when 
contrasted with another, provided that it itself had suffered no 
change. Or, if it is the faculty, whether of measuring or touch, 
which is large or white or hot, then, if it were itself unmodified, 
it would not be changed merely by experiencing and coming 
into contact with different objects. So, you see, our want of 
thought leads us into amazing absurdities, as Protagoras and 
his school would say. 
Theaet. What do you mean by that? 
Soc. You will understand what I mean, if I use a simple 
illustration. If you take six dice, you would say that they, when. 
compared with four, were more by half as many again, and 
when compared with twelve they were less and only one-half. 
Could you deny the truth of that? 
Theaet. No indeed. 
Soc. Well then, if Protagoras or somebody else says to you, 
O Theaetetus, can a thing possibly become more or greater, 
unless it be increased? What will you answer? 
Theaet. If I answer the simple question as I really think, 
I must say No, but in view of what you have just said and to 
avoid a contradiction, I must say Yes. 
Soc. Well and divinely spoken, friend! And yet it strikes me 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  PLATO’S THEAETETUS 15 
that if you say Yes, it will be with you according to the saying 
of Euripides: ‘The tongue will be unrefuted, but the mind not 
unrefuted.’ 
Theaet. True. 
Soc. If we had been veteran sophists (Se:vol nal cool), you 
and I, and had carefully scrutinized all the things of the 
mind, we would at the very outset have made an abundant 
trial of our opponents, as they of us; we would have come up to 
the contest warily (copiers), and there would have been a 
clashing of words with words. But, as it is, we are only private 
folks whose foremost wish is to behold things as they are (adra 
mpos avtd), and to see if our thoughts are consistent or not. 
Theaet. That is certainly my desire. 
Soc. And mine. Shall we not, then, as we have lots of time, 
retrace our steps a little, and examine ourselves calmly and 
earnestly, in order to see what these images in us are? The first 
of them we shall, I think, decide to be that nothing ever be- 
comes more or less either in size or number, while it is equal to 
itself. Is not that so? 
Theaet. Yes. 
Soc. And the second is that that, to which nothing is added 
and from which nothing is taken away, is neither increased nor 
diminished, but is always equal to itself. 
Theaet. Assuredly. 
Soc. Is there not a third, that nothing, which did not exist 
before, can now exist, without becoming and having become ? 
Theaet. Agreed. 
Soc. These three postulates, I think, were striving together 
in our soul when we spoke of the dice, and are present again in 
the following instance: Suppose that you were shorter than I at 
the beginning of the year, but taller at the end, not because I 
had diminished in size, for men of my age do not change, but 
because you, who are young, had meanwhile grown. It is mani- 
fest that I was once what I was not afterwards, although I had 
not become. For, as to have become is plainly impossible with- 
out becoming, I could not have become smaller without losing 
in size. And there are thousands of similar instances, if indeed 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  16 PROTAGORAS 
we choose to admit them. I see that you follow me, Theaetetus, 
for you are likely not unacquainted with such puzzles. 
Theaet. By the gods, Socrates, when I look into them I am 
smitten with wonder, and truly sometimes my brain reels. 
Soc. So Theodorus made not a bad guess at your disposi- 
tion, my friend, since the very state of a philosopher is wonder. 
Indeed the man seems to have been a wise genealogist who said 
that Iris was the daughter of Thaumas, for wonder is the only 
beginning of philosophy. Do you begin to understand what is 
the solution of your difficulty on the views which we are ascrib- 
ing to Protagoras? 
Theaet. Not yet. 
Soc. Will you count it a favour if I examine with you into the 
secret reasoning, which is held as the truth by him and other 
celebrated men ? 
Theaet. I will count it a very great favour. 
Soc. Look over the company, so that no profane person may 
overhear. For there are people who believe in nothing but what 
they can fasten upon with both hands, contending that action 
and generation and all the things, which are not seen, do not 
exist at all. 
Theaet. They must be hardened and repulsive creatures. 
Soc. That they are, my boy, utterly illiterate. But it is 
another much more subtle sect, of whose mysteries I mean to 
inform you. Their first principle, that upon which our state- 
ment depends, is that all is motion (7d wav xivyots) or that 
nothing exists except motion. There are two kinds (e?6n) of 
motion, each unlimited in its range, to act and to suffer or be 
acted upon. From the strife and union of these two powers 
(Suvdpes) is produced an innumerable brood twofold in its 
nature, namely the object of sense, and sense, which is always 
connate and coincident with it, object. The sensible percep- 
tions are called sight, hearing, smell, the sense of hot and cold, 
and also pleasures, pains, desires and fears. These and many 
others have names, and there are numberless others withcut 
names. Correlative with sight are colours of all kinds, sounds 
with hearing, and with each of the other senses its kindred
-P-A-G-E-39
  PLATO’S THEAETETUS 17 
objects. Has this tale anything to do, Theaetetus, with what 
has gone before? Do you know? 
Theaet. Socrates, I do not. 
Soc. Give heed, then, and you shall see the connection. Al 
these things, as we have said, are in movement. Now in the 
movement of them there are swiftness and slowness. That 
which is slow moves in one place, and is affected by things close 
at hand, and so produces, but the things produced by it are 
swifter, since their movement is a change of place. Let us sup- 
pose that the eye and its corresponding visible object approach 
and produce whiteness and the concomitant sensation, a result 
which would not take place if either the eye or the object came 
into contact with anything else. When the union of these two 
occurs, sight moving from the eye and meeting whiteness mov- 
ing from the object, which helps to produce the colour, the eye 
becomes filled with vision, and now sees, and becomes not vision 
but seeing eye. The object, in turn, having aided in making 
the colour, is filled with whiteness, and becomes not whiteness 
but white, be it wood or stone or any object, which chanced to 
be of this colour. All other sensations, hard, warm and the rest, 
must be treated in the same way. Not one of them, as we have 
said already, can be understood as having any existence of itself 
(ai7é xa? abr), but all are produced by movement through 
union each with its proper counterpart. There can be no solid 
cognition (vofcar), as they say, of either the active element or 
the passive element taken separately (é évds); for there is an 
active element only as it is found in union with the passive, and 
a passive element only as it is found in union with the active. 
The uniting and active element, when it comes into contact with 
another thing, is to be regarded as passive. Accordingly on all 
these counts, nothing, as we said at the outset, exists as one 
thing by itself (€ ai7d xa@’ aird), but everything always 
becomes for some other thing (rum yéyvec@a). Being or 
existence (76 efvac) must be thoroughly eradicated, though we 
are often, as just now, compelled, it would seem, through cus- 
tom and ignorance to make use of the term. And yet, according 
to the wise (o/ copo/), we must not permit anyone to use such
-P-A-G-E-40
ee 
18 PROTAGORAS 
expressions as ‘it’ or ‘of it’ or ‘mine’ or ‘this’ or ‘that’ or any 
other name which gives fixity, but only to conform to nature 
and say that things become, are in process of creation, and are 
being destroyed and changed. Thus, if anyone in an argument 
establishes anything, he is easy to refute. Besides, we must 
speak in this way not only of separate things but of any collec- 
tion, such as man, stone, any species of animal or any genus 
(eidos). Do these things seem pleasant to you, Theaetetus, 
and have they a grateful flavour? 
Theaet. I am sure I do not know, Socrates, for I cannot de- 
cide whether you believe what you say or are only making trial 
of me. 
Soc. You really forget, my friend, that I know nothing and 
produce nothing of my own, for I am childless. But I wait on 
you, and therefore seek to charm you by giving you to taste of 
every philosopher (co¢ds), until at last I may have aided in 
bringing your theory out into the light. When this is done, I 
shall see whether it is an empty thing or a genuine reality. So, 
be bold, and persevere, and answer sturdily to what I ask you. 
Theaet. Well then, put your questions. 
Soc. Tell me again if you are satisfied that nothing is, but all 
is ever becoming, the good and beautiful as well as all the things 
which we have just enumerated. 
Theaet. To speak frankly, when I hear your argument in 
detail, I think it very reasonable and must accept it. 
Soc. Let us, then, see the theory completed. It remains to 
speak of dreams and diseases, especially madness with its 
illusions of sight and hearing and other senses. In all these 
cases, as you must admit, the position which we have just taken 
seems to be refuted, since manifestly there arise in ourselves 
perceptions which are false. Consequently what appears to 
each person is far from being real; on the exact contrary not a 
single appearance is real. 
Theaet. You speak truly, Socrates. 
Soc. What argument (Adyos), my boy, is left to him who 
holds that sensible perception is knowledge, and that each one’s 
appearances (ra pacvdpeva) are for him real?
-P-A-G-E-41
ne eee er nee ee 
PLATO’S THEAETETUS 19 
Theaet. I hesitate to tell you, Socrates, that I do not know 
what to say, because you reproved me a moment ago for giving 
this answer. Yet I cannot, indeed, argue that madmen and 
dreamers think truly, some in supposing that they are gods, 
and others in dreaming that they have wings and are flying. 
Soc. Do you not perceive that in these cases, especially in 
dreams and madness, a rejoinder may be made of this nature? 
Theaet. Of what nature? 
Soc. You have doubtless often heard it asked: What proof 
would you give, if you were questioned at this moment whether 
we are sleeping and dreaming all this discussion, or awake and 
conversing about a waking thought? 
Theaet. Truly, Socrates, it would be hard to prove it, for 
sleep and waking are equally real, and one is the counterpart 
of the other. There is nothing to prevent our supposing that 
we are now talking together in our sleep. And when in dreams 
we seem to be telling our dreams, such a state strangely resem- 
bles our waking life. : 
Soc. It is not hard, you see, to carry on the dispute, when it 
may be doubted even whether we are asleep or awake. If we 
divide time about equally between sleep and waking, in each 
period our souls are maintaining that their present opinions 
(8éyuara) are true. Thus for one half of our days we say that 
some opinions are true, and for the other half that different 
opinions are true. Yet we hold fast by both. 
Theaet. Clearly. 
Soc. Does not the same argument apply to diseases and mad- 
ness, except only that the time is not divided equally? 
Theaet. True. 
Soc. And is the truth to be determined by length or shortness 
of time? 
Theaet. That would be absurd. 
Soc. Can you by any other way clearly show on which side 
the truth is? 
Theaet. I think not. 
Soc. You shall hear, then, what is said about this by those 
who determine that what seems (7a Soxodvra) to anyone to be   
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  20 PROTAGORAS 
true is true for him. They would put some such question as this 
to you, “‘O Theaetetus, can two things entirely different have 
the same quality (Svvayis)?”’ Their question, let us understand, 
is of things not partially but wholly different. 
Theaet. Things utterly different cannot possibly have a 
quality or anything else the same. 
Soc. Must we confess that these things are therefore un- 
like? 
Theaet. I should say so. 
Soc. Suppose that a thing happened to become like or unlike 
itself or another thing, shall we say that what is made like be- 
comes the same, and what unlike different? 
Theaet. We must. 
Soc. We said before, did we not, that the active elements 
were many and infinite, and likewise the passive elements? 
Theaet. Yes. 
Soc. And if a thing combines with different things, the pro- 
ducts will be different? 
Theaet. Surely. 
Soc. Let us apply this to you or me or anything, Socrates 
sick and Socrates well, for example. Shall we say that these 
are like or unlike? 
Theaet. Am I to take Socrates sick as one separate whole, 
and Socrates well as another? 
Soc. You understand exactly; that is what 1 mean. 
Theaet. They are unlike doubtless. 
Soc. And different because unlike? 
Theaet. Necessarily. 
Soc. And will you say the same of Socrates asleep or in the 
other states we mentioned? 
Theaet. I would. 
Soc. Then would I not be affected by any active element in 
nature differently in sickness and in health? 
Theaet. How could it be otherwise? 
Soc. Would not the active element and I, the patient, pro- 
duce a different result in each case? 
Theaet. Certainly.
-P-A-G-E-43
  PLATO’S THEAETETUS 21 
Soc. The wine I drink when I am in health appears to me 
sweet and pleasant? 
Theaet. Yes. 
Soc. It follows from our previous admissions that the active 
and passive elements, when they unite, produce sweetness and 
the sensation of sweetness. The sensation arising from the 
patient renders the tongue percipient, and sweetness moving in 
the wine and arising from it meets the healthy tongue, and 
causes the wine both to be and to appear sweet. 
Theaet. That is the consequence of what we formerly ad- 
mitted. 
Soc. But when I am sick, does not the object affect a person 
who, because unlike, is really different? 
Theaet. Yes. 
Soc. In that case Socrates and the drinking of the wine pro- 
duce a different result, the sensation of bitterness in the tongue 
and bitterness moving in the wine. The wine becomes not 
bitterness but bitter, and I become not perception but per- 
ceiving. 
Theaet. Certainly. 
Soc. There is no other thing, from which I shall ever receive 
the same perception. The perception of different things is 
different, and makes him, who perceives, of another nature and 
another man. Nor does the object, which affects me, produce 
the same result and become the same object, when it comes into 
contact with another person. When objects produce different 
results in contact with different subjects, they become of an- 
other nature. 
Theaet. It is true. 
Soc. The object and I will not become what we are inde- 
pendently of each other. 
Theaet. By no means. 
Soc. I must become percipient of something when I perceive, 
for it is impossible in perceiving to perceive nothing. And when 
the object becomes sweet or bitter or something else, it must do 
so for some one, since to become sweet and yet sweet for no- 
body is not possible.  
-P-A-G-E-44
  22 SOCRATES 
Theaet. Assuredly not. 
Soc. We must conclude that the object and I are or become 
only one for the other. Necessity couples us to each other, but 
does not couple our joint existence to any other thing or even 
to ourselves. Each is bound simply to the other. Accordingly 
when a thing is said to be or become, it must be spoken of as for 
or of or in regard to something. The argument, which we have 
traversed, points out that no one must say, or permit anyone 
else to say, that anything is or becomes wholly of itself (advo 
é¢’ abrod). 
Theaet. No, by no means, Socrates. 
Soc. When anything, which affects me, exists for me and no 
other person, is it not perceived by me and no other? 
Theaet. That is evident. 
Soc. Then my sensation is true for me since it is inseparable 
from my existence. As Protagoras says, I am judge both of the 
existence of what is for me and the non-existence of what is not. 
Theaet. That seems to be the case. 
Soc. If I am infallible and sure-footed in my judgments con- 
cerning being (7a dvra) and becoming (ra yeyveueva), how can 
I fail to know that of which I am the percipient (aic@nr7s)? 
Theaet. Not in any way. 
Soc. Right noble, then, was your decision that knowledge 
was nothing else than perception. Homer and Heraclitus with 
their crew, who say that all things flow and are in a state of 
motion, and the all-wise Protagoras with his view that man is 
the measure of all things, and Theaetetus, who concludes from 
these theories that knowledge is sensation, are all of one accord. 
Is that not true, O Theaetetus? Shall we call this result the 
young child at whose birth I have assisted? Or what do you 
say? 
Theaet. It must be so, Socrates. 
Steph. 184b. 
Soc. Once again, Theaetetus, address yourself to our former 
inquiry. You answered that knowledge was sensible percep- 
tion, did you not?
-P-A-G-E-45
  PLATO’S THEAETETUS 23 
Theaet. Yes. 
Soc. If some one were to put this question to you, With what 
does a man see white and black colours and with what does he 
hear high and low tones? you would say, I think, with his eyes 
and ears. 
Theaet. I should. 
Soc. To handle names and terms freely and without critical 
minuteness is often a mark of wide culture, and though the 
opposite is as a rule churlish, it is sometimes, as in the present 
instance, a necessity. For I must indicate a want of exactness 
in this very answer. Reflect, is it more correct to say that it 
is with the eyes (6b0adpois) that we see or through them (&”’ 
6p0adrpv), and that it is with the ears or through them that 
we hear? 
Theaet. I think ‘through’ is better, Socrates. 
Soc. Surely, for it would be a singular thing, my lad, if each 
of us was, as it were, a wooden horse, and within us were seated 
many separate senses, since manifestly these senses unite into 
one nature (é6éa), call it the soul or what you will; and it is 
with this central form through the organs of sense that we per- 
ceive sensible objects. 
Theaet. I agree with your view; the contrary would indeed be 
singular. 
Soc. I am precise with you, in order to find out if it is with 
one and the same part of ourselves that we have various im- 
pressions, although at the same time through different facul- 
ties. Would you, if you were asked, refer all our impressions to 
the body? But perhaps you would answer better without my 
interference. Tellme, then, do you assign the faculties, through 
which you perceive hot and hard and light and sweet, to the 
body or to something else? 
Theaet. To the body. 
Soc. And would you be willing to allow that what you per- 
ceive through one faculty (Svvayis) you cannot perceive 
through another? You cannot, that is, hear through the eye 
or see through the ear? 
Theaet. I grant that readily.  
-P-A-G-E-46
  24 SOCRATES 
Soc. If you make a judgment common to the two organs 
(épyava), you cannot perceive it through either of them. 
Theaet. Certainly not. 
Soc. In the case of sound and colour you may surely decide 
that they both are. 
Theaet. Surely. * 
Soc. Is not each different (érepov) from the other and the 
same (radrov) with itself? 
Theaet. No doubt. 
Soc. They are two and each is one? 
Theaet. I grant that also. 
Soc. You would be able to observe whether they are like or 
unlike each other? 
Theaet. Probably. 
Soc. Through what do you make these several judgments? 
For it is not possible either through hearing or sight to get any- 
thing common to the two (76 xowdv). Let us take an illustra- 
tion. Suppose it to be a sensible question to ask whether you 
judge colours and sounds to be saline or not, you would be able 
to say what faculty you would use in order to decide, and this 
faculty would be not sight or hearing but some other. 
Theaet. Another of course, the faculty of taste. 
Soc. That is well said. And what faculty will reveal to you 
the common elements not only of sensible qualities, but of all 
things, those elements, I mean, which you call being (76 éo7w) 
and not being (76 od« éorwv) and the others, about which we 
were speaking a moment ago? To what organ will you attribute 
our perception of each of these? 
Theaet. You allude to being (otcfa) and not being (76 pi) 
elvat), likeness (Guotdrns) and unlikeness, the same (70 radrdv) 
and the other (7d Grepnv), and unity (é) also, and other 
numbers applicable to things, and you evidently wish to know 
through what bodily instrument the soul perceives odd (zrepit7év) 
and even (dptov) and all that is akin to them. 
Soc. You follow me surpassingly well, Theaetetus; that is 
just what I want. 
Theaet. Verily, Socrates, I cannot tell what to say, if not that
-P-A-G-E-47
  
PLATO’S THEAETETUS 25 
these things unlike sensible objects seem to need no special 
organ, but that the soul contemplates the common elements 
(za xowd) of all things through itself (&’ atrjs). 
Soc. You are beautiful, Theaetetus, and not ill-favoured, as 
Theodorus said, for he who says beautiful things, is beautiful and 
good. And not only are you beautiful but you have done well in 
delivering me from a long harangue, if you are satisfied that 
some things the soul contemplates through itself and others 
through the bodily faculties. For that was my opinion too, and 
I was anxious for you to agree with me. 
Theaet. I am convinced of the truth of that. 
Soc. On which side would you place being, which is in a 
unique way associated with all things? 
Theaet. I would place it amongst those things, which the soul

Soc. And would you place there the like and unlike, the 
same and the other? 
Theaet. Yes. 
Soc. And what of the noble and base, good and evil? 
Theaet. In this case quite specially the soul views the essence 
(ovcéa) of each in relation to its opposite, contrasting within 
itself the past and present with the future. 
Soc. Stay a moment. Does the soul not perceive the hard- 
ness of a hard object through the touch, and in the same way 
the softness of a soft object? 
Theaet. Yes. 
Soc. But the essence and existence of these, and the opposi- 
tion of each to the other, and the essence of this opposition, the 
soul itself judges, bringing them all together and passing them 
in review. 
Theaet. Certainly. 
Soc. Men and animals from their very birth perceive by 
nature those feelings (7a0a7a) which reach the soul through 
the body; but reflections (4vaNoy(cuara) on the essence of these 
and on their use come to those who have them only after effort 
and with the lapse of years through education and a wide ex- 
perience,

Theaet, That is very true. 
Soc. Is it possible to gain truth, if we have no hold of being? 
Theaet. Impossible. 
Soc. If we fall short of the truth of anything, can we be said 
to know it? 
Theaet. By no means, Socrates. 
Soc. Then in feelings there is no knowledge but only in rea- 
sonings (ovAAoyiopo0) upon them, for in reasonings it is pos- 
sible to touch being and truth, but in feelings it is impossible. 
Theaet. That is evident. 
Soc. Do you call reasonings and feelings, the same, when 
they differ so widely? 
Theaet. That would hardly be just. 
Soc. What name do you give to seeing, hearing, smelling, 
being cold and being. warm? 
Theaet. Perceiving, I would call them. I have no other 
name. 
Soc. Perception then, you say, covers them all? 
Theaet. It must. 
Soc. And this has no share in truth, because it lays not hold 
on being. 
Theaet. None. 
Soc. Then it has no share in knowledge. 
Theaet. No. 
Soc. Then, Theaetetus, sensible perception and knowledge 
will never be the same. 
Theaet. Clearly not, Socrates; indeed it is now quite evident 
that knowledge and sensation are different.

SOCRATES GLAUCON 
Steph. 435. 
I PROCEEDED to ask: When two things, a greater and a less, 
are called by a common name, are they, in so far as the common 
name applies, unlike or like? 
Like. 
Then a just man will not differ from a just state, so far as 
the idea of justice is involved, but the two will be like. 
They will. 
Well, but we resolved that a state was just, when the three 
classes of characters present in it were severally occupied in 
doing their proper work: and that it was temperate, and brave, 
and wise, in consequence of certain affections and conditions of 
these same classes. 
True. 
Then, my friend, we shall also adjudge, in the case of the 
individual man, that, supposing him to possess in his soul the 
same generic parts, he is rightly entitled to the same names as 
the state, in virtue of affections of these parts identical with 
those of the classes in the state. 
It must inevitably be so.

28 PLATO 
Once more then, my excellent friend, we have stumbled on 
an easy question concerning the nature of the soul, namely, 
whether it contains these three generic parts or not. 
Not so very easy a question, I think: but perhaps, Socrates, 
the common saying is true, that the beautiful is difficult. 
It would appear so; and I tell you plainly, Glaucon, that in 
my opinion we shall never attain to exact truth on this subject, 
by such methods as we are employing in our present discussion. 
However, the path that leads to that goal is too long and toil- 
some; and I dare say we may arrive at the truth by our present 
methods, in a manner not unworthy of our former arguments 
and speculations. 
Shall we not be content with that? For my part it would 
satisfy me for the present. 
Well, certainly it will be quite enough for me. 
Do not flag then, but proceed with the inquiry. 
Tell me then, I continued, can we possibly refuse to admit 
that there exist in each of us the same generic parts and char- 
acteristics as are found in the state? For I presume the state 
has not received them from any other source. It would be 
ridiculous to imagine that the presence of the spirited element 
in cities is not to be traced to individuals, wherever this char- 
acter is imputed to the people, as it is to the natives of Thrace, 
and Scythia, and generally speaking, of the northern countries; 
or the love of knowledge, which would be chiefly attributed to 
our own country; or the love of riches, which people would es- 
pecially connect with the Phoenicians and the Egyptians. 
Certainly. 
This then is a fact so far, and one which it is not difficult to 
apprehend. 
No, it is not. 
But here begins a difficulty. Are all our actions alike per- 
formed by the one predominant faculty, or are there three fac- 
ulties operating severally in our different actions? Do we learn 
with one internal faculty, and become angry with another, and 
with a third feel desire for all the pleasures connected with eat- 
ing and drinking, and the propagation of the species; or upon   
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE REPUBLIC 29 
every impulse to action, do we perform these several operations 
with the whole soul? The difficulty will consist in settling these 
points in a satisfactory manner. 
I think so too. 
Let us try therefore the following plan, in order to ascertain 
whether the faculties engaged are distinct or identical. 
What is your plan? 4 
It is manifest that the same thing cannot do two opposite 
things, or be in two opposite states, in the same part of it, and 
with reference to the same object; so that where we find these 
phenomena occurring, we shall know that the subjects of them 
are not identical, but more than one. 
Very well. 
Now consider what I say. 
Speak on. 
Is it possible for the same thing to be at the same time, and 
in the same part of it, at rest and in motion? 
Certainly not. 
Let us come toa still more exact understanding, lest we should 
chance to differ as we proceed. If it were said of a man who is 
standing still, but moving his hands and his head, that the same 
individual is at the same time at rest and in motion, we should 
not, I imagine, allow this to be a correct way of speaking, but 
should say, that part of the man is at rest, and part in motion: 
should we not? 
We should. 
And if the objector should indulge in yet further pleasan- 
tries, so far refining as to say, that at any rate a top is wholly 
at rest and in motion at the same time, when it spins with its 
peg fixed on a given spot, or that anything else revolving in the 
same place, is an instance of the same thing, we should reject 
his illustration, because in such cases the things are not both 
stationary and in motion in respect of the same parts of them; 
and we should reply, that they contain an axis and a circum- 
ference, and that in respect of the axis they are stationary, inas- 
much as they do not lean to any side; but in respect of the cir- 
cumference they are moving round and round: but if, while the  
-P-A-G-E-52
  30 PLATO 
rotatory motion continues, the axis at the same time inclines to 
the right or to the left, forwards or backwards, then they can- 
not be said in any sense to be at rest. 
That is true. 
Then no objection of that kind will alarm us, or tend at all to 
convince us that it is ever possible for one and the same thing, 
at the same time, in the same part of it, and relatively to the 
same object, to be acted upon in two opposite ways, or to be 
two opposite things, or to produce two opposite effects. 
I can answer for myself. 
However, that we may not be compelled to spend time in dis- 
cussing all such objections, and convincing ourselves that they 
are unsound, let us assume this to be the fact, and proceed 
forwards, with the understanding that, if ever we take a differ- 
ent view of this matter, all the conclusions founded on this as- 
sumption will fall to the ground. 
Yes, that will be the best way. 
Well then, I continued, would you place assent and dissent, 
the seeking after an object and the refusal of it, attraction 
‘and repulsion, and the like, in the class of mutual opposites? 
Whether they be active or passive processes will not affect the 
question. 
Yes, I should. 
Well, would you not, without exception, include hunger and 
thirst, and the desires generally, and likewise willing and wish- 
ing, somewhere under the former of those general terms just 
mentioned? For instance, would you not say that the mind of a 
man under the influence of desire always either seeks after the 
object of desire, or attracts to itself that which it wishes to have; 
or again, so far as it wills the possession of anything, it assents 
inwardly thereto, as though it were asked a question, longing for 
the accomplishment of its wish? 
I should. 
Again: shall we not class disinclination, unwillingness, and 
dislike, under the head of mental rejection and repulsion, and of 
general terms wholly opposed to the former? 
Unquestionably.
-P-A-G-E-53
  
  THE REPUBLIC 31 
This being the case, shall we say that desires form a class, 
the most marked of which are what we call thirst and hunger? 
We shall. 
The one being a desire of drink, and the other of food? 
Yes. 
Can thirst then, so far as it is thirst, be an internal desire 
of anything more than drink? That is to say, is thirst, as such, 
a thirst for hot drink or cold, for much or little, or, in one word, 
for any particular kind of drink? Or, will it not rather be true 
that, if there be heat combined with the thirst, the desire of 
cold drink will be superadded to it, and if there be cold, of hot 
drink; and if owing to the presence of muchness, the thirst be 
great, the desire of much will be added, and if little, the desire 
of little: but that thirst in itself cannot be a desire of anything 
else than its natural object, which is simple drink, or again, 
hunger, of anything but food? 
You are right, he replied; every desire in itself has to do with 
its natural object in its simply abstract form, but the accesso- 
ries of the desire determine the quality of the object. 
Let not any one, I proceeded, for want of consideration on 
our part, disturb us by the objection, that no one desires drink 
simply, but good drink, nor food simply, but good food; be- 
cause, since all desire good things, if thirst is a desire, it must 
be a desire of something good, whether that something, which 
is its object, be drink or anything else; — an argument which 
applies to all the desires. 
True, there might seem to be something in the objection. 
Recollect, however, that in the case of all essentially correla- 
tive terms, when the first member of the relation is qualified, 
the second is also qualified, if I am not mistaken; — when the 
first is abstract, the second is also abstract. 
I do not understand you. 
Do you not understand that ‘greater’ is a relative term, im- 
plying another term? 
Certainly. 
It implies a ‘less,’ does it not? 
Yes.
-P-A-G-E-54
  32 PLATO 
And a much greater implies a much less, does it not? 
Yes, 
Does a once greater also imply a once less, and a future 
greater a future less? 
Inevitably. 
Does not the same reasoning apply to the correlative terms, 
‘more’ and ‘fewer,’ ‘double’ and ‘half,’ and all relations of 
quantity; also to the terms, ‘heavier’ and ‘lighter,’ ‘quicker’ 
and ‘slower;’ and likewise to ‘cold’ and ‘hot,’ and all similar 
epithets? 
Certainly it does. 
But how is it with the various branches of scientific know- 
ledge? Does not the same principle hold? That is, knowledge 
in the abstract is knowledge simply of the knowable, or of what- 
ever that be called which is the object of knowledge; but a par- 
ticular science, of a particular kind, has a particular object of a 
particular kind. To explain my meaning: —as soon as a science 
of the construction of houses arose, was it not distinguished 
from other sciences, and therefore called the science of building? 
Undoubtedly. 
And is it not because it is of a particular character, which no 
other science possesses? 
Yes. 
And is not its particular character derived from the particu- 
lar character of its object? and may we not say the same of all 
the other arts and sciences? 
We may. 
This then you are to regard as having been my meaning 
before; provided, that is, you now understand that in the case 
of all correlative terms, if the first member of the relation is 
abstract, the second is also abstract; if the second is qualified, 
the first is also qualified. I do not mean to say that the qualities 
of the two are identical, as for instance, that the science of 
health is healthy, and the science of disease diseased; or that 
the science of evil things is evil, and of good things good: but as 
soon as science, instead of limiting itself to the abstract object 
of science, became related toa particular kind of object, namely,
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE REPUBLIC 33 
in the present case, the conditions of health and disease, the re- 
sult was that the science also came to be qualified in a certain 
manner, so that it was no longer called simply science, but, by 
the addition of a qualifying epithet, medical science. 
I understand, and I think what you say is true. 
To recur to the case of thirst, I continued, do you not con- 
sider this to be one of the things whose nature it is to have an 
object correlative with themselves, assuming that there is such 
a thing as thirst? 
I do, and its object is drink. 
Then, for any particular kind of drink there is a particular 
kind of thirst; but thirst in the abstract is neither for much 
drink, nor for little, neither for good drink nor for bad, nor, in 
one word, for any kind of drink, but simply and absolutely 
thirst for drink, is it not? 
Most decidedly so. 
Then the soul of a thirsty man, in so far as he is thirsty, has 
no other wish than to drink; but this it desires, and towards this 
it is impelled. 
Clearly so. 
Therefore, whenever anything pulls back a soul that is under 
the influence of thirst, it will be something in the soul distinct 
from the principle which thirsts, and which drives it like a beast 
to drink: for we hold it to be impossible that the same thing 
should, at the same time, with the same part of itself, in refer- 
ence to the same object, be doing two opposite things. 
Certainly it is. 
Just as, I imagine, it would not be right to say of the bowman, 
that his hands are at the same time drawing the bow towards 
him, and pushing it from him; the fact being, that one of his 
hands pushes it from him, and the other pulls it to him. 
Precisely so. 
Now, can we say that people sometimes are thirsty, and yet 
do not wish to drink? 
Yes, certainly; it often happens to many people. 
What then can one say of them, except that their soul con- 
tains one principle which commands, and another which for-
-P-A-G-E-56
  34 PLATO 
bids them to drink, the latter being distinct from and stronger 
than the former? 
That is my opinion. 
Whenever the authority which forbids such indulgences 
grows up in the soul, is it not engendered there by reasoning; 
while the powers which lead and draw the mind towards them, 
owe their presence to passive and morbid states? 
It would appear so. 
Then we shall have reasonable grounds for assuming that 
these are two principles distinct one from the other, and for 
giving to that part of the soul with which it reasons the title of 
the rational principle, and to that part with which it loves and 
hungers and thirsts, and experiences the flutter of the other de- 
sires, the title of the irrational and concupiscent principle, the 
ally of sundry indulgences and pleasures. 
Yes, he replied: it will not be unreasonable to think so. 
Let us consider it settled, then, that these two specific parts 
exist in the soul. But now, will spirit, or that by which we feel 
indignant, constitute a third distinct part? If not, with which 
of the two former has it a natural affinity? 
Perhaps with the concupiscent principle. 
But I was once told a story, which I can quite believe, to the 
effect, that Leontius, the son of Aglaion, as he was walking up 
from the Pireeus, and approaching the northern wall from the 
outside, observed some dead bodies on the ground, and the 
executioner standing by them. He immediately felt a desire to 
look at them, but at the same time loathing the thought he 
tried to divert himself from it. For some time he struggled 
with himself, and covered his eyes, till at length, over-mastered 
by the desire, he opened his eyes wide with his fingers, and run- 
ning up to the bodies, exclaimed, ‘There! you wretches! gaze 
your fill at the beautiful spectacle!’ 
I have heard the anecdote too. 
This story, however, indicates that anger sometimes fights 
against the desires, which implies that they are two distinct 
principles. 
True, it does indicate that.
-P-A-G-E-57
  
  THE REPUBLIC 35 
And do we not often observe in other cases that when a man 
is overpowered by his desires against the dictates of his reason, 
he reviles himself, and resents the violence thus exerted within 
him, and that, in this struggle of contending parties, the spirit 
sides with the reason? But that it should make common cause 
with the desires, when the reason pronounces that they ought 
not to act against itself, is a thing which I suppose you will not 
profess to have experienced yourself, nor yet, I imagine, have 
you ever noticed it in any one else. 
No, I am sure I have not. 
Well, and when any one thinks he is in the wrong, is he not, 
in proportion to the nobleness of his character, so much the less 
able to be angry at being made to suffer hunger or cold or any 
similar pain at the hands of him whom he thinks justified in so 
treating him; his spirit, as I describe it, refusing to be roused 
against his punisher? 
True. 
On the other hand, when any one thinks he is wronged, does 
he not instantly boil and chafe, and enlist himself on the side of 
what he thinks to be justice; and whatever extremities of hun- 
ger and cold and the like he may have to suffer, does he not 
endure till he conquers, never ceasing from his noble efforts, 
till he has either gained his point, or perished in the attempt, 
or been recalled and calmed by the voice of reason within, as a 
dog is called off by a shepherd? 
Yes, he replied, the case answers very closely to your de- 
scription; and in fact, in our city we made the auxiliaries, like 
sheep-dogs, subject to the rulers, who are as it were the shep- 
herds of the state. 
You rightly understand my meaning. But try whether you 
also apprehend my next observation. 
What is it? 
That our recent view of the spirited principle is exactly 
reversed. Then we thought it had something of the concupis- 
cent character, but now we say that, far from this being the 
case, it much more readily takes arms on the side of the rational 
principle in the party conflict of the soul.  
-P-A-G-E-58
  
  36 PLATO 
Decidedly it does. 
Is it then distinct from this principle also; or is it only a mod- 
ification of it, thus making two instead of three distinct princi- 
ples in the soul, namely, the rational and the concupiscent? 
Or ought we to say that, as the state was held together by three 
great classes, the producing class, the auxiliary, and the delib- 
erative, so also in the soul the spirited principle constitutes a 
third element, the natural ally of the rational principle, if it be 
not corrupted by evil training? 
It must be a third, he replied. 
Yes, I continued; if it shall appear to be distinct from the ra- 
tional principle, as we found it different from the concupiscent. 
Nay, that will easily appear. For even in little children any 
one may see this, that from their very birth they have plenty 
of spirit, whereas reason is a principle to which most men only 
attain after many years, and some, in my opinion, never. 
Upon my word you have well said. In brute beasts also one 
may see what you describe exemplified. And besides, that pas- 
sage in Homer, which we quoted on a former occasion, will sup- 
port our view: 
‘Smiting his breast, to his heart thus spake he in accents of chiding.’ 
For in this line Homer has distinctly made a difference between 
the two principles, representing that which had considered the 
good or the evil of the action as rebuking that which was in- 
dulging in unreflecting resentment. 
You are perfectly right. 
Here then, I proceeded, after a hard struggle, we have, thougly 
with difficulty, reached the land; and we are pretty well satis- 
fied that there are corresponding divisions, equal in number, 
in a state, and in the soul of every individual.

Just in the same way understand the condition of the soul 
to be as follows. Whenever it has fastened upon an object, over 
which truth and real existence are shining, it seizes that object
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE REPUBLIC 37 
by an act of reason, and knows it, and thus proves itself to be 
possessed of reason: but whenever it has fixed upon objects 
that are blent with darkness, — the world of birth and death, — 
then it rests in opinion, and its sight grows dim, as its opinions 
shift backwards and forwards, and it has the appearance of 
being destitute of reason. . 
True it has. 
Now, this power, which supplies the objects of real know- 
ledge with the truth that is in them, and which renders to him 
who knows the faculty of knowing them, you must consider to 
be the essential form of good, and you must regard it as the 
origin of science, and of truth, so far as the latter comes within 
the range of knowledge; and though knowledge and truth are 
both very beautiful things, you will be right in looking upon 
good as something distinct from them, and even more beautiful. 
And just so, in the analogous case, it is right to regard light and 
vision so resembling the sun, but wrong to identify them with 
the sun; so, in the case of science and truth, it is right to regard 
both of them as resembling good, but wrong to identify either 
of them with good; because, on the contrary, the quality of 
good ought to have a still higher value set upon it. 
That implies an irrepressible beauty, if it not only is the 
source of science and truth, but also surpasses them in beauty; 
for, I presume, you do not mean by it pleasure. 
Hush! I exclaimed, not a word of that. But you had better 
examine the illustration further, as follows. 
Shew me how. 
I think you will admit that the sun ministers to visible 
objects, not only the faculty of being seen, but also their vital- 
ity, growth, and nutriment, though it is not itself equivalent 
to vitality. 
Of course it is not. 
Then admit that, in like manner, the objects of knowledge 
not only derive from the good the gift of being known, but are 
further endowed by it with a real and essential existence; though 
the good, far from being identical with real existence, actually 
transcends it in dignity and power.

Hereupon Glaucon exclaimed with a very amusing air, Good 
heavens! what a miraculous superiority! 
Well, I said, you are a person to blame, because you compel 
me to state my opinions on the subject. 
Nay, let me entreat you not to stop, till you have at all events 
gone over again your similitude of the sun, if you are leaving 
anything out. 
Well, to say the truth, I am leaving out a great deal. 
Then pray do not omit even a trifle. 
I fancy I shall leave much unsaid; however, if I can help it 
under the circumstances, I will not intentionally make any 
omission. 
Pray do not. 
Now understand that, according to us, there are two powers 
reigning, one over an intellectual, and the other over a visible 
region and class of objects; — if I were to use the term ‘firma- 
ment,’ you might think I was playing on the word. Well then, 
are you in possession of these as two kinds, — one visible, the 
other intellectual? 
Yes, I am. 
Suppose you take a line divided into two unequal parts, — 
one to represent the visible class of objects, the other the intel- 
lectual, — and divide each part again into two segments on the 
same scale. Then, if you make the lengths of the segments re- 
present degrees of distinctness or indistinctness, one of the two 
segments of the part which stands for the visible world will 
represent all images: — meaning by images, first of all, shad- 
ows; and, in the next place, reflections in water, and in close- 
grained, smooth, bright substances, and everything of the 
kind, if you understand me. 
Yes, I do understand. 
Let the other segment stand for the real objects correspond- 
ing to these images, — namely, the animals about us, and the 
whole world of nature and of art. 
Very good. 
Would you also consent to say that, with reference to this 
class, there is, in point of truth and untruthfulness, the same
-P-A-G-E-61
  
THE REPUBLIC 39 
distinction between the copy and the original, that there is be- 
tween what is matter of opinion and what is matter of know- 
ledge? 
Certainly I should. 
Then let us proceed to consider how we must divide that part 
of the whole line which represents the intellectual world. 
How must we do it? 
Thus: one segment of it will represent what the soul is com- 
pelled to investigate by the aid of the segments of the other 
part, which it employs as images, starting from hypotheses, 
and travelling not to a first principle, but to a conclusion. The 
other segment will represent the objects of the soul, as it makes 
its way from an hypothesis to a first principle which is not hy- 
pothetical, unaided by those images which the former division 
employs, and shaping its journey by the sole help of real essen- 
tial forms. 
I have not understood your description so well as I could 
wish. 
Then we will try again. You will understand me more easily 
when I have made some previous observations. I think you 
know that the students of subjects like geometry and calcula- 
tion, assume by way of materials, in each investigation, all 
odd and even numbers, figures, three kinds of angles, and 
other similar data. These things they are supposed to know, 
and having adopted them as hypotheses, they decline to 
give any account of them, either to themselves or to others, 
on the assumption that they are self-evident; and, making 
these their starting point, they proceed to travel through the 
remainder of the subject, and arrive at last, with perfect 
unanimity, at that which they have proposed as the object of 
investigation. 
I am perfectly aware of the fact, he replied. 
Then you also know that they summon to their aid visible 
forms, and discourse about them, though their thoughts are 
busy not with these forms, but with their originals, and though 
they discourse not with a view to the particular square and 
diameter which they draw, but with a view to the absolute  
-P-A-G-E-62
  40 PLATO 
square and the absolute diameter, and so on. For while they 
employ by way of images those figures and diagrams afore- 
said, which again have their shadows and images in water, they 
are really endeavoring to behold those abstractions which a per- 
son can only see with the eye of thought. 
True. 
This, then, was the class of things which I called intellectual; 
but I said that the soul is constrained to employ hypotheses 
while engaged in the investigation of them, — not travelling 
to a first principle, (because it is unable to step out of, and 
mount above, its hypotheses,) but using, as images, just the 
copies that are presented by things below, — which copies, as 
compared with the originals, are vulgarly esteemed distinct and 
valued accordingly. 
I understand you to be speaking of the subject-matter of the 
various branches of geometry and the kindred arts. 
Again, by the second segment of the intellectual world 
understand me to mean all that the mere reasoning process 
apprehends by the force of dialectic, when it avails itself of 
hypotheses not as first principles, but as genuine hypotheses, 
that is to say, as stepping-stones and impulses, whereby it may 
force its way up to something that is not hypothetical, and ar- 
rive at the first principle of everything, and seize it in its grasp; 
which done, it turns round, and takes hold of that which takes 
hold of this first principle, till at last it comes down to a conclu- 
sion, calling in the aid of no sensible object whatever, but sim- 
ply employing abstract, self-subsisting forms, and terminating 
in the same. 
I do not understand you so well as I could wish, for I believe 
you to be describing an arduous task; but at any rate I under- 
stand that you wish to declare distinctly, that the field of real 
existence and pure intellect, as contemplated by the science of 
dialectic, is more certain than the field investigated by what 
are called the arts, in which hypotheses constitute first princi- 
ples, which the students are compelled, it is true, to contem- 
plate with the mind and not with the senses; but, at the same 
time, as they do not come back, in the course of inquiry, to a

first principle, but push on from hypothetical premises, you 
think that they do not exercise pure reason on the questions 
that engage them, although taken in connexion with a first 
principle these questions come within the domain of the pure 
reason. And I believe you apply the term understanding, not 
pure reason, to the mental habit of such people as geometri- 
cians, — regarding understanding as something intermediate 
between opinion and pure reason. 
You have taken in my meaning most satisfactorily; and I beg 
you will accept these four mental states, as corresponding to 
the four segments, — namely pure reason corresponding to the 
highest, understanding to the second, belief to the third, and 
conjecture to the last; and pray arrange them in gradation, 
and believe them to partake of distinctness in a degree corre- 
sponding to the truth of their respective objects. 
I understand you, said he. I quite agree with you, and will 
arrange them as you desire. 
BOOK X. THE SOUL’S IMMORTALITY 
Steph. 609. 
Acatn: do you maintain.that everything has its evil, and its 
good? Do you say, for example, that the eyes are liable to the 
evil of ophthalmia, the entire body to disease, corn to mildew, 
timber to rot, copper and iron to rust, or, in other words, that 
almost everything is liable to some connatural evil and malady? 
Ido. 
And is it not the case that, whenever an object is attacked’ 
by one of these maladies, it is impaired, and, in the end, com- 
pletely broken up and destroyed by it? 
Doubtless it is so. 
Hence everything is destroyed by its own connatural evil: 
and vice; otherwise, if it be not destroyed by this, there is no- 
thing else that can corrupt it. For that which is good will never 
destroy anything, nor yet that which is neither good nor evil. 
Of course not. 
If then we can find among existing things one which is liable
-P-A-G-E-64
  42 PLATO 
to a particular evil, which can indeed mar it, but cannot break 
it up or destroy it, shall we not be at once certain that a thing 
so constituted can never perish? 
That would be a reasonable conclusion. 
Well, then, is not the soul liable to a malady which renders it 
evil ? 
Certainly it is; all those things which we were lately discuss- 
ing, — injustice, intemperance, cowardice, and ignorance, — 
produce that result. 
That being the case, does any one of these things bring about 
the dissolution and destruction of the soul? Turn it over well 
in your mind, that we may not be misled by supposing that, 
when the crimes of the unjust and foolish man are found out, 
he is destroyed by his injustice, which is a depraved state of the 
soul. No, consider the case thus. The depravity of the body, 
that is to say, disease, wastes and destroys the body, and re- 
duces it to a state in which it ceases to be a body; and all the 
things, which we named just now, are brought by their own 
proper vice, which corrupts them by its adhesion or indwelling, 
to a state in which they cease to exist. I am right, am I not ? 
Yes. 
Then proceed to examine the soul on the same method. Is 
it true that, when injustice and other vices reside in the soul, 
they corrupt and wither it by contact or indwelling, until they 
have brought it to death, and severed it from the body? 
Certainly, they do not produce that effect. 
Well but, on the other hand, it is irrational to suppose that 
a thing can be destroyed by the depravity of another thing, 
though it cannot be destroyed by its own. 
True, it is irrational. 
Yes it is, Glaucon; for you must remember that we do not 
imagine that a body is to be destroyed by the proper depravity 
of its food, whatever that may be, whether mouldiness or rot- 
tenness or anything else. But if the depravity of the food itself 
produces in the body a disorder proper to the body, we shall 
assert that the body has been destroyed by its food remotely, 
but by its own proper vice, or disease, immediately: and we
-P-A-G-E-65
    THE REPUBLIC 43 
shall always disclaim the notion that the body can be corrupted 
by the depravity of its food, which is a different thing from the 
body, — that is to say, the notion that the body can be cor- 
rupted by an alien evil, without the introduction of its own 
native evil. 
You are perfectly correct. 
Then according to the same reasoning, I continued, unless | 
depravity of body introduces into the soul depravity of soul, 
let us never suppose that the soul can be destroyed by an alien 
evil without the presence of its own peculiar disease; for that 
would be to suppose that one thing can be destroyed by the 
evil of another thing. 
That is a reasonable statement. 
' Well then, let us either refute this doctrine and point out 
our mistake, or else, so long as it remains unrefuted, let us 
never assert that a fever, or any other disease, or fatal vio- 
lence, or even the act of cutting up the entire body into the 
smallest possible pieces, can have any tendency to destroy the 
soul, until it has been demonstrated, that, in consequence of 
this treatment of the body, the soul itself becomes more unjust 
and more unholy. For, so long as a thing is exempt from its own 
proper evil, while an evil foreign to it appears in another sub- 
ject, let us not allow it to be said that this thing, whether it be 
a soul or anything else, is in danger of being destroyed. 
Well, certainly no one will ever prove that the souls of the 
dying become more unjust in consequence of death. 
But in case any one should venture to encounter the argu- 
ment, and to assert that the dying man becomes more depraved 
and unjust, in order to save himself from being compelled to 
admit that the soul is immortal, I suppose we shall infer that, 
if the objector is right, injustice is as fatal as a disease to its 
possessor; and we shall expect those who catch this essentially 
deadly disorder to die by its agency, quickly or slowly, accord- 
ing to the violence of the attack; instead of finding, as we do at 
present, that the unjust are put to death in consequence of their 
injustice, by the agency of other people who punish them for 
‘their crimes.
-P-A-G-E-66
  44 PLATO 
Then really, said he, injustice cannot be thought such avery 
dreadful thing, if it is to be fatal to its owner; because in that 
case it will be a release from evils. But I am inclined to think 
that, on the contrary, we shall find that it kills other people 
if it can, while it endows its possessor with peculiar vitality, 
and with sleeplessness as well as vitality. So widely and per- 
manently is it removed, to all appearance, from any tendency 
to destroy its owner. 
You say well, I replied. For surely when the soul cannot be 
killed and destroyed by its own depravity and its own evil, 
hardly will the evil, which is charged with the destruction of 
another thing, destroy a soul or anything else, beyond its own 
appropriate object. 
Yes, hardly; at least that is the natural inference. 
Hence, as it is destroyed by no evil at all, whether foreign 
to it or its own, itis clear that the soul must be always existing, 
and therefore immortal. 
It must. 
Well then, I continued, let us consider this proved. And, if 
so, you understand that the souls that exist must be always the 
same. For, if none be destroyed, they cannot become fewer. 
Nor yet can they become more numerous; because if any class 
of things immortal became more numerous, you know that 
something mortal must have contributed to swell its numbers; 
in which case, everything would finally be immortal. 
True. 
But reason will forbid our entertaining this opinion, which 
we must therefore disavow. On the other hand, do not let us 
imagine that the soul in its essential nature, and viewed by 
itself, can possibly be fraught with abundance of variety, un- 
likeness, and disagreement. 
What do you mean? 
A thing cannot easily be eternal, as we have just proved the 
soul to be, if it is compounded of many parts, and if the mode 
* of composition employed is not the very best. 
Probably it cannot.

BOOK II. THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL 
CHAPTER I. DEFINITION OF THE SOUL 
412a 
Let the foregoing} suffice as a discussion of the traditional 
theories of the soul; and now let us resume our subject from the 
start, and attempt to determine the nature of the soul and its 
most general definition. One class of realities we call ‘sub- 
stance.’ This ‘substance’ may be regarded on the one hand as 
matter, which in itself is no definite thing; on the other hand, 
aS‘form and idea, in terms of which definite individuality is 
ascribed to a thing. A third meaning of substance is the com- 
posite of matter and form. Matter is potentiality; form is 
actuality or realization. The latter may be looked at in two 
ways, either as complete realization, — comparable with per- 
fected knowledge, or as realization in process, — comparable 
with the activity of contemplation. The notion of substance 
appears to be most generally employed in the sense of body, 
and particularly of physical body; for this is the source of all 
other bodies. Some physical bodies have, and others have not, 
life. By life we understand an inherent principle of nutrition, 
growth, and decay. So that every natural body endowed with 
life would be substance, and substance in this composite sense.

46 ARISTOTLE 
The body, therefore, would not be soul, since body is of such 
nature that life is an attribute of it. For body is not predicated 
of something else, but is rather itself substrate and matter. 
The soul must, then, be substance in this sense: it is the form of 
a natural body endowed with the capacity of life. In this mean- 
ing substance is the completed realization. Soul, therefore, will 
be the completed realization of a body such as described. Com- 
plete realization is employed in two senses. In the one sense it 
is comparable with perfected knowledge; in another, it is com- 
parable with the active process of contemplation. It is evident 
that we mean by it here that realization which corresponds to 
perfected knowledge. Now, both waking and sleeping are in- 
cluded in the soul’s existence: waking corresponds to active 
contemplation; sleep to attained and inactive knowledge. Ina 
given case science is earlier in origin than observation. Soul, 
then, is the first entelechy of a natural body endowed with the 
capacity of life. Such a body one would describe as organic. 
The parts of plants are also organs, although quite simple in 
character, e.g. the leaf is the covering of the pericarp, and the 
pericarp is covering of the fruit; the roots are analogous to 
mouths, both being channels of nutrition. If then we were 
obliged to give a general description applicable to all soulor 
life, we should say that it is the first entelechy of a natural or- 
ganic body. It is therefore unnecessary to ask whether body 
and soul are one, as one should not ask whether the wax and the 
figure are one, or, in general, whether the matter of a particular 
thing and the thing composed of it are one. For although unity 
and being are predicated in several senses, their proper sense is 
that of perfect realization. 
We have now given a general definition of the soul. We have 
defined it as an entity which realizes an idea. It is the essential 
notion which we ascribe to a body of agivenkind. Asanillus- { 
tration, suppose that an instrument, e.g. an axe, were a natural 
body. Here the notion of axe constitutes its essential nature or 
reality, and this would be its soul. Were this taken away it 
would no longer be an axe, except in the sense of a homonym. 
It is in reality, however, merely an axe, and of a body of this
-P-A-G-E-69
  PSYCHOLOGY 47 
sort soul is not the notional essence and the idea, but soul ap- 
plies only to a natural body of a given kind, viz. a body whose 
principle of movement and rest is in itself. The principle ex- 
pressed here should be observed in its application to particular 
parts of the body. For if the eye were an animal, vision would 
be its soul, i.e. vision is the notional essence of the eye. The eye, 
however, is the matter of vision, and if the vision be wanting 
the eye is no longer an eye, save in the meaning of a homonym, 
asa stone eye or a painted eye. What applies here to a particu- 
lar member, must also apply to the entire living body; for as the 
particular sensation is related to the particular organ of sense, 
so is the whole of sensation related to the entire sensitive organ- 
ism, in so far as it has sensation. ‘Potentiality of life’ does not 
refer to a thing which has become dispossessed of soul, but to 
that which possesses it. Seed and fruit are potentially living 
bodies. As cutting is the realization of the axe, and vision is the 
realization of the eye, so is the waking state the realization of 
the living body; and as vision and capacity are related to the 
organ, so is the soul related to the body. Body is the potential 
substrate. But as vision and pupil on the one hand constitute 
the eye, so soul and body in the other case constitute the living 
animal. It is, therefore, clear that the soul is not separable from 
the body; and the same holds good of particular parts of the 
soul, if its nature admits of division, for in some cases the soul is 
the realization of these very parts; not but that there are cer- 
tain other parts where nothing forbids their possible separation, 
because they are not realizations of any bodily nature. And 
yet it is uncertain whether the soul as realization of the body is 
separable from it in a sense analogous to the separability of 
sailor and boat. Let this suffice as a definition and outline 
sketch of the soul. 
CHAPTER II. THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE 
InasMucz# as the certain and the conceptually more knowable 
is derived from what is uncertain, but sensibly more apparent, 
we must resume the investigation of the soul from this stand- 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
48 ARISTOTLE 
point. For it is necessary that the definition show not merely 
what a thing is, as most definitions do, but it must also contain 
and exhibit the cause of its being what it is. In reality, the 
terms of definitions are ordinarily stated in the form of conclu- 
sions. What,e.g.,is the definition of squaring? The reply is that 
squaring is the conversion of a figure of unequal sides into a 
right-angled equilateral figure equal to the former. Such a 
definition is the expression of a conclusion. But to define squar- 
ing as the discovery of a mean proportional line is to define the 
thing in terms of its cause. Resuming our inquiry, we say, 
therefore, that the animate is distinguished from the inanimate 
by the principle of life. But inasmuch as life is predicated in 
several senses, e.g: in the sense of reason, sensation, local move- 
ment and rest, and furthermore movement in the sense of 
nutrition, decay, and growth; if any one of these is discerned 
in a thing we say that it has life. All plants, therefore, are sup- 
posed to have life; for evidently they have within them a po- 
tency and principle whereby they experience growth and decay 
in opposite processes. For their growth is not merely upwards 
or downwards, but in both these directions alike and in every 
point where nutrition takes place, and they continue to live as 
long as they are capable of nutrition. Now this faculty of nutri- 
tion is separable from the other forms of life, but the other forms 
cannot exist in perishable creatures apart from this principle 
of nutrition. This is made clear in the instance of plants; for 
they have no other capacity of soul (or life) than this nutritive 
one. Owing to this fundamental principle of nourishment, 
therefore, life is found in all animated living things, but the 
primary mark which distinguishes an animal from other forms 
of life is the possession of sensation. For even those creatures 
which are incapable of locomotion or change of place, but which 
possess sensation, are called animals and are not merely said to 
live. Touch is the primary form of sensation and is found in alt 
animals. But as the nutritive faculty is separable from touch 
and sensation in general, so touch can exist apart from the other 
forms of sensation. By the nutritive power we understand 
that part of the soul in which plants share; and by the sensa-
-P-A-G-E-71
  PSYCHOLOGY 49 
tion of touch we mean that capacity which all animals possess. 
We shall later on give the explanation of these phenomena. 
For the present let it suffice that the soul is the causal princi- 
ple of the aforesaid phenomena, and is defined in terms of them, 
I mean, in terms of nutrition, sensation, reason, motion. To the 
question whether each of these forms of life is a soul or a part of 
the soul; and, if a part, whether in the sense that the part is 
only notionally separable or really separable in space, — the 
reply is in some respects easy and in others difficult. For in the 
case of plants, some of them appear to live when they are di- 
vided up and the parts are separated from each other, indicat- 
ing that there is in each of these plants in actuality an unitary 
soul, but in potentiality several souls. And we observe the 
same thing taking place in different varieties of soul, as e.g. in 
the case of insects which have been dismembered. Here each 
part is capable of sensation and locomotion, but if it is capable 
of sensation it is also capable of imagination and impulse. For 
where there is sensation, there is also pleasure and pain, and 
where there is pleasure and pain there is necessarily also desire. 
Now in regard to reason and the speculative faculty, we have 
as yet no certain evidence, but it seems to be a generically dis- 
tinct type of soul and it alone is capable of existing in a state of 
separation from the body, as the eternal is separable from the 
mortal. The remaining parts of the soul, however, are from the 
foregoing considerations evidently not separable, as some as- 
sert. But that they are notionally separable, is clear; for if per- 
ceiving is distinct from opining, the faculty of sensation or per- 
ception is distinct from that whereby-we opine, and each of 
these is in turn distinct from the faculties above mentioned. 
Furthermore, all of these are found in some animals, while only 
certain of them are found in others, and in still others only a 
single one (and this is the cause of distinctions amongst ani- 
mals). The reason for this must be investigated hereafter. A 
parallel instance is found in regard to sensation; some animals 
possess all the faculties of sense, others only certain of them, 
and still others only the single most fundamental one, viz. 
touch. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  50 ARISTOTLE 
The principle by which we live and have sensation, then, is 
employed in a twofold sense. Similarly, we employ the prin- 
ciple by which we know in a twofold sense, viz. science and the 
knowing mind (for we say we know by means of each of these), 
and in a like manner the principle by virtue of which we are 
healthy is in one sense health itself, and in another sense a part 
of the body or the whole of it. In these cases knowledge and 
health constitute the form, notion, idea, and, as it were, the 
realization of a potential subject, — the one of a knowing sub- 
ject and the other of a healthy one, (realization is supposed to 
attach to that which has power to effect changes and is found in 
a passive and recipient subject). The soul is that principle by 
which in an ultimate sense we live and feel and think; so that 
it is a sort of idea and form, not matter and substrate. Now, 
substance is employed, as we have said, ina threefold meaning, 
viz. as form, as matter, and as a composite of these two. 
Amongst these meanings of substance matter signifies potenti- 
ality; form signifies actuality or complete realization. Inasmuch 
as it is the composite which is the animate creature, body can- 
not be regarded as the complete realization of the soul, but the 
soul is the realization of a given body. The conjecture, there- 
fore, appears well founded that the soul does not exist apart 
from a body nor is it a particular body. The soul is not itself 
body, but it is a certain aspect of body, and is consequently 
found in a body, and furthermore in a body of such and such a 
kind. It is not to be regarded as it was amongst our predeces- 
sors who thought that it is introduced into body without prior 
determination of the particular sort of body, although no casual 
subject appears capable of undergoing any casual or haphazard 
effect.1 This same result is also reached by an analysis of the 
notion itself; for complete realization in every instance is natu- 
rally found in a definite potentiality and in an appropriate 
matter. From this it is evident that the soul is a kind of realiza- 
tion and expressed idea of a determinate potentiality.

doctrine of transmigration of souls. Cf. De anima, 407 b 22.

  PSYCHOLOGY 51 
CHAPTER III. THE VARIOUS MEANINGS OF 
THE SOUL 
In some creatures, as we have said, all of the above men- 
tioned psychic powers are found, in others certain of them, and 
in still others only one. By powers we mean here the power of 
nutrition, of appetite, of sensation, of movement in space, and 
of rational thought. In plants, only the nutritive power is 
found; in other creatures the power of sensation is added., If 
sensation is added, impulse or appetite is also implied. For 
appetite includes desire and impulse and wish. All animals 
have at least one sense — touch; and to whatever creature 
sensation is given, to it are also given pleasure and pain, and 
objects appear to be pleasant or painful. Creatures which dis- 
tinguish these, possess also desire; for desire is an impulse 
towards what is pleasant. Further, animals possess a sense for 
food, and this is the sense of touch; for all animals are nourished 
by means of the dry and moist, the warm and cold, and it is 
touch which apprehends these. It is only incidentally that 
animals discern food through other sensible qualities; neither 
sound nor colour nor smell contributes at all to food. Flavour, 
however, is one of the haptic qualities. Hunger and thirst are 
desires; hunger is a desire of the dry and warm; thirst a desire 
of the cool and moist, and flavour is a sort of seasoning in these 
objects. We must explain these subjects minutely hereafter; 
for the present let the statement suffice, that amongst animals 
where we find touch we find appetite also. The subject of 
imagination in animals is uncertain and must be investigated 
later. In addition to these attributes we find amongst some 
animals the power of local movement and in others we find the 
power of understanding and reason, as in man and in other 
creatures that are, if there be such, similar or superior to man. 
It is evident that a single definition can be applied to soul in 
the same way as a single definition can be applied to figure. As 
in the latter case, there is no figure beyond that of the triangle 
and its derivations, so in the former case there is no soul beyond 
those enumerated. A common definition might also be applied 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
52 ARISTOTLE 
to figures which would fit them all and be peculiar to no par- 
ticular figure. The same holds good in the case of the above 
mentioned types of soul. It is, therefore, absurd, both in these 
instances and in others, to search for a common definition which 
shall not apply to any individual real thing nor to any peculiar 
and irreducible species, thereby neglecting the particular mean- 
ing in the general. The facts touching the soul are parallel to 
this case of figure; for both in figures and in animate creatures, 
the prior always exists potentially in the later, e.g. the triangle 
is contained potentially in the square and the nutritive power 
in that of sensation. We must, therefore, investigate the nature 
of the soul in particular things, e.g. in a plant, a man, or a lower 
animal. And we must consider the cause of their order of suc- 
cession. The sensitive soul, for example, presupposes the nutri- 
tive, but in the case of plants the nutritive exists apart from the 
sensitive. Again, the sense of touch is presupposed by all the 
other senses, but touch exists apart from them and does not 
presuppose them. Many animals have no sense of sight, hear- 
ing, or smell. Some that are capable of sensation have also 
power of local movement, others have not; finally the smallest 
number possess the power of reason and understanding. Mortal 
creatures who possess the power of reason, possess all the other 
psychic faculties, but those which have each of these others do 
not all have the power of reason, and certain of them do not 
even possess imagination, while still others live by this alone. 
At another time we shall give an account of the speculative 
reason. It is evident, however, that this account touching each 
particular form of soul is also the most fitting description of the 
soul in general. 
CHAPTER IV. THE SOUL AND FINAL CAUSE 
Ir one intends to make an investigation of the faculties of 
the soul, it is necessary first to inquire into their several natures, 
and then by the same method to inquire further into other 
related problems. If, then, one is obliged to describe the 
nature of each several faculty, e.g. the nature of the faculty of  
-P-A-G-E-75
PSYCHOLOGY 53 
reason, of sense-perception, or of nutrition, one must first be 
able to say what thinking and sense-perception mean. For the 
activities and processes are notionally prior to the faculties to 
which they belong. If this is true, we must further observe the 
objects of the activities before the activities themselves, and 
we should for the same reason first determine our position 
regarding these objects, e.g. regarding food, the sensible, and the 
intelligible. First, then, we must speak of food and generation. 
For the nutritive power is found in all living things, and is the 
primary and most universal faculty of soul, by virtue of which 
all creatures possess life. Its functions are to procreate, and to 
assimilate food. In all animals that are perfect and not abnor- 
mal, or that are not spontaneously generated, it is the most 
natural function to beget another being similar to itself, an 
animal to beget another animal, a plant another plant, in order 
that they attain, as far as possible, the immortal and divine; 
for this is what every creature aims at, and this is the final 
cause of every creature’s natural life. We understand by final 
cause two things: the purpose aimed at, and the person who is 
served by the purpose. Since it is impossible for an individual 
to partake of the immortal and divine in its own continuous 
life, because no perishable creature continues self-identical and 
numerically one, it partakes therefore of the immortal in that 
way in which it is able to share it, one thing in a higher degree 
and another in a lower; it does not itself abide, but only a simi- 
lar self abides; in its continuity it is not numerically, but only 
specifically, one. 
The soul is the cause and principle of a living:body. These 
terms are used in several senses. Corresponding to these differ- 
ences, the soul is referred to as cause in three distinct meanings; 
for it is cause in the sense of the source of movement, of final 
cause, and as the real substance of animate bodies. That it is a 
cause in the sense of real substance is evident, for real substance 
is in every case the cause of being, and the being of animals is 
their life, and soul is the cause and principle of life. Further- 
more, it is the complete realization that gives us the real signifi- 
cance of a potential being. Soul is also evidently cause in the
-P-A-G-E-76
  54 ARISTOTLE 
sense of final cause. For nature, like reason, acts with purpose, 
and this purpose is its end. In animals the soul is, by virtue of 
its nature, a principle similar to this. For the soul uses all natu- 
ral bodies as its instruments, the bodies of animals and the 
bodies of plants alike, which exist for the soul as their end. End 
is used in two senses: the purpose, and the person or thing 
which the purpose serves. Soul also means the primary source 
of local movement. This power of local movement is not pos- 
sessed by all living creatures. Transformation and growth are 
also due to the soul. For sense-perception is supposed to be a 
kind of transformation, and nothing is capable of sense-percep- 
tion unless it has a soul. The case is similar with growth and 
decay. For nothing grows or decays by natural processes unless 
it admit of nutrition, and nothing is capable of nutrition unless 
it has a soul. Empedocles ascribes downward growth to plants 
where they are rooted, because the earth naturally tends down- 
ward, and upward growth, because fire tends in that direction, 
and in these respects is not right. For Empedocles does not 
employ the terms ‘up’ and ‘down’ correctly. ‘Up’ and ‘down’ 
are not the same for all things nor in all parts of the universe, 
for roots are to plants what the head is to animals, if one is to 
describe organs as identical or different in terms of their func- 
tions. In addition, what principle is it that holds together these 
two elements of fire and earth, tending, as they do, in opposite 
directions? For they will scatter asunder, if there be no hinder- 
ing principle. And if there is such a principle, it is the soul and 
the cause of growth and nourishment. Some regard fire as the 
real cause of nutrition and growth. For this seems to be the 
only body or element that feeds and increases itself. One might, 
therefore, conjecture that this is the element that causes growth 
and nutrition in animals and plants. In a certain sense, it is 
true, fire is a co-ordinate cause, but not the absolute cause, of 
growth; this is rather the soul. For the growth of fird is indeter- 
minate so long as there is material to burn; on the other hand, 
in all bodies developed in nature there is a limit and significance 
tosizeand growth. These attributes ((of limit and significance]) 
belong to soul, not to fire, to reason rather than to matter.
-P-A-G-E-77
  PSYCHOLOGY 55 
Since the same power of the soul is both nutritive and gen- 
erative, we must first investigate nutrition; for it is by this 
function of nutrition that the facultyin question is distinguished 
from other faculties. Nutrition is supposed to take place by the 
law of opposites, although not every opposite is nourished by 
every other, but such opposites only as derive both their origin 
and their growth from each other. Many things are derived 
from one another, but they are not all quantitative changes, as 
e.g. healthy from sickly. Nutrition isnot applied to these cases 
in the same sense, for while water is nutriment for fire, fire does 
not nourish water. The opposites of food and nourishment 
appear to apply particularly to simple bodies. There is, how- 
ever, a difficulty here. For there are some who maintain that 
like is nourished by like, as like is also increased by like, while 
others, as we said, affirm the converse of this, viz., that oppo- 
sites are nourished by opposites, on the ground that like is in- 
capable of being affected by like. Food, however, undergoes 
transformation and is digested, and transformation is in every 
case toward the opposite or the intermediate. Further, food is 
affected by the body which assimilates it; the latter, however, 
is not affected by the food, just as the builder is not affected by 
his material, although the material undergoes change through 
him. The builder merely passes from a state of inactivity into 
one of activity. The question whether nourishment is to be 
understood to apply to the final condition in which it is taken 
up by the body, or to its original condition, creates a difficulty. 
If both are meant, only in the one case the food is indigested 
and in the other digested, it would be possible to speak of nour- 
ishment conformably to both of the above theories; for in so far 
as it is indigested, we should have opposite nourished by oppo- 
site; in so far as it is digested, we should have like nourished by 
like; so that in a certain sense, it is evident they are both right 
and both wrong. Since nothing is nourished which does not 
share life, the object of nutrition would be an animate body as 
animate; so that food is determined by its relation to an ani- 
mate object and is not accidental. There is a difference between 
the nourishment and the principle of growth; in so far as the
-P-A-G-E-78
| 
56 ARISTOTLE 
animate thing is quantitative, the notion of growth applies; in 
so far as it is a particular substance, the notion of nourishment. 
For food preserves a being as a substantial thing, and it con- 
tinues to exist so long as it is nourished. Nourishment is pro- 
ductive of generation, not the generation of the nourished thing, 
but of a being similar to it. For the former exists already as a 
reality, and nothing generates, but merely preserves, itself. 
So then, such a principle of the soul as we have described is a 
power capable of preserving that in which this principle is 
found, in so far as it is found; nourishment equips it for action. 
When, therefore, it is deprived of nourishment, it can no longer 
exist. Since there are three distinct things here: the object 
nourished, the means of nourishment, and the power that 
causes nutrition, we shall say that it is the elemental soul that 
causes nutrition, the object nourished is the body which pos- 
sesses this soul, and the means of nourishment is the food. And 
since it is fair to give everything a name in terms of its end, and 
since here the end of the soul is to generate a creature like to 
itself, the elemental soul might be called generative of that 
which is like to itself. The means of nourishment is used in two 
senses, as is also the means of steering a ship; for one may refer 
to the hand, or to the rudder, the one being both actively mov- 
ing and moved; the other only passively moved. All nutriment 
must be capable of being digested; heat is the element which 
accomplishes digestion. Everything animate, therefore, pos- 
sesses heat. We have explained now, in outline, what nutri- 
ment is. The subject must be more minutely treated later on in 
its proper place. 
CHAPTER V. SENSATION AND THOUGHT 
Now that we have arrived at the foregoing conclusions, 
let us discuss in general the entire question of sense-perception. 
It consists, as we have said, in being moved and affected; for it 
is supposed to be a sort of internal transformation. Some main- 
tain that like is affected by like. In what sense this is possible 
and in what sense impossible, I have explained in a general
-P-A-G-E-79
    
PSYCHOLOGY 57 
treatise On Activity and Passivity. A difficulty is raised by the 
question why it is that perceptions do not arise from the senses 
themselves, and why it is that without external stimuli they’ 
produce no sensation, although fire and earth, and the other 
elements of which we have sense-perception, are, either in their 
essential nature or in their attributes, found in the senses. It is, 
therefore, evident that the organ of sense-perception is not a 
thing in actuality but only in potentiality. It is consequently 
analogous to the combustible which does not itself ignite with- 
out something to set it ablaze. Otherwise it would have burned 
itself and had no need of an active fire. Inasmuch as we say 
that perceiving is used in two meanings (e.g. we call the capacity 
to hear and see, hearing and sight, although they may chance 
to be dormant, and we apply the same terms where the senses 
are actively exercised), so sense-perception also would be used 
in two senses, the one potential and the other actual. First of 
all let us understand that the terms affection, motion, and 
activity, are used in the same meaning. For motion is a sort 
of activity, although incomplete, as we have said elsewhere. 
Everything is affected and set in motion by an active agent and 
by something that exists in activity. Therefore in one sense a 
thing is affected by like, in another by unlike, as we have said; 
for it is the unlike that is affected, but after being affected it is 
like. 
We must, further, make a distinction touching potentiality 
and actuality, for we are now using these terms in a general 
sense. There is a sense in which we speak of a thing as knowing, 
as when we call man knowing, because man belongs to the class 
of creatures that know and are endowed with knowledge. There 
is another sense in which we speak of a man as possessing the 
particular knowledge of grammar. In each of these cases a man 
possesses knowledge potentially, but not in the same sense; the 
former is knowing as belonging to a certain genus and as hav- 
ing a native endowment; the latter is knowing in the sense of 
being able to exercise his knowledge at will, when nothing 
external prevents. In a still different sense there is the man who 
is actually exercising his knowledge, and is in a condition of 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  58 ARISTOTLE 
complete realization, having in the strict sense knowledge of a 
particular thing, as e.g. A. The first two know in a potential 
sense; the one of them, however, knows when he is trans- 
formed through a discipline of knowledge, and has passed re- 
peatedly out of an opposite condition; the other knows in the 
sense of possessing arithmetical or grammatical science; and 
their passing from non-actual to actual knowledge is different. 
Again, neither is the term ‘passivity’ used in an absolute mean- 
ing: in one meaning, it is destruction by an opposite principle; 
in another meaning, it is the preservation of the potentially 
existent by means of the actual and similar, just as potentiality 
is related to actuality. That which possesses potential know- 
ledge, for instance, comes to the actual use of it — a transition 
that we must either not call transformation (for the added 
element belongs to its own nature and tends to its own realiza- 
tion), or else we must call it a special kind of transformation. 
It is, therefore, incorrect to speak of thinking as a transforma- 
tion when one thinks, just as the builder is not transformed 
when he is building a house. That which conduces to actuali- 
zation out of a potential state in the matter of reasoning and 
thinking is not fairly called teaching, but must be given another 
name. Again, that which passes out of a potential state by 
learning or by acquiring knowledge at the hands of what 
actually knows and can teach, must either not be said to be 
affected as a passive subject, or we must admit two meanings 
of transformation, the one a change into a negative condition 
and the other into a positive condition and the thing’s natural 
state. 
The first change in the sentient subject is wrought by the 
generating parent, but after birth the creature comes into the 
possession of sense-perception as a species of knowledge. Act- 
ive sensation is used in a way similar to active thinking. There 
is, however, this difference, that the objects which produce 
sensation are external, e.g. the visible and the audible, and 
similarly other sensible qualities. The reason for this is that 
active sense-perception refers to particular things, while scien- 
tific knowledge refers to the universal. These universals, how-
-P-A-G-E-81
    
PSYCHOLOGY 59 
ever, are, in a certain sense, in the mind itself. Therefore it is 
in one’s power to think when one wills, but to experience sense- 
perception is not thus in one’s power; for a sensible object must 
first be present. This also holds good of those sciences which 
deal with sensible realities, and for the same reason, viz. because 
these sensible realities belong to the world of particular and 
external phenomena. 
To go into the details of these questions would be more suit- 
ableat another time. For the present somuch may be regarded 
as fixed, viz. that the term ‘potential’ is not used in any abso- 
lute sense, but in one case its meaning is similar to our saying 
that a boy has in him the potentiality of a general, and in an- 
other case to our saying that a man in his prime has that poten- 
tiality —a distinction which also applies to the capacity for 
sense-perception. Inasmuch as this distinction has no particu- 
lar name in our language, although we have remarked that the 
things are different and how they differ, we must simply employ 
the terms affection and transformation as applicable here. 
That which is capable of sense-perception is, as we have said, 
potentially what the sensible is actually. It is, therefore, 
affected at a moment when it is unlike, but when it has been 
affected it becomes like and is as its object. 
CHAPTER VI. SENSE QUALITIES 
In discussing any form of sense-perception we must begin 
with the sensible object. The ‘object of sense’ is used in three 
meanings, two of which touch the essential nature of sensation 
and one its accidents. Of the two first-named, one applies spe- 
cially to each particular sense, the other is common to them all. 
By ‘peculiar object of sense’ I mean a sense-quality which can- 
not be apprehended by a sense different from that to which it 
belongs, and concerning which that sense cannot be deceived, 
e.g. colour is the peculiar object of vision, sound of hearing, 
flavour of taste. Touch, however, discriminates several sense- 
qualities. The other particular senses, on the contrary, dis- 
tinguish only their peculiar objects, and the senses are not
-P-A-G-E-82
  
60 ARISTOTLE 
deccived in the fact that a quality is colour or sound, although 
they may be deceived as to what or where the coloured or 
sonorous object may be. Such qualities are called the peculiar 
objects of particular senses, whereas common objects are mo- 
tion, rest, number, form, magnitude. Properties of the latter 
kind are not the peculiar objects of any sense, but are common 
to them all. Motion is apprehended by touch and by sight. 
A thing is an object of sense accidentally, e.g. when a white 
object proves to be the son of Diares. The latter is perceived 
accidentally, for the person whom one perceives is an accident 
of the white object. Therefore, the sense as such is not affected 
by the sensible object ([as a person]). To the objects of sense, 
strictly regarded, belong such properties as are peculiarly and 
properly sense-qualities, and it is with these that the essential 
nature of each sense is naturally concerned. 
BOOK III. SENSATION, IMAGINATION AND 
THOUGHT 
CHAPTER I. THE ‘COMMON SENSIBLES’ 
Tuat there is no additional sense beyond the five we have 
enumerated (I mean sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch), 
one may believe from the following considerations. Granted 
that we really have perception of everything for which touch is 
the appropriate sense (for all the qualities of the tangible as 
such are apprehended by touch), it is necessary that if any 
sensation is lacking, some organ must also be lacking in us. 
Whatever we perceive by contact is perceived by the sense of 
touch, with which we are endowed. On the other hand, what- 
ever we perceive through media and not by direct contact, is 
perceived by simple elements, such as air and water. The con- 
ditions here are such that if several sensible objects which differ 
from each other generically are perceived by a single medium, 
then anyone who has a sense-organ analogous to this medium 
must be capable of perceiving these several sense-objects. For 
example, if the sense-organ is composed of air and the air is the
-P-A-G-E-83
    
PSYCHOLOGY 61 
medium of both sound and colour, the organ would perceive 
both these sense-qualities. If, on the other hand, several ele- 
ments are mediators of the same sense-qualities, as e.g. colour is 
mediated both by air and water (for both are diaphanous), 
then the organ which contains one of these elements alone will 
perceive that which is mediated by both of them. The sense- 
organs are composed exclusively of these two simple elements, 
air and water (for the pupil of the eye is composed of water, the 
hearing of air, smell of one or the other of these). Fire, how- 
ever, belongs to no organ or it is common to them all (for 
nothing is sentient without heat). Earth belongs either to no 
organ or it is chiefly and in a special manner combined with 
touch. Nothing would remain, therefore, excepting air and 
water, to constitute a sense-organ. Some animals have, in act- 
ual fact, these organs as described. Animals which are perfect 
and not defective have all these senses. For even the mole, as 
one may observe, has eyes underneath its skin. Consequently, 
unless there are bodies other than those known to us, or quali- 
ties other than those which belong to earthly bodies, we may 
conclude there is no sense lacking in us. 
Neither is it possible that there should be any peculiar organ 
for the perception of common properties such as we perceive 
accidentally by means of the individual senses, e.g. common 
properties like motion, rest, form, magnitude, number, unity. 
For all these properties we perceive by means of motion, e.g. 
magnitude is perceived by motion. So also is form, for form is a 
sort of magnitude, and rest we perceive from the absence of 
motion. We perceive numbers by the negation of continuity 
and by the special senses, for each sensation is experienced as a 
unit. So, then, it is clearly impossible that any particular sense 
should apply to these common properties, such as motion. For 
this would be like one now perceiving the sweet by means of 
sight. This is because we happen to have senses for both qual- 
ities ((z.e. for the sweet and for colour]), whereby when the given 
qualities coincide in one object, we recognize the object as 
sweet. Otherwise we do not perceive the sweet, excepting in the 
sense of accident, as e.g. when we recognize the son of Cleon not
-P-A-G-E-84
  62 ARISTOTLE 
because he is Cleon’s son, but because he is a fair object, which 
for the son of Cleon is an accident. 
We have indeed a ‘common sense’ for the perception of 
common qualities. I do not mean accidentally. It is therefore 
not a particular sense, for in that case we should perceive in no 
other way than as just now described in the illustration of 
Cleon. A sense, however, perceives accidentally the qualities 
that are peculiar to a different sense, not in their own nature 
but because of the unity of these qualities, as when two sense- 
qualities apply to the same object, e.g. in the case of bile that 
it is both bitter and yellow. Now, it is not the function of either 
particular sense to say that both these qualities inhere in one 
thing and it is owing to this fact that error arises, when in the 
case of a yellow substance one opines it to be bile. One might 
ask why we are endowed with several senses and not with one 
only. Is it not that facts of sequence and coincidence, such 
as motion, magnitude, and number, might the less escape us? 
For if we possessed sight only, and this were limited to the per- 
ception of whiteness, then all other distinctions would the more 
easily escape our knowledge, and because colour and magnitude 
are always coincident, they would appear to be identical. In 
point of fact, however, since these common qualities are found 
in different sense-objects, it is evident that the several quali- 
ties themselves are different. 
CHAPTER II. THE ‘COMMON SENSE’ 
Bur inasmuch as we perceive that we see and hear, we must 
have this consciousness of vision either by the instrument of 
sight or by some other faculty.1 The same faculty will then 
apply both to sight and to colour, the object of sight. In this 
case, either we shall have two senses for the same thing, or a 
sense will be conscious of itself. Further, if there is another 
sense for the perception of sight, either we shall have an infinite 
regressus, or a given sense must finally be cognizant of itself, in 
which case one would better admit this in the instance of the 
1 This function of consciousness is performed by the ‘ sensus communis.’
-P-A-G-E-85
  PSYCHOLOGY 63 
original sense itself, z.e. sight. Here, however, is a difficulty. 
For, if sensation by means of sight is vision, and colour or that 
which possesses colour is what we see, then the seeing faculty 
itself must first of all have colour in order to be seen. It is plain, 
therefore, that sensation by means of sight is not employed in 
a single meaning. For even when we do not see, it is by means 
of sight that we judge both of darkness and light, although 
not in the same way. Furthermore, the seeing subject is in a 
certain sense saturated with colour, since each sentient organ 
receives into itself the sensible object without its matter. 
This explains the fact that when objects of sense have been 
removed, the sensations and images still persist in the sense- 
organ. 
The actualization of the object of sense and of the sense itself 
is one and the same process; they are not, however, identicai 
with each other in their essential nature. I mean, for instance, 
actual sound and actual hearing are not the same. For it is pos- 
sible for one who has hearing not to hear, and for a sonorous 
body not to emit sound at every instant. When, however, that 
which has the potentiality of hearing and that which has the” 
potentiality of sounding, actually hear and actually emit sound, 
at that moment the realized hearing and the realized sound are 
simultaneously complete, and one would call them respectively 
the sensation of hearing and the act of sounding. If, then, 
movement, activity, and passivity are implied in the produced 
object, it must be that actual sound and hearing exist in a po- 
tential state. For creative and motive activity is given in ante- 
cedent passivity. It is, therefore, not necessary for the moving 
principle to be itself in actual motion. For as action and passion 
find their expression in the object acted upon and not in the 
producing agent, so too the actualization of the sensible object 
and the sense-organ is expressed in the latter. The actualiza- 
tion of a sonorous body is sound or sounding; the actualization 
of the hearing organ is audition or hearing. For hearing is two- 
fold and sound is twofold, and the same statement applies to 
other senses and sense-objects. In some instances the two have 
a distinct name, as e.g. hearing and sounding; in other instances 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  
  64 ARISTOTLE 
one of the two is nameless. For the actualization of sight is 
called seeing, but the actualization of colour has no name; the 
actualization of the organ of taste is called tasting, while the 
actualization of flavour is nameless. Inasmuch as the actuali- 
zation of the sense-object and the sense-organ is one and the 
same process, although the two things differ in their essential 
nature, it is necessary that hearing and sound, in this sense, 
should be both either destroyed together or preserved together; 
and the same applies to flavour and taste, and to the other 
sense-correlates. This necessity does not, however, apply to 
the sense-correlates in their potential signification. On the 
contrary, the old naturalists were wrong here, supposing, as 
they did, that neither white nor black has existence apart from 
sight, nor flavour apart from taste. In one way they were right 
and in another wrong. For owing to the fact that sense and 
sense-object have a twofold signification, namely that of poten- 
tiality and that of actuality, their dictum was applicable to the 
one meaning, but not to the other. They applied it, however, 
to things absolutely which are not predicated absolutely. 
If harmony is voice of a certain kind, and if voice and hearing 
are in a sense one and the same, and in another sense not one 
and the same, and if, further, harmony is a relation of parts, 
hearing must likewise be a relation of parts. It is for this reason 
([i.e. because sensation is a kind of proportion]) that every 
excessive stimulus, whether acute or grave, disturbs hearing. 
In like manner the sense of taste is disturbed by excessive fla- 
vours, the sense of sight by extremely glaring or extremely faint 
colours, smell by excessive odours, whether cloying or acrid. 
Consequently, qualities are agreeable when, pure and unmixed, 
they are reduced to proportion, as e.g. the pungent, sweet, or 
saline, or in the domain of touch, the warm and cool. It is then 
that properties are pleasant. In general, the mixed, rather than 
the acute or grave alone, is harmony. And sensation is propor- 
tion. Excessive stimuli either produce pain or pervert the 
organ. 
Every sense is directed to its own peculiar sense-object; it is 
given in the sense-organ as such, and it distinguishes the differ-
-P-A-G-E-87
  PSYCHOLOGY 65 
ent qualities in its appointed sense-object, as e.g. white and 
black in the case of sight, sweet and bitter in the case of taste. 
And the same can be said of other senses. Now inasmuch as we 
distinguish white, sweet, and every sense-quality by its relation 
to a particular sense, by what instrument do we perceive that 
these qualities differ from one another? We must do so by 
means of sensation, for they are sense-qualities. Is it not plain 
that the flesh is not the final organ of sense? For the judging 
subject would then necessarily distinguish an object by con- 
tact. Neither is it possible by means of the distinct senses to 
judge that sweet is different from white, but it is necessary that 
both these qualities be cognized by some one faculty; other- 
wise it would be like my perceiving one thing and you another, 
and so proving that they are different. A single faculty must, 
therefore, say that they are different. For the sweet is actually 
different from the white. One and the same faculty, then, must 
affirm this. And as this faculty affirms, so do thought and 
perception agree. It is clear that we cannot judge of distinct 
qualities by different senses, and we can conclude from this 
that we cannot judge of them at distinct intervals of time. For 
it is one and the same principle in us which says that the good is 
different from the bad. Further, it says that they are different 
and distinct at the moment when this affirmation ismade. And 
when is not used here in an accidental sense, by which I mean: 
when does not apply merely to the time of the affirmation, e.g. 
I say now that it is different, but it applies also to the thing 
affirmed, I say that it is different now, i.e. the time applies to the 
assertion and thing coincidently. So the two elements here are 
inseparable, and are given in an indivisible moment of time. It 
is impossible for the same thing or an indivisible entity to under- 
go opposite processes simultaneously and in an indivisible mo- 
ment of time. For if sweetness stimulates sensation or thought 
in one way, then bitter stimulates it in an opposite way and 
whiteness in some other way. Is, then, the judging principle! 
something at once numerically indivisible and inseparable, 
yet separable in the mode of its existence? There is a sense, 
1 The judging principle is the ‘common sense.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  66 ARISTOTLE 
then, in which as divisible it perceives the divisible, and a sense 
in which as indivisible it perceives the indivisible. For in its 
significant being it is divisible, but spatially and numerically it 
isindivisible. Or is this not possible? Potentially, indeed, one 
and the same indivisible thing may contain opposite properties, 
but not in actuality; in its realized self it is separate, and it is 
impossible for a thing to be at the same moment both black and 
white. So that it is not possible for even the forms of experience 
to undergo these opposites, if sensation and thought be such 
forms. Rather the case here is similar to what some call a point, 
which is divisible or indivisible, as one regards it in its single or 
dual nature. In so far as it is indivisible, the judging principle is 
one and coincident with perception; in so far as it is divisible, 
it is not one, for it employs twice and simultaneously the same 
mark. In so far as it employs a terminal mark as two, it dis- 
tinguishes two things, and these are separable for it as a separa- 
ble faculty. In so far as it regards the point as one, it judges 
singly and coincidently with perception. 
In this way, then, let us state our definition of the principle 
by virtue of which we say that animals are sentient beings. 
CHAPTER III. IMAGINATION 
Inasmucu as the soul is defined mainly by means of two 
attributes, namely by locomotion on the one hand and by 
thought, judgment, and sensation on the other, it is supposed 
that thought and reflexion are a kind of sensation (for in both 
instances the soul discriminates and cognizes some reality), and 
even the old writers tell us that reflexion and sensation are iden- 
tical, as e.g. Empedocles, who said: “Wisdom groweth in man 
in the face of a present object’’; and in another verse: “Hence 
is given unto them the power of reflecting ever and anon on 
diverse things”; and the words of Homer have the same mean- 
ing: “Such is the mind.” For all of these ancient writers regard 
thought as something somatic, like sensation, and believe that 
both in sensation and thought like is apprehended by like, as 
we said in the beginning of this treatise. They should at the
-P-A-G-E-89
  PSYCHOLOGY 67 
same time have spoken of error, for to animals this is more 
natural than truth, and their souls pass most of their existence 
in error. According to this theory, as some hold, either all 
phenomena must be true or else error consists in the contact of 
the unlike, for this is the opinion that is opposed to the cogni- 
tion of like by like. Further, in this case error and knowledge of 
opposites seem to be identical. That sensation and reflexion, 
therefore, are not identical is evident. For all animals share in 
the one, but few only in the other. Neither is thought, in which 
right and wrong are determined, i.e. right in the sense of practi- 
cal judgment, scientific knowledge, and true opinion, and wrong 
in the sense of the opposite of these, — thought in this significa- 
tion is not identical with sensation. For sensation when applied 
to its own peculiar objects is always true, and is inherent in all 
- animals; but it is possible for discursive thought to be false, 
and it is found in no animal which is not also endowed with 
reason. Imagination, too, is different from sensation and dis- 
cursive thought. At the same time, it is true that imagination 
is impossible without sensation, and conceptual thought, in 
turn, is impossible without imagination. That thought and 
conception, however, are not one and the same is evident. For 
imagination is under our control, and can be stimulated when 
we wish (for it is possible to call up before our eyes an imaginary 
object, as one employs images in the art of mnemonics). Con- 
ception, on the other hand, is not under our control. For it 
must be either false or true. Furthermore, when we conceive 
that something is terrible or fearful, we have at once a corre- 
sponding feeling, and the same may be said of what inspires 
courage. But in the case of imagination we are in the same con- 
dition as if we were to place a terrible or a courage-inspiring 
object before us in a picture. In conception itself there are 
distinct forms, such as knowledge, opinion, reflexion, and their 
opposites, concerning whose different meanings we shall speak 
later. 
Since thinking differs from sense-perception, and in one sig- 
nification appears to be imagination and in another significa- 
tion conception, we must proceed to the treatment of the latter, 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  68 ARISTOTLE 
after we have defined imagination. If imagination means the 
power whereby what we call a phantasm is awakened in us, and 
if our use of language here is not merely metaphorical, then 
imagination is one of those faculties or mental forces in us by 
virtue of which we judge and are capable of truth and error. 
And these faculties include sensation, opinion, scientific know- 
ledge, and reasoning. That imagination is not to be confounded 
with sense-perception is plain from the following considera- 
tions. Sensation is either a mere power or a distinct act, like 
sight and seeing, but imagination is present when neither of 
these conditions is realized, viz. in the phantasms of dreams. 
Again, sensation is always present, but this is not true of imag- 
ination. If in reality it were identical with sensation, then all 
animals would have imagination. This does not seem to be the 
fact, as we find in the case of the ant, the bee, and the worm. 
Again, sensations are always true, while imaginations are for 
the most part false. In the next place, we do not say when we 
are accurately observing a sense-object, that we imagine it to 
be aman. We say this rather when we do not clearly perceive 
[and when the perception may be true or false], and as we 
said above, we see imaginary pictures even when our eyes are 
closed. But neither is imagination one of those faculties whose 
deliverances are always true, as e.g. scientific knowledge and 
reason. Forimagination can also be false. It remains to be con- 
sidered whether it is opinion, for opinion can be either true or 
false. Opinion, however, is followed by belief (for no man can 
have an opinion and not believe what he opines), and none of 
the lower animals possesses belief, although imagination is found 
in many of them. [Again, every opinion is followed by belief, as 
belief is followed by persuasion, and persuasion by reason. Now, 
some of the lower animals have imagination, but none of them 
have reason.] It is plain, then, that imagination is not opinion 
combined with sensation, nor mediated by sensation, nora com- 
plex of opinion and sensation, and, for the same reason, it is clear 
that opinion has for its object nothing else than what sensation 
has for its object. I mean e.g. that imagination is the complex 
of an opinion of whiteness and a sensation of whiteness, and not
-P-A-G-E-91
  
PSYCHOLOGY 69 
the complex of an opinion of goodness and a sensation of white- 
ness. Toimagine, therefore, is to opine what, strictly regarded, 
is a sense-object. Again, there are false appearances when we 
have correct conceptions, as é.g. in the case of the sun which 
appears to be a foot in diameter, whereas we believe it to be 
larger than the inhabited earth. The consequence is that we 
must either have thrown aside our true opinion which we held, 
without the thing having changed and without any forgetful- 
ness or change of conviction on our part; or if one still holds it, 
it is necessary that the same opinion be both true and false. 
But an opinion has become false in a case where an object, with- 
out our knowing it, has changed. Imagination, then, is not one 
of these faculties nor a derivative of them. 
Since one thing when moved can communicate motion to 
another, and since imagination is held to be a form of motion 
which does not come into existence without sense-perception, 
but only in sentient creatures or in reference to objects to which 
sensation applies, and since motion is produced by the action 
of sense-perception, and this motion must be equal to the 
strength of the sensation, one can affirm that the motion of 
imagination would never be possible without sensation nor could 
it take place in non-sentient creatures. Further, the one who 
experiences it can act and be acted upon in many ways, and 
one’s experiences may be true or false. This truth or falsehood 
is due to the following causes. Sense-perception is true when it 
concerns its own peculiar objects; at any rate, there is involved 
in this case, the least possible amount of error. In the second 
place, sense-perception may concern the accidental, and here 
error begins to be possible. One is not mistaken in saying that 
a thing is white, but if one says the white object is this or that 
particular thing, error arises. In the third place, error applies 
to common properties and concomitants of the accidental, in 
which peculiar properties are involved. I mean e.g. motion and 
magnitude, which are accidental properties of sensible objects, 
and concerning which we are especially liable to error in sense- 
perception. The motion set up by the activity of sensation 
will differ in terms of the three following forms of sense-percep-  
-P-A-G-E-92
  70 ARISTOTLE 
tion. The first movement is when the sense-perception con- 
tinues present, and this is true; the other two may be false 
whether the object is present or withdrawn, but are especially 
liable to error when the sense-object is removed. 
If imagination contains nothing but the elements named and 
is what we have described it to be, it would be a movement 
stimulated by actualized sense-perception. Since sight is our 
principal sense, imagination has derived its name from light, 
because sight is impossible without light. Because images per- 
sist and resemble sense-perceptions, animals regulate their 
acticns to a large degree by imagination, some of them because 
they are incapable of reason, as the lower brutes, others because 
reason is sometimes veiled by passion, disease, or sleep, as is the 
case amongst men. Concerning imagination, what its nature 
is and what end it subserves, let the foregoing suffice. 
CHAPTER IV. THE THEORY OF REASON 
REGARDING that part of the soul by virtue of which one 
knows and reflects, whether it be a distinct part or whether it 
be distinct only notionally and not really, we have now to con- 
sider what its differential mark is, and by what process thinking 
is exercised. If thinking is like sense-perception, it would be 
either a kind of impression made by the object of cognition or 
some analogous process. It must, then, be impassive and yet 
receptive of the form, and in its nature potentially like to the 
object of thought without being this object; and as the sense- 
organ is related to the object of sense, in a similar way thought 
must be related to the object of thought. Reason must, there- 
fore, be unmixed, as Anaxagoras says, since it thinks every- 
thing, in order that it may rule, z.e. in order that it may know. 
It is the nature of thought to preclude and restrain the element 
that is foreign and adjacently seen. Its nature is, therefore, 
exclusively potentiality. What we call reason in the soul (by 
reason I mean the instrument by which the soul thinks and 
forms conceptions) is, prior to the exercise of thought, no reality 
at all. It is, therefore, wrong to suppose that reason itself is
-P-A-G-E-93
  PSYCHOLOGY 7 
mixed with the body. For in that case it would have certain 
qualitative distinctions such as warm or cold, or it would be a 
sort of instrument, like a sense-organ. But in point of fact it is 
nothing of the kind. Certain writers! have happily called the 
soul the place of ideas, only this description does not apply to 
the soul as a whole, but merely to the power of thought, and 
it applies to ideas only in the sense of potentiality, and not 
of actuality. It is evident from the sense-organ and from the 
nature of sensation, that the term impassivity is employed in 
a different meaning in sensation and in thinking. For sense- 
perception cannot take place when the sense-stimulus is exces- 
sive, as one does not hear sound in the midst of loud noises, 
neither can one see nor smell in the midst of excessively bright 
colours and strong odours. On the other hand, when the mind 
thinks a very profound thought, it thinks not in a lesser but ina 
deeper degree minor details. For the power of sensation is not 
independent of the body, while the mind is separable. When 
reason becomes its several objects in the sense in which an 
actually learned man is said to be learned (and this takes place 
when he can exercise knowledge through his own agency), even 
then reason is in a certain sense potential, although this poten- 
tiality differs from that which preceded learning and discovery. 
In the latter case, potentiality signifies the capacity of thinking 
itself. 
There is a difference between concrete magnitude and the 
ultimate nature of magnitude, between water and the ultimate 
nature of water (the same distinction can be applied to other 
instances, though not to all, for in some cases they are identi- 
cal). Concrete flesh and the ultimate nature of flesh one judges 
either by a different and distinct faculty or by the same faculty 
under differing conditions. Flesh is not separate from matter, 
but like a snub-nose, it is a particular thing in a given some- 
thing. By means of a sense-organ one discriminates heat and 
cold and those qualities of which flesh is a sort of register. On 
the other hand, reason judges of the essential nature of flesh 
either by a different and distinct faculty, or in the way in which 
1 Plato and the Academy.
-P-A-G-E-94
    
72 ARISTOTLE 
a bent line is related to itself when straightened. We refer the 
straight line as we do the snub-nose to abstract entities, for they 
are both associated with the continuous. But the essential no- 
tion of a thing, if straightness and the straight line are different 
(and they are two things), is apprehended by a different power. 
The mind, then, judges in the two cases by means of a differ- 
ent power or by means of a power differently conditioned. Ina 
word, therefore, as there are things abstracted from matter, so 
there are things that concern the reason. If the mind is simple 
and impassive, and has nothing in common with anything else, 
as Anaxagoras! says, and if thinking means to be somehow im- 
pressed, one might ask, How will thought be possible? For it is 
only in so far as there is something common to two things that 
the one appears to act and the other to be acted upon. A further 
question might be raised, viz. whether the mind itself is the 
object of thought. If it is, mind will then either be found in 
other things, unless it is the object of thought in some way 
different from other objects, and unless the object of thought is 
a specific and single thing; else it will have a mixed composition 
which makes it like other things, the object of thought. Accord- 
ing to our former definition, ‘to be affected in reference to a 
common element,’ means that the mind is potentially the object 
of thought, though perhaps not actually so until thought takes 
place. It must be that the case here is similar to that of the tab- 
let on which nothing has been actually written. This is what 
takes place in the case of mind, and it is the object of thought 
as other things are. Where entities are without matter, the 
subject and object of thought are identical. Speculative thought 
and the thing speculatively known are one and the same. The 
reason why thought is not continuous must be investigated. 
On the other hand, when entities are material they are severally 
the object of thought only potentially; mind is not an element 
in them (for reason is the potentiality of such objects in abstrac- 
tion from their matter), whereas it is in the reason itself that 
the object of thought will be found. 
1 In‘his theory of sensation Anaxagoras says we do not apprehend like by 
like (Empedocles), but unlike by unlike, e.g. heat by cold.
-P-A-G-E-95
  PSYCHOLOGY 73 
CHAPTER V. ACTIVE AND PASSIVE REASON 
In the whole of nature there is on the one hand a material 
factor for every kind of thing (and this is what all things are in 
their potentiality), and another factor which is causative and 
productive of things, by virtue of its making all objects, as art 
stands related to the matter it employs. These distinctions 
must also hold good when applied to the soul. Reason is of such 
character that on the one hand it becomes all things, and on the 
other creates all things, in this respect resembling a property 
like light. For light in a certain sense converts potential into 
actual colours, and reason, in the present meaning, is separate, 
impassive, and unmixed, being in its essential nature an ener- 
gizing force. Now, action is always higher than passion and 
causal force higher than matter. Actual knowledge is identical 
with its object. Potential knowledge, on the other hand, pre- 
exists in the individual; regarded absolutely it does not so pre- 
exist. For mind does not at one moment think and at another 
not. In its separated state alone reason is what it is, immortal 
and eternal. We have no memory of it, because this part of 
reason is impassive. The passive reason, on the other hand, is 
perishable, and without it there can be no thought. 
CHAPTER VI. THOUGHT AND TRUTH 
WuEN thought is applied to indivisible terms, error does not 
arise. Where error and truth are both found is just in the com- 
bination of thoughts into a sort of unity. Empedocles e.g. says: 
“Wherefore the heads of many creatures sprang into life with- 
out necks,” and later on by the attraction of Friendship they 
were joined together. So, too, these disjoined ideas are combined 
together by the reason, as e.g. the ideas of the incommensur- 
able and the diagonal. If the ideas refer to the past or to the 
future, the element of time is added in the mind and combined 
with the ideas. Error is always due to the combination. For 
even in the case where one might think the white not to be white, 
one has made the combination of the ‘not-white.’ It is further
-P-A-G-E-96
74 ARISTOTLE 
possible to apply disjunction to everything. It is not only pos- 
sible for the statement ‘Cleon is fair’ to be true or false, but 
this may be applied to the past or to the future. The unifying 
principle is in every case the reason. Since the simple or indi- 
visible may be looked at from two standpoints, viz. either as 
potentiality or as actuality, there is nothing to prevent the 
mind from thinking the indivisible when it thinks of extension 
(which in its actual state is indivisible), and when it thinks it in 
an indivisible moment of time. For divisibility and indivisi- 
bility apply to time just as they do to length. It is, therefore, 
impossible to say what the mind thinks in each half of a time- 
division. For the half does not exist, except in potentiality, if 
the division has not been made. But in the act of thinking each 
half separately, the mind divides the time also, and then the 
time corresponds in its division to the two lengths. If, however, 
the mind thinks the object as a whole composed of two halves, 
it does this also with regard to time in its relation to the two 
halves. 
That which is not quantitatively but only notionally indi- 
visible, the mind thinks in an indivisible time and by an in- 
divisible power of the soul. It does this, however, accidentally 
and not in so far as the factors of thought and time are divisible, 
but in so far as they are indivisible. And there is also in these 
cases an objective factor which is indivisible, although perhaps 
not a separate entity, that gives a unity to time and extension. 
And this is likewise true of everything that is continuous, 
whether in time or space. The point and everything obtained 
by division, and whatever (like a point) is no longer divisible, 
are explicable in terms of privation. Similar reasoning may be 
applied to other cases, as é.g. the way in which we know evil or 
black. For we know them somehow or other by means of their 
contraries. But the knowing mind must be these things poten- 
tially, and they must be reduced to unity in the mind itself. If, 
however, in the case of any causal principle there is no opposite, 
then it knows itself, and is in actuality and is separate. A pre- 
dication, as e.g. an affirmation, asserts something of something 
else, and is in every instance either true or false. This does not
-P-A-G-E-97
  PSYCHOLOGY 7 
apply to the mind always, but when the mind asserts what a 
thing is in its essential nature and not what attaches to some- 
thing as a predicate, then it is true. And just as sight is true 
when it concerns its own proper object, and on the other hand 
the opinion that a visible white object is or is not a man may 
not always be true, so it is with all immaterial entities. 
CHAPTER VII. THOUGHT AND ITS OBJECT 
Actua knowledge is identical with its object. Potential 
knowledge is earlier in time in the individual, but taken abso- 
lutely it is not earlier in time. For all becoming proceeds from 
actual being. The sensible object appears to convert the poten- 
tially sensitive organ into an actually sensitive organ. For the 
sense-organ itself is not affected, and undergoes no change. 
That is the reason why we have here to do with a form of mo- 
tion different from motion in the ordinary sense. Motion was 
defined as a realization of the incomplete, but motion, abso- 
lutely regarded, is a different kind of activity, viz. the activity 
of the perfected thing. Mere sense-perception, then, is like a 
simple expression or a simple thought; when, however, the 
sensation is pleasant or painful, and thus corresponds to affir- 
mation or negation, the thing is pursued or avoided. To feel 
pleasure or pain signifies to experience an activity in a mean 
function of the sense-organ relative to good or bad as such. 
Avoidance and pursuit in their actual natures are identical, 
and the appetitive power whereby we desire or pursue a thing is 
not different from the power whereby we avoid a thing. They 
do not differ from each other or from the sensitive faculty. 
Only the expression of their being is different. Images are em- 
ployed by the conceptual reason as sense-presentations are by 
the sentient faculty. When the mind makes an affirmation or 
negation touching the good or bad, it avoids the one and pur- 
sues the other. The soul, therefore, never thinks without the 
use of images. As the air produces such or such an effect on the 
pupil of the eye, and the pupil in turn produces another effect 
(the same illustration may be applied to hearing), and yet the
-P-A-G-E-98
76 ARISTOTLE 
ultimate interpreter or medium of sensation is a single power 
whose being is expressed in several ways, ([so it is with images 
in reference to thought.]) As to the faculty by which we dis- 
criminate sweet and warm, although the problem has been 
mentioned above, it must be again discussed as follows. There 
is some unitary principle, and this unitary principle has the 
character of an ultimate term. Its deliverances are reduced 
to unity by means of comparison and numerical statement, and 
related to each other as the outward things are related to each 
other. The question as to how the mind judges like qualities, 
does not differ from the question as to how it judges opposite 
qualities such as white and black. Let A, the objectively white, 
be related to B, the objectively black, as the idea C is related to 
the idea D, or it may be stated conversely. Now, if the ideas 
CD attach to a certain thing, they will be related to each other 
([in the concept]) just as AB are related to each other, — they 
will form one and the same thing, though not identical in mode 
of being; and the former combination (CD) is analogous to the 
latter (AB). The same reasoning holds in case one were to 
apply A to a sweet object, and B to a white object. 
The reasoning mind thinks its ideas in the form of images; 
and as the mind determines the objects it should pursue or 
avoid in terms of these images, even in the absence of sensation, 
so it is stimulated to action when occupied with them. For 
example, when one sees that a beacon is lighted, and observes 
by means of the ‘common sense’ that it is in motion, one com- 
prehends that an enemy is near. Sometimes by means of the 
images or ideas in the soul the mind reasons as a seeing person, 
and takes thought for the future in terms of things before one’s 
eyes. When the mind there in its world of images says that a 
thing is pleasant or painful, here in the world of things it pur- 
sues or avoids, — in a word, it acts. Apart from action the true 
and false belong to the same category as the good and bad. 
They differ, however, in the absolute character of the one and 
the relative character of the other. 
The mind thinks abstractions, as e.g. when it thinks the snub- 
nosed, which in one sense is a snub-nose, and in another sense,
-P-A-G-E-99
    PSYCHOLOGY 77 
if one thinks it actually, one would think it as a curvature with- 
out the flesh in which the curvature is found. So too with math- 
ematical figures, though in actuality not separate from bodies, 
the mind thinks them as separated, when it thinks them. Ina 
word the mind is the thing when actually thinking it. Whether 
or not it is possible to think any abstraction when the mind it- 
self is not separate from magnitude, must be investigated later. 
CHAPTER VIII. IDEAS AND IMAGES 
Loox1nc at the main features of what has been said of the 
soul, let us reiterate the statement that it is in asense all reality. 
For everything, whether sensible or intelligible, is psychical; 
intelligible objects are in a sense knowledge, and sensible reali- 
ties are sensations. How this is possible remains to be investi- 
gated. Conceptual knowledge and sense-perception are each 
divided into two minds, corresponding to their objects; potential 
knowledge corresponding to potential objects, and actual to 
actual. The sensitive and conceptual powers of the soul are, 
potentially regarded, the objective things, viz. the intelligible 
and the sensible. The soul, then, must be either the things 
themselves or their form. It cannot, of course, be the things 
themselves. For a stone is not in the soul, but the form or idea 
of the stone. Consequently, the soul is to be thought of as a 
hand; for a hand is the instrument of all instruments, and the 
reason is the form of all forms and sensation in the form of all 
sensible realities. Since, however, there is no object, as is sup- 
posed, apart from sensible magnitudes, it follows that intel- 
ligible objects, —I mean abstractions, as we call them, on the 
one hand, and the qualities and conditions of the sensibles, 
on the other, — must be sought in the sense-forms. For this 
reason, also, it would be impossible for one to learn anything 
or understand anything without sense-perception, and when 
one contemplates a thing, one is forced to contemplate it in 
conjunction with an internal image. These images are like 
sense-presentations, with the exception that they are without 
matter. Imagination is different from affirmation and nega-  
-P-A-G-E-100
  78 ARISTOTLE 
tion; for the true and the false are the combination of ideas into 
a judgment. In what way are the primary ideas to be distin- 
guished from imagination? Or is it true that these ideas are not 
themselves images, yet they cannot be produced independently 
of images? 
CHAPTER IX. REASON AND DESIRE 
Stvce the soul of living beings is defined in terms of two 
powers, viz. the power of judgment (which is the function of 
thought) and the power of sensation on the one hand, and the 
power of locomotion on the other, let the above suffice for our 
treatment of sensation and thought, and let us now consider 
the moving principle and ask what part of the soul it may be. 
The further question arises whether it is an individual part of 
the soul and separate, either concretely or notionally, or whether 
it is the entire soul. If it is only a part, we must ask whether 
it is a peculiar part and distinct from those usually described 
and already mentioned here, or whether it is one of these. There 
is a difficulty at the start concerning the sense in which we are 
to employ the term ‘parts’ of the soul, and concerning their 
number. Forin acertain way they seem to be innumerable, and 
not merely confined to those which certain writers distinguish, 
viz. reason, will, and desire,! and others classify as rational and 
irrational elements. For according to the differences by which 
they distinguish these parts, there seem to be other parts that 
are even more distinct from each other than these, concerning 
which we have just now spoken, viz. the nutritive part, which 
is found even in plants as well as in all animals, and the sensi- 
tive part, which one could not easily classify either as irrational 
oras rational. Again, the power of imagination, which is differ- 
ent in its mode of being from the others, appears to be a distinct 
part, but in what particular it is identical with or different from 
the others, is very difficult to say, if one is to regard the parts 
of the soul as existing independently of one another. In addi- 
tion to these, there is the desiderative part, which both notion- 
1 Plato, Republic 441 A (Aoyorexdy, Oumoedés, excOuunrixdy),
-P-A-G-E-101
  PSYCHOLOGY 79 
ally and functionally might be supposed to differ from all the 
other parts. And yet it would be absurd to sever this from the 
others. For it is in the thinking element that volition arises, 
and in the irrational element we have desire and passion. But 
if the soul has three distinct parts, then the desiderative ele- 
ment must be in all of them. Moreover, the question again 
comes up which we raised just now, viz. what is the principle in 
animals that produces locomotion? One might suppose that it 
is the generative and nutritive powers, found in all living 
things, that produce the motion involved in growth and decay 
common to them all. The subjects of inspiration and expira- 
tion, sleeping and waking, must be investigated later, for all of 
them present great difficulties. But regarding locomotion, we 
must inquire what it is that gives animals the power of pro- 
gressive movement. It is evidently not the nutritive power, for 
progressive movement is always towards some end and accom- 
panied either by some image or desire. For where there is no 
desire or revulsion, there is no motion, excepting where exter- 
nal force is used. Further, if motion were due to the nutritive 
power, plants would be capable of locomotion and would have 
some organic member adapted to this motion. So, too, it 
cannot be the sensitive power that is the source of motion; for 
there are many animals which have sensation and yet, through- 
out their existence, are stationary and motionless. If, then, 
nature creates nothing in vain, neither does she omit anything 
that is necessary, save in cases of deformed or imperfect beings. 
And such animals as we have in mind are normal and not de- 
formed. A test of perfection is the capacity to reproduce, to 
reach the prime of growth, and then decline. Consequently, 
such animals should also have organs of movement. 
But neither is the thinking power nor what we call reason the 
cause of animal motion. For the contemplative power does not 
think upon what is to be carried into execution, neither has it 
anything to say touching what is to be avoided or pursued, 
whereas motion always belongs to that which pursues or avoids 
an object. On the contrary, when one contemplates anything, 
the mind does not bid one pursue or avoid; e.g. the fearful or
-P-A-G-E-102
80 ARISTOTLE 
pleasant is often the subject of thought, but the feeling of fear 
is not suggested; the heart, however, is agitated, or if the feeling 
is pleasure, some other organ is stirred. More than this, even 
when the reason commands and intelligence tells us to avoid or 
to pursue a thing, motion does not follow, but one acts accord- 
ing to one’s desire, like an intemperate man. We observe, in 
general, that the man versed in medicine does not heal, because 
it is something other than science that has the power of acting 
according to the principles of science. Neither, again, is desire 
the dominating principle in this motion; for continent men, 
though filled with desire and appetite, do not do the things for 
which they lust; on the contrary, they follow reason. 
CHAPTER X. PSYCHOLOGY AND CONDUCT 
THERE are two powers in the soul which appear to be moving 
forces — desire and reason, if one classifies imagination as a 
kind of reason. For many creatures follow their imaginations 
contrary to rational knowledge, and in animals other than 
man it is not thought nor rational procedure that determines 
action, but imagination. Consequently, both of these, rea- 
son and desire, can produce locomotion —I mean here the 
reason that considers ends and is concerned with conduct. It 
differs from the theoretical reason in having a moral end. 
Every desire aims at something. It is the final end that is the 
initial cause in conduct. So that it is reasonable to regard 
these two principles, viz. desire and practical reason, as motor 
forces. For the object of desire stimulates us, and through it 
reason stimulates us, because the object of desire is the main 
thing in the practical reason. Imagination, too, when it stimu- 
lates us to action, does not do so independently of desire. The 
one single moving force is the object of desire. For even if 
there were two moving powers, reason and desire, still they 
would produce movement in accordance with some common 
idea. As a matter of fact, however, reason does not appear to 
produce movement independently of desire. For volition is a 
form of desire, and when one is prompted to action in accord-
-P-A-G-E-103
  
PSYCHOLOGY 81 
ance with reason, the action follows also in accordance with 
volition. But desire prompts actions in violation of reason. For 
appetite is a sort of desire. Reason, then, is in every case right, 
but desire and imagination may be right or wrong. It is, there- 
fore, always the object of desire that excites action, and this is 
either the good or the apparent good — yet not every good, but 
only the good in conduct, and this practical good admits of 
variation. 
Evidently the psychical power which excites to action has the 
nature of desire, as we call it. In analysing the elements of the 
soul, if one analyses and distinguishes them in terms of powers, 
they become very numerous, as e.g. the nutritive, sensitive, 
rational, deliberative, and desiderative. For these differ from 
each other more than do the desiderative and spirited elements. 
Although desires arise which are opposed to each other, as is the 
case when reason and appetite are opposed, it happens only in 
creatures endowed with asense of time. (For reason, on account 
of the future, bids us resist, while desire regards the present; the 
momentarily pleasant appears to it as the absolutely pleasant 
and the absolutely good, because it does not see the future.) 
The moving principle, which is the desiderative faculty as such, 
is specifically one, though numerically several motive forces 
may be included in it. The main element here is the object of 
desire (for this by being the object of thought or imagination 
excites movement, while it is itself unmoved). There are, then, 
three terms to consider here: first the motor power, secondly 
the instrument of motion, and thirdly the object set in motion. 
The motor power is twofold: on the one hand, it is an unmoved 
element, and on the other, a moving and moved element. The 
unmoved element is the good to be done; the moving and moved 
element is the desiderative faculty (for the desiderative faculty 
in so far as it desires is moved, and desire in process of realiza- 
tion is a form of motion); the object which is set in motion is 
the animal. The instrument by which desire effects motion, 
is of course the body, and consequently it must be investigated 
where we have to do with functions which are common to the 
body and the soul. One may, however, say summarily here that di]
-P-A-G-E-104
  82 ARISTOTLE 
motion is organic in those cases where beginning and end are 
one, as ¢.g.in a joint. For here the convex and concave are 
beginning and end. Therefore the one is at rest and the other 
in motion, and while they are notionally distinct, they are con- 
cretely inseparable. Everything is set in motion by push or 
pull, and there must be, consequently, a fixed point, as the cen- 
tre in a circle, and this is the initial point of motion. In a word, 
then, as we said before, an animal in so far as it is capable of 
desire is capable of self-movement. Desire, however, is not 
found apart from imagination, and all imagination is either 
rational or sensitive in origin, and the lower animals share in it. 
CHAPTER XI. THE MOVING PRINCIPLE 
WE must inquire also into the nature of the moving princi- 
ple in those imperfect animals which possess only the sense of 
touch. Is it possible for them to have imagination or desire? 
They appear to feel pleasure and pain, and if these are felt they 
must necessarily have desire also. But how could they have 
imagination? Or are we to say that just as their movements are 
indefinite, so too this power is possessed by them, only it is 
infinitely developed. Imagination derived from sensation is, as 
we said before, found in the lower animals, but deliberative 
imagination is found only in those animals which are endowed 
with reason. For whether one shall do this or that is, of course, 
a matter of deliberation, and there must be some single instru- 
ment of measurement at hand (for it is the greater good that is 
to be pursued), and so the mind is able to make a single repre- 
sentation out of several images. The ground for supposing that 
animals do not have opinion is that they do not have the faculty 
for drawing rational conclusions, and opinion involves this. 
Consequently, their desire lacks the deliberative quality. 
Sometimes the desire overpowers the deliberative element in 
man and excites to action. At other times the will overpowers 
the desire, and again, like a ball tossed to and fro, one desire 
overpowers another, as in the case of intemperance. In the 
workings of nature the higher element always has the greater
-P-A-G-E-105

authority and is the moving power. There are, then, three forms 
of movement. The faculty of conceptual thought is not moved, 
but remains at rest. Since we have two principles in conduct, 
on the one hand the general conception and notion, and on the 
other hand the particular notion (of which the one says a man 
of such and such a kind shall act in such a way, and the other 
that this particular man — and I am that particular man — 
shall act in a given way), it is the latter notion that incites to 
action, but the general one does not. Or both of them combined 
may lead to action, although the general notion is quiescent, 
and the particular one active.

BOOK VII. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE STOICS 
THE Stoics have chosen to treat, in the first place, of percep- 
tion and sensation, because the criterion by which the truth of 
facts is ascertained is a kind of perception, and because the 
judgment which expresses the belief, and the comprehension, 
and the understanding of a thing, a judgment which precedes 
all others, cannot exist without perception. For perception 
leads the way; and then thought, finding vent in expressions, 
explains in words the feelings which it derives from perception. 
But there is a difference between gavracia and ¢avracua. For 
avtacpya is a conception of the intellect, such as takes place in 
sleep; but ¢avracia is an impression, tU7wors, produced on 
the mind, that is to say, an alteration, aAXolwous, as Chry- 
sippus states in the twelfth book of his treatise on the Soul. 
For we must not take this impression to resemble that made by 
a seal, since it is impossible to conceive that there should be 
many impressions made at the same time on the same thing. 
But davracia is understood to be that which is impressed, 
and formed, and imprinted by a real object, according to a real 
object, in such a way as it could not be by any other than a real 
object; and, according to their ideas of the davracia:, some are

  DIOGENES LAERTIUS’ LIVES 85 
sensible, and some are not. Those they call sensible, which are 
derived by us from some one or more senses; and those they 
call not sensible, which emanate directly from the thought, as 
for instance, those which relate to incorporeal objects, or any 
others which are embraced by reason. Again, those which are 
sensible, are produced by a real object, which imposes itself on 
the intelligence, and compels its acquiescence; and there are 
also some others, which are simply apparent, mere shadows, 
which resemble those which are produced by real objects. 
Again, these ¢avtdovat are divided into rational and irra- 
tional; those which are rational belong to animals capable of 
reason; those which are irrational to animals destitute of reason. 
Those which are rational are thoughts; those which are irrational 
have no name; but are again subdivided into artificial and not 
artificial. At all events, an image is contemplated in a different 
light by a man skilful in art, from that in which it is viewed by a 
man ignorant of art. 
By sensation, the Stoics understand a species of breath which 
proceeds from the dominant portion of the soul to the senses, 
whether it be a sensible perception, or an organic disposition, 
which, according to the notions of some of them, is crippled 
and vicious. They also call sensation the energy, or active exer- 
cise, of the sense. According to them, it is to sensation that we 
owe our comprehension of white and black, and rough and 
smooth: from reason, that we derive the notions which result 
from a demonstration, those for instance which have for their 
object the existence of Gods, and of Divine Providence. For 
all our thoughts are formed either by indirect perception, or by 
similarity, or analogy, or transposition, or combination, or oppo- 
sition. By a direct perception, we perceive those things which 
are the objects of sense; by similarity, those which start from 
some point present to our senses; as, for instance, we form an 
idea of Socrates from his likeness. We draw our conclusions by 
analogy, adopting either an increased idea of the thing, as of 
Tityus, or the Cyclops; or a diminished idea, as of a pigmy. So, 
too, the idea of the centre of the world was one derived ‘by 
analogy from what we perceived to be the case of the smaller
-P-A-G-E-108
  86 ZENO 
spheres. We use transposition when we fancy eyes in a man’s 
breast; combination, when we take in the idea of a Centaur; 
opposition, when we turn our thoughts to death. Some ideas 
we also derive from comparison, for instance, from a compari- 
son of words and places. 
There is also nature; as by nature we comprehend what is 
just and good. And privation, when for instance, we form a 
notion of a man without hands. Such are the doctrines of the 
Stoics, on the subject of phantasia, and sensation, and thought. 
XXXVII. They say that the proper criterion of truth is the 
comprehension, ¢avtacia; that is to say, one which is derived 
from a real object, as Chrysippus asserts in the twelfth book of 
his Physics; and he is followed by Antipater and Apollodorus. 
For Boethius leaves a great many criteria, such as intellect, 
sensation, appetite, and knowledge; but Chrysippus dissents 
from his view, and in the first book of his treatise on Reason, 
says, that sensation and preconception are the only criteria. 
And preconception is, according to him, a comprehensive 
physical notion of general principles. But others of the earlier 
Stoics admit right reason as one criterion of the truth; for in- 
stance, this is the opinion of Posidonius, and is advanced by 
him in his essay on Criteria. 
LXIII. The Stoics also say that the mind is divisible into 
eight parts; for that the five organs of sensation, and the vocal 
power, and the intellectual power, which is the mind itself, and 
the generative power, are all parts of the mind. But by error, 
there is produced a perversion which operates on the intellect, 
from which many perturbations arise, and many causes of in- 
constancy. And all perturbation is itself, according to Zeno, a 
movement of the mind, or superfluous inclination, which is 
irrational, and contrary to nature. Moreover, of the superior 
class of perturbations, as Hecaton says, in the second book of 
his treatise on the Passions, and as Zeno also says in his work 
on the Passions, there are four kinds, grief, fear, desire, and 
pleasure. And they consider that these perturbations are judg- 
ments, as Chrysippus contends in his work on the Passions; for 
covetousness is an opinion that money is a beautiful object, and
-P-A-G-E-109
DIOGENES LAERTIUS’ LIVES 87 
in like manner drunkenness and intemperance, and other things 
of the sort, are judgments. And grief they define to be an irra- 
tional contraction of the mind, and it is divided into the follow- 
ing species, pity, envy, emulation, jealousy, pain, perturbation, 
sorrow, anguish, confusion. Pity is a grief over some one, on the 
ground of his being in undeserved distress. Envy is a grief, at 
the good fortune of another. Emulation is a grief at that be- 
longing to some one else, which one desires one’s self. Jealousy 
is a grief at another also having what one has one’s self. Pain is 
a grief which weighs one down. Perturbation is grief which 
narrows one, and causes one to feel in a strait. Sorrow is a 
grief arising from deliberate thought, which endures for some 
time, and gradually increases. Anguish is a grief with acute 
pain. Confusion is an irrational grief, which frets one, and pre- 
vents one from clearly discerning present circumstances. But 
fear is the expectation of evil; and the following feelings are all 
classed under the head of fear: apprehension, hesitation, shame, 
perplexity, trepidation, and anxiety. Apprehension is a fear 
which produces alarm. Shame is a fear of discredit. Hesitation 
is a fear of coming activity. Perplexity is a fear, from the im- 
agination of some unusual thing. Trepidation is a fear accom- 
panied with an oppression of the voice. Anxiety is a fear of 
some uncertain event. 
Again, desire is an irrational appetite; to which head, the 
following feelings are referrible: want, hatred, contentiousness, 
anger, love, enmity, rage. Want is a desire arising from our 
not having something or other, and is, as it were, separated 
from the thing, but is still stretching, and attracted towards it 
_in vain. And hatred is a desire that it should be ill with some 
one, accompanied with a certain continual increase and exten- 
sion. Contentiousness is a certain desire accompanied with 
deliberate choice. Anger is a desire of revenge, on a person who 
appears to have injured one in an unbecoming way. Love is a 
desire not conversant about a virtuous object, for it is an at- 
tempt to conciliate affection, because of some beauty which is 
seen. Enmity isa certain anger of long duration, and full of 
hatred, and it is a watchful passion, as is shown in the following 
lines: —  
-P-A-G-E-110
  88 ZENO 
For though we deem the short-liv’d fury past, 
’T is sure the mighty will revenge at last.* 
But rage is anger at its commencement. 
Again, pleasure is an irrational elation of the mind over 
something which appears to be desirable; and its different 
species are enjoyment, rejoicing at evil, delight, and extrava- 
gant joy. Enjoyment, now, is a pleasure which charms the 
mind through the ears. Rejoicing at evil (émvyaipexanid), is a 
pleasure which arises at the misfortunes of others. Delight 
(répis) that is to say turning (tpéyus), is a certain turning of 
the soul (arpotpom7 tis yuxfs), to softness. Extravagant joy 
is the dissolution of virtue. And as there are said to be some 
sicknesses (4pfwornuarta) in the body, as, for instance, gout and 
arthritic disorders; so too are those diseases of the soul, such as 
a fondness for glory, or for pleasure, and other feelings of that 
sort. For an app@ornya is a disease accompanied with weak- 
ness; and a disease is an opinion of something which appears ex- 
ceedingly desirable. And, as in the case of the body, there are 
illnesses to which people are especially liable, such as colds or 
diarrhoea; so also are there propensities which the mind is under 
the influence of, such as enviousness, pitifulness, quarrelsome- 
ness, and so on. 
There are also three good dispositions of the mind; joy, 
caution, and will. And joy they say is the opposite of pleasure, 
since it is a rational elation of the mind; so caution is the oppo- 
site of fear, being a rational avoidance of anything, for the wise 
man will never be afraid, but he will act with caution; and will, 
they define as the opposite of desire, since it is a rational wish. 
As therefore some things fall under the class of the first per- 
turbations, in the same manner do some things fall under the ‘ 
class of the first good dispositions. And accordingly, under the 
head of will, are classed goodwill, placidity, salutation, affec- 
tion; and under the head of caution are ranged reverence and 
modesty; under the head of joy, we speak of delight, mirth, 
and good spirits.

From DIOGENES LAERTIUS’ LIVES AND 
OPINIONS OF EMINENT 
PHILOSOPHERS 
Translated from the Greek by 
CHARLES D. YONGE 
BOOK X. THE EPICUREAN PSYCHOLOGY 
XX. Now, in the Canon, Epicurus says that the criteria of 
truth are the senses, the preconceptions, and thepassions. But 
the Epicureans, in general, add also the perceptive impressions 
of the intellect. And he says the same thing in his Abridg- 
ment, which he addresses to Herodotus, and also in his Funda- 
mental Principles. For, says he, the senses are devoid of reason, 
nor are they capable of receiving any impressions of memory. 
For they are not by themselves the cause of any motion, and 
when they have received any impression from any external 
cause, then they can add nothing to it, nor can they subtract 
anything from it. Moreover, they are out of the reach of any 
control; for one sensation cannot judge of another which re- 
sembles itself; for they have all an equal value. Nor can one 
judge of another which is different from itself; since their ob- 
jects are not identical. In a word, one sensation cannot control 
another, since the effects of all of them influence us equally. 
Again, the reason cannot pronounce on the senses; for we have 
already said that all reasoning has the senses for its foundation. 
Reality and the evidence of sensation establish the certainty of 
the senses; for the impressions of sight and hearing are just as 
real, just as evident, as pain. 
It follows from these considerations that we ought to judge 
of things which are obscure by their analogy to those which  
-P-A-G-E-112
  90 EPICURUS 
we perceive directly. In fact, every notion proceeds from the 
senses, either directly, or in consequence of some analogy, or 
proportion, or combination. Reasoning having always a share 
in these last operations. The visions of insanity and of sleep 
have a real object, for they act upon us; and that which has no 
reality can produce no action. 
XXI. By preconception, the Epicureans mean a sort of 
comprehension as it were, or right opinion, or notion, or general 
idea which exists in us; or, in other words, the recollection of an 
external object often perceived anteriorly. Such for instance, is 
this idea: “Man is a being of such and such a nature.”’ At the 
same moment that we utter the word man, we conceive the fig- 
ure of a man, in virtue of a preconception which we owe to the 
preceding operations of the senses. Therefore, the first notion 
which each word awakens in us isacorrect one; in fact, we could 
not seek for anything if we had not previously some notion of 
it. To enable us to affirm that what we see at a distance is a 
horse or an ox, we must have some preconception in our 
minds which makes us acquainted with the form of a horse 
and an ox. We could not give names to things, if we had not 
a preliminary notion of what the things were. 
XXII. These preconceptions then furnish us with certainty. 
And with respect to judgments, their certainty depends on our 
referring them to some previous notion, of itself certain, in virtue 
of which we affirm such and such a judgment; for instance, 
“How do we know whether this thing is a man?” 
The Epicureans call opinion (8é£a) also supposition (iz0- 
Anis). And say that it is at times true, and at times false; for 
that, if it is supported by testimony, and not contradicted by 
testimony, then it is true; but if it is not supported by testi- 
mony, and is contradicted by testimony, then it is false. On 
which account they have introduced the expression of “ wait- 
ing,” as if, before pronouncing that a thing seen is a tower, we 
must wait till we come near, and learn what it looks like when 
we are near it. 
XXIII. They say that there are two passions, pleasure and 
pain, which affect everything alive. And that the one isnatural,  
-P-A-G-E-113
DIOGENES LAERTIUS’ LIVES gt 
and the other foreign to our nature; with reference to which all 
objects of choice and avoidance are judged of. They say also, 
that there are two kinds of investigation; the one about facts, 
the other about mere words. And this is as far as an element- 
ary sketch can go — their doctrine about division, and about 
the criterion. 
XXIV. Let us now go to the letter: — 
EPICURUS TO HERODOTUS, WISHING HE MAY DO WELL 
“MOREOVER, there are images resembling, as far as their 
form goes, the solid bodies which we see, but which differ mater- 
ially from them in the thinness of their substance. In fact it is 
not impossible but that there may be in space some secretions 
of this kind, and an aptitude to form surfaces without depth, and 
of an extreme thinness; or else that from the solids there may 
emanate some particles which preserve the connection, the dis- 
position, and the motion which they had in the body. I give 
the name of images to these representations; and, indeed, their 
movement through the vacuum taking place, without meeting 
any obstacle or hindrance, perfects all imaginable extent in an 
inconceivable moment of time; for it is the meeting of obsta- 
cles, or the absence of obstacles, which produces the rapidity 
or the slowness of their motion. At all events, a body in motion 
does not find itself, at any moment imaginable, in two places at 
the same time; that is quite inconceivable. From whatever 
point of infinity it arrives at some appreciable moment, and 
whatever may be the spot in its course in which we perceive its 
motion, it has evidently quitted that spot at the moment of our 
thought; for this motion which, as we have admitted up to this 
point, encounters no obstacle to its rapidity, is wholly in the 
same condition as that the rapidity of which is diminished by 
the shock of some resistance. 
“Tt is useful, also, to retain this principle, and to know that 
the images have an incomparable thinness; which fact indeed 
is in no respect contradicted by sensible appearances. From 
which it follows that their rapidity also is incomparable; for
-P-A-G-E-114
92 EPICURUS 
they find everywhere an easy passage, and besides, their infinite 
smallness causes them to experience no shock, or at all events 
to experience but a very slight one, while an infinite multitude 
of elements very soon encounter some resistance. 
“One must not forget that the production of images is simul- 
taneous with the thought; for from the surface of the bodies 
images of this kind are continually flowing off in an insensible 
manner indeed, because they are immediately replaced. They 
preserve for a long time the same disposition, and the same 
arrangement that the atoms do in the solid body, although, not- 
withstanding, their form may be sometimes altered. The direct 
production of images in space is equally instantaneous, because 
these images are only light substances destitute of depth. 
“But there are other manners in which natures of this kind 
are produced; for there is nothing in all this which at all contra- 
dicts the senses, if one only considers in what way the senses 
are exercised, and if one is inclined to explain the relation 
which is established between external objects and ourselves. 
Also, one must admit that something passes from external 
objects into us in order to produce in us sight and the knowledge 
of forms; for it is difficult to conceive that external objects can 
affect us through the medium of the air which is between us 
and them, or by means of rays, whatever emissions proceed 
from us to them, so as to give us an impression of their form and 
colour. This phenomenon, on the contrary, is perfectly ex- 
plained, if we admit that certain images of the same colour, of 
the same shape, and of a proportionate magnitude pass from 
these objects to us, and so arrive at being seen and compre- 
hended. These images are animated by an exceeding rapidity, 
and, as on the other side, the solid object forming a compact 
mags, and comprising a vast quantity of atoms, emits always 
the same quantity of particles, the vision is continued, and only 
produces in us one single perception which preserves always the 
same relation to the object. Every conception, every sensible 
perception which bears upon the form or the other attributes 
of these images, is only the same form of the solid perceived 
directly, either in virtue of a sort of actual and continued con-
-P-A-G-E-115
  DIOGENES LAERTIUS’ LIVES 93 
densation of the image, or in consequence of the traces which 
it has left in us. 
“Error and false judgments always depend upon the suppo- 
sition that a preconceived idea will be confirmed, or at all 
events will not be overturned, by evidence. Then, when it is 
not confirmed, we form our judgment in virtue of a sort of 
initiation of the thoughts connected, it is true with the per- 
ception, and with a direct representation; but still connected 
also with a conception peculiar to ourselves, which is the parent 
of error. In fact the representations which intelligence reflects 
like a mirror, whether one perceives them in a dream, or by any 
other conceptions of the intellect, or of any other of the criteria, 
can never resemble the objects that one calls real and true, un- 
less there were objects of this kind perceived directly. And, on 
the other side, error could not be possible, if we did not receive 
some other motion also, a sort of initiative of intelligence. con- 
nected; it is true with direct representation, but going beyond 
that representative. These conceptions being connected with 
the direct perception which produces the representation, but 
going beyond it, in consequence of a motion peculiar to the 
individual thought, produces error when it is not confirmed by 
evidence, or when it is contradicted by evidence; but when it is 
confirmed, or when it is not contradicted by evidence, then it 
produces truth. 
“We must carefully preserve these principles in order not to 
reject the authority of the faculties which perceive truth di- 
rectly; and not, on the other hand, to allow what is false to be 
established with equal firmness, so as to throw everything into 
confusion. 
“Let us now return to the study of the affections, and of the 
sensations; for this will be the best method of proving that the 
soul is a bodily substance composed of slight particles, diffused 
over all the members of the body, and presenting a great anal- 
ogy to a sort of spirit, having an admixture of heat, resembling 
at one time one, and at another time the other of those two 
principles. There exists in it a special part, endowed with an
-P-A-G-E-116
  04 EPICURUS 
extreme mobility, in consequence of the exceeding slightness of 
the elements which compose it, and also in reference to its 
more immediate sympathy with the rest of the body. That it is 
which the faculties of the soul sufficiently prove, and the pas- 
sions, and the mobility of its nature, and the thoughts, and, ina 
word, everything, the privation of which is death. We must 
admit that it is in the soul most especially that the principle 
of sensation resides. At the same time, it would not possess 
this power if it were not enveloped by the rest of the body which 
communicates it to it, and in its turn receives it from it; but 
only in a certain measure; for there are certain affections of the 
soul of which it is not capable. 
“Tt is on that account that, when the soul departs, the body 
is no longer possessed of sensation; for it has not this power, 
(that of sensation namely) in itself; but, on the other hand, 
this power can only manifest itself in the soul through the 
medium of the body. The soul, reflecting the manifestations 
which are accomplished in the substance which environs it, 
realises in itself, in a virtue or power which belongs to it, the 
sensible affections, and immediately communicates them to the 
body in virtue of the reciprocal bonds of sympathy which unite 
it to the body; that is the reason why the destruction of a part 
of the body does not draw after it a cessation of all feeling in 
the soul while it resides in the body, provided that the senses 
still preserve some energy; although, nevertheless, the disso- 
lution of the corporeal covering, or even of any one of its por- 
tions, may sometimes bring on with it the destruction of the 
soul. 
“The rest of the body, on the other hand, even when it re- 
mains, either as a whole, or in any part, loses all feeling by the 
dispersion of that aggregate of atoms, whatever it may be, that 
forms the soul. When the entire combination of the body is 
dissolved, then the soul too is dissolved, and ceases to retain 
those faculties which were previously inherent in it, and espe- 
cially the power of motion; so that sensation perishes equally 
as far as the soul is concerned; for it is impossible to imagine 
that it still feels, from the moment when it is no longer in the
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  DIOGENES LAERTIUS’ LIVES 95 
same conditions of existence, and no longer possesses the same 
movements of existence in reference to the same organic sys- 
tem; from the moment, in short, when the things which cover 
and surround it are no longer such, that it retains in them the 
same movements as before. 
(Epicurus expresses the same ideas in other works, and adds 
that the soul is composed of atoms of the most perfect light- 
ness and roundness; atoms wholly different from those of fire. 
He distinguishes in it the irrational part which is diffused over 
the whole body, from ‘the rational part which has its seat in 
the chest, as is proved by the emotions of fear and joy. He 
adds that sleep is produced when the parts of the soul diffused 
over the whole of the body concentre themselves, or when they 
disperse and escape by the pores of the body; for particles ema- 
nate from all bodies.) 
“Tt must also be observed, that I use the word incorporeal 
(ao@uaros) in the usual acceptation of the word, to express 
that which is in itself conceived as such. Now, nothing can 
be conceived in itself as incorporeal except the vacuum; but 
the vacuum cannot be either passive or active; it is only the 
condition and the place of movement. Accordingly, they who 
pretend that the soul is incorporeal, utter words destitute of 
sense; for, if it had this character, it would not be able either 
to do or to suffer anything; but, as it is, we see plainly enough 
that it is liable to both these circumstances. 
“Let us then apply all these reasonings to the affections and 
sensations, recollecting the ideas which we laid down at the 
beginning, and then we shall see clearly that these general 
principles contain an exact solution of all the particular cases. 
“ As to forms, and hues, and magnitudes, and weight, and the 
other qualities which one looks upon as attributes, whether it 
be of every body, or of those bodies only which are visible and 
perceived by the senses, this is the point of view under which 
they ought to be considered: they are not particular sub- 
stances, having a peculiar existence of their own, for that can- 
not be conceived; nor can one say any more that they have no 
reality at all. They are not incorporeal substances inherent in 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
96 EPICURUS 
the body, norare they parts of the body. But they constitute 
by their union the eternal substance and the essence of the en- 
tire body. We must not fancy, however, that the body is com- 
posed of them, as an aggregate is formed of particles of the 
smallest dimensions of atoms or magnitudes, whatever they 
may be, smaller than the compound body itself; they only con- 
stitute by their union, I repeat, the eternal substance of the 
body. Each of these attributes has ideas and particular per- 
ceptions which correspond toit; but they cannot be perceived 
independently of the whole subject taken entirely; the union 
of all these perceptions forms the idea of the body. Bodies often 
possess other attributes which are not eternally inherent in 
them, but which, nevertheless, cannot be ranged among the 
incorporeal and invisible things. Accordingly, it is sufficient to 
express the general idea of the movement of transference to en- 
able us to conceive in a moment certain distinct qualities, and 
those combined beings, which, being taken in their totality, 
receive the name of bodies; and the necessary and eternal at- 
tributes without which the body cannot be conceived. 
“There are certain conceptions corresponding to these attri- 
butes; but, nevertheless, they cannot be known abstractedly, 
and independently of some subjects; and further, inasmuch 
as they are not attributes necessarily inherent in the idea of a 
body, one can only conceive them in the moment in which 
they are visible; they are realities nevertheless; and one must 
not refuse to them an existence merely because they have 
neither the characteristic of the compound beings to which we 
give the name of bodies, nor that of the eternal attributes. We 
should be equally deceived if we were to suppose that they have 
a separate and independent existence; for that is true neither of 
them nor of the eternal attributes. They are, as one sees plainly, 
accidents of the body; accidents which do not of necessity make 
any part of its nature; which cannot be considered as indepen- 
dent substances, but still to each of which sensation gives the 
peculiar character under which it appears to us.”

BOOK III. THE MIND 
First then I say that the mind which we often call the un- 
derstanding, in which dwells the directing and governing prin- 
ciple of life, is no less part of the man, than hand and foot and 
eyes are parts of the whole living creature. [Some however 
affirm] that the sense of the mind does not dwell in a distinct 
part, but is a certain vital state of the body, which the Greeks 
call harmonia, because by it, they say, we live with sense, though 
the understanding is in no one part; just as when good health 
is said to belong to the body, though yet it is not any one part 
of the man in health. In this way they do not assign a distinct 
part to the sense of the mind; in all which they appear to me 
to be grievously at fault in more ways than one. Oftentimes the 
body which is visible to sight, is sick, while yet we have pleasure 
in another hidden part; and oftentimes the case is the very 
reverse, the man who is unhappy in mind feeling pleasure in his 
whole body; just as if, while a sick man’s foot is pained, the 
head meanwhile should be in no pain at all. Moreover when 
the limbs are consigned to soft sleep and the burdened body lies 
diffused without sense, there is yet a something else in us which 
during that time is moved in many ways and admits into it all

the motions of joy and unreal cares of the heart. Now that you 
may know that the soul as well is in the limbs and that the 
body is not wont to have sense by any harmony, this is a main 
proof: when much of the body has been taken away, still life 
often stays in the limbs; and yet the same life, when a few 
bodies of heat have been dispersed abroad and some air has 
been forced out through the mouth, abandons at once the veins 
and quits the bones: by this you may perceive that all bodies 
have not functions of like importance nor alike uphold exist- 
ence, but rather that those seeds which constitute wind and 
heat, cause life to stay in the limbs. Therefore vital heat and 
wind are within the body and abandon our frame at death. 
Since then the nature of the mind and that of the soul have been 
proved to be a part as it were of the man, surrender the name 
of harmony, whether brought down to musicians from high 
Helicon, or whether rather they have themselves taken it from 
something else and transferred it to that thing which then was 
in need of a distinctive name; whatever it be, let them keep it: 
do you take in the rest of my precepts. 
Now I assert that the mind and the soul are kept together 
in close union and make up a single nature, but that the direct- 
ing principle which we call mind and understanding, is the head 
so to speak and reigns paramount in the whole body. It has a 
fixed seat in the middle region of the breast: here throb fear and 
apprehension, about these spots dwell soothing joys; therefore 
here is the understanding or mind. All the rest of the soul dis- 
seminated through the whole body obeys and moves at the will 
and inclination of the mind. It by itself alone knows for itself, 
rejoices for itself, at times when the impression does not move 
either soul or body together with it. And as when some part 
of us, the head or the eye, suffers from an attack of pain, we do 
not feel the anguish at the same time over the whole body, thus 
the mind sometimes suffers pain by itself or is inspirited with 
joy, when all the rest of the soul throughout the limbs and 
frame is stirred by no novel sensation. But when the mind is 
excited by some more vehement apprehension, we see the whole 
soul feel in unison through all the limbs, sweats and paleness 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  
ON THE NATURE OF THINGS 99 
spread over the whole body, the tongue falter, the voice die 
away, a mist cover the eyes, the ears ring, the limbs sink un- 
der one; in short we often see men drop down from terror of 
mind; so that anybody may easily perceive from this that the 
soul is closely united with the mind, and, when it has been 
smitten by the influence of the mind, forthwith pushes and 
strikes the body. 
This same principle teaches that the nature of the mind and 
soul is bodily; for when it is seen to push the limbs, rouse the 
body from sleep, and alter the countenance and guide and turn 
about the whole man, and when we see that none of these 
effects can take place without touch nor touch without body, 
must we not admit that the mind and the soul are of a bodily 
nature? Again you perceive that our mind in our body suffers 
together with the body and feels in unison with it. When a 
weapon with a shudder-causing force has been driven in and has 
laid bare bones and sinews within the body, if it does not take 
life, yet there ensues a faintness and a lazy sinking to the 
ground and on the ground the turmoil of mind which arises, and 
sometimes a kind of undecided inclination to get up. Therefore 
the nature of the mind must be bodily, since it suffers from 
bodily weapons and blows. 
I will now go on to explain in my verses of what kind of body 
the mind consists and out of what it is formed. First of all Isay 
that it is extremely fine and formed of exceedingly minute 
bodies. That this is so you may, if you please to attend, clearly 
perceive from what follows: nothing that is seen takes place 
with a velocity equal to that of the mind when it starts some 
suggestion and actually sets it agoing; the mind therefore is 
stirred with greater rapidity than any of the things whose na- 
ture stands out visible to sight. But that which is so passing 
nimble, must consist of seeds exceedingly round and exceed- 
ingly minute, in order to be stirred and set in motion by a small 
moving power. Thus water is moved and heaves by ever so 
small a force, formed as it is of small particles apt to roll. But 
on the other hand the nature of honey is more sticky, its liquid 
more sluggish and its movement more dilatory; for the whole 
   
-P-A-G-E-122
  100 LUCRETIUS 
mass of matter coheres more closely, because sure enough it is 
made of bodies not so smooth, fine and round. A breeze how- 
ever gentle and light can force, as you may see, a high heap of 
poppy seed to be blown away from the top downwards; but on 
the other hand eurus itself cannot move a heap of stones. 
Therefore bodies possess a power of moving in proportion to 
their smallness and smoothness; and on the other hand the 
greater weight and roughness bodies prove to have, the more 
stable they are. Since then the nature of the mind has been 
found to be eminently easy to move, it must consist of bodies 
exceedingly small,smooth and round. The knowledge of which 
fact, my good friend, will on many accounts prove useful and 
be serviceable to you. The following fact too likewise demon- 
strates how fine the texture is of which its nature is composed, 
and how small the room is in which it can be contained, could it 
only be collected into one mass: soon as the untroubled sleep of 
death has gotten hold of a man and the nature of the mind and 
soul has withdrawn, you can perceive then no diminution of the 
entire body either in appearance or weight: death makes all 
good save the vital sense and heat. Therefore the whole soul 
must consist of very small seeds and be inwoven through veins 
and flesh and sinews; inasmuch as, after it has all withdrawn 
from the whole body, the exterior contour of the limbs preserves 
itself entire and not a tittle of the weight is lost. Just in the 
same way when the flavour of wine is gone or when the delicious 
aroma of a perfume has been dispersed into the air or when the 
savour has left some body, yet the thing itself does not there- 
fore look smaller to the eye, nor does aught seem to have been 
taken from the weight, because sure enough many minute seeds 
make up the savours and the odour in the whole body of the 
several things. Therefore, again and again I say, you are to 
know that the nature of the mind and the soul has been formed 
of exceedingly minute seeds, since at its departure it takes away 
none of the weight. 
We are not however to suppose that this nature is single. 
For a certain subtle spirit mixed with heat quits men at death, 
and then the heat draws air along with it; there being no heat
-P-A-G-E-123
ON THE NATURE OF THINGS 101 
which has not air too mixed with it: for since its nature is rare, 
many first-beginnings of air must move about through it. Thus 
the nature of the mind is proved to be threefold; and yet these 
things all together are not sufficient to produce sense; since the 
fact of the case does not admit that any of these can produce 
sense-giving motions and the thoughts which a man turns over 
in mind. Thus some fourth nature too must be added to these: 
it is altogether without name; than it nothing exists more nim- 
ble or more fine, or of smaller or smoother elements: it first 
transmits the sense-giving motions through the frame; for it is 
first stirred, made up as it is of small particles; next the heat 
and the unseen force of the spirit receive the motions, then the 
air; then all things are set in action, the blood is stirred, every 
part of the flesh is filled with sensation; last of all the feel- 
ing is transmitted to the bones and marrow, whether it be one 
of pleasure or an opposite excitement. No pain however can 
lightly pierce thus far nor any sharp malady make its way in, 
without all things being so thoroughly disordered that no room 
is left for life and the parts of the soul fly abroad through all 
the pores of the body. But commonly a stop is put to these 
motions on the surface as it were of the body: for this reason 
we are able to retain life. 
Now though I would fain explain in what way these are 
mixed up together, by what means united, when they exert 
their powers, the poverty of my native speech deters me sorely 
against my will: yet will I touch upon them and in summary 
fashion to the best of my ability: the first-beginnings by their 
mutual motions are interlaced in such a way that none of them 
can be separated by itself, nor can the function of any go on 
divided from the rest by any interval; but they are so to say the 
several powers of one body. Even so in any flesh of living crea- 
ture you please without exception there is smell and some 
colour and a savour, and yet out of all these is made up one 
single bulk of body. Thus the heat and the air and the unseen 
power of the spirit mixed together produce a single nature, to- 
gether with that nimble force which transmits to them from 
itself the origin of motion; by which means sense-giving motion
-P-A-G-E-124
  
102 LUCRETIUS 
first takes its rise through the fleshly frame. For this nature 
lurks secreted in its inmost depths, and nothing in our body 
is farther beneath all ken than it, and more than this it is the 
very soul of the whole soul. Just in the same way as the power 
of the mind and the function of the soul are latent in our limbs 
and throughout our body, because they are each formed of small 
and few bodies: even so, you are to know, this nameless power 
made of minute bodies is concealed and is moreover the very 
soul so to say of the whole soul, and reigns supreme in the whole 
body. On a like principle the spirit and air and heat must, as 
they exert their powers, be mixed up together through the 
frame, and one must ever be more out of view or more promi- 
nent than another, that a single substance may be seen to be 
formed from the union of all, lest the heat and spirit apart by 
themselves and the power of the air apart by itself should de- 
stroy sense and dissipate it by their disunion. Thus the mind 
possesses that heat which it displays when it boils up in anger 
and fire flashes from the keen eyes; there is too much cold spirit 
comrade of fear, which spreads a shivering over the limbs and 
stirs the whole frame; yes and there is also that condition of 
still air which has place when the breast is calm and the looks 
cheerful. But they have more of the hot whose keen heart and 
passionate mind lightly boil up in anger. Foremost in this class 
comes the fierce violence of lions who often as they chafe break 
their hearts with their roaring and cannot contain within their 
breast the billows of their rage. Then the chilly mind of stags 
is fuller of the spirit and more quickly rouses through all the 
flesh its icy currents which cause a shivering motion to pass over 
the limbs. But the nature of oxen has its life rather from the still 
air, and never does the smoky torch of anger applied to it stimu- 
late it too much, shedding over it the shadow of murky gloom, 
nor is it transfixed and stiffened by the icy shafts of fear: it lies 
between the other two, stags and cruel lions. And thus it is with 
mankind: however much teaching renders some equally refined, 
it yet leaves behind those earliest traces of the nature of each 
mind; and we are not to suppose that evil habits can be so thor- 
oughly plucked up by the roots, that one man shall not be more
-P-A-G-E-125
  ON THE NATURE OF THINGS 103 
prone than another to keen anger, a second shall not be some- 
what more quickly assailed by fear, a third shall not take some 
things more meekly than is right. In many other points there 
must be differences between the varied natures of men and the 
tempers which follow upon these; though at present I am unable 
to set forth the hidden causes of these or to find names enough 
for the different shapes which belong to the first-beginnings, 
from which shapes arises this diversity of things. What herein 
I think I may affirm is this: traces of the different natures left 
behind, which reason is unable to expel from us, are so exceed- 
ingly slight that there is nothing to hinder us from living a life 
worthy of gods. 
Well this nature is contained by the whole body and is in 
turn the body’s guardian and the cause of its existence; for the 
two adhere together with common roots and cannot it is plain 
be riven asunder without destruction. Even as it is not easy to 
pluck the perfume out of lumps of frankincense without quite 
destroying its nature as well; so it is not easy to withdraw from 
the whole body the nature of the mind and soul without dis- 
solving all alike. With first-beginnings so interlaced from their 
earliest birth are they formed and gifted with a life of joint 
partnership, and it is plain that the faculty of the body and of 
the mind cannot feel separately, each alone without the other’s 
power, but sense is kindled throughout our flesh and blown into 
flame between the two by the joint motions on the part of both. 
Moreover the body by itself is never either begotten or grows 
or, it is plain, continues to exist after death. For not in the way 
that the liquid of water often loses the heat which has been 
given to it, yet is not for that reason itself riven in pieces, but 
remains unimpaired, — not in this way, I say, can the aban- 
doned frame endure the separation of the soul, but riven in 
pieces it utterly perishes and rots away. Thus the mutual con- 
nexions of body and soul from the first moment of their exist- 
ence learn the vital motions even while hid in the body and 
womb of the mother, so that no separation can take place with- 
out mischief and ruin. Thus you may see that, since the cause 
of existence lies in their joint action, their nature too must be 
a joint nature. 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  104 LUCRETIUS 
Furthermore if any one tries to disprove that the body feels 
and believes that the soul mixed through the whole body takes 
upon. it this motion which we name sense, he combats even 
manifest and undoubted facts. For who will ever bring for- 
ward any explanation of what the body’s feeling is, except that 
which the plain fact of the case has itself given and taught to 
us? But when the soul it is said has departed, the body through- 
out is without sense; yes, for it loses what was not its own pecul- 
iar property in life; ay and much else it loses, before that soul 
is driven out of it. 
Again to say that the eyes can see no object, but that the 
soul discerns through them as through an open door, is far from 
easy, since their sense contradicts this; for this sense e’en draws 
it and forces it out to the pupil: nay often we are unable to per- 
ceive shining things, because our eyes are embarrassed by the 
lights. But this is not the case with doors; for, because we our- 
selves see, the open doors do not therefore undergo any fatigue. 
Again if our eyes are in the place of doors, in that case when the 
eyes are removed the mind ought it would seem to have more 
power of seeing things, after doors, jambs and all, have been 
taken out of the way. 
And herein you must by no means adopt the opinion which 
the revered judgment of the worthy man Democritus lays down, 
that the first-beginnings of body and mind placed together in 
successive layers come in alternate order and so weave the tis- 
sue of our limbs. For not only are the elements of the soul 
much smaller than those of which our body and flesh are 
formed, but they are also much fewer in number and are dis- 
seminated merely in scanty number through the frame, so that 
you can warrant no more than this: the first-beginnings of the 
soul keep spaces between them at least as great as are the small- 
est bodies which, if thrown upon it, are first able to excite in our 
body the sense-giving motions. Thus at times we do not feel 
the adhesion of dust when it settles on our body, nor the 
impact of chalk when it rests on our limbs, nor do we feel a mist 
at night nor a spider’s slender threads as they come against us, 
when we are caught in its meshes in moving along, nor the same
-P-A-G-E-127
  ON THE NATURE OF THINGS 105 
insect’s flimsy web when it has fallen on our head, nor the 
feathers of birds and down of plants as it flies about, which 
commonly from exceeding lightness does not lightly fall, nor do 
we feel the tread of every creeping creature whatsoever nor 
each particular foot-print which gnats and the like stamp on our 
body. So very many first-beginnings must be stirred in us, 
before the seeds of the soul mixed up in our bodies feel that 
these have been disturbed, and by thumping with such spaces 
between can clash unite and in turn recoil. 
The mind has more to do with holding the fastnesses of life 
and has more sovereign sway over it than the power of the soul. 
For without the understanding and the mind no part of thesoul 
can maintain itself in the frame the smallest fraction of time, 
but follows at once in the other’s train and passes away into the 
air and leaves the cold limbs in the chill of death. But he abides 
in life whose mind and understanding continue to stay with him: 
though the trunk is mangled with its limbs shorn all round 
about it, after the soul has been taken away on all sides and 
been severed from the limbs the trunk yet lives and inhales the 
ethereal airs of life. When robbed, if not of the whole, yet of a 
large portion of the soul, it still lingers in and cleaves to life; just 
as, after the eye has been lacerated all round if the pupil has 
continued uninjured, the living power of sight remains, provided 
always you do not destroy the whole ball of the eye and pare 
close round the pupil and leave only it; for that will not be done 
even to the ball without the entire destruction of the eye. But 
if that middle portion of the eye, small as it is, is eaten into, the 
sight is gone at once and darkness ensues, though a man have 
the bright ball quite unimpaired. On such terms of union soul: 
and mind are ever bound to each other.

VII. THE SOUL 
(qv. vm) 
I. WHETHER each [part] of us is immortal, or the whole 
perishes, or one part of us is dissipated and corrupted, but an- 
other part perpetually remains, which part is the man himself, 
may be learned by considering conformably to nature as fol- 
lows: Man, indeed, is not something simple, but there is in him 
asoul, and he has also a body, whether it is annexed to us asan 
instrument, or after some other manner. However this may be, 
it must be admitted, that the nature and essence of each of 
these must be thus divided. Since the body, therefore, is itself a 
composite, reason shows that it cannot remain [perpetually the 
same]. The senses likewise perceive that it is dissolved and 
wastes away, and receives destructions of every sort; since each 
of the things inherent in it tends to its own proper nature, and 
one thing belonging to it corrupts another, and changes and 
perishes into something else. This, too, is especially the case 
when the soul, which causes the parts to be in friendly union 
with each other, is not present with the corporeal mass. If each 
body, likewise, is left by itself, it will not be one, since it is cap- 
able of being dissolved into form and matter, from which it is 
also necessary that simple bodies should have their composi- 
tion. Moreover, as bodies they have magnitude, and conse- 
quently may be cut and broken into the smallest parts, and

of Plotinus, translated by Thomas Taylor, London, 1817; ib., 1895.
-P-A-G-E-129
  ENNEADES 107 
for this reason are subject to corruption. Hence, if body is a 
part of us, we are not wholly immortal. But if it is an instru- 
ment [of the soul] it is necessary that being given for a certain 
time, it should be naturally a thing of this kind. That, however, 
which is the most principal thing, and the man himself, will be 
that with reference to the body which form is with reference to 
matter, since this according to form is as body to matter, 
or according to that which uses, the body has the relation to it 
ofaninstrument. But in either case the soul is the man himself. 
II. What, therefore, is the nature of the soul? If indeed it is a 
body, it is in every respect capable of being analyzed. For 
every bodyisacomposite. But if it isnot a body, but of another 
nature, that also must be considered, either after the same, or 
after another manner. In the first place, [if the soul be corpo- 
real], it must be considered into what this body which they call 
soul ought to be analyzed. For since life is necessarily present 
with soul, it is also necessary that this body which is supposed 
to be soul, if it consists of two or more bodies, should have life 
innate in both, or in each of them; or that one of these should’ 
have life, but the other not, or that neither should be vital. If, 
therefore, life is present with one of them only, this very thing 
will be soul. Hence, what body will this be which has life from 
itself? For fire, air, water and earth, are of themselves inani- 
mate; and with whichever of these soul is present, the life 
which it uses is adventitious. There are not, however, any’ 
other bodies besides these. And those to whom it appears that 
there are other bodies which are the elements of these, do not 
assert that they are souls, or that they have life. 
But if it should be said, that though no one of these bodies 
possesses life, yet the conjunction of them produces life, one 
would speak absurdly. And if each of them has life, one will be 
sufficient. Or rather, it is impossible that a combination of 
bodies should produce life, and things void of intellect generate 
intellect. Moreover, neither will these, in whatever manner 
they may say they are mixed, generate either intellect or soul. 
Hence, it is necessary there should be that which arranges, and 
which is the cause of the mixture; so that this will have the
-P-A-G-E-130
  108 PLOTINUS 
order of soul. For that which is compounded: cannot be that 
which arranges and produces the mixture. But neither can 
there bea simple body in the series of things, without the exist- 
ence of soul in the universe; if reason [or a productive principle] 
entering into matter, produces body. For reason cannot pro- 
ceed from any thing else than from soul. 
III. . . . Indeed, neither will there be any body, if there is 
no psychical power. For body [perpetually] flows, and its na- 
ture is in [continual] motion. The universe would rapidly perish 
if all things were bodies; though some one of them should be 
denominated “‘soul.”” For it would suffer the same things as 
other bodies, since there would be one matter in all of them. 
Or rather, nothing would be generated, but all things would 
remain mere matter, as there would not be any thing to invest 
it with form. Perhaps, too, neither would matter have any sub- 
sistence whatever. This universe also would be dissolved, if it 
is committed to the connexion of body, and the order of soul is 
given to body, as far as the name went, ascribing it to air and 
dissoluble spirits, which have not of themselves any unity. For 
how is it possible, since all bodies are divisible, that this uni- 
verse if itis committed to any one of them, should not be borne 
along ina foolish and casual manner? What order is there, or 
reason or intellect, in a pneumatic substance, which is in want 
of order from soul? But if soul, indeed, has a subsistence, all 
these will be subservient to it in the composition of the world, 
and in the existence of every animal, in that one power arising 
from another contributes to [the perfection of] the whole. If 
soul, however, is not present to the whole of things, these 
will neither have a subsistence, nor any arrangement. 
VI. But that if soul is body, there would be no sensation, nor 
thought, nor undertaking, nor virtue, nor any thing beautiful [in 
human conduct,] will be manifest from the following considera- 
tions. Whatever is able to have a sensible perception of any 
thing, ought itself to be one, and to apprehend every thing by 
one and the same power. This will also be the case, if many 
things enter through many organs of sense, or there are many 
qualities about one thing, and likewise when there is a varie-
-P-A-G-E-131
  
ENNEADES 109 
gated appearance such as that of the face, through one thing. 
For one thing does not perceive the nose, and another the eyes, 
but the same thing perceives at once all the parts of the face. 
And though one sensation proceeds through the eyes, but an- 
other through the ears, yet it is necessary there should be some 
one thing at which both arrive. Or how could the soul say that 
these are different, unless the perceptions of sense at once ter- 
minated in the same thing? It is necessary, therefore, that this 
should be as it were a centre, that the senses should on all sides 
be extended to this, like lines from the circumference of a circle, 
and that a thing of this kind which apprehends the perceptions 
of sense should be truly one. . . . 
VII. The same thing also may be seen from pain and the 
sensation of pain; when a man is said to have a pain in or about 
his finger. For then it is manifest that the sensation of pain is 
produced in the principal or ruling part. A portion of the spirit 
being pained, the ruling part hasa perception of the pain, and the 
whole soul in consequence of this suffers the same pain. How, 
therefore, does this happen? They will say by transmission, 
the psychical spirit about the finger suffering in the first place, 
but imparting the passion to that which is next to it, and after- 
wards to something else, until the passion arrives at the ruling 
part. Hence, it is necessary if that which is primarily pained 
perceives, that there should be another sensation of that which 
is second, provided sensation is produced by transmission. Like- 
wise, it is necessary that there should be another sensation of 
that which is the third in order; that there should be many and 
infinite sensible perceptions of one and the same pain; and that 
afterwards all these should be perceived by the ruling part, and 
besides these, that it should have a perception of its own passion. 
In reality, however, each of these does not perceive the pain 
that is in the finger; but one sensation perceives that the part 
of the palm of the hand which is next to the finger is pained, 
and another more remote sensation perceives the pain which is 
in a more remote part. 
There will also be many pains, the ruling faculty not perceiv- 
ing the passion which is in the finger, but that which is present
-P-A-G-E-132
  110 PLOTINUS 
with itself. And thisit will alone know, but will bid farewell to 
the others, not perceiving that the finger is pained. It, therefore, 
is not possible that sensible perception of a thing of this kind 
should subsist according to transmission. Nor can any one part 
of the body — which is an extended mass—be aware of another’s 
suffering, since in every magnitude the parts are distinct. If this 
be the case, it is necessary that the perceiving faculty should be 
of such a nature, as to be every where identical with itself. But 
this pertains to any thing else rather than to body. 
VIII. Moreover, that it would be impossible to perceive 
intellectually if the soul is body, may be demonstrated as fol- 
lows. For if to perceive sensibly is, for the soul using the body 
to apprehend sensible objects, intellectual perception will not 
be an apprehension of the objects of such perception, through 
body. For unless this is admitted, intellectual will be the same 
with sensible perception. Hence, if to perceive intellectually is 
to apprehend without body, by a much greater priority it is 
necessary that the nature which thus perceives should not be 
body. Farther still, if sense indeed is the perception of sensible 
objects, intellection is the perception of intelligible objects. If, 
however, they are not willing to admit this, yet there must be 
in us thoughts of certain intelligible objects, and apprehensions 
of things without magnitude. How, therefore, will intellect if it 
is magnitude, understand that which is not magnitude, and 
with its divisible nature, think that which is indivisible? Shall 
we say it will understand it by a certain indivisible part of itself? 
But if this be the case, that which understands will not be body. 
For there is no need of the whole in order to come into contact 
with the object of its thought; since contact of a single part is 
sufficient. 
If, therefore, they admit that the most abstract thoughts 
are entirely liberated from body, it is necessary that the nature 
which intellectually perceives the form separate from body of 
each thing, should know either real being, or that which is be- 
coming pure. But if they say that thoughts are of forms in- 
herent in matter, yet they are then only apprehended when by 
intellect they are separated from body. For the separation [#.e. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
ENNEADES III 
abstraction] of a circle and triangle, of a line and a point, is not 
effected in conjunction with flesh, or in short, with matter. 
Hence it is necessary that the soul also, in a separation of this 
kind, should separate itself from the body. And therefore it is 
necessary that it should not be itself body. I think, likewise, 
that the beautiful and the just are without magnitude, and 
consequently the thought of these is unattended with magni- 
stude. Hence, these approaching to us are apprehended by that 
which is indivisible in the soul, and in the soul they reside in the 
indivisible. How also, if the soul is body, can temperance and 
justice be the virtues of it, which are its saviours, so far as they 
are received by it? 
IX. There must, therefore, be another nature which pos- 
sesses existence from itself, and such is every thing which is 
truly being, and which is neither generated, nor destroyed. For 
without the subsistence of this, all things would vanish into 
non-entity, and this perishing, would not afterwards be gener- 
ated; since this imparts safety to all other things, and also to 
the universe which through soul is preserved and adorned. For 
soul is the principle of motion, with which it supplies other 
things, itself moving itself, and imparting life to the animated 
body. But it possesses life from itself, which it will never lose, 
because it is derived from itself. For all things do not use an 
adventitious life, or there would be a progression of life to 
infinity. But it is necessary there should be a certain nature 
primarily vital, which is also necessarily indestructible and 
immortal, as being the principle of life to other things. . . . 
X. That the soul, however, is allied to a more divine and 
eternal nature, is evident from its not being body as we have 
demonstrated, and also because it has neither figure nor colour. 
Moreover, this likewise may be shown from the following con- 
siderations. It is acknowledged by all of us, that every divine 
nature, and one which is truly being, enjoys an excellent and 
wise life. This, therefore, being admitted, it is necessary to 
consider in the next place, what is the nature of our soul. We 
must assume the soul, however, not as receiving in the body 
irrational desires and angers, and other passions, but as abolish- 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  112 PLOTINUS 
ing all these, and as much as possible having no communication 
with the body. For such a soul as this will clearly show that 
evils are an addition to the soul, and are externally derived; 
and that the most excellent things are inherent in it when it is 
purified, viz. wisdom and every other virtue, which are its 
proper possessions. 
If, therefore, the soul is such when it returns to itself, how is 
it possible it should not belong to that nature which we say is 
possessed by every thing eternal and divine? For wisdom and 
true virtue being divine, cannot be inherent in any vile and 
mortal thing; but that which is of this kind is necessarily divine, 
as being full of divine goods, through an alliance and similitude 
of essence to a divine nature. Hence, whoever of us resembles a 
soul of this description, will in soul itself differ but little from 
superior beings; in this alone being inferior to them, that he is 
in body. On which account, also, if every man was such, or if 
the multitude employed souls of this kind, no one would be so 
incredulous as not to believe that our soul is entirely immortal. 
XII. Farther still, if they say that every soul is corruptible, 
it would be requisite that all things should have long since per- 
ished. But if they assert that one soul is corruptible, and an- 
other not, as for instance, that the soul of the universe is im- 
mortal, but ours not, it is necessary that they should assign the 
cause of this difference. For each is the cause of motion, and each 
lives from itself. Each, likewise, comes into contact with the 
same things by the same power, intellectually perceiving the 
natures in the heavens, and also those that are beyond the heav- 
ens, investigating everything which has an essential subsist- 
ence, and ascending as far as to the first principle of things. To 
which may be added, that it is evident the soul gave being to 
itself prior to the body, from its ability of apprehending what 
each thing is, by itself, from its own inherent spectacles, and 
from reminiscence. And from its employing eternal sciences, 
it is manifest that it is itself perpetual. 
Besides, since everything which can be dissolved receives 
composition, hence, so far as a thing is a composite, it is natur- 
ally adapted to be dissolved. But soul being one simple energy,  
-P-A-G-E-135
  ENNEADES 113 
and a nature characterized by life, cannot be corrupted as a 
composite. Will it, therefore, through being divided and dis- 
tributed into minute parts, perish? Soul, however, is not, as 
we have demonstrated, a certain bulk or quantity. May it not, 
therefore, through being changed in quality, be corrupted? 
Change in quality however which corrupts takes away form, 
but leaves the subject matter. But this is the nature of a com- 
posite. Hence, if it is not possible for the soul to be corrupted 
according to any of these modes, it is necessarily incorruptible. 
Vit. THE INTELLECT 
Wit) 
III. Hence, as the soul is so honourable and divine a thing, 
now confiding in a cause of this kind, ascend with it to divinity. 
For you will not be very distant from him; nor are the intermed- 
iate natures many. In this, therefore, which is divine, receive 
that part which is more divine, viz. the vicinity of the soul to 
that which is supernal, to which the soul is posterior, and from 
which it proceeds. For though it is so great a thing as we have 
demonstrated it to be, yet it is a certain image of intellect. And, 
just as external discourse is an image of the discursive energy 
within the soul, after the same manner, soul, and the whole of 
its energy, are the thought of intellect, and a life which it emits 
in order to the hypostasis of another thing. It is just as in fire, 
where the inherent heat of it is one thing, and the heat which it 
imparts another. It is necessary, however, to assume there, not 
a life flowing forth, but partly abiding in intellect, and partly 
giving subsistence to another life. Hence, since soul is derived 
from intellect, it is intellectual, and the intellect of soul is con- 
versant with discursive energies. 
Again, the perfection of soul is from intellect, as from a father 
that nourishes it, who generated soul, as with reference to him- 
self, not perfect. This hypostasis, therefore, is from intellect, 
and is also reason in energy when it perceives intellect. For 
when it looks to intellect, it possesses internally, and appro- 
priately, the things which it understands, and the energies which 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  114 PLOTINUS 
it performs. And it is necessary to call those energies alone the 
energies of the soul, which are intellectual and dwell with it. 
But its subordinate energies have an external source, and are 
the passions of a soul of this kind. 
Intellect, therefore, causes the soul to be more divine, both 
because it is the father of it, and because it is present with it. 
For there is nothing between them, except the difference of one 
with reference to the other; soul being successive to, and the 
recipient of intellect, but intellect subsisting as form. The mat- 
ter also of intellect is beautiful, since it has the form of intellect, 
and is simple. The great excellence, however, of intellect, is 
manifest from this, that though soul is such as we have de- 
scribed it to be, yet it is surpassed by intellect. 
TX. 
(v. XE.) 
IV. Why, therefore, is it necessary to ascend to soul, and yet 
not admit that it is the first of things? Is it not because in the 
first place, indeed, intellect is different from, and more excellent 
than soul? But that which is more excellent is prior by nature. 
For soul when perfect, does not, as some fancy it does, generate 
intellect. For whence will that which is in capacity become in 
energy, unless there is a cause which leads into energy? Since 
if it becomes in energy casually, it is possible that it may not 
proceed into energy. Hence, it is necessary that first natures 
should be established in energy, and that they should be want- 
ing nothing and perfect. But imperfect natures are posterior to 
them. The progeny also of imperfect, are perfected by first 
natures, who after the manner of fathers give perfection to 
what posterior natures generated imperfect from the beginning. 
That, likewise, which is generated, has at first the relation of 
matter to the maker of it, but is afterwards rendered perfect by 
the participation of form. But if it isnecessary that soul should 
be connected with passion, and if it is likewise necessary that 
there should be something impassive, or all things would perish 
in time; it is necessary that there should be something prior to
-P-A-G-E-137
ENNEADES IIS 
soul. And, if soul is in the world, but it is necessary there should 
be something beyond the world, on this account also it is neces- 
sary that there should be something prior to soul. For if that 
which is in the world, is in body and matter, nothing would re- 
main the same [if that which is mundane only existed]. So that 
man, and all productive principles, would not be perpetual, nor 
always the same. Hence, that it is necessary intellect should be 
prior to soul, may beseen from these and many other arguments. 
V. It is necessary, however, to consider intellect truly so 
called neither as intellect in capacity, nor as proceeding from the 
privation to the possession of intellect. For if we do not, we 
must again investigate another intellect prior to this. But we 
must assume intellect in energy, and eternally. If such an intel- 
lect, however, has not adventitious thought, whatever it intel- 
lectually perceives, it perceives from itself. And whatever it 
possesses, it possesses from itself. But if it perceives intel- 
lectually by and from itself, it is itself that which it perceives. 
For if the essence of it were one thing, and the object of its per- 
ception another, its very essence would not be an intelligible 
object; and again, it would be intellect in capacity, but not 
in energy. Neither of these, therefore, must be separated 
from the other. With us, however, it is usual, from the things 
with which we are conversant, to separate in our een enoe 
intellect, and the objects of its perception. 
VI. Let, therefore, intellect be [real] beings, and possess all 
things in itself, not as in place but as itself, and as being one 
with them. But all things there subsist together, and neverthe- 
less are separated from one another. For the soul also which 
has many notions in itself simultaneously, possesses them with- 
out any confusion. Each also, when it is requisite, performs 
what pertains to it, without the co-operation of the rest. And 
each conception energizes with a purity unmingled with the 
other inward conceptions. Thus, therefore, and in a still greater 
degree, intellect is at once all things; and yet, not together, be- 
cause each real existence is a peculiar power. Every intellect, 
however, includes all things, in the same manner as genus 
comprehends species, and as a whole comprehends its parts.

CHAPTER IV. THE SOUL CREATED 
Arter settling the origin of the soul, its condition or state 
comes up next. For when we acknowledge that the soul orig- 
inates in the breath of God, it follows that we attribute a be- 
ginning to it. This Plato, indeed, refuses to assign to it, for he 
will have the soul to be unborn and unmade.’ We, however, 
from the very fact of its having had a beginning, as well as from 
the nature thereof, teach that it had both birth and creation. 
And when we ascribe both birth and creation to it, we have 
made no mistake: for being born, indeed, is one thing, and being 
made is another, — the former being the term which is best 
suited to living beings. When distinctions, however, have 
places and times of their own, they occasionally possess also 
reciprocity of application among themselves. Thus, the being 
made admits of being taken in the sense of being brought forth; ” 
inasmuch as everything which receives being or existence, in 
any way whatever, is in fact generated. For the maker may 
really be called the parent of the thing that is made: in this 
sense Plato also uses the phraseology. So far, therefore, as con-

cerns our belief in the souls being made or born, the opinion of 
the philosopher is overthrown by the authority of prophecy * 
even. 
CHAPTER V. THE SOUL'S CORPOREAL NATURE 
SUPPOSE one summons a Eubulus to his assistance, and a 
Critolaus, and a Zenocrates, and on this occasion Plato’s friend 
Aristotle. They may very possibly hold themselves ready for 
stripping the soul of its corporeity, unless they happen to see 
other philosophers opposed to them in their purpose — and 
this, too, in greater numbers — asserting for the soul a corpo- 
real nature. Now I am not referring merely to those who mould 
the soul out of manifest bodily substances, as Hipparchus and 
Heraclitus [do] out of fire; as Hippon and Thales [do] out of 
water; as Empedocles and Critias [do] out of blood; as Epicurus 
[does] out of atoms, since even atoms by their coherence form 
corporeal masses; as Critolaus and his Peripatetics [do] out of a 
certain indescribable quintessence,” if that may be called a body 
which rather includes and embraces bodily substances; — but I 
call on the Stoics also to help me, who, while declaring almost 
in our own terms that the soul is a spiritual essence (inasmuch 
as breath and spirit are in their nature very near akin to each 
other), will yet have no difficulty in persuading [us] that the 
soul is a corporeal substance. Indeed, Zeno, defining the soul 
to be aspirit generated with [the body], constructs his argu- 
ment in this way: That substance which by its departure 
causes the living being to die is a corporeal one. Now it is by 
the departure of the spirit, which is generated with [the body], 
that the living being dies; therefore the spirit which is gener- 
ated with [the body] is a corporeal substance. But this spirit 
which is generated with [the body] is the soul: it follows, then, 
that the soul is a corporeal substance. Cleanthes, too, will have 
it that family likeness passes from parents to their children not 
merely in bodily features, but in characteristics of the soul; as 
1 Or, “inspiration.” 
2 Ex quinta nescio qua substantia. Comp. Cicero’s Tuscul. i. 10.
-P-A-G-E-140
  118 TERTULLIANUS 
if it were out of a mirror of [a man’s] manners, and faculties, 
and affections, that bodily likeness and unlikeness are caught 
and reflected by the soul also. It is therefore as being corporeal 
that it is susceptible of likeness and unlikeness. Again, there is 
nothing in common between things corporeal and things in- 
corporeal as to their susceptibility. But the soul certainly sym- 
pathizes with the body, and shares in its pain, whenever it is 
injured by bruises, and wounds, and sores: the body, too, 
suffers with the soul, and is united with it (whenever it is 
afflicted with anxiety, distress, or love) in the loss of vigour 
which its companion sustains, whose shame and fear it testifies 
by its own blushes and paleness. The soul, therefore, is [proved 
to be] corporeal from this intercommunion of susceptibility. 
Chrysippus also joins hands in fellowship with Cleanthes, when 
he lays it down that it is not at all possible for things which are 
endued with body to be separated from things which have not 
body; because they have no such relation as mutual contact or 
coherence. Accordingly Lucretius says:? 
“Tangere enim et tangi nisi corpus nulla potest res.” 
“ For nothing but body is capable of touching or of being touched.” 
(Such severance, however, is quite natural between the soul 
and the body]; for when the body is deserted by the soul, it is 
overcome by death. The soul, therefore, is endued with a body; 
for if it were not corporeal, it could not desert the body. 
CHAPTER X. THE SOUL’S SIMPLICITY 
Ir is essential to a firm faith, to declare with Plato? that the 
soul is simple; in other words, uniform and uncompounded; 
simply, that is to say, in respect of its substance. Never mind 
men’s artificial views and theories, and away with the fabri- 
cations of heresy! Some maintain that there is within the soul a 
natural substance — the spirit — which is different from it: as 
if to have life — the function of the soul — were one thing; and 
1 De Nat. Rer. i. 305. 
? See his Phedo, p. 80; Timeus, § 12, p. 35 (Bekker, pp. 264, 265).  
-P-A-G-E-141
A TREATISE ON THE SOUL 119 
to emit breath — the alleged function of the spirit — were 
another thing. Now it is not in all animals that these two func- 
tions are found; for there are many which only live, but do not 
breathe, in that they do not possess the organs of respiration — 
lungs and windpipes. But of what use is it, in an examination 
of the soul of man, to borrow proofs from a gnat or an ant, 
when the great Creator in His divine arrangement has allotted 
to every animal organs of vitality suited to its own disposition 
and nature, so that we ought not to catch at any conjectures 
from comparisons of this sort? Man, indeed, although organ- 
ically furnished with lungs and windpipes, will not on that ac- 
count be proved to breathe by one process, and to live by an- 
other; nor can the ant, although defective in these organs, be 
on that account said to be without respiration, as if it lived and 
that was all... . 
You think it possible for a thing to live without breath; then 
why not suppose that a thing might breathe without lungs ? 
Pray, tell me, what is it to breathe? I suppose it means to 
emit breath from yourself. What is it not to live? I suppose it 
means not to emit breath from yourself. This is the answer 
which I should have to make, if “‘to breathe” is not the same 
thing as ‘“‘to live.” It must, however, be characteristic of a 
dead man not to respire: to respire, therefore, is the characteris- 
tic of a living man. But to respire is likewise the characteristic 
of a breathing man: therefore also to breathe is the character- 
istic of a living man. Now, if both one and the other could pos- 
sibly have been accomplished without the soul, to breathe: 
might not be a function of the soul, but merely to live. But. 
indeed to live is to breathe, and to breathe is to live. Therefore: 
this entire process, both of breathing and living, belongs to that: 
to which living belongs — that is, to the soul. Well, then, since 
you separate the spirit (or breath) and the soul, separate their” 
operations also. Let both of them accomplish some act apart: 
from one another — the soul apart, the spirit apart. Let the 
soul live without the spirit; let the spirit breathe without the 
1 Aliunde spirabit, aliunde vivet. “In the nature of man, life and breath are 
inseparable” (Bp. Kaye). 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  120 TERTULLIANUS 
soul. Let one of them quit men’s bodies, let the other remain; 
let death and life meet and agree. 
If indeed the soul and the spirit are two, they may be divided; 
and thus, by the separation of the one which departs from the 
one which remains, there would accrue the union and meeting 
together of lifeand of death. But such a union never will accrue: 
therefore they are not two, and they cannot be divided; but 
divided they might have been, if they had been [two]. Still 
two things may surely coalesce in growth. But the two in 
question never will coalesce, since to live is one thing, and to 
breathe is another. Substances are distinguished by their 
operations. How much firmer ground have you for believing 
that the soul and the spirit are but one, since you assign to 
them no difference; so that the soul is itself the spirit, respira- 
tion being the function of that of which life also is! But what 
if you insist on supposing that the day is one thing, and the 
light, which is incidental to the day, is another thing, whereas 
day is only the light itself? There must, of course, be also 
different kinds of light, as [appears] from the ministry of fires. 
So likewise will there be different sorts of spirits, according as 
they emanate from God or from the devil. Whenever, indeed, 
the question is about soul and spirit, the soul will be [under- 
stood to be] itself the spirit, just as the day is the light itself. 
For a thing is itself identical with that by means of which itself 
exists. 
CHAPTER XII. THE MIND AND SOUL 
In like manner the mind also, or animus, which the Greeks 
designate NOYS, is taken by us in no other sense than as 
indicating that faculty or apparatus which is inherent and 
implanted in the soul, and naturally proper to it, whereby it 
acts, whereby it acquires knowledge, and by the possession of 
which it is capable of a spontaneity of motion within itself, 
and of thus appearing to be impelled by the mind, as if it were 
another substance, as is maintained by those who determine 
the soul to be the moving principle of the universe 1 — the god 
1 Comp. The Apology, c. xlviii.; August. De Civ. Dei, xiii. 17.  
-P-A-G-E-143
  A TREATISE ON THE SOUL 121, 
of Socrates, Valentinus’ “only-begotten” of his father! Bythus, 
and his mother Sige. How confused is the opinion of Anaxa- 
goras! For, having imagined the mind to be the initiating 
principle of all things, and suspending on its axis the balance 
of the universe; affirming, moreover, that the mind is a simple 
principle, unmixed, and incapable of admixture, he mainly on 
this very consideration separates it from all amalgamation with 
the soul; and yet in another passage he actually incorporates 
it with the soul. This [inconsistency] Aristotle has also ob- 
served; but whether he meant his criticism to be constructive, 
and to fill up a system of his own, rather than destructive of the 
principles of others, I am hardly able to decide. As for himself, 
indeed, although he postpones his definition of the mind, yet he 
begins by mentioning, as one of the two natural constituents of 
the mind, that divine principle which he conjectures to be im- 
passible, or incapable of emotion, and thereby removes from 
all association with the soul. For whereas it is evident that the 
soul is susceptible of those emotions which it falls toit naturally 
to suffer, it must needs suffer either by the mind or with the 
mind. Now if the soul is by nature associated with the mind, 
it is impossible to draw the conclusion that the mind is im- 
passible; or again, if the soul suffers not either by the mind or 
with the mind, it cannot possibly have a natural association 
with the mind, with which it suffers nothing, and which suffers 
nothing itself. Moreover, if the soul suffers nothing by the 
mind and with the mind, it will experience no sensation, nor 
will it acquire any knowledge, nor will it undergo any emotion 
through the agency of the mind, as they maintain it will. For 
Aristotle makes even the senses passions, or states of emotion. 
And rightly too. For to exercise the senses is to suffer emotion, 
because to suffer is to feel. In like manner, to acquire know- 
ledge is to exercise the senses, and to undergo emotion is to 
exercise the senses; and the whole of this is a state of suffering. 
But we see that the soul experiences nothing of these things, in 
such a manner as that the mind also is not affected by the emo- 
tion, by which, indeed, and with which, all is effected. It fol- 
1 Comp. Adv. Valentin. vii.
-P-A-G-E-144
  
  122 TERTULLIANUS 
lows, therefore, that the mind is capable of admixture, in oppo- 
sition to Anaxagoras; and passible or susceptible of emotion, 
contrary to the opinion of Aristotle. 
Besides, if a separate condition between the soul and mind is 
to be admitted, so that they be two things in substance, then 
of one of them, emotion and sensation, and every sort of taste, 
and all action and motion, will be the characteristics; whilst of 
the other the natural condition will be calm, and repose, and 
stupor. There is therefore no alternative: either the mind must 
be useless and void, or the soul. But if these affections may cer- 
tainly be all of them ascribed to both, then in that case the two 
will be one and the same, and Democritus will carry his point 
when he suppresses all distinction between the two. The ques- 
tion will arise how two can be one — whether by the confusion 
of two substances, or by the disposition of one? We, however, 
affirm that the mind coalesces with the soul, — not indeed as 
being distinct from it in substance, but as being its natural 
function and agent. 
CHAPTER XVI. THE SOUL’S RATIONAL AND 
IRRATIONAL PARTS 
Tuat position of Plato’s is also quite in keeping with the 
faith, in which he divides the soul into two parts — the rational 
and the irrational. To this definition we take no exception, 
except that we would not ascribe this twofold distinction to the 
nature [of the soul]. It is the rational element which we must 
believe to be its natural condition, impressed upon it from its 
very first creation by its Author, who is Himself essentially 
rational. For how should that be other than rational, which 
God produced on His own prompting; nay more, which He 
expressly sent forth by His own afflatus or breath? The irra- 
tional element, however, we must understand to have accrued 
later, as having proceeded from the instigation of the serpent — 
the very achievement of [the first] transgression — which 
thenceforward became inherent in the soul, and grew with its 
growth, assuming the manner by this time of a natural develop- 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  A TREATISE ON THE SOUL 123 
ment, happening as it did immediately at the beginning of na- 
ture. But, inasmuch as the same Plato speaks of the rational 
element only as existing in the soul of God Himself, if we were 
to ascribe the irrational element likewise to the nature which 
our soul has received from God, then the irrational element will 
be equally derived from God, as being a natural production, 
because God is the author of nature. Now from the devil pro- 
ceeds the incentive to sin. All sin, however, is irrational: 
therefore the irrational proceeds from the devil, from whom sin 
proceeds; and it is extraneous to God, to whom also the irra- 
tional is an alien principle. The diversity, then, between these 
two elements arises from the difference of their authors. When, 
therefore, Plato reserves the rational element [of the soul] to 
God alone, and subdivides it into two departments — the 
irascible, which they call @vpixdy, and the concupiscible, which 
they designate by the term évOupnticdy (in such a way as to 
make the first common to us and lions, and the second shared 
between ourselves and flies, whilst the rational element is con- 
fined to us and God)... . 
CHAPTER XXII. RECAPITULATION 
HeErmMoGENEs has already heard from us what are the other 
natural faculties of the soul, as well as their vindication and 
proof; whence it may be seen that the soul is rather the offspring 
of God than of matter. The names of these faculties shall here 
be simply repeated, that they may not seem to be forgotten 
and passed out of sight. We have assigned, then, to the soul 
both that freedom of the will which we just now mentioned, 
and its dominion over the works of nature, and its occasional 
gift of divination, independently of that endowment of pro- 
phecy which accrues to it expressly from the grace of God. We 
shall therefore now quit this subject of the soul’s disposition, 
in order to set out fully in order its various qualities. The soul, 
then, we define to be sprung from the breath of God, immortal, 
possessing body, having form, simple in its substance, intelli- 
gent in its own nature, developing its powers in various ways,
-P-A-G-E-146
  124 TERTULLIANUS 
free in its determinations, subject to the changes of accident, 
in its faculties mutable, rational, supreme, endued with an in- 
stinct of presentiment, evolved out of one [archetypal soul]. 
It remains for us now to consider how it is developed out of this 
one original source; in other words, whence, and when, and how 
it is produced.

CHAPTER XII. THE LOCATION OF THE INTELLECT 
Dismiss therefore every idle fancy and foolish conjecture of 
those who confine the intellectual activity to particular loca- 
tions in the body. Some of them think the heart is the seat of 
the guiding principle of the soul; others of them say the mind 
dwells in the brain. And these views they seek to maintain 
upon certain superficial grounds of probability. Those who 
give precedence to the heart regard its location as a proof of 
their affirmation, inasmuch as it occupies to all appearance the 
central place of the entire body. For this reason any exercise 
of the will can easily be transmitted from the centre throughout 
the whole body, and can thus proceed into action. As addi- 
tional evidence they cite the emotions of pain and of anger in 
men, since these passions appear in a manner to bring every 
partintosympathy. The others, who attribute to the brain the 
faculty of thought, say that nature has constructed the brain 
as a citadel for the entire body, and the mind reigns therein like 
a king, with the organs of sense like messengers and armour- 
bearers standing guard about it. They assert as a convincing 
proof of their contention that with those who have suffered any 
lesion of the membrane of the brain an unbalancing and de- 
rangement of the faculty of thought commonly occurs, and

  126 GREGORY OF NYSSA 
that those whose brains are clogged by drunkenness lose all 
consciousness of what is fitting. 
Both parties who accept these views supplement their pre- 
sumptions concerning the ruling faculty of the soul by reasons 
more closely derived from nature. One party says that the 
activity of the intellect has a kinship with the igneous, be- 
cause both fire and the intellect are in constant motion. Since 
now they allow that heat has its source in the organ of the 
heart, they affirm that the activity of the mind is blended with 
the mobility of the heat, and as a consequence that the heart, 
which contains the heat, is the repository of the intellectual 
nature. The other party contend, on the contrary, that the 
membrane of the brain (as the skin-like cover enveloping the 
brain is called) is, as it were, the foundation and root of the 
organs of sense. Their warrant for the truth of this affirmation 
is because the activity of the perceptive faculty can never be 
located otherwise, than in this part where both the ear is at- 
tached and receives the sounds that fall upon it; where also the 
sight, inseparably connected with the base of the eyes, trans- 
mits the images that strike the pupils and makes an impression 
of them within; where also the different kinds of scent are dis- 
criminated through the sniffing of the organs of smell; and where 
also the sensation of taste is determined by the testing power of 
the membrane of the brain, which sends out certain fibrous 
runners bearing sensation, and proceeding through the verte- 
bre of the neck into the filterlike passage to the muscles there. 
I concede that the intellectual processes of the soul are often 
disturbed by overpowering diseases, that the natural activity 
of the understanding is blunted by a bodily cause, and that the 
heart is a source of bodily fire and becomes aroused to emo- 
tional impulses. I admit further also that the membrane of the 
brain serves as a foundation of the organs of sense, as those 
affirm who make such investigations, since it envelops the brain 
and is moistened there by the discharging vapour. I have 
learned this from those who have madeanatomical studies, and 
have no reason to doubt the truth of what is alleged. Never- 
, theless I derive therefrom no proof whatever, that the incorpo-
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE ENDOWMENT OF MAN 127 
real nature is confined by certain local barriers. We know, how- 
ever, that disturbances of the intellect do not originate from 
the mere clogging of the brain by drunkenness, but rather, as 
the physicians affirm, if the skin enveloping the sides be- 
comes diseased, the intellect likewise assumes a disordered con- 
dition. This disease they call phrenitis, since the name of that 
skin is phrenes. The theory of joint-sensation occasioned by 
a painin the heart is also mistaken. When not the heart in- 
deed but the orifice of the stomach is painfully irritated they 
ignorantly attribute the suffering to the heart. Those who 
have made a careful study of diseases explain this as due to 
the fact that in a painful condition of the whole body there 
occurs a closing of the ducts, and as a result everything hin- 
dered in evaporation is driven back into the depths of the . 
hollow parts of the body. In consequence, therefore, of the 
compression of the organs of respiration occasioned by the 
environment, a more powerful respiration takes place through 
the nature (i.e. of the body), as it seeks to remove the pressure 
for the purpose of the expansion of the contracted parts. This 
distress in breathing we regard as a symptom of pain, and call 
it sighing and groaning. But the pressure also that we imagine 
is felt in the region of the heart, is occasioned by unpleasant 
sensations not of the heart, but of the orifice of the stomach, 
and is due to the same cause, usually the contraction of the 
ducts, since indeed the gall-bladder as a result of the com- 
pression sends forth its sharp and smarting bile into the 
orifice of the stomach. An evidence of this is the yellow ap- 
pearance of persons suffering from such disease as jaundice, due 
to the powerful contraction of the gall, which causes its juice to 
flow into the veins. 
But the opposite emotion also, that of joy or laughter, affords 
our position still stronger support. If one is gladdened by a 
pleasant communication the ducts of the body will also be 
enlarged owing to the pleasure. Now in the case of pain the 
fine and invisible evaporations of the ducts are checked, and 
as the viscera within is bound in tighter position, the moist va- 
pour is forced to the head, and to the membrane of the brain.
-P-A-G-E-150
  128 GREGORY OF NYSSA 
This vapour being accumulated in the hollows of the brain is 
then pressed out through the ducts lying beneath to the eyes, 
where the contraction of the eyelashes segregates the moisture 
in the form of drops called tears. Likewise, on the other hand, 
it must be observed that if the ducts are enlarged beyond their 
accustomed size in consequence of the opposite affections, a 
quantity of air is drawn through them toward the depths, and 
is there again naturally expelled through the mouth, since the 
entire viscera, and especially it is said the liver, forcefully ejects 
this air by a convulsive and violent movement. Nature there- 
fore provides for the passage of this air through an enlargement 
of the aperture of the mouth by means of the pushing apart of 
the cheeks enclosing the air. This condition is termed laughter. 
Thus neither on account of the alleged reason can the intel- 
lectual faculty be attributed preferably to the liver; nor on 
account of the agitation of the blood of the heart in agreeable 
emotion can the location of the faculty of thought be sup- 
posed in the heart. These phenomena must therefore be re- 
ferred to some special organization of the body, and it must be 
believed that the mind through some inexplicable plan of 
blending is distributed in all parts of the body, relatively to their 
importance. 
If on the other hand one should oppose to us, that Holy 
Writ (Psalm vu, 6) attributes to the heart most important 
psychical activities, we cannot consent to such affirmation 
without a closer examination. For he who makes mention of 
the heart includes therewith the reins, saying God ‘who 
trieth the heart and reins,” so that one must apply the seat 
of thought to both, or to neither of the two. But though one 
proves to me that the powers of the intellect are blunted in 
certain conditions of the body, or are even forced completely 
into inaction, I do not consider this fact sufficient evidence, that 
the power of thought is limited to any one locality in such wise 
that it would be driven from its accustomed place of sojourn 
owing to inflammation befalling the parts. For it is a truth ap- 
plicable to all bodily things, that if a vessel is already occupied 
by anything which fills it, nothing else can find therein a place.
-P-A-G-E-151
THE ENDOWMENT OF MAN 129 
For the intellectual nature neither takes possession of the empty 
parts of the body, nor permits itself to be expelled by any 
superabundant flesh; but the entire body is similar in its organi- 
sation to a wind instrument, which a musician oftentimes 
knows how to play, but cannot show his knowledge because the 
uselessness of the instrument prevents the display of his art. 
Either it is unfit owing to age, or cracked from a fall, or 
unusable on account of rust or mould. As a result it is mute and 
ineffective, even if played upon by the most expert master of 
the pipes. Even so the mind pervades the entire organism, 
and acting in harmony with the powers of thought, as it 
naturally can, operates upon each one of the individual parts. 
In the case of those that are in their natural condition it pro- 
duces the customary effect, but in bodies which are too weak 
to receive the operation of its art, it remains inactive and 
inefficacious. For it is the peculiar quality of the mind that it 
maintains friendly relationship with that which is in its natural 
conditions, but is alienated from whatever has receded from 
nature. 
At this stage a principle suggests itself to me, which is based 
even more upon the natural inner consideration of things, and 
from which we can derive still higher precepts. For the divine 
nature is itself the most beautiful of all things that is pre- 
eminently good; and the essence towards which anything 
which possesses the desire for the beautiful is drawn. We, there- 
fore, affirm that the mind, precisely because it is created after 
the image of the most beautiful, canitself abide in the beautiful 
so long as it possesses the amount of similarity with its proto- 
type that it receives; and that on the contrary if it recedes in 
any measure from this resemblance, it is deprived of that 
beauty in which it was resident. But just as we said the mind 
possesses in itself beauty from similarity with its prototype, 
and like a mirror profits by the image of the form appearing in 
it; so in a similar manner we reason that nature also stands 
subject to the guidance and ruling of reason, and profits by its 
beauty and perfection. It is, as it were, a mirror of a mirror, and 
the material of our personality in which our nature is observed,  
-P-A-G-E-152
  
  130 GREGORY OF NYSSA 
is governed, and held together by reason. So long as the one 
cleaves to the other the community also of true beauty and 
perfection pervades in right relation all the parts, and transfers 
the lustre of divine grandeur to that connected with it. On the 
other hand, if a sundering of this incorporation with the good 
occurs, or if the higher appears in a subordinate relation to the 
lower, then also the unloveliness of the material abundance by 
nature reveals itself, (for matter is in itself something unformed 
and crude). Thus owing to this formlessness, that beauty of 
nature which adorns it through reason is also destroyed. 
Hence the unloveliness of matter passes over through nature 
to the mind itself, in such a manner that the image of God is 
seen no longer in the impression on the features. For the mind 
now receives the picture of the (divine) perfections as upon 
the back of the mirror, and although it reflects the rays of the 
splendour reflected from the good, it also rubs off the form- 
lessness of matter upon itself. Thus evil originates, the ex- 
istence of which commences with the deprivation of the good. 
But the beautiful is everything that stands in harmonious rela- 
tions with the original good; but everything that stands out- 
side of this relation, and of similarity with it, has no part in the 
beautiful. If now according to the reasoning we have 
observed there is only one original good, and if the mind in 
virtue of its creation in the image of the beautiful has itself 
beauty, and if the nature comprised by the mind is as it were 
an image of an image, then it is thereby proved that our 
material principle has persistence and continued support just 
as long as it is guided and kept in order by nature, but that it is 
committed to dissolution and decay if it forsakes that which 
gives it support and persistence, and is torn from its incorpora- 
tion with the beautiful. But this does take place precisely when 
there has been a reversion from nature towards the opposite. 
For there is every necessity that matter robbed of its own form 
must likewise suffer an alteration corresponding to this shape- 
lessness and unloveliness. 
This is nevertheless an incidental explanation which has 
developed from our discussion upon the principal topic at
-P-A-G-E-153
  THE ENDOWMENT OF MAN 131 
issue. The chief question was, whether the intellect has its 
location in one special part of us, or whether it pervades all 
parts alike. For the reasoning of those who circumscribe the 
mind with local parts, and cite as a proof of their assumption 
the fact that if the membrane of the brain is in an unnatural 
condition thought is impaired, has disclosed that the power of 
the soul is in every part of the human organism that is in a 
condition to receive its activity, and similarly becomes inactive 
so soon as any part loses its natural condition. For that reason 
there was necessarily involved in the argument, the proposal by 
which we learn that in the human organism the mind is regu- 
lated by God, and through that in turn the material life is 
guided so long as it remains in the service of nature, but that 
if it turns aside from nature it also loses the power of activity, 
derived from the mind. Thus we return again to our point of 
departure, to wit, that the mind exercises power in such parts 
of the body as have not lost their natural constitution as a 
result of disease, and remains effective if they continue in con- 
formity to nature, but on the contrary is powerless in those 
parts which are incapable of maintaining its activity.

BOOK X. CHAPTER X. THE NATURE OF MIND 
13. Lerit not then add anything to that which it knows 
itself to be, when it is bidden to know itself. For it knows, at 
any rate, that this is said to itself; namely, to itself, that is, and 
that lives, and that understands. But a dead body also is, and 
cattle live; but neither a dead body nor cattle understand. 
Therefore it so knows that it so is, and that it so lives, as an 
understanding is and lives. When, therefore, for example’s 
sake, the mind thinks itself air, it thinks that air understands; 
it knows, however, that itself understands, but it does not know 
itself to be air, but only thinks so. Let it separate that which 
it thinks itself; let it discern that which it knows; let this re- 
main to it, about which not even have they doubted who have 
thought the mind to be this corporeal thing or that. For cer- 
tainly every mind does not consider itself to be air; but some 
think themselves fire, others the brain, and some one kind of 
corporeal thing, others another, as I have mentioned before; 
yet all know that they themselves understand, and are, and 
live; but they refer understanding to that which they under- 
stand, but to be, and to live, to themselves. And no one doubts, 
either that no one understands who does not live, or that no one 
lives of whom it is not true that he is; and that therefore by 
consequence that which understands both is and lives; not as a

-P-A-G-E-155
  ON THE TRINITY 133 
dead body is which does not live, nor as a soul lives which does 
not understand, but in some proper and more excellent manner. 
Further, they know that they will, and they equally know that 
no one can will who is not and who does not live; and they also 
refer that will itself to something which they will with that will. 
They know also that they remember; and they know at the 
same time that nobody could remember, unless he both was and 
lived; but we refer memory itself also to something, in that we 
remember those things. Therefore the knowledge and science 
of many things are contained in two of these three, memory 
and understanding; but will must be present, that we may en- 
joy or use them. For we enjoy things known, in which things 
themselves the will finds delight for their own sake, and so re- 
poses; but we use those things, which we refer to some other 
thing which we are to enjoy. Neither is the life of man vicious 
and culpable in any other way, than as wrongly using and 
wrongly enjoying. But it is no place here to discuss this. 
14. But since we treat of the nature of the mind, let us 
remove from our consideration all knowledge which is received 
from without, through the senses of the body; and attend more 
carefully to the position which we have laid down, that all 
minds know and are certain concerning themselves. For men 
certainly have doubted whether the power of living, of remem- 
bering, of understanding, of willing, of thinking, of knowing, of 
judging, be of air, or of fire, or of the brain, or of the blood, or 
of atoms, or besides the usual four elements of a fifth kind of 
body, I know not what; or whether the combining or temper- 
ing together of this our flesh itself has power to accomplish 
these things. And one has attempted to establish this, and 
another to establish that. Yet who ever doubts that he him- 
self lives, and remembers, and understands, and wills, and 
thinks, and knows, and judges? Seeing that even if he doubts, 
he lives; if he doubts, he remembers why he doubts; if he 
doubts, he understands that he doubts; if he doubts, he wishes 
to be certain; if he doubts, he thinks; if he doubts, he knows 
that he does not know; if he doubts, he judges that he ought not 
to assent rashly. Whosoever therefore doubts about anything
-P-A-G-E-156
  134 SAINT AUGUSTINE 
else, ought not to doubt of all these things; which if they were 
not, he would not be able to doubt of anything. 
15. They who think the mind to be either a body or the 
combination or tempering of the body, will have all these things 
to seem to be in a subject, so that the substance is air, or fire, or 
some other corporeal thing, which they think to be the mind; 
but that the understanding is in this corporeal thing as its 
quality, so that this coporeal thing is the subject, but the 
understanding is in the subject, viz. that the mind is the sub- 
ject, which they rule to be a corporeal thing, but the under- 
standing, or any other of those things which we have mentioned 
as certain to us, is in that subject. They also hold nearly the 
same opinion who deny the mind itself to be body, but think it 
to be the combination or tempering together of the body; for 
there is this difference, that the former say that the mind itself 
is the substance, in which the understanding is, as in a subject; 
but the latter say that the mind itself is in a subject, viz. in the 
body, of which it is the combination or tempering together. 
And hence, by consequence, what else can they think, except 
that the understanding.also is in the same body as in a subject? 
16. And all these do not perceive that the mind knows itself, 
even when it seeks for itself, as we have already shown. But 
nothing is at all rightly said to be known while its substance is 
not known. And therefore, when the mind knows itself, it 
knows its own substance; and when it is certain about itself, 
it is certain about its own substance. But it is certain about. 
itself, as those things which are said above prove convincingly; 
although it is not at all certain whether itself is air, or fire, or 
some body, or some function of body. Therefore it is not any 
of these. And that whole which is bidden to know itself, belongs 
to this, that it is certain that it is not any of those things of 
which it is uncertain, and is certain that it is that only, which 
only it is certain that it is. For it thinks in this way of fire, 
or air, and whatever else of the body it thinks of. Neither 
can it in any way be brought to pass that it should so think 
that which itself is, as it thinks that which itself is not. Since 
it_thinks all these things through an imaginary phantasy,
-P-A-G-E-157
ON THE TRINITY 135 
whether fire, or air, or this or that body, or that part or com- 
bination and tempering together of the body: nor assuredly is 
it said to be all those things, but some one of them. But if 
it were any one of them, it would think this one in a different 
manner from the rest, viz. not through an imaginary phantasy, 
as absent things are thought, which either themselves or some of 
like kind have been touched by the bodily sense; but by some 
inward, not feigned, but true presence (for nothing is more 
present to it than itself); just as it thinks that itself lives, and 
remembers, and understands, and wills. For it knows these 
things in itself, and does not imagine them as though it had 
touched them by the sense outside itself, as corporeal things are 
touched. And if it attaches nothing to itself from the thought 
of these things, so as to think itself to be something of the kind, 
then whatsoever remains to it from itself, that alone is itself. 
CHAPTER XI. MEMORY, UNDERSTANDING, 
AND WILL 
17. Puttinc aside, then, for a little while all other things, of 
which the mind is certain concerning itself, let us especially 
consider and discuss these three — memory, understanding, 
will. For we may commonly discern in these three the charac- 
ter of the abilities of the young also; since the more tenaciously 
and easily a boy remembers, and the more acutely he under- 
stands, and the more ardently he studies, the more praise- 
worthy is he in point of ability. But when the question is about 
any one’s learning, then we ask not how solidly and easily he 
remembers, or how shrewdly he understands; but what it is 
that he remembers, and what it is that he understands. And 
because the mind is regarded as praiseworthy, not only as being 
learned, but also as being good, one gives heed not only to 
what he remembers and what he understands, but also to what 
he wishes; not how ardently he wishes, but first what it is he 
wishes, and then how greatly he wishes it. For the mind that 
loves eagerly is then to be praised, when it loves that which 
ought to be loved eagerly. Since, then, we speak of these three  
-P-A-G-E-158
  136 SAINT AUGUSTINE 
— ability, knowledge, use — the first of these is to be considered 
under the three heads, of what a man can do in memory, and 
understanding, and will. The second of them is to be consid- 
ered in regard to that which any one has in his memory and in 
his understanding, whither he has attained by a studious will. 
But the third, viz. use, lies in the will, which handles those 
things that are contained in the memory and understand’ng, 
whether it refer them to anything further, or rest satisfied with 
them as an end. For to use, is to take up something into the 
power of the will; and to enjoy, is to use with joy, not any longer 
of hope, but of the actual thing. Accordingly, every one who 
enjoys, uses; for he takes up something into the power of the 
will, wherein he also is satisfied as with an end. But not every 
one who uses, enjoys, if he has sought after that, which he takes 
up into the power of the will, not on account of the thing itself, 
but on account of something else. 
18. Since, then, these three, memory, understanding, will, 
are not three lives, but one life; nor three minds, but one mind; 
it follows certainly that neither are they three substances, but 
one substance. Since memory, which is called life, and mind, 
and substance, is so called in respect to itself; but it is calied 
memory, relatively to something. And I should say the same 
also of understanding and of will, since they are called under- 
standing and will relatively to something; but each in respect 
to itself is life, and mind, and essence. And hence these three 
are one, in that they are one life, one mind, one essence; and 
whatever else they are severally called in respect to themselves, 
they are called also together, not plurally, but in the singular 
number. But they are three, in that wherein they are mutually 
referred to each other; and if they were not equal, and this not 
only each to each, but also each to all, they certainly could not 
mutually contain each other; for not only is each contained by 
cach, but also all by each. For I remember that I have mem- 
ory, and understanding, and will; and I understand that I 
understand, and will, and remember; and I will that I will, and 
remember, and understand; and I remember together my whole 
memory, and understanding, and will. For that of my memory
-P-A-G-E-159
  ON THE TRINITY 137 
which I do not remember, is not in my memory; and nothing is 
so much in the memory as memory itself. Therefore I remem- 
ber the whole memory. Also, whatever I understand I know 
that I understand, and I know that I will whatever I will; but 
whatever I know I remember. Therefore I remember the whole 
of my understanding, and the whole of my will. Likewise, when 
I understand these three things, I understand them together as 
whole. For there is none of things intelligible which I do not 
understand, except what I do not know; but what I do not 
know, I neither remember, nor will. Therefore, whatever of 
things intelligible I do not understand, it follows also that I 
neither remember nor will. And whatever of things intelligibie 
I remember and will, it follows that I understand. My will also 
embraces my whole understanding and my whole memory, 
whilst I use the whole that I understand and remember. And, 
therefore, while all are mutually comprehended by each, and as 
wholes, each as a whole is equal to each as a whole, and each.as 
a whole at the same time to all as wholes; and these three are 
one, one life, one mind, one essence.

QUESTION LXXVI. RATIONALITY THE ESSENTIAL 
FORM IN MAN 
Article 3. Are there besides the Rational Soul in Man, other Souls 
different in Essence? 
(a) It would appear that beside the rational soul in man 
other souls essentially different exist, to wit, the sensitive and 
nutritive. 
I. For what is perishable does not belong to the same sub- 
stance as what is imperishable. But the rational soul is imper- 
ishable, whereas the other souls, that is, the nutritive and the 
sensitive, are perishable. It is not possible, therefore, that there 
is in man a single essence of a rational, sensitive, and nutritive 
soul. 
II. Ifit be said that the sensitive soul of man is imperishable 
there is opposed to such a view, the declaration of Aristotle 
(10 Metaph.), that what is perishable differs in kind from that 
which is imperishable. But the sensitive soul in the horse, 
lion, and other animals is perishable. If therefore it were 
imperishable in man, then the sensitive soul in man and brute 
would not be of the same kind. Nevertheless that is called 
animal which has a sensitive soul. Animal would therefore not 
be the common genus for man and the other animals. But this 
is incongruous.

III. Aristotle says “the embryo is first animal. and then 
man” (2 de Gener, c. 3). But this would not be possible if the 
sensitive soul had the same essence as the rational. For the 
animal ds thus designated because of its sensitive soul; and 
manis so called because of his rational soul. Consequently there 
is in man-no single essence composed of a sensitive and a ra- 
tional soul. 
IV. Aristotle says (8 Metaph.) “the genus of being is derived 
from the matter, but the difference from the essential form.” 
Now rationality which is the specific difference in man is 
derived from the rational soul; but the animal is so called 
because it has a body animated by a sensitive soul. The ra- 
tional soul, therefore, is related to the body animated by the 
sensitive soul, as form is to matter. The rational soul is not, 
therefore, identical in essence with the sensitive soul in man, 
but presupposes the latter as its substrate matter. 
But on the other hand itshould be said: we do not admit two 
souls in one and the same man, as Jacobus and the other Syri- 
ans affirm, to wit,an animal soul which animates the body, 
and is mixed with the blood, and a rational soul which ministers 
to the reason; but there is a single soul in man which animates 
the body by its presence, and orders by its own principle of 
reason”? (lib. de eccl. dogm. c. 15). 
(6) I reply that Plato postulated (Time@us) in one body dif- 
ferent souls, distinguished likewise by their organs, to which he 
attributed diverse vital functions, declaring that there is a 
nutritive faculty in the liver, an appetitive faculty in the heart, 
and a rational faculty in the brain. 
Aristotle refutes (2 de Anima, c. 2) this view so far as it con- 
cerns those powers of the soul which in their activities employ 
bodily organs. His reason is that in case of those animals which 
though cut in two still live, the different operations of the soul 
in any one part are still found, such as feeling and desire. But 
this would not be the case if diverse principles of psychical 
activities, differing essentially from one another, were ascribed 
to the different parts of the body. But with regard to the 
rational soul he appears to have left it an open question,
-P-A-G-E-162
  140 THOMAS AQUINAS 
whether it is separated from the other powers of the soul only 
by virtue of reason, or also in location. 
The opinion of Plato would indeed be justified, if one sup- 
posed the soul were united to the body not as form, but as 
moving principle, as Plato assumed. For in that case no- 
thing incongruous results, if the same mobile object be moved 
by different moving forces, especially in its different sub- 
ordinate parts. 
But if we assume that the soul is united to the body as its 
form, it is then wholly impossible that several souls, differing 
essentially from one another, should have existence in a single 
body. ‘This can be clearly shown in three ways. 
1. The animal would not have unity of being in which there 
were several souls. Nothing has simple unity, save through 
form alone, by which a thing has its being. For from the same 
form that a thing derives entity, it derives unity; and therefore 
what are designated by different forms are not singly one, as 
for instance a white man. If therefore man were a living being 
by virtue of some one form, that is the vegetative soul; animal 
by virtue of another form, the sensitive soul; and were a think- 
ing being by virtue of another form, the rational soul, he would 
not then be singly one. Thus Aristotle also argues (8 Metaph.), 
as against Plato, that if there were one idea of an animal, and 
another of a biped, there would be no single entity of a biped 
animal. Accordingly he asks (1 de Anima), in answer to those 
who assume different souls in the same body, what then holds 
together these diverse souls, that is, what makes a unity of 
them. It is not possible to say that they are made indeed into 
a unity through the body; for the soul contains the body and 
makes it to be one, rather than the reverse. 
2. This appears impossible by the mode of predication. For 
the attributes which embody different forms in the same thing 
are predicable of oneanother, eitheraccidentally, orreciprocally. 
If these forms have no relation to one another, as if one were to 
say that what is white may also be sweet, then the attribute 
does not depend on the substance itself, but arises from other 
causes, since it is not in the essence of white to be sweet. Or, if
-P-A-G-E-163
  
SUMMA THEOLOGICA 141 
the attributes are naturally related they will be predicated 
per se, according to the second definition of per se, because the 
subject then appears in the definition of the predicate. Thus I 
can say, the surface must precede the colour, if the surface of the 
body is coloured, for the existence of a surface must precede the 
concept of colour. Man is therefore owing to certain forms said 
to be ananimal, and to other forms a man. The affirmation‘man 
is an animal,’ therefore, must be either purely ‘accidental,’ 
or, one of the souls must precede the other. But the former 
statement is manifestly false, because animal is predicated of 
man per se, and not per accidens; and the latter is untrue, be- 
cause man is not contained in the definition of animal, but the 
reverse. It therefore follows, that there can only be one and the 
same form from which it results, both that man is animal, and 
that he is also man. If it were otherwise man would not be 
what is designated by animal, since the necessary attribute for 
animal would be predicated only accidentally of man. 
3. Again this appears impossible because of the fact, that one 
activity of the soul inhibits another, if it be very intense. This 
would by no means happen unless the principle of action in 
man were in essence one. It follows, therefore, that there is only 
one soul as to number in man, which must be deemed at the 
same time nutritive, sensitive, and rational. 
How this can happen may easily be understood by anyone 
who pays heed to the differences of species and of forms. For 
the forms and species of things differ from one another, in that 
one is more or less perfect than another. Thus plants are more 
perfect than inanimate objects; animals again rank above 
plants; and man in turn rises above the beasts. And among the 
individuals of the same class there are also varying degrees of 
perfection. For this reason Aristotle compares (8 Metaph.) the 
forms of species to numbers, which differ in type according as a 
unit is added or subtracted. And he compares (2 de Anima) the 
different souls to figures in which one contains another, and yet 
exceeds it. In like manner the rational soul contains within its 
powers, both what belongs to the sensitive soul of the brutes,and 
likewise to the nutritive soul of the plant. Thesurface, therefore,  
-P-A-G-E-164
  142 THOMAS AQUINAS 
which has the figure of a pentagon, also is not by one figure in it 
a square, and by another a pentagon; for in that case the square 
would be superfluous, since it is contained in the pentagon. 
Thus Socrates also is not by virtue of one soul a man, and by 
virtue of another an animal; but he is both, through one and the 
same soul. 
(c) I. The sensitive soul is imperishable, not because of its 
sensitive nature, but because it possesses rationality. If the soul 
be thus capable only of being sensitive, it is perishable; but if it 
has with the sensitive nature also rationality, it is imperishable. 
For though the sensitive does not impart incorruptibility, 
nevertheless it is impossible to dissociate incorruptibility from 
the rational. 
II. Forms do not belong to species and to genus, but the 
composites. Man however is mortal, as are all other animals. 
The difference therefore between the perishable and imperish- 
able, which proceeds from the forms, does not cause man to 
differ in genus from the other animals. 
III. The embryo has at first only a sensitive soul. If this be 
superseded, it receives a more perfect one, which is both sensi- 
tive and rational. 
IV. One should: not apply different kinds of reasoning or 
logical deduction, which are involved in methods of cognition, 
to determine diversity in natural object. For in reasoning it is 
possible to apprehend one and the same thing in different ways. 
Hence, since the rational soul contains in its powers everything 
that belongs to the sensitive soul, and also something more; the 
reason too can distinguish from itself, what pertains to the 
powers of the sensitive soul, and regard it as something in- 
complete and material. Moreover, because it finds this incom- 
pleteness to be something common to man and toother animals, 
it formulates therefrom the nature of the genus. But that in 
which the rational soul exceeds and surpasses the sensitive 
soul, it regards as the forming and perfecting principle which 
differentiates the being of man. 
1 This is more fully developed by Thomas Aquinas in Question cxvin, 
Art. 2 of the Summa Theologica.

QUESTION LXXVI. THE RELATION OF SOUL 
AND BODY 
Article VI. Is the Soul united to the Body without any further 
Intermediation ? 
(a) Ir would appear that the rational soul is united to the 
body by the intermediation of certain special properties. For: 
I. Every form exists in matter suited and adjusted to it. But 
such preadjustment to the form is effected by certain accidents. 
Hence some accidental properties must be thought present 
in matter before the entrance of the soul as substantial form. 
II. Different forms of one and the same species are adapted 
to different parts of matter. But different parts presuppose the 
apportioning of measurable quantities. Therefore one cannot 
assume such apportioning of matter before the entrance of sub- 
stantial forms, of which many unite in one species. 
III. The spiritual effects the body through its operating 
activity. But the activity of the soul is its intellectual power. 
Therefore the soul is united to the body by means of its intel- 
lectual power, which is so to speak an accidental property. 
But on the other hand it should be said: Every such property 
exists posterior to substance, and thus presupposes both time 
and reason (7 Metaph.). Therefore the accidental form cannot 
be thought as existing in the matter before the soul is there 
as substantial form. 
(6) I answer: if the soul were only the mover of the body, 
nothing need be said against this view. On the contrary, it 
would be necessary to assume that particular properties in- 
termediate between soul and body; namely, upon the part of the 
soul the ability to move the body, and upon the part of the 
body, its moveability. 
But since the rational soul is the substantial form of the 
body, it is impossible that there should be any accidental inter- 
mediation between the soul and body, or between any sub- 
stantial form and its matter. Since matter is potentially dis- 
posed in acertain order for all actualities, that which in point 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
144 THOMAS AQUINAS 
of simplicity is first in actualities is first in matter. But the first 
of all actualities is being. It is impossible, therefore, to conceive 
a substance as either cold, or to have size, before it has actual 
existence. But everything has actual existence in virtue of its 
substantial form. Therefore, it is impossible that there should 
be any preparatory accidental quality in the matter before the 
substantial form; and consequently nothing in the body before 
the soul. 
(c) To the first position we must say, as is clear from the 
previous discussion, that a form of more perfect powers com- 
prises whatever inferior forms there are. Therefore one and the 
same existing form perfects its matter in different grades of 
perfection. It is one and the same essential form by which man 
has being, possesses body, is living, is animal, and is man. It 
is now apparent, that certain peculiar properties correspond to 
every one of these different kinds of actuality. Hence as matter 
is conceived as perfected in being before it can be apprehended 
as corporeal, so the properties which accompany being are 
conceived before their incorporation. So too adjustments of 
matter are conceived before the form, not as if these were 
present in actual being, but because they accompany its 
activities. 
II. The kinds of magnitude which are the necessary proper- 
ties of materiality, correspond to those which belong in general to 
matter. Matter, therefore, can be viewed as already corporeal, 
and of various magnitudes, and yet be regarded as different in 
its various parts; and therefore as capable of receiving a further 
degree of perfection in its diverse forms. For though it is always 
one and the same form in its essence, through which the differ- 
ent degrees of perfection are attributed to matter, still reason 
makes distinctions in these perfections. 
III. The spiritual substance that is united to the body 
merely as its motive force, is united to it by its potential and 
actual powers. But the intellective soul is united to the body, 
as form in its absolute essence. It however regulates the body 
by its potential and actual powers.

QUESTION LXXXII. THE SUPERIORITY OF 
REASON TO WILL 
Article IIT. Is the Nature of Reason superior to that of Will? 
(a) This appears not to be the case. For: 
I. The final cause or the good is the object of the will. But 
the final cause is the first and highest of causes. The will, there- 
fore, is the first and highest of the faculties. 
II. Natural objects ascend from the imperfect to the perfect. 
Thus also in the faculties of the soul, the order of progress is from 
the senses to the reason, which is superior. But the natural pro- 
cess is from an act of mind to an act of will. The will is there- 
fore superior to and more perfect than the intellect. 
III. States of mind correspond to their potencies. But love 
which is a state of mind achieved by the will stands as the 
highest virtue. For it is written: “Though I know all mysteries 
and have all faith but have not love I am nothing.” 1 Cor. 13, 
v.2. The will is therefore a higher potency than the intellect. 
On the other hand, Aristotle gives (10 Ethics, 7) the first 
place among the faculties to reason. 
1. Tanswer, the rank of a faculty in relation to others can 
be viewed: (1) in accordance to the nature possessed by each 
absolutely; and (2) in accordance to a certain aspect only 
relatively. 
If the first view be considered, it is self-evident that the 
reason is superior to the will. For the nature of a faculty is 
judged according to its objects. Now the object of the reason 
is more simple, absolute, and less conditioned, than that of 
the will. For the object of the reason is the very idea of de- 
sirable good. The will however is directed towards a desirable 
good, the idea of which isin the reason. Now the more simple, 
the less conditioned, and the more detached from particulars, 
anything is, so much the higher does it stand in the rank and 
the value of its being. The faculty of reason is, therefore, in 
its nature more noble, and more sublime, than that of the will. 
Relatively, however, and in comparison with something else,
-P-A-G-E-168
  
  146 THOMAS AQUINAS 
it may chance at times that the will stands higher than the 
intellect. This is true because the object of the will may belong 
to a higher type of being than the object of the reason. Thus I 
could say that hearing is superior to sight, because the object 
from which the object proceeds is more noble than that which 
has the color, although color in itself may stand higher and be 
purer than sound. In a similar manner, the action of the intel- 
lect consists in this, that the nature of the thing known is com- 
prehended by the knower; but the action of the will is con- 
summated in the will’s inclining to the object as it is in itself, 
whatever its nature may be. For this reason, Aristotle says, 
“good and evil which are the objects of the will belong to 
things; true and false which are objects of the intellect belong 
to the mind” (6 Metaph.). When, therefore, the actual being in 
which the good exists as object of reason, is superior to the soul 
itself in which its nature is comprehended, then in comparison 
to such an object, the will is superior to the reason. But if the 
desired object is lower than the soul, then the reason in com- 
parison to such an object is superior to the will. It is, there- 
fore, better to love God, than merely to know God; and, con- 
versely, it is better only to know corporeal things, than to 
love them. Nevertheless absolutely, reason is superior to will. 
(c) II. Whatever is earlier in time or origin is the more 
imperfect. For in one and the same thing, the potency pre- 
cedes activity. At first there is the imperfect, later the per- 
fected. But that which is before absolutely, and according to 
the order of nature, is the more perfect. Thus the activity is 
earlier than the potency. And in like manner, the reason 
precedes the will, as the moving force precedes that which is 
moved, and as activity precedes the affected. For in so far as 
the good is conceived by the reason, it moves the will. 
III. Through love we cleave to God, who is transcendently 
raised above the soul. For that reason, the will is in this in- 
stance superior to the reason.

(1588-1679) 
HUMAN NATURE* 
CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION 
1. THE true and perspicuous explication of the elements of 
laws natural and politic (which is my present scope) dependeth 
upon the knowledge of what is human nature, what is body politic, 
and what it is we call a Jaw; concerning which points, as the writ- 
ings of men from antiquity downwards have still increased, so 
also have the doubts and controversies concerning the same: and 
seeing that true knowledge begetteth not doubt nor controversy, 
but knowledge, it is manifest from the present controversies, 
that they, which have heretofore written thereof, have not well 
understood their own subject. 
2. Harm I can do none, though I err no less than they; for I 
shall leave men but as they are, in doubt and dispute: but, in- 
tending not to take any principle upon trust, but only to put 
men in mind of what they know already, or may know by their 
own experience, I hope to err the less; and when I do, it must 
proceed from too hasty concluding, which I will endeavour as 
much as I can to avoid. 
3. On the other side, if reasoning aright win not consent, which 
may very easily happen, from them that being confident of 
their own knowledge weigh not what is said, the fault is not 
mine, but theirs; for as it is my part to shew my reasons, so it is 
theirs to bring attention. 
4. Man’s nature is the sum of his natural faculties and powers, 
as the faculties of nutrition, motion, generation, sense, reason,

printed here from Hobbes’ English Works, collected and edited by Sir William 
Molesworth, London, 1839, vol. iv.
-P-A-G-E-170
  148 THOMAS HOBBES 
&c. These powers we do unanimously call natural, and are con- 
tained in the definition of man, under these words, animal and 
rational. 
5. According to the two principal parts of man, I divide his 
faculties into two sorts, faculties of the body, and faculties of the 
mind. 
6. Since the minute and distinct anatomy of the powers of 
the body is nothing necessary to the present purpose, I will only 
sum them up in these three heads, power nutritive, power mo- 
tive, and power generative. 
7. Of the powers of the mind there be two sorts, cognitive, 
imaginative, or conceptive, and motive; and first of cognitive. 
For the understanding of what I mean by the power cogni- 
tive, we must remember and acknowledge that there be in our 
minds continually certain images or conceptions of the things 
without us, insomuch that if a man could be alive, and all the 
rest of the world annihilated, he should nevertheless retain the 
image thereof, and all those things which he had before seen or 
perceived in it; every one by his own experience knowing, that 
the absence or destruction of things once imagined doth not cause 
the absence or destruction of the imagination itself. This imagery 
and representations of the qualities of the thing without, is that 
we call our conception, imagination, ideas, notice or knowledge of 
them; and the faculty or power by which we are capable of such 
knowledge, is that I here call cognitive power, or conceptive, th” 
power of knowing or conceiving. 
CHAPTER II. THE SENSE AND ITS MAIN 
DECEPTION 
1. Havine declared what I mean by the word conception, 
and other words equivalent thereunto, I come to the concep- 
tions themselves, to shew their differences, their causes, and 
the manner of the production, so far as is necessary for this 
place. 
2. Originally all conceptions proceed from the action of the 
thing itself, whereof it is the conception: now when the action is
-P-A-G-E-171
    HUMAN NATURE 149 
present, the conception it produceth is also called sense; and the 
thing by whose action the same is produced, is called the object 
of the sense. 
3. By our several organs we have several conceptions of sev- 
eral qualities in the objects; for by sight we have a conception or 
image composed of colour and figure, which is all the notice and 
knowledge the object imparteth to us of its nature by the eye. 
By hearing we have a conception called sound, which is all the 
knowledge we have of the quality of the object from the ear. 
And so the rest of the senses are also conceptions of several 
qualities, or natures of their objects. 
4. Because the image in vision consisting of colour and shape 
is the knowledge we have of the qualities of the object of that 
sense; it is no hard matter for a man to fall into this opinion, 
that the same colour and shape are the very qualities themselves; 
and for the same cause, that sound and noise are the qualities of 
the bell, or of the air. And this opinion hath been so long re- 
ceived, that the contrary must needs appear a great paradox; 
and yet the introduction of species visible and intelligible (which 
is necessary for the maintenance of that opinion) passing to and 
fro from the object, is worse than any paradox, as being a plain 
impossibility. I shall therefore endeavour to make plain these 
points: 
That the subject wherein colour and image are inherent, is 
not the object or thing seen. 
That there is nothing without us (really) which we call an 
image or colour. 
That the said image or colour is but an apparition unto us 
of the motion, agitation, or alteration, which the object work- 
eth in the brain, or spirits, or some internal substance of the 
head. 
That as in vision, so also in conceptions that arise from the 
other senses, the subject of their inherence is not the object, but 
the sentient. 
5. Every man hath so much experience as to have seen the 
sun and the other visible objects by reflection in the water and 
glasses; and this alone is sufficient for this conclusion, that col-
-P-A-G-E-172
150 THOMAS HOBBES 
our and image may be there where the thing seen is not. But 
because it may be said that notwithstanding the image in the 
water be not in the object, but a thing merely phantastical, yet 
there may be colour really in the thing itself: I will urge further 
this experience, that divers times men see directly the same 
object double, as two candles for one, which may happen from 
distemper, or otherwise without distemper if a man will, the 
organs being either in their right temper, or equally distem- 
pered; the colours and figures in two such images of the same 
thing cannot be inherent therein, because the thing seen cannot 
be in two places. 
One of these images therefore is not inherent in the object: 
but seeing the organs of the sight are then in equal temper 
or distemper, the one of them is no more inherent than the 
other; and consequently neither of them both are in the object; 
which is the first proposition, mentioned in the precedent 
number. 
6. Secondly, that the image of any thing by reflection in a 
glass or water or the like, is not any thing in or behind the glass, 
or in or-under the water, every man may grant to himself; which 
is the second proposition. 
7. For the third, we are to consider, first that upon every 
great agitation or concussion of the brain (as it happeneth from a 
stroke, especially if the stroke be upon the eye) whereby the 
optic nerve suffereth any great violence, there appeareth before 
the eyes-a certain light, which light is nothing without, but an 
apparition only, all that is real being the concussion or motion 
of the parts of that nerve; from which experience we may con- 
clude, that apparition of light is really nothing but motion within. 
If therefore from lucid bodies there can be derived motion, so as 
to affect the optic nerve in such manner as is proper thereunto, 
there will follow an image of light somewhere in that line by 
which the motion was last derived to the eye; that is to say, in 
the object, if we look directly on it, and in the glass or water, 
when we look upon it in the line of reflection, which in effect 
is the third proposition; namely, that image and colour is but 
an apparition to, us of that motion, agitation, or alteration
-P-A-G-E-173
HUMAN NATURE 151 
which the object worketh in the brain or spirits, or some infernal 
substance in the head. 
8. But that from all lucid, shining and illuminate bodies 
there is a motion produced to the eye, and, through the eye, to 
the optic nerve, and so into the brain, by which that apparition 
of light or colour is affected, is not hard to prove. And first, it is 
evident that the fire, the only lucid body here upon earth, 
worketh by motion equally every way; insomuch as the motion 
thereof stopped or inclosed, it is presently extinguished, and no 
more fire. And further, that that motion, whereby the fire work- 
eth, is dilation, and contraction of itself alternately, commonly 
called scintillation or glowing, is manifest also by experience. 
From such motion in the fire must needs arise a rejection or cast- 
ing from itself of that part of the medium which is contiguous 
to it, whereby that part also rejecteth the mext, and so success- 
ively one part beateth back another to the very eye; and in the 
same manner the exterior part of the eye presseth the interior, 
(the laws of refraction still observed). Now the interior coat of 
the eye is nothing else but a piece of the optic nerve; and there- 
fore the motion is still continued thereby into the brain, and by 
resistance or reaction of the brain, is also a rebound into the optic 
nerve again; which we not conceiving as motion or rebound from 
within, do think it is without, and call it light; as hath been al- 
ready shewed by the experience of a stroke. We have no reason: 
to doubt, that the fountain of light, the suv, worketh by any 
other ways than the fire, at least in this matter. And thus all 
vision hath its original from such motion as is here described: 
for where there is no light, there is no sight; and therefore colour’ 
also must be the same thing with light, as being the effect of the 
lucid bodies: their difference being only this, that when the light 
cometh directly from the fountain to the eye, or indirectly by 
reflection from clean and polite bodies, and such as have not any’ 
particular motion internal to alter it, we call it light; but when it 
cometh to the eye by reflection from uneven, rough, and coarse 
bodies, or such as are affected with internal motion of their own 
that may alter it, then we call it colour; colour and light differ- 
ing only in this, that the one is pure, and the other perturbed  
-P-A-G-E-174
  152 THOMAS HOBBES 
light. By that which hath been said, not only the truth of the 
third proposition, but also the whole manner of producing light 
and colour, is apparent. 
g. As colour is not inherent in the object, but an effect thereof 
upon us, caused by such motion in the object, as hath been 
described: so neither is sound in the thing we hear, but in our- 
selves. One manifest sign thereof is, that as a man may see, so 
also he may hear double or treble, by multiplication of echoes, 
which echoes are sounds as well as the original; and ot being in 
one and the same place, cannot be inherent in the body that 
maketh them. Nothing can make any thing which is not in it- 
self: the clapper hath no sound in it, but motion, and maketh 
motion in the internal parts of the bell; so the be// hath motion, 
and not sound, that imparteth motion to the air; and the air 
hath motion, but not sound; the air imparteth motion by the 
ear and nerve unto the brain; and the brain hath motion but not 
sound; from the brain, it reboundeth back into the nerves out- 
ward, and thence it becometh an apparition without, which we 
call sound. And to proceed to the rest of the senses, it is appar- 
ent enough, that the smell and taste of the same thing, are not the 
same to every man; and therefore are not in the thing smelt or 
tasted, but in the men. So likewise the heat we feel from the fire 
is manifestly in us, and is quite different from the heat which is 
in the fire: for our heat is pleasure or pain, according as it is 
great or moderate; but in the coal there is no such thing. By this 
the fourth and last proposition is proved, viz. that as in vision, 
so also in conceptions that arise from other senses, the subject 
of their inherence is not in the object, but in the sentient. 
to. And from hence also it followeth, that whatsoever acci- 
dents or qualities our senses make us think there be in the world, 
they be not there, but are seeming and apparitions only: the 
things that really are in the world without us, are those motions 
by which these seemings are caused. And this is the great decep- 
tion of sense, which also is to be by sense corrected: for as sense 
telleth me, when I see directly, that the colour seemeth to be in 
the object; so also sense telleth me, when I see by reflection, what 
colour is not in the object.

stone, or blast of wind, doth not presently give over moving as 
soon as the wind ceaseth, or the stone settleth: so nezther doth 
the effect cease which the object hath wrought upon the brain, 
so soon as ever by turning aside of the organs the object ceaseth 
to work; that is to say, though the sense be past, the image or 
conception remaineth; but more obscure while we are awake, be- 
cause some object or other continually plieth and soliciteth our 
eyes, and ears, keeping the mind in a stronger motion, whereby 
the weaker doth not easily appear. And this obscure concep- 
tion is that we call phantasy, or imagination: imagination being, 
to define it, conception remaining, and by little and little decay- 
ing from after and the act of sense. 
2. But when present sense is ot, as in sleep, there the images 
remaining after sense, when there be many, as in dreams, are 
not obscure, but strong and clear, as in sense itself. The reason is, 
that which obscured and made the conceptions weak, namely 
sense, and present operation of the object, is removed: for sleep 
is the privation of the act of sense, (the power remaining) and 
dreams are the imagination of them that sleep. 
3. The causes of dreams, if they be natural, are the actions or 
violence of the inward parts of a man upon his brain, by which 
the passages of sense by sleep benumbed, are restored to their 
motion. The signs by which this appeareth to be so, are the 
differences of dreams (old men commonly dream oftener, and 
have their dreams more painful than young) proceeding from 
the different accidents of man’s body, as dreams of lust, as 
dreams of anger, according as the heart, or other parts within, 
work more or less upon the brain, by more or less heat; so also 
the descents of different sorts of phlegm maketh us a dream of 
different tastes of meats and drinks; and I believe there is a 
reciprocation of motion from the brain to the vital parts, and 
back from the vital parts to the brain; whereby not only imagin- 
ation begetteth motion in those parts; but also motion in those 
parts begetteth imagination like to that by which it was begot-
-P-A-G-E-176
  154 THOMAS HOBBES 
.ten. If this be true, and that sad imaginations nourish the 
spleen, then we see also a cause, why a strong spleen recipro- 
cally causeth fearful dreams, and why the effects of lascivious- 
ness may in a dream produce the image of some person that had 
caused them. Another sign that dreamsare caused by the action 
of the inward parts, is the disorder and casual consequence of 
one conception or image to another: for when we are waking, 
the antecedent thought or conception introduceth, and is cause 
of the consequent, as the water followeth a man’s finger upon a 
dry and level table; but in dreams there is commonly no coher- 
ence, and when there is, it is by chance, which must needs pro- 
ceed from this, that the brain in dreams is not restored to its 
motion in every part alike; whereby it cometh to pass, that our 
thoughts appear like the stars between the flying clouds, not in 
the order which a man would choose to observe them, but as the 
uncertain flight of broken clouds permits. 
4. As when the water, or any liquid thing moved at once by 
divers movements, receiveth one motion compounded of them 
all; so also the brain or spirit therein, having been stirred by 
divers objects, composeth an imagination of divers conceptions 
that appeared single to the sense. As for example, the sense 
sheweth at one time the figure of a mountain, and at another 
time the colour of gold; but the imagination afterwards hath 
them both at once in a golden mountain. From the same cause 
it is, there appear unto us castles in the air, chimeras, and other 
monsters which are not in rerum natura, but have been conceived 
by the sense in pieces at several times. And this composition is 
that which we commonly call fiction of the mind. 
5. There is yet another kind of imagination, which for clear- 
ness contendeth with sense, as well as a dream; and that is, when 
the action of sense hath been long or vehement: and the experi- 
ence thereof is more frequent in the sense of seeing, than the 
rest. An example whereof is, the image remaining before the 
eye after looking upon the sun. Also, those little images that 
appear before the eyes in the dark (whereof I think every man 
hath experience, but they most of all, who are timorous or 
superstitious) are examples of the same. And these, for distinc- 
tion-sake, may he called phantasms.
-P-A-G-E-177
  HUMAN NATURE 155 
6. By the senses, which are numbered according to the or- 
gans to be five, we take notice (as hath been said already) of the 
objects without us; and that notice is our conception thereof: but 
we take notice also some way or other of our conceptions: for when 
the conception of the same thing cometh again, we take notice 
that it is again; that is to say, that we have had the same con- 
ception before; which is as much as to imagine a thing past; 
which is impossible to the sense, which is only of things present. 
This therefore may be accounted a siath sense, but internal, (not 
external, as the rest) and is commonly called remembrance. 
7. For the manner by which we take notice of a conception 
past, we are to remember, that in the definition of imagination, 
it is said to be a conception by little and litile decaying, or growing 
more obscure. An obscure conception is that which representeth 
the whole object together, but none of the smaller parts by them- 
selves; and as more or fewer parts be represented, so is the con- 
ception or representation said to be more or less clear. Seeing 
then the conception, which when it was first produced by sense, 
was clear, and represented the parts of the object distinctly; and 
when it cometh again is obscure, we find missing somewhat that 
we expected; by which we judge it past and decayed. For exam- 
ple, a man that is present in a foreign city, seeth not only whole 
streets, but can also distinguish particular houses, and paris of 
houses; but departed thence, he cannot distinguish them so 
particularly in his mind as he did, some house or turning escap- 
ing him; yet is this to remember; when afterwards there escape 
him more particulars, this is also to remember, but not so well. In 
process of time, the image of the city returneth but as a mass of 
building only, which is almost to have forgotten it. Seeing then 
remembrance is more or less, as we find more or less obscurity, 
why may not we well think remembrance to be nothing else but 
the missing of parts, which every man expecteth should succeed 
after they have a conception of the whole? To see at a great 
distance of place, and to remember at a great distance of time, 
is to have like conceptions of the thing: for there wanteth dis- 
tinction of parts in both; the one conception being weak by 
operation at distance, the other by decay.
-P-A-G-E-178
  156 THOMAS HOBBES 
8. And from this that hath been said, there followeth, that a 
man can never know he dreameth; he may dream he doubieth, 
whether it be a dream or no: but the clearness of the imagina- 
tion representeth every thing with as many parts as doth sense 
itself, and consequently, he can take notice of nothing but as 
present; whereas to think he dreameth, is to think those his con- 
ceptions, that is to say dreams, obscurer than they were in the 
sense; so that he must think them both as clear, and not as 
clear as sense; which is impossible. 
9. From the same ground it proceedeth, that men wonder not 
in their dreams at place and persons, as they would do waking: 
for waking, a man would think it strange to be in a place where 
he never was before, and remember nothing of how he came 
there; but in a dream, there cometh little of that kind into con- 
sideration. The clearness of conception in a dream, taketh away 
distrust, unless the strangeness be excessive, as to think himself 
fallen from on high without hurt, and then most commonly he 
waketh. 
10. Nor is it impossible for a man to be so far deceived, as 
when his dream is past, to think it real: for if he dream of such 
things as are ordinarily in his mind, and in such order as he 
useth to do waking, and withal that he laid him down to sleep 
in the place where he findeth himself when he awaketh; all 
which may happen: I know no «pitypuov or mark by which he 
can discern whether it were a dream or not, and therefore do 
the less wonder to hear a man sometimes to tell his dream for a 
truth, or to take it for a vision. 
CHAPTER IV. THOUGHT 
1. THE succession of conceptions in the mind, series or conse- 
quence of one after another, may be casual and incoherent, as in 
dreams for the most part; and it may be orderly, as when the 
former thought introduceth the latter; and this is discourse of 
the mind. But because the word discourse is commonly taken 
for the coherence and consequence of words, I will, to avoid 
equivocation, call it discursion.
-P-A-G-E-179
  HUMAN NATURE 157 
2. The cause of the coherence or consequence of one concep- 
tion to another, is their first coherence or consequence at that 
time when they are produced by sense: as for example, from St. 
Andrew the mind runneth to St. Peter, because their names are 
read together; from St. Peter to a stone, for the same cause; from 
stone to foundation, because we see them together; and for the 
same cause, from foundation to church, and from church to 
people, and from people to twmult: and according to this exam- 
ple, the mind may run almost from anything to anything. But 
as in the sense the conception of cause and effect may succeed 
one another; so may they after sense in the imagination: and for 
the most part they do so; the cause whereof is the appetite of 
them, who, having a conception of the end, have next unto it a 
conception of the next means to that end: as, when a man, from 
a thought of honour to which he hath an appetite, cometh to the 
thought of wisdom, which is the next means thereunto; and 
from thence to the thought of study, which is the next means to 
wisdom. 
3. To omit that kind of discursion by which we proceed from 
anything to anything, there are of the other kind divers sorts: as 
first, in the senses there are certain coherences of conceptions, 
which we may call ranging; examples whereof are; a man cast- 
eth his eye upon the ground, to look about for some small thing 
lost; the hounds casting about at a fault in hunting; and the 
ranging of spaniels: and herein we take a beginning arbitrary. 
4. Another sort of discursion is, when the appetite giveth a 
man his beginning, as in the example before, where honour to 
which a man hath appetite, maketh him think upon the next 
means of attaining it, and that again of the next, &c. And this 
the Latins call sagacitas, and we may call hunting or tracing, 
as dogs trace beasts by the smell, and men hunt them by 
their footsteps; or as men hunt after riches, place, or know- 
ledge. 
5. There is yet another kind of discursion beginning with the 
appetite to recover something lost, proceeding from the present 
backward, from thought of the place where we miss at, to the 
thought of the place from whence we came Jast; and from the
-P-A-G-E-180
  158 THOMAS HOBBES 
thought of that, to the thought of a place before, till we have in 
our mind some place, wherein we had the thing we miss: and 
this is called reminiscence. 
6. The remembrance of succession of one thing to another, 
that is, of what was antecedent, and what consequent, and what 
concomitant, is called an experiment; whether the same be made 
by us voluntarily, as when a man putteth any thing into the fire, 
to see what effect the fire will produce upon it: or not made by 
us, as when we remember a fair morning after a red evening. 
To have had many experiments, is that we call experience, which 
is nothing else but remembrance of what antecedents have been 
followed by what consequents. 
7. No man can have in his mind a conception of the future, 
for the future is not yet: but of our conceptions of the past, we 
make a future; or rather, call past, future relatively. Thus after 
a man hath been accustomed to see like antecedents followed 
by like consequents, whensoever he seeth the like come to pass 
to any thing he had seen before, he looks there should follow 
it the same that followed then: as for example, because a man 
hath often seen offences followed by punishment, when he 
seeth an offence in present, he thinketh punishment to be con- 
sequent thereunto; but consequent unto that which is present, 
men call future; and thus we make remembrance to be the pre- 
vision of things to come, or expectation or presumption of the 
future. 
8. In the same manner, if a man seeth in present that which 
he hath'seen before, he thinks that that which was antecedent 
to that which he saw before, is also antecedent to that he pre- 
sently seeth: as for example, he that hath seen the ashes remain 
after the fire, and now again seeth ashes, concludeth again 
there hath been fire: and this is called again conjecture of the past, 
or presumption of the fact. 
9. When a man hath so often observed like antecedents to be 
followed by like consequents, that whensoever he seeth the ante- 
cedent, he looketh again for the consequent; or when he seeth 
the consequent, maketh account there hath been the like ante- 
cedent; then he calleth both the antecedent and the consequent,
-P-A-G-E-181
    
HUMAN NATURE 159 
signs one of another, as clouds are signs of rain to come, and 
rain of clouds past. 
to. This taking of signs by experience, is that wherein men 
do ordinarily think, the difference stands between man and man 
in wisdom, by which they commonly understand a man’s whole 
ability or power cognitive ; but this is an error: for the signs are 
but conjectural; and according as they have often or seldom 
failed, so their assurance is more or less; but never full and evi- 
dent: for though a man have always seen the day and night to 
follow one another hitherto; yet can he not thence conclude 
they shall do so, or that they have done so eternally: experi- 
ence concludeth nothing universally. If the signs hit twenty times 
for one missing, a man may lay a wager of twenty to one of the 
event; but may not conclude it for a truth. But by this it is 
plain, that they shall conjecture best, that have most experience, 
because they have most signs to conjecture by: which is the 
reason old men are more prudent, that is, conjecture better, 
ceteris paribus, than young: for, being old, they remember 
more; and experience is but remembrance. And men of quick 
imagination, ceteris paribus, are more prudent than those whose 
imaginations are slow: for they observe more in less time. Prud- 
ence is nothing but conjecture from experience, or taking of 
signs from experience warily, that is, that the experiments from 
which he taketh such signs be all remembered; for else the cases 
are not alike that seem so. 
zx. Asin conjecture concerning things past and future, it is 
prudence to conclude from experience, what is like to come to 
pass, or to have passed already; so it is an error to conclude 
from it, that it is so or so called; that is to say, we cannot from 
experience conclude, that any thing is to be called just or unjust, 
true or false, or any proposition universal whatsoever, except 
it be from remembrance of the use of names imposed arbitrarily 
by men: for example, to have heard a sentence given in the like 
case, the like sentence a thousand times is not enough to con- 
clude that the sentence is just; though most men have no other 
means to conclude by: butit is zecessary, for the drawing of such 
conclusion, to érace and find out, by many experiences, what men
-P-A-G-E-182
  160 THOMAS HOBBES 
do mean by calling things just and unjust. Further, there is 
another caveat to be taken in concluding by experience, from 
the tenth section of the second chapter; that is, that we con- 
clude such things to be without, that are within us. 
CHAPTER VI. KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF 
1. THERE is a story somewhere, of one that pretends to have 
been miraculously cured of blindness, wherewith he was born, 
by St. Alban or other Saints, at the town of St. Alban’s; and 
that the Duke of Gloucester being there, to be satisfied of the 
truth of the miracle, asked the man, What colour is this? who, 
by answering, it was green, discovered himself, and was pun- 
ished for a counterfeit: for though by his sight newly received 
he might distinguish between green, and red, and all other col- 
ours, as well as any that should interrogate him, yet he could 
not possibly know at first sight which of them was called green, 
or red, or by any other name. By this we may understand, 
there be two kinds of knowledge, whereof the one is nothing else 
but sense, or knowledge original, as I have said in the beginning 
of the second chapter, and remembrance of the same; the other is 
called science or knowledge of the truth of propositions, and how 
things are called, and is derived from understanding. Both of 
these sorts are but experience; the former being the experience 
of the effects of things that work upon us from without; and the 
latter experience men have from the proper use of names in 
language: and all experience being, as I have said, but remem- 
brance, all knowledge is remembrance: and of the former, the 
register we keep in books, is called history; but the registers of 
the latter are called the sciences. 
2. There are two things fae implied in this word 
knowledge; the one is truth, the other evidence; for what is not 
truth, can never be known. For, let a man say he knoweth a 
thing never so well, if the same shall afterwards appear false, 
he is driven to confession, that it was not knowledge, but opin- 
ion. Likewise, if the truth be not evident, though a man holdeth 
it, yet is his knowledge thereof no more than theirs who hold
-P-A-G-E-183
  HUMAN NATURE 161 
the contrary: for if truth were enough to make it knowledge, 
all truth were known; which is not so. 
3. What truth is, hath been defined in the precedent chapter; 
what evidence is, I now set down: and it is the concomitance of a 
man’s conception with the words that signify such conception 
in the act of ratiocination: for when a man reasoneth with his 
lips only, to which the mind suggesteth only the beginning, and 
followeth not the words of his mouth with the conceptions of 
his mind, out of custom of so speaking; though he begin his 
ratiocination with true propositions, and proceed with certain 
syllogisms, and thereby make always true conclusions; yet are 
not his conclusions evident to him, for want of the concomitance 
of conception with his words: for if the words alone were suffi- 
cient, a parrot might be taught as well to know truth, as to speak 
it. Evidence is to truth, as the sap to the tree, which, so far as 
it creepeth along with the body and branches, keepeth them 
alive; where it forsaketh them, they die: for this evidence, which 
is meaning with our words, is the life of truth. 
4. Knowledge thereof, which we call science, I define to be 
evidence of truth, from some beginning or principle of sense: for 
the truth of a proposition is never evident, until we conceive the 
meaning of the words or terms whereof it consisteth, which are 
always conceptions of the mind: nor can we remember those 
conceptions, without the thing that produced the same by our 
senses. The first principle of knowledge is, that we have such 
and such conceptions; the second, that we have thus and thus 
named the things whereof they are conceptions; the third is, 
that we have joined those names in such manner as to make 
true propositions; the fourth and last is, that we have joined 
those propositions in such manner as they be concluding, 
and the truth of the conclusion said to be known. And of these 
two kinds of knowledge, whereof the former is experience of fact, 
and the latter evidence of truth; as the former, if it be great, is 
called prudence; so the latter, if it be much, hath usually been 
called, both by ancient and modern writers, sapience or wisdom 
and of this /atter, man only is capable; of the former, brute beasts 
also participate.
-P-A-G-E-184
  162 THOMAS aie 
5. A proposition is said to be supposed, when, being not evi- 
dent, it is nevertheless admitted for a time, to the end, that, join- 
ing to it other propositions, we may conclude something; and to 
proceed from conclusion to conclusion, for a trial whether the 
same will lead us into any absurd or impossible conclusion; 
which if it do, then we know such supposition to have been false. 
6. But if running through many conclusions, we come to none 
that are absurd, then we think the deans probable; likewise 
we think probable whatsoever proposition we admit for truth 
by error of reasoning, or from trusting to other men: and all such 
propositions as are admitted by érust or error, we are not said to 
know, but to think them to be true; and the admittance of them 
is called opinion. 
7. And particularly, when the opinion is admitted out of 
trust to other men, they are said to believe it; and their admit- 
tance of it is called belief, and sometimes faith. 
8. It is either science or opinion which we commonly mean 
by the word conscience: for men say that such and such a thing 
is true in or upon their conscience; wich they never do, when 
they think it doubtful; and therefore they know, or think they 
know it to be true. But men, when they say things upon their 
conscience, are not therefore presumed certainly to know the 
truth of what they say; it remaineth then, that that word is 
used by them that have an opinion, not only of the truth of the 
thing, but also of their knowledge of it, to which the truth of the 
proposition is consequent. Conscience I therefore define to be 
opinion of evidence. 
9. Belief, which is the admitting of propositions upon trust, 
in many cases is no less free from doubt, than perfect and mani- 
fest knowledge : for as there is nothing whereof there is not some 
cause; so, when there is doubt, there must be some cause there- 
of conceived. Now there be many things which we receive from 
report of others, of which it is impossible to imagine any cause of 
doubt for what can be opposed against the consent of all men, 
in things they can know, and have no cause to report otherwise 
than they are, such as is a great part of our histories, unless a 
man would say that all the world had conspired to deceive him.  
-P-A-G-E-185
  HUMAN NATURE , 163 
And thus much of sense, imagination, discursion, ratiocina- 
tion, and knowledge, which are the acts of our power cognitive, or 
conceptive. That power of the mind which we call motive, dif- 
fereth from the power motive of the body; for the power motive 
of the body is that by which it moveth other bodies, and we call 
strength : but the power motive of the mind, is that by which the 
mind giveth animal motion to that body wherein it existeth; the 
acts hereof are our affections and passions, of which I am to 
speak in general. 
CHAPTER VII. THE PASSIONS 
x. In the eighth section of the second chapter is shewed, that 
conceptions and apparitions are nothing really, but motion in 
some internal substance of the head; which motion not stopping 
there, but proceeding to the heart, of necessity must there either 
help or hinder the motion which is called vital; when it helpeth, 
it is called delight, contentment, or pleasure, which is nothing 
really but motion about the heart, as conception is nothing but 
motion in the head: and the objects that cause it are called 
pleasant or delightful, or by some name equivalent; the Latins 
have jucundum, a juvando, from helping; and the same delight, 
with reference to the object, is called Jove: but when such motion 
weakeneth or hindereth the vital motion, then it is called pain; 
and in relation to that which causeth it, hatred, which the 
Latins express sometimes by odiwm, and sometimes by tedium. 
2. This motion, in which consisteth pleasure or pain, is also a 
solicitation or provocation either to draw near to the thing that 
pleaseth, or to retire from the thing that displeaseth; and this 
solicitation is the endeavour or internal beginning of animal 
motion, which when the object delighteth, is called appetite; 
when it displeaseth, it is called aversion, in respect of the dis- 
pleasure present; but in respect of the displeasure expected, fear. 
So that, pleasure, love, and appetite, which is also called desire, 
are divers names for divers considerations of the same thing. 
3. Every man, for his own part, calleth that which pleaseth, 
and is delightful to himself, good; and that evil which displeas-
-P-A-G-E-186
ne ee ee eee 
164 THOMAS HOBBES 
eth him: insomuch that while every man differeth from another 
in constitution, they differ also from one another concerning the 
common distinction of good and evil. Nor is there any such 
thing as absolute goodness, considered without relation: for 
even the goodness which we apprehend in God Almighty, is his 
goodness tous. And as we call good and evil the things that please 
and displease; so call we goodness and badness, the qualities or 
powers whereby they do it: and the signs of that goodness are 
called by the Latins in one word pulchritudo, and the signs of 
evil, turpitudo; to which we have no words precisely answerable. 
As all conceptions we have immediately by the sense, are, 
delight, or pain, or appetite, or fear; so are all the imaginations 
after sense. But as they are weaker imaginations, so are they 
also weaker pleasures, or weaker pain. 
4. As appetite is the beginning of animal motion towards 
something that pleaseth us; so is the attaining thereof, the end 
of that motion, which we also call the scope, and aim, and final 
cause of the same: and when we attain that end, the delight we 
have thereby is called the fruition : so that bonum and finis are 
different names, but for different considerations of the same 
thing. 
5. And of ends, some of them are called propingui, that is, 
near at hand; others remoti, far off: but when the ends that be 
nearer attaining, be compared with those that be further off, 
they are called not ends, but means, and the way to those. But 
for an utmost end, in which the ancient philosophers have placed 
felicity, and disputed much concerning the way thereto, there 
is no such thing in this world, nor way to it, more than to 
Utopia: for while we live, we have desires, and desire presup- 
poseth a further end. Those things which please us, as the way 
or means to a further end, we call profit and the fruition of 
them, use; and those things that profit not, vain. : 
6. Seeing all delight is appetite, and presupposeth a further 
end, there can be no contentment but in proceeding : and there- 
fore we are not to marvel, when we see, that as men attain to 
more riches, honour, or other power; so their appetite continu- 
ally groweth more and more; and when they are come to the
-P-A-G-E-187
  
HUMAN NATURE 165 
utmost degree of some kind of power, they pursue some other, 
as long as in any kind they think themselves behind any other: 
of those therefore that have attained to the highest degree of 
honour and riches, some have affected mastery in some art; as 
Nero in music and poetry, Commodus in the art of a gladiator; 
and such as affect not some such thing, must find diversion and 
recreation of their thoughts in the contention either of play or 
business: and men justly complain of a great grief, that they 
know not what to do. Felicity, therefore, by which we mean 
continual delight, consisteth not in having prospered, but in 
prospering. 
7. There are few things in this world, but either have mixture 
of good and evil, or there is a chain of them so necessarily linked 
together, that the one cannot be taken without the other: as for 
example, the pleasures of sin, and the bitterness of punishment, 
are inseparable; as is also labour and honour, for the most part. 
Now when in the whole chain, the greater part is good, the whole 
is called good; and when the evil over-weigheth, the whole is called 
evil. 
8. There are two sorts of pleasure, whereof the one seemeth 
to affect the corporeal organ of the sense, and that I call sensual; 
the greatest part whereof, is that by which we are invited to give 
continuance to our species; and the next, by which a man is 
invited to meat, for the preservation of his individual person: 
the other sort of delight is not particular to any part of the body, 
and is called the delight of the mind, and is that which we call 
joy. Likewise of pains, some affect the body, and are therefore 
called the pains of the body; and some no, and those are called 
grief. 
CHAPTER XII. THE WILL 
1. Ir hath been declared already, how eternal objects cause 
conceptions, and conceptions, appetite and fear, which are the 
Sirst unperceived beginnings of our actions; for either the actions 
immediately follow the first appetite, as when we do anything 
upon a sudden; or else to our first appetite there succeedeth 
some conception of evil to happen to us by such actions, which  
-P-A-G-E-188
  166 THOMAS HOBBES 
is fear, and which holdeth us from peocdding. And to that fear 
may succeed a new appetite, and to that appetite another fear 
alternately, till the action be either done, or some accident come 
between, to make it impossible; and so this alternate appetite 
and fear ceaseth. This alternate succession of appetite and fear 
during all the time the action is in our power to do or not to do, 
is that we call deliberation; which name hath been given it for 
that part of the definition wherein it is said that it lasteth so long 
as the action, whereof we deliberate, is in our power: for, so 
long we have liberty to do or not to do; and deliberation signi- 
fieth a taking away of our own liberty. 
2. Deliberation therefore requireth in the action deliberated 
two conditions; one, that it be future; the other, that there be 
hope of doing it, or possibility of not doing it; for, appetite and 
fear are expectations of the future; and there is no expectation of 
good, without hope; or of evil, without possibility: of necessaries 
therefore there is 2o deliberation. In deliberation, the last appe- 
tite, as also the last fear, is called will, viz. the last appetite, 
will to do, or will to omit. It is all one therefore to say will and 
last will; for, though a man express his present inclination and 
appetite concerning the disposing of his goods, by words or 
writings; yet shall it not be counted his will, because he hath 
still liberty to dispose of them other ways: but when death taketh 
away that liberty, then it is his will. 
3. Voluntary actions and omissions are such as have begin- 
ning in the will; all other are involuntary, or mixed voluntary; 
involuntary, such as he doth by necessity of nature, as when he 
is pushed, or falleth, and thereby doth good or hurt to another: 
mixed, such as participate of both; as when a man is carried to 
prison, going is voluntary, to the prison, is involuntary: the 
example of him that throweth his goods out of a ship into the 
sea, to save his person, is of an action altogether voluntary: for, 
there is nothing therein involuntary, but the hardness of the 
choice, which is not his action, but the action of the winds: 
what he himself doth, is no more against his will, than to flee 
from danger is against the will of him that seeth no other means 
to preserve himself.

HUMAN NATURE 167 
4. Voluntary also are the actions that proceed from sudden 
anger, or other sudden appetite in such men as can discern good 
or evil: for, in them the time precedent is to be judged delibera- 
tion: for then also he deliberateth in what cases it is good to 
strike, deride, or do any other action proceeding from anger or 
other such sudden passion. 
5. Appetite, fear, hope, and the rest of the passions are not 
called voluntary; for they proceed not from, but are the will; and 
the will is not voluntary: for, a man can no more say he will 
will, then he will will will, and so make an infinite repetition of 
the word [will]; which is absurd, and insignificant. 
6. Forasmuch as will to do is appetite, and will to omit, fear; . 
the cause of appetite and fear is the cause also of our will: but 
the propounding of the benefits and of harms, that is to say, of 
reward and punishment, is the cause of our appetite, and of our 
fears, and therefore also of our wills, so far forth as we believe 
that such rewards and benefits as are propounded, shall arrive 
unto us; and consequently, our wills follow our opinions, as our 
actions follow our wills; in which sense they say truly, and pro- | 
perly, that say the world is governed by opinion. | 
7. When the wills of many concur to one and the same action 
and effect, this concourse of their wills is called consent; by which ? 
we must not understand one will of many men, for every man | 
hath his several will, but many wills to the producing of one | 
effect: but when the wills of two divers men produce such ac- 
tions as are reciprocally resistant one to the other, this is called 
contention; and, being upon the persons one of another, baitile: | 
whereas actions proceeding from consent, are mutual aid. 
8. When many wills are involved or included in the will of 
one or more consenting, (which how it may be, shall be here- 
after declared) then is that involving of many wills in one or 
more, called union. 
g. In deliberations interrupted, as they may be by diversion 
of other business, or by sleep, the last appetite of such part of 
the deliberation is called intention, or purpose.

Passion, as respects the subject, is always action in some other 
respect. s 
Tuer is nothing which better shows how defective the sci- 
ences are which we have received from the ancients than what 
they have written upon the passions; for, although it is a sub- 
ject the knowledge of which has always been much sought after, 
and which does not appear to be one of the more difficult sci- 
ences, because everyone, feeling the passions in himself, stands 
in no need whatever of borrowing any observation elsewhere to 
discover their nature, nevertheless, what the ancients have 
taught on this subject is of such slight intent, and for the 
most part sc untrustworthy, that I cannot have any hope of 
reaching the truth, except by abandoning the paths which they 
have followed. That is the reason why I shall be obliged to 
write now in the same way as I should if I were treating a topic 
which no one before me had ever touched upon; and, to begin 
with, I take into consideration the fact that an event is gener- 
ally spoken of by philosophers as a passion as regards the sub- 
ject to which it happens, and an action in respect to that which 
causes it; so that, although the agent and the patient may often

THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL 169 
be very different, action and passion are always one and the 
same thing, which has these two names because of the two 
different subjects to which it can be referred. 
ARTICLE II 
In order to understand the passions of the soul, it is necessary 
to distinguish its functions from those of the body. 
Next I take into consideration that we know of no subject 
which acts more immediately upon our soul than the body to 
which it is joined, and that consequently we must think that 
what in the one is a passion is commonly in the other an ac- 
tion; so that there is no better path to the knowledge of our 
passions than to examine into the difference between the soul 
and the body, in order to know to which of them is to be 
attributed each of our functions.t 
ArtIcLe III 
The rule to be observed to this end. 
No great difficulty will be found in this, if it be borne in mind 
that all that which we experience in ourselves which we see can 
also take place in bodies entirely inanimate is to be attributed 
only to our body; and, on the contrary, all that which is in us 
and which we cannot conceive in any manner possible to pertain 
to a body is to be attributed to our soul. 
ARTICLE IV 
That heat and the movement of the limbs proceed from the body, 
thoughts from the mind. 
Thus, because we cannot conceive that the body thinks in 
any manner whatever, we have no reason but to think that all 
forms of thought which are in us belong to the mind; and be- 
cause we cannot doubt that there are inanimate bodies which 
can move in as many or more different ways than ours, and _

Principles. Translated by John Veitch. Edin., 1850, etc.
-P-A-G-E-192
  170 RENE DESCARTES 
which have as much or more heat (as experience teaches us in 
the case of flame, which alone has more heat and motion than 
any of our members), we must believe that all the heat and all 
the motions which are in us, in so far as they do not depend at 
all on thought, belong only to the body. 
ARTICLE V 
That it is an error to think that the soul imparts motion and heat 
to the body. 
By this means we shall avoid a very great error, into which 
many have fallen, an error which I consider to be the principal 
hindrance, up to the present time, to a correct explanation of 
the passions and other properties of the soul. It consists in this, 
that, seeing that all dead bodies are deprived of heat and, conse- 
quently, of motion, it is imagined that the absence of the soul 
causes these movements and this heat to cease; and thus it has 
been thought, without reason, that our natural heat and all the 
motions of our body depend upon the soul; instead of which it 
should be thought, on the contrary, that soul departs, when 
death occurs, only because this heat fails and the organs which 
serve to move the body decay. 
ArTICLE VI 
The difference between a living and a dead body. 
In order, then, that we may avoid this error, let us consider 
that death never takes place through the absence of a soul, 
but solely because some one of the principal parts of the body 
has fallen into decay; and let us conclude that the body of a 
living man differs as much from that of a dead man as does a 
watch or other automaton (that is to say, or other machine 
which moves of itself), when it is wound up, and has within 
itself the material principle of the movements for which it is 
constructed, with all that is necessary for its action, from the 
same watch or other machine, when it has been broken, and the 
principle of its movement ceases to act.

Articte VII 
Brief explanation of the parts of the body and of some of its 
functions. ? 
In order to render this more intelligible, I will explain here 
in a few words how the entire mechanism of our body is com- 
posed. There is no one who does not already know that there 
is in us a heart, a brain, a stomach, muscles, nerves, arteries, 
veins, and such things; it is known also that the food we eat 
descends into the stomach and the bowels, where their juices 
flowing through the liver and through all the veins, mix them- 
selves with the blood they contain, and by this means increase 
its quantity. Those who have heard the least talk in medicine 
know, further, how the heart is constructed, and how all the 
blood of the veins can easily flow through the vena cava on its 
right side, and thence pass into the lung, by the vessel which is 
called the arterial vein, then return from the lung on the left 
side of the heart, by the vessel called the venous artery, and 
finally pass thence into the great artery, the branches of which 
are diffused through the whole body. Also, all those whom the 
authority of the ancients has not entirely blinded, and who are 
willing to open their eyes to examine the opinion of Herveeus? 
in regard to the circulation of the blood, have no doubt what- 
ever that all the veins and arteries of the body are merely chan- 
nels through which the blood flows without cessation and very 
rapidly, starting from the right cavity of the heart by the arte 
rial vein, the branches of which are dispersed throughout the 
lungs and joined to that of the venous artery, by which it passes 
from the lungs into the left side of the heart; next, from thence 
it passes into the great artery, the branches of which, scattered 
throughout all the rest of the body, are joined to the branches of 
the vein, which carry once more the same blood into the right 
cavity of the heart; so that these two cavities are like sluices, 
through each of which all the blood passes every time it makes 
the circuit of the body. Still further, it is known that all the

-P-A-G-E-194
  172 RENE DESCARTES 
movements of the limbs depend upon the muscles, and that 
these muscles are opposed to one another in such a way that, 
when one of them contracts, it draws toward itself the part of 
the body to which it is attached, which at the same time 
stretches out the muscle which is opposed to it; then, if it hap- 
pens, at another time, that this last contracts, it causes the first 
to lengthen, and draws toward itself the part to which they are 
attached. Finally, it is known that all these movements of the 
muscles, as also all the senses, depend upon the nerves, which 
are like minute threads, or small tubes, all of which come from 
the brain, and contain, like that, a certain subtle air or breath, 
which is called the animal spirits. 
ArticLe VIII 
The principle of all these functions. 
But it is not commonly known in what manner these animal 
spirits and these nerves contribute to the movements of the 
limbs and to the senses, nor what is the corporeal principle 
which makes them act; it is for this reason, although I have al- 
ready touched upon this matter in other writings,! I shall not 
omit to say here briefly, that, as long as we live, there is a con- 
tinual heat in our heart, which is a kind of fire kept up there by 
the blood of the veins, and that this fire is the corporeal prin- 
ciple of the movements of our limbs. . . . 
ARTICLE XVI 
How all the limbs can be moved by the objects of the senses and by 
the spirits without the aid of the soul. 
Finally, it is to be observed that the machine of our body is so 
constructed that all the changes which occur in the motion of 
the spirits may cause them to open certain pores of the brain 
rather than others, and, reciprocally, that when any one of 
these pores is opened in the least degree more or less than is 
usual by the action of the nerves which serve the senses, this 
changes somewhat the motion of the spirits, and causes them

-P-A-G-E-195
  THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL 173 
to be conducted into the muscles which serve to move the body 
in the way in which it is commonly moved on occasion of such 
action; so that all the movements which we make without our 
will contributing thereto (as frequently happens when we 
breathe, or walk, or eat, and, in fine, perform all those actions 
which are common to us and the brutes) depend only on the 
conformation of our limbs and the course which the spirits, 
excited by the heat of the heart, naturally follow in the brain, 
in the nerves, and in the muscles, in the same way that the 
movement of a watch is produced by the force solely of its 
mainspring and the form of its wheels. . . . 
ARTICLE XXX 
That the soul is united to all parts of the body conjointly. 
But, in order to understand all these things more perfectly, 
it is necessary to know that the soul is truly joined to the entire 
body, and that it cannot properly be said to be in any one of its 
parts to the exclusion of the rest, because the body is one, and in 
a manner indivisible, on account of the arrangement of its or- 
gans, which are so related to one another, that when any one 
of them is taken away, that makes the whole body defective: 
and because the soul is of a nature which has no relation to ex- 
tension, or to dimensions, or other properties of the matter of 
which the body is composed, but solely to the whole collection 
of its organs, as appears from the fact that we cannot at all 
conceive of the half or the third of a soul, nor what space it 
occupies, and that it does not become any smaller when any 
part of the body is cut off, but that it separates itself entirely 
from it when the combination of its organs is broken up. 
ARTICLE XXXI 
That there is a small gland in the brain in which the soul 
exercises its functions more particularly than im the other 
paris. 
It is, also, necessary to know that, although the soul is joined 
to the entire body, there is, nevertheless, a certain part of the
-P-A-G-E-196
174 RENE DESCARTES 
body in which it exercises its functions more particularly than 
in all the rest; and it is commonly thought that this part is the 
brain, or, perhaps, the heart: the brain, because to it the organs 
of sense are related; and the heart, because it is as if there the 
passions are felt. But, after careful examination, it seems to me 
quite evident that the part of the body in which the soul im- 
mediately exercises its functions is neither the heart, nor even 
the brain as a whole, but solely the most interior part of it, 
which isa certain very small gland, situated in the middle of its 
substance, and so suspended above the passage by which the 
spirits of its anterior cavities communicate with those of the 
posterior, that the slightest motions in it may greatly affect the 
course of these spirits, and, reciprocally, that the slightest 
changes which take place in the course of the spirits may 
greatly affect the motions of this gland. 
ARTICLE XXXII 
How this gland is known to be the principal seat of the soul. 
The reason which convinces me that the soul cannot have in 
the whole body any other place than this gland where it exer- 
cises its functions immediately, is the consideration that the 
other parts of our brain are all double, just as also we have two 
eyes, two hands, two ears, and, in fine, all the organs of our 
external senses are double; and inasmuch as we have but one 
single and simple thought of the same thing at the same time, 
there must necessarily be some place where the two images 
which by means of the two eyes, or the two other impressions 
which come from a single object by means of the double organs 
of the other senses, may unite in one before they reach the 
mind, in order that they may not present to it two objects in 
place of one; and it may easily be conceived that these images 
or other impressions unite in this gland, through the medium 
of the spirits which fill the cavities of the brain; but there 
is no other place whatever in the whole body, where they can 
thus be united, except as they have first been united in this 
gland.
-P-A-G-E-197
THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL 175 
Letter to Mersenne, July 30, 16401 
As for the letter of the physician De Sens, it contains no argu- 
ment to impugn what I have written upon the gland called 
conarium, except that he says that it can be changed like all the 
brain, which does not at all prevent its being the principal seat 
of the soul; for it is certain that the soul must be joined to some 
part of the body, and there is no point which is not as much or 
more liable to alteration than this gland, which, although it is 
very small and very soft, nevertheless, on account of its situa- 
tion, is so well protected, that it can be almost as little subject 
to any disease as the crystalline humor of the eye; and it hap- 
pens more frequently indeed that persons become troubled in 
mind, without any known cause, in which case it may be assigned 
to some disorder of this gland, than it happens that sight fails 
by any defect of this crystalline humor, besides that all the 
other changes which happen to the mind, as when one falls asleep 
after drinking, etc., may be ascribed to some changes occurring 
in this gland. 
As for what he says about the mind’s being able to make use 
of double organs, I agree with him, and that it makes use also 
of the spirits, all of which cannot reside in this gland; but I do 
not at all conceive that the mind is so restricted to it that it 
cannot extend its activity beyond it; but it is one thing to make 
use of, and another thing to be immediately joined and united 
to it; and our mind not being double, but one and indivisible, 
it seems to me that the part of the body to which it is most 
immediately united must also be one and not divided into two 
similar parts, and I find nothing of that kind in the whole brain 
except this gland. 
ARTICLE XXXIII 
That the seat of the passions is not in the heart. 
As for the opinion of those who think that the soul experi- 
ences its passions in the heart, it is of no great account, because 
it is founded only on the fact that the passions cause some stir 
1 Eurres, t. viii, p. 301. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
176 RENE DESCARTES 
to be felt there; and it is easy to see that this change is felt, as if 
in the heart, only through the medium of a small nerve, which 
descends to it from the brain, just as pain is felt as if in the foot 
through the medium of the nerves of the foot, and the stars are 
perceived as in the heavens by the medium of their light and the 
optic nerves; so that it is no more necessary that our soul exer- 
cise its functions immediately in the heart in order to feel there 
its passions, than it is necessary that it should be in the heavens 
in order to see the stars there. 
ARTICLE XXXIV 
How the soul and the body act one upon the other. 
Let us conceive, then, that the soul has its principal seat in 
this little gland in the middle of the brain, whence it radiates 
to all the rest of the body by means of the spirits, the nerves, 
and even of the blood, which, participating in the impressions 
of the mind, can carry them by means of the arteries into all the 
members; and, bearing in mind what has been said above con- 
cerning the machine of our body, to wit, that the minute fila- 
ments of our nerves are so distributed throughout all its parts 
that, on occasion of the different motions which are excited there 
by means of sensible objects, they open in divers manners the 
pores of the brain, which causes the animal spirits contained in 
these cavities to enter in various ways into the muscles, by 
means of which they can move the limbs in all the different ways 
of which they are capable, and, also, that all the other causes, 
which in other ways can set the spirits in motion, have the effect 
to turn them upon various muscles [keeping all this in mind], 
let us add here that the little gland which is the principal seat 
of the soul is so suspended between the cavities which contain 
the spirits, that it can be affected by them in all the different 
ways that there are sensible differences in objects; but that it 
can also be variously affected by the soul, which is of such a 
nature that it receives as many different impressions — that is 
to say, that it has as many different perceptions — as there 
occur different motions in this gland; as also, reciprocally, the
-P-A-G-E-199
THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL 177 
machine of the body is so composed that from the simple fact 
that this gland is variously affected by the soul, or by whatever 
other cause, it impels the spirits which surround it toward 
the pores of the brain, which discharge them by means of the 
nerves upon the muscles, whereby it causes them to move the 
limbs. .. . 
ARTICLE XL 
The principal effect of the passions. 
It is to be noted that the principal effect of all the passions in 
man is that they incite and dispose the mind to will the things 
to which they prepare the body, so that the sentiment of fear 
incites it to will to fly; that of courage, to will to fight; and so of 
the rest. | 
ArticLte XLI 
The power of the mind over the body. 
But the will is so free in its nature that it can never be con- 
strained; and of the two kinds of thoughts which I have dis- 
tinguished in the mind — of which one is its actions, that is, its 
volitions; the other its passions, taking this word in its most 
general signification, comprehending all sort of perceptions — 
the first of these are absolutely in its power, and can be changed 
only indirectly by the body, while, on the contrary, the last 
depend absolutely on the.movements which give rise to them, 
and they can be affected only indirectly by the mind, except 
when it is itself the cause of them. And the whole action of the 
mind consists in this, that by the simple fact of its willing any- 
thing it causes the little gland, to which it is closely joined, to 
produce the result appropriate to the volition. 
ARTICLE XLII 
  How the things we wish to recall are found in the memory. 
Thus, when the mind wills to recall anything, this volition 
causes the gland, by inclining successively to different sides, to 
impel the spirits toward different parts of the brain until they
-P-A-G-E-200
  178 RENE DESCARTES 
come upon that where the traces are left of the thing it wills to 
remember; for these traces are due to nothing else than the 
circumstance that the pores of the brain, through which the 
spirits have already taken their course, on presentation of that 
object, have thereby acquired a greater facility than the rest 
to be opened again in the same way by the spirits which come 
to them; so that these spirits coming upon these pores, enter 
therein more readily than into the others, by which means they 
excite a particular motion in the gland, which represents to the 
mind the same object, and causes it to recognize that it is that 
which it willed to remember. 
Articte XLII 
How the mind can imagine, attend, and move the body. 
Thus, when it is desired to imagine something which has 
never been seen, the will has the power to cause the gland to 
move in the manner requisite to impel the spirits toward the 
pores of the brain by the opening of which that thing can be 
represented; so, when one wills to keep his attention fixed for 
some time upon the same object, this volition keeps the gland 
inclined during that time in the same direction; so, finally, when 
one wills to walk or to move his body in any way, this volition 
causes the gland to impel the spirits toward the muscles which 
serve that purpose. 
ARTICLE XLIV 
That each volition is naturally connected with some motion of 
the gland, but that, by intention or by habit, the will may be con- 
nected with others. 
Nevertheless, it is not always the volition to excite within us 
a certain motion, or other effect, which is the cause of its being 
excited; but this varies according as nature or habit has vari- 
ously united each motion of the gland to each thought. Thus, 
for example, if one desires to adjust his eyes to look at a very 
distant object, this volition causes the pupil of the eye to ex- 
pand, and if he desires to adjust them so as to see an object very
-P-A-G-E-201
ee ae 
THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL 179 
near, this volition makes it contract; but if he simply thinks of 
expanding the pupil, he wills in vain — the pupil will not ex- 
pand for that, inasmuch as nature had not connected the mo- 
tion of the gland, which serves to impel the spirits toward the 
optic nerve in the manner requisite for expanding or contract- 
ing the pupil, with the volition to expand or contract, but with 
that of looking at objects distant or near. And when, in talking, 
we think only of the meaning of what we wish to say, that 
makes us move the tongue and lips much more rapidly and 
better than if we thought to move them in all ways requisite 
for the utterance of the same words, inasmuch as the habit we 
have acquired in learning to talk has made us join the action of 
the mind — which, through the medium of the gland, can 
move the tongue and the lips — with the meaning of the words 
which follow these motions rather than with the motions them- 
selves... .. 
ArTICLE XLVII 
Wherein consist the conflicts which are imagined to exist between 
the inferior and the superior parts of the soul. 
It is only in the opposition between the motions that the body 
through the spirits, and the soul through the will, tend to excite 
at the same timein the gland, that all the conflicts consist which 
are commonly imagined to arise between the inferior part of the 
soul, which is called sensitive, and the superior part, which is 
rational, or rather between the natural appetites and the will; 
for there is but one soul within us, and that soul has in it no 
diversity of parts whatever; the same which is sensitive is ra- 
tional, and all its appetites are volitions. The error which is 
committed in making it play the parts of different persons com- 
monly opposed to each other arises only from the want of a 
right distinction of its functions from those of the body, to 
which is to be attributed all that which may be observed within 
us to be hostile to our reason, so that there is in this no other 
conflict whatever, except that the little gland which is in the 
middle of the brain may be pushed on the one side by the soul 
   
-P-A-G-E-202
  180 RENE DESCARTES 
and on the other by the animal spirits, which are only corporeal, 
as I have said above, and it often happens that these two im- 
pulses are contrary, and the stronger hinders the effect of the 
other. Now there may be distinguished two kinds of motion 
excited by the spirits in the gland; the one represents to the soul 
the objects which move the senses, or the impressions which 
meet in the brain, and produce no effect upon the will; the other 
kind is those which produce some effect upon it, namely, those 
which cause the passions or the movements of the body which 
accompany them; and as for the first, although they often 
hinder the actions of the soul, or perhaps may be hindered by 
them, nevertheless, because they are not directly opposed, no 
conflict is observed. ... 
PART II 
ArticLe LI 
The primary causes of the passions. 
Ir is understood, from what has been said above, that the 
last and proximate cause of the passions of the soul is nothing 
but the motion imparted by the spirits to the little gland in the 
middle of the brain. But this is not enough to enable us to dis- 
tinguish them from one another; it is necessary to trace them 
to their sources and to inquire into their primary causes; now, 
although they may sometimes be caused by the action of the 
mind, which determines to think upon such or such objects, 
and also by the mere bodily temperament or by the impressions 
which happen to present themselves in the brain, as occurs when 
one feels sad or joyous without being able to assign any reason 
for it, it should appear, nevertheless, according to what has been 
said, that the same passions may all be excited by objects which 
move the senses, and that these objects are their most ordinary 
and principal causes; whence it follows that, to discover 
them all, it is sufficient to consider all the effects of these 
objects.
-P-A-G-E-203
    THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL 181 
Articte LIT 
What service they render, and how their number may be deter- 
mined. 
I observe, further, that the objects which move the senses do 
not excite in us different passions by reason of all the diversities 
which are in them, but solely on account of the different ways 
in which they can injure or profit us, or, in general, be import- 
ant to us; and that the service which all the passions render 
consists in this alone, that they dispose the mind to choose the 
things which nature teaches us are useful, and to persist in this 
choice, while also the same motion of the spirits which com- 
monly causes them disposes the body to the movements which 
serve to the performance of those things; this is why, in order to 
determine the number of the passions, it is necessary merely to 
inquire, in due order, how many different ways important to 
us there are in which our senses can be moved by their objects; 
and I shall here make the enumeration of all the principal pas- 
sions in the order in which they may thus be found. 
ArticLe LIII 
Wonder. 
When on first meeting an object we are surprised, and judge 
it to be novel, or very different from what we knew it before, or 
from what we supposed it should be, this causes us to wonder at 
it and be astonished; and since this may happen before we could 
know whether this object was beneficial to us or not, it seems 
to me that wonder is the first of all the passions; and it has no 
contrary, because, if the object which presents itself has no- 
thing in it which surprises us, we are not at all moved by it, 
and we regard it without emotion. 
Articte LXVIII 
Why this enumeration of the passions differs from that com- 
monly received. 
Suchis the order which seems to me the best in enumerating 
the passions. I know very well that in this my position is differ-
-P-A-G-E-204
182 RENE DESCARTES 
ent from that of all who have hitherto written upon them, but 
it is so not without important reason. For they derive their 
enumeration from their distinction in the sensitive part of the 
soul of two appetites, one of which they call concupiscible, the 
other irascible.1 And, inasmuch as I recognize in the soul no 
distinction of parts, as I have said above, this seems to me to 
signify nothing else but that it has two faculties: one of desiring, 
the other of being angry; and because it has in the same way 
the faculties of admiring, of loving, of hoping, of fearing, and of 
entertaining each of the other passions, or of performing the 
actions to which these passions incline it, I do not see why they 
have chosen to refer all to desire or to anger. Moreover, their 
enumeration does not include all the principal passions, as I 
believe this does. I speak only of the principal ones, because 
there may still be distinguished many other more special ones, 
and their number is indefinite. 
ArTIcLE LXIX 
That there are only six primary passions. 
But the number of those which are simple and primary is not 
very great. For, on reviewing all those which I have enumer- 
ated, it is readily observed that there are only six of this sort; to 
wit, wonder, love, hate, desire, joy, and sadness, and that all 
the rest are made up of some of these six, or at least are species 
of them. This is why, in order that their number may not em- 
barrass my readers, I shall here treat separately of the six 
primaries; and afterward I shall show how all the rest derive 
their origin from these. 
ArtTIcLE LXXIV 
In what respect the passions are of service and in what they are 
harmful. 
Now it is easy to see, from what has been said above, that the 
usefulness of all the passions consists only in this, that they 
strengthen and make enduring in the mind the thoughts which 
1 Plato, Republic, bk. iv.
-P-A-G-E-205
  THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL 183 
it is well for it to keep, and which but for that might easily be 
effaced from it. As, also, all the evil they can cause consists in 
their strengthening and preserving those thoughts in the mind 
more than there is any need of, or else that they strengthen and 
preserve others which it is not well for the mind to attend to. 
ArticLE LXXIX 
Definitions of love and hatred. 
Love is an emotion of the soul, caused by the motion of the 
spirits, which incites it to unite itself voluntarily to those ob- 
jects which appear to it to be agreeable. And hatred is an emo- 
tion, caused by the spirits, which incites the mind to will to be 
separated from objects which present themselves to it as harm- 
ful. Isay that these emotions are caused by the spirits, in order 
to distinguish love and hatred, which are passions, and depend 
upon the body, as well as the judgments which also incline the 
mind to unite itself voluntarily with the things which it regards 
as good, and to separate itself from those which it regards as 
evil, as the emotions which these judgments excite in the soul. 
ArticLE LXXX 
What is meant by voluntary union and separation. 
For the rest, by the word voluntarily, I do not here intend 
desire, which is a passion by itself, and relates to the future, but 
the consent wherein one considers himself for the moment as 
united with the beloved object, conceiving as it were of one 
whole of which he thinks himself but one part, and the object 
beloved the other. While on the contrary, in the case of hatred, 
one considers himself alone as a whole, entirely separated from 
the object for which he has aversion. 
ArticLE LXXXVI 
Definition of desire. 
The passion of desire is an agitation of the soul, caused by the 
spirits, which disposes it to wish for the future the. objects which
-P-A-G-E-206
  184 RENE DESCARTES 
it represents to itself to be agreeable. Thus one desires not only 
the presence of absent good, but also the preservation of the 
present good, and, in addition, the absence of evil, as well that 
which is already experienced as that which it is feared the 
future may bring. 
ArTIcLE XCI 
Definition of joy. 
Joy is an agreeable emotion of the soul in which consists 
the enjoyment that it has in any good which the impressions of 
the brain represent to it as its own. I say that it is in this emo- 
tion that the enjoyment of good consists, for in reality the soul 
receives no other fruit of all the goods it possesses; and so long 
as it has no joy in them, it may be said that it has no more frui- 
tion of them than if it did not possess them at all. Iadd, also, 
that it is of good which the impressions of the brain represent 
to it as its own, in order not to confound this joy, which is a 
passion, with the purely intellectual joy, which arises in the 
mind by the simple activity of the mind, and which may be 
said to be an agreeable emotion excited within itself, in which 
consists the enjoyment which it has of the good which its 
understanding represents to it as it own. It is true that, so 
long as the mind is joined to the body, this intellectual joy can 
scarcely fail to be accompanied with that joy which is passion; 
for, as soon as our understanding perceives that we possess 
any good, although that good may be as different as imagin- 
able from all that pertains to the body, the imagination does 
not fail on the instant to make an impression on the brain, 
upon which follows the motion of the spirits which excites the 
passion of joy. 
ArticLe XCII 
Definition of sadness. 
Sadness is a disagreeable languor, in which consists the dis- 
tress which the mind experiences from the evil or the defect 
which the impressions of the brain represent as pertaining to it. 
And there is also an intellectual sadness, which is not the 
passion, but which seldom fails to be accompanied by it.
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL 185 
ArTICLE XCVI 
The motions of the blood and the spirits which cause these five 
passions. 
The five passions which I have here begun to explain are so 
joined or opposed to one another, that it is easier to consider 
them all together than to treat of each separately (as wonder 
has been treated); and the cause of them is not as is the case 
with wonder, in the brain alone, but also in the heart, the spleen, 
the liver, and in all other parts of the body, in so far as they 
serve in the production of the blood, and thereby of the spirits; 
for although all the veins conduct the blood they contain toward 
the heart, it happens, nevertheless, that sometimes the blood in 
some of them is impelled thither with more force than that in 
others; it happens, also, that the openings by which it enters 
into the heart, or else those by which it passes out, are more 
enlarged or more contracted at one time than at another. . . . 
ARTICLE CXXXVII 
Of the utility of these five passions here explained, in so far as 
they relate to the body. 
Having given the definitions of love, of hatred, of desire, of 
joy, of sadness (and treated of all the corporeal movements 
which cause or accompany them!) we have only to consider 
here their utility. In regard to which it is to be noted that, 
according to the appointment of nature, they all relate to the 
body, and are bestowed upon the mind only in so far as it is 
connected with it; so that their natural use is to incite the mind 
to consent and contribute to the actions which may aid in the 
preservation of the body, or render it in any way more perfect; 
and, in this sense, sadness and joy are the first two which are 
employed. For the mind is immediately warned of the things 
which harm the body only through the sensation of pain, which 
produces in it first the passion of sadness; next, hatred of that 
which causes this pain; and thirdly, the desire to be delivered 
1 In the intervening Articles.
-P-A-G-E-208
sign i ty oa i ke a ea a is a i a i a a 
186 RENE DESCARTES 
from it; likewise the mind is made aware immediately of things 
useful to the body only by some sort of pleasure, which excites 
in it joy, then gives birth to love of that which is believed to be 
the cause of it, and, finally, the desire to acquire that which can 
make the joy continue, or else that the like may be enjoyed 
again. Whence it is apparent that these five passions are all 
very useful as regards the body, and also that sadness is, in a 
certain way, first and more necessary than joy, and hatred than 
love, because it is more important to repel things which harm 
and may destroy us, than to acquire those which add a per- 
fection without which we can still subsist. . . . 
ARTICLE CXLIV 
Of desires where the issue depends only on ourselves. 
But because the passions can impel us to action only through 
the medium of the desire which we must take pains to regulate 
— andin this consists the principal use of morality; now, as I 
have just said, as it is always good when it follows a true know- 
ledge, so it cannot fail to be bad when it is based on error. And 
it seems to me that the error most commonly committed in 
regard to desires is the failure to distinguish sufficiently the 
things which depend entirely upon ourselves and those which 
do not; for, as for those which depend only upon ourselves, that 
is to say, upon our free will, it is sufficient to know that they are 
good to make it impossible for us to desire them with too great 
ardor, since to do the good things which depend upon ourselves 
is to follow virtue, and it is certain that one’cannot have too 
ardent a desire for virtue, and moreover, it being impossible 
for us to fail of success in what we desire in this way, since it 
depends on ourselves alone, we shall always attain all the satis- 
faction that we have expected. But the most common fault 
in this matter is not that too much, but too little, is desired; 
and the sovereign remedy against that is to deliver the mind as 
much as possible from all other less useful desires, then to try 
to understand very clearly, and to consider attentively, the 
excellence of that which is to be desired.
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL 187 
ArticLE CXLV 
Of those which depend only on other things. 
As for the things which depend in no wise upon ourselves, 
however good they may be, they should never be desired with 
passion; not only because they may not come to pass, and in 
that case we should be so much the more cast down, as we have 
the more desired them, but principally because by occupying 
our thoughts they divert our interest from other things the 
acquisition of which depends upon ourselves. And there are 
two general remedies for these vain desires; the first is high- 
mindedness (la générosité), of which I shall speak presently; the 
second is frequent meditation on Divine Providence, with the 
reflection that it is impossible that anything should happen in 
any other manner than has been determined from all eternity 
by this Providence; so that it is like a destiny or an immutable 
necessity, which is to be contrasted with chance in order to 
destroy it as a chimera arising only from an error of our under- 
standing. For we can desire only those things which we regard 
as being in some way possible, and we do not regard as possible 
things which do not at all depend upon ourselves, except in so 
far as we think that they depend on chance, that is to say, as we 
judge that they can happen, and that similar things have hap- 
pened before. Now this opinion is based only on the fact that 
we do not know all the causes which have contributed to each 
effect; for when anything which we have thought depended 
upon chance has not taken place, this shows that some one of 
the causes necessary to produce it was wanting, and, conse- 
quently, that it was absolutely impossible, and the like of it 
never took place; that is to say, to the production of the like a 
similar cause was also wanting, so that, had we not been igno- 
rant of that beforehand, we never should have thought it pos- 
sible, and consequently should not have desired it. 
ArTIcLE CXLVI 
Of those things which depend upon ourselves and others. 
It is necessary then utterly to reject the common opinion
-P-A-G-E-210
  188 ‘RENE DESCARTES 
that there is externally to ourselves a chance which causes 
things to happen or not to happen, at its pleasure, and to know, 
on the other hand, that everything is guided by Divine Provi- 
dence, whose eternal decree is so infallible and immutable, that, 
excepting the things which the same decree has willed to depend 
upon our free choice, we must think that in regard to us nothing 
happens which is not necessary, and, as it were, destined, so that 
we cannot, without folly, wish it to happen otherwise. But 
because most of our desires extend to things, all of which do not 
depend upon ourselves, nor all of them upon others, we should 
distinguish precisely that in them which depends only on our- 
selves in order to confine our desires to that; and, moreover, 
although we should consider success therein to be altogether a 
matter of immutable destiny, in order that our desires may not 
be taken up with it, we ought not to fail to consider the reasons 
which make it more or less to be hoped for, to the end that they 
may serve to regulate our conduct; as, for example, if we had 
business in a certain place to which we might go by two different 
roads, one of which was ordinarily much safer than the other, 
although perhaps the decree of Providence was such that if 
we went by the road considered safest we should certainly be 
robbed, and that, on the contrary, we might travel the other 
with no danger at all, we ought not on that account to be indif- 
ferent in choosing between them, nor rest on the immutable 
destiny of that decree; but reason would have it that we should 
choose the road which was ordinarily considered the safer, and 
our desire should be satisfied regarding that when we have fol- 
lowed it, whatever be the evil that happens to us, because that 
evil, being as regards ourselves inevitable, we have had no rea- 
son to desire to be exempt from it, but simply to do the very 
best that our understanding is able to discover, as I assume we 
have done. And it is certain that when one thus makes a prac- 
tice of distinguishing destiny from chance, he easily accustoms 
himself so to regulate his desires that, in so far as their accom- 
plishment depends only upon himself, they may always afford 
him entire satisfaction. 
   
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL 189 
ARTICLE CXLVII 
Of the interior emotions of the mind. 
I will simply add a consideration which appears to me of 
much service in averting from us the disturbance of the pas- 
sions: it is that our good and our evil principally depend upon 
the interior emotions, which are excited in the mind only by the 
mind itself, in which respect they differ from its passions, which 
always depend upon some motion of the spirits; and although 
these emotions of the mind are often united with the passions 
which resemble them, they may often also agree with others, 
and even arise from those which are contrary to them... . 
And when we read of strange adventures in a book, or see them 
represented on the stage, this excites in us sometimes sadness, 
sometimes joy, or love, or hatred, and, in general, all the pas- 
sions, according to the diversity of the objects which present 
themselves to our imagination; but along with that we have 
the pleasure of feeling them excited within us, and this pleasure 
is an intellectual joy, which can arise from sadness as well as 
from any other passion.! 
ArtTIcLE CXLVIII 
That the practice of virtue is a sovereign remedy for all the 
passions. 
Now, inasmuch as these interior emotions touch us more 
nearly, and in consequence have much greater power over us 
than the passions from which they differ, which occur with them, 
itis certain that, provided the mind have that within wherewith 
it may be content, all the troubles which come from elsewhere 
have no power whatever to disturb it, but rather serve to aug- 
ment its joy, in that, seeing that it cannot be troubled by them, 
it is thereby made aware of its own superiority. And to the end 
that the mind may have that wherewith to be content, it needs 
but to follow virtue perfectly. For whoever has lived in such a 
manner that his conscience cannot reproach him with ever 
1 Cf. Aristotle, Poetics, 6.
-P-A-G-E-212
  190 RENE DESCARTES 
having failed to do any of those things which he has judged to 
be the best (which is what I call here following virtue), he en- 
joys a satisfaction so potent in ministering to his happiness, 
that the most violent efforts of the passions never have power 
enough to disturb the tranquillity of his mind.

PART II. OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF 
THE MIND 
I now proceed to set forth those things that necessarily had 
to follow from the essence of God, a Being eternal and infinite. 
I shall not, indeed, treat of all of them, for I have shown (I, 16) 
that there must follow from this essence an infinity of things in 
infinite ways, but I shall treat only of those which may lead us, 
as it were, by the hand, to a knowledge of the human mind and 
its highest blessedness. 
Definitions 
1. By body I mean a mode which expresses, in a definite and 
determinate manner, the essence of God, in so far as he is con- 
sidered as an extended thing. (See I, 25, cor.) 
2. I regard as belonging to the essence of a thing that which, 
being given, the thing is necessarily given, and which being 
taken away, the thing is necessarily taken away; in other words, 
that without which the thing, and, conversely, which without 
the thing, can neither be nor be conceived. 
3. By idea I mean a conception of the mind, which the mind 
forms because it is a thinking thing.

-P-A-G-E-214
192 BARUCH DE SPINOZA 
Explanation. —I say rather conception than perception, be- 
cause the word perception seems to indicate that the mind is 
acted upon by the object; but conception seems to express an 
action of the mind. 
4. By adequate idea I mean an idea which, in so far as it is 
considered in itself and without reference to an object, possesses 
all the properties or intrinsic marks of a true idea. 
Explanation. — I say intrinsic, to exclude the extrinsic mark, 
namely, the agreement of the idea with its object. 
5. Duration is indefinite continuance in existence. 
Explanation. — I say indefinite, because it can in no wise be 
limited by the nature itself of the existing thing, nor yet by the 
efficient cause, which, to be sure, necessarily brings about the 
existence of the thing, but does not sublate it. 
6. By reality and perfection I mean the same thing. 
7. By individual things I mean things that are finite and have 
a determinate existence. If, however, several individuals so 
unite in one action that all are conjointly the cause of the one 
effect, I consider all these, in so far, as one individual thing. 
Axioms 
1. Man’s essence does not involve necessary existence; in 
other words, in the order of nature, it equally well may or may 
not come to pass that this or that man exists. 
2. Man thinks. 
3. Such modes of thinking as love, desire, or whatever else 
comes under the head of emotion, do not arise unless there be 
present in the same individual the idea of the thing loved, 
desired, etc. But the idea may be present without any other 
mode of thinking being present. 
4. We perceive by sense that a certain body is affected in 
many ways. 
5. We do not feel or perceive any individual things except 
bodies and modes of thinking. 
Prop. 1. Thought is an attribute of God, that is, God is a think- 
ing thing.
-P-A-G-E-215
  
THE ETHICS 193 
Proof. — Individual thoughts, or this and that thought, are 
modes which express in a definite and determinate manner 
God’s nature (I, 25, cor.). God therefore possesses (I, def. 5) 
the attribute, the conception of which is involved in all indi- 
vidual thoughts, and through which they are conceived. Hence, 
thought is one of the infinite attributes of God, and it expresses 
God’s eternal and infinite essence (I, def. 6): that is, God is a 
thinking thing. Q. E. D. 
Scholium. — This proposition may also be proved from the 
fact that we can conceive an infinite thinking being. For the 
more thoughts a thinking being is capable of having, the more 
reality or perfection do we regard it as containing; a being, 
then, that can think an infinity of things in an infinity of ways 
is necessarily, by virtue of its thinking, infinite. Since, there- 
fore, we conceive an infinite being by fixing attention upon 
thought alone, thought is necessarily (I, defs. 4 and 6) one of the 
infinite attributes of God, as I asserted. 
Prop. 2. Extension is an aitribute of God, that is, God is an 
extended thing. 
Proof. — This is proved like the preceding proposition. 
Prop. 3. There is necessarily in God an idea, both of his own 
essence, and of all those things which necessarily follow from his 
essence. 
Proof. — God can (1) think an infinity of things in an infinity 
of ways, or (which is the same thing, I, 16) can form an idea of 
his own essence, and of all those things which necessarily follow 
from it. But everything that is within God’s power necessarily 
is (I, 35). Therefore such an idea necessarily is, and (I, 15) it is 
in God and nowhere else. Q. E. D. 
Prop. 6. The modes of any attribute have God as their cause, 
only in so far as he is considered under the attribute of which they 
are modes, not in so far as he is considered under any other attri- 
bute. 
Proof. — Each attribute is conceived through itself independ- 
ently of anything else (I, 10). The modes, then, of each attri- 
bute involve the concept of their own attribute, but of no other; 
therefore (I, axiom 4), they have as their cause God, only in so
-P-A-G-E-216
  194 BARUCH DE SPINOZA 
far as he is considered under the attribute of which they are 
modes, and not in so far as he is considered under any other 
attribute. Q. E. D. 
Corollary. — Hence it follows that the formal being of things, 
which are not modes of thinking, does not follow from the divine 
nature because this first knew things; but the objects of ideas 
follow and are inferred from their attributes in the same manner, 
and by the same necessity, as we have shown ideas to follow 
from the attribute of thought. 
Prop. 7. — The order and connection of ideas is the same as the 
order and connection of things. 
Proof. — The proof is evident from axiom 4, of Part I, forthe 
idea of anything that is caused depends upon a knowledge of the 
cause whose effect it is. 
Corollary. — Hence it follows that God’s power of thinking 
is equal to his realized power of acting. That is, whatever fol- 
lows formally from God’s infinite nature follows also objectively 
in God in the same order and with the same connection from 
the idea of God. 
Scholium. — Before going further we should recall to mind 
this truth, which has been proved above, namely, that whatever 
can be perceived by infinite intellect as constituting the essence 
of substance belongs exclusively to the one substance, and con- 
sequently that thinking substance and extended substance are 
one and the same substance, apprehended now under this, now 
under that attribute. So, also, a mode of extension and the idea 
of that mode are one and the same thing, but expressed in two 
ways; a truth which certain of the Hebrews appear to have seen 
as if through a mist, in that they assert that God, the intellect 
of God, and the things known by it, are one and the same. For 
example, a circle existing in nature, and the idea, which also is 
in God, of this existing circle, are one and the same thing, mani- 
fested through different attributes; for this reason, whether we 
conceive nature under the attribute of extension, or under that 
of thought, or under any other attribute whatever, we shall find 
there follows one and the same order, or one and the same con- 
catenation of causes, that is, the same thing. I have said that
-P-A-G-E-217
  THE ETHICS 195 
God is the cause of an idea; for instance, the idea of a circle, 
merely in so far as he is a thinking thing, and of the circle, 
merely in so far as he is an extended thing, just for the reason 
that the formal being of the idea of a circle can only be per- 
ceived through another mode of thinking, as its proximate 
cause, that one in its turn through another, and so to infinity. 
Thus, whenever we consider things as modes of thinking, we 
must explain the whole order of nature, or concatenation of 
causes, through the attribute of thought alone; and in so far 
as we consider them as modes of extension, we must likewise 
explain the whole order of nature solely through the attribute of 
extension. So also in the case of the other attributes. Hence 
God, since he consists of an infinity of attributes, is really the 
cause of things as they are in themselves. I cannot explain this 
more clearly at present. 
Prop. 8. The ideas of individual things or modes which do not 
exist must be comprehended in the infinite idea of God, in the same 
way as the formal essences of individual things or modes are con- 
tained in the attributes of God. 
Proof. — This proposition is evident from the one preceding, 
but it may be more clearly understood from the preceding 
scholium. 
Corollary. — Hence it follows that so long as individual things 
do not exist, except in so far as they are comprehended in the 
attributes of God, their objective being, that is, their ideas, do 
not exist, except in so far as the infinite idea of God exists; and 
when particular things are said to exist, not merely in so far as 
they are comprehended in the attributes of God, but also in so 
far as they are said to have a being in time, their ideas, too, 
involve an existence, through which they are said to have a 
being in time. 
Prop. 10. Substantive being does not belong to the essence 
of man, that is, substance does not constitute the essence of 
man. 
Proof. — Substantive being involves necessary existence 
(I, 7).- If, then, substantive being belongs to the essence of man, 
granted substance, man would necessarily be granted (def. 2): 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  196 BARUCH DE SPINOZA 
hence man would necessarily exist, which (axiom 1) is absurd. 
Therefore, etc. Q. E. D. 
Scholium. — This proposition is proved also by I, 5, which 
maintains that there are not two substances of the same nature. 
As, however, a number of men may exist, that which consti- 
tutes the essence of man is not substantive being. This pro- 
position is evident, moreover, from the other properties of 
substance, to wit, that substance is in its nature infinite, 
immutable, indivisible, etc.; as anyone may readily see. 
Corollary. — Hence it follows that the essence of man con- 
sists of certain modifications of God’s attributes. Substantive 
being (by the preceding proposition) does not belong to the es- 
sence of man. It is, therefore (I, 15), something which is in God, 
and which without God can neither be nor be conceived, that is 
(I, 25, cor.), a modification, or mode, which expresses God’s 
nature in a definite and determinate manner. 
Prop. 11. The first thing that constitutes the actual being of the 
human mind is nothing else than the idea of some individual thing 
actually existing. i; 
Proof.— Man’s essence (by the corollary to the preceding propo- 
sition) consists of certain modes of the attributes of God; 
namely (axiom 2) of modes of thinking, in all of which (axiom 3) 
an idea is prior by nature, and when this is present the other 
modes (those, that is, to which the idea is prior by nature) 
must be present in the same individual (by the same axiom). 
Thus an idea is the first thing that constitutes the being of the 
human mind. But it is not the idea of a non-existent thing, for 
in that case (8, cor.) the idea itself could not be said to exist; it 
is, then, the idea of a thing actually existing. Not, however, of 
an infinite thing. For an infinite thing (I, 21 amd 22) must 
always necessarily exist; but this is (axiom 1) absurd; there- 
fore the first thing that constitutes the actual being of the 
human mind is theidea of an individual thing actually existing. 
Q. E. D. 
Corollary. — Hence it follows that the human mind is a part 
of the infinite intellect of God. When, therefore, we say that 
the human mind perceives this or that, we say merely that God, 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE ETHICS 197 
not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as he is manifested by 
the nature of the human mind, that is, in so far as he consti- 
tutes the essence of the human mind, has this or that idea; and 
when we say that God has this or that idea, not merely in so far 
as he constitutes the nature of the human mind, but in so far as 
besides the human mind he has also the idea of another thing, 
we say the human mind perceives the thing partially or inade- 
quately. 
Scholium. — Here, doubtless, my readers will stick, and will 
contrive to find many objections which will cause delay. For 
this reason I beg them to proceed with me slowly, and not to 
pass judgment on these matters until they have read over the 
whole. ‘ 
Prop. 12. Whatever takes place in the object of the idea that 
constitutes the human mind must be perceived by the human mind; 
that is, an idea of that thing is necessarily in the mind. In other 
words, if the object of the idea that constitutes the human mind be a 
body, nothing can take place in that body without being perceived 
by the mind. 
Proof. — Whatever takes place in the object of any idea, the 
knowledge of it is necessarily in God (9, cor.), in so far as he is 
considered as affected by the idea of that object; that is (rz), in 
so far as he constitutes the mind of anything. Whatever, then, 
takes place in the object of the idea that constitutes the human 
mind, the knowledge of it is necessarily in God, in so far as he 
constitutes the nature of the human mind, that is (11, cor.), the 
knowledge of it is necessarily in the mind, or the mind perceives 
it. Q. E. D. 
Scholium. — This proposition is evident also, and more 
clearly understood, from 7, schol., which see. 
Prop. 13. The object of theidea that constitutes the human mind 
is the body, that is, a definite mode of extension actually existing, 
and nothing else. 
Proof. — If the body were not the object of the human mind, 
the ideas of the modifications of the body would not be in God 
(9, cor.), in so far as he constituted our mind, but in so far as he 
constituted the mind of something else; that is (11, cor.), the
-P-A-G-E-220
  
198 BARUCH DE SPINOZA 
ideas of the modifications of the body would not be in our 
mind. But (axiom 4) we have ideas of the modifications of the 
body. Therefore the object of the idea that constitutes the 
human mind is the body, and that (11) is a body actually exist- 
ing. Again, if, besides the body, there was still another object 
of the mind, then, since nothing (I, 36) exists from which some 
effect does not follow, there would (11) necessarily have to be 
in our mind the idea of some effect of this object. But (axiom 5) 
there is no such idea. Therefore the object of our mind is the 
existing body and nothing else. Q. E. D. 
Corollary. — Hence it follows that man consists of mind and 
body, and that the human body exists, just as we perceive it. 
Scholium. — From this we comprehend, not merely that the 
human mind is united to the body, but also what is meant by 
the union of mind and body. No one, however, can compre- 
hend this adequately or distinctly, unless he first gain an ade- 
quate knowledge of the nature of ourbody. What I have proved 
so far have been very general truths, which do not apply more 
to men than to all other individual things, which are all, though 
in different degrees, animated. For of everything there is 
necessarily an idea in God, of which God is the cause, just as 
there is an idea of the human body; hence, whatever I have said 
of the idea of the human body must necessarily be said of the 
idea of everything. Yet we cannot deny that ideas differ among 
themselves as do their objects, and that one is more excellent 
than another, and contains more reality, just as the object of 
the one is more excellent than the object of the other, and con- 
tains more reality. Therefore, in order to determine in what the 
human mind differs from other ideas, and in what it excels the 
others, we must gain a knowledge, as I have said, of the nature 
of its object, that is, of the human body. This, however, I can- 
not here treat of, nor is it necessary for what I wish to prove. 
I will only make the general statement that, in proportion as 
any body is more capable than the rest of acting or being acted 
upon in many ways at the same time, its mind is more capable 
than the rest of having many perceptions at the same time; 
and the more the actions of a body depend upon itself alone, 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  THE ETHICS 199 
and the less other bodies contribute to its action, the more capa- 
ble is its mind of distinct comprehension. We may thus discern 
the superiority of one mind over others, and we may see the 
reason why we have only a very confused knowledge of our 
bodys 65 
Postulates 
1. The human body is composed of very many individuals of 
different natures, each one of which is highly composite. 
2. Of the individuals which compose the human body, some 
are fluid, some soft, and some hard. 
3. The individuals which compose the human body, and, 
consequently, the human body itself, are affected in very many 
ways by external bodies. 
4. The human body needs, for its conservation, very many 
other bodies, by which it is continually, as it were, born 
anew. 
5. Whena fluid part of the human body is determined by an 
external body to impinge often upon a soft part, it changes the 
plane of the latter, and imprints upon it certain traces, as it 
were, of the impelling external body. 
6. The human body can move external bodies in very many 
ways, and arrange them in very many ways. 
Prop. 14. The human mind is capable of having very many 
perceptions, and the more capable, the greater the number of way” 
in which its body can be disposed. 
Proof. — The human body (postulates 3 and 6) is affected in 
very many ways by external bodies, and is adapted to affect 
external bodies in very many ways. But (12) the human mind 
must perceive whatever takes place in the human body. There- 
fore, the human mind is capable of having very many percep- 
tions, and the more capable, etc. Q. E. D. 
Prop. 15. The idea, which constitutes the essential being of the 
human mind, is not simple, but composed of very many ideas. 
Proof. — The idea, which constitutes the essential being of 
the human mind, is the idea of the body (13), and this (postu- 
late 1) is composed of many highly composite individuals. But
-P-A-G-E-222
  200 BARUCH DE SPINOZA 
there is necessarily in God (8, cor.) an idea of each of the indi- 
viduals which compose the body. Therefore (7) the idea of the 
human body is composed of these many ideas of the component 
parts. Q. E. D. 
Prop. 16. The idea of any mode, in which the human body is 
affected by external bodies, must involve both the nature -of the 
human body and the nature of the external body. 
Proof. — All the modes, in which any body is affected, are a 
consequence both of the nature of the body affected, and the 
nature of the body affecting it (axiom 1, after the cor. to lemma 3). 
Hence their idea (I, axiom 4) necessarily involves the nature of 
both bodies. Consequently, the idea of any mode, in which the 
human body is affected by an external body, involves the nature 
of the human body and of the external body. Q. E. D. 
Corollary 1. —Hence it follows, in the first place, that the 
human mind perceives the nature of very many bodies along 
with the nature of its own body. 
Corollary 2. — And it follows, in the second place, that the 
ideas which we have of external bodies indicate rather the con- 
stitution of our own body than the nature of external bodies; 
as I have explained with many illustrations in the Appendix to 
Part I. 
Prop. 17. If the human body is affected in a manner which 
involves the nature of any external body, the human mind will re- 
gard this external body as actually existing, or as present to it, until 
the body is affected with some modification which excludes the exist- 
ence or presence of this body. 
Proof. — This is evident. For as long as the human body is 
thus affected, the human mind (12) will contemplate this modi- 
fication of the body; in other words (by the preceding proposi- 
tion), will have the idea of a mode actually existing, which in- 
volves the nature of an external body; that is, an idea that does 
not exclude the existence or presence of the nature of the 
external body, but affirms it. Therefore the mind (cor. 1 to the 
preceding proposition) will regard an external body as actually 
existing, or as present, until it is affected, etc. Q. E. D. 
Corollary. —The mind can contemplate, as if they were
-P-A-G-E-223
  THE ETHICS 201 
present, external bodies by which the human body has once 
been affected, although they do not exist and are not present. 
Scholium. — Thus we see how it can be that we regard as 
present things that do not exist, as often happens. It is possible 
that this is brought about by other causes, but it is here suffi- 
cient that I have shown one by which I can explain the thing as 
well as if I had explained it by its true cause. Nevertheless I do 
not think I am far wrong, since all the postulates I have as- 
sumed contain scarcely anything not in harmony with expe- 
rience, and experience we may not doubt, after we have shown 
that the human body exists just as we perceive it (13, cor.). 
Besides (from the preceding cor., and 16, cor. 2) we clearly com- 
prehend the difference between the idea, for instance, of Peter, 
which constitutes the essence of the mind of Peter, and the idea 
of the same Peter, which is in another man, say in Paul. The 
former directly expresses the essence of Peter’s body, nor does 
it involve existence, except so long as Peter exists; the latter, on 
the other hand, indicates rather the condition of Paul’s body 
than the nature of Peter; and, therefore, while that condition 
of Paul’s body endures, Paul’s mind will regard Peter as present, 
even if he does not exist. Further, to keep to the usual phrase- 
ology, we will call the modifications of the human body, the 
ideas of which represent external bodies as present to us, images 
of things, although they do not reproduce the shapes of things. 
When the mind contemplates bodies in this way, we will speak 
of it as imagining. And here, that I may begin to show what 
error is, I would have you note that acts of imagination, in 
themselves considered, contain no error; that is, that the mind 
does not err from the mere fact that it imagines, but only in so 
far as it is considered as lacking the idea, which excludes the 
existence of the things it imagines as present. For if the mind, 
when imagining things non-existent as present, knew that these 
things did not really exist, surely it would ascribe this power of 
imagination to a virtue in its nature, and not toa defect, espe- 
cially if this faculty of imagining depended solely upon its 
nature, that is (I, def. 7), if this mental faculty were free. 
Prop. 18. If the human body has once been affected simulta- 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
202 BARUCH DE SPINOZA 
neously by two or more bodies, when the mind after that imagines 
any one of them it will forthwith call to remembrance also the 
others. 
Proof. — The cause of the mind’s imagining any body is (by 
the preceding corollary), that the human body is affected and 
disposed by the traces of an external body in the same way as it 
was affected when certain of its parts were impelled by that 
external body; but (by hypothesis) the body was then so disposed 
that the mind imagined two bodies at the same time; it will 
therefore now, also, imagine two at the same time; and when 
the mind imagines either, it will forthwith recollect the other. 
Q. E. D. 
Scholium. — From this we clearly comprehend what memory 
is. It is nothing but a certain concatenation of ideas, involving 
the nature of things outside of the human body, which arises in 
the mind according to the order and concatenation of the modi- 
fications of the human body. I say, in the first place, that it isa 
concatenation of those ideas only that involve the nature of 
things outside of the human body, not of the ideas that express 
the nature of those things; for these ideas are really (16) ideas 
of the modifications of the human body, which involve both its 
nature and that of external bodies. I say, in the second place, 
that this concatenation follows the order and concatenation of 
the modifications of the human body, to distinguish it from the 
concatenation of ideas which follows the order of the under- 
standing, whereby the mind perceives things through their first 
causes, and which is the same in all men. From this, further- 
more, we clearly understand why the mind from the thought of 
one thing immediately passes to the thought of another which 
bears no resemblance to the former. For example, from the 
thought of the word pomum (apple) a Roman passes straight- 
way to the thought of the fruit, which bears no resemblance to 
that articulate sound, and has nothing in common with it, 
except that the body of the same man has often been affected 
by these two; that is, the man hasoften heard the word pomum 
while he saw this fruit. Thus each one passes from one thought 
to another, according as custom has ordered the images of  
-P-A-G-E-225
THE ETHICS 203 
things in his body. A soldier, for instance, who sees in the sand 
the tracks of a horse, passes at once from the thought of the 
horse to the thought of its rider, and from that to the thought 
of war, etc.; while a rustic passes from the thought of a horse 
to the thought of a plow, a field, etc. Thus each one, according 
as he has been accustomed to join and connect the images 
of things in this or that way, passes from a given thought to 
this thought or to that. 
Prop. 19. The human mind does not come to a knowledge of the 
human body itself, or know that it exists, except through the ideas of 
the modifications by which the body is affected. 
Proof. —'The human mind is the idea or knowledge of the 
human body (13), which (9) is in God, in so far as he is consid- 
ered as affected by the idea of another individual thing. Or 
rather, since (postulate 4) the human body needs many bodies, 
by which it is continually born anew, as it were; and since the 
order and connection of ideas is (7) the same as the order and 
connection of causes; this idea is in God, in so far as he is con- 
sidered as affected by the ideas of many individual things. 
Therefore God has an idea of the human body, or knows the 
human body, in so far as he is affected by many other ideas; and 
not in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind; 
thateis (11, cor.), the human mind does not know the human 
body. But the ideas of the modifications of the body are in 
God, in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind; 
that is, the human mind perceives these same modifications 
(x2), and consequently (16) perceives the human body itself, 
and that (17) as really existing. Therefore, only in so far does 
the human mind perceive the human body. Q. E. D. 
Prop. 20. There is in God also an idea or knowledge of the 
human mind, which follows in God in the same way, and is referred 
to God in the same way, as the idea or knowledge of the human body. 
Proof. — Thought is an attribute of God (1); therefore (3) 
there must necessarily bein God an idea of it and of all its modi- 
fications, and consequently (11) of the human mind also. In the 
second place, it does not follow that this idea or knowledge of 
the mind is in God in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as he is
-P-A-G-E-226
204 BARUCH DE SPINOZA 
affected by another idea of an individual thing (9). But the 
order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and con- 
nection of causes (7). Therefore this idea or knowledge of the 
mind follows in God, and is referred to God, in the same way as 
the idea or knowledge of the body. Q. E. D. 
Prop. 21. This idea of the mind is united to the mind in the 
same way as the mind itself is united to the body. 
Proof.— We have proved that the mind is united to the body, 
from the fact that the body is the object of the mind (12 and 13); 
hence, for the same reason, the idea of the mind must be united 
with its object, that is, with the mind itself, in the same way as 
the mind is united with the body. Q. E. D. 
Scholium. — This proposition is much more clearly compre- 
hended from what was said in the scholium to prop. 7 of this 
Part. I there showed that the idea of the body and the body, 
that is (13), the mind and the body, are one and the same indi- 
vidual, conceived now under the attribute of thought, now 
under that of extension. Hence the idea of the mind and the 
mind itself are one and the same thing, conceived under one and 
the same attribute, namely, that of thought. The idea of the 
mind, I say, and the mind itself follow in God, by the same 
necessity, from the same power of thinking. For, in truth, the 
idea of the mind — that is, the idea of an idea — is nothing else 
than the essence of an idea, in so far as this is considered as a 
mode of thinking, and without relation to its object. For when 
any one knows a thing, from that very fact he knows that he 
knows it, and at the same time knows that he knows that he 
knows it, and so to infinity. But of this more hereafter. 
Prop. 22. The human mind perceives, not merely the modifica- 
tions of the body, but also the ideas of these modifications. 
Proof. — The ideas of the ideas of modifications follow in 
God in the same way, and are referred to God in the same way, 
as the ideas of the modifications. This is proved as is prop. 20. 
But the ideas of the modifications of the body are in the human 
mind (12), that is (x1, cor.), they are in God, in so far as he con- 
stitutes the essence of the human mind. Hence, the ideas of 
these ideas are in God, in so far as he has a knowledge, or idea,
-P-A-G-E-227
  THE ETHICS 205 
of the human mind; that is (21), they are in the human mind 
itself, which, consequently, perceives not merely the modifi- 
cations of the body, but also the ideas of these. Q. E. D. 
Prop. 23. The mind only knows itself in so far as it perceives 
the ideas of the modifications of the body. 
Proof.— The idea or knowledge of the mind (20) follows in 
God in the same way, and is referred to God in the same way, 
as the idea or knowledge of the body. But since (19) the human 
mind does not know the body itself; that is (11, cor.), since the 
knowledge of the human body is not referred to God, in so far 
as he constitutes the nature of the human mind; neither is the 
knowledge of the mind referred to God, in so far as he consti- 
tutes the essence of the human mind; and hence (11, cor.), in so 
far the human mind does not know itself. In the second place, 
the ideas of the modifications which the human body receives 
involve the nature of the human body itself (16), that is (13), 
they agree with the nature of the mind; hence the knowledge of 
these ideas necessarily involves the knowledge of the mind. 
But (by the preceding proposition) the knowledge of these ideas 
is in the human mind itself. Therefore only in so far does the 
human mind know itself. Q. E. D. 
Prop. 48. There is in the mind no absolute or free will; but the 
mind is determined to this or that volition by a cause, which has 
tself been determined by another cause, this again by another, and 
so to infinity. 
Proof. —'The mind is a definite and determinate mode of 
thinking (rz), therefore (I, 17, cor. 2) it cannot be a free cause 
of its own actions, that is, it cannot have an absolute power to 
will or not to will. It must be determined to this or that volition 
(I, 28) by a cause, which has itself been determined by another 
cause, this again by another, etc. Q. E. D. 
Scholium. — In the same way it is proved that there is in . 
the mind no absolute power of knowing, desiring, loving, etc. 
Whence it follows, these and similar faculties are either abso- 
lutely fictitious, or only metaphysical entities — universals — 
that we are accustomed to form from individuals. Thus, under- 
standing and will are related to this or that idea and to this or
-P-A-G-E-228
  206 BARUCH DE SPINOZA 
that volition, as lapidity is related to this or that stone, or man 
to Peter or Paul. Why men think themselves free I have ex- 
plained in the Appendix to Part I. Before I go further, it should 
be noted that I mean by will, not desire, but the faculty of 
affirming and denying; I mean, I say, the faculty by which the 
mind affirms or denies what is true or false, and not the desire 
through which the mind seeks or avoids things. But having 
proved these faculties to be universal notions, which are not 
distinguished from the individuals of which we form them, it 
remains to inquire whether the volitions themselves are any- 
thing but just the ideas of things. It remains, I say, to inquire 
whether there is in the mind any other affrmation or negation 
than that involved in an idea, in that it is an idea. On this point 
see the following proposition, and, to avoid confounding ideas 
with pictures, see, also, def. 3 of this Part. For by ideas I do not 
mean such images as are formed at the back of the eye, or, if you 
please, in the middle of the brain, but the conceptions of 
thought. 
Prop. 49. There is in the mind no volition, that is, no affirma- 
tion or negation, except that involved in an idea in that itis an idea. 
Proof. — There is in the mind (by the preceding proposition) 
no absolute power to will or not to will, but only particular voli- 
tions, namely, this or that affirmation, and this or that negation. 
Let us conceive, therefore, some particular volition — for in- 
stance, the mode of thinking by which the mind affirms the 
three angles of a triangle to be equal to two right angles. This 
affirmation involves the conception or idea of a triangle, that is, 
it cannot be conceived without the idea of a triangle; for it is 
the same thing whether I say, A must involve the conception B, 
or A cannot be conceived without B. In the second place, this 
affirmation (axiom 3), without the idea of a triangle, cannot be. 
Therefore this affirmation cannot, without the idea of a trian- 
gle, either be or be conceived. Moreover, this idea of a triangle 
must involve this same affirmation of the equality of its three 
angles to two right angles. Therefore, conversely, this idea of a 
triangle can neither be nor be conceived without this affirma- 
tion. Hence (def. 2) this affirmation belongs to the essence of
-P-A-G-E-229
  THE ETHICS 207 
the idea of a triangle, and is nothing but that idea. What I have 
said of this volition is (since I took it at random) to be said also 
of every volition, namely, that it is nothing else than an idea. 
O.b) Ds 
Corollary. — Will and understanding are one and the same 
thing. 
Proof.— Will and understanding are‘nothing but particular 
volitions and ideas (48 and schol.). But a particular volition 
and a particular idea are (by the preceding proposition) one and 
the same thing. Therefore will and understanding are one and 
the same thing. Q. E. D.

GEORGE MARTIN DUNCAN 
XI. A New System oF NATURE, AND OF THE INTERACTION 
OF SUBSTANCES, AS WELL AS OF THE UNION WHICH EX- 
ISTS BETWEEN THE SOUL AND THE Bopy. 1695 
1. I concEIvED this system many years ago and communi- 
cated it to some learned men, and in particular to one of the 
greatest theologians and philosophers of our time, who, having 
been informed of some of my opinions by a very distinguished 
person, had found them highly paradoxical. When, however, 
he had received my explanations, he withdrew his condemna- 
tion in the most generous and edifying manner; and, having 
approved a part of my propositions, he ceased censuring the 
others with which he was not yet in accord. Since that time I 
have continued my meditations as far as opportunity has per- 
mitted, in order to give to the public only thoroughly examined 
views, and I have also tried to answer the objections made 
against my essays in dynamics, which are related to the 
former. Finally, as a number of persons have desired to see my 
opinions more clearly explained, I have ventured to publish 
these meditations although they are not at all popular nor fit to 
be enjoyed by every sort of mind. I have been led to do this 
principally in order that I might profit by the judgments of 
those who are learned in these matters, inasmuch as it would be 
too inconvenient to seek and challenge separately those who

  PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS 209 
would be disposed to give the instructions which I shall always 
be glad to receive, provided the love of truth appears in them 
rather than passion for opinions already held. 
2. Although I am one of those who have worked very hard at 
mathematics I have not since my youth ceased to meditate on 
philosophy, for it always seemed to me that there was a way to 
establish in it, by clear demonstrations, something stable. I had 
penetrated well into the territory of the scholastics when math- 
ematics and modern authors induced me while yet young to 
withdraw from it. Their fine ways of explaining nature mechan- 
ically charmed me; and, with reason, I scorned the method of 
those who employ only forms or faculties, by which nothing is 
learned. But afterwards, when I tried to search into the prin- 
ciples of mechanics to find proof of the laws of nature which 
experience made known, I perceived that the mere considera- 
tion of an extended mass did not suffice and that it was neces- 
sary to employ in addition the notion of force, which is very 
easily understood although it belongs to the province of meta- 
physics. It seemed to me also that the opinion of those who 
transform or degrade animals into simple machines, not with- 
standing its seeming possibility, is contrary to appearances and 
even opposed to the order of things. 
3. In the beginning, when I had freed myself from the yoke 
of Aristotle, I occupied myself with the consideration of the 
void and atoms, for this is what best fills the imagination; but 
after many meditations I perceived that it is impossible to find 
the principles of true unity in mere matter, or in that which is 
only passive, because there everything is but a collection or 
mass of parts ad infinitum. Now, multiplicity cannot have its 
reality except from real unities, which originate otherwise and 
are entirely different things from the points of which it is cer- 
tain the continuum could not be composed. Therefore, in order 
to find these real unities I was compelled to resort to a formal 
atom, since a material being could not be at the same time ma- 
terial and perfectly indivisible, or in other words, endowed with 
true unity. It became necessary, therefore, to recall and, as it 
were, reinstate the substantial forms, so descried now-a-days,
-P-A-G-E-232
  210 GOTTFRIED WILHELM VON LEIBNITZ 
but in a way to render them intelligible, and distinguish the use 
which ought to be made of them from the abuse which had 
befallen them. I found then that their nature is forceand that 
from this something analogous to sensation and desire results, 
and that therefore it was necessary to conceive them similarly 
to the idea which we have of souls. But as the soul ought not to 
be employed to explain the details of the economy of the animal 
body, likewise I judged that it was not necessary to employ 
these forms to explain particular problems in nature although 
they are necessary in order to establish true general principles. 
Aristotle calls them the first entelechies. I call them, perhaps 
more intelligibly, primitive forces which contain in themselves 
not only the act or complement of possibility, but also an 
original activity. 
4. Isaw that these forms and these souls ought to be indivisi- 
ble, just as much as our mind, as in truth I remembered was the 
opinion of St. Thomas in regard to the souls of brutes. But this 
innovation renewed the great difficulties in respect to the origin 
and duration of souls and of forms. For every simple substance 
which has true unity cannot begin or end except by miracle; it 
follows, therefore, that it cannot begin except by creation, nor 
end except by annihilation. Therefore, with the exception of 
the souls which God might still be pleased to create expressly, 
I was obliged to recognize that the constitutive forms of sub- 
stances must have been created with the world, and that they 
must exist always. Certain scholastics, like Albertus Magnus 
and John Bacon, had also foreseen a part of the truth as to their 
origin. And the matter ought not to appear at all extraordinary 
for only the same duration which the Gassendists accord their 
atoms is given to these forms. 
5. I was of the opinion, nevertheless, that neither spirits nor 
the rational soul, which belong to a superior order and have 
incomparably more perfection than these forms implanted in 
matter which in my opinion are found everywhere — being in 
comparison with them, like little gods made in the image of God 
and having within them some rays of the light of divinity, ought 
to be mixed up indifferently or confounded with other forms or
-P-A-G-E-233
  PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS 211 
souls. This is why God governs spirits as a prince governs his 
subjects, and even as a father cares for his children; while he 
disposes of the other substances as an engineer manipulates his 
machines. Thus spirits have peculiar laws which place them 
above the changes which matter undergoes, and indeed it may 
be said that all other things are made only for them, the changes 
even being adapted to the felicity of the good and the punish- 
ment of the bad. 
6. However, to return to ordinary forms or to material souls 
[@mes brutes], the duration which must be attributed to them in 
place of that which has been attributed to atoms, might raise 
the question as to whether they pass from body to body, which 
would be metempsychosis — very like the belief of certain phi- 
losophers in the transmission of motion and of the species. But 
this fancy is very far removed from the nature of things. There 
is no such passage; and here it is that the transformations of 
Swammerdam, Malpighi and Leewenhoeck, who are the best 
observers of our time, have come to my aid and have made me 
admit more easily that the animal and every other organized 
substance does not at all begin when we think it does, and that 
its apparent generation is only a development and a sort of 
augmentation. Also I have noticed that the author of the 
Search after Truth [i.e., Malebranche], Rigis, Hartsoeker and 
other able men, have not been far removed from this opinion. 
7. But the most important question of all still remained: 
What do these souls or these forms become after the death of 
the animal or after the destruction of the individual of the or- 
ganized substance? It is this question which is most embarrass- 
ing, all the more so as it seems unreasonable that souls should 
‘remain uselessly in a chaos of confused matter. This obliged 
me finally to believe that there was only one reasonable opinion 
to hold, namely, that not only the soul but also the animal itself 
and its organic machine were preserved, although the destruc- 
tion of its gross parts had rendered it so small as to escape our 
senses now just as muchas it did before it was born. Also there is 
no person who can accurately note the true time of death, which 
can be considered for a long time solely as a suspension of vis-
-P-A-G-E-234
  212 GOTTFRIED WILHELM VON LEIBNITZ 
ible actions, and indeed is never anything else in mere animals; 
witness the resuscitation of drowned flies after being buried 
under pulverized chalk, and other similar examples, which 
make it sufficiently clear that there would be many more resus- 
citations and of far more intricacy if men were in condition to 
set the machine going again. And apparently it was of some- 
thing of this sort that the great Democritus, atomist as he was, 
spoke, although Pliny makes sport of the idea. It is then na- 
tural that the animal having, as people of great penetration 
begin to recognize, been always living and organized, should so 
remain always. And since, therefore, there is no first birth nor 
entirely new generation of the animal, it follows that there will 
be no final extinction nor complete death taken in its metaphy- 
sical rigor, and that in consequence instead of the transmigra- 
tion of souls there is only a transformation of one and the same 
animal, according as its organs are folded differently and more 
or less developed. 
8. Nevertheless, rational souls follow very much higher laws 
and are exempt from all that could make them lose the quality 
of being citizens in the society of spirits, God having planned 
for them so well, that all the changes in matter cannot make 
them lose the moral qualities of their personality. And it can be 
said that everything tends to the perfection not only of the uni- 
verse in general but also of those creatures in particular who 
are destined to such a measure of happiness that the universe 
finds itself interested therein, by virtue of the divine goodness 
which communicates itself to each one, according as sovereign 
wisdom permits. 
g. As regards the ordinary body of animals and of other cor- 
poreal substances, the complete extinction of which has up to 
this time been believed in, and the changes of which depend 
rather upon mechanical rules than upon moral laws, I remarked 
with pleasure that the author of the book On Diet, which is at- 
tributed to Hippocrates, had foreseen something of the truth 
when he said in express terms that animals are not born and do 
not die, and that the things which are supposed to begin and to 
perish only appear and disappear. This was also the opinion of
-P-A-G-E-235
  
PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS 213 
Parmenides and of Melissus, according to Aristotle, for these 
ancients were more profound than is thought. 
ro. I am the best disposed in the world to do justice to the 
moderns; nevertheless I think they have carried reform too far, 
for instance, in confounding natural things with artificial, for 
the reason that they have not had sufficiently high ideas of the 
majesty of nature. They conceive that the difference between 
its machines and ours is only that of large to small. This caused 
a very able man, author of Conversations on the Plurality of 
Worlds, to say recently that in regarding nature close at hand 
it is found less admirable than had been believed, being only 
like the workshop of an artisan. I believe that this does not 
give a worthy idea of it and that only our system can finally 
make men realize the true and immense distance which there is 
between the most trifling productions and mechanisms of the 
divine wisdom and the greatest masterpieces of the art of a 
finite mind, this difference consisting not merely in degree but 
also in kind. It must then be known that the machines of na- 
ture have a truly infinite number of organs and that they are so 
well protected and so proof against all accidents that it is not 
possible to destroy them. A natural machine remains a ma- 
chine even to its least parts and, what is more, it remains 
always the same machine it has been, being only transformed 
by the different folds it receives, and sometimes expanded, 
sometimes compressed and, as it were, concentrated when be- 
lieved to be lost. 
11. Farther, by means of the soul or of form there arises a 
true unity which answers to what we call the 7 in us, that which 
could take place neither in the machines of art nor in the simple 
mass of matter however well organized it might be, which can 
only be considered as an army, or as a herd of cattle, or as a 
pond full of fish, or as a watch composed of springs and wheels. 
Nevertheless, if there were not real substantial unities there 
would be nothing substantial or real in the mass. It was this 
which forced Cordemoi to abandon Descartes, and to embrace 
Democritus’ doctrine of the Atoms, in order to find a true 
unity. But atoms of mailer are contrary to reason, leaving out  
-P-A-G-E-236
  214 GOTTFRIED WILHELM VON LEIBNITZ 
of account the proof that they are made up of parts, for the in- 
vincible attachment of one part to another (if such a thing could 
be conceived or with reason supposed) would not at all destroy 
their diversity. Only atoms of substance, i.e., unities which are 
real and absolutely destitute of parts, are sources of actions and 
the absolute first principles of the composition of things, and, 
as it were, the last elements of the analysis of substances. They 
might be called metaphysical points; they possess a certain 
vitality and a kind of perception, and mathematical points are 
their points of view to express the universe. But when corporeal 
substances are compressed all their organs together form only 
physical point to our sight. Thus physical points are only indi- 
visible in appearance; mathematical points are so in reality but 
they are merely modalities; only metaphysical points or those 
of substance (constituted by forms or souls) are exact and real, 
and without them there would be nothing real, for without true 
unities there could not be multiplicity. 
12. After having established these proportions I thought 
myself entering into port, but when I came to meditate on the 
union of the soul with the body I was as if cast back into the 
open sea. For I found no way of explaining how the body can 
cause anything to pass into the soul, or vice versa; nor how one 
substance can communicate with another created substance. 
Descartes gave up the attempt on that point, as far as can be 
learned from his writings, but his disciples seeing that the com- 
mon view was inconceivable, were of the opinion that we per- 
ceive the qualities of bodies because God causes thoughts to 
arise in the soul on the occasion of movements of matter; and 
when the soul wished to move the body in its turn they judged 
that it was God who moved it for the soul. And as the com- 
munication of motions again seemed to them inconceivable, 
they believed that God gave motion to a body on the occasion 
of the motion of another body. This is what they call the sys- 
tem of Occasional Causes which has been much in vogue on 
account of the beautiful remarks of the author of the Search 
after Truth. 
13. It must be confessed that the difficulty has been well
-P-A-G-E-237
  PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS 215 
penetrated when the not-possible is stated, but it does not ap- 
pear that it is done away with by explaining what actually 
takes place. It is indeed true that there is no real influence of 
one created substance upon another, speaking in metaphysical 
strictness, and that all things with all their realities are continu- 
ally produced by the power of God; but in resolving problems 
it is not enough to employ a general cause and to call in what is 
called the Deus ex Machina. For when this is done and there 
is no other explanation which can be drawn from secondary 
causes, it is, properly, having recourse to miracle. In philoso- 
phy it is necessary to try to give reasons by making known in 
what way things are done by divine wisdom, in conformity to 
the idea of the subject concerned. 
14. Being then obliged to admit that it is not possible for the 
soul or any true substance to receive any influence from with- 
out, if it be not by the divine omnipotence I was led insensibly 
to an opinion which surprised me but which appears inevitable 
and which has in truth great advantages and many beauties. It 
is this: it must then be said that God created the soul, or every 
other real unity, in the first place in such a way that everything 
with it comes into existence from its own substance through 
perfect spontaneity as regards itself and in perfect harmony with 
objects outside itself. And that thus our internal feelings (i.e., 
those within the soul itself and not in the brain or finer parts of 
the body), being only phenomena consequent upon external 
objects or true appearances, and like well-ordered dreams, it is 
necessary that these internal perceptions within the soul itself 
come to it by its own proper original constitution, i.e., by the 
representative nature (capable of expressing beings outside 
itself by relation to its organs), which has been given it at its 
creation and which constitutes its individual character. This 
brings it about that each of these substances in its own way and 
according to a certain point of view, represents exactly the 
entire universe, and perceptions or impressions of external 
things reach the soul at the proper point in virtue of its own 
laws, as if it were in a world apart, and as if there existed no- 
thing but God and itself (to make use of the manner of speaking
-P-A-G-E-238
  216 GOTTFRIED WILHELM VON LEIBNITZ 
of a certain person of great elevation of mind, whose piety is 
well known); there is also perfect harmony among all these sub- 
stances, producing the same effects as if they communicated 
with each other by a transmission of kinds or of qualities, as 
philosophers generally suppose. 
Farther, the organized mass, within which is the point of 
view of the soul, being expressed more nearly by it, finds itself 
reciprocally ready to act of itself, following the laws of cor- 
poreal machines, at the moment when the soul wills it, without 
either one troubling the laws of the other, the nerves and the 
blood having just at that time received the impulse which is 
necessary in order to make them respond to the passions and 
perceptions of the soul; it is this mutual relationship, regulated 
beforehand in every substance of the universe, which produces 
what we call their iater-communication and alone constitutes the 
union between the soul and body. And we may understand from 
this how the soul has its seat in the body by an immediate pre- 
sence which could not be greater, for it is there as the unit is in 
the complex of units, which is the multitude. 
15. This hypothesis is very possible. For why could not God 
give to a substance in the beginning a nature or internal force 
which could produce in it to order (as in a spiritual or formal 
automaton, but free here since it has reason to its share), all that 
which should happen to it; that is to say all the appearances or 
expressions it should have, and that without the aid of any 
creature? All the more as the nature of the substance neces- 
sarily demands and essentially includes a progress or change, 
without which it would not have power to act. And this nature 
of the soul, being representative, in a very exact (although 
more or less distinct) manner, of the universe, the series of re- 
presentations which the soul will produce for itself will naturally 
correspond to the series of changes in the universe itself; as, in 
turn, the body has also been accommodated to the soul, for the 
encounters where it is conceived as acting from without. This is 
the more reasonable as bodies are only made for those spirits 
which are capable of entering into communion with God and of 
celebrating His glory. Thus from the moment the possibility of
-P-A-G-E-239
  PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS 27, 
this hypothesis of harmonies is perceived, we perceive also that it 
is the most reasonable and that it gives a marvellous idea of the 
harmony of the universe and of the perfection of the works of 
God. 
16. This great advantage is also found in it, that instead of 
saying that we are FREE only in appearance and in a way prac- 
tically sufficient, as many persons of ability have believed, it 
must rather be said that we are only enchained in appearance, 
and that according to the strictness of metaphysical expressions 
we are in a state of perfect independence as respects the influ- 
ence of all other creatures. This again places in a marvellous 
light the immoriality of the soul and the always uniform pre: 
servation of our individuality, regulated perfectly by its own 
nature beyond the risk of all accidents from without, whatever 
appearance there may be to the contrary. Never has a system 
so clearly proved our high standing. Every spirit, veing like a 
separate world sufficient to itself, independent of every other 
creature, enclosing the infinite, expressing the universe, is as 
durable, as stable and as absolute as the universe of creatures 
itself. Therefore we ought always to appear in it in the way 
best fitted to contribute to the perfection of the society of all 
spirits, which makes their moral union in the city of God. 
Here is found also a new proof of the existence of God, which is 
one of surprising clearness. For this perfect harmony of so 
many substances which have no communication with each 
other, can only come from a common cause. 
17. Besides all these advantages which render this system 
commendable, it can also be said that this is more than an 
hypothesis, since it hardly seems possible to explain the facts in 
any other intelligible manner, and since several great difficulties 
which have exercised the mind up to this time, seem to disap- 
pear of themselves as soon as this system is well understood. 
The customary ways of speaking can still be retained. For we 
can say that the substance, the disposition of which explains 
the changes in others in an intelligible manner (in this respect, 
that it may be supposed that the others have been in this point 
adapted to it since the beginning, according to the order of the
-P-A-G-E-240
218 GOTTFRIED WILHELM VON LEIBNITZ 
decrees of God), is the one which must be conceived of as acting 
upon the others. Also the action of one substance upon another 
is not the emission or transfer of an entity as is commonly be- 
lieved, and cannot be understood reasonably except in the way 
which I have just mentioned. It is true that we can easily con- 
ceive in matter both emissions and receptions of parts, by 
means of which we are right in explaining mechanically all the 
phenomena of physics; but as the material mass is not a sub- 
stance it is apparent that action as regards substance itself can 
only be what I have just said. 
18. These considerations, however metaphysical they may 
appear, have yet a marvellous use in physics in establishing the 
laws of motion, as our Dynamics can make clear. For it can be 
said that in the collision of bodies, each one suffers only by rea- 
son of its own elasticity, because of the motion which is already 
in it. And as to absolute motion, it can in no way be deter- 
mined mathematically, since everything terminates in rela- 
tions; therefore there is always a perfect equality of hypotheses, 
as in astronomy, so that whatever number of bodies may be 
taken it is arbitrary to assign repose or a certain degree of veloc- 
ity to any one that may be chosen, without being refuted by the 
phenomena of straight, circular and composite motion. Never- 
theless it is reasonable to attribute to bodies real movements, 
according to the supposition which explains phenomena in the 
most intelligible manner, since this description is in conformity 
to the idea of action which I have just established. 
XIV. Seconp EXPLANATION OF THE SYSTEM OF THE ComM- 
MUNICATION BETWEEN SUBSTANCES. 1696 
By your [S. Foucher] reflections, sir, I see clearly that the 
thought which one of my friends has published in the Journal 
de Paris has need of explanation.. 
You do not understand, you say, how I could prove that 
which I advanced concerning the communication or harmony 
of two substances so different as the soul and the body. It is 
true that I believe that I have found the means of doing so, and
-P-A-G-E-241
  PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS 219 
this is how I propose to satisfy you. Imagine two clocks or 
watches which agree perfectly. Now, this may take place in 
three ways. The first consists in a mutual influence; the second 
is to have a skillful workman attached to them who regulates 
them and keeps them always in accord; the third is to construct 
these two clocks with so much art and accuracy as to assure their 
future harmony. Put now the soul and the body in place of 
these two clocks; their accordance may be brought about by 
one of these three ways. The way of influence is that of common 
philosophy, but as we cannot conceive of material particles 
which may pass from one of these substances into the other, 
this view must be abandoned. The way of the continual assist- 
ance of the creator is that of the system of occasional causes; 
but I hold that this is to make a Deus ex Machina intervene ina 
natural and ordinary matter, in which, according to reason, he 
ought not to codperate except in the way in which he does in all 
other natural things. Thus there remains only my hypothesis; 
that is, the way of harmony. From the beginning God has 
made each of these two substances of such a nature that 
merely by following its own peculiar laws, received with its 
being, it nevertheless accords with the other, just as if there 
were a mutual influence or as if God always put his hand thereto 
in addition to his general codperation. After this I have no 
need of proving anything, unless you wish to require me to 
prove that God is sufficiently skillful to make use of this pre- 
venient contrivance, examples of which we see even among 
men. Now, taking for granted that he can do it, you easily see 
that this is the way most beautiful and most worthy of him. 
You suspected that my explanation would be opposed to the 
very different idea which we have of the mind and of the body; 
but you will presently clearly see that no one has better estab- 
lished their independence. For while it has been necessary to 
explain their communication by a kind of miracle, occasion has 
always been given to many people to fear that the distinction 
between the body and the soul was not as real as was believed, 
since in order to maintain it it was necessary to go so far. I shall 
not be at all sorry to sound enlightened persons concerning the 
thoughts which I have just explained to you.

XXXII. Tue PrIincipces oF NATURE AND OF GRACE. 1714 
1. Substance is being, capable of action. It is simple or com- 
pound. Simple substance is that which has no parts. Compound 
substance is a collection of simple substances or monads. Monas 
is a Greek word which signifies unity, or that which is one. 
Compounds, or bodies, are multitudes; and simple sub- 
stances, lives, souls, spirits are unities. And there must be 
simple substances everywhere, because without simple sub- 
stances there would be no compounds; and consequently all 
nature is full of life. 
2. Monads, having no parts, cannot be formed or decom- 
posed. They cannot begin or end naturally; and consequently 
last as long as the universe, which will indeed be changed but 
will not be destroyed. They cannot have shapes; otherwise 
they would have parts. And consequently a monad, in itself and 
at a given moment, could not be distinguished from another ex- 
cept by its internal qualities and actions, which can be nothing 
else than its perceptions (that is, representations of the com- 
pound, or of what is external, in the simple), and its appetitions 
(that is, its tendencies from one perception to another), which 
are the principles of change. For the simplicity of substance 
does not prevent multiplicity of modifications, which must be 
found together in this same simple substance, and must consist 
in the variety of relations to things which are external. Just 
as in a centre or point, altogether simple as it is, there is found 
an infinity of angles formed by lines which there meet. 
3. Everything in nature is full. There are everywhere simple 
substances, separated in reality from each other by activities of 
their own which continually change their relations; and each 
simple substance, or monad, which forms the centre of a com- 
pound substance (as, for example, of an animal) and the prin- 
ciple of its unity, is surrounded by a mass composed of an in- 
finity of other monads, which constitute the body proper of 
this central monad; and in accordance with the affections. of 
this it represents, as a centre, the things which are outside of 
itself. And this body is organic, when it forms a sort of automa-
-P-A-G-E-243
  PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS 221 
ton or natural machine; which is a machine not only in its 
entirety, but also in its smallest perceptible parts. And as, be- 
cause of the plenitude of the world, everything is connected and 
each body acts upon every other body, more or less according 
to the distance, and by reaction is itself affected thereby; it fol- 
lows that each monad is a mirror, living or endowed with in- 
ternal activity, representative according to its point of view of 
the universe, and as regulated as the universe itself. And per- 
ceptions in the monad spring one from the other, by the law of 
appetites or by the final causes of good and evil, which consist in 
visible, regulated or unregulated perceptions; just as the 
changes of bodies and external phenomena spring one from 
another, by the laws of efficient causes, that is, of movements. 
Thus there is perfect harmony between the perceptions of the 
monad and the movements of bodies, established at the begin- 
ning between the system of efficient causes and that of final 
causes. And in this consists the accord and physical union 
of the soul and body, although neither one can change the 
laws of the other. 
4. Each monad, with a particular body, makes a living sub- 
stance. Thus there is not only life everywhere, provided with 
members or organs, but also there is an infinity of degrees in 
monads, some dominating more or less over the others. But 
when the monad has organs so adjusted that by means of them 
there is clearness and distinctness in the impressions which it 
receives and consequently in the perceptions which represent 
them (as, for example, when by means of the shape of the 
humors of the eyes, the rays of light are concentrated and act 
with more force); this can extend even to feeling [sentiment], 
that is, even to a perception accompanied by memory, that is, 
one a certain echo of which remains a long time to make itself 
heard upon occasion; and such a living being is called an ani- 
mal, as its monad is called a soul. And when this soul is ele- 
vated to reason it is something more sublime and is reckoned 
among spirits, as will soon be explained. 
It is true that animals are sometimes in the condition of 
simple living beings, and their souls in the condition of simple
-P-A-G-E-244
  222 GOTTFRIED WILHELM VON LEIBNITZ 
monads, namely, when their perceptions are not sufficiently 
distinct to be remembered, as happens in a profound, dreamless 
sleep, or in a swoon. But perceptions which have become en- 
tirely confused must be re-developed in animals, for reasons 
which I shall shortly (§ 12) enumerate. Therefore it is well to 
make a distinction between the perception, which is the internal 
condition of the monad representing external things, and apper- 
ception, which is consciousness or the reflective knowledge of this 
internal state; the latter not being given to all souls, nor at all 
times to the same soul. And it is for want of this distinction 
that the Cartesians have failed, taking no account of the per- 
ceptions of which we are not conscious as people take no ac- 
count of imperceptible bodies. It is this also which made the 
same Cartesians believe that only spirits are monads, that 
there is no soul of brutes, and still less other principles of life. 
And as they shocked too much the common opinion of men 
by refusing feeling to brutes, they have, on the other hand, ac- 
commodated themselves too much to the prejudices of the 
multitude, by confounding a Jong swoon, caused by a great con- 
fusion of perceptions, with death strictly speaking, where all 
perception would cease. This confirmed the ill-founded belief 
in the destruction of some souls, and the bad opinion of some 
so-called strong minds, who have contended against the 
immortality of our soul. 
5. There is a continuity in the perceptions of animals which 
bears some resemblance to reason; but it is only founded in the 
memory of facts, and not at all in the knowledge of causes. Thus 
a dog shuns the stick with which it has been beaten, because 
memory represents to it the pain which the stick has caused it. 
And men in so far as they are empirics, that is to say, in three- 
fourths of their actions, act simply as brutes. For example, we 
expect that there will be daylight to-morrow, because we have 
always had the experience; only an astronomer foresees it by 
reason, and even this prediction will finally fail when the cause 
of day, which is not eternal, shall cease. But true reasoning de- 
pends upon necessary or eternal truths, such as those of logic, 
numbers, geometry, which establish an indubitable connection 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
ee re ee eT eC rT MME gee eee ae 
PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS 223 
of ideas and unfailing consequences. The animals in which 
these consequences are not noticed, are called brutes; but those 
which know these necessary. truths are properly those which 
are called rational animals, and their souls are called spirits. 
These souls are capable of performing acts of reflection, and of 
considering that which is called the ego, substance, monad, soul, 
spirit, in a word, immaterial things and truths. It is this which 
renders us capable of the sciences and of demonstrative know- 
ledge. 
6. Modern researches have taught us, and reason approves 
of it, that living beings whose organs are known to us, that is to 
say, plants and animals, do not come from putrefaction or from 
chaos, as the ancients believed, but from pre-formed seeds, and 
consequently by the transformation of pre-existing living be- 
ings. There are animalcules in the seeds of large animals, which 
by means of conception assume a new dress which they make 
their own and by means of which they can nourish themselves 
and increase their size, in order to pass to a larger theatre and 
to accomplish the propagation of the large animal. It is true 
that the souls of spermatic human animals are not rational and 
do not become so until conception determines these animals to 
the human nature. And as generally animals are not born alto- 
gether in conception or generation, neither do they perish alto- 
gether in what we call death; for it is reasonable that what does 
not begin naturally, should not end either in the order of na- 
ture. Therefore, quitting their mask or their rags, they merely 
return to a more subtile theatre where they can, nevertheless, 
be just as sensitive and just as well regulated as in the larger. 
And what we have just said of large animals, takes place also in 
the generation and death of smaller spermatic animals, in com- 
parison with which the former may pass for large; for every- 
thing extends ad infinitum in nature. 
Thus not only souls, but also animals, are ingenerable and 
imperishable: they are only developed, unfolded, reclothed, 
unclothed, transformed: souls never quit their entire body and 
do not pass from one body into another which is entirely new to 
them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  224 GOTTFRIED WILHELM VON LEIBNITZ 
There is therefore no metempsychosis, but there is metamor- 
phosis; animals change, take and leave only parts: the same 
thing which happens little by little and by small invisible par- 
ticles but continually in nutrition, and suddenly, visibly but 
rarely in conception or death, which cause a gain or loss of 
everything at one time. 
7. Up to this time we have spoken as simple physicists: now 
we must advance to metaphysics by making use of the great prin- 
ciple, little employed in general, which teaches that nothing 
happens without a sufficient reason; that is to say, that nothing 
happens without its being possible for him who should suffi- 
ciently understand things, to give a reason sufficient to deter- 
mine why it is so and not otherwise. This principle laid down, 
the first question which should rightly be asked, would be Why 
is there something rather than nothing? For nothing is simpler 
and easier than something. Further, suppose that things must 
exist, we must be able to give a reason why they must exist so 
and not otherwise. 
8. Now this sufficient reason for the existence of the universe 
could not be found in the series of contingent things, that is, of 
bodies and of their representations in souls; for matter being 
indifferent in itself to motion and to rest and to this or another 
motion, we could not find the reason of motion in it, and still 
less of a certain motion. And although the present motion 
which is in matter, comes from the preceding motion, and that 
from still another preceding, yet in this way we should never 
make any progress, go as far as we might; for the same question 
would always remain. 
Therefore it must be that the sufficient reason which has no 
need of another reason, be outside this series of contingent 
things and be found in a substance which is its cause, or which 
is a necessary being, carrying the reason of its existence within 
itself; otherwise we should still not have a sufficient reason in 
which we could rest. And this final reason of things is called 
God. 
9. This simple primitive substance must contain in itself 
eminently the perfections contained in the derivative sub-
-P-A-G-E-247
  PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS 225 
stances which are its effects; thus it will have perfect power, 
knowledge and will: that is, it will have omnipotence and sover- 
eign goodness. And as justice, taken generally, is only goodness 
conformed to wisdom, there must too be sovereign justice in 
God. The reason which has caused things to exist by him, 
makes them still dependent upon him in existing and in work- 
ing: and they are continually receiving from him that which 
gives them some perfection; but the imperfection which re- 
mains in them, comes from the essential and original limitation 
of the creature. 
10. It follows from the supreme perfection of God, that in 
creating the universe he has chosen the best possible plan, in 
which there is the greatest variety together with the greatest 
order; the best arranged ground, place, time; the most results 
produced in the most simple ways; the most of power, know- 
ledge, happiness and goodness in the creatures that the uni- 
verse could permit. For since all the possibles in the under- 
standing of God laid claim to existence in proportion to their 
perfections, the actual world, as the resultant of all these 
claims, must be the most perfect possible. And without this it 
would not be possible to give a reason why things have turned 
out so rather than otherwise. 
11. The supreme wisdom of God compelled him to choose the 
laws of movement best-adjusted and most suited to abstract or 
metaphysical reasons. He preserves there the same quantity of 
total and absolute force, or of actions; the same quantity of 
respective force or of reaction; lastly the same quantity of di- 
rective force. Farther, action is always equal to reaction, and 
the whole effect is always equivalent to the full cause. And it is 
not surprising that we could not by the mere consideration of 
the efficient causes or of matter, account for those laws of move- 
ment which have been discovered in our time, and a part of 
which have been discovered by myself. For I have found that 
it was necessary to have recourse to final causes, and that these 
laws do not depend upon the principle of necessity, like logical, 
arithmetical and geometrical truths, but upon the principle of 
Jitness, tliat is, upon the choice of wisdom. And this is one of the
-P-A-G-E-248
  226 GOTTFRIED WILHELM VON LEIBNITZ 
most efficacious and evident proofs of the existence of God, to 
those who can examine these matters thoroughly. 
12. It follows, farther, from the perfection of the supreme 
author, that not only is the order of the entire universe the 
most perfect possible, but also that each living mirror repre- 
senting the universe in accordance with its point of view, that 
is to say, that each monad, each substantial centre, must have 
its perceptions and its desires as well regulated as is compatible 
with all the rest. Whence it follows, still farther, that souls, 
that is, the most dominating monads, or rather, animals, can- 
not fail to awaken from the state of stupor in which death or 
some other accident may put them. 
13. For everything in things is regulated once for all with as 
much order and harmony as is possible, supreme wisdom and 
goodness not being able to act except with perfect harmony. 
The present is big with the future, the future could be read in 
the past, the distant is expressed in the near. One could be- 
come acquainted with the beauty of the universe in each soul, 
if one could unfold all its folds, which only develop visibly in 
time. But as each distinct perception of the soul includes in- 
numerable confused perceptions which comprise the whole uni- 
verse, the soul itself knows the things of which it has percep- 
tion only so far as it has distinct and clear perceptions of them. 
Each soul knows the infinite, knows all, but confusedly. As 
in walking on the sea-shore and hearing the great noise which 
it makes, I hear the individual sounds of each wave, of which 
the total sound is composed, but without distinguishing them; 
so our confused perceptions are the result of the impressions 
which the whole universe makes upon us. It is the same with 
each monad. God alone has a distinct consciousness of every- 
thing, for he is the source of all. It has been well said that he is 
as centre everywhere, but that his circumference is nowhere, 
since without any withdrawal from this centre, everything is 
immediately present to him. 
14. As regards the rational soul, or spirit, there is something 
in it more than in the monads, or even in simple souls. It is not 
only a mirror of the universe of creatures, but also an’image of
-P-A-G-E-249
  PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS 227 
the Divinity. The spirit has not only a perception of the works 
of God, but it is even capable of producing something which 
resembles them, although in miniature. For, to say nothing of 
the marvels of dreams where we invent without trouble, and 
even involuntarily, things which when awake we should have 
to think a long time in order to hit upon, our soul is architec- 
tonic in its voluntary actions also, and, discovering the sciences 
according to which God has regulated things (pondere, mensura, 
numero, etc.), it imitates, in its department and in the little 
world where it is permitted to exercise itself, what God does in 
the large world. 
15. This is why all spirits, whether of men or of genii, enter- 
ing by virtue of reason and of the eternal truths into a sort of 
society with God, are members of the City of God, that is to 
say, of the most perfect state, formed and governed by the 
greatest and best of monarchs; where there is no crime without 
punishment, no good actions without proportionate recom- 
pense; and finally as much virtue and happiness as is possible; 
and this is not by a derangement of nature, as if what God pre- 
pares for souls disturbed the laws of bodies, but by the very 
order of natural things, in virtue of the harmony pre-estab- 
lished for all time between the realms of nature and of grace, 
between God as Architect and God as Monarch; so that nature 
leads to grace and grace, while making use of nature, perfects it. 
16. Thus although reason cannot teach us the details, re- 
served to Revelation, of the great future, we can be assured by 
this same reason that things are made in a manner surpassing 
our desires. God also being the most perfect and most happy, 
and consequently, the most lovable of substances, and truly 
pure love consisting in the state which finds pleasure in the per- 
fections and happiness of the loved object, this love ought to 
give us the greatest pleasure of which we are capable, when 
God is its object. 
17. And it is easy to love him as we ought, if we know him as 
I have just described. For although God is not visible to our 
external senses, he does not cease to be very lovable and to give 
very great pleasure. We see how much pleasure honors give
-P-A-G-E-250
    228 GOTTFRIED WILHELM VON LEIBNITZ 
men, although they do not at all consist in the qualities of the 
external senses. i 
Martyrs and fanatics (although the affection of the latter is 
ill-regulated), show what pleasure of the spirit can accomplish; 
and what is more, even sensuous pleasures are reduced to con- 
fusedly known intellectual pleasures. 
Music charms us, although its beauty only consists in the 
harmony of numbers and in the reckoning of the beats or vibra- 
tions of sounding bodies, which meet at certain intervals, of 
which we are not conscious and which the soul does not cease 
to make. The pleasures which sight finds in proportions are of 
the same nature; and those caused by the other senses amount 
to almost the same thing, although we cannot explain it so 
clearly. 
18. It may be said that even from the present time on, the 
love of God makes us enjoy a foretaste of future felicity. And 
although it is disinterested, it itself constitutes our greatest 
good and interest even if we should not seek it therein and 
should consider only the pleasure which it gives, without re- 
gard to the utility it produces; for it gives us perfect confidence 
in the goodness of our author and master, producing a true 
tranquillity of mind; not like the Stoics who force themselves 
to patience, but by a present content which assures us of future 
happiness. And besides the present pleasure, nothing can be 
more useful for the future; for the love of God fulfills our hopes, 
‘too, and leads us in the road of supreme happiness, because by 
virtue of the perfect order established in the universe, every- 
thing is done in the best possible way, as much for the general 
good as for the greatest individual good of those who are con- 
vinced of this and are content with the divine government; 
this conviction cannot be wanting to those who know how to 
love the source of all good. It is true that supreme felicity, by 
whatever beatific vision or knowledge of God it be accompanied, 
can never be full; because, since God is infinite, he cannot be 
wholly known. Therefore our happiness will never, and ought 
not to, consist in full joy, where there would be nothing farther 
to desire, rendering our mind stupid; but in a perpetual pro- 
gress to new pleasures and to new perfections.

(1679-1754) 
RATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
Translated from the Latin * by 
EDWARD KENNARD RAND 
THE ESSENCE AND NATURE OF THE SOUL 
§ 48. The soul is a simple substance. For the soul is not body 
(§ 47) nor an attribute communicated to the body (§ 46), and 
further, neither is it a composite entity nor does it inhere in a 
composite entity (§ 119, Cosmol.1). Wherefore since every entity 
is either composite or simple (§ 532, 673, Ontol.”) the soul must 
be a simple entity. 
Now since acts of thought continually change and succeed 
one another in turn, they are to be classed with modes (§ 151, 
Ontol.) The soul, therefore, to which these modes apply, is sub- 
ject to modification (§ 764, Ontol.), and since it is obvious that 
the soul lasts for some time in conjunction with the body (for 
whether it can exist apart from the body or not need not be 
established here) it is per durable (§ 766, Ontol.). Certainly a 
per durable and modifiable object is a substance. Therefore 
the soul is a substance. 
But the soul is a simple entity by the foregoing proof. There- 
fore it is a simple substance. 
§ 53. Ihe soul is endowed with a certain power. The soul is 
a substance (§ 48), and since perceptions succeed one another in 
the same, and desires spring from perceptions, and perceptions

again from desires, as is generally admitted in Empiric Psy- 
chology, its condition changes (§ 709, Ontol.). It therefore is 
endowed with a certain power. (§ 776, Ontol.). 
§ 54. A power and a faculty of the soul are different from one 
another. For power consists in the continual endeavor to act 
(§ 724, Ontol.). Faculties are merely potencies of action on the 
part of the soul (§ 29, Psych. Empir.1), and thus have possibili- 
ties of action (§ 716, Ontol.). Therefore a power of the soul and 
a faculty differ irom one another (§ 183, Ontol.). 
§56. The soul continually tends to change its conditions. For it 
is endowed with a certain power. Wherefore, since a power 
continually tends to change the condition of the subject in 
which it is (§ 725, Ontol.), the soul, too, through the mediation 
of its own power, is bound to tend continually to change its 
condition. 
§57- The power of the soul is absolutely simple. For the soul 
is simple and thus lacks parts (§ 673, Ontol.). Let us now sup- 
pose that the soul has more than one power distinct from one 
another; since each one of them consists in the continued 
endeavor to act (§ 724, Oniol.), each one requires a particular 
subject in which it is. And so we must conceive of several 
actual entities distinct from one another (§ 142, 183, Ontol.); 
which when taken together with the soul will be the parts of the 
same (§ 341, Ontol.). But this is altogether absurd by the proof 
above given. 
§ 62. The soul re-presents to itself this universe in accordance 
with the location of its organic body in the universe, conformably 
to the mutations which affect the organs of sensation. For this 
law of sensations is constant and inviolable: if a certain muta- 
tion is produced in some organ of sensation by some sensible 
object there coexists in the soul a sensation which may be ex- 
plained to it in an intelligible way, or which recognises in it a 
sufficient reason why it should be, and why it should be such as 
it is. (§85, Psychol. Empir.) Now sensations are perceptions 
of external objects, which produce a change in the organs of sen- 
sation (§67, Psychol. Empir.), and hence while the soul feels, it

re-presents those objects to itself (§ 24, Psychol. Empir.). And 
since our body is constantly in this visible world, bodies also 
which compose the same (§ 119, Cosmol.) act constantly upon 
our body in accordance with its location in the world, or the 
universe. It is clear, therefore, that the soul re-presents to 
itself this universe, or this visible world, in accordance with the 
location of our organic body in the universe, and conformably 
to the mutations which the bodies of which it is composed 
produce in the same. When we sleep we perceive nothing 
clearly and distinctly (§ 15). However since the soul is still in a 
condition of preception, although all its conceptions are con- 
fused or obscure, there is nothing to prevent it from still per- 
ceiving obscurely its own body, and the things that impress it, 
and hence from continuing this re-presentation of the world, so 
that therefore it may be said without reservation that it 
re-presents to itself this universe. 
§ 66. The essence of the soul consists in its power of re-presenting 
(vis representiva) the universe, which power is materially limited 
by its location in an organic body in the universe, and formally 
limited by the constitution of the sensory organs. For this power 
is the first principle which is conceived with regard to the soul, 
and on which depend the other attributes which are inherent in 
it (§ 65). Therefore the essence of the soul consists in the same 
(§ 168, Ontol.). 
§ 67. The nature of the soul consists in the same re-presenting 
power (vis representiva). For by this power of the soul every- 
thing is activated that is possible through the faculties of the 
soul, Wherefore since we understand by the nature of the soul 
that principle of mutations in the soul which is intrinsic in the 
same, just as by the nature of the universe we understand that 
principle of mutations in the world which is intrinsic in the 
same (§ 503, Cosmol.); and since this principle of mutations is 
power (§ 807, Ontol.), and since the power with which the soul 
is endowed (§ 53) is only the power of re-presenting (vis 
representiva) the universe (§ 62), that power of re-presenting 
(vis representiva) the universe is likewise the nature of the 
soul.

AN ESSAY CONCERNING HUMAN UNDER- 
STAN DING* 
BOOK I 
CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION 
(1. An inquiry into the understanding, pleasant and useful. — 
Since itis the wnderstanding that sets man above the rest of sens- 
ible beings, and gives him all the advantage and dominion 
which he has over them, it is certainly a subject, even for its 
nobleness, worth our labour to inquire into. The understand- 
ing, like the eye, whilst it makes us see and perceive all other 
things, takes no notice of itself; and it requires art and pains to 
set it at a distance, and makeit its own object. But whatever be 
the difficulties that lie in the way of this inquiry, whatever it be 
that keeps us so much in the dark to ourselves, sure I am that 
all the light we can let in upon our own minds, all the acquaint- 
ance we can make with our own understandings, will not only 
be very pleasant, but bring us great advantage in directing 
our thoughts in the search of other things,” 
2. Design. — This therefore being my purpose, to inquire 
into the original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge, 
together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and 
assent, I shall not at present meddle with the physical con- 
sideration of the mind, or trouble myself to examine wherein its 
essence consists or by what motions of our spirits, or alterations 
of our bodies, we come to have any sensation by our organs, or 
any ideas in our understandings; and whether those ideas do, in 
their formation, any or all of them, depend on matter or not:

these are speculations which, however curious and entertaining, 
I shall decline, as lying out of my way in the design I am now 
upon. It shall suffice to my present purpose, to consider the dis- 
cerning faculties of a man, as they are employed about the 
objects which they have to do with; and I shall imagine I have 
not wholly misemployed myself in the thoughts I shall have on 
this occasion, if, in this historical, plain method, I can give any 
account of the ways whereby our understandings come to 
attain those notions of things we have, and can set down any 
measures of the certainty of our knowledge, or the grounds of 
those persuasions which are to be found amongst men, so vari- 
ous, different, and wholly contradictory; and yet asserted 
somewhere or other with such assurance and confidence, that he 
that shall take a view of the opinions of mankind, observe their 
opposition, and at the same time consider the fondness and 
devotion wherewith they are embraced, the resolution and 
eagerness wherewith they are maintained, may perhaps have 
reason to suspect that either there is no such thing as truth at 
all, or that mankind hath no sufficient means to attain a certain 
knowledge of it. 
3. Method. — It is therefore worth while to search out the 
bounds between opinion and knowledge, and examine by what 
measures, in things whereof we have no certain knowledge, we 
ought to regulate our assent, and moderate our persuasions. In 
order whereunto, I shall pursue this following method: — 
First. I shall inquire into the original of those ideas, notions, 
or whatever else you please to call them, which a man observes, 
and is conscious to himself he has in his mind; and the ways 
whereby the understanding comes to be furnished with them. 
Secondly. I shall endeavour to show what knowledge the 
understanding hath by those ideas, and the certainty, evidence, 
and extent of it. 
Thirdly. I shall make some inquiry into the nature and 
grounds of faith or opinion; whereby I mean, that assent which 
we give to any proposition as true, of whose truth yet we have 
no certain knowledge: and here we shall have occasion to 
examine the reasons and degrees of assent.

BOOK II 
CHAPTER I. OF IDEAS IN GENERAL, AND THEIR 
ORIGINAL 
1. Idea is the object of thinking. — Every man being con- 
scious of himself, that he thinks, and that which his mind is 
applied about, whilst thinking, being the ideas that are there, it 
is past doubt that men havein their mind several ideas, such as 
are those expressed by the words, whiteness, hardness, sweet- 
ness, thinking, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness, and 
others: it is in the first place then to be inquired, How he comes 
by them? I know it is a received doctrine, that men have native 
ideas and original characters stamped upon their minds in their 
very first being. This opinion I have at large examined already; 
and, I suppose, what I have said in the foregoing book will be 
much more easily admitted, when I have shown whence the 
understanding may get all the ideas it has, and by what ways 
and degrees they may come into the mind; for which I shall 
appeal to every one’s own observation and experience. 
2. All ideas come from sensation or reflection. — Let us then 
suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all char- 
acters, without any ideas: How comes it to be furnished? 
Whence comes it by that vast store, which the busy and bound- 
less fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless 
variety? Whence has it all the materials of reason and know- 
ledge? To this I answer, in one word, From experience. In that 
all our knowledge is founded, and from that it ultimately 
derives itself. Our observation, employed either about external 
sensible objects, or about the internal operations of our mind, 
perceived and reflected on by ourselves, is that which supplies 
our understandings with all the materials of thinking. These 
two are the fountains of knowledge, from whence all the ideas 
we have, or can naturally have, do spring. _ 
3. The object of sensation one source of ideas. — First. Our 
senses, conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey 
into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according
-P-A-G-E-257
  CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING 235 
to those various ways wherein those objects do affect them; and 
thus we come by those ideas we have of yellow, white, heat, 
cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sens- 
ible qualities; which when I say the senses convey into the 
mind, I mean, they from external objects convey into the mind 
what produces there those perceptions. This great source 
of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon our 
senses, and derived by them to the understanding, I call, 
SENSATION. 
4. The operations of our minds the other source of them.— 
Secondly. The other fountain, from which experience furnish- 
eth the understanding with ideas, is the perception of the opera- 
tions of our own minds within us, as it is employed about the 
ideas it has got; which operations when the soul comes to reflect 
on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set 
of ideas which could not be had from things without; and such 
are perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, know- 
ing, willing, and all the different actings of our own minds; 
which we, being conscious of, and observing in ourselves, do 
from these receive into our understandings as distinct ideas, as 
we do from bodies affecting our senses. This source of ideas 
every man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense as 
having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, 
and might properly enough be called internal sense. But as I 
call the other sensation, so I call this REFLECTION, the ideas it 
affords being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its 
own operations within itself. By reflection, then, in the follow- 
ing part of this discourse, I would be understood to mean that 
notice which the mind takes of its own operations, and the 
manner of them, by reason whereof there come to be ideas of 
these operations in the understanding. These two, I say, viz., 
external material things as the objects of sensation, and the 
operations of our own minds within as the objects of reflection, 
are, to me, the only originals from whence all our ideas take 
their beginnings. The term operations here, I use in a large 
sense, as comprehending not barely the actions of the mind 
about its ideas, but some sort of passions arising sometimes
-P-A-G-E-258
236 JOHN LOCKE 
from them, such as is the satisfaction or uneasiness arising 
from any thought. 
5. All our ideas are of the one or the other of these. — The 
understanding seems to me not to have the least glimmering of 
any ideas which it doth not receive from one of these two, Ex- 
ternal objects furnish the mind with the ideas of sensible quali- 
ties, which are all those different perceptions they produce in 
us; and the mind furnishes the understanding with ideas of its 
own operations. 
These, when we have taken a full survey of them, and their 
several modes [combinations, and relations], we shall find to 
contain all our whole stock of ideas; and that we have nothing 
in our minds which did not come in one of these two ways. Let 
any. one examine his own thoughts, and thoroughly search into 
his understanding, and then let him tell me, whether all the 
original ideas he has there, are any other than of the objects of 
his senses, or of the operations of his mind considered as objects 
of his reflection; and how great a mass of knowledge soever he 
imagines to be lodged there, he will, upon taking a strict view, 
see that he has not any idea in his mind but what one of these 
two have imprinted, though perhaps with infinite variety com- 
pounded and enlarged by the understanding, as we shall see 
hereafter. 
CHAPTER II. OF SIMPLE IDEAS 
1. Uncompounded appearances. — The better to understand 
the nature, manner, and extent of our knowledge, one thing 
is carefully to be observed concerning the ideas we have; and 
that is, that some of them are simple, and some complex. 
Though the qualities that affect our senses are, in the things 
themselves, so united and blended that there is no separation, 
no distance between them; yet it is plain the ideas they produce 
in the mind enter by the senses simple and unmixed. For 
though the sight and touch often take in from the same object, 
at the same time, different ideas — as a man sees at once
-P-A-G-E-259
  CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING 237 
motion and colour, the hand feels softness and warmth in the 
same piece of wax — yet the simple ideas thus united in the 
same subject are as perfectly distinct as those that come in by 
different senses; the coldness and hardness which a man feels in 
a piece of ice being as distinct ideas in the mind as the smell and 
whiteness of a lily, or as the taste of sugar and smell of a rose: 
and there is nothing can be plainer to a man than the clear and 
distinct perception he has of those simple ideas; which, being 
each in itself uncompounded, contains in it nothing but one 
uniform appearance or conception in the mind, and is not dis- 
tinguishable into different ideas. 
2. The mind can neither make nor destroy them. — These 
simple ideas, the materials of all our knowledge, are suggested 
and furnished to the mind only by those two ways above men- 
tioned, viz., sensation and reflection. When the understanding 
is once stored with these simple ideas, it has the power to 
repeat, compare, and unite them, even to an almost infinite 
variety, and so can make at pleasure new complex ideas. But 
it is not in the power of the most exalted wit or enlarged under- 
standing, by any quickness or variety of thought, to invent or 
frame one new simple idea in the mind, not taken in by the 
ways before mentioned; nor can any force of the understand- 
ing destroy those that are there: the dominion of man in this 
little world of his own understanding, being much-what the 
same as it is in the great world of visible things, wherein his 
power, however managed by art and skill, reaches no farther 
than to compound and divide the materials that are made to 
his hand but can do nothing towards the making the least par- 
ticle of new matter, or destroying one atom of what is already 
inybeingy’.22; 
CHAPTER III. OF SIMPLE IDEAS OF SENSE 
1. Division of simple ideas. — The better to conceive the 
ideas we receive from sensation, it may not be amiss for us to 
consider them in reference to the different ways whereby they 
make their approaches to our minds, and make themselves per- 
ceivable by us. ;
-P-A-G-E-260
  238 JOHN LOCKE 
First, then, there are some which come into our minds by one 
sense only. 
Secondly. There are others that convey themselves into the 
mind by more senses than one. 
Thirdly. Others that are had from reflection only. 
Fourthly. There are some that make themselves way, and 
are suggested to the mind, by all the ways of sensation and 
reflection. 
We shall consider them apart under these several heads. , 
1. There are some ideas which have admittance only through 
one sense, which is peculiarly adapted to receive them. Thus 
light and colours, as white, red, yellow, blue, with their several 
degrees or shades and mixtures, as green, scarlet, purple, sea- 
green, and the rest, come in only by the eyes; all kinds of 
noises, sounds, and tones, only by the ears; the several tastes 
and smells, by the nose and palate. And if these organs, or the 
nerves which are the conduits to convey them from without to 
their audience in the brain, the mind’s presence-room (as I 
may so call it), are, any of them, so disordered as not to perform 
their functions, they have no postern to be admitted by, no 
other way to bring themselves into view, and be received by 
the understanding. 
The most considerable of those belonging to the touch are 
heat, and cold, and solidity; all the rest — consisting almost 
wholly in the sensible configuration, as smooth and rough; or 
else more or less firm adhesion of the parts, as hard and soft, 
tough and brittle — are obvious enough. 
2. I think it will be needless to enumerate all the particular 
simple ideas belonging to each sense. Nor indeed is it possible 
if we would, there being a great many more of them belonging 
to most of the senses than we have names for. . . . I shall 
therefore, in the account of simple ideas I am here giving, con- 
tent myself to set down only such as are most material to our 
present purpose, or are in themselves less apt to be taken notice 
of, though they are very frequently the ingredients of our com- 
plex ideas; amongst which I think I may well account “‘solid- 
ity,” which therefore I shall treat of in the next chapter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING 239 
CHAPTER IV. IDEA OF SOLIDITY 
1. We receive this idea from touch. — The idea of solidity we 
receive by our touch; and it arises from the resistance which we 
find in body to the entrance of any other body into the place it 
possesses, till it has left it. There is no idea which we receive 
more constantly from sensation than solidity. Whether we 
move or rest, in what posture soever we are, we always feel 
something under us that supports us, and hinders our farther 
sinking downwards; and the bodies which we daily handle make 
us perceive that whilst they remain between them, they do, by 
an insurmountable force, hinder the approach of the parts of our 
hands that press them. That which thus hinders the approach 
of two bodies, when they are moving one towards another, I 
call solidity. I will not dispute whether this acceptation of the 
word “solid” be nearer to its original signification than that . 
which mathematicians use it in; it suffices that, I think, the 
common notion of “solidity,” will allow, if not justify, this use 
of it; but if any one think it better to call it zmpenetrability, he 
has my consent. Only I have thought the term solidity the 
more proper to express this idea, not only because of its vulgar 
use in that sense, but also because it carries something more of 
positive in it than impenetrability, which is negative, and is, 
perhaps, more a consequence of solidity than solidity itself. 
This, of all other, seems the idea most intimately connected 
with and essential to body, so as nowhere else to be found or 
imagined but only in matter; and though our senses take no 
notice of it but in masses of matter, of a bulk sufficient to cause 
a sensation in us; yet the mind, having once got this idea from 
such grosser sensible bodies, traces it farther and considers it, 
as well as figure, in the minutest particle of matter that can 
exist, and finds it inseparably inherent in body, wherever or 
however modified. 
2. Solidity fills space. — This is the idea which belongs to 
body, whereby we conceive it to fill space. The idea of which 
filling of space is, that where we imagine any space taken up by 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
240 JOHN LOCKE 
a solid substance, we conceive it so to possess it that it excludes 
all other solid substances, and will for ever hinder any two 
other bodies, that move towards one another in a straight line, 
from coming to touch one another, unless it removes from be- 
tween them in a line not parallel to that which they move in. 
This idea of it, the bodies which we ordinarily handle suffi- 
ciently furnish us with. 
6. What it is. — If any one asks me, What this solidity is, I 
send him to his senses to inform him: let him put a flint or a 
football between his hands, and then endeavour to join them, 
and he will know. If he thinks this not a sufficient explication 
of solidity, what it is, and wherein it consists, I promise to tell 
him what it is, and wherein it consists, when he tells me what 
thinking is, or wherein it consists; or explains to me what ex- 
tension or motion is, which perhaps seems much easier. The 
simple ideas we have are such as experience teaches them us; 
but if, beyond that, we endeavour by words to make them 
clearer in the mind, we shall succeed no better than if we went 
about to clear up the darkness of a blind man’s mind by talking, 
and to discourse into him the ideas of light and colours. The 
reason of this I shall show in another place. 
CHAPTER VI. OF SIMPLE IDEAS OF REFLECTION 
1. Simple ideas of reflection are the operations of the mind 
about its other ideas. — The mind, receiving the ideas men- 
tioned in the foregoing chapters from without, when it turns its 
view inward upon itself, and observes its own actions about 
those ideas it has, takes from thence other ideas, which are as 
capable to be the objects of its contemplation as any of those it 
received from foreign things. 
2. The idea of perception, and idea of willing, we have from 
reflection. — The two great and principal actions of the mind, 
which are most frequently considered, and which are so fre- 
quent that every one that pleases may take notice of them in 
himself, are these two: Perception or Thinking; and Volition or 
Willing. [The power of thinking is called the Understanding,
-P-A-G-E-263
  CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING 241 
and the power of volition is called the Will; and these two powers 
or abilities in the mind are denominated “‘faculties.”] . . . 
CHAPTER VII. OF SIMPLE IDEAS OF BOTH SENSA- 
TION AND REFLECTION 
1. Pleasure and pain. — There be other simple ideas which 
convey themselves into the mind by all the ways of sensation 
and reflection; viz., pleasure or delight, and its opposite, pain or 
uneasiness; power, existence, unity. 
2. Delight or uneasiness, one or other of them, join them- 
selves to almost all our ideas both of sensation and reflection; 
and there is scarce any affection of our senses from without, any 
retired thought of our mind within, which is not able to produce 
in us pleasure or pain. By “pleasure” and “‘pain,”’ I would be 
understood to signify whatsoever delights or molests us; whether 
it arises from the thoughts of our minds, or any thing operating 
on our bodies. For whether we call it “satisfaction, delight, 
pleasure, happiness,”’ &c., on the one side; or ‘uneasiness, 
trouble, pain, torment, anguish, misery,” &c., on the other; 
they are still but different degrees of the same thing, and belong 
to the ideas of pleasure and pain, delight or uneasiness; which 
are the names I shall most commonly use for those two sorts of 
ideas. 
6. Pleasure and pain. — Though what I have here said may 
not perhaps make the ideas of pleasure and pain clearer to us 
than our own experience does, which is the only way that we 
are capable of having them; yet the consideration of the reason 
why they are annexed to so many other ideas, serving to give us 
due sentiments of the wisdom and goodness of the Sovereign 
Disposer of all things, may not be unsuitable to the main end of 
these inquiries: the knowledge and veneration of Him being the 
chief end of all our thoughts, and the proper business of all our 
understandings. 
7. Existence and unity. — Existence and unity are two other 
ideas that are suggested to the understanding by every object 
without, and every idea within. When ideas are in our minds,
-P-A-G-E-264
  242 JOHN LOCKE 
we consider them as being actually there, as well as we consider 
things to be actually without us: which is, that they exist, or 
have existence: and whatever we can consider as one thing, 
whether a real being or idea, suggests to the understanding 
the idea of unity. 
8. Power. — Power also is another of those simple ideas 
which we receive from sensation and reflection. For, observing 
in ourselves that we do and can think, and that we can at 
pleasure move several parts of our bodies which were at rest; 
the effects also that natural bodies are able to produce in one 
another occurring every moment to our senses, we both these 
ways get the idea of power. 
g. Succession. — Besides these there is another idea, which 
though suggested by our senses, yet is more constantly offered 
us by what passes in our minds; and that is the idea of succes- 
sion. For if we look immediately into ourselves, and reflect on 
what is observable there, we shall find our ideas always, whilst 
we are awake or have any thought, passing in train, one going 
and another coming without intermission. 
10. Simple ideas the materials of all our knowledge. — These, 
if they are not all, are at least (as I think) the most considerable 
of those simple ideas which the mind has, and out of which is 
made all its other knowledge: all of which it receives only by the 
two forementioned ways of sensation and reflection. 
CHAPTER VIII. SOME FURTHER CONSIDERA- 
TIONS CONCERNING OUR SIMPLE 
IDEAS OF SENSATION 
4. Ideas in the mind, qualities in bodies. — To discover the 
nature of our ideas the better, and to discourse of them intel- 
ligibly, it will be convenient to distinguish them, as they are 
ideas or perceptions in our minds: and as they are modifica- 
tions of matter in the bodies that cause such perceptions in us; 
that so we may not think (as perhaps usually is done) that they 
are exactly the images and resemblances of something inherent
-P-A-G-E-265
  CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING 243 
in the subject; most of those of sensation being in the mind no 
more the likeness of something existing without us than the 
names that stand for them are the likeness of our ideas, which 
yet upon hearing they are apt to excite in us. 
8. Whatsoever the mind perceives in itself, or is the immedi- 
ate object of perception, thought, or understanding, that I call 
idea; and the power to produce any idea in our mind, I call 
quality of the subject wherein that power is. Thus a snowball 
having the power to produce in us the ideas of white, cold, and 
round, the powers to produce those ideas in us as they are in the 
snowball, I call qualities; and as they are sensations or percep- 
tions in our understandings, I call them “‘ideas”; which ideas, 
if I speak of them sometimes as in the things themselves, I 
would be understood to mean those qualities in the objects 
which produce them in us. 
9. Primary qualities. — [Qualities thus considered in bodies 
are, First, such as are utterly inseparable from the body, in what 
estate soever it be;] and such as, in all the alterations and 
changes it suffers, all the force can be used upon it, it constantly 
keeps; and such as sense constantly finds in every particle of 
matter which has bulk enough to be perceived, and the mind 
finds inseparable from every particle of matter, though less than . 
to make itself singly be perceived by our senses; ¢.g., take a grain 
of wheat, divide it into two parts, each part has still solidity, 
extension, figure, and mobility; divide it again, and it retains 
still the same qualities: and so divide it on till the parts become 
insensible, they must retain still each of them all those quali- 
ties. For, division (which is all that a mill or pestle or any other 
body does upon another, in reducing it to insensible parts) can 
never take away either solidity, extension, figure, or mobility 
from any body, but only makes two or more distinct separate 
masses of matter of that which was but one before; all which 
distinct masses, reckoned as so many distinct bodies, after divi- 
sion, make a certain number. [These I call original or primary 
qualities of body, which I think we may observe to produce 
simple ideas in us, viz., solidity, extension, figure, motion or 
rest, and number. 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
en ee ne re ee rn. eee 
244 JOHN LOCKE 
10. Secondary qualities. — Secondly. Such qualities, which 
in truth are nothing in the objects themselves, but powers to 
produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities, i.e., 
by the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of their insensible 
parts, as colours, sounds, tastes, &c., these I call secondary 
qualities. To these might be added a third sort, which are 
allowed to be barely powers, though they are as much real qual- 
ities in the subject as those which I, to comply with the com- 
mon way of speaking, call qualities, but, for distinction, second- 
ary qualities. For, the power in fire to produce a new colour or 
consistency in wax or clay, — by its primary qualities, is as 
much a quality in fire as the power it has to produce in me a 
new idea or sensation of warmth or burning, which I felt not 
before, — by the same primary qualities, viz., the bulk, texture, 
and motion of its insensible parts.] 
11. [How primary qualities produce their ideas. — The next 
thing to be considered is, how bodies produce ideas in us; and 
that is manifestly by impulse, the only way which we can con- 
ceive bodies to operate in.] 
12. If, then, external objects be not united to our minds 
when they produce ideas therein; and yet we perceive these 
original qualities in such of them as singly fall under our senses, 
“it is evident that some motion must be thence continued by our 
nerves, or animal spirits, by some parts of our bodies, to the 
brains or the seat of sensation, there to produce in our minds 
the particular ideas we have of them. And since the extension, 
figure, number, and motion of bodies of an observable bigness, 
may be perceived at a distance by the sight, it is evident some 
singly imperceptible bodies must come from them to the eyes, 
and thereby convey to the brain some motion which produces 
these ideas which we have of them in us. 
13. How secondary. — After the same manner that the ideas 
of these original qualities are produced in us, we may conceive 
that the ideas of secondary qualities are also produced, viz., by 
the operation of insensible particles on our senses. For it being 
manifest that there are bodies, and good store of bodies, each 
whereof are so small that we cannot by any of our senses dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
  
CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING 245 
cover either their bulk, figure, or motion (as is evident in the 
particles of the air and water, and other extremely smaller than 
those, perhaps as much smaller than the particles of air or water 
as the particles of air or water are smaller than peas or hail- 
stones): let us suppose at present that the different motions and 
figures, bulk and number, of such particles, effecting the several 
organs of our senses, produce in us those different sensations 
which we have from the colours and smells of bodies; e.g., that 
a violet, by the impulse of such insensible particles of matter of 
peculiar figures and bulks, and in different degrees and modifi- 
cations of their motions, causes the ideas of the blue colour and 
sweet scent of that flower to’be produced in our minds; it being 
no more impossible to conceive that God should annex such 
ideas to such motions, with which they have no similitude, than 
that he should annex the idea of pain to the motion of a piece of 
steel dividing our flesh, with which the idea hath no resem- 
blance. 
14. What I have said concerning colours and smells may be 
understood also of tastes and sounds, and other the like sens- 
ible qualities; which, whatever reality we by mistake attribute 
to them, are in truth nothing in the objects themselves, but 
powers to produce various sensations in us, and depend on 
those primary qualities, viz., bulk, figure, texture, and motion 
of parts [as I have said]. 
15. Ideas of primary qualities are resemblances; of secondary, 
not. — From whence I think it is easy to draw this observation, 
that the ideas of primary qualities of bodies are resemblances of 
them, and their patterns do really exist in the bodies them- 
selves; but the ideas produced in us by these secondary qual- 
ities have no resemblance of them at all. There is nothing like 
our ideas existing in the bodies themselves. They are, in the 
bodies we denominate from them, only a power to produce 
those sensations in us; and what is sweet, blue, or warm in idea, 
is but the certain bulk, figure, and motion of the insensible parts 
in the bodies themselves, which we call so. 
23. Three sorts of qualities in bodies. —'The qualities then 
that are in bodies, rightly considered, are of three sorts: —
-P-A-G-E-268
  246 JOHN LOCKE 
First. The bulk, figure, number, situation, and motion or 
rest of their solid parts; those are in them, whether we perceive 
them or not; and when they are of that size that we can dis- 
cover them, we have by these ideas of the thing as it is in itself, 
as is plain in artificial things. These I call primary qualities. 
Secondly. The power that is in any body, by reason of its 
insensible primary qualities, to operate after a peculiar manner 
on any of our senses, and thereby produce in us the different 
ideas of several colours, sounds, smells, tastes, &c. These are 
usually called sensible qualities. 
Thirdly. The power that is in any body, by reason of the 
particular constitution of its primary qualities, to make such a 
change in the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of another body, 
as to make it operate on our senses differently from what it did 
before. Thus the sun has a power to make wax white, and fire, 
to make lead fluid. [These are usually called powers.] 
The first of these, as has been said, I think may be properly 
called real, original, or primary qualities, because they are in 
the things themselves, whether they are perceived or no; and 
upon their different modifications it is that the secondary qual- 
ities depend. 
The other two are only powers to act differently upon other 
things, which powers result from the different modifications of 
those primary qualities. 
CHAPTER IX. OF PERCEPTION 
1. Perception the first simple idea of reflection. — Perception, 
as it is the first faculty of the mind exercised about our ideas, 
so it is the first and simplest idea we have from reflection, and 
is by some called “thinking” in general. Though thinking, in 
the propriety of the English tongue, signifies that sort of opera- 
tion of the mind about its ideas wherein the mind is active; 
where it, with some degree of voluntary attention, considers 
any thing: for in bare, naked perception, the mind is, for the 
most part, only passive, and what it perceives it cannot avoid 
perceiving.
-P-A-G-E-269
  CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING 247 
2. Is only when the mind receives the impression. —What 
perception is, every one will know better by reflecting on what 
he does himself, when he sees, hears, feels, &c., or thinks, than 
by any discourse of mine. Whoever reflects on what passes in 
his own mind, cannot miss it; and if he does not reflect, all the 
words in the world cannot make him have any notion of it. 
3. This is certain, that whatever alterations are made in the 
body, if they reach not the mind; whatever impressions are 
made on the outward parts, if they are not taken notice of 
within; there is no perception. Fire may burn our bodies with 
no other effect than it does a billet, unless the motion be con- 
tinued to the brain, and there the sense of heat or idea of pain 
be produced in the mind, wherein consists actual perception. 
8. Ideas of sensation often changed by the judgment. — We are 
farther to consider concerning perception, that the ideas we 
receive by sensation are often in grown people altered by the 
judgment without our taking notice of it. When we set before 
our eyes a round globe of any uniform colour, e.g., gold, ala- 
baster, or jet, it is certain that the idea thereby imprinted in 
our mind is of a flat circle variously shadowed, with several 
degrees of light and brightness coming to our eyes. But we 
having, by use, been accustomed to perceive what kind of ap- 
pearance convex bodies are wont to make in us; what altera- 
tions are made in the reflections of light by the difference of the 
sensible figures of bodies; the judgment presently, by an habit- 
ual custom, alters the appearances into their causes; so that, 
from that which truly is variety of shadow or colour collecting 
the figure, it makes it pass for a mark of figure, and frames to 
itself the perception of a convex figure and an uniform colour; 
when the idea we receive from thence is only a plane variously 
coloured, as is evident in painting. [To which purpose I shall 
here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious pro- 
moter of real knowledge, the learned and worthy Mr. Molin- 
eaux, which he was pleased to send me in a letter some months 
since: and it is this: “Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, 
and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a 
sphere of the same metal, and nighly of. the same bigness, so as
-P-A-G-E-270
    248 JOHN LOCKE 
to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which 
the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a 
table, and the blind man to be made to see; quere, Whether by 
his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and 
tell which is the globe, which the cube?” To which the acute 
and judicious proposer answers: “Not. For though he has 
obtained the experience of how a globe, how a cube, affects his 
touch; yet he has not yet obtained the experience, that what 
affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so; or that a 
protuberant angle in the cube, that pressed his hand unequally, 
shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube.”’ I agree with this 
thinking gentleman whom I am proud to call my friend, in his 
answer to this his problem; and am of opinion, that the blind 
man, at first sight, would not be able with certainty to say 
which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; 
though he could unerringly name them by his touch, and cer- 
tainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt. 
This I have set down, and leave with my reader, as an occasion 
for him to consider how much he may be beholden to experi- - 
ence, improvement, and acquired notions, where he thinks he 
has not the least use of, or help from them. And the rather, 
because this observing gentleman farther adds, that having 
upon the occasion of my book proposed this to divers very 
ingenious men, he hardly ever met with one that at first gave 
the answer to it which he thinks true, till by hearing his reasons 
they were convinced.] 
9. But this is not, I think, usual in any of our ideas but those 
received by sight; because sight, the most comprehensive of all 
our senses, conveying to our minds the ideas of light and col- 
ours, which are peculiar only to that sense; and also the far 
different ideas of space, figure and motion, the several varieties 
whereof change the appearances of its proper objects, viz., light 
and colours; we bring ourselves by use to judge of the one by 
the other. This, in many cases, by a settled habit in things 
whereof wehave frequent experience, is performed so constantly 
and so quick, that we take that for the perception of our sensa- 
tion which is an idea formed by our judgment; so that one, viz., 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING 249 
that of sensation, serves only to excite the other, and is scarce 
taken notice of itself; as a man who reads or hears with atten- 
tion and understanding, takes little notice of the characters or 
sounds, but of the ideas that are excited in him by them. 
15. Perception the inlet of knowledge. — Perception, then, 
being the first step and degree towards knowledge, and the inlet 
of all the materials of it, the fewer senses any man as well as any 
other creature hath; and the fewer and duller the impressions 
are that are made by them; and the duller the faculties are that 
are employed about them, — the more remote are they from 
that knowledge which is to be found in some men. But this, 
being in great variety of degrees (as may be perceived amongst 
men), cannot certainly be discovered in the several species of 
animals, much less in their particular individuals. It suffices 
me only to have remarked here, that perception is the first 
operation* of all our intellectual faculties, and the inlet of all 
knowledge into our minds. . . . 
CHAPTER XII. OF COMPLEX IDEAS 
1. Made by the mind out of simple ones. — We have hitherto 
considered those ideas, in the reception whereof the mind is 
only passive, which are those simple ones received from sensa- 
tion and reflection before mentioned, whereof the mind cannot 
make one to itself, nor have any idea which does not wholly 
consist of them. [But as the mind is wholly passive in the recep- 
tion of all its simple ideas, so it exerts several acts of its own, 
whereby out of its simple ideas, as the materials and founda- 
tions of the rest, the other are framed. The acts of the mind 
* The other operations of the mind discussed by Locke under simple ideas 
are retention or memory, discerning, comparing, compounding, and abstraction. 
He then concludes in part as follows: chap. xi, § 15. These are the beginnings 
of human knowledge. — And thus I have given a short and, I think, true history 
of the first beginnings of human knowledge, whence the mind has its first objects, 
and by what steps it makes its progress to the laying in and storing up those 
ideas out of which is to be framed all the knowledge it is capable of; wherein 
I must appeal to experience and observation whether I am in the right: the best 
way to come to truth being to examine things as really they are, and not to con- 
clude they are as we fancy of ourselves, or have been taught by others to imagine.
-P-A-G-E-272
  250 JOHN LOCKE 
wherein it exerts its power over its simple ideas are chiefly these 
three: (1) Combining several simple ideas into one compound 
one; and thus all complex ideas are made. (2) The second is 
bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and 
setting them by one another, so as to take a view of them at 
once, without uniting them into one; by which way it gets all 
its ideas cf relations. (3) The third is separating them from all 
other ideas that accompany them in their real existence; this 
is called “abstraction’’: and thus all its general ideas are made. 
This shows man’s power and its way of operation to be much 
the same in the material and intellectual world. For, the 
materials in both being such as he has no power over, either to 
make or destroy, all that man can do is either to unite them 
together, or to set them by one another, or wholly separate 
them. I shall here begin with the first of these in the considera- 
tion of complex ideas, and come to the other two in their due 
places.]* As simple ideas are observed to exist in several com- 
binations united together, so the mind has a power to consider 
several of them united together as one idea; and that not only 
as they are united in external objects, but as itself has joined 
them. Ideas thus made up of several simple ones put together I 
call complex; such as are beauty, gratitude, a man, an army, 
the universe; which, though complicated of various simple ideas 
or complex ideas made up of simple ones, yet are, when the 
mind pleases, considered each by itself as one entire thing, and 
signified by one name. 
2. Made voluntarily. — In this faculty of repeating and join- 
ing together its ideas, the mind has great power in varying and 
multiplying the objects of its thoughts infinitely beyond what 
sensation or reflection furnished it with; but all this still con- 
fined to those simple ideas which it received from those two 
sources, and which are the ultimate materials of all its composi- 
tions. For, simple ideas are all from things themselves; and of 
these the mind can have no more nor other than what are sug- 
gested to it. It can have no other ideas of sensible qualities

-P-A-G-E-273

than what come from without by the senses, nor any ideas of 
other kind of operations of a thinking substance than what it 
finds in itself: but when it has once got these simple ideas, it is 
not confined barely to observation, and what offers itself from 
without; it can, by its own power, put together those ideas it has, 
and make new complex ones which it never received so united. 
3. Are either modes, substances, or relations. — Complex 
ideas, however compounded and decompounded, though their 
number be infinite, and the variety endless wherewith they fill 
and entertain the thoughts of men, yet I think they may be all 
reduced under these three heads: 1. Modes. 2. Substances. 
3. Relations. 
4. Modes. — First. Modes I call such complex ideas which, 
however compounded, contain not in them the supposition of, 
subsisting by themselves, but are considered as dependences on, 
or affections of, substances; such are the ideas signified by the 
words, “triangle, gratitude, murder,” &c. And if in this I use 
the word “‘mode”’ in somewhat a different sense from its ordin- 
ary signification, I beg pardon; it being unavoidable in dis- 
courses differing from the ordinary received notions, either to 
make new words or to use old words in somewhat a new signi- 
fication: the latter whereof, in our present case, is perhaps the 
more tolerable of the two. 
5. Simple and mixed modes. — Of these modes there are two 
sorts which deserve distinct consideration. First. There are 
some which are only variations or different combinations of the 
same simple idea, without the mixture of any other, as a dozen, 
or score; which are nothing but the ideas of so many distinct 
units added together: and these I call simple modes, as being 
contained within the bounds of one simple idea. Secondly. 
There are others compounded of simple ideas, of several kinds, 
put together to make one complex one, e.g., beauty, consisting 
of a certain composition of colour and figure, causing delight 
in the beholder; theft, which, being the concealed change of the 
possession of any thing, without the consent of the proprietor, 
contains, as is visible, a combination of several ideas of several 
kinds; and these I call mixed modes.
-P-A-G-E-274
  252 JOHN LOCKE 
6. Substances single or collective. — Secondly. The ideas of 
substances are such combinations of simple ideas as are taken 
to represent distinct particular things subsisting by themselves, 
in which the supposed or confused idea of substance, such as it 
is, is always the first and chief. Thus, if to substance be joined 
the simple idea of a certain dull, whitish colour, with certain 
degrees of weight, hardness, ductility, and fusibility, we have 
the idea of lead; and a combination of the ideas of a certain sort 
of figure, with the powers of motion, thought, and reasoning, 
joined to substance, make the ordinary idea of aman. Now of 
substances also there are two sorts of ideas:—one of single 
substances, as they exist separately, as of a man or a sheep; the 
other of several of those put together, as an army of men or 
flock of sheep — which collective ideas of several substances 
thus put together, are as much each of them one single idea as 
that of a man or an unit. 
7. Relation. — Thirdly. The last sort of complex ideas is 
that we call Relation, which consists in the consideration and 
comparing one idea with another. Of these several kinds we 
shall treat in their order. 
8. The abstrusest ideas from the two sources. —If we trace 
the progress of our minds, and with attention observe how it 
repeats, adds together, and unites its simple ideas received from 
sensation or reflection, it will lead us farther than at first per- 
haps we should have imagined. And I believe we shall find, if 
we warily observe the originals of our notions, that even the 
most abstruse ideas, how remote soever they may seem from 
sense, or from any operation of our own minds, are yet only 
such as the understanding frames to itself, by repeating and 
joining together ideas that it had either from objects of sense, 
or from its own operations about them; so that those even large 
and abstract ideas are derived from sensation or reflection, 
being no other than what the mind, by the ordinary use of its 
own faculties, employed about ideas received from objects of 
sense, or from the operations it observes in itself about them, 
may and does attain unto.

BOOK IV 
CHAPTER I. OF KNOWLEDGE IN GENERAL 
1. Our Knowledge conversant about our Ideas. — Since the 
mind, in all its thoughts and reasonings, hath no other imme- 
diate object but its own ideas, which it alone does or can con- 
template, it is evident that our knowledge is only conversant 
about them. 
2. Knowledge is the Perception of the Agreement or Disagree- 
ment of two Ideas. — Knowledge, then, seems to me to be 
nothing but the perception of the connexion and agreement, 
or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our ideas. In this 
alone it consists. Where this perception is, there is knowledge; 
and where it is not, there, though we may fancy, guess, or 
believe, yet we always come short of knowledge. For when we 
know that white is not black, what do we else but perceive 
that these two ideas do not agree? When we possess ourselves 
with the utmost security of the demonstration, that the three 
angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones, what do we 
more but perceive, that equality to two right ones does neces- 
sarily agree to, and is inseparable from the three angles of a 
triangle? 
3. This Agreement fourfold. — But to understand a little’ 
more distinctly wherein this agreement or disagreement con- 
sists, I think we may reduce it all to these four sorts: 
I. Identity, or diversity. 
II. Relation. 
III. Co-existence, or necessary connexion. 
IV. Real existence. 
4. First, Of Identity, or Diversity. — First, As to the first 
sort of agreement or disagreement, viz., identity or diversity. 
It is the first act of the mind, when it has any sentiments or 
ideas at all, to perceive its ideas; and so far as it perceives them, 
to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive their 
difference, and that one is not another. This is so absolutely 
necessary, that, without it, there could be no knowledge, no 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  254 JOHN LOCKE 
reasoning, no imagination, no distinct thoughts at all. By this 
the mind clearly and infallibly perceives each idea to agree 
with itself, and to be what it is; and all distinct ideas to disagree, 
i.e., the one not to be the other; and this it does without pains, 
labour, or deduction; but at first view, by its natural power of 
perception and distinction. And though men of art have 
reduced this into those general rules, “what is, is,” and ‘‘it is 
impossible for the same thing to be and not to be,” for ready 
application in all cases, wherein there may be occasion to 
reflect it on: yet it is certain, that the first exercise of this 
faculty is about particular ideas. A man infallibly knows, as 
soon as ever he has them in his mind, that the ideas he calls 
white and round are the very ideas they are, and that they are 
not other ideas which he calls red or square. Nor can any 
maxim or proposition in the world make him know it clearer or 
surer than he did before, and without any such general rule. 
This, then, is the first agreement or disagreement which the 
mind perceives in its ideas, which it always perceives at first 
sight: and if there ever happen any doubt about it, it will 
always be found to be about the names, and not the ideas 
themselves, whose identity and diversity will always be per- 
ceived as soon and clearly as the ideas themselves are; nor can 
it possibly be otherwise. 
5. Secondly, Relative. — Secondly, The next sort of agree- 
ment or disagreement the mind perceives in any of its ideas 
may, I think, be called relative, and is nothing but the per- 
ception of the relation between any two ideas, of what kind 
soever, whether substances, modes, or any other. For, since 
all distinct ideas must eternally be known not to be the same, 
and so be universally and constantly denied one of another, 
there could be no room for any positive knowledge at all, if 
we could not perceive any relation between our ideas, and 
find out the agreement or disagreement they have one with 
another, in several ways the mind takes of comparing them. 
6. Thirdly, Of Co-existence. — Thirdly, The third sort of 
agreement or disagreement to be found in our ideas, which 
the perception of the mind is employed about, is co-existence
-P-A-G-E-277
  CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING 255 
or non-co-existence in the same subject; and this belongs par- 
ticularly to substances. Thus, when we pronounce concerning 
gold, that it is fixed, our knowledge of this truth amounts to no 
more but this, that fixedness, or a power to remain in the fire 
unconsumed, is an idea that always accompanies and is joined 
with that particular sort of yellowness, weight, fusibility, malle- 
ableness, and solubility in aq. regia, which make our complex 
idea, signified by the word gold. 
4. Fourthly. Of real Existence. — Fourthly, The fourth and 
last sort is that of actual and real existence agreeing to any 
idea. Within these four sorts of agreement or disagreement 
is, I suppose, contained all the knowledge we have, or are 
capable of: for all the inquiries we can make concerning any 
of our ideas, all that we know or can affirm concerning any of 
them is, that it is, or is not, the same with some other; that it 
does or does not always co-exist with some other idea in the 
same subject; that it has this or that relation with some other 
idea; or that it has a real existence without the mind. Thus, 
blue is not yellow, is of identity: two triangles upon equal 
bases between two parallels are equal, is of relation: iron is 
susceptible of magnetical impressions, is of co-existence: God 
is, is of real existence. Though identity and co-existence are 
truly nothing but relations, yet they are such peculiar ways of 
agreement or disagreement of our ideas, that they deserve well 
to be considered as distinct heads, and not under relation in 
general; since they are so different grounds of affirmation and 
negation, as will easily appear to any one, who will but reflect 
on what is said in several places of this essay. . . .

GEORGE BERKELEY 
(1685-1753) 
AN ESSAY TOWARDS A NEW THEORY OF VISION * 
1. My design is (a) to shew the manner wherein we perceive 
by sight the Distance, Magnitude, and Situation of objects; 
also (b) to consider the difference there is betwixt the ideas of 
Sight and Touch, and whether there be any idea common to 
both senses. 
2. It is, I think, agreed by all that Distance of itself, and 
immediately, cannot be seen. For distance being a line directed 
endwise to the eye, it projects only one point in the fund of 
the eye — which point remains invariably the same, whether 
the distance be longer or shorter. 
3. I find it also acknowledged that the estimate we make 
of the distance of objects considerably remote is rather an act 
of judgment grounded on experience than of sense. For ex- 
ample, when I perceive a great number of intermediate objects, 
such as houses, fields, rivers, and the like, which I have experi- 
enced to take up a considerable space, I thence form a judg- 
ment or conclusion, that the object I see beyond them is at a 
great distance. Again, when an object appears faint and small 
which at a near distance I have experienced to make a vigorous 
and large appearance, I instantly conclude it to be far off. — 
And this, it is evident, is the result of experience; without 
which, from the faintness and littleness, I should not have 
inferred anything concerning the distance of objects. 
4. But, when an object is placed at so near a distance as 
that the interval between the eyes bears any sensible propor- 
tion to it, the opinion of speculative men is, that the two optic 
* Dublin, 1709; Lond., 1711; ib., 1732, etc.
-P-A-G-E-279
  A NEW THEORY OF VISION 257 
axes (the fancy that we see only with one eye at once being 
exploded), concurring at the object, do there make an angle, 
by means of which, according as it is greater or lesser, the 
object is perceived to be nearer or farther off. 
5. Betwixt which and the foregoing manner of estimating 
distance there is this remarkable difference: — that, whereas 
there was no apparent mecessary connexion between small 
distance and a large and strong appearance, or between great 
distance and a little and faint appearance, there appears a 
very necessary connexion between an obtuse angle and near 
distance, and an acute angle and farther distance. It does not 
in the least depend upon experience, .but may be evidently 
known by any one before he had experienced it, that the nearer 
the concurrence of the optic axes the greater the angle, and the 
remoter their concurrence is the lesser will be the angle com- 
prehended by them. 
6. There is another way, mentioned by optic writers, 
whereby they will have us judge of those distances in respect 
of which the breadth of the pupil hath any sensible bigness. 
And that is the greater or lesser divergency of the rays, which, 
issuing from the visible point, do fall on the pupil — that point 
being judged nearest which is seen by most diverging rays, 
and that remoter which is seen by less diverging rays; and so 
on, the apparent distance still increasing, as the divergency of 
the rays decreases, till at length it becomes infinite when the 
trays that fall on the pupil are to sense parallel. And after this 
manner it is said we perceive distance when we look only with 
one eye. 
7. In this case also it is plain we are not beholden to expe- 
rience: it being a certain, necessary truth that, the nearer the 
direct rays falling on the eye approach to a parallelism, the 
farther off is the point of their intersection, or the visible point 
from whence they flow. 
8. Now, though the accounts here given of perceiving near 
distance by sight are received for true, and accordingly made 
use of in determining the apparent places of objects, they do
-P-A-G-E-280
  258 GEORGE BERKELEY 
nevertheless seem to me very unsatisfactory, and that for these 
following reasons: — 
9. First, It is evident that, when the mind perceives any 
idea, not immediately and of itself, it must be by the means 
of some other idea. Thus, for instance, the passions which 
are in the mind of another are of themselves to me invisible. 
I may nevertheless perceive them by sight, though not imme- 
diately, yet by means of the colours they produce in the counte- 
nance. We often see shame or fear in the looks of a man, by 
perceiving the changes of his countenance to red or pale. 
1o. Moreover, it is evident that no idea which is not itself 
perceived can be to me the means of perceiving any other idea. 
If I do not perceive the redness or paleness of a man’s face 
themselves, it is impossible I should perceive by them the 
passions which are in his mind. 
11. Now, from sect. ii., it is plain that distance is in its own 
nature imperceptible, and yet it is perceived by sight. It 
remains, therefore, that it be brought into view by means of 
some other idea, that is itself immediately perceived in the act 
of vision. 
12. But those lines and angles by means whereof some 
men pretend to explain the perception of distance, are them- 
selves not at all perceived, nor are they in truth ever thought 
of by those unskilful in optics. I appeal to any one’s expe- 
rience, whether, upon sight of an object, he computes its dis- 
tance by the bigness of the angle made by the meeting of the 
two optic axes? or whether he ever thinks of the greater or 
lesser divergency of the rays which arrive from any point to 
his pupil? nay, whether it be not perfectly impossible for him 
to perceive by sense the various angles wherewith the rays, 
according to their greater or lesser divergence, do fall on the 
eye? Every one is himself the best judge of what he perceives, 
and what not. In vain shall any man tell me, that I perceive 
certain lines and angles which introduce into my mind the 
various ideas of distance, so long as I myself am conscious 
of no such thing. 
13. Since therefore those angles and lines are not themselves
-P-A-G-E-281
  A NEW THEORY OF VISION 259 
perceived by sight, it follows, from sect. x., that the mind does 
not by them judge of the distance of objects. 
14. Secondly, The truth of this assertion will be yet farther 
evident to any one that considers those lines and angles have 
no real existence in nature, being only an hypothesis framed 
by the mathematicians, and by them introduced into optics 
that they might treat of that science in a geometrical way. 
15. The third and last reason I shall give for rejecting that 
doctrine is, that though we should grant the real existence of 
those optic angles, &c., and that it was possible for the mind to 
perceive them, yet these principles would not be found suffi- 
cient to explain the phenomena of distance, as shall be shewn 
hereafter. 
16. Now, it being already shewn that distance is suggested 
to the mind, by the mediation of some other idea which is itself 
perceived in the act of seeing, it remains that we inquire what 
ideas or sensations there be that attend vision unto which we 
may suppose the ideas of distance are connected, and by which 
they are introduced into the mind. 
And, first, it is certain by experience, that when we look at a 
near object with both eyes, according as it approaches or 
recedes from us, we alter the disposition of our eyes, by lessen- 
ing or widening the interval between the pupils. This disposi- 
tion or turn of the eyes is attended with a sensation, which 
seems to me to be that which in this case brings the idea of 
greater or lesser distance into the mind. 
17. Not that there is any natural or necessary connexion 
between the sensation we perceive by the turn of the eyes 
and greater or lesser distance. But — because the mind has, 
by constant experience, found the different sensations corre- 
sponding to the different dispositions of the eyes to be attended 
each with a different degree of distance in the object — there 
has grown an habitual or customary connexion between those 
two sorts of ideas; so that the mind no sooner perceives the 
sensation arising from the different turn it gives the eyes, in 
order to bring the pupils nearer or farther asunder, but it
-P-A-G-E-282
    260 GEORGE BERKELEY 
withal perceives the different idea of distance which was wont 
to be connected with that sensation. Just as, upon hearing 
a certain sound, the idea is immediately suggested to the 
understanding which custom had united with it. 
18. Nor do I see how I can easily be mistaken in this matter. 
I know evidently that distance is not perceived of itself — that, 
by consequence, it must be perceived by means of some other 
idea, which is immediately perceived, and varies with the dif- 
ferent degrees of distance. I know also that the sensation 
arising from the turn of the eyes is of itself immediately per- 
ceived, and various degrees thereof are connected with differ- 
ent distances, which never fail to accompany them into my 
mind, when I view an object distinctly with both eyes whose 
distance is so small that in respect of it the interval between 
the eyes has any considerable magnitude. 
1g. I know it is.a received opinion that, by altering the 
disposition of the eyes, the mind perceives whether the angle 
of the optic axes, or the lateral angles comprehended between 
the interval of the eyes or the optic axes, are made greater 
or lesser; and that, accordingly, by a kind of natural geometry, 
it judges the point of their intersection to be nearer or farther 
off. But that this is not true I am convinced by my own experi- 
ence, since I am not conscious that I make any such use of the 
perception I have by the turn of my eyes. And for me to make 
those judgments, and draw those conclusions from it, without 
knowing that I do so, seems altogether incomprehensible. 
20. From all which it follows, that the judgment we make 
of the distance of an object viewed with both eyes is entirely 
the result of experience. If we had not constantly found cer- 
tain sensations, arising from the various dispositions of the 
eyes, attended with certain degrees of distance, we should never 
make those sudden judgments from them concerning the dis- 
tance of objects; no more than we would pretend to judge of a 
man’s thoughts by his pronouncing words we had never heard 
before. 
21. Secondly, an object placed at a certain distance from the 
eye, to which the breadth of the pupil bears a considerable
-P-A-G-E-283
    A NEW THEORY OF VISION 261 
proportion, being made to approach, is seen more confusedly. 
And the nearer it is brought the more confused appearance it 
makes. And, this being found constantly to be so, there arises 
in the mind an habitual connexion between the several degrees 
of confusion and distance; the greater confusion still imply- 
ing the lesser distance, and the lesser confusion the greater 
distance of the object. 
22. This confused appearance of the object doth therefore 
seem to be the medium whereby the mind judges of distance, 
in those cases wherein the most approved writers of optics 
will have it judge by the different divergency with which the 
rays flowing from the radiating point fall on the pupil. No 
man, I believe, will pretend to see or feel those imaginary angles 
that the rays are supposed to form according to their various 
inclinations on his eye. But he cannot choose seeing whether 
the object appear more or less confused. It is therefore a 
manifest consequence from what has been demonstrated that, 
instead of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays, the mind 
makes use of the greater or lesser confusedness of the appear- 
ance, thereby to determine the apparent place of an object. 
23. Nor doth it avail to say there is not any necessary con- 
nexion between confused vision and distance great or small. 
For I ask any man what necessary connexion he sees between 
the redness of a blush and shame? And yet no sooner shall he 
behold that colour to arise in the face of another but it brings 
into his mind the idea of that passion which hath been ob- 
served to accompany it. 
24. What seems to have misled the writers of optics in this 
matter is, that they imagine men judge of distance as they do 
of a conclusion in mathematics; betwixt which and the pre- 
mises it is indeed absolutely requisite there be an apparent, 
necessary connexion. But it is far otherwise in the sudden 
judgments men make of distance. We are not to think that 
brutes and children, or even grown reasonable men, whenever 
they perceive an object to approach or depart from them, do it 
by virtue of geometry and demonstration. 
25. That one idea may suggest another to the mind, it will
-P-A-G-E-284
262 GEORGE BERKELEY 
suffice that they have been observed to go together, without 
any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence, or 
without so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to 
coexist. Of this there are innumerable instances, of which no 
one can be ignorant. 
26. Thus, greater confusion having been constantly attended 
with nearer distance, no sooner is the former idea perceived but 
it suggests the latter to our thoughts. And, if it had been the 
ordinary course of nature that the farther off an object were 
placed the more confused it should appear, it is certain the very 
same perception that now makes us think an object approaches 
would then have made us to imagine it went farther off — that 
perception, abstracting from custom and experience, being 
equally fitted to produce the idea of great distance, or small 
distance, or no distance at all. 
27. Thirdly, an object being placed at the distance above 
specified, and brought nearer to the eye, we may nevertheless 
prevent, at least for some time, the appearance’s growing more 
confused, by straining the eye. In which case that sensation 
supplies the place of confused vision, in aiding the mind to 
judge of the distance of the object; it being esteemed so much 
the nearer by how much the effort or straining of the eye in 
order to distinct vision is greater. 
28. I have here set down those sensations of ideas that seem 
to be the constant and general occasions of introducing into the 
mind the different ideas of near distance. It is true, in most 
cases, that divers other circumstances contribute to frame our 
idea of distance, viz. the particular number, size, kind, &c. of 
the things seen. Concerning which, as well as all other the fore- 
mentioned occasions which suggest distance, I shall only 
observe, they have none of them, in their own nature, any rela- 
tion or connexion with it: nor is it possible they should ever 
signify the various degrees thereof, otherwise than as by expe- 
rience they have been found to be connected with them. 
41. From what has been premised, it is a manifest conse- 
quence, that a man born blind, being made to see, would at
-P-A-G-E-285
  A NEW THEORY OF VISION 263 
first have no idea of Distance by sight: the sun and stars, the 
remotest objects as well as the nearer, would all seem to be in 
his eye, or rather in his mind. The objects intromitted by sight 
would seem to him (as in truth they are) no other than a new 
set of thoughts or sensations, each whereof is as near to him 
as the perceptions of pain or pleasure, or the most inward 
passions of his soul. For, our judging objects perceived by 
sight to be at any distance, or without the mind, is (vid. sect. 
28) entirely the effect of experience, which one in those cir- 
cumstances could not yet have attained to. 
42. It is indeed otherwise upon the common supposition — 
that men judge of distance by the angle of the optic axes, just 
as one in the dark, or a blind man by the angle comprehended 
by two sticks, one whereof he held in his hand. For, if this 
were true, it would follow that one blind from his birth, being 
made to see, should stand in need of no new experience, in order 
to perceive distance by sight. But that this is false has, I think, 
been sufficiently demonstrated. 
43. And perhaps, upon a strict inquiry, we shall not find 
that even those who from their birth have grown up in a con- 
tinued habit of seeing are irrecoverably prejudiced on the other 
side, to wit, in thinking what they see to be at a distance from 
them. For, at this time it seems agreed on all hands, by those 
who have had any thoughts of that matter, that colours, which 
are the proper and immediate object of sight, are not without the 
mind. — But then, it will be said, by sight we have also the ideas 
of extension, and figure, and motion; all which may well be 
thought without and at some distance from the mind, though 
colour should not. In answer to this, I appeal to any man’s 
experience, whether the visible extension of any object do not 
appear as near to him as the colour of that object; nay, whether 
they do not both seem to be in the very same place. Is not the 
extension we see coloured, and is it possible for us, so much as 
in thought, to separate and abstract colour from extension? 
Now, where the extension is, there surely is the figure, and 
there the motion too. I speak of those which are perceived by 
sight.
-P-A-G-E-286
  264 GEORGE BERKELEY 
44. But, for a fuller explication of this point, and to shew 
that the immediate objects of sight are not so much as the 
ideas or resemblances of things placed at a distance, it is 
requisite that we look nearer into the matter, and carefully 
observe what is meant in common discourse when one says, 
that which he sees is at a distance from him. Suppose, for 
example, that looking at the moon I should say it were fifty 
or sixty semidiameters of the earth distant from me. Let us 
see what moon this is spoken of. It is plain it cannot be the 
visible moon, or anything like the visible moon, or that which 
I see — which is only a round luminous plain, of about thirty 
visible points in diameter. For, in case I am carried from the 
place where I stand directly towards the moon, it is manifest 
the object varies still as I go on; and, by the time that I am 
advanced fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth, I shall be so 
far from being near a small, round, luminous flat that I shall 
perceive nothing like it — this object having long since disap- 
peared, and, if I would recover it, it must be by going back to 
the earth from whence I set out. Again, suppose I perceive by 
sight the faint and obscure idea of something, which I doubt 
whether it be a man, or a tree, or a tower, but judge it to be at 
the distance of about a mile. It is plain I cannot mean that 
what I see is a mile off, or that it is the image or likeness of any- 
thing which is a mile off; since that every step I take towards 
it the appearance alters, and from being obscure, small, and 
faint, grows clear, large, and vigorous. And when I come to 
the mile’s end, that which I saw first is quite lost, neither do I 
find anything in the likeness of it. 
45. In these and the like instances, the truth of the matter, 
I find, stands thus: — Having of a long time experienced cer- 
tain ideas perceivable by touch — as distance, tangible figure, 
and solidity — to have been connected with certain ideas of 
sight, I do, upon perceiving these ideas of sight, forthwith con- 
clude what tangible ideas are, by the wonted ordinary course 
of nature, like to follow. Looking at an object, I perceive a 
certain visible figure and colour, with some degree of faintness 
and other circumstances, which, from what I have formerly
-P-A-G-E-287
  A NEW THEORY OF VISION 265 
observed, determine me to think that if I advance forward so 
many paces, miles, &c., I shall be affected with such and such 
ideas of touch. So that, in truth and strictness of speech, I 
neither see distance itself, nor anything that I take to be at a 
distance. I say, neither distance nor things placed at a distance 
are themselves, or their ideas, truly perceived by sight. This 
J am persuaded of, as to what concerns myself. And I believe 
whoever will look narrowly into his own thoughts, and examine 
what he means by saying he sees this or that thing at a dis- 
tance, will agree with me, that what he sees only suggests to his 
understanding that, after having passed a certain distance, to 
be measured by the motion of his body, which is perceivable by 
touch, he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas, 
which have been usually connected with such and such visible 
ideas. But, that one might be deceived by these suggestions 
of sense, and that there is no necessary connexion between 
visible and tangible ideas suggested by them, we need go no 
farther than the next looking-glass or picture to be convinced. 
— Note that, when I speak of tangible ideas, I take the word 
idea for any immediate object of sense or understanding — in 
which large signification it is commonly used by the moderns. 
46. From what we have shewn, it is a manifest consequence 
that the ideas of Space, Outness, and things placed at a dis- 
tance are not, strictly speaking, the object of sight; they are 
not otherwise perceived by the eye than by the ear. Sitting 
in my study I hear a coach drive along the street; I look 
through the casement and see it; I walk out and enter into it. 
Thus, common speech would incline one to think I heard, saw, 
and touched, the same thing, to wit, the coach. It is neverthe- 
less certain the ideas intromitted by each sense are widely 
different, and distinct from each other; but, having been ob- 
served constantly to go together, they are spoken of as one and 
the same thing. By the variation of the noise, I perceive the 
different distances of the coach, and know that it approaches 
before I look out. Thus, by the ear I perceive distance just 
after the same manner as I do by the eye. 
47. I do not nevertheless say I hear distance, in like manner 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  266 GEORGE BERKELEY 
as I say that I see it— the ideas perceived by hearing not 
being so apt to be confounded with the ideas of touch as those 
of sight are. So likewise a man is easily convinced that bodies 
and external things are not properly the object of hearing, but 
only sounds, by the mediation whereof the idea of this or that 
body, or distance, is suggested to his thoughts. But then one 
is with more difficulty brought to discern the difference there is 
betwixt the ideas of sight and touch: though it be certain, a 
man no more sees and feels the same thing, than he hears and 
feels the same thing. 
48. One reason of which seems to be this. It is thought a 
great absurdity to imagine that one and the same thing should 
have any more than one extension and one figure. But, the 
extension and figure of a body being let into the mind two ways, 
and that indifferently, either by sight or touch, it seems to fol- 
low that we see the same extension and the same figure which 
we feel. 
49. But, if we take a close and accurate view of the matter, 
it must be acknowledged that we never see and feel one and the 
same object. That which is seen is one thing, and that which is 
felt is another. If the visible figure and extension be not the 
same with the tangible figure and extension, we are not to infer 
that one and the same thing has divers extensions. The true 
consequence is that the objects of sight and touch are two dis- 
tinct things. It may perhaps require some thought rightly to 
conceive this distinction. And the difficulty seems not a little 
increased, because the combination of visible ideas hath con- 
stantly the same name as the combination of tangible ideas 
wherewith it is connected — which doth of necessity arise from 
the use and end of language. 
50. In order, therefore, to treat accurately and unconfusedly 
of vision, we must bear in mind that there are two sorts of 
objects apprehended by the eye —the one primarily and 
immediately, the other secondarily and by intervention of the 
former. Those of the first sort neither are nor appear to be 
without the mind, or at any distance off. They may, indeed, 
grow greater or smaller, more confused, or more clear, or more
-P-A-G-E-289
  A NEW THEORY OF VISION 267 
faint. But they do not, cannot approach or recede from us. 
Whenever we say an object is at a distance, whenever we say 
it draws near, or goes farther off, we must always mean it of 
the latter sort, which properly belong to the touch, and are not 
so truly perceived as suggested by the eye, in like manner as 
thoughts by the ear. 
51. No sooner do we hear the words of a familiar language 
pronounced in our ears but the ideas corresponding thereto 
present themselves to our minds: in the very same instant 
the sound and the meaning enter the understanding: so closely 
are they united that it is not in our power to keep out the one 
except we exclude the other also. We even act in all ‘respects 
as if we heard the very thoughts themselves. So likewise the 
secondary objects, or those which are only suggested by sight, 
do often more strongly affect us, and are more regarded, than 
the proper objects of that sense; along with which they enter 
into the mind, and with which they have a far more strict 
connexion than ideas have with words. Hence it is we find it 
so difficult to discriminate between the immediate and mediate 
objects of sight, and are so prone to attribute to the former 
what belongs only to the latter. They are, as it were, most 
closely twisted, blended, and incorporated together. And the 
prejudice is confirmed and riveted in our thoughts by a long 
tract of time, by the use of language, and want of reflection. 
However, I doubt not but any one that shall attentively con- 
sider what we have already said, and shall say upon this sub- 
ject before we have done (especially if he pursue it in his own 
thoughts), may be able to deliver himself from that prejudice. 
Sure Iam, it is worth some attention to whoever would under- 
stand the true nature of vision. 
52. I have now done with distance, and proceed to shew 
how it is that we perceive by sight the Magnitude of objects. 
It is the opinion of some that we do it by angles, or by angles 
in conjunction with distance. But, neither angles nor distance 
being perceivable by sight, and the things we see being in truth 
at no distance from us, it follows that, as we have shewn lines
-P-A-G-E-290
    268 GEORGE BERKELEY 
and angles not to be the medium the mind makes use of in 
apprehending the apparent place, so neither are they the 
medium whereby it apprehends the apparent magnitude of 
objects. 
53. It is well known that the same extension at a near dis- 
tance shall subtend a greater angle, and at a farther distance a 
lesser angle. And by this principle (we are told) the mind esti- 
mates the magnitude of an object, comparing the angle under 
which it is seen with its distance, and thence inferring the 
magnitude thereof. What inclines men to this mistake (beside 
the humour of making one see by geometry) is, that the same 
perceptions or ideas which suggest distance do also suggest 
magnitude. But, if we examine it, we shall find they suggest 
the latter as immediately as the former. I say, they do not first 
suggest distance and then leave it to the judgment to use that 
as a medium whereby to collect the magnitude; but they have 
as close and immediate a connexion with the magnitude as with 
the distance; and suggest magnitude as independently of dis- 
tance, as they do distance independently of magnitude. All 
which will be evident to whoever considers what has been 
already said and what follows. 
54. It has been shown there are two sorts of objects appre- 
hended by sight, each whereof has its distinct magnitude, or 
extension — the one, properly tangible, z.e. to be perceived and 
measured by touch, and not immediately falling under the 
sense of seeing; the other, properly and immediately visible, 
by mediation of which the former is brought in view. Each 
of these magnitudes are greater or lesser, according as they 
contain in them more or fewer points, they being made up of 
points or minimums. For, whatever may be said of extension 
in abstract, it is certain sensible extension is not infinitely divi- 
sible. There is a minimum tangibile, and a minimum visibile, 
beyond which sense cannot perceive. This every one’s experi- 
ence will inform him. 
55. The magnitude of the object which exists without the 
mind, and is at a distance, continues always invariably the 
same: but, the visible object still changing as you approach
-P-A-G-E-291
  
A NEW THEORY OF VISION 269 
to or recede from the tangible object, it hath no fixed and deter- 
minate greatness. Whenever therefore we speak of the magni- 
tude of any thing, for instance a tree or a house, we must mean 
the tangible magnitude; otherwise there can be nothing steady 
and free from ambiguity spoken of it. Now, though the tangi- 
ble and visible magnitude do in truth belong to two distinct 
objects, I shall nevertheless (especially since those objects are 
called by the same name, and are observed to coexist), to avoid 
tediousness and singularity of speech, sometimes speak of them 
as belonging to one and the same thing. 
56. Now, in order to discover by what means the magni- 
tude of tangible objects is perceived by sight, I need only reflect 
on what passes in my own mind, and observe what those things 
be which introduce the ideas of greater or lesser into my 
thoughts when I look on any object. And these I find to be, 
first, the magnitude or extension of the visible object, which, 
being immediately perceived by sight, is connected with that 
other which is tangible and placed at a distance: secondly, the 
confusion or distinctness: and thirdly, the vigorousness or faint- 
ness of the aforesaid visible appearance. Ceteris paribus, by 
how much the greater or lesser the visible object is, by so much 
the greater or lesser do I conclude the tangible object to be. 
But, be the idea immediately perceived by sight never so large, 
yet, if it be withal confused, I judge the magnitude of the thing 
to be but small. If it be distinct and clear, I judge it greater. 
And, if it be faint, I apprehend it to be yet greater... . 
57. Moreover, the judgments we make of greatness do, in 
like manner as those of distance, depend on the disposition of 
the eye; also on the figure, number, and situation of inter- 
mediate objects, and other circumstances that have been ob- 
served to attend great or small tangible magnitudes. Thus, 
for instance, the very same quantity of visible extension which 
in the figure of a tower doth suggest the idea of great magni- 
tude shall in the figure of a man suggest the idea of much smaller 
magnitude. That this is owing to the experience we have had 
of the usual bigness of a tower and a man, no one, I suppose, 
need be told.
-P-A-G-E-292
  270 GEORGE BERKELEY 
58. It is also evident that confusion or faintness have no 
more a necessary connexion with little or great magnitude 
than they have with little or great distance. As they suggest 
the latter, so they suggest the former to our minds. And, by 
consequence, if it were not for experience, we should no more 
judge a faint or confused appearance to be connected with 
great or little magnitude than we should that it was connected 
with great or little distance. 
63. Moreover, it is not only certain that any idea of sight 
might not have been connected with this or that idea of touch 
we now observe to accompany it, but also that the greater 
visible magnitudes might have been connected with and 
introduced into our minds lesser tangible magnitudes, and 
the lesser visible magnitudes greater tangible magnitudes. 
Nay, that it actually is so, we have daily experience — that 
object which makes a strong and large appearance not seem- 
ing near so great as another the visible magnitude whereof is 
much less, but more faint, and the appearance upper, or which 
is the same thing, painted lower on the retina, which faintness 
and situation suggest both greater magnitude and greater 
distance. 
64. From which, and from sect. 57 and 58, it is manifest 
that, as we do not perceive the magnitude of objects immedi- 
ately by sight, so neither do we perceive them by the media- 
tion of anything which has a necessary connexion with them. 
Those ideas that now suggest unto us the various magnitudes 
of external objects before we touch them might possibly have 
suggested no such thing; or they might have signified them 
in a direct contrary manner, so that the very same ideas on 
the perception whereof we judge an object to be small might 
as well have served to make us conclude it great; — those 
ideas being in their own nature equally fitted to bring into 
our minds the idea of small or great, or no size at all, of outward 
objects, just as the words of any language are in their own 
nature indifferent to signify this or that thing, or nothing at all. 
65. As we see distance so we see magnitude. And we see 
both in the same way that we see shame or anger in the looks
-P-A-G-E-293
  A NEW THEORY OF VISION 271 
of a man. Those passions are themselves invisible; they are 
nevertheless let in by the eye along with colours and altera- 
tions of countenance which are the immediate object of vision, 
and which signify them for no other reason than barely because 
they have been observed to accompany them. Without which 
experience we should no more have taken blushing for a sign 
of shame than of gladness. 
66. We are nevertheless exceedingly prone to imagine those 
things which are perceived only by the mediation of others to 
be themselves the immediate objects of sight, or at least to 
have in their own nature a fitness to be suggested by them 
before ever they had been experienced to coexist with them. 
From which prejudice every one perhaps will not find it easy 
to emancipate himself, by any the clearest convictions of 
reason. And there are some grounds to think that, if there 
was one only invariable and universal language in the world, 
and that men were born with the faculty of speaking it, it 
would be the opinion of some, that the ideas in other men’s 
minds were properly perceived by the ear, or had at least a 
necessary and inseparable tie with the sounds which were 
affixed to them. All which seems to arise from want of a due 
application of our discerning faculty, thereby to discriminate 
between the ideas that are in our understandings, and consider 
them apart from each other; which would preserve us from 
confounding those that are different, and make us see what 
ideas do, and what do not, include or imply this or that other 
idea. 
77. [' For the further clearing up of this point, it is to be 
observed, that what we immediately and properly see are only 
lights and colours in sundry situations and shades, and degrees 
of faintness and clearness, confusion and distinctness. All 
which visible objects are only in the mind; nor do they suggest 
aught external, whether distance or magnitude, otherwise than 
by habitual connexion, as words do things. We are also to 
remark, that beside the straining of the eyes, and beside the 
1 What follows in this section is not in the first edition.
-P-A-G-E-294
272 GEORGE BERKELEY | 
vivid and faint, the instinct and confused appearances (which, 
bearing some proportion to lines and angles, have been sub- 
stituted instead of them in the foregoing part of this Treatise), 
there are other means which suggest both distance and magni- 
tude — particularly the situation of visible points or objects, 
as upper or lower; the former suggesting a farther distance and 
greater magnitude, the latter a nearer distance and lesser mag- 
nitude — all which is an effect only of custom and experience, 
there being really nothing intermediate in the line of distance 
between the uppermost and the lowermost, which are both 
equidistant, or rather at no distance from the eye; as there is 
also nothing in upper or lower which by necessary connexion 
should suggest greater or lesser magnitude. Now, as these cus- 
tomary experimental means of suggesting distance do likewise 
suggest magnitude, so they suggest the one as immediately as 
the other. I say, they do not (Vid. sect. 53) first suggest dis- 
tance, and then leave the mind from thence to infer or compute 
magnitude, but suggest magnitude as immediately and directly 
as they suggest distance.] 
78. This phenomenon of the horizontal moon is a clear 
instance of the insufficiency of lines and angles for explaining 
the way wherein the mind perceives and estimates the magni- 
tude of outward objects. There is, nevertheless, a use of com- 
putation by them — in order to determine the apparent mag- 
nitude of things, so far as they have a connexion with and are 
proportional to those other ideas or perceptions which are the 
true and immediate occasions that suggest to the mind the 
apparent magnitude of things. But this in general may, I 
think, be observed concerning mathematical computation in 
optics — that it can never be very precise and exact, since the 
judgments we make of the magnitude of external things do 
often depend on several circumstances which are not propor- 
tional to or capable of being defined by lines and angles. 
79. From what has been said, we may safely deduce this 
consequence, to wit, that a man born blind, and made to see, 
would, at first opening of his eyes, make a very different judg- 
ment of the magnitude of objects intromitted by them from 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
A NEW THEORY OF VISION 273 
what others do. He would not consider the ideas of sight with 
reference to, or as having any connexion with the idea of touch. 
His view of them being entirely terminated within themselves, 
he can no otherwise judge them great or small than as they 
contain a greater or lesser number of visible points. Now, it 
being certain that any visible point can cover or exclude from 
view only one other visible point, it follows that whatever 
object intercepts the view of another hath an equal number 
of visible points with it; and, consequently, they shall both 
be thought by him to have the same magnitude. Hence, it is 
evident one in those circumstances would judge his thumb, 
with which he might hide a tower, or hinder its being seen, equal 
to that tower; or his hand, the interposition whereof might con- 
ceal the firmament from his view, equal to the firmament: how 
great an inequality soever there may, in our apprehensions, 
seem to be betwixt those two things, because of the customary 
and close connexion that has grown up in our minds between 
the objects of sight and touch, whereby the very different and 
distinct ideas of those two senses are so blended and con- 
founded together as to be mistaken for one and the same thing 
— out of which prejudice we cannot easily extricate ourselves. 
127. It having been shewn that there are no abstract ideas 
of figure, and that it is impossible for us, by any precision of 
thought, to frame an idea of extension separate from all other 
visible and tangible qualities, which shall be common both to 
sight and touch — the question now remaining is, Whether 
the particular extensions, figures, and motions perceived by 
sight, be of the same kind with the particular extensions, figures, 
and motions perceived by touch? In answer to which I shall 
venture to lay down the following proposition: — The exten- 
sion, figures, and motions perceived by sight are specifically dis- 
tinct from the ideas of touch, called by the same names; nor is there 
any such thing as one idea, or kind of idea, common to both 
senses. This proposition may, without much difficulty, be col- 
lected from what hath been said in several places of this Essay. 
But, because it seems so remote from, and contrary to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  274 GEORGE BERKELEY 
received notions and settled opinion of mankind, I shall at- 
tempt to demonstrate it more particularly and at large by the 
following arguments: — 
128. First, When, upon perception of an idea, I range it 
under this or that sort, it is because it is perceived after the 
same manner, or because it has likeness or conformity with, 
or affects me in the same way as the ideas of the sort I rank 
it under. In short, it must not be entirely new, but have some- 
thing in it old and already perceived by me. It must, I say, 
have so much, at least, in common with the ideas I have before 
known and named, as to make me give it the same name with 
them. But, it has been, if I mistake not, clearly made out that 
a man born blind would not, at first reception of his sight, think 
the things he saw were of the same nature with the objects of 
touch, or had anything in common with them; but that they 
were a new set of ideas, perceived in a new manner, and en- 
tirely different from all he had ever perceived before. So that 
he would not call them by the same name, nor repute them 
to be of the same sort, with anything he had hitherto known. 
129. Secondly, Light and colours are allowed by all to con- 
stitute a sort or species entirely different from the ideas of 
touch; nor will any man, I presume, say they can make them- 
selves perceived by that sense. But there is no other immediate 
object of sight besides light and colours. It is therefore a direct 
consequence, that there is no idea common to both senses. 
130. It is a prevailing opinion, even amongst those who 
have thought and writ most accurately concerning our ideas, 
and the ways whereby they enter into the understanding, that. © 
something more is perceived by sight than barely light and 
colours with their variations. Mr. Locke termeth sight ‘the 
most comprehensive of all our senses, conveying to our minds 
the ideas of light and colours, which are peculiar only to that 
sense; and also the far different ideas of space, figure, and 
motion.’ (Essay on Human Understanding, b. II. ch. 9. s. 9.) 
Space or distance, we have shewn, is no otherwise the object 
of sight than of hearing. (Vid. sect. 46.) And, as for figure 
and extension, I leave it to any one that shall calmly attend
-P-A-G-E-297
  A NEW THEORY OF VISION 275 
to his own clear and distinct ideas to decide whether he had 
any idea intromitted immediately and properly by sight save 
only light and colours: or, whether it be possible for him to 
frame in his mind a distinct abstract idea of visible extension, or 
figure, exclusive of all colour; and, on the other hand, whether 
he can conceive colour without visible extension? For my 
own part, I must confess, Iam not able to attain so great a 
nicety of abstraction. I know very well that, in a strict sense, 
I see nothing but light and colours, with their several shades 
and variations. He who beside these doth also perceive by 
sight ideas far different and distinct from them, hath that 
faculty in a degree more perfect and comprehensive than I can 
pretend to. It must be owned, indeed, that, by the mediation 
of light and colours, other far different ideas are suggested to my 
mind. But then, upon this score, I see no reason why sight 
should be thought more ‘comprehensive’ than the hearing, 
which, beside sounds which are peculiar to that sense, doth, by 
their mediation, suggest not only space, figure, and motion, but 
also all other ideas whatsoever that can be signified by words. 
131. Thirdly, It is, I think, an axiom universally received, 
that ‘quantities of the same kind may be added together and 
make one entire sum.’ Mathematicians add lines together; but 
they do not add a line to a solid, or conceive it as making one 
sum with a surface. These three kinds of quantity being 
thought incapable of any such mutual addition, and conse- 
quently of being compared together in the several ways of 
proportion, are by them for that reason esteemed entirely 
disparate and heterogeneous. Now let any one try in his 
thoughts to add a visible line or surface to a tangible line or 
surface, so as to conceive them making one continued sum or 
whole. He that can do this may think them homogeneous; 
but he that cannot must, by the foregoing axiom, think them 
heterogeneous. A blue and a red line I can conceive added 
together into one sum and making one continued line; but, 
to make, in my thoughts, one continued line of a visible and 
tangible line added together, is, I find, a task far more diffi- 
cult, and even insurmountable — and I leave it to the reflec-  
-P-A-G-E-298
  276 GEORGE BERKELEY 
tion and experience of every particular person to determine for 
himself. 
132. A farther confirmation of our tenet may be drawn 
from the solution of Mr. Molyneux’s problem, published by 
Mr. Locke in his Essay: which I shall set down as it there lies, 
together with Mr. Locke’s opinion of it: — ‘Suppose a man 
born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distin- 
guish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and 
nighly of the same b’gness, so as to tell when he felt one and 
the other, which is the cube, and which the sphere. Suppose 
then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man 
made to see: Quere, Whether by his sight, before he touched 
them, he could now distinguish, and tell, which is the globe, 
which the cube. To which the acute and judicious proposer 
answers: Not. For, though he has obtained the experience of 
how a globe, how a cube affects his touch; yet he has not yet 
attained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so 
must affect his sight so or so: or that a protuberant angle in the 
cube, that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye 
as it doth in the cube. I agree with this thinking gentleman, 
whom I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this his 
problem; and am of opinion that the blind man, at first sight, 
would not be able with certainty to say, which was the globe, 
which the cube, whilst he only saw them.’ (Locke’s Essay on 
Human Understanding, b. II. ch. 9. s. 8.7) 
133. Now, if a square surface perceived by touch be of the 
same sort with a square surface perceived by sight, it is certain 
the blind man here mentioned might know a square surface 
as soon as he saw it. It is no more but introducing into his 
mind, by a new inlet, an idea he has been already well ac- 
quainted with. Since therefore he is supposed to have known 
by his touch that a cube is a body terminated by square sur- 
faces; and that a sphere is not terminated by square surfaces 
— upon the supposition that a visible and tangible square differ 
only in numero, it follows that he might know, by the unerring 
1 See Leibnitz (Nouveaux Essais, liv. Il. ch. 9), who disputes the alleged 
heterogeneity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  A NEW THEORY OF VISION 277 
mark of the square surfaces, which was the cube, and which not, 
while he only saw them. We must therefore allow, either that 
visible extension and figures are specifically distinct from tangi- 
ble extension and figures, or else, that the solution of this prob- 
lem, given by those two thoughtful and ingenious men, is 
wrong. 
134. Much more might be laid together in proof of the pro- 
position I have advanced. But, what has been said is, if I mis- 
take not, sufficient to convince any one that shall yield a 
reasonable attention. And, as for those that will not be at the 
pains of a little thought, no multiplication of words will ever 
suffice to make them understand the truth, or rightly conceive 
my meaning. 
135. I cannot let go the above-mentioned problem without 
some reflection on it. It hath been made evident that a man 
blind from his birth would not, at first sight, denominate any- 
thing he saw, by the names he had been used to appropriate 
to ideas of touch. (Vid. sect. 106.) Cube, sphere, table are 
words he has known applied to things perceivable by touch, 
but to things perfectly intangible he never knew them applied. 
Those words, in their wonted application, always marked out 
to his mind bodies or solid things which were perceived by the 
resistance they gave. But there is no solidity, no resistance or 
protrusion, perceived by sight. In short, the ideas of sight are 
all new perceptions, to which there be no names annexed in his 
mind; he cannot therefore understand what is said to him con- 
cerning them. And, to ask of the two bodies he saw placed on 
the table, which was the sphere, which the cube, were to him a 
question downright bantering and unintelligible; nothing he 
sees being able to suggest to his thoughts the idea of body, dis- 
tance, or, in general, of anything he had already known. 
136. It is a mistake to think the same thing affects both 
sight and touch. If the same angle or square which is the 
object of touch be also the object of vision, what should hinder 
the blind man, at first sight, from knowing it? For, though 
the manner wherein it affects the sight be different from that 
wherein it affected his touch, yet, there being, beside this man-
-P-A-G-E-300
  278 GEORGE BERKELEY 
ner of circumstance, which is new and unknown, the angle or 
figure, which is old and known, he cannot choose but discern it. 
147. Upon the whole, I think we may fairly conclude that 
the proper objects of vision constitute the Universal Language 
of Nature, whereby we are instructed how to regulate our 
actions, in order to attain those things that are necessary to 
the preservation and well-being of our bodies, as also to avoid 
whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them. It is by their 
information that we are principally guided in all the transac- 
tions and concerns of life. And the manner wherein they sig- 
nify and mark out unto us the objects which are at a distance 
is the same with that of languages and signs of human appoint- 
ment; which do not suggest the things signified by any likeness 
or identity of nature, but only by an habitual connexion that 
experience has made us to observe between them. 
148. Suppose one who had always continued blind be told 
by his guide that after he has advanced so many steps he 
shall come to the brink of a precipice, or be stopped by a wall; 
must not this to him seem very admirable and surprising? 
He cannot conceive how it is possible for mortals to frame such 
predictions as these, which to him would seem as strange and 
unaccountable as prophecy does to others. Even they who 
are blessed with the visive faculty may (though familiarity 
make it less observed) find therein sufficient cause of admira- 
tion. The wonderful art and contrivance wherewith it is ad- 
justed to those ends and purposes for which it was apparently 
designed; the vast extent, number, and variety of objects that 
are at once, with so much ease, and quickness, and pleasure, 
suggested by it — all these afford subject for much and pleasing 
speculation, and may, if anything, give us some glimmering 
analogous prenotion of things, that are placed beyond the 
certain discovery and comprehension of our present state.

Section J. OF THE ORIGIN oF oUR IDEAS 
ALL the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves 
into two distinct kinds, which I shall call Impressrons and 
Ipgas. The difference betwixt these consists in the degrees 
of force and liveliness with which they strike upon the mind, 
and make their way into our thought or consciousness. Those 
perceptions, which enter with most force and violence, we may 
name impressions; and under this name I comprehend all our © 
sensations, passions and emotions, as they make their first 
appearance in the soul. By ideas I mean the faint images of 
these in thinking and reasoning; such as, for instance, are all 
the perceptions excited by the present discourse, excepting only 
those which arise from the sight and touch, and excepting the 
immediate pleasure or uneasiness it may occasion. I believe it 
will not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining 
this distinction. Every one of himself will readily perceive the 
difference betwixt feeling and thinking. The common degrees 
of these are easily distinguished; tho’ it is not impossible but 
in particular instances they may very nearly approach to each 
other. Thus in sleep, in a fever, in madness, or in any very

280 DAVID HUME 
violent emotions of soul, our ideas may approach to our im- 
pressions: As on the other hand it sometimes happens, that our 
impressions are so faint and low, that we cannot distinguish 
them from our ideas. But notwithstanding this near resem- 
blance in a few instances, they are in general so very different, 
that no-one can make a scruple to rank them under distinct 
heads, and assign to each a peculiar name to mark the differ- 
ence.* 
There is another division of our perceptions, which it will 
be convenient to observe, and which extends itself both to our 
impressions and ideas. This division is into SimpLe and Com- 
PLEX. Simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as 
admit of no distinction or separation. The complex are the 
contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts. Tho’ 
a particular colour, taste, and smell are qualities all united 
together in this apple, ’t is easy to perceive they are not the 
same, but are at least distinguishable from each other. 
Having by these divisions given an order and arrangement 
to our objects, we may now apply ourselves to consider with 
the more accuracy their qualities and relations. The first cir- 
cumstance, that strikes my eye, is the great resemblance 
betwixt our impressions and ideas in every other particular, 
except their degree of force and vivacity. The one seem to be 
in a manner the reflexion of the other; so that all the percep- 
tions of the mind are double, and appear both as impressions 
and ideas. When I shut my eyes and think of my chamber, the 
ideas I form are exact representations of the impressions I felt; 
nor is there any circumstance of the one, which is not to be found 
in the other. In running over my other perceptions, I find still 
the same resemblance and representation. Ideas and impres- 
sions appear always to correspond to each other. This circum- 
1 T here make use of these terms, impression and idea, in a sense different from 
what is usual, and I hope this liberty will be allowed me. Perhaps I rather restore 
the word, idea, to its original sense, from which Mr. Locke had perverted it, in 
making it stand for all our perceptions. By the term of impression I would not be 
understood to express the manner, in which our lively perceptions are produced 
in the soul, but merely the perceptions themselves; for which there is no particu- 
lar name either in the English or any other language, that I know of.
-P-A-G-E-303
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 281 
stance seems to me remarkable, and engages my attention for 
a moment. 
Upon a moreaccurate survey I find I have been carried away 
too far by the first appearance, and that I must make use of the 
distinction of perceptions into simple and complex, to limit this 
general decision, that all our ideas and impressions are resem- 
bling. I observe, that many of our complex ideas never had 
impressions, that corresponded to them, and that many of our 
complex impressions never are exactly copied in ideas. I can 
imagine to myself such a city as the New Jerusalem, whose 
pavement is gold and walls are rubies, tho’ I never saw any 
such. I have seen Paris; but shall I affirm I can form such an 
idea of that city, as will perfectly represent all its streets and 
houses in their real and just proportions? 
I perceive, therefore, that tho’ there is in general a great 
resemblance betwixt our complex impressions and ideas, yet 
the rule is not universally true, that they are exact copies of 
each other. We may next consider how the case stands with 
our simple perceptions. After the most accurate examination, 
of which I am capable, I venture to affirm, that the rule here 
holds without any exception, and that every simple idea has a 
simple impression, which resembles it; and every simple impres- 
sion a correspondent idea. That idea of red, which we form in 
the dark, and that impression, which strikes our eyes in sun- 
shine, differ only in degree, not in nature. That the case is the 
same with all our simple impressions and ideas, ’t is impossible 
to prove by a particular enumeration of them. Every one may 
satisfy himself in this point by running over as many as he 
pleases. But if any one should deny this universal resemblance, 
I know no way of convincing him, but by desiring him to shew 
a simple impression, that has not a correspondent idea, or a 
simple idea, that has not a correspondent impression. If he 
does not answer this challenge, as ’t is certain he cannot, we 
may from his silence and our own observation establish our 
conclusion. 
Thus we find, that all simple ideas and impressions resem- 
ble each other; and as the complex are formed from them, we 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  282 DAVID HUME 
may affirm in general, that these two species of perception are 
exactly correspondent. Having discover’d this relation, which 
requires no farther examination, I am curious to find some 
other of their qualities. Let us consider how they stand with 
regard to their existence, and which of the impressions and 
ideas are causes, and which effects. 
The full examination of this question is the subject of the 
present treatise; and therefore we shall here content ourselves 
with establishing one general proposition, That all our simple 
ideas in their first appearance are deriv’d from simple impressions, 
which are correspondent to them, and which they exactly represent. 
In seeking for phenomena to prove this proposition, I find 
only those of two kinds; but in each kind the phenomena are 
obvious, numerous, and conclusive. I first make myself cer- 
tain, by a new review, of what I have already asserted, that 
every simple impression is attended with a correspondent idea, 
and every simple idea with a correspondent impression. From 
this constant conjunction of resembling perceptions I immedi- 
ately conclude, that there is a great connexion betwixt our cor- 
respondent impressions and ideas, and that the existence of the 
one has a considerable influence upon that of the other. Such a 
constant conjunction, in such an infinite number of instances, 
can never arise from chance; but clearly proves a dependence 
of the impressions on the ideas, or of the ideas on the impres- 
sions. That I may know on which side this dependence lies, 
I consider the order of their first appearance; and find by con- 
stant experience, that the simple impressions always take the 
precedence of their correspondent ideas, but never appear in 
the contrary order. To give a child an idea of scarlet or orange, 
of sweet or bitter, I present the objects, or in other words, con- 
vey to him these impressions; but proceed not so absurdly, as 
to endeavour to produce the impressions by exciting the ideas. 
Our ideas upon their appearance produce not their correspond- 
ent impressions, nor do we perceive any colour, or feel any sen- 
sation merely upon thinking of them. On the other hand we find 
that any impression either of the mind or body is constantly 
followed by an idea, which resembles it, and is only different
-P-A-G-E-305
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 283 
in the degrees of force and liveliness. The constant conjunction 
of our resembling perceptions, is a convincing proof, that the 
one are the causes of the other; and this priority of the impres- 
sions is an equal proof, that our impressions are the causes of 
our ideas, not our ideas of our impressions. 
To confirm this I consider another plain and convincing 
phenomenon; which is, that where-ever by any accident the 
faculties, which give rise to any impressions, are obstructed 
in their operations, as when one is born blind or deaf; not only 
the impressions are lost, but also their correspondent ideas; 
so that there never appear in the mind the least traces of either 
of them. Nor is this only true, where the organs of sensation are 
entirely destroy’d, but likewise where they have never been put 
in action to produce a particular impression. We cannot form 
to ourselves a just idea of the taste of a pine-apple, without 
having actually tasted it. 
There is however one contradictory phenomenon, which 
may prove, that ’t is not absolutely impossible for ideas to go 
before their correspondent impressions. I believe it will readily 
be allow’d, that the several distinct ideas of colours, which 
enter by the eyes, or those of sounds, which are convey’d by 
the hearing, are really different from each other, tho’ at the 
same time resembling. Now if this be true of different colours, 
it must be no less so of the different shades of the same colour, 
that each of them produces a distinct idea, independent of the 
rest. For if this shou’d be deny’d, ’t is possible, by the con- 
tinual gradation of shades, to run a colour insensibly into what 
is most remote from it; and if you will not allow any of the 
means to be different, you cannot without absurdity deny the 
extremes to be the same. Suppose therefore a person to have 
enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to have become per- 
fectly well acquainted with colours of all kinds, excepting one 
particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been 
his fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of that 
colour, except that single one, be plac’d before him, descending 
gradually from the deepest to the lightest; ’t is plain, that he 
will perceive a blank, where that shade is wanting, and will be  
-P-A-G-E-306
  284 DAVID HUME 
sensible, that there is a greater distance in that place betwixt 
the contiguous colours, than in any other. Now I ask, whether 
’t is possible for him, from his own imagination, to supply this 
deficiency, and raise up to himself the idea of that particular 
shade, tho’ it had never been conveyed to him by his senses? 
I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can; and 
this may serve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always 
derived from the correspondent impressions; tho’ the instance 
is so particular and singular, that ’t is scarce worth our observ- 
ing, and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our 
general maxim. 
But besides this exception, it may not be amiss to remark 
on this head, that the principle of the priority of impressions 
to ideas must be understood with another limitation, viz. that 
as our ideas are images of our impressions, so we can form 
secondary ideas, which are images of the primary; as appears 
from this very reasoning concerning them. This is not, pro- 
perly speaking, an exception to the rule so much as an explana- 
tion of it. Ideas produce the images of themselves in new ideas; 
but as the first ideas are supposed to be derived from impres- 
sions, it still remains true, that all our simple ideas proceed 
either mediately or immediately from their correspondent 
impressions. 
This then is the first principle I establish in the science of 
human nature; nor ought we to despise it because of the sim- 
plicity of its appearance. For ’t is remarkable, that the present 
question concerning the precedency of our impressions or ideas, 
is the same with what has made so much noise in other terms, 
when it has been disputed whether there be any innate ideas, 
or whether all ideas be derived from sensation and reflexion. 
We may observe, that in order to prove the ideas of extension 
and colour not to be innate, philosophers do nothing but 
shew, that they are conveyed by our senses. To prove the 
ideas of passion and desire not to be innate, they observe that 
we have a preceding experience of these emotions in ourselves. 
Now if we carefully examine these arguments, we shall find that 
they prove nothing but that ideas are preceded by other more
-P-A-G-E-307
A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 285 
lively perceptions, from which they are derived, and which they 
represent. I hope this clear stating of the question will remove 
all disputes concerning it, and will render this principle of more 
use in our reasonings, than it seems hitherto to have been. 
Section II. Division oF THE SUBJECT 
SINCE it appears, that our simple impressions are prior to 
their correspondent ideas, and that the exceptions are very 
rare, method seems to require we should examine our impres- 
sions, before we consider our ideas. Impressions may be di- 
vided into two kinds, those of SENSATION and those of REFLEX- 
10N. The first kind arises in the soul originally, from unknown 
causes. The second is derived in a great measure from our 
ideas, and that in the following order. An impression first 
strikes upon the senses, and makes us perceive heat or cold, 
thirst or hunger, pleasure or pain of some kind or other. Of 
this impression there is a copy taken by the mind, which re- 
mains after the impression ceases; and this we call an idea. 
This idea of pleasure or pain, when it returns upon the soul, 
produces the new impressions of desire and aversion, hope and 
fear, which may properly be called impressions of reflection, 
because derived from it. These again are copied by the memory 
and imagination, and become ideas; which perhaps in their turn 
give rise to other impressions and ideas. So that the impres- 
sions of reflection are only antecedent to their correspondent 
ideas; but posterior to those of sensation, and deriv’d from 
them. The examination of our sensations belongs more to 
anatomists and natural philosophers than to moral; and there- 
fore shall not at present be enter’d upon. And as the impres- 
sions of reflection, viz. passions, desires, and emotions, which 
principally deserve our attention, arise mostly from ideas, ’t will 
be necessary to reverse that method, which at first sight seems 
most natural; and in order to explain the nature and principles 
of the human mind, give a particular account of ideas, before 
we proceed to impressions. For this reason I have. bere chosen 
to begin with ideas. 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  
  286 DAVID HUME 
Section III. Or tHe Ipeas or THE MEMoRY AND IMAGINA- 
TION 
WE find by experience, that when any impression has been 
present with the mind, it again makes its appearance there as 
an idea; and this it may do after two different ways; either 
when in its new appearance it retains a considerable degree 
of its first vivacity, and is somewhat intermediate betwixt an 
impression and an idea; or when it entirely loses that vivacity, 
and is a perfect idea. The faculty, by which we repeat our 
impressions in the first manner, is called the Memory, and the 
other the ImacinatTion. ’T is evident at first sight, that the 
ideas of the memory are much more lively and strong than 
those of the imagination, and that the former faculty paints its 
objects in more distinct colours, than any which are employ’d 
by the latter. When we remember any past event, the idea 
of it flows in upon the mind in a forcible manner; whereas in 
the imagination the perception is faint and languid, and cannot 
without difficulty be preserv’d by the mind steady and uni- 
form for any considerable time. Here then is a sensible differ- 
ence betwixt one species of ideas and another. But of this more 
fully hereafter.* 
There is another difference betwixt these two kinds of ideas, 
which is no less evident, namely that tho’ neither the ideas of 
the memory nor imagination, neither the lively nor faint ideas 
can make their appearance in the mind, unless their corre- 
spondent impressions have gone before to prepare the way for 
them, yet the imagination is not restrain’d to the same order 
and form with the original impressions; while the memory is in 
a manner ty’d down in that respect, without any power of 
variation. 
’T is evident, that the memory preserves the original form, 
in which its objects were presented, and that where-ever we 
depart from it in recollecting any thing, it proceeds from some 
defect or imperfection in that faculty. An historian may, per- 
haps, for the more convenient carrying on of his narration, 
1 Part III. sect. 5.
-P-A-G-E-309
A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE = 287 
relate an event before another, to which it was in fact posterior; 
but then he takes notice of this disorder, if he be exact; and by 
that means replaces the idea in its due position. ’T is the same 
case in our recollection of those places and persons, with which 
we were formerly acquainted. The chief exercise of the memory 
is not to preserve the simple ideas, but their order and posi- 
tion. In short, this principle is supported by such a number of 
common and vulgar phenomena, that we may spare ourselves 
the trouble of insisting on it any farther. 
The same evidence follows us in our second principle, of the 
liberty of the imagination to transpose and change its ideas. The 
fables we meet with in poems and romances put this entirely 
out of question. Nature there is totally confounded, and no- 
thing mentioned but winged horses, fiery dragons, and mon- 
strous giants. Nor will this liberty of the fancy appear strange, 
when we consider, that all our ideas are copy’d from our impres- 
sions, and that there are not any two impressions which are 
perfectly inseparable. Not to mention, that this isan evident 
consequence of the division of ideas into simple and complex. 
Where-ever the imagination perceives a difference among ideas, 
it can easily produce a separation. 
Section IV. OF THE CONNEXION OR ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS 
As all simple ideas may be separated by the imagination, 
and may be united again in what form it pleases, nothing wou’d 
be more unaccountable than the operations of that faculty, 
were it not guided by some universal principles, which render 
it, in some measure, uniform with itself in all times and places. 
Were ideas entirely loose and unconnected, chance alone wou’d 
join them; and ’t is impossible the same simple ideas should 
fall regularly into complex ones (as they commonly do) with- 
out some bond of union among them, some associating quality, 
by which one idea naturally introduces another. This uniting 
principle among ideas is not to be consider’d as an inseparable 
connexion; for that has been already excluded from the imag- 
ination: Nor yet are we to conclude, that without it the mind 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  288 DAVID HUME 
cannot join two ideas; for nothing is more free than that 
faculty: but we are only to regard it as a gentle force, which 
commonly prevails, and is the cause why, among other things, 
languages so nearly correspond to each other; nature in a man- 
ner pointing out to every one those simple ideas, which are 
most proper to be united into a complex one. The qualities, 
from which this association arises, and by which the mind is 
after this manner convey’d from one idea to another, are three, 
viz. RESEMBLANCE, CoNTIGUITY in time or place, and CAUSE 
and EFFEcr. 
I believe it will not be very necessary to prove, that these 
qualities produce an association among ideas, and upon the 
appearance of one idea naturally introduce another. ’T is 
plain, that in the course of our thinking, and in the constant 
revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs easily from one 
idea to any other that resembles it, and that this quality alone 
is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association. ’T is like- 
wise evident, that as the senses, in changing their objects, are 
necessitated to change them regularly, and take them as they 
lie contiguous to each other, the imagination must by long cus- 
tom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the 
parts of space and time in conceiving its objects. As to the con- 
nexion, that is made by the relation of cause and effect, we shall 
have occasion afterwards to examine it to the bottom, and 
therefore shall not at present insist upon it. ’T is sufficient 
to observe, that there is no relation, which produces a stronger 
connexion in the fancy, and makes one idea more readily recall 
another, than the relation of cause and effect betwixt their 
objects. 
That we may understand the full extent of these relations, 
we must consider, that two objects are connected together in 
the imagination, not only when the one is immediately re- 
sembling, contiguous to, or the cause of the other, but also 
when there is interposed betwixt them a third object, which 
bears to both of them any of these relations. This may be 
carried on to a great length; tho’ at the same time we may 
observe, that each remove considerably weakens the relation.
-P-A-G-E-311
A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 289 
Cousins in the fourth degree are connected by causation, if I 
may be allowed to use that term; but not so closely as brothers, 
much less as child and parent. In general we may observe, that 
all the relations of blood depend upon cause and effect, and are 
esteemed near or remote, according to the number of connect- 
ing causes interpos’d betwixt the persons. 
Of the three relations above-mention’d this of causation is 
the most extensive. Two objects may be consider’d as plac’d 
in this relation, as well when one is the cause of any of the 
actions or motions of the other, as when the former is the 
cause of the existence of the latter. For as that action or 
motion is nothing but the object itself, consider’d in a certain 
light, and as the object continues the same in all its different 
situations, ’t is easy to imagine how such an influence of objects 
upon one another may connect them in the imagination. 
We may carry this farther, and remark, not only that two 
objects are connected by the relation of cause and effect, when 
the one produces a motion or any action in the other, but also 
when it has a power of producing it. And this we may observe 
to be the source of all the relations of interest and duty, by 
which men influence each other in society, and are plac’d in the 
ties of government and subordination. A master is such-a-one 
as by his situation, arising either from force or agreement, has 
a power of directing in certain particulars the actions of another, 
whom we call servant. A judge is one, who in all disputed cases 
can fix by his opinion the possession or property of any thing 
betwixt any members of the society. When a person is pos- 
sess’d of any power, there is no more required to convert it into 
action, but the exertion of the will; and that in every case is 
consider’d as possible, and in many as probable; especially in 
the case of authority, where the obedience of the subject is a 
pleasure and advantage to the superior. 
These are therefore the principles of union or cohesion 
among our simple ideas, and in the imagination supply the 
place of that inseparable connexion, by which they are united 
in our memory. Here is a kind of Atrraction, which in the 
mental world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  290 DAVID HUME 
in the natural, and to shew itself in as many and as various 
forms. Its effects are every where conspicuous; but as to its 
causes, they are mostly unknown, and must be resolv’d into 
original qualities of human nature, which I pretend not to 
explain. Nothing is more requisite for a true philosopher, than 
to restrain the intemperate desire of searching into causes, and 
having establish’d any doctrine upon a sufficient number of 
experiments, rest contented with that, when he sees a farther 
examination would lead him into obscure and uncertain specu- 
lations. In that case his enquiry wou’d be much better 
employ’d in examining the effects than the causes of his 
principle. 
Amongst the effects of this union or association of ideas, 
there are none more remarkable, than those complex ideas, 
which are the common subjects of our thoughts and reasoning, 
and generally arise from some principle of union among our 
simple ideas. These complex ideas may be divided into 
Relations, Modes, and Substances. We shall briefly examine 
each of these in order, and shall subjoin some considerations 
concerning our general and particular ideas, before we leave the 
present subject, which may be consider’d as the elements of this 
philosophy. ; 
SEecTION V. OF RELATIONS 
Tue word RELATION is commonly used in two senses con- 
siderably different from each other. Either for that quality, by 
which two ideas are connected together in the imagination, 
and the one naturally introduces the other, after the manner 
above-explained; or for that particular circumstance, in which, 
even upon the arbitrary union of two ideas in the fancy, we 
may think proper to compare them. In common language the 
former is always the sense, in which we use the word, relation; 
and ’t is only in philosophy, that we extend it to mean any par- 
ticular subject of comparison, without a connecting principle. 
Thus distance will be allowed by philosophers to be a true re- 
lation, because we acquire an idea of it by the comparing of 
objects: But in a common way we say, that nothing can be 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 291 
more distant than such or such things from each other, nothing can 
have less relation; as if distance and relation were incompatible. 
It may perhaps be esteemed an endless task to enumerate 
all those qualities, which make objects admit of comparison, 
and by which the ideas of philosophical relation are produced. 
But if we diligently consider them, we shall find that without 
difficulty they may be compriz’d under seven general heads, 
which may be considered as the source of all philosophical 
relation. 
1. The first is resemblance: And this is a relation, without 
which no philosophical relation can exist; since no objects 
will admit of comparison, but what have some degree of resem- 
blance. But tho’ resemblance be necessary to all philosophical 
relation, it does not follow, that it always produces a connexion 
or association of ideas. When a quality becomes very general, 
and is common to a great many individuals, it leads not the 
mind directly to any one of them; but by presenting at once too 
great a choice, does thereby prevent the imagination from fix- 
ing on any single object. 
2. Identity may be esteem’d a second species of relation. 
This relation I here consider as apply’d in its strictest sense 
to constant and unchangeable objects; without examining the 
nature and foundation of personal identity, which shall find 
its place afterwards. Of all relations the most universal is that 
of identity, being common to every being, whose existence has 
any duration. 
3. After identity the most universal and comprehensive rela- 
tions are those of Space and Time, which are the sources of an 
infinite number of comparisons, such as distant, contiguous, 
above, below, before, after, &c. 
4. All those objects, which admit of quantity, or number, may 
be compar’d in that particular; which is another very fertile 
source of relation. 
5. When any two objects possess the same quality in com- 
mon, the degrees, in which they possess it, form a fifth species 
of relation. Thus of two objects, which are both heavy, the 
one may be either of greater, or less weight than with the
-P-A-G-E-314
  292 DAVID HUME 
other. Two colours, that are of the same kind, may yet be of 
different shades, and in that respect admit of comparison. 
6. The relation of contrariety may at first sight be regarded 
as an exception to the rule, that no relation of any kind can 
subsist without some degree of resemblance. But let us consider, 
that no two ideas are in themselves contrary, except those of 
existence and non-existence, which are plainly resembling, as 
implying both of them an idea of the object; tho’ the latter 
excludes the object from all times and places, in which it is sup- 
posed not to exist. 
7. All other objects, such as fire and water, heat and cold, 
are only found to be contrary from experience, and from the 
contrariety of their causes or effects; which relation of cause 
and effect is a seventh philosophical relation, as well as a 
natural one. The resemblance implied in this relation, shall be 
explain’d afterwards. 
It might naturally be expected, that I should join difference 
to the other relations. But that I consider rather as a nega- 
tion of relation, than as any thing real or positive. Difference 
is of two kinds as oppos’d either to identity or resemblance. 
The first is called a difference of number; the other of kind. 
Section VI. Or MoprEs AND SUBSTANCES 
I wov’p fain ask those philosophers, who found so much 
of their reasonings on the distinction of substance and acci- 
dent, and imagine we have clear ideas of each, whether the 
idea of substance be deriv’d from the impressions of sensation 
or reflection? If it be convey’d to us by our senses, I ask, 
which of them; and after what manner? If it be perceiv’d by 
the eyes, it must be a colour; if by the ears, a sound; if by the 
palate, a taste; and so of the other senses. But I believe none 
will assert, that substance is either a colour, or sound, or a 
taste. The idea of substance must therefore be deriv’d from an 
impression or reflection, if it really exist. But the impressions 
of reflection resolve themselves into our passions and emotions; 
none of which can possibly represent a substance. We have 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
  
A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE = 293 
therefore no idea of substance, distinct from that of a collection 
of particular qualities, nor have we any other meaning when we 
either talk-or reason concerning it. 
The idea of a substance as well as that of a mode, is nothing 
but a collection of simple ideas, that are united by the imagina- 
tion, and have a particular name assigned them, by which we 
are able to recall, either to ourselves or others, that collection. 
But the difference betwixt these ideas consists in this, that the 
particular qualities, which form a substance, are commonly 
refer’d to an unknown something, in which they are supposed 
to inhere; or granting this fiction should not take place, are at 
least supposed to be closely and inseparably connected by the 
relations of contiguity and causation. The effect of this is, that 
whatever new simple quality we discover to have the same con- 
nexion with the rest, we immediately comprehend it among 
them, even tho’ it did not enter into the first conception of the 
substance. Thus our idea of gold may at first be a yellow 
colour, weight, malleableness, fusibility; but upon the discov- 
ery of its dissolubility in agua regia, we join that to the other 
qualities, and suppose it to belong to the substance as much as 
if its idea had from the beginning made a part of the compound 
one. The principle of union being regarded as the chief part of 
the complex idea, gives entrance to whatever quality after- 
wards occurs, and is equally comprehended by it, as are the 
others, which first presented themselves.” 
That this cannot take place in modes, is evident from con- 
sidering their nature. The simple ideas of which modes are 
formed, either represent qualities, which are not united by 
contiguity and causation, but are dispers’d in different sub- 
jects; or if they be all united together, the uniting principle 
is not regarded as the foundation of the complex idea. The 
idea of a dance is an instance of the first kind of modes; that 
of beauty of the second. The reason is obvious, why such com- 
plex ideas cannot receive any new idea, without changing the 
name, which distinguishes the mode.

PART III. OF KNOWLEDGE AND PROBABILITY 
Section I. Or KNOWLEDGE 
Tuere are’ seven different kinds of philosophical relation, 
viz. resemblance, identity, relations of time and place, propor- 
tion in quantity or number, degrees in any quality, contrariety, and 
causation. These relations may be divided into two classes; 
into such as depend entirely on the ideas, which we compare 
together, and such as may be chang’d without any change in 
the ideas. ’T is from the idea of a triangle, that we discover 
the relation of equality, which its three angles bear to two right 
ones; and this relation is invariable, as long as our idea remains 
the same. On the contrary, the relations of contiguity and 
distance betwixt two objects may be chang’d merely by an 
alteration of their place, without any change on the objects 
themselves or on their ideas; and the place depends on a hun- 
dred different accidents, which cannot be foreseen by the mind. 
’T is the same case with identity and causation. Two objects, 
tho’ perfectly resembling each other, and even appearing in the 
same place at different times, may be numerically different; 
And as the power, by which one object produces another, is 
never discoverable merely from their idea, ’t is evident cause 
and effect are relations, of which we receive information from 
experience, and not from any abstract reasoning or reflection. 
There is no single phenomenon, even the most simple, which 
can be accounted for from the qualities of the objects, as they 
appear to us; or which we cou’d foresee without the help of our 
memory and experience. 
It appears, therefore, that of these seven philosophical rela- 
tions, there remain only four, which depending solely upon 
ideas, can be the objects of knowledge and certainty. These 
four are resemblance, contrariety, degrees in quality, and propor- 
tions in quantity or number. Three of these relations are dis- 
coverable at first sight, and fall more properly under the pro- 
vince of intuition than demonstration. When any objects 
1 Part I. sect. 5,
-P-A-G-E-317
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 295 
resemble each other, the resemblance will at first strike the eye, 
or rather the mind; and seldom requires a second examination. 
The case is the same with conirariety, and with the degrees of 
any quality. No one can once doubt but existence and non- 
existence destroy each other, and are perfectly incompatible 
and contrary. And tho’ it be impossible to judge exactly of the 
degrees of any quality, such as colour, taste, heat, cold, when 
the difference betwixt them is very small; yet ’tis easy to 
decide, that any of them is superior or inferior to another, when 
the difference is considerable. And this decision we always 
pronounce at first sight, without any enquiry or reasoning. 
We might proceed, after the same manner, in fixing the pro- 
portions of quantity or number, and might at one view observe 
a superiority or inferiority betwixt any numbers, or figures; 
especially where the difference is very great and remarkable. 
As to equality or any exact proportion, we can only guess at it 
from a single consideration; except in very short numbers, or 
very limited portions of extension; which are comprehended in 
an instant, and where we perceive an impossibility of falling 
into any considerable error. In all other cases we must settle 
the proportions with some liberty, or proceed in a more 
artificial manner. 
I have already observ’d, that geometry, or the art, by which 
we fix the proportions of figures, tho’ it much excels, both in 
universality and exactness, the loose judgments of the senses 
and imagination, yet never attains a perfect precision and 
exactness. Its first principles are still drawn from the general 
appearance of the objects; and that appearance can never afford 
us any security, when we examine the prodigious minuteness of 
which nature is susceptible. Our ideas seem to give a perfect 
assurance, that no two right lines can have a common segment; 
but if we consider these ideas, we shall find, that they always 
suppose a sensible inclination of the two lines, and that where 
the angle they form is extremely small, we have no standard 
of a right line so precise as to assure us of the truth of this 
proposition. ’T is the same case with most of the primary de- 
cisions of the mathematics.
-P-A-G-E-318
  296 DAVID HUME 
There remain, therefore, algebra and arithmetic as the only 
sciences, in which we can carry on a chain of reasoning to any 
degree of intricacy, and yet preserve a perfect exactness and 
certainty. We are possest of a precise standard, by which we 
can judge of the equality and proportion of numbers; and ac- 
cording as they correspond or not to that standard, we deter- 
mine their relations, without any possibility of error. When two 
numbers are so combin’d, as that the one has always an unite 
answering to every unite of the other, we pronounce them equal; 
and ’t is for want of such a standard of equality in extension, 
that geometry can scarce be esteem’d a perfect and infallible 
science. 
But here it may not be amiss to obviate a difficulty, which 
may arise from my asserting, that tho’ geometry falls short of 
that perfect precision and certainty, which are peculiar to 
arithmetic and algebra, yet it excels the imperfect judgments 
of our senses and imagination. The reason why I impute 
any defect to geometry, is, because its original and funda- 
mental principles are deriv’d merely from appearances; and 
it may perhaps be imagin’d, that this defect must always attend 
it, and keep it from ever reaching a greater exactness in the 
comparison of objects or ideas, than what our eye or imagina- 
tion alone is able to attain. I own that this defect so far at- 
tends it, as to keep it from ever aspiring to a full certainty: But 
since these fundamental principles depend on the easiest and 
least deceitful appearances, they bestow on their consequences 
a degree of exactness, of which these consequences are singly 
incapable. ’T is impossible for the eye to determine the angles 
of a chiliagon to be equal to 1996 right angles, or make any 
conjecture, that approaches this proporticn; but when it deter- 
mines, that right lines cannot concur; that we cannot draw 
more than one right line between two given points; its mistakes 
can never be of any consequence. And this is the nature and 
use of geometry, to run us up to such appearances, as, by rea- 
son of their simplicity, cannot lead us into any considerable 
errcr. 
I shall here take occasion to propose a second observation
-P-A-G-E-319
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 297 
concerning our demonstrative reasonings, which is suggested 
by the same subject of the mathematics. ’Tis usual with 
mathematicians, to pretend, that those ideas, which are their 
objects, are of so refin’d and spiritual a nature, that they fall 
not under the conception of the fancy, but must be compre- 
hended by a pure and intellectual view, of which the superior 
faculties of the soul are alone capable. The same notion runs 
thro’ most parts of philosophy, and is principally made use of 
to explain our abstract ideas, and to shew how we can form an 
idea of a triangle, for instance, which shall neither be an isoceles 
nor scalenum, nor be confin’d to any particular length and pro- 
portion of sides. ’T is easy to see, why philosophers are so fond 
of this notion of some spiritual and refin’d perceptions; since by 
that means they cover many of their absurdities, and may 
refuse to submit to the decisions-of clear ideas, by appealing 
to such as are obscure and uncertain. But to destroy this arti- 
fice, we need but reflect on that principle so oft insisted on, that 
all our ideas are copy’d from our impressions. For from thence 
we may immediately conclude, that since all impressions are 
clear and precise, the ideas, which are copy’d from them, must 
be of the same nature, and can never, but from our fault, con- 
tain any thing so dark and intricate. An idea is by its very 
nature weaker and fainter than an impression; but being in 
every other respect the same, cannot imply any very great 
mystery. If its weakness render it obscure, ’t is our business 
to remedy that defect, as much as possible, by keeping the 
idea steady and precise; and till we have done so, ’t is in vain 
to pretend to reasoning and philosophy. 
Section II. OF PROBABILITY; AND OF THE IDEA OF CAUSE 
AND EFFECT 
Tus is all I think necessary to observe concerning those 
‘four relations, which are the foundation of science; but as to 
the other three, which depend not upon the idea, and may be 
absent or present even while that remains the same, ’t will be 
proper to explain them more particularly. These three rela-
-P-A-G-E-320
298 DAVID HUME 
tions are identity, the situations in time and place, and causa- 
tion. 
All kinds of reasoning consist in nothing but a comparison, 
and a discovery of those relations, either-constant or incon- 
stant, which two or more objects bear to each other. This 
comparison we may make, either when both the objects are 
present to the senses, or when neither of them is present, or 
when only one. When both the objects are present to the 
senses along with the relation, we call this perception rather 
than reasoning; nor is there in this case any exercise of the 
thought, or any action, properly speaking, but a mere passive 
admission of the impressions thro’ the organs of sensation.? 
According to this way of thinking, we ought not to receive as 
reasoning any of the observations we may make concerning 
identity, and the relations of-time and place; since in none of 
them the mind can go beyond what is immediately present to 
the senses, either to discover the real existence or the relations 
of objects. "Tis only causation, which produces such a con- 
nexion, as to give us assurance from the existence or action of 
one object, that ’t was follow’d or preceded by any other exist- 
ence or action; nor can the other two relations be ever made 
use of in reasoning, except so far as they either affect or are 
affected by it. There is nothing in any objects to perswade us, 
that they are either always remote or always contiguous; and 
when from experience and observation we discover, that their 
relation in this particular is invariable, we always conclude 
there is some secret cause, which separates or unites them. The 
same reasoning extends to identity. We readily suppose an 
object may continue individually the same, tho’ several times 
absent from and present to the senses; and ascribe to it an 
identity, notwithstanding the interruption of the perception, 
whenever we conclude, that if we had kept our eye or hand con- 
stantly upon it, it wou’d have convey’d an invariable and unin- 
terrupted perception. But this conclusion beyond the impres- 
sions of our senses can be founded only on the connexion of cause 
and effect; nor can we otherwise have any security, that the 
1 Cf. Green and Grose’s Introduction, § 327. 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 299 
object is not chang’d upon us, however much the new object 
may resemble that which was formerly present to the senses. 
Whenever we discover such a perfect resemblance, we consider 
whether it be common in that species of objects; whether pos- 
sibly or probably any cause cou’d operate in producing the 
change and resemblance; and according as we determine con- 
cerning these causes and effects, we form our judgment concern- 
ing the identity of the object.1 
Here then it appears, that of those three relations, which 
depend not upon the mere ideas, the only one, that can be 
trac’d beyond our senses, and informs us of existences and 
objects, which we do not see or feel, is causation. This relation, 
therefore, we shall endeavour to explain fully before we leave 
the subject of the understanding. 
To begin regularly, we must consider the idea of causation 
and see from what origin it is deriv’d. ’T is impossible to reason 
justly, without understanding perfectly the idea concerning 
which we reason; and ’t is impossible perfectly to understand 
any idea, without tracing it up to its origin, and examining that 
primary impression, from which it arises. The examination of 
the impression bestows a clearness on the idea; and the exami- 
nation of the idea bestows a like clearness on all our reasoning. 
Let us therefore cast our eye on any two subjects, which 
we call cause and effect, and turn them on all sides, in order 
to find that impression, which produces an idea-of such pro- 
digious consequence. At first sight I perceive, that .I must not 
search for it in any of the particular qualities of the objects; 
since, which-ever of these qualities I pitch on, I find some 
object, that is not possest of it, and yet falls under the denom- 
ination of cause or effect. And indeed there is nothing existent, 
either externally or internally, which is not to be consider’d 
either as a cause or an effect; tho’ ’t is plain there is no one 
quality, which universally belongs to all beings, and gives them 
a title to that denomination. 
The idea, then, of causation must be deriv’d from some 
relation among objects; and that relation we must now en- 
1 Cf. Green and Grose’s Introduction, § 313.
-P-A-G-E-322
    300 DAVID HUME 
deavour to discover. I find in the first place, that whatever 
objects are consider’d as causes or effects, are contiguous; and 
that nothing can operate in a time or place, which is ever so 
little remov’d from those of its existence. Tho’ distant objects 
may sometimes seem productive of each other, they are com- 
monly found upon examination to be link’d by a chain of 
causes, which are contiguous among themselves, and to the 
distant objects; and when in any particular instance we cannot 
discover this connexion, we still presume it to exist. We may 
therefore consider the relation of conTicuITY as essential to 
that of causation; at least may suppose it such, according to 
the general opinion, till we can find a more proper occasion to 
clear up this matter, by examining what objects are or are not 
susceptible of juxtaposition and conjunction. 
The second relation I shall observe as essential to causes 
and effects, is not so universally acknowledg’d, but is liable to 
some controversy. "I is that of prroRiTY of time in the cause 
before the effect. Some pretend that ’t is not absolutely neces- 
sary a cause shou’d precede its effect; but that any object or 
action, in the very first moment of its existence, may exert 
its productive quality, and give rise to another object or action, 
perfectly co-temporary with itself. But beside that experience 
in most instances seems to contradict this opinion, we may 
establish the relation of priority by a kind of inference or rea- 
soning. ’T is an establish’d maxim both in natural and moral 
philosophy, that an object, which exists for any time in its full 
perfection without producing another, is not its sole cause; but 
is assisted by some other principle, which pushes it from its 
state of inactivity, and makes it exert that energy, of which it 
was secretly possest. Now if any cause may be perfectly co- 
temporary with its effect, ’t is certain, according to this maxim, 
that they must all of them be so; since any one of them, which 
retards its operation for a single moment, exerts not itself at 
that very individual time, in which it might have operated, 
and therefore is no proper cause. The consequence of this 
wou’d be no less than the destruction of that succession of 
1 Part IV, sect. 5.
-P-A-G-E-323
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 301 
causes, which we observe in the world; and indeed, the utter 
annihilation of time. For if one cause were co-temporary with 
its effect, and this effect with zs effect, and so on, ’t is plain 
there wou’d be no such thing as succession, and all objects 
must be co-existent. 
If this argument appear satisfactory, ’t is well. If not, I 
beg the reader to allow me the same liberty, which I have us’d 
in the preceding case, of supposing it such. For he shall find, 
that the affair is of no great importance. 
Having thus discover’d or suppos’d the two relations of 
contiguity and succession to be essential to causes and effects, 
I find I am stopt short, and can proceed no farther in consider- 
ing any single instance of cause and effect. Motion in one body 
is regarded upon impulse as the cause of motion in another. 
When we consider these objects with the utmost attention, we 
find only that the one body approaches the other; and that the 
motion of it precedes that of the other, but without any sensible 
interval. ’T is in vain to rack ourselves with farther thought 
and reflection upon this subject. We can go no farther in con- 
sidering this particular instance. 
Shou’d any one leave this instance, and pretend to define a 
cause, by saying it is something productive of another, ’t is 
evident he wou’d say nothing. For what does he mean by 
production? Can he give any definition of it, that will not be 
the same with that of causation? If he can; I desire it may be 
produc’d. If he cannot; he here runs in a circle, and gives a 
synonymous term instead of a definition. 
Shall we then rest contented with these two relations of 
contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of 
causation? By no means. An object may be contiguous and 
prior to another, without being consider’d as its cause. There 
is a NECESSARY CONNEXION to be taken into consideration; 
and that relation is of much greater importance, than any of 
the other two above-mention’d. !

-P-A-G-E-324
  302 DAVID HUME 
Section XIV. Or THE IDEA or NECESSARY CONNEXION 
It has been establish’d as a certain principle, that general 
or abstract ideas are nothing but individual ones taken in a 
certain light, and that, in reflecting on any object, ’tis as 
impossible to exclude from our thought all particular degrees 
of quantity and quality as from the real nature of things. If 
we be possest, therefore, of any idea of power in general, we 
must also be able to conceive some particular species of it; and 
as power cannot subsist alone, but is always regarded as an 
attribute of some being or existence, we must be able to place 
this power in some particular being, and conceive that being 
as endow’d with a real force and energy, by which such a par- 
ticular effect necessarily results from its operation. We must 
distinctly and particularly conceive the connexion betwixt the 
cause and effect, and be able to pronounce, from a simple view 
of the one, that it must be follow’d or preceded by the other. 
This is the true manner of conceiving a particular power in a 
particular body: and a general idea being impossible without an 
individual; where the latter is impossible, ’t is certain the 
former can never exist. Now nothing is more evident, than that 
the human mind cannot form such an idea of two objects, as to 
conceive any connexion betwixt them, or comprehend distinctly 
that power or efficacy, by which they are united. Such a‘con- 
nexion wou’d amount to a demonstration, and wou’d imply the 
absolute impossibility for the one object not to follow, or to be 
conceived not to follow upon the other: Which kind of connex- 
ion has already been rejected in all cases. If any one is of a 
contrary opinion, and thinks he has attain’d a notion of power 
in any particular object, I desire he may point out to me that 
object. But till I meet with such-a-one, which I despair of, I 
cannot forbear concluding, that since we can never distinctly 
conceive how any particular power can possibly reside in any 
particular object, we deceive ourselves in imagining we can 
form any such general idea. 
* Thus upon the whole we may infer, that when we talk of any
-P-A-G-E-325
A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 303 
being, whether of a superior or inferior nature, as endow’d with 
a power or force, proportion’d to any effect; when we speak of a 
necessary connexion betwixt objects, and suppose, that this 
connexion depends upon an efficacy or energy, with which any 
of these objects are endow’d; in all these expressions, so apply’d 
we have really no distinct meaning, and make use only of com- 
mon words, without any clear and determinate ideas. But as 
tis more probable, that these expressions do here lose their 
true meaning by being wrong apply’d, than that they never have 
any meaning; ’t will be proper to bestow another consideration 
on this subject, to see if possibly we can discover the nature and 
origin of those ideas, we annex to them. 
Suppose two objects to be presented to us, of which the one 
is the cause and the other the effect; ’t is plain, that from the 
simple consideration of one, or both these objects we never 
shall perceive the tie, by which they are united, or be able 
certainly to pronounce, that there is a connexion betwixt them. 
’T is not, therefore, from any one instance, that we arrive at 
the idea of cause and effect, of a necessary connexion of power, 
of force, of energy, and of efficacy. Did we ever see any but 
particular conjunctions of objects, entirely different from each 
other, we shou’d never be able to form any such ideas. 
But again; suppose we observe several instances, in which 
the same objects are always conjoin’d together, we immediately 
conceive a connexion betwixt them, and begin to draw an in- 
ference from one to another. This multiplicity of resembling 
instances, therefore, constitutes the very essence of power or 
connexion, and is the source, from which the idea of it arises. 
In order, then, to understand the idea of power, we must con- 
sider that multiplicity; nor do I ask more to give a solution of 
that difficulty, which has so long perplex’d us. For thus I rea- 
son. The repetition of perfectly similar instances can never 
alone give rise to an original idea, different from what is to be 
found in any particular instance, as has been observ’d, and as 
evidently follows from our fundamental principle, that all ideas 
are copy’d from impressions. Since therefore the idea of power 
is a new original idea, not to be found in any one instance, and.
-P-A-G-E-326
  304. DAVID HUME 
which yet arises from the repetition of several instances, it 
follows, that the repetition alone has not that effect, but must 
either discover or produce something new, which is the source 
of that idea. Did the repetition neither discover nor produce 
any thing new, our ideas might be multiply’d by it, but wou’d 
not be enlarg’d above what they are upon the observation of 
one single instance. Every enlargement, therefore, (such as the 
idea of power or connexion) which arises from the multiplicity 
of similar instances, is copy’d from some effects of the multi- 
plicity, and will be perfectly understood by understanding these 
effects. Wherever we find any thing new to be discover’d or 
produc’d by the repetition, there we must place the power, and 
must never look for it in any other object. 
But ’t is evident, in the first place, that the repetition of like 
objects in like relations of succession and contiguity discovers 
nothing new in any one of them; since we can draw no inference 
from it, nor make it a subject either of our demonstrative or 
probable reasonings; as has been already prov’d. Nay sup- 
pose we cou’d draw an inference, ’t wou’d be of no consequence 
in the present case; since no kind of reasoning can give rise to 
a new idea, such as this of power is; but wherever we reason, we 
must antecedently be possest of clear ideas, which may be the 
objects of our reasoning. The conception always precedes the 
understanding; and where the one is obscure, the other is un- 
certain; where the one fails, the other must fail also. 
Secondly, ’T is certain that this repetition of similar objects 
in similar situations produces nothing new either in these ob- 
jects, or in any external body. For’ t will readily be allow’d, that 
the several instances we have of the conjunction of resembling 
causes and effects are in themselves entirely independent, and 
that the communication of motion, which I see result at present 
from the shock of two billiard-balls, is totally distinct from that 
which I saw result from such an impulse a twelve-month ago. 
These impulses have no influence on each other. They are 
entirely divided by time and place; and the one might have 
existed and communicated motion, tho’ the other never had 
been in being. 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE = 305 
There is, then, nothing new either discover’d or produc’d in 
any objects by their constant conjunction, and by the uninter- 
rupted resemblance of their relations of succession and con- 
tiguity. But ’tis from this resemblance, that the ideas of 
necessity, of power, and of efficacy, are deriv’d. These ideas, 
therefore, represent not any thing, that does or can belong to 
the objects, which are constantly conjoin’d. This is an argu- 
ment, which, in every view we can examine it, will be found 
perfectly unanswerable. Similar instances are still the first 
source of our idea of power or necessity; at the same time that 
they have no influence by their similarity either on each other, 
or on any external object. We must therefore, turn ourselves 
to some other quarter to seek the origin of that idea. 
Tho’ the several resembling instances, which give rise to 
the idea of power, have no influence on each other, and can 
never produce any new quality in the object, which can be the 
model of that idea, yet the observation of this resemblance 
produces a new impression in the mind, which is its real model. 
For after we have observ’d the resemblance in a sufficient 
number of instances, we immediately feel a determination of 
the mind to pass from one object to its usual attendant, and to 
conceive it in a stronger light upon account of that relation. 
This determination is the only effect of the resemblance; and 
therefore must be the same with power or efficacy, whose idea 
is deriv’d from the resemblance. The several instances of re- 
sembling conjunctions leads us into the notion of power and 
necessity. These instances are in themselves totally distinct 
from each other, and have no union but in the mind, which ob- 
serves them, and collects their ideas. Necessity, then, is the 
effect of this observation, and is nothing but an internal impres- 
sion of the mind, or a determination to carry our thoughts from 
one object to another. Without considering it in this view, we 
can never arrive at the most distant notion of it, or be able to 
attribute it either to external or internal objects, to spirit or 
body, to causes or effects. 
The necessary connexion betwixt causes and effects is the 
foundation of our inference from one to the other. The founda-
-P-A-G-E-328
    306 DAVID HUME 
tion of our inference is the transition arising from the accus- 
tom’d union. These are, therefore, the same. 
The idea of necessity arises from some impression. There 
is no impression convey’d by our senses, which can give rise 
to that idea. It must, therefore, be deriv’d from some internal 
impression, or impression of reflection. There is no internal 
impression, which has any relation to the present business, 
but that propensity, which custom produces, to pass from an 
object to the idea of its usual attendant. This therefore is the 
essence of necessity. Upon the whole, necessity is something, 
that exists in the mind, not in objects; nor is it possible for us 
ever to form the most distant idea of it, consider’d as a quality 
in bodies. Either we have no idea of necessity, or necessity is 
nothing but that determination of the thought to pass from 
causes to effects and from effects to causes, according to their 
experienc’d union. 
Thus as the necessity, which makes two times two equal to 
four, or three angles of a triangle equal to two right ones, lies 
only in the act of the understanding, by which we consider and 
compare these ideas; in like manner the necessity or power, 
which unites causes and effects, lies in the determination of the 
mind to pass from the one to the other. The efficacy or energy 
of causes is neither plac’d in the causes themselves, nor in 
the deity, nor in the concurrence of these two principles; but 
belongs entirely to the soul, which considers the union of two 
or more objects in all past instances. ’T is here that the real 
power of causes is plac’d, along with their connexion and 
necessity. 
I am sensible, that of all the paradoxes, which I have had, 
or shall hereafter have occasion to advance in the course of this 
treatise, the present one is the most violent, and that ’tis 
merely by dint of solid proof and reasoning I can ever hope it 
will have admission, and overcome the inveterate prejudices 
of mankind. Before we are reconcil’d to this doctrine, how 
often must we repeat to ourselves, that the simple view of any 
two objects or actions, however related, can never give us any 
idea of power, or of a connexion betwixt them: that this idea
-P-A-G-E-329
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 307 
arises from the repetition of their union: that the repetition 
neither discovers nor causes any thing in the objects, but has 
an influence only on the mind, by that customary transition it 
produces: that this customary transition is, therefore, the same 
with the power and necessity; which are consequently qualities 
of perceptions, not of objects, and are internally felt by the 
soul, and not perceiv’d externally in bodies? There is com- 
monly an astonishment attending every thing extraordinary; 
and this astonishment changes immediately into the highest 
degree of esteem or contempt, according as we approve or dis- 
approve of the subject. I am much afraid, that tho’ the fore- 
going reasoning appears to me the shortest and most decisive 
imaginable; yet with the generality of readers the biass of the 
mind will prevail, and give them a prejudice against the present 
doctrine. 
This contrary biass is easily accounted for. ’T is a common 
observation, that the mind has a great propensity to spread 
itself on external objects, and to conjoin with them any internal 
impressions, which they occasion, and which always make their 
appearance at the same time that these objects discover them- 
selves to the senses. Thus as certain sounds and smells are 
always found to attend certain visible objects, we naturally 
imagine a conjunction, even in place, betwixt the objects and 
qualities, tho’ the qualities be of such a nature as to admit of 
no such conjunction, and really exist no where. But of this 
more fully ! hereafter. Mean while ’t is sufficient to observe, 
that the same propensity is the reason, why we suppose neces- 
sity and power to lie in the objects we consider, not in our mind, 
that considers them; notwithstanding it is not possible for us 
to form the most distant idea of that quality, when it is not 
taken for the determination of the mind, to pass from the idea 
of an object to that of its usual attendant. 
But tho’ this be the only reasonable account we can give of 
necessity, the contrary notion is so riveted in the mind from the 
principles above-mention’d, that I doubt not but my senti- 
ments will be treated by many as extravagant and ridiculous.

What! the efficacy of causes lie in the determination of the 
mind! As if causes did not operate entirely independent of the 
mind, and wou’d not continue their operation, even tho’ there 
was no mind existent to contemplate them, or reason concern- 
ing them. Thought may well depend on causes for its opera- 
tion, but not causes on thought. This is to reverse the order of 
nature, and make that secondary, which is really primary. To 
every operation there is a power proportion’d; and this power 
must be plac’d on the body, that operates. If we remove the 
power from one cause, we must ascribe it to another: But to 
remove it from all causes, and bestow it on a being, that is no 
ways related to the cause or effect, but by perceiving them, is a 
gross absurdity, and contrary to the most certain principles of 
human reason. 
I can only reply to all these arguments, that the case is here 
much the same, as if a blind man shou’d pretend to find a great 
many absurdities in the supposition, that the colour of scarlet 
is not the same with the sound of a trumpet, nor light the same 
with solidity. If we have really no idea of a power or efficacy 
in any object, or of any real connexion betwixt causes and 
effects, ’t will be to little purpose to prove, that an efficacy is ne- 
cessary in all operations. We do not understand our own mean- 
ing in talking so, but ignorantly confound ideas, which are en- 
tirely distinct from each other. I am, indeed, ready to allow, 
that there may be several qualities both in material and imma- 
terial objects, with which we are utterly unacquainted; and if 
we please to call these power or efficacy, ’t will be of little conse- 
quence to the world. But when, instead of meaning these un- 
known qualities, we make the terms of power and efficacy sig- 
nify something, of which we have a clear idea, and which is 
incompatible with those objects, to which we apply it, obscur- 
ity and error begin then to take place, and we are led astray by 
a false philosophy. This is the case, when we transfer the de- 
termination of the thought to external objects, and suppose any 
real intelligible connexion betwixt them; that being a quality, 
which can only belong to the mind that considers them. 
As to what may be said, that the operations of nature are   
     
-P-A-G-E-331
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 309 
independent of our thought and reasoning, I allow it; and ac- 
cordingly have observ’d, that objects bear to each other the 
relations of contiguity and succession; that like objects may be 
observ’d in several instances to have like relations; and that all 
this is independent of, and antecedent to the operations of the 
understanding. But if we go any farther, and ascribe a power 
or necessary connexion to these objects; this is what we can 
never observe in them, but must draw the idea of it from what 
we feel internally in contemplating them. And this I carry so 
far, that I am ready to convert my present reasoning into an 
instance of it, by a subtility, which it will not be difficult to 
comprehend. 
When any object is presented to us, it immediately conveys 
to the mind a lively idea of that object, which is usually found 
to attend it; and this determination of the mind forms the 
necessary connexion of these objects. But when we change the 
point of view, from the objects to the perceptions; in that case 
the impression is to be considered as the cause, and the lively 
idea as the effect; and their necessary connexion is that new 
determination, which we feel to pass from the idea of the one to 
that of the other. The uniting principle among our internal 
perceptions is as unintelligible as that among external objects, 
and is not known to us any other way than by experience. Now 
the nature and effects of experience have been already suffi- 
ciently examin’d and explain’d. It never gives us any insight 
into the internal structure or operating principle of objects, but 
only accustoms the mind to pass from one to another. 
°T is now time to collect all the different parts of this reason- 
ing, and by joining them together form an exact definition of 
the relation of cause and effect, which makes the subject of the 
present enquiry. This order wou’d not have been excusable, of 
first examining our inference from the relation before we had 
explain’d the relation itself, had it been possible to proceed in a 
different method. But as the nature of the relation depends so 
much on that of the inference, we have been oblig’d to advance 
in this seemingly preposterous manner, and make use of terms 
before we were able exactly to define them, or fix their meaning.
-P-A-G-E-332
    310 DAVID HUME 
We shall now correct this fault by giving a precise definition of 
cause and effect. 
There may two definitions be given of this relation, which 
are only different, by their presenting a different view of the 
same object, and making us consider it either as a philosophical 
or as a natural relation; either as a comparison of two ideas, 
or as an association betwixt them. We may define a causE to 
be ‘An object precedent and contiguous to another, and where 
all the objects resembling the former are plac’d in like relations 
of precedency and contiguity to those objects, that resemble 
the latter.’ If this definition be esteem’d defective, because 
drawn from objects foreign to the cause, we may substitute this 
other definition in its place, viz. ‘A CAUSE is an object precedent 
and contiguous to another, and so united with it, that the idea 
of the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, 
and the impression of the one to form a more lively idea of the 
other.’ Shou’d this definition also be rejected for the same 
reason, I know no other remedy, than that the persons, who 
express this delicacy, should substitute a juster definition in its 
place. But for my part I must own my incapacity for such an 
undertaking. When I examine with the utmost accuracy those 
objects, which are commonly denominated causes and effects, 
I find, in considering a single instance, that the one object 
is precedent and contiguous to the other; and in inlarging my 
view to consider several instances, I find only, that like objects 
are constantly plac’d in like relations of succession and contig- 
uity. Again, when I consider the influence of this constant 
conjunction, I perceive, that such a relation can never be an 
object of reasoning, and can never operate upon the mind, 
but by means of custom, which determines the imagination to 
make a transition from the idea of one object to that of its 
usual ‘attendant, and from the impression of one to a more 
lively idea of the other. However extraordinary these senti- 
ments may appear, I think it fruitless to trouble myself with 
any farther enquiry or reasoning upon the subject, but shall 
repose myself on them as on establish’d maxims. 
’T will only be proper, before we leave this subject, to draw
-P-A-G-E-333
  A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE 311 
some corrollaries from it, by which we may remove several 
prejudices and popular errors, that have very much prevail’d 
in philosophy. First, We may learn from the foregoing doc- 
trine, that all causes are of the same kind, and that in particular 
there is no foundation for that distinction, which we sometimes 
make betwixt efficient causes, and causes sine qua non; or be- 
twixt efficient causes, and formal, and material, and exem- 
plary, and final causes. For as our idea of efficiency is deriv’d 
from the constant conjunction of two objects, wherever this is 
observ’d, the cause is efficient and where it is not, there can 
never be a cause of any kind. For the same reason we must 
reject the distinction betwixt cause and occasion, when sup- 
pos’d to signify any thing essentially different from each other. 
If constant conjunction be imply’d in what we call occasion, 
’t isa real cause. If not, ’t is no relation at all, and cannot give 
rise to any argument or reasoning. 
Secondly, The same course of reasoning will make us con- 
clude, that there is but one kind of necessity, as there is but one 
kind of cause, and that the common distinction betwixt moral 
and physical necessity is without any foundation in nature. 
This clearly appears from the precedent explication of neces- 
sity. ’T is the constant conjunction of objects, along with the 
determination of the mind, which constitutes a physical neces- 
sity: And the removal of these is the same thing with chance. As 
objects must either be conjoin’d or not, and as the mind must 
either be determin’d or not to pass from one object to another, 
’t is impossible to admit of any medium betwixt chance and an 
absolute necessity. In weakening this conjunction and deter- 
mination you do not change the nature of the necessity; since 
even in the operation of bodies, these have different degrees of 
constancy and force, without producing a different species of 
that relation. 
The distinction, which we often make betwixt power and 
the exercise of it, is equally without foundation. 
Thirdly, We may now be able fully to overcome all that 
repugnance, which ’t is so natural for us to entertain against 
the foregoing reasoning, by which we endeavour’d to prove,
-P-A-G-E-334
ne Ne a ee TE ee a ee TT eT TC ae 
312 DAVID HUME 
that the necessity of a cause to every beginning of existence 
is not founded on any arguments either demonstrative or intui- 
tive. Such an opinion will not appear strange after the fore- 
going definitions. If we define a cause to be an object precedent 
and contiguous to another, and where all the objects resembling the 
former are plac’d in a like relation of priority and contiguity to 
those objects, that resemble the latter; we may easily conceive, that 
there is no absolute nor metaphysical necessity, that every 
beginning of existence shou’d be attended with such an object. 
If we define a cause to be, An object precedent and contiguous to 
another, and so united with it in the imagination, that the idea of 
the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, and the 
impression of the one to form a more lively idea of the other; we 
shall make still less difficulty of assenting to this opinion. Such 
an influence on the mind is in itself perfectly extraordinary 
and incomprehensible; nor can we be certain of its reality, but 
from experience and observation. 
I shall add as a fourth corrollary, that we can never have 
reason to believe that any object exists, of which we cannot 
form an idea. For as all our reasonings concerning existence 
are deriv’d from causation, and as all our reasonings concerning 
causation are deriv’d from the experienc’d conjunction of 
objects, not from any reasoning or reflection, the same experi- 
ence must give us a notion of these objects, and must remove 
all mystery from our conclusions. This is so evident, that 
’*t wou’d scarce have merited our attention, were it not to 
obviate certain objections of this kind, which might arise 
against the following reasonings concerning mailer and sub- 
stance. I need not observe, that a full knowledge of the object 
is not requisite, but only of those qualities of it, which we 
believe to exist.

OBSERVATIONS ON MAN, HIS FRAME, HIS 
DUTY, AND HIS EXPECTATIONS* 
PART I. INTRODUCTION + 
Man consists of two parts, body and mind. 
The first is subjected to our senses and inquiries, in the same 
manner as the other parts of the external material world. 
The last is that substance, agent, principle, &c. to which we 
refer the sensations, ideas, pleasures, pains, and voluntary 
motions. 
Sensations are those internal feelings of the mind, which arise 
from the impressions made by external objects upon the several 
parts of our bodies. 
All our other internal feelings may be called ideas. Some 
of these appear to spring up in the mind of themselves, some 
are suggested by words, others arise in other ways. Many 
writers comprehend sensations under ideas; but I every where 
use these words in the senses here ascribed to them. 
* London, 1749; 2d ed. (with Life), 1791; 6th rev. ed. 1834. 
+ Hartley describes the origin of the Observations on Man, in its Preface, as 
follows: — “ About eighteen years ago [1731] I was informed, that the Rev. Mr. 
Gay, then living, asserted the possibility of deducing all our intellectual pleasures 
and pains from association. This put me upon considering the power of associa- 
tion. Mr. Gay published his sentiments on this matter, about the same time, in 
a Dissertation on the Fundamental Principle of Virtue, prefixed to Mr. Arch- 
deacon Law’s translation of Archbishop King’s Origin of Evil.” 
The internal evidence, moreover, tends to prove that the anonymous tract 
entitled, An Enquiry into the Origin of the Human Appetite and Affections, 
shewing how each arises from Association, Lincoln 1747, which is the fourth of 
Rev. Samuel Parr’s Metaphysical Tracts, Lond. 1837,was also written by the 
‘modest’ Gay, whose priority as regards the doctrine of association is thereby 
more firmly secured. 
   
-P-A-G-E-336
  314 DAVID HARTLEY 
The ideas which resemble sensations, are called ideas of sen- 
sation: all the rest may therefore be called intellectual ideas. 
It will appear in the course of these observations, that the 
ideas of sensation are the elements of which all the rest are 
compounded. Hence ideas of sensation may be termed simple, 
intellectual ones complex. 
The pleasures and pains are comprehended under the sensa- 
tions and ideas, as these are explained above. For all our pleas- 
ures and pains are internal feelings, and conversely, all our 
internal feelings seem to be attended with some degree either of 
pleasure or pain. However, I shall, for the most part, give the 
names of pleasure and pain only to such degrees as are consider- 
able; referring all low evanescent ones to the head of mere 
sensations and ideas. 
The pleasures and pains may be ranged under seven general 
classes; viz. 
1. Sensation; 
. Imagination; 
. Ambition; 
. Self-Interest; 
. Sympathy; 
. Theopathy; and, 
. The Moral Sense; according as they arise from, 
. The impressions made on the external senses; 
. Natural or artificial beauty or deformity; 
. The opinions of others concerning us; 
4. Our possession or want of the means of happiness, and 
security from, or subjection to, the hazards of misery; 
5. The pleasures and pains of our fellow-creatures; 
6. The affections excited in us by the contemplation of the 
Deity; or 
7. Moral beauty and deformity. 
The human mind may also be considered as endued with the 
faculties of memory, imagination, or fancy, understanding, affec- 
tion, and will. wn HN AN RW DN

  OBSERVATIONS ON MAN 315 
CHAPTER I. THE DOCTRINES OF VIBRATIONS AND 
ASSOCIATION IN GENERAL 
My chief design in the following chapter is briefly to explain, 
establish, and apply the doctrines of vibrations and association. 
The first of these doctrines is taken from the hints concerning 
the performance of sensation and motion, which Sir Isaac New- 
ton has given at the end of his Principia,! and in the Questions 
annexed to his Optics’; the last, from what Mr. Locke,’ and other 
ingenious persons since his time, have delivered concerning the 
influence of association over our opinions and affections, and its 
use in explaining those things in an accurate and precise way, 
which are commonly referred to the power of habit and custom, 
is a general and indeterminate one. 
The doctrine of vibrations may appear at first sight to have 
no connexion with that of association; however, if these doc- 
trines be found in fact to contain the laws of the bodily and 
mental powers respectively, they must be related to each other, 
since the body and mind are. One may expect, that vibrations 
should infer association as their effect, and association point to 
vibrations as its cause. I will endeavour, in the present chapter, 
to trace out this mutual relation. 
The proper method of philosophizing seems to be, to discover 
and establish the general laws of action, affecting the subject 
under consideration, from certain select, well-defined, and well- 
attested phenomena, and then to explain and predict the other 
phenomena by these laws. This is the method of analysis and 
synthesis recommended and followed by Sir Isaac Newton. 
I shall not be able to execute, with any accuracy, what the 
reader might expect of this kind, in respect of the doctrines of 
vibrations and association, and their general laws, on account 
of the great intricacy, extensiveness, and novelty of the sub- 
ject. However, I will attempt a sketch in the best manner I 
can, for the service of future inquirers. :

Section I. Tae Doctrine oF VIBRATIONS, AND ITS USE FOR 
EXPLAINING THE SENSATIONS 
Prop. I. — The white medullary Substance of the Brain, spinal 
Marrow, and the Nerves proceeding from them, is the imme- 
diate Instrument of Sensation and Motion. 
Unpber the word brain, in these observations, I comprehend 
all that lies within the cavity of the skull, z.e. the cerebrum, or 
brain properly so called, the cerebellum, and the medulla 
oblongata. 
This proposition seems to be sufficiently proved in the writ- 
ings of physicians and anatomists; from the structure and func- 
tions of the several organs of the human body; from experi- 
ments on living animals; from the symptoms of diseases, and 
from dissections of morbid bodies. Sensibility, and the power 
of motion, seem to be conveyed to all the parts, in their natural 
state, from the brain and spinal marrow, along the nerves. 
These arise from the medullary, not the cortical part, every 
where, and are themselves of a white medullary substance. 
When the nerves of any part are cut, tied, or compressed in any 
considerable degree, the functions of that part are either 
entirely destroyed, or much impaired. When the spinal mar- 
row is compressed by a dislocation of the vertebre of the back, 
all the parts, whose nerves arise below the place of dislocation, 
become paralytic. When any considerable injury is done to the 
medullary substance of the brain, sensation, voluntary motion, 
memory, and intellect, are either entirely lost, or much im- 
paired; and if the injury be very great, this extends immedi- 
ately to the vital motions also, viz. to those of the heart, and 
organs of respiration, so as to occasion death. But this does not 
hold equally in respect of the cortical substance of the brain; 
perhaps not at all, unless as far as injuries done to it extend 
themselves to the medullary substance. In dissections after 
apoplexies, palsies, epilepsies, and other distempers affecting 
the sensations and motions, it is usual to find some great dis- 
order in the brain, from preternatural tumours, from blood, 
matter, or serum, lying upon the brain, or in its ventricles, &c.
-P-A-G-E-339
  OBSERVATIONS ON MAN 317 
This may suffice as general evidence for the present. The par- 
ticular reasons of some of these phenomena, with more definite 
evidences, will offer themselves in the course of these observa- 
tions. 
Prop. II. — The white medullary Substance of the Brain is also 
the immediate Instrument, by which Ideas are presented to the 
Mind: or, in other words, whatever Changes are made in this 
Substance, corresponding Changes are made in our Ideas; and 
vice versa. 
Tue evidence for this proposition is also to be taken from the 
writings of physicians and anatomists; but especially from 
those parts of these writings which treat of the faculties of 
memory, attention, imagination, &c. and of mental disorders. 
It is sufficiently manifest from hence, that the perfection of our 
mental faculties depends upon the perfection of this substance; 
that all injuries done to it affect the trains of ideas proportion- 
ably; and that these cannot be restored to their natural course 
till such injuries be repaired. Poisons, spirituous liquors, opi- 
ates, fevers, blows upon the head, &c. all plainly affect the 
mind, by first disordering the medullary substance. And evac- 
uations, rest, medicines, time, &c. as plainly restore the mind 
to its former state, by reversing the foregoing steps. But there 
will be more and more definite evidence offered in the course of 
these observations. 
Prop. III. — The Sensations remain in the Mind for a short time 
after the sensible Objects are removed. 
Tuis is very evident in the sensations impressed on the eye. 
Thus, to use Sir Isaac Newton’s words, “If a burning coal be 
nimbly moved round in a circle, with gyrations continually re- 
peated, the whole circle will appear like fire; the reason of 
which is, that the sensation of the coal, in the several places of 
that circle, remains impressed on the sensorium until the coal 
return again to the same place. And so in a quick consecution 
of the colours,” (viz. red, yellow, green, blue, and purple, men- 
tioned in the experiment, whence this passage is taken,) ‘the
-P-A-G-E-340
  318 DAVID HARTLEY 
impression of every colour remains on the sensorium until a 
revolution of all the colours be completed, and that first colour 
return again. The impressions therefore of all the successive 
colours are at once in the sensorium — and beget a sensation 
of white.” Opi. b. I. p. 2. Experiment 10. 
Thus also, when a person has had a candle, a window, or any 
other lucid and well-defined object, before his eyes for a con- 
siderable time, he may perceive a very clear and precise image 
thereof to be left in the sensorium, fancy, or mind (for these I 
consider as equivalent expressions in our entrance upon these 
disquisitions,) for some time after he has closed his eyes. At 
least this will happen frequently to persons who are attentive 
to these things in a gentle way; for, as this appearance escapes 
the notice of those who are entirely inattentive, so too earnest 
a desire and attention prevents it, by introducing another state 
of mind or fancy. 
To these may be referred the appearance mentioned by Sir 
Isaac Newton, Opt. Qu. 16. viz. “When a man in the dark 
presses either corner of his eye with his finger, and turns his eye 
away from his finger, he will see a circle of colours like those in 
the feather of a peacock’s tail. And this appearance continues 
about a second of time after the eye and finger have remained 
quiet.” The sensation continues therefore in the mind about a 
second of time after its cause ceases to act. 
The same continuance of the sensations is also evident in the 
ear. For the sounds which we hear are reflected by the neigh- 
bouring bodies, and therefore consist of a variety of sounds, 
succeeding each other at different distances of time, according 
to the distances of the several reflecting bodies; which yet 
causes no confusion or apparent complexity of sound, unless the 
distance of the reflecting bodies be very considerable, as in spa- 
cious buildings. Much less are we able to distinguish the suc- 
cessive pulses of the air, even in the gravest sounds. 
As to the senses of taste and smell, there seems to be no clear 
direct evidence for the continuance of their sensations after the 
proper objects are removed. But analogy would incline one to 
believe, that they must resemble the senses of sight and hearing
-P-A-G-E-341
  OBSERVATIONS ON MAN 319 
in this particular, though the continuance cannot be perceived 
distinctly, on account of the shortness of it, or other circum- 
stances. For the sensations must be supposed to bear such an 
analogy to each other, and so to depend in common upon the 
brain, that all evidences for the continuance of sensations in 
any one sense, will extend themselves to the rest. Thus all the 
senses may be considered as so many kinds of feeling; the taste 
is nearly allied to the feeling, the smell to the taste, and the 
sight and hearing to each other. All which analogies will offer 
themselves to view when we come to examine each of these 
senses in particular. 
In the sense of feeling, the continuance of heat, after the 
heating body is removed, and that of the smart of a wound, 
after the instant of infliction, seem to be of the same kind with 
the appearances taken notice of in the eye and ear. 
But the greatest part of the sensations of this sense resemble 
those of taste and smell, and vanish to appearance as soon as 
the objects are removed. 
Prop. IV. — External Objects impressed upon the Senses occa- 
sion, first in the Nerves on which they are impressed, and then in 
the Brain, Vibrations of the small, and as one may say, infini- 
tesimal, medullary Particles. 
TueEsE vibrations are motions backwards and forwards of the 
small particles; of the same kind with the oscillations of pen- 
dulums, and the tremblings of the particles of sounding bodies. 
They must be conceived to be exceedingly short and small, so 
as not to have the least efficacy to disturb or move the whole 
bodies of the nerves or brain. For that the nerves themselves 
should vibrate like musical strings, is highly absurd; nor was it 
ever asserted by Sir Isaac Newton, or any of those who have 
embraced his notion of the performance of sensation and mo- 
tion, by means of vibrations. 
In like manner we are to suppose the particles which vibrate, 
to be of the inferior orders, and not those biggest particles, on 
which the operations in chemistry, and the colours of natural 
bodies, depend, according to the opinion of Sir Isaac Newton.
-P-A-G-E-342
320 DAVID HARTLEY 
Hence, in the proposition, I term the medullary particles, which 
vibrate, infinitesimal. i 
Now that external objects impress vibratory motions upon 
the medullary substance of the nerves and brain (which is the 
immediate instrument of sensation, according to the first pro- 
position) appears from the continuance of the sensations men- 
tioned in the third; since no motion, besides a vibratory one, 
can reside in any part for the least moment of time. External 
objects, being corporeal, can act upon the nerves and brain, 
which are also corporeal, by nothing but impressing motion on 
them. A vibrating motion may continue for a short time in the 
small medullary particles of the nerves and brain, without dis- 
turbing them, and after a short time would cease; and so would 
correspond to the above-mentioned short continuance of the 
sensations; and there seems to be no other species of motion 
that can correspond thereto. 
Cor. As this proposition is deduced from the foregoing, so 
if it could be established upon independent principles, (of 
which I shall treat under the next,) the foregoing might be de- 
duced from it. And on this supposition there would be an argu- 
ment for the continuance of the sensations, after the removal 
of their objects; which would extend to the senses of feeling, 
taste, and smell, in the same manner as to those of sight and 
hearing. 
Section II.— Or IpEAs, THEIR GENERATION AND ASSOCIA- 
TIONS; AND OF THE AGREEMENT OF THE DOCTRINE OF VI- 
BRATIONS WITH THE PHENOMENA OF IDEAS. 
Prop. VIII. — Sensations, by being often repeated, leave certain 
Vestiges, Types, or Images, of themselves, which may be called, 
Simple Ideas of Sensation. 
I rook notice in the Introduction, that those ideas which 
resemble sensations were called ideas of sensation; and also that 
they might be called simple ideas, in respect of the intellectual 
ones which are formed from them, and of whose very essence it 
is to be complex. But the ideas of sensation are not entirely
-P-A-G-E-343
  OBSERVATIONS ON MAN 321 
simple, since they must consist of parts both co-existent and 
successive, as the generating sensations themselves do. 
Now, that the simple ideas of sensation are thus generated, 
agreeably to the proposition, appears, because the most vivid 
of these ideas are those where the corresponding sensations 
are most vigorously impressed, or most frequently renewed; 
whereas if the sensation be faint, or uncommon, the generated 
idea is also faint in proportion, and, in extreme cases, evanes- 
cent and imperceptible. The exact observance of the order of 
place in visible ideas, and of the order of time in audible ones, 
may likewise serve to shew, that these ideas are copies and off- 
springs of the impressions made on the eye and ear, in which the 
same orders were observed respectively. And though it hap- 
pens, that trains of visible and audible ideas are presented in 
sallies of the fancy, and in dreams, in which the order of time 
and place is different from that of any former impressions, yet 
the small component parts of these trains are copies of former 
impressions; and reasons may be given for the varieties of their 
compositions. 
It is also to be observed, that this proposition bears a great 
resemblance to the third; and that, by this resemblance, they 
somewhat confirm and illustrate one another. According to the 
third proposition, sensations remain for a short time after the 
impression is removed; and these remaining sensations grow 
feebler and feebler, till they vanish. They are therefore, in 
some part of their declension, of about the same strength with 
ideas, and in their first state, are intermediate between sensa- 
tions and ideas. And it seems reasonable to expect, that, if a 
single sensation can leave a perceptible effect, trace, or vestige, 
for a short time, a sufficient repetition of a sensation may leave 
a perceptible effect of the same kind, but of a more permanent 
nature, i.e. an idea, which shall recur occasionally, at long 
distances of time, from the impression of the corresponding 
sensation, and vice versa. As to the occasions and causes, which 
make ideas recur, they will be considered in the next proposi- 
tion but one. 
The method of reasoning used in the last paragraph is farther
-P-A-G-E-344
  
  322 DAVID HARTLEY 
confirmed by the following circumstance; viz. that both the 
diminutive declining sensations, which remain for a short space 
after the impressions of the objects cease, and the ideas, which 
are the copies of such impressions, are far more distinct and vivid 
in respect of visible and audible impressions, than of any others. 
To which it may be added, that, after travelling, hearing music, 
&c. trains of vivid ideas are very apt to recur, which correspond 
very exactly to the late impressions, and which are of an inter- 
mediate nature between the remaining sensations of the third 
proposition, in their greatest vigour, and the ideas mentioned 
in this. 
The sensations of feeling, taste and smell, can scarce be said 
to leave ideas, unless very indistinct and obscure ones. How- 
ever, an analogy leads one to suppose that these sensations may 
leave traces of the same kind, though not in the same degree, 
as those of sight and hearing; so the readiness with which we 
reconnoitre sensations of feeling, taste, and smell, that have 
been often impressed, is an evidence that they do so; and these 
generated traces or dispositions of mind may be called the 
ideas of feeling, taste, and smell. In sleep, when all our ideas 
are magnified, those of feeling, taste, and smell, are often suffi- 
ciently vivid and distinct; and the same thing happens in some 
few cases of vigilance. 
Prop. IX. — Sensory Vibrations, by being often repeated, beget, 
in the medullary Substance of the Brain, a Disposition to 
diminutive Vibrations, which may also be called Vibratiuncles, 
and Miniatures, corresponding to themselves respectively. 
Tus correspondence of the diminutive vibrations to the 
original sensory ones, consists in this, that they agree in kind, 
place, and line of direction; and differ only in being more feeble, 
i.e. in degree, 
This proposition follows from the foregoing. For since sensa- 
tions, by being often repeated, beget ideas, it cannot but be 
that those vibrations, which accompany sensations, should be- 
get something which may accompany ideas in like manner; and 
this can be nothing but feebler vibrations, agreeing with the
-P-A-G-E-345
  OBSERVATIONS ON MAN 323 
sensory generating vibrations in kind, place, and line of 
direction. 
Or thus: By the first proposition it appears, that some motion 
must be excited in the medullary substance, during each sensa- 
tion; by the fourth, this motion is determined to be a vibratory 
one: since therefore some motion must also, by the second, be 
excited in the medullary substance during the presence of each 
idea, this motion cannot be any other than a vibratory one: else 
how should it proceed from the original vibration attending the 
sensation, in the same manner as the idea does from the sensa- 
tion itself? It must also agree in kind, place, and line of direc- 
tion, with the generating vibration. A vibratory motion, which 
recurs ¢ times in a second, cannot beget a diminutive one that 
recurs % ¢, or 2 ¢ times; nor one originally impressed on the 
region of the brain corresponding to the auditory nerves, beget 
diminutive vibrations in the region corresponding to the optic 
nerves; and so of the rest. The line of direction must likewise 
be the same in the original and derivative vibrations. It 
remains therefore, that each simple idea of sensation be at- 
tended by diminutive vibrations of the same kind, place, and 
line of direction, with the original vibrations attending the sen- 
sation itself: or, in the words of the proposition, that sensory 
vibrations, by being frequently repeated, beget a disposition to 
diminutive vibrations corresponding to themselves respect- 
ively. We may add, that the vibratory nature of the motion 
which attends ideas, may be inferred from the continuance of 
some ideas, visible ones for instance, in the fancy for a few 
moments. 
Prop. X.— Any Sensations A, B, C, &c. by being associated 
with one another a sufficient Number of Times, get such a Power 
over the corresponding Ideas a, b, c, &c. that any one of the 
Sensations A, when impressed alone, shall be able to excite in 
the Mind, b, c, &c. the Ideas of the rest. 
SENSATIONS may be said to be associated together, when 
their impressions are either made precisely at the same instant  
-P-A-G-E-346
  324 DAVID HARTLEY 
of time, or in the contiguous successive instants. We may 
therefore distinguish association into two sorts, the synchron- 
ous, and the successive. 
The influence of association over our ideas, opinions, and 
affections, is so great and obvious, as scarcely to have escaped 
the notice of any writer who has treated of these, though the 
word association, in the particular sense here affixed to it, was 
first brought into use by Mr. Locke. But all that has been 
delivered by the ancients and moderns, concerning the power 
of habit, custom, example, education, authority, party- 
prejudice, the manner of learning the manual and liberal 
arts, &c. goes upon this doctrine as its foundation, and may 
be considered as the detail of it, in various circumstances. 
I here begin with the simplest case, and shall proceed to 
more and more complex ones continually, till I have ex- 
hausted what has occurred to me upon this subject. 
This proposition, or first and simplest case of association, is 
manifest from innumerable common observations. Thus, the 
names, smells, tastes, and tangible qualities of natural bodies, 
suggest their visible appearances to the fancy, z.e. excite their 
visible ideas; and, vice versd, their visible appearances impressed 
on the eye raise up those powers of reconnoitring their names, 
smells, tastes, and tangible qualities, which may not improperly 
be called their ideas, as above noted; and in some cases raise up 
ideas, which may be compared with visible ones, in respect of 
vividness. All which is plainly owing to the association of the 
several sensible qualities of bodies with their names, and with 
each other. It is remarkable, however, as being agreeable to 
the superior vividness of visible and audible ideas, before taken 
notice of, that the suggestion of the visible appearance from the 
name is the most ready of any other; and, next to this, that of 
the name from the visible appearance; in which last case, the 
Teality of the audible idea, when not evident to the fancy, may 
be inferred from the ready pronunciation of the name. For it 
will be shewn hereafter, that the audible idea is most commonly 
a previous requisite to pronunciation. Other instances of the 
power of association may be taken from compound visible and
-P-A-G-E-347
  OBSERVATIONS ON MAN 325 
audible impressions. Thus the sight of part of a large building 
suggests the idea of the rest instantaneously; and the sound of 
the words which begin a familiar sentence, brings the remaining 
part to our memories in order, the association of the parts being 
synchronous in the first case, and successive in the last. 
It is to be observed, that, in successive associations, the power 
of raising the ideas is only exerted according to the order in 
which the association is made. Thus, if the impressions A, B,C, 
be always made in the order of the alphabet, B impressed alone 
will not raise a, but c only. Agreeably to which it is easy to 
repeat familiar sentences in the order in which they always 
occur, but impossible to do it readily in an inverted one. The 
reason of this is, that the compound idea, c, b, a, corresponds to” 
the compound sensation C, B, A; and therefore requires the im- 
pression of C, B, A, in the same manner as a, 8, c, does that of 
A, B,C. This will, however, be more evident, when we come 
to consider the associations of vibratory motions, in the next 
proposition. 
It is also to be observed, that the power of association grows 
feebler, as the number either of synchronous or successive im- 
pressions is increased, and does not extend, with due force, to 
more than a small one, in the first and simplest cases. But, in 
complex cases, or the associations of associations, of which the 
memory, in its full extent, consists, the powers of the mind, 
deducible from this source, will be found much greater than any 
person, upon his first entrance on these inquiries, could well 
imagine. 
Prop. XI. — Any Vibrations, A, B, C, &c. by being associated 
together a sufficient Number of Times, get such a Power over 
a, b, c, &c. the corresponding Miniature Vibrations, that any 
of the Vibrations A, when impressed alone, shall be able to 
excite b, c, &c. the Miniatures of the rest. 
THIS proposition may be deduced from the foregoing, in the 
same manner as the ninth has been from the eighth. 
But it seems also deducible from the nature of vibrations, 
and of an animal body. Let A and B be two vibrations, asso-
-P-A-G-E-348
  326 DAVID HARTLEY 
ciated synchronically. Now, it is evident, that the vibration A 
(for I will, in this propcsition, speak of A and B in the singular 
number, for the sake of greater clearness) will, by endeavouring 
to diffuse itself into those parts of the medullary substance which 
are affected primarily by the vibration B, in some measure 
modify and change B, soas to make B a little different from what 
it would be, if impressed alone. For the same reasons the vibra- 
tion A will be a little affected, even in its primary seat, by the 
endeavour of B to diffuse itself all over the medullary sub- 
stance. Suppose now the vibrations A and B to be impressed at 
the same instant, for a thousand times; it follows, from the 
ninth proposition, that they will first overcome the disposition 
to the natural vibrations WV, and then leave a tendency to them- 
selves, which will now occupy the place of the original natural 
tendency to vibrations. When therefore the vibration A is im- 
pressed alone, it cannot be entirely such as the object would 
excite of itself, but must lean, even in its primary seat, to the 
modifications and changes induced by B, during their thousand 
joint impressions; and therefore much more, in receding from 
this primary seat, will it lean that way; and when it comes to 
the seat of B, it will excite B’s miniature a little modified 
and changed by itself. 
Or thus: When A is impressed alone, some vibration must 
take place in the primary seat of B, both on account of the heat 
and pulsation of the arteries, and because A will endeavour to 
diffuse itself over the whole medullary substance. This cannot 
be that part of the natural vibrations NV, which belongs to this 
region, because it is supposed to be overruled already. It can- 
not be that which A impressed alone would have propagated 
this region, because that has always hitherto been overruled, 
and converted into B; and therefore cannot have begotten a 
tendency to itself. It cannot be any full vivid vibration, such 
as B, C, D, &c. belonging to this region, because all full vibra- 
tions require the actual impression of an object upon the corre- 
sponding external organ. And of miniature vibrations belong- 
ing to this region, such as b, c, d, &c. it is evident, that has the 
preference, since A leans to it a little, even in its own primary
-P-A-G-E-349
  
OBSERVATIONS ON MAN 327 
seat, more and more, in receding from this, and almost entirely, 
when it comes to the primary seat of B. For the same reasons 
B impressed alone will excite a; and, in general, if A, B, C, &c. 
be vibrations synchronically impressed on different regions of 
the medullary substance, A impressed alone will at last excite 
b, c, &c. according to the proposition. 
If A and B be vibrations impressed successively, then will the 
latter part of A, vz. that part which, according to the third and 
fourth propositions, remains, after the impression of the object 
ceases, be modified and altered by B, at the same time that it 
will a little modify and alter it, till at last it be quite over- 
powered by it, and end in it. It follows therefore, by a like 
method of reasoning, that the successive impression of A and B, 
sufficiently repeated, will so alter the medullary substance, as 
that when A is impressed alone, its latter part shall be not such 
as the sole impression of A requires, but lean towards B, and 
end in 0 at last. But B will not excite a in a retrograde order; 
since, by supposition, the latter part of B was not modified and 
altered by A, but by some other vibration, such as C or D. And 
as B, by being followed by C, may at last raise c; so b, when 
raised by A, in the method here proposed, may be also suffi- 
cient to raise c; inasmuch as the miniature c being a feeble mo- 
tion, not stronger, perhaps, than the natural vibrations NV, 
requires only to have its kind, place, and line of direction, de- 
termined by association, the heat and arterial pulsation con- 
veying to it the requisite degree of strength. And thus A im- 
pressed alone will raise b, c, &c. in successive associations, 
as well as in synchronous ones, according to the proposi- 
tion. 
It seems also, that the influence of A may, in some degree, 
reach through B to C; so that A of itself may have some effect 
to raise c, as well as by means of 6. However, it is evident, that 
this chain must break off, at last, in long successions; and that 
sooner or later, according to the number and vigour of the 
repeated impressions. The power of miniature vibrations to 
raise other miniatures may, perhaps, be made clearer to mathe- 
maticians, by hinting, that the efficacy of any vibration to raise 
       
-P-A-G-E-350
    328 DAVID HARTLEY 
any other, is not in the simple ratio of its vividness, but as some 
power thereof less than unity; for thus 6 may raise c, a weaker 
vibration than 8, c may raise d, &c. with more facility than if 
the efficacy was in the simple ratio of the vividness, and yet so 
that the series shall break off at last. 
If the ninth proposition be allowed, we may prove this in 
somewhat a shorter and easier manner, as follows. Since the 
vibrations A and B are impressed together, they must, from the 
diffusion necessary to vibratory motions, run into one vibration; 
and consequently, after a number of impressions sufficiently 
repeated, will leave a trace, or miniature, of themselves, as one 
vibration, which will recur every now and them, from slight 
causes. Much rather, therefore, may the part 6 of the com- 
pound miniature a+ recur, when the part A of the compound 
original vibration A+B is impressed. 
And as the ninth proposition may be thus made to prove the 
present, so it ought to be acknowledged and remarked here, 
that unless the ninth be allowed, the present cannot be proved, 
or that the power of association is founded upon, and necessa- 
rily requires, the previous power of forming ideas, and miniature 
vibrations. For ideas, the miniature vibrations, must first be 
generated, according to the eighth and ninth propositions, 
before they can be associated, according to the tenth and this 
eleventh. But then (which is very remarkable) this power of 
forming ideas, and their corresponding miniature vibrations, 
does equally presuppose the power of association. For since all 
sensations and vibrations are infinitely divisible, in respect of 
time and place, they could not leave any traces or images of 
themselves, i.e. any ideas, or miniature vibrations, unless their 
infinitesimal parts did cohere together through joint impres- 
sion, 7.e. association. Thus, to mention a gross instance, we 
could have no proper idea of a horse, unless the particular ideas 
of the head, neck, body, legs, and tail, peculiar to this animal, 
stuck to each other in the fancy, from frequent joint impres- 
sion. And, therefore, in dreams, where complex associations are 
much weakened, and various parcels of visible ideas, not joined 
in nature, start up together in the fancy, contiguous to each
-P-A-G-E-351
  OBSERVATIONS ON MAN 329 
other, we often see monsters, chimeras, and combinations, 
which have never been actually presented. 
Prop. XII.— Simple Ideas will run into complex ones, by 
Means of Association. 
In order to explain and prove this proposition, it will be 
requisite to give some previous account of the manner in 
which simple ideas of sensation may be associated together. 
Case 1. Let the sensation A be often associated with each of 
the sensations B, C, D, &c. i.e. at certain times with B, at cer- 
tain other times with C, &c. it is evident, from the tenth propo- 
sition, that A, impressed alone, will, at last, raise }, c, d, &c. all 
together, i.e. associate them with one another, provided they 
belong to different regions of the medullary substance; for if 
any two, or more, belong to the same region, since they cannot 
exist together in their distinct forms, A will raise something 
intermediate between them. 
Case 2. If the sensations A, B, C, D, &c. be associated to- 
gether, according to various combinations of twos, or even 
threes, fours, &c. then will A raise b, c, d, &c. also B raise a, c, d, 
&c. as in case the first. 
It may happen, indeed, in both cases, that A may raise a par- 
ticular miniature, as b, preferably to any of the rest, from its 
being more associated with B, from the novelty of the impres- 
sion of B, from a tendency in the medullary substance to favour 
6, &c. and in like manner, that 6 may raise c or d preferably to 
the rest. However, all this will be overruled, at last, by the 
recurrency of the associations; so that any one of the sensations 
will excite the ideas of the rest at the same instant, .e. associate 
them together. 
Case 3. Let A, B, C, D, &c. represent successive impressions, 
it follows from the tenth and eleventh propositions, that A will 
raise b, c, d, &c. B raise c, d, &c. And though the ideas do not, 
in this case, rise precisely at the same instant, yet they come 
nearer together than the sensations themselves did in their 
original impression; so that these ideas are associated almost  
-P-A-G-E-352
    330 DAVID HARTLEY 
synchronically at last, and successively from the first. The 
ideas come nearer to one another than the sensations, on ac- 
count of their diminutive nature, by which all that appertains 
to them is contracted. And this seems to be as agreeable to 
observation as to theory. 
Case 4. All compound impressions A+B+C+D, &c. after 
sufficient repetition leave compound miniatures at+b+c+d, 
&c. which recur every now and then from slight causes, as well 
such as depend on association, as some which are different from 
it. Now, in these recurrences of compound miniatures, the 
parts are farther associated, and approach perpetually nearer 
to each other, agreeably to what was just now observed; i.e. the 
association becomes perpetually more close and intimate. 
Case 5. When the ideas a, b, c, d, &c. have been sufficiently 
associated in any one or more of the foregoing ways, if we sup- 
pose any single idea of these, a for instance, to be raised by the 
tendency of the medullary substance that way, by the associa- 
tion of A with a foreign sensation or idea X or «, &c. this idea a, 
thus raised, will frequently bring in all the rest, 6, c, d, &c. and 
so associate all of them together still farther. 
And upon the whole, it may appear to the reader, that the 
simple ideas of sensation must run into clusters and combina- 
tions, by associations; and that each of these will, at last, coal- 
esce into one complex idea, by the approach and commixture 
of the several compounding parts. 
It appears also from observation, that many of our intel- 
lectual ideas, such as those that belong to the heads of beauty, 
honour, moral qualities, &c. are, in fact, thus composed of 
parts, which, by degrees, coalesce into one complex idea.

(1720-1793) 
ABSTRACT OF THE ANALYTICAL ESSAY 
UPON THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL 
Translated from the French* by 
BENJAMIN RAND 
I. The senses the first source of our ideas 
I HAVE set out from a well known and indubitable fact, and 
one which no person will venture to deny. It is that one born 
blind can never acquire our ideas of light and colors.! His soul 
has however the same faculties as ours. What then does he 
lack in order to have these visual sensations ? — the organ 
suitable to these sensations. 
Suppose the person born blind were at the same time born 
deaf, and had also from his birth been deprived of the senses of 
touch, taste, and smell. I ask what ideas his soul would be able 
to acquire? 
The reply will possibly be made to me as it already has been, 
that it would have at least the consciousness of its existence. 
But how do we acquire the consciousness of our own existence? 
Is it not by reflecting upon our own sensations? Or at least are 
not our first sensations united to that consciousness, which 
our soul always has that it is itself which experiences them? 
And is this consciousness anything else than that of its exist- 
ence? But how could a soul which has never had a sensation 
know that it exists? 
It would not be well to admit here a certain confused con- 
sciousness of existence of which we could not form any idea. It

is better doubtless to receive only clear things and those about 
which one can reason. The present thought cannot constitute 
the essence of the soul. What would constitute it, at least 
partly, would be rather the capacity for thoughts (cogitabilité). 
II. Reflection, the second source of our ideas 
I HAVE thus supposed as a principle that all our ideasare 
derived originally from the senses. I have not said that our 
ideas are purely sensory. I have shown very clearly and in great 
detail, how reflection aided by the different kinds of signs rises 
by degrees from sensations to the most abstract conceptions.’ I 
have sufficiently investigated the theory of abstractions, and 
have traced in general that of ideas.” 
III. The union of soul and body and its law 
TuE objects themselves or the corpuscles which emanate 
from them act upon the senses only by impulsion. They com- 
municate to them a certain shock, which is transmitted to 
the brain, and the soul experiences sensations. 
The philosopher does not investigate how the movement of a 
nerve causes an idea to arise in the soul. He simply admits the 
fact and readily renounces the attempt of discovering the cause. 
He knows that it springs from the mystery of the union of two 
substances, and that this mystery is for him inscrutable. 
It suffices for him to know that to the disturbance of this or 
that nerve there always corresponds in the soul this or that 
sensation. He does not regard the sensation as the physical 
and immediate effect of the movement of the nerve, but as the 
inseparable sequence of that movement. He regards this move- 
ment as in some sort a natural sign of the sensation by divine 
establishment. 
IV. Man a composite being 
I navE not affirmed that it is impossible for the soul to think 
without a body. There perhaps exist pure spirits which have 
ideas; but I am profoundly ignorant how they have them.

-P-A-G-E-355
  THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL 333 
I know only that the feeling that I have of my ego is always 
one, simple, indivisible; from which I infer that I am not 
wholly material. I have very much amplified this excellent 
proof. I admit then the existence of my soul as that of an 
immaterial substance, which it has pleased the Creator to unite 
to an organised body. I learn from the contemplation of my 
being, that I result from the union of two very different sub- 
stances. 
In this order of things I perceive that I have ideas only by 
the intervention of my body, and the more I reflect upon my- 
self, the more I am compelled to recognise the great influence 
of the machine! upon all the operations of my soul. 
I learn also from revelation that my soul will be eternally 
joined to a portion of matter. I shall therefore be eternally a 
composite being. 
The purpose of the author of my being has therefore not been 
that I should be a pure spirit. He has consequently willed that 
my soul should use its faculties only by means of a body. If he 
had willed otherwise I should have philosophized differently, 
because I should have had another way of perceiving and 
judging. 
I have thus followed in my researches upon the economy of 
our being the course which has appeared to me most to conform 
to that of nature. My soul has no hold upon itself; it cannot see 
itself, and it cannot feel itself; but it sees, and it feels bodies, by 
the aid of the body to which it is united. 
Its senses place it in relation with everything about it; 
through them it is related to all parts of the universe; by 
them it appropriates in some fashion all of nature, and even 
reascends to its divine author. 
V. The objects of our sensations real 
I studied then the constitution of my senses, which are the 
universal instruments of the operations of my soul. I gave 
attentive heed to everything that takes place in them when 
objects happen to strike them. I meditated upon the effects of 
1 The group of organs which constitute the body of man.
-P-A-G-E-356
  334 CHARLES BONNET 
those shocks, and upon the relationship that the fibres, which 
are the seat of them, sustain with one another, and on the most 
immediate consequences of these relationships. 
As I was assured that my soul experiences no modification, 
except upon occasion of something which happens to and 
through its senses to that part of the brain which is the imme- 
diate seat of feeling and of thought, I considered the play and 
modifications of the sensory fibres as a sort of representation of 
the corresponding modifications of my soul. 
It is of very little importance for my purpose that I do not 
err about the existence of bodies. Although the whole material 
system should be only a phenomenon, a pure appearance, rela- 
tive to my manner of perceiving and of judging, I should none 
the less distinguish my sensations from one another. I would 
not be the less assured that some are in my power, and that 
others are not at all. I would also be none the less certain that 
there exists apart from my soul something which excites in it 
sensations independent of its will. That thing, whatever it may 
be, is what I term matter. 
Ido not affirm that matter is in effect what it seems to me to 
be; but I can reasonably affirm, that what seems to be results 
essentially, both from that which it is itself, as well as from what 
I am by reference to it. Beings which observe it under other 
relationships than mine are of a different nature from mine. I 
would see myself under other relationships, if my nature hap- 
pened to change. 
It would also be wholly indifferent to the purpose of my 
researches to discuss the different hypotheses which have been 
made in order to explain the union of the soul and of the body, 
since all such hypotheses equally suppose a constant relation- 
ship between the modifications of the soul and the movements 
of the body. 
It was necessary then always to devote one’s attention to the 
play of the organs. It is fully permitted afterward to translate 
every reasoning into the special language of the hypothesis 
that has been adopted. I have confined myself to physical in- 
Sluence, not as a fact, but as that which seems to be.

THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL — 335 
VI. Specific differences of the sensory fibres 
EACH sense has its mechanics, its manner of action, its end. 
Each sense transmits to the soul a multitude of different im- 
pressions to which correspond a like number of different sen- 
sations. 
It was not possible for me to conceive of fibres perfectly 
similar being capable of receiving and transmitting without 
confusion so many diverse impressions. It has seemed to me, 
that each sensory fibre would in such a case be like a body 
impelled at the same time by several forces acting in different 
directions. This body would thereby receive a composite move- 
ment which would be the product of those forces, and which 
would represent none of those forces in particular. 
In assuming this point of view I have not been able to render 
an account to myself of the difference in my sensations. I have, 
therefore, been compelled to suppose that there is in each sense 
certain fibres appropriate to each kind of sensation. 
I believe that I have discerned in the organisation of the 
senses peculiarities which justify my supposition, and I have 
indicated them.1 The observations upon the difference of 
refrangability of colored rays,and upon those of the vibrations 
of strings of musical instruments, have appeared to me to add 
an additional degree of probability to that conjecture. 
VII. The physics of reminiscence 
But my soul is not limited to feeling through the agency of 
my senses. It has likewise recollection of that which it has felt. 
It has the consciousness of the newness of a sensation. A sensa- 
tion which has been presented to it many times does not affect 
it precisely as at the first time. 
It is always through the senses that objects come to the soul. 
Those fibres which have been shocked many times cannot be 
precisely in the state in which they were before they had been 
disturbed. The repeated action of the object must change 
them in some respect. 
If a particular kind of sensation has been associated with a 
1 Chap. vu. 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
336 CHARLES BONNET 
special kind of fibre, the recollection of the sensation, or the 
reminiscence, may have been associated with the present state 
of the fibre. I have thus conjectured that the virgin fibres do 
not affect the soul precisely as those do which are not so, and I 
have attributed the feeling of novelty to that state of virginity 
of the sensory fibres. 
By virtue of the union of the two substances nothing can take 
place in the soul without something in the body correspond- 
ing to it. It is this something which I have always sought, 
though I do not flatter myself to have always encountered, 
and that very often I have only caught a glimpse of it. 
VIII. The action of the soul upon the Senses indicated by the 
nature and effects of the attention 
My soul has a will, and exerts it. It has certain desires, and 
is active. This activity, whatever may be its nature, must have 
a subject on which it displays itself. It has not been possible 
for me to discover for it any other than the sensory fibres. I 
have therefore thought that as the senses act upon the soul, so 
the soul may act in its turn upon the senses. 
I have not said that the soul acts after the manner of the 
body, as it is not body; but I have said that the effect of its 
action corresponds to that of a body. In one word I have 
admitted, that the soul causes the sensory fibres to vibrate at 
its pleasure, and I have not undertaken to investigate the man- 
ner of it. 
Divers facts have appeared to me to establish that motive 
power of the soul, and in particular the exercise of attention. 
When it is too long continued, it gives rise in the soul to that 
uncomfortable feeling, which we express by the term fatigue. 
Strictly speaking can fatigue have its seat anywhere else 
than in the organs? And is it not the soul itself, which occasions 
fatigue, by an act of its will? If it did not will to be atten- 
tive, it would not experience any fatigue. It acts, therefore, 
upon the fibres which are the seat of this fatigue. 
If the fatigue ceases when the soul changes its object, that is 
1 Chap. x,
-P-A-G-E-359
  
THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL = 337 
because it is acting upon other fibres. For we have seen, that 
it is probable, that every object has in the brain certain fibres 
which are adapted to it. 
It is by the aid of these principles that I, cen the first, 
have attempted to analyze the nature, and the effects of atten- 
tion, and to prove that it is this valuable faculty which estab- 
lishes the most difference between one man and another.* 
Excellent rules have been given us for directing and fixing 
the attention; but sufficient investigation has not been made of 
the physical foundation of these rules. You will never succeed 
better in guiding man, than when you set out from the physical 
constitution. It is always through the physical that you must 
pass to reach the soul. 
IX. The physics of the imagination and of the memory 
Tue ideas that objects excite in the soul can be recalled by 
it without the intervention of objects. This reproduction of 
ideas is due to imagination, and to memory. I have sought to 
investigate how they operate, or what is the same thing, wherein 
consists the physics of the imagination, and of the memory.” 
The method, that I have followed to succeed, has seemed to 
me very simple and sufficiently luminous. It is the same that 
I have pursued in all my psychological researches. I have at. 
first directed my attention to what has immediately preceded. 
Before investigating how an idea is reproduced, I have investi- 
gated how it was produced. 
I have clearly seen that the soul never has a new sensation, 
except through the medium of the senses. It is to the shock of 
certain fibres that such sensation has been originally as- 
sociated. Its reproduction or its recall by imagination will still 
be related to the shock of these same fibres. 
Accidents, which can effect only the body, enfeeble and even 
destroy the imagination and the memory. They have therefore 
their seat in the body. And how could this seat be anything else 
than the organs which transmit to the soul all outer impressions.

338 CHARLES BONNET 
It is therefore my belief that the sensory fibres are constituted 
in such a manner, that the action more or less continued of the 
objects produges on them determinations more or less durable, 
which constitute the physics of memory. 
I have never been able to say what these determinations are, 
because the structure of the sensory fibres is to me unknown. 
But if sense has its mechanics, I have thought that every kind 
of sensory fibre can also have its own. 
X. Important remarks upon the sensory fibres 
I HAVE thus regarded each sensory fibre as a very small 
organ, which has its own functions, or as a very small machine, 
which the action of the objects keys to the tone which is 
adapted to it. I have judged that the play or the conduct of the 
fibre must result essentially from its primordial structure, and 
this latter from the nature and arrangement of the elements. 
It is impossible for me to represent these elements as of the 
nature of simple bodies. I have regarded them as constituent 
parts of a small organ, or as the different parts of a small 
machine, designed to receive, to transmit, and to reproduce the 
impression of the object to which it has been adapted. 
I have therefore supposed that every kind of sensory fibre 
has been originally patterned upon relationships that are 
adapted to the manner of acting of its object. 
| This supposition has not appeared to me gratuitous. If the 
eye does not act as the ear, it is because its structure is essen- 
tially different, because light does not act like sound. The 
fibres appropriate to different visual sensations have therefore 
probably another structure than that of fibres adapted to per- 
ceptions of hearing. 
Nay more: each perception has its peculiar character which 
makes us distinguish it from every other. For example, every 
colored ray has an essence which is unchangeable. A red ray 
for instance does not act precisely as a blue ray. There are con- 
sequently still among the fibres of vision certain differences 
corresponding to those which exist among the rays. 
I have not simply admitted that the fibres of sight are finer
-P-A-G-E-361
THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL = 339 
than those of hearing; that the vibrations of one are more 
prompt than those of the other; and that among the fibres of 
sight those which are adapted to the action of red rays are less’ 
fine than those which are suited to the action of blue rays. This 
does not appear to me sufficient to render an account of the 
phenomena of memory. 
I have indeed surmised that oscillations more or less rapid, 
or other analogous movements, might perhaps suffice to 
characterize the kind of sensation. I have not, however, under- 
stood that they can at the same time serve to recall to the soul 
the memory of the sensation. It has seemed to me that since 
this memory is connected with the body, it must depend upon 
some change which happened to the primitive state of the 
sensory fibres through the action of objects. 
I have, therefore, admitted as probable that the state of the 
fibres upon which an object has acted, is not precisely the same 
after that action, as it was before. I have conjectured that the 
sensory fibres thus experience modifications more or less dur- 
able, which constitutes the physics of recollection, and of 
memory. 
I have not undertaken to determine in what these modifica- 
tions consist. I know no fact which could throw light upon this 
obscure point. But having regarded the sensory fibres as very 
small organs, it has not been difficult for me to conceive that 
the constituent parts of these organs may assume with reference 
to one another new positions, or new relationships, to which 
was attached the physics of memory. 
This is the result of habit, of which so much is said, which 
has so great an influence in human life, and of which I am not 
aware that anyone has well developed the principle. I have 
endeavored to explain how it is formed, rooted, weakened, and 
obliterated.” 
Thave said on that occasion, ‘‘ not only does the fibre transmit 
to the soul the impression of the object, but it recalls to it 
furthermore the recollection of this impression. This remem- 
* Chap. vu, § 57, 58, 59. ? Chap. Ix, p. 96, 97, etc.; chap. Xx, p. 641, 642, etc.
-P-A-G-E-362
  340 CHARLES BONNET 
brance differs from the sensation itself only in the degree of its 
intensity. It has therefore the same origin. It depends then as 
the sensation itself upon a movement which is aroused in the 
fibre; but on a weaker movement. 
The carrying out of this movement requires a certain dispo- 
sition in the integral parts of the fibre. The elements, therefore, 
retain during a period of more or less length, the determinations 
which they have received from the action of the object. It 
keys up, so to speak, the fibre to its own tone, and while the 
fibre remains keyed up in this way, it preserves the power of 
recalling to the soul the memory of the sensation of the object.” 
I added finally: “It is necessary therefore to regard the 
fibre as a very small machine designed to produce a certain 
movement. The capacity of this small machine to carry out 
that movement depends originally upon its construction; and 
that construction differentiates it from every other machine of 
the same sort. The action of the object makes this capacity 
active. It is that action which keys up the machine. As soon as 
it is keyed up it plays at the moment that some impulse 
occurs.” 
For the rest, the reader ought not to have much difficulty in 
understanding, how nature has been able to vary sufficiently 
the structure of sensory fibres to provide for that prodigious 
diversity of perceptions which weexperience. Howmuchhuman 
art, so crude, so imperfect, so limited, varies its productions of 
the same kind! How many different forms has it not been able 
to give toa chain! What variety has it not put among the links 
of different chains! Of how many combinations are not the 
same elements susceptible! And how will it be when we suppose 
' the elements have been themselves diversified!

CHAPTER I. THE FIRST NOTIONS OF A MAN 
POSSESSING THE SENSE OF SMELL ONLY 
1. Tue notions of our statue being limited to the sense of 
smell, can include odours only. It cannot have any conception 
of extent, of form, of anything external to itself, or to its sensa- 
tions, any more than it can have of colour, sound or taste. 
2. If we offer the statue a rose, it will be, in its relation to us, 
a statue which smells a rose; but in relation to itself, it will be 
merely the scent itself of the flower. 
Therefore, according to the objects which act upon its organ, 
it will be scent of rose, of carnation, of jasmine, of violet. In a 
word, odours are, in this respect, merely modifications of the 
statue itself or modes of being; and it is not capable of believ- 
ing itself aught else, since these are the only sensations it can 
fecl. 
3. Let those philosophers to whom it is so evident that every- 
thing is material, put themselves for a moment in the place of 
the statue, and let them reflect how they could suspect that there 
exists anything resembling what we call matter. 
4. We may then already be convinced that it is sufficient to 
increase or to diminish the number of the senses to cause us to 
come to conclusions wholly different from those which are at 
present so natural to us, and our statue, limited to the sense of 
smell, may thus enable us to comprehend somewhat the class 
of beings whose notions are the most restricted.

CHAPTER II. OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE 
MIND IN A MAN LIMITED TO THE SENSE OF 
SMELL, AND OF THE FACT THAT THE DIF- 
FERENT DEGREES OF PLEASURE AND OF PAIN 
CONSTITUTE THE PRINCIPLE OF THESE OP- 
ERATIONS. 
1. With the first odour the capacity for feeling of our statue 
is wholly taken up by the impression made upon its organ. I 
call this attention. 
2. From that moment it begins to enjoy or to suffer: for if the 
power of feeling is wholly devoted to a pleasant odour, enjoy- 
ment is the result; and if it be wholly devoted to an unpleasant 
odour, suffering results. 
3- But our statue has yet no idea of the different changes it 
may experience. Therefore it is well; or it is not well, without 
the desire to be better. Suffering is no more capable of exciting 
in the statue a longing for an enjoyment of which it has no know- 
ledge, than enjoyment is capable of making it fear an ill of which 
it is equally ignorant. Consequently, no matter how disagree- 
able the first sensation may be, even to the point of wounding 
the organ and of being a violent pain, it cannot cause desire. 
While suffering with us is always accompanied by the desire 
not to suffer, it cannot be so with the statue. Pain creates that 
desire in us only because the condition of non-suffering is al- 
ready known to us. The habit we have contracted of looking 
upon pain as a thing we have been without and of which we may 
be freed, is the cause that the moment we suffer we immediately 
desire not to suffer, and this condition is inseparable from a 
state of suffering. 
But the statue which, at the first moment, is conscious of its 
feeling only through the very pain it experiences, does not know 
whether it can cease to be a statue and become something 
else, or cease to exist. It has, as yet, no conception of change, 
of succession or of duration. Therefore it exists without having 
the power to form a desire.
-P-A-G-E-365
TREATISE ON SENSATIONS 343 
4. Once it has observed that it is capable of ceasing to be 
what it is, in order to become once more what it was before, we 
shall see its desires spring from a condition of pain, which it 
will compare with a condition of pleasure recalled to it by mem- 
ory. Thus it is that pleasure and pain are the sole principle 
which, determining all the operations of its soul, will gradually 
raise it to all the knowledge of which it is capable; and in order 
to determine the progress of which it is susceptible, it will suffice 
to observe the pleasure it will have to desire, the pains it will 
have to fear, and the influence of either according to circum- 
stances. 
5. Supposing the statue to have no remembrance of the 
changes it has undergone, then on every occasion of a change 
it would believe itself to be conscious of sensation for the first 
time: whole years would be swallowed up in each present mo- 
ment. Therefore by ever confining its attention to a single mode 
of being, it would never reckon two together, and would never 
note their relations to each other: it would enjoy or suffer, with- 
out yet knowing desire or fear. 
6. But the odour it smells does not, so soon as the odoriferous 
object ceases to act upon its organ, become wholly lost to the 
statue. The attention it bestowed upon it still retains the odour, 
and there remains a more or less strong impression of that odour 
in proportion as the attention itself has been more or less active. 
That is memory. 
7. When, therefore, our statue is a new odour, there is still 
present to it the odour that it was the moment before. Its power 
of feeling is divided between memory and the sense of smell, 
the former of these faculties being attentive to the past sensation, 
while the latter is attentive to the present sensation. 
8. Thus there are in the statue two modes of feeling, differ- 
ing only in this, that the one is concerned with a present sensa- 
tion and the other with a sensation no longer existent, but the 
impression of which still remains. Unaware of the fact that there 
are objects which act upon it, unaware even of the fact that it 
possesses an organ, the statue ordinarily distinguishes between 
the remembrance of a sensation and 2 present sensation merely
-P-A-G-E-366
  344 CONDILLAC 
by dimly feeling what it has been and feeling strongly what it is 
at the moment. 
g. I say ordinarily, because remembrance will not always be 
a faint sentiment, nor sensation a lively one. For every time 
that memory recalls very strongly these states of being, while, 
on the contrary, the organ itself receives but slight impressions, 
the consciousness of a present sensation will be much less vivid 
than the remembrance of a sensation which has ceased to be. 
1o. As, therefore, one odour is present to the sense of smell 
through the impression made by an odoriferous body upon the 
organ itself, so is another odour present in the memory, because 
the impression made by another odoriferous body continues in 
the brain, to which the organ of smell has transmitted it. Pass- 
ing thus through two states of being, the statue feels that it is 
no longer what it has been: the knowledge of this change causes 
it to refer the first state to a different moment from that in which 
it experiences the second state, and this it is which causes the 
statue to make a distinction between existing in one way and 
having existed in another way. 
11. The statue is active in relation to one of its two modes of 
feeling, and passive in relation to the other. It is active when it 
remembers a sensation, because it has within itself the cause 
which brings about that recollection, that is memory. It is 
passive at the moment when it experiences a sensation, because 
the cause which produces it is external to the statue itself, that 
is, it lies in the odoriferous bodies which act upon its sense of 
smell. 
12. But, unable even to suspect the action upon itself of ob- 
jects external to it, it cannot distinguish between a cause within 
itself and a cause outside of itself. As far as the statue is con- 
cerned all the modifications of its state of being appear to it due 
to itself, and whether it experiences a sensation or merely recalls 
one, it is never aware of aught save that it is or has been in such 
and such a state of being. It cannot, therefore, observe any 
difference between the condition in which it is itself active or 
that in which it is wholly passive. 
13. Nevertheless the more numerous the occasions for the
-P-A-G-E-367
  TREATISE ON SENSATIONS 345 
exercise of the memory the more readily will the memory act. 
And it is in this way that the statue will acquire the habit of re- 
calling without an effort the changes through which it has passed, 
and of dividing its attention between what it has been and what 
it is. For habit is merely the facility of repeating what one has 
done, and that facility is acquired by the reiteration of the ac- 
tions. 
14. If, after having repeatedly smelled a rose and a carnation, 
the statue once more smells a rose, the passive attention, acting 
by the sense of smell, will be wholly given up to the present odour 
of the rose, and the active attention, which acts through the 
memory, will be divided between the remains of the scents of 
the rose and of the carnation. Now these two states of being 
cannot share the capacity for feeling without comparing them- 
selves one with the other, for comparing is nothing else than 
bestowing one’s attention upon two ideas at the same time. 
15. From the moment that comparison exists, judgment exists. 
Our statue cannot at one and the same time be attentive to the 
scent of the rose and that of the carnation, without perceiving 
that the one is not the same as the other, and it cannot be atten- 
tive to the odour of a rose which it smells and to that of a rose 
which it has previously smelled without perceiving that they are a 
similar modification. Judgment, therefore, is simply the percep- 
tion of the relation between two ideas which are being compared. 
16. As the comparisons and conclusions become more fre- 
quent the statue acquires greater facility in making them. It 
contracts therefore the habit of comparing and judging. Con- 
sequently it will be sufficient to make it smell other odours in 
order to cause it to make additional comparisons, come to ad- 
ditional conclusions and contract new habits. 
17. The first scnsation it experiences causes no surprise to 
the statue, for it is as yet unaccustomed to form any kind of 
judgment, nor is it surprised when, on smelling successively 
different odours, it perceives each but for a moment. Under 
these conditions it does not abide by any conclusion it has formed, 
and the more the statue changes the more it feels itself naturally 
inclined to change.
-P-A-G-E-368
  
  346 CONDILLAC 
Nor will it feel any more surprise if we lead it, by unnotice- 
able gradations, from the habit of believing itself one odour to 
the conclusion that it is another odour, for the statue changes 
without having the power of noticing the change. 
But it cannot fail to be surprised if it passes suddenly from a 
condition to which it was accustomed to a totally different state 
of which it had no previous conception. 
18. This amazement causes it to feel more distinctly the differ- 
ences between its modes of being. The more abrupt the change 
from one to the other the greater the astonishment of the statue, 
and the more is it struck by the contrast between the pleasures 
and the pains which mark these changes. Its attention, excited 
by pains which are more keenly felt, applies itself with greater 
acuteness to the sensations which succeed each other. It there- 
fore compares them more carefully; it judges more accurately 
their relations to each other. Amazement consequently increases 
the activity of the operations of its mind. But, because it is 
by bringing out a more marked opposition between feelings of 
pleasure and feelings of pain that amazement thus increases 
activity of mind, it follows that it is always pleasure and pain 
which are the primary motive cause of its faculties. 
1g. If each successive odour acts with equal force upon the 
statue’s attention, the memory will remember them in the order 
in which they followed each other, and they will by this means 
become connected one with another. 
If the series is numerous, the impression made by the most 
recent odours, being the most recent, will be the strongest; the 
impression made by the first in order will be imperceptibly 
weakened, then disappear altogether, and these sensations will 
be as if they had never been. 
But if there be any which have acted but slightly upon the 
attention, they will leave no impression behind them and will 
be forgotten as soon as they have been perceived. 
Finally the impressions which will have more vividly struck 
the attention, will be more vividly recalled, and will so strongly 
engage it that they will be capable of making it forget the others. 
20. Memory therefore is a series of ideas forming a sort of
-P-A-G-E-369
TREATISE ON SENSATIONS 347 
chain. It is this connection which enables us to pass from one 
idea to another, and to recall the most distant. Therefore we 
remember an idea that we had some time since only because 
we recall, more or less rapidly, the intermediary ideas. 
21. In the case of the second sensation our statue experiences, 
it has not to make any selection: it can remember but the first 
sensation. It will merely act more or less vigorously, according 
as it is inclined thereto by the intensity of the pleasure or the 
pain. 
But when there has been a succession of changes, the statue, 
having a great number in remembrance, will be inclined to re- 
call preferably those which can best contribute to its happiness, 
passing rapidly over the others or dwelling on them only in spite 
of itself. 
To make this truth fully plain it is necessary to know the 
different degrees of pain and of pleasure of which we are suscep- 
tible, and the comparisons which may be drawn between them. 
22. Pleasures and pains are of two kinds. Some pertain more 
especially to the body: they are of the senses; others are within 
the memory and all the faculties of the. soul: these are intellectual 
or spiritual. But this is a difference which the statue is incapable 
of observing. 
This inability preserves it from an error which we find it diffi- 
cult to avoid, seeing that these sentiments do not differ one from 
another as greatly as we imagine. In truth, they are all intellect- 
ual and spiritual, since it is the soul only which is capable of 
feeling. It may be said also that they are all likewise in a certain 
sense sensible or corporeal, since the body is their sole occasion- 
ing cause. It is only with reference to their relation to the facul- 
ties of the body or those of the soul that we divide them into two 
kinds. 
23. Pleasure may diminish or increase by degrees; when it 
diminishes, it tends to disappear, and it vanishes with the sensa- 
tion. On the contrary, when it increases, it may attain to pain, 
because the impression becomes too strong for the organ. Thus 
there are two extreme points in pleasure: the weaker is that in 
which sensation begins with the least power; it is the first step
-P-A-G-E-370
  348 CONDILLAC 
from nothingness to feeling; the strongest is that when the sen- 
sation cannot augment without ceasing to be agreeable; it is the 
condition nearest to pain. 
The impression of a faint pleasure seems to become concen- 
trated in the organ which transmits it to the soul. But when it 
has a certain amount of intensity, it is accompanied by an emo- 
tion which spreads throughout the whole body. This emotion is 
a fact which our experience places beyond the shadow of a doubt. 
Pain, likewise, may increase or diminish. When it increases 
it tends to the total destruction of the animal; but, when it dimin- 
ishes, it does not, like pleasure, tend to the privation of all sense 
of feeling; on the contrary, the moment which puts an end to it 
is always pleasant. 
24. It is impossible to discover among these various degrees 
a state of indifference; with the first sensation, no matter how 
weak it may be, the statue is necessarily ill or well. But once it 
shall have experienced successively the sharpest pains and the 
liveliest pleasures, it will consider indifferent, or will cease to 
regard as agreeable or disagreeable, the weaker sensations which 
it will have compared with the stronger. 
We may therefore suppose that there are for it divers degrees, 
agreeable or disagreeable, in the modes of being, and others 
which it regards as indifferent. 
25. Whenever it is ill or less well, it recalls its past sensations, 
compares them with its actual condition, and feels that it is 
important that it should become once more what it was formerly. 
Hence springs the need or knowledge of a state of well-being, 
which it concludes that it needs to enjoy. 
Therefore it knows that it has wants only because it compares 
the pain from which it is suffering with the pleasures it has en- 
joyed. Destroy in it the remembrance of these pleasures, and 
the statue will be ill, without suspecting that it has any want, 
for, in order to feel the need of anything, one must be acquainted 
with it. Now, in the above supposititious case, the statue is not 
acquainted with any other state of being than that in which it 
finds itself. But once it recalls a happier state, its existing con- 
dition at once causes it to feel the want of that state. Thus it is
-P-A-G-E-371
TREATISE ON SENSATIONS 349 
that pleasure and pain will always determine the action of its 
faculties. 
26. The want experienced by the statue may be caused by a 
genuine pain, by a disagreeable sensation, by a sensation less 
agreeable than those which have preceded it, or, finally, by a 
state of languor, in which it is reduced to one of those states of 
being which it has become accustomed to consider indifferent. 
If its need is caused by an odour which gives it lively pain, the 
need appropriates the power of feeling almost wholly, and leaves 
only strength enough to the memory to remind the statue that it 
has not always been so ill. Then it becomes incapable of compar- 
ing the various states of being through which it has passed; it is 
unable to judge which is the most agreeable. All that it desires 
is to emerge from that condition in order to enjoy another, no 
matter what it may be; and if it were acquainted with a means 
of escaping from its suffering, it would apply all its faculties to 
the making use of that means. It is thus that in serious sickness 
we cease to desire the pleasures we formerly ardently sought, and 
think only of regaining our health. 
When it is a less agreeable sensation which gives rise to the 
want, there are two cases to be distinguished: either the plea- 
sures with which the statue compares that sensation have been 
lively, and accompanied by the strongest emotions, or else they 
have been less powerful and have scarcely moved it. 
In the former case, the past happiness is recalled with the 
greater force the more it differs from the immediate sensation. 
The emotion which accompanied it is partly reproduced, and 
drawing to itself almost the totality of the power of feeling, does 
not permit the agreeable feelings which have preceded or fol- 
lowed it to be noticed. The statue, then, experiencing no dis- 
traction, compares more accurately that happiness with its pre- 
sent state; it judges more truly how greatly that state differs 
from the former, and, as it endeavours to depict it to itself in 
the most vivid manner, the privation of that happiness gives rise 
to a more insistent need, and the possession of it becomes a 
much more necessary welfare. 
In the second case, on the contrary, that state of happiness 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  350 CONDILLAC 
is recalled with much less intensity: other pleasures divide the 
attention; the advantages it offers are less felt; it reproduces but 
little emotion or none at all. Therefore the statue is less inter- 
ested in its return, and does not apply its faculties to it so ear- 
nestly. 
Finally, if the need springs from one of those sensations which 
it has got into the habit of considering indifferent, it lives at first 
without feeling either pain or pleasure. But this state, compared 
with the happy situations in which it has found itself, soon 
becomes disagreeable to the statue, and the pain it then expe- 
riences is what we term ennui. Meanwhile the ennui lasts, in- 
creases, becomes unbearable, and determines powerfully all the 
faculties towards that happiness of which the statue feels the 
loss. : 
This ennui may be as crushing as pain, in which case the statue 
has no other thought than to get rid of it, and turns, without 
selecting, to all the conditions of being which are fitted to cause 
it to disappear. But if we diminish the burden of ennui the 
condition of the statue will be less unhappy, it will feel less im- 
periously the need of being rid of it, it will be in.a condition to 
devote its attention to all the agreeable sentiments of which it 
' has any recollection, and it is the pleasure, the remembrance of 
which it recalls in the liveliest manner, which will draw all the 
faculties to itself. 
27. There are then two principles which determine the degree 
of action of its faculties: on the one hand, the lively remembrance 
of a well-being it has lost; on the other, the small amount of plea- 
sure in the sensation actually felt, or else the pain by which it is 
accompanied. 
When these two principles unite, the statue makes a greater 
effort to recall what it has ceased to be, and it feels less what it 
actually is. For its power of feeling being necessarily limited, 
memory cannot attract a part of this power to itself without 
leaving less to the sense of smell. Even if the action of this faculty 
should be so strong as to appropriate to itself the whole power 
of feeling, the statue will not observe any more the impression 
made upon its organ, and it will recall its former condition in so
-P-A-G-E-373
  TREATISE ON SENSATIONS 351 
lively a manner that it will believe itself to be still in that con- 
dition. 
28. But if its actual condition is the happiest it knows, then 
pleasure induces it to enjoy it by preference. There no longer 
exists any cause capable of inducing the mind to act strongly 
enough to overbear the sense of smell to the extent of destroying 
the feeling in it. Pleasure, on the contrary, concentrates at least 
the greater part of the attention or of the capacity for feeling 
upon the present sensation; and if the statue even yet recalls 
what it has been, it is because the comparison with its present 
state causes it to enjoy its happiness still more. 
29. Here then are two of the effects of memory: the one is a 
sensation which is recalled as strongly as if it were acting upon 
the organ itself; the other is a sensation of which naught remains 
but a faint recollection. 
There are thus in the action of this faculty of memory two 
degrees which we can establish: the weaker is that in which it 
causes pleasure in the past to but a slight extent; the other that 
in which it causes enjoyment of that past just as if the past 
were the present. 
It is called memory when it recalls things as past only, and it 
is called imagination when it recalls them so strongly that they 
appear to be present. Imagination, therefore, is found in our 
statue, as well as memory, and these two faculties differ in degree 
only. Memory is the beginning of an imagination which is yet 
still weak; imagination is memory itself, which has attained the 
fullest power of which it is susceptible. 
Having distinguished two forms of attention in the statue, 
the one acting through the sense of smell, the other through the 
memory, we may now note a third, which acts through the im- 
agination, and the peculiarity of which is to stay the impressions 
of the senses in order to substitute in their place a feeling inde- 
pendent of external objects. 
30. Nevertheless when the statue imagines a sensation which 
it no longer is experiencing, and when it recalls it in as lively a 
manner as if it were still experiencing it, it is not aware that there 
exists in itself a cause which produces the same effect as would 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
  352 CONDILLAC 
be produced by an odoriferous body acting upon its organ of 
smell. It cannot therefore distinguish, as we do, between im- 
agination and feeling. 
31. But we may presume that the imagination of the statue 
will be more active than is our own. Its power of feeling is wholly 
concentrated on a single kind of sensation; the whole force of 
its faculties is devoted solely to odours; nothing can distract 
it. But we are divided between a multitude of sensations and 
ideas, which are constantly assailing us, and, devoting to our 
imagination but a part of our powers, we imagine but feebly. 
Besides, our senses, continually on their guard against our im- 
agination, warn us constantly of the objects we seek to imagine, 
while, on the contrary, the imagination of our statue is entirely 
free to act. Therefore it recalls trustingly an odour which it has 
enjoyed, and it does actually enjoy it, just as if its sense of smell 
were affected by it. Finally the ease with which we can put aside 
things offensive to us, and seek those the enjoyment of which 
we prize, further contributes to render our imagination lazy. 
But since our statue can escape from a disagreeable feeling 
only by imagining strongly a condition of being in which it takes 
pleasure, its imagination is more exercised by it, and must pro- 
duce effects out of the power of our own to attain. 
32. Yet there is one case in which the action of the statue’s 
imagination is wholly suspended, and even also that of memory. 
It is when a sensation is so vivid as to fulfil completely the power 
of feeling. Then the statue is wholly passive. Pleasure becomes 
for it a species of intoxication, in which there is scarcely any 
enjoyment, and pain a crushing in which it scarcely suffers. 
33- But the moment the sensation loses some degrees of its 
intensity, forthwith the faculties of the soul become active once 
more, and need becomes once again the cause which determines 
their action. 
34. The modifications which must give the greatest pleasure 
to the statue are not always those it has most recently expe- 
rienced. They may occur in the beginning or in the middle of 
the chain of its knowledge, or at the end. Imagination, there- 
fore, is frequently compelled to pass rapidly over intermediate
-P-A-G-E-375
TREATISE ON SENSATIONS 353 
ideas. It brings nearer the more distant, changes the order they 
were in in the memory, and out of them forms an entirely new 
chain. 
The connection of ideas does not then follow the same order 
in its faculties. The more that order it derives from the imagi- 
nation becomes familiar to the statue, the less will it preserve 
that order which memory has furnished it with. Thus ideas are 
connected in innumerable different ways, and often the statue 
will recall less the order in which it experienced its sensations 
than the order in which it has imagined them to be. 
35. All these series, however, are formed only through the 
comparisons which have been made between each preceding 
and each succeeding link in the chain, and through the conclu- 
sions which have been drawn concerning their relation to each 
other. This connection becomes stronger in proportion as the 
use of the faculties strengthens the habits of recollection and 
imagination; and this is the reason why we possess the surpris- 
ing advantage of recognizing sensations we have already expe- 
rienced. 
36. For, indeed, if we cause our statue to smell an odour with 
which it is familiar, it is a state of being which it has compared, 
which it has drawn a conclusion from, and which it has linked 
to some of the parts of the series which its memory is in the habit 
of reviewing. That is why it concludes that the state in which 
it finds itself is the same as that in which it formerly found itself. 
But an odour which it has not yet smelled does not come within 
this case, and therefore must strike it as quite new. 
37. It is needless to point out that when it recognizes a state © 
of being it does so without being able to account for the fact. 
The cause of a phenomenon of this sort is so difficult to make 
out that all men who do not know how to observe and analyze 
what is going on within them, are unable to perceive it. 
38. But when the statue goes on a long time without thinking 
of a state of being, what becomes, during that period, of the idea 
it has formed of that state? When, later, that idea is recalled 
by the memory, whence does it spring? Is it in the soul or in the 
body that it has been preserved? In neither.  
-P-A-G-E-376
  354 CONDILLAC 
It is not in the soul, since an alteration in the brain is sufficient 
to destroy the power of recalling the idea. 
It is not in the body. The physical cause alone could be pre- 
served there, and for that it would be necessary to suppose that 
the brain would remain precisely in the condition into which it 
was brought by the sensation which the statue remembers. But 
how can that supposition be maintained in view of the con- 
tinual movements of the mind? How can it be maintained, 
especially when one considers the innumerable ideas stored in 
the memory? The phenomenon may be explained in a much 
simpler way. 
I experience a given sensation when there occurs in one of my 
organs a movement which is transmitted to the brain. If the 
same movement originates in the brain and is transmitted to the 
organ, I believe I experience a sensation which I do not really 
experience: it is an illusion. But if the movement begins and 
ends in the brain, I remember the sensation I have experienced. 
When the statue recalls an idea, then, it is not because the 
idea has been preserved in the body or in the soul; it is because 
the movement, which is the physical and occasioning cause of 
it, is reproduced in the brain. This, however, is not the place to 
venture on conjectures concerning the mechanism of memory. 
We preserve the remembrance of our sensations, we recall them, 
although we have been a long time without thinking of them. 
To bring this about it is sufficient that they should have strongly 
impressed themselves upon us, or that we should have expe- 
_Tienced them repeatedly. These facts authorize me to suppose 
that our statue, organized as we are, is, like ourselves, able to 
remember. 
39. We conclude then that it has contracted several habits: 
the habit of bestowing its attention; the habit of remember- 
ing; a third habit of comparing; a fourth of judging; a fifth of 
imagining; and finally one of recognizing. 
40. The same causes which have produced habits are alone 
capable of maintaining them. I mean that habits will become 
lost unless they are renewed by actions reiterated from time to 
time. In that case cur statue will recall neither the comparisons
-P-A-G-E-377
Ne Cn a ee Ree a Ty nem mer re ene nen ay em 
TREATISE ON SENSATIONS 355 
between states of being which it has made, nor the conclusions 
it has drawn from them, and it will experience a state of being 
for the third or fourth time without being able to recognize it. 
41. But we may ourselves help to maintain the practice of its 
memory and of all its faculties. It is sufficient to induce it, by 
different degrees of pleasure or of pain, to cling to its state of 
being or to escape from it. The skill with which we make use of 
its sensations will enable us to fortify and extend more and more 
its habits. There is even ground for conjecturing that the statue 
will distinguish, in a succession of odours, differences which we 
fail to note. Compelled to apply all its faculties to a single sort 
of sensation, may not the statue exhibit more discernment therein 
than we do? 
42. Yet the relations which its judgment can discover are 
very few in number. It merely is aware that one state of being 
is the same as a state in which it has already been, or else that it 
is different; that the one is agreeable, the other disagreeable, 
and both in a greater or less degree. 
But will it distinguish between several odours smelled to- 
gether? That is a power of discernment which we ourselves 
acquire only by long practice, and even then within very narrow 
limits, for there is no one who can recognize by the sense of 
smell all the components of a sachet. Now it seems to me that 
any mingling of odours must be a sachet to our statue. 
It is the knowledge of odoriferous bodies, as we shall see later, 
which has taught us to recognize two odours within a third. 
After having smelled in turn a rose and a jonquil, we smelled 
them together, and thus learned that the sensation caused in 
us by these two flowers together is composed of two other sen- 
sations. But if the odours be multiplied we can distinguish 
those only which are strongest, and even then we shall not dis- 
tinguish these if the mingling has been made so skilfully that 
no one odour shall prevail over the others. In such a case they 
appear to pass one into another, like colours ground up to- 
gether; they unite and mingle so thoroughly that not one of them 
remains what it originally was, and of many odours one alone 
Temains.  
-P-A-G-E-378
    356 CONDILLAC 
So if our statue, at the first moment of its existence, smells 
two odours, it will not conclude that it is at one and the same 
time in two states of being. But let us suppose that having 
learned to know them separately, it smells them together: will 
it recognize them? That does not appear probable to me. For, 
unaware that they come from two different bodies, nothing can 
lead it to suspect that the sensation it experiences is the sum of 
two other sensations. Indeed, if neither prevail, it would be the 
‘same with us, and if one of the two is fainter, it will merely alter 
the stronger and they will together seem to be a simple state of 
being. To convince ourselves of this we need only smell odours 
which we are not accustomed to refer to separate bodies; I am 
persuaded that we would not venture to affirm whether they are 
one odour or several odours. And this is precisely the case of the 
statue. 
Therefore the statue acquires discernment only through the 
attention it gives at one and the same time to a state of being 
which it is actually experiencing and to another state which it 
has previously experienced. Thus its judgments do not bear 
upon two odours smelled at one and the same time, but upon 
successive sensations. 
CHAPTER III. OF THE DESIRES, THE PASSIONS, 
LOVE, HATE, HOPE, FEAR AND WILL IN A 
MAN LIMITED TO THE SENSE OF SMELL 
1. We have just seen the character of the various kinds of 
wants, and that they are the causes of the degrees of intensity 
with which the faculties of the soul attach themselves to a state 
of well-being, the enjoyment of which becomes a necessity. Now 
desire is nothing else than the action of these faculties, when 
these are directed towards the thing of which we feel the need. 
2. Therefore every desire presupposes that the statue conceives 
of a condition better than the one wherein it finds itself at the 
time, and that it compares the difference between two states of 
being succeeding each other. If they differ but little, its suffering 
is less, in consequence of the deprivation of the mode of being
-P-A-G-E-379
  TREATISE ON SENSATIONS 357 
that it desires; and I give the name of discomfort or slight dis- 
content, to the feeling it experiences. In such a case both the 
action of its faculties is less energetic and its desires are less 
strong. On the contrary, it suffers more if the difference be great, 
and I give the name of anxiety, or even of torment, to the im- 
pression it then experiences. Therefore the difference between 
these two states is the measure of the desire, and it is sufficient 
to remember by how much the action of the faculties gains or 
loses in intensity in order to know all the degrees of desires. 
3. For instance, they are never so violent as when the facul- 
ties of the statue tend to a state of well-being the loss of which 
causes an anxiety the greater in proportion to the difference of 
that wished-for state from the existing state. In such cases, 
nothing can distract the statue’s attention from that condition: 
it recalls it, it imagines it; all its faculties are concentrated upon 
it. Consequently the more it desires it, the more it accustoms 
itself to desire. In a word, it feels for it what we call a passion, 
that is, a desire which prevents our feeling any other, or at least 
is the most powerful one. 
4. This passion persists so long as the state which is the object 
of it continues to appear the most agreeable, and so long as the 
absence of that state is accompanied by the same anxieties. But 
it is replaced by another passion, if the statue has occasion to 
become accustomed to another condition to which it will give 
the preference. 
5. From the moment that enjoyment, suffering, need, desire, 
passion exist in the statue, love and hate exist likewise. For the 
statue loves a pleasant odour, which it enjoys or desires. It hates 
a disagreeable odour, which causes it to suffer; finally, it likes 
fess a less agreeable odour, which it would fain exchange for 
another. In proof of this, it is sufficient to note that to love is 
always synonymous with to enjoy or to desire, and that to hate 
is similarly synonymous with suffering from discomfort, from 
discontent, in the presence of some object. 
6. As there may be several gradations in the amount of anxiety 
caused by the loss of a pleasant object, and in the discontent 
caused by the sight of an odious one, so may similar gradations
-P-A-G-E-380
  
  358 CONDILLAC 
be noted in love and in hate. Indeed we even have words to 
denote them: such as taste, inclination, tendency, aloofness, 
repugnance, disgust. Although these words cannot be substi- 
tuted for the words love, hate, none the less the feelings they 
express are but the beginnings of these passions; they differ from 
these merely in being weaker. 
7. For the rest, the love of which our statue is capable, is but 
love of self, or that which bears the name of self-love. For, in 
truth, it loves but itself, seeing that the things it loves are but 
its own states of being. 
8. Hope and fear spring from the same principle as love and 
hate. 
Our statue, being in the habit of experiencing agreeable or 
disagreeable sensations, is led to conclude that it can experience 
further sensations of the same sort. If this conclusion combines 
with a sensation which pleases, it produces hope; and if it 
combines with a sensation that displeases, it causes fear. For, 
in fact, to hope is to flatter one’s self that one shall possess a 
certain good; to fear, is to be threatened by an evil. It may be 
noted that hope and fear contribute to increase desire. It is from 
the conflict of these two feelings that the most violent passions 
arise. 
9. The remembrance that it has satisfied some of its desires 
causes our statue to hope all the more to be able to satisfy other 
desires, that, unaware of the obstacles which stand in the way, 
it does not see why what it desires should not be within its power, 
like what it has desired on other occasions. It is true that the 
statue cannot make sure of this, but, on the other hand, it has 
no proof of the contrary. If it more particularly remembers that 
the same desire which it feels has formerly been followed by 
enjoyment, it will believe itself capable of realizing it in propor- 
tion as its want of it becomes greater. Thus two causes will con- 
tribute to inspire it with confidence: the knowledge that it has 
satisfied such a desire before, and its interest in satisfying it 
once again. Henceforth the statue will not be satisfied with de- 
siring; it will wél/; for by will is meant an absolute desire, such 
that we consider that a thing we desire is in our power.
-P-A-G-E-381
CONDILLAC 359 
CHAPTER VI. OF THE EGO, OR PERSONALITY OF 
A MAN LIMITED TO THE SENSE OF SMELL 
1. Our statue being capable of remembering, it is no sooner 
one odour than it remembers that it has been another. That is its 
personality, for if it could say J, it would say it at every instant 
of its own duration, and each time its J would comprise all the 
moments it remembered. 
2. True, it would not say it at the first odour. What is meant 
by that term seems to me to suit only a being which notes in 
the present moment, that it is no longer what it has been. So 
long as it does not change, it exists without thought of itself; but 
as soon as it changes, it concludes that it is the selfsame which 
was formerly in such another state, and it says I. 
This observation confirms the fact that in the first instant of 
its existence the statue cannot form desires, for before being 
able to say I wish, one must have said I. 
3. The odours which the statue does not remember do not 
therefore enter into the notion it has of its own person. Being as 
foreign to its Ego as are colours and sounds, of which it has no 
knowledge, they are, in respect of the statue, as if the statue had 
never smelled them. Its Ego is but the sum of the sensations it 
experiences and of those which memory recalls to it. In a word, 
it is at once the consciousness of what it is and the remembrance 
of what it has been. 
CHAPTER VII. CONCLUSIONS FROM THE PRE- 
CEDING CHAPTERS 
1. Having proved that the statue is capable of being attentive, 
of remembering, of comparing, of judging, of discerning, of 
imagining; that it possesses abstract notions, notions of number 
and duration; that it is acquainted with general and particular 
truths; that desires are formed by it, that it has the power of 
passions, loves, hates, wills; and finally that it contracts habits, 
we must conclude that the mind is endowed with as many facul- 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
    360 TREATISE ON SENSATIONS 
ties when it has but a single organ as when it has five. We shall 
see that the faculties which appear to be peculiar to us are no- 
thing else than the same faculties which, applied to a greater 
number of objects, develop more fully. 
2. If we consider that to remember, compare, judge, discern, 
imagine, be astonished, have abstract notions, have notions of 
duration and number, know general and particular truths, are 
but different modes of attention; that to have passions, to love, 
to hate, to hope, to fear and to will are but different modes of 
desire, and that, finally, attention and desire are in their essence 
but sensation, we shall conclude that sensation calls out all the 
faculties of the soul. 
3. Lastly, if we consider that there are no absolutely indiffer- 
ent sensations, we shall further conclude that the different degrees 
of pleasure and of pain constitute the law according to which 
the germ of all that we are has developed in order to produce all 
our faculties. 
This principle may be called want, astonishment, or otherwise, 
but it remains ever the same, for we are always moved by plea- 
sure or by pain in whatever we are led to do by need or astonish- 
ment. 
The fact is that our earliest notions are pain or pleasure only. 
Many others soon follow these, and give rise to comparisons, 
whence spring our earliest needs and our earliest desires. Our 
researches, undertaken for the purpose of satisfying these needs 
and desires, cause us to acquire additional notions which in their 
turn produce new desires. The surprise which makes us feel in- 
tensely any extraordinary thing happening to us, increases from 
time to time the activity of our faculties, and there is formed a 
chain the links of which are alternately notions and desires, and 
it is sufficient to follow up this chain to discover the progress of 
the enlightening of man. 
4. Nearly all that I have said about the faculties of the soul, 
while treating of the sense of smell, I might have said if I had 
taken any other sense; it is easy to apply all to each of the senses. 
I have now only to examine what is peculiar to each of them.

OF MAN* 
ESSAY II. OF THE POWERS WE HAVE BY 
MEANS OF OUR EXTERNAL SENSES 
CHAPTER V.—OF PERCEPTION 
In speaking of the impressions made on our organs in percep- 
tion, we build upon facts borrowed from anatomy and physi- 
ology, for which we have the testimony of our senses. But, being 
now to speak of perception itself, which is solely an act of the 
mind, we must appeal to another authority. The operations of 
our minds are known, not by sense, but by consciousness, the 
authority of which is as certain and as irresistible as that of 
sense. 
In order, however, to our having a distinct notion of any of 
the operations of our own minds, it is not enough that we be 
conscious of them; for all men have this consciousness. It is 
farther necessary that we attend to them while they are ex- 
erted, and reflect upon them with care, while they are recent 
and freshin ourmemory. Itisnecessary that, by employing our- 
selves frequently in this way, we get the habit of this attention 
and reflection; and, therefore, for the proof of facts which I shall 
have occasion to mention upon this subject, I can only appeal 
to the reader’s own thoughts, whether such facts are not agree- 
able to what he is conscious of in his own mind. 
If, therefore, we attend to that act of our mind which we call 
the perception of an external object of sense, we shall find in it 
these three things: — First, Some conception or notion of the 
* Edinburgh, 1785. 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
nS eee et eee 
362 THOMAS REID 
object perceived; Secondly, A strong and irresistible conviction 
and belief of its present existence; and, Thirdly, That this con- 
viction and belief are immediate, and not the effect of reason- 
ing. 
First, It is impossible to perceive an object without having 
some notion or conception of that which we perceive. We may, 
indeed, conceive an object which we do not perceive; but, when 
we perceive the object, we must have some conception of it at 
the same time; and we have commonly a more clear and steady 
notion of the object while we perceive it, than we have from 
memory or imagination when it is not perceived. Yet, even in 
perception, the notion which our senses give of the object may 
be more or less clear, more or less distinct, in all possible degrees. 
Thus we see more distinctly an object at a small than at a 
great distance. An object at a great distance is seen more dis- 
tinctly in a clear than in a foggy day. An object seen indis- 
tinctly with the naked eye, on account of its smallness, may be 
seen distinctly with a microscope. The objects in this room will 
be seen by a person in the room less and less distinctly as the 
light of the day fails; they pass through all the various degrees 
of distinctness according to the degrees of the light, and, at 
last, in total darkness they are not seen at all. What has been 
said of the objects of sight is so easily applied to the objects of 
the other senses, that the application may be left to the reader. 
In a matter so obvious to every person capable of reflection, 
it is necessary only farther to observe, that the notion which we 
get of an object, merely by our external sense, ought not to be 
confounded with that more scientific notion which a man, come 
to the years of understanding, may have of the same object, by 
attending to its various attributes, or to its various parts, and 
their relation to each other, and to the whole. Thus, the notion 
which a child has of a jack for roasting meat, will be acknow- 
ledged to be very different from that of a man who understands 
its construction, and perceives the relation of the parts to one 
another, and to the whole. The child sees the jack and every 
part of it as well as the man. The child, therefore, has all the 
notion of it which sight gives; whatever there is more in the  
-P-A-G-E-385
  THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS OF MAN 363 
notion which the man forms of it, must be derived from other 
powers of the mind, which may afterwards be explained. This 
observation is made here only that we may not confound the 
operations of different powers of the mind, which by being 
always conjoined after we grow up to understanding, are apt to 
pass for one and the same. 
Secondly, In perception we not only have a notion more or 
less distinct of the object perceived, but also an irresistible con- 
viction and belief of its existence. This is always the case when 
we are certain that we perceive it. There may be a perception 
so faint and indistinct as to leave us in doubt whether we per- 
ceive the object or not. Thus, when a star begins to twinkle as 
the light of the sun withdraws, one may, for a short time, think 
he sees it without being certain, until the perception acquire 
some strength and steadiness. When a ship just begins to appear 
in the utmost verge of the horizon, we may at first be dubious 
whether we perceive it or not; but when the perception is in any 
degree clear and steady, there remains no doubt of its reality; 
and when the reality of the perception is ascertained, the exist-. 
ence of the object perceived can no longer be doubted. 
By the laws of all nations, in the most solemn judicial trials, 
wherein men’s fortunes and lives are at stake, the sentence 
passes according to the testimony of eye or ear witnesses of 
good credit. An upright judge will give a fair hearing to every 
objection that can be made to the integrity of a witness, and 
allow it to be possible that he may be corrupted; but no judge 
will ever suppose that witnesses may be imposed upon by trust- 
ing to their eyes and ears. And if a sceptical counsel should 
plead against the testimony of the witnesses, that they had no 
other evidence for what they declared but the testimony of 
their eyes and ears, and that we ought not to put so much 
faith in our senses as to deprive men of life or fortune upon their 
testimony, surely no upright judge would admit a plea of this 
kind. I believe no counsel, however sceptical, ever dared to 
offer such an argument; and, if it was offered, it would be 
rejected with disdain. 
Can any stronger proof be given that it is the universal judg-
-P-A-G-E-386
    364 THOMAS REID 
ment of mankind that the evidence of sense is a kind of evi- 
dence which we may securely rest upon in the most momentous 
concerns of mankind; that it is a kind of evidence against which 
we ought not to admit any reasoning; and, therefore that to 
reason either for or against it is an insult to common sense? 
The whole conduct of mankind in the daily occurrences of 
life, as well as the solemn procedure of judicatories in the trial 
of causes civil and criminal, demonstrates this. I know only of 
two exceptions that may be offered against this being the uni- 
versal belief of mankind. 
The first exception is that of some lunatics who have been 
persuaded of things that seem to contradict the clear testimony 
of their senses. It is said there have been lunatics and hypo- 
chondriacal persons, who seriously believed themselves to be 
made of glass; and, in consequence of this, lived in continual 
terror of having their brittle frame shivered into pieces. 
All I have to say to this is, that our minds, in our present 
state, are, as well as our bodies, liable to strange disorders; and, 
as we do not judge of the natural constitution of the body from 
the disorders or diseases to which it is subject from accidents, 
so neither ought we to judge of the natural powers of the mind 
from its disorders, but from its sound state. It is natural to 
man, and common to the species, to have two hands and two 
feet; yet I have seen a man, and a very ingenious one, who was 
born without either hands or feet. It is natural to man to have 
faculties superior to those of brutes; yet we see some individuals 
whose faculties are not equal to those of many brutes; and the 
wisest man may, by various accidents, be reduced to this state. 
General rules that regard those whose intellects are sound are 
not overthrown by instances of men whose intellects are hurt 
by any constitutional or accidental disorder. 
The other exception that may be made to the principle we 
have laid down is that of some philosophers who have main- 
tained that the testimony of sense is fallacious, and therefore 
ought never to be trusted. Perhaps it might be a sufficient an- 
swer to this to say, that there is nothing so absurd which some 
philosophers have not maintained. It is one thing to profess a
-P-A-G-E-387
  THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS OF MAN 365 
doctrine of this kind, another seriously to believe it, and to be 
governed by it in the conduct of Jife. It is evident that aman 
who did not believe his senses could not keep out of harm’s way 
an hour of his life; yet, in all the history of philosophy, we never 
read of any sceptic that ever stepped into fire or water be- 
cause he did not believe his senses, or that shewed in the con- 
duct of life less trust in his senses than other men have. This 
gives us just ground to apprehend that philosophy was never 
able to conquer that natural belief which men have in their 
senses; and that all their subtile reasonings against this belief 
were never able to persuade themselves. 
It appears, therefore, that the clear and distinct testimony 
of our senses carries irresistible conviction along with it to every 
man in his right judgment. 
I observed, Thirdly, That this conviction is not only irresisti- 
ble, but it is immediate; that is, it is not by a train of reasoning 
and argumentation that we come to be convinced of the exist- 
ence of what we perceive; we ask no argument for the exist- 
ence of the object, but that we perceive it; perception com- 
mands our belief upon its own authority, and disdains to rest 
its authority upon any reasoning whatsoever. 
The conviction of a truth may be irresistible, and yet not 
immediate. Thus, my conviction that the three angles of every 
plain triangle are equal to two right angles, is irresistible, but it 
is not immediate; I am convinced of it by demonstrative rea- 
soning. There are other truths in mathematics of which we 
have not only an irresistible but an immediate conviction. 
Such are the axioms. Our belief of the axioms in mathematics 
is not grounded upon argument — arguments are grounded 
upon them; but their evidence is discerned immediately by the 
human understanding. 
It is, no doubt, one thing to have an immediate conviction of 
a self-evident axiom; it is another thing to have an immediate 
conviction of the existence of what we see; but the conviction 
is equally immediate and equally irresistible in both cases. No 
man thinks of seeking a reason to believe what he sees; and, 
before we are capable of reasoning, we put no less confidence in
-P-A-G-E-388
  366 THOMAS REID 
our senses than after. The rudest savage is as fully convinced 
of what he sees, and hears, and feels, as the most expert logi- 
cian. The constitution of our understanding determines us to 
hold the truth of a mathematical axiom as a first principle, from 
which other truths may be deduced, but it is deduced from none; 
and the constitution of our power of perception determines us 
to hold the existence of what we distinctly perceive as a first 
principle, from which other truths may be deduced; but it is 
deduced from none. What has been said of the irresistible and 
immediate belief of the existence of objects distinctly per- 
ceived, I mean only to affirm with regard to persons so far ad- 
vanced in understanding as to distinguish objects of mere imag- 
ination from things which have a real existence. Every man 
knows that he may have a notion of Don Quixote, or of Gara- 
gantua, without any belief that such persons ever existed; and 
that of Julius Cesar and Oliver Cromwell, he has not only a 
notion, buta belief that they did really exist. But whether child- 
ren, from the time that they begin to use their senses, make a 
distinction between things which are only conceived or imag- 
ined, and things which really exist, may be doubted. Until we 
are able to make this distinction, we cannot properly be said to 
believe or to disbelieve the existence of any*hing. The belief of 
the existence of anything seems to suppose 4 notion of existence 
—a notion too abstract, perhaps, to enter into the mind of an 
infant. I speak of the power of perception in those that are 
adult and of a sound mind, who believe that there are some 
things which do really exist; and that there are many things 
conceived by themselves, and by others, which have no exist- 
ence. That such persons do invariably ascribe existence to 
everything which they distinctly perceive, without seeking rea- 
sons or arguments for doing so, is perfectly evident from the 
whole tenor of human life. 
The account I have given of our perception of external 
objects, is intended as a faithful delineation of what every 
man, come to years of understanding, and capable of giving 
attention to what passes in his own mind, may feel in himself. 
In what manner the notion of external objects, and the imme-
-P-A-G-E-389
  THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS OF MAN 367 
diate belief of their existence, is produced by means of our 
senses, I am not able to shew, and I do not pretend to shew. If 
the power of perceiving external objects in certain circum- 
stances, be a part of the original constitution of the human 
mind, all attempts to account for it will be vain. No other 
account can be given of the constitution of things, but the will 
of Him that made them. As we can give no reason why matter 
is extended and inert, why the mind thinks and is conscious of 
its thoughts, but the will of Him who made both; so I suspect 
we can give no other reason why, in certain circumstances, we 
perceive external objects, and in others do not. 
The Supreme Being intended that we should have such 
knowledge of the material objects that surround us, as is neces- 
sary in order to our supplying the wants of nature, and avoiding 
the dangers to which we are constantly exposed; and he has 
admirably fitted our powers of perception to this purpose. If 
the intelligence we have of external objects were to be got by 
reasoning only, the greatest part of men would be destitute of 
it; for the greatest part of men hardly ever learn to reason; and 
in infancy and childhood no man can reason: Therefore, as this 
intelligence of the objects that surround us, and from which we 
may receive so much benefit or harm, is equally necessary to 
children and to men, to the ignorant and to the learned, God in 
his wisdom conveys it to us in a way that puts all upon a level. 
The information of the senses is as perfect, and gives as full 
conviction to the most ignorant as to the most learned. 
CHAPTER XVI. OF SENSATION 
Havine finished what I intend, with regard to that act of 
mind which we call the preception of an external object, I pro- 
ceed to consider another, which, by our constitution, is con- 
joined with perception, and not with perception only, but with 
many other acts of our minds; and that is sensation. 
Almost all our perceptions have corresponding sensations 
which constantly accompany them, and, on that account, are 
very apt to be confounded with them. Neither ought we to 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  368 THOMAS REID 
expect that the sensation, and its corresponding perception, 
should be distinguished in common language, because the pur- 
poses of common life do not require it. Language is made to 
serve the purposes of ordinary conversation; and we have no 
reason to expect that it should make distinctions that are not of 
common use. Hence it happens, that a quality perceived, and 
the sensation corresponding to that perception, often go under 
the same name. 
This makes the names of most of our sensations ambiguous, 
and this ambiguity hath very much perplexed philosophers. 
It will be necessary to give some instances, to illustrate the 
distinction between our sensations and the objects of percep- 
tion. 
When I smell a rose, there is in this operation both sensation 
and perception. The agreeable odour I feel, considered by 
itself, without relation to any external object, is merely a sensa- 
tion. It affects the mind in a certain way; and this affection of 
the mind may be conceived, without a thought of the rose, or 
any other object. This sensation can be nothing else than it is 
felt to be. Its very essence consists in being felt; and, when 
it is not felt, it is not. There is no difference between the 
sensation and the feeling of it— they are one and the same 
thing. It is for this reason that we before observed that, in 
sensation, there is no object distinct from that act of the mind 
by which it is felt — and this holds true with regard to all 
sensations. 
Let us next attend to the perception which we have in smell- 
ing a rose. Perception has always an external object; and the 
object of my perception, in this case, is that quality in the rose 
which I discern by the sense of smell. Observing that the agree- 
able sensation is raised when the rose is near, and ceases when 
it is removed, I am led, by my nature, to conclude some quality 
to be in the rose, which is the cause of this sensation. This qual- 
ity in the rose is the object perceived; and that act of my mind 
by which I have the conviction and belief of this quality, is 
what in this case I call perception. 
But it is here to be observed, that the sensation I feel, and
-P-A-G-E-391
  
THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS OF MAN 369 
the quality in the rose which I perceive, are both called by the , 
same name. The smell of a rose is the name given to both: so 
that this name hath two meanings; and the distinguishing its 
different meanings removes all perplexity, and enables us to 
give clear and distinct answers to questions about which 
philosophers have held much dispute. 
Thus, if it is asked, whether the smell be in the rose, or in the 
mind that feels it, the answer is obvious: That there are two 
different things signified by the smell of a rose; one of which is 
in the mind, and can be in nothing but in a sentient being; the 
other is truly and properly in the rose. The sensation which I 
feel is inmy mind. The mind is the sentient being; and, as the 
rose is insentient, there can be no sensation, nor anything re- 
sembling sensation in it. But this sensation in my mind is 
occasioned by a certain quality in the rose, which is called by 
the same name with the sensation, not on account of any simil- 
itude, but because of their constant concomitancy. 
All the names we have for smells, tastes, sounds, and for the 
various degrees of heat and cold, have a like ambiguity; and 
what has been said of the smell of a rose may be applied to 
them. They signify both a sensation, and a quality perceived 
by means of that sensation. The first is the sign, the last the 
thing signified. As both are conjoined by nature, and as the 
purposes of common life do not require them to be disjoined 
in our thoughts, they are both expressed by the same name: 
and this ambiguity is to be found in all languages, because the 
reason of it extends to all. 
The same ambiguity is found in the names of such diseases 
as are indicated by a particular painful sensation: such as the 
toothache, the headache. The toothache signifies a painful 
sensation, which can only be in a sentient being; but it signifies 
also a disorder in the body, which has no similitude to a sensa- 
tion, but is naturally connected with it. 
Pressing my hand with force against the table, I feel pain, 
and I feel the table to be hard. The pain is a sensation of the 
mind, and there is nothing that resembles it in the table. The 
hardness is in the table, nor is there anything resembling it in   
 
-P-A-G-E-392
  370 THOMAS REID 
the mind. Feeling is applied to both; but in a different sense; 
being a word common to the act of sensation, and to that of 
perceiving by the sense of touch. © 
I touch the table gently with my hand, and I feel it to be 
smooth, hard, and cold. These are qualities of the table per- 
ceived by touch; but I perceive them by means of a sensation 
which indicates them. This sensation not being painful, I com- 
monly give no attention to it. It carries my thought immedi- 
ately to the thing signified by it, and is itself forgot, asif it had 
never been. But, by repeating it, and turning my attention to 
it, and abstracting my thought from the thing signified by it, I 
find it to be merely a sensation, and that it has no similitude 
to the hardness, smoothness, or coldness of the table, which are 
signified by it. 
It is indeed difficult, at first, to disjoin things in our attention 
which have always been conjoined, and to make that an object 
of reflection which never was so before; but some pains and 
practice will overcome this difficulty in those who have got the 
habit of reflecting on the operations of their own minds. 
Although the present subject leads us only to consider the 
sensations which we have by means of our external senses, yet 
it will serve to illustrate what has been said, and, I apprehend, 
is of importance in itself, to observe, that many operations of 
mind, to which we give one name, and which we always con- 
sider as one thing, are complex in their nature, and made up of 
several more simple ingredients; and of these ingredients sensa- 
tion very often makes one. Of this we shall give some instances. 
The appetite of hunger includes an uneasy sensation, and a 
desire of food. Sensation and desire are different acts of mind. 
The last, from its nature, must have an object; the first has no 
object. These two ingredients may always be separated in 
thought — perhaps they sometimes are, in reality; but hunger 
includes both. 
Benevolence towards our fellow-creatures includes an agree- 
able feeling; but it includes also a desire of the happiness of 
others. The ancients commonly called it desire. Many mod- 
erns choose rather to call it a feeling. Both are right: and they 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS OF MAN 37: 
only err who exclude either of the ingredients. Whether these 
two ingredients are necessarily connected, is, perhaps, difficult 
for us to determine, there being many necessary connections 
which we do not perceive to be necessary; but we can disjoin 
them in thought. They are different acts of the mind. 
An uneasy feeling, and a desire, are, in like manner, the in- 
gredients of malevolent affections; such as malice, envy, re- 
venge. The passion of fear includes an uneasy sensation or 
feeling, and an opinion of danger; and hope is made up of the 
contrary ingredients. When we hear of a heroic action, the 
sentiment which it raises in our mind, is made up of various 
ingredients. There is in it an agreeable feeling, a benevolent 
affection to the person, and a judgment or opinion of his merit. 
If we thus analyse the various operations of our minds, we 
shall find that many of them which we consider as perfectly 
simple, because we have been accustomed to call them by one 
name, are compounded of more simple ingredients; and that 
sensation, or feeling, which is only a more refined kind of sensa- 
tion, makes one ingredient, not only in the perception of 
external objects, but in most operations of the mind. 
A small degree of reflection may satisfy us that the number 
and variety of our sensations and feelings is prodigious; for, to 
omit all those which accompany our appetites, passions, and 
affections, our moral sentiments and sentiments of taste, even 
our external senses, furnish a great variety of sensations, differ- 
ing in kind, and almost in every kind an endless variety of 
degrees. Every variety we discern, with regard to taste, smell, 
sound, colour, heat, and cold, and in the tangible qualities of 
bodies, is indicated by a sensation corresponding to it. 
The most general and the most important division of our 
sensations and feelings, is into the agreeable, the disagreeable, 
and the indifferent. Everything we call pleasure, happiness, or 
enjoyment, on the one hand; and, on the other, everything we 
call misery, pain, or uneasiness, is sensation or feeling; for no 
man can for the present be more happy or more miserable than 
he feels himself to be. He cannot be deceived with regard to the 
enjoyment or suffering of the present moment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  372 THOMAS REID 
But I apprehend that, besides the sensations that are either 
agreeable or disagreeable, there is still a greater number that 
are indifferent. To these we give so little attention, that they 
have no name, and are immediately forgot, as if they had never 
been; and it requires attention to the operations of our minds 
to be convinced of their existence. 
For this end we may observe, that, to a good ear, every 
human voice is distinguishable from all others. Some voices 
are pleasant, some disagreeable; but the far greater part can 
neither be said to be one nor the other. The same thing may be 
said of other sounds, that no less of tastes, smells, and colours; 
and, if we consider that our senses 
while we are awake, and some sensati 
they present to us, and that familiar 
emotion, pleasant or painful, we shall 
agreeable and disagreeable, to admit a 
that may be called indifferent. 
The sensations that are indifferent, n attends every object 
bjects seldom raise any 
see reason, besides the 
third class of sensations i in continual exercise 
are far from being use- 
less. They serve as signs to distinguish things that differ; and 
the information we have concerning things external, comes by 
their means. Thus, if a man had no ear to receive pleasure from 
the harmony or melody of sounds, he would still find the sense 
of hearing of great utility. Though sounds give him neither 
pleasure nor pain of themselves, they would give him much 
useful information; and the like may be said of the sensations 
we have by all the other senses. 
As to the sensations and feelings that are agreeable or dis- 
agreeable, they differ much not only in degree, but in kind and 
in dignity. Some belong to the animal part of our nature, and 
are common to us with the brutes; others belong to the rational 
and moral part. The first are more properly called sensations; 
the last, feelings. The French word sentiment is common to 
both. 
I shall conclude this chapter by observing that, as the con- 
founding our: sensations with that perception of external 
objects which is constantly conjoined with them, has been the 
occasion of most of the errors and false theories of philosophers 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS OF MAN 373 
with regard to the senses; so the distinguishing these opera- 
tions seems to me to be the key that leads to a right under- 
standing of both. 
Sensation, taken by itself, implies neither the conception nor 
belief of any external object. It supposes a sentient being, and 
a certain manner in which that being is affected; but it sup- 
poses no more. Perception implies an immediate conviction 
and belief of something external — something different both 
from the mind that perceives, and from the act of perception. 
Things so different in their nature ought to be distinguished; 
but, by our constitution, they are always united. Every dif- 
ferent perception is conjoined with a sensation that is proper to 
it. The one is the sign, the other the thing signified. They 
coalesce in our imagination. They are signified by one name, 
and are considered as one simple operation. The purposes of 
life do not require them to be distinguished. 
It is the philosopher alone who has occasion to dis- 
tinguish them, when he would analyse the operation com- 
pounded of them. But he has no suspicion that there is 
any composition in it; and to discover this requires a de- 
gree of reflection which has been too little practised by 
philosophers.

THE HUMAN MIND#* 
PART II 
CHAPTER V. SECTION I. THE MUSCULAR 
SENSATIONS 
In defining sensation, when we began our inquiry into its 
nature, to be that affection of the mind, which is immediately 
subsequent to the affection of certain organs, induced by the 
action of external bodies; two assumptions were made, — the 
existence of foreign changeable external bodies, as separate 
from the mind, — and the existence of organs, also separate 
from the mind, and in relation to it truly external, like other 
bodies, but forming a permanent part of our corporeal frame, 
and capable of being affected, in a certain manner, by the other 
bodies, of which the existence was assumed. As far as our 
analytical inquiry has yet proceeded, these assumptions are 
assumptions still. We have not been able to detect, in the sens- 
ations considered more than in any of our internal pleasures 
or pains, any circumstances that seem to be indicative of a 
material world without. 
Our analytical inquiry itself, however, even in attempting to 
trace the circumstances in which the belief originates, must pro- 
ceed on that very belief. Accordingly, in examining our senses 
of smell, taste, and hearing, I uniformly took for granted the 
existence of odoriferous, sapid, and vibrating bodies, and con-

of the Human Mind, abridged by Levi Hedge, Cambridge, 1827, vol. 1. 
 
-P-A-G-E-397
  
PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN MIND 375 
sidered merely, whether the sensations excited by these, were, 
of themselves, capable of communicating to us any knowledge 
of the external and independent existence of the bodies which 
excited them. 
In the present stage of our inquiry, I must, in like manner, 
take for granted the existence of bodies, which act, by their 
contiguity or pressure, on our organs of touch, as the odoriferous 
or sapid particles act on our nerves of smell and taste. All our 
language is at present adapted to a system of external things. 
There is no direct vocabulary of skepticism; and even the most 
cautious and philosophic inquirer, therefore, must often be 
obliged to express his doubt, or his dissent, in language that 
implies affirmation. In the present case, when we attempt to 
analyze our sensations, it is impossible to speak of the circum- 
stances in which the infant is placed, or even to speak of the 
infant himself, without that assumption which we have been 
obliged to make. The real existence of an external universe, and 
the belief of that existence, are, however, in themselves, per- 
fectly separate and distinct; and it is not the existence of an 
external world which we are now endeavouring to establish as 
an object of belief. We are only endeavouring, in our analysis 
of the sensations afforded by our different organs, to ascertain 
in what circumstance the belief arises. There might be a world 
of suns and planets, though there were no human being, whose 
mind could be affected with belief of it; and even the most 
zealous defenders of the reality of external nature must admit, 
that, though no created thing but ourselves were in existence, 
our mind might still have been so constituted, as to have the 
very series of feelings, which form at present its successive 
phenomena, and which are ascribed in no small number to the 
action of external things. 
Are the primary sensations derived from the organ of touch, 
then, of such a kind as to afford us that knowledge, which they 
are supposed to give of things without? 
Let us imagine a being, endowed with the sense of touch, and 
with every other sense and faculty of our mind, but not with any 
previous knowledge of his own corporeal frame, or of other
-P-A-G-E-398
376 THOMAS BROWN 
things external, — and let us suppose a small body, of any 
shape, to be pressed, for the first time, on his open hand. What- 
ever feeling mere touch can give, directly of itself, would of 
course be the same in this case, as now, when our knowledge is 
increased and complicated, from many other sources. 
Let the body, thus impressed, be supposed to be a small cube, 
of the same temperature with the hand itself, that all consider- 
ations of heat or cold may be excluded, and the feeling produced 
be as simple as possible. 
What, then, may we suppose the consequent feeling to be? 
It will, I conceive, be a simple feeling of the kind already 
spoken of, as capable of arising from the affection of a single 
point of our organ of touch, —a feeling that varies indeed 
with the quantity of pressure as the sensation of fragrance 
varies with the number of the odorous particles, but involves 
as little the notion of extension, as that notion is involved in the 
mere fragrance of a violet or a rose. The connexion of this 
original tactual feeling, however, with that of extension, is now 
so indissoluble, as, indeed, it could not fail to become, in the cir- 
cumstance in which it has uniformly arisen, that it is almost 
impossible to conceive it as separate. We may perhaps, how- 
ever, make a near approach to the conception of it, by using the 
gentle gradual pressure of a small pointed body, which, in the 
various slight feelings, excited by it, — before it penetrate the 
cuticle, or cause any considerable pain, — may represent, in 
some measure, the simple and immediate effect, which pressure 
in any case produces, — exclusively of the associate feelings 
which it indirectly suggests. 
Those who have the curiosity to try the experiment, with any 
small bodies, not absolutely pointed, — such as the head of a 
pin, or any body of similar dimensions, — will be astonished to 
feel, how very slightly, if at all, the notion of extension, or 
figure, is involved in the feeling, even after all the intimate asso- 
ciations of our experience; — certainly far less than the notion of 
longitudinal distance seems to us to be involved in the immedi- 
ate affections of our sense of sight. 
But the pressure of such a large body as the cube, which we 
   
-P-A-G-E-399

have supposed to be pressed against our organ of touch, now 
awakens very different feelings. We perceive, as it were imme- 
diately, form and hardness. May not, then, the knowledge of 
resistance and extension, and consequently the belief of the 
essential qualities of matter, be originally communicated by the 
affections of this organ? 
The feeling of resistance, — to begin with this, — is, I con- 
ceive, to be ascribed, not to our organ of touch, but to our 
muscular frame, as forming a distinct organ of sense; the affec- 
tions of which, particularly as existing in combination with 
other feelings, and modifying our judgments concerning these, 
(as in the case of distant vision, for example,) are not less impor- 
tant than those of our other sensitive organs. The sensations of 
this class, are, indeed, in common circumstances, so obscure, as 
to be scarcely heeded or remembered; but there is probably no 
contraction, even of a single muscle, which is not attended with 
some faint degree of sensation, that distinguishes it from the 
contraction of other muscles, or from other degrees of contrac- 
tion of the same muscle. Each motion of the visible limb, 
whether produced by one or more of the invisible muscles, is 
accompanied with a certain feeling, that may be complex, 
indeed, as arising from various muscles, but which is consid- 
ered by the mind as one; and it is this particular feeling, accom- 
panying the particular visible motion, — whether the feeling 
and the invisible parts contracted be truly simple or compound, 
— which we distinguish from every other feeling accompanying 
every other quantity of contraction. It is as if a man, born 
blind, were to walk, for the first time, in a flower garden. He 
would distinguish the fragrance of one parterre from the fra- 
grance of another, though he might be altogether ignorant of 
the separate odours united in each; and might even consider 
as one simple perfume, what was, in truth, the mingled pro- 
duct of a thousand. 
Obscure as our muscular sensations are in common circum- 
stances, there are other circumstances in which they make 
themselves abundantly manifest. It is sufficient to refer to 
phenomena of which every one must have been conscious in-
-P-A-G-E-400
  378 THOMAS BROWN 
numerable times, and which imply no disease nor lasting differ- 
ence of state. What is the feeling of fatigue, for example, but a 
muscular feeling? that is to say, a feeling of which our muscles 
are as truly the organ, as our eye or ear is the organ of sight or 
hearing. When a limb has been long exercised, without suffi- 
cient intervals of rest, the repetition of the contraction of its 
muscles is accompanied, not with a slight and obscure sensa- 
tion, but with one which amounts, if it be gradually increased, 
to severe pain, and which, before it arrives at this, has passed 
progressively through various stages of uneasiness. Even when 
there has been no previous fatigue, we cannot make a single 
powerful effort at any time, without being sensible of the mus- 
cular feeling connected with this effort. Of the pleasure which 
attends more moderate exercise, every one must have been con- 
scious in himself, even in his years of maturity, when he seldom 
has recourse to it for the pleasure alone; and must remember, 
still more, the happiness which it afforded him in other years, 
when happiness was of less costly and laborious production 
than at present. By that admirable provision, with which Na- 
ture accommodates the blessings which she gives, to the wants 
that stand in need of them, she has, in that early period, — 
when the pleasure of mental freedom, and the ambitions of 
busy life, are necessarily excluded, — made ample amends to 
the little slave of affections, in that disposition to spontaneous 
pleasure, which renders it almost an effort to be sad, as if exist- 
ence itself were delight; giving him a fund of independent hap- 
piness in the very air which she has poured around him, and the 
ready limbs which move through it almost without his bidding. 
In that beautiful passage, in which Goldsmith describes the 
sounds that come.in one mingled murmur from the village, who 
does not feel the force of the happiness which is comprised in 
the single line, that speaks of 
“ The playful children just let loose from school ?” ! 
It is not the mere freedom from the intellectual task, of which 
we think; it is much more that burst of animal pleasure, which 
1 Deserted Village, v. 120.
-P-A-G-E-401
PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN MIND 379 
is felt in every limb, when the long constraint that has repressed 
it is removed, and the whole frame is given once more to all the 
freedom of nature. 
With the same happy provision with which she has consid- 
ered the young of our own species, Nature has, in the other 
animals, whose sources of general pleasure are still more limited 
than in the child, converted their muscular frame into an organ 
of delight. It is not in search of richer pasture, that the horse 
gallops over his field, or the goat leaps from rock to rock; it is 
for the luxury of the exercise itself. It is this appearance of 
happy life which spreads a charm over every little group with 
which Nature animates her scenery; and he who can look with- 
out interest on the young lamb, as it frolics around the bush, 
may gaze, indeed, on the magnificent landscape as it opens 
before him, — but it will be with an eye which looks languidly, 
and in vain, for pleasure which it cannot find. 
Our muscular frame is not merely a part of the living ma- 
chinery of motion, but is also truly an organ of sense. When I 
move my arm, without resistance, I am conscious of a certain 
feeling; when the motion is impeded by the presence of an ex- 
ternal body, I am conscious of a different feeling, arising partly, 
indeed, from the mere sense of touch, in the moving limb com- 
pressed, but not consisting merely in this compression, since, 
when the same pressure is made by a foreign force, without any 
muscular effort on my part, my general feeling is very different. 
It is the feeling of this resistance to our progressive effort, 
(combined, perhaps, with the mere tactual feeling) which 
forms what we term our feeling of solidity, or hardness; and with- 
out it the tactual feeling would be nothing more than a sensa- 
tion indifferent or agreeable, or disagreeable or severely pain- 
ful, according to the force of the pressure, in the particular case; 
in the same way as the matter of heat, acting in different de- 
grees on this very organ of touch, and on different portions of its 
surface at different times, produces all the intermediate sensa- 
tions, agreeable, disagreeable, or indifferent, from the pain of 
excessive cold, to the pain of burning; and produces them in 
like manner, without suggesting the presence of any solid body 
external to ourselves. 
 
-P-A-G-E-402
    380 THOMAS BROWN 
Were the cue, therefore, in the case supposed, pressed for the 
first time on the hand, it would excite a certain sensation, in- 
deed, but not that of resistance, which always implies a muscu- 
lar effort that is resisted, and consequently not that of hardness 
which is a mode of resistance. It would be very different, how- 
ever, if we fairly made the attempt to press against it; for then 
our effort would be impeded, and the consequent feeling of 
resistance would arise; which, as co-existing in this case, and in 
every case of effort, with the particular sensation of touch, 
might afterwards be suggested by it, on the simple recurrence 
of the same sensation of touch, so as to excite the notion of 
hardness in the body touched, without the renewal of any mus- 
cular effort on our part, in the same manner as the angular sur- 
faces of the cube, if we chance to turn our eye upon it, are sug- 
gested by the mere plane of colour, which it presents to our 
immediate vision, and which is all that our immediate vision 
would, of itself, have made known to us. The feeling of resist- 
ance, then, it will be admitted, and consequently of hardness, 
and all the other modes of resistance, is a muscular, not a 
tactual feeling. 
SECTION II. SPACE PERCEPTION 
The proof, that our perception of extension by touch, is not 
an original and immediate perception of that sense, is alto- 
gether independent of the success of any endeavour which may 
be made, to discover the elements of the compound perception. 
It would not be less true, that touch does not afford it, though 
we should be incapable of pointing out any source, from which 
it can be supposed to be derived. 
To those who are wholly unacquainted with the theory of 
vision, nothing certainly can seem more absurd than the asser- 
tion, that we see, not with our eyes merely, but chiefly by the 
medium of another organ, which the blind possess in as great 
perfection as ourselves, and which at the moment of vision,
-P-A-G-E-403
  PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN MIND 381 
may perhaps be absolutely at rest. It will not be surprising, 
therefore, though the element which seems to me to form the 
most important constituent of our notion of extension should in 
the same manner seem a very unlikely one. 
This element is our feeling of succession, or time, — a feeling, 
which necessarily involves the notion of divisibility or series of 
parts, that is so essential a constituent of our more complex 
notion of matter, — and to which notion of continuous divisi- 
bility, if the notion of resistance be added, it is scarcely possible 
for us to imagine, that we should not have acquired, by this 
union, the very notion of physical extension, — that which has 
parts, and that which resists our effort to grasp it. 
That memory is a part of our mental constitution, and that 
we are thus capable of thinking of a series of feelings, as succes- 
_Sive to each other, the experience of every moment teaches us 
sufficiently. This succession frequently repeated, suggests im- 
mediately, or implies the notion of length, not metaphorically, 
as is commonly said, but as absolutely as extension itself; and, 
the greater the number of the successive feelings may have 
been, the greater does this length appear. It is not possible for 
us to look back on the years of our life, since they form truly a 
progressive series, without regarding them as a sort of length, 
which is more distinct indeed, the nearer the succession of feel- 
ings, may be to the moment at which we consider them, but 
which, however remote, is still felt by us as one continued length, 
in the same manner, as when, after a journey of many hundred 
miles, we look back, in our memory, on the distance over which 
we have passed, we see, as it were, a long track of which some 
parts, particularly the nearer parts, are sufficiently distinct, but 
of which the rest seems lost in a sort of distant obscurity. The 
line of our long journeying, — or, in other words, that almost 
immeasurable line of plains, hills, declivities, marshes, bridges, 
woods, — to endeavour to comprehend which in our thought, 
seems an effort as fatiguing as the very journey itself, —we 
know well, can be divided, into those various parts; and, in like 
manner, the progressive line of time — or, in other words, the 
continued succession, of which the joy, the hope, the fragrance,
-P-A-G-E-404
  
  382 THOMAS BROWN 
the regret, the melody, the fear, and innumerable other affec- 
tions of the mind, were parts, we feel that we can mentally 
divide into those separate portions of the train. Continuous 
length and divisibility, those great elementary notions of space, 
and of all that space contains, are thus found in every succes- 
sion of our feelings. There is no language in which time is not 
described as long or short, — not from any metaphor — for no 
mere arbitrary metaphor can be thus universal and inevitable, 
as a form of human thought — but because it is truly impos- 
sible for us to consider succession, without this notion of pro- 
gressive divisibility attached to it; and it appears to us as ab- 
surd to suppose, that by adding, to our retrospect of a week, 
the events of the month preceding, we do not truly lengthen the 
succession, as it would be to suppose, that we do not lengthen 
the line of actual distance, by adding, to the few last stages of a 
long journey, the many stages that preceded it. 
That which is progressive must have parts. Time, or succes- 
sion, then involves the very notions of longitudinal extension 
and divisibility, and involves these, without the notion of any 
thing external to the mind itself; — for though the mind of 
man had been susceptible only of joy, grief, fear, hope, and the 
other varieties of internal feeling, without the possibility of 
being affected by external things, he would still have been capa- 
ble of considering these feelings, as successive to each other, ina 
long continued progression, divisible into separate parts. The 
notions of length, then, and of divisibility, are not confined to 
external things, but are involved in that very memory, by 
which we consider the series of the past, — not in the memory 
of distant events only, but in those first successions of feeling, 
by which the mind originally became conscious of its own per- 
manence and identity. The notion of time, then, is precisely 
coeval with that of the mind itself; since it is implied in the 
knowledge of succession, by which alone the mind acquires the 
knowledge of its own reality, as something more than the mere 
sensation of the present moment. 
Conceiving the notion of time, therefore, that is to say, of 
feelings past and present, to be thus one of the earliest notions
-P-A-G-E-405
  PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN MIND 383 
which the infant miztd can form, so as to precede its notions of 
external things, and to involve the notions of length and divisi- 
bility, I am inclined to reverse exactly the process commonly 
supposed; and, instead of deriving the measure of time from 
extension, to derive the knowledge and original measure of 
extension from time. That one notion or feeling of the mind 
may be united indissolubly with other feelings, with which it 
has frequently co-existed, and to which, but for this co-exist- 
ence, it would seem to have no common relation, is sufficientiy 
shown by the phenomena of vision. 
In what manner, however, is the notion of time peculiarly 
associated with the simple sensation of touch, so as to form, 
with it, the perception of extension? Weare able, in the theory 
of vision, to point out the co-existence of sensations which pro- 
duce the subsequent union, that renders the perception of dis- 
tance apparently immediate. If a similar co-existence of the 
original sensations of touch, with the notion of continued and 
divisible succession, cannot be pointed out in the present case, 
the opinion which asserts it, must be considered merely as a 
wild and extravagant conjecture. 
The source of such a co-existence is not merely to be found, 
but is at least as obvious, as that which is universally admitted 
in the case of vision. 
To proceed, then, — The hand is the great organ of touch. 
It is composed of various articulations, that are easily move- 
able, so as to adapt it readily to changes of shape, in accommo- 
dation to the shape of the bodies which it grasps. If we shut 
our hand gradually, or open it gradually, we find a certain 
series of feelings, varying with each degree of the opening or 
closing, and giving the notion of succession of a certain length. 
In like manner, if we gradually extend our arms, in various 
directions, or bring them nearer to us again, we find that each 
degree of the motion is accompanied with a feeling that is dis- 
tinct, so as to render us completely conscious of the progres- 
sion. The gradual closing of the hand, therefore, must neces- 
sarily give a succession of feelings, — a succession, which, of 
itself, might, or rather must, furnish the notion of length in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-406
  384 THOMAS BROWN 
manner before stated, the length being different, according to 
the degree of the closing; and the gradual stretching out of the 
arm gives a succession of feelings, which, in like manner, must 
furnish the notion of length, — the length being different ac- 
cording to the degree of the stretching of the arm. To those 
who have had opportunities of observing infants, I need not 
say, how much use, or rather what constant use, the future 
inquirer makes of his little fingers and arms; by the frequent 
contraction of which, and the consequent renewal of the series 
of feelings involved in each gradual contraction, he cannot fail 
to become so well acquainted with the progress, as to distin- 
guish each degree of contraction, and, at last, after innumerable 
repetitions, to associate with each degree the notion of a certain 
length of succession. The particular contraction, therefore, 
when thus often repeated, becomes the representative of a cer- 
tain length, in the same manner as shades of colour in vision 
become ultimately representative of distance, — the same prin- 
ciple of association, which forms the combination in the one 
case, operating equally in the other. 
In these circumstances of acquired knowledge, — after the 
series of muscular feelings, in the voluntary closing of the hand, 
has become so familiar, that the whole series is anticipated and 
expected, as soon as the motion has begun, — when a ball, or 
any other substance, is placed for the first time in the infant’s 
hand, he feels that he can no longer perform the usual con- 
traction, — or, in other words, since he does not fancy that he 
has muscles which are contracted, he feels that the usual series 
of sensations does not follow his will to renew it, — he knows 
how much of the accustomed succession is still remaining; and 
the notion of this particular length, which was expected, and 
interrupted by a new sensation, is thus associated with the par- 
ticular tactual feeling excited by the pressure of the ball, — the 
greater or less magnitude of the ball preventing a greater or 
less portion of the series of feelings in the accustomed contrac- 
tion. By the frequent repetition of this tactual feeling, as asso- 
ciated with that feeling which attends a certain progress of con- 
traction, the two feelings at last flow together, as in the
-P-A-G-E-407
  PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN MIND 385 
acquired perceptions of vision; and when the process has been 
repeated with various bodies innumerable times, it kecomes, at 
last, as impossible to separate the mere tactual feeling from the 
feeling of length, as to separate the whiteness of a sphere, in 
vision, from that convexity of the sphere, which the eye, of it- 
self, would have been for ever incapable of perceiving. 
As yet, however, the only dimension of the knowledge of 
which we have traced the origin, is mere length; and it must 
still be explained, how we acquire the knowledge of the other 
dimensions. If we had had but one muscle, it seems to me very 
doubtful whether it would have been possible for us to have 
associated with touch any other notion than that of mere 
length. But nature has made provision for giving us a wider 
knowledge, in the various muscles, which she has distributed 
over different parts, so as to enable us to perform motions in 
various directions at the same instant, and thus to have co- 
existing series of feelings, each of which series was before con- 
sidered as involving the notion of length. The infant bends one 
finger gradually on the palm of his hand; the finger, thus 
brought down, touches one part of the surface of the palm, 
producing a certain affection of the organ of touch, and a con- 
sequent sensation; and heacquires the notion of a certainlength, 
in the remembered succession of muscular feelings during the 
contraction; — he bends another finger; it, too, touches a cer- 
tain part of the surface of the palm, producing a certain feeling 
of touch, that co-exists and combines, in like manner, with the 
remembrance of a certain succession of muscular feelings. 
When both fingers move together, the co-existence of the two 
series of successive feelings, with each of which the mind is 
familiar, gives the notion of co-existing lengths, which receive 
a sort of unity, from the proximity in succession of the tactual 
feelings in the contiguous parts of the palm which they touch, — 
feelings, which have before been found to be proximate, when 
the palm has been repeatedly pressed along a surface, and the 
tactual feelings of these parts, which the closing fingers touch 
at the same moment, were always immediately successive, — 
as immediately successive, as any of the muscular feelings in
-P-A-G-E-408
  
  386 THOMAS BROWN 
the series of contraction. When a body is placed in the infant’s 
hand, and its little fingers are bent by it as before, sometimes 
one finger only is impeded in its progress, sometimes two, some- 
times three, — and he thus adds to the notion of mere length, 
which would have been the same, whatever number of fingers 
had been impeded, the notion of a certain number of proximate 
and co-existing lengths, which is the very notion of breadth; 
and with these, according as the body is larger or smaller, is 
combined always the tactual affection produced by the press- 
ure of the body, on more, or fewer, of the interior parts of the 
palm, and fingers, which had before become, of themselves, 
representative of certain lengths, in the manner described; and 
the concurrence of these three varieties of length, in the single 
feeling of resistance, in which they all seem to meet, when an 
incompressible body is placed within the sphere of the clos- 
ing fingers, — however rude the notions of concurring dimen- 
sions may be, or rather must be, as at first formed, — seems at 
least to afford the rude elements, from which, by the frequent 
repetition of the feeling of resistance, together with the prox- 
imate lengths, of which it has become representative, clearer 
notions of the kind may gradually arise. 
The progressive contractions of the various muscles which 
move the arms as affording similar successions of feelings, may 
be considered in precisely the same light, as sources of the 
knowledge of extension; and, by their motion in various direc- 
tions, at the same time with the motion of the fingers, they 
concur powerfully, in modifying, and correcting, the informa- 
tion received from these. The whole hand is brought, by the 
motion of the arm, to touch one part of the face or body; it is 
then moved, so as to touch another part, and with the frequent 
succession of the simple feelings of touch, in these parts, is asso- 
ciated the feeling of the intervening Jength, derived from the 
sensations that accompanied the progressive contraction of the 
arm. But the motion is not always the same; and, as the same 
feeling of touch, in one part, is thus followed by various feelings 
of touch in different parts, with various series of muscular feel- 
ings between, the notion of length in various directions, that is
-P-A-G-E-409
          PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN MIND 387 
to say, of length in various series commencing from one power, 
is obtained in another way. That the knowledge of extension, 
or in other words, the association of the notion of succession 
with the simple feelings of touch, will be rude and indistinct at 
first, I have already admitted; but it will gradually become 
more and more distinct and precise; as we can have no doubt, 
that the perception of distance by the eye is, in the first stages 
of visual association, very indistinct, and becomes clearer after 
each repeated trial. For many weeks or months, all is confu- 
sion in the visual perceptions, as much as in the tactual and 
muscular. Indeed, we have abundant evidence of this contin- 
ued progress of vision, even in mature life, when, in certain 
professions that require nice perceptions of distance, the power 
of perception itself, by the gradual acquisitions which it ob- 
tains from experience, seems to unfold itself more and more, in 
proportion to the wants that require it. 
It may be thought that the notion of time, or succession, is, in 
this instance, a superfluous incumbrance of the theory, and that 
the same advantage might be obtained, by supposing the mus- 
cular feelings themselves, independently of the notion of their 
succession, to be connected with the notion of particular 
lengths. But this opinion, it must be remarked, would leave 
the difficulty precisely as before; and sufficient evidence in con- 
futation of it, may be found in a very simple experiment, which 
it is in the power of any one to make. The experiment I cannot 
but consider as of the more value, since it seems to me strongly 
corroborative of the theory which I have ventured to propose; 
for it shows, that, even after all the acquisitions which our 
sense of touch has made, the notion of extension is still modi- 
fied, in a manner the most striking and irresistible, by the mere 
change of accustomed time. Let any one, with his eyes shut, 
move his hand, with moderate velocity, along a part of a table, 
or any other hard smooth surface; the portion over which he 
presses, will appear of a certain length; let him move his hand 
more rapidly, the portion of the surface pressed will appear 
less; let him move his hand very slowly, and the length, accord- 
ing to the degree of the slowness, will appear increased, in a
-P-A-G-E-410
388 THOMAS BROWN 
most wonderful proportion. In this case, there is precisely the 
same quantity of muscular contraction, and the same quantity 
of the organ of touch compressed, whether the motion be rapid, 
moderate, or slow. The only circumstance of difference is the 
time occupied in the succession of the feelings; and this differ- 
ence is sufficient to give complete diversity to the notion of 
length. 
If any one, with his eyes shut, suffer his hand to be guided by 
another, very slowly along any surface unknown to him, he will 
find it impossible to form any accurate guess as to its length. 
But it is not necessary, that we should be previously unac- 
quainted with the extent of surface, along which the motion is 
performed; for the illusion will be nearly the same, and the 
experiment, of course, be still more striking, when the motion is 
along a surface with which we are perfectly familiar, as a book 
which we hold in our hand, or a desk at which we are accus- 
tomed to sit. 
This experiment is well fitted to show the influence of mere 
difference of time, in our estimation of longitudinal extent. It 
is an experiment, tried, unquestionably, in most unfavourable 
circumstances, when our tactual feelings, representative of ex- 
tension, are so strongly fixed, by the long experience of our 
life; and yet, even now, it will be found, on moving the hand, 
slowly and rapidly, along the same extent of surface, though 
with precisely the same degree of pressure in both cases, that 
it is as difficult to conceive the extent, thus slowly and rapidly 
traversed, to bethesame, as it is difficult to conceive the extent 
of visual distance to beexactly the same when we look alternately 
through the different ends of an inverted telescope. If, when all 
other circumstances are the same, the different visual feelings, 
arising from difference of the mere direction of light, be repre- 
sentative of length in the one case, — the longer or shorter suc- 
cession of time, when all other circumstances are the same, has 
surely as much reason to be considered a representative of it, 
in the other case. 
Are we, then, to believe, that feeling of extension, or in 
other words, of the definite figure of bodies, is a simple 
     
-P-A-G-E-411
  PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN MIND 389 
feeling of touch, immediate, original, and independent of 
time; or is there not rather reason to think, that it is a 
compound feeling, of which time, that is to say, our notion 
of succession, is an original element ? 
PART III 
CHAPTER I. SECTION II. SIMPLE AND RELA- 
TIVE SUGGESTION 
Ovr various states or affections of the mind, I have already 
divided into two classes, according to the nature of the circum- 
stances which precede them, — the External and the Internal, 
—and this latter class into two orders, — our Intellectual 
States of Mind, and our Emotions. It is with the intellectual 
phenomena that we are at present concerned; and this order I 
would arrange under two generic capacities, that appear to me 
to comprehend or exhaust the phenomena of the order. The 
whole order, as composed of feelings which arise immediately, 
in consequence of certain former feelings of the mind may be 
technically termed, in reference to these feelings which have 
induced them, Suggestions; but, in the suggested feelings them- 
selves, there is one striking difference. If we analyze out trains 
of intellectual thought exclusively of the Emotions which may 
co-exist or mingle with them, and of sensations that may be 
accidentally excited by external objects, we shall find them to 
be composed of two very distinct sets of feelings, — one set of 
which are mere conceptions or images of the past, that rise, 
image after image in regular sequence, but simply in succession, 
without any feeling of relation necessarily involved, — while the 
perceptions of relation, in the various objects of our thought, 
form another set of feelings, of course as various as the relations 
perceived. Conceptions and relations, — it is with these, and 
with these alone, that we are intellectually conversant. There 
is thus an evident ground for the arrangement of the internal 
suggestions, that form our trains of thought, under two heads,
-P-A-G-E-412
  390 THOMAS BROWN 
according as the feeling excited directly by some former feeling, 
may be either a simple conception, in its turn, perhaps, giving 
place to some other conception as transient; or may be, the 
feeling of a relation which two or more objects of our thought 
are considered by us as bearing to each other. There is, in 
short, in the mind, a capacity of association; or, as for reasons 
afterwards to be stated, I would rather term it, — the capacity 
of Simple Suggestion, — by which feelings formerly existing, 
are revived, in consequence of the mere existence of other feel- 
ings, as there is also a capacity of feeling resemblance, differ- 
ence, proportion, or relation in general, when two or more 
external objects, or two or more feelings of the mind itself, are 
considered by us, — which mental capacity, in distinction 
from the former, I would term the capacity of Relative Sugges- 
tion; and of these simple and relative suggestions, the whole of 
our intellectual trains of thought are composed. As I am no 
lover of new phrases, when the old can be used without danger 
of mistake, I would very willingly substitute for the phrase, 
relative suggestion, the term comparison, which is more familiar, 
and expresses very nearly the same meaning. But comparison, 
though it involve the feeling of relation, seems also to imply a 
voluntary seeking for some relation, which is far from necessary 
to the mere internal suggestion or feeling of the relation itself. 
The resemblance of two objects strikes me, indeed, when I am 
studiously comparing them; but it strikes me also, with not less 
force, on many other occasions, when I had not previously been 
forming the slightest intentional comparison. I prefer, there- 
fore, a term which is applicable alike to both cases, when a rela- 
tion is sought, and when it occurs, without any search or desire 
of finding it. 
The term judgment, in its strict philosophic sense, as the mere 
perception of relation, is more exactly synonymous with the 
phrase which I have employed, and might have been substi- 
tuted with safety, if the vulgar use of the term, in many vague 
significations, had not given some degree of indistinctness even 
to the philosophical use of it. I may remark, too, that in our 
works of logic and intellectual physiology, judgment and reason-
-P-A-G-E-413
  
PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN MIND 391 
ing are usually discussed separately, as if there were some es- 
sential difference of their nature; and, therefore, since I include 
them both, in the relative suggestions of which I shall after- 
wards have to treat, it seems advisable, not to employ for the 
whole, a name which is already appropriated, and very gener- 
ally limited, to a part. As the rise in the mind of the feeling of 
relation, from the mere perception or conception of objects, is 
however, what I mean to denote by the phrase Relative Sugges- 
tion; and as judgment, inits strictest sense, is nothing more than 
this feeling of relation, — or any two or more objects, consid- 
ered by us together, —I shall make no scruple to use the 
shorter and more familiar term, as synonymous when there can 
be no danger of its being misunderstood. 
The intellectual states of the mind, then, to give a brief illus- 
tration of my division, I consider as all referable to two generic 
susceptibilities, — those of Simple Suggestion and Relative Sug- 
gestion. Our perception or conception of one object excites, of 
itself, and without any known cause, external to the mind, the 
conception of some other object, as when the mere sound of our 
friend’s name, suggests to us the conception of our friend him- 
self, — in which case, the conception of our friend, which fol- 
lows the perception of the sound, involves no feeling of any 
common property with the sound which excites it, but is pre- 
cisely the same state of mind, which might have been induced, 
by various other previous circumstances, by the sight of the 
chair on.which he sat, — of the book which he read to us, — of 
the landscape which he painted. This is Simple Suggestion. 
But, together with this capacity of Simple Suggestion, by 
which conception after conception arises in the mind, — pre- 
cisely in the same manner, and in the same state, as each 
might have formed a part of other trains, and in which the par- 
ticular state of mind that arises by suggestion does not neces- 
sarily involve any consideration of the state of mind which pre- 
ceded it, — there is a suggestion of a very different sort, which 
in every case involves the consideration, not of one phenome- 
non of mind, but of two or more phenomena, and which con- 
stitutes the feeling of agreement, disagreement, or relation of
-P-A-G-E-414
  302 THOMAS BROWN 
some sort. I perceive, for example, a horse and a sheep at the 
same moment. The perception of the two is followed by that 
different state of mind which constitutes the feeling of their 
agreement in certain respects, or of their disagreement in cer- 
tain other respects. I think of the square of the hypotenuse of a 
right-angled triangle, and of the squares of the two other sides; 
— I feel the relation of equality. I see a dramatic representa- 
tion; I listen to the cold conceits which the author of the trag- 
edy, in his omnipotent command over warriors and lovers of his 
own creation, gives to his hero, in his most impassioned situa- 
tions; — I am instantly struck with their unsuitableness to the 
character and the circumstances. All the intellectual succes- 
sions of feeling, in these cases, which constitute the perception 
of relation, differ from the results of simple suggestion in neces- 
sarily involving the consideration of two or more objects or 
affections of mind, that immediately preceded them. I may 
think of my friend, in the case of simple suggestion, — that is 
to say, my mind may exist in the state which constitutes the 
conception of my friend, without that previous state which 
constitutes the perception of the sound of his name; for the 
conception of him may be suggested by various objects and 
remembrances. But I cannot in the cases of relative suggestion, 
think of the resemblance of a horse and a sheep; of the propor- 
tion of the squares of the sides of a right-angled triangle; or of 
the want of the truth of nature in the expressions of a dramatic 
hero, without those previous states of mind, which constitute 
the conceptions of a horse and a sheep — of the sides of the 
triangle, — or of the language of the warrior or lover, and the 
circumstances of triumph, or hope, or despair, in which he is 
exhibited to us by the creative artist. 
With these two capacities of suggested feelings, simple and 
relative, which are all that truly belong to the class of intel- 
lectual states of the mind, — various emotions may concur, par- 
ticularly that most general of all emotions, the emotion of 
desire, in some one or other of its various forms. According as 
this desire does or does not concur with them, the intellectual 
states themselves appear to be different; and, by those who do
-P-A-G-E-415
  PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN MIND 393 
not make the necessary analysis, are supposed, therefore, to be 
indicative of different powers. By simple suggestion, the 
images of things, persons, events, pass in strange and rapid 
succession; and a variety of names, expressive of different 
powers, — conception, association, memory, —have been 
given to this one simple law of our intellectual nature. But, 
when we wish to remember some object; that is to say, when 
we wish our mind to be affected in that particular manner, 
which constitutes the conception of a particular thing, or per- 
son, or event, — or when we wish to combine new images, in 
some picture of fancy, this co-existence of desire, with the 
simple course of suggestion, which continues still to follow its 
own laws, as much as when no desire existed with it, — seems 
to render the suggestion itself different; and recollection, and 
imagination, or fancy, which are truly, as we shall afterwards 
find, nothing more than the union of the suggested conceptions 
with certain specific permanent desires, are to us, as it were, 
distinct additional powers of our mind, and are so arranged in 
the systems of philosophers, who have not made the very sim- 
ple analysis, which alone seems to be necessary for a more pre- 
cise arrangement. 
In like manner, those suggestions of another class, which 
constitute our notions of proportion, resemblance, difference, 
and all the variety of relations, may arise, when we have had 
no previous desire of tracing the relations, or may arise after 
that previous desire. But, when the feelings of relation seem to 
us to arise spontaneously, they are not in themselves different 
from the feelings of relation, that arise, in our intentional com- 
parisons or judgments, in the longest series of ratiocination. 
Of such ratiocination, they are truly the most important ele- 
ments. The permanent desire of discovering something un- 
known, or of establishing, or confuting, or illustrating, some 
point of belief or conjecture, may co-exist, indeed, with the con- 
tinued series of relations that are felt, but does not alter the 
nature of that law, by which these judgments, or relative sug- 
gestions, succeed each other. 
There is no power to be found, but only the union of certain
-P-A-G-E-416
  394 THOMAS BROWN 
intellectual states of the mind, with certain desires, — a species 
of combination not more wonderful in itself, than any other 
complex mental state, as when we, at the same moment, see 
and smell a rose, — or listen to the voice of a friend, who has 
been long absent from us, and see, at the same moment, that 
face of affection, which is again giving confidence to our heart, 
and gladness to our very eyes. 
Our intellectual states of mind, then, are either those resem- 
blances of past affections of the mind, which arise by simple 
suggestion, or those feelings of relation, which arise by what I 
have termed relative suggestions, — the one set resulting, in- 
deed, from some prior states of the mind, but not involving, 
necessarily, any consideration of these previous states of mind, 
which suggested them, — the other set, necessarily involving 
the consideration of two or more objects, or two or more affec- 
tions of mind, as subjects of the relation which is felt.

PART FIRST. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES 
CHAPTER I. THE CONDITION OF CONCEPTS, 
WHEN THEY ACT AS FORCES 
to. CONCEPTS become forces when they resist one another. 
This resistance occurs when two or more opposed concepts 
encounter one another. 
At first let us take this proposition as simply as possible. In 
this connection, therefore, we shall not think of complex nor of 
compound concepts of any kind whatever; nor of such as indi- 
cate an object with several characteristics, neither of anything 
in time nor space, but of entirely simple concepts or sensations 
—e.g., red, blue, sour, sweet, etc. It is not our purpose to con- 
sider the general notions of the above-mentioned sensations, 
but to consider such representations as may result from an 
instantaneous act of sense-perception. 
Again, the question concerning the origin of the sensations 
mentioned does not belong here, much less has the discussion 
to do with the consideration of anything else that might have 
previously existed or occurred in the soul. 
The proposition as it stands is that opposed concepts resist 
one another. Concepts that are not opposed — e.g., a tone and 
a color — may exist, in which case it will be assumed that such

concepts offer no resistance to one another. (Exceptions to this 
latter proposition may occur, of which more hereafter.) 
Resistance is an expression of force. To the resisting con- 
cept, however, its action is quite accidental; it adjusts itself to 
the attack which is mutual among concepts, and which is deter- 
mined by the degree of opposition existing between them. This 
opposition may be regarded as that by which they are affected 
collectively. In themselves, however, concepts are not forces. 
11. Now, what is the result of the resistance mentioned? 
Do concepts partially or wholly destroy one another, or, not- 
withstanding the resistance, do they remain unchanged? 
Destroyed concepts are the same as none at all. However, if, 
notwithstanding the mutual attack, concepts remain un- 
changed, then one could not be removed or suppressed by an- 
other (as we see every moment that they are). Finally, if all 
that is conceived of each concept were changed by the contest, 
then this would signify nothing more than, at the beginning, 
quite another concept had been present in consciousness. 
The presentation (concept), then, must yield without being 
destroyed —i.e., the real concept is changed into an effort to 
present itself. 
Here it is in effect stated that, as soon as the hindrance 
yields, the concept by its own effort will again make its appear- 
ance in consciousness. In this lies the possibility (although not 
for all cases the only ground) of reproduction. 
12. When a concept becomes not entirely, but only in part, 
transformed into an effort, we must guard against considering 
this part as a severed portion of the whole concept. It has cer- 
tainly a definite magnitude (upon the knowledge of which 
much depends), but this magnitude indicates only a degree of 
the obscuration of the whole concept. If the question be in 
regard to several parts of one and the same concept, these parts 
must not be regarded as different, severed portions, but the 
smaller divisions may be regarded as being contained in the 
larger. The same is true of the remainders after the collisions 
—i.e., of those parts of a concept which remain unobscured, 
for those parts are also degrees of the real concept.

CHAPTER II. EQUILIBRIUM AND MOVEMENT OF 
CONCEPTS 
13. WHEN a sufficiency of opposition exists between con- 
cepts, the latter are in equilibrium. They come only gradually 
to this point. The continuous change of their degree of obscura- 
tion may be called their movement. 
The statics and mechanics of the mind have to do with the 
calculation of the equilibrium and movement of the concepts. 
14. All investigations into the statics of the mind begin with 
two different quantitative factors, viz., the sum (or the aggre- 
gate amount) of the resistances and the ratio of their limita- 
tion. The former is the quantity which rises from their en- 
counter, to be divided between the opposing concepts. If one 
knows how to state it, and knows also the ratio in which the dif- 
ferent, concepts yield in the encounter, then, by a simple calcu- 
lation in proportion, the statical point of each concept — i.e., 
the degree of its obscuration in equilibrium — may be found. 
15. The sum as well as the ratio of the mutual limitation 
depends upon the strength of each individual concept which is 
affected in inverse ratio to its strength, and upon the degree of 
opposition between the two concepts. For their influence upon 
each other stands in direct ratio to the strength of each. 
The principle determining the sum of the mutual limitation 
is, that it shall be considered as small as possible, because all 
concepts strive against suppression, and certainly submit to no 
more of it than is absolutely necessary. 
16. By actual calculation, the remarkable result is obtained 
that, in the case of the two concepts, the one never entirely 
obscures the other, but, in the case of three or more, one is very 
easily obscured, and can be made as ineffective — notwith- 
standing its continuous struggle — as if it were not present at 
all. Indeed, this obscuration may happen to a large number of 
concepts as well as to one, and may be effected through the 
agency of two, and even through the combined influence of 
concepts less strong than those which are suppressed. 
Here the expression “threshold of consciousness” must be
-P-A-G-E-420
  398 | JOHANN FRIEDRICH HERBART 
explained, as we shall have occasion to use it. A concept is in 
consciousness in so far as it is not suppressed, but is an actual 
representation. When it rises out of a condition of complete 
suppression, it enters into consciousness. Here, then, it is on 
the threshold of consciousness. It is very important to deter- 
mine by calculation the degree of strength which a concept 
must attain in order to be able to stand beside two or more 
stronger ones exactly on the threshold of consciousness, so that, 
at the slightest yielding of the hindrance, it would begin to rise 
into consciousness. 
Nore. — The expression ‘A concept is in consciousness’? must 
be distinguished from that, “I am conscious of my concept.” To the 
latter belongs inner perception; to the former not. In psychology, 
we need a word that will indicate the totality of all simultaneous 
actual presentations. No word except consciousness can be found 
for this purpose. 
Here we are obliged to be content with a circumlocution — and 
this all the more, because the inner perception which is usually 
attributed to consciousness has no fixed limit where it begins or 
ceases, and, moreover, the act of perceiving is not itself perceived; 
so that, since we are not conscious of it in ourselves, we must exclude 
it from consciousness, although it is an active knowing, and in no 
way a restricted or suppressed concept. 
17. Among the many, and, for the most part, very compli- 
cated laws underlying the movement of concepts, the following 
is the simplest: 
While the arrested portion (Hemmungssumme) of the concept 
sinks, the sinking part is at every moment proportional to the 
part unsuppressed. 
By this it is possible to calculate the whole course of the sink- 
ing even to the statical point. 
Nore. — Mathematically, the above law may be expressed: 
o=S hog ‘) in which S=the aggregate amount suppressed, 
t= the time elapsed during the encounter, « = the suppressed portion 
of all the concepts in the time indicated by ¢.
-P-A-G-E-421
A TEXT BOOK IN PSYCHOLOGY 399 
As the latter quantity is apportioned among the individual con- 
cepts, it is found that those which fall directly beneath the statical 
threshold (16) are very quickly driven thence, while the rest do not 
reach exactly their statical point in any given finite time. On ac- 
count of this latter circumstance, the concepts in the mind of a man 
of most equable temperament are, while he is awake, always in a 
state of gentle motion. This is also the primary reason why the inner 
perception never meets an object which holds it quite motionless. 
18. When to several concepts already near equilibrium a 
new one comes, a movement arises which causes them to sink 
for a short time beneath their statical point, after which they 
quickly and entirely of themselves rise again — something as a 
liquid, when an object is thrown into it, first sinks and then 
rises. In this connection several remarkable circumstances 
occur: 
19. First, upon an occasion of this kind, one of the older con- 
cepts may be removed entirely out of consciousness even by a 
new concept that is much weaker than itself. In this case, how- 
ever, the striving of the suppressed concept is not to be consid- 
ered wholly ineffective, as shown above (see 16); it works with 
all its force against the concepts in consciousness. Although its 
object is not conceived, it produces a certain condition of con- 
sciousness. The way in which these concepts are removed out 
of consciousness and yet are effective therein may be indicated 
by the expression, “They are on the mechanical threshold.” 
The threshold mentioned above (16) is called for the sake of 
distinction the statical threshold. 
Nore. — If the concepts on the statical threshold acted in the 
same way as on the mechanical threshold we should find ourselves 
in a state of the most intolerable uneasiness, or rather the body 
would be subjected to a condition of tension that must in a few 
moments prove fatal, even as under present conditions sudden fright 
will sometimes cause death; for all the concepts which, as we are 
accustomed to say, the memory preserves, and which we well know 
can upon the slightest occasion be reproduced, are in a state of 
incessant striving to rise, although the condition of consciousness is 
not at all affected by them. 
   
-P-A-G-E-422
  4oo JOHANN FRIEDRICH HERBART 
20. Second, the time during which one or more concepts 
linger upon the mechanical threshold can be extended if a series 
of new, although weaker, concepts come in succession to them. 
Every employment to which we are unaccustomed puts us in 
this condition. The earlier concepts are pressed back of the 
later ones. The former, however, because they are the stronger, 
remain tense, affect the physical organism more and more, and 
finally make it necessary that the employment cease, when the 
old concepts immediately rise, and we experience what is called 
a feeling of relief which depends in part upon the physical 
organism, although the first cause is purely psychological. 
21. Third, when several concepts are driven in succession to 
the mechanical threshold, several sudden successive changes in 
the laws of reciprocal movements arise. 
In this way is to be explained the fact that the course of our 
thoughts is so often inconsequent, abrupt, and apparently irre- 
gular. This appearance deceives in the same way as the wan- 
dering of the planets. The conformity to law in the human 
mind resembles exactly that in the firmament. 
Nore. — As a counterpart to the concepts which sink simul- 
taneously are to be observed those which rise simultaneously, 
especially when they rise free —i.e., when a restricting environ- 
ment or a general pressure suddenly disappears. With the rising 
the amount of suppression increases. Hence, in the case of three, 
one may be, as it were, bent back, and under certain conditions 
may sink quite to the threshold. Their elevation is greater than 
the depression to which, sinking together, they would have pressed 
one another, because in sinking the sum of their mutual limitation 
depends upon the total strength, which in the gradual rising is 
not the case. 
CHAPTER III. COMPLICATIONS AND BLENDINGS 
22. THE easily conceivable metaphysical reason why op-~ 
posed concepts resist one another is the unity of the soul, of 
which they are the self-preservations. This reason explains with- 
out difficulty the combination of our concepts (which combina-
-P-A-G-E-423
  
A TEXT BOOK IN PSYCHOLOGY  4or 
tion is known to exist). If, on account of their opposition, they 
did not suppress one another, all concepts would compose but 
one act of.one soul; and, indeed, in so far as they are not divided 
into a manifold by any kind of arrests whatever, they really con- 
stitute but one act. Concepts that are on the threshold of con- 
sciousness can not enter into combination with others, as they 
are completely transformed into effort directed against other 
definite concepts, and are thereby, as it were, isolated. In con- 
sciousness, however, concepts combine in two ways: First, con- 
cepts which are not opposed or contrasted with one another (as 
a tone and a color) so far as they meet unhindered, form a com- 
plex; second, contrasted concepts [e.g., red and yellow], in so far 
as they are effected neither by accidental foreign concepts nor 
by unavoidable opposition, become blended (fused). 
Complexes may be complete; blendings (fusions) from their 
nature must always be (more or less) incomplete. 
Nore. — Of such complexes as are partially or almost complete, 
we have remarkable instances in the concepts of things with several 
characteristics and of words used as signs of thoughts. In the 
mother-tongue the latter, words and thoughts, are so closely con- 
nected that it would appear that we think by means of words. 
(Concerning both examples more hereafter.) Among the blendings 
are especially remarkable, partly those which include in themselves 
an esthetic relation (which, taken psychologically, is created at the 
same time with the blending), partly those which involve succession, 
in which serial forms have their origin. 
23. That which is complicated or blended out of several con- 
cepts furnishes an aggregate of force, and for this reason works 
according to quite other statical and mechanical laws than 
those according to which the individual concepts would have 
acted. Also the thresholds of consciousness change according 
to the complex or blending (fusion), so that on account of a 
combination a concept of the very weakest kind may be able to 
remain and exert an influence in consciousness. 
Note 1.— The computation for complexes and blendings de- 
pends upon the same principles as that for simple concepts; it is, 
 
-P-A-G-E-424
  
  402 JOHANN FRIEDRICH HERBART 
however, much more intricate, especially for the reason that in the 
case of incomplete combinations the forces as well as their arrests 
are only partially interwoven with one another (and do not fully 
enter as factors into the product). 
Nore 2. — Combinations of concepts consist not only of two or 
three members, but they often contain many members in very un- 
equal degrees of complication, or blending, in which case no calcula- 
tion can estimate the multiplicity. Nevertheless, from the latter, 
the simplest cases may be chosen and the more intricate ones esti- 
mated according to them. For every science the simplest laws are 
the most important. 
24. Problem: After an encounter between two concepts, P 
and I, the remainders, r and p, are blended (or incompletely 
united). The problem is to indicate what help one of the two 
concepts, in case it should be still more suppressed, would 
receive from the other. 
Nore. — Solution : Let P be the helping concept; it helps with a 
force equal to 7, but I can only appropriate this force in the ratio of 
5 rp “ p:II. Hence through P, II receives the help jj, and in the same way 
P receives from II the help oe 
The proof lies immediately in the analysis of the ideas. It is 
plain that the two remainders, 7 and p, taken together, deter- 
mine the degree of union between the two concepts. One of 
them is the helping force; the other, compared with the con- 
cept to which it belongs, is to be considered as a fraction of the 
whole; and, of the totality of help which could be rendered by 
the first remainder, it yields that portion which here attains 
efficient activity. 
25. The following principles may be observed here: 
a. Beyond the point of union no help extends its influence. 
If the concept I has more clearness in consciousness than the 
remainder p indicates, then by striving of the concept P, which 
might come to the help of the former, already more than 
enough has been done; hence for the present it exerts no more 
influence.
-P-A-G-E-425
  A TEXT BOOK IN PSYCHOLOGY — 403 
b. The farther the one of the concepts is below the point of 
union, so much the more effectively does the other help. 
Nore. — This gives the following differential equation: 
  rp po 5 _ Tp ved, 
= : —rt 
whence by integration o=p ( ae ay 
This equation contains the germ of manifold investigations 
which penetrate the whole of psychology. It is indeed so simple 
that it can never really occur in the human soul, but all investiga- 
tions into applied mathematics begin with such simple presupposi- 
tions as only exist in abstraction — e.g., the mathematical lever, 
or the laws of bodies falling in a vacuum. Here merely the influence 
of the help is considered, which, if everything depended upon it 
alone, would bring into consciousness during the time ¢ a quantity 
w from 11. Besides, if we take into consideration the single circum- 
stance that [1 meets with an unavoidable arrest from other con- 
cepts, then the calculation becomes so complicated that it can be 
only approximately solved by an integration of the following form: 
Bw=ad?wdt + bduwdl? +cwdt3, 
It is self-evident that it much more nearly expresses the facts 
which are to be observed experimentally. 
26. The foregoing contains the foundation of the theory of 
mediate reproduction, which, according to ordinary language, 
is derived from the association of ideas or concepts. Before pur- 
suing this further we must mention immediate reproduction — 
i.e., that reproduction which by its own force follows upon the 
yielding of the hindrances. The ordinary case is that a concept 
gained by a new act of perception causes the old concept of the 
same or of a similar object to rise into consciousness. This 
occurs when the concept furnished by the new act of perception 
presses back everything present in consciousness opposed to 
the old concept, which is similar to the new one. Then, without 
further difficulty, the old concept rises of itself. From this are 
to be observed the following conditions, which are to be found 
by calculation, of which, however, no idea can be given here: 
 
-P-A-G-E-426
  
404 JOHANN FRIEDRICH HERBART 
a. In the beginning the rising is in proportion to the square 
of the time, if the new act of perception occurs suddenly; but to 
the cube of the time, if the latter (as is usual) is formed by a 
gradual and lingering act of apprehension. 
b. The course of the rising is adjusted principally to the 
strength of the concept furnished by the new act of perception 
in proportion to the opposing one which it has pressed back; but 
the individual strength of the rising concept only has influence 
under special conditions. It can, as it were, only use this 
strength in the free space which is given to it. 
c. The rising concept blends as such with the concept, similar 
to it, furnished by the new act of perception. Since it does not 
rise entirely, however, the blending is incomplete. 
d. The fact that immediate reproduction is not limited 
entirely to the old concept of exactly the same kind, but ex- 
tends to the more or less similar so far as to receive partial free- 
dom from the new act of perception, is of special importance. 
The whole reproduction may be indicated by the name of 
vaulting (or arching). In the case of a long duration, or of a fre- 
quent repetition of a new act of perception, a second important 
process, which we call tapering (or pointing), follows. The pe- 
culiarity of this latter consists in the fact that the concepts 
which are less similarare again arrested by the concepts received 
through the new act of perception, as the old concepts bring 
with them into consciousness others which are opposed to the 
new, so that finally the concept that is entirely homogeneous 
finds itself alone favored, and forms, as it were, a tapering sum- 
mit where the highest point of the vault (or arch) was hereto- 
fore. 
27. Where the circumstances allow, with this immediate 
reproduction is united that mediate reproduction mentioned in 
25. The concept P, mentioned above, is reproduced immedi- 
ately (i.e., without the mediation of others), then the free space 
allowed it may be regarded as that r (spoken of in 25) or as a 
force which strives to raise the II blended with it to its point of 
blending p. 
 
-P-A-G-E-427

Nore. — As the free space gradually increasing (and again 
decreasing) is given, we must for the present observation regard 
. —r 4 “ 4 7 in the formula w=p (2h : 4) as a variable quantity, and indeed 
as a function of that quantity upon which the propositions in 26 
depend. 
28. The most important applications of the previous theories 
are, if with different remainders r, 7’, r’’, etc., of one and the 
same concept P several II, II’, Il”, etc., are united, by which, for 
the sake of brevity, we may assume the remainders of the lat- 
ter, viz., p, p’, p’””, to be equal; also, I, II’, etc., may be equal. 
A concept acts upon several united with it in the same series 
according to the time in which its remainders (by which it is united 
with those others according to quantity) stand. 
Nore. — In order to avoid diffuseness, this most important law 
is here only very incompletely expressed in words. We recognize it 
better and more clearly in the formula given: o=p ae if 
instead of one r we substitute different smaller and greater, 7, 7’, r’’, 
etc. But the more exact calculation mentioned in 25 shows that the 
II, I’, 11”, etc., blended with them, not only rise, but sink again, as 
it were, to make place for each other, in and the order of r, 7’, r’’, etc. 
29. Here is discovered the ground of the genuine reproduc- 
tion or of memory so far as it brings to us a series of concepts 
in the same order in which they were first received. In order to 
comprehend this, we must consider what union arises among 
several concepts that are successively given. 
Let a series, a, b, c, d, be given by perception; then, from the 
first movement of the perception and during its continuance, a 
is exposed to an arrest from other concepts already in conscious- 
ness. In the mean time, a, already partially sunken in con- 
sciousness, became more and more obscured when b came to it. 
This } at first, unobscured, blended with the sinking a; then 
followed c, which itself unobscured, united with 6, which was 
becoming obscured, and also with a, which was still more 
obscured. Similarly followed d, to become united in different 
 
-P-A-G-E-428
    406 JOHANN FRIEDRICH HERBART 
degrees with a, 6, c. From this arises a law for each of these 
concepts that states how, after the whole series has been, for a 
time, removed out of consciousness, upon the re-emergence of 
one of the concepts of such a series into consciousness, every 
other concept of the same series is called up. Let it be assumed 
that a rises first, then it is united more with 8, less with c, and 
still less with d; backward, however, 0, c, and d are blended 
collectively in an unobscured condition with the remainders of 
a; hence a seeks to bring them all again into an unobscured 
condition [i.e., into full consciousness]. But @ acts the most 
quickly and strongly upon 6, more slowly upon c¢, still more 
slowly upon d, etc., by which close investigation shows that 6 
sinks again, while c rises, even as c sinks when d rises; in short, 
the series follows in the same order as first given. On the con- 
trary, let us assume that c is originally reproduced, then c acts 
upon d and the following members of the series exactly in the 
same way as was indicated in the case of a —i.e., the series 
c, d, etc., unfolds gradually in the order of its succession. On 
the contrary, b and a experience quite another influence. The 
unobscured c was blended with their different remainders. 
Then c acts upon them with its whole strength, and without 
delay, but only to call back the remainders of a and b united with 
it, to bring a part of 6 and a smaller part of a into consciousness. 
Thus it happens that when we remember something in the mid- 
dle of a known series, the preceding part of the series presents 
itself all at once in a lessened degree of clearness, while the por- 
tion following comes before the mind in the same order as the 
series it brings with it. But the series never runs backward; an 
anagram from a well-comprehended word never originates 
without intentional effort. 
30. Several series may cross one another, e.g., a, b, c, d, e, and 
a, Bc, 8, €, in which c is common to the two series. If c were 
reproduced alone, it would strive to call up d and ¢ as well as 
and ¢. If, however, 6 comes into consciousness first, then the 
first series comes decidedly forward on account of the united 
help of 6 and ¢, yet the oppositions among the members of both 
series, in this case, have each their own influence.
-P-A-G-E-429
  A TEXT BOOK IN PSYCHOLOGY —§ 407 
We may remark that, to the simple type or model here given, 
a variety of complicated psychological occurrences may be 
adjusted. The same c can be held as the common point of inter- 
section for many hundred series. On account of the manifold 
oppositions in these series, the common c may cause none of the 
members to rise perceptibly, but so soon as 6 and a come for- 
ward, determining c more closely, the indecision will disappear, 
and the uppermost series will really come before the mind. 
31. The foregoing depends upon the difference presupposed 
in the remainders 7, 7’, r’’, etc. (28). But in order that this dif- 
ference may have its influence, the concept to which these re- 
mainders belong must come forward sufficiently into conscious- 
ness. Let it be granted that it is arrested to such a degree that 
its active representation amounts to no more than that of the 
smallest among the remainders 7, r’, r’’, etc., then it works 
equally on the whole series of concepts blended with it so that 
a vague total impression of all comes into consciousness. The 
reason for this is explained in sections 27 and 12. The re- 
mainders are not different parts severed from one and the same 
concept; hence if a little of the latter is in consciousness, we 
must not first question whether this little may be one and per- 
haps quite the smallest among those remainders, but we must 
assume that it really is so, although at the same time it may be 
a part of every other greater remainder. If the active concept 
gradually rises into consciousness, then the remainders, from 
the smaller to the greater, one after the other, gain a special 
law of action. By this the above vague impression of the 
whole rises, in which lies a whole series of concepts, and 
these are gradually developed out of one another. 
Nore. — Here, among others, must be compared the phenomena 
resulting from exercise and skill; that, moreover, not every course 
of thought repeats faithfully the series constructed; and upon that 
is based, in part, the ground of the inequalities in the quantities II 
and p (25), with whose possible difference we can not deal further 
here. Additional facts may be deduced from the following. 
32. If free-rising concepts (of which mention was made in 
the closing remarks of the last chapter) should blend in regular 
 
-P-A-G-E-430
  408 JOHANN FRIEDRICH HERBART 
gradation, they would be subject to other laws of reproduction 
which originate out of the blending, and are distinguished and 
determined according to their differences. Upon occasion, like- 
wise arises a process of construction and formation of series 
which differ from the form of analogous concepts in case the 
latter are given and then sink out of consciousness. From this 
may be explained the conflict between things as we perceive 
them and as we think them, as well as the tendency to regard 
them otherwise than as they first present themselves; conse- 
quently the modifying action of the self-activity upon that 
which lies before the perception. This may be observed espe- 
cially in the case of children who can have no set purpose in 
the matter. 
CHAPTER IV. CONCEPTS AS THE SOURCE 
OF MENTAL STATES 
33. ONE of the objections against mathematical psychology 
is that mathematics defines only quantity, while psychology 
must especially consider quality. It is now time to meet this 
objection, and to collect the explanations of those mental states 
which the foregoing presents. 
Here we must first remark that the peculiar striving of con- 
cepts for representation (11) never appears immediately in con- 
sciousness, for, just so far as concepts change into striving, they 
are removed out of consciousness. Also, the gradual sinking of 
concepts can not be perceived. A special instance of this is, 
that no one is able to observe his own falling asleep. 
So far as it represents or conceives, the soul is called mind; 
so far as it feels and desires, it is called the heart or disposition 
(Gemiith.) The disposition of the heart, however, has its source in 
the mind — in other words, feeling and desiring are conditions, 
and, for the most part, changeable conditions of concepts. The 
emotions indicate this, while experience, upon the whole, con- 
firms it: the man feels little of the joys and sorrows of his 
youth; but what the boy learns correctly, the graybeard still 
knows. The extent, however, to which a steadfast disposition
-P-A-G-E-431
  A TEXT BOOK IN PSYCHOLOGY 409 
and, above all, character can be given, will be shown later in the 
explanations of the principles above presented. 
34. First, there is a blending of concepts not only after the 
arrest (22), but quite a different one before it, provided the 
degree of opposition (15) be sufficiently small. A principle of 
zsthetic judgment lies in this. Pleasant feelings in their nar- 
rowest sense, together with their opposites, must be regarded as 
analogous to these esthetic judgments —i.e., as springing 
from the relation of many concepts which do not assert them- 
selves individually, but rather which perhaps, for psychological 
reasons, can not be perceived when separated. 
Note. —In carrying out this investigation, the series of tone 
relations upon which music depends may be presented as a subject 
of experiment. Among simple tones, the degree of arrest (the inter- 
val of tones), entirely alone and without means, determines the 
esthetic character of its relation. It is also certain that the psycho- 
logical explanation (widely different from the acoustical) of all har- 
mony is to be sought in the difference between the degrees of arrest, 
and that it must be found there. The necessary calculations for this 
are, for the most part, to be found in the second volume of the Kénigs- 
berg Archives for Philosophy. Of the somewhat extensive investiga- 
tions, only the principal ones which experience decidedly confirms 
can be given here: 
When the forces, into which concepts, through their similarity 
and their contrasts, separate one another, are equally strong, there 
arises disharmony. If, however, one of these forces be opposed to 
the others in such a relation that it is driven to the statical thres- 
hold (16) by them, then a harmonious relation will prevail. 
35- Second, a principle of contrast is to be found in the com- 
plexes (22), which we here consider complete. The complexes 
a+a and 6+ are similar, provided a:a=b:f; if not, they 
are dissimilar. Let the degree of arrest between a and b equal p, 
and that between a and B equal 7. Now, if in similar com- 
plexes, =7r, then, and then only, will the individual concepts 
be arrested, exactly as if they had not been in any combina- 
tion; also no feeling of contrast arises, inasmuch as the arrest is 
successful only when the opposing forces bring the feeling of  
-P-A-G-E-432
  410 JOHANN FRIEDRICH HERBART 
contrast with them; but, in every variation from the case pre- 
sented, the less opposed concepts are affected by their com- 
bination with the other two, but in this very way a part of the 
arrest will be withheld from the latter; consequently, notwith- 
standing the opposition, something remains in consciousness 
that resists, and in this lies the feeling of contrast. If 7< p, 
then the contrast between a and 0 will be felt, not that between 
a and B. If w>>, the case is reversed. When 7 =O, the con- 
trast between a and 6 is the greatest. 
36. Third, a complex a+a is reproduced by a concept furn- 
ished by a new act of perception similar to a (26). Now, when 
a, on account of its combination with a, comes forward, it 
meets in consciousness a concept opposed to it, B. Then a will 
be at the same time, driven forward and held back. In this situa- 
tion, it is the source of an unpleasant feeling which may give 
tise to desire, viz., for the object represented by a provided 
the opposition offered by @ is weaker than the force which 
a brings with it. 
This is ordinarily the case; desires are excited by a remem- 
brance of their object. When the remembrance is strengthened 
by several incidental concepts, the impulses of desire are re- 
newed. As often as the opposing concepts (i.e., concepts of the 
hindrances which stand in the way of the longing) attain pre- 
ponderance, they produce a painful feeling of privation. 
37. Fourth, a concept comes forward into consciousness by 
its own strength (perhaps reproduced according to the method 
described in 26), at the same time being called forward by 
several helping concepts (24). Since each of these helps has its 
own measure of time in which it acts (according to the formula 
in 25), then the helps may strengthen one another against a pos- 
sible resistance, but they can ngt increase their own velocity. 
The movement in advancing takes place only with that velo- 
city which is the greatest among several concepts meeting to- 
gether, but it is favored by all the rest. This favoring is part of the 
process which takes place in consciousness, but in no way is it 
anything represented or conceived. Hence it can only be called 
a feeling — without doubt a feeling of pleasure. 
 
-P-A-G-E-433
A TEXT BOOK IN PSYCHOLOGY § 411 
Here is the source of the cheerful disposition, especially of 
joy in successful activity. Here belong various movements, 
instigated from without, which do not accelerate but favor one 
another as in the case of dancing and music. Of the same char- 
acter is the action according to several centering motives, and 
such too is the insight based on understanding several reasons 
which confirm one another. 
38. In general, it may be observed that feelings and desires 
have not their source in the process or act of conception in gen- 
eral, but always in certain particular concepts. Hence there 
may be at the same time many different feelings and desires, 
and these may either agree or entirely disagree one with the 
other. 
CHAPTER V. THE CO-OPERATION OF SEVERAL 
MASSES OF CONCEPTS OF UNEQUAL STRENGTH 
39. From the foregoing, it may, in a way, be perceived that 
after a considerable number of concepts in all kinds of combina- 
tions is present, every new act of perception must work as an 
excitant by which some will be arrested, others called forward 
and strengthened, progressing series interrupted or set again in 
motion, and this or that mental state occasioned. These mani- 
festations must become more complex if, as is usual, the con- 
cept received by the new act of perception contains in itself a 
multiplicity or variety, that at the same time enables it to hold 
its place in several combinations and series, and gives them a 
fresh impulse which brings them into new relations of opposi- 
tion or blending with one another. By this, the concepts 
brought by the new act of perception are assimilated to the 
older concepts in such a way as to suffer somewhat after the 
first excitation has worked to the extent of its power, because 
the old concepts — on account of their combinations with one 
another — are much stronger than the new individuals which 
are added. 
40. If, however, already very strong complexes and blend- 
ings with many members have been formed, then the same rela- 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
  412 JOHANN FRIEDRICH HERBART 
tion which existed between the old and the new concepts may 
be repeated within between the old concepts. Weaker concepts, 
which, according to any kind of law, enter into consciousness, 
act as excitants upon those masses before mentioned, and are 
received and appropriated by them (apperceived) just as in the 
case of a new sense-impression; hence the inner perception is 
analogous to the outer. Self-consciousness is not the subject of 
discussion here, although it is very often combined with the 
above. ° 
41. In what has been said, lies that which experience con- 
firms, viz., that the inner perception is never a passive appre- 
hension, but always (even against the will) active. The apper- 
ceived concepts do not continue rising or sinking according to 
their own laws, but they are interrupted in their movements by 
the more powerful masses which drive back whatever is op- 
posed to them although it is inclined to rise; and in the case of 
that which is similar to them although it is on the point of sink- 
ing, they take hold of it and blend it with themselves. 
42. It is worth the trouble to indicate how far this difference 
among concepts — which we might be inclined to divide into 
dead and living — may be carried. 
Let us recall the concepts on the statical threshold (16). 
These are, indeed, in effect nothing less than dead; for, in the 
condition of arrest in which they stand, they are not able by 
their own effort to effect anything whatever [toward rising into 
consciousness]. Nevertheless, through the combination in 
which they stand, they may be reproduced, and, besides, they 
will often be driven back in whole heaps and series by those 
more powerful masses, as when the leaves of a book are turned 
hurriedly. 
43. If the apperceived concepts — or at least some of them 
— are not on the statical threshold, then the apperceiving con- 
cepts suffer some violence from them; also the latter may be 
subject to arrest from another side, in which case the inner per- 
ception is interrupted; through this, uncertainty and irresolu- 
tion may be explained. 
The apperceiving mass may be, in its turn apperceived by 
 
-P-A-G-E-435
A TEXT BOOK IN PSYCHOLOGY 413 
another mass; but for this to occur, there must be present 
several concept masses of distinctly different degrees of 
strength. Hence it is somewhat seldom that the inner percep- 
tion rises to this second power [the apperception of appercep- 
tion], and only in the case of philosophical ideas is this series 
considered as one which might be prolonged into infinity. 
CHAPTER VI. A GLANCE OVER THE CONNECTION 
BETWEEN BODY AND SOUL 
44. Up to the present chapter, concepts have been considered 
as present in the soul without any question concerning their 
origin or concerning foreign influences. This has been done for 
simplicity. Now, sense-perception in part and physiological 
influences in part, together with concepts already present, must 
be considered. 
45. Even from experience it may be assumed that each act 
of perception of any considerable strength requires a short 
space of time for its creation; but experience and meta- 
physics at the same time teach that by delaying longer, the 
strength of the perception in no way increases in proportion to 
the time, but, the stronger the perception already is, so much the 
less does it increase, and from this it follows, by an easy calcula- 
tion, that there is a final limit to its strength which the at- 
tained concept very soon reaches, and above which even by an 
infinite delay the same perception will not be able to rise. This 
is the law of diminishing susceptibility, and the strength of the 
sense-impression is quite indifferent in regard to this limit. The 
weakest sense-perception may give the concept quite as much 
strength as the strongest, only it requires for this a somewhat 
longer time. 
46. Every human concept really consists of infinitely small 
elementary apprehensions very unlike one another, which in 
the different moments of time during the continuance of the 
act of perception were created little by little. However, if dur- 
ing the continuance of the perception an arrest caused by old 
opposed concepts did not occur, these apprehensions would be 
 
-P-A-G-E-436
  414 JOHANN FRIEDRICH HERBART 
all necessarily blended into a single, undivided total force. For 
this reason the total force will be perceptibly less than the sum 
of all the elementary apprehensions. 
47. In early childhood a much larger supply of simple sense- 
concepts is generated than in all the following years. Indeed, 
the work of the after-years consists in making the greatest 
possible number of combinations from this supply. Although 
this susceptibility is never entirely extinguished, yet, if there 
were not a kind of renewal of it, the age of manhood would be 
more indifferent and more unfruitful in sense-impressions than 
it really is. 
Though concepts on the statical threshold are quite without 
influence for that which goes on in consciousness (16), they can 
not weaken the susceptibility to new perceptions similar to 
themselves. Hence this receptivity would be completely re- 
established if the earlier ratio of arrest were not quite changed 
by the new acts of perception, and a certain freedom to repro- 
duce themselves directly given to the older concepts (26). 
When this happens, the receptivity decreases. The greater the 
number of old concepts of the same kind present in conscious- 
ness — this means usually the longer one has lived — so much 
greater is the number of concepts which upon a given occasion 
enter at the same time into consciousness; and thus with years 
the renewal of receptivity diminishes. 
48. The above statements refer not only to concepts of 
exactly the same kind, but to all whose degree of opposition is a 
fraction. This can not be developed here, since in the foregoing 
nothing exact could be said of the difference between the degrees 
of opposition. 
49. It is to be especially observed that the influence of the 
body upon psychical manifestations is shown in three ways — 
its repression (Druck), its excitation (Resonanz), and its co- 
operation in action. Upon this are the following preliminary 
remarks: 
50. Physiological repression arises when the accompanying 
conditions, which should correspond to the changes in the soul, 
can not follow without hindrance; hence the hindrance will also 
 
-P-A-G-E-437
  A TEXT BOOK IN PSYCHOLOGY 415 
be felt as such in the soul because the conditions of each affect 
both. This repression is often merely a retarding force, to suit 
which the mental movements must proceed more slowly, as is 
the case with slow minds that consume time and are stupefied 
by quick changes. Often, however, repression is similar to an 
arresting force, and as such it can be mathematically calculated, 
as when it increases the number of opposed concepts by one or 
more. By it all active concepts may be driven to the statical 
threshold; and here we have the explanation of sleep. In this 
case it would be a deep and complete sleep. 
51. Physiological excitation (Resonanz) arises when the 
accompanying bodily conditions change more quickly or 
become stronger than would be necessary to merely cause no 
hindrance to the mental movements. Then the soul, again in 
response to the body, will act more quickly and more vigor- 
ously. The soul must also share the resulting relaxations of the 
body, as in intoxication and passion. 
52. The co-operation of the soul and body in external action 
can not originally proceed from the soul, for the will does not 
know in the least what influence it really exerts upon the nerves 
and muscles. But in the child exists an organic necessity for 
movement. At first the soul accompanies this and the active 
movements arising from it, with its feelings. The feelings, how- 
ever, become connected with perceptions of the members 
moved. If, in the result, the concept arising from such a percep- 
tion acts as a means of arousing desire (16), then the feeling 
connected with it arises, and to this latter as accompanying 
bodily condition belong all those phenomena in the nerves and 
muscles by which organic movement is actually determined or 
defined. Thus it happens that concepts come to appear as a 
source of mechanical forces in the outer world.

CHAPTER I. FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES OF 
PSYCHICAL DEVELOPMENT 
§ 22. First fundamental process. Sensations and perceptions 
are formed in the human soul in consequence of impressions 
or excitations which come to it from without. The usual 
view is that we receive the external impressions primarily 
through the bodily organs, and only thereafter do they pro- 
ceed to the soul by means of the nerves and of the brain. But 
of this our self-consciousness, which we have designated (§ 1) 
as the only fundamental source for psychological knowledge, 
gives no hint whatever. The excitation of the bodily organs 
presents itself to us as an effect concomitant with the formation 
of the sensory impressions, or as running parallel with it; and 
we must regard as a false inference if one endeavors in the man- 
ner indicated to place the same in causal connection therewith. 
There is no scientific justification (§ 47 ff.) for this assumption as 
it is ordinarily made. Furthermore nothing is in the least gained 
thereby for the doing away with the offensive dissimilarity be- 
tween external objects and the soul. For we are still even as 
little able to conceive how a psychical seeing, hearing, etc., can 
arise from a material vibration of the nerves, or of the brain, as 
how the soul itself can be immediately excited by external im- 
pressions into the formations of sensations. Let anatomy and

PSYCHOLOGY AS NATURAL SCIENCE 417 
physiology, therefore, explain and establish the results of 
observation in their domain. In psychology we hold firmly to 
the fact that our self-consciousness says nothing about any 
such mediation. 
§ 23. The creation of sensations and perceptions necessarily 
presupposes: (1) certain external elements (excitations, impres- 
sions) which are received and appropriated by our soul; and (2) 
certain inner forces, or faculties, by which it receives and ap- 
propriates these elements. These forces, which, like the excita- 
tions aforesaid, show themselves at the first glance to be mani- 
fold, or to form several characteristic systems, we style sensory 
faculties, just because they respond to external excitations; and, 
furthermore, we call them original faculties (Urvermégen) 
of the soul, in so far as we are unable to derive them from any- 
thing else. It is to be observed, however, that the sensory 
excitations so soon as they are received and appropriated are 
transformed likewise into psychical elements. We attribute to 
the sensory faculties in respect to this process a higher or 
lesser degree of sensitiveness to excitation. By means of this 
variable degree the extent of the excitation received, or the 
vividness of the sensation, is shown to be conditioned from 
within. 
§ 24. Second fundamental process. The human soul is con- 
stantly acquiring original faculties. Of this innermost life-pro- 
cess, by which alone the soul is able to continue its life, we ob- 
tain knowledge only from the fact, that from time to time the 
original faculties become exhausted. There is in other words an 
inability to form sensory perceptions, or to carry on activities, 
which demand new and original faculties, and these remain for 
a subsequent more or less extended use. As an explanation of 
this phenomenon the effect indicated proves to be the most 
plausible hypothesis. We cannot, indeed, determine more ex- 
actly the nature of this process, not merely because it wholly 
escapes consciousness, but also because among all other pro- 
cesses of which we are conscious there is none analogous to it. 
An indication of the circumstances under which this process 
occurs, and occurs more perfectly, we reserve for later consider- 
 
-P-A-G-E-440
    418 FRIEDRICH EDUARD BENEKE 
ation (§ 335) on account of this very obscurity, and in order 
to make use in fuller measure of the results of observation. 
§ 25. The original faculties are essentially volitions so long 
and so far as they have not as yet adopted excitation for their 
completion; that is to say, they strive for this fulfilment as for 
a complement intended for them by their nature. We also 
term this striving “tension.” This character appears especially 
in the uneasiness which develops if they have accumulated 
unused in rather a large number. This is an uneasiness which as 
experience shows can mount to any conceivable degree, and can 
lead even to despair of life and to suicide. Moreover, the use of 
the original faculties is by no means restricted to the formation 
of sensations and perceptions. On the contrary, attaching them- 
selves to inner formations they become effective for the same 
excitations and for achievements of the most varied sort. Es- 
pecially do they form in this way the fundamental active prin- 
ciple in all action as well as in all psychical products. 
§ 26. Third fundamental process. The combination of facul- 
ties and excitations, such as are originally grounded in sensa- 
tions and perceptions, and maintained in their reproductions, 
reveals sometimes a firmer and sometimes a less firm inter- 
penetration of these two classes of elements. A more accurate 
observation now teaches us, that when elements are less firmly 
united and therefore mobile, they can be transferred in the 
greatest variety of combinations from one psychical formation 
to another. In all psychical developments at every moment of 
our lives there is an active striving towards a balancing or 
equalizing of the mobile elements in them. In a preliminary 
way we may give as examples of this fact the increase of in- 
tensity, which all the operations of our mind experience through 
the emotions of joy, of enthusiasm, of love, of anger, etc.; as 
well as upon the other hand, the depressions of the same, 
through sorrow, fear, etc. 
§ 27. Our self-consciousness constantly exhibits a change, 
which sometimes mounts to an appalling variety and rapidity. 
But this change does not extend so far as at first glance it 
appears to do, and moreover chiefly effects only the excited
-P-A-G-E-441
  PSYCHOLOGY AS NATURAL SCIENCE 419 
state. For every psychical product that thus became formed in 
the human soul with any degree of perfection persists, even 
after it has disappeared from consciousness or from the sphere 
of excited psychical development, in the unconscious or inner 
being of the soul, out of which it can later enter into the con- 
scious psychical development or be reproduced. We term that 
which persists in an unconscious state, with reference to the 
psychical development which continues unconsciously to exist, 
“a trace’; and in reference to those developments which are 
either constructed upon this basis, or which proceed therefrom, 
“a rudiment.” (There is prefigured or predisposed in the same 
a presentation of imagination, a sensation, etc.) Every such 
trace consists therefore of two elements: faculty and excitation. 
§ 28. We know indeed these traces or rudiments only by 
means of the reproductions thereof. We are, nevertheless, per- 
fectly certain of them, because of the fact that these reproduc- 
tions, where no hindrance occurs, always take place not only 
qualitatively, but also quantitatively, in the strictest agree- 
ment with the earlier psychical formations. The kind of the 
excitation and the strength of the faculty (the two elements out 
of which every trace was formed) return to consciousness in the 
same way, as at their coalescence they conditioned the devel- 
opment of the trace. In fact, strictly speaking, even this per- 
sistence of the trace needs no explanation, since there is repre- 
sented in it only the universally evident fact, that what has 
once come into existence continues until it is destroyed through 
the agency of special causes. What. therefore, is here subject 
to explanation is not the continued subsistence, but only the 
transition into unconsciousness of what previously had been 
conscious; and this is easily comprehended from the aforesaid 
process of balancing. Inasmuch as the conscious developments 
balance or transfer in every direction, so far as an immediate 
combination takes place, those elements which are not firmly 
appropriated by them and are mobile, it follows, that such a 
depression must take place in them that they become uncon- 
scious forms or mere traces (§ 30). 
§ 29. In reference to the presentation of these traces, which, 
 
-P-A-G-E-442
  420 FRIEDRICH EDUARD BENEKE 
as they are essentially unconscious cannot be made immedi- 
ately by means of these themselves, we must hold absolutely to 
the effects which have led to their assumption. These traces 
hence have no actual place of existence. As is the soul: in 
general, so also all its parts are nowhere; for self consciousness, 
which is our single source of knowledge, contains with itself 
immediately, and by itself, (without the addition of perceptions 
of the external senses), nothing whatever of spatial relations. 
The traces are also united to no bodily organ. For the intuitive 
notions of space, and the transformations thereof, which run 
parallel to the psychical developments, are in the strictest 
sense merely parallel to them, that is to say, synchronous, or at 
best always synchronous. They can thus in no wise be made 
essential to them, to say nothing of being postulated as their 
substantial basis (§ 43 ff.). The trace is what comes between 
the production of a psychical activity, (e.g., a sensory percep-, 
tion), and its reproduction, (e.g., as recollection). Since both of 
these acts are psychical we may also conceive of the trace only 
in psychical form. We are, nevertheless, in general able to 
acquire very definite ideas of it, since the fundamental condi- 
tions for this conception are given us in any case on two sides, 
and not infrequently, (when there traces are manifoldly repro- 
duced), on several sides. 
§ 30. Faculties and excitations exist in the traces in the rela- 
tively constant combination, which they have entered into with 
one another (§ 26). Since nothing can escape from the faculties, 
the loss by which the previously conscious or aroused develop- 
ments become mere traces, must effect the received excitations; 
and so far as this loss occurs, to that extent is the faculty filled 
by them again emptied or free. In so far all traces are as such 
volitions (Strebungen); that is to say, the original faculties 
given in them strive for the recovery of that which they have 
lost, or for the renewed attainment of consciousness. 
§ 31. The certainty, which we receive by a strict comparison 
of facts concerning this inner persistence, is, likewise, in two 
respects, invaluable for the perfecting of general psychological 
knowledge. First, because we apply them in a progressive
-P-A-G-E-443
  PSYCHOLOGY AS NATURAL SCIENCE 421 
direction. Since all previous developments of the soul, so far as 
they have not again been destroyed, continue to exist in the 
inner being of the soul, it follows, that this must, or (what is the 
same thing) the forces or faculties of the soul must, consist of 
traces of the earlier aroused developments. We can, therefore, 
perceive these faculties not merely from their effects, (which 
lead only to a summary or rough determination), but likewise 
from their causes too, or from the conscious developments pre- 
ceding them. Since now these latter separate in far greater 
extension and far more decidedly, (in hundreds of cases and 
more), we thus derive by this means for the perception of their 
nature and organisation the same advantages as those which 
magnifying glasses afford when applied to external nature. 
Secondly, we can furthermore turn to account the doctrine of 
inner persistence in a retrogressive construction. This matter 
has been provisionally discussed (§ 21). If we have clearly re- 
cognised in a certain series of developments the manner in which 
the traces are formed, we can thus disregard that which is 
added to these in our thoughts, and, since we continually repeat 
this, can at last attain to a knowledge of the original nature of 
the soul. 
§ 32. How far this persistence extends in reference to the 
quality of the developments, and the length of time, can 
scarcely be established with perfect certitude from the fore- 
going experiences. We know of the inner persistence only 
through the reproductions (§ 28). But from the fact that 
something has not heretofore been reproduced, and even now 
cannot be reproduced, it does not immediately follow that the 
same is not yet present, nor even that it is not capable of repro- 
duction. Experiments which have been made in this matter in 
violent fevers and injuries, etc., have shown, that what one has 
believed to have long disappeared, because it has never been 
reproduced under the ordinary conditions of reproduction, was 
raised into consciousness and psychical activity under unusual 
conditions of production. The presumption, therefore, is great, 
that in general whatever has once formed a part with any degree 
of completeness of our soul is never again lost. 
e 
 
-P-A-G-E-444
  422 FRIEDRICH EDUARD BENEKE 
§ 33. Since the persistence of the traces consists in nothing 
except the continuance of whatever has once attained exist- 
ence, the perfection in general of the traces must also be 
dependent upon the perfection with which the developments 
have originally been formed. In the sensations and perceptions, 
therefore, it would depend upon the perfection with which the 
excitations have been appropriated. We ascribe to the sensory 
original faculties in this connection a higher or lower degree of 
strength. 
§ 34. In the innermost soul traces remain of this transference 
of mobile elements from one psychical form to another, and 
thereby are established, in the same manner as all permanent 
combinations, even the combinations of incompatible forma- 
tions into groups and series: the combinations between the qual- 
ities of a thing, between the spatial and temporal coincidence, 
and the connection between causes and effects. These are, there- 
fore, by no means to be regarded merely as ideal relations, but 
to be viewed, just as much as the single presentation, as some 
teal abiding existence in the inner being of the soul. 
§ 35. Fourth fundamental process. Identical formations of 
the human soul, and similar ones according to the measure of 
their likeness, attract one another, or strive to enter into closer 
relations with each other. This presents itself to our observa- 
tion so frequently, not merely in its products but also in its 
occurrence, that it needs no further explanation. Familiar 
examples are such as, the witty combination of ideas, the forma- 
tion of similies and judgments, the fusion of similar feelings 
and endeavors, etc. If now in these examples the coalescing 
formations are only partly similar to one another, this attrac- 
tion, as is confirmed in the most evident manner by a stricter 
analysis of the facts in various cases, must take place between 
formations which are totally similar with still greater strength, 
and decisiveness. Nevertheless, the more critical observation 
shows that in all these attractions only a coalition of similar 
formations, but still no permanent combination or fusion of 
them is affected. Rather the process of balancing must enter 
in_a complementary way for these latter, just as it must enter 
 
-P-A-G-E-445
  
PSYCHOLOGY AS NATURAL SCIENCE 423 
in permanent combinations between dissimilar formations. 
This balancing process reveals itself as active here with most 
remarkable strength, so that the blending gains a higher degree 
of intimacy, since a specially favorable basis is prepared for it 
by the indicated attraction (§ 91). 
§ 36. The process of formation is of exceptional importance, 
especially for the judgment of quantitative development. If we 
suppose one and the same sensation, presentation, desire, etc., 
to be frequently produced, the traces remaining therefrom 
enter not only into relation with one another, but they also 
coalesce owing to their complete similarity into one total form- 
ation. And such formation appears to us as one to that degree 
in which we cannot become at all aware immediately of its com- 
plexity (qualitative), but only by means of its augmentation 
(quantitative). The strict conception and application of this 
will lead us to a number of highly significant conclusions, which 
have heretofore escaped the notice of science, because it has 
only very inaccurately taken these results into account. 
§ 37. All the processes explained in the preceding paragraphs 
are of such an elementary character, and of so great universal- 
ity, that scarcely one even of the simplest developments of our 
matured soul could be pointed out, in which they do not alto- 
gether, and even repeatedly, collaborate. But they show them- 
selves active in very different relations of combinations and 
degree; and thus there is indeed nothing that prevents one 
from indicating this or that single fundamental process as the 
conditioning cause for this or that effect, when its agency is 
particularly conspicuous above the others. A more exact 
observation teaches, that these processes can occur with very 
various degrees of rapidity and vivacity. And since these 
processes, (at least so far as there is no external condition), 
manifest themselves uniformly in all developments, which take 
place in a human being within the range of a certain funda- 
mental system, we are justified in deriving them in so far from 
the original faculties, and in attributing to the latter in respect 
thereof a higher or lower degree of animation as a pri- 
mordial quality.

CHAPTER II. THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF 
THE HUMAN SOUL 
§ 38. If we summarize first of all the most general character- 
istics concerning the nature of the human soul which result 
from our preceding exposition, it presents itself to us: (1) as a 
perfectly immaterial being (§§ 22 and 29), consisting of certain 
fundamental systems, which not only in themselves, but also 
in combination with each other, are most intimately one, or 
constitute one being (§ 26); (2) as a sensory being, i.e., the ele- 
mentary forces of the soul are capable of certain stimulations 
from without by excitations, which are assimilated and retained 
by these forces (§ 22 f.). To these must still be added: (3) the 
forces of the soul gain by this assimilation a more positive 
organisation, and in this they enter upon manifold closer com- 
binations with one another, partly by means of the fusion of 
similar forms into one total form (§ 35 f.), and partly by means 
of the combination of dissimilar forms into groups and series 
($34). (4) But the forces and faculties of the soul have also an 
original determinateness, which is twofold: the original de- 
terminateness of the fundamental systems to which they be- 
long, and the original determinateness of certain degrees of 
strength (§ 33), and vivacity (§ 37), and sensitiveness of 
stimulus (§ 23). Observation teaches us that every degree 
of any one of these fundamental conditions can occur together 
with any degree of the others. 
§ 39. For a more exact determinateness we must compare 
human souls w:th the souls of lower animals. If we compare 
that which appears in the latter as the effect of the psychical, 
with that immediately perceived in us and the effects thereof, 
the most striking characteristic of human souls appears to be, 
that they are spiritual, (that is to say, if for the present we 
formulate this superiority in its greatest universality and as it 
immediately appears), — souls, which are capable of a clearer, 
more definite, and more comprehensive consciousness, and 
whicn necessarily develop such consciousness up to a certain 
point of time, although some in greater, others in lesser perfec- 
 
-P-A-G-E-447
  PSYCHOLOGY AS NATURAL SCIENCE 425 
tion. The question now arises, what we have to regard as that 
which fundamentally conditions this superiority. 
§ 40. We here first encounter a view which was especially in 
the last century, and even in our time has been again, pro- 
pounded. According to it, the original forces of human souls are 
said to be in and of themselves entirely similar to those of the 
lower animals, and the spiritual character of the human soul is 
derived solely from the more excellent bodily organisation with 
which this is united. In support of this view three things have 
been especially emphasized: first, the possession of hands by 
which man is enabled to change the position and form of ob- 
jects, and thus become acquainted with an incomparably 
greater number of these qualities; secondly, the possession of 
speech, which makes possible a manifold expression of acquired 
ideas, etc., as well as a more extended and more perfect reten- 
tion of them; and, thirdly, the slower growth owing to a longer 
period of childhood, in consequence of which there is a more 
varied accumulation and elaboration of ideas. 
§ 41. The reasons specified in the preceding paragraph con- 
cerning the spiritual character of the human soul in no wise give 
a perfectly satisfactory explanation. From the greater mass of 
heterogeneous ideas which are acquired through the medium 
of the hands and speech, there would result in and for itself 
only a greater throng of them, and as a consequence rather a 
more rapid and more complete obliteration of the single idea. 
It is just as difficult to perceive from the slower growth of the 
body how it should transform the unspiritual into something 
spiritual without the addition of another positive factor. 
We have on the contrary to regard the slower formations of 
the body not as a cause, but as a consequence of spiritual devel- 
opment, which constantly exerts a certain modification upon 
the bodily development. The higher perfection of the human 
soul, therefore, cannot be in such wise merely externally condi- 
tioned, but must be a perfection that is internally and qualita- 
tively conditioned, and which affects the innermost nature of 
the psychical original faculties themselves. 
§ 42. Of the three fundamental characteristics of the original!
-P-A-G-E-448
  426 FRIEDRICH EDUARD BENEKE 
faculties as designated (§ 38), the susceptibility of excitation 
occurs not merely in many of the lower animals in like perfec- 
tion with man, but also in case of some of them in greater per- 
fection than in man. Vivacity occurs with men as with the 
lower animals in very many degrees. But what is peculiar and 
essential to human souls is a higher power of susceptibility and 
of appropriation of the excitation, as well as a greater force of 
inner persistence of the developments founded thereupon. 
By means of this more perfect inner persistence, there is made 
possible in the psychical developments of men an infinite in- 
crease of strength, of clearness, and of capacity of coalescence. 
In combination therewith, but also only in combination there- 
with, the hands, the speech, and the longer period of childhood 
are, to be sure, of no little significance for the development of 
the human soul. We can best designate this superiority of man 
over the lower animals by ascribing to the former a spiritual 
sensuousness. Besides the superiority of the higher energy of 
the original faculties there is another in which the possession of 
speech and hands are ranked only as single constituents. This 
is the more individual and more definite determinateness, and 
in consequence of that, the more definite separation of the 
different elementary systems, both as to the qualities of the 
several susceptibilities and activities, and as to the combi- 
nations and interweavings. 
CHAPTER III. THE RELATION OF THE SOUL 
AND THE BODY 
§ 43. THERE is still need of a more exact determination con- 
cerning the relation of the soul to the body. We have already 
remarked (§ 1), that these are very definitely separated in the 
perception (Auffassung), and the knowledge based thereupon; 
since to the knowledge of the soul everything belongs that we 
perceive by means of self-consciousness, and to the knowledge 
of the body everything by means of the external senses. We 
must leave to metaphysics the deeper determination of their 
real relation. We have here only to do with the question, 
 
-P-A-G-E-449
  PSYCHOLOGY AS NATURAL SCIENCE 427 
how they must stand to one another for the purposes of psy- 
chology. 
§ 44. Transferring the contrary kinds of knowledge men- 
tioned in the foregoing paragraphs to the real, without due 
consideration those who have set as their task a strictly philo- 
sophical knowledge, in most cases have represented the soul 
and the body as being in their innermost nature opposed to one 
another. And from this the most remarkable hypotheses have 
been evolved; since upon the other hand the experience of every 
moment presents their immediate union in one and the same 
being, and also their immediate interaction and co-operation. 
§ 45. When on the contrary there was set as a task no deeper 
philosophical knowledge, but there was in mind only the prac- 
tical application, which a synthesis of both rendered desir- 
able for a common knowledge, it has been attempted in most 
cases to refer the psychical developments to the bodily; indeed, 
some have gone so far as quite generally to designate the former 
as mere products of the bodily organization peculiar to man. 
This is the fundamental view of materialism. But the history of 
psychology shows, that never at any time has it been possible, 
either to explain or to construct from the material the very 
least of the developments of the soul. And not only so, but it 
can also admit of no doubt, that this will be just as little. pos- 
sible in the entire future. Both kind of ideas are much too dis- 
similar for this. In whatever way we may determine and 
combine the material forms and processes, we never attain to 
anything that has even the remotest resemblance to a thought, 
or to any other psychical product. 
§ 46. What has given rise to the materialistic view indicated 
in the preceding paragraph is only the greater distinctness and 
definiteness, which the presentations of the bodily have over 
those of the psychical for those unused to self-examination. 
But this advantage is nevertheless purely subjectively 
grounded (in the nature of the presentation); and the transfer- 
ence of it to the objective, or real, can be in no wise justified. 
And as a subjective advantage it is to be regarded not even as 
essentially necessary, but only as accidental and temporary;
-P-A-G-E-450
  428 FRIEDRICH EDUARD BENEKE 
since in a practice continued for some time and intelligently 
conducted, an equally great, indeed a still greater, clearness 
and definiteness can be gained for the perception of psychical 
products and results. 
§ 47. To this must be added, that we are able to observe 
(§ 13) the developments of our soul far more immediately and 
imore intimately. This, in connection with what has been 
remarked in the preceding paragraph, enables us to develop the 
knowledge of the psychical forms and processes to such great 
definiteness, exactness, and acuteness, that the knowledge of 
the bodily stands far in the background. Indeed, we can foresee 
‘with the highest probability, that a completeness of under- 
standing and construction for the bodily, such as we already 
have for the psychical, can never be gained (granted the 
highest possible perfection of magnifying glasses, etc.) even 
approximately. Even regardless of reasons of inner truth, it 
appears from the standpoint of the products of knowledge it- 
self as far more desirable, that, in direct opposition to the 
materialistic view, we should be able to conceive and to 
construct the bodily according to the forms and the laws of 
the psychical. 
§ 48. The problem which presents itself (§ 44) in the appar- 
ently opposed fundamental natures of the soul and body can be 
solved after deeper reflection (Aufassung) very simply, in that, 
we also perceive our own body, as everything else corporeal, 
only by means of the impressions upon our senses, and, there- 
fore, not immediately as in the case of the soul, where the 
powers and developments are apprehended as they are in them- 
selves. But there correspond certain forces to the perceptions 
of our own body asits being (in itself), which as they effect those 
sensory perceptions, permit still many other results to proceed 
from themselves. And the opposition in our observations of the 
two kinds of developments can arise just as well from the differ- 
ence in the faculties of perception, as from the difference of the 
perceived objects and events. That this difference is not so 
great as it appears is already in the highest degree probable, 
even (we can truly say) certain, from the fact, that there exists
-P-A-G-E-451
  PSYCHOLOGY AS NATURAL SCIENCE 429 
no kind of bodily developments which cannot become con- 
scious under certain circumstances, and which as conscious can- 
not be immediately perceived by us. But in that event it be- 
comes psychical (§§1 and 43); as it stands also in fact in this 
case to the positively psychical developments entirely in the 
same relations of reciprocal aid, of combination, and of opposi- 
tion, as the psychical developments stand to one another. 
Such a transformation of a thing most ordinarily to be con- 
ceived as non-psychical into one to be conceived as psychical, 
would be unthinkable, if in their fundamental nature they 
were opposed. 
On the contrary we are led to conclude that both kinds of 
forces must stand very close to one another in their innermost 
nature; and no artificial hypotheses (§ 44) are necessary for the 
explanation of their intimate relationship and reciprocal action. 
What through the senses we learn of the human body, or what 
we commonly term the body, we have to view only as external 
signs or representatives of the innermost nature of the body, 
which, like the soul, consists of certain forces and their develop- 
ments, that are indeed distinct from those of the soul, but are 
nevertheless essentially of the same kind. 
§ 49. On the other hand, it must be added, that the different 
fundamental systems of the soul also do not develop con- 
sciousness in equal perfection, but rather in very significant 
gradations. And they show the gradations in all relations 
parallel, as we observe between the positively psychical 
developments and the bodily developments raised to the 
psychical. Thus the difference between the soul and the 
body stands forth still more definitely than a mere difference 
of degree. They even approach so near to one another that no 
real line of separation can be drawn between them in the living 
man, and in general they are not farther separated than the dif- 
ferent psychical fundamental systems from one another. A 
real separation between soul and body takes place first only at 
death. 
§ 50. In any event weare justified according to the conclu- 
sions reached, to include the bodily, so far as it develops  
-P-A-G-E-452
  430 FRIEDRICH EDUARD BENEKE 
consciousness, in our science, and to make the attempt to dis- 
cover whether its developments, and especially its action upon 
the soul, may not be construed according to the laws, which 
have come to light for the positive psychical developments from 
the facts observed by our self-consciousness. It furthermore 
immediately appears from this, that we have throughout to 
suppose no other bond for the connection of soul and body, than 
that by which the psychical systems themselves are united. 
§ 51. Even the most general survey of the bodily develop- 
ments permits no doubt concerning the fact, that the four fund- 
amental laws which have been established for the psychical, 
likewise have their application as determining and regulating 
the bodily, though to be sure with some modifications. The 
bodily forces also need support from without, and they strive 
after and appropriate it; and in them, too, life is propagated 
from within by means of continual acquisition of new homo- 
geneous faculties or forces. In them also, received stimuli are 
balanced with reference to the formations which stand in rela- 
tion therewith; and the developments deprived in this way of 
excitation continue to exist in the forms of traces or forces, 
which thereafter enter as rudiments into future developments. 
Finally, in them too, a reciprocal attraction between homo- 
geneous developments manifests itself. They enter into closer 
relation, or even totally fuse with each other. As a result of all 
this there is formed that which one terms (favorably or unfav- 
orably etc.) the bodily constitution. What is lacking to the 
bodily developments in all these relations, is only a more inde- 
pendent development of elementary acts and forces, which 
distinguish psychical development (§ 42). They coalesce too 
with less regard to distinctions; and the forms of organisation 
have therefore no such definite determination (§ 47). 
§ 52. It is thus obvious, that the recognised fundamental 
laws prove effective for the interaction between soul and body, 
and the rudiments remaining from these. Here only the adjust- 
ment of the mobile elements and the attraction of the homo- 
geneous formations come into consideration. By means of the 
former all transferences and influences which proceed from the
-P-A-G-E-453
PSYCHOLOGY AS NATURAL SCIENCE 431 
soul to the body, or from the body to the soul, are determined: 
especially in the first direction every bodily doing or action 
produced by the soul, as well as the involuntary manifestations 
of the emotions, etc.; and in the second direction the manifold 
aids which the psychical development experiences from the 
bodily, and by means of which the soul as it were constantly 
feeds upon the bodily. The attraction in relation to those things 
homogeneous, shows itself operative especially in the distribu- 
tion of the tones from the one to the other, and in the associa- 
tions between similarly toned psychical and bodily develop- 
ments. Moreover, these are operative in various forms, e.g., in 
passions and other emotions, for the production of balancings 
among the corresponding bodily developments, when psychical 
developments meet, which by their firmer forms of organiza- 
tion, or otherwise, are prevented from balancing. Thus blushing 
accompanies shame and anger, etc.; tears of emotion accom- 
pany the unexpected proofs of love, and deserved but long with- 
held marks of distinction, etc. From all this it follows, that we 
have to conceive the bodily life as subordinated to the psychi- 
cal; whereas materialism affirms that the life of the soul is only 
an intensified bodily; and that as an independent existence in 
man there is no soul.

§ 138. THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF PSYCHICAL 
PHENOMENA 
In the explanation of psychical phenomena it is most neces- 
sary, that their connection and interdependence be not ne- 
glected in the consideration of their diversity, because other- 
wise we should set up unavoidable hindrances to any theory 
seeking for unity. Of this character is particularly the assump- 
tion of an original two- or threefold division of the activity of 
the mind, which is supposed to rest upon the qualitative differ- 
ence of inner phenomena. After the detailed examination of 
the latter we should still find impossible to place in one and the 
same category as regards their origin, ideas, feelings, and de- 
sires; on the contrary, we must rather regard the lack of inde- 
pendence, and even actual dependence of the forms of the latter 
two kinds of phenomena upon the ideas, as an indication that 
these in some way lie at their foundation, and that they are 
capable of being made comprehensible as derived states. In-

  EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 433 
deed, so many earlier psychologists have sought to prove this, 
that we may say the atomistic trichotomy of the soul was first 
introduced by Kant and his school. 
If now the uselessness of abstract powers of the mind has been 
made clear in what has preceded, no one can desire to revert, 
either to a general faculty of ideas, or to any specific kinds of 
it, under the names of sense, imagination, understanding, etc. 
On the contrary, the ever increasing specialisation of these fac- 
ulties, which becomes necessary if one somewhat more than 
superficially considers inner experience, shows that we cannot 
pursue this method with success, but have to take one directly 
opposed. This consists in supposing each single idea itself as an 
independent state of the mind, and accordingly an indefinitely 
large number of such states. If now to each one of these a 
power is ascribed as cause, we thus acquire, to be sure, instead 
of a moderate number of faculties of the mind, an almost un- 
limited number of individual powers of the mind. We do not 
fail to perceive that we are thereby still further, and in a far 
more hazardous way, removed from the unity of the soul,than 
is the case with the theory of faculties. But if we do not suc- 
ceed in comprehending the unity of ten or twenty faculties, the 
failure consequently is essentially not greater if a thousand or 
ten thousand powers of forming ideas appear hard to combine. 
Nevertheless this would only be a lamentable consolation, 
which we are far from claiming. Therefore, either we must seek 
so to justify that hypothesis, that it no longer controverts the 
unity of the soul, or this principle is not adequately estab- 
lished, and must be given up. Let us then first test somewhat 
more closely this demand for the unity of the soul, as the pos- 
sessor of the powers of the mind. 
§ 139. THE UNITY OF THE SOUL 
If it must be conceded that the powers of the mind, as causes 
of its states, are not objects of inner observation, it holds still 
more true of the mind itself, as the possessor of those powers. 
For self-consciousness by no means reveals to us the mind, on
-P-A-G-E-456
  434 MORITZ WILHELM DROBISCH 
the contrary, shows only the empirical I, from which through 
abstraction of its changing content the pure I is first at- 
tained; but which, for that very reason, is an empty and really 
formal idea. The identity of our psychical being is, therefore, 
by no means immediately guaranteed as a fact by the identity 
of our self-consciousness, and it is merely upon inferences that 
this conviction is based. Without deeper metaphysical argu- 
mentation the following observations can be made upon this 
subject. 
All our ideas have a tendency to become united, to exchange 
their multiplicity for unity, and they actually coalesce, so far as 
the contradictions of their contents do not prevent. Our sensu- 
ous perception, as well as our intellectual conception, is a con- 
stant process of unification, either through the percept, or the 
concept; therefore, every theoretical science involves the effort 
to reduce the principles of explanation to the lowest possible 
number. The fact, that onlya few ideas can enter our conscious- 
ness at once, shows to be sure at first glance, that they displace, 
suppress, therefore, as it were, expel one another; but also on 
the other hand, that they are not able to avoid one another, but 
are held together by an attractive force. The same thing like- 
wise appears in associations, these quite involuntary and art- 
less combinations of simultaneous ideas. It is, therefore, pos- 
sible to attribute similar attractive and repellant forces to ideas, 
after the analogy of the physical-chemical hypothesis of attrac- 
tions and repulsions of elements. But leaving out of considera- 
tion the fact, that here attraction and repulsion must be ascribed 
simultaneously to the same elements of psychical life, which 
beyond controversy is inconceivable (the physicist attributes 
attraction to the molecules, and transfers repulsion to the sur- 
rounding sphere of heat), there is furthermore this difference, 
that the elements of bodies have an independent existence, so 
that the existence of the body depends upon that of its ele- 
ments, which become thereby the constituents out of which it 
is composed. 
Nevertheless, it will not occur to anyone to affirm that the 
mind is composed of its ideas, and that these have also
-P-A-G-E-457
  
EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 435 
existence apart from the mind. The mind, in which they are, 
and because they are in it, which has no constituents (for what 
apart from ideas, could otherwise be its constituents?), and is 
consequently simple, must moreover itself be assumed to be 
the principle of unity. This also leads to the same conclusion, 
that the body is external to the mind, but ideas, feelings, and 
desires, are within it. The mind is, therefore, in a middle 
ground between outer and inner experience, as the unit of mea- 
sure — belonging to no experience — of things and states of 
the external and internal world. With a measure one can in- 
deed measure; but one cannot wish to measure it itself, or it 
ceases to be a measure. One can indeed distinguish the parts in 
it; but these are only accidental parts, and not essential con- 
stituents. 
§ 140. THE REFUTATION OF THE FACULTY 
CONCEPT 
If accordingly the hypothesis of the unity of the soul appear 
to us reasonably established, so that we have to think of it as 
having strict simplicity of being, because otherwise a new prin- 
ciple of unification would be needed, the question is all the 
more seriously renewed, how the other hypothesis of an un- 
limited number of states of the mind is supposed to be com- 
patible with it. There corresponds to every individual sensa- 
tion a simple idea as a state of the mind, and combined ideas 
originate from these as their elements. Shall we endow the 
mind with as many faculties as it has simple ideas? And if not, 
what else shall we do? In order to decide this question, it is ne- 
cessary first to determine, what must be understood by facul- 
ties. If we oppose activity to it, as reality to possibility, the 
entire concept of faculty is at bottom an empty thought, which 
can signify nothing other, than that after an activity has origin- 
ated we can then add in thought, that nevertheless the possi- 
bility must have been present for it beforehand. But this possi- 
bilty is also only a mode of forming ideas in the mind of the 
thinker, and is nothing in the things themselves; for we should 
 
-P-A-G-E-458
  436 MORITZ WILHELM DROBISCH 
thereby conceive an actual possibility, which is a gross ab- 
surdity. 
In this merely logical sense we will not want to have the con- 
cept of possibility taken, but we seek to express thereby, that 
an activity is existent in the germ (potentia), and only awaits 
the opportunity to develop into actuality (actu). We cannot, 
indeed, strictly mean thereby, that the activity is retained 
wholly as it afterwards manifests itself, only in a concentrated 
undeveloped condition in the mind, so that, therefore, e.g., the 
sensuous ideas before they appear in consciousness through 
stimulation of the senses, dwell in the mind in the same way as 
they abide in the recesses of the memory, after they have be- 
come forgotten. This would make every excitation of ideas 
from without a mere appearance, and would therefore be a 
view compatible only with the most thoroughgoing idealism. 
This israther what we mean, that, just as the seed-corn, in order 
to germinate and develop, requires earth, air, moisture, and 
warmth, but nevertheless these potencies can still bring into 
development only a seed-corn, but by no means a stone, or even 
a blossom; so likewise a diversified capacity for forming ideas, 
is to be understood as belonging to the mind, by virtue of which, 
if certain external conditions are associated therewith, an 
actual formation of ideas take place in it. 
If we would discuss this concept metaphysically we should 
put the question, whether the multiplicity of capacities har- 
monises better with the demanded unity of the soul, than a 
multiplicity of actual powers; or whether the soul, if it origin- 
ally carries in itself as the mode of its existence such a multi- 
plicity of capacities, would be strictly regarded anything more 
than a system of the same, therefore, a compound, and what 
then must be deemed the significance of these capacities apart 
from this compound? But this may be left out of the present 
discussion. 
Possibly one might think of seeking aid through the analogy 
of physics, by saying that the activity is still united to the 
capacity, latent, and becomes free through development under 
the codperation of external conditions. To this suggestion we
-P-A-G-E-459
  
EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 437 
should oppose the observation, that latent heat or electricity 
presupposes the free; that this latteris the first and original, the 
former only the secondary and derived condition. Latent activ- 
ities of the mind may therefore indeed be termed ideas stored 
in memory beyond consciousness; but the ideas originating 
according to common conviction through sensory impressions 
if, as becoming free, they are to be viewed as previously bound, 
would have to be taken as platonic remembrances out of a pre- 
vious existence, and their sensuous origin would have to be a 
vain delusion. To prove this latter has up to now been impos- 
sible for any scepticism, or any idealism. 
§141. IDEAS AS STATES AND NOT POWERS 
OF THE MIND 
According to the foregoing every return to faculties, or power 
of forming ideas, in whatever way we may conceive these, ap- 
pears to lead to no acceptable result. We must, therefore, at- 
tempt to obtain another point of view of ideas, which without 
being content to regard them as mere inner phenomena, ex- 
plains both their existence, and promises to make conceivable, 
as coming from them, feelings and desires. In this attempt the 
comparison with physical science affords us the safest guidance. 
If the physicist says that this body possesses the capacity to be- 
come more heated, luminous, electrical, magnetic, to resound, to 
enter into many chemical combinations, etc., he does not mean 
by that, that the body possesses certain faculties or dormant 
powers, which under certain conditions can awaken and produce 
those phenomena, but he signifies thereby only certain disposi- 
tions or qualities of the body, whether these may have their 
location in the bulk of its matter, in its mechanical composi- 
tion, orin the relation of the quality of its matter to that of some 
other body. If we here speak of a force as the cause of such 
a physical condition of a body, it is not transferred to this, but 
is established outside of it, and the body appears only as a thing 
_ which is placed in a certain condition, to which we do not on that 
account ascribe peculiar powers; or would we attribute to a
-P-A-G-E-460
438 MORITZ WILHELM DROBISCH 
heavy body a power to fall, to the resonant a power to sound? 
How far even the older physics was from any such theory as 
this, its hypothesis of a force of inertia shows. It did not 
attribute to a mobile body a power of movement, but a power 
to resist movement. The new physics, on the other hand, dis- 
cards both, and views rest and motion as states which are alike 
accidental to the bodies, but if they are placed in them, they 
continue unchanged until a removal or modification of the same 
ensues. The thought of the capacity of bodies for these states 
drops entirely as idle and unfruitful. 
To heed this example of physics might now be by far the 
most profitable method for psychology. It has been already 
remarked above, that in our immediate consciousness the form- 
ing of ideas appears neither as an actuality, nor a capacity of the 
mind, but only as a happening in it. Accordingly, in harmony 
with experience, we will designate the ideas as states of the 
mind, and can affirm at least of the sensuous ideas, which form 
the basis of all others, that the mind is placed in these states by 
means of external causes through the agency of the organs of 
sense, which, like the produced motion of a body, continues un- 
changed so long as they are not removed or modified by addi- 
tional inner or outer causes. We consequently lay claim to the 
principle of permanence (the law of inertia) for these states, 
and regard the mind as existence in itself, barren of ideas, and 
accordingly also of feelings and desires, which, on account of its 
simplicity, can attain to those states only through the manifold 
relations of its quality to the qualities of the things with which 
it stands in relation, — comparable to chemical affinity. 
The nature and mode in which external things affect the 
mind, the conditions of the production of any idea, remain 
partly physiological and partly metaphysical problems. But 
since it is assumed, that the manifoldness of the relations of the 
individual mind to the external causes of its simple ideas cre- 
ates likewise a manifold constitution in the latter, the question 
how the unity of the mind is consistent with the multiplicity of 
its inner happenings has at least in general no more difficulties. 
One and the same number can enter into infinitely numerous
-P-A-G-E-461
EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 439 
relations, and the exponent of the relations is in every case a 
different one. With such exponents the ideas may be compared; 
and with the common fundamental unit (the first member) of 
them, the mind itself may be compared. But if one desires 
more than comparisons, one has then to do with metaphysics, 
which has to discuss this question in the systematic relation of 
concepts. For the immediate purpose it suffices to observe that 
the formation of ideas must be conceived not from the point of 
view of a manifestation of power of the mind, but asa state of 
the same, or as a happening befalling it. The ideas must not be 
compared with powers, but with movements of the mind; and 
if a sensuous image is desired, they can best be compared with 
the oscillations of a body, otherwise externally at rest. 
§ 142. THE FREEDOM AND INHIBITION OF IDEAS 
The facts of the changing attention and of the disappearance 
of ideas from consciousness, as well as their reappearance in 
it, reveal clearly, that ideas although themselves only states of 
the mind, nevertheless are capable of having in their turn dif- 
ferent states of their own. These are the states of freedom and 
of inhibition of ideas. Anidea will then be free, if simultaneously 
there be represented no others of opposite quality, but only of a 
like or dissimilar constitution. But if opposed ideas occur sim- 
ultaneously, a diminution of that freedom takes place, which 
can be termed inhibition. For as experience adequately shows, 
ideas do not mutually suppress one another, not even when 
some of them become forgotten— for they can be again 
aroused under certain conditions — but they are merely 
brought into a state in which they cease wholly or in a certain 
degree to be ideas; but for all that are neither destroyed, nor 
suffer a diminution of their being, which rather assumes only 
another form. This is the form of striving. 
In the same degree namely, in which vividness or the con- 
scious clearness of an idea diminishes, in that degree a resist- 
ance to this violent state and a striving to free itself there- 
from arises in it. Under such circumstances the idea certainly 
 
-P-A-G-E-462
  440 MORITZ WILHELM DROBISCH 
becomes a force, but one which is directed against a definite 
hindrance obstructing its freedom. It ceases at once to be a 
force so soon as that hindrance disappears, and it has attained 
again its natural uninhibited state. In this striving is found the 
principle for the explanation of desire; it would, however, be 
rash if one were to affirm this striving to be in general the desire 
itself. For manifestly no idea could disappear from conscious- 
ness, unless its return were desired; and all ideas, which we any 
time have had and have long since forgotten, would have to 
be desired, and consequently press for return into conscious- 
ness. Of this, however, we do not observe the least, and we are 
not even aware of any such pressure on the part of the ideas, 
from which our attention is momentarily diverted. A conscious 
and an unconscious striving must therefore be distinguished, 
and the conditions of this distinction must be investigated. 
§ 143. THE INHIBITION OF OPPOSING IDEAS 
In fact our inhibited striving is to be conceived as at one 
time united with the feeling of pressure, and as at another time 
without any such feeling. This indicates an essential difference 
in the inhibition, according as this occurs before or after the 
complete balancing of the opposing striving of ideas. The 
former is combined with a feeling of obstruction, the latter is 
free therefrom, and can be termed an equilibrium of ideas, 
which takes place within or without consciousness, according as 
the balanced ideas are in part only, or wholly inhibited. Ideas 
which are not yet in equilibrium will possess a striving after it; 
for only the balanced condition can have a point of rest, and the 
inhibition connected with it will be that which under the given 
circumstances imposes upon the ideas the least proportionate 
pressure. More precise determinations of this state, the condi- 
tions of equilibrium of ideas, cannot be developed without the 
aid of mathematics. Ideas in equilibrium are united in general 
neither with feelings nor with desires; but both accompany the 
still unbalanced ideas. Feelings and desires as distinct from 
ideas are inconceivable.. They lack a definite representable
-P-A-G-E-463
  
EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 441 
what, a quale; nevertheless they are actually in consciousness. 
They must, therefore, be found in it as the manifold changeable 
how of presentation. Wherein now does this consist, and how 
do they differ from one another? By what means do I know of 
my desires? Do I perceive an act of desire immediately? Not at 
all, I certainly feel only the state of desire, but still distinguish 
therefrom the feeling which accompanies it. The desire destroys 
the calm, the equilibrium of the mind, or to speak more cor- 
rectly, the equilibrium of its ideas. If I have a feeling of this 
equilibrium, a change in it will be a feeling of disturbance. The 
feeling of psychical equilibrium is precisely similar to that of 
bodily health. Of both there exists no positive feeling. The 
body as well as the mind is in a state of equilibrium when one 
has no feeling of its activities, just as a machine in which there 
is the least possible friction makes but little noise. Desires and 
feelings are, therefore, the indices of the deviation from the 
state of equilibrium of ideas. 
It is to be remembered if we wish to comprehend their differ- 
ence, that desires are the activity, feelings the passivity of the 
mind. Now desire is the striving of that idea, whose content is 
desired, against obstructions, which have their ground it is true 
outside of the mind, but nevertheless must be felt by it, since 
otherwise the striving idea, which always abides in the mind, 
would find no obstruction. Obstructions are, therefore, at least 
in the broadest sense of the term, themselves ideas. But whilst 
the hindrances obstruct, they react against the striving idea, and 
thereby become unpleasant. This latter idea presses and is 
pressed; in it is the seat of desire; in its obstructions is the seat 
of the unpleasant feeling of resistance united therewith. The 
overcoming striving of an idea against such obstructions is 
therefore the desire of its content; and the succumbing resist- 
ance of what is opposed is therefore the painful feeling, which 
is constantly united with the postponement of the attainment 
of what is desired. The former is the striving, the latter is the 
suffering of the one desiring. The desire is, therefore, not felt 
only in the idea of the desired thing, also not alone in that 
which resists it, but in both at the same time, and in their rela-  
-P-A-G-E-464
  442 MORITZ WILHELM DROBISCH 
tion, which is none other than the disturbance of the preceding 
equilibrium. But the striving idea, however, does not itself 
alone possess the power for this disturbance, but gains it only 
through union with an internal or external perception related to 
it, which reproduces and lifts above the point of equilibrium, 
and which therefore appears as the external cause of the origin, 
or the reawakening of desire. The desire appears herewith as a 
progressing or retrogressing movement of ideas; if we regard 
the maximum of their clearness as the goal or culminating 
point. But the mind itself is thereby immediately neither 
active, nor passive. It is both, only mediately, in so far, that is 
to say as its ideas are found in these states. 
§ 144. THE ORIGIN OF FEELINGS AND DESIRES 
This is the first, and, to be sure, only a very meagre outline 
of the origin of feelings and desires, of which a further and more 
exhaustive explanation would demand a more exact and more 
varied development of the explanatory principle postulated as 
its basis, than is here possible and consistent with the desired 
aim. Nevertheless, it is at least possible to add the following 
corollaries. 
(1) Just as the idea striving against abstractions causes 
desire, the idea retreating reluctantly from consciousness 
causes repugnance. For manifestly the content represented in 
it is the object of repugnance, but the energy of the repugnance 
is contained in the ideas opposed to this idea, which repel and 
gradually suppress it; the stronger the resistance of the reced- 
ing idea, so much the stronger is the emotion of abhorrence. 
(2) Feelings of oppression can also arise without desire and 
abhorrence, that is to say, without a progressive or retrogres- 
sive movement of ideas. For granted an idea is in itself too 
weak to continue in consciousness when opposed by many 
stronger ones, and thus to be in equilibrium with them, it can 
nevertheless happen by the following means, that it is asso- 
ciated with an idea of a dissimilar content, which affords the 
support demanded for equilibrium with the others. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-465
  EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 443 
memory-image of the room which I occupied many years ago 
as a schoolboy is itself not capable of continuing beside the 
intuitions of the present; but if by a related perception the 
damp, musty smell is reproduced, which at that time made its 
occupancy not the most agreeable, then the image emerges 
with full vividness and continues in my consciousness. But 
nevertheless, any such recollection always demands a certain 
effort, and this consists in the fact that the retained idea is in a 
pressed position between the opposed ideas seeking to sup- 
plant it, and those dissimilar which afford to it the necessary 
support. Hence arises a feeling of oppression. 
(3) An idea, finally, can also arise notwithstanding opposing 
hindrances, that is to say, when this rising occurs under the 
protection of a stronger idea entirely homogeneous with it, 
which removes the obstacles in its way, and thereby makes for 
it a free path. Then the obstacles disappear as if dispelled by 
magic, like the impotent spectres of the night before the light 
of day. Under suchcircumstances the rising idea possesses more 
elasticity than it can expend, and the character of its move- 
ment creates a feeling of pleasure. 
With these corollaries we must here be content, for the condi- 
tions under which the feelings of the good and the beautiful 
arise, lie too deep to permit of being here developed with any 
clearness. 
§ 145. THE EQUILIBRIUM AND MOVEMENT OF 
IDEAS 
The concepts of freedom and inhibition, of equilibrium and 
movements, of striving and resistance of ideas, developed with 
the sharpest lines of differentiation, must henceforth, solely and 
alone, take the place of the theory of the abstract faculties of 
ideas, feeling, and desire, as explanatory principles. But they 
serve, moreover, to supplant the more special faculties sub- 
ordinated to these in a manner more conformable to experi- 
ence. Our entire analysis of psychical phenomena must have 
demonstrated, that association and reproduction are the keys
-P-A-G-E-466
  “444, MORITZ WILHELM DROBISCH 
which open the portals of the inner life of the soul. But the 
principles themselves henceforth can be proved to be derived 
from others lying deeper. For association is the result of the 
unity of the soul, by means of which all the states of the latter, 
so far as their contrasts admit it, unite and enter combinations 
under all circumstances. But reproduction rests in part imme- 
diately upon associations, and in part upon the conceptsof free- 
dom and inhibition of ideas. 
In general the apparent manifestation of the faculties of the 
mind rests upon combinations, aggregations of ideas in the 
large, which we can style with Herbart masses of ideas (Vors- 
tellungsmassen), which developed with more or less regularity 
are interwoven out of series, and series of series; and move- 
ments and transformations of these masses of ideas appear in 
place of the activity of the faculties. The individual faculties 
are distinguished in part formally by the different kind of the 
formation of the masses in which they have their location; and 
in part materially by the kind of ideas which make up the mate- 
rial of the mass. By means of the latter we can understand the 
so frequently occurring partiality of memory, of imagination, 
and of the understanding. 
Memory, therefore, we may ascribe to our mind in so far as it 
possesses ideas, which still bear the characteristics of their first 
origin, and which return to consciousness, out of which they 
have been crowded by others, according to the same temporal 
order as that in which they originated, in that train of recol- 
lected thought which is conformable to the laws of memory. 
Imagination we can ascribe to our mind in so far as it pos- 
sesses ideas, in which the characteristics of their first sensuous 
origin are obliterated, which therefore no longer occupy a 
definite place among other after images of former perceptions, 
and are no longer reproduced in the temporal sequence of the 
same. But the most manifold combinations are entered upon, 
according to all the laws of association, which enable it to 
perform even as manifold reproductions, and to give them that 
easy mobility, by which the making of more and more numer- 
ous combinations of surpassing novelty: is rendered possible. 
 
-P-A-G-E-467
EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 445 
Understanding belongs to our mind in so far as there exists 
in it masses of ideas whose combinations, independent of all 
accidental circumstances of their encounter, are completely 
adapted to the nature of their content, and therefore corre- 
spond to the relations of things; it may be, that, as in theoretical 
understanding, this content is sharply separated in conceptual 
definitions, or, asin the practical understanding, is rightly recog- 
nised only in relation to the content of another idea. 
Our mind possesses will, in so far as it has masses of ideas, 
whose content represent what is willed, and whose striving 
exercises a decisive control over other ideas and combinations 
of ideas. 
The mind is rational, if the moral insight has become the 
kernel and centre of the mass-of-ideas ruling all others. But 
man as a natural creature is called rational in so far as adapta- 
tions have been made in his physical organisation, which makes 
possible the development of moral insight, and the attainment 
of it to power, but do not prevent it as in the case of the lower 
animals. 
Finally with momentary perceptions the mind possesses 
sensibility. 
§ 146. THE STAGES IN THE FORMATION OF THE 
SPIRIT 
With this explanation and limitation of the apparent faculties 
of the mind the view can now be united, which discerns the 
different stages in the formation of the spirit. Indeed it is ob- 
vious, that thereby the transformations must at the same time 
be considered, which affect the body in its different periods of 
life, and which without doubt favor and support the psychical 
processes. But after the subtraction of these bodily condi- 
tions there remain nevertheless always a series of pvrely 
psychical transformations residual, resting chiefly upon the 
changes which take place in the combinations of ideas. 
Ideas are barren of connection and therefore purely sensuous 
in their first origin in the newborn child, but after a short time 
   
-P-A-G-E-468
  446 MORITZ WILHELM DROBISCH 
those associations have already been formed which are neces- 
sary to memory, and a little later that desire appears, which 
not always the need of food, but often only the sight of the 
nurse calls forth. In the boy, it is true, highly manifold com- 
binations of ideas have been formed, and we must concede to 
him memory and imagination, understanding and will, in very 
many spheres of his capacity for forming ideas. But neverthe- 
less, sensibility, memory, and imagination still dominate in him, 
to which his fondness for sweetmeats, his love of sightseeing and 
curiosity, his ability for learning by heart, his joy in narratives 
of adventure, his desire for sport, sufficiently testify. The 
youth begins to feel: the scattered ideas concentrate in him to 
form a more abiding and more powerful empirical self, by which 
he not only acquires power over his actions and thereby be- 
comes responsible, but also learns to guide his imagination in 
poetic composition, and to formulate his thought in reflection. 
‘With higher self-consciousness the inner world opens before 
him, and with it the finer feeling for the beautiful in nature, art, 
poetry, and the other sex. — Still experience is lacking, which 
gives maturity to the understanding. This manhood gives with 
increasing needs and cares, for the supplying of which under- 
standing must serve; but the execution of its decisions de- 
mands energy of the will, and the duties to society and to the 
family, a moral content of the will. Self-control must, therefore, 
now be present in constant increase, and a constant, true, and 
reasonable activity towards the outer world must take the 
place of youthful vacillation. With self-control reason is finally 
acquired, the strength of which must increase in the same meas- 
ure as that in which sensuous impressionability, the power of 
desires and passions, decrease. 
Thus the combinations among ideas become greater in num- 
ber, and more perfected in the course of life, and as a result of it 
restrain and control its movements. The stress of emotions and 
passions give place to more mature considerations; absentmind- 
edness and the flightiness of imagination yield to the sharp 
attention and many sided circumspectness of reflection; know- 
ledge tempers the disquietude of doubt; and when this know-
-P-A-G-E-469
  EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 447 
ledge can go no further, faith succeeds to its function. The 
entire development of the mind progresses always towards a 
more and more harmonious form, and its activity towards a 
more and more peaceful movement. But there are not newly 
awakening faculties of the mind which produce this change of 
phenomena; but there are always only the ideas, their com- 
binations and movements, ideation and its states, by means 
of which they become intelligible.

Translated from the French* by

CHAPTER I. FACTS OF THE INNER SENSE 
I sHatt characterise from the present this inner sense (sens 
intime) in a more explicit manner under the name of sense of 
effort, of which the cause or productive force becomes self, by 
the single fact of the distinction which is established between 
the subject of that free effort, and the object which resists im- 
mediately through its own inertia. I say immediately, in order 
to announce here in advance another very essential distinction, 
that I believe myself authorized to set up between the resist- 
ance or relative inertia of one’s own body, which yields to or 
obeys voluntary effort, and the absolute resistance of the for- 
eign body, which may be invincible. 
The sense of effort has not been designated until now by its 
specific name, precisely because it is the innermost, or the 
nearest to ourselves, or rather because it is ourselves. If one 
should demand at this stage to be made acquainted with it by 
a more detailed exposition, I should reply, that each of our 
senses defines itself by its exercise. If there were, for example, 
one born paralytic who had never acted voluntarily to move

his limbs or to set in motion foreign bodies, — supposing that 
such a person, which appears impossible to me, could have 
had the least degree of intelligence, — there would be no more 
possibility to make him understand by language what effort is, 
than there is to explain to one born blind what color and the 
sense of sight are. Nevertheless, as one explains not the sense 
or the phenomenon of vision, but rather the conditions, in- 
struments, and physical or organic means, which serve to effect 
it, it will perhaps not be useless to analyse also physically 
the instruments and means of exercise of the internal sense of 
effort, in order to learn the better to circumscribe its domain 
by distinguishing it from that of an external sense with which 
it might be confused. I shall therefore enter upon some con- 
siderations which appear to me important. 
This study, foreign as it is to the proper analysis of the phe- 
nomena of the inner sense, which excludes everything that be- 
longs to the province of external observation, will be included 
more expressly in the object of another portion of this work, 
where we shall be occupied more particularly with the relation 
of the phenomena of physical or organic nature than with those 
of psychology; but I cannot proceed without giving the follow- 
ing physiological hints as indispensable to my actual purpose. 
1. The organs of sensation with which the physiologists have 
heretofore been exclusively occupied, appear confined to the 
cerebral nervous system, distinguished by a well known ob- 
server + under the title of the Nervous system of animal life. The 
sense of effort, here in question, is limited by that part of the 
muscular system, which the action of the will expressly sets in 
play, and which physiology distinguishes also under the title of 
a System of the voluntary muscles of the animal life. 
2. In the natural and origina] state of the sentient being 
there is no affection felt in any part whatsoever of its organism, 
nor any object perceived externally, except in so far as the nerv- 
ous extremities are at first excited by some cause foreign to 
the self, and as this first impression is uninterruptedly trans- 
mitted by the sensory nerves which receive it as far as the 
1 Cf. Bichat’s works: De la vie et la mort and Anatomie Physiologique.

  450 THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY 
centre of the brain, where perception is supposed to occur, 
although we are profoundly ignorant of what takes place in the 
nerves and the brain whenever an impression is felt or per- 
ceived. Nevertheless, daily experience proves that such percep- 
tion is always preceded or accompanied by the organic condi- 
tions which we have just mentioned. But in the exercise of the 
sense of effort something more takes place. 
Let us first suppose that the muscular organ be excited by an 
external cause, or by a stimulus adapted to set in play that vital 
property that the physiologists name irritability or sensory 
organic contractility; or again, let us suppose that a movable 
part may be aroused or strongly agitated by an external force, 
there will indeed clearly result from it a particular impression, 
which one may call muscular sensation or sensation of move- 
ment, but which could not be confused with that mode of our 
activity which we designate by the term of willed effort. In 
fact, this muscular sensation is subject to the same laws or 
organic conditions which determine the general sensory func- 
tions; it is always an impression received and transmitted to 
the brain, where it is felt as a passive mode foreign to the will or 
to the seif. But in-effort such as we perceive and reproduce at 
each instant, there is no excitation, no foreign stimulus, and 
nevertheless the muscular organ is set in play, the contraction 
effected, the movement produced, without any cause other 
than this inner force which is felt or immediately perceived in 
its exercise, and also without any sign being capable of repre- 
senting it to the imagination or tosome sense other than its own. 
Let us however represent this force in exercise by an image, 
and, by placing ourselves for a moment at the physiological 
point of view, let us suppose that it be localised in the centre of 
the brain. When the effort is made, this central spring to the 
release of which there is referred by a sort of imaginary fiction 
the feeling of our activity, will be said to enter into action of it- 
self. I adopt this last expression, as a material sign of voluntary 
effort, or of an action which is neither actually compelled nor 
1 An expression of M. Cabanis in his great work upon the Rapports du 
physique et du moral de Vhomme.
-P-A-G-E-473
  MAINE DE BIRAN 451 
provoked by any sensory impression coming from without, nor 
even produced in any part of the nervous system outside the 
centre. The first motor determination being thus begotten in 
the centre, is immediately transmitted by the nerves to the 
muscular organ. This is contracted, or extended; its specific 
irritability is set in action, as it could be by a foreign stimulus. 
But, whereas, in this last case, the simple passive muscular 
sensation commences at the external organ in order to termi- 
nate at the centre which receives it; here the active motor 
stimulus commences in the centre where the cause resides, 
which, after having performed the contraction or movement, 
perceives as effect by means of the nervous transmission the 
muscular impression which it originates in the beginning. I 
here discover the symbol of complete action, the physiological 
signs of which I must endeavor to analyse more expressly; be- 
cause, it is upon these signs alone that the analysis can here 
be based, since every action of the willis truly indivisible and 
instantaneous as known through the inner sense. 
In considering, therefore, this action from the point of view 
of physiology, I distinguish two elements, or two moments, 
in which it is accomplished. To the first corresponds the simple 
motor determination or the release of the central spring 
affecting the nerves. However, that part of the action, thus 
limited to the nervous system, does not appear to be accom- 
panied by a particular internal perception; but supposing there 
were such perception, and that it were not such as to be neces- 
sarily confused with that of resistance or inertia of the con- 
tracted muscle, which accompanies or immediately follows it, 
one still could not regard it as the symbolical sign of individual- 
ity or of the self, which can begin to know itself, or to exist for 
itself, only so far as it can distinguish itself as subject of effort 
from an object which resists. Thus the kind of obscure per- 
ception which would correspond to this incomplete action 
which is performed from a single centre upon a homogeneous 
nervous system, would be still only a vague and confused feel- 
ing of existence, to which perhaps some species of animals are 
limited. To the second moment corresponds that which takes
-P-A-G-E-474
  
  452 THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY 
place in the motor system, from the instant when the muscle 
contracts, until the effect of the contraction is transmitted or 
carried to the centre, where the muscular sensation then takes 
on this characteristic of reduplication which constitutes the 
inner consciousness of effort, inseparable from a resistance, or 
the inner consciousness of the self which knows itself by dis- 
tinguishing itself from the resisting object. 
Let us now pass from the symbol or the sign to the thing sig- 
nified, and compare the internal facts with the hypotheses or the 
physiological facts. 
We know, from a very constant experience, that the sentient 
being can never give to itself by any exercise of its activity, 
those agreeable or disagreeable impressions which affects it in 
spite of itself; that it is not the artisan nor the creator of those 
sensations or of those images which come into existence, suc- 
ceed one another or disappear, without any concurrence of its 
will, or even against its desire. We know, moreover, from the 
observation of sentient nature, and from the various experi- 
ments of physiologists, that there exist sure and constant 
means to set in play the animal sensitivity by appropriate 
excitations, and to draw from the sentient being all the signs of 
the affections, of pain, or of physical pleasure, that one makes it 
undergo. The internal sense of effort on the other hand can be 
set in play only by this force, which is interior and sui generis, 
that we call will, and with which what we call our self is com- 
pletely identified. 
The power of effort, or the ability to commence and to con- 
tinue any series of movements or of actions, is a fact of inner 
sense as evident as that of our existence itself. There is no for- 
eign force to which that power is necessarily subordinated. 
Observe thus, how powerless all the external or artificial means 
may be which would tend to imitate the results of that acting 
force, or to reproduce and to provoke the signs of its manifes- 
tation. If you apply a stimulus, either directly upon a muscle, 
or upon the trunk, or the nervous centre which send ramifica- 
tions to it, you of a certainty bring about contractions, sensed 
in the living, and purely organic in the dead. In regard to the
-P-A-G-E-475
  MAINE DE BIRAN 453 
will of man, or the power of effort, it dwells in independence in 
the innermost being, beyond all reach of any excitation from 
without. Neither the inducements of pleasure, nor the goads of 
pain, are capable of irresistibly compelling it. When it exer- 
cises itself, all physiological laws are disturbed; all the ex- 
ternal signs of sensitivity or of contractility are uncertain, and 
can be quiescent or deceptive. How powerless, for example, 
the most excruciating pain over the will of a Mucius 
Scevola? Before it yields, the arm which it holds motionless 
upon the burning coals will be reduced to ashes. Is not then the 
force which thus dominates sensibility and rules it by its own 
laws, which compels the body to stop or to rush forward, even 
when its instinct urges it to flight, a force that is specific and 
sui juris. 
But still we cannot speak of that moral force guided by 
motives which can render effort sublime. Before motives to 
act exist, there is surely a power of movement or of action; be- 
fore this movement has become means, it has first been itself 
the aim or proper end of the willing. Finally it is necessary that 
the seif shall have begun to exist for itself, or to circumscribe 
itself in its own domain, before extending over nature its 
constitutive force. Thereby are justified those considerations 
which might appear to us somewhat too minute, and to others 
too closely allied to this materialism which they are calculated 
to attack in its first foundation. 
For us, therefore, who are here occupied only with a primi- 
tive fact of the inner sense, the willis as yet only the power of 
effort. We have just characterised this force through the signs, 
or the first conditions, or the instruments of its exercise. We 
now need to seek by analysis, what may be the origin of this 
exercise, and that of the individual personality which cannot be 
separated from it. But before entering upon this analysis, let 
us summarise the consequences of what precedes. 
1. The primitive fact of the inner sense is none other than that 
of a voluntary effort, inseparable from some organic resistance, 
or from some muscular sensation of which the se/f is cause. This 
fact is thus a relation of which the two terms are distinct with-
-P-A-G-E-476
  454 THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY 
out being separated. In order that they should be separated, 
it would be necessary, under the physiological hypothesis taken 
as a symbol, that the immediate action exerted from the centre 
upon the motor nerves be accompanied by a particular internal 
perception, distinct and separate from the muscular sensation; 
but therefore, the same internal perception would consist in an- 
other relation still more inner, between the hyperorganic force 
exerted from the centre and the nerves upon which it immedi- 
ately acts. It would be, therefore, the nervous inertia which 
would replace in that case the muscular inertia, and the charac- 
ter of the primitive fact would not be changed. 
2. The essential character of the primitive fact consists in 
that, that neither one nor the other of the terms of the funda- 
mental] relation is constituted in nécessary dependence upon the 
impressions from without. Hence the knowledge of the se/f can 
be separated in its principle from that of the external universe. 
3. The effort-cause, or the self has the internal consciousness 
of its existence as soon as it can distinguish this cause, which is 
itself, from the effect or from the contraction referred to the 
organic object, which is no longer itself, and which it places 
outside.* 
4. The primitive fact which necessarily serves as the point 
of departure to science, therefore resolves itself into a primary 
effort, where analysis is still able to distinguish two elements: a 
hyperorganic force naturaily in relation with a living resistance. 
5. The idea or reflexive abstract notion of force is later 
deduced from the fact, or from the primitive feeling of effort. 
In following an inverse course and starting from the idea of 
absolute force, all the metaphysicians, up to and inclusive of 
Locke, have displaced the origin of science. They have desired 
to deduce the actual and the real from the possible: that was 
to begin in darkness. 
We do not fear to lose ourselves in darkness by seeking at 
present how effort can begin to be willed, what the origin is of 
this primary action, of this free will, which is the primary condi- 
1 We shall see that this outside is not external extensity, nor even the form of 
space, such as the Kantians conceive it, as inherent to sensibility.
-P-A-G-E-477
  
MAINE DE BIRAN 455 
tion of the consciousness of one’s self, and, consequently, of all 
other consciousness. We have a thread which guides us in these 
researches, and which, if it does not lead to the absolute truth 
which we seek, enables us at least not to lose ourselves in ideal 
regions, whence there would be no outlet or means to retrace 
our steps. 
CHAPTER II. THE ORIGIN OF EFFORT, AND OF 
PERSONALITY 
Ir it were true, as philosophers who have attempted to 
derive everything from desire think, that will were nothing 
other than desire, which itself is confused with a first need of 
the organised living being; if it were true, or conformed to the 
facts of the inner sense, that instinctive determinations, re- 
garded as completed sensations, embraced judgment, desire, 
or will; if finally it were true, that the very first movement made 
by each of us had been accompanied by will, it would be very 
useless to seek, I do not say, the origin of that absolute force 
identical with the soul, or of that which stands for it in all sys- 
tems, but the origin of the feeling of its exercise, or of the effort 
with which the ego identifies itself. This origin indeed would be 
confused with the first rudiments of life, and would be tracec 
back to the organic germ which possibly exists before fecunda- 
tion. If this system were that of nature, it would turn out I have 
pursued up to the present only a chimera, and all the precise 
distinctions I have sought to establish would disappear like 
vain shadows. The obligation is thus imposed upon me to 
make it evident that my present researches have a real object, 
or that there may be an origin of voluntary effort or of the 
self, posterior in order of time to the birth of the sentient being, 
to the first instinctive determinations, to the needs, and even 
to the desire, which differ from the will, properly so called, as 
passion differs from action. 
I am going at the outset to place myself anew at the physi- 
ological point of view, and upon the very ground of the 
philosophers who have assimilated or confounded in the origin,
-P-A-G-E-478
  456 THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY 
everything that I believe should be distinguished or even 
separated, in order to have a science of principles. If the dis- 
tinctions that I establish turn out to be confirmed by physio- 
logy itself they are doubtless likely to receive in consequence 
more weight and value in the eyes of those to whom I take the 
liberty of opposing them. 
According to the principles of a physiologist,! who was gifted 
with the genius of experiment rather than with the talent for 
classification, one is justified in the recognition of three modes, 
or three kinds of muscular contractility, which are distin- 
guished among themselves in the same manner as the causes 
which produce or determine the contractions. The first kind is 
a simple organic property inherent to the muscular fibre, and 
which has been known since Haller by the term irritability. We 
have no need to know up to what point the nervous influence 
contributes to set it in action, because this property, simply 
vital, happens to be outside of the object of our researches. 
Vhat is of importance to us, is to recognise the truly distin- 
guishing characteristics in the sentient contractility, which may 
also be called azimal, and a contractility properly voluntary. 
Let us seek, therefore, to specify clearly the physiological char- 
acteristics of these two kinds. Both of them expressly relate to 
cerebral influence, but under very different conditions, and it 
is not permissible to confuse them even physiologically. 
Affective impressions excited in the nervous system by for- 
eign or inner causes, being transmitted to the brain or to some 
other of the partial centres, determine those powerful reactions 
which tend to set in play the locomotor organs: hence the ani- 
mal contractions and all the instinctive movements. I have 
just spoken of partial centres as of points of reaction, because 
it is not proved that it is the direct influence of a single centre 
which determines always the instinctive locomotion of animals 
as of the foetus, and several analogies tend to prove the opposite. 
Supposing, what appears to be contradicted by many physiolog- 
ical observations, that a single centre determines solely by its 
reaction the kind of movement which is in question here, at 
1 Cf. Bichat’s Recherches physiologiques sur la vie et la mort.
-P-A-G-E-479
  MAINE DE BIRAN 487 
least it is true that this centre plays in that case a passive or 
merely sympathetic réle influenced, as it is, by the impres- 
sions of the internal or external nervous organs which are the 
true determining causes of these animal contractions. 
But in the contraction that is strictly voluntary, it is clearly 
in a single centre that the action commences which, without 
being provoked or compelled by any foreign impression, is 
transmitted directly to the organs of movement by the inter- 
mediary of the nerves. We find here the only true sign of vol- 
untary effort, such as we have characterised it. 
As the voluntary contraction thus differs from the animal 
contraction, so likewise the will, the individual and free power 
of effort and movement, differ from appetite, need, and all feel- 
ings of discomfort, of disquietude, etc. which have been arbi- 
trarily united under the general term of wi//. Here both the psy- 
chological and physiological points of view perfectly correspond. 
The sympathetic reaction of the centre, which occasions the 
animal contractions or the instinctive movements, is the sign of 
aflective desire very improperly called will. The action, com- 
mencing in a single centre, which occasions the voluntary 
movement that is in the power of the individual to make or not 
to make, is the proper sign of an impelling will. The general 
faculty in question from the first physiological point of view, is 
not only subordinated to, but identical with the sensibility con- 
sidered as the principle or the cause which determines animal 
movement. It is, therefore, not necessary to seek any other 
origin for it than that of life itself of the organised being, which 
feels only so far as it is moved, and which moves only as far as 
it feels. In this case, it is conditionally true to say that the first 
of all movements has been accompanied by desire or by will, 
and that the instinctive determinations, being sensations as the 
others, include judgment, desire, etc. The individual faculty 
which is in question in the second point of view, far from being 
subordinate to the sensibility, is most often in opposition to it; 
and we have already seen that it has its peculiar and primor- 
dial laws, outside the circle of all affective impressions. 
The experience of the inner sense suffices to assure us in fact  
-P-A-G-E-480
    458 THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY 
that, in the cases in which movements of any kind are com- 
pelled and abruptly incited by violent appetites, passions, or 
too emotional excitations of the sensibility, we ourselves move, 
or rather our body moves without our leave, without, or even 
against the explicit orders of the will, which is oppressed and 
as it were nullified, by the very fact that sensibility predomin- 
ates or rules exclusively. How could it therefore be possible 
that the same affective impressions, which destroy the control 
of the will, and absorb or hamper that power, evén when it is 
already fully established, would originally serve to develop 
it and to set it in exercise? How is it possible to suppose that 
the being, which begins to live, can perceive or feel its own 
movements, and begin to derive therefrom some knowledge, 
when we ourselves are completely ignorant alike of the cause 
and of the effect of those movements, in the midst of the dis- 
turbance of the affections which provoke or even prevail over 
them? How finally could the very principle, which obscures 
and so often extinguishes in us the light of consciousness, have 
been the first source of it? 
Weare, therefore, justified in saying from our present stand- 
point, that the first movements, which are determined by ap- 
petite or organic need, or even accompanied by desire, differ 
as much from will properly so-called, as the peculiar and direct 
action exerted from a single centre differs from all sympathetic 
reactions. Thus, the first acts of this nascent will, explained in 
its principles, differ from the blind determinations of instinct, 
which precedes them in the order of time, but without serving 
them in their origin. There is then occasion to seek by an 
explicit analysis of primitive facts, what is the order of progress 
or of conditions which may have produced the first exercise of 
the individual power of effort, and with it the first feeling of the 
self ; that which is equivalent to asking what is the law, either 
physiological or psychological, of the transition from instinctive 
movements, to voluntary and free movements, accompanied 
by effort. 
As long as the organic centre, to which physiologists refer 
motor determination, only reacts in consequence of the impres-
-P-A-G-E-481
  MAINE DE BIRAN 459 
sions which it receives from diverse sensitive organs with which 
it is in relation, the movements thus produced, not being capa- 
ble of being perceived or felt as distinct from their producing 
causes, cannot even begin to be voluntary. For if distinct per- 
ception is not anterior, as I believe, to any exercise whatever of 
the will, neither can this latter in its turn precede any degree 
whatsoever of perception; and although it may be true to say, 
that the thinking being cannot begin to know save in so far as 
he begins to act and to will, it is none the less true, in the ordin- 
ary phrase, that one cannot expressly will that of which one 
has no knowledge. 
If one appears to revolve here in a vicious circle, the reason 
is, that as a result of having failed to recognize the truly prim- 
itive fact, one wishes to distinguish or separate two acts which 
are reduced to one in this fact, and that one already applies the 
law of succession, or like the Kantians, the complete form of 
time, to the first term of every succession, at the origin of all 
time. 
Through the indeterminate order of the progress of being, 
simple in the vital stage, but destined to become double in the 
human stage,! a period arrives when the exclusive rule of instinct 
tends to end or to be united to another order of faculties. Al- 
ready the impressions begin to become less vivid, less general, 
less tumultuous; habit has blunted their edge which was at first 
strongly affective; the appetites are less pressing, the move- 
ments less brusque, less automatic; the organs of locomotion 
begin to harden, their special irritability diminishes; they yield 
less promptly to every external cause of contraction. Thus, on 
the one side, these organs have contracted habits in repeated 
instinctive locomotion, and they are disposed in such way to 
comply with more facility to the new contractions that the will 
is to impose upon them; on the other hand, the motor centre 
has also acquired in reacting such determinations that it is 
capable of entering spontaneously into action, by virtue of that 
general law of habit, in consequence of which a living organ 
1 Homo simplex in vitalitate, duplex in humanitate, says Boerhaave energet- 
ically, and with profound truth. 
 
-P-A-G-E-482
  460 THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY 
tends to renew of itself the impressions or the movements 
that a foreign cause has a number of times aroused in it, or in 
consequence of which makes it own the dispositions of another 
organ with which it has sympathetically shared. 
When the centre thus accomplishes movements by its own 
and initial action, the latter take a wholly different character, 
and become spontaneous, instead of being instinctive as they 
were at the outset. Now this spontaneity is still not the will, or 
the power of effort, but it immediately precedes it. By virtue 
of the spontaneity of action of the centre, which is the imme- 
diate term or proper instrument of the hyperorganic force of the 
soul, that force, which could neither perceive nor distinctly feel 
the instructive movements, begins to feel the spontaneous 
movements which no emotion troubles or disturbs. But it can- 
not begin to feel them thus as produced by its immediate in- 
strument, without appropriating to itself their power. As soon 
as it feels that power, it exerts it by accomplishing that move- 
ment itself. As soon as it effects it, it perceives its effort with 
the resistance, it is a cause for itself, and in relation to the 
effect that it produces, with freedom, it is the self. 
Thus personality begins with the first complete action of a 
hyperorganic force which is for itself, or as self, only in so far as 
it knows itself, and which begins to know itself only in so far as 
it begins to act with freedom. The problem is not to know 
what that force is in itself, how it exists, or when it begins 
absolutely to exist, but when it begins to exist as an identical 
person, as self. Now it exists for itself only in so far as it knows 
itself, and it knows itself only in so far as it acts. 
Although the primitive fact, of which we seek to determine 
the source, seems to escape, in that source itself, from every 
kind of experiment, and presents itself only as an hypothesis, 
we can nevertheless discover some examples adapted to explain, 
up to a certain point, the origin of personality, such as we have 
just established it. 
1. Insleep of the mind or of the self, it occurs sometimes that 
one is awakened with a start in consequence of movements, of 
words or of voices, produced by a spontaneity resembling that
-P-A-G-E-483
  MAINE DE BIRAN 461 
which serves originally as intermediary between instinct and 
will. At the very instant of this sudden awakening, the indi- 
vidual feels these movements, not accompanied with effort as 
they are in the state of waking, but with a feeling of power to 
make them, which is, in this case, the memory of that effort. It 
is in this way that he appropriates to himself in their result 
those spontaneous movements that he has not determined in 
their principle, and that conscious appropriation characterises 
solely the perfect awakening. Therefore, in the origin of person- 
ality, spontaneous movement awakens the soul, causes to arise 
in it, as it were, the presentiment of a power which determines 
the first voluntary effort, and with it the first knowledge. 
2. In the newborn infant, and even during a certain period 
after birth, the locomotion and voice are set in action only by 
instinct. The infant frets and cries because it suffers, and in so 
far as it is affected by simple needs or appetites. As long as 
this purely sensitive state continues, will and apperception can- 
not exist; for how can you suppose that the first cries of pain, 
the first automatic movements, are acts of a faculty of will and 
of judgment already in exercise, unless you admit these faculties 
as innate or unconditioned? Without doubt the cries of an 
infant have a significance or a natural sense, but that is for an 
intelligent being capable of understanding or of interpreting it, 
and not for the infant reduced to sensations and to animal con- 
tractions. But apart from the exclusive domain of the affec- 
tions, of the needs or appetites of instinct, the infant still cries 
and frets by virtue of the determinations or of the habits con- 
tracted by the motor centre and by the organs of movement or 
of the voice. These movements then spontaneous are veritable 
sensations. Soon they will be perceived, willed and trans- 
formed by the infant itself, into involuntary signs of which it will 
make use in order to call for aid. Behold the first stage of man, 
duplex in humanitate, the first sign of nascent personality. The 
transition sought for is then accomplished. But how could it 
have been possible, if the movements had always been the pro- 
ducts of an instinctive and sympathetic reaction, carried away 
yand repelled by vivid emotions, and finally if there had not
-P-A-G-E-484
  462 THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY 
been an intermediary mode of motility such, that sensation, 
distinct from the movement performed, be accompanied by a 
feeling of power, and gives rise consequently to the exercise of 
the will? Such is the order or the series of progress; such 
is the transition from instinct to spontaneity, and from that to 
the will, which constitutes the person, the self. The animal 
rapidly passes beyond the first two degrees; man alone can 
attain to the third, but he attains it only progressively, accord- 
ing to certain laws or conditions, that philosophy should seek 
to know in order to find the principles and origin of science. If 
we have not been able to dispel all the clouds which conceal 
that origin, we have at least shown how, and in what sense, it is 
necessary to admit an assignable origin of personality; how or 
by what procedure of analysis, one can hope to find it identi- 
fied, not with the first sensation of a passive substance, but with 
the first action of a hyperorganic force.

CHAPTER III. THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS 
“To have a clear view of the phenomena of the mind, as mere affections or 
states of it, existing successively, and in a certain series, which we are able, there-

Tuoucut succeeds thought; idea follows idea, incessantly. 
If our senses are awake, we are continually receiving sensa- 
tions, of the eye, the ear, the touch, and so forth; but not sensa- 
tions alone. After sensations, ideas are perpetually excited of 
sensations formerly received; after those ideas, other ideas: and 
during the whole of our lives, a series of those two states of con- 
sciousness, called sensations, and ideas, is constantly going on. 
I see a horse: that is a sensation. Immediately I think of his 
master: that is an idea. The idea of his master makes me think 
of his office; he is a minister of state: that is another idea. The 
idea of a minister of state makes me think of public affairs; and 
Tam led into a train of political ideas; when I am summoned to 
dinner. This is a new sensation, followed by the idea of dinner, 
and of the company with whom I am to partake it. The sight 
of the company and of the food are other sensations; these sug- 
gest ideas without end; other sensations perpetually intervene, 
suggesting other ideas: and so the process goes on. 
In contemplating this train of feelings, of which our lives 
consist, it first of all strikes the contemplator, as of importance

to ascertain, whether they occur casually and irregularly, or 
according to a certain order. 
With respect to the SENSATIONS, it is obvious enough that 
they occur, according to the order established among what we 
call the objects of nature, whatever those objects are; to ascer- 
tain more and more of which order is the business of physical 
philosophy in all its branches. 
Of the order established among the objects of nature, by 
which we mean the objects of our senses, two remarkable cases 
are all which here we are called upon to notice; the SYNCHRON- 
OUS ORDER and the SUCCESSIVE ORDER. The synchronous order, 
or order of simultaneous existence, is the order in space; the 
successive order, or order of antecedent and consequent exist- 
ence, is the order in time. Thus the various objects in my 
room, the chairs, the tables, the books, have the synchronous 
order, or order in space. The falling of the spark, and the ex- 
plosion of the gunpowder, have the successive order, or order 
in time. 
According to this order, in the objects of sense, there is a 
synchronous, and a successive, order of our sensations. I have 
SYNCHRONICALLY, or at the same instant, the sight of a great 
variety of objects; touch of all the objects with which my body 
is in contact; hearing of all the sounds which are reaching my 
ears; smelling of all the smells which are reaching my nostrils; 
taste of the apple which I am eating; the sensation of resistance 
both from the apple which is in my mouth, and the ground on 
which I stand; with the sensation of motion from the act of 
walking. I have succEssIveELy the sight of the flash from the 
mortar fired at a distance, the hearing of the report, the sight 
of the bomb, and of its motion in the air, the sight of its fall, the 
sight and hearing of its explosion, and lastly, the sight of all the 
effects of that explosion. 
Among the objects which I have thus observed synchron- 
ically, or successively; that is, from which I have had synchron- 
ical or successive sensations; there are some which I have so 
observed frequently; others which I have so observed not fre- 
quently: in other words, of my sensations some have been fre-
-P-A-G-E-487
  
PHENOMENA OF THE HUMAN MIND 465 
quently synchronical, others not frequently; some frequently 
successive, others not frequently. Thus, my sight of roast beef, 
and my taste of roast beef, have been frequently SYNCHRONICAL; 
my smell of a rose, and my sight and touch of a rose, have been 
frequently synchronical; my sight of a stone, and my sensa- 
tions of its hardness, and weight, have been frequently syn- 
chronical. Others of my sensations have not been frequently 
synchronical: my sight of a lion, and the hearing of his roar; 
my sight of a knife, and its stabbing a man. My sight of the 
flash of lightning, and my hearing of the thunder, have been 
often SUCCESSIVE; the pain of cold, and the pleasure of heat, 
have been often successive; the sight of a trumpet, and the 
sound of a trumpet, have been often successive. On the other 
hand, my sight of hemlock, and my taste of hemlock, have not 
been often successive: and so on. 
It so happens, that, of the objects from which we derive the 
greatest part of our sensations, most of those which are ob- 
served synchronically, are frequently observed synchronically; 
most of those which are observed successively, are frequently 
observed successively. In other words, most of our synchron- 
ical sensations, have been frequently synchronical; most of our 
successive sensations, have been frequently successive. Thus, 
most of our synchronical sensations are derived from the objects 
around us, the objects which we have the most frequent occa- 
sion to hear and see; the members of our family; the furniture 
of our houses; our food; the instruments of our occupations or 
amusements. In like manner, of those sensations which we 
have had in succession, we have had the greatest number 
repeatedly in succession; the sight of fire, and its warmth; the 
touch of snow, and its cold; the sight of food, and its taste. 
Thus much with regard to the order of SENSATIONS; next 
with regard to the order of IDEAS. 
As ideas are not derived from objects, we’ should not expect 
their order to be derived from the order of objects; but as they 
are derived from sensations, we might by analogy expect, that 
they would derive their order from that of the sensations; and 
this to a great extent is the case.  
-P-A-G-E-488
  466 JAMES MILL 
Our ideas spring up, or exist, in the order in which the sensa- 
tions existed, of which they are the copies. 
This is the general law of the “Association of Ideas”; by 
which term, let it be remembered, nothing is here meant to be 
expressed, but the order of occurrence. 
In this law, the following things are to be carefully observed. 
1. Of those sensations which occurred synchronically, the 
ideas also spring up synchronically. I have seen a violin, and 
heard the tones of the violin, synchronically. If I think of the 
tones of the violin, the visible appearance of the violin at the 
same time occurs to me. I have seen the sun, and the sky in 
which it is placed, synchronically. If I think of the one, I think 
of the other at the same time. 
One of the cases of synchronical sensation, which deserves 
the most particular attention, is, that of the several sensations 
derived from one and the same object; a stone, for example, 
a flower, a table, a chair, a horse, a man. 
From a stone I have had, synchronically, the sensation of 
colour, the sensation of hardness, the sensations of shape, and 
size, the sensation of weight. When the idea of one of these 
sensations occurs, the ideas of all of them occur. They exist in 
my mind synchronically; and their synchronical existence is 
called the idea of the stone; which, it is thus plain, is not a single 
idea, but a number of ideas in a particular state of combina- 
tion. 
Thus, again, I have smelt a rose, and looked at, and handled 
a rose, synchronically; accordingly the name rose suggests to 
me all those ideas synchronically ; and this combination of those 
simple ideas is called my idea of the rose. 
My idea of an animal is still more complex. The word thrush, 
for example, not only suggests an idea of a particular colour and 
shape, and size, but of song, and flight, and nestling, and eggs, 
and callow young, and others. 
My idea of a man is the most complex of all; including not 
only colour, and shape, and voice, but the whole class of events 
in which I have observed him either the agent or the patient. 
2. As the ideas of the.sensations which occurred synchron-
-P-A-G-E-489
PHENOMENA OF THE HUMAN MIND 467 
ically, rise synchronically, so the ideas of the sensations which 
occurred successively, rise successively. 
Of this important case of association, or of the successive 
order of our ideas, many remarkable instances might be ad- 
duced. Of these none seems better adapted to the learner than 
the repetition of any passage, or words; the Lord’s Prayer, for 
example, committed to memory. In learning the passage, we 
repeat it; that is, we pronounce the words, in successive order, 
from the beginning to the end. The order of the sensations is 
successive. When we proceed to repeat the passage, the ideas 
of the words also rise in succession, the preceding always sug- 
gesting the succeeding, and no other. Our suggests Father, 
Father suggests which, which suggests art; and so on, to the end. 
How remarkably this is the case, any one may convince him- 
self, by trying to repeat backwards, even a passage with which 
he is as familiar as the Lord’s Prayer. The case is the same 
with numbers. A man can go on with the numbers in the pro- 
gressive order, one, two, three, &c. scarcely thinking of his act; 
and though it is possible for him to repeat them backward, be- 
cause he is accustomed to subtraction of numbers, he cannot do 
so without an effort. 
Of witnesses in courts of justice it has been remarked, that 
eye-witnesses, and ear-witnesses, always tell their story in the 
chronological order; in other words, the ideas occur to them in 
the order in which the sensations occurred; on the other hand, 
that witnesses, who are inventing, rarely adhere to the chrono- 
logical order. 
3. A far greater number of our sensations are received in the 
successive, than in the synchronical order. Of our ideas, also, 
the number is infinitely greater that rise in the successive than 
the synchronical order. 
4. In the successive order of ideas, that which precedes, is 
sometimes called the suggesting, that which succeeds, the sug- 
gested idea; not that any power is supposed to reside in the ante- 
cedent over the consequent; suggesting, and suggested, mean 
only antecedent and consequent, with the additional idea, that 
such order is not casual, but, to a certain degree, permanent.  
-P-A-G-E-490
  468 JAMES MILL 
5. Of the antecedent and consequent feelings, or the suggest- 
ing, and suggested; the antecedent may be either sensations or 
ideas; the consequent are always ideas. An idea may be excited 
either by a sensation or an idea. The sight of the dog of my 
friend is a sensation, and it excites the idea of my friend. The 
idea of Professor Dugald Stewart delivering a lecture, recalls 
the idea of the delight with which I heard him; that, the idea 
of the studies in which it engaged me; that, the trains of thought 
which succeeded; and each epoch of my mental history, the 
succeeding one, till the present moment; in which I am en- 
deavouring to present to others what appears to me valuable 
among the innumerable ideas of which this lengthened train 
has been composed. 
6. As there are degrees in sensations, and degrees in ideas; for 
one sensation is more vivid than another sensation, one idea 
more vivid than another idea; so there are degrees in associa- 
tion. One association, we say, is stronger than another: First, 
when it is more permanent than another: Secondly, when it is 
performed with more certainty: Thirdly, when it is performed 
with more facility. 
It is well known, that some associations are very transient, 
others very permanent. The case which we formerly men- 
tioned, that of repeating words committed to memory, affords 
an apt illustration. In some cases, we can perform the repeti- 
tion, when a few hours, or a few days have elapsed; but not 
after a longer period. In others, we can perform it after the 
lapse of many years. There are few children in whose minds 
some association has not been formed between darkness and 
ghosts. In some this association is soon dissolved; in some it 
continues for life. 
In some cases the association takes place with less, in some 
with greater certainty. Thus, in repeating words, I am not 
sure that I shall not commit mistakes, if they are imperfectly 
got; and I may at one trial repeat them right, at another 
wrong: I am sure of always repeating those correctly, which I 
have got perfectly. Thus, in my native language, the associa- 
tion between the name and the thing is certain; in a language
-P-A-G-E-491
  PHENOMENA OF THE HUMAN MIND 469 
with which I am imperfectly acquainted, not certain. In ex- 
pressing myself in my own language, the idea of the thing sug- 
gests the idea of the name with certainty. In speaking a lan- 
guage with which I am imperfectly acquainted, the idea of the 
thing does not with certainty suggest the idea of the name; at 
one time it may, at another not. 
That ideas are associated in some cases with more, in some 
with less facility, is strikingly illustrated by the same instance, 
of a language with which we are well, and a language with 
which we are imperfectly, acquainted. In speaking our own 
language, we are not conscious of any effort; the associations 
between the words and the ideas appear spontaneous. In 
endeavouring to speak a language with which we are im- 
perfectly acquainted, we are sensible of a painful effort: the 
associations between the words and ideas being not ready, or 
immediate. 
7. The causes of strength in association seem all to be re- 
solvable into two; the vividness of the associated feelings; and 
the frequency of the association. 
In general, we convey not a very precise meaning, when we 
speak of the vividness of sensations and ideas. We may be 
understood when we say that, generally speaking, the sensation 
is more vivid than the idea; or the primary, than the secondary 
feeling; though in dreams, and in delirium, ideas are mistaken 
for sensations. But when we say that one sensation is more 
vivid than another, there is much more uncertainty. We can 
distinguish those sensations which are pleasurable, and those 
which are painful, from such as are not so; and when we call the 
pleasurable and painful more vivid, than those which are not 
so, we speak intelligibly. We can also distinguish degrees of 
pleasure, and of pain; and when we call the sensation of the 
higher degree more vivid than the sensation of the lower 
degree, we may again be considered as expressing a meaning 
tolerably precise. 
In calling one IDEA more vivid than another, if we confine the 
appellation to the ideas of such SENSATIONS as may with preci- 
sion be called more or less vivid; the sensations of pleasure and  
-P-A-G-E-492
  470 JAMES MILL 
pain, in their various degrees, compared with sensations which 
we do not call either pleasurable or painful; our language will 
still have a certain degree of precision. But what is the meaning 
which I annex to my words, when I say, that my idea of the 
taste of the pine-apple which I tasted yesterday is vivid; my 
idea of the taste of the foreign fruit which I never tasted but 
once in early life, is not vivid? If I mean that I can more cer- 
tainly distinguish the more recent, than the more distant sensa- 
tion, there is still some precision in my language; because it 
seems true of all my senses, that if I compare a distant sensa- 
tion with the present, I am less sure of its being or not being a 
tepetition of the same, than if I compare a recent sensation 
with a present one. Thus, if I yesterday had a smell of a very 
peculiar kind, and compare it with a present smell, I can judge 
more accurately of the agreement or disagreement of the two 
sensations, than if I compared the present with one much more 
remote. The same is the case with colours, with sounds, with 
feelings of touch, and of resistance. It is therefore sufficiently 
certain, that the idea of the more recent sensation affords the 
means of a more accurate comparison, generally, than the idea 
of the more remote sensation. And thus we have three cases 
of vividness, of which we can speak with some precision: the 
case of sensations, as compared with ideas; the case of pleas- 
urable and painful sensations, and their ideas as compared 
with those which are not pleasurable or painful; and the case of 
the more recent, compared with the more remote. 
That the association of two ideas, but for once, does, in some 
cases, give them a very strong connection, is within the sphere 
of every man’s experience. The most remarkable cases are 
probably those of pain and pleasure. Some persons who have 
experienced a very painful surgical operation, can never after- 
wards bear the sight of the operator, however strong the grati- 
tude which they may actually feel towards him. The meaning 
is, that the sight of the operator, by a strong association, calls 
up so vividly the idea of the pain of the operation, that it is 
itself a pain. The spot on which a tender maiden parted with 
her lover, when he embarked on the voyage from which he
-P-A-G-E-493
  PHENOMENA OF THE HUMAN MIND 471 
never returned, cannot afterwards be seen by her without an 
agony of grief. 
These cases, also, furnish an apt illustration of the superior- 
ity which the sensation possesses over the idea, asan associating 
cause. Though the sight of the surgeon, the sight of the place, 
would awaken the ideas which we have described, the mere 
thought of them might be attended with no peculiar effect. 
Those persons who have the association of frightful objects with 
darkness, and who are transported with terrors when placed in 
the dark, can still think of darkness without any emotion. 
The same cases furnish an illustration of the effect of recency 
on the strength of association. The sight, of the affecting spot 
by the maiden, of the surgeon by the patient, would certainly 
produce a more intense emotion, after a short, than after a long 
interval. With most persons, time would weaken, and at last 
dissolve, the association. 
So much with regard to vividness, as a cause of strong asso- 
ciations. Next, we have to consider frequency or repetition; 
which is the most remarkable and important cause of the 
strength of our associations. 
Of any two sensations, frequently perceived together, the 
ideas are associated. Thus, at least, in the minds of English- 
men, the idea of a soldier, and the idea of a red coat are asso- 
ciated ; the idea of a clergyman, and the idea of a black coat; the 
idea of a quaker, and of a broad-brimmed hat; the idea of a 
woman and the idea of petticoats. A peculiar taste suggests 
the idea of an apple; a peculiar smell the idea of a rose. If I 
have heard a particular air frequently sung by a particular per- 
son, the hearing of the air suggests the idea of the person. 
The most remarkable exemplification of the effect of degrees 
of frequency, in producing degrees of strength in the associa- 
tions, is to be found in the cases in which the association is pur- 
posely and studiously contracted; the cases in which we learn 
something; the use of words, for example. 
Every child learns the language which is spoken by those 
around him. He also learns it by degrees. He learns first the 
names of the most familiar objects; and among familiar objects, 
 
-P-A-G-E-494
  
  472 JAMES MILL 
the names of those which he most frequently has occasion to 
name; himself, his nurse, his food, his playthings. 
A sound heard once in conjunction with another sensation; 
the word mamma, for example, with the sight of a woman, 
would produce no greater effect on the child, than the conjunc- 
tion of any other sensation, which once exists and is gone for- 
ever. But if the word mamma is frequently pronounced, in 
conjunction with the sight of a particular woman, the sound 
will by degrees become associated with the sight; and as the 
pronouncing of the name will call up the idea of the woman, so 
the sight of the woman will call up the idea of the name. 
The process becomes very perceptible to us, when, at years 
of reflection, we proceed to learn a dead or foreign language. At 
the first lesson, we are told, or we see in the dictionary, the 
meaning of perhaps twenty words. But it is not joining the 
word and its meaning once, that will make the word suggest its 
meaning to us another time. We repeat the two in conjunction, 
till we think the meaning so well associated with the word, 
that whenever the word occurs to us, the meaning will occur 
along with it. We are often deceived in this anticipation; and 
finding that the meaning is not suggested by the word, we have 
to renew the process of repetition, and this, perhaps, again, and 
again. By force of repetition the meaning is associated, at 
last, with every word of the language, and so perfectly, that 
the one never occurs to us without the other. 
Learning to play on a musical instrument is another remark- 
able illustration of the effect of repetition in strengthening 
associations, in rendering those sequences, which, at first, are 
slow, and difficult, afterwards, rapid, and easy. At first, the 
learner, after thinking of each successive note, as it stands in 
his book, has each time to look out with care for the key or the 
string which he is to touch, and the finger he is to touch it with, 
and is every moment committing mistakes. Repetition is well 
known to be the only means of overcoming these difficulties. 
As the repetition goes on, the sight of the note, or even the idea 
of the note, becomes associated with the place of the key or the 
string; and that of the key or the string with the proper finger.
-P-A-G-E-495
  PHENOMENA OF THE HUMAN MIND 473 
The association for a time is imperfect, but at last becomes so 
strong, that it is performed with the greatest rapidity, without 
an effort, and almost without consciousness. 
In few cases is the strength of association, derived from repe- 
tition, more worthy of attention, than in performing arithme- 
tic. All men, whose practice is not great, find the addition of a 
long column of numbers, tedious, and the accuracy of the oper- 
ation, by no means certain. Till a man has had considerable 
practice, there are few acts of the mind more toilsome. The 
reason is, that the names of the numbers, which correspond to 
the different steps, do not readily occur; that is, are not 
strongly associated with the names which precede them. Thus, 
7 added to 5, make 12; but the antecedent, 7 added to 5, is not 
strongly associated with the consequent 12, in the mind of the 
learner, and he has to wait and search till the name occurs. 
Thus, again, 12 and 7 make 19; 19 and 8 make 27, and so on to 
any amount; but if the practice of the performer has been small, 
the association in each instance is imperfect, and the process 
irksome and slow. Practice, however; that is, frequency of 
repetition; makes the association between each of these antece- 
dents and its proper consequent so perfect, that no sooner is the 
one conceived than the other is conceived, and an expert arith- 
metician can tell the amount of a long column of figures, with a 
rapidity, which seems almost miraculous to the man whose 
faculty of numeration is of the ordinary standard. 
8. Where two or more ideas have been often repeated to- 
gether, and the association has become very strong, they 
sometimes spring up in such close combination as not to be 
distinguishable. Some cases of sensation are analogous. For 
example; when a wheel, on the seven parts of which the seven 
prismatic colours are respectively painted, is made to revolve 
rapidly, it appears not of seven colours, but of one uniform 
colour, white. By the rapidity of the succession, the several 
sensations cease to be distinguishable; they run, as it were, 
together, and a new sensation, compounded of all the seven, 
but apparently a simple one, is the result. Ideas, also, which 
have been so often conjoined, that whenever one exists in the
-P-A-G-E-496
  474. JAMES MILL 
mind, the others immediately exist along with it, seem to run 
into one another, to coalesce, as it were, and out of many to 
form one idea; which idea, however in reality complex, appears 
to be no less simple, than any one of those of which it is com- 
pounded. 
The word gold, for example, or the word iron, appears to 
express as simple an idea, as the word colour, or the word 
sound. Yet it is immediately seen, that the idea of each of those 
metals is made up of the separate ideas of several sensations; 
colour, hardness, extension, weight. Those ideas, however, 
present themselves in such intimate union, that they are con- 
stantly spoken of as one, not many. We say, our idea of iron, 
our idea of gold; and it is only with an effort that reflecting 
men perform the decomposition. 
The idea expressed by the term weight, appears so perfectly 
simple, that he is a good metaphysician, who can trace its com- 
position. Yet it involves, of course, the idea of resistance, 
which we have shewn above to be compounded, and to involve 
the feeling attendant upon the contraction of muscles; and the 
feeling, or feelings, denominated Will; it involves the idea, not 
of resistance simply, but of resistance in a particular direction; 
the idea of direction, therefore, is included in it, and in that are 
involved the ideas of extension, and of place and motion, some 
of the most complicated phenomena of the human mind. 
The ideas of hardness and extension have been so uniformly 
regarded as simple, that the greatest metaphysicians have set 
them down as the copies of simple sensations of touch. Hartley 
and Darwin, were, I believe, the first who thought of assigning 
to them a different origin. 
We call a thing hard, because it resists compression, or sepa- 
ration of parts; that is, because to compress it, or separate it 
into parts, what we call muscular force is required. The idea, 
then, of muscular action, and of all the feelings which go to it, 
are involved in the idea of hardness. 
The idea of extension is derived from the muscular feelings in 
what we call the motion of parts of our own bodies; as for exam- 
ple, the hands. I move my hand along a line; I have certain
-P-A-G-E-497
  PHENOMENA OF THE HUMAN MIND 475 
sensations; on account of these sensations, I call the line long, 
or extended. Theidea of lines in the direction of length, breadth, 
and thickness, constitutes the general idea of extension. In the 
idea of extension, there are included three of the most complex 
of our ideas; motion; time, which is included in motion; and 
space, which is included in direction. We are not yet prepared 
to explain the simple ideas which compose the very complex 
ideas, of motion, space, and time; it is enough at present to 
have shewn, that in the idea of extension, which appears so very 
simple, a great number of ideas are nevertheless included; and 
that this is a case of that combination of ideas in the higher 
degrees of association, in which the simple ideas are so inti- 
mately blended, as to have the appearance, not of a complex, 
but of a simple idea. 
It is to this great law of association, that we trace the forma- 
tion of our ideas of what we call external objects; that is, the 
ideas of a certain number of sensations, received together so 
frequently that they coalesce as it were, and are spoken of 
under the idea of unity. Hence, what we call the idea of a tree, 
the idea of a stone, the idea of a horse, the idea of a man. 
In using the names, tree, horse, man, the names of what I 
call objects, I am referring, and can be referring, only to my 
own sensations; in fact, therefore, only naming a certain num- 
ber of sensations, regarded as in a particular state of combina- 
tion; that is, concomitance. Particular sensations of sight, of 
touch, of the muscles, are the sensations, to the ideas of which, 
colour, extension, roughness, hardness, smoothness, taste, 
smell, so coalescing as to appear.one idea, I give the name, idea 
of a tree. 
To this case of high association, this blending together of 
many ideas, in so close a combination that they appear not 
many ideas, but one idea, we owe, as I shall afterwards more 
fully explain, the power of classification, and all the advan- 
tages of language. It is obviously, therefore, of the greatest 
moment, that this important phenomenon should be well 
understood. 
9. Some ideas are by frequency and strength of association
-P-A-G-E-498
476 JAMES MILL 
so closely combined, that they cannot be separated. If one 
exists, the others exist along with it, in spite of whatever effort 
we make to disjoin them. 
For example; it is not in our power to think of colour, with- 
out thinking of extension; or of solidity, without figure. We 
have seen colour constantly in combination with extension, 
spread as it were, upon a surface. We have never seen it except 
in this connection. Colour and extension have been invariably 
conjoined. The idea of colour, therefore, uniformly comes into 
the mind, bringing that of extension along with it; and so 
close is the association, that it is not in our power to dissolve 
it. We cannot, if we will, think of colour, but in combination 
with extension. The one idea calls up the other, and retains 
it, so long as the other is retained. 
This great law of our nature is illustrated in a manner 
equally striking, by the connection between the ideas of solidity 
and figure. We never have the sensations from which the idea 
of solidity is derived, but in conjunction with the sensations 
whence the idea of figure is derived. If we handle anything 
solid, it is always either round, square, or of some other form. 
The ideas correspond with the sensations. If the idea of solidity 
rises, that of figure rises along with it. The idea of figure which 
rises, is, of course, more obscure than that of extension; be- 
cause, figures being innumerable, the general idea is exceed- 
ingly complex, and hence, of necessity, obscure. But, such as it 
is, the idea of figure is always present when that of solidity is 
present; nor can we, by any effort, think of the one without 
thinking of the other at the same time. 
Of all the cases of this important law of association, there is 
none more extraordinary than what some philosophers have 
called, the acquired perceptions of sight. 
When I lift my eyes from the paper on which I am writing, 
I see the chairs, and tables, and walls of my room, each of its 
proper shape, and at its proper distance. I see, from my win- 
dow, trees, and meadows, and horses, and oxen, and distant 
hills. I see each of its proper size, of its proper form, and at its 
proper distance; and these particulars appear as immediate
-P-A-G-E-499
  PHENOMENA OF THE HUMAN MIND 477 
informations of the eye, as the colours which I see by means of 
it: 
Yet, philosophy has ascertained, that we derive nothing from 
the eye whatever, but sensations of colour; that the idea of 
extension, in which size, and form, and distance are included, is 
derived from sensations, not in the eye, but in the muscular 
part of our frame. How, then, is it, that we receive accurate 
information, by the eye, of size, and shape, and distance? By 
association merely. 
The colours upon a body are different, according to its figure, 
its distance, and its size. But the sensations of colour, and what 
we may here, for brevity, call the sensations of extension, of 
figure, of distance, have been so often united, felt in conjunc- 
tion, that the sensation of the colour is never experienced with- 
out raising the ideas of the extension, the figure, the distance, 
in such intimate union with it, that they not only cannot be 
separated, but are actually supposed to be seen. The sight, as 
it is called, of figure, or distance, appearing, as it does, a simple 
sensation, is in reality a complex state of consciousness; a 
sequence, in which the antecedent, a sensation of colour, and 
the consequent, a number of ideas, are so closely combined by 
association, that they appear not one idea, but one sensation. 
Some persons, by the folly of those about them, in early life, 
have formed associations between the sound of thunder, and 
danger to their lives. They are accordingly in a state of agita- 
tion during a thunder storm. The sound of the thunder calls up 
the idea of danger, and no effort they can make, no reasoning 
they can use with themselves, to show how small the chance 
that they will be harmed, empowers them to dissolve the spell, 
to break the association, and deliver themselves from the tor- 
menting idea, while the sensation or the expectation of it 
remains. 
Another very familiar illustration may be adduced. Some 
persons have what is called an antipathy to a spider, a toad, or 
a rat. These feelings generally originate in some early fright. 
The idea of danger has been on some occasion so intensely 
excited along with the touch or sight of the animal, and hence
-P-A-G-E-500
  478 JAMES MILL 
the association so strongly formed, that it cannot be dissolved. 
The sensation, in spite of them, excites the idea, and produces 
the uneasiness which the idea imports. 
The following of one idea after another idea, or after a sensa- 
tion, so certainly that we cannot prevent the combination, nor 
avoid having the consequent feeling as often as we have the 
antecedent, is a law of association, the operation of which we 
shall afterwards find to be extensive, and bearing a principal 
part in some of the most important phenomena of the human 
mind. 
As there are some ideas so intimately blended by association, 
that it is not in our power to separate them; there seem to be 
others, which it is not in our power to combine. Dr. Brown, in 
exposing some errors of his predecessors, with respect to the 
acquired perceptions of sight, observes: “I cannot blend my 
notions of the two surfaces, a plane, and a convex, as one sur- 
face, both plane and convex, more than I can think of a whole 
which is less than a fraction of itself, or a square of which the 
sides are not equal.” The case, here, appears to be, that a 
strong association excludes whatever is opposite to it. Icannot 
associate the two ideas of assafcetida, and the taste of sugar. 
Why? Because the idea of assafcetida is so strongly associated 
with the idea of another taste, that the idea of that other 
taste rises in combination with the idea of assafcetida, and of 
course the idea of sugar does not rise. I have one idea associ- 
ated with the word pain. Why can I not associate pleasure 
with the word pain? Because another indissoluble association 
springs up, and excludes it. This is, therefore, only a case of 
indissoluble association; but one of much importance, as we 
shall find when we come to the exposition of some of the more 
complicated of our mental phenomena. 
to. It not unfrequently happens in our associated feelings, 
that the antecedent is of no importance farther than it intro- 
duces the consequent. In these cases, the consequent absorbs 
all the attention, and the antecedent is instantly forgotten. Of 
this a very intelligible illustration is afforded by what happens 
in ordinary discourse. A friend arrives from a distant country,
-P-A-G-E-501
  PHENOMENA OF THE HUMAN MIND 479 
and brings me the first intelligence of the last illness, the last 
words, the last acts, and death of my son. The sound of the 
voice, the articulation of every word, makes its sensation in my 
ear; but it is to the ideas that my attention flies. It is my son 
that is before me, suffering, acting, speaking, dying. The 
words which have introduced the ideas, and kindled the affec- 
tions, have been as little heeded, as the respiration which has 
been accelerated, while the ideas were received. 
It is important in respect to this case of association to 
remark, that there are large classes of our sensations, such as 
many of those in the alimentary duct, and many in the nervous 
and vascular systems, which serve, as antecedents, to introduce 
ideas, as consequents; but as the consequents are far more 
interesting than themselves, and immediately absorb the atten- 
tion, the antecedents are habitually overlooked; and though 
they exercise, by the trains which they introduce, a great influ- 
ence on our happiness or misery, they themselves are generally 
wholly unknown. 
That there are connections between our ideas and certain 
states of the internal organs, is proved by many familiar in- 
stances. Thus, anxiety, in most people, disorders the digestion. 
It is no wonder, then, that the internal feelings which accom- 
pany indigestion, should excite the ideas which prevail in a 
state of anxiety. Fear, in most people, accelerates, in a remark- 
able manner, the vermicular motion of the intestines. There is 
an association, therefore, between certain states of the intes- 
tines, and tertible ideas; and this is sufficiently confirmed by 
the horrible dreams to which men are subject from indigestion; 
and the hypochondria, more or less afflicting, which almost 
always accompanies certain morbid states of the digestive 
organs. The grateful food which excites pleasurable sensations 
in the mouth, continues them in the stomach; and, as pleasures 
excite ideas of their causes, and these of similar causes, and 
causes excite ideas of their effects, and so on, trains of pleas- 
urable ideas take their origin from pleasurable sensations in 
the stomach. Uneasy sensations in the stomach, produce 
analogous effects. Disagreeable sensations are associated with 
 
-P-A-G-E-502
480 JAMES MILL 
disagreeable circumstances; a train is introduced, in which, one 
painful idea following another, combinations, to the last degree 
afflictive, are sometimes introduced, and the sufferer is alto- 
gether overwhelmed by dismal associations. 
In illustration of the fact, that sensations and ideas, which 
are essential to some of the most important operations of our 
minds, serve only as antecedents to more important conse- 
quents, and are themselves so habitually overlooked, that their 
existence is unknown, we may recur to the remarkable case 
which we have just explained, of the ideas introduced by the 
sensations of sight. The minute gradations of colour, which 
accompany varieties of extension, figure, and distance, are 
insignificant. The figure, the size, the distance, themselves, on 
the other hand, are matters of the greatest importance. The 
first having introduced the last, their work is done. The conse- 
quents remain the sole objects of attention, the antecedents are 
forgotten; in the present instance, not completely; in other 
instances, so completely, that they cannot be recognized. 
11. Mr. Hume, and after him other philosophers, have said 
that our ideas are associated according to three principles; 
Contiguity in time and place, Causation, and Resemblance. 
The Contiguity in time and place, must mean, that of the sen- 
sations; and so far it is affirmed, that the order of the ideas fol- 
lows that of the sensations. Contiguity of two sensations in 
time, means the successive order. Contiguity of two sensations 
in place, means the synchronous order. We have explained the 
mode in which ideas are associated, in the synchronous, as well 
as the successive order, and have traced the principle of con- 
tiguity to its proper source. 
Causation, the second of Mr. Hume’s principles, is the same 
with contiguity in time, or the order of succession. Causation 
is only a name for the order established between an antecedent 
and a consequent; that is, the established or constant antece- 
tlence of the one, and consequence of the other. Resemblance 
only remains, as an alleged principle of association, and it is 
necessary to inquire whether it is included in the laws which 
have been above expounded. I believe it will be found that we
-P-A-G-E-503
  PHENOMENA OF THE HUMAN MIND 481 
are accustomed to see like things together. When we see a tree, 
we generally see more trees than one; when we see an ox, we 
generally see more oxen than one; a sheep, more sheep than 
one; a man, more men than one. From this observation, I 
think, we may refer resemblance to the law of frequency, of 
which it seems to form only a particular case. 
Mr. Hume makes contrast a principle of association, but not 
a separate one, as he thinks it is compounded of Resemblance 
and Causation. It is not necessary for us to show that this is an 
unsatisfactory account of contrast. It is only necessary to 
observe, that, as a case of association, it is not distinct from 
those which we have above explained. 
A dwarf suggests the idea of a giant. How? We call a dwarf 
a dwarf, because he departs from a certain standard. We calla 
giant a giant, because he departs from the same standard. This 
is a case, therefore, of resemblance, that is, of frequency. 
Pain is said to make us think of pleasure; and this is con- 
sidered a case of association by contrast. There is no doubt 
that pain makes us think of relief from it; because they have 
been conjoined, and the great vividness of the sensations makes 
the association strong. Relief from pain is a species of pleasure; 
and one pleasure leads to think of another, from the resem- 
blance. This is a compound case, therefore, of vividness and 
frequency. All other cases of contrast, I believe, may be ex- 
pounded in a similar manner. 
I have not thought it necessary to be tedious in expounding 
the observations which I have thus stated; for whether the 
reader supposes that resemblance is, or is not, an original prin- 
ciple of association, will not affect our future investigations. 
12. Not only do simple ideas, by strong association, run 
together, and form complex ideas: but a complex idea, when 
the simple ideas which compose it have become so consolidated 
that it always appears as one, is capable of entering into com- 
binations with other ideas, both simple and complex. Thus two 
complex ideas may be united together, by a strong association, 
and coalesce into one, in the same manner as two or more sim- 
ple ideas coalesce into one. This union of two complex ideas 
 
-P-A-G-E-504
    482 JAMES MILL 
into one, Dr. Hartley has called a duplex idea. Two also of 
these duplex, or doubly compounded ideas, may unite into 
one; and these again into other compounds, without end. It is 
hardly necessary to mention, that as two complex ideas unite to 
form a duplex one, not only two, but more than two may so 
unite; and what he calls a duplex idea may be compounded of 
two, three, four, or any number of complex ideas. 
Some of the most familiar objects with which we are ac- 
quainted furnish instances of these unions of complex and 
duplex ideas. 
Brick is one complex idea, mortar is another complex idea; 
these ideas, with ideas of position and quantity, compose my 
idea of a wall. My idea of a plank is a complex idea, my idea of 
a rafter is a complex idea, my idea of a nail is a complex idea. 
These, united with the same ideas of position and quantity, 
compose my duplex idea of a floor. In the same manner my 
complex idea of glass, and wood, and others, compose my 
duplex idea of a window; and these duplex ideas, united to- 
gether, compose my idea of a house, which is made up of vari- 
ous duplex ideas. How many complex, or duplex ideas, are all 
united in the idea of furniture? How many more in the idea of 
merchandise? Now many more in the idea called Every 
Thing?

(1818-1903) 
THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT* 
THE INTELLECT 
WE now proceed to view the Intellect, or the thinking func- 
tion of the mind. The various faculties known as Memory, 
Judgment, Abstraction, Reason, Imagination, — are modes or 
varieties of Intellect. Although we can hardly ever exert this 
portion of our mental system in separation from the other ele- 
ments of mind — Feeling and Volition, yet scientific method 
requires it to be described apart. 
The primary, or fundamental attributes of Thought, or In- 
telligence, have been already stated to be, Consciousness of 
Difference, Consciousness of Agreement, and Retentiveness. The 
exposition of the Intellect will consist in tracing out the work- 
ings of these several attributes; the previous book containing 
the enumeration of all that we at first have to discriminate, 
identify, and retain. 
(1.) The first and most fundamental property is the Con- 
sciousness of Difference, or DiscrimiInaTIoN. To be distinc- 
tively affected by two or more successive impressions is the 
most general fact of consciousness. Weare never conscious at 
all without experiencing transition or change. (This has been 
called the Law of Relativity.) When the mental outburst is 
characterized mainly by pleasure or pain, we are said to be 
under a state of feeling. When the prominent circumstance is 
discrimination of the two distinct modes of the transition, we 
are occupied intellectually. There are many transitions that 
give little or no feeling in the sense of pleasure or pain, and that 
are attended to as transitions, in other words, as Differences. 
* London, 1855; 4th ed., 1894.  
-P-A-G-E-506
484. ALEXANDER BAIN 
In states of enjoyment or suffering, we cannot be strictly devoid 
of the consciousness of difference; but we abstain from the ex- 
ercise of the discriminating (and the identifying) function, and 
follow out the consequences of a state of feeling as such, these 
being to husband the pleasure and abate the pain, by voluntary 
actions. 
(2.) The fundamental property of Intellect, named RETEN- 
TIVENESS, has two aspects, or degrees. 
First. The persistence or continuance of mental impressions, 
after the withdrawal of the external agent. When the ear is 
struck by a sonorous wave, we have a sensation of sound, but 
the mental excitement does not die away because the sound 
ceases; there is a certain continuing effect, generally much 
feebler, but varying greatly according to circumstances, and on 
some occasions quite equal to the effect of the actual sensation. 
In consequence of this property, our mental excitement, due 
to external causes, may greatly outlast the causes themselves; 
we are enabled to go on living a life in ideas, in addition to the 
life in actualities. 
But this is not all. We have, secondly, the power of recover- 
ing, or reviving, under the form of ideas, past or extinct sensa- 
tions and feeling of all kinds, without the originals, and by 
mental agencies alone. 
After the impression of a sound has ceased entirely, and the 
mind has been occupied with other things, there is a possibility 
of recovering from temporary oblivion the idea, or mental 
effect, without reproducing the actual sound. We remember, 
or bring back to mind, sights, and sounds, and thoughts, that 
have not been experienced for months or years. This implies a 
still higher mode of retentiveness than the previous fact; it 
supposes that something has been engrained in the mental 
structure; that an effect has been produced of a kind that suc- 
ceeding impressions have not been able to blot out. Now, one 
medium of the restoration to consciousness of a particular past 
state, is the actual presence of some impression that had often
-P-A-G-E-507
  THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT 485 
occurred in company with that state. Thus we are reminded of 
a name — as ship, star, tree — by seeing the thing; the previous 
concurrence of name and thing has led to a mental companion- 
ship between the two. Impressions that have frequently ac- 
companied one another in the mind grow together, so as to 
become at last almost inseparable: we cannot have one without 
a disposition or prompting to renew all the rest. This is the 
highest form of the Retentive, or plastic, property of the mind. 
It will be exemplified at length under the title of Association by 
Contiguity. 
(3.) The remaining property of Intellect is consciousness of 
AGREEMENT. Besides the consciousness of difference, the mind 
is also affected by agreement rising out of partial difference. 
The continuance of the same impression produces no effect, 
but after experiencing a certain impression and passing away 
from it to something else, the recurrence of the first causes a 
certain shock or start, — the shock of recognition; which is 
all the greater according as the circumstances of the present 
and of the past occurrence are different. Change produces one 
effect, the effect called discrimination; Similarity in the midst 
of change produces a new and distinct effect; and these are the 
two modes of intellectual stimulation, the two constituents of 
knowledge. When we see in the child the features of the man, 
we are struck by agreement in the midst of difference. 
This power of recognition, identification, or discovery of 
likeness in unlikeness, is another means of bringing to mind 
past ideas; and is spoken of as the Associating, or Reproductive 
principle of Srumtarity. We are as often reminded of things by 
their resemblance to something present, as by their previous 
proximity to what isnowin the view. Contiguity and Similarity 
express two great principles or forces of mental reproduction; 
they are distinct powers of the mind, varying in degree among 
individuals — the one sometimes preponderating, and some- 
times the other. The first governs Acquisition, the second 
Invention. 
The commonly recognized intellectual faculties, enumerated 
by Psychologists with much discrepancy, in so far as they do
-P-A-G-E-508
486 ALEXANDER BAIN 
not involve Feeling and Volition, are resolvable into these 
three primitive properties of Intellect — Discrimination, Re- 
tention, Similarity. The faculty called Memory is almost 
exclusively founded in the Retentive power, although some- 
times aided by Similarity. The processes of Reason and 
Abstraction involve Similarity chiefly; there being in both the 
identification of resembling things. What is termed Judgment 
may consist in Discrimination on the one hand, or in the Sense 
of Agreement on the other: we determine two or more things 
either to differ or to agree. It is impossible to find any case of 
Judging that does not, in the last resort, mean one or other of 
these two essential activities of the intellect. Lastly, Imagina- 
tion is a product of all the three fundamentals of our intelli- 
gence, with the addition of an element of Emotion. 
CHAPTER I. RETENTIVENESS — LAW OF 
CONTIGUITY 
1. Tuts principle is the basis of Memory, Habit, and the 
Acquired Powers in general. Writers on Mental Science have 
described it under various names. Sir William Hamilton terms 
it the law of ‘“‘Redintegration,” regarding it as the principle 
whereby one part of a whole brings up the other parts, as when 
the first words of a quotation recall the remainder, or one house 
in a street suggests the succeeding ones. The associating links 
called Order in Time, Order in Place, and Cause and Effect, 
are all included under it. We might also name it the law of 
Association proper, of Adhesion, Mental Adhesiveness, or Ac- 
quisition. 
The following is a general statement of this mode of mental 
reproduction. 
Actions, Sensations, and States of Feeling, occurring to- 
gether or in close succession, tend to grow together, or 
cohere, in such a way that, when any one of them is after- 
wards presented to the mind, the others are apt to be 
brought up in idea.
-P-A-G-E-509
  THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT 487 
There are various circumstances or conditions that regulate 
and modify the operation of this principle, so as to render the 
adhesive growth more or less rapid and secure. These will be 
best brought out by degrees in the course of the exposition. As 
a general rule, Repetition is necessary in order to render co- 
herent in the mind a train or aggregate of images, as, for exam- 
ple, the successive aspects of a panorama, with a sufficient 
degree of force to make one suggest the others at an after period. 
The precise degree of repetition needed depends on a variety of 
causes, the quality of the individual mind being one. 
4. In regard to the conditions that regulate the pace of our 
various acquisitions, some are general, others are special to 
individual kinds. 
The general conditions are these: — 
I. A certain amount of Continuance, or Repetition of the 
matter to be learned, is requisite: and the greater the continu- 
ance, or the more frequent the repetition, the greater the pro- 
gress of the learner. Deficiency in the other conditions has to 
be made up by a protracted iteration. 
II. The Concentration of the mind is an important condi- 
tion. This means physically that the forces of the nevous sys- 
tem are strongly engaged upon the particular act, which is pos- 
sible only by keeping the attention from wandering to other 
things. It is well known that distraction of mind is a bar to 
acquirement. 
There are various modes of attaining the desired concentra- 
tion. It isa voluntary act, prompted by present and by future 
pleasures and pains. 
The greatest of all motives to concentration is a present 
enjoyment of the work in hand. Any exercise possessing a 
special charm detains us by immediate attraction; everything 
else is neglected so long as the fascination lasts. This is the 
inherent power of the will in its immediate and most efficient 
manifestation — a present pleasure furthering a present action. 
It explains the great influence of what is called the Taste for a 
special pursuit. The taste or fascination for music, for science, 
for business, — keeps the mind of the learner exclusively bent
-P-A-G-E-510
  488 ALEXANDER BAIN 
upon the subject; and the pace of acquisition is proportionally 
rapid. 
Next to present enjoyment, is associated, or future, enjoy- 
ment; as when we devote ourselves to something uninteresting 
or painful in itself, but calculated to bring future gratification. 
This is, generally speaking, a less urgent stimulation, as being 
the influence of pleasure existing only in idea. There may, 
however, be all degrees of intensity of the motive, according to 
the strength of the ideal representation of the pleasure to come. 
It is on this stimulation, that we go through the dry studies 
necessary to a lucrative profession or a favourite object of 
pursuit. The young are insufficiently actuated by prospective 
pleasure, owing to their inferior ideal hold of it; and are there- 
fore not powerfully moved in this way. 
A third form of concentration is when present pain is made 
use of to deter and withdraw the mind from causes of distrac- 
tion, or matters having an intrinsically superior charm. This 
is the final resort in securing the attention of the volatile 
learner. It is an inferior motive, on the score of economy, but 
cannot be dispensed with in early training. By an artificial 
appliance, the subject is made comparatively the most attractive. 
So with the use of future pains; the same allowance being made 
for the difference in their character, as for pleasures existing 
only in prospect. 
Mere Excitement, whether as pleasure or as pain, or as 
neither, is a power of intellectual concentration. An idea that 
excites us very much persists in the mind, even if painful; and 
the remembrance of it will be stamped in consequence. This 
influence will be especially noticed, a few pages hence. 
It is not uncommon, in stating the general conditions of Reten- 
tiveness, or memory, to specify the vividness or intensity of an 
impression; thus, we readily remember such effects as an intense 
odour, a speech uttered with vehemence, a conflagration. This, 
however, resolves itself into the concentration of mental and nerv- 
ous force, due to the emotional excitement. Apart from the feel- 
ings, an idea may be more or less distinct and clear, but is not 
properly more or less intense. If an inscription is legible with ease,
-P-A-G-E-511
  THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT 489 
it is everything that the intellect demands; the adventitious aid of 
glaring characters, as when, at a public illumination, a sentiment is 
written in gas jets, is a species of excitement, securing an inordinate 
amount of attention or concentration of mind. 
If we compare an object sharply defined with another whose 
lineaments are faded and obscure, there is a wide difference in the 
hold that the two would severally take on the memory; but such 
impressions differ in kind, and not simply in degree. The names 
‘vivid’ and ‘intense’ are scarcely applicable except by a figure. 
Without a decisive difference or contrast, the mind is not impressed 
at all; everything that favours the contrast favours discrimination, 
and also depth of impression. All this, however, is pre-supposed, 
as a fact or property of the Discriminating function of intellect; 
and is not to be repeated as appertaining to the Refentive function. 
III. There appears to be specific to each individual a certain 
degree of General Retentiveness, or a certain aptitude for 
acquirement generally. We find a great inequality in the 
progress of learners placed almost exactly in the same circum- 
stances. Sometimes the difference refers only to single depart- 
ments, as mechanical art, music, or language; it is then refer- 
able to special and local endowments, as muscular sensibility, 
the musical ear, and so forth. Often, however, the superiority 
of individuals is seen in acquirement as a whole, in which form 
it is better regarded as a General power of Retentiveness. 
5. We shall advert, as we proceed, to the modifying circum- 
stances of a local kind peculiar to each class of acquisitions. 
As respects the present class, Movements, the special condi- 
tions seem to be as follows: — 
(1.) Bodily Strength, or mere muscular vigour, must be 
regarded as favouring acquisition. Not only is it an indication 
of a large share of vitality in the muscles, which is likely to 
attend their acquired aptitudes; it also qualifies for enduring, 
without fatigue, a great amount of continuance or practice of 
the operations required. 
(2.) Distinct from mere muscular power is Spontaneity, or 
the active temperament; meaning the natural proneness to 
copious muscular activity. This must be regarded as a pro-
-P-A-G-E-512
  490 ALEXANDER BAIN 
perty, not of the muscular tissue, but of the nerve-centres on 
the active side of the brain. Hence there is a likelihood, if not a 
certainty, that the endowment is accompanied with a greater 
facility in the association of movements. Observation accords 
with the view. It is usually men of abounding natural activity 
that make adroit mechanics, good sportsmen, and able com- 
batants. 
(3.) Of still greater importance is Muscular Delicacy, or 
Discrimination, which is not necessarily involved in either of 
the foregoing heads, although more allied to the second. The 
power of discriminating nice shades of muscular movement is 
at the foundation of muscular expertness in every mode. We 
have abundant proof that, wherever delicacy of discrimination 
exists, there exists also a special retentiveness of that class of 
impressions. The physical groundwork of the property is the 
abundance of the nerve elements — fibres and corpuscles — out 
of which also must spring the capacity for varied groupings and 
fixed associations. 
Physical vigour in general, and those modes of it that are the 
counterparts of mental vigour in particular, must be reckoned 
among the conditions of Retentiveness. Other things being the 
same, acquisition is most rapid in health, and in the nourished and 
fresh condition of all the organs. When the forces of the system run 
strongly to the nervous system in general, there is a natural exuber- 
ance of all the mental manifestations; and energy of mind is then 
compatible with much bodily feebleness, yet not with any circum- 
stances that restrict the nourishment of the brain. 
CHAPTER IIT. AGREEMENT — LAW OF SIMILARITY 
Present Actions, Sensations, Thoughts, or Emotions 
tend to revive their LiKE among previous Impres- 
sions, or States. 
1. Conticurty joins together things that occur together, or 
that are, by any circumstance, presented to the mind at the 
same time; as when we associate heat with light, a falling body
-P-A-G-E-513
    THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT 491 
with a concussion. But, in addition to this link of reproductive 
connexion, we find that one thing will, by virtue of Similarity, 
recall another separated from it in time,as when a portrait recalls 
the original. 
The second fundamental property of Intellect, termed Con- 
sciousness of Agreement, or Similarity, is a great power of 
mental reproduction, or a means of recovering past mental 
states. It was noticed by Aristotle as one of the links in the 
succession of our thoughts. 
As regards our knowledge, or perception, of things, the conscious- 
ness of Agreement is second only to Discrimination, or the con- 
sciousness of Difference. When we know a thing, we do so by its 
differences and its agreements. Our full knowledge of red, is our 
having contrasted it with all other colours, and our having compared 
it with itself and with its various shades. Our knowledge of a chair 
is made up of our experiences of the distinction between it and other 
articles of furniture, &c.,and of theagreement between it and other 
chairs. Both modes are involved in a complete act of cognition, and 
nothing else (except, of course, the Retentiveness implied in the one 
and the other) is necessary. Our knowledge of man is the sum of the 
points of contrast between a man and all other things, and the sum 
of the points of identity on comparing men with one another. Our 
increase in knowledge is constantly proceeding in both directions: 
we note new differences, and also new agreements, among our 
experiences, object and subject. We do not begin to be conscious 
till we have the shock of difference; and we cannot make that 
analysis of our conscious states, called the recognition of plurality, 
combination, or complication, till we discover agreements, and refer 
each part of the impression to its like among our previous impres- 
sions. To perceive is, properly, to recognize, or identify. 
2. Some preliminary explanation of the kind of relationship 
subsisting between the two principles of Contiguity and Simi- 
larity, is requisite in order to guard against mistakes, and 
especially to prevent misapprehension, as to the separate exist- 
ence of the two modes of action in the mental framework. 
When the cohesive link between any two contiguous actions, 
or images, is confirmed by a new occurrence or repetition,
-P-A-G-E-514
  492 ALEXANDER BAIN 
obviously the present impression must revive the sum total of 
the past impressions, or reinstate the whole mental condition 
left on the occasion immediately preceding. Thus, if I am dis- 
ciplining myself in the act of drawing a round figure with my 
hand any one present effort must recall the state of the mus- 
cular and nervous action, or the precise bent acquired at the end 
of the previous effort, while that effort had to reinstate the con- 
dition at the end of the one preceding, and so on. It is only in 
this way that repetition can be of any avail in confirming a 
physical habit, or in forming an intellectual aggregate. But 
this reinstatement of a former condition by a present act of the 
same kind, is really and truly a case of the operation of the 
associating principle of similarity, or of like recalling like; and 
we here plainly see, that without such recall, the adhesion of 
contiguous things would be impossible. Hence it would appear, 
that all through the exposition of Contiguity, the principle of 
Similarity has been tacitly assumed; we have everywhere taken 
for granted, that a present occurrence of any object to the view 
recalls the total impression made by all the previous occur- 
rences, and adds its own effect to that total. 
But, by thus tacitly assuming the power of anything present 
to reinstate the past impressions of the same thing, we restrict 
ourselves to those cases where the reinstatement is sure and 
certain, in fact to cases of absolute identity of the present and 
past. Such is the nature of the instances dwelt upon in the pre- 
vious chapter: in all of them, the,new movement, or the new 
image, was supposed precisely identical with the old, and went 
simply to reinstate and to deepen an impression already made. 
We must, however, now pass beyond this field of examples, and 
enter upon a new class where the identity is only partial, and is 
on that account liable to be missed; where the restoration, 
instead of being sure, is doubtful; and where, moreover, the 
reinstatement serves higher purposes than the mere iteration 
and deepening of the impression already made. In all mental 
restorations whatsoever, both Contiguity and Similarity are at 
work; in one class, the question is as to the sufficiency of the 
contiguous bond, the similarity being sure; in another class, the
-P-A-G-E-515
  THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT 493 
question is as to the sufficiency of the attractive force of the 
likeness, the contiguous adhesiveness being believed certain. 
If I chance to meet with a person I have formerly seen, and 
endeavour to remember his name, it will depend upon the 
goodness of a cohesive link whether or not I succeed; there will 
be no difficulty in my recalling the past impression of his per- 
sonal appearance through the force of the present impression; 
but having recalled the full total of the past impressions, I may 
not be able to recover the accompaniment of the name; the con- 
tiguity may be at fault, although the similarity works its per- 
fect work of restoring to me my previous conception of the per- 
sonal aspect. If, on the other hand, I see a man on the street, 
and if I have formerly seen a portrait of that man, it is a ques- 
tion whether the living reality shall recall the portrait; the 
doubt hangs not upon the contiguity, or coherence of the parts 
and surroundings of the picture, if it could be recovered, but 
upon the chance of its being recovered. Where things are 
identical, the operation of similarity, in making the present 
case revive the former ones, is so certain that it is not even 
mentioned; we talk of the goodness of the cohesive bond be- 
tween the revived part and its accompaniments, as if contigu- 
ity expressed the whole fact of the restoration. To make up for 
this partiality of view, which was indispensable to a clear expo- 
sition, we now embrace, with the like partial and prominent 
consideration, the element that was left in a latent condition; 
and allow to sink, into the latent state, the one that has 
hitherto been made exclusively prominent. 
3. In the perfect identity between a present and a past 
impression, the past is recovered and fused with the present, 
instantaneously and surely. So quick and unfaltering is the 
process that we lose sight of it altogether; we are scarcely made 
aware of the existence of an associating link of similarity in the 
chain of sequence. When I look at the full moon, I am in- 
stantly impressed with the state arising from all my former 
impressions of her disc added together; so natural and neces- 
sary does this restoration seem, that we rarely reflect on the 
principle implied in it, namely, the power of the new stimulus 
 
-P-A-G-E-516
  494 ALEXANDER BAIN 
to set on the nervous currents, with all the energy acquired in 
the course of many hundred repetitions of the same visual im- 
petus. But when we pass from perfect to imperfect or partial 
identity, we are more readily made aware of the existence of 
this link of attraction between similars, for we find that some- 
times the restoration does not take place; cases occur where we 
fail to be struck with a similitude; the spark does not pass be- 
tween the new currents and the old dormant ones. The failure 
in reinstating the old condition by virtue of the present stimu- 
lus, is, in the main, ascribable to imperfect identity. When, in 
some new impression of a thing, the original form is muffled, ob- 
scured, distorted, disguised, or in any way altered, it is a chance 
whether or not we identify it; the amount of likeness that 
remains will have a reviving power, or a certain amount of rein- 
stating energy, but the points of difference or unlikeness will 
operate to resist the supervention of the old state, and will tend 
to revive objects like themselves. If I hear a musical air that I 
have been accustomed to, the new impression revives the old as 
a matter of course; but if the air is played with complex har- 
monies and accompaniments, it is possible that the effect of 
these additions may be to check my recognition of the piece; 
the unlike circumstances may repel the reinstatement of the 
old experience more powerfully than the remaining likeness 
attracts it; and I may find in it no identity whatever with an 
air previously known, or even identify it with something alto- 
gether different. If my hold of the essential character of the 
melody is but feeble, and if Iam stunned and confounded with 
the new accompaniments, there is every likelihood that I shall 
not experience the restoration of my past hearing of the air 
intended, and consequently I shall not identify the perform- 
ance. 
4. The obstructives to the revival of the past through simili- 
tude, may be classed under the two heads — Faintness and 
Diversity. There are instances where a new impression is too 
feeble to strike into the old-established track of the same impres- 
sion, and to make it alive again; as when we are unable to iden- 
tify the taste of a very weak solution, or to discern an object in   
       
-P-A-G-E-517
  THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT 495 
twilight dimness. The most numerous and interesting cases 
come, however, under the other head — Diversity, or mingled 
likeness and unlikeness; as when we meet an old acquaintance 
in a new dress, or in circumstances where we have never seen 
the same person before. The modes of diversity are countless, 
and incapable of being classified. We might, indeed, include 
under diversity the other of the two heads, seeing that faintness 
implies diversity of degree, if not of any other circumstance; but 
I prefer considering the obstruction arising from faintness by 
itself, after which we shall proceed to the larger field of exam- 
ples marked by unlikeness in other respects. 
5. The difficulty or facility in resuming a past mental condi- 
tion, at the suggestion of a present similitude, will plainly de- 
pend upon the old that the past impression has acquired; it is 
much easier to revive a familiar image than an unfamiliar, by 
the force of a new presentation. We shall, therefore, have to 
keep this circumstance in view, among others, in the course of 
our illustration of the law of Similarity. 
It has to be considered how far natural character — that is, 
a primitive endowment of the intellect, enters into the power 
of reviving similars, or of bringing together like things in spite 
of the repulsion of unlike accompaniments. There is much to 
be explained in the preferences shown by different minds, in the 
objects that they most readily recall to the present view; which 
preferences determine varieties of character, such as the scien- 
tific and the artistic minds. The explanation of these differ- 
ences was carried up to a certain point under the Law of Con- 
tiguity; but, if I am not mistaken, there is still a portion 
referable to the existence of various modes and degrees of sus- 
ceptibility to the force of Similarity. From all that I have been 
able to observe, the two energies of contiguous adhesion, and of 
attraction of similars, do not rise and fall together in the char- 
acter; we may have one feeble and the other strong, in all pro- 
portions and degrees of adjustment. I believe, moreover, that 
there is such a thing as an energetic power of recognizing simz- 
larity in general, and that this is productive of remarkable con- 
sequences. Whether I shall be able to impress these convictions
-P-A-G-E-518
  496 ALEXANDER BAIN 
upon my readers, will depend upon the success of the detailed 
exposition of this noted peculiarity of our intellectual nature. 
CHAPTER III. COMPOUND ASSOCIATION 
1. HirHERTO we have restricted our attention to single 
threads or indivisible links of association, whether of Contig- 
uity or Similarity. It remains for us to consider the case where 
several threads, or a Plurality of links or bonds of connexion, 
unite in reviving some previous thought or mental state. No 
new principle is introduced here; we have merely to note, what 
seems an almost unavoidable effect of the combined action, that 
the reinstatement is thereby made more easy and certain. As- 
sociations that are individually too weak, to operate the revival 
of a past idea, may succeed by acting together; and there is 
thus opened up to our view a means of aiding our recollection, 
or invention, when the one thread in hand is too feeble to effect 
a desired recall. It happens in fact, that, in a very large num- 
ber of our mental transitions, there is present a multiple bond 
of association. 
The combinations may be made up of Contiguities alone, 
of Similarities alone, or of Contiguity and Similarity mixed. 
Moreover, we shall find that in Emotion and in Volition there 
are influences either assisting or obstructing the proper intel- 
lectual forces. In the reviving of a past image or idea, it is 
never unimportant, that the revival gratifies a favourite emo- 
tion, or is strongly willed in the pursuit of an end. We must 
endeavour to appreciate, as far as we are able, the influence of 
these extra-intellectual energies within the sphere of intellect; 
but, as they would rarely suffice for the reproduction of thought, 
if acting apart and alone, we are led to look at them chiefly as 
modifying the effects of the strictly intellectual forces, or as 
combining elements in the composition of associations. 
The general law may be stated as follows: — 
Past actions, sensations, thoughts, or emotions, are re- 
called more easily, when associated either through con- 
tiguity or through similarity, with more than one present 
object or impression.
-P-A-G-E-519
  THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT 497 
CoMPOSITION OF CONTIGUITIES 
2. We begin with the composition of contiguities. Instances 
might be cited under all the heads of the first chapter; but a 
less profuse selection will suffice. There will, however, be a 
gain in clearness by taking Conjunctions and Successions 
separately. 
Conjunctions. — For a simple example of a compound con- 
junction, we may suppose a person smelling a liquid and iden- 
tifying the smell as something felt before, but unable to recall 
to mind the material causing it. Here the bond between an 
odour and the odorous substance is too feeble for reproducing 
the idea or the name of the substance. Suppose farther that 
the person could taste the liquid without feeling the odour, and 
that in the taste he could recognize a former taste, but could 
not remember the thing. If, in these circumstances, the con- 
currence of the two present sensations of taste and smell 
brought the substance to the recollection, we should have a 
true instance of composite association. If one of the two links 
is fully equal to the restoring effect, there is no case under the 
present law; in order to constitute a proper example, each 
should be insufficient when acting singly. Although there can 
be no doubt as to the fact of such revivals, we might easily sup- 
pose it otherwise. Combination is not strength under all cir- 
cumstances. A gallon of water at 40°, cannot yield a spoonful 
at 41°. Ten thousand commonplace intellects would not 
make one genius, under any system of co-operation. The mul- 
tiplication of unaided eyes could never equal the vision of one 
person with a telescope, or a microscope. 
We have seen that the complex wholes around us in the world, 
are held together in the recollection by the adhesive force of 
Contiguity; such objects as a tree, a human figure, a scene in 
nature, cannot continue in the mind, or be revived as ideas, 
until frequent repetition has made all the parts coherent. After 
the requisite iteration, a complex object, such as a rural village, 
may be revived by the presence of a single portion of it, as some 
street, or building, or marked locality. But, if the village is one 
%
-P-A-G-E-520
  498 ALEXANDER BAIN 
not very well known, that is, if the notion of it is not very firmly 
aggregated in the mind, the traveller just entering may be not 
ready to identify it by the first thing that strikes him; he may 
require to go on till several other objects come in view, when 
probably their joint impression will be able to bring up the 
whole, in other words, will remind him what village he is now 
entering. 
So in regarding objects as concretes, or combinations of many 
distinct qualities, — an orange, for example, which affects all 
the senses, — a fixing process makes the different sensations 
hold together in one complex idea. Here, too, there is room for 
the joint action of associating links in recalling an image to the 
mind. I have already imagined a case of this description, where 
the united action of smell and of taste was supposed to revive 
the idea of the concrete object causing them, either being of 
itself insufficient for the purpose. 
5. Successions. — I have dwelt at length, in a previous chap- 
ter, on the contiguous association of successions of various 
kinds. Here, too, in the circumstance of imperfect adhesion, 
the recovery may be due to a composite action. I have wit- 
nessed a series of events, and these are, in consequence, associ- 
ated in my mind. In endeavouring to recall the series from the 
commencement, a link fails, until some other association, such 
as place, or person, contributes an assisting thread. 
There is one succession that contains the whole of our experi- 
ence, that is, the Order of Time, or the sequence of events in 
each one’s own history. If all the minutize of this succession 
were to cohere perfectly in the mind, everything that we have 
ever done, seen, or been cognizant of, could be recovered by 
means of it. But although all the larger transactions, and the 
more impressive scenes, of our personal history, are linked in 
this order with a sufficient firmness, yet for smaller incidents 
the bond is too weak. I cannot remember fully my yesterday’s 
train of thoughts; nor repeat verbatim an address of five 
minutes’ length, whether spoken or heard. Things related in 
the order of time are, strictly speaking, experienced only once, 
and we usually require repetition to fix any mental train. It
-P-A-G-E-521
  THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT 499 
constantly happens, therefore, that we are in search of some 
reinforcing connexion to help us in recovering the stream of 
events, as they occurred in the order of time. We seek for other 
conjunctions and successions to enable us to recommence after 
every break. 
Experience teaches us, that the only way of making up a 
defective adhesion is to compass in our minds some other con- 
nexion, or to get at the missing object through a new door. The 
inability to recollect the next occurring particular of a train 
that we are in want of, stimulates a great effort of volition, and 
the true course for the mind to take is to get upon some chain 
or current that is likely to cross the line of the first near the 
break. 
At every moment of life, each person stands immersed in a 
complicated scene, and each object of this scene may become 
a starting point for a train of recollections. All the internal 
feelings of the body; everything that surrounds us and strikes 
the eye, ear, touch, taste, or smell; all the ideas, emotions, and 
purposes occupying the mind; — these form so many begin- 
nings of trains of association passing far away into the remot- 
est regions of recollection and thought; and we have it in our 
power to stop and change the direction as often as we please. 
From some one of these present things, we must commence our 
outgoings towards the absent and the distant, whether treading 
in single routes, or introducing composite action. 
6. Language. — The recall of names by things, and of things 
by names, gives special occasion for bringing in additional links 
to aid a feeble tie. When we have forgotten the name of a per- 
son, or of an object, we are under the necessity of referring back 
to the situation and circumstances where we have heard the 
name, to see if any other bond of connexion will spring up. 
Often we are unable, at the moment, to recover the lost sound 
by any means; but, afterwards, an auxiliary circumstance 
crosses the view, and the revival is effected. 
Many of our recollections, thoughts, conceptions, and imag- 
inings, are an inextricable mixture of language and ideas of 
things. The notions that we acquire through oral instruction,
-P-A-G-E-522
  
500 ALEXANDER BAIN 
or from books, are made up in part by the subject matter 
purely, and in part by the phraseology that conveyed it. Thus, 
my recollection of a portion of history is made up of the train of 
words, with the train of historical facts and scenes, as I might 
have seen them with my own eyes. So in many sciences, there 
is a combination of visual or tactual notions with language. 
Geometry is a compound of visible diagrams with the language 
of definitions, axioms, and demonstrations. Now, in all these 
cases, recollection may depend, either on the associations of 
words, or on those of visual and other conceptions, or on a com- 
pound of both. If I listen to a geographical description, there 
is, in the first place, a train of words dropping on my ear; and, 
by virtue of a perfect verbal cohesion, I might recall the whole 
description and recite it to another party. In the second place, 
there is a series of views of objects — of mountain, river, plain, 
and forest — which I picture in my mind. and retain inde- 
pendently of the language used to suggest them. Were my pic- 
torial adhesion strong enough, I could recall the whole of the 
features in the order that I was made to conceive them, and 
leave aside the language. The common case, however, is that 
the recollection is effected by a union of both the threads of 
cohesion; the pictorial train is assisted by the verbal, and the 
verbal by the pictorial, as may happen. 
COMPOSITION OF SIMILARITIES 
4. The influence of the multiplication of points of likeness, 
in securing the revival of a past object, is liable to no uncer- 
tainty. It is only an extension of the principle maintained all 
through the discussion of the law of similarity, that the greater 
the similitude, and the more numerous the points of resem- 
blance, the surer is the stroke of recall. If I meet a person very 
like some one else I have formerly known, the probability of 
my recalling this last person to view is increased, if the likeness 
in face and feature is combined with similarity of dress, of 
speech, of gait, or of any still more extraneous points, such as 
occupation, or history. Increase of resemblance extensively,
-P-A-G-E-523
  
THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT 501 
that is by outward connexions, has the same power as increase 
of resemblance intensively, in rendering the restoration of the 
past more certain. It might admit of a doubt whether four faint 
links of contiguous adhesion would be equal to one strong link, 
but it would be against our whole experience of the workings 
of similarity, to doubt the utility of multiplying faint resem- 
blances, when there was no one sufficiently powerful to effect 
the revival. At the same time, we must admit that much more 
is contributed to the chances of reinstatement by intensifying 
one point of likeness, than by adding new ones of a faint char- 
acter. By raising some single feature almost up to the point of 
identity, we should do more good than could be done by scat- 
tering faint and detached likenesses over the picture. This, 
however, is not always in our power; and we are glad to find, 
that, when the similarity, in any one particular, is too feeble 
to suggest the resembling past, the existence of a plurality of 
weak resemblances will be the equivalent of a single stronger 
one. 
On this view, I might set forth the workings of composite 
similarities, from the various classes of examples gone over in 
the preceding chapter. In all very complicated conjunctions, 
as, for example, a landscape, there may be a multiplication of 
likenesses, unable to strike singly, but, by their concurrence 
suggesting a parallel scene. Hence, in endeavouring to recall 
resembling things, we may proceed, as in Contiguity, by hunt- 
ing out new collaterals, on the chance of increasing the amount 
of similitude. and, with that, the attractive power of the pres- 
ent for the absent. If I am endeavouring to recall to mind 
some historic parallel to a present political situation, suppos- 
ing one to exist and to have been at some former time impressed 
on my mind, there may be a want of any single salient like- 
ness, such as we admit to be the most effective medium of 
reinstatement; and I must, therefore, go over in my mind all 
the minute features of the present, to enhance, in this way, 
the force of the attraction of similitude for the forgotten 
parallel. 
8. The case noticed at the conclusion of the preceding head,
-P-A-G-E-524
  502 ALEXANDER BAIN 
namely, the combination of language with subject-matter in a 
mixed recollection, is favourable to the occurrence of com- 
pound similarity. If an orator has to deal with a special point, 
the conduct of an individual, for example, which he wishes to 
denounce by a cutting simile, his invention may be aided by 
some similarity in the phrases descriptive of the case, as well as 
in the features of the case itself. If one who has at a former time 
read the play of G:dipus, now commences to read Lear, the 
similarity is not at first apparent, but long before the conclu- 
sion there will be a sufficient accumulation of features of simili- 
tude, in dramatic situation and in language, to bring G:dipus to 
mind without any very powerful stretch of intellectual force. 
So, in scientific invention; a fact described in language has a 
double power of suggestion; and if, by good luck, the fact has a 
likeness to some other fact, and the description resembles the 
language that accompanied that other when formerly present 
to the mind, there is so much the more chance of the revival 
taking place. 
MrIxeD CONTIGUITY AND SIMILARITY 
9. Under this head, there are several interesting examples. 
If any one, in describing a storm, employ the phrase ‘a war 
of elements,’ the metaphor has been brought to mind partly by 
similitude, but partly also by contiguity, seeing that the com- 
parison has already been made. The person that first used the 
phrase came upon it by similarity; he that used it next had con- 
tiguity to assist him; and, after frequent repetition, the bond 
of contiguity may be so well confirmed, that the force of 
similarity is entirely superseded. In this way, many things 
that were originally strokes of genius, end in being efforts of 
mere adhesive recollection; while, for a time previous to this 
final consummation, there is a mixed effort of the two suggest- 
ing forces. Hence Johnson’s remark on the poet Ogilvie, that 
his poem contained what was once imagination, but in him had 
come to be memory. 
In all regions of intellectual exertion — industry, science,
-P-A-G-E-525
  THE SENSES AND THE INTELLECT 503 
art, literature — there is a kind of ability displayed in taking 
up great and original ideas and combinations, before they have 
been made easy by iteration. Minds unable for the highest 
efforts of origination may yet be equal to this second degree of 
genius, wherein a considerable force of similarity is assisted by 
a small thread of contiguity. To master a large multitude of 
the discoveries of identification, a power of similarity short of 
the original force that gave birth to them, is aided by the con- 
tiguous bond that has grown up, during a certain number of 
repetitions of each. 
to. A second case is, when a similarity is struck out in cir- 
cumstances such as to bring the absent object into near proxim- 
ity in some contiguous train. Thus, a poet falls upon a beautiful 
metaphor, while dwelling in the region where the material of the 
simile occurs. In the country, rural comparisons are most 
easily made; on ship-board, nautical metaphors are naturally 
abundant. 
If we chance to be studying by turns two different sciences 
that throw much light on each other, we are in the best position 
for deriving the benefit of the comparison. When we know the 
most likely source of fertile similitudes for some difficult prob- 
lem, we naturally keep near that source, in order that we may 
be struck with the faintest gleam of likeness, through the help 
of proximity. A historian of the ancient republics cultivates a 
familiarity with all the living instances of the republican sys- 
tem. Now that physical science is largely indebted to mathe. 
matical handling, the physicist has to maintain his freshness in 
mathematics. It is not safe to trust to an acquisition of old 
date, however pertinacious the mind be in retaining the subject 
in question. The great discoveries of identification that aston- 
ish the world and open up new vistas of knowledge, have doubt- 
less often been helped by the accidental proximity of the things 
made to flash together. For illustration’s sake, we might sup- 
pose Newton in the act of meditating upon the planetary at- 
traction, at the time that the celebrated apple fell to the ground 
before his eyes; a proximity so very close would powerfully aid 
in bringing on the stroke of identification.

CHAPTER IV. CONSTRUCTIVE ASSOCIATION 
By means of Association, the mind has the power to form 
new combinations, or aggregates, different from any that 
have been presented to it in the course of experience. 
1. THRouGHOUT the whole of the preceding exposition, we 
have had in view the literal resuscitation, revival, or reinstate- 
ment of former actions, images, emotions, and trains of thought. 
No special reference has been made to the operations known by 
such names as Imagination, Creation, Constructiveness, Orig- 
ination; through which we are supposed to put together new 
forms, or to construct images, conceptions, pictures, and 
modes of working, such as we have never before had any expe- 
rience of. Yet the genius of the Painter, the Poet, the Musi- 
cian, and the Inventor in the arts and sciences, evidently im- 
plies a process of this nature. 
Under the head of Similarity, we have had to recognize a 
power tending to originality and invention, as when —in virtue 
of the identifying of two things lying far apart in nature — 
whatever is known of the one is instantly transferred to the 
other, thereby constituting a new and instructive combination 
of ideas. Such was the case when Franklin’s identification of 
electricity and thunder, led to the application of the Leyden jar 
to explain a thunderstorm. The power of recalling like by like, 
in spite of remoteness, disguise, and false lures, enters into 
avery large number of inventive efforts, both in the sciences and 
in the arts. But we have now to deal with constructions of a 
higher order of complexity. There are discoveries that seem 
nothing short of absolute creations, as the whole science of 
Mathematics; while, in the Fine Arts, a frieze of the Parthe- 
non, a Gothic cathedral, a Paradise Lost, are very far beyond 
the highest stretches of the identifying faculty taken by itself. 
Nevertheless, the intellectual forces operating in those crea- 
tions, are no other than the associating forces already discussed. 
The new combinations grow out of elements already possessed 
by the mind, and brought to view according to the laws above 
laid down.

CHAPTER II. THE COMPOSITION OF MIND 
§ 64. IN the last chapter we incidentally encroached on 
the topic to which this chapter is to be devoted. Certain 
apparently-simple feelings were shown to be compounded of 
units of feeling; whence it was inferred that possibly, if not 
probably, feelings of other classes are similarly compounded. 
And‘n thus treating of the composition of feelings, we, by 
implication, treated of the composition of Mind, of which feel- 
ings are themselves components. 
Here, however, leaving speculations about the ultimate 
composition of Mind, we pass to observations on its proximate 
composition. Accepting as really simple those constituents of 
Mind which are not decomposable by introspection, we have 
to consider what are their fundamental distinctive characters, 
and what are the essential principles of arrangement among 
them. 
§ 65. The proximate components of Mind are of two broadly- 
contrasted kinds — Feelings and the Relations between feel- 
ings. Among the members of each group there exist multitud- 
inous unlikenesses, many of which are extremely strong; but 
such unlikenesses are small compared with those which dis- 
tinguish members of the one group from members of the other. 
Let us, in the first place, consider what are the characters which 
all Feelings have in common, and what are the characters which 
Relations between feelings have in common.

Each feeling, as we here define it, is any portion of conscious- 
ness which occupies a place sufficiently large to give it a per- 
ceivable individuality; which has its individuality marked off 
from adjacent portions of consciousness by qualitative con- 
trasts; and which, when introspectively contemplated, appears 
to be homogeneous. These are the essentials. Obviously if 
under introspection, a state of consciousness is decomposable, 
into unlike parts that exist either simultaneously or succes- 
sively, it is not one feeling but two or more. Obviously if it is 
indistinguishable from an adjacent portion of consciousness, it 
forms one with that portion — is not an individual feeling but 
part of one. And obviously if it does not occupy in conscious- 
ness an appreciable area, or an appreciable duration, it cannot 
be known as a feeling. 
A relation between feelings is, on the contrary, characterized 
by occupying no appreciable part of consciousness. Take away 
the terms it unites, and it disappears along with them; having 
no independent place — no individuality of its own. It is true, 
that, under an ultimate analysis, what we call a relation proves 
to be itself a kind of feeling — the momentary feeling accom- 
panying the transition from one conspicuous feeling to an 
adjacent conspicuous feeling. And it is true that, notwith- 
standing its extreme brevity, its qualitative character is appre- 
ciable; for relations are (as we shall hereafter see) distinguish- 
able from one another only by the unlikenesses of the feelings 
which accompany the momentary transitions. Each relational 
feeling may, in fact, be regarded as one of those nervous shocks 
which we suspect to be the units of composition of feelings; and, 
though instantaneous, it is known as of greater or less strength 
and as taking place with greater or less facility. But the con- 
trast between these relational feelings and what we ordinarily 
call feelings, is so strong that we must class them apart. Their 
extreme brevity, their small variety, and their dependence on 
the terms they unite, differentiate them in an unmistakeable 
way.? 
1 It will perhaps be objected that some relations, as those between things 
which are distant in Space or in Time, occupy distinguishable portions of con-
-P-A-G-E-529
THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 507 
Perhaps it will be well to recognize more fully the truth that 
this distinction cannot be absolute. Besides admitting that, as 
an element of consciousness, a relation is a momentary feeling, 
we must also admit that just as a relation can have no existence 
apart from the feelings which form its terms, so a feeling can 
exist only by relations to other feelings which limit it in space 
or time or both. Strictly speaking, neither a feeling nor a rela- 
tion is an independent element of consciousness: there is 
throughout a dependence such that the appreciable areas of 
consciousness occupied by feelings, can no more possess indi- 
vidualities apart from the relations which link them, than these 
relations can possess individualities apart from the feelings they 
link. The essential distinction between the two, then, appears 
to be that whereas a relational feeling is a portion of conscious- 
ness inseparable into parts, a feeling ordinarily so-called, is a 
portion of consciousness that admits imaginary division into 
like parts which are related to one another in sequence or co- 
existence. A feeling proper is either made up of like parts that 
occupy time, or it is made up of like parts that occupy space, or 
both. In any case, a feeling proper is an aggregate of related 
like parts, while a relational feeling is undecomposable. And 
this is exactly the contrast between the two which must result 
if, as we have inferred, feelings are composed of units of feeling, 
or shocks. 
§ 66. Simple feelings as above defined, are of various kinds. 
To say anything here about the classification of them, involves 
some forestalling of a future chapter. This breach of order, 
however, is unavoidable; for until certain provisional groupings 
have been made, further exposition is scarcely practicable. 
Limiting our attention to seemingly-homogeneous feelings 
as primarily experienced, they may be divided into the feelings 
which are centrally initiated and the feelings which are peri- 
sciousness. These, however, are not the simple relations between adjacent 
feelings which we are here dealing with. They are relations that bridge over 
great numbers of intervening feelings and relations; and come into existence 
only by quick transitions through these intervening states, ending in the consoli- 
dation of them. 
  
a

pherally initiated — emotions and sensations. These have 
widely unlike characters. Towards the close of this volume 
evidence will be found that while the sensations are relatively 
simple, the emotions, though seeming to be simple are ex- 
tremely compound; and that a marked contrast of character 
between them hence results. But without referring to any 
essential unlikeness of composition, we shall shortly see that 
between the centrally-initiated feelings and the peripherally- 
initiated feelings, fundamental distinctions may be established 
by introspective comparison. 
A subdivision has to be made. The peripherally-initiated 
feelings, or sensations, may be grouped into those which, 
caused by disturbances at the ends of nerves distributed on 
the outer surface, are taken to imply outer agencies, and those 
which, caused by disturbances at the ends of nerves distributed 
within the body, are not taken to imply outer agencies; which 
last, though not peripherally initiated in the ordinary sense, are 
so in the physiological sense. But as between the exterior of the 
body and its interior, there are all gradations of depth, it results 
that this distinction is a broadly marked one, rather than a 
sharply marked one. We shall, however, find that certain dif- 
ferential characters among the sensations accompany this dif- 
ference of distribution of the nerves in which they arise; and 
that they are decided in proportion to the relative superficiality 
or centrality of these nerves. 
In contrast with this class of primary or real feelings, thus 
divided and subdivided, has to be set the complementary class 
of secondary or ideal feelings, similarly divided and subdivided. 
Speaking generally, the two classes differ greatly in intensity. 
While the primary or originally-produced feelings are relatively 
vivid, the secondary or reproduced feelings are relatively faint. 
It should be added that the vivid feelings are taken to imply 
objective exciting agents then and there acting on the peri- 
phery of the nervous system; while the faint feelings, though 
taken to imply objective exciting agents which thus acted at a 
past time, are not taken to imply their present action. 
We are thus obliged to carry with us a classification based
-P-A-G-E-531
  THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 509 
on structure and a classification based on function. The divi- 
sion into centrally-initiated feelings, called emotions, and peri- 
pherally-initiated feelings, called sensations; and the subdivi- 
sion of these last into sensations that arise on the exterior of the 
body and sensations that arise in its interior; respectively refer 
to differences among the parts in action. Whereas the division 
into vivid or real feelings and faint or ideal feelings, cutting 
across the other divisions at right angles as we may say, refers 
to difference of amount in the actions of these parts. The first 
classification has in view unlikenesses of kind among the feel- 
ings; and the second, a marked unlikeness of degree, common to 
all the kinds. 
§ 67. From the classes of simple feelings we pass to the 
classes of simple relations between feelings, respecting which 
also, something must be said before we can proceed. In default 
of an ultimate analysis, which cannot be made at present, cer- 
tain brief general statements must suffice. 
As already said, the requisite to the existence of a relation 
is the existence of two feelings between which it is the link. The 
requisite to the existence of two feelings is some difference. 
And therefore the requisite to the existence of a relation is the 
occurrence of a change — the passage from one apparently- 
uniform state to another apparently-uniform state, implying 
the momentary shock produced by the commencement of a 
new state. 
It follows that the degree of the change or shock, constituting 
in other words the consciousness of the degree of difference 
between the adjacent states, is the ultimate basis of the dis- 
tinctions among relations. Hence the fundamental division of 
them into relations between feelings that are equal, or those of 
likeness (which however must be divided by some portion of 
consciousness that is unlike them), and relations between feel- 
ings that are unequal, or those of unlikeness. These last fall 
into what we may distinguish as relations of descending inten- 
sity and relations of ascending intensity, according as the tran- 
sition is to a greater or to a less amount of feeling. And they 
 
-P-A-G-E-532
  510 HERBERT SPENCER 
are further distinguishable into relations of quantitative un- 
likeness, or those occurring between feelings of the same nature 
but different in degree, and relations of qualitative unlikeness, 
or those occurring between feelings not of the same nature. 
Relations thus contemplated simply as changes, and grouped 
according to the degree of change or the kind of change, sever- 
ally belong to one or other of two great categories which take 
no account of the terms as like or unlike in nature or amount, 
but which take account only of their order of occurrence, as 
either simultaneous or successive. This fundamental division 
of relations into those of co-existence and those of sequence, is, 
however, itself dependent on the preceding division into rela- 
tions of equality between feelings and relations of inequality 
between them. For relations themselves have to be classed as of 
like or unlike kinds by comparing the momentary feelings that 
attend the establishment of them, and observing whether these 
are like or unlike, and, as we shall hereafter see, the relations of 
co-existence and sequence are distinguished from one another 
only by process of this kind. 
§ 68. Having defined simple feelings and simple relations, 
and having provisionally classified the leading kinds of each, 
we may now go on to observe how Mind is made up of these 
elements, and how different portions of it are characterized by 
different modes of combination of them. 
Tracts of consciousness formed of feelings that are centrally 
initiated, are widely unlike tracts of consciousness formed of 
feelings that are peripherally initiated; and of the tracts of con- 
sciousness formed of peripherally-initiated feelings, those parts 
occupied by feelings that take their rise in the interior of the 
body are widely unlike those parts occupied by feelings that 
take their rise on the exterior of the body. The marked unlike- 
nesses are in both cases due to the greater or smaller porpor- 
tions of the relational elements that are present. Whereas 
among centrally-initiated feelings, the mutual limitations, both 
simultaneous and successive, are vague and far between; and 
whereas among peripherally-initiated feelings caused by inter-
-P-A-G-E-533
THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY SII 
nal disturbances, some are extremely indefinite, and few or none 
definite in a high degree; feelings caused by external disturb- 
ances are mostly related quite clearly, alike by co-existence and 
sequence, and among the highest of them the mutual limita- 
tions in space or time or both, are extremely sharp. These 
broad contrasts, dependent on the extent to which the elements 
of feeling are compounded with the elements of relation, cannot 
be understood, and their importance perceived, without illus- 
trations. We will begin with those parts of Mind distinguished 
by predominance of the relational elements. 
Remembering that the lenses of the eye form a nonsentient 
optical apparatus that casts images on the retina, we may fairly 
say that the retina is brought more directly into contact with 
the external agent acting on it than is any other peripheral 
expansion of the nervous system. And it is in the tracts of con- 
sciousness produced by the various lights reflected from objects 
around and concentrated on the retina, that we find the ele- 
ments of feeling most intimately woven up with the elements of 
relation. The multitudinous states of consciousness yielded by 
vision, areabove all others sharp in theirmutual limitations; the 
differences that occur between adjacent ones are extremely 
definite. It is further to be noted that the relational element is 
here dominant under both of its fundamental forms. Some of 
the feelings simultaneously limit one another with great dis- 
tinctness, and some of them with equal distinctness succes- 
sively limit one another. The feelings caused by 
actionson the general surface of the body are marked off clearly, 
though by no means so clearly as those which arise in the retina. 
Sensations of touch initiated at points on the skin very near one 
another, form parts of consciousness that are separate though 
adjacent; and these are distinguishable not only as co-existing 
in close proximity, but also as distinct from kindred sensations 
immediately preceding or immediately succeeding them. 
Moreover the definiteness of their mutual limitations, in space 
if not in time, is greatest among the sensations of touch pro- 
ceeding from parts of the surface which have, in a sense, the 
greatest externality — the parts which, like the tips of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-534
  512 HERBERT SPENCER 
fingers and the tip of the tongue, have the most frequent and 
varied converse with outer objects.? Next in the 
definiteness of their mutual limitations come the auditory feel- 
ings. Among such of these as occur together, the relations are 
marked with imperfect clearness. Received through unculti- 
vated ears, only a few simultaneous sounds are vaguely sepa- 
rable in consciousness; though received through the ears of a 
musician, many such sounds may be distinguished and identi- 
fied. But among successive sounds the relational components 
of mind are conspicuous. Differences between tones that follow 
one another, even very rapidly, are clearly perceived. But the 
demarcations are less decided than those between contrasted 
sensations in the field of vision. Passing to the sen- 
sations of taste, we see that these, less external in their origin 
(for it is not in the tip of the tongue, but over its hinder part 
and the back of the palate, that the gustatory nerves are dis- 
tributed), are comparatively indefinite in their relations. Such 
distinctions as may be perceived between tastes that co-exist 
are comparatively vague, and can be extended to but two or 
three. Similarly, the beginnings and ends of successive tastes 
are far less sharp than the beginnings and ends of the visual 
impressions we receive at every glance; nor can successive 
tastes be distinguished with anything like the same rapidity as 
successive tones. Even more undecided are the mu- 
tual limitations among sensations of smell, which, like the last, 
originate at a considerable distance from the surface (for the 
nose is not the seat of smell: the olfactory chamber, with which 
the nostrils communicate, is seated high up between the eyes). 
Of simultaneous smells the discrimination is very vague; and 
probably not more than three can be separately identified. Of 
smells that follow one another, it is manifest that they begin 
and end indefinitely, and that they cannot be experienced in 
rapid succession. 
1 The tongue is a much more active tactual organ than at first appears. The 
mechanical impressions it receives are not limited to those given by the food 
which it manages during mastication; but at other times it is perpetually explor- 
ing the inner surfaces of the teeth, which are to it external bodies.
-P-A-G-E-535
    THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 513 
Wecome now to the peripherally-initiated feelings set up by 
internal disturbances. Among these the most superficial in 
origin and most relational as they exist in consciousness, are the 
sensations of muscular tension. Though, except when making 
vigorous efforts, these are but feeble; though such as are present 
together mutually limit one another in a very vague way; and 
though their beginnings and ends are so blurred that a series of 
them is but indistinctly separable into parts; yet they are juxta- 
posed and contrasted to the extent implied by discriminations 
and recognitions of them — discriminations and recognitions so 
partial, however, as frequently to require indirect verifications. 
It should be added that the relations among muscular feelings 
are variable in abundance and distinctness. They are most con- 
spicuous when the feelings come from muscles that are small, 
and in perpetual action, as those which move the eyes, the fin- 
gers, and the vocal organs; and least conspicuous when the 
feelings come from muscles that are large or centrally seated, 
or both, as those of the legs and of the trunk. Pass- 
ing over abnormal feelings of pain and discomfort due to dis- 
turbances of nerves distributed within the limbs and body, 
among which the small proportion of the relational element is 
manifest, it will suffice if we come at once to the feelings origin- 
ating in parts that are remotest from the external world, and 
which, at least relational, are most distinguished from those we 
set out with. Hunger is extremely vague in its beginning and 
end. Commencing unobtrusively and ceasing gradually, it is 
utterly unlike those feelings which, closely contiguous in time, 
make one another distinct by mutual limitation. Neither is it 
appreciably marked out by co-existing feelings; its position 
among simultaneous states of consciousness is indeterminate. 
And this indefiniteness of relation, both in space and time, 
characterizes other visceral feelings, both normal and ab- 
normal. 
Of the centrally-initiated feelings, or emotions, much the 
same has to be said as of the last. Their beginnings and endings 
in time are comparatively indefinite, and they have no definite 
localizations in space. That is to say, they are not limited by
-P-A-G-E-536
  514 HERBERT SPENCER 
preceding and succeeding states of consciousness with any pre- 
cision; and no identifiable bounds are put to them by states of 
consciousness that co-exist. Here, then, the relational element 
of mind is extremely inconspicuous. The sequences among 
emotions that can occur in a given period, are comparatively 
few and indeterminate; and between such two or three emo- 
tions as can co-exist it is impossible to distinguish in more than 
a vague way. 
§ 69. Further and equally important distinctions obtain 
between the tracts of consciousness thus broadly contrasted, 
and they are similarly caused. Presence of the relational ele- 
ments, seen in the mutual limitations of feelings, simultaneous 
and successive, is accompanied by the mutual cohesion of 
feelings; and absence of the relational elements, seen in the 
indeterminate boundaries of feelings in space and time, is 
accompanied by their incoherence. Let us re-observe the tracts 
of consciousness above compared. 
The sharply-defined patches of colour that occur together 
in a visual impression, are indissolubly united — held rigidly 
in juxtaposition. And successive visual feelings, such as are 
produced by transferring the gaze from one object to another, 
have a strength of connection that gives a fixed consciousness 
of their order. Thus the visual feelings, above all others dis- 
tinguished by the sharpness of their mutual limitations, are 
absolutely coherent in space and very coherent in time. 
Between sensations of touch given by an object grasped, the 
cohesion is not so great. Though the two feelings produced by 
two points felt simultaneously by a finger, hold together so 
that they cannot be removed far from one another in con- 
sciousness; yet the bond uniting them has much less rigidity 
than the bond uniting the visual feelings produced by the 
two points; and when the feelings are more than two, their 
connections in consciousness are loose enough to permit of 
much variation in the conception of their relative positions. 
Still the strength of links between co-existing feelings of touch 
is considerable; as is also that between successive feelings of the
-P-A-G-E-537
    THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 515 
same kind. Among the simultaneous feelings caused 
by simultaneous sounds, especially if they are not in harmony, 
the defect of cohesion is as marked as the defect of mutual 
limitation. But among the successive feelings produced by suc- 
cessive sounds, we find that along with distinct mutual limita- 
tions there go decided mutual cohesions. Sequent notes, or 
articulations, cling together with tenacity. Much 
less clearly bounded by one another as are tastes, simultaneous 
and successive, they are also comparatively incoherent. Among 
co-existent tastes there are no connections like those between 
co-existent visual feelings, or even like those between the 
sounds produced at the same instant by a band; and tastes do 
not hold together in sequence as do the tones of cadence. 
Of smells the like is true. Along with vagueness in the bound- 
ing of one by another there goes but a feeble linking together. 
The feelings accompanying muscular actions have cohesions 
that are hidden in much the same way as are their limitations. 
The difficulty of observing the mutual limitations of muscular 
feelings, is due to the fact that each muscle, or set of muscles, 
passes from a state of rest to a state of action or from a state of 
action to a state of rest, through gradations that occupy an ap- 
preciable time; and that, consequently, the accompanying feel- 
ing, instead of beginning and ending strongly, shades off at both 
extremes. Being thus weak at the places where they are con- 
tiguous, these feelings are incapable of strong cohesions. Indeed, 
if we except those which accompany great efforts, we may say 
that they are altogether so faint compared with most others 
that their relations, both in kind and order, are necessarily 
inconspicuous. Their cohesions are in a great degree those of 
automatic nervous acts; and are by so much the less the cohe- 
sions of conscious states. Those very vague feelings 
which have their seats in the viscera, may, as before, be exem- 
plified by hunger. Here where we reach such extreme inde- 
finiteness of limitation, both in space and time, we reach an 
extreme want of cohesion. Hunger does not suddenly follow 
some other into consciousness; nor is it suddenly followed by 
some other. Neither is there any simultaneous feeling to which
-P-A-G-E-538
  516 HERBERT SPENCER 
it clings. The relational element of Mind is almost absent; 
holding only in a feeble degree with some tastes and smells. 
Lastly, among the centrally-initiated feelings, or emotions, 
the same connection of characters occurs. When emotions 
co-exist, they can scarcely be said to hold together: the bond 
between them is so feeble, that each may disappear without 
affecting the others. Between sequent emotions the links have 
no appreciable strength: no one is attached to another in such 
way as to produce constancy of succession. And though be- 
tween emotions and certain more definite feelings which pre- 
cede them, there are strong connections, yet these connections 
are not between emotions and single antecedent feelings, but 
between emotions and large groups of antecedent feelings; and 
even this cohesion, very variable in its strength, may entirely 
fail. 
§ 70. A further trait in the composition of Mind, dependent 
on these correlated traits, may next be set down. We have seen 
that tracts of consciousness formed of feelings produced by 
external disturbances, are mostly distinguished by predomi- 
nance of the relational element, involving clearness of mutual 
limitation and strength of cohesion among the component 
feelings; and we have seen that, contrariwise, the feelings pro- 
duced by internal disturbances, peripheral and central are 
mostly distnguished by comparative want of the relational 
element, involving proportionate defect of mutual limitation 
and cohesion. We have now to observe that the tracts of con- 
sciousness thus broadly contrasted, are, by consequence, broadly 
contrasted in the respect that, in the one case, the component 
feelings can unite into coherent and well-defined clusters, while, 
in the other case, they cannot so unite. 
The state of consciousness produced by an object seen is 
composed of sharply-outlined lights, shades, and colours, and 
the co-existent feelings and relations entering into one of these 
groups form an indissoluble whole. To a considerable degree, 
successive visual feelings cling together in defined groups. As 
most of them are caused by moving objects more or less com-
-P-A-G-E-539
THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 517 
plex, it is difficult to trace this clustering of them in sequence 
apart from their clustering in co-existence. But if we take the 
case of a bird that suddenly flies past close to a window out of 
which we are looking, it is manifest that the successive feelings 
form a consciousness of its line of movement so defined and 
coherent that we know, without having moved the eyes, what 
was its exact course. The clustering of auditory 
feelings, comparatively feeble among those occurring simul- 
taneously, is comparatively strong among those occurring suc- 
cessively. Hence the consolidated groups of sounds which we 
know in consciousness as words. Hence the chains of notes 
which we remember as musical phrases. The clustering 
of tactual feelings in relations of co-existence, though by no 
means so decided as the clustering of co-existent visual feelings, 
either in the extent or complexity of the clusters or the firmness 
with which their components are united, is nevertheless consid- 
erable. When the hand is laid on some small object, as a key, a 
number of impressions may be distinguished as separate though 
near one another; but while their mutual relations are so far 
fixed that approximate limits within which they exist are 
known, they do not constitute anything like such a fixed and 
defined group as those given by vision of the key. This imper- 
fect clustering in co-existence is accompanied by imperfect clus- 
tering in sequence. The successive feelings produced by a fly 
creeping over the hand, hold together strongly enough and 
definitely enough to constitute a consciousness of its general 
movement as being towards the wrist or from the wrist, across 
from right to left or from left to right; but they do not form a 
consciousness of its exact course. Tastes unite only 
into very simple and incoherent clusters in co-existence; while 
in sequence they scarcely unite at all. And the like is true of 
smells. 
Such capability of clustering as is displayed by the peri- 
pherally-initiated feelings caused by internal disturbances, oc- 
curs among those accompanying the movements of muscles. 
But, along with the comparative vagueness of limitation and 
_ want of strong cohesion which characterize these feelings, there
-P-A-G-E-540
  518 HERBERT SPENCER 
goes a comparative indistinctness of the clusters. Though the 
nervous acts of which muscular motions are results, combine 
into groups with much precision, yet the combination of them, 
at first feeble, becomes strong only by repetition. And as the 
repetition which makes the combination strong, makes it to the 
same extent automatic, the concomitant feelings become less 
and less distinct, and fade from consciousness as fast as they 
unite. How, in muscular acts, complete clustering and uncon- 
sciousness go together, is seen in the fact that consciousness 
impedes clustered muscular acts. After having many times 
gone through the series of compound movements required, it is 
possible to walk across the room in the dark and lay hold of the 
handle of the door — so long, that is, as the movements are 
gone through unthinkingly. If they are consciously made, 
failure is almost certain. Of the further class of feel- 
ings initiated within the body, including appetites, pains, &c., 
it is scarcely needful to say that there is among them no forma- 
tion of coherent groups. Their great indefiniteness of limita- 
tion and accompanying want of cohesion, forbid unions of them, 
either simultaneous or successive. 
Obviously the emotions are characterized by a like want of 
combining power. A confused and changing chaos is produced 
by any of them which co-exist. In fact, the absence among 
them of capacity for uniting, is as marked as its presence 
among those visual feelings with which we set out. 
§ 71. We come now to more complex manifestations of these 
general contrasts. In tracts of consciousness where the rela- 
tional element predominates, and where the clustering of feel- 
ings is consequently decided, the clusters themselves enter into 
relations one with another. Grouped feelings, together with 
the relations uniting them, are fused into wholes which, com- 
porting themselves as single feelings do, combine with other 
such consolidated groups in definite relations; and even groups 
of groups, similarly fused, become in like manner limited by, 
and coherent with, other groups of groups. Conversely, in 
tracts of consciousness where the relations are few and vague, 
nothing of the kind takes place.
-P-A-G-E-541
  THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 519 
It is among the visual feelings, above all others multitudin- 
ous, definite, and coherent in their relations, that this com- 
pound clustering is carried to the greatest extent. Along with 
the ability to form that complex consciousness of lights, shades, 
and colours, joined in relative positions, which constitute a 
man as present to sight, there goes the ability to form a con- 
sciousness of two men in a definite and coherent relation of 
position — there goes the ability to form a consciousness 
of a crowd of such men; nay, two or more such crowds 
may be mentally combined. The aggregate of definitely- 
related visual feelings known as a house, itself aggregates 
with others such to form the consciousness of a street, and the 
streets to form the consciousness of a town. Though the com- 
pound clustering of visual feelings in sequence is not so distinct 
or so strong, it is still very marked. Numerous complicated 
images produced by objects seen in succession, hang together 
in consciousness with considerable tenacity. There is 
little, if any, clustering of clusters among the simultaneous 
auditory feelings. But among the successive auditory feelings 
there are definite and coherent combinations of groups with 
groups. The fused set of sounds we call a word, unites with 
many others such into a sentence. In some minds these clus- 
ters of clusters of successive sounds again cluster very defin- 
itely and coherently: many successive sentences are, as we say, 
accurately remembered. And similarly, musical phrases will 
cling together into a long and elaborate melody. Among 
the tactual feelings this compound clustering is scarcely trace- 
able, either in space or time; and there is not the remotest 
approach to it in the olfactory and gustatory feelings. 
For form’s sake it is needful to say that these higher degrees 
of mental composition are entirely wanting among the inter- 
nally-initiated feelings. Only among those which accompany 
muscular motion is there any approach to it; and here the 
compound clustering, like the simple clustering, entails pro- 
gressing unconsciousness. 
§ 72. One more kindred trait of composition must be set 
 
-P-A-G-E-542
520 HERBERT SPENCER 
down. Thus far we have observed only the degrees of mutual 
limitation, of cohesion, and of complex combining power, 
among feelings within each order. It remains to observe the 
extent to which feelings of one order enter into relations with 
those of another, and the consequent amounts of their mutual 
limitations and of their combining powers. To trace out these 
at all fully would carry us into unmanageable detail. We must 
confine ourselves to leading facts. 
Feelings of different orders do not limit one another as clearly 
as feelings of the same order do. The clustered colours pro- 
duced by an object at which we look are but little interfered 
with by a sound: the sound does not put any appreciable 
boundary to them in consciousness, but serves merely to di- 
minish their dominance in consciousness. Neither the combined 
noises which make up a conversation at table, nor the impres- 
sions received through the eyes from the dishes on the table, 
are excluded from the mind by the accompanying tactual feel- 
ings and tastes and smells, as much as colours are excluded by 
colours, sounds by sounds, tastes by tastes, or one tactual feeling 
by another. Of sensations arising within the body, and still 
more of emotions, it may be said that, unless intense, they dis- 
turb but slightly the sensations otherwise arising’ It would 
almost seem as though a sensation of colour, a sensation of 
sound, and a pleasurable emotion produced by the sound, 
admit of being superposed in consciousness with but little mu- 
tual obscuration. Doubtless in most cases two simple feelings, 
or two clustered feelings of different orders, put bounds to one 
another in time if not in space: there is an extremely rapid 
extrusion of each by the other rather than a continuous pres- 
ence of either. But it is manifest that these alternating ex- 
trusions, partial or complete, by feelings of different orders, are 
less distinct than the extrusion of one another by feelings of the 
same order. 
It is a correlative truth that feelings of different orders cohere 
with one another less strongly than do feelings of the same 
order. The impressions which make up the visual conscious- 
ness of an object, hang together more firmly than the group of
-P-A-G-E-543
     THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 521 
them does with the group of sounds making up the name of the 
object. The notes composing a melody have a stronger ten- 
dency to drag one another into consciousness than any one, or 
all of them, have to drag into consciousness the sights along 
with which they occurred: these last may or may not cohere 
with them; but the following of one note by the next is often 
difficult to prevent. Similarly, though there is considerable 
cohesion between the visual sensations produced by an orange 
and the taste or smell of the orange, yet it is quite usual to have 
a visual consciousness of an orange without its taste or its smell 
arising in consciousness; while it is scarcely possible to have 
before the mind one of its apparent characters unaccompanied 
by other apparent characters. 
A further fact of moment must be added. The feelings of 
different orders which enter into definite relations and cohere 
most strongly, are those among which there is a predominance 
of the relational elements; and there is an especial facility of 
combination between those feelings of different orders which 
are respectively held together by relations of the same order. 
Thus the co-existent visual feelings, most relational of all, enter 
into very definite and coherent relations with co-existent tact- 
ful feelings. To the group of lights and shades an object yields 
to the eyes, there attaches itself very strongly the group of im- 
pressions produced by touching and grasping the object. Next 
in order of strength are the connections between sensations 
received through the eyes and those received through the ears; 
or rather — between clusters of the one and clusters of the 
other. But though the feelings clustered in co-existence that 
form the visual consciousness of anything, are linked with 
much strength to the feelings clustered in sequence that form 
the consciousness of its name; yet, probably because the feelings 
forming the one cluster not only differ in kind from those form- 
ing the other but are held together by relations of a different 
order, the cohesion of the two clusters is not so strong. As we 
descend towards the unrelational feelings we find that this com- 
bining power of class with class decreases. Between tastes and 
smells and certain visceral sensations, such as hunger and   
-P-A-G-E-544
    
   522 HERBERT SPENCER 
nausea, there is, indeed, a considerable aptitude to cohere. 
But after admitting exceptions, it remains true on the average 
that the extremely un-relational states of consciousness of 
different orders, connect but feebly with one another and with 
the extremely-relational states of consciousness. 
§ 73. Thus far we have proceeded as though Mind were 
composed entirely of the primary or vivid feelings, and the 
relations among them; ignoring the secondary or faint feelings. 
Or if, as must be admitted, there has been a tacit recognition of 
these secondary feelings in parts of the foregoing sections which 
deal with the relations and cohesions of feelings in sequence 
(since in a sequence of feelings those which have passed have 
become faint, and only the one present is vivid) ; yet there has 
been no avowed recognition of them as components of Mind 
different from, though closely allied with, the primary feelings. 
We must now specially consider them and the part they play. 
The cardinal fact to be noted as of co-ordinate importance 
with the facts above noted, is that while each vivid feeling is 
joined to, but distinguished from, other vivid feelings, simul- 
taneous or successive, it is joined to, and identified with, faint 
feelings that have resulted from foregoing similar vivid feelings. 
Each particular colour, each special sound, each sensation of 
touch, taste, or smell, is at once known as unlike other sensa- 
tions that limit it in space or time, and known as like the faint 
forms of certain sensations that have preceded it in time — 
unites itself with foregoing sensations from which it does not 
differ in quality but only in intensity. 
On this law of composition depends the orderly structure, of 
Mind. In its absence there could be nothing but a perpetual 
kaleidoscopic change of feelings — an ever-transforming pre- 
sent without past or future. It is because of this tendency 
which vivid feelings have severally to cohere with the faint 
forms of all preceding feelings like themselves, that there arise 
what we call ideas. A vivid feeling does not by itself constitute 
a unit of that aggregate of ideas entitled knowledge. Nor does 
a single faint feeling constitute such a unit. But an idea, or unit
-P-A-G-E-545
  THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 523 
of knowledge, results when a vivid feeling is assimilated to, or 
coheres with, one or more of the faint feelings left by such vivid 
feelings previously experienced. From moment to moment the 
feelings that constitute consciousness segregate — each be- 
coming fused with the whole series of others like itself that have 
gone before it; and what we call knowing each feeling as such or 
such, is our name for this act of segregation. 
The process so carried on does not stop with the union of 
each feeling, as it occurs, with the faint forms of all preceding 
like feelings. Clusters of feelings are simultaneously joined 
with the faint forms preceding like clusters. An idea of an ob- 
ject or act is composed of groups of similar and similarly- 
related feelings that have arisen in consciousness from time 
to time, and have formed a consolidated series of which the 
members have partially or completely lost their individuali- 
ties. : 
This union of present clustered feelings with past clustered 
feelings is carried to a much greater degree of complexity. 
Groups of groups coalesce with kindred groups of groups that 
preceded them; and in the higher types of Mind, tracts of con- 
sciousness of an excessively composite character are produced 
after the same manner. 
To complete this general conception it is needful to say that 
as with feelings, so with the relations between feelings. Parted 
so far as may be from the particular pairs of feelings and pairs 
of groups of feelings they severally unite, relations themselves 
are perpetually segregated. From moment to moment relations 
are distinguished from one another in respect of the degrees of 
contrast between their terms and the kinds of contrast between 
their terms; and each relation, while distinguished from various 
concurrent relations, is assimilated to previously-experienced 
relations like itself. Thus result ideas of relations as those of 
strong contrast or weak contrast, of descending intensity or 
ascending intensity, of homogeneity of kind or heterogeneity of 
kind. Simultaneously occurs a segregation of a different species. 
Each relation of co-existence is classed with other like relations 
of co-existence and separated from relations of co-existence that
-P-A-G-E-546
    524 HERBERT SPENCER 
are unlike it; and a kindred classing goes on among relations of 
sequence. Finally, by a further segregation, are formed that 
consolidated abstract of relations of co-existence which we 
know as Space, and that consolidated abstract of relations of 
sequence which we know as Time. This process, here briefly 
indicated merely to show its congruity with the general process 
of composition, cannot be explained at length: the elucidation 
must come hereafter. 
§ 74. And now having roughly sketched the composition of 
Mind — having, to preserve clearness of outline, omitted de- 
tails and passed over minor qualifications; let me go on to indi- 
cate.the essential truth which it is a chief purpose of this chap- 
ter to bring into view — the truth that the method of composi- 
tion remains the same throughout the entire fabric of Mind 
from the formation of its simplest feelings up to the formation 
of those immense and complex aggregates of feelings which 
characterize its highest developments. 
In the last chapter we saw that what is objectively a wave of 
molecular change propagated through a nerve-centre, is sub- 
jectively a unit of feeling, akin in nature to what we call a nerv- 
ous shock. In one case we found conclusive proof that when a 
rapid succession of such waves yield a rapid succession of such 
units of feeling, there results the continuous feeling known as a 
sensation; and that the quality of the feeling changes when 
these waves and corresponding units of feeling recur with a dif- 
ferent rapidity. Further, it was shown that by unions among 
simultaneous series of such units recurring at unlike rates, 
countless other seemingly-simple sensations are produced. And 
we inferred that what unquestionably holds among these 
primary feelings of one order, probably holds among primary 
feelings of all orders. To what does this conclusion amount, 
expressed in another way? It amounts to the conclusion that 
one of these feelings which, as introspectively contemplated, 
appears uniform, is really generated by the perpetual assimila- 
tion of a new pulse of feeling to pulses of feeling immediately 
preceding it: the sensation is constituted by the linking of each
-P-A-G-E-547
THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 525 
vivid pulse as it occurs, with the series of past pulses that were 
severally vivid but have severally become faint. And what, 
otherwise stated, is the conclusion that compound sensations 
result from unions among different concurrent series of such 
pulses? It is that while the component pulses of each series are, 
as they occur, severally assimilated to, or linked with, preced- 
ing pulses of their own kind, they are also severally combined 
in some relation with the pulses of concurrent series; and the 
compound sensation so generated is known as different from 
other compound sensations of the same order, by virtue of 
some speciality in the relations among the concurrent series. 
Consider now, under its most general form, the process of 
composition of Mind described in foregoing sections. It is no 
other than this same process carried out on higher and higher 
platforms, with increasing extent and complication: As we 
have lately seen, the feelings called sensations cannot of them- 
selves constitute Mind, even when great numbers of various 
kinds are present together. Mind is constituted only when each 
sensation is assimilated to the faint forms of antecedent-like 
sensations. The consolidation of successive units of feeling to 
form a sensation, is paralleled in a larger way by the consolida- 
tion of successive sensations to form what we call a knowledge 
of the sensation as such or such — to form the smallest separa- 
ble portion of what we call thought, as distinguished from mere 
confused sentiency. So too is it with the relations among those 
feelings that occur together and limit one another in space or 
time. Each of these relations, so long as it stands alone in expe- 
rience with no antecedent like relations, is not fully cognizable 
as a relation: it assumes its character as a component of intelli- 
gence only when, by recurrence of it, there is produced a serial 
aggregate of such relations. Observe further that while 
each special sensation is raised into a proixmate constituent of 
simple thought only by being fused with like predecessors, it 
becomes a proximate constituent of compound thought by 
simultaneously entering into relations of unlikeness with other 
sensations which limit it in space or time; just as we saw that 
the units or pulses that form simple sensations by serial union
-P-A-G-E-548
RS ee er ee ee 
526 HERBERT SPENCER 
with their kind, may simultaneously help to form complex sen- 
sations by entering into relations of difference with units of 
other kinds. The same thing obviously holds of the relations 
themselves, that exist between these unlike sensations. And 
thus it becomes manifest that the method by which simple sen- 
sations, and the relations among them, are compounded into 
states of definite consciousness, is essentially analogous to the 
method by which primitive units of feeling are compounded into 
sensations. 
The next higher stage of mental composition shows us this 
process repeating itself. The vivid cluster of related sensations 
produced in us by a special object, has to be united with the 
faint forms of clusters like it that have been before produced 
by such objects. What we call knowing the object, is the as- 
similation of this combined group of real feelings it excites, 
with one or more preceding ideal groups which objects of the 
same kind once excited; and the knowledge is clear only when 
the series of ideal groups is long. Equally does this 
principle hold of the connexions, static and dynamic, between 
each such special cluster and the special clusters generated by 
other objects. Knowledge of the powers and habits of things, 
dead and living, is constituted by assimilating the more or less 
complex relations exhibited by their actions in space and time 
with other such complex relations. If we cannot so assimilate 
them, or parts of them, we have no knowledge of their actions. 
That the same law of composition continues without definite 
limit through tracts of higher consciousness, formed of clusters 
of clusters of feelings held together by relations of an extremely 
involved kind, scarcely needs adding. 
§ 75. How clearly the evolution of Mind, as thus traced 
through ascending stages of composition, conforms to the laws 
of Evolution in general, will be seen as soon as it is said. We 
will glance at the correspondence under each of its leading 
aspects. 
Evolution is primarily a progressing integration; and 
throughout this chapter, as well as the last, progressing inte-
-P-A-G-E-549
THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 527 
gration has thrust itself upon us as the fundamental fact in 
mental evolution. We came upon it quite unexpectedly in the 
conclusion that a sensation is an integrated series of nervous 
shocks or units of feeling; and in the further conclusion that by 
integration of two or more such series, compound sensations are 
formed. We have lately seen that by an integration of succes- 
sive like sensations, there arises the knowledge of a sensation 
as such or such; and that each sensation as it occurs, while 
thus integrated with its like, also unites into an aggregate with 
other sensations that limit it in space or time. And we have 
similarly seen that the integrated clusters resulting, enter into ° 
higher integrations of both these kinds; and so on to the 
end. The significance of these facts will be appreciated 
when it is remembered that the tracts of consciousness in 
which integration is undecided, are tracts of consciousness 
hardly included in what we commonly think of as Mind; and 
that the tracts of consciousness presenting the attributes of 
Mind in the highest degree, are those in which the integration 
is carried furthest. Hunger, thirst, nausea, and visceral feelings 
in general, as well as feelings of love, hatred, anger, &c., which 
cohere little with one another and with other feelings, and thus 
integrate but feebly into groups, are portions of consciousness 
that play but subordinate parts in the actions we chiefly class as 
mental. Mental actions, ordinarily so called, are nearly all 
carried on in terms of those tactual, auditory, and visual feel- 
ings, which exhibit cohesion, and consequent ability to inte- 
grate, in so conspicuous a manner. Our intellectual operations 
are indeed mostly confined to the auditory feelings (as inte- 
grated into words) and the visual feelings (as integrated into 
impressions and ideas of objects, their relations, and their 
motions). After closing the eyes and observing how relatively- 
immense is the part of intellectual consciousness that is sud- 
denly shorn away, it will be manifest that the most developed 
portion of perceptive Mind is formed of these visual feelings 
which cohere so rigidly, which integrate into such large and nu- 
merous aggregates, and which re-integrate into aggregates im- 
mensely exceeding in their degree of composition all aggregates 
   
-P-A-G-E-550
ee ee ee ee 
528 HERBERT SPENCER 
formed by other feelings. And then, on rising to what we for 
convenience distinguish as rational Mind, we find the integra- 
tion taking a still wider reach. 
The ascending phases of Mind show us no less conspicu- 
ously, the increasing heterogeneity of these integrated aggre- 
gates of feelings. In the last chapter, we saw how sensations 
that are all composed of units of one kind, are rendered hetero- 
geneous by the combination and re-combination of such units 
in multitudinous ways. We have lately seen that the portions 
of consciousness occupied by the internal bodily feelings and by 
the emotions, are, as judged by introspection, relatively very 
simple or homogeneous: thirst is not made up of contrasted 
parts, nor can we separate a gust of passion into many distin- 
guishable components. But on passing upwards to intellectual 
consciousness, there meets us an increasing variety of kinds of 
feelings present together. When we come to the auditory feel- 
ings, which play so important a part in processes of thought, 
we find that the groups of them are formed of many compon- 
ents, and that those groups of groups used as symbols of pro- 
positions are very heterogeneous. As before however with 
integration, so where with heterogeneity, a far higher degree is 
reached in that consciousness formed of visual feelings, which 
is the most developed part of perceptive Mind. And much 
more heterogeneous still are those tracts of consciousness dis- 
tinguished as ratiocinative tracts, in which the multiform 
feelings given us by objects through eyes, ears, and tactual 
organs, nose, and palate, are formed into conceptions that 
answer to the objects in all their attributes, and all their 
activities. 
With equal clearness does Mind display the further trait of 
Evolution — increase of definiteness. Both the centrally- 
initiated feelings and the internal peripherally-initiated feel- 
ings, which play so secondary a part in what we understand 
as Mind, we found to be very vague — very imperfectly lim- 
ited by one another. Contrariwise, it was shown that the 
mutual limitations are decided among those peripherally- 
initiated feelings which, arising on the outer surface, enter
-P-A-G-E-551
THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY 529 
largely into our intellectual operations; and that the visual 
feelings, which enter by far the most largely into our intel- 
lectual operations, are not only by far the sharpest in their 
mutual limitations, but form aggregates that are much more 
definitely circumscribed than any others, and aggregates be- 
tween which there exist relations much more definite than 
those entered into by other aggregates. 
Thus the conformity is complete. Mind rises to what are 
universally recognized as its higher developments, in propor- 
tion as it manifests the traits characterizing Evolution in gen- 
eral (First Principles, §§ 98-145). A confused sentiency, 
formed of recurrent pulses of feeling having but little variety 
of kind and but little combination, we may conceive as the 
nascent Mind possessed by those low types in which nerves and 
nerve-centres are not yet clearly differentiated from one an- 
other, or from the tissues in which they lie. At a stage above 
this, while yet the organs of the higher senses are rudimentary 
and such nerves as exist are incompletely insulated, Mind is 
present probably under the form of a few sensations, which, like 
those yielded by our own viscera, are simple, vague, and inco- 
herent. And from this upwards, the mental evolution exhibits 
a differentiation of these simple feelings into the more numer- 
ous kinds which the special senses yield; an ever-increasing 
integration of such more varied feelings with one another and 
with feelings of other kinds; an ever-increasing multiformity in 
the aggregates of feelings produced; and an ever-increasing dis- 
tinctness of structure in such aggregates. That is to say, there 
goes on subjectively a change “from an indefinite, incoherent 
homogeneity to a definite, coherent heterogeneity;”’ parallel to 
that redistribution of matter and motion which constitutes 
Evolution as objectively displayed.

BOOK V. OF THE SENSES 
THE GENERAL LAws OF SENSATION 
Tue senses, by virtue of the peculiar properties of their 
several nerves, make us acquainted with the states of our own 
body, and they also inform us of the qualities and changes of 
external nature, as far as these give rise to changes in the condi- 
tion of the nerves. Sensation is a property common to all the 
senses; but the kind (“‘modus,’’) of sensation is different in 
each: thus we have the sensations of light, of sound, of taste, of 
smell, and of feeling, or touch. By feeling, or touch, we under- 
stand the peculiar kind of sensation of which the ordinary sen- 
sitive nerves generally —as, the nervus trigeminus, vagus, 
glosso-pharyngeus, and the spinal nerves, — are susceptible; 
the sensations of itching, of pleasure and pain, of heat and cold, 
and those excited by the act of touch in its more limited sense, 
are varieties of this mode of sensation. That which through the 
medium of our senses is actually perceived by the sensorium, is 
indeed merely a property or change of condition of our nerves; 
but the imagination and reason are ready to interpret the modi- 
fications in the state of the nerves produced by external influ- 
ences as properties of the external bodies themselves. This

  ELEMENTS OF PHYSIOCLCGY 531 
mode of regarding sensations has become so habitual in the case 
of the senses which are more rarely affected by internal causes, 
that it is only on reflection that, we perceive it to be erroneous. 
In the case of the sense of feeling or touch, on the contrary, 
where the peculiar sensations of the nerves perceived by the 
sensorium are excited as frequently by internal as by external 
causes, it is easily conceived that the feeling of pain or pleasure, 
for example, is a condition of the nerves, and not a property of 
the things which excite it. This leads us to the consideration of 
some general laws, a knowledge of which is necessary before 
entering on the physiology of the separate senses. 
I. In the first place, it must be kept in mind that external 
agencies can give rise to no kind of sensation which cannot also be 
produced by internal causes, exciting changes in the condition of 
our nerves. 
In the case of the sense of touch, this is at once evident. The 
sensations of the nerves of touch (or common sensibility) are 
those of cold and heat, pain and pleasure, and innumerable 
modifications of these, which are neither painful nor pleasur- 
able, but yet have the same kind of sensation as their element, 
though not in an extreme degree. All these sensations are con- 
stantly being produced by internal causes in all parts of our 
body endowed with sensitive nerves; they may also be excited 
by causes acting from without, but external agencies are not 
capable of adding any new element to their nature. The sensa- 
tions of the nerves of touch are therefore states or qualities 
proper to themselves, and merely rendered manifest by exciting 
causes external or internal. The sensation of smell also may be 
perceived independently of the application of any odorous sub- 
stance from without, the nerve of smell being thrown by an in- 
ternal cause into the condition requisite for the production of 
the sensation. This perception of the sensation of odours with- 
out an external exciting cause, though not of frequent occur- 
rence, has been many times observed in persons of an irritable 
nervous system; and the sense of taste is probably subject to the 
same affection, although it would be always difficult to deter- 
mine whether the taste might not be owing to a change in the  
-P-A-G-E-554
  532 JOHANNES MUELLER 
qualities of the saliva or mucus of the mouth; the sensation of 
nausea, however, which belongs to the sensations of taste, is 
certainly very often perceived as the result of a merely internal 
affection of the nerves. The sensations of the sense of vision, 
namely, colour, light, and darkness, are also perceived inde- 
pendently of all external exciting cause. In the state of the 
most perfect freedom from excitement, the optic nerve has no 
other sensation than that of darkness. The excited condition 
of the nerve is manifested, even while the eyes are closed, by the 
appearance of light, or luminous flashes, which are mere sensa- 
tions of the nerve, and not owing to the presence of any matter 
of light, and consequently are not capable of illuminating any 
surrounding objects. Every one is aware how common it is to 
see bright colours while the eyes are closed, particularly in the 
morning when the irritability of the nerves is still considerable. 
These phenomena are very frequent in children after waking 
from sleep. Through the sense of vision, therefore, we receive 
from external nature no impressions which we may not also 
experience from internal excitement of our nerves; and it is 
evident that a person blind from infancy in consequence of 
opacity of the transparent media of the eye, must have a per- 
fect internal conception of light and colours, provided the retina 
and optic nerve be free from lesion. The prevalent notions with 
regard to the wonderful sensations supposed to be experienced 
by persons blind from birth when their sight is restored by oper- 
ation, are exaggerated and incorrect. The elements of the sen- 
sation of vision, namely, the sensations of light, colour, and 
darkness, must have been previously as well known to such 
persons as to those of whom the sight has always been perfect. 
If, moreover, we imagine a man to be from his birth surrounded 
merely by external objects destitute of all variety of colours, so 
that he could never receive the impressions of colours from 
without, it is evident that the sense of vision might neverthe- 
less have been no less perfect in him than in other men; for 
light and colours are innate endowments of his nature, and 
require merely a stimulus to render them manifest. 
The sensations of hearing also are excited as well by internal
-P-A-G-E-555
  ELEMENTS OF PHYSIOLOGY 533 
as by external causes; for, whenever the auditory nerve is in a 
state of excitement, the sensations peculiar to it, as the sounds 
of ringing, humming, &c. are perceived. It is by such sensations 
that the diseases of the auditory nerve manifest themselves; 
and, even in less grave, transient affections of the nervous sys- 
tem, the sensations of humming and ringing in the ears afford 
evidence that the sense of hearing participates in the disturb- 
ance. 
No further proof is wanting to show, that external influences 
give rise in our senses to no other sensations, than those which 
may be excited in the corresponding nerves by internal causes. 
Il. The same internal cause excites in the different senses dif- 
ferent sensations; — in each sense the sensations peculiar to it. 
One uniform internal cause acting on all the nerves of the 
senses in the same manner, is the accumulation of blood in the 
capillary vessels of the nerve, as in congestion and inflamma- 
tion. This uniform cause excites in the retina, while the eyes 
are closed, the sensation of light and luminous flashes; in the 
auditory nerve, humming and ringing sounds; and in the 
nerves of feeling, the sensation of pain. In the same way, also, 
a narcotic substance introduced into the blood excites in the 
nerves of each sense peculiar symptoms; in the optic nerves the 
appearance of luminous sparks before the eyes; in the auditory 
nerves, “tinnitus aurium;” and in the common sensitive nerves 
the sensation of ants creeping over the surface. 
III. The same external cause also gives rise to different sensa- 
tions in each sense, according to the special endowments of its 
nerve. 
The mechanical influence of a blow, concussion, or pressure 
excites, for example, in the eye the sensation of light and 
colours. It is well known that by exerting pressure upon the 
eye, when the eyelids are closed, we can give rise to the appear- 
- ance of a luminous circle; by more gentle pressure the appear- 
ance of colours may be produced, and one colour may be made 
to change to another. Children, waking from sleep before day- 
light, frequently amuse themselves with these phenomena. The 
light thus produced has no existence external to the optic nerve,  
-P-A-G-E-556
  534. JOHANNES MUELLER 
it is merely a sensation excited in it. However strongly we press 
upon the eye in the dark, so as to give rise to the appearance of 
luminous flashes, these flashes, being merely sensations, are 
incapable of illuminating external objects. Of this any one may 
easily convince himself by experiment. I have in repeated trials 
never been able, by means of these luminous flashes in the eye, 
to recognise in the dark the nearest objects, or to see them bet- 
ter than before; nor could another person, while I produced by 
pressure on my eye the appearance of brilliant flashes, perceive 
in it the slightest trace of real light. 
A mechanical influence excites also peculiar sensations of the 
auditory nerve; at all events, it has become a common saying, 
“to give a person what will make his ears ring,” or “what will 
make his eyes flash fire,” or “ what will make him feel ”; so that 
the same cause, a blow, produces in the nerves of hearing, 
sight, and feeling, the different sensations proper to these 
senses. It has not become a part of common language that a 
blow shall be given which will excite the sense of smell, or of 
taste; nor would such sayings be correct; yet mechanical irri- 
tation of the soft palate, of the epiglottis and root of the tongue, 
excites the sensation of nausea. The actions of sonorous bodies 
on the organ of hearing is entirely mechanical. A sudden me- 
chanical impulse of the air upon the organ of hearing produces 
the sensation of a report of different degrees of intensity accord- 
ing to the violence of the impulse, just as an impulse upon th. 
organ of vision gives rise to the sensation of light. If the action 
of the mechanical cause on the organ of hearing be of continued 
duration, the sound is also continued; and when caused by a 
rapid succession of uniform impulses, or vibrations, it has a 
musical character. If we admit that the matter of light acts on 
bodies by mechanical oscillation (the undulation theory), we 
shall have another example of a mechanical influence, producing . 
different effects on different senses. These undulations, which 
produce in the eye the sensation of light, have no such effects 
on other senses; but in the nerves of feeling they produce the 
sensation of warmth.
-P-A-G-E-557
  ELEMENTS OF PHYSIOLOGY 535 
The stimulus of electricity may serve as a second example, ofa 
uniform cause giving rise in different nerves of sense to different * 
sensations. A single pair of plates of different metals applied so 
as to include the eye within the circle, excites the sensation of a 
bright flash of light when the person experimented upon is in a 
dark room; and, even though the eye do not lie within the cir- 
cle, if it be not distant from it, — as, for example, when one of 
the plates is applied to one of the eyelids, and the other to the 
interior of the mouth, — the same effect will be produced, 
owing toa part of the current of electricity being diverted to the 
eye. A more intense electric stimulus gives rise to more intense 
sensations of light. In the organ of hearing, electricity excites 
the sensation of sound. Volta states that, while his ears were 
included between the poles of a battery of forty pairs of plates, 
he heard a hissing and pulsatory sound, which continued as long 
as the circle was closed.* Ritter perceived a sound like that of 
the fiddle G at the moment of the closure of the galvanic circle. 
The electricity of friction, developed by the electrical ma- 
chine, excites in the olfactory nerves the odour of phosphorus. 
The application of plates of different metals to the tongue, 
gives rise to an acid or a saline taste, according to the length of 
the plates which are applied one above, and the other beneath 
the tongue. The facts detailed with regard to the other senses 
are sufficient to show that these latter phenomena cannot be 
attributed to decomposition of the salts of the saliva. 
The effects of the action of electricity on the nerves of com- 
mon sensation or feeling, are neither the sensation of light, of 
sound, of smell, nor of taste, but those proper to the nerves of 
feeling, namely, the sensations of pricking, of a blow, &c. 
Chemical influences also probably produce different effects 
on different nerves of sense. We have, of course, but few 
facts illustrating their action on these nerves; but we know that 
in the sensitive nerves of the skin they excite the different kinds 
of common sensation, — as the sensations of burning, pain, and 
heat; in the organ of taste, sensations of taste; and, when vola- 
tile, in the nerves of smell, the sensations of odours. Without

the infliction of great injury on the textures, it is impossible to 
‘apply chemical agents to the nerves of the higher senses, sight 
and hearing, except through the medium of the blood. Chem- 
ical substances introduced into the blood act on evety nerve of 
sense, and excite in each a manifestation of its properties. 
Hence the internal sensations of light and sound, which are well 
known to result from the action of narcotics. 
IV. The peculiar sensations of each nerve of sense can be excited 
by several distinct causes internal and external. 
The facts on which this statement is founded have been 
already mentioned; for we have seen that the sensation of light 
in the eye is excited: 
x. By the undulations or emanations which from their action 
on the eye are called light, although they have many other 
actions than this; for instance, they effect chemical changes, 
and are the means of maintaining the organic processes in 
plants. 
2. By mechanical influences; as concussion, or a blow. 
3. By electricity. 
4. By chemical agents, such as narcotics, digitalis, &c. which, 
being absorbed into the blood, give rise to the appearance of 
luminous sparks, &c. before the eyes independently of any 
external cause. 
5. By the stimulus of the blood in the state of congestion. 
The sensation of sound may be excited in the auditory nerve: 
1. By mechanical influences, namely, by the vibrations of 
sonorous bodies imparted to the organ of hearing through the 
intervention of media capable of propagating them. 
2. By electricity. 
3- By chemical influences taken into the circulation; such as 
the narcotics, or alterantia nervina. 
4. By the stimulus of the blood. 
The sensation of odours may be excited in the olfactory 
nerves: 
1. By chemical influences of a volatile nature, — odorous 
substances. 
2. By electricity.
-P-A-G-E-559
  ELEMENTS OF PHYSIOLCGY 537 
The sensation of taste may be produced: 
1. By chemical influences acting on the gustatory nerves 
either from without or through the medium of the blood; for, 
according to Magendie, dogs taste milk injected into their 
blood-vessels, and begin to lap with their tongue. 
2. By electricity. 
3. By mechanical influences; for we must refer to taste the 
sensation of nausea produced by mechanically irritating the 
velum palati, epiglottis, and root of the tongue. 
The sensations of the nerves of touch or feeling are excited: 
_ 1. By mechanical influences; as sonorous vibrations, and 
contact of any kind. 
2. By chemical influences. 
3. By heat. 
4. By electricity. 
5. By the stimulus of the blood. 
V. Sensation consists in the sensorium receiving through the 
medium of the nerves, and as the result of the action of an external 
cause, a knowledge of certain qualities or conditions, not of external 
bodies, but of the nerves of sense themselves; and these qualities of 
the nerves of sense are in all different, the nerve of each sense having 
its own peculiar quality or energy. 
The special susceptibility of the different nerves of sense for 
certain influences, — as of the optic nerve for light, of the 
auditory nerve for vibrations, and so on, — was formerly 
attributed to these nerves having each a specific irritability. 
But this hypothesis is evidently insufficient to explain all the 
facts. The nerves of the senses have assuredly a specific irri- 
tability for certain influences; for many stimuli, which exert 
a violent action upon one organ of sense, have little or no effect 
upon another: for example, light, or vibrations so infinitely 
rapid as those of light, act only on the nerves of vision and 
common sensation; slower vibrations, on the nerves of hearing 
and common sensation, but not upon those of vision; odorous 
substances only upon the olfactory nerves. The external stim- 
uli must therefore be adapted to the organ of sense — must be 
“homogeneous:” thus light is the stimulus adapted to the  
-P-A-G-E-560
538 JOHANNES MUELLER 
nerve of vision; while vibrations of less rapidity, which act upon 
the auditory nerve, are not adapted to the optic nerve, or are 
indifferent to it; for if the eye be touched with a tuning-fork 
while vibrating, a sensation of tremours is excited in the con- 
junctiva, but no sensation of light. We have seen, however, 
that one and the same stimulus, as electricity, will produce dif- 
ferent sensations in the different nerves of the senses; all the 
nerves are susceptible of its action, but the sensations in all are 
different. The same is the case with other stimuli, as chemical 
and mechanical influences. The hypothesis of a specific irrita- 
bility of the nerves of the senses for certain stimuli, is therefore 
insufficient; and we are compelled to ascribe, with Aristotle, pe- 
culiar energies to each nerve, — energies which are vital quali- 
ties of the nerve, just as contractility is the vital property of 
muscle. The truth of this has been rendered more and more 
evident in recent times by the investigation of the so-called 
“subjective” phenomena of the senses by Elliot, Darwin, Rit- 
ter, Goethe, Purkinje, and Hjort. Those phenomena of the 
senses, namely, are now styled “subjective,” which are pro- 
duced, not by the usual stimulus adapted to the particular 
nerve of sense, but by others which do not usually act upon it. 
These important phenomena were long spoken of as “illusions 
of the senses,” and have been regarded in an erroneous point of 
view; while they are really true actions of the senses, and must 
be studied as fundamental phenomena in investigations into 
their nature. 
The sensation of sound, therefore, is the peculiar “energy” 
or “quality” of the auditory nerve; the sensation of light and 
colours that of the optic nerve; and so of the other nerves of 
sense. An exact analysis of what takes place in the production 
of a sensation would of itself have led to this conclusion. The 
sensations of heat and cold, for example, make us acquainted 
with the existence of the imponderable matter of caloric, or of 
peculiar vibrations in the vicinity of our nerves of feeling. But 
the nature of this caloric cannot be elucidated by sensation, 
which is in reality merely a particular state of our nerves; it 
must be learnt by the study of the physical properties of this
-P-A-G-E-561
  ELEMENTS OF PHYSIOLOGY 539 
agent, namely, of the laws of its radiation, its development 
from the latent state, its property of combining with and pro- 
ducing expansion of other bodies, &c. All this again, however, 
does not explain the peculiarity of the sensation of warmth as 
a condition of the nerves. The simple fact devoid of all theory 
is this, that warmth, as a sensation, is produced whenever the 
matter of caloric acts upon the nerves of feeling; and that cold 
as a sensation, results from this matter of caloric being ab- 
stracted from a nerve of feeling. 
So, also, the sensation of sound is produced when a certain 
number of impulses or vibrations are imparted, within a certain 
time, to the auditory nerve: but sound, as we perceive it, is a 
very different thing from a succession of vibrations. The vibra- 
tions of a tuning-fork, which to the ear give the impression of 
sound, produce in a nerve of feeling or touch the sensation of 
tickling; something besides the vibrations must consequently 
be necessary for the production of the sensation of sound, and 
that something is possessed by the auditory nerve alone. Vision 
is to be regarded in the same manner. A difference in the in- 
tensity of the action of the imponderable agent, light, causes an 
inequality of sensation at different parts of the retina: whether 
this action consists in impulses or undulations, (the undulation 
theory,) or in an infinitely rapid current of imponderable mat- 
ter, (the emanation theory,) is a question here of noimportance. 
The sensation of moderate light is produced where the action of 
the imponderable agent on the retina is not intense; of bright 
light where its action is stronger, and of darkness or shade 
where the imponderable agent does not fall; and thus results a 
luminous image of determinate form according to the distribu- 
tion of the parts of the retina differently acted on. Colour is 
also a property of the optic nerve; and when excited by external 
light, arises from the peculiarity of the so-called coloured rays, 
or of the oscillations necessary for the production of the impres- 
sion of colour, —a peculiarity, the nature of which is not at 
present known. The nerves of taste and smell are capable of 
being excited to an infinite variety of sensations by external 
causes; but each taste is due to a determinate condition of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-562
  540 JOHANNES MUELLER 
nerve excited by the external cause; and it is ridiculous to say 
that the property of acidity is communicated to the sensorium 
by the nerve of taste, while the acid acts equally upon the nerves 
of feeling, though it excites there no sensation of taste. 
The essential nature of these conditions of the nerves, by 
virtue of which they see light and hear sound, — the essential 
nature of sound as a property of the auditory nerve, and of light 
as a property of the optic nerve, of taste, of smell, and of feel- 
ing, — remains, like the ultimate causes of natural phenomena 
generally, a problem incapable of solution. Respecting the na- 
ture of the sensation of the colour “blue,” for example, we can 
reason no farther; it is one of the many facts which mark the 
limits of our powers of mind. It would not advance the ques- 
tion to suppose the peculiar sensations of the different senses 
excited by one and the same cause, to result from the propaga- 
tion of vibrations of the nervous principle of different rapidity 
to the sensorium. Such an hypothesis, if at all tenable, would 
find its first application in accounting for the different sensa- 
tions of which a single sense is susceptible; for example, in ex- 
plaining how the sensorium receives the different impressions 
of blue, red, and yellow, or of an acute and a grave tone, or of 
painful and pleasurable sensations, or of the sensations of heat 
and cold, or of the tastes of bitter, sweet, and acid. It is only 
with this application that the hypothesis is worthy of regard: 
tones of different degrees of acuteness are certainly produced by 
vibrations of sonorous bodies of different degrees of rapidity; and 
a slight contact of a solid body, which singly excites in a nerve 
of common sensation merely the simple sensation of touch, pro- 
duces in the same nerve when repeated rapidly, as the vibra- 
tions of a sonorous body, the feeling of tickling; so that possibly 
a pleasurable sensation, even when it arises from internal causes 
independently of external influences, is due to the rapidity of 
the vibrations of the nervous principle in the nerves of feeling. 
The accuracy of our discrimination by means of the senses 
. depends on the different manner in which the conditions of our 
nerves are affected by different bodies; but the preceding con-
-P-A-G-E-563
  ELEMENTS OF PHYSIOLOGY 541 
siderations show us the impossibility that our senses can ever 
reveal to us the true nature and essence of the material world. 
In our intercourse with external nature it is always our own 
sensations that we become acquainted with, and from them we 
form conceptions of the properties of external objects, which 
may be relatively correct; but we can never submit the nature 
of the objects themselves to that immediate perception to 
which the states of the different parts of our own body are sub- 
jected in the sensorium. 
VI. The nerve of each sense seems to be capable of one deter- 
minate kind of sensation only, and not of those proper to the other 
organs of sense; hence one nerve of sense cannot take the place and 
perform the function of the nerve of another sense. 
The sensation of each organ of sense may be increased in 
intensity till it become pleasurable, or till it becomes disagree- 
able, without the specific nature of the sensation being altered, 
or converted into that of another organ of sense. The sensation 
of dazzling light is an unpleasant sensation of the organ of vi- 
sion; harmony of colours, an agreeable one. Harmonious and 
discordant sounds are agreeable and disagreeable sensations of 
the organ of hearing. The organs of taste and smell have their 
pleasant and unpleasant tastes and odours; the organ of touch 
its pleasurable and painful feelings. It appears, therefore, that, 
even in themost excited condition of an organ of sense, the sens- 
ation preserves its specific character. It is an admitted fact 
that the sensations of light, sound, taste, and odours, can be 
experienced only in their respective nerves; but in the case of 
common sensation this is not so evidently the case, for it is a 
question whether the sensation of pain may not be felt in the 
nerves of the higher senses, — whether, for example, violent 
irritation of the optic nerve may not give rise to the sensation 
of pain. This question is difficult of solution. There are fila- 
ments of the nerves of common sensation distributed in the 
nerves of the other organs of sense: the nostrils are supplied 
with nerves of common sensation from the second division of 
the nervus trigeminus in addition to the olfactory nerves; the 
tongue has common sensibility as well as taste, and may retain
-P-A-G-E-564
  542 JOHANNES MUELLER 
the one while it loses the other; the eye and organ of hearing 
likewise are similarly endowed. 
To determine this question, it is necessary to institute experi- 
ments on the isolated nerves of special sense themselves. As far 
as such experiments have hitherto gone, they favour the view 
that the nerves of sense are susceptible of no other kind of sen- 
sation than that peculiar to each, and are not endowed with 
the faculty of common sensibility. 
Among the well-attested facts of physiology, again, there is 
not one to support the belief that one nerve of sense can assume 
the functions of another. The exaggeration of the sense of 
touch in the blind will not in these days be called seeing with the 
fingers; the accounts of the power of vision by the fingers and 
epigastrium, said to be possessed in the so-called magnetic 
state, appear to be mere fables, and the instances in which it has 
been pretended to practise it, cases of deception. The nerves of 
touch are capable of no other sensation than that of touch or 
feeling. Hence, also, no sounds can be heard except by the 
auditory nerve; the vibrations of bodies are perceived by the 
nerves of touch as mere tremours wholly different in its nature 
from sound; though it is indeed even now not rare for the differ- 
ent modes of action of the vibrations of bodies upon the sense 
of hearing, and upon that of feeling, to be confounded. With- 
out the organ of hearing with its vital endowments, there would 
be no such a thing as sound in the world, but merely vibrations; 
without the organ of sight, there would be no light, colour, nor 
darkness, but merely a corresponding presence or absence of 
the oscillations of the imponderable matter of light. 
VII. It is not known whether the essential cause of the peculiar 
“energy” of each nerve of sense is seated in the nerve ilself, or in the 
parts of the brain and spinal cord with which it is connected; but it 
is certain that the central portions of the nerves included in the 
encephalon are susceptible of their peculiar sensations, inde- 
pendently of the more peripheral portion of the nervous cords 
which form the means of communication with the external organs 
of sense.
-P-A-G-E-565
  ELEMENTS OF PHYSIOLOGY 543 
The specific sensibility of the individual senses to particular 
stimuli, — owing to which vibrations of such rapidity or length 
as to produce sound are perceived, only by the senses of hearing 
and touch, and mere mechanical influences, scarcely at all by 
the sense of taste, — must be a property of the nerves them- 
selves; but the peculiar mode of reaction of each sense, after the 
excitement of its nerve, may be due to either of two conditions. 
Either the nerves themselves may communicate impressions 
different in quality to the sensorium, which in every instance 
remains the same; or the vibrations of the nervous principle 
may in every nerve be the same and yet give rise to the percep- 
tion of different sensations in the sensorium, owing to the parts 
of the latter with which the nerves are connected having differ- 
ent properties. 
The proof of either of these propositions I regard as at 
present impossible. : 
VIII. The immediate objects of the perception of our senses are 
merely particular states induced in the nerves, and felt as sensa- 
tions either by the nerves themselves or by the sensorium; but inas- 
much as the nerves of the senses are material bodies, and therefore 
participate in the properties of matler generally occupying space, 
being susceptible of vibratory motion, and capable of being changed 
chemically as well as by the action of heat and electricity, they 
make known to the sensorium, by virtue of the changes thus produced 
in them by external causes, not merely their own condition, but also 
properties and changes of condition of external bodies. The in- 
formation thus obtained by the senses concerning external nature, 
varies in each sense, having a relation to the qualities or energies of 
the nerve. 
Qualities which are to be regarded rather as sensations or 
modes of reaction of the nerves of sense, are light, colour, the 
bitter and sweet tastes, pleasant and unpleasant odours, pain- 
ful and pleasant impressions on the nerves of touch, cold and 
warmth: properties which may belong wholly to external na- 
ture are ‘‘extension,” progressive and tremulous motion, and 
chemical change. 
All the senses are not equally adapted to impart the idea of  
-P-A-G-E-566
  544 JOHANNES MUELLER 
“extension” to the sensorium. The nerve of vision and the 
nerve of touch, being capable of an exact perception of this 
property in themselves, make us acquainted with it in external 
bodies. In the nerves of taste, the sensation of extension is less 
distinct, but is not altogether deficient; thus we are capable of 
_ distinguishing whether the seat of a bitter or sweet taste be the 
tongue, the palate, or the fauces. In the sense of touch and 
sight, however, the perception of space ismost acute. The retina 
of the optic nerve has a structure especially adapted for this 
perception; for the ends of the nervous fibres in the retina are, 
as Treviranus discovered, so arranged as to be at last perpen- 
dicular to its inner surface, and by their papillar extremities 
form a pavement-like composite membrane. On the great num- 
ber of these terminal fibrils depends the delicate power of dis- 
criminating the position of bodies in space possessed by the 
sense of vision; for each fibre represents a greater or less field of 
the visible world, and imparts the impression of it to the sens- 
orium. 
The sense of touch has a much more extended sphere of ac- 
- tion for the perception of space than has the sense of vision; but 
its perception of this quality of external bodies is much less ac- 
curate; and considerable portions of the surface of the body or 
skin are in many instances represented in the sensorium by 
very few nervous fibres; hence, in many parts of the surface, 
impressions on two points considerably removed from each 
other are, as E. H. Weber has shown, felt as one impression. 
Although the senses of vision, touch, and taste are all capable 
of perceiving the property of extension in space, yet the quality 
of the sensations which give the conception of extension is 
different in each of these senses; the sensation in one is an image 
of which the essential quality is light; in another, a perception 
of extension with any of the modifications of the quality of 
touch, between pain, cold, heat, and pleasure; in the third, a 
perception of extension with the quality of taste.

CHAPTER IV. THE THEORY OF LOCAL SIGNS 
§ 27. Metaphysic raises the doubt, whether space is actually 
extended and we, together with ‘Things,’ are contained in it; 
whether — just the reverse — the whole spatial world is not 
rather only a form of intuition in us. 
This question we for the present leave one side, and in the 
meantime take our point of departure from the assumption, pre- 
viously alluded to, with which we are all conversant. But since 
Things in space can never become the object of our perception 
by virtue of their bare existence, and, on the contrary, become 
such solely through the effects which they exercise upon us, the 
question arises: How do the Things by their influence upon us 
bring it to pass, that we are compelled mentally to represent 
them in the same reciprocal position in space, in which they 
actually exist outside of us? 
§ 28. In the case of the eye, nature has devised a painstaking 
structure, such that the rays of light which come from a lumin- 
ous point are collected again at one point on the retina, and 
that the different points of the image, which originate here, as- 
sume the same reciprocal relation toward one another as the

points of the object outside of us, to which they correspond. 
Without doubt, this so-called ‘image of the object,’ so care- 
fully prepared, is an indispensable condition of our being able 
mentally to present the object in its true form and position. 
But it is the source of all the errors in this matter to believe 
that the bare existence of this image, without anything else, 
explains our idea of the position of its parts. The entire image 
is essentially nothing but a representative of the external ob- 
ject, transposed into the interior of the organ of sense; and how 
we know and experience aught of it, is now just as much the 
question as the question previously was, — How can we per- 
ceive the external object? 
§ 29. If one wished to conceive of the soul itself as an ex- 
tended being, then the impressions on the retina would, of 
course, be able to transplant themselves, with all their geo- 
metrical regularity, to the soul. One point of the soul would be 
excited as green, the other red, a third yellow; and these three 
would lie at the corners of a triangle precisely in the same way 
as the three corresponding excitations on the retina. 
, It is also obvious, however, that there is no real gain in all 
- this. The bare fact that three different points of the soul are 
excited is, primarily, a disconnected three-fold fact. A know- 
ledge thereof, however, and therefore a knowledge of this three- 
foldness, and of the reciprocal positions of the three points, is, 
nevertheless, by no means given in this way: but such know- 
ledge could be brought about only by means of a uniting and 
relating activity; and this itself, like every activity, would be 
perfectly foreign to all predicates of extension and magnitudes 
in space. 
§ 30. The same thought is more immediately obvious if we 
surrender this useless notion of the soul being extended, and 
consider it as a supersensible essence, which, in case we wish to 
bring it at all into connection with spatial determinations, 
could be represented only as an indivisible point. 
On making the transition into this indivisible point, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-569
  OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 547 
manifold impressions must obviously lose all the geometrical 
relations which they might still have upon the extended retina, 
— just in the same way as the rays of light, which converge at 
the single focus of a lens, are not side by side with one another, 
but only all together, in this point. Beyond the focus, the rays 
diverge in the same order as that in which they entered it. No- 
thing analogous to this, however, happens in our consciousness; 
that is to say, the many impressions, which were previously 
side by side with one another, do not actually again separate 
from each other; but, instead of this, the aforesaid activity of 
mental presentation simply occurs, and it transposes their 
images to different places in the space that is only ‘intuited’ 
by it. 
Here, too, the previous observation holds good: The mental 
presentation is not that which it presents; and the idea of a 
point on the left does not lie on the left of the idea of a point on 
the right; but of one mental presentation, which in itself has no 
spatial properties whatever, both points are merely themselves 
so presented before the mind, as though one lay to the left, the 
other to the right. 
§ 31. The following result now stands before us: Many im- — 
pressions exist conjointly in the soul, although not spatially 
side by side with one another; but they are merely together in 
the same way as the synchronous tones of a chord; that is to 
say, qualitatively different, but not side by side with, above 
or below, one another. Notwithstanding, the mental presenta- 
tion of a spatial order must be produced again from these 
impressions. The question is, therefore, in the first place, to be 
raised: How in general does the soul come to apprehend these 
impressions, not in the form in which they actually are, —to 
wit, non-spatial, — but as they are not, in a spatial juxta- 
position? 
The satisfactory reason obviously cannot lie in the impres- 
sions themselves, but must lie solely in the nature of the soul in 
which they appear, and upon which they themselves act sim- 
ply as stimuli.
-P-A-G-E-570
    548 RUDOLPH HERMANN LOTZE 
On this account, it is customary to ascribe to the soul this 
tendency to form an intuition of space, as an originally inborn 
capacity. And indeed we are compelled to rest satisfied with 
this. All the ‘deductions’ of space, hitherto attempted, which 
have tried to show on what ground it is necessary to the nature 
of the soul to develop this intuition of space, have utterly 
failed of success. Nor is there any reason to complain over this 
matter; for the simplest modes of the experience of the soul 
must always merely be recognized as given facts, — just as, for 
example, no one seriously asks why we only hear, and do not 
rather taste, the waves of air. 
§ 32. The second question is much more important. Let it 
be assumed that the soul once for all lies under the necessity of 
mentally presenting a certain manifold as in juxtaposition in 
space; How does it come to localize every individual impression 
at a definite place in the space intuited by it, in such manner 
that the entire image thus intuited is similar to the external 
object which acted on the eye? 
Obviously, such a clue must lie in the impressions them- 
selves. The simple quality of the sensation ‘green’ or ‘red’ does 
not, however, contain it; for every such color can in turn ap- 
pear at every point in space, and on this account does not, of 
itself, require always to be referred to the one definite point. 
We now remind ourselves, however, that the carefulness with 
which the regular position on the retina of the particular excita- 
tions is secured, cannot be without a purpose. To be sure, an 
impression is not seen at a definite point on account of its being 
situated at such point; but it may perhaps by means of this 
definite situation act on the soul otherwise than if it were else- 
where situated. 
Accordingly we conceive of this in the following way: Every 
impression of color r— for example, red — produces on all 
places of the retina, which it reaches, the same sensation of red- 
ness. In addition to this, however, it produces on each of these 
different places, a, b, c, a certain accessory impression, a, 8, ¥, 
which is independent of the nature of the color seen, and de-
-P-A-G-E-571
  
OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 549 
pendent merely on the nature of the place excited. This second 
local impression would therefore be associated with every im- 
pression of color 7, in such manner that ra signifies a red that 
acts on the point a, 78 signifies the same red in case it acts on the 
point 6. These associated accessory impressions would, accord- 
ingly, render for the soul the clue, by following which it trans- 
poses the same red, now to one, now to another spot, or simul- 
taneously to different spots in the space intuited by it. 
In order, however, that this may take place in a methodical 
way, these accessory impressions must be completely different 
from the main impressions, the colors, and must not disturb 
the latter. They must be, however, not merely of the same 
kind among themselves, but wholly definite members of a 
series or a system of series; so that for every impression 7 
there may be assigned, by the aid of this adjoined ‘local sign,’ 
not merely a particular, but a quite definite spot among all the 
rest of the impressions. 
§ 33. The foregoing is the theory of ‘Local Signs.’ Their 
fundamental thought consists in this, that all spatial differ- 
ences and relations among the impressions on the retina must 
be compensated for by corresponding non-spatial and merely 
intensive relations among the impressions which exist together 
without space-form in the soul; and that from them in reverse 
order there must arise, not a new actual arrangement of these 
impressions in extension, but only the mental presentation of 
such an arrangement in us. To such an extent do we hold this 
principle to be a necessary one. 
On the contrary, only hypotheses are possible in order to 
answer the question, In what do those accessory impressions 
requisite consist, so far as the sense of sight is concerned? We 
propose the following conjecture: — 
In case a bright light falls upon a lateral part of the retina, 
on which — as is well known — the sensitiveness to impressions 
is more obtuse than in the middle of the retina, then there fol- 
lows a rotation of the eye until the most sensitive middle part 
of the retina, as the receptive organ, is brought beneath this
-P-A-G-E-572
  550 RUDOLPH HERMANN LOTZE 
light: we are accustomed to style this the “fixation of vision” 
upon the aforesaid light. Such motion happens involuntarily, 
without any original cognition of its purpose, and uniformly 
without cognition of the means by which it is brought about. 
We may therefore reckon it among the so-called reflex motions, 
which originate by means of an excitation of one nerve, that 
serves at other times for sensation, being transplanted to motor 
nerves without any further assistance from the soul and in ac- 
cordance with the pre-existing anatomical connections; and 
these latter nerves being therefore stimulated to execute a 
definite motion in a perfectly mechanical way. Now in order to 
execute such a rotation of the eye as serves the purpose previ- 
ously alluded to, every single spot in the retina, in case it is 
stimulated, must occasion a magnitude and direction of the 
aforesaid rotation peculiar to it alone. But at the same time all 
these rotations of the eye would be perfectly comparable mo- 
tions, and, of course, members of a system of series that are 
graded according to magnitude and direction. 
§ 34. The application of the foregoing hypothesis (many 
more minute particular questions being disregarded) we con- 
ceive of as follows: — In case a bright light falls upon a lateral 
point P of a retina, which has not yet had any sensation of light 
whatever, then there arises, in consequence of the connection in 
the excitation of the nerves, such a rotation of the eye as that, 
instead of the place P, the place E of clearest vision is brought 
beneath the approaching stimulus of the light. Now while the 
eye is passing through the arc PE, the soul receives at each 
instant a feeling of its momentary position, —a feeling of the 
same kind as that by which we are, when in the dark, informed 
of the position of our limbs. To the arc PE there corresponds 
then a series of constantly changing feelings of position, the 
first member of which we call 7, and the last of which we 
call e. 
If now, in a second instance, the place P is again stimulated 
by the light, then there originates not simply the rotation PE 
for a second time, but the initial member of the series of feeling
-P-A-G-E-573
ee ee ee 
OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 551 
of position 7, reproduces in memory the entire series associated 
with it, we; and this series of mental presentations is independ- 
ent of the fact that at the same time also the rotation of the eye 
PE actually follows. 
Exactly the same thing would hold good of another point R; 
only the arc RE, the series of feelings pe, and also the initial 
member of the series, p, would have other values. 
Now finally, in case it came about that both places, P and R, 
were simultaneously stimulated with an equal intensity, and 
that the arcs PE and RE were equal but in opposite directions 
to each other, then the actual rotation of the eye PE and RE 
could not take place; on the other hand, the excitation upon 
the places P and R is nevertheless not without effect; each pro- 
duces the series of feelings of position belonging to it, — re- 
spectively, ze and pe. Although therefore the eye does not now 
moye, yet there is connected with every excitation of the places 
P and R the mental presentation of the magnitude and of the 
qualitative peculiarity of a series of changes, which conscious- 
ness or the common feeling would have to experience, in order 
that these excitations may fall upon the place of clearest 
vision, or, according to the customary expression, in the line of 
vision. 
And now we assert that to see anything ‘to the right’ or ‘to 
the left’ of this line of vision means nothing more than this, to 
be conscious of the magnitude of the achievement which would 
be necessary to bring the object into this line. 
§ 35. By the foregoing considerations nothing further would 
be established than the relative position of the single colored 
points in the field of vision. The entire image, on the contrary, 
would still have no place at all in a yet larger space; indeed, 
even the mental presentation of such a place would as yet have 
no existence. 
Now this image first attains a place with reference to the eye, 
the repeated opening and closing of which, since it can become 
known to us in another way, is the condition of its existence or 
non-existence. That is to say, the visible world is in front before  
-P-A-G-E-574
  552 RUDOLPH HERMANN LOTZE 
our eyes. What is behind us not merely has no existence what- 
ever for us, but we do not once know that there is anything 
which should be called ‘behind.’ 
The motions of the body lead us further. If the field of vision 
in a position of rest contains from left to right the images a bc, 
and we then turn ourselves to the right upon our axis, a van- 
ishes, but d appears on the right, and therefore the image 
bcd, cde, def, . . . xyz, yza, zab, abc, succeed in order. As a 
result of such recurrence of the images with which we began, 
the two following thoughts originate; namely, that the visible 
world of objects exists in a closed circuit of extension about us, 
and that the alteration of our own position, which we perceive 
by means of the changing feelings of position while turning, 
depends upon an alteration of our relation to this immovable 
world of objects, — that is to say, upon a motion. 
It is easily understood that the mental picture of a spherical 
extension originates from the aforesaid mental picture of a 
closed horizon by means of repeatedly turning in a similar way 
in various other directions. 
§ 36. But, nevertheless, this spherical surface also would 
always have only a superficial extension no intimation would 
as yet exist of a depth to space. 
Now the mental presentation, to the effect that something 
like a third dimension of space in general exists, cannot origin- 
ate of itself, but only through the experience which we have in 
case we move about among the visible objects. From the mani- 
fold displacements which the particular visual images experi- 
ence, in a manner that is tedious to describe but very easy to 
imagine, we gain the impression, that each line in an image 
originally seen is the beginning of new surfaces which do not 
coincide with that previously seen, but which lead out into this 
space, now extended on all sides, to greater or less distances 
from the line. 
Another question to be treated subsequently is this: By what 
means do we estimate the different magnitudes of the distance 
into this depth of space?
-P-A-G-E-575
    OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 553 
§ 37. The crossing of the rays of light in the narrow opening 
of the pupil is the cause of the image of the upper points of the 
object being formed beneath, that of the lower points above on 
the retina; and of the whole picture having therefore a position 
the reverse of the object. But it is a prejudice on this account 
to consider seeing in inverse position to be natural, and seeing 
in upright position to be mysterious. Like every geometrical 
property of the image, so this one of its position, too, on passing 
into consciousness, is completely lost; and the position in which 
we see things is in no way prejudiced by the aforesaid position 
of the image on the retina. 
Now, however, in order that we may be able to ascribe to 
objects a position at all, in order therefore that the expressions 
‘above,’ ‘below,’ ‘upright,’ and ‘inverted,’ may have a mean- 
ing, we must have, independent of all sensation by sight, a men- 
tal picture of a space in which the entire content of the field of 
vision shall be arranged, and in which ‘above’ and ‘below’ are 
two qualitatively opposite and, on this account, not exchange- 
able directions. 
The muscular feeling affords us such a mental presentation. 
‘Below’ is the place toward which the direction of gravity 
moves; ‘above,’ the opposite. Both directions are distinguished 
perfectly for us by means of an immediate feeling; and, on this 
account, we are never deceived even in the dark about the posi- 
tion and situation of our body. 
Accordingly we see objects ‘upright’ in case the lower points 
of the object are reached by one and the same movement of the 
eyes simultaneously with those points of our own body which 
are ‘below’ according to the testimony of the aforesaid muscu- 
lar feeling; and the upper points by a movement which, accord- 
ing to the same testimony, renders visible simultaneously the 
upper parts of our own selves. 
Nowit is exactly such agreement that is secured in our eye, in 
which the axis lies in front of the sensitive retina, by means of 
the inverted position of the retinal image. In an other eye in 
which the sensitive surface should be placed in front of the axis, 
and yet the greatest sensitiveness also should appear in the
-P-A-G-E-576
554 RUDOLPH HERMANN LOTZE 
-middle portion of that surface, the retinal image would have to 
stand upright to serve the same purpose. 
§ 38. The final and valid answer to the question, why we 
have single vision with two eyes, is not to be given. As is well 
known, it does not always happen. The rather must two im- 
pressions fall on two quite definite points of the retina in order 
to coalesce. We see double, on the contrary, if they fall on 
other points. Naturally, we shall say: The two places which 
belong together would have to impart like local signs to their 
impressions, and thereby render them indistinguishable; but we 
are not able to demonstrate in what manner this postulate is 
fulfilled. Physiology, too, in the last analysis, satisfies itself 
with a mere term for the fact; it calls ‘identical’ those places in 
both retinas which give one simple impression, and ‘non- 
identical’ those which give a double impression. 
§ 39. Irritations of the skin we naturally refer at once to the 
place of the skin on which we see them acting. But in case of 
their repetition, when we are not able to see them, we have no 
assistance from remembering them; for the most ordinary 
stimuli have already in the course of our life touched all pos- 
sible places of the skin, and could therefore now as well be re- 
ferred to one place as to another. In order that they may be 
correctly localized, they would have at every instant to tell us 
anew where they belong; that is to say, there must be attached 
to the main impression (impact, pressure, heat or cold) an 
auxiliary impression which is independent of the latter and, on 
the contrary, dependent on the place of the skin that is 
irritated. 
The skin can supply such local signs; for since it is connected 
without interruption, a single point of it cannot be irritated at 
all, without the surrounding portion experiencing a displacement, 
pulling, stretching, or concussion of some kind. But, further, 
since the skin possesses at different places a different thickness, 
different tension or liability to displacement, — extends some- 
times above the firm surfaces of the bones, sometimes over the 
 
-P-A-G-E-577
    OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 555 
flesh of the muscles, sometimes over cavities; since, moreover, 
the members being manifold, these relations change from one 
stretch of skin to another; therefore the aforesaid sum of sec- 
ondary effects around the point irritated will be different for 
each one from the remainder; and such effects, if they are taken 
up by the nerve-endings and act on consciousness, may occa- 
sion the feelings so difficult to describe, according to which we 
distinguish a contact at one place from the same contact at 
another. 
It cannot be said, however, that each point of the skin has its 
special local sign. It is known from the investigations of E. H. 
Weber, that on the margin of the lips, the tip of the tongue, the 
tips of the fingers, being touched in two places (by the points of 
a pair of compasses) can be distinguished as two at an interval 
of only 4 line; while there are places on the arms, legs, and on 
the back, which require for making the distinction a distance 
between them of as much as 20 lines. We interpret this in the 
following way. Where the structure of the skin changes little 
for Jong stretches, the local signs also alter only a little from 
point to point. And if two stimuli act simultaneously, and 
accordingly a reciprocal disturbance of these secondary effects 
occurs, they will be undistinguishable; on the contrary, in cases 
where both stimuli act successively, and therefore the aforesaid 
disturbance ceases, both are still frequently distinguishable. 
On the other hand, we know nothing further to allege as to how 
the extraordinary sensitiveness — for example — of the lips is 
occasioned. 
§ 40. The preceding statement merely explains the possibil- 
ity of distinguishing impressions made at different places; but 
each impression must also be referred to the definite place at 
which it acts. 
This is easy for one who sees, since he already possesses a pic- 
ture of the surface of his own body; and, on this account, he 
now by means of the unchanging local sign, even in the dark, 
translates each stimulus which he has once seen act on a definite 
place, to the same place in this picture of the body that is men-

tally presented before him. One born blind would be com- 
pelled to construct such a picture first by means of the sense of 
touch; and this naturally is accomplished through motions of 
the tactual members and by estimating the distances which 
they would have to travel in order to reach from contact at the 
point @ to contact at the other point 5. It is to be considered, 
however that these motions — which in this case are not seen— 
are perceivable only by so-called muscular feelings; — that is 
to say by feelings which in themselves are merely certain 
species of the way we feel, and do not of themselves at all 
indicate the motions which are in fact the causes of them. 
Now it cannot be described, how it is that this interpretation 
of the muscular feelings actually originates in the case of those 
born blind; but the helps which lead to it are very probably 
found in the fact, that the sense of touch as well as the eye can 
receive many impressions simultaneously, and that, in case of a 
movement, the previous impression does not vanish without 
trace and have its place taken by a wholly new one; but that, in 
the manner previously alleged, the combinations abc, bcd, etc., 
follow one another, and therefore some part in common is 
always left over for the next two impressions. By this alone 
does it seem possible to awaken the idea that the same occur- 
rence, from which the series of changeable muscular feelings 
originates for us, consists in an alteration of our relation to a 
series of objects previously existent side by side and to be found 
arranged in a definite order; it consists, therefore, in a motion. 
§ 41. It is questionable whether the mental picture of space 
which one born blind attains solely by the sense of touch will be 
altogether like that of one who sees; it is rather to be assumed 
that a much less intuitable system of mental presentations of 
time, of the magnitude of motion, and of the exertion which is 
needed in order to reach from contact at one point to that at 
another, takes the place of the clear, easy, and at once all-com- 
prehending intuition, with which he who sees is endowed.

WEBER’S LAW + 
CONCERNING THE SMALLEST PERCEPTIBLE DIFFERENCES OF 
WEIGHTS WHICH WE CAN DISTINGUISH BY THE SENSE OF 
Toucu, OF THE LENGTH OF LINES WHICH WE CAN DIsTIN- 
GUISH BY SIGHT, AND OF TONES WHICH WE CAN DISTINGUISH 
BY HEARING 
TuE smallest perceptible difference between two weights, 
which we can distinguish by the feeling of muscular exertion, 
appears according to my experiments to be that between 
weights which stand approximately in the relation of 39 to 4o: 
that is to say, of which one is about 1-40 heavier than the 
other. By means of the feeling of pressure, which two weights 
make upon our skin, all we are able to distinguish is a differ- 
ence of weight that amounts to only 1-30, so that the weights 
accordingly stand in the relation of 29 to 30.

der Physiologie, Braunschweig, 1846, iii, 2; [separately,] Leipzig, 1849; ib., 1851; 
ib., 1905. 
t The first formulation of what is known as Weber’s Law was made by Weber 
in 1834 in a monograph entitled De tactu. It reads as follows: 
“Tn comparing objects and observing the distinction between them, we per- 
ceive not the difference between the objects, but the ratio of this difference to the 
magnitude of the objects compared. If we are comparing by touch two weights, 
the one of 3o and the cther of 29 half-ounces, the difference is not more easily 
perceived than that between weights of 30 and 29 drachms. . . . Since the dis-
-P-A-G-E-580
  558° ERNST HEINRICH WEBER 
If we look at one line after another, any one who possesses a 
very exceptional visual discrimination can according to my 
experiments discover a difference between two lines whose 
lengths are related as 50:51, or even aS 100:101. Those who 
have a less delicate visual discrimination distinguish lines, 
which are separated from one another by 1-25 of their length. 
The smallest perceptible difference of the pitch of two tones, 
(which are really in unison), that a musician perceives, if he 
hears two tones successively, is according to Delezenne! 1-4 
Komma (81-80) 1-4. A lover of music according to him distin- 
guishes only about 1-2 Komma (81-80) 1-2. If the tones are 
heard simultaneously we cannot, according to Delezenne’s 
experiments, perceive such small tonal differences. 1-4 Komma 
is nearly the relation of 321 :322, but 1-2 Komma is nearly the 
relation of 160: 161. 
tinction is not perceived more easily in the former case than in the latter, it is 
clear that not the weights of the differences but their ratios are perceived. . . . 
Experience has taught us that apt and practised o’s sense the difference be- 
tween weights, if it is not less than the thirtieth part of the heavier weight, and 
that the same o’s perceive the difference not less easily, if drachms are put in the 
place of half-ounces. 
“ That which I have set forth with regard to weights compared by touch holds 
also of lines to be compared by sight. .For, whether you compare longer or shorter 
lines, you will find that the difference is not sensed by most 0’s if the second line 
is less by a hundredth part. . . . The length in which the distinction resides, 
therefore, although [in the case of lines of 50 and 50.5 mm.] it is twice as small 
[as it is in the case of lines of roo and 101 mm.], is nevertheless no less easily 
apprehended, for the reason that in both cases the difference of the compared 
lines is one hundredth of the longer line. 
“T have made no experiments upon comparison of tones by the ear. [Dele- 
zenne, however, determined the j. n. d. of the b of 240 vs.] As this author does 
not say that this difference is discriminated less easily in deeper, more easily in 
higher tones, and as I have never heard that a difference is more easily perceived 
in higher tones, . . . I imagine that in audition also not the absolute difference 
between the vibrations of two tones, but the relative compared with the number 
of vibrations of the tones is discriminated. 
“ The observation, confirmed in several departments of sense, that in ob- 
serving the distinction between objects we perceive not the absolute but the rela- 
tive differences, has again and again impelled me to investigate the cause of this 
phenomenon; and I hope that when this cause is sufficiently understood, we shall 
be able to judge more correctly regarding the nature of the senses ” (172 ff.).

  THE SENSE OF TOUCH 559 
I have shown that the result in the determinations of weight 
is the same, whether one takes ounces or half ounces; for it 
does not depend upon the number of grains that form the 
increment of weight, but depends on the fact that this incre- 
ment makes up the thirtieth or fiftieth [should be fortieth] part 
of the weight which we are comparing with the second weight. 
This likewise holds true of the comparison of the length of two 
lines and of the pitch of two tones. It makes no difference 
whether we compare lines that are, say, two inches or one inch 
long, if we examine them successively, and can see them lying 
parallel to each other; and yet the extent by which the one line 
exceeds the other is in the former case twice as great as in the 
latter. To be sure, if both lines lie close together and parallel, 
we compare only the ends of the lines to discover how much 
the one line exceeds the other; and in this test the question is 
only how great that length of line which overlaps the other 
really is, and how near the two lines lie to one another. 
So too in the comparison of the pitch of two tones, it does 
not matter whether the two tones are seven tonal stops [i.e. an 
octave] higher or lower, provided only they do not lie at the end 
of the tonal series, where the exact discrimination of small 
tonal differences becomes more difficult. Here again, therefore, 
it is not a question of the number of vibrations, by which the 
one tone exceeds the other, but of the relation of the numbers of 
the vibrations of the two tones which we are comparing. If we 
counted the vibrations of the two tones it would be conceivable, 
that we should pay attention only to the number of vibrations 
by which one tone exceeds the other. If we fix the eyes first 
upon one line and afterwards upon a second, and_ thus permit 
both to be pictured successively upon the most sensitive parts 
of the retina, we should be inclined to suppose, that we com- 
pared the traces of the impression which the first image left, 
with the impression which the second image made upon the 
same parts of the retina, and that we thereby perceived how 
much the second image exceeds the first, and conversely. For 
this is the way we compare two scale-units: we place one upon 
the other, so that they coincide, and thus perceive how much 
 
-P-A-G-E-582
  560 ERNST HEINRICH WEBER 
the one exceeds the other. From the fact, that we do not em- 
ploy this method which is so very advantageous, it seems to 
follow, that we are unable to employ it, and that therefore the 
preceding impression left behind no such trace upon the retina, 
or in the brain, as would permit of comparison in the manner 
mentioned with succeeding impressions. That it is possible 
for us to proceed otherwise in the comparison of the length of 
two lines appears from the fact, that we can compare two lines, 
which are longer than we can picture at once in their en- 
tirety on the most sensitive part of the retina. In this case we 
must move the eye and thereby cause the different parts of the 
same line to be pictured successively upon the same parts of the 
retina. Under these circumstances we must take account of 
the movement of the eye, and only thus do we form an idea of 
the length of the lines. Were the impressions of visible things, 
which we preserve in memory, traces, which the sensuous 
impressions left behind in the brain, and whose spatial relations 
corresponded to the spatial relations of the sensuous impres- 
sions, and were thus so to speak photographs of the same, it 
would be difficult to remember a figure, which is larger than 
could be pictured at once wholly upon the sensitive part of the 
retina. It appears to me, indeed, as if a figure, which we can 
survey at a single glance, impressed itself better upon our 
memory and our imagination, than a figure, which we can 
survey only successively by moving the eyes; but we can never- 
theless represent also the former by means of the imagination. 
But in this case the representation of the whole figure seems to 
be composed by us of the parts which we perceive all at once. 
If we compare two lines, which are 20and 21 Linien |i.e. 1-10 
of an inch] long, the latter is 1-20 longer, but the absolute dif- 
ference of length amounts to 1 Linie. If, on the other hand, we 
compare two lines, which are 1 Linie and 1.05 Linie long, 
the difference amounts also to 1-20, but the line is only 1-20 
longer than the other. Consequently in the latter case the abso- 
lute difference is 20 times smaller. But 1-20 Linie is a size like 
a fine pinhole which lies at the very threshold of vision. The 
smallest possible point that we are able to see, is one whose di-
-P-A-G-E-583
THE SENSE OF TOUCH 561 
ameter amounts to 1-20 Linie, and yet one who has a very 
good visual discrimination can distinguish in respect to their 
length two lines of which one is 1-20 Linie longer than the other. 
Two observers, before whom I placed such lines, both distin- 
guished the longer from the shorter, and their visual discrimi- 
nation extended even farther. I myself distinguished two lines, 
whose relative difference of length amounted to 1-20, and of 
which the one was between 1-17 and 1-18 longer than the 
other. The apprehension of the relations of whole magnitudes, 
without our having measured the magnitudes by a smaller 
scale-unit, and without our having ascertained the absolute dif- 
ference between them, is a most interesting psychological phe- 
nomenon. In music we apprehend the relations of tone, without 
knowing their rate of vibration [i.e., their absolute pitch]; in 
architecture, the relation of spatial magnitudes, without hav- 
ing determined them by inches; and in the same way we ap- 
prehend the magnitudes of sensation or of force in the com- 
parison of weights.

VII. THE MEASUREMENT OF SENSATION 
WesER’s law, that equal relative increments of stimuli are 
proportional to equal increments of sensation, is, in considera- 
tion of its generality and the wide limits within which it is abso- 
Jutely or approximately valid, to be considered fundamental 
for psychic measurement. There are, however, limits to its 
validity as well as complications, which we shall have carefully 
to examine later. Yet even where this law ceases to be valid or 
absolute, the principle of psychic measurement continues to 
hold, inasmuch as any other relation between constant incre- 
ments of sensation and variable increments of stimulus, even 
though it is arrived at empirically and expressed by an empir- 
ical formula, may serve equally well as the fundamental basis for 
psychic measurement, and indeed must serve as such in those 
parts of the stimulus scale where Weber’s law loses its validity. 
In fact such a law, as well as Weber’s law, will furnish a differ- 
ential formula from which may be derived an integral formula 
containing an expression for the measurement of sensation. 
This is a fundamental point of view, in which Weber’s law, 
with its limitations, appears, not as limiting the application of 
psychic measurement, but as restricted in its own application 
toward that end and beyond which application the general

Aufl. 1889.

ELEMENTS OF PSYCHOPHYSICS 563 
principle of psychic measurement nevertheless continues to hold. 
It is not that the principle depends for its validity upon 
Weber’s law, but merely that the application of the law is 
involved in the principle. 
Accordingly investigation in the interest of the greatest 
possible generalization of psychic measurement has not essen- 
tially to commence with the greatest possible generalization of 
Weber’s law, which might easily produce the questionable in- 
clination to generalize the law beyond its natural limitation, or 
which might call forth the objection that the law was general- 
ized beyond these limits solely in the interest of psychic meas- 
urement; but rather it may quite freely be asked how far 
Weber’s law is applicable, and how far not; for the three 
methods which are used in psychic measurement are applicable 
even when Weber’s law is not, and where these methods are 
applicable psychic measurement is possible. 
In short, Weber’s law forms merely the basis for the most 
numerous and important applications of psychic measurement, 
but not the universal and essential one. The most general 
and more fundamental basis for psychic measurement is rather 
those methods by which the relation between stimulus incre- 
ments and sensation increment in general is determined, 
within, as well as without, the limits of Weber’s Jaw; and the 
development of these methods towards ever greater precision 
and perfection is the most important consideration in regard 
to psychic measurement. 
And yet a great advantage would be lost, if so simple a law as 
Weber’s law could not be used as an exact or at least suffi- 
ciently approximate basis for psychic measurement; just such 
an advantage as would be lost if we could not use the Kepler 
law in astronomy, or the laws of simple refraction in the theory 
of the dioptric instruments. Now there is just the same diffi- 
culty with these laws as with Weber’s law. In the case of 
Kepler’s law we abstract from deviations. In the case of simple 
lens refraction’ we abstract from optical aberration. In fact 
they may become invalid as soon as the simple hypotheses for 
which they are true no longer exist. Yet they will always re-

main decisive for the principle relation with which astronomy 
and dioptrics are concerned. Weber’s law may in like manner, 
entirely lose its validity, assoon as the average or normal condi- 
tions under which the stimulus produces the sensation are un- 
realized. It will always, however, be decisive for these particu- 
lar conditions. 
Further, just as in physics and astronomy, so can we also 
in psychic measurement, neglect at first the irregularities and 
small departures from the law in order to discover and examine 
the principle relations with which the science has to do. The 
existence of these exceptions must not, however, be forgotten, 
inasmuch as the finer development and further progress of the 
science depends upon the determination and calculation of 
them, as soon as the possibility of doing so is given. 
The determination of psychic measurement is a matter for 
outer psychophysics and its first applications lie within its 
boundary; its further applications and consequences, however, 
extend necessarily into the domain of inner psychophysics and 
its deeper meaning lies there. It must be remembered that the 
stimulus does not cause sensation directly, but rather through 
the assistance of bodily processes with which it stands in more 
direct connection. The dependence, quantitatively considered 
of sensation on stimulus, must finally be translated into one of 
sensation on the bodily processes which directly underlie the 
sensation — in short the psycho-physical processes; and the 
sensation, instead of being measured by the amount of the 
stimulus, will be measured by the intensity of these processes. 
In order to do this, the relation of the inner process to the stim- 
ulus must be known. Inasmuch as this is not a matter of direct 
experience it must be deduced by some exact method. Indeed 
it is possible for this entire investigation to proceed along ex- 
act lines, and it cannot fail at some time or other to obtain 
the success of a critical study, if one has not already reached 
that goal. 
Although Weber’s law, as applied to the relation of stimulus 
to sensation, shows only a limited validity in the domain of 
outer psychophysics, it has, as applied to the relation of sensa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-587
  ELEMENTS OF PSYCHOPHYSICS 565 
tion to kinetic energy, or as referred to some other function of 
the psycho-physical process, in all probability an unlimited 
validity in the domain of inner psychophysics, in that all excep- 
tions to the law which we find in the arousal of sensation by 
external stimulus, are probably due tothe fact that the stimu- 
lus only under normal or average conditions engenders a kinetic 
energy in those inner processes proportional to its own amount. 
From this it may be foreseen, that this law, after it has been 
restated as a relation between sensation and the psycho- 
physical processes, will be as important, general, and funda- 
mental for the relations of mind to body, as is the law of gravity 
for the field of planetary motion. Andit also has that simplicity 
which we are accustomed to find in fundamental laws of 
nature. 
Although, then, psychic measurement depends upon 
Weber’s law only within certain limitations in the domain of 
outer psycho-physics, it may well get its unconditional support 
from this law in the field of inner psychophysics. These are 
nevertheless for the present merely opinions and expectations, 
the verification of which lies in the future. 
XIV. THE FUNDAMENTAL FORMULA AND THE 
MEASUREMENT FORMULA 
Although not as yet having a measurement for sensation, still 
one can combine in an exact formula the relation expressed in 
Weber’s law, — that the sensation difference remains constant 
when the relative stimulus difference remains constant, — with 
the law, established by the mathematical auxiliary principle, 
that small sensation increments are proportional to stimu- 
lus increments. Let us suppose, as has generally been done in 
the attempts to preserve Weber’s law, that the difference be- 
tween two stimuli, or, what is the same, the increase in one 
stimulus, is very small in proportion to the stimulus itself. Let 
the stimulus which is increased be called 8, the small increase 
df, where the letter d is to be considered not as a special mag- 
nitude, but simply as a sign that df is the small increment of 
 
-P-A-G-E-588
  566 | GUSTAV THEODOR FECHNER 
8. This already suggests the differential sign. The relative 
stimulus increase therefore is ee On the other hand, let the 
sensation which is dependent upon the stimulus 8 be called 
y, and let the small iricrement of the sensation which results 
from the increase of the stimulus by df be called dy, where 
d again simply expresses the small increment. The terms d8 
and dy are each to be considered as referring to an arbitrary 
unit of their own nature. 
According to the empirical Weber’s law, dy remains constant 
8B . 
when Z remains constant, no matter what absolute values 
d§ and B take; and according to the a priori mathematical 
auxiliary principle the changes dy and d8 remain propor- 
tional to one another so long as they remain very small. The two 
relations may be expressed together in the following equation: 
KgB Dera a 1) 
where « is a constant (dependent upon the units selected for y 
and 8). In fact, if one multiplies 8d and 8 by any number, so 
long as it is the same number for both, the proportion remains 
constant, and with it also the sensation difference dy. This is 
Weber’s law. If one doubles or triples the value of the variation 
df without changing the initial value 8, then the value of the 
change dy is also doubled or tripled. This is the mathematical 
principle. The equation aye therefore entirely satisfies 
both Weber’s law and this principle; and no other equation 
satisfies both together. This is to be called the fundamental 
formula, in that the deduction of all consequent formulas will 
be based upon it. 
The fundamental formula does not presuppose the measure- 
ment of sensation, nor does it establish any; it simply expresses 
the relation holding between small relative stimulus incre- 
ments and sensation increments. In short, it is nothing more 
than Weber’s law and the mathematical auxiliary principle 
united and expressed in mathematical symbols.
-P-A-G-E-589
  ELEMENTS OF PSYCHOPHYSICS 567 
There is, however, another formula connected with this 
formula by infinitesimal calculus, which expresses a general 
quantitative relation between the stimulus magnitude as a 
summation of stimulus increments, and the sensation magni- 
tude as a summation of sensation increments, in such a way, 
that with the validity of the first formula, together with the 
assumption of the fact of limen, the validity of this latter 
formula is also given. 
Reserving for the future a more exact deduction, I shall 
attempt first to make clear in a general way the connection of 
the two formulas. 
One can readily see, that the relation between the increments 
dy and din the fundamental formula corresponds to the rela- 
tion between the increments of a logarithm and the increments 
of the corresponding number. For as one can easily convince 
oneself, either from theory or from the table, the logarithm 
does not increase by equal increments when the corresponding 
number increases by equal increments, but rather when the 
latter increases by equal relative amounts; in other words, the 
increases in the logarithms remain equal, when the relative in- 
creases of the numbers remain equal. Thus, for example, the 
following numbers and logarithms belong together: 
Number. Logarithm. 
IO 1.000000 
II I.0413927 
100 2.000000 
IIo 2.0413927 
1000 3.000000 
II00 3.0413927 
where an increase of the number 10 by 1 brings with it just as 
great an increase in the corresponding logarithm, as the increase 
of the number 100 by 10 or 1000 by too. In each instance the 
increase in the logarithm is 0.0413927. Further, as was already 
shown in explaining the mathematical auxiliary principle, the 
increases in the logarithms are proportional to the increases of
-P-A-G-E-590
  568 GUSTAV THEODOR FECHNER 
the numbers, so long as they remain very small. Therefore one 
can say, that Weber’s law and the mathematical auxiliary prin- 
ciple are just as valid for the increases of logarithms and num- 
bers in their relation to one another, as they are for the increases 
of sensation and stimulus. 
The fact of the threshold appears just as much in the relation 
of a logarithm to its number as in the relation of sensation to 
stimulus. The sensation begins with values above zero, not 
with zero, but with a finite value of the stimulus — the thres- 
hold; and so does the logarithm begin with values above zero, 
not with a zero value of the number, but with a finite value of 
the number, the value 1, inasmuch as the logarithm of 1 is 
equal to zero. 
If now, as was shown above, the increase of sensation and 
stimulus stands in a relation similar to that of the increase of 
logarithm and number, and, the point at which the sensation 
begins to assume a noticeable value stands in a relation to the 
stimulus similar to that which the point at which the logarithm 
attains positive value stands to the number, then one may 
also expect that sensation and stimulus themselves stand in a 
relation to one another similar to that of logarithm to number, 
which, just as the former (sensation and stimulus) may be 
regarded as made up of a sum of successive increments. 
Accordingly the simplest relation between the two that we 
can write is y = log £. 
In fact it will soon be shown that, provided suitable units of 
sensation and stimulus are chosen, the functional relation 
between both reduces to this very simple formula. Meanwhile 
it is not the most genera] formula that can be derived, but one 
which is only valid under the supposition of particular units of 
sensation and stimulus, and we still need a direct and absolute 
deduction instead of the indirect and approximate one. 
The specialist sees at once how this may be attained, namely, 
by treating the fundamental formula as a differential formula 
and integrating it. In the following chapter one will find this 
done. Here it must be supposed already carried out, and those 
who are not able to follow the simple infinitesimal deduction,
-P-A-G-E-591
  
ELEMENTS OF PSYCHOPHYSICS 569 
‘must be asked to consider the result as a mathematical fact. 
This result is the following functional formula between stimu- 
lus and sensation, which goes by the name of the measurement 
formula and which will now be further discussed: 
y= (log B—logb) —(’) 
In this formula « again stands for a constant, dependent upon 
the unit selected and also the logarithmic system, and 6 a second 
constant which stands for the threshold value of the stimulus, 
at which the sensation y begins and disappears. 
According to the rule, that the logarithm of a quotient of two 
numbers may be substituted for the difference of their logar- 
ithms, . . . one can substitute for the above form of the meas- 
urement formula the following, which is more convenient for 
making deductions. B 
y= « log DB ©) 
From this equation it follows that the sensation magnitude 4 
is not to be considered as a simple function of the stimulus 
value 8, but of its relation to the threshold value 0, where the 
sensation begins and disappears. This relative stimulus value, 
Bis for the future to be called the fundamental stimulus value, 
or the fundamental value of the stimulus. 
Translated in words, the measurement formula reads: 
The magnitude of the sensation (ry) is not proportional to the 
absolute value of the stimulus (8), but rather to the logarithm of 
the magnitude of the stimulus, when this last is expressed in terms 
of its threshold value(b), i. e. that magnitude considered as unit 
at which the sensation begins and disappears. In short, it is pro- 
portional to the logarithm of the fundamental stimulus value. 
Before we proceed further, let us hasten to show that that 
relation between stimulus and sensation, from which the meas- 
urement formula is derived, may be correctly deduced in turn 
from it, and that this latter thus finds its verification in so far 
as these relations are found empirically. We have here at the 
same time the simplest examples of the application of the meas- 
urement formula.  
-P-A-G-E-592
  570 GUSTAV THEODOR FECHNER 
The measurement formula is founded upon Weber’s law and 
the fact of the stimulus threshold; and both must follow in turn 
from it. 
Now as to Weber’s law. In the form that equal increments of 
sensation are proportional to relative stimulus increments, it 
may be obtained by differentiating the measurement formula, 
inasmuch as in this way one returns to the fundamental for- 
mula, which contains the expression of the law in this form. 
In the form, that equal sensation differences correspond to 
equal relations of stimulus, the law may be deduced in quite an 
elementary manner as follows. 
Let two sensations, whose difference is to be considered, be 
called y andy’, and the corresponding stimuli 8 and @’. Then 
according to the measurement formula 
y =x (log B—log b) 
y' =x (log B!— log 6) 
and likewise for the sensation difference 
y—7' =« (log 8 — log 6’) 
or, since log £ - log 8’ = log . 
y—7' =« log - 
From this formula it follows, that the sensation difference y—y’ 
is a function of the stimulus relation : , and remains the same 
no matter what values 8, 8’ may take, so long as the relation 
remains unchanged, which is the statement of Weber’s law. 
In a later chapter we shall-return to the above formula under 
the name of the difference formula, as one of the simplest conse- 
quences of the measurement formula. 
As for the fact of the threshold, which is caused by the sensa- 
tion having zero value not at zero but at a finite value of the 
stimulus, from which point it first begins to obtain notice- 
able values with increasing values of stimulus, it is so far con- 
tained in the measurement formula as y does not, according 
to this formula, have the value zero when 8 =o, but when 8 
is equal to a finite value b. This follows as well from equation
-P-A-G-E-593
  ELEMENTS OF PSYCHOPHYSICS 571 
(2) as (3) of the measurement formula, directly from (2), and 
from (3) with the additional consideration of the fact, that 
when f equals 6, log e equals log 1, and log 1=0. 
Naturally all deduction from Weber’s law and the fact of 
the threshold will also be deductions from our measurement 
formula. 
It follows from the former law, that every given increment of 
stimulus causes an ever decreasing increment in sensation in 
proportion as the stimulus grows larger, and that at high values 
of the stimulus it is no longer sensed, while on the other hand, 
at low values it may appear exceptionally strong. 
In fact the increase of a large number @ by a given amount 
is accompanied by a considerably smaller increase in the corre- 
sponding logarithm y, than the increase of a small number 8 by 
the same amount. When the number ro is increased by 10, 
(that is, reaches 20), the logarithm corresponding to 10, which 
is 1, is increased to 1.3010. When, however, the number 1000 
is increased by 10, the logarithm corresponding to 1000, namely 
3, is only increased to 3.0043. In the first case the logarithm is 
increased by 1-3 of itsamount, in the latter case by about 1-700. 
In connection with the fact of the threshold belongs the de- 
duction, that a sensation is further from the perception thres- 
hold the more the stimulus sinks under its threshold value. 
This distance of a sensation from the threshold, is represented in 
the same manner by the negative values of y, according to our 
measurement formula, as the increase above the threshold is 
represented by the positive values. 
In fact one sees directly from equation (2), that when # is 
smaller than 6 and with it log 8 smaller than log b, the sensa- 
tion takes on negative values, and the same deduction follows in 
equation (3), in that a becomes a proper fraction when B<O, 
and the logarithm of a proper fraction is negative. 
In so far as sensations, which are caused by a stimulus 
which is not sufficient to raise them to consciousness, are called 
unconscious, and those which affect consciousness are called 
 
-P-A-G-E-594
  572 GUSTAV THEODOR FECHNER 
conscious, we may say that the unconscious sensations are 
represented in our formula by negative, the conscious by posi- 
tive values. We will return to this statement in a special chap- 
ter (chapter 18) since it is of great importance, and perhaps not 
directly evident to everyone. For the present I shall not let it 
detain me longer. 
According to the foregoing our measurement formula corre- 
sponds to experience: 
1. In the cases of equality, where a sensation difference 
“remains the same when the absolute intensity of the stimulus is 
altered (Weber’s law). 
2. In the cases of the thresholds, where the sensation itself 
ceases, and where its change becomes either imperceptible or 
barely perceptible. In the former case, when the sensation 
reaches its lower threshold; in the latter case, when it becomes 
so great that a given stimulus increase is barely noticed. 
3. In the contrasting cases, between sensations which rise 
above the threshold of consciousness and those that do not 
reach it, — in short, conscious and unconscious sensations. 
From the above the measurement, formula may be considered 
well founded. 
In the measurement formula one has a general dependent rela- 
tion between the size of the fundamental stimulus and the size of the 
corresponding sensation and not one which is valid only for the 
cases of equal sensations. This permits the amount of sensation to 
be calculated from the relative amounts of the fundamental stimu- 
lus and thus we have a measurement of sensation.

THEORY OF COLOR VISION 
Hyrotueses. The facts to be deduced from the laws of 
color-mixture, that three constituents of sensation which 
proceed independently of one another are produced by exter- 
nal stimulation, have received their more definite and more sig- 
nificant expression in the hypotheses, which assume, that these 
different constituents are excited and transmitted in different 
portions of the optic nerve; but that they simultaneously attain 
to consciousness, and thereby, so far as they have become 
excited from the same place of the retina, they are also localized 
in the same place of the field of vision. 
Such a theory was first proposed by Thomas Young.! The 
more detailed development of it is essentially conditioned by 
* From H. von Helmholtz’s Handbuch der Physiologischen Optik. Leipzig, 
1856-66; 2te. umgearb. Aufl. Hamb. u. Lpz. 1896. 
1 Thomas Young’s theory of color vision is as follows: “From three simple 
sensations, with their combinations, we obtain seven primitive distinctions of 
colours; but the different proportions, in which they may be combined, afford a 
variety of traits beyond all calculation. The three simple sensations being red, 
green, and violet, the three binary combinations are yellow, consisting of red and 
green; crimson, of red and violet; and blue, of green and violet; and the seventh 
in order is white light, composed by all three united. But the blue thus produced, 
by combining the whole of the green and violet rays, isnot the blue of the spect- 
rum, for four parts of green and one of violet make a blue differing very little 
from green; while the blue of the spectrum appears to contain as much violet as 
green: and itis for this reason that red and blue usually make a purple, deriving its 
hue from the predominance of the violet.”” Thomas Young’s A Course of Lec- 
tures on Natural Philosophy. Lond. 1807, vol. 1, p. 440.

  574 HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ 
the fact, that its author would ascribe to the sensitive nerves of 
the eye only the properties and capacities, which we positively 
know as belonging to the motor nerves of men and of animals. 
We have a much more favorable opportunity to discover these 
latter by experiment than is the case with the nerves of sensa- 
tion, since we are able comparatively easily and definitely both 
to discern and to measure the finest changes of their excitation 
and excitability by means of the contractions occurring in the 
muscles, and their changes. What we furthermore have been 
able to ascertain concerning the structure, the chemical consti- 
tution, the excitability, the conductivity, and the electrical 
behavior of the sensitive nerves, harmonises so perfectly with 
the corresponding behavior of the motor nerves, that funda- 
mental differences in the nature of their activity are extremely 
improbable, at least so far as these do not depend upon the other 
organic apparatus connected with them, upon which they exert 
their influence. 
Now we know in regard to motor nerves only the contrast 
between the state of rest and of activity. In the former state 
the nerve can remain unaltered a long time without important 
chemical change or development of heat; and at the same time 
the muscle dependent upon the nerve remains lax. If we stimu- 
late the nerve, heat develops in it material changes, electrical 
oscillations are shown, and the muscle is contracted. Ina 
cut nerve-preparation the sensitiveness is quickly lost, prob- 
ably on account of the expansion of the chemical constituents 
necessary for activity. Under the action of atmospheric oxygen, 
or better still of the arterial blood containing oxygen, the sensi- 
tiveness is wholly or partially slowly restored, save that these 
processes of restoration excite contractions of the muscle, or 
changes of electrical relation in nerve and muscle coincident 
with the activity. We are acquainted also with no external 
means which can produce this process of restoration so 
quickly and intensively, and which can permit it at the same 
time so suddenly to appear and again to cease, as would be 
necessary, if this process were to serve as the physiological 
basis of a powerful sensation occurring with precision.

  MANUAL OF PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS 575 
If we confine our assumptions concerning the development of 
a theory of color vision to the properties belonging with cer- 
tainty to the nerves, there is presented in fairly secure outline 
the theory of Thomas Young. 
The sensation of dark corresponds to the state of rest of the 
optic nerve, that of colored or white light to an excitement of 
it. The three simple sensations which correspond to the excite- 
ment only of a single one of the three nerve systems, and from 
which all the others can be composed, must correspond in the 
table of colors to the three angles of the color triangle. 
In order to assume the finest possible color sensations not 
demonstrable by objective stimulus, it appears appropriate so 
to select the angles of the color triangle that its sides include in 
the closest possible way the curves of the colors of the spectrum. 
Thomas Young has therefore assumed: 
1. There are in the eye three kinds of nerve fibres. The ex- 
citation of the first produces the sensation of red; the excitation 
of the second, the sensation of green; the excitation of the 
third, the sensation of violet. 
2. Objective homogeneous light excites these three kinds of 
fibres with an intensity which varies according to the length 
of the wave. The fibres sensitive to red are excited most 
strongly by light of the greatest wave-length; and those sensi- 
tive to violet by light of the smallest wave-length. Neverthe- 
less, it is not precluded, but rather to be assumed, for the expla- 
nation of a series of phenomena, that each color of the spectrum 
excites all the kinds of fibres, but with different intensity. If we- 
suppose in Fig. r the spectrum colors placed horizontally and in 
their natural order, beginning from red R up to violet V, the 
three curves may represent more or less exactly the strength 
of the excitation of the three kinds of fibres: no. 1 those sensi- 
tive to red; no. 2 those sensitive to green; and no. 3 those sen- 
sitive to violet. 
The simple red excites strongly the fibres sensitive to red, 
and weakly the two other kinds of fibres; sensation: red. 
The simple yellow excites moderately the fibres sensitive to 
red and green, weakly the violet; sensation: red.

Fig. r 
The simple green excites strongly the fibres sensitive to green, 
much more weakly the two other kinds; sensation: green. 
The simple blue excites moderately the fibres sensitive to 
green and violet, weakly the red; sensation: blue. 
The simple violet excites strongly the fibres which belong to 
it, and weakly the others; sensation: violet. 
The excitation of all the fibres of nearly equal strength gives 
the sensation of white, or of whitish colors. 
Perhaps it may be objected at first view to this hypothesis, 
that three times the number of nerve fibres and nerve endings 
must be presumed than in the older assumption, according to 
which each separate nerve fibre was thought capable of trans- 
mitting all kinds of chromatic excitations. But I do not believe, 
that in this connection the supposition of Young is in contra- 
diction with the anatomical facts. An hypothesis was previ- 
ously discussed,’ which explains the accuracy of sight by the 
aid of a much smaller number of visual nerve fibres, than the 
number of distinguishable places in the field of vision. 
The choice of the three fundamental colors seems at first, as 
we have observed, somewhat arbitrary. Any other three colors 
might be chosen from which white can be composed. Young 
was guided probably by the consideration that the colors at the 
end of the spectrum appear to claim a privileged position. If we 
were not to select these it would be necessary to take for one of 
the fundamental colors a purple shade, and the curve which cor-

responds to it in the foregoing figure (Fig. 1), would have two 
maxima: one in red, and the other in violet. 
The single circumstance, which is of direct importance in the 
mode of sensation and appears to give a clue for the determina- 
tion of the fundamental colors, is the apparent greater color- 
saturation of the red and violet; a thing which also manifests 
itself, although indeed less markedly, for green. Since we style 
colors the more saturated the farther they are removed from 
white, we must expect that great saturation must belong partic- 
ularly to those colors of the spectrum which produce most 
purely the simplest sensations of color. In fact, these colors, if 
they are very pure, have even with inferior brilliancy, some- 
thing of an intensively glowing, almost dazzling quality. 
There are especially red, violet, or blue violet flowers, e.g. of the 
cameraria, whose colors display this characteristic blending of 
darkness and brilliancy. Young’s hypothesis affords for this a 
simple explanation. A dark color can cause an intensive excita- 
tion of one of the three nerve systems, while the corresponding 
bright white causes a much weaker excitation of the same. The 
difference appears analogous to that between the sensation of 
very hot water upon a small portion of the skin and lukewarm 
water striking a greater surface. 
In particular violet makes upon me this impression of a deeply 
saturated color. But inasmuch as the strictly violet rays, even 
when they occur in sunlight, are of slight intensity and are 
modified by fluorescence, ultramarine blue, which has far the 
advantage of greater intensity of light, produces an effect ap- 
proximately equal toit. Thestrictly pure violet of the spectrum 
is very little known among the laity, since the violet pigments 
give nearly always the effect of a slight admixture of red, or 
appear very dark. For that very reason, the shades of the ultra- 
marine blue coming near to the violet excite the general atten- 
tion much more, are much better known, and are designated 
by a much older name, — that of blue, — than the violet strictly 
so called. In addition one has in the deep ultramarine blue of 
the cloudless sky a highly imposing, well known, and constant 
example of this color.  
-P-A-G-E-600
  578. HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ 
In this fact I seek the reason why in former times blue has 
always been regarded as the one fundamental color. And the 
more recent observers, like Maxwell and A. Konig, who have 
sought to determine the composition of color, have also in 
part returned to it. For both of these had, to be sure, a more 
definite reason in the above mentioned elevation of the curve 
of the colors of the spectrum in violet. 
It should still be mentioned that the Venetian school of 
painters, which creates effects chiefly by the intense richness of 
its color, is especially fond of putting in juxtaposition the three 
colors, red, green, and violet. 
Furthermore, I decidedly question the opinion expressed by 
various investigators, that the need of designating primary 
sensations has manifested itself in the names of the colors, and 
that these might therefore give a clue for the determination of 
colors. Our forefathers had before them in colors a domain of 
vague distinctions. If they wanted to determine sharp degrees 
of difference they had first of all to look for good old examples 
of striking shade, which were everywhere known, and any- 
where observable. The names for red led back to the Sanscrit 
rudhira = blood, and also “red.” From this épv6pds, rufus, 
ruber, roth, red, etc. For “blue” the Greeks have wopdupeos 
and xvdveos, which appear to refer to the sea; the Latins 
coeruleus, from ccelum, the sky; the Germans “blau”’; the 
English, blue; the Dutch, blau; the old German, blaw; which 
appear to lead to the English ‘“‘blow,” that is, the color of the 
air. The names for green may be traced back to vegetation, 
mpdoivos (leek-green), 7rowdes (grass-green), viridis from vis, 
virescere (to grow strong); German: green, English: green, refer 
to “grow.” 
The oldest designations of color were very vague: fav0ds 
appears to have extended from golden yellow to blue green. It 
was clearly a difficult task to fix in sharp degrees of difference 
this vague domain. To-day even it is difficult for gifted children 
to learn the names of colors. One should not infer from these 
facts that the ancients were color blind. 
_ That from the series of colors which may be stimulated by

objective light, it is impossible to select three which can be 
regarded as fundamental sensations, has already been dis- 
cussed. For this very reason A. KG6nig and C. Dieterici have 
distinguished a middle section of the spectrum, the colors of 
which we can no longer obtain by the mixture of the end-colors 
and one of the spectrum colors lying within it. The table of 
colors drawn according to the measurements of the same ob- 
servers reveals the same fact in graphic representation. Just 
on this account the supposition is necessary for Thomas 
Young’s theory, that every color of the spectrum excites simul- 
taneously, even though in different intensity, not merely one, 
but two or all three, of the three nerve systems which are sensi- 
tive to color. At best the hypothesis of simplicity would be 
permissible for the end-colors of the spectrum, red and violet. 
But precisely in the case of violet we know, that the fluores- 
cence of the retina produced by the violet rays must vitiate the 
sensation, and it appears to me not improbable, that the height 
of the curve between F and Y, found even by Maxwell, is con- 
ditioned by the fluorescence of the retina. 
It further follows, that it must appear theoretically possible 
to produce sensations of more saturated colors through other 
conditions of excitation. That this is also practically possible, 
and that this demand can be actually fulfilled by Young’s 
theory, I shall have to explain in the description of after-images. 
The color theory of Thomas Young, above outlined, is, as 
compared with the general theory of nervous activity as it was 
worked out by Johannes Miiller, a more special application of 
the law of specific sensations. Corresponding to its hypotheses 
the sensations of red, green, and violet would be regarded as 
determined by the specific energy of sensation of the correspond- 
ing three nerve systems. Any sort of excitation whatever, 
which can in any degree excite the nerve system aforesaid, 
would always be able to produce in it only its specific sensa- 
tion. As for the cause of the particular quality of these sensa- 
tions we hardly need look for it in the retina or the constitution 
of its fibres, but in the activity of the central parts of the brain 
associated with them.

Ihave up to the present kept the analysis of this theory relatively 
abstract in order to keep it as free as possible from farther hypothet- 
ical additions. Nevertheless, there are as great advantages for the 
certain understanding of such abstractions, if one tries to imagine 
for oneself pictures as concrete as possible, even though these occa- 
sion many a presupposition that is not directly necessary for the na- 
ture of the case. In this sense I permit myself to set forth Young’s 
theory in the following somewhat more manifest form. That objec- 
tions to these additions do not contradict the essence of Young’s 
hypothesis, I have no need to explain. 
1. Three kinds of photochemically decomposible substances are 
deposited in the end organs of the visual nerve fibres, which have 
different sensitiveness for the different parts of the spectrum. The 
three color values of the colors of the spectrum depend essentially 
upon the photochemical reaction of these three substances to the 
light. In the eyes of birds and reptiles besides colorless cones there 
occur in fact rods with red, and rods with yellow-green, drops of oil, 
which might produce a favoring of some simple light in their action 
upon the back element of these formations. In the case of human 
beings and other mammals nothing similar has up to the present 
time been found. 
2. By the disintegration of all the substances sensitive to light, 
the nerve fibre laden therewith, is set into a state of excitation. 
There is only one kind of activity capable of exciting sensation in 
every nerve fibre which accompanies the disintegration of the 
organic substance and the development of heat, as we know from 
our study of the nerves of muscles. These phenomena in the three 
systems of fibres are probably also thoroughly similar one to the 
other. They act differently in the brain only for the reason that they 
are united to different functioning parts of the brain. The nerve 
fibres need here as everywhere to play only the part of conducting 
wires, by which entirely similar electric currents which pass through 
them can precipitate or call forth the most various activities in the 
apparatus connected with the ends. These excitations of the three 
systems of fibre form the above separated three elementary excita- 
tions, provided always that the intensity of excitation, for which 
we still have no universally valid measure, is thereby made propor- 
tional to the strength of light. This does not prevent the intensity 
of the elementary excitation being any involved function whatever 
of the use of material or of the negative variation of the current in
-P-A-G-E-603

the nerves, which latter phenomena might occasionally be employed 
as a measure of excitation. 
3. In the brain the three systems of fibres stand in alliance with 
the three different functioning systems of ganglionic cells, which are 
perhaps spatially so close to one another, that those corresponding 
to the same parts of the retina lie close together. This appears to 
follow from recent investigations concerning the influence of lesions 
of the brain upon the field of vision.

THEORY OF LIGHT SENSATION

BENJAMIN RAND 
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF A THEORY OF 
LIGHT SENSATION 
$25. PREFATORY REMARKS 
ALTHOUGH strictly speaking a theory of light sensation has 
to consider all visual sensations, I mean here chiefly to con- 
sider only the sensations of white, black, and the transitions 
from one to the other, that is to say, only the colorless, or, as I 
have termed them (§ 21), white-black sensations. Later, I shall 
enter upon a special discussion of color-sensations in the 
stricter sense of that term. 
Colors, to be sure, are everywhere intermingled, and espe- 
cially in the after-images of the closed eye; but I shall wholly 
disregard color in all such more or less colored sensations, and 
confine myself only to that which can be designated as the 
whitishness or blackishness of sensation. Later it will appear, 
that this special consideration of the sensations of colorless 
light even has its complete theoretical justification. 
The sensation of white or colorless light has been regarded as 
a mixed sensation, because it is produced by a simultaneous 
effect of so called complementary kinds of light upon the retina. 
Nevertheless we see simultaneously in white, neither yellow and 
blue, nor red and green, nor any other two complementary

  THEORY OF LIGHT SENSATION _ 583 
colors, but at most the white shades off into yellow or blue, red 
or green, never, however, into two complementary colors. The 
designation of white, therefore, as a sensation of red and green, 
or yellow and blue, or of all colors simultaneously mixed, ap- 
pears inadmissible, and has indeed arisen only from the ab- 
stract confusion of sensations with their causes. Not everyone, 
who has termed white a mixed sensation, meant to say that the 
sensations were actually mixed, but only, that in order to excite 
the sensation of white we must mix light of different wave 
lengths. This sensation aroused by the simultaneous reaction 
of divers kinds of rays can very well be regarded as a simple 
resultant of mingled physical causes. 
The Young-Helmholtz hypothesis can only in this sense be 
acceptable to a certain extent. For if we were to say to a dis- 
interested person, even though he had a highly developed sense 
of color such as a painter has, that white is a compound sensa- 
tion in which one perceives not only simultaneously, but also 
with equal intensity, red, green, and violet, he would reply with 
an incredulous shake of the head, or, if he felt no special respect 
for the trustworthiness of science, witha smile. That three tones 
of different pitch are contained in a triad, everyone hears who 
is skilled in music, though only in a slight degree; but no one is 
able, try as he may, to extract the sensations of red, green, and 
violet, from one and the same white. ; 
To one, who enters upon the investigation of his visual 
sensations without physical or physiological presuppositions, 
white is a sensation of its own kind, just as black, red, green, 
yellow, and blue. Something can be combined with the white 
from one or the other, or even from several of the last men- 
tioned sensations so that it more or less clearly reminds us of 
them. If, however, we imagine these intermingled traces of 
other sensations to be absent, a sensation is left of an entirely 
specific and pure quality, which decidedly gives the impression 
of something simple, and which the unprejudiced sees no oc- 
casion whatever to regard as compound. The same, moreover, 
is quite true of the sensation of black. 
Since the physiologist must deem all sensations as conditioned
-P-A-G-E-606
  584 EWALD HERING 
and supported by physical processes of the nervous system, 
because otherwise every further physiological investigation 
would be useless, he must also accept the so-called psycho- 
physical processes or movements, which correspond to the sen- 
sations of black, of white, and of all transitions from one to the 
other. Itis not possible to say as yet in what part of thenerv- 
ous system these psychophysical processes are to be conceived 
as localized. Suffice it to say, that somewhere in the nervous 
apparatus of the eye and the parts of the brain standing in 
functional connection therewith, the substance must be sought 
with whose change or movement sensation is connected. This 
substance we might designate as the psychophysical substance 
of the organ of sight relative to the brain. It will be shorter to 
designate it as the visual substance, because the visual sensa- 
tions are connected with it and immediately dependent upon it. 
Whether this visual substance is to be sought only in the brain, 
or likewise in the nerves of sight, and in the retina, and in what 
histological constituents of the same, — all this remains out- 
side the present discussion. 
It is manifest, that we can draw conclusions at first only from 
the nature and course of our visual sensations in regard to the 
course of the psychophysical processes, which occur in the 
visual substance; for with these the sensations are to be re- 
garded as immediately and legitimately connected. If we can 
determine in this way to a certain extent the laws of psycho- 
physical reactions in the visual substance, not until we do is it 
in order for us to seek the laws of functional relation between 
those psychophysical processes and the vibrations of aether. 
The reverse method which proceeds from the vibrations of 
aether has led heretofore to no result, so far as it has dealt not 
merely with the vicissitudes of the rays of light in the optical 
media, that is to say exclusively with an application of phys- 
ical optics to the eye. We know nothing at all of what takes 
place after the light waves have penetrated the retina. On the 
other hand we certainly obtain through numerous physical 
investigations the most valuable conclusions concerning the 
relations between the vibrations of aether and visual sensa-

tions. But all physiological links and especially their psycho- 
physical processes have been simply ignored in these investiga- 
tions, as was quite appropriate under the circumstances of a 
preliminary research. 
Only the psychophysical investigations, especially Fechner’s, 
have a closer regard to the physiological intermediaries, espe- 
cially in so far as Fechner proposed a law of functional connec- 
tion between the psychophysical movement and the so called 
intensity of sensations. I refer to that psychophysical law 
called by Fechner’s name,* the validity of which I must chal- 
lenge not merely for the sense of sight, but for the domain ofall 
the senses. 
§ 26. THE NATURE OF THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL 
PROCESSES 
If we desire to form an idea of the nature of the psychophy- 
sical processes, we have from the outset a choice between such 
inner movements of the psychophysical, or (briefly) psychical 
substance, as occur without change of chemical composition, 
and such movements asappear to be at the same time changes 
of chemical composition. The physiologist of the present can 
nevertheless no longer be in doubt about his decision. For the 
general physiology of the nerves has sufficiently proven, that 
every movement or activity of the nervous substance changes 
it at once chemically; and upon the hypothesis of chemical 
changes all our ideas of changes of sensitiveness, fatigue, and 
recuperation after activity are based. 
How Du Bois-Reymond } could propose a purely physical 
hypothesis concerning processes in the nerve-fibres becomes 
conceivable, when you consider that he aimed in reality only 
at the explanation of what the multiplicator testified to him 
about the processes in the nerves. If he had had for the changes 
of the nerve as fine a chemical reagent, as he possessed in the 
* Supra, p. 570. 
t Cf. Emil du Bois-Reymond’s Untersuchungen tiber thierische Electricitat, 
Berlin, 1848-49.
-P-A-G-E-608
    586 EWALD HERING 
multiplicator an electrical one, he would then of course have 
proposed a chemical hypothesis. At all events, the hypothesis 
of Du Bois-Reymond does not form a conclusive objection 
against my affirmation, that according to our present knowledge 
the activity of the psychophysical substance is not easily con- 
ceivable without simultaneous chemical changes. 
The hypothesis developed in Fechner’s psychophysics, ac- 
cording to which all psychophysical processes are regarded as 
oscillatory movements of a substance not more exactly to be 
designated as ponderable or imponderable, also cannot be 
cited against the above affirmation. For first, the hypothesis 
according to the whole nature of the case rests upon only an 
empirical basis which up to the present is very narrow; and 
secondly, although it is purely mechanical, it still permits to the 
chemical processes their significance in psychical happening, 
and, so to speak, includes them. 
In whatever way one may regard these questions this much 
is certain, that the continuous existence of chemical process is 
in every living and consequently sensitive substance a fact, and 
transformation is for us the most universal known characteris- 
tic of living things. 
So much in the way of proof for the justification by prin- 
ciple of the following theory, which is related primarily to the 
chemical action in the nerve substance. A definite view as to 
whether we actually apprehend in this chemical action the 
real psychophysical movement, or whether an intermediate 
link intervenes, as it were, between this and the sensation, I do 
not for the present mean to have said. Furthermore, it was by 
no means my intention in this brief discussion to enter upon 
a real investigation of the difficult question concerning the 
nature of psychophysical movement. On the contrary, it was 
intended only to show that the physiologist is perfectly right 
in conceiving the life of the nerve-substance primarily as 
chemical, and likewise that of the psychophysical substance, 
which even, if one does not insert a new and completely un- 
known link, must be wholly or partially identified with the 
nerve-substance.

    THEORY OF LIGHT SENSATION — 587 
§ 27. VISUAL SENSATION AS PSYCHICAL 
CORRELATE OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES IN THE 
VISUAL SUBSTANCE 
That light occasions chemical changes in the nervous ap- 
paratus of the visual organ will probably not be disputed after 
what has been said. What we term fatigue and in general change 
of sensitivity of this process rest according to the universal 
view, here as everywhere, upon chemical change of a sensitive 
substance. Fechner himself, who sought to develop farther the 
theory of resonance proposed by the physicists Herschell, 
Melloni, and Seebeck, for the excitation of the retina by light, 
saw occasion to take account of the chemical influences of light 
upon the nerve substance and to include them in his reckoning.! 
The chemical processes occasioned by light in the visual 
organ were first regarded as localised in the retina. But if cer- 
tain parts of the brain participate in the production of visual 
sensations and representations, those chemical processes of the 
retina must on their part also occasion chemical changes in the 
substance of the visual nerve, and these in turn in the substance 
of the brain. Since, however, as already stated, we do not know 
whether we have to consider the entire substance of the visual 
organ, or only a part of it, and in the latter instance which part, 
as the true psychophysical visual substance, we must for the 
present be content with the current hypothesis, that the vibra- 
tions of aether set free in general chemical changes in the nerv- 
ous visual apparatus. And those changes, whether the series 
of these chemical processes be long or short, whether it be com- 
posed of similar or dissimilar members, lead finally to sensation. 
Furthermore, whatever ideas of the nature and place of the 
processes occurring in the visual organ investigators enter- 
tained, one thing was lacking to all: viz., they merely conceived 
the sensations of bright or white— color here too I entirely dis- 
regard — as conditioned by and based upon certain changes of 
the visual substance; the sensation of dark or black in reference 
1 Psychophysik, u. Theil, § 283,

pes EWALD HERING 
to its physiological or psychophysical correlate was entirely 
neglected. How this came about, and to what contradictions 
this onesided consideration of the sensation of brightness led, I 
have more fully set forth in my foregoing chapter (§ 21-23). 
The facts there developed compel us henceforth to abandon 
this onesided attitude in the investigation of the visual sensa- 
tions, and to give an equal consideration to the two chief varia- 
bles in visual sensation, the dark or black, just as much as the 
bright or white. 
Ihave explained in § 21, how all sensations of the black-white 
series of sensations appear related to one another ina twofold 
manner, and have in common two different kinds of factors, 
namely, the sensation of brightness and of darkness, the black 
and the white. I have also set forth how each member of this 
sensation series can be characterised by the relation in which 
both these factors are contained in the given sensation. If now 
we ask concerning the psychical correlates of those sensations, 
and concerning the psychophysical or psychochemical processes 
lying at their basis; not only does the hypothesis, that the 
physical correlate of the blackest sensation is nothing further 
than the lowest degree of intensity of the same process which 
conditions in its highest intensity the clearest or purest white 
sensation, have nothing in its favor, but even appears to be 
extravagant and contradictory. For this hypothesis demands 
one and the same kind of psychophysical process for two clearly 
fundamentally different qualities of sensation. But our entire 
psychophysics is based upon the hypothesis, that there exists 
a certain parallelism between physical and psychical events, 
and especially that to different qualities of sensation there cor- 
respond different qualities or forms of psychophysical phe- 
nomena.!   
1 Although this ought to be self evident to everyone who accepts a legitimate 
functional relation between psychical and physical, between sensation and nerve 
process, it still has often been forgotten, and even Fechner, although heis guided 
by the same presupposition, nevertheless makes, as I deem, too little application 
of it. Mach styles this fundamental presupposition of the entire psychophys- 
ics merely as “a heuristic principle of psychophysical research”; but it is more, 
it is the conditio sine qua non of all such research, if itisto bear any fruit. Mach
-P-A-G-E-611
  THEORY OF LIGHT SENSATION — 589 
If we do not desire, therefore, at the outset to introduce in 
like manner into this difficult domain an hypothesis which 
stands in a yet unsolved contradiction to the fundamental 
presupposition of the entire science of psychophysics, and pro- 
bably furnishes a bad precedent for other wholly capricious 
and theoretically improbable hypotheses, we must abandon 
the present current view. And we can do this the more readily 
as another hypothesis presents itself which is thoroughly in 
accord with the aforementioned presupposition of psychophys- 
ics, and at the same time satisfies far better than the present 
theory the demands which must be taken into consideration 
from the point of view of the general physiology of the nerves. 
This hypothesis is the following: 
To the two qualities of sensation, which we designate as white 
or bright and as black or dark, correspond two different quali- 
ties of chemical activity in the visual substance ; and to the 
different relations of brightness or intensity, with which these 
two sensations appear in single transitions between pure white 
and pure black, or to the relations in which they appear mixed, 
correspond the same relations of intensities of those two psycho- 
physical processes. 
It will be readily acknowledged after reflection, that this 
hypothesis is the simplest there is, because it states the sim- 
plest formula that can be conceived for the functional connec- 
tion between physical and psychical phenomena. 
But it also satisfies every demand that the general physio- 
remarks (Uber d. Wirk,d. rauml, Vertheil. d. Lichtreizes auf die Netzhaut. Sitzungs- 
ber. d. Akad. 52 Bd., 1868). “To every psychical there correspondsa physical, and 
the reverse. To like psychical processes there correspond like physical, to unlike, 
unlike. If a psychical process can be resolved in a purely psychological way into 
a number of qualities a, b, c, there will correspond to these likewise an equal 
number of different physical processes @, 8, y. To alldetailsof the psychical there 
correspond details of the physical.” Barring the omission from the statement, of 
all reference to the fact that psychophysical processes of very different size can 
produce the same sensation, because it depends everywhere not upon the abso- 
lute size of this process, but solely upon their reciprocal relation (cf. § 29), I can 
entirely accept these words of Mach. 
My theory of the spatial sense of the retina was founded upon the same princi- 
ple. Mach is the only one who has concurred in its fundamental thought.
-P-A-G-E-612
590 _ EWALD HERING 
logy of the nerves can make. We must suppose a substance in 
the nervous visual apparatus, which suffers change under the 
influence of the light that falls upon it, and this change, even 
though it may be characterised as physical, is nevertheless, as 
the physiology of the nerves must assume, at the same time a 
chemical process. If the action of the light ceases, the changed 
(more or less exhausted) substance reverts sooner or later to its 
original condition. This reversion can in turn be nothing but 
a chemical change in the opposite direction. If the occurring 
change of the excitable substance under the direct influence of 
light is conceived as a partial consumption, the reversion to the 
former condition must be conceived as a restitution; and if the 
former is viewed as an analytic process, the latter must be 
viewed as a synthetic process. 
It has also been customary to designate the latter process, by 
means of which the living organic substance again restores the 
loss suffered by excitation or activity as assimilation, and I will 
retain this expression. Now every living and excitable organic 
substance forms in the excitation or activity according to 
general assumption certain chemical products. The formation 
of these products I will designate analogously as the process of 
dissimilation. 
The propositions concerning assimilation (A) and dissimila- 
tion (D) just set forth are derived from the experiences of gen- 
eral physiology, and particularly of the physiology of the 
nerves. They have, therefore, been developed wholly inde- 
pendently of our hypothesis. Granted their correctness, it is by 
no means plausible, that merely the one kind of chemical 
activity in the visual substance, namely dissimilation, should 
have a psychophysical significance, but the other, the process 
of assimilation, none. The common view, that the chemical 
process taking place under the direct influence of light, namely 
dissimilation, is alone perceived, is clearly onesided and unjusti- 
fied. On the contrary, it appears from the outset proper to 
ascribe an equal value for sensation to both kinds of chemical 
process. But this leads to none other than the hypothesis above 
formulated. For we need only to make this hypothesis still
-P-A-G-E-613
  THEORY OF LIGHT SENSATION — 591 
more precise, by saying, that the dissimilation of the visual 
substance corresponds to the sensation of white or bright, and 
the assimilation of the visual substance to the sensation of black 
or dark ; and then the hypothesis, as I shall show, satisfies not 
only the facts of sensation, but also the demands of the general 
physiology of the nerves. 
If my hypothesis is correct we have the means, through the 
visual sensations, of observing closely the “ building up” process 
of the visual substance, and its two principal factors, assimilation 
and dissimilation. We do not, therefore, deal hereafter only with 
the fact, that a complex of sensations is transmitted from the 
eye to the human soul, which afterwards moulds it into present- 
ations by the aid of correct or false judgments or inferences; 
but what comes to consciousness as visual sensation is the 
physical expression or the conscious correlate of the chemical 
change of the visual substance. 
We have, therefore, a test of great sensitiveness for this 
chemical change, namely our consciousness. It tells us, indeed, 
nothing directly concerning the nature of the chemical com- 
pounds or disintegrations, but it reveals to us the whole tem- 
poral process of assimilation and dissimilation, the law of their 
dependence upon one another and upon the vibrations of aether, 
the elevation and depression of excitability of the visual sub- 
stance, and the dependence of these changes of excitability 
upon assimilation and dissimilation. In this way the chapter on 
visual sensations first becomes a truly integral section of 
physiology, whereas heretofore it necessarily contained more 
physical and philosophical, than strictly physiological dis- 
cussions. 
From the above hypothesis we derive, as is shown in what 
follows, a complete series of propositions concerning fatigue, 
excitability, chemical change of the visual substance, which are 
in harmony with certain propositions of the general physiology 
of the nerves; but we are able also in addition to give to those 
propositions in part a more precise expression, as well as to test 
certain new propositions, which follow as the result of our 
hypothesis, in regard to other excitable substances. In brief, a
-P-A-G-E-614
502 EWALD HERING 
way opens up for the further development of the general 
physiology of the nerves, also of the physiology of the “‘ ex- 
citable” substances, and finally of the doctrine of the whole 
organic life. That this way is not improbable, I hope to demon- 
strate in later chapters on several subjects in physiology. 
We have employed our sense-perceptions so abundantly in 
order to comprehend our external world, and they make it 
serviceable to us; let us now employ them also in order to in- 
vestigate the material activity of our own body, examining first 
by their aid what we feel, not as the external objects only medi- 
ately, but immediately, that is to say, the chemical change of 
our nervous system. 
§ 28. THE DEDUCTION OF VARIOUS COROL- 
LARIES 
In my fourth chapter I derived by means of an analysis of 
visual sensations, independent of every physical or physiolog- 
ical presupposition, the proposition, that every sensation of col- 
orless light is determined by the relation of the perceptible 
black to the simultaneous perceptible white in it, and that this 
relation determines the quality — brightness or darkness — of 
every white-black sensation. 
If we now apply to this problem the hypothesis advanced in 
the preceding section, we come to the further proposition that 
the quality — brightness or darkness — of a sensation of 
colorless light, is conditioned by the relation in which the in- 
tensity or extent of dissimilation of the visual substance stands 
to the intensity or degree of its simultaneous assimilation. 
From this it follows further, that to the gray, which I have 
designated as the middle or neutral, corresponds that condition 
of the visual substance in which dissimilation and assimilation 
are in equilibrium, so that the quantity of the excitable sub- 
stance remains constant. 
Further it follows, that in every rather bright sensation the 
dissimilation is greater than the assimilation, so that the 
excitable substance decreases; and the more rapidly, the greater 
 
-P-A-G-E-615
  THEORY OF LIGHT SENSATION — 593 
the relation = or the brighter the sensation is, and so much 
the more, the longer it continues. 
On the contrary it follows, that in every sensation, which is 
darker than the middle gray, the dissimilation is smaller than 
the simultaneous assimilation, so that the excitable substance 
increases; and, indeed, the more rapidly, the darker the ser- 
sation is, and so much the more, the longer it continues. 
What now does the increase or decrease of the excitable 
substance signify? 
If we style all stimuli which favor the dissimilation of the 
visual substance, stimuli of dissimilation or D stimuli, and if we 
borrow from general physiology the proposition, that the degree 
of the reaction with which an organ responds to a stimulus 
depends among other things upon the quantity of excitable 
substance contained in it and affected by the stimulus, we ar- 
rive at the farther proposition, that the degree of the dissimila- 
tion conditioned by a D stimulus (e.g., light) depends not 
merely upon the degree of the stimulus, but also upon the quan- 
tity of the excitable substance contained at any time in the 
stimulated portions and affected by the stimulus. 
The capacity of an excitable substance to become excited by 
stimuli, that is, to respond to these stimuli by a definite chemi- 
cal process, we term its excitability. Accordingly, we can desig- 
nate the capacity of the visual substance to react upon the D 
stimuli with dissimilation as its D excitability, and can now 
also express the foregoing proposition as follows: 
Every increase of the excitable substance conditions an en- 
hancement, and every decrease a depression, of the D excita- 
bility in the corresponding part of the visual organ. 
It follows further, that the sensation of medium gray condi- 
tions an equilibrium, every rather bright sensation a decrease, 
every rather dark sensation an increase, of the D excitability of 
the affected part. 
If sensations of different degrees of brightness or darkness 
are simultaneously produced in two places of nearest equal 
D excitability, the place of the brighter (less dark) sensa-

tion has always a smaller D excitability at the conclusion of the 
excitation, than the place of the less bright (darker) sensation; 
and it makes no difference whether one or both sensations 
were brighter or darker than the neutral gray. Furthermore, 
the remaining difference of D excitability is so much the 
greater, as the difference was greater between the brightness of 
both sensations, or between the values of the two corresponding 
y 
Jations ~~ and ni ani . relatlons stw stu’ 
Since according to what has been said the degree of dissimi- 
lation is always dependent on the one hand upon the degree of 
the stimulus, and upon the other hand upon the quantity of the 
excitable substance present in the stimulated part, we have the 
right from the outset to affirm, that the assimilation also does 
not always occur with constant intensity, but that it has like- 
wise a variable degree dependent upon definite conditions. 
For the process of dissimilation clearly presupposes, that on 
the one hand the necessary chemical conditions, that is to say, 
certain substances, are present; and on the other hand certain 
physical conditions, (suchas a certain temperature). According 
as whatever assimilation is present in greater or less degree, it 
takes place more quickly and more abundantly, or more slowly 
and less abundantly. The A material necessary to assimila- 
tion, present in the visual organ, which is constantly used in 
assimilation and constantly renewed by the blood, can become 
more or less exhausted as soon as its consumption is greater than 
the simultaneous restoration from the blood. For the degree of 
the assimilation probably also depends upon the quantity of 
the assimilative excitable substance present at the time. From 
what precedes it is already possible quite theoretically to 
deduce a series of propositions concerning the enhancement or 
depression of the capacity for assimilation or of the A excita- 
bility, and concerning the A stimuli in contrast with the D 
stimuli, etc. Nevertheless, I shall refer for the present only to 
such propositions from the general nerve physiology as are 
already accepted, and shall postpone a full discussion of them 
until later.

    THEORY: OF LIGHT SENSATION — 595 
§ 29. THE WEIGHT OF VISUAL SENSATIONS 
If the brightness or darkness of a sensation of colorless light 
depends solely upon the relation of dissimilation to the simul- 
taneous assimilation, and is therefore independent of the abso- 
lute magnitude of the corresponding psychophysical processes, 
the question arises, what is the significance of this absolute 
magnitude. Without entering here more closely into this ques- 
tion, which belongs to general psychophysics, I shall endeavor 
to give briefly a preliminary answer. 
The absolute extent of a given psychophysical process deter- 
mines the weight — to introduce here a new expression — of the 
corresponding sensation. If two simultaneous psychophysical 
processes of different quality lie at the basis of a sensation, as 
for instance the gray, then the sum of the magnitudes of both 
processes gives the weight of the resulting or mixed sensation. 
The clearness, with which every single relatively simple sensa- 
tion appears in such a compound sensation, depends upon the 
relation in which its individual weight stands to the total weight 
of the resulting or compound sensation. Thus, as we saw, the 
brightness or whitishness of a gray sensation is determined by 
the relation of the weight of the white sensation (or the degree 
of dissimilation) to the total weight of the gray sensation, that 
is, to the sum of the weights of the white and of the black sensa- 
tion, (or of the degree of dissimilation and assimilation). 
Ifa compound sensation, e.g., gray, is in itself a component of 
a still more complicated compound, e.g., of gray-blue, the clear- 
ness, with which the gray emerges in this sensation, depends 
in turn upon the relation in which the weight of the gray sensa- 
tion stands to the total-weight of the gray-blue. If, for example, 
in such a sensation the blue, white, and black appear with 
equal clearness, this depends upon the fact, that the blue, the 
white, and the black sensation have equal weight. We can also 
conceive such a sensation as composed of two parts of neutral 
gray and one part of blue. The character or quality of a sensa- 
tion is therefore independent of its total weight, but is deter-
-P-A-G-E-618
  596 EWALD HERING 
mined by the relation of the individual weights of the simple or 
relatively simple sensations composing it; and the weight of a 
black-white sensation does not gain significance until it appears 
with other visual sensations, or in general only so far as its 
relations to the other simultaneous processes come into con- 
sideration. 
The well informed reader must have recognised, from what 
has already been said, the general psychophysical law, from 
which I proceed in opposition to Fechner. This law says, 
that the purity or clearness of any sensation or presentation 
depends upon the relation, in which its weight, that is, the 
degree of the corresponding psychophysical process, stands to 
the total weight of all simultaneously present sensations and re- 
presentations, (or however else one may denominate the psychi- 
cal states), namely, to the sum of the degrees of all corresponding 
psychophysical processes. 
Most of the sensations, which we accept as simple, are highly complex; that 
partial sensation, which has the greatest weight, gives the total sensation its 
character and name. If the fragment of the total weight of a sensation, 
belonging to one of its components, sinks below a certain value, we are no 
longer in a position to feel these components as such. Nevertheless, a weak com- 
ponent also affects a sensation and determines by its character the quality 
thereof. Fechner would say the partial sensation remains “below the threshold.” 
Thus every visual sensation, as I shall later seek to prove, is composed of various 
simple sensations, and if I have here presented the sensations of the black-white 
series as only binary sensations, it has been done provisionally-in the interest of 
simplicity of treatment. In black and white even the colors simultaneously per- 
ceived are “ below the threshold ’’ because their relative weight is too small.

THE SENSATIONS AS ELEMENTS 
ANTIMETAPHYSICAL 
1. THE splendid success achieved by physical science in mod- 
ern times, a success which is not restricted to its own sphere 
but embraces that of other sciences which employ its help, has 
brought it about that physical ways of thinking and physical 
modes of procedure enjoy on all hands unwonted prominence, 
and that the greatest expectations are associated with their 
employment. In keeping with this drift of modern inquiry, 
the physiology of the senses, gradually leaving the paths which 
were opened by men like Goethe, Schopenhauer, and others, 
but with particular success by Johannes Miiller, has also as- 
sumed an almost exclusively physical character. This tend- 
ency must appear to us as not exactly the proper one, when 
we reflect that physics despite its considerable development 
nevertheless constitutes but a portion of a Jarger collective 
body of knowledge, and that it is unable, with its limited in- 
tellectual implements, created for limited and special purposes, 
to exhaust all the subject-matter of science. Without renounc- 
ing the support of physics, it is possible for the physiology of 
the senses, not only to pursue its own course of development, 
but also to afford to physical science itself powerful assistance;

a point which the following simple considerations will serve to 
illustrate. 
2. Colors, sounds, temperatures, pressures, spaces, times, 
and so forth, are connected with one another in manifold ways; 
and with them are associated moods of mind, feelings, and voli- 
tions. Out of this fabric, that which is relatively more fixed 
and permanent stands prominently forth, engraves itself in the 
memory, and expresses itself in language. Relatively greater 
permanency exhibit, first, certain complexes of colors, sounds, 
pressures, and so forth, connected in time and space, which 
therefore receive special names, and are designated bodies. 
Absolutely permanent such complexes are not. 
My table is now brightly, now dimly lighted. Its tempera- 
ture varies. It may receive an ink stain. One of its legs may 
be broken. It may be repaired, polished, and replaced part for 
part. But for me, amid all its changes, it remains the table at 
which I daily write. 
My friend may put on a different coat. His countenance 
may assume a serious or a cheerful expression. His complex- 
ion, under the effects of light or emotion, may change. His 
shape may be altered by motion, or be definitely changed. Yet 
the number of the permanent features presented, compared 
with the number of the gradual alterations, is always so great, 
that the latter may be overlooked. It is the same friend with 
whom I take my daily walk. 
My coat may receive a stain, a tear. My very manner of ex- 
pression shows that we are concerned here with a sum-total of 
permanency, to which the new element is added and from which 
that which is lacking is subsequently taken away. 
Our greater intimacy with this sum-total of permanency, 
and its preponderance as contrasted with the changeable, 
impel us to the partly instinctive, partly voluntary and con- 
scious economy of mental representation and designation, as 
expressed in ordinary thought and speech. That which is 
perceptually represented in a single image receives a single 
designation, a single name.
-P-A-G-E-621
  ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS 599 
As relatively permanent, there is exhibited, further, that 
complex of memories, moods, and feelings, joined to a particu- 
lar body (the human body), which is denominated the “I” or 
“Ego.” I may be engaged upon this or that subject, I may be 
quiet or animated, excited or ill-humored. Yet, pathological 
cases apart, enough durable features remain to identify the ego. 
Of course, the ego also is only of relative permanency. 
After a first survey has been obtained, by the formation of 
the substance-concepts “ body” and “ego” (matter and soul), 
the will is impelled to a more exact examination of the changes 
that take place in these relatively permanent existences. The 
changeable features of bodies and of the ego, in fact, are exactly 
what moves the will to this examination. Here the component 
parts of the complex are first exhibited as its properties. A fruit 
"is sweet; but it can also be bitter. Also, other fruits may be 
sweet. The red color we are seeking is found in many bodies. 
The neighborhood of some bodies is pleasant; that of others, 
unpleasant. Thus, gradually, different complexes are found to 
be made up of common elements. The visible, the audible, the 
tangible, are separated from bodies. The visible is analysed 
into colors and into form. In the manifoldness of the colors, 
again, though here fewer in number, other component parts are 
discerned — such as the primary colors, and so forth. The 
complexes are disintegrated into elements. 
3. The useful habit of designating such relatively perma- 
nent compounds by single names, and of apprehending them 
by single thoughts, without going to the trouble each time of an 
analysis of their component parts, is apt to come into strange 
conflict with the tendency to isolate the component parts. The 
vague image which we have of a given permanent complex, be- 
ing an image which does not perceptibly change when one or 
another of the component parts is taken away, gradually estab- 
shes itself as something which exists by itself. Inasmuch as it 
is possible to take away singly every constituent part without 
destroying the capacity of the image to stand for the totality 
and of being recognised again, it is imagined that it is possible 
 
-P-A-G-E-622
  
  600 ERNST MACH 
to subtract all the parts and to have something still remaining. 
Thus arises the monstrous notion of a thing in itself, unknow- 
able and different from its “ phenomenal” existence. 
Thing, body, matter, are nothing apart from their complexes 
of colors, sounds and so forth — nothing apart from their so- 
called attributes. That Protean, supposititious problem, which 
springs up so much in philosophy, of a single thing with many 
attributes, arises wholly from a mistaking of the fact, that 
summary comprehension and precise analysis, although both 
are provisionally justifiable and for many purposes profitable, 
cannot and must not be carried on simultaneously. A body 
is one and unchangeable only so long as it is unnecessary to 
consider its details. Thus both the earth and a billiard-ball 
are spheres, if the purpose in hand permits our neglecting de- 
viations from the spherical form, and great precision is not 
necessary. But when we are obliged to carry on investigations 
in orography or microscopy, both bodies cease to be spheres. 
4. Man possesses, in its highest form, the power of con- 
sciously and arbitrarily determining his point of view. He can 
at one time disregard the most salient features of an object, 
and immediately thereafter give attention to its smallest de- 
tails; now consider a stationary current, without a thought of its 
contents, and then measure the width of a Fraunhofer line 
in the spectrum; he can rise at will to the most general abstrac- 
tions or bury himself in the minutest particulars. The animal 
possesses this capacity in a far less degree. It does not assume 
a point of view, but is usually forced to it. The babe who does 
not know its father with his hat on, the dog that is perplexed at 
the new coat of its master, have both succumbed in this con- 
flict of points of view. Who has not been worsted in similar 
plights? Even the man of philosophy at times succumbs, as 
the grotesque problem, above referred to, shows. 
In this last case, the circumstances appear to furnish a real 
ground for justification. Colors, sounds, and the odors of bod- 
ies are evanescent. But the tangible part, as a sort of constant 
durable nucleus, not readily susceptible of annihilation, re-
-P-A-G-E-623
  ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS 601 
mains behind; appearing as the vehicle of the more fugitive 
properties annexed to it. Habit, thus, keeps our thought firmly 
attached to this central nucleus, even where the knowledge 
exists that seeing, hearing, smelling, and touching are inti- 
mately akin in character. A further consideration is, that ow- 
ing to the singularly extensive development of mechanical 
physics a kind of higher reality is ascribed to space and time 
than to colors, sounds, and odors; agreeably to which, the tem- 
poral and spatial links of colors, sounds, and odors appear to be 
more real than the colors, sounds, and odors themselves. The 
physiology of the senses, however, demonstrates, that spaces 
and times may just as appropriately be called sensations as 
colors and sounds. 
5. The ego, and the relation of bodies to the ego, give rise to 
similar pseudo-problems, the character of which may be briefly 
indicated as follows: 
Let those complexes of colors, sounds, and so forth, com- 
monly called bodies, be designated, for the sake of simplicity, 
by A BC... .; the complex, known as our own body, which 
constitutes a part of the former, may be called KLM... ; 
the complex composed of volitions, memory-images, and the 
rest, we shall represent by aBy . . . Usually, now, the com- 
plexaBy...KIM.. .,as making up the ego, is opposed 
to the complex A BC... ., as making up the world of sub- 
stance; sometimes, also,aBy . . . is viewed as ego,and KLM 
... ABC... as world of substance. Now, at first blush, 
ABC... appears independent of the ego, and opposed to it 
as a separate existence. But this independence is only relative, 
and gives way upon closer inspection. Much, it is true, may 
change in the complex afy . . . without a perceptible change 
being inducedin A BC . . .;and vice versa. But many changes 
in aBy... do pass, by way of changesin KLM ..., 
toA BC... ; andviceversa. (As, for example, when power- 
ful ideas burst forth into acts, or our environment induces 
noticeable changes in our body.) At the same time the group 
KLM... appears to be more intimately connected with
-P-A-G-E-624
  602 ERNST MACH 
aBy...and with A BC .. ., than the latter do with one 
another; relations which find their expression, in common 
thought and speech. 
Precisely viewed, however, it appears that the group A BC 
. is always codetermined by K L M. A cube of wood when 
seen close at hand, looks large; when seen at a distance, small; 
it looks different with the right eye from what it does with the 
left; sometimes it appears double; with closed eyes it is invis- 
ible. The properties of the same body, therefore, appear modi- 
fied by our own body; they appear conditioned by it. But 
where, now, is that same body, which to the appearance is so 
different? All that can be said is, that with different K L M@ 
different A BC .. . are associated. 
We see an object having a point S. If we touch S, that is, 
bring it into connexion with our body, we receive a prick. We 
can see S, without feeling the prick. But as soon as we feel the 
prick we find S. The visible point, therefore, is a permanent 
fact or nucleus, to which the prick is annexed, according to cir- 
cumstances, as something accidental. From the frequency of 
such occurrences we ultimately accustom ourselves to regard 
all properties of bodies as “effects” proceeding from perman- 
ent nuclei and conveyed to the ego through the medium of 
the body; which effects we call sensations. By this operation, 
however, our imagined nuclei are deprived of their entire sen- 
sory contents, and converted into mere mental symbols. The 
assertion, then, is correct that the world consists only of our 
sensations. In which case we have knowledge only of sensa- 
tions, and the assumption of the nuclei referred to, or of a re- 
ciprocal action between them, from which sensations proceed, 
turns out to be quite idle and superfluous. Such a view can 
only suit with a half-hearted realism or a half-hearted philo- 
sophical criticism. 
6. Ordinarily the complex a By... K LM... is contrasted 
as ego with the complex A BC. Those elements only of A BC 
. . « that more strongly alter a@y . . ., asa prick, a pain, are 
wont to be comprised in the ego. Afterwards, however, through
-P-A-G-E-625
  ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS 603 
observations of the kind just referred to, it appears that the 
right to annex A BC . . . to the ego nowhere ceases. In con- 
formity with this view the ego can be so extended as ultimately 
to embrace the entire world. The ego is not sharply marked off, 
its limits are very indefinite and arbitrarily displaceable. Only 
by failing to observe this fact, and by unconsciously narrowing 
those limits, while at the same time we enlarge them, arise, in 
the conflict of points of view, the metaphysical difficulties met 
with in this connection. 
As soon as we have perceived that the supposed unities 
“body” and “ego” are only makeshifts, designed for provis- 
ional survey and for certain practical ends (so that we may 
take hold of bodies, protect ourselves against pain, and so forth), 
we find ourselves obliged, in many profound scientific investi- 
gations, to abandon them as insufficient and inappropriate. 
The antithesis of ego and world, sensation (phenomenon) and 
thing, then vanishes, and we have simply to deal with the con- 
nexion of theelementsaBy...ABC...KLM...., 
of which this antithesis was only a partially appropriate and 
imperfect expression. This connexion is nothing more nor less 
than the combination of the above-mentioned elements with 
other similar elements (time and space). Science has simply to 
accept this connexion, and to set itself aright (get its bearings) 
in the intellectual environment which is thereby furnished, 
without attempting to explain its existence. 
Ona superficial examination the complex aBy. . . appears 
to be made up of much more evanescent elements than A BC 
. and K LM... in which last the elements seem to be 
connected with greater stability and in a more permanent man- 
ner (being joined to solid nuclei as it were). Although on closer 
inspection the elements of all complexes. prove to be homogene- 
ous, yet in spite of the knowledge of this fact, the early notion 
of an antithesis of body and spirit easily regains the ascendancy 
in the mind. The philosophical spiritualist is often sensible of 
the difficulty of imparting the needed solidity to his mind- 
created world of bodies; the materialist is at a loss when required 
to endow the world of matter with sensation. The monistic 
 
-P-A-G-E-626
  604 ERNST MACH 
point of view, which artificial reflexion has evolved, is easily 
clouded by our older and more powerful instinctive notions. 
7. The difficulty referred to is particularly felt in the follow- 
ing case. Inthecomplex A BC . . ., which we have called the 
world of matter, we find as parts, not only our own body K L M 
. . ., but also the bodies of other persons (or animals) K’ L’ M’ 
... KL" M". . ., to which, by analogy, we imagine other 
a’ Bly’... , a BY" y"’.. ., annexed, similar toaBy . . .So 
long as we deal with K’ L’ M’ .. ., we find ourselves in a 
thoroughly familiar province at every point sensorially acces- 
sible to us. When, however, we inquire after the sensations or 
feelings appurtenant to the body K’ L’ M’ . . ., we no longer 
find the elements we seek in the province of sense: we add them 
in thought. Not only is the domain which we now enter far less 
familiar to us, but the transition into it is also relatively un- 
safe. We have the feeling as if we were plunging into an abyss. 
Persons who adopt this method only, will never thoroughly rid 
themselves of this sense of insecurity, which is a frequent source 
of illusive problems. 
But we are not restricted to this course. Let us consider, 
first, the reciprocal relations of the elements of the complex 
ABC... ., without regarding K LM... (our body). All 
physical investigations are of this sort. A white bullet falls 
upon a bell; a sound is heard. The bullet turns yellow before a 
sodium lamp, red before a lithium lamp. Here the elements 
(A BC. . .) appear to be connected only with one another and 
to be independent of our body (K LM .. .). But if we take 
santonine, the bullet again turns yellow. If we press one eye 
to the side, we see two bullets. If we close our eyes entirely, 
we see none at all. If we sever the auditory nerve, no sound is 
heard. The elements A BC . . ., therefore, are not only con- 
nected among one another, but also with K L M. To this ex- 
tent, and to this extent only, do we callA BC .. . sensations, 
and regard A B C as belonging to the ego. In this way, accord- 
ingly, we do not find the gap between bodies and sensations 
above described, between what is without and what is within,
-P-A-G-E-627
  ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS 605 
between the material world and the spiritual world.’ All ele- 
ments A BC...,K LM... constitute a single coherent 
mass only, in which, when any one element is disturbed, all is 
put in motion; except that a disturbance inK LM... has 
a more extensive and profound action than in A BC. A magnet 
in our neighborhood disturbs the particles of iron near it; a 
falling boulder shakes the earth; but the severing of a nerve 
sets in motion the whole system of elements. 
8. That traditional gulf between physical and psychological 
research, accordingly, exists only for the habitual stereotyped 
method of observation. A color is a physical object so long as 
we consider its dependence upon its luminous source, upon other 
colors, upon heat, upon space, and so forth. Regarding, how- 
ever, its dependence upon the retina(the elements K LM. . . ) 
it becomes a psychological object, a sensation. Not the sub- 
ject, but the direction of our investigation, is different in the 
two domains. 
Both in reasoning from the observation of the bodies of other 
men or animals, to the sensations which they possess, as well 
as in investigating the influence of our own body upon our own 
sensations, we must complete observed facts by analogy. This 
is accomplished with much greater readiness and certainty, 
when it relates, say, only to nervous processes, which cannot be 
fully observed in our own bodies — that is, when it is carried 
out in the more familiar physical domain — than when it is 
made in connexion with psychical processes. Otherwise there 
is no essential difference. 
to. Reference has already been made to the different char- 
acter of the groups of elements designated by A BC . . . and 
aBy. Asa matter of fact, when we see a green tree before us, 
or remember a green tree, that is, represent a green tree to our- 
selves, we are perfectly aware of the difference of the two cases. 
The represented tree has a much less determinate, a much more 
1 Compare my Grundlinien der Lehre von den Bewegungsempfindungen, Leipsic, 
Engelmann, 1875, p. 54.
-P-A-G-E-628
  606 ERNST MACH 
changeable form; its green is much paler and more evanescent; 
and, what is of especial note, it is plainly situated in a different 
domain. A movement that we propose to execute is never more 
than a represented movement, and appears in a different sphere 
from that of the executed movement, which always takes place 
when the image is vivid enough. The statement that the ele- 
ments A and a appear in different spheres, means, if we go to 
the bottom of it, simply this, that these elements are united 
with different other elements. Thus far, therefore, the funda- 
mental constituents of ABC. . .,a8y ... would scem to be 
the same (colors, sounds, spaces, times, motor sensations. . . ), 
and only the character of their connexion different. 
Ordinarily pleasure and pain are regarded as different from 
sensations. Yet not only tactile sensations, but all other kinds 
of sensations, may pass gradually into pleasure and pain. Plea- 
sure and pain also may be justly termed sensations. Only they 
are not so well analysed and so familiar as the common sensa- 
tions. In fact, sensations of pleasure and pain, however faint 
they may be, really, make up the contents of all so-called emo- 
tions. Thus, perceptions, ideas, volition, and emotion, in 
short the whole inner and outer world, are composed of a small 
number of homogeneous elements connected in relations of vary- 
ing evanescence or permanence. Usually, these elements are 
called sensations. But as vestiges of a one-sided theory inhere 
in that term, we prefer to speak simply of elements, as we have 
already done. The aim of all research is to ascertain the mode 
of connexion of these elements.! 
11. That in this complex of elements, which fundamentally 
is one, the boundaries of bodies and of the ego do not admit of 
being established in a manner definite and sufficient for all cases, 
has already been remarked. The comprehending of the elements 
that are most intimately connected with pleasure and pain, 
under one ideal mental-economical unity, the ego, is a work of 
the highest significance for the intellect in the functions which 
1 Compare the note at the conclusion of my treatise, Die Geschichte und die 
Wurzel des Satzes der Erhaltung der Arbeit, Prague, Calve, 1872.
-P-A-G-E-629
ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS 607 
it performs for the pain-avoiding, pleasure-seeking will. The 
delimitation of the ego, therefore, is instinctively effected, 
is rendered familiar, and possibly becomes fixed through hered- 
ity. Owing to their high practical value, not only for the in- 
dividual, but for the entire species, the composites “ego” and 
“body” assert instinctively their claims, and operate with all 
the power of natural elements. In special cases, however, in 
which practical ends are not concerned, but where knowledge 
is an object in itself, the delimitation in question may prove to 
be insufficient, obstructive, and untenable.' 
The primary fact is not the J, the ego, but the elements (sen- 
sations). Theelements constitute the J. That J have the sensa- 
tion green, signifies that the element green occurs in a given 
complex of other elements (sensations, memories). When I 
cease to have the sensation green, when J die, then the ele- 
ments no longer occur in their ordinary, familiar way of asso- 
ciation. That is all. Only an ideal mental-economical unity, 
not a real unity, has ceased to exist. 
If a knowledge of the connexion of the elements (sensations) 
does not suffice us, and we ask, Who possesses this connexion 
of sensations, Who experiences the sensations? then we have 
succumbed to the habit of subsuming every element (every 
sensation) under some wnanalysed complex, and we are fall- 
ing back imperceptibly upon an older, lower and more limited 
point of view. 
' The so-called unity of consciousness is not an argument in 
point. Since the apparent antithesis of real world and perceived 
world is due entirely to our mode of view, and no actual gulf 
1 Similarly, esprit de corps, class bias, national pride, and even the narrowest 
minded local patriotism may have a high value, for certain purposes. But such 
attitudes will not be shared by the broad-minded inquirer, at least not in mo- 
ments of research. All such egoistic views are adequate only for practical pur- 
poses. Of course, even the inquirer may succumb to habit. Trifling pedantries 
and nonsensical discussions, the cunning appropriation of others’ thoughts, with 
perfidious silence as to the sources, the metaphorical dysphagia suffered when 
recognition must be given, and the crooked illumination of others’ performances 
when this is done, abundantly show that the scientist and scholar have also the 
battle of existence to fight, that the ways of science still lead to the mouth, and 
that the pure quest of knowledge in our present social conditions is still an ideal.

exists between them, a rich and variously interconnected con- 
tent of consciousness is in no respect more difficult to under- 
stand than a rich and diversified interconnexion of the world. 
If we regard the ego as a real unity, we become involved in 
the following dilemma: either we must set over against the ego 
a world of unknowable entities (which would be quite idle and 
purposeless), or we must regard the whole world, the egos of 
other people included, as comprised in our own ego (a proposi- 
tion to which it is difficult to yield serious assent). 
But if we take the ego simply as a practical unity, put to- 
gether for purposes of provisional survey, or simply as a more 
strongly coherent group of elements, less strongly connected 
with other groups of this kind, questions like those above dis- 
cussed will not arise and research will have an unobstructed 
future. 
In his philosophical notes Lichtenberg says: “We become 
conscious of certain percepts that are not dependent upon us; 
of others that we at least think are dependent upon us. Where 
is the border-line? We know only the existence of our sensa- 
tions, percepts, and thoughts. We should say, It thinks, just 
as we say, it lightens. It is going too far to say cogito, if we 
translate cogito by I think. The assumption, or postulation, of 
the ego is a mere practical necessity.”” Though the method by 
which Lichtenberg arrived at this result is somewhat different 
from ours, we must nevertheless give our full assent to his con- 
clusion. 
12. Bodies do not produce sensations, but complexes of 
sensations (complexes of elements) make up bodies. If, to the 
physicist, bodies appear the real, abiding existences, whilst 
sensations are regarded merely as their envanescent, transitory 
show, the physicist forgets, in the assumption of such a view, 
that all bodies are but thought-symbols for complexes of sens- 
ations (complexes of elements). Here, too, the elements form 
the real, immediate, and ultimate foundation, which it is the 
task of physiological research to investigate. By the recogni- 
tion of this fact, many points of psychology and physics as-
-P-A-G-E-631
    ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS 609 
sume more distinct and more economical forms, and many 
spurious problems are disposed of. 
For us, therefore, the world does not consist of mysterious 
entities, which by their interaction with another, equally mys- 
terious entity, the ego, produce sensations, which alone are 
accessible. For us, colors, sounds, spaces, times, . . . are the 
ultimate elements, whose given connexion it is our business to 
investigate. In this investigation we must not allow ourselves 
to be impeded by such intellectual abridgments and delimita- 
tions, as body, ego, matter, mind, etc., which have been formed 
for special, practical purposes and with wholly provisional and 
limited ends in view. On the contrary, the fittest forms of 
thought must be created in and by that research itself, just as is 
done in every special science. In place of the traditional, in- 
stinctive ways of thought, a freer, fresher view, conforming to 
developed experience, must be substituted. 
13. Science always takes its origin in the adaptation of 
thought to some definite field of experience. The results of the 
adaptation are thought-elements, which are able to represent 
the field. The outcome, of course, is different, according to the 
character and extent of the province surveyed. If the province 
of experience in question is enlarged, or if several provinces 
heretofore disconnected are united, the traditional, familiar 
thought-elements no longer suffice for the extended province. 
In the struggle of acquired habit with the effort after adapta- 
tion, problems arise, which disappear when the adaptation is 
perfected, to make room for others which have arisen in the 
interim. 
To the physicist, gu@ physicist, the idea of ‘‘ body” is pro- 
ductive of a real facilitation of view, and is not the cause of 
disturbance. So, also, the person with purely practical aims, is 
materially assisted by the idea of the I or ego. For, unques- 
tionably, every form of thought that has been designedly or 
undesignedly constructed for a given purpose, possesses for that 
purpose a permanent value. When, however, research in phy- 
sics and in psychology meets, the ideas held in the one domain
-P-A-G-E-632
610 ERNST MACH 
prove to be untenable in the other. From the attempt at mu- 
tual adaptation arise the various atomic and monadic theories 
— which, however, never attain their end. If we regard sens- | 
ations, in the sense above defined, as the elements of the world, 
the problems referred to are practically disposed of, and the 
first and most important adaptation effected. This fundamen- 
tal view (without any pretension to being a philosophy for all 
eternity) can at present be adhered to in all provinces of expe- 
rience; it is consequently the one that accommodates itself 
with the least expenditure of energy, that is, more economically 
than any other, to the present temporary collective state of know- 
ledge. Furthermore, in the consciousness of its purely econom- 
ical office, this fundamental view is eminently tolerant. It does 
not obtrude itself into provinces in which the current concep- 
tions are still adequate. It is ever ready, upon subsequent 
extensions of the domain of experience, to yield the field to a 
better conception. 
The philosophical point of view of the average man — if that 
term may be applied to the naive realism of the ordinary indi- 
vidual— has a claim to the highest consideration. It has arisen 
in the process of immeasurable time without the conscious as- 
sistance of man. It is a product of nature, and is preserved and 
sustained by nature. Everything that philosophy has accom- 
plished — the biological value of every advance, nay, of every 
error, admitted — is, as compared with it, but an insignificant 
and ephemeral product of art. The fact is, every thinker, every 
philosopher, the moment he is forced to abandon his narrow 
intellectual province by practical necessity, immediately returns 
to the universal point of view held by all men in common. 
To discredit this point of view is not then the purpose of the 
foregoing ‘‘introductory remarks.”’ The task which we have 
set ourselves is simply to show why and to what purpose for the 
greatest portion of life we hold it, and why and for what purpose 
we are provisorily obliged to abandon it. No point of view has 
absolute, permanent validity. Each has importance only for 
some given end.   1 A kindred view will be found in Avenarius, Kritik der reinen Erfahrung.

ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS 611 
THE SPACE-SENSATIONS 
1. THE tree with its hard, rough grey trunk, its numberless 
branches swayed by the wind, its smooth soft, shining leaves, 
appears to us at firsta single, indivisible whole. In like manner, 
we regard the sweet, round, yellow fruit, the warm, bright fire, 
with its manifold moving tongues, as a single thing. One name 
designates the whole, one word draws forth from the depths of 
oblivion all associated memories, as if they were strung upon 
a single thread. 
The reflexion of the tree, the fruit, or the fire in a mirror is 
visible, but not tangible. When we turn our glance away or 
close our eyes, we can touch the tree, taste the fruit, feel the 
fire, but we cannot see them. Thus the apparently indivisible 
thing is separated into parts, which are not only connected with 
one another but are also joined to other conditions. The visible 
is separable from the tangible, from that which may be tasted, 
The visible also appears at first sight to be a single thing. 
But we may see a round, yellow fruit together with a yellow, 
star-shaped blossom. A second fruit is just as round as the first, 
but is green or red. Two things may be alike in color but unlike 
in form; they may be different in colour but like in form. Thus 
sensations of sight are separable into color-sensations and space- 
sensations. 
2. Color-sensation, into the details of which we shall not 
enter here, is essentially a sensation of favorable or unfavor- 
able chemical conditions of life. In the process of adaptation to 
these conditions, color-sensation may have been developed and 
modified. Light introduces organic life. The green chlorophyll 
and the (complementary) red hemoglobin play a prominent 
part in the chemical processes of the plant-body and in the con- 
trary processes of the animal body. The two substances pre- 
sent themselves to us in the most varied modifications of tint. 
The discovery of the visual purple, observations in photogra- 
 
-P-A-G-E-634
    612 ERNST MACH 
phy and photochemistry render the conception of processes of 
sight as chemical processes permissible. The réle which color 
plays in analytical chemistry, in spectrum-analysis, in crystal- 
lography, is well known. It suggests a new conception for the 
so-called vibrations of light, according to which they are re- 
garded, not as mechanical, but as chemical vibrations, as suc- 
cessive union and separation, as an oscillatory process of the 
same sort that takes place, though only in one direction, in 
photo-chemical phenomena. This conception, which is sub- 
stantially supported by recent investigations in abnormal dis- 
persion, accords with the electro-magnetic theory of light. In 
the case of electrolysis, in fact, chemistry yields the most in- 
telligible conception of the electric current, regarding the two 
components of the electrolyte as passing through each other in 
opposite directions. It is likely, therefore, that in a future 
theory of colors, many biologico-psychological and chemico- 
physical threads will be united. 
3. Adaptation to the chemical conditions of life which mani- 
fest themselves in color, renders locomotion necessary to a far 
greater extent than adaptation to those which manifest them- 
selves through taste and smell. At least this is so in the case of 
man, concerning whom alone we are able to judge with immed- 
iacy and certainty. The close association of space-sensation (a 
mechanical factor) with color-sensation (a chemical factor) is 
herewith rendered intelligible. We shall now proceed to the 
analysis of space-sensations. 
4. In examining two figures which are alike but differently 
colored (for example, two letters of the same size and shape, but 
of different colors), we recognise their sameness 
[N i of form at the first glance, in spite of the differ- 
N iN ence of color-sensation. The sight-perceptions, 
therefore, must contain some like sensation- 
components. These are the space-sensations — 
which are the same in the two cases. Fig. x.
-P-A-G-E-635
  ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS 613 
5. We will now investigate the character of the space-sens- 
ations that physiologically condition the recognition of a fig- 
ure. First, it is clear that this recognition is not the result 
of geometrical considerations — which are a matter, not of 
sensation, but of intellect. On the contrary, the space-sensa- 
tions in question serve as the starting-point and foundation 
of all geometry. Two figures may be geometrically congruent, 
but physiologically quite different. . . . 
6. In what, now, does the essential nature of optical similar- 
ity, as contrasted with geometrical similarity, consist? In geo- 
metrically similar figures, all homologous distances are propor- 
tional. But this is an affair of the intellect, not of sensation. 
If we place beside a triangle with the sides a, 6, c, a triangle 
with the sides 2a, 2b, 2c, we do not recognise the simple rela- 
tion of the two immediately, but intellectually, by measure- 
ment. If the similiarity is to become optically perceptible, the 
proper position must be added. That a simple intellectual re- 
lationship of two objects does not necessarily condition a sim- 
ilarity of sensation, may be perceived by comparing two tri- 
angles having respectively the sides a, 6, c, and a+m, b+m, 
ct+m. The two triangles do not look at all alike. Similarly all 
conic sections do not look alike, although all stand in a simple 
geometric relation to each other; still less do curves of the third 
order exhibit optical similiarity; etc. 
7. The geometrical similarity of two figures is determined 
by all their homologous lines being proportional or by all their 
homologous angles being equal. 
But to appear optically similar 
the figures must also be similarly 
situated, that is all their homo- 
lJogous lines must be parallel or, 
as we prefer tosay, have the 
same direction (Fig.2). By likeness of direction, accordingly, 
are determined like space-sensations, and these are character- 
istic of the physiologico-optical similarity of figures. 
We may obtain an idea of the physiological significance of 
 
-P-A-G-E-636
  614 ERNST MACH 
the direction of a given straight line or curve-element, by the 
following reflexion. Let y = f (x) be the equation of a plane 
curve. We can read at a glance the course of the values of dy/dx 
on the curve, for they are determined by its slope; and the eye 
gives us, likewise, qualitative information concerning the values 
of d°y/dx?, for they are characterised by the curvature. The 
question naturally presents itself why can we not arrive at as 
immediate conclusions concerning the values d*y/dx*, d‘y/dx', 
etc. The answer is easy. What we see are not the differential 
coefficients, which are an intellectual affair, but only the direc- 
tion of the curve-elements, and the declination of the direction 
of one curve-element from that of another. 
In fine, since we are immediately cognisant of the similarity 
of figures lying in similar positions, and are also able to distin- 
guish without ado the special case of congruity, therefore our 
space-sensations yield us information concerning likeness or un- 
likeness of directions and equality or inequality of spatial dimen- 
sions. 
8. It is extremely probable that sensations of space are pro- 
duced by the motor apparatus of the eye. Without entering 
into particulars, we may observe, first, that the whole appara- 
tus of the eye, and especially the motor apparatus, is symmet- 
rical with respect to the median plane of the head. Hence, 
symmetrical movements of looking will determine like or ap- 
proximately like space-sensations. Children constantly con- 
found the letters b and d, as p and qg. Adults, too, do not 
readily notice a change from left to right unless some special 
points of apprehension for sense or intellect render it percept- 
ible. The symmetry of the motor apparatus of the eye is very 
perfect. The like excitation of its symmetrical organs would, 
by itself scarcely account for the distinction of right and left. 
But the whole human body, especially the brain, is affected 
with a slight asymmetry, — which leads, for example, to the pre- 
ference of one (generally the right) hand, in motor functions. 
And this leads, again, to a further and better development of 
the motor functions of the right side, and to a modification of 
 
-P-A-G-E-637
BON eRe renee EN PRE er ty Oe ER Ee eee ern Cee ne Re Tre nT ae Oe eae 
ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS 615 
the attendant sensations. After the space-sensations of the eye 
have become associated, through writing, with the motor func- 
tions of the right hand, a confusion of those vertically symmet- 
rical figures with which the art and habit of writing are con- 
cerned no longer ensues. This association may, indeed, become 
so strong that remembrance follows only the accustomed tracks, 
and we read, for example, the reflexion of written or printed 
words in a mirror only with the greatest difficulty. The con- 
fusion of right and left still occurs, however, with regard to 
figures which have no motor, but only a purely optical (for ex- 
ample, ornamental) interest. A noticeable difference between 
right and left must be felt, moreover, by animals, as in many 
predicaments they have no other means of finding their way. 
The similarity of sensations connected with symmetrical motor 
functions is easily remarked by the attentive observer. If, for 
example, supposing my right hand to be employed, I grasp a 
micrometer-screw or a key with my left hand, I am certain (un- 
less I reflect beforehand) to turn it in the wrong direction, — 
that is, I always perform the movement which is symmetrical to 
the usual movement, confusing the two because of the similar- 
ity of the sensation. The observations of Heidenhain regard- 
ing the reflected writing of persons hypnotised on one side 
should also be cited in this connexion. 
With looking upwards and looking downwards, fundament- 
ally different space-sensations are associated, as ordinary ob- 
servations will show. This is, moreover, comprehensible, since 
the motor apparatus of the eye is asymmetrical with respect to 
a horizontal plane. The direction of gravity is so very decisive 
and important for the motor apparatus of the rest of the body 
that the same factor has assuredly also found its expression in 
the apparatus of the eye, which serves the rest. It is well known 
that the symmetry of a landscape and of its reflexion in water is 
not felt. The portrait of a familiar personage, when turned 
upside down, is strange and puzzling to a person who does not 
recognise it intellectually. If we place ourselves behind the 
head of a person lying upon a couch and unreflectingly give 
ourselves up to the impression which the face makes upon us,  
-P-A-G-E-638
  616 ; ERNST MACH 
we shall find that it is altogether strange, especially when the 
person speaks. The letters 6 and #, and d and gq, are not con- 
fused by children. : 
Our previous remarks concerning symmetry, similarity, and 
the rest, naturally apply not only to plane figures, but also to 
those in space. Hence, we have yet a remark to add concern- 
ing the sensation of space-depth. Looking at objects afar off 
and looking at objects near at hand determine different sensa- 
tions. These sensations must not be confused, because of the 
supreme importance of the difference between near and far, 
both for animals and human beings. They cannot be confused 
because the motor apparatus is asymmetrical with respect to a 
plane perpendicular to the direction from front to rear. The 
observation that the bust of a familiar personage cannot be 
replaced by the mould in which the bust is cast is quite 
analogous to the observations consequent upon the inversion 
of objects. 
g. Ifequal distances and like directions excite like space-sens- 
ations, and directions symmetrical with respect to the median 
plane of the head excite similar space-sensations, the explana- 
tion of the above-cited facts is not far to seek. The straight 
line has, in all its elements, the same direction, and everywhere 
excites the same space-sensations. Herein consists its esthetic 
value. Moreover, straight lines which lie in the median plane 
or are perpendicular to it are brought into special relief by the 
circumstance that, through this position of symmetry, they 
occupy a like position to the two halves of the visual apparatus. 
Every other position of the straight line is felt as awryness, or 
as a deviation from the position of symmetry. 
The repetition of the same space-figure in the same position 
conditions a repetition of the same space-sensation. All lines 
connecting prominent (noticeable) homologous points have the 
same direction and excite the same sensation. Likewise when 
merely geometrically similar figures are placed side by side in 
the same positions, this relation holds. The sameness of the 
dimensions alone is absent. But when the positions are dis-
-P-A-G-E-639
  ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS 617 
turbed, this relation, and with it, the impression of unity — 
the esthetic impression — are also disturbed. 
In a figure symmetrical with respect to the median plane, 
similar space-sensations corresponding to the symmetrical di- 
rections take the place of the identical space-sensations. The 
right half of the figure stands in the same relation to the right 
half of the visual apparatus as the left half of the figure does to 
the left half of the visual apparatus. If we alter the sameness 
of the dimensions, the sensation of symmetrical similarity is 
still felt. An oblique position of the plane of symmetry dis- 
turbs the whole effect. 
If we turn a figure through 180°, contrasting it with itself in 
its original position, centric symmetry is produced. That is, if 
two pairs of homologous points be connected, the connecting 
lines will cut each other at a point O, through which, as their 
point of bisection, all lines connecting homologous points will 
pass. Moreover, in the case of centric symmetry, all lines of 
connexion between homologous points have the same direction, 
— a fact which produces an agreeable sensation. If the same- 
ness of the dimensions is eliminated, there still remains, for 
sensation, centrically symmetrical similarity. 
Regularity appears to have no special physiological value, 
in distinction from symmetry. The value of regularity prob- 
ably lies rather in its manifold symmetry, which is perceptible 
in more than one single position. 
1o. The correctness of these observations will be apparent 
on glancing over the work of Owen Jones— A Grommar of 
Ornament (London, 1865). In almost every plate one finds 
new and different kinds of symmetry as fresh testimony in 
favor of the conceptions above advanced. The art of decora- 
tion, which, like pure instrumental music, aims at no ulterior 
end, but ministers only to pleasure in form (and color), is 
the best source of material for our present studies. Writing 
is governed by other considerations than that of beauty. 
Nevertheless, we find among the twenty-four large Latin letters 
ten which are vertically symmetrical (A, H, I, M, O, T, V, 
 
-P-A-G-E-640
  618 ERNST MACH 
W, X, Y), five which are horizontally symmetrical (B, C, D, 
E, K), three which are centrically symmetrical (N, S, Z), and 
only six which are unsymmetrical (F, G, L, P, Q, R). 
11. It is to be remarked again that the geometrical and the 
physiological properties of a figure in space are to be sharply 
distinguished. The physiological properties are determined by 
the geometrical properties coincidently with these, but are not 
determined by these solely. On the other hand, physiological 
properties very probably gave the first impulse to geometrical 
investigations. The straight line doubtless attracted attention 
not because of its being the shortest line between two points, 
but because of its physiological simplicity. The plane likewise 
possesses, in addition to its geometrical properties, a special 
physiologico-optical (esthetic) value, which claims notice for 
it, as will be shown later on. The division of the plane and of 
space by right angles has not only the advantage of producing 
equal parts, but also an additional and special symmetry-value. 
The circumstance that congruent and similar geometrical fig- 
ures can be brought into positions where their relationship is 
physiologically felt, led, no doubt, to an earlier investigation of 
these kinds of geometrical relationship than of those that are 
less noticeable, such as affinity, collineation, and others. With- 
out the co-operation of sense-perception and understanding, a 
scientific geometry is inconceivable. . . .

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TONE 
Translated from the German* by 
. BENJAMIN RAND 
§ 19. THE DEGREES OF TONAL FUSION 
1. What tonal fusion is and what it is not. 
Ir has already been mentioned in what precedes, that not 
merely do simultaneous as contrasted with successive tones 
enter into a special relation in sensation, which renders their 
analysis difficult, but that also there are differences in this 
respect among simultaneous tones, according to the numerical 
ratio of their vibrations. We must now turn our attention to 
this fact. I will first illustrate it by two extreme examples. 
If two tones, the number of whose vibrations are related as 
1:2, are simultaneously produced, they can be very imperfectly 
discriminated in comparison with the case where, for example, 
under otherwise precisely similar conditions, the ratio is as 40:77. 
When I say, “imperfectly,” I mean that the question is not as 
to a difficulty, which might be overcome by increased attention 
and practise, but as to an unchangeable characteristic of thema- 
terial of sensation, which persists even after all other obstacles to 
an analysis have been removed, and which, moreover, after the 
analysis is completed and the tones clearly recognized as two, 
can first likewise be perceived in itself. In 40:77 the tones in the 
sensation appear so to speak farther apart than in the case of 
1:2, so that in the first case even the unmusical person is less, 
or not at all, in danger of taking them for one; whereas on the 
contrary, the octave tones cannot be kept distinct even by the 
* From C. Stumpf’s Tonpsychologie, Leipzig, 1890, Bd. 1.
-P-A-G-E-642
  620 CARL STUMPF 
most delicate and practised ear, in the same degree as those of 
the seventh, or of the unmusical relation 40:77. When the un- 
practised designate simultaneous octave tones as one tone, 
there is accordingly a double hindrance to analysis, namely: 
one an imperfect practise, and the other in the tone itself; one, 
which influences the judgment directly, and the other which 
influences the sensation and in consequence of it the judgment. 
What is most essential for the general characterisation of the 
concept of fusion, as we understand it, has been fairly exhausted 
in what has been said,!and can be set forth still more clearly 
only in the more inclusive range of a universal theory of rela- 
tions, which is one of the most urgent needs of philosophical 
science. We term fusion that relation of two contents, especially 
sensation-contents, in which they form not a mere sum, but a 
whole. The consequence of this relation is, that in its higher 
degrees the total impression under otherwise like conditions 
approaches more and more that of a single unified sensation, 
and becomes more and more difficult to analyze. These results 
can also be employed for a definition, and we can say: fusion is 
that relation of two sensations as a consequence of which, etc. 
But in either way, the matter would remain an empty concept 
for everyone to whom the phenomena in question, and espe- 
cially the phenomena of tones, were foreign. The real truth of 
the assertion, that sensations form a whole and approximate 
more or less the impression of a single unified sensation, can 
after all be learned only by means of examples. 
Nevertheless, I remark, that the inclusion of the concept of 
tonal fusion under that more general quality of simultaneous 
as opposed to successive sensations, of which we have elsewhere 
spoken, is not indispensable for what follows. The tonal fusion 
will acquire for us more and more an interest of its own, inde- 
pendent of the questions previously discussed (§ 16 and 17); 
and would also claim it even if a similar relation did not further 
occur in the entire domain of sensations. It is far from being 
an hypothesis devised for the solution of those difficulties. It is 
a sensuous phenomena which was observed even before those 
1 Cf. Stumpf’s Tonpsychologie, p. 64 f.
-P-A-G-E-643
  
PSYCHOLOGY OF TONE 621 
theoretical difficulties appeared within the intellectual horizon. 
It suffices perfectly for the attainment of the concept here 
necessary, to perceive and in perceiving to contrast, the dif- 
ferences of the cases which exist already within the tonal do- 
main, and which will be more accurately described in what fol- 
lows. We must hear and compare tonal fusions, just as we must 
hear and contrast tones, in order to know what a tone is. 
Perhaps, however, it is expedient to preclude expressly some 
misconceptions which the term fusion might occasion. It is 
precisely one of those psychological expressions which have 
been most misused, and to which the most impossible concep- 
tions and entirely fictitious theories have become attached. 
For this reason I have chosen it with reluctance, owing to the 
lack of a safer and at the same time more specific word. 
It is above all, therefore, not meant by fusion, that two simul- 
taneous tones coalesce in a certain unity in consciousness only 
by degrees, however quickly. Fusion signifies to us here not a 
process, but a present relation. I would, therefore, rather use 
“blend” (Schmelz), or “coalescence” (Schmalz), if this had 
also not its objections. Such expressions also as“ to separate” 
(auseinandertreten) etc., are to be understood in this sense of 
an already existent being; just as they are likewise used in the 
sense of rest in the description of architectonic forms. 
That fusion is not to be viewed as originating a third tonal 
quality in addition to or instead of the other two, needs no 
farther amplification after what has preceded (§ 16 and 17). 
Henceforth we must reject especially the metaphorical use of 
spatial concepts. The naturalist is accustomed to think of 
everything by the aid of spatial analogies; and psychologists 
also, like Herbart and Beneke, who desire to approach the 
exactness of natural science, employ them most extensively for 
their psychological descriptions (such as, falling and rising, 
overflowing, etc.). We are to disregard all such analogies as 
might erroneously suggest them. Everything extended in space 
is either outside, or identical with everything else. But simul- 
taneous tones afford us an example of interpenetration; and, 
indeed, an interpenetration of a lower and higher degree. The
-P-A-G-E-644
  622 CARL STUMPF 
lack of all spatial perceptibility is wholly immaterial. It is, 
however, wanting in the relation of quality and intensity. 
Spatial perceptivity ceases moreover with psychical states as 
such (cf. § 100-104). The concepts here too must be adapted 
to the observations. Only a contradiction is a priori an im- 
possibility. But that the two tones are at the same time one, 
is not affirmed. 
In general the difficulties, which one still could, and will find, 
in the concept of tonal fusion, as it is here understood, are 
bound to be of a similar kind and origin to those raised from 
time immemorial against the concept of motion. And as the 
physicist gets rid of these after the example of Diogenes, who 
stepping from his tub walked about with a “solvitur ambu- 
lando,” so here in a similar manner the first thing we have to do 
is to oppose to all reasoning a “ solvitur audiendo.” But then 
here as there, it becomes evident that the difficulties are 
avoided, the moment that the mixture of heterogeneous con- 
cepts is avoided. 
Finally it is to be remarked, that the expression and concept 
of fusion stands here in no relation, either essentially or his- 
torically, with the general psychological doctrine of Herbart, in 
which “fusion” plays such a prominent part; and which for the 
sake of clearness everyone, who has knowledge of it, is asked 
for the present to banish from his mind. Ina subsequent chap- 
ter, where the cause and origin of fusion are treated, we will 
attempt to show how far Herbart’s theory of fusion in general, 
and of tonal fusion in particular, is from being correct. 
Our conception of fusion has also not many points of contact 
with the ideas which have been brought forward under the 
same name oftentimes in the most recent psychology, and 
in my judgment on every occasion is in contradiction with the 
truth. 
2. The Degrees of Fusion 
If in the first place we confine ourselves to a tonal domain, 
which is limited by the ratio of vibrations 1:2, I remark the
-P-A-G-E-645
PSYCHOLOGY OF TONE 623 
following degrees of different tones, from the highest to the 
lowest. 
First the fusion of the octave (1:2). 
Secondly that of the fifth (2:3). 
Thirdly that of the fourth (3:4). 
Fourthly that of the so-called natural thirds and sixths 
(4:5, 5:6, 3:5, 5:8), between which I find in this respect no 
clear distinctions. 
Fifthly that of all the remaining musical and unmusical tonal 
combinations, which, for my hearing at least, offer no discern- 
ible differences of fusion, but on the contrary all the least degree 
of it. At most the so-called natural seventh (4:7) could 
indeed fuse somewhat more than the others. 
If we employ here the modern names of the intervals, and the 
general expression interval itself, we do so not in any musical 
sense at all, but only to have a known and short term for the 
numerical relations of vibrations with which we are here 
concerned. 
When we speak of degrees of fusion, we mean that we are 
dealing with the degrees of differences, which, as is well known, 
constantly pass over into one another, from the highest to the 
lowest degree. Further we make use also of the general expres- 
sion degrees of fusion. 
3. The Laws of Fusion 
The dependence of the degrees of fusion upon the so-called 
ratio of vibrations is the principal law of tonal fusion. In addi- 
tion to it stand the following: 
(a) The degree of fusion is independent of the tonal region. 
In the lowest pitch, where analysis meets with difficulties, the 
recognition and comparison of degrees of fusion become natu- 
rally difficult and impossible. But where it is possible, we find 
the fusion unchanged with the change of pitch, so long only as 
the ratio of vibrations of the two tones remain the same. 
Only in the very highest pitch, approximating about 4000 
vibrations, that is, from the octave five tones above the staff up- 
ward, do the differences of fusion appear to me, so far as I have 
 
-P-A-G-E-646
  624 CARL STUMPF 
yet been able to observe, to vanish. With tuning-forks 2000: 
3000 I still discern with full clearness the fusion of the fifth, 
whereas with 3000:5000, 5000:10000, etc., I can discern only the 
slightest degree of fusion at all. 
(0) The degree of fusion is also independent of the strength, 
whether indeed it be the absolute or the relative strength. 
That it is not changed by the mere change of the absolute 
strength of the two tones is at once clear. With the change of 
relative strength it is again noteworthy, that ultimately ana- 
lysis becomes impossible with great difference of strength, 
since the softer is suppressed by the stronger tone, so 
far as perception or even sensation is concerned. But so long 
as they remain distinguishable, I cannot notice any change of 
the degree of fusion. For example, if I make c and g at first of 
equal strength, then c noticeably stronger than g, or the 
reverse. 
(c) The degree of fusion of two given tones is in no way influ- 
enced by the addition at pleasure of a third and fourth tone. 
Indeed, a consonance is so much the less easily analyzed, the 
more tonesit contains, and becomes at last wholly confused and 
not analysable. But so long as two tones are at all distinguish- 
able in a composite sound, their fusion also is recognised as the 
same as if the two alone were sounded. 
In this proposition together with (0), there is also expressed 
the fact, that the overtones especially, and thereby the timbre, 
make no change in the ratio of two fundamental tones of mus- 
ical sounds, as is also confirmed by direct observation. 
(d) As in general the changes of stimulus below a certain 
degree effect no perceptible changes of sensation, so likewise 
very minute deviations of the number of vibrations from the 
abovementioned ratios create no perceptible change of the 
degree of fusion. If the deviation is increased, the fusion in all 
pairs of tones which do not belong to the very lowest degree 
of fusion, passes into this degree without running through the 
intermediate degrees, if any. And this transition occurs the 
more rapidly, (with the smaller relative differences of vibra- 
tions), the greater was the initial fusion.
-P-A-G-E-647
  PSYCHOLOGY OF TONE 625 
We say, as is known in the case of small but perceptible devi- 
ations, that the interval is ‘‘ out of tune” or “impure.” This 
saying possesses, as we may remark by anticipation, not 
merely a reference to the disagreeable feeling which is only a 
consequence of perception, but above all to an actual and 
perceived behavior of sensations. 
With regard to the size of the deviation in which the change 
of the degree of fusion is discernible, practise besides other cir- 
cumstances (e.g., pitch) makes a difference. But this forms no 
objection to the definition of the degree of fusion as a fact of 
sensation. As a sensation itself can change, so also can the ratio 
of two sensations, without the change being remarked; and this 
can be imperceptible to another through the equality of sensa- 
tions, (not merely of stimuli). 
(e) The fusion remains and retains its degree when both 
tones do not affect the same ear, but one is presented exclu- 
sively to the right, the other exclusively to the left. A tuning- 
fork of medium pitch, that is not sounded too loud, held before 
one ear is not perceived by the other, as we discover from the 
fact, that if the first is stopped up nothing is heard. If now we 
apply two forks which for example form a fifth, one to each ear, 
no difference is observable between this fusion, and the percep- 
tion by one and the same ear. On the contrary, the analysis 
can be facilitated by this process (cf § 23, 1 and 24, a). 
(f) Fusion remains also in the mere representation of the 
imagination. If I merely represent c and g as sounding at the 
same time, I can conceive them only as fusing, and indeed with 
the definite degree of fusion which they possess in the actual 
hearing. The same is true of any other two tones. A priori this 
is not necessarily to be expected, even if we recognise sensations 
and representations of the imagination in general as similar. 
Not all properties of simultaneous sensations pass over of neces- 
sity to the representation of the imagination: c and c sharpin 
actual hearing (upon the same ear) necessarily make vibrations, 
but in the imagination I can represent them perfectly without 
vibrations. Moreover, if I represent them as vibrating, I can 
represent them with slow or quick,.strong or weak vibra-
-P-A-G-E-648
  
  626 CARL STUMPF 
tions; whilst the choice of the degree of fusion is not free 
to me. 
In regard to the representation of the imagination we must 
accordingly complete the fundamental law as follows: Tones 
represented as simultaneous fuse in the degree which corre- 
sponds to the ratio of vibration of tones of the same pitch 
created objectively. 
(g) If we proceed above an octave, the same degrees of fusion 
recur with the rates of vibration increased one or more octaves. 
The ninths have the same fusion as the seconds, the tenths as 
the thirds, the double and triple octave as the octave; and in 
general m:n.2", the same as m:n, if m<nand x a small whole 
number. 
We must not be misled here by the greater ease of the ana- 
lysis. C and c‘4 sounding together are more easily and certainly 
analyzed by the unmusical than C and c, even thanC and G; 
although these two tones fuse less with one another than the 
former. The analysis depends upon very different conditions; 
it is peculiarly difficult especially in the lowest register; it is 
further facilitated by increase in the difference of pitch of the 
two tones. But if analysis takes place in both cases, we shall 
also further find, that C and c‘ are nevertheless in sensuous 
impression less perfectly sundered than C and G, and not more 
perfectly than C and c. 
If I compare the sounds of the tuning-fork CG with Cg, CA 
with Ca, etc., it is evident to me, that detection of difference 
between every second combination is always easier, but the 
fusion is the same as in the first. 
If I play upon the d! string of the violin the octave d!, and 
then the double octave d? (on the a! string), I have in both cases 
the same impression of homogeneity and of approximation to a 
real tonal unity. We can always for sake of contrast play 
the d in question with the free e? string; the difference of the 
fusion is always the same, that of the highest and of the lowest 
degree. 
If an orchestra plays the entire 7 octave tones from C up to 
c®, we still designate the impression as unison. The seven tones
-P-A-G-E-649
PSYCHOLOGY OF TONE 627 
are more homogeneous than the two tones ¢ and a, to say no- 
thing of c and b. We cannot here assume as true, that only the 
two neighboring members of the series always fuse with one 
another, C withc, c with c, etc., and that the farther removed do 
so only by means of the intermediate; for ifC and c> fuse by 
themselves less than C and c, or even ¢ and g, this could not be 
changed by means of the intervening octaves, according to (c). 
Moreover, the special laws enunciated in the preceding prin- 
ciples can be directly observed in the enlarged intervals them- 
selves. For example, thisis true of that presented under (0), the 
recognition of which with many possibly meets with difficulties. 
Play upon the piano first c alone and observe the overtone g* 
(the twelfth), which we clearly hear sound at the same time, in 
respect to its fusion with the fundamental tone. Now add g', 
by means of which this tone, too, becomes noticeably strength- 
ened: the fusion with ¢ remains unchanged. The fusion, there- 
fore, in the intervals beyond the octave is independent also of 
the relation of strength. 
4. Rules of observation 
Those who are skilled in the judgment of tones can test, 
whether what precedes corresponds to their own perceptions. 
Where it is a question of relations which are based on the 
material of sensation itself, there is, indeed, no fear that very 
great individual differences will appear in those hearing 
normally. It is rather to be expected, that those capable of 
judgment will find among themselves more and more harmony, 
the longer and more carefully they examine. But I will not by 
any means claim to have found the correct solution in each of 
the mentioned points, and to have expressed it in an entirely 
correct manner. 
It is necessary in these observations above everything to 
direct the attention exclusively upon the point in question, 
especially, therefore, to disregard theoretical knowledge of rela- 
tionship, etc.,as well as of the musical significance and position; 
and also to disregard the impression of feeling of an interval, 
whether it be harmonious or unharmonious, agreeable or dis- 
   
-P-A-G-E-650
  628 CARL STUMPF 
agreeable, and furthermore in a different way agreeable or 
disagreeable. The character and value of the feeling of an inter- 
val depends, indeed, as we shall show later, upon its degree of 
fusion; but yet not solely upon this. The most agreeable inter- 
val is not one of strongest fusion. The great seventh is in 
isolated state more disagreeable than the small; and this cannot 
be mistaken for a lesser fusion, or explained by that. It has other 
grounds. The same is true of the great and small third, etc. 
In general it will also be well first to take tones of the same 
sensation-strength, because then the danger is best avoided 
that any one of them should remain totally imperceptible or 
obscure. In order to produce similar strength of sensation in 
large intervals of tone, one must frequently — according to the 
instrument — give the higher tone with less physical strength. 
Further the greatest possible similarity in the initial utterance 
and duration of tone is naturally preferable, since inequalities of 
every kind divert the attention. Likewise, similar tone color is 
desirable, although this is of no influence in the fusion of the 
keynotes. Purity of interval, that is, exact harmony with the 
respective numbers of vibrations, is so much the more neces- 
sary, the more acute the hearing; although minimal variations, 
which can never be avoided, do no important injury to the 
fusion particularly in the lower grades. The piano with its 
tempered pitch permits the differences of the higher degrees 
still to appear (the octave is even here pure); but not between 
the last two degrees. It is even here c:d sharp = cre flat, and 
c:g sharp=c-a flat. 
But all these are measures of the kind that are matters of 
course for every observation. Nobody affirms that the phe- 
nomenon would be perceptible under only especially chosen 
circumstances. It is on the contrary in itself one of the most 
obvious, and so to speak most unavoidable, in the whole subject 
of unison. The entire task consists only in not confounding 
it with others which are based upon it, particularly with facts 
of judgment and of feeling (possibility and impossibility of 
analysis, pleasurableness and impleasureableness of an in- 
terval).
-P-A-G-E-651
  PSYCHOLOGY OF TONE 629 
5. Confirmation through unmusical persons 
For the guidance of my own judgment I have pursued still 
another method. As the question is here put, it can only be ad- 
dressed to those who are sufficiently endowed with power of 
tonal observations to analyze the fifths and octaves easily and 
directly. With such there exists only the difficulty last men- 
tioned, and many times previously touched upon, as to the 
dominating consciousness of the harmonious character and sen- 
sation-value of the interval. But we can obtain information 
also in an indirect way through unmusical persons, and those 
unpractised in the judgment of tones: by means of the use of 
the aforementioned difficulty of analysis. The different degrees 
of fusion must reveal themselves in the different degrees of dif- 
ficulty of analysis, if all the remaining circumstances upon 
which the latter depend are taken precisely equal. We shall 
recognise them in the results. In this way we can even obtain 
figures, by the enumeration of correct and false judgments, up- 
on the question, whether one or more tones are present in each 
interval. The combinations of more strongly fusing tones 
under otherwise similar conditions will more rarely be judged 
to be two tones than those fusing less strongly.

§ 20. THE CAUSE OF TONAL FUSION 
6. The cause of fusion is physiological 
All the attempts at the explanation of tonal fusion previously 
considered have been psychological. Their failure signifies, that 
we can by no means seek the source of tonal fusion in the 
psychological domain. In favor of this view from the outset 
appeared to be the circumstance, that such tonal fusion is a fact 
of sensation, a relation immanent in simultaneous tonal quali- 
ties, and independent of practice in the individual life. But 
relations of sensation, like the sensations themselves, are not 
referable to more remote causes, but only to physical. 
The physically objective characteristics of successive waves 
do not help usat all. To be sure, the total wave formed by two
-P-A-G-E-652
630 CARL STUMPF 
waves in the ratio 1: 2 is most similar to the simple sine-wave; 
then follows 2:3, 3:4, etc. more and more complicated forms. 
But these objective relations are, as was previously remarked, 
neither themselves the content of any sensation, nor the imme- 
diate cause of one; but on the contrary, they lie far back in the 
chain of causes. Moreover, if we consider it more closely from 
that standpoint, we find, that the so-called characteristic of the 
vibrations of the air disappear in the organ, if it is true here 
that every compound vibration is resolved into simple vibra- 
tions. Also as was previously mentioned, the circumstance that 
colors in which objectively the selfsame relations of vibrations 
occur, (r:2 in the extreme outer colors of the spectrum, 2:3 in 
blue and red, orange and indigo-violet, greenish-blue, and 
extreme red), reveal no phenomenon analogous to the tonal 
fusion, must prevent the objective forms of the waves from 
being made in any way responsible for the fusion. 
That also within the organ, especially of the labyrinth in the 
ear, the physical processes do not yet possess that characteris- 
tic which corresponds to the fusion of the tones in sensation, 
appears not merely from the just-mentioned isolated transmis- 
sion but also from the fact, that the fusion is perceptible in the 
same wav when the two tones are divided between the two ears, 
as well as when they are merely imagined. At least it would be 
a violent and improbable assumption, that the process creating 
fusion in the case of simultaneous hearing occurs in the ear 
itself, but in the division of the tones occurs first in the brain. 
Certain differences in the last processes of the centre of hear- 
ing must therefore correspond to the differences in the degrees 
of fusion as a physical correlate, or as a cause, (according as one 
thinks in a monistic or a dualistic way). But we know nothing 
of what nature these differences are, for this reason, 1f for no 
other, that in general we know nothing concerning the nature 
of the last processes. Indeed I must say, that although up to a 
certain point we can express in physical or chemical terms the 
occurrence of vibrations, competition, contrast, and other phe- 
nomena, in respect to the processes of the brain, which might 
lie at the basis of the phenomena of fusion, such a hypothetical
-P-A-G-E-653
PSYCHOLOGY OF TONE 631 
image does not even occur to me. Perhaps the practised fancy 
of certain mind readers will succeed better. But who knows, 
whether we shall not find ourselves gradually induced to recast 
or to extend our fundamental physical conceptions. Is it then a 
priori certain that the world beyond consciousness, (to which 
the brain indeed belongs), is spatial, and only spatial, or may 
be so conceived? Spatial properties are nothing but a small 
part of those which we abstract from our sense perceptions. We 
have found them serviceable for the rational construction of 
the external world, and for the derivation of its laws. But 
all other qualitative and remaining moments and relations 
of sensations have of themselves the same right to be trans- 
ferred to the external world. And possibly fusion is itself des- 
tined sometime to participate in this dignity; perchance in ap- 
plication to chemical processes. But this is a mere play with 
the possibilities of thought, and we will not in place of physio- 
logical indulge in metaphysiological fancies. 
If we are willing in the lack of adequate apprehension to con- 
tent ourselves with an abstract notion (which after all is no- 
thing but a word), we might once more speak of specific ener- 
gies. The specific energies, which lie at the foundation of fusion, 
have only this peculiarity, that they are not aroused by means 
of isolated stimuli, but by the concurrence of two stimuli. For 
this reason, we can call them specific energies of a higher rank, 
or still better, specific synergies. By such specific synergy we 
should therefore understand a determinate mode of codpera- 
tion of two nervous formations, having its ground in the struc- 
ture of the brain, of such a kind that whenever these two 
formations produce their corresponding sensations, there arises 
at the same time a determinate degree of fusion of these sensa- 
tions. As adequate and inadequate stimuli are distinguished in 
the production of sensations, by means of both of which never- 
theless one and the same quality of sensation is produced; so 
likewise a determinate degree of fusion is here not united as 
such exclusively and unconditionally to the “ adequate” stimu- 
lus-relation, (e.g., 1:2), but the same specific s:ergy can also, 
by way of exception, be aroused by another objective relation of 
 
-P-A-G-E-654
  632 CARL STUMPF 
vibration, and the octave relation, etc., be established in the 
sensation. On the other hand, these specific energies of higher 
rank are, to be sure, inseparably united with those of the first 
rank: for the fusion reveals itself constantly as the same be- 
tween two determinate qualities of tone. 
That fusion remains preserved in imagination, is not opposed 
to what has been said, but is only a new example in proof of the 
fact, that the mere ideas of the imagination have themselves a 
physical basis, and indeed in general the same as the sensations. 
In contrast to the theories of fusion already summarized, 
which give a very exact explanation concerning the process, our 
formulation must appear slight. But we would prefer honor- 
able poverty to suspicious wealth, and remain mindful of the 
fact, that everywhere no other formulation than one in such 
general and abstract terms, is as yet certainly possible for the 
immediate and ultimate bases of our entire sensational life.

CHAPTER XI. THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUS- 
NESS 
The order of our study must be analytic. We are now pre- 
pared to begin the introspective study of the adult conscious- 
ness itself. Most books adopt the so-called synthetic method. 
Starting with ‘simple ideas of sensation,’ and regarding these 
as so many atoms, they proceed to build up the higher states of 
mind out of their ‘ association,’ ‘ integration,’ or ‘ fusion,’ as 
houses are built by the agglutination of bricks. This has the 
didactic advantages which the synthetic method usually has. 
But it commits one beforehand to the very questionable theory 
that our higher states of consciousness are compounds of units; 
and instead of starting with what the reader directly knows, 
namely his total concrete states of mind, it starts with a set of 
supposed ‘simple ideas’ with which he has no immediate 
acquaintance at all, and concerning whose alleged interactions 
he is much at the mercy of any plausible phrase. On every 
ground, then, the method of advancing from the simple to the 
compound exposes us to illusion. All pedants and abstrac- 
tionists will naturally hate to abandon it. But a student who 
loves the fulness of human nature will prefer to follow the 
‘analytic’ method, and to begin with the most concrete facts, 
those with which he has a daily acquaintance in his own inner 
life. The analytic method will discover in due time the ele-

mentary parts, if such exist, without danger of precipitate as- 
sumption. The reader will bear in mind that our own chapters 
on sensation have dealt mainly with the physiological condi- 
tions thereof. They were put first as a mere matter of conven- 
ience, because incoming currents come first. Psychologically 
they might better have come last. Pure sensations were de- 
scribed [Psychology, page 12] as processes which in adult life are 
well-nigh unknown, and nothing was said which could for a 
moment lead the reader to suppose that they were the elements 
of composition of the higher states of mind. 
The Fundamental Fact. — The first and foremost concrete 
fact which every one will affirm to belong to his inner experi- 
ence is the fact that consciousness of some sort goes on. ‘ States of 
mind’ succeed each other in him. If we could say in English ‘ it 
thinks,’ as we say ‘ it rains’ or ‘ it blows,’ we should be stating 
the fact most simply and with the minimum of assumption. 
As we cannot, we must simply say that thought goes on. 
Four Characters in Consciousness. — How does it go on? 
We notice immediately four important characters in the pro- 
cess, of which it shall be the duty of the present chapter to 
treat in a general way: 
(x) Every ‘state’ tends to be part of a personal conscious- 
ness. 
(2) Within each personal consciousness states are always 
changing. 
(3) Each personal consciousness is sensibly continuous. 
(4) Itis interested in some parts of its object to the exclusion 
of others, and welcomes or rejects — chooses from among them, 
in a word — all the while. 
In considering these four points successively, we shall have 
to plunge in medias res as regards our nomenclature and use 
psychological terms which can only be adequately defined in 
later chapters of the bock. But every one knows what the 
terms mean in a rough way; and it is only in a rough way that 
we are now to take them. This chapter is like a painter’s first 
charcoal sketch upon his canvas, in which no niceties appear. 
When I say every ‘ state’ or ‘thought’ is part of a personal
-P-A-G-E-657
  PSYCHOLOGY 635 
consciousness, ‘ personal consciousness’ is one of the terms in 
question. Its meaning we know so long as no one asks us to 
define it, but to give an accurate account of it is the most diffi- 
cult of philosophic tasks. This task we must confront in the 
next chapter; here a preliminary word will suffice. 
In this room — this lecture-room, say — there are a multi- 
tude of thoughts, yours and mine, some of which cohere mutu- 
ally, and some not. They are as little each-for-itself and recip- 
rocally independent as they are all-belonging-together. They 
are neither: no one of them is separate, but each belongs with 
certain others and with none beside. My thought belongs with 
my other thoughts, and your thought with your other thoughts. 
Whether anywhere in the room there be a mere thought, which 
is nobody’s thought, we have no means of ascertaining, for we 
have no experience of its like. The only states of consciousness 
that we naturally deal with are found in personal conscious- 
nesses, minds, selves, concrete particular I’s and you’s. 
Each of these minds keeps its own thoughts to itself. There 
is no giving or bartering between them. No thought even 
comes into direct sight of a thought in another personal con- 
sciousness than its own. Absolute insulation, irreducible 
pluralism, is the law. It seems as if the elementary psychic fact 
were not thought or this thought or that thought, but my thought, 
every thought being owned. Neither contemporaneity, nor 
proximity in space, nor similarity of quality and content are 
able to fuse thoughts together which are sundered by this bar- 
rier of belonging to different personal minds. The breaches be- 
tween such thoughts are the most absolute breaches in nature. 
Every one will recognize this to be true, so long as the existence 
of something corresponding to the term ‘ personal mind’ is all 
that is insisted on, without any particular view of its nature 
being implied. On these terms the personal self rather than the 
thought might be treated as the immediate datum in psycho- 
logy. The universal conscious fact is not ‘ feelings and thoughts 
exist,’ but ‘ I think’ and ‘I feel.’ No psychology, at any rate, 
can question the existence of personal selves. Thoughts con- 
nected as we feel them to be connected are what we mean by
-P-A-G-E-658
  636 WILLIAM JAMES 
personal selves. The worst a psychology can do is so to inter- 
pret the nature of these selves as to rob them of their worth. 
Consciousness is inconstant change. —I do not mean by this 
to say that no one state of mind has any duration — even if 
true, that would be hard to establish. What I wish to lay stress 
on is this, that no state once gone can. recur and be identical with 
what it was before. Now we are seeing, now hearing; now rea- 
soning, now willing; now recollecting, now expecting; now lov- 
ing, now hating; and in a hundred other ways we know our 
minds to be alternately engaged. But all these are complex 
states, it may be said, produced by combination of simpler 
ones; — do not the simpler ones follow a different law? Are not 
the sensations which we get from the same object, for example, 
always the same? Does not the same piano-key, struck with 
the same force, make us hear in the same way? Does not the 
same grass give us the same feeling of green, the same sky the 
same feeling of blue, and do we not get the same olfactory sens- 
ation no matter how many times we put our nose to the same 
flask of cologne? It seems a piece of metaphysical sophistry to 
suggest that we do not; and yet a close attention to the matter 
shows that there is no proof that an incoming current ever gives us 
just the same bodily sensation twice. 
What is got twice is the same oByect. We hear the same note 
over and over again; we see the same quality of green, or smell 
the same objective perfume, or experience the same species of 
pain. The realities, concrete and abstract, physical and ideal, 
whose permanent existence we believe in, seem to be constantly 
coming up again before our thought, and lead us, in our care- 
lessness, to suppose that our ‘ideas’ of them are the same 
ideas. When we come, some time later, to the chapter on Per- 
ception, we shall see how inveterate is our habit of simply using 
our sensible impressions as stepping-stones to pass over to the 
recognition of the realities whose presence they reveal. The 
grass out of the window now looks to me of the same green in 
the sun as in the shade, and yet a painter would have to paint 
one part of it dark brown, another part bright yellow, to give 
its real sensational effect. We take no heed, asa rule, of the dif-

ferent way in which the same things look and sound and smell 
at different distances and under different circumstances. The 
sameness of the things is what we are concerned to ascertain; 
and any sensations that assure us of that will probably be con- 
sidered in a rough way to be the same with each other. This is 
what makes off-hand testimony about the subjective identity 
of different sensations well-nigh worthless as a proof of the fact. 
The entire history of what is called Sensation is a commentary 
on our inability to tell whether two sensible qualities received 
apart are exactly alike. What appeals to our attention far 
more than the absolute quality of an impression is its ratio to 
whatever other impressions we may have at the same time. 
When everything is dark a somewhat less dark sensation makes 
us see an object white. Helmholtz calculates that the white 
marble painted in a picture representing an architectural view 
by moonlight is, when seen by daylight, from ten to twenty 
thousand times brighter than the real moonlit marble would be. 
Such a difference as this could never have been sensibly 
learned; it had to be inferred from a series of indirect consider- 
ations. These make us believe that our sensibility is altering 
all the time, so that the same object cannot easily give us the 
same sensation over again. We feel things differently accord- 
ingly as we are sleepy or awake, hungry or full, fresh or tired; 
differently at night and in the morning, differently in summer 
and in winter; and above all, differently in childhood, manhood, 
and old age. And yet we never doubt that our feelings reveal 
the same world, with the same sensible qualities and the same 
sensible things occupying it. The difference of the sensibility is 
shown best by the difference of our emotion about the things 
from one age to another, or when we are in different organic 
moods. What was bright and exciting becomes weary, flat, 
and unprofitable. The bird’s song is tedious, the breeze is 
mournful, the sky is sad. 
To these indirect presumptions that our sensations, following 
the mutations of our capacity for feeling, are always under- 
going an essential change, must be added another presumption, 
based on what must happen in the grain. Every sensation corre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-660

sponds to some cerebral action. For an identical sensation to 
recur it would have to occur the second time in an unmodified 
brain. But as this, strictly speaking, is a physiological impossi- 
bility, so is an unmodified feeling an impossibility; for to every 
brain-modification, however small, we suppose that there must 
correspond a change of equal amount in the consciousness 
which the brain subserves. 
But if the assumption of ‘simple sensations’ recurring in 
immutable shape is so easily shown to be baseless, how much 
more baseless is the assumption of immutability in the larger 
masses of our thought! 
For there it is obvious and palpable that our state of mind is 
never precisely the same. Every thought we have of a given 
fact is, strictly speaking, unique, and only bears a resemblance 
of kind with our other thoughts of the same fact. When the 
identical fact recurs, we must think of it in a fresh manner, see 
it under a somewhat different angle, apprehend it in different 
relations from those in which it last appeared. And the thought 
by which we cognize it is the thought of it-in-those-relations, a 
thought suffused with the consciousness of all that dim con- 
text. Often we are ourselves struck at the strange differences in 
our successive views of the same thing. We wonder how we 
ever could have opined as we did last month about a certain 
matter. We have outgrown the possibility of that state of 
mind, we know not how. From one year to another we see 
things in new lights. What was unreal has grown real,and what 
was exciting is insipid. The friends we used to care the world 
for are shrunken to shadows; the women once so divine, the 
stars, the woods, and the waters, how now so dull and common! 
_— the young girls that brought an aura of infinity, at present 
hardly distinguishable existences; the pictures so empty; and as 
for the books, what was there to find so mysteriously significant 
in Goethe, or in John Mill so full of weight? Instead of all this, 
more zestful than ever is the work, the work; and fuller and 
deeper the import of common duties and of common goods. 
I am sure that this concrete and total manner of regarding 
the mind’s changes is the only true manner, difficult as it may
-P-A-G-E-661
PSYCHOLOGY 639 
be to carry it out in detail. If anything seems obscure about it, 
it will grow clearer as we advance. Meanwhile, if it be true, 
it is certainly also true that no two ‘ ideas ’ are ever exactly the 
same, which is the proposition we started to prove. The pro- 
position is more important theoretically than it at first sight 
seems. For it makes it already impossible for us to follow 
obediently in the footprints of either the Lockian or the 
Herbartian school, schools which have had almost unlimited 
influence in Germany and among ourselves. No doubt it is 
often convenient to formulate the mental facts in an atomistic 
sort of way, and to treat the higher states of consciousness as if 
they were all built out of unchanging simple ideas which ‘ pass 
and turn again.’ It is convenient often to treat curves as if they 
were composed of small straight lines, and electricity and nerve- 
force as if they were fluids. But in the one case as in the other 
we must never forget that we are talking symbolically, and that 
there is nothing in nature to answer to our words. A perma- 
nenitly existing ‘Idea’ which makes its appearance before the 
footlights of consciousness at periodical intervals is as mythological 
an entity as the Jack of Spades. 
Within each personal consciousness, thought is sensibly 
continuous.—I can only define ‘ continuous’ as that which is 
without breach, crack, or division. The only breaches that can 
well be conceived to occur within the limits of a single mind 
would either be interruptions, time-gaps during which the con- 
sciousness went out; or they would be breaks in the content of 
the thought, so abrupt that what followed had no connection 
whatever with what went before. The proposition that con- 
sciousness feels continuous, means two things: 
a. That even where there is a time-gap the consciousness 
after it feels as if it belonged together with the consciousness 
before it, as another part of the same self; 
b. That the changes from one moment to another in the 
quality of the consciousness are never absolutely abrupt. 
The case of the time-gaps, as the simplest, shall be taken 
first. 
a. When Paul and Peter wake up in the same bed, and recog-
-P-A-G-E-662
  640 WILLIAM JAMES 
nize that they have been asleep, each one of them mentally 
reaches back and makes connection with but one of the two 
streams of thought which were broken by the sleeping hours. 
As the current of an electrode buried in the ground unerringly 
finds its way to its own similarly buried mate, across no matter 
how much intervening earth; so Peter’s present instantly finds 
out Peter’s past, and never by mistake knits itself on to that of 
Paul. Paul’s thought in turn is as little liable to go astray. The 
past thought of Peter is appropriated by the present Peter 
alone. He may have a knowledge, and a correct one too, of what 
Paul’s last drowsy states of mind were as he sank into sleep, 
but it is an entirely different sort of knowledge from that which 
he has of his own last states. He remembers his own states, 
whilst he only conceives Paul’s. Remembrance is like direct 
feeling; its object is suffused with a warmth and intimacy to 
which no object of mere conception ever attains. This quality 
of warmth and intimacy and immediacy is what Peter’s present 
thought also possesses for itself. So sure as this present is me, is 
mine, it says, so sure is anything else that comes with the same 
warmth and intimacy and immediacy, me and mine. What the 
qualities called warmth and intimacy may in themselves be will 
have to be matter for future consideration. But whatever past 
states appear with those qualities must be admitted to receive 
the greeting of the present mental state, to be owned by it, and 
accepted as belonging together with it in a common self. This 
community of self is what the time-gap cannot break in twain, 
and is why a present thought, although not ignorant of the 
time-gap, can still regard itself as continuous with certain 
chosen portions of the past. 
Consciousness, then, does not appear to itself chopped up in 
bits. Such words as ‘chain’ or ‘train’ do not describe it fitly 
—as it presents itself in the first instance. It is nothing jointed; 
it flows. A‘ river’ ora ‘stream’ are the metaphors by which 
it is most naturally described. In talking of it hereafter, let us 
call it the stream of thought, of consciousness, or of subjective life. 
6. But now there appears, even within the limits of the same 
self, and between thoughts all of which alike have this same
-P-A-G-E-663
  PSYCHOLOGY 641 
sense of belonging together, a kind of jointing and separateness 
among the parts, of which this statement seems to take no 
account. I refer to the breaks that are produced by sudden 
contrasts in the quality of the successive segments of the stream 
of thought. If the words ‘ chain’ and ‘ train’ had no natural 
fitness in them, how came such words to be used at all? Does 
not a loud explosion rend the consciousness upon which it 
abruptly breaks, in twain? No; for even into our awareness of 
the thunder the awareness of the previous silence creeps and 
continues; for what we hear when the thunder crashes is 
not thunder pure, but thunder-breaking-upon-silence-and-con- 
trasting-with-it. Our feeling of the same objective thunder, 
coming in this way, is quite different from what it would be 
were the thunder a continuation of previous thunder. The 
thunder itself we believe to abolish and exclude the silence; but 
the feeling of the thunder is also a feeling of the silence as just 
gone; and it would be difficult to find in the actual concrete 
consciousness of mana feeling so limited to the present as not 
to have an inkling of anything that went before. 
‘Substantive’ and ‘Transitive’ States of Mind. — When 
we take a general view of the wonderful stream of our con- 
sciousness, what strikes us first is the different pace of its parts. 
Like a bird’s life, it seems to be an alternation of flights and 
perchings. The rhythm of language expresses this, where every 
thought is expressed in a sentence, and every sentence closed by 
a period. The resting-places are usually occupied by sensorial 
imaginations of some sort, whose peculiarity is that they can be 
held before the mind for an indefinite time, and contemplated 
without changing; the places.of flight are filled with thoughts 
of relations, static or dynamic, that for the most part obtain 
between the matters contemplated in the periods of compara- 
tive rest. 
Let us call the resting-places the ‘ substantive parts, and the 
places of flight the ‘ transitive parts,’ of the stream of thought. It 
then appears that our thinking tends at all times towards some 
other substantive part than the one from which it has just been 
dislodged. And we may say that the main use of the tran-
-P-A-G-E-664
  642 WILLIAM JAMES 
sitive parts is to lead us from one substantive conclusion ta 
another. 
Now it is very difficult, introspectively, to see the transitive 
parts for what they really are. If they are but flights to a con- 
clusion, stopping them to look at them before the conclusion is 
reached is really annihilating them. Whilst if we wait till the 
conclusion be reached, it so exceeds them in vigor and stability 
that it quite eclipses and swallows them up in its glare. Let 
anyone try to cut a thought across in the middle and get a look 
at its section, and he will see how difficult the introspective ob- 
servation of the transitive tracts is. The rush of the thought is 
so headlong that it almost always brings us up at the conclusion 
before we can arrest it. Or if our purpose is nimble enough and 
we do arrest it, it ceases forthwith to be itself. As a snowflake 
crystal caught in the warm hand is no longer a crystal but a 
drop, so, instead of catching the feeling of relation moving to 
its term, we find we have caught some substantive thing, 
usually the last word we were pronouncing, statically taken, 
and with its function, tendency, and particular meaning in the 
sentence quite evaporated. The attempt at introspective 
analysis in these cases is in fact like seizing a spinning top to 
catch its motion, or trying to turn up the gas quickly enough to 
see how the darkness looks. And the challenge to produce these 
transitive states of consciousness, which is sure to be thrown by 
doubting psychologists at anyone who contends for their exist- 
ence, is as unfair as Zeno’s treatment of the advocates of mo- 
tion, when, asking them to point out in what place an arrow is 
when it moves, he argues the falsity of their thesis from their 
inability to make to so preposterous a question an immediate 
reply. 
The results of this introspective difficulty are baleful. If to 
hold fast and observe the transitive parts of thought’s stream 
be so hard, then the great blunder to which all schools are liable 
must be the failure to register them, and the undue emphasiz- 
ing of the more substantive parts of tke stream. Now the 
blunder has historically worked in two ways. One set of 
thinkers have been led by it to Sensationalism. Unable to lay
-P-A-G-E-665
  
PSYCHOLOGY 643 
their hands on any substantive feelings corresponding to the 
innumerable relations and forms of connection between the 
sensible things of the world, finding no named mental states 
mirroring such relations, they have for the most part denied 
that any such states exist; and many of them, like Hume, have 
gone on to deny the reality of most relations owt of the mind as 
well as in it. Simple substantive ‘ ideas,’ sensations and their 
copies, juxtaposed like dominoes in a game, but really separate, 
everything else verbal illusion, — such is the upshot of this 
view. The [ntellectualists, on the other hand, unable to give up 
the reality of relations extra mentem, but equally unable to 
point to any distinct substantive feelings in which they were 
known, have made the same admission that such feelings do not 
exist. But they have drawn an opposite conclusion. The rela- 
tions must be known, they say, in something that is no feeling, 
no mental ‘ state,’ continuous and consubstantial with the sub- 
jective tissue out of which sensations and other substantive 
conditions of consciousness are made. They must be known by 
something that lies on an entirely different plane, by an actus 
purus of Thought, Intellect, or Reason, all written with capitals 
and considered to mean something unutterably superior to any 
passing perishing fact of sensibility whatever. 
But from our point of view both Intellectualists and Sensa- 
tionalists are wrong. If there be such things as feelings at all, 
then so surely as relations between objects exist in rerum natura, 
so surely, and more surely, do feelings exist to which these relations 
are known. There is not a conjunction or a preposition, and 
hardly an adverbial phrase, syntactic form, or inflection of 
voice, in human speech, that does not express some shading or 
- other of relation which we at some moment actually feel to exist 
between the larger objects of our thought. If we speak object- 
ively, it is the real relations that appear revealed; if we speak 
subjectively, it is the stream of consciousness that matches each 
of them by an inward coloring of its own. In either case the 
relations are numberless, and no existing language is capable of 
doing justice to all their shades. 
We ought to say a feeling of and, a feeling of if, a feeling of
-P-A-G-E-666
    644. WILLIAM JAMES 
but, and a feeling of by, quite as readily as we say a feeling of 
blue or a feeling of cold. Yet we do not: so inveterate has our 
habit become of recognizing the existence of the substantive 
parts alone, that language almost refuses to lend itself to any 
other use. Consider once again the analogy of the brain. We 
believe the brain to be an organ whose internal equilibrium is 
always in a state of change — the change affecting every part. 
The pulses of change are doubtless more violent in one place 
than in another, their rhythm more rapid at this time than at 
that. As in a kaleidoscope revolving at a uniform rate, al- 
though the figures are always rearranging themselves, there are 
instants during which the transformation seems minute and 
interstitial and almost absent, followed by others when it 
shoots with magical rapidity, relatively stable forms thus alter- 
nating with forms we should not distinguish if seen again; so in 
the brain the perpetual rearrangement must result in some forms 
of tension lingering relatively long, whilst others simply come 
and pass. But if consciousness corresponds to the fact of rear- 
rangement itself, why, if the rearrangement stop not, should the 
consciousness ever cease? And if a lingering rearrangement 
brings with it one kind of consciousness, why should not a swift 
rearrangement bring another kind of consciousness as peculiar 
as the rearrangement itself? 
The object before the mind always has a ‘ Fringe.’ — There 
are other unnamed modifications of consciousness just as im- 
portant as the transitive states, and just as cognitive as they. 
Examples will show what I mean. 
Suppose three successive persons say to us: ‘ Wait!’ ‘Hark!’ 
‘Look!’ Our consciousness is thrown into three quite different 
attitudes of expectancy, although no definite object is before it 
in any one of the three cases. Probably no one will deny here the 
existence of a real conscious affection, a sense of the direction 
from which an impression is about to come, although no posi- 
tive impression is yet there. Meanwhile we have no names for 
the psychoses in question but the names hark, look, and wait. 
Suppose we try to recall a forgotten name. The state of our 
consciousness is peculiar. There is a gap therein; but no mere
-P-A-G-E-667
  
PSYCHOLOGY 648 
gap. It isa gap that is intensely active. A sort of wraith of the 
name is in it, beckoning us in a given direction, making us at 
moments tingle with the sense of our closeness, and then letting 
us sink back without the longed-for term. If wrong names are 
proposed to us, this singularly definite gap acts immediately so 
as to negate them. They do not fit into its mould. And the gap 
of one word does not feel like the gap of another, all empty of 
content as both might seem necessarily to be when described as 
gaps. When I vainly try to recall the name of Spalding, my con- 
sciousness is far removed from what it is when I vainly try to 
recall the name of Bowles. There are innumerable conscious- 
nesses of want, no one of which taken in itself has a name, but 
all different from each other. Such a feeling of want is foto clo 
other than a want of feeling: it is an intense feeling. The 
rhythm of a lost word may be there without a sound to clothe it; 
or the evanescent sense of something which is the initial vowel 
or consonant may mock us fitfully, without growing more dis- 
tinct. Every one must know the tantalizing effect of the blank 
rhythm of some forgotten verse, restlessly dancing in one’s 
mind, striving to be filled out with words. 
What is that first instantaneous glimpse of some one’s mean- 
ing which we have, when in vulgar phrase we say we ‘ twig’ it? 
Surely an altogether specific affection of our mind. And has the 
reader never asked himself what kind of a mental fact is his 
intention of saying a thing before he has said it? It is an entirely 
definite intention, distinct from all other intentions, an abso- 
lutely distinct state of consciousness, therefore; and yet how 
much of it consists of definite sensorial images, either of words 
or of things? Hardly anything! Linger, and the words and 
things come into the mind; the anticipatory intention, the 
divination is there no more. But as the words that replace it 
arrive, it welcomes them successively and calls them right if 
they agree with it, it rejects them and calls them wrong if they 
do not. The intention to-say-so-and-so is the only name it can 
receive. One may admit that a good third of our psychic 
life consists in these rapid premonitory perspective views of 
schemes of thought not yet articulate. How comes it about that
-P-A-G-E-668
  
  646 WILLIAM JAMES 
a man reading something aloud for the first time is able imme- 
diately to emphasize all his words aright, unless from the very 
first he have a sense of at least the form of the sentence yet to 
come, which sense is fused with his consciousness of the present 
word, and modifies its emphasis in his mind so as to make him 
give it the proper accent as he utters it? Emphasis of this kind 
almost altogether depends on grammatical construction. If we 
read ‘no more,’ we expect presently a ‘than’; if we read ‘how- 
ever,’ it is a ‘yet,’ a ‘still,’ or a ‘nevertheless,’ that we expect. 
And this foreboding of the coming verbal and grammatical 
scheme is so practically accurate that a reader incapable of 
understanding four ideas of the book he is reading aloud 
can nevertheless read it with the most delicately modulated 
expression of intelligence. 
It is, the reader will see, the reinstatement of the vague and 
inarticulate to its proper place in our mental life which I am so 
anxious to press on the attention. Mr. Galton and Prof. Huxley 
have, as we shall see in the chapter on Imagination, made one 
step in advance in exploding the ridiculous theory of Hume and 
Berkeley that we can have no images but of perfectly definite 
things. Another is made if we overthrow the equally ridiculous 
notion that, whilst simple objective qualities are revealed to 
our knowledge in ‘states of consciousness,’ relations are not. 
But these reforms are not half sweeping and radical enough. 
What must be admitted is that the definite images of tradi- 
tional psychology form but the very smallest part of our minds 
as they actually live. The traditional psychology talks like one 
who should say a river consists of nothing but pailsful, spoons- 
ful, quartpotsful, barrelsful, and other moulded forms of water. 
Even were the pails and the pots all actually standing in the 
stream, still between them the free water would continue to 
flow. It is just this free water of consciousness that psycholo- 
gists resolutely overlook. Every definite image in the mind is 
steeped and dyed in the free water that flows round it. With it 
goes the sense of its relations, near and remote, the dying echo 
of whence it came to us, the dawning sense of whither it is to 
lead. The significance, the value, of the image is all in this halo
-P-A-G-E-669
  PSYCHOLOGY 647 
or penumbra that surrounds and escorts it, — or rather that is 
fused into one with it and has become bone of its bone and flesh 
of its flesh; leaving it, it is true, an image of the same thing it 
was before, but making it an image of that thing newly taken 
and freshly understood. 
Let us call the consciousness of this halo of relations around the 
image by the name of ‘psychic overtone’ or ‘ fringe.’ 
Cerebral Conditions of the ‘Fringe.’— Nothing is easier 
than to symbolize these facts in terms of brain-action. Just as 
the echo of the whence, the sense of the starting point of our 
thought, is probably due to the dying excitement of processes 
but a moment since vividly aroused; so the sense of the whither, 
the foretaste of the terminus, must be due to the waxing excite- 
ment of tracts or processes whose psychical correlative will a 
moment hence be the vividly present feature of our thought. 
Represented by a curve, the neurosis underlying consciousness 
must at any moment be like this: 
Let the horizontal in Fig. 1 be the line of time, and let the 
Fie. 1. 
three curves beginning at a, 6, and ¢ respectively stand for the 
neural processes correlated with the thoughts of those three 
letters. Each process occupies a certain time during which its 
intensity waxes, culminates, and wanes. The process for a has 
not yet died out, the process for c has already begun, when that 
for b is culminating. At the time-instant represented by the 
vertical line all three processes are present, in the intensities 
shown by the curve. Those before c’s apex were more intense a 
moment ago; those after it will be more intense a moment
-P-A-G-E-670
  648 WILLIAM JAMES 
hence. If I recite a, 6, c, then, at the moment of uttering 8, 
neither a nor ¢ is out of my consciousness altogether, but both, 
after their respective fashions, ‘ mix their dim lights ’ with the 
stronger b, because their processes are both awake in some 
degree. 
It is just like ‘ overtones’ in music: they are not separately 
heard by the ear; they blend with the fundamental note, and 
suffuse it, and alter it; and even so do the waxing and waning 
brain-processes at every moment blend with and suffuse and 
alter the psychic effect of the processes which are at their 
culminating point. 
The ‘ Topic’ of the Thought. — If we then consider the cog- 
nitive function of different states of mind, we may feel assured 
that the difference between those that are mere ‘ acquaintance’ 
and those that are ‘ knowledges-about ’ is reducible almost en- 
tirely to the absence or presence of psychic fringes or overtones. 
Knowledge about a thing is knowledge of its relations. Ac- 
quaintance with it is limitation to the bare impression which it 
makes. Of most of its relations we are only aware in the penum- 
bral nascent way of a ‘ fringe’ of unarticulated affinities about 
it. And, before passing to the next topic in order, I must say a 
little of this sense of affinity, as itself one of the most interesting 
features of the subjective stream. 
Thought may be equally rational in any sort of terms.— Jall 
our voluntary thinking there is some TOPIC or SUBJECT about 
which all the members of the thought revolve. Relation to this 
topic or interest is constantly felt in the fringe, and particularly 
the relation of harmony and discord, of furtherance or hind- 
rance of the topic. Any thought the quality of whose fringe lets 
us feel ourselves ‘ all right,’ may be considered a thought that 
furthers the topic. Provided we only feel its object to have a 
place in the scheme of relations in which the topic also lies, that 
is sufficient to make it of a ee and appropriate portion of 
our train of ideas. 
Now we may think about our topic mainly in words, or we 
may think about it mainly in visual or other images, but this 
need make no difference as regards the furtherance of our
-P-A-G-E-671
  
PSYCHOLOGY 649 
knowledge of the topic. If we only feel in the terms, whatever 
they be, a fringe of affinity with each other and with the topic, 
and if we are conscious of approaching a conclusion, we feel 
that our thought is rational and right. The words in every 
language have contracted by long association fringes of mutual 
repugnance or affinity with each other and with the conclusion, 
which run exactly parallel with like fringes in the visual, tactile, 
and other ideas. The most important element of these fringes 
is, I repeat, the mere feeling of harmony or discord, of a right or 
wrong direction in the thought. 
If we know English and French and begin a sentence in 
French, all the later words that come are French; we hardly 
ever drop into English. And this affinity of the French words 
for each other is not something merely operating mechanically 
as a brain-law, it is something we feel at the time. Our under- 
standing of a French sentence heard never falls to so low an ebb 
that we are not aware that the words linguistically belong to- 
gether. Our attention can hardly so wander that if an English 
word be suddenly introduced we shall not start at the change. 
Such a vague sense as this of the words belonging together is 
the very minimum of fringe that can accompany them, if 
‘thought’ at all. Usually the vague perception that all the 
words we hear belong to the same language and to the same 
specia! vocabulary in that language, and that the grammatical 
sequence is familiar, is practically equivalent to an admission 
that what we hear is sense. But if an unusual foreign word be 
introduced, if the grammar trip, or if a term from an incon- 
gruous vocabulary suddenly appear, such as ‘rat-trap’ or 
“plumber’s bill’ in a philosophical discourse, the sentence 
detonates as it were, we receive a shock from the incongruity, 
and the drowsy assent is gone. The feeling of rationality in 
these cases seems rather a negative than a positive thing, being 
the mere absence of shock, or sense of discord, between the 
terms of thought. 
Conversely, if words do belong to the same vocabulary, and 
if the grammatical structure is correct, sentences with abso- 
lutely no meaning may be uttered in good faith and pass un- 
 
-P-A-G-E-672
    650 WILLIAM JAMES 
challenged. Discourses at prayer-meetings, reshufiling the 
same collection of cant phrases and the whole genus of penny-a- 
line-isms and newspaper-reporter’s flourishes give illustrations 
of this. “ The birds filled the tree-tops with their morning 
song, making the air moist, cool, and pleasant,” is a sentence 
I remember reading once in a report of some athletic exer- 
cises in Jerome Park. It was probably written unconsciously 
by the hurried reporter, and read uncritically by many 
readers. 
We see, then, that it makes little or no difference in what sort 
of mind-stuff, in what quality of imagery, our thinking goes on. 
The only images intrinsically important are the halting-places, 
the substantive conclusions, provisional or final, of the thought. 
Throughout all the rest of the stream, the feelings of relation 
are everything, and the terms related almost naught. These 
feelings of relation, these psychic overtones, halos, suffusions, 
or fringes about the terms, may be the same in very different 
systems of imagery. A diagram 
may help to accentuate this in- 
4 Z difference of the mental means 
where the end is the same. Let 
A be some experience from 
which a number of thinkers 
start. Let Z be the practical 
conclusion rationally inferrable 
from it. One gets to this conclusion by one line, another by 
another ; one follows a course of English, another of German, 
verbal imagery. With one, visual images predominate; with 
another, tactile. Some trains are tinged with emotions, others 
not; some are very abridged, synthetic and rapid; others, hesi- 
tating and broken into many steps. But when the penultimate 
terms of all the trains, however differing inter se, finally shoot 
into the same conclusion, we say, and rightly say, that all the 
thinkers have had substantially the same thought. It would

    PSYCHOLOGY 651 
The last peculiarity to which attention is to be drawn in this 
first rough description of thoughts’ stream is that — 
Consciousness is always interested more in one part of its 
object than in another, and welcomes and rejects, or chooses, 
all the while it thinks. 
The phenomena of selective attention and of deliberative 
will are of course patent examples of this choosing activity. 
But few of us are aware how incessantly it is at work in opera- 
tions not ordinarily called by these names. Accentuation and 
Emphasis are present in every perception we have. We find it 
quite impossible to disperse our attention impartially over a 
number of impressions. A monotonous succession of sonorous 
strokes is broken up into rhythms, now of one sort, now of an- 
other, by the different accent which we place on different 
strokes. The simplest of these rhythms is the double one, tick- 
téck, tick-t6ck, tick-t6ck. Dots dispersed on a surface are per- 
ceived in rows and groups. Lines separate into diverse figures. 
The ubiquity of the distinctions, this and that, here and there, 
now and then, in our minds is the result of our laying the same 
selective emphasis on parts of place and time. 
But we do far more than emphasize things, and unite some, 
and keep others apart. We actually ignore most of the things 
before us. Let me briefly show how this goes on. 
To begin at the bottom, what are our very senses themselves, 
but organs of selection? Out of the infinite chaos of move- 
ments, of which physics teaches us that the outer world con- 
sists, each sense-organ picks out those which fall within certain 
limits of velocity. To these it responds, but ignores the rest as 
completely as if they did not exist: Out of what is in itself an 
_ undistinguishable, swarming continuum, devoid of distinction 
or emphasis, our senses make for us, by attending to this mo- 
tion and ignoring that, a world full of contrasts, of sharp 
accents, of abrupt changes, of picturesque light and shade. 
If the sensations we receive from a given organ have their 
causes thus picked out for us by the conformation of the organ’s 
termination, Attention, on the other hand, out of all the sensa- 
tions yielded, picks out certain ones as worthy of its notice and
-P-A-G-E-674
  652 WILLIAM JAMES 
suppresses all the rest. We notice only those sensations which 
are signs tous of things which happen practically or esthetically 
to interest us, to which we therefore give substantive names, 
and which we exalt to this exclusive status of independence and 
dignity. But in itself, apart from my interest, a particular dust- 
wreath on a windy day is just as much of an individual thing, 
and just as much or as little deserves an individual name, as 
my own body does. 
And then, among the sensations we get from each separate 
thing, what happens? The mind selects again. It chooses cer- 
tain of the sensations to represent the thing most éruly, and 
considers the rest as its appearances, modified by the condi- 
tions of the moment. Thus my table-top is named square, after 
but one of an infinite number of retinal sensations which it 
yields, the rest of them being sensations of two acute and two 
obtuse angles; but I call the latter perspective views, and the 
four right angles the true form of the table, and erect the at- 
tribute squareness into the table’s essence, for esthetic reasons 
of my own. In like manner, the real form of the circle is deemed 
to be the sensation it gives when the line of vision is perpendicu- 
lar to its centre — all its other sensations are signs of this sensa- 
tion. The real sound of the cannon is the sensation it makes 
when the ear is close by. The real color of the brick is the sensa- 
tion it gives when the eye looks squarely at it from a near point, 
out of the sunshine and yet not in the gloom; under other cir- 
cumstances it gives us other color-sensations which are but 
signs of this —we then see it look pinker or bluer than it 
really is. The reader knows no object which he does not repre- 
sent to himself by preference as in some typical attitude, of 
some normal size, at some characteristic distance, of some stan- 
dard tint, etc., etc. But all these essential characteristics, 
which together form for us the genuine objectivity of the thing 
and are contrasted with what we call the subjective sensations 
it may yield us at a given moment, are mere sensations like the 
latter. The mind chooses to suit itself, and decides what par- 
ticular sensation shall be held more real and valid than all the 
rest.
-P-A-G-E-675
  PSYCHOLOGY 653 
Next, in a world of objects thus individualized by our mind’s 
selective industry, what is called our ‘ experience’ is almost 
entirely determined by our habits of attention. A thing may be 
present to a man a hundred times, but if he presistently fails to 
notice it, it cannot be said to enter into his experience. We 
are all seeing flies, moths, and beetles by the thousand, but to 
whom, save an entomologist, do they say anything distinct? 
On the other hand, a thing met only once in a lifetime may leave 
an indelible experience in the memory. Let four men make a 
tour in Europe. One will bring home only picturesque impres- 
sions — costumes and colors, parks and views and works of 
architecture, pictures and statues. To another all this will be 
non-existent; and distances and prices, populations and drain- 
age-arrangements, door- and window-fastenings, and other 
useful statistics will take their place. A third will give a rich 
account of the theatres, restaurants, and public halls, and 
naught beside; whilst the fourth will perhaps have been so 
wrapped in his own subjective broodings as to be able to tell 
little more than a few names of places through which he passed. 
Each has selected, out of the same mass of presented objects, 
those which suited his private interest and has made his experi- 
ence thereby. 
If now, leaving the empirical combination of objects, we ask 
how the mind proceeds rationally to connect them, we find 
selection again to be omnipotent. In a future chapter we shall 
see that all Reasoning depends on the ability of the mind to 
break up the totality of the phenomenon reasoned about, into 
parts, and to pick out from among these the particular one 
which, in the given emergency, may lead to the proper conclu- 
sion. The man of genius is he who will always stick in his bill 
at the right point, and bring it out with the right element — 
“reason’ if the emergency be theoretical, ‘ means’ if it be 
practical — transfixed upon it. 
If now we pass to the esthetic department, our law is still 
more obvious. The artist notoriously selects his items, rejecting 
all tones, colors, shapes, which do not harmonize with each 
other and with the main purpose of his work. That unity, har- 
 
-P-A-G-E-676
  654 WILLIAM JAMES 
mony, ‘ convergence of characters,’ as M. Taine calls it, which 
gives to works of art their superiority over works of nature, is 
wholly due to elimination. Any natural subject will do, if the 
artist has wit enough to pounce upon some one feature of it as 
characteristic, and suppress all merely accidental items which 
do not harmonize with this. 
Ascending still higher, we reach the plane of Ethics, where 
choice reigns notoriously supreme. An act has no ethical qual- 
ity whatever unless it be chosen out of several all equally pos- 
sible. To sustain the arguments for the good course and keep 
them ever before us, to stifle our longing for more flowery ways, 
to keep the foot unflinchingly on the arduous path, these are 
characteristic ethical energies. But more than these; for these 
but deal with the means of compassing interests already felt by 
the man to be supreme. The ethical energy par excellence has to 
go farther and choose which inéerest out of several, equally co- 
ercive, shall become supreme. The issue here is of the utmost 
pregnancy, for it decides a man’s entire career. When he de- 
bates, Shall I commit this crime? choose that profession? ac- 
cept that office, or marry this fortune? — his choice really lies 
between one of several equally possible future Characters. 
What he shall become is fixed by the conduct of this moment. 
Schopenhauer, who enforces his determinism by the argument 
that with a given fixed character only one reaction is possible 
under given circumstances, forgets that, in these critical ethical 
moments, what consciously seems to be in question is the com- 
plexion of the character itself. The problem with the man is 
less what act he shall now resolve to do than what being he shall 
now choose to become. 
Taking human experience in a general way, the choosings of 
different men are to a great extent the same. The race as a 
whole largely agrees as to what it shall notice and name; and 
among the noticed parts we select in much the same way for 
accentuation and preference, or subordination and dislike. 
There is, however, one entirely extraordinary case in which no 
two men ever are known to choose alike. One great splitting 
of the whole universe into two halves is made by each of us;
-P-A-G-E-677
PSYCHOLOGY 655 
and for each of us almost all of the interest attaches to one of 
the halves; but we all draw the line of division between them 
in a different place. When I say that we all call the two halves 
by the same names, and that those names are ‘.me’ and ‘ not- 
me’ respectively, it will at once be seen what I mean. The alto- 
gether unique kind of interest which each human mind feels in 
those parts of creation which it can call me or mine may be a 
moral riddle, but it is a fundamental psychological fact. No 
mind can take the same interest. in his neighbor’s me as in his 
own. The neighbor’s me falls together with all the rest of things 
in one foreign mass against which his own me stands out in 
startling relief. Even the trodden worm, as Lotze somewhere 
says, contrasts his own suffering self with the whole remaining 
universe, though he have noclear conception either of himself or 
of what the universe may be. He is for me a mere part of the 
world; for him it is I who am the mere part. Each of us dicho- 
tomizes the Kosmos in a different place. 
CHAPTER XXIV. EMOTION! 
Emotions compared with Instincts. — An emotion is a tend- 
ency to feel, and an instinct is a tendency to act, characteristic- 
ally, when in presence of a certain object in the environment. 
But the emotions also have their bodily ‘expression,’ which 
may involve strong muscular activity (as in fear or anger, for 
example) ; and it becomesa little hard in many cases to separate 
the description of the ‘emotional’ condition from that of the 
‘instinctive ’ reaction which one and the same object may pro- 
voke. Shall fear be described in the chapter on Instincts or in 
that on Emotions? Where shall one describe curiosity, emula- « 
tion, and the like? The answer is quite arbitrary from the scien- 
tific point of view, and practical convenience may decide. As 
inner mental conditions, emotions are quite indescribable. 
Description, moreover, would be superfluous, for the reader 
1 The substance of this chapter first appeared in an article published in 
Mind in 1884, and again asa chapter in the author’s Principles of Psychology, 
in 1890. 
 
-P-A-G-E-678
  656 WILLIAM JAMES 
knows already how they feel. Their relations to the objects 
which prompt them and to the reactions which they provoke 
are all that one can put down in a book. 
Every object that excites an instinct excites an emotion as 
well. The only distinction one may draw is that the reaction 
called emotional terminates in the subject’s own body, whilst 
the reaction called instinctive is apt to go farther and enter 
into practical relations with the exciting object. In both 
instinct and emotion the mere memory or imagination of the 
object may suffice to liberate the excitement. One may even 
get angrier in thinking over one’s insult than one was in receiv- 
ing it; and melt more over a mother who is dead than one ever 
did when she was living. In the rest of the chapter I shall use 
the word object of emotion indifferently to mean one which is 
physically present or one which is merely thought of. 
The varieties of emotion are innumerable. — Anger, fear, love, 
hate, joy, grief, shame, pride, and their varieties, may be called 
the coarser emotions, being coupled as they are with relatively 
strong bodily reverberations. The subéler emotions are the 
moral, intellectual, and esthetic feelings, and their bodily reac- 
tion is usually much less strong. The mere description of the 
objects, circumstances, and varieties of the different species of 
emotion may go to any length. Their internal shadings merge 
endlessly into each other, and have been partly commemorated 
in language, as, for example, by such synonyms as hatred, 
antipathy, animosity, resentment, dislike, aversion, malice, 
spite, revenge, abhorrence, etc., etc. Dictionaries of synonyms 
have discriminated them, as well as text-books of psychology 
— in fact, many German psychological text-books ave nothing 
* but dictionaries of synonyms when it comes to the chapter on 
Emotion. But there are limits to the profitable elaboration of 
the obvious, and the result of all this flux is that the merely 
descriptive literature of the subject, from Descartes down- 
wards is one of the most tedious parts of psychology. And not 
only is it tedious, but you feel that its subdivisions are to a 
great extent either fictitious or unimportant, and that its pre- 
tences to accuracy are a sham. But unfortunately there is
-P-A-G-E-679
  PSYCHOLOGY 657 
little psychological writing about the emotions which is not 
merely descriptive. As emotions are described in novels, they 
interest us, for we are made to share them. We have grown 
acquainted with the concrete objects and emergencies which 
call them forth, and any knowing touch of introspection which 
may grace the page meets with a quick and feeling response. 
Confessedly literary works of aphoristic philosophy also flash 
lights into our emotioaal life, and give us a fitful delight. But 
as far as the ‘ scientific psychology ’ of the emotions goes, I may 
have been surfeited by too much reading of classic works on the 
subject, but I would as lief read verbal descriptions of the shapes 
of the rocks on a New Hampshire farm as toil through them 
again. They give one nowhere a central point of view, or a de- 
ductive or generative principle. They distinguish and refine 
and specify in infinitum without ever getting on to another 
logical level. Whereas the beauty of all truly scientific work is 
to get to ever deeper levels. Is there no way out from this level 
of individual description in the case of the emotions? I believe 
there is a way out, if one will only take it. 
The Cause of their Varieties. — The trouble with the emo- 
tions in psychology is that they are regarded too much as abso- 
lutely individual things. So long as they are set down as so 
many eternal and sacred psychic entities, like the old immu- 
table species in natural history, so long all that can be done 
with them is reverently to catalogue their separate characters, 
points, and effects. But if we regard them as products of more 
general causes (as ‘ species’ are now regarded as products of 
heredity and variation), the mere distinguishing and catalogu- 
ing becomes of subsidiary importance. Having the goose which 
lays the golden eggs, the description of each egg already laid is 
a minor matter. I will devote the next few pages to setting 
forth one very general cause of our emotional feeling, limiting 
myself in the first instance to what may be called the coarser 
emotions. 
The feeling, in the coarser emotions, results from the bodily 
expression. — Our natural way of thinking about these coarser 
emotions is that the mental perception of some fact excites the
-P-A-G-E-680
  658 WILLIAM JAMES 
mental affection called the emotion, and that this latter state 
of mind gives rise to the bodily expression. My theory, on the 
contrary, is that the bodily changes follow directly the perception 
of the exciting fact, and that our feeling of the same changes as 
they occur 1S the emotion. Common-sense says, we lose our for- 
tune, are sorry and weep; we meet a bear, are frightened and 
run; we are insulted by a rival, are angry and strike. The 
hypothesis here to be defended says that this order of sequence 
is incorrect, and the one mental state is not immediately in- 
duced by the other, that the bodily manifestations must first 
be interposed between, and that the more rational statement is 
that we feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, 
afraid because we tremble, and not that we cry, strike, or trem- 
ble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be. 
Without the bodily states following on the perception, the lat- 
ter would be purely cognitive in form, pale, colorless, destitute 
of emotional warmth. We might then see the bear and judge 
it best to run, receive the insult and deem it right to strike, but 
we should not actually feel afraid or angry. 
Stated in this crude way, the hypothesis is pretty sure to 
meet with immediate disbelief. And yet neither many nor 
far-fetched considerations are required to mitigate its para- 
doxical character, and possibly to produce conviction of its 
truth. 
To begin with, particular perceptions certainly do produce 
wide-spread bodily effects by a sort of immediate physical influ- 
ence, antecedent to the arousal of an emotion or emotional idea. 
In listening to poetry, drama, or heroic narrative we are often 
surprised at the cutaneous shiver which like a sudden wave 
flows over us, and at the heart-swelling and the lachrymal 
effusion that unexpectedly catch us at intervals. In hearing 
music the same is even more strikingly true. If we abruptly see 
a dark moving form in the woods, our heart stops beating, and 
we catch our breath instantly and before any articulate idea of 
danger can arise. If our friend goes near to the edge of a preci- 
pice, we get the well-known feeling of ‘ all-overishness,’ and 
we shrink back, although we positively know him to be safe,
-P-A-G-E-681
  PSYCHOLOGY 659 
and have no distinct imagination of his fall. The writer well 
remembers his astonishment, when a boy of seven or eight, at 
fainting when he saw a horse bled. The blood was in a bucket, 
with a stick in it, and, if memory does not deceive him, he 
stirred it round and saw it drip from the stick with no feeling 
save that of childish curiosity. Suddenly the world grew black 
before his eyes, his ears began to buzz, and he knew no more. 
He had never heard of the sight of blood producing faintness or 
sickness, and he had so little repugnance to it, and so little 
apprehension of any other sort of danger from it, that even at 
that tender age, as he well remembers, he could not help wonder- 
ing how the mere physical presence of a pailful of crimson fluid 
could occasion in him such formidable bodily effects. 
The best proof that the immediate cause of emotion is a 
physical effect on the nerves is furnished by those pathological 
cases in which the emotion is objectless. One of the chief merits, 
in fact, of the view which I propose seems to be that we can so 
easily formulate by its means pathological cases and normal 
cases under a common scheme. In every asylum we find exam- 
ples of absolutely unmotived fear, anger, melancholy, or con- 
ceit; and others of an equally unmotived apathy which persists 
in spite of the best of outward reasons why it should give way. 
In the former cases we must suppose the nervous machinery to 
be so ‘labile’ in some one emotional direction that almost 
every stimulus (however inappropriate) causes it to upset in 
that way, and to engender the particular complex of feelings of 
which the psychic body of the emotion consists. Thus, to take 
one special instance, if inability to draw deep breath, fluttering 
of the heart, and that peculiar epigastric change felt as ‘ pre- 
cordial anxiety,’ with an irresistible tendency to take a some- 
what crouching attitude and to sit still, and with perhaps other 
visceral processes not now known, all spontaneously occur to- 
gether ina certain person, his feeling of their combination is the 
emotion of dread, and he is the victim of what is known as 
morbid fear. A friend who has had occasional attacks of this 
most distressing of all maladies tells me that in his case the 
whole drama seems to centre about the region of the heart and 
 
-P-A-G-E-682
  660 WILLIAM JAMES 
respiratory apparatus, that his main effort during the attacks 
is to get control of his inspirations and to slow his heart, and 
that the moment he attains to breathing deeply and to holding 
himself erect, the dread, ipso facto, seems to depart. 
The emotion here is nothing but the feeling of a bodily state, 
and it has a purely bodily cause. 
The next thing to be noticed is this, that every one of the 
bodily changes, whatsoever it be, is FELT, acutely or obscurely, the 
moment it occurs. If the reader has never paid attention to this 
matter, he will be both interested and astonished to learn how 
many different local bodily feelings he can detect in himself as 
characteristic of his various emotional moods. It would be per- 
haps too much to expect him to arrest the tide of any strong 
gust of passion for the sake of any such curious analysis as this; 
but he can observe more tranquil states, and that may be 
assumed here to be true of the greater which is shown to be 
true of the less. Our whole cubic capacity is sensibly alive; 
and each morsel of it contributes its pulsations of feeling, dim 
or sharp, pleasant, painful, or dubious, to that sense of per- 
sonality that every one of us unfailingly carries with him. It is 
surprising what little items give accent to these complexes of 
sensibility. When worried by any slight trouble, one may find 
that the focus of one’s bodily consciousness is the contraction 
often quite inconsiderable, of the eyes and brows. When mo- 
mentarily embarrassed, it is something in the pharynx that 
compels either a swallow, a clearing of the throat, or a slight 
cough; and so on for as many more instances as might be 
named. The various permutations of which these organic 
changes are susceptible make it abstractly possible that no 
shade of emotion should be without a bodily reverberation as 
unique, when taken in its totality, as is the mental mood itself. 
The immense number of parts modified is what makes it so diffi- 
cult for us to reproduce in cold blood the total and integral 
expression of any one emotion. We may catch the trick with 
the voluntary muscles, but fail with the skin, glands, heart, and 
other viscera. Just as an artificially imitated sneeze lacks some- 
thing of the reality, so the attempt to imitate grief or enthusi-
-P-A-G-E-683
  PSYCHOLOGY 661 
asm in the absence of its normal instigating cause is apt to be 
rather ‘ hollow.’ 
I now proceed to urge the vital point of my whole theory, 
which is this: If we fancy some strong emotion, and then try to 
abstract from our consciousness of it all the feelings of its bodily 
symptoms, we find we have nothing left behind, no ‘ mind-stuff’ 
out of which the emotion can be constituted, and that a cold and 
neutral state of intellectual perception is all that remains. It is 
true that, although most people, when asked, say that their 
introspection verifies this statement, some persist in saying 
theirs does not. Many cannot be made to understand the ques- 
tion. When you beg them to imagine away every feeling of 
laughter and of tendency to laugh from their consciousness of 
the ludicrousness of an object, and then to tell you what the 
feeling of its ludicrousness would be like, whether it be any- 
thing more than the perception that the object belongs to the 
class ‘ funny,’ they persist in replying that the thing proposed 
is a physical impossibility, and that they always must laugh if 
they see a funny object. Of course the task proposed is not the 
practical one of seeing a ludicrous object and annihilating one’s 
tendency to laugh. It is the purely speculative one of subtract- 
ing certain elements of feeling from an emotional state sup- 
posed to exist in its fulness, and saying what the residual ele- 
ments are. I cannot help thinking that all who rightly appre- 
hend this problem will agree with the proposition above laid 
down. What kind of an emotion of fear would be left if the 
feeling neither of quickened heart-beats nor of shallow breath- 
ing, neither of trembling lips nor of weakened limbs, neither of 
goose-flesh nor of visceral stirrings, were present, it is quite 
impossible for me to think. Can one fancy the state of rage 
and picture no ebullition in the chest, no flushing of the face, no 
dilatation of the nostrils, no clenching of the teeth, no impulse 
to vigorous action, but in their stead limp muscles, calm 
breathing, and a placid face? The present writer, for one, cer- 
tainly cannot. The rage is as completely evaporated as the sens- 
ation of its so-called manifestations, and the only thing that 
can possibly be supposed to take its place is some cold-blooded
-P-A-G-E-684
  662 WILLIAM JAMES 
and dispassionate judicial sentence, confined entirely to the 
intellectual realm, to the effect that a certain person or persons 
merit chastisement for their sins. In like manner of grief: what 
would it be without its tears, its sobs, its suffocation of the 
heart, its pang in the breast-bone? A feelingless cognition that 
certain circumstances are deplorable, and nothing more. 
Every passion in turn tells the same story. A disembodied 
human emotion is a sheer nonentity. I do not say that it isa 
contradiction in the nature of things, or that pure spirits are 
necessarily condemned to cold intellectual lives; but I say that 
for us emotion dissociated from all bodily feeling is inconceiv- 
able. The more closely I scrutinize my states, the more per- 
suaded I become that whatever ‘ coarse’ affections and passions 
T have are in very truth constituted by, and made up of, those 
bodily changes which we ordinarily call their expression or con- 
sequence; and the more it seems to me that, if I were to become 
corporeally anesthetic, I should be excluded from the life of 
the affections, harsh and tender alike, and drag out an existence 
of merely cognitive or intellectual form. Such an existence, 
although it seems to have been the ideal of ancient sages, is too 
apathetic to be keenly sought after by those born after the 
revival of the worship of sensibility, a few generations ago. 
Let not this view be called materialistic. — It is neither more 
nor less materialistic than any other view which says that our 
emotions are conditioned by nervous processes. No reader of 
this book is likely to rebel against such a saying so long as it is 
expressed in general terms; and if any one still finds material- 
ism in the thesis now defended, that must be because of the 
special processes invoked. They are sensational processes, pro- 
cesses due to inward currents set up by physical happenings. 
Such processes have, it is true, always been regarded by the 
platonizers in psychology as having something peculiarly base 
about them. But our emotions must always be inwardly what 
they are, whatever be the physiological ground of their appazi- 
tion. If they are deep, pure, worthy, spiritual facts on any 
conceivable theory of their physiological source, they remain 
no less deep, pure, spiritual, and worthy of regard on this
-P-A-G-E-685
  PSYCHOLOGY 663 
present sensational theory. They carry their own inner meas- 
ure of worth with them; and it is just as logical to use the 
present theory of the emotions for proving that sensational 
processes need not be vile and material, as to use their vileness 
and materiality as a proof that such a theory cannot be true. 
This view explains the great variability of emotion. —If such 
a theory is true, then each emotion is the resultant of a sum of 
elements, and each element is caused by a physiological pro- 
cess of a sort already well known. The elements are all organic 
changes, and each of them is the reflex effect of the exciting 
object. Definite questions now immediately arise — questions 
very different from those which were the only possible ones 
without this view. Those questions were of classification: 
“Which are the proper genera of emotion, and which the spe- 
cies under each? ” — or of description: “‘ By what expression 
is each emotion characterized? ” The questions now are causal: 
“Just what changes does this object and what changes does that 
object excite? ” and “‘ How come they to excite these particular 
changes and not others? ” We step from a superficial to a deep 
order of inquiry. Classification and description are the lowest 
stage of science. They sink into the background the moment 
questions of causation are formulated, and remain important 
only so far as they facilitate our answering these. Now the 
moment an emotion is causally accounted for, as the arousal 
by an object of a lot of reflex acts which are forthwith felt, we 
immediately see why there is no limit to the number of possible dif- 
ferent emotions which may exist, and why the emotions of different 
individuals may vary indefinitely, both as to their constitution 
and as to the objects which call them forth. For there is nothing 
sacramental or eternally fixed in reflex action. Any sort of reflex 
effect is possible, and reflexes actually vary indefinitely, as we 
know. 
In short, any classification of the emotions is seen to be as true 
and as ‘ natural’ as any other, if it only serves some purpose; 
and such a question as ‘ What is the ‘ real’ or ‘ typical’ ex- 
pression of anger, or fear? ”’ is seen to have no objective mean- 
ing at all.. Instead of it we now have the question as to how
-P-A-G-E-686
  
664, WILLIAM JAMES 
any given ‘ expression’ of anger or fear may have come to 
exist; and that is a real question of physiological mechanics on 
the one hand, and of history on the other, which (like all real 
questions) is in essence answerable, although the answer may 
be hard to find. Ona later page I shall mention the attempts to 
answer it which have been made. 
A Corollary verified. — If our theory be true, a necessary 
corollary of it ought to be this: that any voluntary and cold- 
blooded arousal of the so-called manifestations of a special 
emotion should give us the emotion itself. Now within the lim- 
its in which it can be verified, experience corroborates rather 
than disproves this inference. Everyone knows how panic is 
increased by flight, and how the giving way to the symptoms of 
grief or anger increases those passions themselves. Each fit of 
sobbing makes the sorrow more acute, and calls forth another 
fit stronger still, until at last repose only ensues with lassitude 
and with the apparent exhaustion of the machinery. In rage, 
it is notorious how we ‘ work ourselves up’ to a climax by 
repeated outbreaks of expression. Refuse to express a passion, 
and it dies. Count ten before venting your anger, and its occa- 
sion seems ridiculous. Whistling to keep up courage is no mere 
figure of speech. On the other hand, sit all day in a moping 
posture, sigh, and reply to everything with a dismal voice, and 
your melancholy lingers. There is no more valuable precept in 
moral education than this, as all who have experience know . 
if we wish to conquer undesirable emotional tendencies in our- 
selves, we must assiduously, and in the first instance cold- 
bloodedly, go through the outward movements of those contrary 
dispositions which we prefer to cultivate. The reward of per- 
sistency will infallibly come, in the fading out of the sullenness 
or depression, and the advent of real cheerfulness and kindli- 
ness in their stead. Smooth the brow, brighten the eye, con- 
tract the dorsal rather than the ventral aspect of the frame, and 
speak in a major key, pass the genial compliment, and your 
heart must be frigid indeed if it do not gradually thaw! 
Against this it is to be said that many actors who perfectly 
mimic the outward appearances of emotion in face, gait, and
-P-A-G-E-687
  
PSYCHOLOGY 665 
voice declare that they feel no emotion at all. Others, however, 
according to Mr. Wm. Archer, who has made a very instructive 
statistical inquiry among them, say that the emotion of the 
part masters them whenever they play it well. The explanation 
for the discrepancy amongst actors is probably simple. The 
visceral and organic part of the expression can be suppressed in 
some men, but not in others, and on this it must be that the 
chief part of the felt emotion depends. Those actors who feel 
the emotion are probably unable, those who are inwardly cold 
are probably able, to affect the dissociation in a complete way. 
An Objection replied to. — It may be objected to the general 
theory which I maintain that stopping the expression of an 
emotion often makes it worse. The funniness becomes quite 
excruciating when we are forbidden by the situation to laugh, 
and anger pent in by fear turns into tenfold hate. Expressing 
either emotion freely, however, gives relief. 
This objection is more specious than real. During the expres- 
sion the emotion is always felt. After it, the centres having 
normally discharged themselves, we feel it no more. But where 
the facial part of the discharge is suppressed the thoracic and 
visceral may be all the more violent and persistent, as in sup- 
pressed laughter; or the original emotion may be changed, by 
the combination of the provoking object with the restraining 
pressure, into another emotion altogether, in which different and 
possibly profounder organic disturbance occurs. If I would kill 
my enemy but dare not, my emotion is surely altogether other 
than that which would possess me if I let my anger explode. — 
On the whole, therefore, this objection has no weight. 
The Subtler Emotions.—In the esthetic emotions the 
bodily reverberation and the feeling may both be faint. A con- 
noisseur is apt to judge a work of art dryly and intellectually, 
and with no bodily thrill. On the other hand, works of art may 
arouse intense emotion; and whenever they do so, the experi- 
ence is completely covered by the terms of our theory. Our 
theory requires that incoming currents be the basis of emotion. 
But, whether secondary organic reverberations be or be not 
aroused by it, the perception of a work of art (music, decoration,  
-P-A-G-E-688
  666 WILLIAM JAMES 
etc.) is always in the first instance at any rate an affair of in- 
coming currents. The work is an object of sensation; and, the 
perception of an object of sensation being a ‘ coarse’ or vivid 
experience, what pleasure goes with it will partake of the 
“coarse ’ or vivid form. 
That there may be subtle pleasure too, I do not deny. In 
other words, there may be purely cerebral emotion, independ- 
ent of all currents from outside. Such feelings as moral satisfac- 
tion, thankfulness, curiosity, relief at getting a problem solved, 
may be of this sort. But the thinness and paleness of these feel- 
ings, when unmixed with bodily effects, is in very striking con- 
trast to the coarser emotions. In all sentimental and impression- 
able people the bodily effects mix in: the voice breaks and the 
eyes moisten when the moral truth is felt, etc. Wherever there 
is anything like rapture, however intellectual its ground, we find 
these secondary processes ensue. Unless we actually laugh at 
the neatness of the demonstration or witticism; unless we thrill 
at the case of justice, or tingle at the act of magnanimity, our 
state of mind can hardly be called emotional at all. It is in fact 
a mere intellectual perception of how certain things are to be 
called — neat, right, witty, generous, and the like. Such a 
judicial state of mind as this is to be classed among cognitive 
rather than among emotional acts. 
Description of Fear. — For the reasons given on p. 656, I will 
append no inventory or classification of emotions or description 
of their symptoms. The reader has practically almost all the 
facts in his own hand. As an example, however, of the best 
sort of descriptive work on the symptoms, I will quote Darwin’s 
account of them in fear. 
“ Fear is often preceded by astonishment, and is so far akin 
to it that both lead to the senses of sight and hearing being 
instantly aroused. In both cases the eyes and mouth are widely 
opened and the eyebrows raised. The frightened man at first 
stands like a statue, motionless and breathless, or crouches 
down as if instinctively to escape observation. The heart beats 
quickly and violently, so that it palpitates or knocks against 
the ribs; but it is very doubtful if it then works more efficiently 
 
-P-A-G-E-689
  PSYCHOLOGY 667 
than usual, so as to send a greater supply of blood to all parts of 
the body; for the skin instantly becomes pale as during incipi- 
ent faintness. This paleness of the surface, however, is pro- 
bably in large part, or is exclusively, due to the vaso-mctor 
centre being affected in such manner as to cause the contrac- 
tion of the small arteries of the skin. That the skin is much 
affected under the sense of great fear, we see in the marvellous 
manner in which perspiration immediately exudes from it. 
This exudation is all the more remarkable, as the surface is 
then cold, and hence the term, a cold sweat; whereas the 
sudorific glands are properly excited into action when the sur- 
face is heated. The hairs also on the skin stand erect, and the 
superficial muscles shiver. In connection with the disturbed 
action of the heart the breathing is hurried. The salivary 
glands act imperfectly; the mouth becomes dry and is often 
opened and shut. I have also noticed that under slight fear 
there is strong tendency to yawn. One of the best marked symp- 
toms is the trembling of all the muscles of the body; and this is 
often first seen in the lips. From this cause, and from the dry- 
ness of the mouth, the voice becomes husky or indistinct or 
may altogether fail. ‘Obstupui steteruntque come, et vox fauci- 
bus hesit. . . . As fear increases into an agony of terror, we 
behold, as under all violent emotions, diversified results. The 
heart beats wildly or must fail to act and faintness ensue; there 
is a death-like pallor; the breathing is labored; the wings of the 
nostrils are widely dilated; there is a gasping and convulsive 
motion of the lips, a tremor on the hollow cheek, a gulping and 
catching of the throat; the uncovered and protruding eyeballs 
are fixed on the object of terror; or they may roll restlessly from 
side to side, huc illuc volens oculos totumque pererrat. The pupils 
are said to be enormously dilated. All the muscles of the body 
may become rigid or may be thrown into convulsive move- 
ments. The hands are alternately clenched and opened, often 
with a twitching movement. The arms may be protruded as if 
to avert some dreadful danger, or may be thrown wildly over 
the head. The Rev. Mr. Hagenauer has seen this latter action 
in a terrified Australian. In other cases there is a sudden and
-P-A-G-E-690
  668 WILLIAM JAMES 
uncontrollable tendency to headlong flight; and so strong is this 
that the boldest soldiers may be seized with a sudden panic.’ 1 
Genesis of the Emotional Reactions. — How come the vari- 
ous objects which excite emotion to produce such special and 
different bodily effects? This question was not asked till quite 
recently, but already some interesting suggestions towards 
answering it have been made. 
Some movements of expression can be accounted for as 
weakened repetitions of movements which formerly (when they 
were stronger) were of utility to the subject. Others are similarly 
weakened repetitions of movements which under other condi- 
tions were physiologically necessary concomitants of the useful 
movements. Of the latter reactions the respiratory disturbances 
in anger and fear might be taken as examples — organic reminis- 
cences, as it were, reverberations in imagination of the blowings 
of the‘man making a series of combative efforts, of the pantings 
ofonein precipitate flight. Such at least is a suggestion made by 
Mr. Spencer which has found approval. And he also was the 
first, so far as I know, to suggest that other movements in 
anger and fear could be explained by the nascent excitation of 
formerly useful acts. 
“To have ina slight degree,” he says, “ such psychical states 
as accompany the reception of wounds, and are experienced 
during flight, is to be in a state of what we call fear. And to 
have in a slight degree such psychical states as the processes 
of catching, killing, and eating imply, is to have the desires to 
catch, kill, and eat. That the propensities to the acts are no- 
thing else than nascent excitations of the psychical state in- 
volved in the acts, is proved by the natural language of the 
propensities. Fear, when strong, expresses itself in cries, in 
efforts to escape, in palpitations, in tremblings; and these are 
just the manifestations that go along with an actual suffering 
of the evil feared. The destructive passion is shown in a gen- 
eral tension of the muscular system, in gnashing of teeth and 
protrusion of the claws, in dilated eyes and nostrils in growls; 
and these are weaker forms of the actions that accompany the 
2 Origin of the Emotions (N. Y. ed.), p. 292.
-P-A-G-E-691
  PSYCHOLOGY 669 
killing of prey. To such objective evidences every one can add 
subjective evidences. Every one can testify that the psychical 
state called fear consists of mental representations of certain 
painful results; and that the one called anger consists of mental 
representations of the actions and impressions which would 
occur while inflicting some kind of pain.” 
The principle of revival, in weakened form, of reactions useful 
in more violent dealings with the object inspiring the emotion, has 
found many applications. So slight a symptom as the snarl or 
sneer, the one-sided uncovering of the upper teeth, is ac- 
counted for by Darwin as a survival from the time when our 
ancestors had large canines, and unfleshed them (as dogs now 
do) for attack. Similarly the raising of the eyebrows in outward 
attention, the opening of the mouth in astonishment, come, 
according to the same author, from the utility of these move- 
ments in extreme cases. The raising of the eyebrows goes with 
the opening of the eye for better vision; the opening of the 
mouth with the intensest listening, and with the rapid catching 
of the breath which precedes muscular effort. The distention 
of the nostrils in anger is interpreted by Spencer as an echo of 
the way in which our ancestors had to breathe when, during 
combat, their ‘‘ mouth was filled up by a part of an antagonist’s 
body that had been seized” (!). The trembling of fear is sup- 
posed by Mantegazza to be for the sake of warming the blood (!) 
The reddening of the face and neck is called by Wundt a com- 
pensatory arrangement for relieving the brain of the blood- 
pressure which the simultaneous excitement of the heart brings 
with it. The effusion of tears is explained both by this author 
and by Darwin to be a blood-withdrawing agency of a similar 
sort. The contraction of the muscles around the eyes, of which 
the primitive use is to protect those organs from being too much 
gorged with blood during the screaming fits of infancy, survives 
in adult life in the shape of the frown, which instantly comes 
over the brow when anything difficult or displeasing presents 
itself either to thought or action. 
“As the habit of contracting the brows has been followed 
by infants during innumerable generations, at the commence-   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-692
  670 WILLIAM JAMES 
ment of every crying or screaming fit,” says Darwin, ‘it has 
become firmly associated with the incipient sense of some- 
thing distressing or disagreeable. Hence, under similar cir- 
cumstances, it would be apt to be continued during maturity, 
although never then developed, into a crying fit. Screaming 
or weeping begins to be voluntarily restrained at an early 
period of life, whereas frowning is hardly ever restrained at any 
age.” 
Another principle, to which Darwin perhaps hardly does 
sufficient justice, may be called the principle of reacting 
similarly to analogous-feeling stimuli. There is a whole voca- 
bulary of descriptive adjectives common to impressions belong- 
ing to different sensible spheres — experiences of all classes are 
sweet, impressions of all classes rich or solid, sensations of all 
classes sharp. Wundt and Piderit accordingly explain many of 
our most expressive reactions upon moral causes as symbolic 
gustatory movements. As soon as any experience arises which 
has an affinity with the feeling of sweet, or bitter, or sour, the 
same movements are executed which would result from the 
taste in point. “ All the states of mind which language desig- 
nates by the metaphors bitter, harsh, sweet, combine them- 
selves, therefore, with the corresponding mimetic movements 
of the mouth.” Certainly the emotions of disgust and satisfac- 
tion do express themselves in this mimetic way. Disgust is an 
incipent regurgitation or retching, limiting its expression often 
to the grimace of the lips and nose; satisfaction goes with a suck- 
ing smile, or tasting motion of the lips. The ordinary gesture of 
negation — among us, moving the head about its axis from side 
to side — is a reaction originally used by babies to keep disa- 
greeables from getting into their mouth, and may be observed 
in perfection in any nursery. It is now evoked where the stimu- 
lus is only an unwelcome idea. Similarly the nod forward in 
affirmation is after the analogy of taking food into the mouth. 
The connection of the expression of moral or social disdain or 
dislike, especially in women, with movements having a per- 
fectly definite original olfactory function, is too obvious for
-P-A-G-E-693
  PSYCHOLOGY 671 
comment. Winking is the effect of any threatening surprise, not 
only of what puts the eyes in danger; and a momentary aver- 
sion of the eyes is very apt to be one’s first symptom of response 
to an unexpectedly unwelcome proposition. — These may suf- 
fice as examples of movements expressive from analogy. 
But if certain of our emotional reactions can be explained 
by the two principles invoked — and the reader will himself 
have felt how conjectural and fallible in some of the instances 
the explanation is — there remain many reactions which can- 
not so be explained at all, and these we must write down for the 
present as purely idiopathic effects of the stimulus. Amongst 
them are the effects on the viscera and internal glands, the dry- 
ness of the mouth and diarrhoea and nausea of fear, the liver- 
disturbances which sometimes produce jaundice after excessive 
rage, the urinary secretion of sanguine excitement, and the 
bladder-contraction of apprehension, the gaping of expectancy, 
the ‘ lump in the throat’ of grief, the tickling there and the 
swallowing of embarrassment, the ‘ precordial anxiety’ of 
dread, the changes in the pupil, the various sweatings of the 
skin, cold or hot, local or general, and its flushings, together 
with other symptoms which probably exist but are too hidden 
to have been noticed or named. Trembling, which is found in 
many excitements besides that of terror, is, pace Mr. Spencer 
and Sig. Mantegazza, quite pathological. So are terror’s other 
strong symptoms: they are harmful to the creature who pre- 
sents them. In an organism as complex as the nervous system 
there must be many incidental reactions which would never 
themselves have been evolved independently, for any utility 
they might possess. Sea-sickness, ticklishness, shyness, the love 
of music, of the various intoxicants, nay, the entire esthetic 
life of man, must be traced to this accidental origin. It would 
be foolish to suppose that none of the reactions called emo- 
tional could have arisen in this guasi-accidental way.

THE EMOTIONS 
Translated from the German* of H. Kurella by 
BENJAMIN RAND 
THE MECHANISM OF THE EMOTIONS 
WE approach now the question which possesses a vital in- 
terest from the psycho-physiological standpoint, and for that 
reason forms the centre of this investigation. The question 
concerns the nature of the relation between the emotions and 
their accompanying bodily expressions. 
Heretofore I have constantly used phrases, though under 
protest, such as “the physiological phenomena occasioned by 
the emotions, ” or ‘“‘ the physiological phenomena which accom- 
pany emotion,” etc. Ihave employed provisionally these cus- 
tomary expressions for the relation in question in order to be 
understood. Strangely enough up to the present time this 
relation never has been in any way accurately defined. I know 
of no attempt to determine its exact nature. The matter is very 
simple in the popular conception. Here emotions are entities, 
substances, forces, daemons, which seize man and produce in 
him bodily as well as mental manifestations: “ grief seized 
me,” ‘‘a joy came tome,” “ anger controlled me,” “‘ fear over- 
whelmed me,” etc. 
As often happens in popular and sometimes even in scientific 
psychology, this conception has rather a metaphorical than an 
explicative value. Modern psychology would scarcely adopt it,

THE EMOTIONS 673 
if it could offer in its place any more comprehensible or exact 
explanation. Most modern authors in the domain of scientific 
psychology do not enter? at all into this question. They ap- 
pear almost deliberately to pass it over in silence, in order pro- 
bably from the lack of a physiological explanation not to have 
recourse to the mysterious language of speculative psychology. 
Indeed one can say that scientific psychology also shares the 
theory, that the emotions induce and determine the accom- 
panying bodily expressions. But as to what emotions strictly 
are, that they can have such power over the body, one seeks, 
I think, in vain for any explanation in the whole of modern 
psychology. 
If we desire a clear understanding of the relation here dis- 
cussed, we must, as it appears to me, formulate the problem 
approximately in the following way. We have in every emo- 
tion as certain and manifest factors: (1) a cause, — a sense 
impression, which acts as a rule by the aid of memory, or of an 
associated idea; — and thereafter (2) an effect, namely, the 
previously discussed vasomotor changes, and further, issuing 
from them, the changes in the bodily and mental functions. 
The question now arises: 
What lies between these two factors? Is there anything at 
all? If I begin to tremble because I am threatened with a 
loaded pistol, does first a psychical process occur in me, does 
terror arise, and is that what causes my trembling, palpita- 
tion of the heart, and confusion of thought; or are these bodily 
phenomena produced directly by the terrifying cause, so that 
the emotion consists exclusively of the functional disturbances 
in my body? 
The answer to this question is, as one easily perceives, not 
merely of decisive significance for the psychology of the emo- 
tions; but also of the greatest practical significance for any 
physician, who has to do with the pathological results of vio- 
lent emotions. 
The current opinion, as already remarked, amounts to the 
1 Theexternal movement springs always from the inner, the emotion. Wundt’s 
Ueber den Ausdruck der Gemiithsbewegungen. Deutsche Rundschau, April, 1877. 
 
-P-A-G-E-696
  674 CARL GEORG LANGE 
statement, that the immediate effect of a process followed by 
an emoticon is of a purely psychical nature, (therefore, either 
the creation of a new mental force, or the modification of a pre- 
vious mental state). Furthermore, it affirms, that this event in 
the soul is the actual emotion, the true joy, sorrow, etc.; whereas 
the bodily phenomena are only subsidiary phenomena, which 
indeed are never lacking, but are nevertheless in and of them- 
selves wholly unessential. 
The purely psychical emotion is anhypothesis, and like every 
hypothesis, has its justification only if it fulfils two conditions: 
namely, (1) to explain the phenomena for which it is pro- 
pounded, and (2) that it be necessary for the explanation of 
these phenomena. 
Respecting the first of these conditions, the hypothesis in 
question has just as easy a task as all the metaphysical hy- 
potheses in general have. Without being restricted by objec- 
tions of experience, one can elaborate them at pleasure, attribut- 
ing to them any quality or power, and without further difficulty 
they perform every service that is required of them. But can 
psychical terror explain why one grows pale, or why one trem- 
bles? Although we do not understand the explanation, we are 
still free to assume it, and we are accustomed to be therewith 
content. 
If the hypothesis of the psychical nature of the emotions is 
accordingly unassailable at this point, (indeed more because it 
escapes, than because it stands criticism,) the question arises, 
whether it fulfils the second condition? Isit indispensable for 
the explanation of the group of phenomena which we call emo- 
tions? Can these phenomena be understood without its aid? 
Whoever would make clear to some one who has grown up 
with the common idea upon this subject, that if he is frightened 
his terror is only a perception of change in his body, would prob- 
ably encounter the following objection: “‘ Any such assump- 
tion of this relation is decisively contradicted by personal expe- 
rience, since we have in terror, as in every emotion, a perfectly 
distinct sensation of a peculiar change, or of a definite, psychical 
state, wholly independent of anything bodily.”
-P-A-G-E-697
  THE EMOTIONS 675 
I can readily understand, that this objection has very great 
significance for the majority, and is difficult to overcome. 
Nevertheless it has of course in and of itself not the least value. 
We have in factno absolute and immediate means of determin- 
ing whether a sensation is of a psychical or bodily character. 
Furthermore, no one is able to indicate the difference between 
psychical and somatic feelings. Whoever speaks of a psychical 
impression does so indeed solely upon the basis of a theory, 
and not upon an immediate perception. Without doubt, the 
mother who sorrows over her dead child would resist, pro- 
bably even become indignant, if anyone were to say to her, 
that what she feels, is the exhaustion and inertness of her 
muscles, the numbness in her bloodless skin, the lack of mental 
power for clear and rapid thought !— all of which is made clear 
by the idea of the cause of these phenomena. There is no reason, 
however, for her to be indignant, for her feeling is just as strong, 
as deep and pure, whether it springs from the one, or the other 
source. But it cannot exist without its bodily attributes. 
If from one terrified the accompanying bodily symptoms are 
removed, the pulse permitted to beat quietly, the glance to 
become firm, the color natural, the movements rapid and 
secure, the speech strong, the thoughts clear, — what is there 
left of his terror? 
If we cannot rely, therefore, in this question upon the testi- 
mony of personal experience, because it is here incompetent, 
the matter is thereby naturally not yet explained. If the 
hypothesis of psychical emotions be not made necessary by 
subjective experience, it may nevertheless be requisite if with- 
out it one cannot perhaps understand how the bodily man- 
ifestations of the emotions come into existence. 
We have consequently first to investigate, whether the bodily 
manifestations of the emotions can come into existence in 
1 T will not be deterred by the fact that it will probably be objected that one 
can feel pure psychical grief, joy, etc. if the emotion is not strong enough to 
lead to bodily symptoms. Such a supposition naturally rests only upon insuffi- 
cient observation, or because one regards purely subjective sensations — those 
of lightness or pressure, of strength or weakness — as psychical.
-P-A-G-E-698
| 676 CARL GEORG LANGE 
purely bodily ways. If that is the case, the necessity of the 
psychical hypothesis is thereby removed. 
In fact, it is not difficult to show from every day experience, 
which establishes and constantly verifies the truth, that emo- 
tions can be produced by many causes, which have nothing to 
do with movements of the mind; as on the other hand, that they 
can equally as well be checked and subdued by purely bodily 
means. It is known, though without clear consciousness of the 
true relation of things, that our entire mode of existence, our 
daily dietetics, has been formed during the course of genera- 
tions essentially with the aim to promote the agreeable emo- 
tions, and to lessen or entirely to remove the painful. I will 
merely cite a single example, and that will serve to recall others. 
It is one of the oldest experiences of mankind “that wine maketh 
glad the heart of man;” and the power of spirituous beverages 
to combat the closely related states of grief and fear, and to 
replace them with joy and courage, has found an application, 
which is in and for itself natural enough, and would be uncondi- 
tionally beneficial if the means did not possess in addition still 
other effects. 
We all understand why Jeppe ! drinks. It is because he will 
escape thereby from his conjugal troubles, and his fear of the 
master Erich. He will sing again, and recall the happy time 
when he was “in the militia.””. The glass makes him jovial and 
courageous, without the addition of a single pleasing or enliv- 
ening impression which could have any direct effect upon his 
mind, and without in the least forgetting his troubles or his 
enemies. All he wants is the influence of wine to view them in 
a manner different from the customary. He desires to impress 
his importance upon the sexton, and for once to chastise his wife. 
The alcohol has excited his vasomotor apparatus, has caused 
his heart to beat more rapidly and strongly, has enlarged his 
capillary ducts and thereby heightened his voluntary innerva- 
tions, and as a consequence, he talks loudly, sings, and blusters, 
instead of lingering about, whimpering, and whining on the 
public way. He has the feeling of warmth, airiness, and   1 Jeppe am Berge, a character in the classical comedy of Holberg.
-P-A-G-E-699
  THE EMOTIONS 677 
strength, in place of his customary limpness and incapacity. 
His dull brain awakes again to new life by the quick circulation 
of blood, the thoughts come in a rush, old memories revive and 
displace the wonted feeling of his daily misery. And all this 
is due merely to a “peg” of spirits, the effect of which upon the 
circulation we can understand, and which has no need of the 
intervention of the mind to act upon the vasomotor centre. 
All those who drink spirits have an experience of a similar 
nature to Jeppe’s, and thus we have it in general among the 
means of enjoyment, in addition to the many arrangements 
that we make to procure for ourselves comfort and well being. 
So long as we remain within the easy and customary routine of 
daily life, the connection between our emotional states and 
material influences, (e.g., nutrition), naturally comes only rarely 
into the foreground. The relation is otherwise in the enjoy- 
ment of certain substances, which act upon the body so power- 
fully that they are employed like drugs, or are ranked under 
the category of poisons. Thus it is known that the eating of 
certain fungi, especially the fly agaric, can produce the most 
violent paroxysms of fury, and of violence. It has been conjec- 
tured that our warlike ancestors used such means to create the 
right mood for martial enterprises; therefore entirely similar to 
the way, in which one to-day drinks spirits to “revive cour- 
age.” Fits of temper also often follow the partaking of hashish 
(indian hemp), which, ordinarily however like alcohol and 
opium, evokes a vivacious disposition, even outbursts of 
unbounded merriment. 
Certain emetics, as ipecacuanha and tartar emetic, produce 
a feeling of depression, which oftentimes resembles fear, some- 
times also grief, and like these emotions is accompanied by 
symptoms of collapse. 
If emotional states can be precipitated by the enjoyment of 
certain substances, or in other purely bodily ways, it follows 
that one can combat and abate painful emotions in the same 
way. If spirits or opium produce joy, they are an antidote 
for sorrow. 
The power of cold water to subdue temper and outbreaks of
-P-A-G-E-700
  678 CARL GEORG LANGE 
passion finds occasionally a practical use, and can, when ap- 
plied to the body, scarcely act directly upon the mind; but so 
much the more does it act upon the vasomotor functions. By 
the agency of a medicine, the well-known bromide of potas- 
sium, which causes paralysis of the vasomotor apparatus, we 
have it in our power not only to allay fear and anxiety, and 
similar uncomfortable emotions, but also, if we wish, to cause a 
perfectly apathetic condition, in which the individual is even 
as little able to become festive or sad, as anxious and angry, 
simply because the vasomotor functions are suspended. 
If the theory of the nature of the emotions here advocated, 
is well founded, we may in a general way expect that every 
action connected with functional changes of the vasomotor 
system must also have an emotional expression. Naturally we 
should not expect that emotions originated in this way would 
conform in every way with the phenomenon for which we com- 
monly reserve this designation; the differences in the causes na- 
turally must find expression in this domain through differences 
in the effects. The different psychical causes have also in reality 
effects which are not at all congruous. The fear of ghosts is not 
imagined in the same form as fear of the bullets of an enemy. 
Nevertheless, the similarity in many cases between the bodily 
and the psychically conditioned emotions has been sufficiently 
striking to force itself upon immediate apprehension, as the 
many linguistic designations clearly prove. Thus in all languages 
there is one and the same expression for mental and bodily 
pain. We have recognized their great physiological similarity, 
although the marked phenomenon of bodily pain, namely the 
subjective sensation in consequence of the transmission of the 
peripheral stimulus to the sensorium, is lacking in the case of 
mental pain. The cause of similarity of the physical to the 
emotional pain is the reflex innervation of the vascular nerves, a 
normal effect of every rather strong stimulation of the sensitive 
nerves. 
The term shudder, in this way, is the common designation in 
speech for the phenomena arising from the sudden effects of 
cold upon the skin, and also from terrifying impressions. That
-P-A-G-E-701
  THE EMOTIONS 679 
the naive intelligence recognizes no distinction between the 
shuddering due to emotional, and that due to purely bodily 
causes, we perceive in the fairy tale of the youth, who went 
forth in order to find out what shuddering was, and who after 
seeking in vain to discover it in the company of the dead and of 
ghosts, had his wish fulfilled when he was thrown from his bed 
into a tub of ice cold water, which produced a more painful 
effect upon his vasomotor apparatus than the sight of corpses, 
and of ghosts. 
The designation feverish for the man who is very impatient, 
likewise shows, that we have been impressed by the similarity 
which exists between the light symptoms of fever with their 
vasomotor disturbances, and those bodily conditions which 
are produced by disquieting expectations. 
As already remarked, I shall not enter in this small treatise 
more minutely into the large question concerning the relation 
of the emotions with the corresponding pathological states, or 
with mental and bodily diseases. 
But there exists in this connection a relation which I cannot 
pass entirely by, because it throws much light upon the question 
with which we are here occupied, that is, the necessity of the 
hypothesis of purely psychical emotions. If there is anything 
that in a striking way can prove the superfluous nature cf this 
hypothesis, it is certainly the circumstance that the emotions 
arise without being evoked by any external impression, or by 
any occurrence which acts upon our mental life,or by any mem- 
ory or association of ideas; and that they originate in optima 
forma solely upon the basis of the pathological conditions, which 
are developed in our bodies, or are inherited from parents. 
If we set out from the theory here advocated this cannot be 
astonishing; for the vasomotor apparatus can of course upon 
occasion become diseased as readily as any other portion of the 
nervous system, so that it functions in an abnormal manner, or 
cannot function at all. We may even regard it as especially 
exposed to the danger of functioning in a pathological manner, 
because it is that part of the nervous system which has least 
rest and is most frequently liable to functional disturbances.
-P-A-G-E-702

Where this happens in an individual, he becomes according 
to circumstances, depressed or distracted, anxious or unre- 
strainedly merry, embarrassed, etc. Everything is without 
apparent motive, and even though he is conscious of having no 
reason whatever for his anger, his fear, or his joy. Whereis there 
any support here for the hypothesis of psychical emotion? 
Such cases are extraordinarily frequent. Every alienist 
knows the sharply developed forms which appear as melan- 
cholia or mania; every physician who occupies himself at all 
thoroughly with nervous diseases has ample opportunity to ob- 
serve the even more instructive light forms on the borderland 
between the real diseases of the mind and mere depressions, 
such as are included under the ordinary names of irritability, 
oddity, and dejection. Very frequently we find the dejection, 
the imaginary grief, or even despair, which often results in sui- 
cide, combined with clear consciousness of the entire absence 
of a single psychical motive for grief. Not much less frequent is 
the pathological anxiety, which often accompanies that related 
emotion of grief, but often enough is found alone. It goes with- 
out saying, that joy appears more rarely in actual pathological 
manifestations. The mere circumstance that a joy appears 
without motive will naturally, at least among the laity, seldom 
suffice to cause it to be regarded as pathological, and still less to 
cause medical treatment to be sought for the cure of this state. 
For such action it will be commonly necessary, that either the 
joy manifest itself in an entirely unrestrained and immoderate 
manner in the form of a more or less pronounced mania, or that 
it alternate in a striking fashion with periods of dejection, and 
thus attract attention as something unnatural. The same holds 
true of anger. We are in fact accustomed, as regards this emo- 
tion, to put up with a good deal without surmising it to be any- 
thing pathological, and as a rule we.are not exacting as to its 
cause. But everything indeed has its limits, and there are 
outbreaks of anger often enough so groundless and unre- 
strained, that all will agree in recognizing them as manifesta- 
tions of a pathological state.

  THE MOTIONS 681 
scarcely anything that can be more clarifying with reference to 
+he diseased states of the mind here discussed, than the observ- 
ation of such a pathological paroxysm of temper. Especially 
is this true, if it appears wholly uncomplicated by other psychi- 
cal disturbances, as is the case in the form of illness which goes 
by the name of “ transitory mania,” and is indeed of rare occur- 
rence. The attack comes often without the least apparent cause 
to an otherwise entirely sane person, if disposed thereto; and 
throws him — to use the language of a recent writer+ upon this 
disease — into a state of wild paroxysm of rage, accompanied 
by a terrible and blindly furious impulse to injure and to 
destroy. The patient suddenly assails everything, strikes, 
kicks, and strangles whomsoever he can seize, throws every- 
thing about him that he can lay hands upon, breaks to pieces 
whatever comes near him, rends his clothes, screams, howls 
and roars with glaring rolling eyes, and thereby exhibits all 
the symptoms of vasomotor congestion which we have come to 
recognize as the accompaniment of madness. The face is 
flushed and swollen, the cheeks are hot, the eyes are bulging, 
their conjunctiva are filled with blood, the beating of the heart 
is increased, and the pulse reaches 100—120 strokes a minute. 
The neck arteries swell and throb, the veins are distended, the 
saliva flows. The fit lasts only a few hours, ends suddenly in 
a sleep of eight to ten hours duration, and upon waking the 
patient has entirely forgotten what has happened. 
The pathological emotions here mentioned, which originate 
as stated from abnormal bodily conditions, can appear also as 
the results of other diseases, or proceed from digestive de- 
rangements. They are on that account influenced also by the- 
rapeutic methods, and can be alleviated or cured. The transit- 
ory mania above described, which has so evidently its cause in 
a sudden congestion of the brain, can, according to the author 
cited, be checked oftentimes by a bandage of ice upon the head. 
I foresee here an objection which I shall not pass unnoticed 
in spite of its logical weakness. Undoubtedly many will say, in 
harmony with common usage, that the states which are occa- 
1 OQ. Schwartz, Die transitorische Tobsucht, Wien, 1880.
-P-A-G-E-704
682 CARL GEORG LANGE 
sioned by purely bodily influences or by diseased bodily condi- 
tions, can indeed be similar to the emotions, but they are not 
emotions. For example, the delirium that the fly agaric occa- 
sions, or that appears in mania, presents indeed the picture of 
rage, but is not “actual” rage, any more than the happiness 
which comes from drinking wine is “real” happiness. One 
cannot for that reason conclude from the absence of moral 
wrath in the person poisoned by fly agaric or possessed of a 
mania, that there does not exist at all any such purely psychi- 
cal state, provided the wrath is brought about in the ordinary 
way by a moral impression. 
It is easy to see that any such division of emotions into real 
and apparent, or any such limitation of the domain of real emo- 
tions is entirely arbitrary, and based upon a petitio principii. 
The reason of the claim to an exceptional position for the emo- 
tions of intellectual origin, as if they were the only real ones, is 
purely and solely the belief, that they are due to the activity of 
the mind. But that is precisely the question under discussion. 
In reality the difference between the passion of the warrior 
frenzied by the fly agaric, or of the maniac, and of one who has 
suffered a mortal offence, exists only in the difference and in the 
consciousness of the respective causes, or in the absence of the 
consciousness of any cause. If one desires upon this basis to es- 
tablish a distinction, there is naturally no objection to be made, 
provided only one is clear wherein the difference consists. 
Moreover it is not so easy, as it probably appears, to draw a 
sharp line of distinction between material and psychical causes 
of emotion; if we seek to analyse their physiological difference, 
it resolves itself into something physiologically quite irrelevant, 
and slips from our grasp. 
No one has ever thought of distinguishing a true emotion 
from one produced by an uncommonly loud noise. No one hesi- 
tates to regard it as a sort of fright; and in fact it shows all the 
usual characteristics of fright. And yet it is by no means united 
with the idea of danger, or in any way occasioned by an associa- 
tion of ideas, a memory, or any intellectual process whatever. 
The phenomena of fright follow the noise immediately without 
 
-P-A-G-E-705
THE EMOTIONS 683 
a trace of “mental” fear. Merely because of the noise of the 
report, many persons can never become accustomed to stand 
beside a cannon when it is discharged, although they know per- 
fectly well there is no danger, either for themselves or for others. 
The case, moreover, of the infant can be cited, which exhibits 
all the symptoms of fear whenever it hears a loud noise, and 
yet we cannot reasonably assume that the sound excited in the 
child any idea of danger. In this case, we must assume that if 
the vasomotor reflexes are not directly caused by the acoustic 
nerves, they are at least by the direct action of the acoustic cen- 
tres, and we have therefore an emotion of purely material 
origin.t We must therefore either exclude this fear from the 
true emotions, or we cannot strictly maintain the distinction 
between the mentally and the bodily conditioned emotions. 
We are placed in the same dilemma by the emotions, as a 
tule certainly less intensive but nevertheless sufficiently dis- 
tinct, which are produced by the simple impressions of the 
other sense organs, and are not united with any kind of associa- 
tion. Such are, for example, the pleasure from a charming 
color or combination of colors, the repugnance towards a dis- 
agreeable taste or odor, or the discomfort from a pain. 
Tf one has only once begun to feel uncertain about the estab- 
lishment of a line of demarcation between the mental and bod- 
ily causes of emotions, there arises a strong impulse to investi- 
gate what physiological significance can be attributed to their 
difference. One seeks then what difference exists in the cerebral 
mechanism of the emotions, according as they are determined 
by a so-called mental cause, or by one purely material. 
To-day with our still very imperfect knowledge of cerebral 
physiology, it is certainly not very tempting to make an at- 
tempt at an explanation of what takes place in the brain as the 
result of mental work. Naturally, we can only sketch some 
fundamental outlines very roughly, and, in truth, with every 
1 That we here deal with a simple reflex, immediately produced in the motor 
nerves, as Preyer appears to suppose (Die Seele des Kindes, 2te Aufl. p. 51) is 
not probable; partly because these motor phenomena have not in general the 
character of reflex movement excited by a sudden impression, and partly be- 
cause the effects in question are not confined to motor phenomena.

possible reserve with reference to the accuracy of the results. 
Nevertheless, in psychological investigations it is not only just- 
ifiable, but is also correct and useful to examine how closely we 
can approach a solution with our present physiological know- 
ledge. At all events we can take courage from the fact, that we 
know the relations here discussed — in their chief characteris- 
tics at least — are of their kind almost the simplest, and the 
easiest to fathom.* 
* “The only point,” says Th. Ribot in his The Psychology of the Emotions, “in 
which I differ from these authors [James and Lange] relates to their way of 
putting the proposition, not to its substance. 
“Tt is evident that our two authors,whether consciously or not, share the dualist 
point of view with the common opinion which they are combating; the only differ- 
ence being in the interversion of cause and effect. Emotion is a cause of which 
the physical manifestations are the effect, says one party; the physical manifesta- 
tions are the cause of which emotion is the effect, says the other. In my view, 
there would be a great advantage in eliminating from the question every notion 
of cause and effect, every relation of causality, and in substituting for the dual- 
istic position a unitary or monistic one. The Aristotelian formula of matter and 
form seems to me to meet the case better, if we understand by ‘matter’ the 
corporeal facts, and by ‘form’ the corresponding psychical state: the two terms, 
by-the-bye, only existing in connection with each other and being inseparable ex- 
cept as abstract conceptions. It was traditional in ancient psychology to study 
the relations of ‘the soul and the body’ — the new psychology does not speak of 
them. In fact, if the question takes a metaphysical form, it is no longer psychol- 
ogy; if it takes an experimental form, there is no reason to treat it separately, 
because it is treated in connection witheverything. No state of consciousness can 
be dissociated from its physical conditions: they constitute a natural whole, which 
must be studied as such. Every kind of emotion ought to be considered in this 
way: all that is objectively expressed by the movements of the face and body, by 
vasomotor, respiratory, and secretory disturbances, is expressed subjectively by 
correlative states of consciousness, classed by external observation according to 
their qualities. It is a single occurrence expressed in two languages. We have 
previously assimilated the emotions to psycho-physiological organisms; this 
unitary point of view, being more conformable to the nature of things and to the 
present tendencies of psychology, seems to me, in practice, to eliminate many 
objections and difficulties. Whether we adopt this theory or not, we have in 
any case acquired the certainty that the organic and motor manifestations 
are not accessories, that the study of them is part of the study of emotion.”

INTRODUCTION 
§ 1. THe ProBLEM oF PHysIOLOGICAL PsycHOLOGY 
TuE title of the present work is in itself a sufficiently clear 
indication of the contents. In it, the attempt is made to show 
the connexion between two sciences whose subject-matters are 
closely interrelated, but which have, for the most part, followed 
wholly divergent paths. Physiology and psychology cover, be- 
tween them, the field of vital phenomena; they deal with the 
facts of life at large, and in particular with the facts of human 
life. Physiology is concerned with all those phenomena of life 
that present themselves to us in sense perception as bodily 
processes, and accordingly, form part of that total environment 
which we name the external world. Psychology, on the other 
hand, seeks to give account of the interconnexion of processes 
which are evinced by our own consciousness, or which we infer 
from such manifestations of the bodily life in other creatures as 
indicate the presence of a consciousness similar to our own. 
This division of vital processes into physical and psychical 
is useful and even necessary for the solution of scientific prob- 
lems. We must, however, remember that the life of an organ-

  686 WILHELM WUNDT 
ism is really one; complex, it is true, but still unitary. We can, 
therefore, no more separate the processes of bodily life from 
conscious processes than we can mark off an outer experience, 
mediated by sense perceptions, and oppose it, as something 
wholly separate and apart, to what we call ‘inner’ experience, 
the events of our own consciousness. On the contrary: just as 
one and the same thing, e.g., a tree that I perceive before me, 
falls as external object within the scope of natural science, and 
as conscious contents within that of psychology, so there are 
many phenomena of the physical life that are uniformly con- 
nected with conscious processes, while these in turn are always 
bound up with processes in the living body. It is a matter of 
every-day experience that we refer certain bodily movements 
directly to volitions, which we can observe as such only in our 
consciousness. Conversely, we refer the ideas of external objects 
that arise in consciousness either to direct affection of the organs 
of sense, or, in the case of memory images, to physiological ex- 
citations within the sensory centres, which we interpret as 
after-effects of foregone sense impressions. 
It follows then, that physiology and psychology have many 
points of contact. In general, there can of course be no doubt 
that their problems are distinct. But psychology is called upon 
to trace out the relations that obtain between conscious pro- 
cesses and certain phenomena of the physical life; and physi- 
ology, on its side, cannot afford to neglect the conscious con- 
tents in which certain phenomena of this bodily life manifest 
themselves to us. Indeed, as regards physiology, the interde- 
pendence of the two sciences is plainly in evidence. Practically 
everything that the physiologists tell us, by way of fact or of 
hypothesis, concerning the processes in the organs of sense and 
in the brain, is based upon determinate mental symptoms: so 
that psychology has long been recognised, explicitly or im- 
plicitly, as an indispensable auxiliary of physiological investi- 
gation. Psychologists, it is true, have been apt to take a dif- 
ferent attitude towards physiology. They have tended to regard 
as superfluous any reference to the physical organism; they 
have supposed that nothing more is required for a science of
-P-A-G-E-709
PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY 687 
mind than the direct apprehension of conscious processes 
themselves. It is in token of dissent from any such standpoint 
that the present work is entitled a “ physiological psychology.” 
We take issue, upon this matter, with every treatment of psy- 
chology that is based on simple self-observation or on philo- 
sophical presuppositions. We shall, whenever the occasion seems 
to demand, employ physiology in the service of psychology. We 
are thus, as was indicated above, following the example of 
physiology itself, which has never been in a position to disre- 
gard facts that properly belong to psychology, — although it 
has often been hampered in its use of them by the defects of 
the empirical or metaphysical psychology which it has found 
current. 
Physiological psychology is, therefore, first of all psychology. 
It has in view the same principal object upon which all other 
forms of psychological exposition are directed: the investigation 
of conscious processes in the modes of connexion peculiar to them. 
It is not a province of physiology; nor does it attempt, as has 
been mistakenly asserted, to derive or explain the phenomena 
of the psychical from those of the physical life. We may read 
this meaning into the phrase ‘physiological psychology,’ just 
as we might interpret the title ‘microscopical anatomy’ to 
mean a discussion, with illustrations from anatomy, of what 
has been accomplished by the microscope; but the words should 
be no more misleading in the one case than they are in the other. 
As employed in the present work, the adjective ‘ physiological’ 
implies simply that our psychology will avail itself to the full 
of the means that modern physiology puts at its disposal for 
the analysis of conscious processes. It will do this in two ways. 
(1) Psychological inquiries have, up to the most recent times, 
been undertaken solely in theinterest of philosophy; physiology 
was enabled, by the character of its problems, to advance more 
quickly towards the application of exact experimental methods. 
Since, however, the experimental modification of the processes 
of life, as practised by physiology, oftentimes effects a concomi- 
tant change, direct or indirect, in the processes of consciousness, 
— which, as we have seen, form part of vital processes at large, 
 
-P-A-G-E-710
688 WILHELM WUNDT 
— it is clear that physiology is, in the very nature of the case, 
qualified to assist psychology on the side of method; thus ren- 
dering the same help to psychology that it itself received from 
physics. Inso far as physiological psychology receives assistance 
from physiology in the elaboration of experimental methods, 
it may be termed experimental psychology. This name suggests, 
what should not be forgotten that psychology, in adopting the 
experimental methods of physiology, does not by any means 
take them over as they are, and apply them without change to 
anew material. The methods of experimental psychology have 
been transformed — in some instances, actually remodelled — 
by psychology itself, to meet the specific requirements of psy- 
chological investigation. Psychology has adapted physiologi- 
cal, as physiology adapted psychical methods, to its own ends. 
(2) An adequate definition of life, taken in the wider sense, 
must (as we said just now) cover both the vital processes of 
the physical organism and the processes of consciousness. 
Hence, wherever we meet with vital phenomena that present 
the two aspects, physical and psychical, there naturally arises 
a question as to the relations in which these aspects stand 
to each other. So we come face to face with a whole series of 
special problems, which may be occasionally touched upon by 
physiology or psychology, but which cannot receive their final 
solution at the hands of either, just by reason of that division 
of labour to which both sciences alike stand committed. Experi- 
mental psychology is no better able to cope with them than is 
any other form of psychology, seeing that it differs from its 
rivals only in method, and not in aim or purpose. Physiologi- 
cal psychology, on the other hand, is competent to investigate 
the relations that hold between the processes of the physical and 
those of the mental life. And in so far as it accepts this second 
problem, we may name it a psychophysics. If we free this term 
from any sort of metaphysical implication as to the relation of 
mind and body, and understand by it nothing more than an 
investigation of the relations that may be shown empirically 
to obtain between the psychical and the physical aspects of 
vital processes, it is clear at once that psychophysics becomes
-P-A-G-E-711
  
PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY 689 
for us not, what it is sometimes taken to be, a science interme- 
diate between physiology and psychology, but rather a science’ 
thatis auxiliary to both. It must, however, render service more 
especially to psychology, since the relations existing between 
determinate conditions of the physical organisation, on the 
one hand, and the processes of consciousness, on the other, 
are primarily of interest to the psychologist. In its final purpose, 
therefore, this psychophysical problem that we have assigned 
to physiological psychology proves to be itself psychological. 
In execution, it will be predominantly physiological, since psy- 
chophysics is concerned to follow up the anatomical and physi- 
ological investigation of the bodily substrates of conscious 
processes, and to subject its results to critical examination with 
a view to their bearing upon our psychical life. 
There are thus: two problems which are suggested by the 
title “ physiological psychology ”’: the problem of method, which 
involves the application of experiment, and the problem of a 
psychophysical supplement, which involves a knowledge of the 
bodily substrates of the mental life. For psychology itself, the 
former is the more essential; the second is of importance mainly 
for the philosophical question of the unitariness of vital pro- 
cesses at large. As an experimental science, physiological 
psychology seeks to accomplish a reform in psychological in- 
vestigation comparable with the revolution brought about in 
the natural sciences by the introduction of the experimental 
method. From one point of view, indeed, the change wrought 
is still more radical: for while in natural science it is possible, 
under favorable conditions, to make an accurate observation 
without recourse to experiment, there is no such possibility 
in psychology. It is only with grave reservations that what is 
called ‘ pure self-observation’ can properly be termed observa- 
tion at all, and under no circumstances can it lay claim to ac- 
curacy. On the other hand, it is of the essence of experiment that 
wecan vary the conditions of anoccurrence at will and, if we are 
aiming at exact results, in a quantitatively determinable way. 
Hence, even in the domain of natural science, the aid of the ex- 
perimental method becomes indispensable whenever the prob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-712
  690 WILHELM WUNDT 
lem set is the analysis of transient and impermanent phenom- 
“ena, and not merely the observation of persistent and relatively 
constant objects. But conscious contents are at the opposite 
pole from permanent objects; they are processes, fleeting occur- 
rences, in continual fluxand change. In their case, therefore, the 
experimental method is of cardinal importance; it and it alone 
makes a scientific introspection possible. For all accurate obser- 
vation implies that the object of observation (in this case the 
psychical process) can be held fast by the attention, and any 
changes that it undergoes attentively followed. And this fixa- 
tion by the attention implies, in its turn, that the observed ob- 
ject is independent of the observer. Now it is obvious that the 
required independence does not obtain inany attempt at a direct 
self-observation, undertaken without the help of experiment. 
The endeavour to observe oneself must inevitably introduce 
changes into the course of mental events, — changes which 
could not have occurred without it, and whose usual conse- 
quence is that the very process which was to have been ob- 
served disappears from consciousness. The psychological ex- 
periment proceeds very differently. In the first place, it creates 
external conditions that look towards the production of a de- 
terminate mental process at a given moment. In the second 
place, it makes the observer so far master of the general situa- 
tion, that the state of consciousness accompanying this process 
remains approximately unchanged. The great importance of 
the experimental method, therefore, lies not simply in the fact 
that, here as in the physical realm, it enables us arbitrarily 
to vary the conditions of our observations, but also and essen- 
tially in the further fact that it makes observation itself pos- 
sible for us. The results of this observation may then be fruit- 
fully employed in the examination of other mental phenomena, 
whose nature prevents their own direct experimental modifica- 
tion. 
We may add that, fortunately for the science, there are other 
sources of objective psychological knowledge, which become 
accessible at the very point where the experimental method 
fails us. These are certain products of the common mental
-P-A-G-E-713
  PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY 691 
life, in which we may trace the operation of determinate psy- 
chical motives: chief among them are language, myth and cus- 
tom. In part determined by historical conditions, they are also, 
in part, dependent upon universal psychological laws; and the 
phenomena that are referable to these laws form the subject- 
matter of a special psychological discipline, ethnic psychology. 
The results of ethnic psychology constitute, at the same time, 
our chief source of information regarding the general psychology 
‘of the complex mental processes. In this way, experimental 
psychology and ethnic psychology form the two principal de- 
partments of scientific psychology at large. They are supple- 
mented by child and animal psychology, which in conjunction 
with ethnic psychology attempt to resolve the problems of psy- 
chogenesis. Workers in both these fields may, of course, avail 
themselves within certain limits of the advantages of the ex- 
perimental method. But the results of experiment are here mat- 
ters of objective observation only, and the experimental method 
accordingly loses the peculiar significance which it possesses 
as an instrument of introspection. Finally, child psychology 
and experimental psychology in the narrower sense may be 
bracketed together as individual psychology, while animal 
psychology and ethnic psychology form the two halves of a 
generic or comparative psychology. These distinctions within 
psychology are, however, by no means to be put on a level 
with the analogous divisions of the province of physiology. 
Child psychology and animal psychology are of relatively slight 
importance, as compared with the sciences which deal with the 
corresponding physiological problems of ontogeny and phylo- 
geny. On the other hand, ethnic psychology must always 
come to the assistance of individual psychology, when the de- 
velopmental forms of the complex mental processes are in 
question. 
§ 3. PREPSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS 
The human mind is so constituted, that it cannot gather 
experiences without at the same time supplying an admixture 
of its own speculation. The first result of this naive reflection  
-P-A-G-E-714
  692 WILHELM WUNDT 
is the system of concepts which language embodies. Hence, 
in all departments of human experience, there are certain con- 
cepts that science finds ready made, before it proceeds upon its 
own proper business, — results of that primitive reflection 
which has left its permanent record in the concept-system of 
language. ‘Heat’ and ‘light,’ e.g., are concepts from the world 
of external experience, which had their immediate origin in 
sense perception. Modern physics subsumes them both under 
the general concept of motion. But it would not be able to do 
this, if the physicist had not been willing provisionally to ac- 
cept the concepts of the common consciousness, and to begin 
his inquiries with their investigation. ‘Mind,’ ‘intellect,’ ‘rea- 
son,’ ‘ understanding,’ etc., are concepts of just the same kind, 
concepts that existed before the advent of any scientific psychol- 
ogy. The fact that the naive consciousness always and every- 
where points to internal experience as a special source of know- 
ledge, may, therefore, be accepted for the moment as sufficient 
testimony to the rights of psychology as science. And this ac- 
ceptance implies the adoption of the concept of ‘mind,’ to cover 
the whole field of internal experience. ‘ Mind,’ will accordingly 
be the subject, to which we attribute all the separate facts of 
internal observation as predicates. The subject itself is deter- 
mined wholly and exclusively by its predicates; and the refer- 
ence of these to a common substrate must be taken as nothing 
more than an expression of their reciprocal connexion. In say- 
ing this, we are declining once and for all to read into the con- 
cept of ‘mind’ a meaning that the naive linguistic consciousness 
always attaches to it. Mind, in popular thought, is not simply 
a subject in the logical sense, but a substance, a real being; and 
the various ‘activities of mind,’ as they are termed, are its 
modes of expression or action. But there is here involved a 
metaphysical presupposition, which psychology may possibly 
be led to honour at the conclusion of her work, but which she 
cannot on any account accept, untested, before ske has entered 
upon it. Moreover, it is not true of this assumption as it was of 
the discrimination of internal experience at large, that it is 
necessary for the starting of the investigation. The words
-P-A-G-E-715
  PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY 693 
coined by language to symbolise certain groups of experiences 
still bear upon them marks which show that, in their primitive 
meanings, they stood not merely for separate modes of existence, 
for ‘ substances,’ in general, but actually for personal beings. 
This personification of substances has left its most indelible 
trace in the concept of genus. Now the word-symbols of con- 
ceptual ideas have passed so long from hand to hand in the 
service of the understanding, that they have gradually lost all 
such fanciful reference. There are many cases in which we 
have seen the end, not only of the personification of substances, 
but even of the substantialising of concepts. But we are not 
called upon, on that account, to dispense with the use whether 
of the concepts themselves or of the words that designate them. 
We speak of virtue, honour, reason; but our thought does not 
translate any one of these concepts into a substance. They have 
ceased to be metaphysical substances, and have become logical 
subjects. In the same way, then, we shall consider mind, for 
the time being, simply as the logical subject of internal experi- 
ence. Such a view follows directly from the mode of concept- . 
formation employed by language, except that it is freed of all 
those accretions of crude metaphysics which invariably attack 
to concepts in their making by the naive consciousness. 
We must take up a precisely similar attitude to other ready 
made concepts that denote special departments or special re. 
lations of the internal experience. Thus our language makes a 
distinction between ‘mind’ and ‘spirit.’ The two concepts 
carry the same meaning, but carry it in different contexts: 
their correlates in the domain of external experience are ‘body’ 
and ‘matter.’ The name ‘ matter’ is applied to any object of 
external experience as it presents itself directly to our senses, 
without reference to an inner existence of its own. ‘Body’ is 
matter thought of with reference to such an inner existence. 
‘Spirit,’ in the same way, denotes the internal existence as 
considered out of all connexion with an external existence; 
whereas ‘mind,’ especially where it is explicitly opposed to 
spirit, presupposes this connexion with a corporeal existence, 
given in external experience.
-P-A-G-E-716
  694 WILHELM WUNDT 
While the terms ‘mind’ and ‘spirit ’ cover the whole field of 
internal experience, the various ‘mental faculties,’ as they are 
called, designate the special provinces of mind as distinguished 
by a direct introspection. Language brings against us an array 
of concepts like ‘sensibility,’ ‘feeling,’ ‘reason,’ ‘understand- 
ing,’ — a classification of the processes given in internal per- 
ception against which, bound down as we are to the use of these 
words, we are practically powerless. What we can do, however, 
and what science is obliged to do, is to reach an exact definition 
of the concepts, and to arrange them upon a systematic plan. 
It is probable that the mental faculties stood originally not 
merely for different parts of the field of internal experience, but 
for as many different beings; though the relation of these to the 
total being, the mind or spirit, was not conceived of in any very 
definite way. But the hypostatisation of these concepts lies 
so far back in the remote past, and the mythological interpre- 
tation of nature is so alien to our modes of thought, that there 
is no need here to warn the reader against a too great credulity 
in the matter of metaphysical substances. Nevertheless, there 
is one legacy which has come down to modern science from the 
mythopceic age. All the concepts that we mentioned just now 
have retained a trace of the mythological concept of force; they 
are not regarded simply as — what they really are — class- 
designations of certain departments of the inner experience, but 
are oftentimes taken to be forces, by whose means the various 
phenomena are produced. Understanding is looked upon as 
the force that enables us to perceive truth; memory as the 
force which stores up ideas for future use; and so on. On the 
other hand, the effects of these different ‘forces’ manifest them- 
selves so irregularly that they hardly seem to be forces in the 
proper sense of the word; and so the phrase ‘ mental faculties’ 
came in to remove all objections. A faculty, as its derivation 
indicates, is not a force that must operate, necessarily and im- 
mutably, but only a force that may operate. The influence of 
the mythological concept of force is here as plain as it could 
well be; for the prototype of the operation of force as faculty 
is, obviously, to be found in human action. The original 
 
-P-A-G-E-717
  PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY 695 
significance of faculty is that of a being which acts. Here, 
therefore, in the first formation of psychological concepts, we 
have the germ of that confusion of classification with ex- 
planation which is one of the besetting sins of empirical psy- 
chology. The general statement that the mental faculties are 
class concepts, belonging to descriptive psychology, relieves us 
of the necessity of discussing them and their significance at the 
present stage of our inquiry. As a matter of fact, one can quite 
well conceive of a natural science of the internal experience in 
which sensibility, memory, reason and understanding should 
be conspicuous by their absence. For the only things that we 
are directly cognisant of in internal perception are individual 
ideas, feelings, impulses, etc.; and the subsumption of these 
individual facts under certain general concepts contributes ab- 
solutely nothing toward their explanation. 
At the present day, the uselessness of the faculty-concepts is 
almost universally conceded. Again, however, there is one 
point in which they still exercise a widespread influence. Not 
the general class-concepts, but the individual facts that, in the 
old order of things, were subsumed under them, are now re- 
garded in many quarters as independent phenomena, existing 
in isolation. On this view there is, to be sure, no special faculty 
of ideation or feeling or volition; but the individual idea, the 
individual affective process, and the individual voluntary act 
are looked upon as independent processes, connecting with one 
another and separating from one another as circumstances 
determine. Now introspection declares that all these professedly 
independent processes are through and through interconnected 
and interdependent. It is evident, therefore, that their separa- 
tion involves just the same translation of the products of ab- 
straction into real things as we have charged to the account of 
the old doctrine of faculties,— only that in this case the ab- 
stractions come a little nearer to the concrete phenomena. An 
isolated idea, an idea that is separable from the processes of 
feeling and volition, no more exists than does an isolated 
mental force of ‘understanding.’ Necessary as these distinc- 
tions are, then, we must still never forget that they are based
-P-A-G-E-718
  696 WILHELM WUNDT 
upon abstractions, — that they do not carry with them any 
real separation of objects. Objectively, we can regard the in- 
dividual mental processes only as inseparable elements of inter- 
connected wholes.

II. PSYCHICAL COMPOUNDS 
§ 14. VOLITIONAL PROCESSES 
1. Every emotion, made up, as it is, of a unified series of in- 
terrelated affective processes, may terminate in one of two 
ways. It may give place to the ordinary, variable, and relatively 
unemotional course of feelings. Such effective processes which 
fade out without any special result, constitute the emotions 
in the strict sense, such as were discussed in the last paragraph. 
In a second class of cases the emotional process may pass into 
a sudden change in ideational and affective content, which 
brings the emotion to an instantaneous close; such changes in 
the sensation and affective state which are prepared for by an 
emotion and bring about its sudden end, are called volitional 
acts. The emotion together with its result is a volitional process. 
A volitional process is thus related to an emotion as a pro- 
cess of a higher stage, in the same way that an emotion is re- 
lated to a feeling. Volitional act is the name of only one part 
of the process, that part which distinguishes a volition from an 
emotion. The way for the development of volitions out of emo- 
tions is prepared by those emotions in connection with which 
external pantomimetic expressive movements appear. These 
expressive movements appear chiefly at the end of the pro- 
cess and generally hasten its completion; this is especially 
true of anger, but to some extent also of joy, care, etc. Still, 
in these mere emotions there is an entire absence of changes

in the train of ideas, which changes are the immediate causes of 
the momentary transformation of the emotion into volitions, and 
are also accompanied by characteristic feelings. 
This close interconnection of volitional acts with pantomi- 
metic expressive movements necessarily leads us to consider as 
the earliest stages of volitional development those volitions 
which end in certain bodily movements, which are in turn due 
to the preceding train of ideas and feelings. In other words, we 
come to look upon volition ending in external volitional acts, 
as the earliest stages in the development of volitions. The so- 
called internal volitional acts, on the other hand, or those which 
close simply with effects on ideas and feelings, appear in every 
case to be products of later development. 
2. A volitional process which passes into an external act 
may be defined as an emotion which closes with a pantomi- 
metic movement and has, in addition to the characteristics 
belonging to all such movements, the special property of pro- 
ducing an external effect which removes the emotion itself. Such 
an effect is not possible for all emotions, but only for those in 
which the very succession of component feelings produces feel- 
ings and ideas which are able to remove the preceding emotion. 
This is, of course, most commonly the case when the final result 
of the emotion is the direct opposite of the preceding feelings. 
The fundamental psychological condition for volitional acts 
is, therefore, the contrast between feelings, and the origin of the 
first volitions is most probably in all cases to be traced back 
to unpleasurable feelings which arouse external movements, 
which in turn produce contrasted pleasurable feelings. The seiz- 
ing of food to remove hunger, the struggle against enemies 
to appease the feeling of revenge, and other similar processes 
are original volitional processes of this kind. The emotions 
coming from sense-feelings, and the most widespread social 
emotions such as love, hate, anger, and revenge, are thus, both 
in men and animals, the common origin of will. A volition is 
distinguished in such cases from an emotion only by the fact 
that the former has added to its emotional components an ex- 
ternal act that gives rise to feelings which, through contrast
-P-A-G-E-721
  OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 699 
with the feelings contained in the emotion, bring the emotion 
itself to an end. The execution of the volitional act may then 
lead directly, as was originally always the case, or indirectly 
through an emotion of contrasted effective content, into the 
ordinary quiet flow of feelings. 
3. The richer the ideational and affective contents of experi- 
ence, the greater the variety of the emotions and the wider the 
sphere of volitions. There is no feeling or emotion which does 
not in some way prepare for a volitional act, or at least have 
some part in such a preparation. All feelings, even those of a 
relatively indifferent character, contain in some degree an 
effort towards or away from some end. This effort may be very 
general and aimed merely at the maintenance or removal of the 
present affective state. While volition appears as the most com- 
plex form of affective process, presupposing feelings and emo- 
tionsas its components, still, we must not overlook, on the other 
hand, the fact that single feelings continually appear which do 
not unite to form emotions, and emotions appear which do not 
end in volitional acts. In the total interconnection of psychical 
processes, however, these three stages are conditions of one 
another and form the related parts of a single process which is 
complete only when it becomes a volition. In this sense a feel- 
ing may be thought of as the beginning of a volition, or a voli- 
tion may be thought of as a composite affective process, and 
an emotion may be regarded as an intermediate stage between 
the two. 
4. The single feelings in an emotion which closes with a 
volitional act are usually far from being of equal importance. 
Certain ones among them, together with their related ideas, 
are prominent as those which are most important in preparing 
for the act. Those combinations of ideas and feelings which in 
our subjective consciousness are the immediate antecedents of 
the act, are called motives of volition. Every motive may be 
divided into an ideational and an affective component. The first 
we may call the moving reason, the second the impelling feeling 
of action. When a beast of prey seizes his victim, the moving 
reason is the sight of the victim, the impelling feeling may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-722
  700 WILHELM WUNDT. 
either the unpleasurable feeling of hunger or the race-hate 
aroused by the sight. The reason for a criminal murder may be 
theft, removal of an enemy, or some such idea, the impelling 
feeling the feeling of want, hate, revenge, or envy. 
When the emotions are of composite character, the reasons 
and impelling feelings are mixed, often to so great an extent 
that it would be difficuit for the author of the act himself to 
decide which was the leading motive. This is due to the fact 
that the impelling feelings of a volitional act combine, just 
as the elements of composite feelings do, to form a unitary 
whole in which all other impulses are subordinated to a single 
predominating one; the feelings of like direction strengthening 
and accelerating the effect, those of opposite direction weaken- 
ingit. In the combinations of ideas and feelings which we call 
motives, the final weight of importance in preparing for the act 
of will belongs to the feelings, that is, to the impelling feel- 
ings rather than to the ideas. This follows from the very fact 
that feelings are integral components of the volitional process 
itself, while the ideas are of influence only indirectly, through 
their connections with the feelings. The assumption that a 
volition may arise from pure intellectual considerations, or that 
a decision may appear which is opposed to the inclinations ex- 
pressed in the feelings, is a psychological contradiction in itself. 
It rests upon the abstract concept of a will which is trans- 
cendental and absolutely distinct from actual psychical voli- 
tions. The combination of a number of motives, that is, the 
combination of a number of ideas and feelings which stand out 
from the composite train of emotions to which they belong as 
the ideas and feelings which determine the final discharge of 
the act — this combination furnished the essential condition 
for the development of will, and also for the discrimination of 
the single forms of volitional action. 
5. The simplest case of volition is that in which a single 
feeling in an emotion of suitable constitution, together with its 
accompanying idea, becomes a motive and brings the process 
to a close through an appropriate external movement. Such 
volitional processes determined by a single motive, may be
-P-A-G-E-723
  
OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 701 
called simple volitions. The movements in which they terminate 
are designated impulsive acts. In popular parlance, however, 
this definition of impulse by the simplicity of the motive, is not 
sufficiently adhered to. Another element, namely, the char- 
acter of the feeling that acts as impelling force is, in popular 
thought, usually brought into the definition. All acts that 
are determined by sense-feelings, especially common feelings, 
are generally called impulsive acts without regard to whethera 
single motive or a plurality of motives is operative. This basis 
of discrimination is psychologically inappropriate and there is 
no justification for the complete separation to which it natu- 
rally leads between impulsive acts and volitional acts as speci- 
fically distinct kinds of psychical processes. 
By impulsive act, then, we mean a simple volitional act, 
that is, one resulting from a single motive, without reference 
to the relative position of this motive in the series of affective 
and ideational processes. Impulsive action, thus defined, must 
necessarily be the starting point for the development of all 
volitional acts, even though it may continue to appear later, 
along with the complex volitional processes. To be sure, the 
earliest impulsive acts are those which come from sense-feeling. 
Thus, most of the acts of animals are impulsive, but such im- 
pulsive acts appear continually in the case of man, partly as the 
results of simple sense emotions, partly as the products of the 
habitual execution of certain volitional acts which were origin- 
ally determined by complex motives (10). 
6. When several feelings and ideas in the same emotion 
tend to produce external action, and when those components 
of an emotional train which have become motives tend at the 
same time toward different external ends, whether related or 
antagonistic, then there arises out of the simple act a complex 
volitional process. In order to distinguish this from a simple 
volitional act, or impulsive act, we call it a voluntary act. 
Voluntary and impulsive acts have in common the charac- 
teristic of proceeding from single motives, or from complexes 
of motives which have fused together and operate as a single 
unequivocal impulse. They differ in the fact that in voluntary 
 
-P-A-G-E-724
  702 WILHELM WUNDT 
acts the decisive motive has risen to predominance from among 
a number of simultaneous and antagonistic motives. When a 
clearly perceptible conflict between these antagonistic motives 
precedes the act, we call the volition by the particular name 
selective act, and the process preceding it we call a choice. The 
predominance of one motive over other simultaneous motives 
can be understood only when we presuppose such a conflict 
in every case. But we are conscious of this conflict sometimes 
clearly, sometimes only vaguely. It is only in those cases in 
which we are clearly conscious of the conflict that we speak of 
choice in the narrower sense of the word. The difference be- 
tween a voluntary activity and a choice activity is therefore 
a vanishing quantity. We may say, however, that the ordin- 
ary voluntary process is one in which the psychological con- 
dition approaches in character impulsive activity, while in 
choice the difference between impulsive activity and the higher 
mode of behavior is always clear. We can represent these differ- 
ent relations, which appear at different stages of voluntary

field of consciousness, 
while the small circles within the large ones indicate an idea 
with a feeling tone which serves as the motive. The small 
circle which lies in the middle represents the decisive motive. 
Diagram A represents an impulsive activity, B a voluntary 
activity, and C a choice activity. In C alone the conflict of 
motives is represented. This is shown in the figure in the 
arrows which extend between the circles and the central point 
and represent the conflict of motives. 
7. The psychical process immediately preceding the act, 
in which process the final motive suddenly gains the ascend- 
ency, is called in the case of voluntary acts resolution, in the A B
-P-A-G-E-725
OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 703 
case of selective acts decision. The first word indicates merely 
that action is to be carried out in accordance with some con- 
sciously adopted motive; the second implies that several 
courses of action have been presented as possible and that a 
choice has finally been made. 
In contrast to the first stages of a volition, which can not be 
clearly distinguished from an ordinary emotional process, the 
last stages of volition are absolutely characteristic. They are 
especially marked by accompanying feelings which never ap- 
pear anywhere but in volitions, and must therefore be regarded 
as the specific elements peculiar to volition. These feelings are 
first of all feelings of resolution and feelings of decision. Feelings 
of decision differ from feelings of resolution only in the fact that 
the former are more intense. They are both exciting and relax- 
ing feelings, and may be united under various circumstances with 
pleasurable or unpleasurable factors. The relatively greater 
intensity of the feeling of decision is probably due to its contrast 
with the preceding feeling of dowbt which attends the wavering 
between different motives. The opposition between doubt and 
decision gives the feeling of relaxation a greater intensity. At 
the moment when the volitional act begins, the feelings of re- 
solution give place to the specific feeling of activity, which has 
its sensation substratum, in the case of external volitional 
acts, in the sensations of tension accompanying the move- 
ment. This feeling of activity is clearly exciting in its charac- 
ter, and may, according to the special motives, of the volition, 
be accompanied now by pleasurable, now by unpleasurable 
elements, which may in turn vary in the course of the act and 
alternate with one another. As a total feeling, this feeling of 
activity is a rising and falling temporal process extending 
through the whole act and finally passing into the widely 
differing feelings, such as those of fulfilment, satisfaction, or 
disappointment, or into the feelings and emotions connected 
with the special result of the act. Taking the process as seen 
in voluntary and selective acts as complete volitional acts, the 
essential reason for distinguishing impulsive acts from complete 
volitional acts is to be found in the absence of the antecedent 
 
-P-A-G-E-726
  704, WILHELM WUNDT 
feelings of resolution, and decision. The feeling connected 
with the motive passes in the case of impulsive acts directly 
into the feeling of activity, and then into the feelings which 
correspond to the effect of the act. 
8. The transition from simple to complex volitional acts 
brings with it a number of other changes which are of great 
importance for the development of will. The first of these 
changes is to be found in the fact that the emotions which 
introduce volitions lose their intensity more and more, as a 
result of the counteraction of different mutually inhibiting 
feelings, so that finally a volitional act may result from an 
apparently unemotional affective state. To be sure, emotion 
is never entirely wanting; in order that the motive which arises 
in an ordinary train of feelings may bring about a resolution 
or decision, it must always be connected with some degree 
of emotional excitement. The emotional excitement can, how- 
ever, be so weak and transient that we overlook it. We do this 
the more easily the more we are inclined to unite in the single 
idea of the volition both the short emotion which merely attends 
the rise and action of the motive, and the resclution and execu- 
tion which constitute the act itself. This weakening of the emo- 
tions results mainly from the combinations of psychical pro- 
cesses which we call intellectual development and of which we 
shall treat more fully in the discussion of the interconnec- 
tion of psychical compounds (§ 17). Intellectual processes can, 
indeed, never do away with emotions; such processes are, on 
the contrary, in many cases the sources of new and character- 
istic emotions. A volition entirely without emotion, determined 
by a purely intellectual motive, is, as already remarked (p. 
700), a psychological impossibility. Still, intellectual develop- 
ment exercises beyond a doubt a moderating influence on emo- 
tions. This is particularly true whenever intellectual motives 
enter into the emotions which prepare the way for volitional 
acts. This may be due partly to the counteraction of the feel- 
ings which generally takes place, or it may be due partly to the 
slow development of intellectual motives, for emotions usually 
are the stronger, the more rapidly their component feelings rise.
-P-A-G-E-727
  OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 705 
g. Connected with this moderation of the emotional ccm- 
ponents of volitions under the influence of intellectual motives, 
is still another change. It consists in the fact that the act which 
closes the volition is not an external movement. The effect 
which removes the exciting emotion is itself a psychical process 
which does not show itself directly through any external symp- 
tom whatever. Such an effect which is imperceptible for ob- 
jective observation is called an internal volitional act. The 
transition from external to internal volitional acts is so bound 
up with intellectual development that the very character of 
the intellectual processes themselves is to be explained to a 
great extent by the influence of volitions on the train of ideas 
($15, 9). The act which closes the volition in such a case is 
some change in the train of ideas, which change follows the pre- 
ceding motives as the result of some resolution or decision. The 
feelings which accompany these acts of immediate preparation, 
and the feeling of activity connected with the change itself, 
agree entirely with the feelings observed in the case of external 
volitional acts. Furthermore, action is followed by more or less 
intense feelings of satisfaction, and a removal of preceding emo- 
tional and affective strain. The only difference, accordingly, 
between these special volitions connected with the intellectual 
development and the earlier forms of volition, is to be found 
in the fact that here the final effect of the volition does not 
show itself in an external bodily movement. 
Still, we may have a bodily movement as the secondary 
result of an internal volitional act, when the resolution refers to 
anexternal act to be executed at some later time. Insuchacase 
the act itself always results from a second, later volition. The 
decisive motives for this second process come, to be sure, from 
the preceding internal volition, but the two are nevertheless 
distinct and different processes. Thus, for example, the forma- 
tion of a resolution to execute an act in the future under cer- 
tain expected conditions, is an internal volition, while the later 
performance of the act is an external action different from the 
first, even though requiring the first as a necessary antecedent. 
It is evident that where an external volitional act arises from 
 
-P-A-G-E-728
    706 WILHELM WUNDT 
a decision after a conflict among the motives, we have a transi- 
tional form in which it is impossible to distinguish clearly be- 
tween the two kinds of volition, namely, that which consists 
in a single unitary process and that which is made up of two 
processes, that is, of an earlier and a later volition. In sucha 
transitional form, if the decision is at all separated in time 
from the act itself, the decision may be regarded as an internal 
volitional act preparatory to the execution. 
10. These two changes which take place during the develop- 
ment of will, namely, the moderation of emotions and the ren- 
dering independent of internal volitions, are changes of a pro- 
gressive order. In contrast with these there is a third process 
which is one of retrogradation. When complex volitions with the 
same motive are often repeated, the conflict between the 
motives grows less intense; the opposing motives which were 
overcome in earlier cases grow weaker and finally disappear 
entirely. The complex act has then passed into a simple, or im- 
pulsive act. This retrogradation of complex volitional processes 
shows clearly the utter inappropriateness of the limitation of 
the concept “impulsive” to acts of will arising from sense- 
feelings. As a result of the gradual elimination of opposing mo- 
tives, there are intellectual, moral, and esthetic, as well as 
simple sensuous, impulsive acts. 
This regressive development is but one step in a process 
which unites all the external acts of living being, whether they 
are volitional acts or automatic reflex movements. When the 
habituating practice of certain acts is carried further, the de- 
termining motives finally become, even in impulsive acts, 
weaker and more transient. The external stimulus originally 
aroused a strongly affective idea which operated as a motive, 
but now the stimulus causes the discharge of the act before 
it can arouse an idea. In this way the impulsive movement 
finally becomes an automatic movement. The more often this 
automatic movement is repeated, the easier it, in turn, becomes, 
even when the stimulus is not sensed, as for example in deep 
sleep or during complete diversion of the attention. The move- 
ment now appears as a pure physiological reflex, and the voli- 
tional process has become a simple reflex process.
-P-A-G-E-729
  OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 707 
This gradual reduction of volitional to mechanical processes, 
which depends essentially on the elimination of all the psychical 
elements between the beginning and end of the act, may take 
‘place either in the case of movements which were originally 
impulsive, or in the case of movements which have become 
impulsive through the retrogradation of voluntary acts. It is 
not improbable that all the reflex movements of both animals 
and men originate in this way. As evidence of this we have, 
besides the above described reduction of volitional acts through 
practice to pure mechanical processes, also the purposeful 
character of reflexes, which points to the presence at some time 
of purposive ideas as motives. Furthermore, the fact that the 
movements of the lowest animals are all evidently simple vo- 
litional acts, not reflexes, tells for the same view, so that here 
too there is no justification for the assumption frequently made 
that acts of will have been developed from reflex movements. 
Finally, we can most easily explain from this point of view the 
fact mentioned in § 13, namely, that expressive movements may 
belong to any one of the forms possible in the scale of external 
acts. Obviously the simplest movements are impulsive acts, 
while many complicated pantomimetic movements probably 
came originally from voluntary acts which passed first into 
impulsive and then into reflex movements. Observed phenom- 
ena make it necessary to assume that the retrogradations . 
which begin in the individual life are gradually carried fur- 
ther through the transmission of acquired dispositions, so 
that certain acts which were originally voluntary may appear 
from the first in later descendants as impulsive or reflex move- 
ments. 
11. The exact observation of volitional processes is, for 
the reasons given above, impossible in the case of volitional 
acts which come naturally in the course of life; the only way 
in which a thorough psychological investigation can be made, 
is, therefore, through experimental observation. To be sure, 
we can not produce volitional processes of every kind whenever 
we wish to do so, we must limit ourselves therefore to the ob-

  708 WILHELM WUNDT 
servation of such processes as can be easily influenced through 
external means, namely such as begin with external stimula- 
tions and terminate in external acts. The experiments which 
serve this purpose are called reaction experiments. They may 
be described in their essentials as follows. A volitional process 
of simple or complex character is incited by an external sense- 
stimulus and then after the occurrence of certain psychical 
processes which serve in part as motives, the volition is brought 
to an end by a motor reaction. Reaction experiments have a 
second and more general significance in addition to their signi- 
ficance as means for the analysis of volitional processes. They 
furnish means for the measurement of the rate of certain psy- 
chical and psycho-physical processes. 
The simplest reaction experiment that can be tried is as fol- 
lows. At the end of a short but always uniform interval (2—3 
sec.) after a signal which serves to concentrate the attention 
has been given, an external stimulus is allowed to act on some 
sense-organ. At the moment when the stimulus is perceived, 
a movement which has been determined upon and prepared 
before, as, for example, a movement of the hand is executed. 
The psychological conditions in this experiment correspond es- 
sentially to those of a simple volition. The sense impression 
serves as a simple motive, and this is to be followed invariably 
. by a particular act. If now we measure objectively by means 
of either graphic or other chronometric apparatus, the interval 
which elapses between the action of the stimulus and the execu- 
tion of the movement, it will be possible, by frequently repeated 
experiments of the same kind, to become thoroughly acquainted 
with the subjective processes which make up the whole 
reaction, while at the same time the results of the objective 
measurement will furnish a check for the constancy or possible 
variations in these subjective processes. This check is especially 
useful in those cases where some condition in the experiment, 
and thereby the subjective course of the volition itself, is inten- 
tionally modified. 
12. Such a modification may, indeed, be introduced even 
in the simple form of the experiment just described, by vary-
-P-A-G-E-731
  OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 709 
ing the way in which the reactor prepares, before the appear- 
ance of the stimulus, for the execution of the act. When the 
preparation is of such a character that expectation is directed 
toward the stimulus which is to serve as a motive, and the ex- 
ternal act does not take place until the stimulus is clearly re- 
cognized, there results a complete or sensorial form of reaction. 
When, on the other hand, the preparatory expectation is so 
directed toward the act, that the movement follows the recep- 
tion of the stimulus as rapidly as possible, there results a short- 
ened form of reaction, or the so-called muscular reaction. In 
the first case the ideational factor of the expectation is a pale 
memory image of the familiar sense impression. When the 
period of preparation is more extended, this image oscillates 
between alternating clearness and obscurity. The effective 
element is a feeling of expectation which oscillates in a similar 
manner and is connected with sensations of strain from the 
sense-organ to be affected, as for example with tension of the 
tympanic membrane, or of the ocular muscles of accommoda- 
tion and movement. At the moment when the impression ar- 
rives the preparatory feelings and sensations mentioned are fol- 
lowed by a comparatively weak relieving feeling of surprise. 
This surprise in turn gives place to a clearly subsequent arous- 
ing feeling of activity which accompanies the reaction move- 
ment and appears in conjunction with the inner tactual sensa- 
tions. In the second case, on the other hand, where the reaction 
is of the shortened form, we may observe during the period of 
preparatory expectation a pale, wavering memory image of 
the motor organ which is to react (e. g., the hand) together 
with strong sensations of strain in the same, and a fairly con- 
tinuous feeling of expectation connected with these sensations. 
At the moment when the stimulus arrives the state of expecta- 
tion gives place to a strong feeling of surprise. There connect 
with this surprise both the feeling of activity which accom- 
panies the reaction and also the sensations which arise in the 
reaction. So rapid is this connection that the surprise and the 
subsequent state are not distinguished at all, or at most cnly 
very vaguely. The sensorial reaction-time is on the average
-P-A-G-E-732
  710 WILHELM WUNDT 
0.2T0—0.290 sec. ; muscular reaction-time averages from 0.100— 
0.180 sec. (the shortest time is for sound, the longest for light). 
13. By introducing special conditions we may make com- 
plete and shortened reactions the starting points for the study 
of the development of volitions in two different directions. Com- 
plete (sensorial) reactions furnish the means of passing from 
simple to complex volitions because we can in this case easily 
insert different psychical processes between the perception of 
the impression and the execution of the reaction. Thus we have 
a voluntary act of relatively simple character when we allow an 
act of direct sensory cognition and discrimination to follow the 
perception of the impression and then let the movement depend 
on this second process. In this case, not the immediate impres- 
sion, but the idea which results from the act of cognition or 
discrimination is the motive for the act to be performed. This 
motive is only one of a greater or smaller number of equally 
possible motives which could have come up in place of it; as a 
result the reaction movement takes on the character of a volun- 
tary act. In fact, we may observe clearly the feeling of resolu- 
tion antecedent to the act and also the feelings preceding the 
’ feeling of resolution and connected with the perception of the 
impression. This is still more emphatically the case, and the 
succession of ideational and affective processes is at the same 
time more complicated, when we bring in still another psychical 
process, as for example memory processes, to serve as the motive 
for the execution of the movement. Finally, the voluntary 
process becomes one of choice when in such experiments the act 
is not merely influenced by a plurality of motives in such a way 
that several must follow one another before one determines the 
act, but when, in addition to that, one of a number of possible 
different acts is decided upon according to the motive presented. 
This kind of reaction takes place when preparations are made 
for different movements, for example one with the right hand 
another with the left hand, or one with each of the ten fingers, 
and the condition is prescribed for each movement that an im- 
pression of a particular quality shall serve as its motive, for 
example the impression blue for the right hand, red for the left.
-P-A-G-E-733

14. Shortened (muscular) reactions, on the contrary, may 
be used to investigate the retrogradation of volitional acts as 
they become reflex movements. In this form of reaction the 
preparatory expectation is directed entirely toward the ex- 
ternal act which is to be executed as rapidly as possible, so that 
voluntary inhibition or execution of the act in accordance with 
the special character of the impression can here not take place. 
In other words, a transition from simple to complex acts of will, 
is in this case impossible. On the other hand, it is easy by prac- 
tice so to habituate one’s self to the invariable connection of 
an impression and a particular movement, that the process 
of perception fades out more and more or takes place after the 
motor impulse, so that finally the movement becomes just like 
a reflex movement. This reduction of volition to a mechanical 
process, shows itself objectively most clearly in the shortening 
of the objective time to that observed for pure reflexes, and 
shows itself subjectively in the fact that for psychological ob- 
servation there is a complete coincidence in point of time, of 
impression and reaction, while the characteristic feeling of re- 
solution gradually disappears entirely. 
Ill. INTERCONNECTION OF PSYCHICAL 
COMPOUNDS 
§17. APPERCEPTIVE COMBINATIONS. 
1. Associations in all their forms are regarded by us as 
passive experiences, because the feeling of activity, which is 
characteristic of all processes of volition and attention, never 
arises except as it is added to the already completed association 
process in a kind of apperception of the resultant, given content. 
Associations are, accordingly, processes which can arouse 
volitions but are not themselves directly influenced by voli- 
tions. This absence of any dependence on volition is, however, 
the criterion of a passive process. 
The case is essentially different with the second kind of 
combinations which are formed between different psychical
-P-A-G-E-734
  712 WILHELM WUNDT 
compounds and their elements, namely, the apperceptive com- 
binations. Here the feeling of activity with its accompanying 
variable sensations of tension does not merely follow the com- 
binations as an after-effect produced by them, but it precedes 
them so that the combinations themselves are immediately re- 
cognized as formed with the aid of attention. In this sense these 
experiences are called active experiences. 
2. Apperceptive combinations include a large number of 
psychical processes which are distinguished in popular parlance 
under the general terms thinking, reflection, imagination, and 
understanding. These are all regarded as psychical processes 
of a type higher than sense perceptions or pure memory pro- 
cesses, while at the same time they are all looked upon as dif- 
ferent from one another. Especially is this true of the so-called 
functions of imagination and understanding. In contrast with 
this loose view of the faculty theory, association psychology 
sought to find a unitary principle by subsuming also the apper- 
ceptive combinations of ideas under the general concept of as- 
sociation, and at the same time limiting the concept, as noted 
above,! to successive association. This reduction to successive 
association was effected either by neglecting the essential sub- 
jective and objective distinguishing marks of apperceptive 
combinations, or by attempting to avoid the difficulties of an 
explanation, through the introduction of certain supplementary 
concepts taken from popular psychology. Thus, “ interest” 
and “intelligence” were credited with an influence on associa- 
tions. Very often this view was based on the erroneous notion 
that the recognition of certain distinguishing features in apper- 
ceptive combinations and associations meant the assertion of 
a fundamental division between the former and the latter. Of 
course, this is not true. All psychical processes are connected 
with associations as much as with the original sense percep- 
tions. Yet, just as associations always form a part of every 
sense perception and in spite of that appear in memory pro- 
cesses as relatively independent processes, so apperceptive 
combinations are based always on associations, but the essen- 
1 Outlines of Psychology, p. 251.
-P-A-G-E-735
OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 713 
tial attributes of these apperceptive combinations are not 
traceable to associations. 
3. In trying to account for the essential attributes of apper- 
ceptive combinations, we may divide the psychical processes 
which belong to this class into simple and complex ap perceptive 
functions. The simple functions are those of relating and com- 
paring, the complex those of synthesis and analysis. 
A. Simple Apperceptive Functions (Relating and Comparing). 
4. The most elementary apperceptive function is that of 
relating two psychical contents to each other. The grounds for such 
relating are always given in the single psychical compounds 
and their associations, but the actual carrying out of the pro- 
cess itself is a special apperceptive activity through which the 
relation itself becomes a special conscious content, distinct 
from the contents which are related, though indeed inseparably 
connected with them. For example, when we recognize the 
identity of an object with one perceived before, or when we are 
conscious of a definite relation between a remembered event 
and a present impression, there is in both cases a relating 
apperceptive activity connected with the associations. 
So long as the recognition remains a pure association, the pro- 
cess of relating is limited to the feeling of familiarity which fol- 
lows the assimilation of the new impression either immediately, 
or after a short interval. When, on the contrary, apperception 
is added to association, this feeling is supplied with a clearly 
recognized ideational substratum. The earlier perception and 
the new impression are separated in time and then brought 
into a relation of agreement on the basis of their essential at- 
tributes. The case is similar when we become conscious of the 
motives of amemoryact. This also presupposes that a compari- 
son of the memory image with the impression which occasioned 
it, is added to the merely associative process which gave rise 
to the image. This, it will be seen, is a process that can be 
brought about only through attention. 
5. Thus, the relating function is brought into activity through 
associations, wherever these associations themselves or their
-P-A-G-E-736
  714 WILHELM WUNDT 
products are made the objects of voluntary observation. The 
relating function is connected, as the examples mentioned 
show, with the function of comparing, whenever the related 
contents of consciousness are clearly separated processes, be- 
longing to one and the same class of psychical experiences. 
Relating activity is, therefore, the wider concept, comparison 
is the narrower. A comparison is possible only when the com- 
pared contents are brought into relation with one another. On 
the other hand, conscious contents may be related without be- 
ing compared with one another, as is the case, for example, 
when an attribute is related to its object, or when one process 
is related to another which regularly follows or precedes it. As 
a result of this it follows that where the fuller conditions neces- 
sary for a comparison are present, the experiences given may be 
merely related, or they may also be compared with each other. 
Thus, one calls it relating when he thinks of a present impres- 
sion as the reason for remembering an earlier experience; he 
calls it comparing, on the other hand, when he establishes cer- 
tain definite points of agreement or difference between the 
earlier and the present impression. 
6. The process of comparing is, in turn, made up of two ele- 
mentary functions which are asa ruleintimately interconnected. 
These two elementary functions are first, the perception of agree- 
ments, and second, the perception of differences. There is a mis- 
taken view’ prevalent even in present-day psychology. It 
originated in popular psychology and was strengthened by the 
discussions of logical intellectualism. It consists in the accept- 
ance of the notion that the mere existence of psychical ele- 
ments and compounds is identical with their apperceptive 
comparison. Every sensation is accordingly treated as a “sens- 
ory judgment,” every immediate perception of distance as 
a “judgment of depth,” and so on through the whole series of 
processes. In all these cases, however, the judgment appears 
after the sensations and ideas; the judgment must, therefore, 
be recognized as a separate process. To be sure, agreements 
and differences arise in our psychical processes, if they did 
not we could not observe them. But the comparing activity
-P-A-G-E-737
  OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 715 
through which these likenesses and differences in sensations and 
ideas are made evident, is not identical with the sensations and 
ideas themselves. It is a function which may arise in connection 
with these elements, but does not necessarily so arise. 
7. Even the psychical elements, that is, sensations, and 
simple feelings, can be compared with reference to their agree- 
ments and differences. Indeed, it is through a series of such 
comparison that we arrange these psychical elements into sys- 
tems, each one of which contains the elements which are most 
closely related. Within a given system two kinds of comparison 
are possible, namely, comparison in respect to quality and 
comparisons in respect to intensity. Then, too, a comparison 
between grades of clearness is possible when attention is paid 
to the way in which the elements appear in consciousness. 
In the same way comparison is applied to intensive and exten- 
sive psychical compounds. Every psychical element and every 
psychical compound, in so far as it is a member of a regular sys- 
tem, constitutes a psychical magnitude. A determination of the 
value of such a psychical magnitude is possible only through 
comparison with some other magnitude in the same system. 
Psychical magnitude is, accordingly, an original attribute of 
every psychical element and compound. It is of various kinds, 
as intensity, quality, extensive (spatial and temporal) value, 
and when the different states of consciousness are considered, 
clearness. But the determination of psychical value can be 
effected only through the apperceptive function of comparison. 
8. Psychical measurement differs from physical measurement 
in the fact that the latter may be carried out in acts of com- 
parison separated almost indefinitely in time, because its ob- 
jects are relatively constant. For example, we can determine 
the height of a certain mountain to-day with a barometer and 
then after a long time we may determine the height of another 
mountain, and if no sensible changes in the configuration of the 
land have taken place in the interval, we can compare the re- 
sults of our two measurements. Psychical compounds, on the 
other hand, are not relatively permanent objects, but contin- 
ually changing processes, so that we can compare two such
-P-A-G-E-738
  716 WILHELM WUNDT 
psychical magnitudes only when other conditions remain the 
same, and when the two factors to be compared follow each 
other in immediate succession. These requirements have as 
their immediate corollaries: first, that there is no absolute 
standard for the comparison of psychical magnitudes, but 
every such comparison stands by itself and is of merely relative 
validity; second, that finer comparisons are possible only be- 
tween psychical magnitudes of the same dimension, so that a 
reduction, analogous to that by which the most widely separated 
physical quantities, such as periods of time and physical forces, 
are all expressed in terms of one dimension of space, is out of the 
question in psychical comparisons. 
‘g. It follows that the possible relations between psychical 
magnitudes which can be established by direct comparison 
are limited in number. The establishment of such relations 
is possible only in certain particularly favorable cases. These 
favorable cases are (r) the equality between two psychical mag- 
nitudes and (2) the just noticeable difference between two such 
magnitudes, as for example two sensation intensities of like 
quality, or two qualities of like intensity belonging to the same 
dimension. As a somewhat more complex case which still lies 
within the limits of immediate comparison we have (3) the 
equality of two differences between magnitudes, especially when 
these magnitudes belong to neighboring parts of the same sys- 
tem. It is clear that in each of these three kinds of psychical 
measurements the two fundamental functions in apperceptive 
comparison, namely the perception of agreements and the per- 
ception of differences, are both applied together. In the first 
case, one of two psychical magnitudes, A and B, is gradually 
varied until it agrees for immediate comparison with the other; 
thus, for example, B is varied until it agrees with A. In the 
second case A and B are taken equal at first and then B is 
changed until it appears either just noticeably greater or just 
noticeably smaller than A. Finally, the third case is used to the 
greatest advantage when a whole line of psychical magnitudes, 
as for example of sensation intensities, extending from A as a 
lower limit to C as an upper limit, is so divided by a middle 
 
-P-A-G-E-739
  OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 717 
quantity B, which has been found by gradual variations, and 
is so placed that the partial distance 4B is apperceived as equal 
to BC. 
to. The most direct and most easily utilizable results de- 
rived from these methods of comparison are given by the second 
method, or the method of minimal differences as it is called. The 
difference between the physical stimuli which corresponds to 
the just noticeable difference between psychical magnitudes is 
called the difference threshold of the stimulus. The intensity 
at which the resulting psychical process, as for example a 
sensation, can be just apperceived, is called the stimulus 
threshold. Observation shows that the difference threshold of 
the stimulus increases in proportion to the distance from the 
stimulus threshold, in such a way that the relation between the 
difference threshold and the absolute quantity of the stimulus 
or the relative difference threshold, remains constant. If, for 
example, a certain sound the intensity of which is 1 must be 
increased 1-3 in order that the sensation may be just noticeably 
greater, a sound whose intensity is 2 must be increased 2-3, one 
with an intensity 3 must be increased 3-3, etc., to reach the dif- 
ference threshold. This law is called Weber’s law, after its 
discoverer E. H. WEBER. It is easily understood when we look 
upon it as a law of apperceptive comparison. From this point of 
view it must obviously be interpreted to mean that psychical 
magnitudes can be compared only according to their relative values. 
This view that WEBER’s law is an expression of the general 
law of the relativity of psychical magnitudes, assumes that the 
psychical magnitudes which are compared, themselves in- 
crease within the limits of the validity of the law in direct pro- 
portion to their stimuli. It has not yet been possible to demon- 
strate the truth of this assumption on its physiological side, on 
account of the difficulties of measuring exactly the stimulation 
of nerves and sense-organs. Still, we have evidence in favor of 
it in the psychological fact that in certain special cases, where 
the conditions of observation lead very naturally to a compari- 
son of absolute differences in magnitude, the absolute difference 
threshold, instead of the relative threshold, is found to be con-
-P-A-G-E-740
    718 WILHELM WUNDT 
stant. We have such a case, for example, in the comparison, 
within wide limits, of minimal differences in pitch. Then, too, 
where large differences in sensations are compared according 
to the third method described above (p. 716), it is found in 
general that equal absolute stimulus differences, not relative 
differences, are perceived as equal. This shows that appercep- 
tive comparison follows two different principles under different 
conditions, a principle of relative comparison (WEBER’S law) 
which is the more general, and a principle of absolute compari- 
son which takes the place of the first principle under special 
conditions which favor such a form of apperception. 
11. As special cases among the apperceptive comparisons 
generally falling under WEBER’s law, are the comparisons of 
magnitudes which are related to each other as relatively greatest 
sensation differences or, when dealing with feelings, as opposites. 
The phenomena which appear in such cases are usually grouped 
together under the class name contrasts. In the department 
where contrasts have been most thoroughly investigated, that 
is, in the case of light sensations, there is generally an utter lack 
of discrimination between two phenomena which are obviously 
entirely different in origin, though their results are to a certain 
extent related. We may distinguish these as light induction or 
physiological contrast, and true contrast or psychological con- 
trast. Physiological contrasts are closely connected with the 
phenomena of after-images, perhaps they are the same. Psycho- 
logical contrasts are essentially different; they are usually 
pushed into the background by the stronger physiological 
contrasts when the impressions are intense. Psychological con- 
trasts are distinguished from physiological by two important 
characteristics. First, psychical contrasts do not reach their 
greatest intensity when the brightness and saturation are 
greatest, but when the sensations are at the medium stages, 
where the eye is most sensitive to changes in brightness and 
saturation. Second, under favorable conditions psychical con- 
trasts can be removed by comparison with an independent 
object. Especially the latter characteristic shows these con- 
trasts to be unqualifiedly the products of comparisons. Thus
-P-A-G-E-741
  
OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 719 
for example, when a gray square is laid on a black ground and 
close by a similar gray square is laid on a white ground and 
all are covered with transparent paper, the two squares appear 
entirely different; the one on the black ground looks bright, 
nearly white, while the square on the white ground looks dark, 
nearly black. Now after-images and irradiations are very weak 
when the colors are thus seen through translucent media, so 
that it may be assumed that the phenomenon described is a 
psychical contrast. If, again, a strip of black cardboard which 
is also covered with the transparent paper, and is therefore 
exactly the same gray as the two squares, is held in such a 
position that it connects the two squares, the contrast will be 
entirely removed, or, at least, very much diminished. If in this 
experiment a colored ground is used instead of the achromatic 
ground, the gray squares will appear very clearly in the corre- 
sponding complementary color. But here, too, the contrast 
can be made to disappear through comparison with an inde- 
pendent gray object. 
12. Similar contrasts appear also in other spheres of sensa- 
tion when the conditions for their demonstration are favor- 
able. They are also especially marked in the case of feelings 
and may arise under proper conditions in the case of spatial 
and temporal ideas. Sensations of pitch are relatively most free 
from contrast, for most persons have a well developed ability 
to recognize absolute pitch and this probably tends to overcome 
contrast. In the case of feelings the effect of contrast is intimately 
connected with the natural opposition between effective quali- 
ties. Thus, pleasurable feelings are intensified by unpleasant 
feelings immediately preceding, and the same holds for many 
feelings of relaxation following feelings of strain, as for example 
in the case of a feeling of fulfilment after expectation. The effect 
of contrast in the case of spatial and temporal ideas is most 
obvious when the same spatial or temporal interval is compared 
alternately with a longer and with a shorter interval. In such 
cases the interval appears different; in comparison with the 
shorter it appears greater, in comparison with the longer, 
smaller. Here, too, the contrast between spatial ideas can be  
-P-A-G-E-742
  720 WILHELM WUNDT 
removed by bringing an object between the contrasted figures 
in such a way that it is possible easily to relate them. 
13. We may regard the phenomena which result from the 
apperception of an impression the real character of which dif- 
fers from the character expected, as special modifications of 
psychical contrast. For example, if we are prepared to lift a 
heavy weight, and find in the actual lifting of the weight that 
it proves to be light, or if we lift a heavy weight when we ex- 
pected a light one, the result is in the first case an underestima- 
tion, in the second an overestimation of the real weight. If a 
series of exactly equal weights of different sizes are made to 
vary in size so that they look like a set of weights varying 
regularly from a lighter to a heavier they will appear to be dif- 
ferent in weight when raised. The smallest will seem to be the 
heaviest and the largest to be the lightest. The familiar as- 
sociation that the greater volume is connected with the greater 
mass determines in this case the tendency of expectation. The 
false estimation of the weight then results from the contrast 
between the real and the expected sensation. 
B. Complex Apperceptive Functions. (Synthesis and Analysis). 
14. When the simple processes of relating and comparing 
are repeated and combined several times, the complex psychical 
functions of synthesis and analysis arise. Synthesis is primarily 
the product of the relating activity of apperception, analysis 
of the comparing activity. 
As a combining function apperceptive synthesis is based 
upon fusions and associations. It differs from fusions and as- 
sociations in the fact that some of the ideational and affective 
elements which are brought forward by the association are 
voluntarily emphasized and others are pushed into the back- 
ground. The motives for the choice between the elements can 
be explained only from the whole previous development of the 
individual consciousness. As a result of this voluntary activity 
the product of this synthesis is a complex in which all the com- 
ponents are derived from former sense perceptions and associa- 
tions, but in which the combination of these components may 
differ more or less from the original forms.
-P-A-G-E-743
    
OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 721 
The ideational elements of a compound thus resulting from 
apperceptive synthesis may be regarded as the substratum 
for the rest of its contents, and so we call such a compound in 
general an aggregate idea. When the combination of the elements 
is peculiar, that is, markedly different from the products of 
associations, the aggregate idea and each of its relatively in- 
dependent ideational components is called an idea of imagina- 
tion or image of imagination. Since the voluntary synthesis may 
vary more or Jess from the combinations presented in sense 
perception and association, it follows that practically no sharp 
line of demarcation can be drawn between images of imagina- 
tion and those of memory. But we have a more essential mark 
of the apperceptive process in the positive characteristic which 
appears in the fact that it depends on a voluntary synthesis, 
than we have in the negative fact that the combination does 
not correspond in character to any particular sense perception. 
This positive characteristic is also the source of a most striking 
difference between images of imagination and those of memory. 
The difference in question consists in the fact that the sensation 
elements of an apperceptive compound are much more like 
those of an immediate sense perception in clearness and dis- 
tinctness, and usually also in completeness and intensity. This 
is easily explained by the fact that the reciprocally inhibitory 
influences which the uncontrolled associations exercise on one 
another, and which prevent the formation of fixed memory 
images, are diminished or removed by the voluntary empha- 
sizing of certain particular ideational compounds. It is possible 
to mistake images of imagination for real experiences. In the 
case of memory images this is possible only when they become 
images of imagination, that is, when the memories are no longer 
allowed to arise passively, but are to some extent produced by 
the will. Generally, there are such voluntary modifications of 
memories through a mixing of real with imagined elements. 
All our memories are therefore made up of “fancy and truth.”’+ 
Memory images thus change under the influence of our feelings 
and volition to images of imagination, and we generally deceive 
ourselves with their resemblance to real experiences.

15. From the aggregate ideas which thus result from apper- 
ceptive synthesis there arise two forms of apperceptive analysis 
which work themselves out in opposite directions. The one is 
known in popular parlance as activity of the imagination, the 
second as activity of the wnderstanding. The two are by no 
means absolutely different, as might be surmised from these 
names, but are, rather, closely related and always connected 
with each other. Their fundamental determining motives are 
what distinguish them and condition all their secondary dif- 
ferences and also the reaction which they exercise on the syn- 
thetic function. 
In the case of the activity of “ imagination” the motive is 
the reproduction of real complexes of experience or of experi- 
ences analogous to reality. ‘This is the earlier form of apperceptive 
analysis and arises directly from association. It begins with a 
more or less comprehensive aggregate idea made up of a variety 
of ideational and affective elements and embracing the general 
content of a complex experience in which the single compo- 
nents are only indefinitely distinguished. The aggregate idea 
is then divided in a series of successive acts into a number of 
more definite, connected compounds, partly spatial, partly 
temporal in character. The primary voluntary synthesis is 
thus followed by analytic acts which may in turn give rise to 
the motives for a new synthesis and thus to a repetition of 
the whole process with a partially modified, or more limited 
aggregate idea. 
The activity of imagination shows two stages of development. 
The first is more passive and arises directly from the ordinary 
memory function. It appears continually in the train of thought 
especially in the form of an anticipation of the future, and plays 
an important part in psychical development as a preparation 
or antecedent of volitions. It may, however, in an analogous 
way, appear as a representation in thought of imaginary situa- 
tions or of successions of external phenomena. The second, or 
active, form of imagination is under the influence of a fixed 
idea of some end, and therefore presupposes a high degree of 
voluntary control over the images of imagination, and a strong
-P-A-G-E-745
    
’ 
OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 723 
interference, partly inhibitory, partly selective, with the mem- 
ory images that tend to push themselves into consciousness 
without voluntary action. Even the first synthesis of the ag- 
gregate idea is more systematic when produced by this active 
process. And an aggregate idea, when once formed in this way, 
is held more firmly and subjected to a more complete analysis 
than in passive imagination. Very often the components them- 
selves are subordinate aggregate ideas to which the same pro- 
cess of analysis is again applied. In this way the principle of 
organic division according to the end in view governs all the 
products and processes of active imagination. The produc- 
tions of art show this most clearly. Still, there are, in the ordi- 
nary play of imagination, the most various intermediate stages 
between passive imagination, or that which arises directly 
from memory, and active imagination, or that which is directed 
by fixed ends. 
16. In contrast with this imagination or imaginative re- 
production of real experiences, or of experiences which may 
be thought of as real, the function of the “anderstanding” is: 
the perception of agreements and differences and other derived’ 
logical relations between contents of experience. Understanding: 
also begins with aggregate ideas in which a number of experi-- 
ences which are real or may be ideated as real, are voluntarily 
set in relation to one another and combined into a unitary whole. 
The analysis which takes place in this case, however, is turned 
by its fundamental motive in a different direction. Such analy- 
sis consists not merely in a clearer grasp of the single compo- 
nents of the aggregate idea, but it consists also in the establish- 
ment of the manifold relations which exist between the various: 
components and which we may discover through comparison. 
In establishing such relations itis possible, as soon as analyses 
have been made several times, to introduce into any particular 
case the results gained through relating and comparing processes 
which were carried out on other occasions. 
As a consequence of this stricter application of the element- 
ary relating, and comparing functions, the activity of under- 
standing follows definite rules even in its external form, especi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-746
    724 WILHELM WUNDT 
ally when it is highly developed. The fact which showed itself 
in the case of imagination and even of memory, appears here in 
a developed form. The fact in question is that the apperceived 
relations between the various psychical contents are presented 
in imagination and memory, not merely simultaneously, but 
successively, so that we proceed from one relation to the next, 
and so on. In the case of understanding, this successive present- 
ation of relations develops into the discursive division of the 
aggregate idea. This is expressed in the law of the duality of the 
logical forms of thought, according to which, analysis resulting 
from relating comparison divides the content of the aggre- 
gate idea into two parts, subject and predicate, and may then 
separate each of these parts again once or several times. These 
secondary divisions give rise to grammatical forms which stand 
in a logical relation analogous to that of subject and predicate, 
such as noun and attributive, verb and object, verb and ad- 
verb. In this way the process of apperceptive analysis results 
in a judgment which finds expression in the sentence. 
For the psychological explanation of judgment it is of funda- 
mental importance that judgment be regarded, not as a syn- 
thetic, but as an analytic function. The original aggregate ideas 
which are divided by judgment into their reciprocally related 
components, are exactly like ideas of imagination. The pro- 
ducts of analysis which result from judgment are, on the other 
hand, not as in the case of imagination, images of more limited 
extent and greater clearness, but conceptual ideas, that is, ideas 
which stand, with regard to other partial ideas of the same 
whole, in some one of the relations which are discovered through 
the general relating and comparing functions. If we call the 
aggregate idea which is subjected to such a relating analysis 
a thought, then a judgment is a division of this thought into its 
components, and a concept is the product of such a division.’ 
17. Concepts found in this way are arranged in certain 
general classes according to the character of the analyses 
which produced them. These classes are the concepts of objects, 
concepts of attributes, and concepts of states. Judgment as a 
division of the aggregate idea, sets an object in relation to its
-P-A-G-E-747
  OUTLINES OF PSYCHOLOGY 725 
attributes or states, or it sets various objects in relation to one 
another. Since a single concept can never, strictly speaking, 
be thought of by itself, but is always connected in the whole 
idea with one or more other concepts, the conceptual ideas 
are strikingly different from the ideas of imagination because 
of the indefiniteness and variableness of the former. This 
indefiniteness is essentially increased by the fact that as 
a result of the like outcome of different kinds of judgment, 
concepts arise which may form components of many ideas 
which differ in their concrete characters. A concept of this 
kind can therefore be used in a great variety of different ap- 
plications. Such general concepts constitute, on account of 
the wide application of relating analysis to different contents 
of judgment, the great majority of all concepts; and they 
have a greater or smaller number of corresponding single 
ideational contents. A single idea is selected from this group 
of contents as a representative of the concept. This gives 
the conceptual idea of a greater definiteness. At the same 
time there is always connected with this idea the conscious- 
ness that it is merely a representative. This consciousness 
generally takes the form of a characteristic feeling, the conceptual 
feeling. This feeling may be traced to the fact that obscure 
ideas, which have the attributes which make them suitable 
to serve as representations of the concept, tend to force them- 
selves into consciousness in the form of memory images. As 
evidence of this we have the fact that the feeling is very in- 
tense when any concrete image of the concept is chosen as 
its representative, as for example when a particular individual 
stands for the concept man, while it disappears almost en- 
tirely as soon as the representative idea differs entirely in 
content from the objects included under the concept. Word 
ideas fulfill this latter condition and that is what gives them 
their importance as universal aids to thought. Word ideas 
are furnished to the individual consciousness in a finished 
state, so that we must leave to social psychology the ques- 
tion of the psychological development of the processes of 
thought which are active in their formation.

18. From all that has been said it appears that the activ- 
ities of imagination and understanding are not specifically 
different, but interrelated; that they are inseparable in their 
rise and manifestations, and are based at bottom on the same 
fundamental functions of apperceptive synthesis and analysis. 
What was true of the concept “ memory” # holds also of the con- 
cepts “understanding” and “imagination”; they are names, 
not of unitary forces or faculties, but of complex phenomena 
made up of the usual elementary psychical processes; they are 
not made up of elementary processes of a specific, distinct kind. 
Just as memory is a general concept for certain associative pro- 
cesses, so imagination and understanding are general concepts 
for particular forms of apperceptive activity. They have a 
certain practical value as ready means for the classification of 
a variety of differences in the capacity of various persons for 
intellectual activity. Each class thus found may in turn con- 
tain an endless variety of gradations and shades. Thus, neg- 
lecting the general differences in grade, we have as the chief 
forms of individual imagination the perceptive and combining 
forms; as the chief forms of understanding, the inductive and 
deductive forms, the first being mainly concerned with the single 
logical relations and their combinations, the second more 
with general concepts and their analysis. A person’s talent is 
his total capacity resulting from the special tendencies of both 
his imagination and understanding.

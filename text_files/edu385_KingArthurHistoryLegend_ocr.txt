PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION 
iB Wrseei little book is an attempt to trace, in as 
clear and summary a form as possible, the 
origin and growth of King Arthur’s historical and 
literary renown, and follows, largely, the lines of 
a chapter contributed by me to the first volume 
of Lhe Cambridge History of English Literature. 
Although I have had, necessarily, to refer to much 
literary matter which is purely mythological, I 
have not sought to give any account of the specula- 
tions of those who in our own time have endeavoured 
to reconstruct and interpret the myths and beliefs 
of pre-historic Celtic heathendom. Nor have I 
made more than the briefest allusion to the subsidiary 
legends which, mainly through the agency of French 
romantic scribes, came to be associated with Arthur’s 
name, and to be included in “‘ the matter of Britain ” 
as it emerged out of the age of high romance. The 
book deals, all but exclusively, with King Arthur 
himself, as he is known to chroniclers, romancers 
and poets. 
My obligations to particular writers will be found

recorded in the paginal notes. I must, however, 
express here my special indebtedness to the writings 
of Sir John Rhys and the late Mr Alfred Nutt. To 
Mr Nutt, in particular, whose tragic and untimely 
death last year was a grievous loss to Celtic scholar- 
ship, I owe much private help and suggestion. 
In one or two chapters of the book—the second 
and the third, more especially—I have reproduced, 
almost verbatim, a few short passages from articles 
of mine which have appeared in The Quarterly 
Review, and in the Transactions of the London 
Cymmrodorion Society.

KING ARTHUR IN HISTORY 
AND LEGEND 
INTRODUCTORY 
“Tr is notoriously known through the universal 
world,” writes Caxton in his preface to Malory’s 
Morte Darthur, “that there be nine worthy’ kings 
“and the best that ever were,” and that the “ first 
and chief of the three best Christian and worthy ” 
is King Arthur. Caxton, however, finds it a matter 
of reproach that so little had been done in his own 
country to perpetuate and honour the memory 
of one who “ ought most to be remembered amongst 
us Englishmen tofore all other Christian kings.” 
Thanks mainly to Caxton’s own enterprise, and to 
the poets who have drawn their inspiration from 
Malory’s book, there is no longer any cause to accuse 
Englishmen of indifference to Arthur’s name and 
fame. No literary matter is more familiar. to them 
than “ what resounds in fable or romance of Uther’s 
son.” And yet nothing is more “ notoriously 
known ” than that authentic historical records of the

‘ career of this “most renowned Christian king ” 
are distressingly scanty and indeterminate. An old 
Welsh bard, who sings of the graves of departed 
British warriors, and has no difficulty in locating 
most of them, tells us that ‘‘ unknown is the grave 
of Arthur.” 2 Would that this were indeed the sum 
of our ignorance! \ To-day, as of old, Arthur re- 
mains but a shadowy apparition ames abe 
of legend and stalking athwart the path of history 
to distract and mystify the sober chronicler. A 
Melchisedec of profane history, he has “ neither 
beginning of days nor end of life.” (Neither date nor 
place of birth can be assigned to him any more than 
a place of burial, while undiscovered yet is the seat 
of that court where knights, only less famous than 
himself, sought his benison and behest) It is only 
romanitic story-tellers, like the authors of the Welsh 
Mabinogion, who venture upon such positive state- 
ments as that ‘“‘ Arthur used to hold his court at 
Caerlleon upon Usk.’ Geoffrey of Monmouth is, 
1°The Songs of the Graves,’ in the twelfth century Black Book 
of Carmarthen. “ A grave there is for March (or Mark),”—so the 
lines run,—“‘ a grave for Gwythur, a grave for Gwgawn of the Ruddy 
Sword; a mystery is the grave of Arthur”: or, as Sir John Rhys 
translates, “‘ not wise the thought—a grave for Arthur.” 
2 Willianr of Malmesbury (Gesta Reg. Angl., Bk. IIL.), referring to the 
discovery in Wales of the grave of Gawain, Arthur’s nephew, speaks 
of the grave of Arthur himself as being unknown—hence, he says, 
ancient songs (antiquitas neniarum) prophesy his return.

indeed, even more precise and circumstantial than 
the professed retailers of legend, for he actually 
gives the reasons why Arthur settled his court at 
Caerlleon, or the City of Legions—a “ passing 
pleasant place.” + That, of course, is only Geoffrey’s 
way, and illustrates the genius for invention which 
makes: his so-called History a work unique of its 
kind. The “ matter of Britain’ is, much more than 
the “ matter of France,” or even the heterogene- 
ous “ matter of Rome the great,” the despair of 
the historian.? But it is, for that very reason, the 
paradise of the makers and students of romance ; 
and, as a result, the mass of Arthurian literature of 
all kinds which exists to-day,—prose and verse 
romances, critical studies of “ origins,” scholarly 
quests along perilous paths of mythology and folk- 
lore,—is ponderous enough to appal the most 
omnivorous reader. The Arthurian legend has 
indeed been of late, both in Europe and in America, 
the subject of so much mythological, ethnological 
  
Erbin.’ Cf. also the first sentences of ‘The Lady of the Fountain,’ 
as given in Lady ©. Guest’s Mabinogion.

2The three great romantic “‘ matters” are thus categorised in a 
well-known passage in the Chanson de Saisnes by the twelfth century 
writer, Jean Bodel,—

and philological speculation as to tempt the unsoph- 
isticated lover of mere literature to say, when he 
contemplates the mounting pile of printed critical 
matter, that Arthur’s sepulchre, wherever his mortal 
remains may lie, is at last well on the way to be 
built in our libraries. 
There is nothing in literary history quite like the 
fascination which Arthurian romance has had for 
so many diverse types of mind. Poets, musicians, 
painters, religious mystics, folk-lorists, philologists— 
all have yielded to it. For some people the study of 
Arthurian nomenclature is as engrossing a pursuit 
as the interpretation of ‘The Idylls of the King’ is 
for others, while there are those who derive as much 
pleasure from investigating the symbolic meanings 
of the story of the Grail as lovers of music do from 
listening to the mighty harmonies of Parzival or 
Tristan und Isolde. All this only makes us wonder 
the more why so obscure and elusive a figure as 
the historical British Arthur should have become 
the centre of a romantic cycle which presents so 
many varied and persistent features of interest. 
Even in® Caxton’s time, as in our own, there were 
sceptics “ who held ohio that there was no such 
Arthur, and that all books as been made of him be 
but feigned and fables.” This is not surprising, 
when it is remembered that even when Geoffrey of 
Monmouth, some three centuries before, gave to the” |
-P-A-G-E-15
        INTRODUCTORY 5 
. world his astonishing record of Arthur’s achieve- 
ments, a few obstinate critics had their doubts about 
the whole matter, and one of them—the chronicler, 
William of Newburgh—roundly denounced Geofirey 
for having, by his “‘ saucy and shameless lies,” made 
“the little finger of his Arthur bigger than the back 
of Alexander the Great.”1 Caxton’s way with the 
sceptics is ingenuous and short, but it is curious to 
note how his preface to the Morte Darthur succeeds, 
in its own quaint and crude fashion, in suggesting 
what are still the main problems of constructive 
Arthurian criticism. It_will not do, he says in 
effect, to dismiss summarily all Arthurian tradi-~ } 
tions _as_so many old wives’ tales..They are too. 
‘widespread_and_ persistent_not to have some_basis— 
of solid fact , underlying them ie 
cannot all be “credulous fools. Caxton, in par- 
ticular, cites the case of the “noble gentlemen” 
who “required him to imprint the history of the 
noble king and conqueror, king Arthur,”—-one of 
whom “in special said, that in him that should 
say or think that there was never such‘ a king 
called Arthur might well be aretted great folly 
and blindness.” This gentleman—of whom one 
would gladly know more—was evidently both an

-P-A-G-E-16
  6 KING ARTHUR 
antiquary and a student of letters, and could give 
weighty reasons for the faith that was inhim. First 
of all, Arthur’s grave, so far from being unknown, 
might be seen “‘ in the monastery of Glastingbury.” 
Again, reputable authors like Higden, Boccaccio, 
and ‘“ Galfridus in his British book,” tell of his 
death and recount his life ; “ and in divers places of 
England many remembrances be yet of him, and shall 
remain perpetually, and also of his knights.” His 
seal, for example, “in red wax closed in beryl,” 
could be seen in the Abbey of Westminster; Gawaine’s 
skull and Cradock’s mantle were enshrined in Dover 
Castle ; the Round Table was at Winchester, and 
“in other places Launcelot’s sword and many other 
things.” Caxton appears to speak in his own person 
when he goes on to re-inforce all this by mentioning 
the records of Arthur that remained in Wales, and 
“in Camelot, the great stones and the marvellous 
works of iron lying under the ground, and royal 
vaults, which divers now living have seen.”’ More- 
over, Arthur’s renown was well established in all 
places, Christian and heathen,” so much so that 
he was “‘ more spoken of beyond the sea,” and “ more 
books made of his noble acts,” than in England. 
“Then all these things alleged,’ he concludes, “I 
could not well deny but that there was such a noble 
king named Arthur, and reputed one of the nine 
worthy, and first and chief of the Christian men.”
-P-A-G-E-17
CT Ee a RE ne ee ee 
INTRODUCTORY 7 
Hence he decided in all good faith, “under the 
favour and correction of all noble lords and gentle- 
men, to enprise to imprint” the Book of King 
Arthur and of his Noble Knights of the Round 
Table. And, in view of Ascham’s famous denuncia- 
tion of the book as containing but “open man- 
slaughter and bold bawdrie,” and of Tennyson’s 
sensitiveness to the touch of    
        
        
    
   
    
   
   
        
    
         
       
   “the adulterous finger of a time 
That hover’d between war and wantonness,” 
it is well to remember that Caxton held that all that 
was in it was “written for our doctrine.” ‘ For 
herein may be seen noble chivalry, courtesy, 
humanity, friendliness, hardiness, love, friendship, 
cowardice, murder, hate, virtue and sin. Do after 
the good and leave the evil, and it shall bring you to 
good fame and renommee.” 
Caxton’s preface to the Morte Darihur has here 
been taken as a sort of preliminary text, not only 
because that famous work is, by general consent, the 
fullest and the most fascinating presentment in 
English of the great congeries of tales that make up 
the so-called Arthurian “ cycle,’ but also because 
Caxton’s own words, as already hinted, serve to raise, 
in a peculiarly suggestive way, most of the questions 
with which the critical student of the Arthurian 
legends and their origin has to deal to-day.
-P-A-G-E-18
  ee)» KING ARTHUR 
The Morte Darthur itself, it has become a common- 
place to say, remains unchallenged, «in spite of its 
inconsequences and inconsistencies, the supreme 
Arthurian ‘“ prose epic” in English. The work is 
not, of course, “epic” in any strict sense, but it 
was issued by Caxton to the readers of his day as 
pre-eminently an English Arthuriad. Arthur alone 
of “the Nine Worthies ” had not had justice done to 
him in his own country. The two other Christian 
“ worthies,” Charlemagne and Godfrey of Boulogne, 
had been adequately celebrated abroad, and Caxton 
himself had contributed to spread the latter’s fame in 
England. Why should the great English “ Christian 
king ” remain unhonoured in his own land? It was, 
therefore, with the patriotic object of blazoning the 
fame of the greatest of Hnglish heroes that Caxton 
undertook the publication of Malory’s book. «Now, 
the historical Arthur, so far as we know him, is not 
English at all, but a “ British” hero, who fought 
against the Saxons, and whose prowess is one of the 
jealously treasured memories of the Celtic peoples, 
and particularly of the Welsh. } By what process of 
transformation had this British warrior become, by 
Caxton’s time, the ideal “Christian king” of 
England ? And why, again, should he be singled out 
as pre-eminently one of the three Christian kings of 
the world, and his name linked with ‘ the noble 
history of the Saint Greal’?? Here we come at   
-P-A-G-E-19
INTRODUCTORY 9 
once upon one of the disturbing influences in what 
ought to be a straightforward record of the doings 
of a fighting chieftain of early Britain. The tuest of 
the Holy Grail had, originally, nothing to do with 
Arthur.1 But, by Caxton’s time, the mystic, or 
religious, element in Arthurian romance had become 
so prominent as to make it impossible to think of 
Arthur except in association with the “ high history ” 
of the Grail. A further complication meets us 
when we are told that Malory took his material for 
his narrative of the deeds of the paramount English, 
or British, hero “‘ out of certain bocks of French.” 
Why should Malory so constantly refer to “the 
French book” as his authority, and have so little 
to go upon that had been written in English, or in 
Welsh? Why is it that to-day, after four centuries 
of diligent search in both private and public libraries, 
the amount of extant British literature of an indubit- 
ably ancient date dealing with Arthur’s exploits is 
so scanty? For Caxton’s statement still remains 
substantially true that, down to the fifteenth 
century, “the books that had been made about 
Arthur over sea,” and in foreign tongues, far out- 
numbered those that had been made in Britain. 
How are we to account for the popularity which the 
Arthurian stories thus enjoyed on the European 
continent, and for the way in which they became,

during the Middle Ages, practically international 
literary property ? 
' These are the main questions which have to be 
answered to-day by those who attempt to trace the 
origin and growth of the Arthurian legends, and 
they are all suggested in Caxton’s preface. This 
little book does not pretend to furnish a final answer 
to any one of them. It simply essays to present 
in a summary and, it is hoped, a clear form the sub- 
stance of what is told about King Arthur in history 
and legend, together with a brief notice of the 
development of Arthurian literature mainly in 
England. No attempt will be made to trace the 
many ramifications of the subsidiary stories which 
have been grafted upon the original Arthurian stock. 
Characters like Perceval, or Lancelot, or Tristram, 
who figure so largely in the full-orbed Arthurian 
cycle, could each easily be made the subject of a 
separate volume far exceeding the dimensions of the 
present one. Here, attention will be concentrated, 
‘as far as possible, upon the figure and the fortunes 
of Arthur himself.

THE EARLIEST ARTHURIAN RECORDS 
dr, in Caxton’s words, “ such a king called Arthur ” 
ever lived in these islands, he must have flourished 
during the period between the first coming-of the 
Saxons and the middle of the sixth century) So 
much, at any rate, is clearly attested by the meagre 
historical records which profess to recount his deeds. 
CaN othing, however, can be found in these records to 
warrant the belief that he ever became “king ” 
of any part of Britain.) His achievements as a 
warrior alone are mentioned,) and all that we can 
gather besides from Welsh tradition only serves 
to emphasise the fact that his renown among the 
British people rested mainly upon his warlike 
prowess. His admission to the so-called “ Celtic 
pantheon,” and his gradual evolution in Celtic 
_ tradition as a great mythological figure, are matters

  12 KING ARTHUR [ou. se 
© Arthur, but this title, as we shall see, implies nothing 
more than that he was a war-leader, or a commander- 
in-chief of a group of more or less celebrated generals. 
His kingship, and his state as the head of a great 
court, are entirely the creations of later romance.? 
Little, if anything, of historical significance is to 
be deduced from the form of Arthur’s name. It 
appears in the Latin chronicles as Artwrus, and is 
probably of Roman origin, derived from the form 
Artorius.. This is much more likely than that, as 
Rhys suggests, it was ‘‘ a Celtic name belonging in the 
first instance to a god Arthur.” For the latter ex- 
planation, as readers of Rhys’s Arthurian Legend 
will know, carries us into the world of mythology, 
and is made the foundation of an ingenious hypo- 
thesis to account for Arthur’s Celtic fame. That 
hypothesis, so far as it bears upon the name, is thus 
summarised by its author. “The Latin Artérius 
and the god’s name, which we have treated as early 
Brythonic Artor, genitive Artéros, would equally 
yield in Welsh the familiar form Arthur. In either 
1§ee a poem entitled ‘Gereint, Son of Erbin,’ in The Black Be { 
of Carmarthen, and several passages in the aoe dlen alle 
in ‘ The Dream of Rhonabwy,’—which are referred to later on. 
2 It is worth noting, by the way, that the “Saeson,” or Saxons, — 
against whom he is presumed to have fought most of | 
not even mentioned in the Welsh Arthurian romances, 
2 The name Artoria occurs in Tacitus, Annals. xv. 7 
Juvenal, Sat., iii, 29. It was common enough in Rome.

case, the name would have to be regarded as an 
important factor in the identification or confusion 
of the man with the divinity: The latter, called 
Arthur by the Brythons, was called Airem by the 
Goidels, and he was probably the Artzan Mercury of 
the Allobroges of ancient Gaul. His réle was that 
of Culture Hero, and his name allows one to sup- 
pose that he was once associated, in some special 
manner, with agriculture over the entire Celtic world 
of antiquity. On the one hand we have the man 
Arthur, whose position we have tried to define, and 
on the other a greater Arthur, a more colossal figure, 
of which we have, so to speak, but a torso rescued 
from the wreck of the Celtic pantheon.”! The 
mythological Arthur, as he appears in Welsh litera- 
ture and tradition, will claim our attention in 
another chapter ; here, our inquiry will be confined 
mainly to the Latin records in which we find, 
or should expect to find, the earliest authentic 
information about “the man Arthur.” 
1Rhys, Arthurian Legend, p. 48. In Chap. I. of the same work 
Rhys puts and answers the main question suggested in these pages 
as follows: ‘“‘ How did Arthur become famous above other (Welsh, 
or British) heroes, and how came he to be the subject of so much story 
and romance? The answer, in short, which one has to give to this 
hard question must be to the effect, that besides a historic Arthur 
there was a Brythonic divinity named Arthur, after whom the man 
may have been called, or with whose name his, in case it was of a 
different origin, may have become identical in sound owing to an 
accident of speech” (A. L., p. 8).
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 KING ARTHUR [cox. 
The oldest historical document in which Arthur 
is mentioned by name is the famous Historia 
Brittonum ascribed to Nennius. Parts of this work 
may have been put together as early as the seventh 
century,! but the compilation, as we now have it, 
was due-to a Welshman named Nennius, or (in Welsh) 
Nynniaw, who lived about the year 800.2 The 
work may be roughly divided into two parts,—the 
first, of sixty-six sections or chapters, professing to 
give a cursory sketch of the history of Britain from 
the earliest times down to the eighth century; the 
second containing a list of the twenty-eight “ cities 
of Britain,” together with an account of certain 
“ marvels ” (mirabilia), or wonderful natural pheno- 
mena, of Britain, which, the compiler tells us, 
he “ wrote as other scribes had done before him.” 
The quasi-historical part of the work contains much 
the fullest notice of Arthur’s military exploits to be 
found in any chronicle before that of Geoffrey of 
1 The chief authorities on Nennius are Mommsen (see his edition of 
the Historia, and of Gildas, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Berlin, 1898), and 
Zimmer (Nennius Vindicatus, Berlin, 1893). See, also, Fletcher 
(The Arthurian Matter in the Chronicles, Boston, 1906) and M. R. 
James (Camb. Hist. of Eng. Lit., Vol. I. Ch. 5). Thurneysen 
(Zeitschr. f. Deutsche Philologie, 1897) fixes 827 as the date of the 
completion of the History. 
2 This date must be accepted if we are to believe Nennius’s state- 
ment that he was a disciple of Elbodugus, or Elfodd, bishop of 
Gwynedd.

mouth, while from sundry allusions to pur 
in the section on the ‘marvels of Britain’ we 
gather that legend was already busy with his name. 
Th celebrated passage in which Arthur is mentioned 
in the Historia proper ! runs as follows :— 
“© At that time, the Saxons increased and grew 
stiong in britain. After the death of Hengist, 
Octha his son came from the northern part of the 
kingdom to the men of Cantia, and from him are 
descended its kings. [Ehen Arthur fought against 
them in those days, together with the kings of the 
Britons, but he himself was leader in the battles.* 
The first battle was at the mouth of the river Glein ; 
she second, third, fourth and_fifth on the river 
Dubglas, in the region Linnuis ; the sixth on the 
river Bassas; the seventh in the wood of Celidon, © 
that is, Cat Coet Celidon*; the eighth at the castle 
of Guinnion, when Arthur bore the image of the holy 
Virgin Mary on his shoulders, and when the pagans 
were put to flight and a great slaughter made of, 
them through the might of our Lord Jesus Chri 
and of Holy Mary his mother. The ninth batt 
was fought at the city of Legion, the tenth on 
shore of the river, which is called Tribruit, and 
eleventh on the mountain which is called Ag

16 KING ARTHUR 
Th elfth battle was on Mount Badon, wh! 
ther@tell nine hundred and sixty men before Arthir’s 
single onset; nor had any one but himself alone a 
share in their downfall, and in all the battles he 
was the victor. But the enemy, while they wee 
overthrown in all their battles, sought help fron 
Germany, and continually increased in numba, 
and they brought kings from Germany to rule over 
those who were in Britain up to the time of the 
reign of Ida, who was the first king in Beornicia.” 
~ One notes, in the very first words in which mention 
is here made of Arthur, that he is not called « 
“king,” but that he fought “together with the 
kings” of the Britons, not, seemingly, as their 
auxiliary, but as their commander-in-chief—sed 
ipse dux erat bellorum,) It has been suggested, 
with much plausibility, that the term dux bellorum 
in this passage implies that Arthur held, after the 
departure of the Romans, a military office similar 
o one of those established in the island during the 
pter years of the Roman administration. ~Since the 
e of Severus Britain had been divided, for 
ensive purposes, into two districts. At first,

North, and the defence of Upper Britain was

supervision over the other two, and the supreme 
charge of the defences of the entire country. Sir 
John Rhys discovers in Arthur the representa- 
tive in the sixth century of this third officer of the 
Roman military organisation. This supposition un- 
doubtedly helps to explain better than any other 
both Nennius’s descipsion of Arthur as dua bel- 
lorum, and the seemingly wide range of country 
covered by the twelve battles which he is -said~to 
have fought. 
It is, however, to be noted, as Rhys points out,1 
that while the title apparently given in early Welsh 
literature to those who succeeded to supreme power 
in Britain was gwledig, that name is never given to 
Arthur. The term guwledig, itself, means no more 
than “ruler” or “ prince,” and is indiscriminately 
used in that sense in medieval Welsh,? but there is 
  1 Arthurian Legend, p. 7. 
2 A number of chieftains are styled guwledig in the Mabinogion (see 
index to edition of Welsh Red Book, text by Rhys and Evans, p. 342). 
Among them is one Amlawdd, o Amlodd, who in Kulhwch and 
Olwen is the father of Goleuddydd she mother of Kulhwch, “a boy 
of gentle birth and cousin unto rthur.” In a poem ascribed to 
‘Taliesin the deity even is called gitedig—‘ gwledig nef a phob tud,” 
“ruler of heaven and of every land.”

is KING ARTHUR [ori 
good reason to believe that, as applied to certain 
warriors of the sixth century, the title was a 
Brythonic equivalent of the official military title, 
comes or dua. The most famous bearer of the title, 
Maxen Wledig, comes within the Roman period, 
and his renown is mainly due to romance!; three 
others who are so called, Cunedda, Ceredig and 
Emrys (the Ambrosius Aurelianus of Gildas), may 
very well have held one of' the military offices in 
question. ‘“‘Cunedda Wledig and Ceredig Wledig 
are connected with the ni.vu and appear to be 
guardians of the wall, while Emrys Wledig is the 
antagonist of the Saxons. Thus Cunedda and 
Ceredig may be regarded as Dukes of the Britains, 
while Emrys is a British Count of the Saxon shore.” 2 
Arthur, on the other hand, is in Welsh literature 
yr amherawdyr Arthur, “ the emperor Arthur,” ? and | 
so, as Rhys suggests, “it is not impossible that, 
when the Roman ¢mperator ceased to have anything 
more to say to this country, the title was given to the 
highest officer in the island, namely, the Comes 
  1 Viz., to the tale, included in Lady C. Guest’s Mabinogion, called 
‘The Dream of Maxen Wledig.’ The glorification of Maxen, or 
Maximus, in Welsh tradition suggests many points of analogy with 
the story of Arthur.

Arthur we have a remnant of our insular 
history.” ! 
1&n even more difficult problem than the deter- 
mination of Arthur’s rank is the identification of the 
twelve battlefields mentioned in Nennius’s record. 
The twelfth century chronicler, Henry of Hunting- 
don, tells us that, even in his own time, “all the 
places were unknown ”’; hence it is not surprising 
that those who have in our day sought to trace 
geographically the course of Arthur's campaigns 
have not brought us much nearer certainty. |) The 
most plausible theory is that which would locate 
most, if not all, the places named by Nennius in the “\ 
region of the Roman walls in the North,? a theory 
largely supported by Geoffrey of Monmouth’s 
elaboration of Nennius’s account, and by the fact 
that the narhes of several prominent characters 
connected with the early exploits of Arthur are 
localised in Lowland Scotland. On the other hand, 
it is contended that Mount Badon,* and Urbs 
Legionis, at least, must be in the South, and that

is in the East. The localisation of Arthur’s battle- | 
fields is of no great consequence as compared with 
the fact that the earliest record of them, how- 
ever vague and fragmentary, clearly points to a 
long and victorious campaign conducted under his 
generalship against the Saxons and other enemies 
of the Britons in the sixth century. Two, at least, 
of the victories recorded by Nennius appear to 
have strongly seized the imagination of later writers 
of Arthurian story. It mattered less to them where 
“the castle of Guinnion”’ actually was than that 
in the battle fought there Arthur “bore the image 
of the holy Virgin Mary on his shoulders,” and thus 
established the tradition which ultimately exalted + 
him into “the first and chief of the three best 
Christian kings.” Nennius’s brief statement is, of 
course, expanded and embroidered by Geoffrey ! 
and other romantic chroniclers in turn, until the 
tradition becomes so firmly rooted as to make a 
modern poet like Wordsworth single out Arthur 
as a champion of the early British Church, and

“ Amazement runs before the towering casque 
Of Arthur, bearing through the stormy field 
The Virgin sculptured on his Christian shield.” 1 
Hence, even Tennyson takes no very great liberty 
with Arthurian tradition when he converts “ Arthur’s 
knighthood ” into a Christian fellowship avowing 
that 
“ The King will follow Christ, and we the King, 
In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing.” ? 
The other battle, of those mentioned by Nennius, 
that looms large in subsequent Arthurian story is that 
of Mons Badonis, or Badon Hill. This battle is of 
exceptional interest because it is possible to assign to 
it an approximately certain date. The record in the 
Annales Cambri of the year 516 as its precise date 
is of less importance than the fact that Gildas, the 
celebrated sixth century scribe, expressly refers to the 
battle as having been fought in his natal year. In 
his De Hacidio et Conquestu Britannie, amid much 
vehement denunciation of the British people and 
their degenerate leaders, Gildas gives a short sketch 
of the history of Britain down to his own time. 
Coming to the Saxon invasions, he states that they 
were first successfully checked under the leadership 
of Ambrosius Aurelianus, the last of the Romans,

After this, he continues, the struggle went on with 
varying fortune “ until the year of the siege of Badon 
Hill, and of almost the last great slaughter inflicted 
upon the rascally crew. And this commences (a 
fact I know) as the forty-fourth year, with one month 
now elapsed; it is also the year of my birth.’’! 
So far as the date goes, this seems to mean that the 
year of the battle of Badon and of Gildas’s own 
birth was the forty-fourth from that in which he 
wrote. As the De Hxcidio must have been written 
before the death of Maelgwn Gwynedd—the Maglo- 
cunus against whom Gildas directs some of his 
choicest invective—in or about the year 547, the 
date of the fight at Badon Hill cannot well have 
been later than 504. At any rate, Gildas’s testimony 
is sufficient warrant that{some time during the first 
decade of the sixth century a battle was fought 
against the Saxons at a place called Badon Hill, 
in which the Britons were the velo

unimpeachable sixth century authority, makes 
no reference whatever to Arthur’s achievements in 
this, or any other, encounter with the Saxons. This 
silence, so far as it affects the historicity of Arthur, 
is less disturbing than it appears to be, when 
account is taken of the character and motive ‘of 
Gildas’s work as a whole. The De Excidio is not 
so much a history as a homily. Gildas belonged to 
a “ Romanist ”’ party, and what the more or less 
unorganised Britons sought to do for themselves, 
and their independence, was to him but a decline 
upon savagery and selfish native pride. It did not 
suit his purpose to celebrate the name and virtues 
of any British prince, and it is significant that, apart 
from Ambrosius,—by birth, apparently, no less than 
by his training and sympathies, a thorough-going 
** Roman,”—he does not mention by name a single 
British chieftain except as a target for his invective. 
In the mirabilia attached to Nennius’s History 
Arthur is a, mythical figure as remote and as” 
‘elusive as he is in early Welsh poetry and triadic 
lore. In them, as in the earliest Welsh poems, he 
is pre-eminently Arthur “the warrior,” but he is 
known besides as the owner of a famous hound, and 
as the father of a son whose name had been given 
to one of the natural features of the country. The 
first “ marvel,” in connection with which Arthur’s 
name occurs, is in the region of Buelt, or Builth, 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 KING ARTHUR [ou. 
Here, we are told, is a mound of stones, on the top of 
which is one stone bearing the mark of a dog’s foot. 
This mark was made by Cabal, “‘ the dog of Arthur 
the warrior ” (Arthuri militis), when he was hunting 
“ the boar Troit ” (porcum T'roit). The pile of stones 
was put together by Arthur, and is called Carn, 
or the Cairn of, Cabal. The marvel lay in the 
fact that, though men might come and carry away 
the top stone “ for the space of a day and a night,” 
the stone was invariably found in its proper place 
the next day. Another marvel, described in 
immediate succession, belongs to “ the region which 
is called Ercing,’ or Archenfield. There may be 
found a tomb close by a spring which is called the 
Source of the Amir,—juzta fontem qui cognominatur 
‘Iicat Amir, after the name of the, man who was 
buried there. (ee Amir,was the son of ‘ Arthur 
the warrior,” o himself killed, and buried him, 
ea “ marvellous ” property of this 
tomb was that, when men came to measure it, at 
various times, they never found it of the same size ; 
“and,” the writer ingenuously adds, “‘ I have made 
proof of this by myself” (e ego solus probavi). 
These two miracula, as he calls them, are all that 
Nennius, or his authority, has to tell us of the 
mythical, as distinguished from the historical, 
Arthur. 
These apparently casual records of Arthurian
-P-A-G-E-35
  1] EARLIEST ARTHURIAN RECORDS 25 
marvels are noteworthy, not only as indicating 
an early association of Arthurian traditions with 
the topography of Wales, but also as affording a 
connecting link between the earliest Latin documents 
in which Arthur’s name is found and one of the very 
oldest of the Welsh Arthurian tales. In the Welsh 
romance, or rather fairy-tale, of Kulhwch and Olwen, 
—the primitive literary form of which probably 
dates from the tenth century,1—the hunting of the 
Twrch Trwyth, or the Boar Trwyth (the porcus Troit 
of Nennius), forms one of the capital features. 
Now, in that hunt, as described in Kulhweh and 
Olwen, Arthurs dog, Cabal, or Cavall—which is the 
Welsh form of the name,—takes part; he is led to 
the chase by Arthur’s faithful henchman, Bedwyr, 
or Bedivere.2 Nor was it in bringing to bay “ the 
boar Troit ’ alone that Cavall took part. He was 
conspicuous in the capture and the slaughter of 
another monster, who is called an Arch- or Head- 
Boar, bearing the fearsome name of “ Yskithyrwyn 
Benbaedd.” ‘‘ And Arthur,’ we read,? “ went 
himself to the chase, leading his own dog Cavall. 
And Kaw, of North Britain, mounted Arthur’s 
mare Llamrei, and was first in the attack. Then 
1Such, at any rate, is Rhys’s opinion, See Preface to Dent’s

26 KING ARTHUR [ou. 
Kaw, of North Britain, wielded a mighty axe, and 
absolutely daring he came valiantly up to the boar, 
and clave his head in twain. And Kaw took away 
the tusk. Now the boar was not slain by the dogs 
that Yspaddaden had mentioned, but by Cavall, 
Arthur’s own dog.” + 
The battle of Mount Badon, as we have seen, ig 
recorded in the Annales Cambric, contained in a MS 
of the tenth century. Still more interesting is another 
record in that document under the year 587. In that 
year, we read, was fought “ the battle of Camlan, 
\in which Arthur and Medraut fell.” Although we 
hear nothing of Medraut’s treachery, gr of his being 
Arthur’ he: ere, so far as we know, is the first 
recorded allusion to what subsequently became one 
of the prime tragic features in Arthurian story. 
“Medrod, or Modred, is the villain of the romances, 
and Camlan is that “ dim, weird battle of the west,” 
where Arthur fought the “ traitor of his house,” and 
‘ Striking the last stroke with Excalibur 
Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell.” 2 
In Welsh prose romance we hear of Camlan both in 
Kulhweh and Olwen and in The Dream of Rhonabwy ; 
it is also mentioned in the Triads, and there are two 
references to the place in the oldest Welsh poetry.

of Carmarthen, we are told that “ the grave of the son 
of Osvran is in Camlan,”’ + and in a poem in The Red 
Book of Hergest, a nameless bard labouring under 
forebodings of coming tumult in his own day, pro- 
phesies that, “ Camlan will be heard again, scenes of 
groaning will again be seen, and dismal lamenta- 
tions.” Apart from these meagre references, Latin 
chronicles. and early Welsh literature are alike 
altogether silent about what, in later romance and~ 
poetry, stands as the most fateful battle in 
Arthur’s career. |~Geoffrey_of Monmouth. is the-first__ 
to give us elaborate details about_Arthur’s encounter _ with Modred, and his motley-army-—ofSaxons, Picts 
and Scots, on the banks of “the river Cambula,” 
or Camel. The river, according to Geoffrey, is in 
“the west country, and the battle is popularly sup- 
posed to have been fought near Camelford,? in 
Cornwall. 
‘When we come to examine the remaining chronicle 
literature of the pre-Norman period, we find no 
mention of Arthur’s name, and nothing but the 
briefest allusion to the campaigns in which he is 
supposed to have fought. Geoffrey of Monmouth,

History, expresses his surprise that Bede, in his 
“ elegant treatise,” has nothing to say about Arthur. 
Arthur was indeed widely known as a Christian 
champion, it is somewhat strange that an ecclesi- 
astical writer of the first half of the eighth century. 
should have passed over his deeds in silence.| More- 
over, Bede does mention Ambrosius as a successful 
leader against the Saxons, and knows of “ the siege 
of Baddesdown-hill.” Bede’s silence about Arthur 
is not to be lightly ignored, nor easily explained 
away, in any critical discussion of the historicity of 
Arthur. [Bede stands as the primary authority and 
the model of what Stubbs calls “ the most ancient, 
the most fertile, the longest lived and the most 
widely spread’ of all the “schools of English 
medizval history,” —the Northumbrian.) The best 
and most trustworthy of the chroniclers who followed 
him—such, for example, as William of Malmesbury 
and William of Newburgh (Geoffrey’s remorseless 
assailant)—pay their tributes to his industry, 
wisdom and integrity. His Ecclesiastical History 
is no mere desultory, or mechanical, record ; it bears 
the impress of a great, and honest, personality. In 
his record of the Saxon invasions, it is true, he follows 
Gildas, even to the extent of largely reproducing 
his very words. There is no conclusive evidence 
that he knew anything of the documents from which

  i] EARLIEST ARTHURIAN RECORDS — 29 
Nennius compiled his History, although one 
cannot, of course, deny the probability of his know- 
ledge of them. ‘The only plausible explanation of his 
silence about Arthur is that he drew his materials 
solely from Saxon tradition and from Latin records, 
and that he was either ignorant of, or distrusted, the 
Celtic, or British, traditions concerning Arthur which 
had their origin and home in the West and in the then 
“farthest North.’ If, on the other hand, stories of 
Arthur’s deeds were widely current in Lowland 
Scotland, it is surprising that a Northumbrian writer 
should apparently have known nothing of them. 
Again, there is no mention whatever of Arthur in 
the Saxon Chronicle” | The fact that the Chronicle 
contains no record of a fight, successful or otherwise, 
against the Britons for a long period after 527, or 
530, seems to confirm Nennius’s account of the 
decisive check to the Saxon advance given in the 
battles with which he associates Arthur’s name. 
On the other hand, the battle at Badon Hill must, 
as we have seen, have been fought long before the 
year 527. There is no question about the superior 
trustworthiness of the Chronicle to Nennius’s 
, fharrative as a historical authority.1 Here, again, 
_ the silence can only be explained on the assumption

that the compilers of the Saxon Chronicle did not 
care much about recording British victories, and 
cared less, or knew nothing at all, about the British 
chieftains who won them.\ As against this assump- 
tion, it should be noted” that the Chronicle does 
mention such British names as Vortigern and 
Natan-leod,—the latter a “ British king” slain in 
the year 508, just at the time when Arthur's prowess, 
according to tradition, was at its height. 
The meagreness of the pre-Norman Arthurian 
records which have been here reviewed stands in 
significant contrast to the amplitude and the range 
of the Arthurian matter which we find in the 
romantic productions of the twelfth and thirteenth 
centuries. The contrast is so startling as to suggest 
at once that the coming of the Normans to Britain 
had much to do with what may be called the aggrand- 
isation of Arthur. | It_was Geoffrey of Monmouth, 
as we shall see, writing ; under the direct auspices of 
a cultured Norman potentate, who did more than 
any other man to spread the renown|of Arthur _as a 
presumably historical character, and to giv him for 
centuries an assure in the chronicle literature 
‘of Britain, But Geoffrey could not have written 
“to order” such a book as his History had he 
not a large stock of popular traditions to draw upon. 
All the evidence seems to point to the period extend- 
ing from the tenth to the twelfth centuries as that.

of the popular growth of an Arthurian legend, on 
a large scale, among “the Celtic fringe.” | By the 
beginning of the twelfth cen 1tury Arthurian stories 
‘were re_circulating freely in Brittany, Cornwall_and 
Wales. It is only on this supposition that one can 
~ account, for example, for a tumult caused at Bodmin 
in the year 1113, by a certain monk from Laon who 
had the temerity to deny that Arthur still lived.t 
Later on in the same century, as. Alanus de Insulis 
records,? belief in Arthur’s “return” was so firmly 
held in the country districts of Brittany that a_ 
denial of it might have cost a man his life. More- | 
over, two chroniclers of repute who wrote before | 
Geoffrey bear clear testimony to the widespread | 
currency of Arthurian traditions in their day, and| 
to the curiosity aroused in serious historians concern- 
ing the deeds of the British king. 
None of the Anglo-Norman chroniclers ranks 
higher as a trustworthy historical authority than 
William of Malmesbury,—the first great successor 
of Bede, whom he calls his master and exemplar. 
In the first chapter of his History of the Kings of 
England—the first version of which was com- 
pleted in 1125—we find the following passage refer- 
ring to the Saxon invasions in the sixth century :—

l “When he (Vortimer) died, the British strength 
decayed, and all hope fled from them ; and they would 
soon have perished altogether, had not Ambrosius, 
the sole survivor of the Romans, who became 
monarch after Vortigern, quelled the presumptuous 
barbarians by the powerful aid of the warlike Arthur, 
[This is the Arthur of whom the idle tales of the 
‘Britons rave even unto this day ; a man worthy to be 
celebrated not in the foolish dreams of deceitful 
fables, but in truthful histories. For he long sus- 
tained the declining fortunes of his native land, 
and roused the uncrushed spirit of the people to 
war.) 
“~ Then follows a reference, based upon Nennius’s 
narrative, to the battle of Mount Badon. This 
passage, although somewhat confused in its account 
of the relative positions of Vortigern, Ambrosius and 
Arthur in the events of their time, is significant as 
indicating not only Arthur’s fame as a fabled British 
hero in William’s day, but the historian’s own regret 
at the absence of authentic information about a 
warrior so worthy of lasting commemoration. 
Another noteworthy reference to Arthur in William 
of Malmesbury’s history occurs in his account of the 
discovery in Pembrokeshire of the grave of Gawain, 
“ Arthur’s noble nephew.”’! Gawain, we are told, 
“was driven from his kingdom by the brother and

with his uncle, the praise of retarding for many years 
the calamity of his falling country. The ) grave of _ 
Arthur is nowhere to be seen ;henceahcient_songs— 
“fable that he is still to come.” Here we have 
positive evidence that, long before Geoffrey’s time, 
Arthur’s “return” was sung of by British bards 
whose compositions, with the solitary exception of 
the stanza in ‘The Songs of the Graves,’ already 
referred to, appear to have been irretrievably lost) 
Henry of Huntingdon is not so trustworthy a 
chronicler as William of Malmesbury, and _ his 
account of Arthur is, substantially, borrowed, with 
embellishments, from Nennius. Henry’s place in a 
review of Arthurian records is due not to his 
History, but to a letter, addressed to a friend 
named Warinus,! which singularly attests the interest 
then felt in the history of Arthur. That letter 
recounts how Henry, while on a journey to Rome 
in the year 1139, stopped at the abbey of Bec in 
Normandy and was there shown by the chronicler, 
Robert of Torigni, a “ great book,’ written by one 
“ Geoffrey Arthur,” containing a history of the early 
kings of Britain. The book in question was, almost 
certainly, an early draft of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s 
famous Historia Regum Britannic. But it is curious 
to find that Henry’s abstract of the book, as given 
1 Published in Rolls Series, Chronicles of Stephen, etc., iv. p. 65, 
ic  
-P-A-G-E-44
  34 KING ARTHUR [ox. 
in the letter to Warinus, differs in one important 
respect—and that alone concerns us at this stage 
—from the text of Geoffrey’s History as given 
in all the MSS of that work in its final form. 
Geofirey’s account of the “ passing ” of Arthur— 
an incident which offered to so imaginative a 
writer unrivalled opportunities of romantic decora- 
tion—is singularly devoid of ornament. Henry’s 
abstract of this part of the book which he found 
at Bee is, on the other hand, a highly coloured 
piece of writing. 
‘When he (Arthur) was about to cross over the 
Ips, an envoy said unto him, ‘ Modred, thy nephew, 
hath set thy crown upon his own head with the 
assistance of Cheldric, king of the English, and hath 
taken thy wife unto himself.’ Arthur, thereupon, 
seething over with wondrous wrath, returning into . 
England, conquered Modred in battle, and after 
pursuing him as far as unto Cornwall, with a few men 
iell upon him in the midst of many, and when he saw 
that he could not turn back said, ‘ Comrades, let- 
us sell our death dear. I, for my part, will smite off 
the head of my nephew and my betrayer, after which 
death will be a delight unto me.’ Thus spake he, 
and hewing a way for himself with his sword through 
the press, dragged Modred by the helmet into the 
midst of his own men and cut_through his mailed 
neck as through a straw, Natheless, as he went, and
-P-A-G-E-45

as he did the deed, so many wounds did he receive 
that he fell, albeit that his kinsmen the Britons 
deny that he is dead, and do even yet solemnly 
await his coming again. He was, indeed, the very 
first man of his time in warlike prowess, bounty 
and wit.” oo 
The vivid personal details of this narrative may 
be due to Henry’s own imagination, for it is well 
known that he, like Geoffrey, exercised that faculty 
largely in his treatment of history ; but, even so, 
the passage is curiously significant in its bearing 
upon the martial fame of Arthur, and upon the 
belief in his “return” cherished by “his kins- 
men the Britons,” in the first half of the twelfth 
century. 
The review given in this chapter of the earliest 
Arthurian records,—all of which are in Latin,— 
as distinguished from Celtic song or fable, points 
clearly to the gradual growth, around the personality 
of a real British warrior of the sixth century, of a 
legend which by the twelfth century had assumed 
a form that arrested, though it might baffle, the 
leading historians of the day. Now, it so happened 
that the the twelfth century —was_ _the_seed- time _of of

  CHAPTER II 
ARTHUR IN WELSH LEGEND AND LITERATURE 
To begin once more with Caxton, the preface to the 
Morte Darthur states that of the “ noble volumes 
made of Arthur and his noble knights ” there “ be 
many in Welsh.” Caxton was, here, either drawing 
upon his imagination or speaking with imperfect 
knowledge. It is true that Arthur figures largely 
in the Mabinogion, but when we come to examine 
closely even these tales, we find that he appears 
only in five out of the eleven! which are designated 
by that name in Lady Charlotte Guest’s well-known 
translation, while in the four tales— probably the 
oldest of all—to which alone the title of “ mabi- 
nogion ”’ is strictly applicable, he does not appear at 
all. Again, in the oldest Welsh poetry Arthur is the 
merest shadow, and even the medieval Welsh poets, 
who might have been expected to drink deep of the

one of these, the History of Taliesin, is from a late sixteenth century 
MS. and has no claim to rank with the rest as a genuine medieval 
production.

  wells of romance, mention him only in the most 
casual and perfunctory way. There is, however, 
|just enough in these old Welsh poems and prose 
stories to indicate that a legend of Arthur existed 
in Wales from a very carly period—certainly from. 
a period long before the appearance of Geoffrey 
of Monmouth’s History in the twelfth century. 
The traditions embodied in this literature are indeed 
vague and disconnected enough, for they are drawn 
from an age when the art of romantic “ exploitation ”” 
had not yet been learnt; but they bear the un- 
mistakable marks of a legendary growth indigenous 
to Wales itself. As such, they are of exceptional 
interest, and deserve a somewhat fuller notice than 
their actual range and extent would seem to warrant. 
‘The earliest Welsh literature in which we read 
of Arthur may be divided into three distinct and 
well-marked groups. First come the few poems in 
the oldest Welsh MSS which mention him. The 
allusions to Arthur in these poems represent, pro- 
bably, traditions derived from an earlier period than 
anything contained in the second group of writings 
to be noticed, the prose tales,—although, as will be 
seen, one or two of the poems and prose stories appear 
to refer to the same legends. Lastly, we have the 
Triads, which, according to Rhys, “give us the 
oldest account of Arthur.” 1 
1 Arthurian Legend, p.6. “ The Triads give us the oldest account
-P-A-G-E-49
t.] WELSH LEGEND AND LITERATURE 39 
    The compositions attributed to the oldest Welsh 
bards have come down to us in MSS which date 
from the twelfth to the end of the fourteenth century ; 
the best known of them are four in number, and 
these were edited long ago, with translations, by the 
late Dr W. F. Skene under the title of The Four 
Ancient Books of Wales.’ It is unnecessary here to 
touch upon controversial questions affecting the 
antiquity and the genuineness of the poems con- 
tained .in these MSS. Many of them are, plainly 
enough, not much older than the date of the compila- 
tion of the particular MS in which they are found. 
Others, however, as plainly contain what Matthew 
Arnold,? speaking of the prose Mabinogion, calls 
“ a detritus of something far older,” and it is impes- 
sible to avoid the conclusion that some of them refer 
to historical events and personages of the sixth and 
  
of Arthur, and this now and then in a form which the story-tellers 
and romance-writers found thoroughly untractable and best — 
ignored.” 
1 There are, of course, more than four “ ancient books ” in the Welsh 
language—for example, the MS. of what is known as the Venedotian 
code of the laws of Wales, and The White Book of Rhydderch, the 
contents of which have recently been made accessible to Welsh 
readers in Dr Gwenogyryn Evans’s fine edition. But Skene’s “ four 
books ” contain all the oldest Welsh poetry that is of any account. 
These four, named in chronological order, are known as The Black 
_ Book of Carmarthen (twelfth century), The Book of Aneirin, The Book 
of Taliesin, and The Red Book of Hergest.

seventh centuries, while others contain mytho- 
logical matter derived from a much remoter age. 
Here, the references to Arthur in these poems alone 
concern us. They are strangely few in number, 
and tantalisingly brief. In The Black Book of 
Carmarthen he is mentioned five times, in The 
Book of Aneirin only once. He is the central figure 
in a remarkable poem in The Book of Taliesin, and 
his name occurs in one other poem in that MS; 
in the poetry of The Red Book of Hergest nothing is 
heard of him, except in a poem called ‘ Gereint, son 
of Erbin,’ which is also found in The Black Book. 
Three of the references in The Black Book are of the 
briefest character. In one poem! the bard tells 
us that he “has been where Llacheu, the son of 
Arthur, was slain,’; and that is all; in another, 
evidently a late poem, we hear of “ Arthur’s host,” 
or “retinue” (teulu Arthur)? ; while in a stanza, 
already alluded to, in ‘‘ The Songs of the Graves,” 
we are told that his grave is unknown. In the 
solitary passage in which his name occurs in The 
Book of Aneirin he is a standard of comparison,—a 
certain warrior is described as being “an Arthur in 
the exhaustive conflict ’’*; the second of the two 
poems in which he is mentioned in The Book of

Taliesin refers, without comment or description, 
merely to “‘ Arthur’s steed.” + 
There remain to be noticed the three poems which, 
alone, contain anything more than such casual 
allusions as those we have just cited. Two of them 
are in The Black Book, and one would seem to 
bring us into touch, though but remotely, with the 
historical ‘‘ Arthur the warrior,’’—the dua bellorum 
of Nennius, who may have held “ the place of the 
imperator himself, when Britain ceased to be part 
of the dominions of Rome.”? This latter poem 
is called ‘ Gereint filius Erbin,’ *—a title identical 
with that of the prose romance which is the Welsh 
collateral of Chrétien de Troyes’s Hrec,—and, 
although Gereint is its hero, Arthur_is introduced 
as a war-leader of seemingly higher rank. “ At 
Llongborth,” the bard sings, 
“saw I of Arthur’s 
Brave men hewing with steel, 
(Men of the) emperor, director of toil. 
At Llongborth there fell of Gereint’s 
Brave men from the borders of Devon, 
And, ere they were slain, they slew.”

not know, but the whole poem appears to refer to 
an actual battle in which Gereint’s deeds had left 
a profound impression upon his bardic eulogist. 
The association, in this poem, of Arthur with Gereint 
brings us, for the first time, into the company of one - 
of the knights who, in later romance, belong to 
the goodly fellowship of the Round Table. )In the 
second Black Book poem we are introduced to two 
\ others who figure prominently in the romances,— - 
\ Kei, or “ Kay the seneschal,”’ and Bedwyr, or Bedi- 
\ vere, “ the latest-left of all” King Arthur’s knights. 
\'This poem is cast in the form of a dialogue between 
\Arthur and the keeper of a castle who is called 
Glewlwyd of the Mighty Grasp, and who appears 
in the Welsh prose stories as one of Arthur’s chief 
“porters.” Arthur seeks entrance to the castle, and 
Glewlwyd, apparently, will not open the gates with- 
out satisfying himself as to the number and the cre- 
dentials of his followers. Arthur, thereupon, proceeds 
to name them and to recount their achievements. 
They are a weird company, bearing strange names 
reaching back to the remotest regions of primitive 
Welsh myth. Among them are Mabon, the son of 
Modron, “ Uther Pendragon’s man”; Manawyddan, 
the son of Ll¥r, “‘ profound in counsel,” who “ brought 
home a pierced buckler from Tryvrwyd”’!; Mabon, 
1 Tryvrwyd, in the form Tribruit, is one of the twelve battles 
recorded by Nennius. See ante, Chap. I.
-P-A-G-E-53
Me ng oe ee 
1.] WELSH LEGEND AND LITERATURE 43 
son of Mellt, “ who stained the grass with gore ” ; 
- Llwch Llawynawe, Angwas the Winged, Arthur’s 
son Llacheu, and others! But the two doughtiest 
among the champions Arthur has around him 
are Bedwyr and Kei. Bedwyr, like Manawyddan, 
fought at Tryvrwyd, and “ by the hundred they fell ” 
before him there; “nine hundred to watch, six 
hundred to attack,” continues the bard, was the 
measure of Bedwyr’s prowess. Still mightier was 
“the worthy Kei.” ‘“ Vain were it to boast” 
against him in battle; “he slew as would an 
hundred,—unless it were God’s doing, Kei’s death 
would be unachieved.” Kei, we are further. told, 
“ slew nine witches ”’ ; he went “ to Mona to destroy 
lions,’ and he fought against a mysterious monster 
called “ Palug’s Cat.’ Capable as he was of all 
this, it is not surprising to hear that Kei’s drinking 
powers were equal to those of four men. Of the 
deeds of Arthur himself the poem tells us nothing. 
A still more remarkable poem,—the last that 
"remains to be noticed,—in which certain strange 
deeds of Arthur are commemorated, is found in 
The Book of Taliesin under the name of ‘ Preiddeu 
Annwvn,’ or ‘The Spoils of Hades.’ It refers to 
various expeditions made by Arthur and his men, 
  1 All the names here cited are found also in the prose story of 
Kulhwch and Olwen. The connection of the poem with Kulhweh is 
referred to later on.
-P-A-G-E-54

in his ship Pridwen to certain mysterious regions 
oversea. Definite names enough are given to the 
different places visited—Caer Sidi, Caer Rigor, Caer 
Vandwy, and so on,—but the places themselves 
remain quite unidentified. “Three freights of 
Pridwen,” sings the bard, “were they who went 
with Arthur ” on these expeditions ; “ seven alone 
were we who returned” therefrom. One of the 
exploits achieved in the course of these voyages was, 
apparently, the rape of a cauldron belonging to the 
King of Hades, and the whole poem, according to 
Rhys,! “ evidently deals with expeditions conducted 
by Arthur by sea to the realms of twilight and 
darkness.” 
The last two poems here referred to have several 
features in common with what is, probably, the 
oldest of the Arthurian prose tales in Welsh,—the 
story of Kulhwch and Olwen. That story also tells 
of the rape of a cauldron, belonging not, indeed, to 
the King of Hades, but to one Diwrnach, who lived 
across the sea in Ireland ; Arthur went in quest of it, © 
with a small retinue, in his ship Pridwen, and brought 
it home “full of Irish money.” The second of the 
two poems refers to “a speckled ox” (ych brych), 
and the acquisition of “a speckled ox” was one

poem is given, and its correspondences with Kulhwch and Olwen are

of the tasks imposed upon Kulhweh by Olwen’s 
father as part of the price to be paid for her hand. 
Again, nearly all the persons mentioned in 7'he Black 
Book dialogue between Arthur and Glewlwyd figure 
also in Kulhwch and Olwen. So, where the oldest 
Welsh Arthurian poetry comes into contact with the 
oldest Welsh prose, the Arthur that we find dimly 
outlined in both is a purely mythical hero. 
Kulhweh and Olwen, the most fantastic of all the 
Welsh prose tales dealing with Arthur, palpably 
embodies Arthurian traditions current in Wales at a 
very early date. “‘ Almost every page of this tale,” 
writes Matthew Arnold,' “ points to traditions and 
personages of the most remote antiquity, and is 
instinct with the very breath of the primitive world.” 
The tale relates of the wooing of Olwen, the daughter 
of one bearing the formidable name of Yspaddaden 
Pen Kawr, by Kulhwch, so called because “ he had 
been found in a swine’s burrow,’’ but “ nevertheless 
1The Study of Celtic Literature. Rhys’s opinion that the primitive 
form, and substance, of this tale date from the tenth century has been 
already referred to. Dr Gwenogvryn Evans, in the Preface to his 
edition of The White Book ‘ Mabinogion,’ without assigning to it so 
definite a date, holds that Kulhwch and Olwen “is the oldest in lan- 
guage, in matter, in simplicity of narrative, in primitive atmosphere,” 
of all the tales to which the general name ‘ mabinogion’ is given. Mr 
Alfred Nutt, while holding that portions of Kulhwch and Olwen are of 
“ prehistoric antiquity, far transcending in age any historic Arthur,” 
assigns the story in the form we have it to the twelfth century, on 
the strength, mainly, of its affinities to eleventh century Irish sagas, 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 KING ARTHUR [ox. 
a boy of gentle lineage, and cousin unto Arthur.” 
Kulhwch, after being told by his stepmother that 
he “should never have a wife until he obtained 
Olwen,” is informed by his father that “ that will 
be easy for him.” “ Arthur is thy cousin,” the 
father says ; “go, therefore, unto Arthur, to cut thy 
hair, and ask this of him as a boon.” The winning 
of Olwen,—hard enough though it appears in the 
story, which is mainly concerned with the long 
series of laborious tasks imposed upon Kulhwch 
as conditions of gaining her hand—is made “ easy ” 
through Arthur’s intervention. The hero starts by. 
duly presenting himself at “‘ the gate of Arthur’s 
palace,” and he there meets with the porter, 
Glewlwyd of the Mighty Grasp, who conveys to 
Arthur the news of his arrival. Arthur is introduced 
to us as the head of a court, keeping high state 
in his palace, or hall, which is called Ehangwen 
(Broad-White). When Kulhwch comes to ask his 
“boon ” of him, Arthur replies, “ Thou shalt receive 
the boon whatsoever thy tongue may name, as far 
as the wind dries, and the rain moistens, and the sun 
revolves, and the sea encircles, and the earth ex- 
tends,—save only my ship; and my mantle; and 
Caledvwlch,t my sword; and Rhongomyant, my 
lance; and Wynebgwrthucher, my shield; and 
Carnwennan, my dagger; and Gwenhwyvar, my

wife.” Kulhwch proceeds to ask for help in his 
quest not only from Arthur himself, but also from 
his knights and retainers, of whom a long and weird 
list is given. Kai and Bedwyr—an apparently 
inseparable pair—are first mentioned ; then follows 
“a series of strange and fantastic names, of most of 
which no other record remains in fable or folk-lore. 
Characters such as Taliesin, the chief of bards; 
Manawyddan, son of Llfr; Gereint, son of Erbin; 
Gwynn, the son of Nudd, and some others, are heard 
of elsewhere. But what are we to make of beings 
like Sugyn, the son of Sugnedydd, “ who could suck 
up the sea on which were three hundred ships, so 
as to leave nothing but a dry strand”; or, Gilla 
of the Deer-Legs,” the chief-leaper of Ireland,’ who 
“ would clear three hundred acres at one bound ” ; 
or, Gwevyl, the son of Gwestad, who, “on the day 
that he was sad, would let one of his lips drop below 
his waist, while he turned up the other like a cap 
upon his head” ; or, Medyr, the son of Methredydd, 
who could from Cornwall “unerringly shoot the 
wren through the two legs ” as far away as Ireland ; 
and other weird people endowed with similar super- 
human attributes ? Arthur himself figures in the 
tale as a fairy king, having all these strange beings 
at his service, and giving them orders in the most 
direct and matter-of-fact way. One of his most 
useful henchmen, for example, is “‘ Menw, the son of
-P-A-G-E-58
48 KING ARTHUR [cx. 
Teirgwaedd ” — corresponding to the conventional 
enchanter of the universal fairy world—who could 
“cast a charm and an illusion over them, so that 
none might see them while they could see every 
one.” Other characters in the motley crowd are said 
to “‘come from the confines of Hell’; others are 
“ attendants ” and “ huntsmen” of Arthur, while 
quite a large group figure as his “uncles” and 
“kindred on his father’s side.” 
Among the many trials to which Olwen’s father 
submits Kulhwch is that of “ getting Arthur and 
his companions to hunt the Twrch Trwyth.” 
“ He,” says Yspaddaden, “is a mighty man, and 
he will not come for thee, neither wilt thou be able 
to compel him.” \Kulhwch knew better, for he had 
already secured Arthur’s promise to help him to 
the utmost of his own and his companions’ resources. 
The hunting of the Boar (the porcus Toit) is one of 
the main features of the story ; and, except perhaps 
Meleager’s adventure to the quarry of the Caly- 
donian boar, there is no such swine-hunt in primitive 
literature. Many strange men and beasts and im- 
plements were required for the chase and despatch 
of Twrch Trwyth, and for the capture of “ the comb 
and scissors ” between his ears, which Yspaddaden 
wanted for the proper trimming of his unruly hair. 
Mabon, the son of Modron; Garselit, “the chief 
huntsman of Ireland’; Gwynn, the son of Nudd, 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  
  1.] WELSH LEGEND AND LITERATURE 49 
“whom God has placed over the brood of devils 
in Annwn”; Gilhennin, “the king of France ” ; 
Drudwyn, “ the whelp of Greid”; Du, “ the horse 
of Mor of Oerveddawg”’; “ the sword of Gwrnach 
the Giant” ;—all these, and many more such 
auxiliaries, had to be secured for the Boar’s 
capture. But Kulhwch is not dismayed; “ my 
lord and kinsman Arthur,” he tells Yspaddaden, 
“will obtain for me all these things, and I shall 
gain thy daughter, and thou shalt lose thy life.” 
The story of the hunt, with its many marvels, is 
chiefly remarkable for its minute topographical and 
personal detail,—the topography being indeed so 
precise as to make it all but possible to trace on a 
modern map the route taken by the hunters.1 The 
Boar is finally driven into Cornwall, and thence 
“ straight forward into the deep sea; and thence- 
forth it was never known whither he went.” 
“ Then,’ says the story-teller, ““ Arthur went to 
Gelli Wic, in Cornwall, to anoint himself, and to 
rest from his fatigues.’’ He had, however, to assist 
Kulhwch in one further enterprise—the obtaining of 
“the blood of the witch Orddu, of Pen Nant Govid 
(the Head of the Vale of Grief), on the confines of 
Hell.” He did so by slaying the hag with his own

hand, cleaving her in twain “ with Carnwennan, 
his dagger.” After that Kulhwch goes boldly to 
Yspaddaden and asks, “Is thy daughter mine 
now?” “She is thine,” said he, “ but therefore 
needest thou not thank me, but Arthur, who hath 
accomplished this for thee.” ; 
Kulhweh and Olwen, it will be seen from this 
brief account of it, is in all essentials a fairy-tale, 
embodying-a mass of fantastic, and even grotesque, 
folk-lore of an obviously prehistoric antiquity. It 
is to fairy-land, also, that we are transported 
in another of the Welsh tales, The Dream of 
Rhonabwy, composed probably during the latter 
half of the twelfth century. Both it and Kulhwch 
have much in common with the mythic tales of Ire- 
land. ‘“ We possess a considerable number of Irish 
sagas, which betray the same characteristics as the 
two Welsh tales : fondness for enumeration, triadic 
grouping, bravura descriptive passages, and, notably 
in Bricriu’s Feast, a distinct semi-parodistic tone.” 
The Dream,—of which the central feature, the story 
of Owen and his ravens, must be very old,—is 
remarkable for a series of minutely detailed and 
richly coloured word-pictures of 
“Tmpresses quaint, caparisons and steeds, 
Bases and tinsel trappings.” 1

tions in the tale is emphasised by its brief epilogue. “ And this tale

Among the marvellous objects described are Arthur's 
sword and mantle (called Gwenn), but the story- 
teller does not let his fancy play around them so 
freely as around most of the things he depicts. The 
sword was in the keeping of “ Kadwr, earl of Corn- 
wall,” whose duty it was to “arm the king on the 
days of battle.” “And the similitude of two 
. serpents was upon the sword in gold. _ And when it 
was drawn from its scabbard, it seemed as if two 
flames of fire burst forth from the jaws of serpents.” 
Gwenn, the mantle, was “ of diapered satin” with 
“an apple of ruddy gold at each corner thereof,” 
and “ it was one of its properties that upon whom- 
soever it was put, he became lost to sight though 
he himself could see every one.’ Arthur himself is, 
in this tale, constantly referred to as “ the Emperor,” 
and he is first met with “ sitting on a flat island ” 
below the Ford of the Cross on the Severn, “‘ with 
Bedwini the Bishop on one side of him, and Gwarth- 
egydd, the son of Kaw, on the other.” Among his 
retainers are his “cousin ’’ March (or Mark), the son 
of Meirchion, prince of “the men of Norway”; 
Edern, the son of Nudd, prince of “the men of

one knows the dream without a book, neither bard nor gifted seer ; 
because of the various colours that were upon the horses, and the 
many wondrous colours of the arms and of the panoply, and of the 
precious mantles and virtuous stones.”

Denmark”; Kai, ‘“ the fairest horseman in all 
Arthur’s Court’; and a host of others, many of 
whose names appear in the long catalogue given in 
Kulhwch and Olwen. Some of these names, such as 
Tristan, the son of Tallwch, and Peredur of the Long . 
Lance, bring us into touch with the later develop- 
ments of Arthurian romance. 
The other three Mabinogion, so called, in whith 
Arthur figures,—The Lady of the Fountain, Geraint, 
and Peredur,—will be noticed in a subsequent 
chapter, for these stories, whether they were directly 
based upon French originals or not, palpably belong 
to a period when the Arthurian legends had been, 
or were being, exploited for romantic purposes by 
French writers. The natural transition from such 
stories as Kulhwch and Olwen is to the Welsh Triads, 
the oldest group of which certainly contain traditions 
about Arthur as archaic as anything to be found in 
either the poems or the prose tales already reviewed. 
Here, only a few of the more significant allusions to 
Arthur contained in them need be quoted. Arthur 
is first mentioned in connection with Medraut’s, 
o: Modred’s, treachery, and he is described—much 
as in Geoffrey’s Chronicle—as conducting a vic- 
torious campaign against the Romans. The final 
battle with the Romans, of which Geoffrey gives so 
elaborate an account, is said to take place “ beyond 
Mount Mynneu,” and in it Arthur encounters, and
-P-A-G-E-63
  
.] WELSH LEGEND AND LITERATURE 53 
slays with his own hand, the Roman Emperor 
himself... Modred, who had been left in charge 
of Britain, hearing of the grievous slaughter of 
Arthur’s “ best men ”’ in this battle, revolts. Arthur 
returns, “and then took place the battle of Camlan 
between Arthur and Medraut, when Arthur slew 
* Medraut, and Arthur himself was mortally wounded ; 
and he was buried in a palace in the isle of Avallach.” 
Tn another Triad, Arthur is made responsible for one 
of “ the Three Wicked Uncoverings ” of the Isle of 
Britain, viz., the uncovering of “ the head of Bran 
the Blessed from the White Mount’ in London. 
The ‘mabinogi’ of Branwen, daughter of Libr, 
relates how the head of Bran had been buried, by 
his own command, in the White Mount, with 
its face towards France. While it remained undis- 
turbed, this island would be secure from invasion,— 
hence the “‘ wickedness ” of Arthur’s “ uncovering.” 
Another of the Triads speaks of Arthur as the 
husband of three wives, each called Guinivere,— 
“Gwenhwyfar, the daughter of Gwryd Gwent, 
Gwenhwyfar, the daughter of Gwythur, son of 
Greidawl, and Gwenhwyfar, the daughter of Ogrvan 
the Giant.” This strange statement, as Rhys points 
out, appears to have its parallel in the Irish story of 
1The Emperor (Lucius Hiberius, called in the Welsh narratives 
Llés) is said by Geoffrey (Hist. Reg. Brit., X. xi) to have been killed 
by “ an unknown hand.”

Echaid Airem, where we hear of three women all 
bearing the name of Etain, and “ the three Gwen- 
hwyfars are the Welsh equivalents of the three 
Etdins, and the article in the Triads must be held to 
be of great antiquity.” One of the last records 
in this group of Triads has affinities both with the 
four ‘ Mabinogion,’ properly so-called, and with one 
of the old Welsh poems cited in this chapter ; it 
also contains a curiously interesting reference to a 
character who, in medieval romance, appears as the 
hero of the most poetical of all the legends included 
in the Arthurian cycle. This Triad refers, mainly, to 
certain swine legends, and is entitled The Three 
Stout Swineherds of the Isle of Britain; but it 
mentions, besides swine, “ Palug’s cat,’”’—hence its 
connection with ‘ Preiddeu Annwvn,’ the poem from 
The Book of Taliesin already alluded to. The first 
of the “three swineherds ” is Pryderi, the son of 
Pwyll, ““ Head of Annwn,” and his story is told in 
full in the ‘ mabinogi’ of Pwyll, prince of Dyved:4 
It is strange, however, to find that the second of 
these pre-eminent swineherds is Drystan, or Tristan, 
son of Tallwch,—the knightly Tristram of later 
romance. ‘‘ The second” stout swineherd, so the 
record runs, ‘“‘ was Drystan, son of Tallwch, with the 
swine of March (Mark), son of Meirchion, while the 
swineherd went on a message to Essyllt (Iseult).

Arthur and March and Kai and Bedwyr came, all 
four to him, but obtained from Drystan not even 
as much as a single porker, whether by force, or 
fraud, or theft.” 
These four examples are quite sufficient to show 
that in the Triads, no less than in the oldest Welsh 
tales and poems dealing with Arthur, we come upon 
traditions handed down from a very remote age, 
which were all but incomprehensible to the medieval 
scribes who garnered them, and are therefore pre- 
served in a bewilderingly confused and disconnected 
form. They are the disjecta membra of a lost 
mythology, the legacy of prehistoric Celtic heathen- 
dom, which even the most learned and ingenious 
interpreters of primitive folk-lore and religion find 
it well-nigh impossible to restore into a coherent and 
intelligible whole.t ; 
They, however, who would rob us of a historical 
and a chivalric King Arthur must, perforce, leave 
us an Arthur whose attributes as a presumed pagan 
deity do not prevent the unsophisticated from 
recognising in him an ideal prince of fairy-land. 
It is as such a prince that he appears against the 
setting of “old,” but not altogether “ unhappy, 
far-off things, and battles long ago,” in which he

  56 KING ARTHUR [cH 
is presented in the early literature of Wales. It 
is as such a prince that one, at least, of the great 
English poets accepts him. To Spenser, Arthur, 
“taken from mother’s pap” and 
“ straight deliver’d to a Facry knight 
To be upbrought in gentle thewes and martiall might,” ! 
was just the potent deliverer required to bring 
the Red Cross Knight and the rest of that 
questing company out of their various difficulties, 
and to establish, through a series of timely in- 
terventions, his right to the hand of the Fairy 
Queen. 
In both Kulhweh and Olwen and The Dream of 
Rhonabwy, as also in the Triads, we find frequent 
mention of Cornwall as a district with which Arthur 
is intimately connected. It is to Cornwall that he 
retires to rest after the hunting of the boar; and it 
is to Cornwall that Kai, at the close of The Dream 
of Rhonabwy, bids all repair who “ would follow 
Arthur.” His home, and his court, there is at a 
place called Kelli, or Gelli, Wic. In later Arthurian 
literature little, if anything, is heard of Kelli Wic ; 
Caerleon-upon-Usk displaces it altogether as the 
scene of Arthur’s central court. But, with Geoffrey 
of Monmouth, two other Cornish localities are 
1 Spenser, Faerie Queene, Bk. I. Canto 9,
-P-A-G-E-67
  m.] WELSH LEGEND AND LITERATURE 57 
brought into dramatic connection with Arthur’s 
fortunes—viz., Tintagol, or Tintagel ; and Dimilioc, 
or Damelioc. These places are unheard of in the 
Welsh Arthurian tales, but, according to Geoffrey, 
it was at Dimilioc that Uther besieged, and his men 
slew, Gorlois; and it was this siege that enabled 
Uther, in the semblance of Gorlois, to gain access to 
Igerne in her retreat at the castle of Tintagel, and 
so to become the father of “the most renowned 
Arthur.” It is a pity that no Cornish records have 
survived to throw some further light upon these 
momentous events. It is, however, very unlikely 
that Geoffrey would have incorporated them in his 
narrative, had there not been, in Cornwall as in 
Wales, traditions long current which associated the 
name of Arthur with some of the ancient strongholds 
of the country. No less significant, as indicative 
of the existence of a separate Cornish legend of 
Arthur, is that Geoffrey, with others, tells us that 
the last and fatal battle with Medrod took place 
on the river Camel in Cornwall. It is not, perhaps, 
easy to reconcile these traditions with the theory 
that Arthur’s life and achievements were confined 
to North Britain. But that theory is no less difficult 
to reconcile with the abundance, and the ubiquity, 
of Arthurian place-names in all the districts, except 
Ireland, that make up “the Celtic fringe.” ‘“‘ Only 
the Devil is more often mentioned in local associa-
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 E KING ARTHUR [ox. 
tion than Arthur.”! The precise significance of 
such association is perhaps, in both cases, equally 
indeterminable. 
Investigators of Arthurian origins talk a good 
deal about Brittany. Unfortunately, there is no 
early Breton, any more than Cornish, literature 
to draw upon for any further information about 
a pre-historic, or a pre-romantic, Arthur. The 
lais of Marie of France are supposed to embody 
matter borrowed from Breton minstrels who sang 
before the flourishing of romance; but only one of 
her poems, ‘ Lanval ’—and that but remotely—has 
any connection with early Arthurian lore. It may 
be that “the Bretons” whom Wace mentions as 
“telling many a fable of the Table Round ” ? were 
Armorican Britons. We know for certain, at any 
rate, that a legend of Arthur, which included a belief 
in his “return,” had taken firm root in Brittany 
by the twelfth century. (There is, therefore, no 
difficulty about assuming ~that it was from the 
Bretons, rather than from the Welsh, that the 
Normans derived their first knowledge of Arthur, 
and so came to construct out of the stories connected 
with him the romantic cycle known as the matiére 
de Bretagne. The controversy waged about the

relative shares of Great and of Little Britain in 
supplying matter for the French romantic writers + 
is of no real consequence—everybody is agreed that 
that matter is to be ultimately traced to a Celtic, and 
a British, source. What is of more importance is the 
fact that before any “matter of Britain ” is heard 
of as a great romantic theme, a writer appeared who, 
by means of an orderly narrative embodied in an 
apparently sober chronicle, aroused an interest in 
Arthur’s life and deeds such as no mere romance 
could ever have succeeded in doing. He was 
Geofirey of Monmouth, and it is in his History 
that we get our first full-length portrait of Arthur 
as a great, and actual, “‘ king of Britain.”

  CHAPTER Til 
GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH AND THE CHRONICLERS 
Cuavcer, in his Hous of Fame, gives a station of 
conspicuous honour to a group of writers whose 
claim to distinction is that they are all “ besy for to 
bere up Troye.” Homer, inevitably, heads the list, 
standing 
“ Ful wonder hye on a pilere 
Of yren.” 
With him, however, are ranged persons of somewhat 
doubtful reputation ; to wit, Dares, the Phrygian, 
and “ Tytus,” or Dictys, the Cretan, “ Guido de 
Columpnis,” and — significantly — “ English Gau- 
fride.” ‘“ Gaufride,” or Geoffrey, owes his modern 
renown much more to his contributions to Arthurian 
literature than ‘to his modest additions to the 
tale of Troy. His detractors will have it that the 
Arthurian portions of his so-called History are as 
fabulous as his account of the descent of the British 
race from Brutus, the son of Aineas. He had, how- 
ever, the authority of Nennius, at least, for his use 
60
-P-A-G-E-71
as ia I a 
cH. 1] GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH 61 
of the Brutus legend. He had the brief records of 
Nennius, also, to work upon as a foundation for the 
elaborate narrative which he gives of the life-and 
deeds of King Arthur. But that narrative came 
upon the world as quite a new, and a startling thing. 
It is, perhaps, no exaggeration to term its appear- 
ance the chief literary event of the twelfth cen- 
tury; at any rate, it is certain that it aroused 
infinitely greater interest than the story of what 
Brutus and his immediate descendants achieved in 
Britain. Chaucer, however,—to judge, at least, by 
his T'ale of Sir Thopas,—regarded the newer romantic 
matters with good-humoured contempt; and the 
tale of Troy, in its various ramifications, challenged 
his imagination much more insistently than such a 
new-fangled theme as the story of Arthur. 
Notwithstanding the fact that Geoffrey’s use of ~ 
the Brutus legend is what constitutes the claim of 
his History to rank as the first, and the greatest, 
of a long series of ‘“‘ Bruts,’—English, French and 
Welsh,—his real title to literary fame rests upon his 
achievement, and his influence, as a contributor to 
Arthurian story. The Arthurian legend would, un- 
doubtedly, have attracted the attention of European 
poets and romancers, had Geoffrey’s History never 
been written. It was current, as we have seen, in 
Wales, Brittany and Cornwall long before his time. 
There is even evidence that Arthur, and tales con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
ee ee ne 
62 KING. ARTHUR [cx. 
cerning him, were known in the south of Europe 
before he took up his pen. But it is quite certain 
that Arthur would never have figured as he does 
in chronicle literature, and so have come to be 
regarded as an authentic historical character, were 
it not for Geoffrey’s narrative. And it may be 
doubted whether English poets, at any rate,—to 
judge from the homage which they pay Geoffrey,— 
would have dallied so much over Arthurian fable had 
they not at their call what Wordsworth describes as 
that 
“ British record long concealed 
Tn old Armorica, whose secret springs 
No Gothic conqueror ever drank.” 1 
Now, it so happens that the “ British record,” 
which Wordsworth, with a poet’s licence, so confi- 
dently tells us was “long concealed in old Armorica,” 
has never yet been discovered, and the mystery 
surrounding it is the chief critical problem which 
still baffles every student of the work of Geoffrey 
of Monmouth. This problem is deliberately set 
us by Geoffrey himself at the very beginning 
of his Chronicle, for he states that he is simply 
translating into the Latin tongue “a certain most 
ancient book in the British language,” which,—as 
he adds in his epilogue,—‘“ Walter, archdeacon of 
1 Artegal and Llidure.
-P-A-G-E-73
      GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH 63 
Oxford, brought hither from Brittany.” That he 
had some “ book,” or books, other than Nennius, 
to supply him with material, is not only highly 
probable, but almost certain; and, if we are to 
believe his own statement, that book must have 
been in “the British language.” But the fact 
remains that no document, either in Welsh or in 
Breton, has yet been found even remotely resembling 
that which Walter, the archdeacon, is said to have 
brought over from Brittany. It is possible, how- 
ever, that those who have been searching for it 
have attached too much importance to the “ British ” 
book, and that, even were it to be discovered, its 
contents would only serve to show how deftly 
Geoffrey manipulated his material, and how art- 
fully he succeeded in making his story of Arthur 
just what his Norman patrons, and the new romantic 
taste of the time, required. No intelligent reader 
of Geofirey’s History can, at any rate, escape the 
conclusion that the work, especially in its treatment 
of both the Brutus legend and the career of Arthur, 
was written with a motive. Besides, it is a work 
sut generis among the chronicle literature of its time, 
and bears clear evidence of deliberate romantic em- 
bellishment. In order to apprehend what Geoffrey’s 
motive may have been, and how far he is to be 
regarded as a conscious romancer, it is necessary, 
first of all, to know something of the writer himself 
  T1.] 
   
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 KING ARTHUR [on. 
and of the age and the people for whom he wrote ; 
a brief examination of the actual contents of the 
History, and more particularly of its Arthurian 
portions, may perhaps serve, subsequently, to clear 
up as much of the rest of the matter as is possible, in 
the absence of any knowledge of “ the British book.” 
The amount of authentic biographical detail 
ascertainable concerning Geoffrey is exceedingly 
scanty, and it is, therefore, not surprising that what 
is told about him in many reputable literary histories 
is distressingly inaccurate. Even the name of his 
famous book is, often, wrongly given; it is con- 
stantly cited as Historia Britonum—the title of 
Nennius’ compilation—instead of as Historia Regum 
Britannie. Walter, the archdeacon of Oxford, 
again, has been confused with Walter Map, who 
could hardly have been more than about twelve 
years old when Geoffrey died. Geoffrey himself is 
loosely designated “archdeacon of Monmouth,” 
whereas there was no archdeaconry of Monmouth 
in his time. He is said to have become, ultimately, 
bishop of Llandaff, and to have died in the year 1152, 
—the actual facts, however, being that he. was 
ordained priest and, almost simultaneously, ap- 
pointed bishop of St Asaph in 1152, and that he died 
at Llandaff in 1155. The exact dates of the begin- 
ning, and of the completion, of his History cannot 
be definitely fixed ; but we know enough about the 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
      11.) GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH 65 
work to say that it must have existed, in some form, - 
as early as 1139, at the latest, and that it was 
complete in the form in which we now have it by 
the year 1148. 
There is no conclusive evidence that Geoffrey 
was of Welsh birth, or that his home, other than a 
monastic domicile, was at Monmouth. The dedi- 
cation of his History, however, proves that he 
claimed the patronage of a Norman prince who was 
lord of a tract of Welsh country, the north-west 
boundary of which all but extended to the town of 
Monmouth. Early in the twelfth century Robert, 
earl of Gloucester, acquired the lordship of Gla- 
morgan by marriage with Mabel, the daughter and 
heiress of Robert Fitz-Hamon. Eminent as both 
statesman and warrior, Robert of Gloucester, like 
his father, Henry Beauclerc, was a student of letters 
and a generous friend of literary men. It is no empty 
compliment that Geoffrey pays Robert when he 
hails him as “one nurtured in the liberal arts by 
philosophy, and called unto the command of our 
armies by his own inborn prowess of knighthood,” 
and “whom in these our days Britain haileth 
with heart-felt affection as though she had been 
vouchsafed another Henry.” 1 Robert’s enlightened

ee ee i on EIT ee. eer ee a 
66 KING ARTHUR [cH. 
patronage of men of letters is sufficiently attested by 
the fact that William of Malmesbury, the most 
distinguished historian of his day, dedicated to him 
his History of the Kings of England. The abbey of 
Margam, whose chronicle is an important authority 
for the history of medieval Wales, was founded by 
him ; another abbey in which a valuable chronicle 
was compiled—that of Tewkesbury—had in him 
one of its chief benefactors. On his estates at 
Torigni in Normandy was born Robert of the Mount, 
afterwards abbot of Mont St Michel, eminent as a 
chronicler and known as a lover of the legends of 
his own Breton race. Robert of Gloucester’s close 
connection, as thus indicated, with both South Wales 
and Normandy at once suggests that he must have 
taken a considerable interest in Welsh and Breton 
legendary lore. It is even possible that it was at his 
instance that Walter, the archdeacon, and Geoffrey 
embarked upon the quest which ultimately led to the 
discovery, real or alleged, of the “‘ book in the British 
tongue,” and to its translation into Latin. It is 
obvious that Geoffrey, at any rate, was at pains to 
produce a work which would please both his im- 
mediate patron and all courtly readers who took 
pride in the growth of the Norman dominion. 
A plausible, and by no means improbable, explana- 
tion of Geoffrey’s motive in compiling the Historia 
is that he meant it to be a kind of “ national epos,”
-P-A-G-E-77
  
         GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH 
  111.] 67 
blazoning the united glories of the composite Anglo- 
Norman “ empire ” which reached the zenith of its 
power under Henry II.!| A book written with such 
a patriotic purpose would certainly commend itself 
to Robert of Gloucester and other Norman lords, 
and would appeal strongly to the imagination of 
less exalted readers. The History does, indeed, 
provide in Arthur a hero over whose achievements 
Norman and Saxon, Welshman and Breton, could 
all alike exult! Moreover, the common ancestry of 
the various constituent races of the Angevin empire 
is shown by an account of their descent from a 
branch of the great Trojan stock which founded 
imperial Rome. Brutus, the son of Aineas, stands 
to Britain in the same relation as Aineas himself 
stands to Rome, with the exception—and that was, 
of course, to the advantage of Britain—that Brutus 
could be claimed as the eponymous hero of this 
island.2 Thus—as poets like Wace and Layamon, 
and certain Welsh chroniclers, who use the name, 
were quick to see—here was a Brut, which, though 
written in prose, had as good a right to its epic title 
as the 4ineid. There is, even, some evidence that 
1 This hypothesis is ingeniously elaborated by the late Dr Sebastian 
Evans in the epilogue to his translation of Geoffrey (Temple Classics, 
1903). 
a explanation of the name “ Britain” is not, as has been 
pointed out (pp. 60, 61), original to Geoffrey. It is his elaboration 
of the Brutus legend that is significant,    
-P-A-G-E-78
68 KING ARTHUR [cx. 
Geoffrey may, at one time, have cherished the 
ambition of emulating Virgil himself by telling his 
story in verse; for, in the eleventh chapter of his 
first book, we come across certain elegiac lines which 
look uncommonly like fragments rescued from a 
projected poem. Apart, however, from its account 
of the coming of Brutus, there is little in Geoffrey’s 
Brut that furnishes any real analogy with the Zneid. 
It is not Brutus, but Arthur, who stands out as 
the hero of the Historia Regum Britannic. _ The 
Historia covers, altogether, a period—according, of 
course, to the computation of its author—of some 
fifteen hundred years; but more than a fifth part 
of it is devoted to the record of Arthur’s life,.—more 
than twice the space allotted to the history of Brutus. 
It is upon the story of Arthur that Geoffrey seems 
to concentrate all his powers, and, by magnifying the 
continental conquests of the British king, he is able 
ultimately to point with triumph to the fulfilment 
of a prophecy that “ for the third time should one of 
British race be born who should claim the empire of 
Rome.” 
The main objection to this theory of an Anglo- 
Norman “epos ” is the difficulty of reconciling it, 
not so much with the Trojan and the Arthurian parts 
of the Historia as with the scope and character of the 
work as a whole. The book is called a History of 
the Kings of Britain, and would appear, primé facie, 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
ee eee 
111.] GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH 69 
to have been composed by a writer of British birth 
for the sole purpose of glorifying the forgotten heroes 
of his own race.!' Through six books the narrative 
is strictly confined to the insular history of Britain 
and its rulers, many strange legends and- marvels 
being interwoven with what professes to be an 
authentic and ordered record of actual events. 
Even in the first half of the History, dull though 
it is for the most part, one alights upon many 
passages which betray the hand of the deliberate 
romancer. But it is only with the introduction, in 
the seventh book, of the prophecies of Merlin that 
Geofirey finds his real opportunity for romantic 
dilatation. With Merlin he is in the very heart of 
the land of enchantment, and the spell of romance 
inevitably falls upon him. ‘It is to Merlin’s magic 
arts that the birth is due of “the most renowned 
Arthur} who was not only famous in after years, but 
was well worthy of all the fame he did achieve by his 
surpassing prowess.”’. Then follows, in three books, 
1 William of Newburgh, the severest of all Geoffrey’s critics, 
writing about 1190, suggests that either this, or his own “love of 
lying,” was the motive of the work. “It is manifest that everything 
which this person wrote about Arthur and his successors, and his pre- 
decessors after Vortigern, was made up partly by himself and partly 
by others, whether from an inordinate love of lying or for the sake 
of pleasing the Britons.” William also held that Geoffrey’s account 
of events before the time of Julius Cesar was either invented by 
himself, or “‘ adopted after it had been invented by others.”
-P-A-G-E-80
  70 KING ARTHUR [cH. 
the narrative which first revealed to an astonished 
world that Britain once had a hero whose deeds 
challenged comparison with those of Alexander and 
Charlemagne. Here, at last, was historical confirma- 
tion of what had long been fabled in “ the idle 
tales ” and “ ancient songs ” of the Britons. Here, 
also, was just what a romantic age was thirsting for, 
and Arthur immediately became the central figure 
of the most popular and the most splendid of the 
romantic cycles. “ Alexander ”—and, we may add, 
Charlemagne—“ had been an amusement; Arthur 
became a passion.” + 
Geoffrey’s History, to be properly understood, 
must thus be read in the light of the general literary 
history of its time. Romance was in demand, and 
Geoffrey was shrewd enough to perceive the romantic 
value of the story of Arthur. It is impossible to read 
the Arthurian chapters in his Book without feeling 
that the writer is conscious of having got hold of 
“a good thing,” and that he is determined to make 
the most of it. So he gives his imagination free 
play, and palpably expands and embellishes his 
matter as he goes on. The Historia is much more 
of a romance than a sober chronicle, and it is quite 
conceivable that, in an age of literary experiment, 
its author enjoyed the use to which he was thus 
putting the time-honoured form of the chronicle.

It is not, of course, suggested that Geoffrey invented 
all, or even the greater part, of his matter ; nor need it 
be believed that the reference to “ the British book ”’ is 
altogether a ruse. (Like other chroniclers, he borrows 
largely from his predecessors; what he has taken 
from Nennius and Bede, for example, can be clearly 
traced in his text. But the History obviously 
contains much which Geoffrey either invented, or of 
which he was unwilling to disclose the secret source. 
It is otherwise unaccountable that he should warn 
orthodox and reputable chroniclers, like William of 
Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon, not to pry 
into the romantic enclosure which was his own 
particular preserve. In his epilogue, Geoffrey telis 
these two eminent historians that they may go on 
writing about “the kings of the Saxons,” if they 
choose, but he “ bids them be silent as to the kings 
of the Britons, since they have not that book in the 
British speech which Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, 
brought over from Brittany.” 
Of scarcely less significance than his epilogue, as 
throwing a light upon the general character of the 
work, is Geoffrey’s introductory chapter. Its apolo- 
getic tone is distinctly suspicious, and seems intended 
to disarm the critical by vouching an authority, 
both ancient and written in a strange tongue, for the 
marvellous narrative that was to follow and for the 
ornate style in which it was presented. It is worth  
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 KING ARTHUR [cx. 
quoting in full, for it really strikes the keynote to 
the entire work. 
“ Oftentimes in turning over in mine own mind the 
many themes that might be subject-matter of a book, 
my thoughts would fall upon the plan of writing a 
history of the Kings of Britain ; and in my musings 
thereupon meseemed it a marvel that, beyond such 
mention as Gildas and Bede have made of them in 
their luminous tractate, nought could I find as con 
cerning the kings that had dwelt in Britain before the 
Incarnation of Christ, nor nought even as concerning 
Arthur and the many others that did succeed him 
after the Incarnation, albeit that their deeds be 
worthy of praise everlasting, and be as pleasantly 
rehearsed from memory by word of mouth in the 
traditions of many peoples as though they had been 
written down. Now, whilst I was thus thinking 
upon such matters, Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, 
a man learned not only in the art of eloquence, but 
in the histories of foreign lands, offered me a certain 
most ancient book in the British language that did 
set forth the doings of them all in due succession and 
order from Brute, the first king of the Britons, 
onward to Cadwallader, the son of Cadwallo, all told 
in stories of eaceeding beauty. At his request, there- 
fore, albeit that never have I gathered gay flowers 
of speech in other men’s little gardens and am 
content with mine own rustic manner of speech and

mine own writing-reeds, have I been at pains to 
translate this volume into the Latin tongue. For, 
had I besprinkled my page with high-flown phrases, 
I should only have engendered a weariness in my 
readers by compelling them to spend more time over 
the meaning of the words than upon understanding 
the drift of my story.” ‘ 
Then follows the dedication to Robert of Glou- 
cester.1 Having thus given us his authority, and 
having taken further shelter under the wing of 
Walter, Geoffrey settles down to his task with all 
the gravity of a pious monkish chronicler. As other 
chroniclers had done before him, he, in his early 
books at least, makes brief references—as, appa- 
rently, so many “ guarantees of good faith ’”—to con- 
temporaneous events in sacred and profane history. 
When, for example, Gwendolen is said to have 
handed over the sceptre to her son Maddan, we learn 
that “Samuel the prophet reigned in Judea, and 
Homer was held to be a famous teller of histories 
and poet.” Carlisle, we are told, was founded at the 
time when “ Solomon began to build the temple of 
the Lord in Jerusalem.” “‘ The fortress of Mount 
  1 One MS of the History, preserved at Bern, contains a double 
dedication addressed to both Robert, and King Stephen. I have 
| given some account of this MS, and of its bearing upon the date and 
character of the History, in a paper on Geoffrey published in the 
Transactions of the Cymmrodorion Society (London, 1899).

  74 KING ARTHUR [cx. 
Paladur, which is now called Shaftesbury,” was 
built by Hudibras, when “‘ Haggai, Amos, Joel and 
Azarias did prophesy.” We get, in the account of 
the building of Shaftesbury, a characteristic example 
of Geoffrey’s way of getting level with the sceptical 
reader. “There, while the wall was a-building, an 
eagle spake, the sayings whereof, had I believed 
them to be true, I would not have shrunk from 
committing to memory along with the rest.” 
It is time, however, to give some account of 
Geoffrey’s narrative of the life of Arthur. He was, 
we are told, the son of Uther Pendragon! by 
Igerne, the lawful wife of Gorlois, duke of Cornwall. 
Uther is introduced to us as the brother of Aurelius 
Ambrosius, and becomes, on the death of Aurelius, 
king of Britain. After conquering the Saxons 
under Octa and Eosa, and strengthening his king- 
dom generally, he falls in love with Igerne and 
quarrels with her husband. He, thereupon, makes 
war upon Gorlois and besieges him in the castle : 
of Dimilioc. Igerne had, in the meantime, been 
sent for safer refuge to the neighbouring castle of 
Tintagel, on the sea-coast. Thither Uther, trans- 
1 Where, apart from “ the British book,” Geoffrey derived the name 
and history of Uther, still remains an unsolved problem. It is worth 
noting, however, that ‘‘ Uther Pendragon ” is mentioned in a poem in 
The Black Book of Carmarthen noticed in the previous chapter (see 
p. 42).

formed into the semblance of Gorlois by Merlin’s 
magic powers, proceeds in quest of her; he gains 
ready admission, and so becomes the father of 
Arthur. Immediately afterwards Gorlois, in a sally 
from Dimilioc, is killed, and in due time Uther 
marries Igerne. Another child born unto them was 
a daughter, Anna, who became the wife of “ Lot 
‘of Lodonesia,” and the mother of Gawain and 
Modred. After another campaign against Octa 
and Kosa, Uther is poisoned by the Saxons, and 
Arthur succeeds to the throne. He is crowned by 
Dubricius, “ archbishop of the City of Legions,” ! 
and is thus portrayed as he was at the time of his 
coronation. “ At that time Arthur was a youth 
of fifteen years, of a courage and generosity beyond 
compare, whereunto his inborn goodness did lend 
such grace as that he was beloved of well-nigh all 
the peoples of the land. After he had been invested 
with the ensigns of royalty, he abided by his ancient 
wont, and was so prodigal of his bounties as that 
he began to run short of wherewithal to distribute 
amongst the huge multitude of knights that made 
repair unto him. But he that hath within him a 
bountiful nature along with prowess, albeit that he 
be lacking for a time, natheless in no wise shall

archbishopric of the City of Legions is entirely a creation of Geoffrey’s

poverty be his bane for ever. Wherefore did 
Arthur, for that in him did valour keep company 
with largess, make resolve to harry the Saxons, 
to the end that with their treasure he might make 
rich the retainers that were of his own household.” 
Thus it comes about that Arthur begins his career 
of conquest at once. He attacks the Saxon chief- 
tains Colgrin, Cheldric and Baldulph, and with the 
help of his nephew Hoel, king of Armorica, subdues 
them after several battles—including the twelve 
recorded by Nennius—of which the last is fought 
in “the country about Bath.” Arthur himself, 
carrying “on his shoulder the shield Priwen,” 
and armed with Ron, his spear, and “ Caliburn, 
best of swords, that was forged within the Isle of 
Avalon,” performed prodigies of valour in that 
battle. ‘“‘ Whomsoever he touched, calling upon 
God, he slew at a single blow, nor did he once 
slacken in his onslaught until that he had slain 
four hundred and seventy men single-handed with 
his sword Caliburn.”” Having restored the whole 
island to its pristine British dignity, Arthur, we 
read, “ took unto him a wife born of a-noble Roman 
family, Guenevere, who, brought up and nurtured 
in the household of Duke Cador (of Cornwall), 
did surpass in beauty all the other dames of the 
island.” ! His marriage only stimulated Arthur

to attempt, and achieve, further conquests; and, 
in rapid succession, Ireland, Iceland, Gothland, 
and the Orkneys, are either subdued or forced to 
pay tribute to him. Then follow twelve years of 
peace, during which his court waxed in splendour, 
and his renown spread until “at last the fame of 
his bounty and his prowess was on every man’s 
tongue, even unto the uttermost ends of the earth, 
and a fear fell upon the kings of the realms oversea 
lest he might fall upon them in arms and they 
might lose the nations under their dominion.” 
Hence, one is not surprised to learn that Arthur’s 
“heart was uplifted for that he was a terror unto 
them all, and he set his desire upon subduing the 
whole of Europe unto himself.” Norway, Dacia and 
Gaul are invaded, and quickly reduced. to sub- 
mission. Lot, his sister’s husband, is given what 
was his of ancestral right, the crown of Norway, 
just at the time, as we are told incidentally, 
when ‘“‘ Gawain, the son of Lot, was a youth of 
this “Roman” descent of Guinevere would seem not to have been 
derived from a Welsh source. In the Triads we read of a Guinevere 
who is described as “ the daughter of Ogrvan the Giant ” (see ante, 
p. 53). She is, apparently, the one among “‘ the three Guineveres ” 
who is best known to Welsh tradition as the wife of Arthur. She is 
mentioned both in a poem by the famous Welsh poet of the fourteenth 
century, Dafydd ap Gwilym—referring to her adventure with Melwas 
—and in an old Welsh rhyme, which gives her a somewhat disreput- 
able character (see Rhys, Arthurian Legend, Chap. III.).

twelve years, and had been sent by his uncle to 
be brought up as a page in the service of Pope 
ulpicius.” Arthur’s visit to Gaul led to a single 
combat between him and a man of giant stature, 
Flollo, “Tribune of Rome”; the British king 
| was wounded in the fight, but at last “ raising 
Caliburn aloft’? he clove Flollo’s head “sheer in 
twain.” He concluded his business in Gaul by 
giving “ Neustria, which is now called Normandy, 
unto Bedevere, his butler, and the province of 
Anjou unto Kay, his seneschal.” 
Returning to Britain, Arthur holds high court 
at Caerleon-upon-Usk, and in the descriptions of 
the state that he kept there the colour and pomp 
of the age of chivalry, and of Norman court-life, 
run unchecked through Geoffrey’s narrative. Even 
before he had embarked upon his continental 
conquests, Arthur had begun to “ hold such courtly 
fashion in his household as begat rivalry amongst 
peoples at a distance, insomuch as the noblest in 
the land, fain to vie with him, would hold himself 
as nought, save in the cut of his clothes and 
the manner of his arms he followed the pattern 
of Arthur’s knights.” ‘But, so far, nothing has 
been heard of “the City of Legions,” except that 
Dubricius was “ archbishop” there. Now, how- 
ever, we are given a picture of the town “ situate 
on a passing pleasant position on the river Usk

  mit. GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH 79 
in Glamorgan,” which Arthur chose to be the 
seat of his court, and to be the scene of the 
“high solemnity ” of his second, and seemingly im- 
perial, coronation. The city “abounded in wealth” 
above all others; ships came to it from oversea ; 
its kingly palaces challenged comparison with 
those of Rome itself ; it was the third metropolitan 
see of Britain, and ‘“‘ had, moreover, a school of two 
hundred philosophers learned in astronomy and 
in the other arts, that did diligently observe the 
courses of the stars, and did by true inferences 
foretell the prodigies which at that time were about 
to befall unto King Arthur.” To the coronation 
were bidden princes and warriors from every part 
of the British islands and from realms oversea, 
until “ not a single prince of any price on this side 
Spain remained at home and came not upon the 
proclamation.” The description of the splendours 
of the ceremonial itself, and of the banquet that 
followed it, taxes Geoffrey’s rhetorical powers to 
the full. He has, indeed, to give up in despair any 
attempt to give a complete account of them; 
“were I to go about to describe them,” he writes, 
“T might draw out this history into an endless 
prolixity.’ “For at that time Britain was exalted 
unto so high a pitch of dignity as that it did surpass 
all gther kingdoms in plenty of riches, in luxury of 
adornment, and in the courteous wit of them that

dwelt therein. Whatsoever knight in the land was 
of renown for his prowess did wear his clothes and 
his arms all of one same colour. And the dames, 
no less witty, would apparel them in like manner 
in a single colour, nor would they deign have the 
love of none save he had thrice approved him in 
the wars. Wherefore at that time did dames wax 
chaste and knights the nobler for their love.” 
Here is a passage that must have delighted the 
hearts of Norman readers nurtured upon ideals of 
chivalry and courtly love, and seems as though 
designed to prepare the way for Arthur’s entry into 
the kingdom of chivalric romance. It is no great 
step from Arthur’s court, as here pictured, to the 
knightly fellowship of the Round Table, and all 
the other elaborate fictions of professional romantic. 
scribes. Of a part with all this romantic pre- 
sentment of the pomp and state surrounding the 
British king is Geoffrey’s constant exaltation of his 
“bounty,” and of his individual prowess as a 
warrior. Nor is the element of wonder lacking 
in the narrative given of Arthur’s exploits. He 
encounters at St Michael’s Mount, and slays by his 
own hand, a Spanish “ giant of monstrous size,” 
who had carried away and ‘Killed the niece of Hoel, 
duke of Armorica. This adventure leads him to 
tell Kay and Bedivere, who had accompanied him 
on the expedition, how he had once, in Wales,
-P-A-G-E-91
  uit.] GEOFFREY. OF MONMOUTH 81 
despatched another formidable monster, “ the 
iant Ritho,” of Mount Eryri, “‘ who had fashioned 
him a furred cloak of the beards of the kings he 
had slain.” Again, in the last battle with the 
Romans, he is a truly Homeric hero. ‘‘ He dashed 
forward upon the enemy, flung them down, smote 
them,—never a one did he meet, but he slew either 
him or his horse at a single buffet. They fled from 
him like sheep from a fierce lion madly famishing 
to devour aught that chance may throw in his way. 
Nought might armour avail them but that Caliburn 
would carve their souls from out them with their 
blood.” 
The campaign against the Romans, undertaken 
with an army of ‘Seighty-three thousand two 
hundred, besidesthose on foot, who were not easy 
to reckon,” seems to have followed close upon the 
festivities at Caerleon.1 The Romans were under 
the command of “Lucius Hiberius, procurator 
of the Commonwealth,” who, summoning to his 
aid “the kings of the East,’’ put into the field 
a host numbering “four hundred thousand one 
hundred and sixty.” It is unnecessary here to 
1It is interesting to note, incidentally, that after the “ solemnity ” 
at Caerleon, Dubricius is reported to have resigned his archbishopric, 
and “ David, the King’s uncle, was consecrated in his place, whose 
life was an ensample of all goodness unto them whom he had 
instructed in his doctrine.”

give any detailed account of the fighting, and of the 
final discomfiture of the Roman forces. It need 
only be said that the British triumph was obtained 
at heavy cost. Among the slain were the faithful 
Kay and Bedevere,—in death, as in life, not divided. 
Bedevere was buried at Bayeux, “his own city 
that was builded by Bedevere the first, his great- 
grandfather; Kai was laid to rest near Chinon, 
“a town he himself had builded.” The chief 
disaster to the Romans was the loss of their leader 
Lucius, whose body Arthur “bade bear unto the 
Senate with a message to say that none other 
tribute was due from Britain.” Arthur designed 
to follow up this message by a march upon Rome 
itself, and he had actually begun to climb the 
passes of the Alps when news reached him that 
“his nephew Modred, unto whom he had com- 
mitted the charge of Britain, had tyrannously and 
traitorously set the crown of the kingdom upon his 
own head, and had linked him in unhallowed union 
with Guenever the Queen in despite of her former 
marriage.” 
So ends Geoffrey’s tenth book. ‘“ Hereof” be- 
gins the eleventh, strangely enough,—but, of course, 
plainly referring to the affair of Guinevere,— 
“verily, most noble Earl, will Geoffrey of Mon- 
mouth say nought.” He will only treat of the 
battles which Arthur, after his return to Britain,
-P-A-G-E-93
  i.] GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH 83 
fought _ t with his nephew, according to the account 
given “in the British discourse aforementioned,” 
and what he “hath heard from Walter of Oxford, 
a man of passing deep lore in many histories.” + 
The ‘final, and fatal, battle did not take place all 
at once; it came at the end of a campaign of some 
length. Modred, retreating rapidly into Cornwall, 
is at last brought to bay on the river Camel, and is 
slain in a battle in which “ well-nigh all the captains 
that were in command on both sides rushed into 
the press with their companies and fell.” And 
“even the renowned King Arthur himself was 
wounded deadly, and was borne thence unto the 
island of’ Avalon“for the healing of his wounds, 
where he gave up the crown of Britain unto his 
kinsman Constantine, son of Cador, duke of Corn- 
wall, in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 
five hundred and forty-two.” 
“* Borne unto the island of Avalon for the healing 
of -his- wounds,”—here, surely, are words never 
before used in a professedly historical narrative 
of a kingly hero wounded unto death. This 
touch, alone, is sufficient to attest the kinship of 
Geofirey’s “history” of Arthur with the waifs 
and strays of Celtic romance. The circumstances

of Arthur’s birth, as told by Geoffrey, were 
marvellous enough; like other saga-heroes, such 
_as Finn and Cormac, he was born out of 
wedlock, through Merlin’s magical intervention. 
But what caught the imagination of poets’ and 
romancers even more was the fable of his “ return.” 
“Some men say yet,’ writes Malory, “that 
King Arthur is not dead, but had by the will 
of our Lord Jesu into another place. And men 
say that he shall come again, and he shall win 
the holy cross. I will not say it shall not be 
so, but rather I will say, here in this world he 
changed his life. But many men say that there 
is written upon his tomb this verse, Hic jacet 
Arthurus Rex quondam Rexque futurus.” Later in 
the twelfth century an attempt was made, at the 
instance—so it.is alleged—of Henry II to destroy 
the persistent belief in this “Celtic messiahship ” 
by an announcement that the body of Arthur 
had been exhumed at Glastonbury by the.monks 
of St Dunstan’s abbey. It was, however, of no 
avail. A poet of the next generation, Layamon, 
tells us that “the Britons believe yet that Arthur 
is alive, and dwelleth in Avalon with the fairest 
of all elves, and ever yet the Britons look for 
Arthur’s coming.” 
1The best known account of the affair is given by Giraldus 
Cambrensis (De Principis Instructione, viii. 126-9). ;

The popularity of Geoffrey’s History was imme- 
diate and immense; it is indeed difficult to find 
a parallel to it before the age of printed books. 
So much is largely attested by the number of 
extant MS copies of the work! But the most 
striking evidence of the impression it made is to 
be found in the number of translations, adaptations 
and continuations of the Historia compiled from 
the moment of its first appearance down to com- 
paratively recent times. Not long, if at all, after its 
author’s death, Geoffrey Gaimar translated it into 
Anglo-Norman verse.? By 1155 Wace had com- 
pleted his Brut, which in substance is almost entirely 
based on Geoffrey’s Historia. Early in the next 
century Layamon wrote his English Brut, em- 
bodying, with many interesting additions and 
embellishments of his own, the main features of 
Geofirey’s and Wace’s narrative. Then follow a 
long line of English chroniclers, in both prose and 
verse, from Robert of Gloucester.down to Grafton 
and Holinshed, who pass on Geoffrey’s fables as 
authentic history. In the Elizabethan age, in spite 
of attempts made to discredit him by critics and 
antiquaries, like Polydore Vergil and Camden,

chronicle of Anglo-Saxon and Norman kings has been edited and 
translated by Duffus Hardy in the Rolls Series,

  86 KING ARTHUR [ox. 
Geoffrey continues to be drawn upon by the foets. 
Sackville and Spenser, Warner and Drayton, and 
others, give a new currency to his British legends, 
and Drayton even goes out of his way to defend 
his impugned reputation. Spenser, in borrowing 
from his record of British kings, pays him a well- 
known tribute in the second book of The Faerie 
Queene. But, perhaps, the finest tribute of all 
to Geoffrey’s History is that of Wordsworth in 
‘Artegal and Elidure,’ where he sings of the 
“ British record” in which 
“We read of Spenser’s fairy themes, 
And those that Milton loved in youthful years ; 
The sage enchanter Merlin’s subtle schemes ; 
The feats of Arthur and his knightly peers ; 
Of Arthur, who, to upper light restored, 
With that terrific sword 
Which yet he brandishes for future war 
Shall lift his country’s fame above the polar star!” 
' Although Geoffrey’s book found so much accept-.- 
ance in his own time and afterwards, it’ is sig- 
nificant to note that, even soon after its appear- 
ance and in the very heyday of its repute, a few 
shrewd critics ventured to question its authenticity. 
William of Newburgh, as we have seen, denounced 
it unreservedly as a tissue of impudent lies. He, 
1 Polyolbion, Song x.
-P-A-G-E-97
  11.] GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH 87 
at any rate, had no scruple in treating the work as 
a deliberate experiment in fiction under the guise 
of a chronicle. A different attitude towards the 
book might have been expected from Giraldus 
Cambrensis, a Welshman proud of his race and of 
its “ old and haughty ” traditions, who was himself 
‘ not unskilled in the art of fiction. Yet it is Gerald 
who, of all Geoffrey’s critics, says much the un- 
kindest thing on record of the Historia. He tells 
us of a Welshman at Caerleon named Melerius, or 
Meilir, who had dealings with evil spirits, and was 
“enabled through their assistance to foretell-future 
events.” “He knew when anyone spoke falsely 
in his presence, for he saw the devil as it were 
leaping and exulting on the tongue of the liar. . . . 
Tf the evil spirits oppressed him too much, the 
Gospel of St John was placed on his bosom, when, 
like birds, they immediately vanished}. but when 
that book was removed, and the History of the 
Britons by Geoffrey Arthur was substituted in its 
- place, they instantly reappeared in greater numbers, 
and remained a longer time than usual on his body 
and on the book.” 
Geoffrey, in the epilogue to his History, hands over 
the task of writing of “the kings who succeeded in 
Wales’ from the time at which his narrative closes 
to “Caradoc of Llancarvan, my contemporary.” 
Caradoc was an undoubted Welshman, but no Latin be

continuation by him of Geoffrey’s chronicle dealing 
with the Welsh kings is known to exist, and it is 
very doubtful whether a Welsh compilation bearing 
his name, and bringing Geoffrey’s narrative down 
to the year 1156, is a genuine work of his. It is, 
however, highly probable that he was the author of 
the Latin Life of Gildas, preserved in a twelfth 
century MS now in the library of Corpus Christi 
College, Cambridge. This work is of peculiar 
interest as containing certain Arthurian traditions 
which were apparently unknown to Geoffrey. Gildas 
is represented, in this fictitious biography, as being 
a contemporary of Arthur, king of all Britain, whom 
he loved and obeyed. He had, however, twenty- 
three refractory brothers who refused allegiance to 
Arthur, and the eldest of. them, Hueil,' or Huel, King 
of Scotland, fought a battle with him in “ the isle. 
of Minau” and was killed. Gildas, who was in 
Ireland at the time, was much distressed to hear 
of this, but, as became a saint, he prayed for Arthur, 
and, returning to Britain, granted the king the 
pardon which he besought. Further on in the Life 
we get a version, probably the earliest in literature,? 
» 1 Hueil, and the cause of his quarrel with Arthur, are incidentally. 
mentioned in Kulhwech and Olwen. Hueil, we there read, had stabbed 
-his sister’s son Gwydre, ‘‘ and hatred was between Hueil and Arthur 
because of the wound.” 
“Rhys, who doubts Cerne cs authorship of the Life of Gildas, 
is “certain that the story ” of Melwas “is ancient, for Chrétien de
-P-A-G-E-99
  111.] GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH 89 
of the story of the abduction of Guinevere by Melwas 
(the Mellyagraunce of Malory), “the wicked king 
of the Summer Country,” or Somerset. After long 
seeking for a convenient opportunity, Melwas carries 
her violently away to Glastonia, or Glastonbury, a 
place chosen by him as being apparently impregnable 
because of the marshes around it. Arthur, dis- 
covering her retreat, besieges Glastonbury with a 
large army drawn from Cornwall and Devon. Before, 
however, he and Melwas engage in battle, the monks 
of the abbey, accompanied by Gildas, intervene ; 
peace is made, and the queen is restored to her 
lawful husband. 
Of the many chroniclers who, either in prose or 
in verse, repeat and embellish Geoffrey’s Arthurian 
narrative, by far the most interesting, and the most 
* important in their influence upon the literary 
development of Arthurian story, are Wace and 
Layamon. Both are poets, and their metrical Bruts 
mark, as it were, the transitional stage between the 
Arthur of history and traditional legend and the 
Arthur of pure romance. Wace, according to 
Layamon, dedicated his poem, which was completed 
in 1155, to “the noble Eleanor, who was the high 
King Henry’s queen.” ! This statement—and there   
Troyes in his Zrec speaks of Maheloas as the Lord of the Glass Island— 
“Li sire de l’isle de voirre.’”” Arthurian Legend, p- 52,

  is no reason to doubt its truth—affords another 
indication of the interest of the Angevin court in the 
literary exploitation of “the matter of Britain.” 
Geoffrey had already besought royal approval for 
his presentment of British legends, and had done 
his best to clothe his account of Arthur’s deeds in 
the highly-coloured rhetorical trappings that would 
commend it to courtly Norman readers. . Wace 
went further. He took Geoffrey’s matter and dressed 
it up in a poetical form in French, thus giving it a 
much more widespread currency than a.Latin prose 
chronicle could ever have done. Arthur becomes, 
.in his Brut, the flower of chivalry, and his entire 
narrative is decorated in a way that would appeal 
to the imagination of all knightly Anglo-Normans, 
Nor is he without thought of the courtly ladies who 
took so lively an interest in tales of chivalry. Like 
Chrétien de Troyes and other romancers, he is at some 
pains to elaborate his descriptions of scenes of love. 
He takes delight in dwelling upon the accoutrements 
of warriors, and upon their individual exploits in the 
field. But it is not alone in such embellishments— 
the deliberate attempts of a courtly writer to please 
a courtly circle of readers—that Wace differs from 
Geoffrey. He adds to his narrative many details 
which indicate that he also had at his command an 
independent fund of Arthurian traditions. Wace’s 
literary celebrity is due, perhaps, most of all to the
-P-A-G-E-101
    mt.] GEOFFREY OF MONMOU'        fact that he:is the first Arthurian writer to m 
the Round Table. “The Bretons,” he says, 
many a fable of the Table Round,” but he does not 
explain whence such fables came, or where he heard 
them told! He does, however, inform us that the 
Table was made round because_each_of Arthur’s 
knights thought himself better than his fellows, and 
about precedence among them. The praise of the 
knights of the Round Table, he adds in another place, 
was loud throughout the world.» Again, Wace adds 
considerably to Geoffrey’s description of the passing 
of Arthur. The king is not only taken to Avalon 
“to be cured of his wounds,’’-—the Bretons con- 
fidently expect his recovery, and look for his return. 
“ He is still there ; the Bretons await him ; they say 
that he will come back and live again.’’ 
Wace’s metrical chronicle formed the basis of 
the still more elaborate, and the more poetical, 
metrical Brut of the Englishman, Layamon,—the 
most remarkable English contribution to Arthurian 
literature until we come to Sir Gawayne and the 
| Grene Knight. Here we have a brave attempt to do 
1 The question of the mythological origin of the Round Table is 
one of the many indeterminate problems of Arthurian “criticism.” 
For a suggestive study of the question see Brown, The Round Table 
before Wace (Harvard Studies and Notes, Vol. VII., 1900), where he 
confidently states that “ the Round Table was a very early Pan-Celti¢ 
institution.” “

  Caxton long afterwards desireil,—to make 
rthur the best “ remembered among Englishmen 
before all other Christian kings.” Wace’s poem 
was a contribution to the polite literature of the - 
Normans; Layamon’s, though his matter is so 
largely borrowed from Wace, is a patriotic English . 
epic. It was his aspiration, as we learn from~the 
opening lines of his Brut, “ to tell the noble deeds. of 
England,” and in his record of those deeds Arthur, 
who had been all but denationalised by the romancers, 
is restored to his fatherland and duly figures as the 
great “ Christian king of England.” But Layamon 
was a poet no less than a patriotic chronicler, and 
could not help listening to the blowings of “the 
horns of Elfland.” ’Arthur’s prowess and royal 
attributes were such as could not be explained 
except for the intervention of superhuman powers. 
Elves surrounded him when he came into the world ; 
it was from them that he derived the gifts which 
made him the best of knights and the mightiest of 
kings.! Again, at his passing, Arthur says that he is 
about to go to the splendid elf, Argante (Morgain, or 
Morgan, la fé) ; “she will heal me of all my wounds, 
and shall make me all hale; and afterwards I shall 
come to my kingdom and dwell among the Britons 
with mickle joy.”* Arthur’s byrnie was made for him

so_large, and took four weeks to make, the table 
could, by some magic means, be carried by Arthur 
as he rode, and placed by him wherever he chose. 
Layamon had evidently heard more about the Round 
Table, ‘‘ of which the Britons boast,” than he cares 
to disclose in his poem ; but “ the Britons,” he tells 
us at the end of his description of the Table, say 
“many leasings’ of King Arthur and attribute to 
him things “that never happened in the kingdom 
of this world.” 
No more spirited, or more romantic, passage is to 
be found in Layamon’s poem than that in which he 
describes Arthur’s last battle. It was fought at 
Camelford, “a name that will last for ever.” The 
stream, hard by, “was flooded with blood un- 
measured.” The combatants were pressed-so close

    that they could not distinguish friend from foe ; 
“each slew downright were he swain, were he 
knight.”” Modred, and all his knights, were slain, 
as were also “all the brave ones, Arthur’s warriors, 
high and low, and all the Britons of Arthur’s board’ 
None remained alive at the end of the battle,—and 
they were two hundred thousand men who fought 
there,—save Arthur and two of his knights. Arthur, 
grievously wounded, bequeaths his kingdom to 
Constantine, Cador’s son, and says that he himself 
will go unto Avalon to be healed by Argante,‘“ the 
fairest of all maidens.” And “even with the 
words there came from the sea a short boat, borne on 
the waves, and two women therein, wondrously 
arrayed ; and they took Arthur anon, and bare 
him quickly, and softly laid him down, and fared 
forth away. Then was brought to pass that 
which Merlin whilom said, that there should be 
sorrow untold at Arthur’s forthfaring. The Britons 
believe yet that he is alive, and dwelleth in Avalon, 
with the fairest of all elves, and ever yet the Britons 
look for Arthur’s coming. Was never the man born, 
nor ever of woman chosen, that knoweth the sooth, 
to say more of Arthur. But whilom there was a 
seer hight Merlin; he said with words—and his 
sayings were sooth—that an Arthur should yet 
come to help the Britons.”

CHAPTER IV 
ROMANCE 
Brrore the close of the twelfth century the Arthur 
of popular legend, and of the chronicles, had been 
transformed into a purely romantic hero. The 
British king, soon after the appearance of Geoffrey’s 
History, becomes the centre of the most profitably 
worked of the cycles of medieval romance; Much 
. of his individuality is, inevitably, lost in the process ; 
and that loss implies, no less inevitably, a gradual 
obscuration of the primitive British environment 
which originally surrounded him. The paramount 
chief of early Britain, whose prowess and conquests 
form the prime epic theme of Geoffrey and of 
Layamon, appears as the king of no known realm, 
numbering among his retainers heroic figures drawn 
from the uttermost limits of the mythical world. 
Exalted, as a world conqueror, to a level with 
Alexander and Charlemagne, he becomes, like them, 
largely lost to sight among the crowd of fabulous 
characters called up around him by the pro- 
fessional romancers. The Arthur of the romances 
%5

is no more than a primus inter pares. He does, 
indeed, stand above his knights by virtue of his royal 
dignity,—he is still “ King Arthur,” and the head 
of a great Court. But our interest in his own per- 
sonality diminishes with the increasing accumula- 
tion of exploits attributed to his knightly retinue. 
The glory of the king is dimmed by the general 
brilliance of his Court. It is as though the Round 
Table, originally founded to put an end to all claims 
of precedence among his knights, had had the result 
of bringing Arthur himself into the unvalued “ file.” 
Knightly heroes, of whom little, or nothing, had been 
heard before, enter the Arthurian circle, and perform 
feats which interest us far more than anything done 
by the king. In early Welsh tradition, and in 
Geoffrey’s chronicle, Kay and Bedivere and, later, 
Gawain, alone figure as warriors whose deeds are at 
all worth mentioning by the side of Arthur’s. In 
the romances, Kay and Bedivere play quite sub- 
ordinate parts, while Gawain becomes much more 
prominent, only, however, to find his high station 
challenged, and frequently usurped, by newcomers 
such as Tristram and Perceval and Lancelot. 
The cause of all this change is obvious. The age 
of Chivalry had come, and the Arthurian stories 
provided “‘ the raw material ” exactly suited to its 
romantic literary requirements. The original Celtic 
legends concerning Arthur and his few primitive
-P-A-G-E-107

Iv.] ROMANCE 97 
“knights ” lent themselves, at once, to adaptation 
and embellishment by writers whose main concern 
was with knight-errantry and courtly love; hile 
the conception of an Arthurian “ court,” with its 
fellowship of questing knights, invited the importa- 
tion into it of any and every legendary hero whose 
story could in any plausible way be connected with 
Arthur. They had another advantage which con- 
tributed to their supreme popularity in the twelfth 
and the thirteenth centuries. They had about them 
an element of mystery, of magic, of indefiniteness, 
coming as they did from the Celtic wonderland in the 
— West. The Arthurian kingdom had no geography,— 
it was a “no man’s land,” which defied all carto- 
graphy, and the bounds of which could be extended 
by each romantic writer at his will. It is true that 
British tradition, and the bards and chroniclers who 
had sought to give it literary form, associated Arthur’s 
name with well-known localities in- Great Britain ; 
but, even there, the “ champion of Britain ” had no 
settled capital or court. London, the chief city of 
the Norman kings, claimed him as her own; but so 
did Winchester, Lincoln, York, Chester and Carlisle. 
Then there was Caerleon-upon-Usk, the delectable 
“metropolitan city’ where Geoffrey of Monmouth 
had definitely located his court in Wales. Moreover 
places in Britain with mysterious legendary associa- 
tions came to be connected with Arthur’s name.

Glastonbury, whither Joseph of Arimathea was 
fabled to have brought the Holy Grail, was reputed 
to be his burial-place, and the district around it was 
identified with the mythical Avalon. The grim 
old western castle of Tintagel was fixed upon as his 
birthplace, and the tale of the battle on the Camel 
led to the building, in poetic imagination,’ of a 
new Arthurian court at “ tower’d Camelot.” The 
name of Camelot at once suggests such purely 
romantic regions as ‘‘ the wild woods of Broceliande ” 
\.and “the sad sea-sounding wastes of Lyonesse.” * 
Astolat, Cameliard, Sarras, Carbonek, Joyous Gard,

and lie quite beyond geographical identification. 
Stories, in which the characters thus roamed in- 
differently among places well known to Norman 
England and in regions which belonged entirely to 
“the land of phantasy and illusion,” lay open to

many varied sources. In a word, the unrivalled 
possibilities of “the matter of Britain” for all 
kinds of romantic. exploitation established for it

of romance throughout Western Europe all but

robbed it, ultimately, of its distinctive features as a 
native British growth. 
The various stages in the romantic use and 
adaptation of the Arthurian legends, mainly by 
French writers, are not difficult to trace. ( First 
of all, we get the metrical chronicles,—attempts to 
put Geoffrey’s quasi-historical record into a poetical 
form which much better suited its heroic theme 
than the sober garb of Latin prose. Wace’s Brut, 
completed in the year of Geoffrey’s death, is our 
earliest extant example of this poetical treatment 
of Arthurian story, and his work, as we have seen, 
was written with a much more deliberate purpose 
of pleasing courtly readers than Geoffrey’s, The 
tastes and requirements of such readers, regarded 
solely from the standpoint of their interest in knight- 
errantry and romantic love, determine the character 
of the second and the third phase which Arthurian 
literature assumes. The metrical, and the prose, 
French romances began to be written about the 
same time, and from the same motive. It is gener- 
ally held, however, that the poetical romancers were 
in the field before the prose writers : at any rate, the 
most famous of the metrical romances—those of 
Chrétien de Troyes—are earlier than any prose 
romances which have come-down to us. Chrétien, 
in whom his admirers find the greatest medieval 
poet before Chaucer, wrote for the Norman arist-

ocracy, and especially for ladies, what were practi- 
cally the fashionable novels of the day. He dedicates 
his Chevalier de la Charrette to the countess Marie of 
Champagne, whose interest in everything appertain- 
ing to the French cult of l'amour courtois is well 
known ; and all his poetical ‘novels’ are largely 
designed for the entertainment of women eager 
for literature of a more sentimental appeal than 
sagas of monster-slayers and warriors. The sudden 
appearance of the immortal love-stories of Tristan 
and Iseult, and of Lancelot and Guinevere, shows 
how triumphantly the French romancers responded 
to the demands made of them. 
Chrétien de Troyes’ share in the literary flotation 
of both these stories entitles him to a place in the 
history of pure Arthurian romance even above that 
of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Geoffrey can claim, 
beyond any question, to be the literary father of 
King Arthur himself as a romantic hero. But the 
| Arthurian legend, as it emerged from medieval 
| romance and as we know it in its modern present- 
| ment by the poets, contains so much more than the 
| story of Arthur that the French romantic scribes 
| who brought Tristan.and Lancelot and Perceval into 
| Arthur’s court must be regarded as the first artistic 
, fashioners of a purely poetic “‘ matter of Britain.”

Lancelot romance—-Walter Map, stand pre-eminent. 
As to Chrétien’s signal share in the work there is, 
at any rate, no controversy, and his name is asso- 
ciated with the poetical treatment of the stories of 
each of the three celebrated heroes just mentioned. 
He is believed! to have been the author of a lost 
Tristan poem—probably his first work, composed 
about 1160,—which is surmised to have been the 
foundation of the long prose Tristan romance, 
whence Malory drew much of his material. It is in 
his Chevalier de la Charreite that we first hear of 
Lancelot as a lover of Guinevere. His unfinished 
Conte del Graal is one of the first literary presenta- 
tions of the story of Perceval. 
Two other poems of Chrétien are, with the Conte 
del Graal, of exceptional interest as bearing a close 
relationship to three Welsh prose romances included 
in The Red Book of Hergest, and translated by Lady 
Charlotte Guest. The Welsh analogue of the Conte 
del Graal is the so-called ‘mabinogi’ of Peredur, 
son of Hvrawe; while the Welsh tales called Geraint, 
son of Erbin, and The Lady of the Fountain resemble, 
in their main features, Chrétien’s two poems entitled 
Erec and Le chevalier au lion. The Welsh romances, 
as we have them, are undoubtedly of later date 
than Chrétien’s poems, and bear such clear traces 
of Norman-French influence as to have led many 
critics to deny altogether their Celtic origin. But

  102 KING ARTHUR [oH. 
they are neither translations, nor adaptations of 
Chrétien’s works.1_ The only explanation that meets 
all the facts is that the French poems and the Welsh 
tales follow an older and a simpler Celtic form of the 
stories embodied in them, which was accessible both 
to Chrétien and the Welsh writers. 
Although by no means the best, the Chevalier de la 
Charrette is perhaps the most interesting of Chrétien’s 
extant works, for the reason that we obtain in it our 
first literary introduction to the story of Lancelot of 
the Lake. It treats, indeed, of only an episode in 
that famous knight’s career, but that episode reveals 
him to us as the lover of Arthur’s queen, and so 
marks an important stage in the evolution of 
Arthurian romance. In Chrétien’s poem, Guinevere 
is abducted by Meleaguant,? the son of the king of a 
land whence no man returns. Her rescue is accom- 
plished by Lancelot, who, in order to achieve his 
object, has to ride in a cart used as a tumbril to 
convey prisoners to execution; hence the name 
given to him and to the poem, ‘The Knight of the 
Cart.’ Welsh tradition knows nothing whatever 
of the loves of Lancelot and Guinevere, although, as 
1So much has been clearly proved in the case of Peredur, for 
instance, in a French essay on the composition of that romance 
recently published from Paris by Dr Mary Williams, formerly Fellow 
of the University of Wales. 
2? This, of course, is an obvious variant of the story told in the Life 
of Gildas, already mentioned, of Guinevere’s abduction by Melwas.
-P-A-G-E-113
Ww] ROMANCE 102 
  we have seen, Guinevere did come to have in Welsh 
folk-lore a doubtful reputation that somewhat 
debased her name. It is in his Lancelot poem alone 
that Chrétien suggests that Guinevere was anything 
but a gracious and loving wife. Whence, then, did he 
derive the story of her illicit relations with Lancelot ? 
Some see in it the influence of the Tristram legend, 
in which passionate love breaks every bond. Others 
attribute the invention of Lancelot as Guinevere’s 
lover to the personal suggestion of Marie of Champ- 
agne, who, according to Chrétien’s own account, 
furnished him with the material for his poem. 
sWhatever may be the truth about its origin, the story ¢_ 
of Lancelot is an obvious, indeed the most signal, 
example of the way in which the Arthurian legends 
were adapted to suit the conceptions of chivalry. 
We have in it a capital instance of what was implied 
in the cult of “ courtly love,” and hence it is not 
surprising that among medieval tales women, as 
Chaucer informs us, held “in ful gret reverence the 
boke of Lancelot de Lake.” + That book was not

Walter Map. The same prose story, or one of its 
adaptations, was presumably the book in which 
Paolo and Francesca read, as related by Dante in the 
Fifth Canto of his Inferno,

104 KING ARTHUR [cx. 
  The prose Lancelot is a vast compilation embracing 
what is really a series of romances, including a 
version of the Grail story, and is attributed, on good 
MS. authority, to the courtier Walter Map. If he 
be indeed its author, he is entitled to as high a 
pedestal in the Arthurian House of Fame as either 
Geoffrey or Chrétien. The difficulty of accepting his 
authorship of the work is not so much that he was 
a very active public man, as that the one book of 
which he is the indubitable author, the De Nugis 
Curialium,—a sort of commonplace book in which 
contemporary history finds a place side by side with 
fairy tales, and much other odd lore,—does not 
afford the slightest trace of interest in Arthurian 
story. Map’s name was used to give a literary 
passport to the notorious Goliardic poems gathered 
from many cryptic sources in the thirteenth century, 
and it may very well be that the ascription to him 
of so wholly laudable a work as the Lancelot was 
dictated by some too modest scribe’s desire for high 
credentials. 
The other great love-story of Arthurian romance, 
that of Tristram and Iseult, is the most poetical and 
the most poignant in tragic interest of all the tales 
that came to be included in “ the matter of Britain.” 
The story of Lancelot, with all its charm and pathos, 
betrays only too obviously its origin in the artificial 
conventions of “courtly love.” The story of

Tristram, on the other hand, is one of sheer, over- 
mastering, natural passion,—the first really great 
story of passionate romantic love in modern litera- 
ture. It is also, in its scene, its characters, its 
colouring, a distinctively Celtic tale. Tristram'is 
known to early Welsh tradition under the name of 
Drystan, the son of Tallwch, as a purely mythical 
hero; so also is Mark, or March ab Meirchion, who, 
in the first literary versions of the story, appears 
as King of Cornwall. The “proud, first Iseult, 
Cornwall’s queen,” 
“She who, as they voyaged, quafi’d 
With Tristram that spiced magic draught,” 
came from Ireland ; while the other Iseult, 
“the patient flower, 
Who possess’d his darker hour, 
Tseult of the Snow-White hand,” ? 
had her home in Brittany. The entire atmosphere 
of the story is that of the western Celtic sea- 
board, where lay the mystic land of Lyonesse, then 
“ unswallowed of the tides,” and 
“the wind-hollowed heights and gusty bays 
Of sheer Tintagel, fair with famous days.” * 
Whence the French romancers derived the story it

  106 KING ARTHUR [cn. 
is impossible to say ; but it is probable that it existed 
in the form of scattered popular lays long before the 
widdle of the twelfth century. Fragments of two 
Tristan poems by the Anglo-Normans, Béroul and 
Thomas, otherwise known as Thomas de Bretagne, 
have come down to us.1_ These two poems were the 
foundations, respectively, of the German metrical 
versions of the story by Hilhart von Oberge and 
Gottfried von Strassburg. 
The most intricate, though not the least fascinating, 
problem connected with the Arthurian legends is that 
of accounting for the origin, and for the attachment 
to the original Arthurian stock, of the story of the 
Grail and its quest. Here, at any, rate, we have 
presented to us, in Tennyson’s words, “Soul at war 
with Sense ’’; and it is clear enough that the gradual 
manipulation of the Grail stories marks a deliberate 
effort by ecclesiastical writers to neutralise the 
influence of the dangerous ideals of chivalry upon 
Arthurian romance. Celibacy had to be shown to 
be compatible with true knighthood; there was no 
reason why a knight-errant should make love, and, 
all too often, illicit love, the sole motive of his quest 
for adventure. So, we have ultimately created for 
us the character of Galahad, who 
1M. Bédier, in his’ edition of Thomas’s J'ristan, maintains that 
the original of all the various versions of the story was a single © 
poem composed in England. This is a disputed point among scholars, 
but it is generally agreed that the story is of British origin.

“ never felt the kiss of love 
Nor maiden’s hand in his,” 
and who alone, by virtue of his purity, is allowed to 
“find the Holy Grail.” The earlier forms of the 
Grail legend know nothing of Galahad, nor is there 
any reason for supposing that they had any religious 
significance. . Gawain, apparently,—he who, in his 
progress through the romances, degenerates so much 
as to be finally described as “light in life and light 
in death,” '—was the original hero of the Grail 
quest. It is Perceval, however, who is the central 
figure of the best-known versions of the story—as, 
for example, the Conte del Graal, the Welsh Peredur, 
and Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Parzival. But 
Perceval was not immaculate, and so had to be super- 
seded by one who “exemplified, in a yet more 
uncompromising, yet more inhuman, spirit, the ideal 
of militant asceticism,” ?—the virginal and youngest 
knight of the Round Table, Galahad. And, in order 
to establish Galahad’s right to a place in the 
Arthurian fellowship, he is introduced as the son of 
Lancelot. Here is an artistic touch deserving much 
more appreciation than it has yet generally received. 
The sin of Lancelot is largely expiated by the un- 
sullied purity of his son. Truly, the “ militant

ascetics” knew their romantic business as well as 
_the best of the secular scribes.t 
' It is unnecessary, here, to outline the various 
ramifications of the Grail legend, or to summarise 
the conflicting theories advanced as to its origin 
and meaning. It comes to be connected with 
Arthur’s court mainly through the knightly Perceval, 
who, though ultimately deposed as the Grail hero by 
Galahad, remains to the end the real protagonist of the 
story. The Grail romances are usually divided into 
two classes,—one dealing with the “ Quest” proper, 
and the other with the ‘‘ Early History” of the Holy 
Grail. In the “Quest” group of stories—three of 
which have been named above—the main interest 
lies in the personality of Perceval, and in his adven- 
tures in search of certain talismans, which include a 
sword, a bleeding lance and a “ grail,” the latter, in 
Chrétien’s poem, a magic vessel, in Wolfram’s, a

stone. The “Early History” group—of which the 
chief representatives are the Joseph of Arimathea 
and the Merlin of Robert de Borron, and the Quéte 
del St Graal attributed to Map,—dwell chiefly upon 
the origin and nature of these talismans. The Grail 
legends, as given in these and other romances, and so 
far as they can be put into a coherent whole, are 
undoubtedly a compound of remote mythical and 
pagan elements, probably Celtic,) and of later 
accretions due to monastic writers deliberately bent 
upon edification. A flagrant example of the way in 
which the legends were turned to ecclesiastical uses 
is furnished by the identification of the Grail with 
the cup of the Last Supper, which Pilate gave to 
Joseph of Arimathea, and in which Joseph treasured 
the blood that flowed from the Saviour’s wounds 
on the Cross. Joseph brought this cup to Britain, 
and thus the Grail came to be connected with the 
mythical story which attributed to Joseph the first 
evangelisation of these islands.   1 This, of course, raises a vexed question,—two schools of critics, 
one German, and the other English, French and American, being at 
feud upon it. In connection with the alleged Welsh origin of some 
of these traditions, it may be mentioned that the suggestion has 
been recently made that the first collection of them for “ romantic” 
purposes was due to a Welshman variously known as Bledri, Bleheris, 
or Bledhericus, who lived probably in the eleventh century, and is 
spoken of by Giraldus Cambrensis as a ‘ famosus fabulator, qui

110 KING ARTHUR [on. 
It has been said that Gawain was, in all probability, 
the original hero of the Grail quest.1_ Whatever the 
truth may be about that matter, there can be no 
doubt that Gawain is the most famous of all the 
knights grouped around Arthur in pre-romantic 
tradition. He figures largely in the Welsh Triads 
and in the Mabinogion under the name of Gwalch- 
mei, and in the story of Arthur’s wars as told by 
Geoffrey he is the king’s most powerful lieutenant. 
Originally a mythical hero, he was probably the 
centre of a cycle of traditional stories as old as, if 
not older than, anything fabled or sung of Arthur.? 
No other knight of the Arthurian court is the hero 
of so many episodic romances and poems, while there 
is no more prominent figure in Arthurian literature 
generally. No other knight, however, is subjected 
to such churlish treatment at the hands of the 
romancers as he. In the earlier stages of Arthurian 
story—in the Mabinogion, especially, — Gawain 
appears as the very flower of chivalrous knighthood, 
no less courteous and gracious than brave. His 
degradation is due largely to the later manipulators 
of the Grail legends, who could not brook the import- 
ance attached to so worldly a character. Malory 
1 He is made the actual achiever of the quest in the German poem 
Diu Kréne, by Heinrich von dem Titlin,

  Iv] ROMANCE 111 
and Tennyson follow in their footsteps, until for 
modern readers Gawain is branded with the words 
put into the mouth of Bedivere in The Passing 
of Arthur,—of Bedivere, who, as one of Gawain’s 
oldest associates in Arthur’s service, ought to have 
been spared the indignity of having attributed to him 
so mean an aspersion upon a comrade in arms: 
“ Light was Gawain in life, and light in death 
Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man.” 
Gawain, however, was the favourite Arthurian hero 
in England up to Malory’s time,’ and the finest 
contribution to English Arthurian romance in the 
Middle Ages,—Sir Gawayne and the Grene Knight,— 
dealing, apparently, with an incident borrowed from 
the earlier traditions about Gawain, does full 
justice to him as a knight sans peur et sans reproche. 
The most marvellous feature of Geoffrey of Mon- 
mouth’s story of Arthur is the part played by the 
wizard Merlin in the events that led to Arthur’s 
birth. It is in Geoffrey’s History that we get, so 
far as is known, the first definite association of 
Merlin with the Arthurian legends. In subsequent 
romance Merlin stands in the first file of Arthurian 
characters, and his name is given to a group of 
romances as important as any of those dealing with

the adventures of the great knights mentioned in 
the last few pages.(_In Welsh tradition Merlin, or 
Myrddin, was famous as both a bard and a magician, } 
but the poetical compositions which bear his name 
may safely be taken as spurious. Geoffrey exalts 
him as a prophet as well, and the ‘ Prophecies of 
Merlin’ contributed largely to the renown of the 
History of the Kings of Britain. Geoffrey’s author- 
ship is sometimes claimed for a Latin poem called 
the Vita Merlini, and composed about 1148, which 
tells much about the enchanter that is not always 
easy to reconcile with the account of him given in 
the History. The chief French romantic works 
dealing with the Merlin legend are a fragmentary 
poem, dating from the end of the twelfth century, and 
supposed to be by Robert de Borron, and the prose 
romance of Merlin, which exists in two forms known 
as the “ ordinary ’’ Merlin and the Suite de Merlin, 
of the latter of which Malory’s first four books 
are an abridgment. In these romances we first 
read of the enchanter’s own enchantment, how 
he was, in Malory’s words, “‘assotted and doted ” 
on a “damosel of the lake,’”—Ninien, or Nimue, 
a name that in the latest forms of the story comes 
to be Vivien. In these early French versions of 
the Merlin legend, also, appears the first suggestion 
that Modred was Arthur’s son. When the wife of 
King Lot,—the daughter of Igerne by her first

husband,—came to King Arthur’s court soon after 
his coronation, Arthur fell in love with her, with the 
result that Modred was born. Modred’s rebellion, 
and the tragic end of Arthur himself, were thus 
represented as a just retribution for the king’s 
misconduct. ; : 
For English readers Malory’s Morte Darthur is 
the book in which the various strands of romantic 
matter reviewed in this chapter are woven into a 
connected, though not always a coherently artistic, 
texture. From a literary point of view, the relative 
values of the various constituents of ‘The French 
book’ whence Malory derived most of his material 
are of little consequence. What really matter are 
the style, the tone, the atmosphere of his own book ; \ 
and these are charged to the full with the subtle 
magic of the enchanted land in which his bor- 
rowed characters live and move. It is here that we 
reap the harvest of medieval romance, and catch, 
in the beautifully quaint style of the narrative, 
something of the fresh odour and mellow colouring 
of the ripened corn. Of equally small importance 
with the question of the precise identification and 
the value of his sources is that of Malory’s general 
motive, or plan. It may, indeed, be possible to find 
in the book an epic in which “ may be traced a 
thread of destiny and providence, leading either to 
a happy triumph over circumstance, or to a tragic

doom.” ! But it is for no such reason that the 
Morte Darthur is valued by the modern reader. We 
read Malory now both for “his style and his love,” 
—his love of ‘“‘ King Arthur and his noble knights of 
the Round Table,” attested so signally by his painful 
zeal in garnering, and sifting, such a bewildering 
crop, both rich and rank, of manuscript material. 
His “style” is sufficiently near to the English of 
to-day, but at the same time retains so much in both 
vocabulary and grammar which the invention of 
printing forced the language to reject, as to be an 
almost ideal medium for the presentment to modern 
English readers of what was storied in the verse and 
prose of the age of high romance. Space does not 
allow of our giving any extended specimens of 
it here; but the reader may be referred, first, 
to a passage where Malory appropriately em- 
broiders his narrative by expatiating upon ‘“‘ How 
true love is likened to summer,” ® and, secondly, to 
the noble and pathetic chapter which tells of the 
passing of Arthur.’ Incidental felicities of style 
could be quoted from almost every page of his 
book. Bedivere, when returning from his pretended 
attempt to “ fling Excalibur,” tells Arthur that he 
saw “nothing but the waters wap and the waves 
wan.” Tristan, in a general fight, “ fared among

those knights like a greyhound among the conies ” ; 
while, of another fight we read that “the best 
of us all had been full cold at the heart-root had 
not Sir Launcelot been better than we.” What, 
again, could be in better chime with its theme than 
this sentence from the account of Gawain’s fight 
with Launcelot—< then Sir Gawaine deliberately 
avoided his horse, and put his shield afore him, and 
eagerly drew his sword, and bad Sir Launcelot, 
Alight, traitor knight, for if this mare’s son hath 
failed me, wit thou well a king’s son and a queen’s 
son shall not fail thee’? Or, what more pathetic 
than Guinevere’s words when Lancelot found her 
in the nunnery at Almesbury—“ Sir Launcelot, 
wit thou well I am set in such a plight to get my 
soul’s health ; and yet I trust, through God’s grace, 
that after my death to have a sight of the blessed face 
of Christ, and at doomsday to sit on his right side, 
for as sinful as ever I was are saints in heaven ”’ ? 
But the entire work is studded with such gems, and 
he who would know and revel in the richest treasures 
of Arthurian romance should devote his days and 
his nights to the reading of what is ingenuously, and 
truly, styled in its epilogue, “this noble and joyous 
book.’”!

ARTHUR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE 
[Bxoxtse Arthurian romance before Malory,\ with 
the conspicuous exception of Sir Gawayne and the 
Grene Knight—an alliterative poem composed in 
the fourteenth century by an unknown author to 
whom three other poems, The Pearl, Cleanness, 
and Patience, are ascribed —fpossesses little literary 
charm’ or distinction. The wearisome monotony 
and the generally jejune character of the common 
metrical romances of his day, with their stereotyped 
phraseology and futile rhymes, had probably as 
much to do as anything with Chaucer’s attitude 
*towards the newer romantic matters. His Tale of 
Sir Thopas is so openly contemptuous a burlesque 
of the methods of the romantic rhymers of the time | 
that we may safely assume that the poet had little | 
more respect for their themes. 
“ Into his sadel he clamb anon, 
And priketh over stile and stoon

It was scarcely possible for one who could 
write so irreverently as this of Elf-land and its 
denizens to attune himself to the mood required for 
grave poetical treatment of Arthurian story. An 
Arthurian setting of a sort is indeed given to The 
Wife of Bath’s Tale; but the facetious tone of the 
opening lines only too plainly reveals Chaucer’s sense 
of the unreality of it all. 
“Tn tholdé dayes of the Kyng Arthour,” 
he writes, 
“Al was this land fulfild of faérie. 
The elf-queene with hir joly compaignye 
Daaced ful ofte in many a grené mede.” 
But, he adds, there are no fairies now; “ lymytours 
_ and other holy freres ” have effectually driven them 
away. - 
“ For ther as wont to wallken was an elf, 
Ther walketh now the lymytour hymself.” 
With the elves had gone the knights-errant, and 
Chaucer’s poetical genius was not of the kind to 
restore either to their original pride of place in 
imaginative literature. 
(t was Malory who gave new. life to the

Arthurian legends, and to him, more than to any 
other writer, is due the fascination which Arthurian 
story has had_for so many modern English poets. 
Malory’s book,\ as we know from Ascham’s testi- 
mony, fvas exceedingly popular in the Elizabethan 
age ;\ but there were other causes of the interest 
then so widely felt in ancient British legends. 
Throughout the sixteenth century chroniclers were 
busy in recording, and antiquaries in investigating, 
the early annals of Britain; and, in the reign of 
Elizabeth herself, the heightened patriotic feeling 
of the day was a potent stimulus to all who sought 
to discover material for, and to reconstruct from it, 
the history of their country. Hence |Geoffrey of 
Monmouth’s Latin chronicle in its first printed forms 
comes to be one of the most eagerly studied books 
of the timé.) And it is, perhaps, not fanciful to find 
in the new interest aroused in the annals and legends 
of early Britain the influence of the reigning Tudor 
dynasty. On what other grounds are we to account, 
for example, for Spenser going out of his way to 
remind Elizabeth that she can boast of a genuine 
British ancestry, and that among her forebears is no 
less a person than the great King Arthur himself ? rn 
“Thy name, O soveraine Queene, thy realme and race 
From this renowned Prince derived arre, 
Who mightily upheld that royall mace 
Which now thou bear’st, to thee descended farre

From mighty kings and conquerours in ware, 
Thy fathers and great Grandfathers of old, 
Whose noble deeds above the Northern starre 
Jmmortall fame for ever hath enrold ; 
As in that old man’s booke they were in order told.” 
Here is a compliment of which Geoffrey, could he 
have foreseen it, would have been as proud as of his 
inclusion in Chaucer’s ‘Hous of Fame.’ To have 
been singled out for honour as one “ besy for to bere 
up Troy” was much; it was more to be quoted, 
by a poet no less illustrious, as an authority for the 
Arthurian descent of the greatest of British queens. 
The glorification of the House of Tudor, and of 
Elizabeth’s Welsh descent, is obvious enough in the 
lines in The Faerie Queene which refer to the 
“ sparke of fire ” that shall 
“ Bee freshly kindled in the fruitfull Te 
Of Mona, where it lurked in exile : 
Which shall breake forth into bright burning flame 
And reach into the house that bears the stile 
Of roiall majesty and soveraine name : 
So shall the Briton blood their crowne agayn reclame. 
Thenceforth eternal union shall be made 
Betweene the nations different afore.” 1 
In the second book of The Faerie Queene Spenser,

-P-A-G-E-130
  120 KING ARTHUR [cx. 
‘ following Geoffrey’s “‘auncient booke hight Briton 
moniments,”’ gives a versified —~ 
“chronicle of Briton kings 
From Brute to Uther’s rayne,” 
thus further emphasising the newly - discovered 
importance of early British history. The same 
patriotic fervour accounts for the production of 
such poems as William Warner’s Albion’s England 
and Michael Drayton’s Polyolbion. Warner is 
eminently practical, and, in his reproduction of 
Geoffrey’s Arthurian narrative, leaves out its more 
romantic incidents. Arthur's 
“ Scottish, Irish, Almaine, French and Saxone battelles 
got 
Yeeld fame sufficient: these seeme true, the reste 
I credite not.” 
Drayton is inclined to trust Geoffrey more im- 
plicitly, and even takes up the cudgels on his 
behalf against the critics who were then seeking 
to disparage him. The “adversary says,” writes 
Drayton, that ‘‘ Geoffrey Monmouth first our Brutus 
did devise,” whereas the fact is that 
“ pregnantly we prove, ere that historian’s days, 
A thousand-ling’ring years, our prophets clearly sung 
The Britain-founding Brute.” 1   
1 Polyolbion, Song X.
-P-A-G-E-131
  v.]| ARTHUR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE 121 
Drayton’s poem, so largely topographical as it is in 
its character, affords him many opportunities of mak- 
ing effective use of Arthurian traditions. “When he 
comes, for example, to the river Camel, he remembers 
that Arthur was born as well-as-slain in that tract of 
western country, 
“ As though no other place on Britain’s spacious earth 
Were worthy of his end, but where he had his birth.”1 
Again, referring to the songs of the ancient Britons, 
he tells us—much in Geoffrey’s manner—of Caerleon 
with 
“her temples and her groves, 
Her palaces and walls, baths, theatres, and stoves.” 
With all his garrulous “asides” and prosaic 
disquisitions, (Drayton’s Polyolbion is a well-in- 
tentioned poem, and. its sympathetic treatment of 
the legends entitles it to an honoured place in the 
Arthurian library.\ Like Caxton, [Drayton bewails 
the indifference British poets to the wealth of 
native tradition which lay ready for their use, and 
regrets that a British Homer had not been found to 
vise to “the height of its great argument 7 
“ For some abundant brain, oh, there had been a story, 
Beyond the blind man’s might to have enhanced our 
glory.”

) Although Elizabethan poets,\from patriotic and 
courtly motives, were so much interested in the early 
British legends as presented to them by the English 
chroniclers of their time,\it is somewhat strange 
at these legends)\and Arthurian story in particular, 
(aa not appeal strongly to the imagination of the 
playwrights of our greatest dramatic period.) [The 
only Arthurian drama of any consequence written 
during the Elizabethan period was The Misfortunes 
of Arthur by Thomas Hughes, which was acted 
before the Queen in February 1588; and the plot of 
that play is derived, in the main, not from Malory, but 
from Geoffrey.) In one important detail, however, 
Hughes departs from Geoffrey’s narrative, and, like 
many of the later romancers, represents Modred as 
Arthur’s son; and he is in touch with Malory in 
making-the tragedy of Arthur’s doom the nemesis 
that comes upon him for his sin. |The drama, as a 
whole, is a standard example of the Senecan type of 
tragedy, so much in vogue at the time of its produc- 
tion, and action and characterisation are altogether 
subordinated in it to narration.\ Some life, how- 
ever, is given to the characters of the two pro- 
tagonists, Arthur and Modred ; and the introduction 
of the ghost of Gorlois at the beginning and at the 
end of the play adds not a little to its general 
dramatic effect. In his final speech the Ghost, 
exulting over the ruin of the sinful house of Uther,

is made to pay an adroit compliment to Queen 
Elizabeth, 
“ That virtuous Virgo, born for Britain’s bliss, 
That peerless branch of Brute,” 
and gives utterance to the hope that she 
“ Shall of all wars compound eternal peace.” 
We are still without a great English drama based 
upon a theme drawn from Arthurian story; but 
what the Elizabethan dramatists, and most of their 
successors, rejected as either too unreal or too intract- 
able for their purposes, continued even down to the 
Victorian age to haunt and challenge the imagination 
of the poets. 
“The mightiest chiefs of British song 
Scorn’d not such legends to prolong ”!; 
and yet fre possess no great Arthurian epic in English 
verse any more than a drama. Milton and Dryden 
both cherished the ambition of writing one, but both, 
in different ways, found the pressure of circumstances 
too strong for the accomplishment of their design) 
When Milton, after the turmoil of the Civil Wars 
and his entanglement in public controversy, once 
more turned his attention to poetry, he had need of

higher argument for his long-projected ‘ heroic 
poem’ than 
“to dissect 
With long and tedious havoc fabl’d knights 
In battles feign’d.” 1 
Arthurian memories, however, lingered with him to 
the last, for even in Paradise Regained he cannot 
help referring to what once charmed him in stories 
“ Of fairy damsels met in forest wide 
By knights of Logres, or of Lyones, 
Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore.” 
Dryden, again, who had aspired to write an 
Arthuriad, as he tells us, “for the honour of his 
native country,” found himself obliged to turn to 
more immediately profitable forms of literature,— 
“being encouraged only with fair words by Charles 
II., my little salary ill-paid, and no prospect of a 
future subsistence.” ? But it is doubtful whether 
he was quite the kind of poet who, in Scott’s words, 
could 
“in immortal strain 
Have raised the Table Round again, 
But that a ribald King and Court 
Bade him toil on to make them sport.” 
Scott’s assumption, at any rate, is scarcely

justified by the character of{ the “dramatic opera ” 
called King Arthur, or the British Worthy, which 
Dryden composed shortly before Charles IT.’s ‘death. 
“This “opera” was written with a courtly, if not 
exactly a patriotic, motive; it was meant to be a 
glorification of King Charles’s public policy, but, 
unfortunately, Charles died before any performance 
of it could be given. It was produced on the stage, 
ultimately, in 1691,)to music by Purcell; but, [at 
that time, Willianf and Mary were the reigning 
sovereigns, so that the original point of the play was 
lost, and it had to be “improved” to suit the 
changed conditions of the day.) Thus, what Scott 
calls an “ingenious political drama” was turned 
into “a mere fairy tale’ without “any meaning 
beyond extravagant adventure.” 1! (The story of 
Arthur, also, is in many of its main features turned 
in this play into something very different from its 
familiar forms up to Dryden’s time. Several new 
characters are introduced into it, the most notable 
being a blind~ girl, Emmeline,—a creature of 
Dryden’s own invention,—\who, in defiance of all 
tradition and of Guinevere’s well-attested rights, 
becomes the wife of “ the British Worthy.”

romantic epic worthy of the Arthurian) or any other | 
similar theme. (A brave attempt, however, to achieve 
the impossible was made by “the City Bard or 
Knight Physician,” ! Sir Richard Blackmore, who in 
1695 published Prince Arthur, an Heroick Poem in 
Ten Books, and followed it up in 1697 with another 
‘epic,’ in twelve books, called King Arthur. These 
ponderous poems, written in heroic couplets, are 
really political allegories, in which Arthur stands 
for the Prince of Orange, and his Saxon enemy, 
Octa, for James the Second.) But they aim at 
being ‘epics’ as well. ) Supernatural ‘machinery,’ 
evidently suggested in many of its details by Para- 
dise Lost, is introduced, and just as the gods used 
to intervene in the struggles of the epic heroes of 
antiquity, so angels like Uriel and Raphael watch 
over the fortunes of Arthur. Indeed, the whole 
heavenly host befriends him, while Lucifer and the 
rebel angels are the patrons of his foes. Blackmore, 
whatever else may be said on his behalf, can claim 
to be at least faithful to the tradition which repre- 
sents Arthur as “the chief and best of the three 
Christian kings,” for he makes him the supreme 
champion of Christendom in his. day :— 
“This great deliverer sha]l Europa save, 
Which haughty monarchs labour to enslave ; 
  
1 Drvden so designates him in his Preface to the Fables, 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  y.]| ARTHUR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE 127 
Then shall Religion rear her starry head, 
And light divine through all the nations spread.” 1 
But, alas, who now reads Blackmore? The world 
generally is quite content not to know him, and 
ready to echo Dryden’s pious wish—“ peace be to the 
Manes of his Arthurs.” 
Blackmore, grotesque and even ludicrous though 
his methods are of allegorising the Arthurian stories, 
could, of course, claim high poetical sanction for this 
particular use of them. Spenser had, long before, 
“laboured to pourtraict in Arthure, before he was 
king, the image of a brave knight, perfected in the 
twelve private morall virtues, as Aristotle hath 
deyised,’’ ? and had also, though somewhat obscurely, 
sought to “shadow forth” in him “a modern 
gentleman ”’ of the Elizabethan court,—the Earl of 
Leicester. There is not much to choose between 
Leicester and William of Orange as “ modern ” types 
of Arthur, but(Spenser has, at least,(sueceeded in 
giving a romantic glamour to his poem)which helps 
us to forget its allegorical intent and takes us back 
to the legendary Arthur’s native “land of faerie.” 
So, in The Faerie Queene, Arthur appears in a role 
somewhat similar to that which he plays in the 
romances as the helper and deliverer of sorely-beset 
knights; and what the poet tells us about his

person, his prowess, and his accoutrements is, in 
spirit though not always in the letter, quite in 
accord with romantic tradition.) Delivered at birth 
to a faery knight, “ to be upbrought in gentle thewes 
and martiall might,’ he was put under the tutelage 
of Timon,! 
“ Old Timon, who in youthly yeares had beene 
In warlike feates th’ expertest man alive,” 
and who dwelt 
“Under the foot of Rauran mossy hore,” 
—the Merionethshire mountain, Yr Aran, where the 
river Dee has its source. “ Thither,”’ so Prince 
Arthur’s tale of his own history runs,—* 
“ Thither the great magician Merlin came, 
As was his use, oft-times to visit me ; 
For he had charge my discipline to frame | 
And Tutors nouriture to oversee.” \ 
It was Merlin 
“which whylome did excell 
All living wightes in might of magick spell,” 
who forged for Arthur his shield and sword and 
armour, Spenser, however, departs from the 
romancers in calling Arthur’s sword “ Morddure,”’ 3

and in stating, what is nowhere told of Excalibur, 
that it could not be 
“ forst his rightful owner to offend.” 
Nor do we hear in the romances of such marvellous 
details about the prince’s shield as those which 
Spenser gives; it was made of “ diamond perfect, 
pure and cleene,” and when Arthur chose to 
uncover it, 
“Men into stones therewith he could transmew, 
And stones to dust, and dust to nought at all ; 
And when him list the prouder lookes subdew, 
_ He would them gazing blind, or turne to other hew.” ! 
Spenser, again, finds none of the knights of the 
Round Table suitable for the main purposes of his 
allegory—the only prominent one who is brought 
into the poem is Tristram, and he is introduced 
/ only as quite a subordinate character. As the poet 
expressly tells us in his prefatory letter that his 
purpose is to “ pourtraict ’ Arthur “before he was 
king,” Che Faerie Queene, even had it been com- 
pleted, could hardly have contained any reference 
to the later, and more especially the tragic, features 
of Arthurian story. Neither did Spenser’s general 
design admit of any treatment of them. There 
could be no Guinevere in his poem, as Arthur was

destined at the end to marry Gloriana, the Fairy 
Queen, | in whom “iT mean Glory in my generali 
intention, but in my particular I conceive the 
most excellent and glorious person of our soveraine 
the Queene, and her kingdom in Faery land.¥ 
. There is indeed some excuse even for Black- 
more’s “particular intentions” in his egregious 
epics when we remember that a really great poet was 
capable of thus imagining Arthur, even in allegory, 
as the husband of Queen Elizabeth. 
The uses to which Spenser and Blackmore, each in 
his own way, put the Arthurian legends are not, after 
all, so dissimilar to those which underlie the most 
popular, and on the whole the most successful, 
poetical treatment of them in the nineteenth century.1 
The Idylls of the King have a palpably symbolical, 
not to say an allegorical, meaning, and “a message 
for the times.” It may be that in no other way 
“could any new life be infused into stories of which 
Swinburne says that “ their day is done,’— 
“Their records written of the winds, in foam 
Fly down the wind, and darkness takes them home.” 2 
At any rate, Tennyson frankly confesses that what 
he presents in his ‘Idylls’ is a 
“tale 
New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul ” ; 
  
1 See note G on p. 139. ? Dedication to his tragedy, ‘“ Locrine.”
-P-A-G-E-141
y.] ARTHUR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE 131 
  and the new element in it is a didactic purpose suited 
to the moral and sentimental temper of the Victorian 
era, and embodying what a severe critic calls “ the 
ethics of the rectory parlour.” ! Tennyson himself 
is responsible for revealing the “particular inten- 
tion ’ which equates the Arthur of the ‘ Idylls’ with 
the Prince Consort ; for he dedicates the poems to 
his memory, “ 
* since he held them dear, 
Perchance as finding there unconsciously 
Some image of himself.” 
fe is hardly likely, however, that Tennyson, when he 
rst thought of the Arthurian stories as a poetic 
theme, had any very definite idea of putting 
them into the form of an allegory such as most 
of his interpreters now discover in them but that 
he, from the first, intended a “‘ modern meaning ” 
is plain from the lines appended to the Morte 
D’ Arthur at the time of its original publication,— 
“To me, methought, who waited in a crowd, 
There came a bark that, blowing forward, bore 
King Arthur, like a modern gentleman 
Of stateliest port ; and all the people cried 
‘ Arthur is come again : he cannot die.’ ” 
That the ‘Idylls,’ when finally completed and

Book’ ”’). 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
132 KING ARTHUR [ox. 
put into their present order, had “ an allegorical or 
perhaps a parabolic drift,” in them, is certain, for 
the words quoted are Tennyson’s own.!_ Tennyson, 
however, complains that critics had “taken his 
hobby and ridden it too hard, and have explained 
some things too allegorically.” (‘‘ The general drift 
of the ‘Idylls,’” he continues, “is clear enough. 
‘The whole... is the dream of man coming into 
practical life and ruined by one sin. Birth is_a_. 
mystery and death is a mystery, and in the midst 
lies the tableland_of_ life.’ ep) Modern though this 
“drift”? may be, it is perennial and universal 
enough in its appeal to save the ‘ Idylls ’— 
notwithstanding the references to the ‘‘ modern 
gentleman ” and the Prince Consort—from being 
a merely Victorian poem, or series of poems. 
They do not, together, constitute an Arthuriad : 
they are not-meant to represent “ the epic, some 
twelve books ” with “ faint Homeric echoes ” which 
Tennyson may have been meditating in his earlier 
years when he published his Morte D’Arthur. 
“He produced no epic; only a series of epic idyllia. 
He had a spiritual conception, ‘an allegory in the 
distance,’ an-allegory not to be insisted upon, though 
its presence ‘was to be felt. No longer, as in youth, 
did Tennyson intend Merlin to symbolise ‘the 
sceptical understanding,’ or poor Guinevere to stand

for the Blessed Reformation, or the Table Round 
for Liberal Institutions. Mercifully Tennyson never 
actually allegorised Arthur in that fashion.” * 
'Tennyson’s King Arthur is certainly modern 
enough in sentiment and speech, but the position 
which he holds in the ‘ Idylls’ is, in many ways, in 
harmony with that which he occupies in history and 
-romantic legend. )Tennyson himself warns his readers 
that they must not expect to find in the ‘ Idylls’ 
. “that gray king whose name, a ghost, 
Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain peak, 
And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still ; or him 
Of Geoffrey’s book, or him of Malleor’s.” 
Rather they ought to discern in him 
“ Tdeal manhood closed in real man.” 
All the same, Tennyson’s pre-occupation with 
‘ideal manhood ”’ did not prevent him from bestow- 
ing painful labour upon knowing the “ real man,” 
so far as the records, historical and romantic, reveal 
him ; and (one of the outstanding features of The 
Idylis of the King is their remarkable fidelity to 
the details of Arthurian story as given in its time- 
honoured literary soiipooey “ Geoffrey’s book,” and 
“ Malleor’s,” had been carefully studied by the poet,

Writers”), p. 103.

134 KING ARTHUR [cn. 
and he had even been at pains to garner all he could 
from early Welsh poetry and from the Mabinogion, 
as presented in Lady Charlotte Guest’s charming 
translation. CQWhile Malory is their main source, the 
‘Tdylls’ contain much that shows how familiar 
Tennyson was with Arthurian lore generally in its 
most primitive forms.) The story of Geraint, for 
example, as told by him, follows closely the Welsh 
version of it given by Lady Charlotte Guest.! 
Again, the description of Britain in the opening linés 
of The Coming of Arthur as a country where each 
“petty king’ was ever waging war upon some 
other, and where the children “‘ grew up to wolf-like — 
men, worse than the wolves,” until     “ King Leodogran 
Groan’d for the Roman legions here again,” 
recalls vividly the bitter lamentations of Gildas over 
the degeneracy of his countrymen. The account 
which Lancelot gives of Arthur’s wars in Lancelot 
and Elaine is an expansion of the record in Nennius 
of the twelve Arthurian battles. And Tennyson’s 
general conception of Arthur as the flower of kings 
who 
“ Drew all the petty princedoms under him,” 
and “made a realm” in Britain, is far more in 
1 How closely it does follow the Welsh tale has well been pointed 
out by Mr A. Lang in the work just quoted, from pp. 119 sqq.

keeping with that of the early chroniclers than with 
the picture given of him in the later romances, 
But it is not in such incidental features alone 
that the ‘Idylls’ are true to the older Arthurian 
tradition. Modern in their sentiment and ethics 
though they may be, Tennyson’s main purpose in 
them of “shadowing Sense at war with Soul” is 
not altogether unjustified by the general tftceuay 
history of the legends. (Malory, at any rate, had 
some such purpose, for Caxton assures—us that the 
Morte Darthur was “written for our doctrine, and 
for to beware that we fall not to vice nor sin, 
but to exercise and follow virtue.”’ ‘‘ In Malory’s 
compilation, and in later medieval romance, the fate 
of Arthur means the fate of the chivalrous ideal, 
_ whose irreconcilable elements were incorporated 
in him. In_the romantic historians the fate of 
Arthur is the fate of the Christian Britons in conflict 
with heathenism from without and _ treason from 
within. \ Even in the old myths, his fate, if we may 
} trust Professor Rhys, is the fate of the culture-hero 
combined with Father Sky, in conflict with the 
powers of Darkness and the Nether-world. It was 
by a true inspiration that Tennyson was drawn to the 
old legends, and reading into them his secret found 
it to be their own... Accordingly, this identity of 
feeling with his predecessors kept Tennyson on the 
track of the story... . Thug the ‘Idylls ’ are both 
os 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
truer to the authorities and nearer our own feelings 
than any other of the adaptations of Arthurian 
story. ) Though the adventures are now regarded 
from & modern point of view, this point of view is 
in the same spiritual watch-tower from which the 
framers of the legend looked: but it is the plat- 
form at the top, not a loop-hole on the winding 
stair.”’ 1 
After all, however much the ‘Idylls’ may be 
cavilled at on the score of their modern sentiment 
and occasional homiletic strain, their general setting 
and atmosphere are genuinely romantic and in 
thorough keeping with the far-off things of which 
they sing. Tennyson is true enough to his sources 
in his descriptions of scenery and in his entire survey 
of the traditional Arthurian country. “It is no 
land dwelt in by bold bad men we see, when Arthur 
rides through the mountains and finds the diamonds ; 
when Geraint and Enid go through the green gloom 
of the wood; when Galahad rides over the black 
swamp, leaping from bridge to bridge till he sail to 
the spiritual city ; when Lancelot drives through the 
storm to the enchanted towers of Carbonek seven 
days across the sea.” In none of the ‘Idylls’ 
do we perhaps breathe more of the atmosphere 
of pure romance than in the first and the last.

v.] ARTHUR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE 137 
Mystery and magic surround both the coming and 
the passing of the King ; 
“ From the great deep to the great deep he goes.” 
This “weird rhyme” of Merlin’s comes into 
Bedivere’s memory as he sees the barge with the 
three dark Queens bearing Arthur away into the 
“distance 
“¢ill the hull 
Look’d one black dot against the verge of dawn.” 
And the last scene closes with the faithful Bedivere 
left wondering whether Arthur will ‘“‘ come again,” 
and whether, “if he come no more,” the three 
~ Queens who bore him away be “ friends of Arthur, 
who should help him at his need ?’”’ So, Tennyson, 
like Malory and the romancers, leaves Arthur’s 
“return”? an open_question; but Bedivere goes 
away comforted by what seemed an assurance that 
“all was well ” with Arthur whither he had gone. 
“Then from the dawn it seem’d there came, but faint 
As from beyond the limit of the world, 
Like the last echo born of a great cry, 
Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice 
Around a king returning from his wars.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
ADDITIONAL NOTES 
Note A, p. 9.—The Grail and the Round Table, as originally drawn 
into Arthurian story, were in all probability survivals of features 
in old Celtic nature-worship. 
Note B, p. 26.—Cavall, it may be noted, is referred to in the Welsh 
romance Geraint, Son of Erbin, as taking part in a stag-hunt under 
the leadership of Arthur, and is there called “ Arthur’s darling dog” 
(annwylgi Arthur). 
Note OC, p. 94.—Argante—afterwards known as Morgain, or Morgan, 
la fée or le fay—is first heard of, in literature, in the poem called 
Vita Merlini, commonly, dated 1148 and ascribed to Geoffrey of 
Monmouth (see p. 112), She there-appears-as.amaiden; possessed 
of magic powers, who heals Arthur’s wounds after the battle of 
Camlan. Although-she~is~usually-spokenof by the romancers as 
being-Arthur’s_sister, she is also represented as one who hates, and 
is involved in certain malign schemes against, him. [Her place in 
Arthurian story is one of the many points at which the records and 
popular legends of “the British King ” touch the borders of fairy- 
land. ) The fairy element in Arthurian romance is a fascinating, 
albeit. intricate, subject of study, but the scope and purpose of this 
little book allow only the briefest references to it. Those who are 
interested in the subject will find a very full, and suggestive, treatment 
of it in Studies in the Fairy Mythology of Arthurian Romance, by Lucy 
A. Paton (Radcliffe College Monographs, Boston, U.S.A., 1903). 
Note D, p. 101.—Chrétien himself, in the opening lines of Cligés, 
states that he had written of “‘le roi Mare et Iseut la blonde.” 
138 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
ADDITIONAL NOTES 139 
Note E, p. 105.—Tristram, or Tristan, is the most accomplished of 
all the heroes who are associated with Arthur. In the romances he 
is pre-eminent as hunter, horseman, linguist, musician, harp-player- 
He is also a liar of infinite resource. 
Note F, p. 115.—Malory, it should be said, is indebted for some 
of his most picturesque touches in his account of the passing of 
Arthur and of other incidents to an unknown English poet who, 
probably in the fourteenth century, composed a metrical Le Morte 
Arthure. As the first edition of the present book has been accused 
of having done “ grave injustice to our vernacular Arthurian litera- 
ture before Malory” through failure to recognise the merits of 
“ the unknown but most true poet whose rightful laurels have so long 
been worn by the prose writer,” an extract from the poem may be 
given in order to enable the reader to judge to which of the two, 
from a purely literary point of view, the “rightful laurels” ought 
to belong. Here is the poet’s account of the flinging of Excalibur :— 
“The knyght was bothe hende and free ; 
To save that swerd he was fulle glad, 
And thought, whethyr it better bee 
‘Yif neuyr man it after had ; 
An I it caste in to the see, 
Off mold was neuyr man so mad. 
The swerd he hyd undyr a tree, 
And sayd, ‘ syr, I ded as ye me bad.’ 
‘What saw thow there ?’ than sayd the kynge, 
*Telle me now, yiff thow can ;’ 
*Sertes, syr,’ he said, ‘ nothynge 
But watres depe, and waives wanne,’ 
“A, now thou haste broke my byddynge! 
Why hast thou do so, thow false man ? 
Another bode thou muste me brynge,” ete. 
Note G, p. 130.—It would be impossible, within the limits of such 
a book as this, to pass in review all the English Arthurian literature 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
140 KING ARTHUR 
of the nineteenth century. William Morrls’s Defence of Guinevere, 
King Arthur’s Tomb, and other Arthurian poems doubtless breathe 
much more of the primitive romantic spirit of the legends than 
Tennyson’s Idylls, but they are but slight experiments in com- 
parison with Tennyson’s elaborate design. Then there are other 
works like Heber’s Morte Arthur, Lytton’s King Arthur, and Hawker 
of Morwenstow’s Quest of the Sangreal, which claim a place in any 
full survey of modern Arthurian literature, but are hardly of 
sufficient importance to have required notice in so brief a chapter 
as the last had, necessarily, to be.

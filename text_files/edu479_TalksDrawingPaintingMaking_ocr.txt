INTRODUCTION 
This book is meant to be a friend, just a com- 
panionable friend, to Primary Teachers—one to whom 
they may go for help; one perchance with whom they 
may occasionally differ, but only as friends differ, to 
come together again. 
There is no fixed and unvarying method for teach- 
ing a child to draw, paint, model, or construct. He 
who would attempt to furnish such might indeed, 
teach him to handle pencil, brush, scissors, or clay 
with considerable deftness and precision, but with 
results bearing the stamp in a large degree of mere 
cleverness and skill in mimicry. Meantime, the happy ° 
years of childhood would have slipped away and little 
would have been added to the child’s vividness of 
imagination, his quickness and accuracy of observa~- 
tion, and his power of expression and creation. 
The book is chiefly a record of experiences, a com- 
pilation of good things done by teachers here and 
there which are worth bringing together and carrying 
to all others whose opportunities perhaps have been 
more limited. While the writer’s own experience as 
a director and teacher of drawing for several years 
has been drawn upon, the contents of the book have 
been determined largely by her observation of the 
work done by other. teachers located in many schools 
and many cities. For this reason it is believed the 
5

  6 INTRODUCTION   
material here furnished will be helpful to primary 
teachers everywhere irrespective of local conditions. 
In those cities and towns where the grade teachers 
have the inspiration and the helpful criticism and direc- 
tion of a Supervisor of Drawing, the book should serve 
a useful purpose in supplementing the directions of 
the Supervisor. In schools where teachers are doing 
the drawing and construction work without the guid- 
ance of a Supervisor, it should easily suggest enough 
definite, suitable, and interesting exercises in drawing, 
making, and decorating to cover at least the First and 
Second Primary Years. It is believed, in fact, that 
the book will furnish a fairly complete course in the 
work for any primary teacher who is forced to draw 
upon her own resources in teaching the subject. 
No teacher will be compelled to take a course 
in Pedagogy and Psychology in order to understand 
and use this book. In a manner which we hope will 
be found clear, direct, and pleasing it makes plain 
what may be done in the various subjects and how 
to do it. While a trained and experienced teacher 
may possibly get more out of it than any other, it is 
designed to carry a helpful message to the teacher of 
more limited experience and training. It will at least 
carry to all in simplest terms the results of approved 
experience in selection and in method, suggesting 
‘through the typical exercises presented under each 
subject a great variety of related exercises, limited only 
by the discrimination, the ingenuity, and the resource- 
fulness of the teacher.  
-P-A-G-E-11
  INTRODUCTION 7   
While the book is non-technical in the educational 
and art sense, the writer is confident it will be found 
sound in all the essential principles which underlie 
form expression of whatever kind, whether practised 
by primary or upper grade pupils or by the adult. 
It aims to make the child’s first crude efforts as 
purposeful as his later and more formal ones—to 
create standards, to encourage originality and 
invention, to cultivate freedom along with exactness, 
to develop seeing power and skill of hand, and to 
help the pupil sense the quality of beauty in the 
useful thing. M 
A special feature has been made of the illustra- 
tions of which there are many, covering every impor- 
tant point in the text. These, with few exceptions, 
have been placed in the margin and as near the text 
reference as possible for the convenience of the teacher. 
They are not used in the book as examples of 
technique, but almost entirely to make clear the 
points covered by the text, and to guard against any 
possible misinterpretation. 
Another feature of the book which will undoubt- 
edly appeal to teachers, is the large number of repro- 
ductions of pupils’ work which appear on its pages. 
There are many of these distributed throughout the 
book under the various subjects treated. The originals 
were selected from many schools and not only serve 
an admirable purpose in illustrating text points but 
afford an excellent basis for comparison and for meas- 
uring local results.
-P-A-G-E-12
  8 INTRODUCTION   
It may be noted that the subject of landscape has 
been omitted from the book. ‘This omission is due to 
a growing tendency to teach landscape in connection 
with illustrative work. If the teacher is telling the 
children a story of boys flying their kites out in the 
green fields beneath the blue sky, it is not drawing 
from imagination alone when they try to picture the 
scene. It is landscape drawing as well. The same 
thing is true when they try to picture the Hans Ander- 
sen story of the “Snow Man.” ‘The children are 
intensely interested in having their pictures show how 
winter looks with its cold gray sky, bare trees, and 
white ground. When drawing from imagination is 
carried on in this way, the children cannot fail to 
learn many things which will prepare them for the 
actual study of landscape later. 
To all who have assisted me in the preparation 
of this book by furnishing materials for illustration 
and otherwise, and especially to Mrs. M. E. Riley, 
Supervisor of Drawing, St. Louis, Mrs. Ida Hood 
Clark, Director of Elementary Manual Training, Mil- 
waukee, Miss Emelia M. Goldsworthy, Art. Instructor, 
Western State Normal School, Kalamazoo, Michigan, 
and to Miss Jessie Buckner, Art Instructor, Western 
State Normal School, Macomb, Illinois, I wish to 
make grateful acknowledgment of my obligation. 
In closing, the author wishes to express the hope 
that the teachers will share with the children the joy 
which comes from such work as this book contains 
and suggests. ‘To none of the great family of grown-
-P-A-G-E-13

up children has it been granted in larger degree to 
keep the heart childlike than to the Primary Teacher. 
“The happiest heart is childlike, 
It never quite grows old. 
It sees the sunset’s splendor 
As it saw the dawning gold. 
It has a gift for gladness, 
Its dreams die not away, 
‘Oh what a foolish happy heart’ 
The worldlier people say.”

I. DRAWING FROM IMAGINATION 
If imaginative drawing were taught with the same * 
system, and persistence through all_the gra S as is 
the language work, the pupil would leave school with 
as much command over the one means of expression as 
the other, for drawing is as natural at least to, the child 
as writing and is used by him much earlier. It is not 
necessary to wait until the pupil is supplied with the 
regulation paper and drawing pencil before beginning 
the lessons, for his ordinary pad and pencil may be 
made to do service in this story-telling work, if nothing 
else is available. Drawing from imagination for story 
telling or illustration is the easiest step to take in going 
from the child’s hitherto unguided home efforts to 
the carefully planned work of the schoolroom. 
The drawings of primitive races were mere symbols,y 
and it was long ago discovered that the child repeats, 
in a measure, in his own unguided drawing, the graphic 
expression of these races. In the mind of every child 
there seem to be certain symbols which stand for the 
objects which he tries to represent, and the primary 
teacher, whether in Maine, California, Minnesota, or 
Texas, will find that the first imaginative drawings 
show the use of almost the same symbols. } Men and 
ll
-P-A-G-E-16

boys are almost invariably pictured in this manner 
(Fig. 1), while the women and girls are rendered some- 
thing like Fig. 2, with lines added to suggest a skirt, 
and variation in style of head-dress. The X-Ray 
effect of this drawing as shown in the girl’s skirt is 
quite common in the drawings of children. “Every 
teacher is familiar with the pictures of houses which 
= show not only the outside of them, but the furniture 
ey within. However, children like to draw, and it should 
ae ZS be the effort of the teacher to preserve this spontaneity 
ae and enthusiasm while she gradually develops the power 
\ of observation and consequently the power to express 
a ee with more consistency and truth. (Creative imagina- 
1 (inks is the common factor in all studies,” and every 
effort made by the pupil in illustrative drawing should 
serve to stimulate the imagination and quicken the 
observation-and memory. 
The teacher should select stories which are full of 
interest to the children, and these stories should deal 
with objects, incidents, and scenes with which the 
children are familiar, through actual contact or par- 
ticipation, or by having seen them frequently pictured, 
so that a mental image has been formed.\ For instance, 
the story of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears’’ is 
intensely interesting to children, but, until the advent 
of the Teddy Bear, it is doubtful whether children 
could illustrate it as effectively as now, having had 
previously on'y a vague notion of the appearance of a 
bear. Now, however, it may be numbered among the 
  really good stories for child picturing. 
  SELECTING 
STORIES 
 
-P-A-G-E-17

  DRAWING FROM IMAGINATION 13   
We have seen a wonderfully good set of drawings 
based on this story. Before drawing, each scene was 
represented by using a doll to impersonate Goldilocks, 
and Teddy Bears of various sizes for the real bears, 
while boxes served to represent chairs and beds. The 
delight of the children was evident. They were allowed 
to discuss the scenes after looking at them. The 
objects were then covered and the pictures were made. 
The results were a credit to the children, for, crude as 
were the pictures, they were full of spirit and action. 
It is admitted that this method makes the drawing to 
a certain extent an act of memory. 
If pictures are utilized in an illustrative lesson, 
there should be several instead of one. For instance, 
if children are shown a picture of “Red Riding Hood 
and the Wolf” before illustrating that story, the 
chances are every paper will show that particular Red — 
Riding Hood and that particular Wolf. In fact, the 
drawings will show little creative imagination on the 
part of the children. hey have simply «copied the 
picture type in so far as they are able to copy. 
Before attempting to picture this story again, it is 
suggested that the teacher make a collection of wolf 
pictures, cutting them from magazines, posters, or 
newspapers, and mounting on cardboard. ‘Tell the 
story as graphically as possible and then talk about 
wolves—what they look like, where and how they 
live, ete., showing the pictures as you talk. Then, 
if the pictures be put out of sight, it will be 
found that the story pictures made by the children   
 
-P-A-G-E-18
    14 TALKS ON DRAWING 
show they have made .a good step beyond mere 
copying. 
Do not ask children to illustrate stories which 
require the drawing of gods, goddesses, or other 
supernatural beings, for although the average child will 
undertake anything, the results cannot fail to be de- 
pressing even when viewed with his childish eyes. The 
writer once visited a room when the teacher was telling 
the story of the ““Nine Muses,” and the poor children 
were immersed in gloom trying to picture them on 
paper. At Easter Time she saw children in another 
room trying to picture the story of the resurrection with 
the angel at the tomb. At first it seemed monstrously 
sacrilegious, but the children were so serious that one 
could readily see they did not feel it to be so. It was 
pitiful to see them attempt a subject which only two or 
three of the world’s greatest artists have essayed. The 
tension of feeling was much lessened when one little 
fellow said confidentially, as she passed his desk, ““ Mine 
is an awfully wild Indian-looking angel. I guess I'll 
put him behind a cloud, and that'll fix him, He can 
just be peeking out.” The accompanying reproduction 
(Fig. 3) shows how his drawing appeared after it was 
“fixed.” 
Much depends upon. the selection of seasonable 
stories, for the children throw all of their enthusiasm 
into illustrating the thing which fills their hearts and 
minds} We knew a teacher who tested a class by 
telling the Santa Claus story on a warm May day.

done such a thing often would surely have been 
most detrimental both_to the children and to their 
illustrative drawing. | Use the material which comes to 
Ea while it is fresh. [it the band passes the school, 
let the children go to the windows and watch as well as 
listen.| ‘“‘How does the drum major dress? How does 
he walk? What does he do? See the fellow blowing 
the big horn! ete.” | When they take their seats let the 
children draw pictures to show how the band looked. 
Do not wait until the regular drawing period. Let - 
pupils draw while the picture is fresh in their minds, and 
the results will justify the slight inconvenience caused 
by varying the daily program?) The pictures shown in 
Plates A, B, E, F were drawn while the chi'dren 
were still full of excitement over a fire in the neighbor- 
hood. *’The drawings were made in two widely sepa- 
rated cities. In one case the work was done with brush 
and ink, while in the other, colored crayons were used. 
Notice how full of spirit and action the crude little 
pictures are. A circus in town furnishes an oppor- 
tunity for a fine drawing lesson. It is interesting to 
note the variety in the pictures here shown (Plates A 
and E), but although the interpretations were many 
and varied, one feels that the children worked with a 
joy and enthusiasm which few other subjects could 
have elicited. i 
The child is at first satisfied with very crude results). 
and his figures are almost entirely devoid of action. \ \

which says of the little old woman, “She ran and she 
ran and she ran, but she couldn’t catch the ginger- 
bread man.” When you inspect the drawings, you will 
be surprised to find that hardly a child has shown any 
action in either the gingerbread man or the old lady. 
The children have shown the old lady’s sunbonnet, her 
checked apron and her spectacles, for children love 
detail (Fig. 4), but the old lady herself stands placidly 
on her side of the paper and the gingerbread man 
on his. The next day or on the occasion of the next 
lesson, dress a little girl in sunbonnet and apron and 
let her run back and forth before the children, or 
around the room, while the children watch the action 
of her body and the position of her arms. Have them 
try to draw a girl running. Then try the story again 
and you will find that some of the children at least 
have sensed and expressed the idea of motion (Fig. 5), 
and although the old lady’s proportions leave much 
to be desired, the drawings will show more or less 
successful effort to represent action. This dramati- 
zation of stories may be made most helpful and 
should be practiced whenever possible. Knowledge 
gained in pose drawing will also find its application 
here. 
The story of the little bird that carried straw to 
build a nest in the tree brings in problems of proportion 
which lead to trouble. Plainly, the bird is the impor- 
tant factor in the story, and should be given due promi-

(Fig. 6), for the drawing paper has fixed dimensions, 
and the bird and straw leave little room for the tree. 
When the children are studying trees in connection 
with their nature work, or are making drawings from 
the schoolroom windows to show how the different 
trees look, or how they tell the story of “nearness and 
farness,”’ let the illustrative work include the drawing 
of trees. The story of ‘The Discontented Fir Tree”’ 
is familiar to all lovers of Andersen’s Tales and is a 
fine winter story. The fable of the man who went 
through the woods hunting for the pot of gold is good. 
Every teacher can find or recall a dozen equally suit- 
able stories. 
Costume poses add great zest to the story. Cos- 
tumes need not be pretentious to satisfy the children. 
A paper crown is all that is needed to transform a boy 
into a king; a cap and a kerchief make a pilgrim maiden 
of a girl, while only a large hat, a cane with a crooked 
handle and perhaps a toy sheep will create a “ Bopeep.””_ 
Long stories may be broken into several parts or > 
steps so as to furnish several pictures. If too much is 
told at one time, the child cannot grasp it, and no one 
picture is imaged clearly in his mind. He is confused 
by a number of images. It is better to tell such stories 
in installments. There is no story in the English lan- 
guage better adapted for illustrative purposes in the 
schoolroom than “ Johnny Look-in-the-air.”” It is most 
interesting because it deals with familiar objects, and is 
full of dramatic action and incident. It should, how-/ 
ever, be separated into at least four parts and made to

furnish material for several lessons. Here is the poem, 
and the accompanying drawings (Plates C and D), 
made by second grade children, show with what interest 
they interpreted the story of the poem. 
JOHNNY LOOK-IN-THE-AIR 
I 
As he trudged along to school, 
It was always Johnny’s rule 
To be looking at the sky 
And the clouds that floated by; 
But what just before him lay. 
In his way, 
Johnny never thought about; 
So that everyone cried out,— 
“Look at little Johnny there! 
Little Johnny Look-in-the-air.” 
II 
Running just in Johnny’s way 
Came a little dog one day; 
Johnny’s eyes were still astray 
Up high in the sky, 
And he never heard them cry,— 
“Johnny, mind, the dog is nigh!’’ 
What happens now ? 
Bump! 
Dump! 
Down they fell with such a thump 
Dog and Johnny in a lump! 
They almost broke their bones, 
So hard they tumbled on the stones. 
1 
Once with head as high as ever, 
Johnny walked beside the river, 
Johnny watched the swallows trying 
Which was cleverest at flying.

Oh! What fun! 
Johnny watched the bright round sun, 
Going in and coming out, 
This was all he thought about, 
So he strode on, only think! 
To the river’s very brink, 
Where the bank was high and steep, 
And the water very deep; 
And three fishes in a row, 
Stared to see him coming so. 
IV 
One step more! oh! sad to tell! 
Headlong in poor Johnny fell. 
The three little fishes in dismay 
Wagged their heads and swam away. 
But as they were passing by 
Two strong men had heard him cry; 
And with sticks these two strong men 
Hooked poor Johnny out again. 
Oh! you should have seen him shiver 
When they pulled him from the river. 
He was in a sorry plight, 
Dripping wet, and such a fright! 
Wet all over, everywhere, 
Clothes, and arms, and face, and hair, 
Johnny never will forget 
What it is to be so wet. 
And the fishes, one, two, three, - 
Are come back again, you see; 
Up they came the moment after 
To enjoy the fun and laughter, 
Each popped out his little head 
And to tease poor Johnny, said, 
“Silly little Johnny, look! 
You have lost your writing book.” 
Look at them laughing, and do you see 
His writing book drifting far to sea?

is lost, but the essential nature of the drawings remains. 
Notice the attitude of Johnny in Scene I. The first 
effort shows no action and is much like the symbol 
drawing referred to at the beginning of this chapter. 
By letting a small boy impersonate Johnny by walking 
with upturned head, the children were able to get the 
effect of action. Scene II was also dramatized, one 
little fellow on “all fours’’ playing dog while he and 
Johnny acted out the lines. Notice in Scene III 
the variety of positions in which Johnny is portrayed. 
One of the children has kept the hero’s head “right 
side up with care,” while inverting the body. The 
effect is surely grotesque. Scene IV is particularly 
interesting, showing as it does the various methods of 
rescue which occurred to the children. 
In cities where the best illustrative drawing is done, 
it is not done haphazardly but according to a definite 
plan. For instance, in one city visited, no attempt is 
made to show perspective in the street scenes of the 
First and Second Grades, but the drawings plainly 
showed that the children were in no way hampered by 
this way of working. Many stories involving street 
pictures may be told to the children, for in a city, 
buildings and streets constitute much of the child’s 
environment. “The Pied Piper of Hamelin” is one of 
the favorites of the children. The following “Points IMPOR-

  HELPING How much help should be given to the children is 
Sie nee a question often raised by the teacher. Many a class 
of bright, imaginative children has been made, wholly 
    dependent upon the teacher by too much help. It has 
been demonstrated that the teacher should never pat —~ 
her own idea of the picture6n the chalkboard to serve 
as a guide for the children. It is proper for her to 
show the children how to draw trees in the mass((Fig. 
7), and not as in Fig. 8;/that she should lead the chil- 
dren to observe and to express distant foliage as it 
appears against the horizon| (Fig. 9), ete. In giving 
such help to the children, she is giving them a vocabu- 
lary by which to express themselves, just as she does in 
language work. ‘lo tell a story and then to illustrat

just before the lesson puts the children into the spirit 
of the story. For instance, before illustrating a soldier 
story, let the children march around the room singing 
some patriotic song, or before illustrating “A Windy 
Day,” let them sing one of those charming songs telling 
of the pranks of the wind. Every teacher has access 
to such songs, and in many ways the music and draw- 
ing may be made helpful to one another. The drawing 
of some object is often a help in preparing for the 
illustration of a story. Before illustrating “There Was 
an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe,”’ let the children 
bring old shoes to school and have a drawing lesson 
from them. ‘The next day when you tell them the story, 
you will find that the object drawing was good prepara-

most ridiculous drawings of the children should never 
make a teacher forget this, although many have been 
known to carry some of the drawings home for the very 
humor of them. Draw out the child’s opinion of his 
own effort. Give a word of praise, if possible, remem- 
bering that children are especially susceptible to this. 
“The love of praise, howe’er concealed by art 
Reigns more or less, and glows in every heart.” 
We once heard a teacher tell the story of the “Bell 
of Atri,” so well known to Longfellow’s readers. She 
was telling it in installments, as the story contains 
material for a dozen lessons. ‘The children were in- 
tensely interested in that part of the poem which told 
of the hungry old horse tugging at the rope of the 
village bell. They were depicting that incident with an 
interest which was good to see. The teacher inspecting 
the work came to a discouraged boy whose horse could 
be identified only by its tail. As she came down the 
aisle, he covered his horse with a smudgy hand, but 
she asked to see it. Instead of saying, “Mercy! What 
in the world is that ?”’ she said, “ What a fine tail your 
horse has! Surely, a boy who can draw a horse’s tail 
like that will be able to draw a good horse some day.” 
There was a horse hitched to a delivery wagon across 
the street. She took the boy to the window and called 
his attention to the shape of the horse’s head, the way 
his neck arched, etc. She asked him to look at pictures 
of horses and to draw from a real horse at home. 
He came back to his seat-looking very important and

happy because his horse had such a fine tail. The 
accompanying illustration (Fig. 10) shows the picture 
the boy drew for her after he had studied horses. The 
horse would not be taken for a thoroughbred, but it 
represents the earnest loving efforts of a little lad who 
‘ wanted to “make good.” It is not necessary that the 
teacher perjure herself by giving undue praise, for 
children are easily satisfied. 
Every teacher can select stories for illustration 
better than another can do it for her. She knows her 
own conditions and the peculiar interests and activities 
of the community in which she teaches. The following 
list, however, may be helpful: 
The Mother Goose Rhymes. 
Some of Edward Lear’s Nonsense Rhymes. 
Many of Andersen’s stories, pein ly 
The Proud Teapot, 
The Ugly Duckling, 
The Snow Man.

“How soon can a child begin painting flowers or 
other plant forms?’ is a question often asked. The 
answer is simple. He can begin as soon as the propery 
materials are placed in his hands. Many teachers hold 
that all his earlier work in drawing should be done 
with the brush either in color or in ink, color prefer- 
ably; while others believe in the use of pencil or char- 
coal. Certain it is that the rich glowing colors of the 
autumn months offer material which cannot be sur- 
passed for training the color sense of young children. 
It is not necessary or advisable to wait until the 
children have learned how to paint flat washes before 
allowing them to attempt simple grasses and flowers, 
although a lesson should be given on the distribution 
‘and collection of materials before any painting is done, 
The chapter on the Care and Distribution of Materials 
should be carefully read before taking up the water 
color work. 
Choose flowers of pronounced and brilliant color 
rather than those showing more delicate and subtle 
coloring. If you are a California teacher, you have a 
-score of gay flowers, including the scarlet poinsettia 
and yellow poppy, unknown to the children of the 
East or South. Texas children have the wonderful 
thistles, showing every tone of reddish purple, and the 
Mexican morning-glory whose intense blue has no equal 
25

elsewhere for brightness. Nasturtiums, zenias, sun- 
flowers, flowering beans, salvia, and autumn leaves 
upon the twig are all excellent. 
The flowers may be cut the evening before they are 
to be used, in which case the stems should be plunged 
into water almost up to the blossom. If this is done, 
they will remain crisp and fresh and will not wilt and 
droop during the lesson. Every teacher remembers 
the short-stemmed, bedraggled little specimens, almost 
useless as working ma’erial, which her children have 
brought to school in response to her request for flowers 
to paint. One lesson from flowers, which have been 
carefully selected and properly cared for, is worth more 
than a half dozen from forlorn, wilted specimens. 
A set of tumblers, old cups, or large bottles, nearly 
filled with sand, should form an important part of the 
teacher’s drawing outfit for the room. Before giving a 
lesson, the sand should be moistened and the flower 
stems stuck in the sand. ‘The tumblers, cups, etc., 
should then be placed on desk boards. See diagram 
on Page 135. ‘The sand not only holds the stems firmly 
in the desired position but gives enough weight to 
prevent possible accidents by overturning. The flowers 
may be seen more easily if placed in front of a plain 
backgrounds— By joining two pieces of white paste- 
board with a cloth hinge, a useful “shadow box’? may 
be made, and a set of these backgrounds should form 
part of the permanent equipment of every teacher. 
They are very easily made and extremely helpful. These 
shadow boxes may be used as shown in Figs. 1 and 2,

and if the specimen to be drawn is a dry twig, needing 
no water, or a bit of drooping vine, the shadow box 
may be used as an easel upon which to pin the study, 
as shown in Fig. 3. When the plant specimens are 
large like sunflowers, cannas, cattails, etc., a single 
specimen properly placed is sufficient for any school- 
room of ordinary size. It may be placed in a large 
jar on the teacher’s desk, and if a plain background 
is placed behind it, the form may be seen easily by 
every child. 
Green grasses or sedges furnish the best material 
for the first lesson. In giving this lesson, one might 
proceed something after this fashion: Having arranged 
the children’s studies, and attended to the distribution 
of materials, pin the specimen againstva sheet of white 
paper where all the children can see it, and then, if 
possible, paint it before them. Show them how the 
paints are first moistened by dipping the brush in 
water and quickly drawing it across the blue; then 
dipping it again and dampening the yellow. (No red 
will be needed for this lesson.) Show the children how 
the tip of the brush is to be dipped in water, applied 
to the yellow and blue cakes, and tried on a scrap of 
paper to see if the blue and yellow have made just the 
right green. Show them how to sweep in the stem with 
the brush so as to make the picture tell the real truth 
about the slant of the stem. With a few direct strokes, 
show how the leaves branch out from the stem; how 
this one stays close to the stem, while the other bends 
over as though it were tired, and how the brush can  
-P-A-G-E-44
      28 TALKS ON DRAWING   
be made to show the “fluffy hair’ on the grass, stand- 
ing out in all directions. Remove your own specimen 
and painting, and have children set to work to tell 
true stories about the appearance of their grasses with 
brush and paint. What clumsy stems! They must be 
shown how to hold the brush straight up like a soldier, 
when they wish to make narrow stems, instead of 
letting it lie over on its side. This boy has made his 
grass bright yellow. He must be shown how to touch 
the blue into it. This girl is so interested in her paint- 
ing that she forgets to look at her grass, and the result 
' is something like Fig. 4, instead of Fig. 5. “Would 
you like to have your picture taken to look like this 
(Fig. 6), when you stood like this (Fig. 7)? That is 
what you have done to your grass.” 
Have children take a fresh sheet of paper and show 
how the stem bends, where the leaves start from the 
stem, and how the leaves also bend. 
The coarse sedges which grow by the country road- 
sides and in nearly every vacant city lot, furnish fine 
material for nature drawing, and their’ brown tops 
give the children an opportunity to see how a touch of 
red added to the yellow and blue changes the color. 
The dry seed pods of early autumn on their brown 
stems also furnish excellent material, but are possibly 
better for ink and pencil work than for color. 
"After two or three lessons in painting grasses or 
sedges, the teacher need not hesitate to give the children 
flowers to paint. The brighter the color, the better 
will be the lesson. Take for example the salvia. Hav-

ing arranged the flowers so that every child has a good 
view of one specimen and with working materials in 
readiness on the desks, pin three specimens to three 
sheets, marked A, B, C, and fasten on the front ~ 
chalkboard (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Tell the children to 
watch while you paint and to raise their hands as soon 
as they can tell which one you are painting. Qf course 
the very first stroke tells the story, for the “action” of 
the stem is always of importance in “placing? a draw- 
ing correctly and in getting the feeling of growth. 
Show the children how one or two strokes of the brush 
serves to show how each red flower hangs from its stem. 
Then take your flowers and your work down and let 
them tell you with their brushes how their flowers look. 
The teacher may say, ““Oh, but I cannot paint.” Any 
teacher can paint well enough to show primary children 
how to start right, and many a teacher has been sur- 
prised at the way she has developed in the power of 
expression as she has earnestly tried to help the children. 
The children having painted the flower stalks are now 
ready for the leaves. Again you pin up your specimen, 
and this time you show them how careful they must be 
to wash all of the red out of their brushes before making 
their green. You show them how you study the shape 
of the leaf and try to make that shape with the paint. 
Again you remove your work, and have them go on with 
theirs, while you inspect their efforts, speaking an encour- 
aging word here, and making a helpful suggestion there. 
There is little time for individual criticism, but as 
the same mistakes are likely to be made by nearly all 
10 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-46
30 TALKS ON DRAWING   
the children, practically the same «criticisms and 
suggestions apply to all. Over and over the children 
must be taught the right way of using their brushes, 
and of mixing their color in the brush instead of in the 
cover of the box for all flower painting. One very good 
device for showing mistakes and making suggestions 
to all the children at once, is to place somewhere in 
the front of the room where all can see, large sheets of 
cheap paper, the most glaring faults in the children’s 
drawings being pointed out and corrections suggested 
on these sheets before the entire class. Some teachers 
get old sample books ‘of wall paper and hang them up 
so as to use the backs of the separate samples for this 
purpose. 
Teachers will sometimes find the children scrubbing 
their leaves with a vim which promises ill for the brush 
and which produces effects something like this. (Plate 
G, Fig. 1.) In such cases, step to your large sheets, and 
fillmg your brush with water and blue and yellow 
paint, show the children how to let the color flow on 
the paper instead of scrubbing it in. (Plate G, Fig. 2.) 
If you find children drawing a green outline for each 
leaf (Plate G, Fig. 3), show them it is not necessary 
to make a “fence’’ around the leaf, and illustrate how 
the leaf may be painted with no enclosing line (Fig. 2). 
Constant reiteration and infinite patience must be 
practiced by the teacher. Children will be found who 
do not look at the thing they are painting. Show them 
how you use your eyes every minute while painting 
and impress upon them that how well they paint

depends upon how well they see the thing they are 
trying to picture. 
After the papers have been collected look them 
over at your leisure. You will probably ask, ‘Did it 
pay ?”’ after looking at some of the worst of the papers 
with their ‘shapeless spots of red and green, and their 
smudgy finger marks. You will recall the labor of 
arranging the flowers and distributing the paints and 
the water, and will feel like saying, “No, it did not 
pay.” Looking again at the papers, you notice how 
this child really tried to show the drooping stem or the 
leaf as it bent over. You remember as you look at 
another child’s paper how happy he was when he told 
you that his stem was the best he had ever painted. 
The chances are that when you are through with the 
papers, you will have found that many of the children 
are seeing and thinking as they paint, and saying, “ Yes, 
it did pay,” you will look forward with anticipation to 
the next lesson. 
(Plate H.) The four paintings here reproduced 
show the result of such a lesson as above described, 
taught to First Grade pupils on September twentieth. 
Two of the children whose work was selected for 
reproduction here entered school for the first time 
early in the month, while the other two entered in 
January preceding. The lesson was taught by the 
regular grade teacher—not by a Supervisor. Although 
the four sheets shown were selected as the best in the 
set, there were a score of others nearly as good and 
only two downright failures in the room,  
-P-A-G-E-50

Many Supervisors say they teach the children to LIGHT 
look for the shadows on the leaves from the start, eos 
while others say they care nothing about light and 
shade at this stage and are content to work at first 
merely for form and local color. 
Experience has shown that children can be led very 
early to see that places on flowers, leaves, and other 
objects, which the direct light cannot reach, appear 
darker, and to express that darkness-in- their crude and 
childish way. On the whole it may be well to say 
nothing about light and shade to First Grade pupils, 
unless-perhaps to exceptionally talented children who 
are ready for it, but in the Second Grade the children 
may be led by means of many simple devices, not only 
to see the light and shade on flowers and leaves, but to 
represent it more or less effectively in their drawings. 
One of the ways by which children may be led to 
observe shadow is this: Have them hold out their two 
hands with the palms exposed to the full light; then 
have them bring the hands together so that the palms 
form a sort of deep cup into which scarcely any light 
can penetrate. Lead them to notice there is a differ- 
ence in the appearance of the palms when exposed to 
the full light and when held to form a cup and the light 
partly shut out; that they show dark and light spots in 
the latter position which are not apparent in the former. 
Call attention to the same thing on the surface of 
leaves and flowers, and let them paint the parts darker 
that seem darker to them. In this way the teacher can 
gradually lead the children toward expressing light and

HANDLING DRAWING FROM NATURE 33   
shade as well as color, although it is not well to force 
them until they appear to be ready for it. Plate G, 
Figs. 4 and 5, show the same flower painted first with 
no effort at light and shade and then shown with 
simple shadows. 
Too much stress cannot be laid upon the necessity~ 
for “direct handling” in the water color work, and aie 
explanatory word regarding the meaning of this term 
will not come amiss. It is a well known fact about 
water colors, that the more they are mixed and “fussed 
with,” the more muddy and flat and lifeless they be- 
come. Consequently, if one wishes brilliancy and 
“snap”? in his flower painting, he takes his colors 
directly from the cake of paint and does no mixing in 
his box cover. ‘The Second Grade pupil who painted 
_ the petunia (Plate I, Fig. 1), used “direct handling,” 
MASSES 
RATHER 
THAN 
DETAIL and in spite of the wavering lines of the stem and his 
inability to show how the center of the flower looked, 
he put real vigor into the drawing because of the 
crisp rich color. Had he mixed his blue and yellow in 
his pan to get his green, and his blue and red to get his 
purple, his colors would have been flat and lifeless. 
(Plate I, Fig. 2.) Had he used a green or purple from 
some box containing these colors ready-mixed, his 
result would have been even less satisfactory. 5 
Children are lovers of detail, and their natural 
tendency is to give undue importance to the unimpor- 
tant things. They see’ the notches on the edge of the 
leaf, the veins in its surface and many other details, 
and in trying to represent these, they lose sight of the
-P-A-G-E-54
    34 TALKS ON DRAWING   
large shapes and masses entirely. Large flowers placed 
at some distance from them are especially helpful in 
overcoming this tendency, as they can see only the 
masses, while the details are lost to them. There is no 
flower better than the sunflower for such lessons, and 
paper nine by twelve inches instead of six by nine size 
should be used. 
In arranging fruit for the children to paint, try to 
get it attached to a bit of twig with a leaf or two. To 
paint an apple, a cherry, or a plum without anything 
to show its “growth,” results in nothing but a more 
or less meaningless shape. ‘The twig with leaves adds 
interest by showing growth and gives the children 
something more to study than the isolated fruit. In 
painting such a twig as shown in Plate G, Fig. 6, 
let the children paint first with clear water the size 
and shape of the apple. Then, while the paper is still 
wet, let them drop the yellow and blue on this wet 
surface and touch in the red to show the apple’s “rosy 
cheek.”” They must work rapidly, adding leaves and 
stem after the fruit has been painted. Although this 
may sound like a recipe, it is offered simply as one 
good way of getting a result. There are doubtless 
many other ways just as good. 
Delightful as the rich coloring of the fall flowers, 
fruits, and foliage are to the children, they are not 
more fascinating than are the first spring twigs and 
blossoms. Even before the buds begin to swell, the 
children begin to talk of the coming days. Their 
language lessons and nature songs are full of

Flowers and grasses are waiting to grow, 
Hark, do you hear them rushing about, 
Whispering softly, “I want to get out!” 
Only be patient a few weeks more, 
And the warm, kind sun will open the door. 
The brown twigs with the delicate green buds, just 
bursting out, make splendid subjects for painting 
lessons, and the little box which each child in some 
schools has on his desk and in which he plants a few 
kernels of corn or a few beans, furnishes material for 
some fine painting lessons in connection with his 
nature study. Some of the charming child literature 
about growth should surely find its way into these 
lessons.

course the problem of color does not enter into this 
work, but it is important to select studies which are 
strong in form and irregular in outline. 
To explain shadow pictures to the children, hold 
a sheet of paper to the window in direct sunlight. 
Placing your hand behind it, let them see how the 
shadow of your hand on the paper tells exactly the 
shape and the position it is in. Place a spray of 
flowers behind the paper, letting the children note 
the shadow made by it and the color of the shadow. 
Follow this by having the children paint shadow 
pictures of their flowers. Arrange specimens the 
same as for painting lessons, choosing those having 
simple and strongly characteristic growth. 
The persimmons shown in Plate J, Fig. 1, make 
an excellent shadow study for First Grade pupils, and 
many fall sedges, seed pods on the stem, and sprays 
of berries or burrs would be equally good. The flat 
washes which the children make in connection with 
their color exercises (Page 73) form effective 
backgrounds for these silhouette effects, and the 
mounting of these panels on backgrounds of suitable 
proportion adds greatly to their attractiveness. (Plate 
J, Fig. 2.) In the Chapter on Special Days, there 
are suggestions for using these shadow pictures in 
decorating booklet covers, calendars, etc. 
When nature work is done with pencil, the studies 
should be arranged with as great care as when they are 
to be done in color. Some difference of opinion exists 
as to the respective value of outline and mass work,

but the greater number of Drawing Teachers and 
Supervisors favor the mass work for young children | 
as being a broader method and one better calculated 
to lead the child away from the representation of petty 
details. Mass work with pencil also gives a better 
rendering of “texture’’ than can be obtained in outline. ' 
This is plainly shown in the drawings of pussy willows 
here reproduced in the margin. Both were drawn by 
Second Grade children and are carefully drawn, but 
the outline (Fig. 11) gives no suggestion of the contrast 
between the dark shiny stems and the light color of 
the fluffy catkins, while the mass work (Fig. 12) shows 
this contrast plainly. Notice how the texture of the 
rough shaggy burrs (Fig. 13) is shown by the First 
Grade child, and how well this way of working is 
adapted to bringing out the fluffy down of the milk- 
weed against its hard brown pods. (Fig. 14.) Even 
the First Grade bey who has been in school but two 
months has brought out this difference very well. 
For any effective work by young children a very 
soft pencil is necessary—one whose large lead lends 
itself easily and naturally to the drawing of shapes 
in outline or to expressing these same forms in various 
degrees of darkness to show color, or light and shade 
as is done in mass drawing. The pencil should be 
sharpened to a conical point, and in doing mass 
work, should be held so that the pressure does not 
come on the point of the lead but on its beveled sides. 
This gives the child a broad line and enables him to 
represent the masses of dark and light quickly and

easily.. Much needless waste of the teacher’s time and 
wear of the pencils may be avoided by following some 
of the suggestions given in the Chapter on the Care 
and Distribution of Materials. 
There is no color medium so well adapted to 
Nature Work as water colors, yet in many of the smaller 
places the local conditions make the use of paints in 
the schools impracticable. In such places colored 
crayons are used as a substitute and often with \in- 
teresting results. The crayons chosen should be 
free from oil, and should be handled in much the 
same manner as are the pencils in mass drawing. 
Because of the bluntness of the crayons they are better 
suited to the drawing of large specimens than to the 
rendering of those showing more delicacy of line and 
form. This same thing is true of charcoal which is 
frequently used in place of pencil in the First and 
Second Grades. 
Whether we work with water colors, brush and ink, 
pencil, crayon or charcoal, there should be one aim 
underlying all of the Nature Work—to get the child 
not only to look at the thing he is drawing, but to see 
it and to carry its form in his mind and set it down 
upon his paper as truthfully as he can. The little 
girl was right when she looked up at her teacher and 
said, “I know now what drawing is. It is thinking 
and then marking ’round the think.”

    Ill. DRAWING FROM ‘PEOPLE 
? 
The Primary teacher, who is looking only for imme- 
diate and showy results, would better never attempt 
to teach pose drawing unless ‘she is prepared-for dis- 
appointment, for the very best presentation of the 
lesson will be attended by results which such a teacher 
would count failures. Fortunately, the day has passed 
when we work for paper results alone; when the chil- 
dren, regarded as so many oiled and cleverly manipu- 
lated machines, were made to turn out drawings hav- 
ing a certain number of meaningless straight lines or 
curves. 
The understanding and sympathetic teacher of today 
feels that the crude, grotesque pose drawings into 
which the child puts his loving, joyous, spontaneous 
effort, are worth far more to his interest and develop- 
ment than the joyless overworked drawings by which 
results were estimated in former days. To the con- 
scientious teacher who, having cheerfully given her 
children the best help possible in. pose drawing, yet 
‘feels at the close of the year that they have made 
but little progress, we would suggest the following 
plan: When the first school days come, give a pose 
lesson. Give it to the best of your ability. Even go 
to the trouble of writing the children’s names on the 
papers, if they cannot yet write their own. Lay the 
exercises away and do not look at them till the fol-

lowing spring. Then try the same pose again and 
compare results with the first lesson. The drawings 
will still appear very crude, yet will undoubtedly show 
many encouraging evidences of growth. 
Perhaps the pose was that of a child washing at 
a toy tub. The first set of drawings were more or 
less symbolical. (Fig. 1.) Pupils who saw the back 
or side of the child posing drew the same symbol 
as those having a front view. ‘There was absolutely 
no action. Now you find that the children are using 
their eyes. In many cases you find they have repre- 
sented the pose as seen from their position. (Figs. 2 
and 3.) You have no reason to be discouraged. Edu- 
cationally, pose work is particularly good in that the 
children must learn to concentrate their attention—to 
see when they look, inasmuch as the children can 
pose well only a short time. The lessons may also be 
made to correlate delightfully with the Language Work, 
the Changing Seasons, and the Special Days, and be- 
cause of the variety of subjects from which to choose, 
there is little danger of monotony. 
Great diversity of opinion exists among Supervisors MEDIUMS 
as to the best mediums and methods for teaching this ries 
work. Some advise brush and ink or water color,- WORK   and some pencil or charcoal. 
Some teachers believe strongly in the value of sTRAIGHT

drawing of straight line figures has a real value, for 
we know of no better way by which children may be 
led to see and represent action than by the use of 
these exercises. ‘They do not take the place of real 
pose work, and only an occasional lesson is needed 
to accomplish our purpose. 
A boy stands on the desk, facing the school; 
he stands very straight like a soldier and is given a 
pointer to represent a gun. Ask the children to hold 
their pencils the way he is standing. Ask them to 
draw one line to show how he is standing. It should 
be a vertical line. Let him lie straight on the table. 
Ask them to draw one line to show how he is lying. 
The result should be a horizontal line. Let him stand 
with side to the school and bow. A single straight line 
would not represent his position while bowing, and 
so two straight lines making an angle are drawn. Next 
let him stand with arms akimbo and feet far apart, 
and let the children tell how many lines it will take 
to show his position now. ‘The children count the lines 
(Fig. 4) aloud while the boy poses, and then draw 
them to make the picture. Another boy takes a pose 
just as simple, and in like manner the children draw 
another “‘straight line boy.’ Almost every position 
and action may be shown inthis way, Figs. 5-10. After 
the children have gotten the idea of action in this 
manner, let them go a step farther. Talk to them 
about the bones—the,way our flesh and clothes cover 
them, and tell ther ~ >t in the next lesson we will 
clothe our straigh children.

Talk while you work, asking the children to notice how aie:

They will easily see you have shown two people, one 
taller than the other, and that you have made them 
appear very thin when in reality the children you are 
drawing are not thin. Show their real shape in some 
shadow pictures. Work over the skeleton figures, 
saying you are clothing them, until you have this 
result. (Fig. 12.) In clothing your straight line chil- 
dren take pains to retain the same action shown in 
Fig.11. The children will be delighted with the final 
shadow picture you have shown them, and impatient 
to try it themselves. Let them do a straight line 
figure and then change it into a shadow picture. 
The following incident is related to show how easily 
interest may be awakened in this kind of work. Once . 
  when the writer was passing out of a schoolroom, she 
saw some excellent action drawings in line pinned on 
the door. One was like this (Fig. 13), the difference 
in the size of the two figures probably being an acci- 
dent. Taking advantage of this, and using brush and 
ink, she rapidly changed the skeleton picture into a 
shadow picture (Fig. 14), while making up a story to 
fit the picture, about the boy, who came to school 
late and was told by his teacher that it mustn’t happen 
again. The imaginations of the children easily fitted 
the picture to the story, after noticing the position, 
size and clothing of the two figures. The children   oh L

had never tried to clothe their skeleton figures before, 
and a gale of delight swept over the room when they 
discovered how easily this could be done. Immedi- 
ately afterwards, under the direction of the grade 
teacher, the pupils were given an opportunity to draw 
from a new pose in the same way, which they did 
with great enthusiasm and excellent results. 
As an easy sequence to these shadow pictures, 
simple color poses may be worked out in the same 
way. Fig. 15 shows a child’s version of 
Jack be nimble, 
Jack be quick, 
Jack jump. over 
The candle-stick. 
Probably a boy was asked to jump while the other 
children watched the action of his legs and arms dur- 
ing ihe performance, afterwards drawing such figures 
as these (Figs. 16, 17, 18) and covering the pencil lines 
with color to show the boy’s red sweater, blue trousers, 
and black stockings. Although the colors are not shown 
in this reproduction, the effect may be easily imagined. 
Exercises in pose drawing like those described will 
prove a great help in illustrative drawing. Children 
will learn not only to show action and proportion, but 
may be led also to show nearness and farness by 
varying the size of their figures based on the facts of 
(Figs. 19, 20.) It should be noted, how- 
ever, that while action drawing has a place of its own observation. 
‘which nothing else can fill, it does not and cannot 
take the place of the regular pose drawing. 
     
-P-A-G-E-68
  44 TALKS ON DRAWING 
The most commonly used medium is either a 
pencil with a large soft lead, or charcoal, which may 
be used for both outline and mass work. If mass 
work is desired, do not allow the children to outline 
the shapes first, but teach them to show the shape 
directly in the mass, using the pencil almost as though 
it were a brush. Fig. 21 is an outline, Fig. 22 is a 
mass drawing. In Fig. 22, one can plainly see that 
the girl’s sunbonnet is lighter than her blue dress, 
and that her stockings and shoes are darker than her 
dress. No attempt should be made to show light and 
shade except in the very simplest way. Fig. 23 shows 
the effect when the shape is first outlined and then 
filled in. Such work should be discouraged at this 
stage. In some cities all of the pencil pose drawing 
is done in ‘‘mass;’ in others it is done in outline. 
Brush and ink are considered excellent for this 
work because they make it difficult for the child to 
show unnecessary details, such as shoe-buttons, polka- 
dots, etc. Plate K shows a few reproductions from 
children’s brush and ink efforts in pose work. 
By way of adding a little variety to the silhouette 
work, try an occasional pose drawing in brush and 
ink and one color. The use of red for the apples, 
doll carriage, sunbonnet, and watering-can in these 
pose drawings gives a note of color which delights the 
children and in no way detracts from the value of 
the lesson. (See Plate L.)

that a child should pose for that length of time. In 
doing the little action drawings, only a couple of 
minutes are needed for each pose, and the sheet, when 
finished, should contain a number of small drawings 
rather than one large one. In the more studied work 
where one position is used for the entire lesson, the 
model poses for a minute or two, then rests a minute, 
returning to the same position after each rest. Chil- 
dren do not need a long time for a drawing lesson 
of this kind. They do not know how to work slowly 
and carefully, and fifteen minutes for the work and 
five minutes for the distribution and collection of 
materials, is ample time. In places, however, where 
the period is only fifteen minutes, including the time 
for distribution and collection of materials, teachers 
must necessarily work at a disadvantage and must plan 
to cover less ground. Plate M shows four reproductions 
of pencil drawings made by Second Grade children. 
The teacher’s desk makes a good place to pose 
the children, for when a child stands upon it, he 
may be easily seen from all parts of the room. A 
large piece of manila paper may be used to protect 
the desk from being marred or otherwise injured. 
Reference was made to this subject in the Chapter 
on Drawing from Imagination, and much more might 
be said in this connection. A fur or lap robe and 
a cap pulled over the ears make an Esquimo pose 
which lends interest to the Agoonac Story. Diminutive 
Indian, fireman and soldier costumes, etc., are the 
proud possession of many a small boy who will bring

them to school without urging, while, thanks to the 
imagination of the child, a newspaper folded into a 
cocked hat and combined with a flag, a toy gun, a 
sword, or a drum will give a variety of military poses 
at least. A boy who is invited to stand up before 
the children on some rainy day and let them draw 
his picture in mackintosh, rubber boots, and a big 
rubber hat is as proud as a king, and some rainy- 
day song or verse helps out the picture, as 
“In mackintoshes, rubber boots, with lovely big um-

Many teachers have the notion it will not do to 
have the children of the First and Second Grades 
draw anything but back views. This will result sooner 
or later in a deadly monotony and a consequent lack 
of interest. Children will get much more out of a 
difficult pose which interests them than out of a simple 
one which does not. They love variety.

  IV. DRAWING FROM ANIMALS 
The chapter on animal drawing follows immedi- 
ately the one on pose drawing because they are so 
closely related in method, and because power gained 
in the former may be immediately applied in the 
latter and under practically the same conditions. The 
chief difference is that the children are more tractable 
for the poses than their furred and feathered friends. 
The tendency of animals, however, to constantly change 
their position stimulates quick accurate observation on 
the part of the children. 
If your school is so situated that there is a horse, 
a cow, a goat, or a donkey, in some neighboring lot 
or yard, you have ideal conditions for an occasional 
animal lesson, for these large animals stand much more 
quietly than the smaller ones which are brought into 
the schoolroom for study. Besides, most animals are 
less nervous and restless when in their own environ- 
ment than when taken out of it and into the strange 
surroundings of a school, and the presence in some 
cases of their hereditary enemies. In a few favored 
schools which chance to be located near a city park 
in which a Zoo is maintained, the children have had 
some fascinating lessons in drawing buffaloes, deer, 
bears, and ostriches. Standing outside of the grat- 
ing, pencil and pad in hand, the children have 
tried to tell all about the shapes of these crea- 
49

      50 TALKS ON DRAWING   
tures, and their keen interest so stimulated their sense 
of observation that the results were most creditable. 
The swans in the park lagoon have frequently served 
as objects for the children to draw. Very often a pet 
  . pony or burro has been brought into the school-yard ° 
and has furnished the children with a fine subject for 
a drawing lesson. 
It is a great treat for the children to take paper, 
pencil, and a book on which to rest the paper, and 
go out of doors for a lesson, but before leaving the 
room they should be prepared in a measure for the 
lesson. By careful questioning the teacher should 
direct the attention of the children to leading char- 
acteristics in the form of the animal they are about to 
draw. 
If it should happen to be a donkey, she would 
want to direct attention especially to the ears and 
tail, comparing with the horse with which they are 
more familiar, having the children tell in what respects 
the donkey is like and unlike a horse. Impress upon 
them that they are going to tell in their pictures just 
how the donkey looks; that they are going to tell his 
shape when looked at from the side, from the front 
and from behind. . If the teacher has some toy animal 
to show the children, she can, by placing the toy in 
various positions, make clear why there will be a 
difference in the pictures of the donkey, depending 
upon whether he is seen from the side, the front, ete. 
Even small children may be led to understand that 
what they see when they look at the donkey depends

upon where they are sitting or standing when they 
draw. If the teacher is clever with her chalk, she 
can illustrate her meaning by a few rapid strokes on 
the chalk board, but these should be quickly made 
and as quickly erased. ‘The success of the lesson 
depends largely upon the way in which the preliminary 
work is done. ‘ 
An out-of-door lesson should never be given when 
the weather is such as to threaten the health of the 
children from exposure. If, however, the day is warm 
and bright and the ground dry, the children may sit 
on the grass in groups of eight or. ten, with these 
groups not too widely separated. This plan is better 
than massing all of the children together. Each child 
can get a better view of the object and at the same 
time this placing will ensure greater variety in the 
drawings on account of the greater variation in points 
of seeing. Sometimes the boys sit on the fence while 
the girls stand and look through the bars. Sometimes 
the steps of the schoolhouse are used as a “grand stand,” 
and, as before suggested, a pet pony or goat is brought 
into the school-yard for a drawing lesson. 
If the children are arranged in groups or along 
the fence, it is an easy matter for the teacher to pass 
in and out among them with a suggestion for this 
child and a word of encouragement for that. In case 
the school steps are used, she will find the top step 
a fine vantage point, and seated just above the chil- 
dren; she can view the work of the entire class’ and 
frequently give suggestions that are needed by each

and all. Occasionally, some boy or girl from an upper 
grade, who is especially talented, assists the teacher in 
these out-of-door lessons. / 
This work depends largely upon local conditions, 
such as climate, location of school, number of pupils, 
etc., but generally speaking, such lessons should be given 
as often as the time assigned to drawing, and the other 
drawing work will permit. Rightly taught, the work 
has great value, strengthening the children’s powers of 
observation and expression, stimulating their interest in 
nature study, and furnishing material for their lan- 
guage lessons. 
Out-of-door lessons are impossible in many city 
districts, and in such cases the animal should be 
brought to the schoolroom. Pet dogs, rabbits, parrots, 
chickens, geese, and pigeons are suitable for such les- 
sons. Provide your animal, either by bringing it your- 
self or by having it brought by the children. If you 
depend upon the children to bring an animal for some 
particular lesson, you would better not depend upon 
any one child, as he is quite likely to forget. We 
recall instances, however, when such was not the case. 
In a district where fowls are plentiful, we knew a 
teacher who asked eight of her boys to bring a rooster, 
thinking she would be sure to get one specimen for 
the painting lesson in the afternoon. Contrary to her 
expectations, they remembered “to a man,” and eight 
crowing, flapping birds held by eight red-faced boys 
awaited her arrival when school opened. It was to 
say the least an “embarrassment of riches.”

SUITABLE 
MEDIUMS DRAWING FROM ANIMALS 53   
It is not a bad plan to use two animals widely 
differing in shape and proportion for one lesson, for 
instance, a pigeon and a rooster or a bulldog and a 
terrier, alternating the pose of one with the other and 
thus bringing out the characteristics of each more 
strongly. If the lesson is limited to fifteen minutes, 
as it is in a few places, it is advisable to devote the 
entire period to one animal. 
The teacher’s desk makes a good “model stand” 
on which to place the animals, after all other objects 
have been removed and it has been covered with 
newspapers. ‘The animal should be made to feel at 
home. A few cabbage leaves for the rabbit will 
insure some very interesting poses and will help to 
keep him quiet. Corn sprinkled over the desk for 
the pet rooster will be much appreciated by his royal 
highness. It is not necessary or desirable that the 
animal remain rigidly quiet, even were it possible. 
Much of the value of the lesson depends upon its 
liability to move at any instant, thereby making the 
children alert and quick in their drawing. However, 
the boy or girl who owns the pet, if a pet animal has 
been brought, can stand near the desk and occa- 
sionally quiet it with a word or a comforting stroke 
ofits fur or feathers. 
For the out-of-door lesson, the pencil is probably 
the best medium, but for those that are given in the 
schoolroom, charcoal, crayons, brush and ink, or water 
colors may be used. 
The parrot is especially fine for painting on account

of his bright plumage, but he is quite a rare bird com- 
pared with the rooster, which can be found in almost any 
district.. There is no better animal than the rooster 
for representation in color. He is excellent for pencil, 
or brush, or ink, but for treatment in color he is hard 
to excel because his shape is so characteristic, and . 
because his colors are so rich they appeal very strongly 
to the children. The chief points to be given promi- 
nence in studying the rooster are his small head, his 
comb, his arched neck, the short distance between his 
neck and his tail, the height of his head as compared 
with that of his tail, the slant of his legs and the 
shape of his feet. Children always draw the feet of 
any bird or fowl as though the creature were bal- 
ancing on tip-toe. A few strokes of your chalk or 
brush will show them that the claws are more nearly 
level than upright. 
In this connection, it may be well to call atten- 
tion to the importance of studying carefully the feet 
and legs of any animal before drawing it. The 
characteristic shape of many animals is determined 
largely by their legs—whether they are straight or bent, 
thick or slender, slanting or vertical, and by the way 
in which they are joined to the body. In drawing 
birds, children almost always place the legs under the 
middle of the body instead of farther back, and they 
frequently forget to notice that the legs are seldom 
vertical.

the work is very crude, the children have grasped the 
distinguishing features of each rooster and have shown 
them in their paintings. They were encouraged to 
dip the colors directly from the cakes of paint and 
to put them on the paper with no mixing in the box. 
Those that look flat and dull in color were prob- 
ably done by mixing a wash in the box cover. 
There should be no attempt to make large, fin- 
ished drawings of the animals. ‘The animal moves so 
often that such a thing would be quite impossible. 
The children should start anew each time the animal 
changes his position, and the sheet at the end of the 
lesson should show a number of small incompleted 
sketches rather than a finished one of large size. 
Frequently, there will be only the beginnings of many 
sketches when the lesson is over. Notice in the mar- 
ginal sketches which are reproduced from children’s 
drawings, how they have worked in this way. 
An occasional lesson may be given by first select- 
ing some animal which is easy to draw, like the 
rabbit. Place him on the desk, and after the chil- 
dren have looked at him for a few moments (if he 
remains in one position for that length of time) remove 
him from sight and let the children draw from mem- 
ory what they saw. Then place him on the desk in 
some other position and let them try again. This is 
always interesting and may be made a fine exercise 
in quick observation. Do not expect too much, for 
the children often do the most unexpected things. An 
Ohio teacher related that in giving a lesson from the

rabbit in her room, she called attention to its long 
ears, its little stubby tail, etc., and then set the chil- 
dren to work. One little fellow produced this result 
(Fig. 28) and explained to the astonished teacher that it 
was bunny’s two ears, two eyes, mouth, body, and tail. 
  Teachers often ask if they cannot have pupils DRAWING 
sketch from a stuffed bird which is sure to “stay ee 
put,” as one little fellow expressed it, instead of from BIRDS 
live specimens, which cannot be counted upon to pose 
quietly. There seem to be two reasons why this 
would be inadvisable. First, such a plan would destroy 
the chief value of animal drawing, namely, the quick, 
spontaneous effort of the children to take in all they 
can at a glance and to work rapidly and with con- 
centration—to get all they can before the model 
changes its position. In the second place, the interest 
and delight with which the children study the rooster 
or parrot, and try to show how he looks in this posi- 
tion or that, does not extend to the poor dead bird, 
standing motionless on his perch. “Is he awfully 
  dead?” asked one little child in an awed whisper 
when a stuffed robin was put before him to draw. 
Sketching toy animals comes more under the head pRAwING 
TOY of object drawing than animal drawing, but a few ,viars 
words regarding it may not be amiss in this place. 
A rocking horse or a ‘Teddy Bear are splendid objects 
to draw, and there are other toy animals which are 
made so well that the children actually get a good 
idea of proportion from drawing them. ‘The jointed

> Cireus,” and which is so constructed that trunk, legs, 
head, and even ears are movable and adjustable, and 
which may be made to stand in any number of most 
natural positions, is a model which is most delightful 
to the children. ‘The author believes that were she 
teaching in a Primary Grade, she would possess her- 
self of this toy as a part of her equipment. 
The study of pictures is a great aid in familiar- 
izing children with various animal forms, and teachers 
will find that a collection of pictures is invaluable. 
Encourage the children to bring pictures of animals 
to school. They will take delight in doing this, and 
you will be surprised to see how many pictures are 
brought in response to your request. ‘The newspapers, 
magazines, old picture books, and souvenir postal 
stands will furnish their quota. In one room we know, 
over one hundred and fifty pictures of dogs were 
brought by the children, and from these the: teacher 
selected a hundred that were good enough to mount 
on manila paper. To these she added a few especially 
fine ones which she cut from her own magazines or 
begged from her friends, and altogether the collection 
when completed and mounted in a book was the 
most delightful one of dog pictures we have ever seen. 
In this book his canine majesty is depicted under 
every possible emotion from deep grief to violent joy, 
and in almost every position. 
From this collection of pictures the children learned 
the characteristics of various dogs, so that they were 
able to tell very readily the difference between a collie 
       
-P-A-G-E-88
    
    58 TALKS ON DRAWING .   
and a bull-dog, a greyhound and a terrier, a spaniel 
and a beagle, etc. It is not to be wondered at that 
during the animal drawing which followed this picture 
study and in which live dogs served as models, the 
children evinced unusual interest with a high average 
of results. 
Another teacher made a collection of animal pic- 
tures, and, after mounting them on cardboard, cut 
each picture into six pieces. Occasionally, on a Friday 
afternoon, the children played the following game in- 
stead of doing the regular drawing work. The small 
pieces were mixed up and each child was given a 
certain number of pieces which he laid on his desk, 
sorting to see what he had. The teacher next 
asked every child who had a part of a horse picture 
to stand. These children then brought the sections to 
the table or to an empty seat and arranged them so 
as to form the complete picture. In like manner, 
various groups of children arranged the other animals. 
To them it was a game, but in reality they were 
learning much which would be put to practical use 
in their drawing later. 
In choosing pictures for the walls of a Primary 
room, select one really fine animal picture, if possible. 
One reproduction of a Landseer or a Bonheur, a Van.

OBJECTS V. DRAWING FROM THINGS 
No kind of drawing has undergone a greater change 
in the method of teaching it than this. The days when 
young children were given wooden blocks (the simple 
geometric solids) to draw, after touching and counting 
their edges, corners, faces, and surfaces, have happily 
passed away. Drawing from objects has now been 
made most interesting by letting the children draw 
things which play a part in their environment and 
their activities instead of those early geometric abstrac- 
tions which could make no intrinsic appeal to the 
childish mind. A Drawing Course in which drawing 
from objects received little attention would be like a 
building with a weak framework, and this weakness 
and instability would be detected not alone in lack 
of power to draw things as they appear, but in story 
drawing, in the color work and in all other kinds 
of drawing as well as in the making. 
Several things must be considered when preparing 
for and giving a lesson in object drawing, not the 
least important of which is to provide a suitable object 
or suitable objects. It was a wise woman who, when 
asked for her recipe for cooking a hare, said “First 
catch your hare.” The discriminating: selection of an 
object or objects should just as surely precede a lesson 
in object drawing. Many schoolrooms are completely 
barren of anything suitable for this kind of lesson.

There is, to be sure, the much used waste basket. 
But it is not a very interesting thing at the outset 
and when it has been drawn as often as the teacher 
finds “object drawing”’ designated on her program, it 
loses any charm it may once have possessed. Besides, 
the children usually work with more interest when 
something is put before them with which they are 
not so familiar and which is more in the nature of 
a surprise to them. ‘They have seen the waste basket 
day after day and consequently do not use their eyes 
when asked to draw a picture of it, but draw more 
from imagination than from observation. It is not 
difficult to plan ahead for an object, the teacher bring- 
ing it into the schoolroom. or having some pupil do 
so. Some schools include in their collection of “still 
life’? not only the beautiful and inexpensive pottery 
now so available and used chiefly in the upper grades, 
but crocks, kitchen and garden utensils, and a few 
large toys, such as acart, a wheelbarrow, etc., to be used 
in connection with pose workor object drawing. In many 
places the teachers ask the children to bring to school 
old leaky teapots, coffee pots, kettles, watering cans, etc. 
These are kept in some closet or corner of the base- 
ment, and prove a never-failing source of supply for 
every grade when object drawing is on the program. 
Not only should one provide an object for the 
lesson, but it should be a suitable one. A child will 
draw things which interest him with much more ob- 
servation and spontaneity than things which do not. 
A wooden sphere is doubtless the easiest thing which

could be placed before him, but it is cold and mean- 
ingless. He will draw circle after circle to represent 
it, but mechanically and without interest. If you give 
him the sphere in the form of his big brother’s base 
ball, putting the bat with it, the story is a different one.’ 
You may possibly choose to have him make a large 
drawing on one side of the paper (Fig. 1), and on the 
other side several smaller ones for practice in quick 
observation. 
The children may divide the sheet for the smaller 
drawings into four equal spaces by lines, and in the 
four spaces thus formed they may make one-minute 
sketches to show how the ball and the bat look when 
placed in different positions (Fig. 2). 
While drawing the ball and bat how the children 
would enjoy having a base-ball pose. ‘The results 
might be damaging if the action were carried too far, 
but one is sure the lesson would hot be without in- 
terest and delight for the children (Fig. 3). 
Cut a sheet of paper into any odd form (Figs, 
4, 5, 6). Hold it before the children for a minute, 
slowly passing your fingers over the margin to call 
attention to direction, slant, etc. Put it behind you 
and let the children draw or cut the shape as they 
remember it. Instance after instance could be given 
showing how this kind of work has developed the 
observation of children. It not only trains them 
to observe quickly but they are stimulated to accuracy 
by the rivalry which the exercise arouses and the 
desire of each to excel the others. oo

Just as the drawing of the baseball will prove 
much more interesting than the drawing of the geomet- 
rical sphere, so will there be more inherent interest 
in the drawing of a berry box or a milk can than 
in the drawing of a cube or cylinder. Children’s toys 
are fine for object drawing—Noah’s ark, ‘Teddy Bear, 
sled, wheelbarrow, cart, fire engine toys (Fig. 7)— 
indeed any of the hundreds of toys which interest 
them so much. If the locality is such that toys are 
scarce, there are always tools at hand, such as hammer, 
ax, saw, etc.; garden implements, such as watering 
can, spade, rake, shovel, and hoe, and kitchen utensils, 
including teakettle, rolling-pin, pail, dipper, ete. 
Potted plants are also excellent for this work. Peach, 
market, and clothes baskets are good subjects. We 
once saw a fine lesson given in a school located in 
one of the poorer districts of a large city, with the 
clothes basket for a subject. Two of the children 
had been asked to go to their home near by and 
bring a clothes basket. The teacher had seen the 
basket in a neighboring yard and had asked the 
mother if she would loan it. The children came back 
with the basket and their baby brother asleep in it, 
for it served as his cradle. While the lesson was in 
progress the baby awoke and popped his head and 
arms above the basket and the children added him 
to their pictures. It goes without saying the result 
was most interesting.

may be used to splendid advantage in block building 
from which pupils may draw. The suggestions offered 
in the marginal sketches may prove helpful. The 
playing blocks belonging to the children may be 
brought to school if there are no blocks furnished for 
the school, and many interesting lessons in building 
and drawing may be evolved therefrom. 
If the object is large, like a watering can or large 
kite, it may be seen easily by all the children, the 
"former by being placed on a chair, which in turn is 
placed on the teacher’s desk; the latter by being 
pinned to the wall in the front of the room. If, how- 
ever, the objects are small, several should be pro- 
vided so that each child may plainly see the thing 
he is trying to draw. We once visited a room where 
fifty primary children were trying to draw one little 
china cup which stood on the teacher’s desk. It was 
scarcely better than no lesson. ‘There should have 
been “desk boards’ placed across the aisles resting 
on the desks and at least seven cups placed as shown 
by the crosses in the diagram on Page 135. For this 
purpose any ordinary board will answer. Boards upon 
which dress goods are wound are often available at 
the dry goods stores. ‘These are light and easy to 
handle, and a set of them on each floor of a building 
will be sufficient. Many teachers prefer to have their 
own desk boards to avoid confusion. The teacher 
who thinks this causes too much trouble and takes 
too much time should remember how much more 
time and trouble are involved in placing chairs, tables, 
     
-P-A-G-E-94
  
      64 TALKS ON DRAWING   
boxes, etc., in the aisles on which to place the objects 
‘to be drawn. A little trouble at the outset is worth 
while, as the desk boards remain as a permanent 
convenience for this work. Let one boy be responsi- 
ble for placing the boards across the aisles properly 
and returning them to their place after the lesson. 
An object may be seen much more easily against 
a plain background. For instance, if the children are 
to draw a coffeepot, throw your white apron over 
the back of the chair which has been placed on the 
desk to hold the object, and let this white surface 
serve as a background against which the form of the 
object may be seen plainly. For the smaller objects 
such backgrounds may be used as are suggested on 
Page 26 in the Chapter Drawing from Nature. 
Put the same animation and sparkle into the 
lessons which make the language lessons so delightful 
when conducted by a good teacher. In doing this 
each teacher must devise her own methods of pre- 
sentation and put her own personality into the work. 
Personifying objects often appeals to the children. 
Perhaps you have arranged a pail and a dipper 
(Fig. 14). Talk about the large Mrs. Pail and the 
little Miss Dipper. Have the children note their 
positions and let them show by gestures how Mrs. 
Pail holds her hands clasped above her head, and 
how Miss Dipper holds her arm out as though she 
were pointing, etc. (Figs. 15 and 16). 
Objects may be turned and drawn as they appear 
in each position (Figs. 17, 18, 19). This may be

done in one lesson, or, if the object is difficult, the 
work may cover several lessons. For instance, the 
watering can looks very different according as we see 
the front, side or back. Remember also that each 
child in the room sees the object from a different 
position and therefore does not see exactly the same 
thing, although he is looking at the same object. Try 
to have him show what he sees. If he does not see 
the spout, he should not draw it. Do not draw a 
picture of the object on the chalkboard. This is 
deadly to the development of power in the children. 
You cannot expect great results from small chil- 
dren, but if you work in the right way and toward 
the right end, you may be sure you are laying the 
right foundation for greater results later. The main 
object of this work is to quicken the child’s observa- 
tion and to help him express truthfully what he sees 
in so far as he is able. If you wish him to express 
the big facts of proportion, action, ete., how do you 
set to work ? 
Let us suppose that you have chosen for the lesson 
an umbrella. You choose this because the day is 
rainy, and the umbrella may be easily seen. You 
have placed the umbrella on your desk against a 
white background. Paper and pencils are distributed 
and all is ready. You first ask the children to turn 
their papers in such a way as to make the drawing 
fit the space. This is better than to show them how 
to turn the paper. You ask them to show you (by a 
gesture) how the umbrella is standing—whether it 
       
-P-A-G-E-96
        66 TALKS ON DRAWING   
stands ‘‘straight up” or slants, and if the latter, which 
way. hen let them draw one line on their paper 
to show. how the umbrella stands. Let it be a “‘secret”’ 
line, that is, drawn so lightly that no one can see it easily 
but themselves. Pass around quickly and see if they 
have the idea. Many will be found right, but some 
will be found too short. ‘Tell the children you want 
long umbrellas, not stingy ones. You have now coy- 
ered the first stage (Fig. 20, A). Have the children 
study the umbrella again and find out how much of 
it is handle, how much cloth and how much tip. Let 
them make marks to show the divisions (Fig. 20, B). 
Call their attention to the way the cloth part looks, 
the way the ends of the ribs group themselves closely 
around the handle, ete. Let them draw. You were 
looking for something like C or D. What you found 
were drawings more like E and F. But do not 
become discouraged. You have probably given a 
good lesson judged by child measure. ‘Teach as well 
the next time, and the next, and the results will take 
care of themselves. 
Among young children there seems to be an almost sizz OF ; DRAW- 
INGS universal tendency to draw too small, and this ten- 
ency must be overcome before there can be any real 
freedom in the work. The teacher can easily show 
her preference for large drawings by judicious praise 
of such efforts, and by referring to the small and 
cramped ones as “stingy drawings” or in some other 
equally expressive terms. One _ teacher, in whose 
room the work showed exceptional freedom and bold- 
   
-P-A-G-E-97
TECH- 
NIQUE DRAWING FROM THINGS 67   
ness, explained her way of obtaining these results as 
follows: She said they always used 9x12 manila paper 
when drawing with charcoal, and 6x9 when drawing 
with pencil and for water color work, urging the 
children to draw large by every argument which 
occurred to her. She placed great stress on drawing 
first a few suggestive lines (“blocking in”), claiming 
if the first lines and shapes are cramped and dwarfed, 
the finished drawing will be so. When, however, a 
child persistently made tiny drawings, she said’ she 
resorted to the expedient of giving him a very small 
sheet of paper, telling him it was wasteful to give 
him a large sheet since he never used but a small 
part of it. He was assured that just as soon as he 
wanted to draw larger, he could have a larger sheet. 
She increased the size of the sheet gradually as he 
learned to draw larger. 
Another teacher accomplished the same end by 
hanging up an old sample of wall paper, as mentioned 
in another chapter, letting some pupil who had made 
an especially large and good drawing of some object, 
take a piece of soft charcoal and make a large draw- 
ing on the back of the wall paper which was kept 
on exhibition for a day or two. 
In the old days when school drawing was in its 
infancy, great stress was laid upon the manner in 
which the child should hold his pencil in order to 
get the “broad ‘gray line” which seemed to be the 
end of all drawing work. The children were given 
many drill exercises in pencil holding, according to 
   
-P-A-G-E-98
      68 TALKS ON DRAWING   
fixed directions, and the luckless child, who grasped 
his pencil too near the point, received extra drill in 
order that the uniform rule might be enforced with 
every pupil. We now show the pupil how to hold 
the pencil in the way that gives the most freedom, 
recognizing that the thing we are striving to develop 
is not power to hold the pencil at a given angle or 
in’ a hard and fixed position, but first power to see 
and then to-express with their pencils what they see. 
The child who holds his “pencil in a cramped, tense 
grip so as to make freedom of drawing impossible 
should of course be shown the better way of holding 
it. But to go to the pupil, who with intense interest 
is trying to make the spout of his teapot look just 
as he sees it, and interrupt his eager effort by asking 
him how he is holding his pencil, would be like inter- 
rupting the happy song of a child by asking him 
about the position of his larynx. 
There comes a time when technique is given its 
necessary place—and a very important place in the 
drawing work, but that time may wisely be postponed 
until the child is well along in the grades. 
Almost the first thing which the child learns in 
school is how to write his name, and he should mark 
every drawing he makes, even when his writing is 
uncertain and almost illegible. As soon as possible he 
should learn to add the date to his signature. 
Throughout the entire school course, every drawing 
should bear the child’s name and date of lesson. There 
should be a uniform place for these on the sheet for MARKING 
THE

convenience in looking over the work and because it 
identifies the work and contributes to its appearance 
in case of exhibition. Some Supervisors ask to have 
all drawings signed on the back, while others prefer 
to have the name placed in the lower left hand corner 
of the drawing side, and the date in the lower right 
hand corner. Again, the signing of the pupil’s name 
to a drawing gives him a certain feeling of responsi- 
bility, and is an added incentive to best effort, for 
even primary children soon learn that if the work is 
unsigned, neither carelessness nor excellence can be 
: traced to the individual who is responsible for them. 
ERASERS irasers should not be used by pupils in the pri- 
mary grades. ‘Their use would encourage carelessness ' 
  and lead to untidy results. If available at any time, 
the freedom and spontaneity of the work would be 
  impaired. he children should use very light lines 
(“secret lines’ as we have termed them elsewhere in 
this Chapter) for blocking in the drawings, covering 
these up with heavier lines or with the mass work 
in the finished drawing. 
OBJECTS In addition to the flowers, fruit and vegetables 
ae which furnish such fine color lessons, let the children 
try occasionally to render other objects in color. If a 
bit of pottery is chosen, work only for the local color 
and the form. For instance, a green vase in which 
you might see high lights and graduation of light and 
shade (Plate O, Fig. 1) would simply be green to the 
child (Plate O, Fig. 2), and it would be wrong to 
attempt to force him to see anything else at this stage.

He has many years before him. If water color is 
the medium, do not let the pupil outline with pencil, 
| but let him “wash in” the shape first with water, 
and then paint his green wash over the moist surface. 
Chinese lanterns are fine for any grade. In the first 
grade there will be little or no perspective, but let - 
the child work to tell as much of the truth as he can 
about the form and color of the lanterns. Do not 
let the children paint simply fancy “make believe” 
lanterns (Plate O, Fig. 3). Hang up a real lantern 
and encourage them to tell as much as possible with 
their brushes about its true shape and color. 
Avoid the hard lines and edges (Plate O, Fig. 4) 
by having the children first paint the form of the 
lantern in clear water, washing in the color on this 
moist surface (Plate O, Fig. 5). Show how the colors 
may be made to blend by this method. Do not 
expect to make artists of all the children any more 
than you expect to make bookkeepers and expert 
accountants of all the children who study arithmetic.

VI. PAINTING AND COLOR 
Those who have studied the effect of color upon ° 
children say that working with bright colors under 
careful and wise direction contributes to the develop- 
ment of child character. ‘To paint the school room 
walls a bright red, however, they say would be a 
harmful thing to do, for, although stimulating to 
mentality when used moderately, when used in large 
masses, it, tends to over-excite the mind, causing 
nervousness and lack of self-control. On the other 
hand, exercises involving the discriminating and 
moderate use of bright colors may be made to serve a 
good purpose in developing the color sense. 
\ Children love color before they go to school. They 
sense it and crave it almost from birth. They may 
be taught how to make it and use it at school, but 
the love for it seems to be inborn. Apparently, the 
more barren and colorless the environment of a race 
‘or an individual, the more passionate will be their 
craving for color.) The Indians of the Western plains 
‘paint into their gaudy designs all the hues which 
nature has denied them in the somber alkali desert 
which serves as their stage setting. The woman of 
the dingy Ghetto obeys the same instinct, when she 
ties around her neck the glaring kerchief and decks 
herself with the bright multi-colored beads or artificial 
stones which appeal to her love of color. To take 
71  
-P-A-G-E-104
  72 TALKS ON DRAWING   
this inherent love of color and direct it to an appre- 
ciation of harmonious and truly beautiful color is one 
of the provinces of the school, and it may be the- 
happy privilege of the primary teacher to open 
the door through which the child may enter into the 
kingdom of beauty., Children are veritable barbarians 
in the absence of a discriminating taste, and when 
they enter school the most glaring colors and the most 
antagonistic combinations appeal to them more strongly 
than the less intense colors in harmonious relation. 
‘The earlier color exercises should aim to gratify the 
child’s craving for strong color while leading him to 
finer discriminations in color relations and harmony. 
The full development of these finer discriminations 
will be the work of years, and we should no more 
expect the primary child to surrender his love of strong 
color for a love of the more subtle and subdued tones 
. than we should expect him to turn with joy from his 
Fairy Tales or Mother Goose rhymes to Shakespeare’s 
plays or Browning’s poems. 
The flowers and objects which are chosen for early 
painting should be rich, intense, and brilliant in color, 
because the painting of these objects satisfies the child’s 
desire for bright colors, and because he is incapable 
of producing the more subtle tones. This subject is 
treated in the Chapter on Drawing from Nature under 
Flower Painting. Besides lessons in which the aim is 
to see and represent form and color correctly, there are 
many delightful exercises with color sense training for 
their chief motive. Some of these exercises are given

WASHES 
  PAINTING AND COLOR 73   
in the following pages, and it is hoped they may sug- 
gest many others which will be equally helpful. 
Let the children paint flat washes showing tints 
of the primary colors, red, yellow, and blue. Let 
them paint panels without first drawing enclosing lines 
with pencil. Th painting a “‘flat wash,” the child 
should first moisten the entire surface of each cake 
of paint by filling the brush with water, and drawing 
it across each one in succession. Then into one of 
the compartments of his paint box let him dip enough 
water for the wash—say about a teaspoonful, for an 
oblong of ordinary size. After this, let him color 
this water the desired tint, and beginning from the 
top paint downward from left to right, always working 
with his brush full of the tint. The papers should 
be six by nine inches in size, and when finished will 
be like Figures 1, 2, and 3. In the same way washes 
of the secondary colors may be made (Figs. 4, 5, and 
6) by mixing red and yellow for orange, blue and 
yellow for green, and blue and red for violet. These 
panels should be saved and utilized as backgrounds 
for brush and ink work. 
The child who painted the spray, Plate J, Fig. 2, 
used a tinted background which was done at the time 
of the flat wash lessons just mentioned. 
In schools where the tinted papers are not available 
for use by the children, these color washes may be 
saved and used in making strips for weaving or in 
connection with the lessons in Paper Cutting, or in the 
making of little booklets for Number Lessons, etc.

An exercise which affords opportunity both for 
color mixing and the study of color relation is based 
on the following rhyme: 
Tom Tinkum had six toy balloons, 
And all of these were white; 
He took his paints and took his brush 
And worked with all his might. 
“The first one of the row,” Tom said, 
“Ll paint my very brightest red, 
And then I'll mix my red with yellow 
For orange,” said the little fellow. 
“And now I'll paint a pretty one 
All round and yellow like the sun. 
By mixing yellow with my blue 
I'll get a lovely bright green hue. 
Of blue my next balloon shall be, 
The color of the sky, you see. 
And now my red and blue [ll mix 
To make a violet-—number six.” 
Have the children draw the pose from a child, 
afterward adding the balloons (Fig. 7). Here is 
another rhyme which may be recited to the children 
in giving such a lesson: 
«The man who toots the big tin horn and has the 
toy balloons to sell, 
I’m sure would have a lot of interesting things to tell. 
He must know the secret forests where the toy balloons 
all grow, 
And I think that when they get away, he knows just 
where they go. 
I wonder if they wander round until they get back 
home ? 
Or if the man up in the moon doesn’t sometimes cap- 
ture some ?

A most delightful lesson in color may be given by RAINBOW 
using a set of ‘‘rainbow dolls.” ‘There should be twelve pou 
dolls dressed in the six leading and six intermediate 
spectrum colors (Figs. 10 and 11). The children may 
play many games with them—games which are in reality 
the best of lessons, and the boys usually enjoy them 
as thoroughly as do the girls. Sometimes the various 
‘ > children choose the one wearing the “prettiest color.’ 
-'Then they are placed in a row on the chalk rail ‘in 
order of choice by the children. For instance, if the 
red doll is chosen, it is placed first in line. ‘Then some 
child chooses the doll most like red. It may be red- 
  orange or red-violet. Another follows and chooses the 
doll most like this last, and so on till the twelve dolls” 
are arranged in a row, showing color relationship. 
Talk about relatives and how relatives often resemble 
each other and how people are often named after their 
relatives. Tell them it is so with colors. Taking, 
say, red and orange, let them discover there is a color 
that looks much like red and‘also much like orange 
and which is named after its relatives, either red-

    PAINTING AND COLOR 77   
orange or orange-red. ‘The same comparisons may 
be made with the other colors. Sometimes the chil- 
dren play the rainbow dolls are going to a party, and 
each wants to wear flowers to match her dress. ‘The 
children discuss what flowers “‘red’’? should wear, 
what would match red-orange, ete. Sometimes they 
bring these flowers to school and arrange them in a 
“flower spectrum.” ‘The teacher may make a set of 
rainbow dolls by cutting out fashion pictures and 
tinting them in the spectrum colors. 
COLOR “Color Days” are always a joy to children. Golden- 
PAYS rod. or yellow leaves brought into the schoolroom on 
“Yellow Day’? seem to bring added sunshine to ‘the 
room and to the children. A “Green Day” in the 
spring when the leaves first appear furnishes oppor- 
tunity for a similar color exercise. Let every child 
bring or wear something ‘having the color which is 
chosen for the day. On one occasion, when visiting 
the schools of a large city, the writer found them cele- 
brating “Yellow Day” in one of the attractive new 
buildings, located in the better residence’ section of 
the city. All the rooms were lovely, and in one every 
girl wore a butterfly bow of yellow crepe paper, and 
the boys wore yellow rosettes made of the same material. 
‘There were masses of yellow flowers, and the children 
were very happy. In the afternoon of the same day 
she visited a school in a slum district, and here again 
it was “Yellow Day.’? The teachers had taken pains 
to get such flowers as could be had, but the children

bits of ribbon, brought can labels or bits of faded cloth. 
One child had a bit of yellow string which he presented 
as his contribution. 
There is no better exercise adapted to children 
for the free use of rich glowing colors than those which 
aim at stained glass effects, and the children delight 
in the varied and marvelous color combinations which 
may be produced by mixing red, yellow, and blue. 
Have children first dampen each cake of paint, letting 
the water remain on them while the teacher paints 
quickly a stained glass panel before them (Fig. 12). 
Do this by first dampening the paper with the brush 
or a small bit of cloth dipped in water. On the moist 
surface drop rich spots of red, yellow, and blue, tip- 
ping the paper so that the moisture will carry the 
paint and cause the colors to flow together. Do not 
work too long with it, as too much flowing will cause 
the colors to get brown or gray/ In this connection 
the writer recalls an interesting incident which was 
related to her. The children of a primary room had 
been painting sunset effects. They had also learned 
a little poem in their language work which contained 
the line “Blue eyes came from heaven.” Some of 
the children noticed that the teacher had brown eyes 
instead of blue, and seemed puzzled to know where 
she came from, as obviously only “blue eyes came 
from heaven.’ One little fellow whose sunset colors 
had become hopelessly mixed, exclaimed, “I know! 
Miss B. came from heaven just at sunset and the 
colors got mixed.”

If the teacher can do a stained glass effect as 
suggested, she can” get delightful results from the 
children, and will be amazed at the variety of colors 
and the beautiful blendings which will come from 
their efforts. These exercises may be saved and 
utilized in making little booklet covers for the Special 
Days (Figs. 13, 14, 15, and 16), or book-marks\ 
(Figs. 17 and 18), or cornucopias (Fig. 19). A dark 
grayish tone of construction paper serves to bring out 
the bright hues of the decoration. In making the book- 
mark (Fig. 17), the star should ‘be pasted across the top 
  so that its lower edge only may slide over the leaf. 
  When making such markers as the one shown in Fig. 
18, have the children cut a stencil of gray paper and 
mount it over the colored paper. The bright stained 
glass colors will show through the openings with pleas- 
ing effect. The making of the butterfly cornucopia 
(Fig. 19) is described in detail under the Chapter on AY 
Special Days. 
Akin to the stained glass effects are the glowing 
little bonfires which the children paint in the Fall, 
and to which Stevenson refers in the lines — 
«Sing a song of Seasons 
Something bright in all E R 
Flowers in the Summer 
Fires in the Fall.” 
They first “build the fire’? by painting a few tiny 
crooked sticks. Then they paint with clear water 
  that spot where they are going to paint the fire. Next 
they turn the paper upside down and by putting a

stroke of rich red and yellow near the sticks, and 
' letting the colors run as in the stained glass exercise, 
they get the result shown in Fig. 20. ‘These should be 
done very small, else their fire when finished will look 
like the burning of Baltimore or San Francisco. 
What child does not delight in the exquisite colors soap 
to be seen in soap bubbles? Let the children blow hee G 
soap bubbles and watch the lovely colors. Then let 
them paint a page of bubbles. Make each bubble 
by first painting a freehand circle of water, and before 
this dries, drop in a tiny bit of color, letting it run as 
in the stained glass lesson. Only faint color is used 
this time (Fig. 21). 
The prism is a delight to the children, and it brings THE 
the “Rainbow Colors’ right into the schoolroom. cds 
Every primary room should be supplied with a glass 
prism. 
The spectrum colors may be represented by placing TissuE 
red, blue, and yellow tissue paper in the windows so EerES 
that the light falls through them. By overlapping 
various sheets of paper, every color is produced. For 
instance, orange is produced by one thickness each of 
red and yellow. If red-orange is desired, it may be 
obtained by using two sheets of red over one of yellow, 
etc. These exercises will prove a joy to all and will 
pave the way to the more formal study of color in the 
upper grades.

_THE 
, DOLL 
HOUSE Vil. MAKING AND DECORATING 
Whether we call it Constructive Design, Industrial 
Work, Manual Art, or simply Making in the 
Primary Grades, it is now conceded to be an essential 
factor in ‘arousing the interest and developing the 
imagination and inventive faculty of children. CWhen 
one of our great merchant princes said “Education 
should consist of Headucation and Handucation,” he 
voiced in original terms the sentiment of all who are 
giving thoughtful attention to our present day educa- 
tional problems. Someone has aptly said “the hands 
of the child are often the sensitive feelers with which 
he lays hold of higher things in his growing time.” 
The croaking pessimist who predicted that hand work 
is heard no > would crowd out the “regular studies’ 
more. If he still croaks, his weak minor note is lost 
in the happy chorus of millions of boys and girls whose 
school work has been vitalized by giving intelligent 
direction to their motor impulses and activities through 
a variety of constructive exercises. 
The constru¢tive work of the lower grades naturally 
bases vitself upon the interests and activities of the 
child, and the doll house, that delight of every childish 
heart, has done not a little to furnish -a nucleus for 
the making of a great variety of objects. In many of 
our cities, the doll house has become almost an “‘insti- 
tution’’ in every First and Second Grade, ‘and the 
81
-P-A-G-E-114
  
  82 TALKS ON DRAWING 
furnishing of this house is a never-failing source of 
delight to the children. One finds all sorts and con- 
ditions of doll houses, from the one made from the 
humble orange crate, which is turned upon end and 
made to serve as a two-story cottage, to the finely 
constructed one with chimney, windows, and _stair- 
way, and which in reality is a miniature house. Four 
rectangular bandboxes glued together after the covers 
are removed may be used for a doll house with four 
corner rooms, having windows and doors cut in its 
wall and partitions. A table of any kind will make 
a convenient resting place for the house while the 
    ee aaa work goes on. The covers of the boxes may be 
= replaced by a large sheet of cardboard or glass for 
‘l , the roof, which may be removed whenever a new 
article of furniture is to be put in place. 
Sometimes the school janitor becomes interested in 
the toy-house, and if he is at all skillful with hammer and 
saw, there is no limit to what he may evolve from an old 
dry-goods box. Very often the larger boys in the upper 
grades make the doll houses for the primary children. 
This is done sometimes in connection with the Manual 
Training, but quite as frequently it is done at odd 
times out of school hours. A very imberesting use 
of this kind is pictured here (Figs. 1 and 2). was’. 
made by the school boys of one of our Western cities. 
As the house was to be built like those of the pioneer 
days, there was much searching of old books for pic- 
tures and descriptions of the early houses. Every part 
of the house was made by the boys and they be-

‘came positively enthusiastic in its construction. They 
gathered branches an inch in diameter which served 
for logs. ‘The bricks for the fireplace were made by 
the children of a Second Grade and were fired at a 
neighboring brick kiln. ‘The mortar and plaster were 
mixed by the boys, and the house when completed 
was furnished by the primary children. Standing in 
the lower hall, it is a splendid piece of community 
work in which every room in the school has partici- 
pated. ' 
Fig. 3 shows a doll house from another city. 
The house shown in Fig. 4 was made by pupils in one 
of the New York Schools. It is entirely different from 
the others and contains six rooms. The one shown in 
    Fig.. 5 was made in ore of the Iowa schools, and is 
quite unique in style, having open sides which make 4 
it especially convenient for furnishing. Another sug- 
‘gestive house is shown in Fig. 6. This was made in 
one of the Wisconsin schools. ‘That the doll house 
“should be furnished entirely by the children hardly 
needs to be said, yet occasionally a teacher loses sight 
of the educational value of this exercise entirely and, 
in her desire to make a fine showing, does so much 
herself that the value of the exercise to the pupils is 
greatly minimized. ‘This has been done to such an 
extent that some of the best Art Supervisors have felt 
that the doll house was not of sufficient value to justify 
its presence in the schoolroom. Certain it is that only 
as its furnishing is done by the children, does it serve 
its best educational purpose in the school. 
    
    
 
-P-A-G-E-116
        84 TALKS ON DRAWING   
After the doll house is completed and stands empty, 
it may be placed in a corner of the room, and the 
making for a time made to center around it. First 
come the drawing and painting lessons in which the 
children design the wall paper. Possibly a professional 
designer might hesitate to use the word “design”? in 
connection with the quavery little stripes, the queer 
sprangly flowers, and the ill-spaced brush stroke 
repeats, made by the children, but working’ happily 
“and earnestly they could not feel more important 
were they professional mural decorators. Figs. 7 and 
8 are reproduced from children’s designs. The child 
whose design is chosen for a room in the doll house 
is as proud as a king. As it would be too tedious 
and also undesirable for him to paint the paper for 
the whole house, the teacher selects several assistants 
and each paints enough paper like the chosen design 
for one wall of a room. Sometimes the teacher cuts 
little stencils from the children’s designs, and the chil- 
dren use these stencils in doing the surface covering. 
The children may be led to see that a design which 
is very pretty for a bedroom may not be at all suitable 
for a kitchen, where plainer walls are better. The 
more geometric planning of oilcloth or linoleum for 
the kitchen floor adds variety to the design work 
(Fig. 9). Rugs may be woven for the floors of the 
various rooms. Sometimes these are merely woven 
with strips of paper which the children have 
cut (Fig. 10), and sometimes with raffia, chenille 
(Fig. 11), real carpet yarn, or narrow strips of PAPERING

cloth, the latter like veritable though diminutive rag 
carpets. \ 
Bits of dimity or scrim may be used for the window’ 
curtains. Sometimes the childish hands fashion queer 
little stencil designs for the curtains (Fig. 12), or paint 
the borders with free-hand brush strokes. (Fig. 13). 
Reed and bead portieres for the wide doors leading 
from room to room may be made by stringing straws 
and kindergarten beads. 
For the making work of very young children, wood 
is out of the question, and heavy construction or bogus 
paper or light weight cardboard seems to be the most 
suitable material, because it is easily bent or cut by 
the small fingers, holds its shape well and is at the 
same time inexpensive. Before attempting the furni- 
ture—indeed before the children do any original 
making—they should be given a few dictation 
lessons. 
The making from dictation of a square or oblong 
box or basket (Figs. 14, 15, 16,17), or some other 
equally simple object based on the “sixteen square 
fold”’ furnishes excellent preliminary work. These 
boxes and baskets may be decorated with simple brush 
stroke borders and used for Christmas or May Day, 
if desired. The time spent in thoroughly mastering 
these early dictation exercises is well repaid in the 
original work which is developed later on, and as the 
sixteen square fold is the basis of much of the con- 
struction work, it is important that it be well under- 
stood. *

  86 “TALKS ON DRAWING   
In giving the first dictation lesson, it will be a help 
to the children if the teacher draws an oblong on the 
front chalkboard, calling this oblong the top of -her 
desk, and faces it, as she gives her directions, just 
as the pupils face their desks. It will be an advantage 
if she uses a large square of paper, making each fold 
as she dictates to the children. She should go so 
slowly that the children may easily follow each step 
in the folding. After this she may test the pupils by 
collecting the first squares and having each child fold 
one independently. After each child is provided with 
a square of paper, the dictation in the first instance 
may proceed somewhat as follows: 
Place square so that its front edge rests on the 
front edge of the desk. Fold front edge of square. 
over so that the front and back edges are even. Crease 
firmly, using finger nail for pressing. Open. Fold 
front edge to middle crease. Open. Turn the back 
edge around so that it becomes the front edge, and 
fold to middle crease. Turn the paper so that these 
creases run from front to back of the desk, and then 
repeat the dictation for the other folds. The children 
will find their paper has been creased into sixteen 
squares. 
To make the square box, cut away all of the squares 
which are indicated by the dark tone in Fig. 18, then 
cut on the heavy lines and fold and paste. Fig. 19 
shows how two squares are cut away in making the 
oblong box, and Figs. 20 and 21 show the patterns of 
- a square and oblong basket.

  MAKING AND DECORATING 87   
The children soon discover that what they learn 
in the making of these boxes and baskets may be 
applied to the making of innumerable things. The 
creative impulse is strong in most children, and while 
there‘is need of much guidance by the teacher, she 
should always leave ample opportunity for them to 
work out their own ideas. Figs. 22, 23, 24, and 25 
show some of the original designs worked out by four 
small pupils. ‘The teacher suggested how to use the 
square box for the body of the bureau. She also sug- 
gested how oblong boxes may be made to serve as 
drawers for the dresser, but the knobs or handles, 
shelves and mirrors, as well as the general spacings, 
were worked out by each child for himself according 
to his own ideas of fitness and pleasing effect. Could 
we show the entire set of fifty bureaus from this school, 
it would be found that the results reveal quite a degree 
of creative ability along with more or less skillful 
manual manipulation. Of course there were a few 
children who, at the end of the lesson, had only a 
poor, battered, crumpled object to show in place of 
a bureau, but these children were the very ones who 
needed such work most, and possibly the next time 
the teacher gave a lesson of this kind, she seated these 
children in a little group near the front of the room 
and made a special effort to help them. 
It may be well to state that for such making lessons 
it is necessary to give more time than is given to the 
ordinary drawing work. ‘Teachers usually plan to put 
several periods*of drawing together when making of

this kind is to be done. This gives time for distribu- 
tion of scissors, paper, and paste, for general sugges- 
tions, and for careful clearing up after the lesson. 
The paste is usually provided by putting a little on 
small pieces of paper placed on each desk of every 
other row so that two children may paste from one 
desk. 
In the lesson on making cradles, the same origi- 
nality is shown. Figs. 26, 27, and 28 show only 
a few of the ideas worked out by childish minds 
and hands. Every child in the room made a cradle, 
and while many made the old Puritan cradle 
(Fig. 26), as dictated by their teacher, they were 
encouraged to devise and construct other styles 
of cradles. The chairs and sofa (Figs. 29, 30, 31, 
and 82) are just as interesting both in form and 
construction, and possibly chairs constructed on these 
lines would be fully’ as comfortable as much of the 
so-called art furniture which is shown in the stores. 
Again, we see how the square box was used as a basis 
for the original making of the piano (Fig. 33); how 
the worker labored over the making of the music rack, 
and the keyboard whose tiny keys were drawn on a 
strip of white paper which he pasted in place. The 
making of the kitchen stove (Fig. 34) was full of 
delight to the children, inasmuch as those who did 
especially well were allowed to use a heavy sheet of 
black paper instead of the bogus paper with which 
their construction work was usually done. The child 
whose stove is here reproduced was especially skillful.

  MAKING AND DECORATING 89   
During one of these lessons, given to Second Grade 
children which the writer observed, one little girl held 
up the paper chair on which she was patiently labor- 
ing, examined it critically and then looked at her 
teacher. When the teacher asked her what she thought 
of it, she replied, “I think it is awfully un-neat.”” The 
word was very expressive and deserves coining. ‘There 
is very little petty jealousy among young children, 
and though each child works earnestly and laboriously 
and with much puckering of his round face and much 
activity of his chubby fingers in the hope that his 
chair, table, dresser, or stove may be chosen for the 
doll house, the children who are not so fortunate as 
to win this honor, often quite swell with pride as they 
point to the work of some other boy or girl. The 
making of such objects may not necessarily depend 
upon doll houses to be furnished. Indeed much of 
that reproduced here comes from a city where it is 
not deemed advisable to use the doll house. 
In this same city we observed: a lesson in trans- 
portation (Figs. 35 to 47 inclusive), which would 
delight any primary teacher. Along with the making 
of various articles of furniture, the children had been 
given a dictation lesson for making a little cart or 
wagon, and had learned that the box ‘principle enters 
into their construction. ‘They had also discovered that 
the wheels and shafts have to be made of two thick- 
nesses of paper in order to be firm enough. The 
teacher led the children to talk about ways in which 
people travel. ‘They told her of trips they had made.

This one had been down the river in a steamboat, 
another had ridden on her father’s express wagon, 
while others had traveled in street cars, automobiles, etc. 
The result was most interesting. Canoes, sleds, autos, 
street cars, indeed, almost every conceivable vehicle 
and many inconceivable to “grown ups’’ were made 
by the children. In such lessons it is quite a study 
to watch the children as they work out various ways 
of putting things together. One boy puts his wheels 
on by rolling a piece of paper so as to form a 
stiff rod for the axle, which he inserts in his wheels. 
Another conceives the idea of pasting a band across 
the bottom of his cart or auto, bending the ends of 
this band downward and pasting the wheels to these. 
As a rule, the girls are neater about this work, but 
do not show the same inventive power, although they 
evince the same interest. Only a few samples of these 
objects can be shown here, and these very much 
reduced in size, but they give an idea of how such 
_lessons may be worked out in a school where con- 
structive design is taught logically and carefully, and 
with a desire to develop creative power. 
Very young children take little interest in merely 
making designs, that is, working out problems in 
what the artists technically term “pure design” 
without reference to definite application. ‘They take 
genuine pleasure, however, in decorating their Thanks-

only a few examples of simple decoration from First

been led to see the beauty of simplicity, as illustrated 
by the needle book (Fig. 48) with its single broad 
marginal line and brush stroke at corners. It is a 
useful little thing, too, with its flannel leaves sewed in 
between the two heavy paper covers. We see the same 
simplicity in both the match scratch (Fig. 49), and the 
. blotter pad (Fig. 50). 
Figures 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, and 56 show some 
of the decorations which the children of the Second 
and Third Grades made for their box covers. 
There are several ways of working out such designs. 
One way is to fold and cut the paper as in the 
making of “snow flakes.” This is the easiest for 
very young children, but as the best results are often 
accidental, it is not strictly speaking design. To 
illustrate: The children have made square boxes 
which they wish to decorate. Each child is given a 
square of thin paper the size of his box. He folds it 
on its diameters and diagonals, and cuts it in some 
such way as shown by Figs. 57, 58, and 59. He opens 
his paper and finds he has forms shown by Figs. 69, 
61, or 62, according as he has cut. Laying this stencil 
on his box cover, before the cover is pasted, he paints 
through the holes with this effect (Figs. 63, 64, and 65). 
The box illustrated by Fig. 55 was done by a Second 
Grade pupil in they above described.

  92 MAKING AND DECORATING   
This does very well in the beginning, but in order 
to have a method by which children actually plan for 
' beauty, and by which they design in the true sense, the 
following is suggested, which was probably used in 
working out all of the designs here shown, except Fig. 
55. Assume that the children have a square surface to 
work upon. Using a ruler, they mark off the edges 
in quarter-inch dots connecting with very light lines, 
which divide the surface into many little squares. 
With these lines and squares to guide them, they may 
work out a great variety of designs, Fig. 66 shows 
a square decorated in this way, and the light “work- 
ing lines’? have been left in one corner to show the 
method. ‘The first lesson should be dictated from the 
blackboard. Cheap paper ruled in squares of different 
. sizes is carried by many school supply houses, and the 
children delight in working out designs upon this 
paper. This is excellent seat work.

COME VII. WORKING IN CLAY 
There is no medium richer in possibilities for the 
form training of children than clay. It responds 
almost instantly to the touch of their young fingers, 
and by working with it they obtain an idea of solidity 
and form which may be obtained in no other way. 
Then, too, the very nature of the clay discotrages a 
tendency toward detail in execution to which children 
usually give undue importance in their drawing, and 
compels them to work for large effects. This fact 
alone is a strong argument for the use of clay in every 
primary school. 
The small expense incident to the use of clay 
should also be taken into account. A very small 
expenditure at the beginning of the school year fur- 
nishes material for the entire year, as the clay, with 
proper care, may be used over and over. Sixty pounds 
of clay should furnish a primary room of fifty pupils 
with enough material for a year. 
An objection sometimes urged by teachers against 
the use of clay is the difficulty of keeping it in the 
proper condition. This ceases to be a serious objec- 
tion, however, when one knows how to care for it, 
and especially if the teacher is on friendly terms with 
the janitor, who, busy as he is, can easily find five 
minutes a day to care for the clay. A tactful teacher will 
know how to handlé the situation. Someone has said: 
93
-P-A-G-E-126
  94 TALKS ON DRAWING   
«Man is naught but a lump of clay 
Gifted with hopes and fears 
And woman can mould him any way 
If she softens him with her tears.” 
However, no teacher will have to resort to this melo- 
dramatic way of attaining her purpose. Even should 
conditions render it impossible for the janitor to 
attend to the clay, it is not difficult for any teacher 
to keep it in condition for her own work. 
Clay may be bought in bulk by the barrel or half 
barrel, in powdered form, in five-pound bricks, or in 
the shape of prepared clay or plasticine. The last 
named form would be ideal were it not for the cost, 
the clay having been mixed with some oily prepara- 
tion which keeps it plastic and workable all the time. 
To prepare the powdered clay, it should be placed in 
bags of thick cloth or canvas and suspended in a 
crock half full of water over night. It is then ready 
to be pounded or kneaded into shape and cared for 
as described below. 
If the clay is in bulk or in brick form, it must be 
broken into small pieces, put into a large stone jar 
or crock and nearly covered with water. After some 
hours the clay will have become thoroughly saturated 
and should then be put into a strong bag and pounded 
or kneaded into plastic condition. It should then be 
put back into the crock, pierced with pencil holes, 
sprinkled with water, covered with a moist cloth and 
the jar carefully covered. When desired for use, the 
clay may be cut into lumps of uniform size by means

In some places the clay is kept in “working condition”’ 
all the year, while in many other places all of the model- 
ing work is done in two or three consecutive weeks 
in order to save the extra labor of keeping the material 
always in readiness. Educationally the first method 
is by far the better, but practically the latter method 
is often necessary on account of conditions. 
Before giving a modeling lesson, each desk should 
be covered either with paper or oilcloth. If news- 
papers are used, they should be thrown away after 
the lesson, but if heavy manila paper is available, it 
may be cut into pieces the size of the desk and the 
same papers made to serve for many lessons. Oil- 
cloth is the best material for this purpose. Slates 
are also frequently used. In some schools pie tins 
are used as trays on which the modeling is done. 
Clay, however well prepared for modeling, soon 
becomes dry and hard when worked over and over in 
the children’s hands. The modeling lessons, there- 
fore, should be carried on with a good “swing” so 
as to allow no time for useless handling. 
A few of the best pieces should be allowed to dry 
‘that they may be kept for a permanent exhibit. After 
the lesson the clay should be gathered up and taken 
to the basement to be pounded and put away again 
. in a crock as heretofore described. 
* PURIFY-

CLAY Frequent handling by many fingers and confining 
the clay in close jars to keep it plastic may cause it 
to become musty after a time. For this reason it

should be given an occasional sun-bath by spreading 
it on boards out of doors and letting the sun and 
wind purify it. When thoroughly dry, break it into 
small pieces and put it away for future use as when 
first purchased. ; 
Much of the clay modeling in the lower grades 
is done in connection with the History and Language 
Work. The rude bits of pottery which the children 
fashion in connection with the Hiawatha Tale, or the’ 
Esquimo Agloos, and the animals which they make 
to illustrate the Agoonac story come under this head. 
We have seen some especially delightful work in this 
line. The Esquimo village always forms an interest- 
ing piece of community work with its blocks of ice, 
polar bears, sledges, and Agloos, all modeled in clay. 
The writer once visited a room where the children 
were busily engaged in a unique piece of community 
work. They were building a Pilgrim house. Some 
were modeling the logs and some the chimney blocks, 
and already the building had begun to look quite 
like a house. Standing on the sand-table, it was to 
be the nucleus of much of their cutting, modeling, and 
construction work. We have seen the Old Plymouth 
Settlement, a Street in Holland, and Robinson Crusoe’s - 
Island illustrated largely in clay. We have also seen 
a series of modeling lessons carried on in’ connection 
with the Christmas Story and with results that brought 
evident joy to the children. 
They were told about that strange Eastern coun- 
try where the shepherds guide their flocks to grazing

grounds often far from the home fold and how care- 
fully they guard their sheep from the wolves, and how 
the faithful shepherd dog helps his master protect the 
sheep from any prowling foe. 
The sand-table became for the time an Oriental 
pasture upon which the children built a fold for the 
sheep by sticking twigs upright in the sand to form 
a circular stockade. On one side was the opening 
where the sheep might enter and at this opening 
watched the faithful shepherd dog. Within the fold 
were the sheep and lambs resting after their long day 
of grazing. In the margin are shown two of the lambs 
and also one of the dogs which guarded the entrance 
to the fold. They are not wonderful. They show 
simply actual work of childish fingers guided by a 
teacher, retaining to a large degree the “child 
heart.” 
Nor did the lessons cease with the modeling of 
things connected with the shepherd story, for there 
were the wise men who came across the desert on their 
camels, and from pictures or toys the children gained 
an idea of these strange, awkward animals and great 
was their delight in modeling them. They fashioned 
them in a recumbent position, as it would have been 
impossible for the children to model their long slender 
legs in clay. The pottery reproduced on the margin 
of another page of this chapter was a feature of these 
lessons, for the children were told about the scarcity 
of water in the desert and about the water jars which 
are fashioned from the clay of that country,

Among the simpler forms from which children FRUIT 
may model, nothing better can be found than fruits ea 
and vegetables. In choosing specimens for this pur- BLES 
pose it is best to avoid those that are too nearly sym- 
metrical. For instance, if an orange were selected, 
the children would be likely to merely roll a mass of 
clay between their palms till it became spherical and | 
call it an orange. If, however, a pear, a carrot or 
a beet is chosen, their irregular shapes will not only 
arouse the child’s interest but will stimulate greater 
skill and ingenuity in his modeling. Whenever possi- 
ble, it is best for each child to have the object to be 
modeled on his desk, as he will gain a better notion : 
of its form by handling it. 
In modeling, the children may use a clay tablet 
and merely show the form in “relief’’ upon this tablet, 
or they may model “in the round.” » These two ways 
are plainly shown in the pear and the beet here repro- 
duced. (Figs. 8 and 9.) 
Although teachers frequently require First and MODELING 
TWIGS 
  Second Grade children to model twigs, such work 
may well be postponed until the Third Grade. It 
should never be attempted without first modeling 
a tablet on which to work. The twigs chosen for 
such lessons should be rugged and coarse and not 
fine and dainty in form with flat leaves. The clay 
tablet should not be merely a slab of clay cut from 
the large lump with some mechanical instrument. It 
should be roughly modeled by the child with his own 
hands, afid exactness and smoothness of surface are 
   
-P-A-G-E-131

quite non-essential. Each child should have a twig 
on his desk placed in the position which he thinks the 
most pleasing. He should draw a line on the tablet 
to represent the slant of the stem and upon this line 
he should model his twig, putting the clay on bit by 
bit, trying to show where the edge of the leaf curls 
over, where the burrs or nuts or bursting leaves stand 
highest and where they rest close to the tablet. 
MODELING It is no longer considered desirable to have chil- 
Nye dren model geometric solids such as the square prism FORMS 8 a I , 
the ovoid, the cylinder, etc. In the clay, as in the 
drawing work, objects may be selected which resemble 
these types and which carry greater interest for the 
child. He will model bricks for the Christmas chim- 
ney with far more enthusiasm than could be aroused 
by the square prism, and he will enter into the model- 
ing of eggs at Easter time with a zest such as 
no wooden ovoid could have produced. <A football 
appeals to him more strongly than the most perfect 
wooden ellipsoid, and he will labor to model the 
cylindrical boiler and smokestack of a toy engine, 
or the cannon with its spherical balls with a joy and 
eagerness which the abstract wooden models could 
never evoke. 
MODELING As has been suggested in another paragraph of 
Daas a so this chapter, the children delight in fashioning from 
the clay, bowls, jars and other simple pottery forms, 
and these lessons may often come as the outgrowth 
of the History and Language Work. In modeling a 
bowl, there are three’ methods which may be used by

the child with equal ease and with the same general 
results. He may model a circular tablet and then 
around its edge, bit by bit, build up the wall of his 
dish, shaping it as he goes; he may use the “coil 
method”’ by making short strips of the soft clay, mold- 
ing the first to the base and building up the bowl, 
layer on layer, and working the whole into a solid 
wall as he goes, or he may take a lump of clay and 
by pressing his thumbs into the mass, form.a cavity, 
proceeding next by pressing and molding the clay 
outward or inward to form the curved sides of his 
bowl. When modeling vase forms or pitchers, if the 
child wishes to rhake a handle, he should be taugat 
not merely to stick the handle on the body, but niold 
it to the body so that it will be strong and solid if 
fired in a kiln. 4 
In a few schools where there is a kiln for firing 
and where the regular potters’ clay may be used as 
an occasional “special treat,” the children have made 
little jars which after firing have been put to actual 
service. Each child has filled his jar with earth in 
which he has placed the seeds for his nature lessons. 
It is a great pleasure to him to have his own jar, to 
plant and water his seeds and watch their growth 
from day to day. Usually, however, the children 
fashion their pottery from common clay which shares 
the fate of their other creations by being broken up 
for use in other lessons.

fowls and rabbits, plaster casts, Teddy Bears, and 
stuffed animals, it is not difficult to find sugges- 
tions for subjects. Bears and elephants are especially 
good because of their clumsy legs which support 
the body so well, and because these animals are 
so accurately reproduced in toys which are easily 
available. 
> Modeling from “‘live’’ animals is interesting and 
the rabbit furnishes one of the best subjects. Turtles 
are also easily modeled. Let the children try to tell 
the story of the “Hare and the Tortoise” in clay. 
The writer once saw a baby alligator serving for both 
a nature and a clay lesson. Animals with slender legs 
should not be attempted unless represented in reclin- 
ing positions or modeled on some framework, which 
is usually too difficult for small children. We have 
seen children laboring to model a clay duck standing 
on its two slender clay legs, till they were utterly dis- 
couraged, one small boy saying to his duck as he gave 
its lee a vicious thump, “There, TH give you the 
rheumatism and I guess that'll make your legs stiff 
enough.” , 
In modeling animals or people, sculptors always 
erect a skeleton or framework of wood or metal, and 
upon and about this mold their clay. This suggests 
a plan which may be utilized where cornstalks are 
obtainable. The cornstalks may be cut into lengths, 
and the children can fashion them into frameworks 
on which to model. ‘The accompanying illustration 
shows this quite clearly. (Fig. 20.)

Children are sometimes allowed to use bits of 
slender twigs, toothpicks, or pieces of wire to rein- 
force the legs of their birds or animals. In case a 
standing pose is attempted, a clay tablet should first 
be fashioned for the model of animal or person to 
stand upon.

  IX. CUTTING FROM PAPER 
There is probably no kind of form training for 
young children about which teachers differ more 
widely and whose educational value has been longer 
a question of dispute. This is especially the case 
with freehand cutting. Teachers who defend this 
work maintain that the nature of the medium and 
the process compel the child to a conception of the 
whole mass and therefore to the elimination of petty 
details which is desirable in early form expression. 
On the other hand, those in opposition claim that the 
same training for big effects may be secured through 
the use of clay or the making of brush and ink sil- 
houettes. Its friends call attention to the disciplinary 
value of concentrated attention which goes’ with this 
work, since any lapse of attention or slip of the scissors 
results in mistakes which cannot be easily rectified. 
Those less friendly point to the many children who 
are required to hack out meaningless shapes of paper 
‘under the pretense of “busy work’? and remark that 
it is a pitiful waste of time and material. 
It must be admitted that unless the work in paper- 
cutting is carefully planned for the purpose of training 
and not merely to keep the children “busy”? it will 
prove wasteful and valueless. ) The author is a strong* 
believer in the occasional paper-cutting lesson.

Freehand paper-cutting is commonly done in three ways 
om : 3 OF ways—from dictation, from objects or pictures and woprxinc 
  from imagination. The dictation exercises develop 
power of true and quick observation and are excellent 
for stimulating attention. The cutting from objects 
or pictures develops.feeling for proportions and masses, 
_ and the imaginative or illustrative cutting trains the 
same powers that are exercised in_ illustrative 
drawing. 
To present such a lesson well, the teacher should CUTTING 
plan the steps sadidty before dictating to the children, ere, 
so that each step may be clear in her own mind. Say TION 
you plan to cut out a boat in connection with some 
language lesson relating to the Pilgrims. Each child 
is given a small square of paper while you use a large 
square. After telling the children to watch very care- 
fully what you do, you make the first cut (See dark 
line, Fig. 4). The children cut their squares in the 
same way, laying ‘their scissors down after each oper- 
ation, for, if allowed to hold them, their attention is 
diverted. Fig. 5 shows the next cut, the children try-   
       
-P-A-G-E-139
  
CUTTING FROM PAPER 107   
ing meantime to guess what they are making. he 
cut in Fig. 6 must be very carefully made so that the 
mast and sail shall not be detached from the boat. 
When the step shown by Fig. 7 is reached, the children 
will know beyond question what they are making. 
Figures 8 and 9 show the completion of the cutting, 
and, if time remains, smaller boats may be cut from 
the oblong which was left after cutting as in Fig. 5. 
Any other simple boat form may be dictated as easily 
as this. If the teacher wishes to increase the chil- 
dren’s pleasure in this exercise, she may step to the 
chalkboard and with a few strokes of the crayon 
laid sidewise indicate a sweep of river or sea, and 
upon this background mount a few of the best boats 
(Fig. 13), using a mere touch of paste. In mounting 
the boats, lead the children to discover that the plac- 
ing of the large and small boats may be made to tell 
the story of nearness and farness. If two tones of 
paper are available, the children may make pretty 
little posters to use in decorating Pilgrim books or 
Christmas calendars. Much variety may result from 
varying the shape of the oblong, the location of the 
horizon line and the position of the boat or boats. 
This may also be made a lesson in the simple prin- 
ciples of composition, for even primary children may 
be taught to see that if the boat is placed exactly in 
the middle of the space, and the skyline cuts the 
picture into two equal parts (Fig. 10), the picture is 
not as pleasing as with the arrangement shown in 
. Figs. 11 and 12.

Last night I sailed in my paper ship, 
I sailed away and away; 
And never did sailor sail so far, 
And never was sail so gay; 
I sailed away to an unknown land, 
Away, on an unknown sea, 
Where all the people were dolls, my dear, 
And all of them talked to me. 
Another good dictation exercise is the cutting of 
the key as shown in Figs. 14 to 18. After cutting the 
key from dictation, the children may like to cut key 
rings, cutting keys of various kinds and putting them 
on the key rings. 
The teacher should encourage the children to give 
reasons why all keys are not made alike, why they 
have holes in the top, and why the top is rounded 
instead of sharp-cornered. There are many pretty 
poems and songs relating to keys which may be used 
in connection with this lesson. ‘Two such are reprinted 
below.

When at the tabie, “If you please,” 
I take from off my bunch of keys.

After learning from the dictation exercises and the 
circle-cutting practice to handle their materials and 
that their scissors may be made to show the shape of 
things, the children may begin cutting from objects. 
In this work the teacher should try to get the children 
to tell the truth about proportions. The first objects 
should be simple in form. Vase forms are good. Use 
two when possible, differing in proportions and shape 
(Figs. 19 and 20). A couple of contrasting pitchers 
might be quite different in size as well as in shape.

This would make another interesting exercise in cut- 
ting. Other suggestions are given in the marginal 
drawings (Figs. 21 to 29). The same care should be 
used in placing objects for cutting as for a drawing 
or painting lesson. 
If potted plants are used as objects for cutting 
lessons (Fig. 28), those showing only a few leaves 
should be chosen. Of course the subject chosen for 
a paper-cutting lesson should be “seasonable.’’ ‘The 
garden implements are fine for spring, the umbrella 
for April days, and such things as sleds or snow shoes 
are good for winter. Fig. 30 shows the cutting of a 
sled while Fig. 31 shows how it appears when creased 
and_ bent. : 
Cutting from a pose is often practiced, in which 
case the subjects chosen should be such as are suit- 
able for brush and ink silhouettes. Some toys are 
fine for cutting-lessons. Among the best are toy 
steamboats, sailboats, street cars, fire engines, trains, etc. 
The accompanying reproduction (Fig.34) shows how the 
cutting of engines and cars from toys or pictures may 
be made the nucleus for a decidedly interesting series 
of lessons which may be mounted in poster form, 
much to the delight of the children, The ones shown 
here were done by Normal students, but the author 
has frequently tried such lessons with primary chil- 
dren and found them very stimulating to the interest, 
observation, and memory as well as to the imagination. 
Much originality is developed in ai course of such 
lessons. Each large poster should be a piece of com-

munity work and it is well to let as many children 
as possible participate rather than the few talented 
children who are always in evidence. Animals may § 
be cut from toys or from pictures, and wonderful 
menageries, circus parades, and Noah’s arks come 
from the hands of the children. The illustrations on 
Page 103 show some of the best efforts of the chil- 
dren in one room as mounted in poster form by their 
teacher. Long strips of ingrain wall paper were used 
for the mounting, and gave an impression of great 
length to the parade as it hung on the schoolroom 
wall. A real circus or parade in town has inspired 
many a fine lesson of this kind.

One teacher we know constructed a Noah’s ark 
from cardboard in something the same manner as the 
little houses are made by the children (See Page 117), 
and in this ark were kept all of the best animal cut- 
tings made by the children until taken out for mount-

Another teacher with an original turn of mind 
utilized the passing of a hand-organ man and his 
monkey as material for a freehand cutting lesson 
(Fig. 32), using the lines of Robert Louis Stevenson 
to accompany it. 
“Have you seen the organ grinder with a monkey on 
a string ? 
He stands upon the sidewalk and makes the music 
ring. 
And all the little children around him dance and play, 
And have a very merry time before he goes away.” 
In mounting these cuttings, each child was allowed © 
to use a bit of cord to fasten the monkey to the organ, 
and this touch of realism was highly delightful to the 
pupils. The idea was fine, but the cuttings of the 
children could probably have been made more “‘alive”’

by means of action poses in connection with the lesson 
(Fig. 33). i 
Many teachers require children to cut from imagina- 
tion without any previous training. It is much better 
to lead up to this by means of some dictation and 
object cutting. When the children have done some 
such exercises as those described in the foregoing 
paragraphs, they may begin telling their stories from 
imagination with scissors and paper in very much 
the same manner as with brush or pencil.. The sug- 
gestions given in the Chapter on Drawing from 
Imagination are almost as applicable to cutting from 
imagination. 
Paper cutting cannot be profitably practiced for 
desk work until the children have had quite a number 
of carefully planned and carefully directed lessons. 
To start the children the first day of school by giving 
them scissors and paper and the simple direction “Cut 
2 anything you like” results too often only in littering 
of floor and desks, and waste of material. Worse 
than this, it gives children the impression that so long 
as they are cutting, although they do this with no 
definite purpose, it is satisfactory to the teacher. 
When children have once grasped the fact that they 
can tell the truth about things with their scissors, 
the cutting becomes a profitable kind of busy work. 
We once observed such work in a school located near 
a vacant lot which was fairly twinkling with daisies. 
Each child had a daisy on his desk, and with scissors 
and crayon was making pictures of ‘Grandma Daisy”

THANKS- 
GIVING X. SPECIAL DAYS 
Most teachers are on the alert for suggestions 
relating to drawing and making for special days and 
seasons, and the following may add something to the 
teacher’s resources for these occasions. It is scarcely 
necessary to say that each teacher will probably wish 
to choose those exercises which seem best adapted to 
her particular schoolroom conditions, and which are 
most in keeping with her general plan of work. 
The first special day in the school year is Thanks- 
giving, and much of the children’s work at this time, 
including the drawing and making, may well be made 
to center around the ‘Thanksgiving thought which is 
suggestive, among other things, of Colonial life, Indians, 
ete. ‘The little rhyme given below is a great favorite 
with the children: 
SIX LITTLE TURKEYS 
I. 
Six little turkeys, all in a row! 
Now what they were hatched for, they didn’t know. 
Our grandma did, but she wouldn’t tell. 
She watered and fed them every day well,

She was fattening them for Thanksgiving day.

She knew that when Thanksgiving day came around 
The very best place for each would be found. 
  There are Thanksgiving poses, too, in which a 
few simple devices serve to make a Puritan lad (Fig. 
1) or lass (Fig. 2) out of a Twentieth Century boy 
or girl. By cutting from heavy manila paper a large 
circle like Fig. 3 for a crown and pasting the crown (Fig. 
4) to the brim by means of the laps, a Puritan hat may 
easily be devised. A paper collar and large paper 
buckles greatly enhance the effect in the eyes of the 
children, while a toy gun and a mackintosh cape add 
the finishing touches. ‘The girl may be given a hood, 
an apron, a square cloth folded for a kerchief and 
her older sister’s skirt, which makes a regular little 
  woman of her, while the knitting in her hand com- 
pletes the domestic effect.

For the painting work there is the much used 
pumpkin and other vegetables equally good, such as 
carrots and turnips. The children usually paint mere 
round daubs of orange to represent the pumpkin, and 
it is almost impossible to get them to put any indi- 
viduality into it, making it tall, thin, or “roly poly” 
according to its character. It is quite evident that 
all pumpkins look alike to the boys and girls of the 
lower grades. 
In the constructive work there is the Puritan cradle 
(See Page 88) or the pilgrim house made of bogus 
paper (Fig. 5). To make the house, fold a square of 
paper in the way usually designated as the “sixteen 
square fold,” and described in the Chapter on Making 
and Decorating. Then cut on the creases indicated 
by the heavy lines in Fig. 6. The dotted line indi- 
cates the ridge of the roof, and when the children 
fold on this line they soon discover how to paste the 
laps under so as to form a house. The cutting 
of tiny doors and windows makes the effect quite 
realistic. 
We know a clever teacher who utilized her sand- 
table for a Thanksgiving scene which was a source 
of much pleasure to the children. The thought was 
the bounty of autumn. From a square of heavy dark 
red paper she folded and cut a large barn in the 
same way the children’s houses are made. The 
children made diminutive corn shocks of raffia, and 
modeled little pumpkins. From dry twigs or small 
branches, trees were made, and from their limbs

cranberries were hung to represent apples. ‘The 
crowning. feature of the exercise was the farmer 
and his family modeled in clay and wheeling loads of 
apples or pumpkins in wheelbarrows made of bogus 
paper. Every child made a clay figure and a wheel- 
sed in the scene. barrow and the best ones were 
The whole arrangement was a fine bit of community 
work. 
We have also seen doll furniture made _ by 
pupils from wood and raffia in representation of the 
high-backed settles and rush cradles of the olden 
time (Figs. 8 and 9). Long slender nails were 
driven into the wood and over these nails the raffia 
was woven. While this was interesting and the mak- 
ing must have given joy to the children, such work 
does not seem practicable for use as a class exercise 
to be carried out under ordinary schoolroom conditions. 
Possibly in some school where access could be had 
to the Manual Training room this lesson might be 
worked out very profitably. The braiding of raffia 
for the brim of the old-fashioned sunbonnet for the 
dolls, and the making of the sunbonnet were part of 
the work of the children in another school (Fig. 7). 
As has been said before, there is no material better | 
suited for MAKING work in the lower grades under 
present conditions than bogus or construction paper. 
Along the line of design are the booklets which are 
made by folding a sheet of construction paper for the 
cover, and a sheet of writing paper for the quotation 
inside—a quotation appropriate for Thanksgiving Day.

The children may decorate their booklets with borders 
made of brush strokes. If printing is used on the 
cover, the teacher should print the title very carefully 
on the chalkboard for the children to copy. In some 
places printed alphabets are supplied for this pur- 
pose. Every letter should be a capital. 
Very pretty units for brush stroke designs are made 
by using the cranberry as a motive. Cut the berries open 
crosswise, placing a section on each child’s desk. The 
design which nature has made in the heart of the berry 
furnishes delightful suggestions for the borders or sur- 
face coverings used on the booklets. Fig. 10 shows 
two units from the cranberry motive, and Figs. 11, 
12 and 13 suggest ways in which such units may 
be used. Figs. 14, 15, 16, and 17 show conventional 
designs as worked out by Second Grade children for 
use as booklet covers. These were done- on brown 
construction paper, the designs being painted in 
deeper brown, dark green, or dark brownish red. 
They were done by marking the paper off in quarter- 
inch squares as shown and described on Page 92, the 
designs being worked in over the guide lines thus 
formed. In one of these covers (Fig. 16) the writer 
has darkened the child’s guide lines so as to make 
clear the way in which he worked. The children 
should be taught to draw the guide lines very faintly, 
so that after the book cover is completed, a few strokes 
of a large kneaded rubber or art gum will remove all 
trace of pencil marks. The marginal lines are the 
same throughout the entire set and were doubtless

The Thanksgiving days are hardly over when 
Christmas comes on apace and suggests another line 
of form work based upon the Santa Claus and Christ- 
mas tree stories. Here is one charming poem which _ 
may be used -in connection with these lessons: | 
  t A HAPPY TREE

“Oh, look at me!” | 
Sang the Christmas tree,— 
A jolly young evergreen,— 
“T’m dressed up here 
For a show, that’s clear, 
BEE And I’m anxious to be seen. 
To grow in a wood 
Is very good,— 
Of air you've a trifle more,— 
But I declare | 
It cannot compare 
To a block on the parlor floor! 
You may ‘stand in the cold 
Till a century old, 
Not a blossom to speak of comes; 
But here in an hour 
I’m all in flower 
With mittens and dolls and drums. 
I know so well— 
And daren’t to tell— 
So much that I’m like to burst; 
There’s a mystery hung 
Or a secret swung 
On each branch from last to first. 
How I'd love to shout 
All my feelings out! 
But I daren’t to even cough; |

If holly is used for any of the painting lessons, 
have only a few leaves on each twig and plenty of 
berries. In this connection the following verse will 
- do for a Christmas card with cheery holly decoration. 
“I’m the holly, always jolly 
For the Christmas time. 
My bright berries, red as cherries 
Fear no frosty rime.” 
If- holly forms are used for the decoration of book- 
lets, calendars, or picture frames, they should be 
worked into conventional borders, surface coverings, 
ete. If conditions permit children to make their 
arrangements with real holly leaves and berries before 
painting their designs, it will be found that this helps 
them often to work out quite original ideas in pleasing 
form. It is also suggested that the teacher cut from 
stiff paper a number of large leaves and berries and 
long border strips, having pupils come to the front 
of the room and arrange the units and strips, accord- 
ing to their judgment of pleasing effects, on a large sheet 
of paper fastened to the chalkboard. This can be 
done by using thumb tacks, paste, or pins (See Figs.

Useful hat brushes made of raffia are among the 
things not too difficult for primary children to make 
(Fig. 28). The little basket-like box (Fig. 29) was 
selected from a class exercise in a Second Grade. It 
is made of bogus paper and tied with ordinary linen 
twine so that the cost is virtually nothing. The mak- 
ing of these boxes will probably consume three or 
four lessons in construction and design. The draw- 
ing of the pattern on bogus paper from the teacher’s 
dictation should cover two lessons. ‘The children 
should use rulers for this. Decorating the sides of 
the box will take one lesson. This should be done 
before the box is cut and pasted. The fourth lesson 
should be given to cutting, pasting, and tying. Fig. 
30 shows how the pattern looks before it is pasted. 
The fine lines show where folds are to be made. 
The boxes make good candy holders for the Christ-

which one sometimes sees. Figs. 33 and 34 show 
valentines made along purely conventional lines by 
the children. 
If one feels that the occasion demands something 
more frivolous, there are many ideas which may be 
worked out without resorting to the use of tinsel or 
lace paper. For instance, let the children cut a heart 
for a pattern. Let them trace several hearts on 
colored paper which has been folded as in Fig. 35, 
taking care to leave hinges at A and B. Let them 
cut out the inside of the heart so as to leave merely 
a margin. They will now have a double heart (Fig. 
36) which opens like a little book. These hearts may 
be interwoven so as to form a chain of hearts and 
tied to a card on which the child may write : 
Let me add another link 
To your chain of hearts. (Fig. 37). 
There are a couple of weaving exercises (Figs. 41 
and 42) which have come down to us from the days 
of our grandmothers, but which will delight the chil- 
dren of today as they delighted those of another genera- 
tion. Figs. 38, 39; and 40 show the way in which the 
contrasting strips are cut and crossed in order to weave 
the heart-shaped valentine shown in Fig. 41. Fig. 43

but if something identified especially with the life 
of Washington is desired, there is much material 
available. 
The children may fold Colonial hats (Fig. 46), 
decorating with a tissue paper cockade. A large one 
may be made from a newspaper for the boy, who, 
with toy sword, impersonates George Washington in 
a pose lesson. Instead of drawing hatchets and 
cherries let each child write one of Washington’s rules 
of behavior, decorating his card mt some such device, 
painted or cut from red, white, and blue paper, as 
shown in Fig. 47. Such emblems as this may be made 
’ of colored paper and worn as “buttons” on patriotic 
days much to the joy of the wearers. 
With the approach of Easter such a wealth of 
material is suggested that one scarcely knows what to 
choose. As on other special occasions a variety of 
booklets may be made. Such work is always to be 
commended, related as it is to the regular work in 
making. Figs. 44 and 45 are reproduced from two 
such booklets made by Second Grade children. Easter 
book-marks are decidedly appropriate for this season. 
The paper cutting is effective for such little poster 
effects as the one shown in Fig. 48. Fig. 49 shows 
pussy willows drawn in pencil and mounted on gray 
paper. Rabbits and chickens may be drawn or 
painted in the regular animal lessons, and for the clay 
modeling, the artificial ones so common in the stores

legs; hence, the children should use bits of toothpicks 
to represent legs. The chickens may be made to 
stand by sticking the wooden legs into clay tablets 
which are modeled to represent the ground. The 
construction work may include the making of chicken 
coops of bogus or other stiff paper (Fig. 50), and the 
children may perhaps model the mother hen sitting 
on her eggs in the coop. ‘There is also the butterfly 
cornucopia which the children delight in making and 
which is pictured in color on Page 79. he directions 
for making are as follows: Every child cuts a square 
of paper diagonally (Fig. 51). ‘Taking one of the 
triangular pieces he creases it as shown by the dotted 
line in Fig. 52. He next folds the edges over to meet 
this crease (Fig. 53), after which he lets the back edges 
overlap and pastes as shown in Fig. 54. He then 
paints and pastes his butterfly (Fig. 55), following 
some such plan as suggested on Page 79.

making of the umbrella here pictured (Fig. 56). A 
pea stick, meat skewer or any other smooth round 
stick may be used for the handle. ‘Toothpicks may 
be used for the ribs, radiating from a cork through 
which the handle passes and over which the raffia may « 
be woven. Large beads fastened to the ends of the 
ribs will hold the raffia in place. 
May Day furnishes another opportunity for con- 
structive work and the little baskets shown herewith 
(Figs. 57-63) were a May Day suggestion. It is 
interesting to note how one child’s idea of a May

The children’s tree sketches may be properly 
mounted and used to decorate programs or souvenir 
cards, to be presented to visiting friends or parents 
of the children. | 
For Decoration Day there is much material in the 
way of stories for illustrative work, and patriotic poses 
for the regular drawing. Ordinarily, these should be 
preferred to the painting of the flag, which, beautiful 
as it is, is almost too difficult for small children, 
The following is a good exercise: Dictate a five- 
pointed star, or for the First Grade pupils furnish a 
pattern and let the children trace and cut a star from 
white paper. Let each child pin his star in place on 
the field of blue which is temporarily hung over the 
stars on the large flag at the front of the room. 
Once more, let us say that no teacher “could, 
would, or should” attempt to have her children do all 
of the things here suggested. For the most part the 
work involved in the Special Day exercises should be 
carried on in the regular drawing period by means 
of the lessons covering the various kinds of drawing, 
painting, and making. An occasional variation, how- 
ever, by giving a special exercise as here suggested, 
not only delights the children but stimulates the 
interest of the parents in the drawing work.

  XI. CARE AND DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS 
Although this chapter has been placed at the end of 
the book, it is not least in importance, for upon the 
proper care and distribution of materials depends largely 
the success of the drawing work. A teacher who con- 
cerns herself only with the presentation of the lesson, 
ignoring other matters, will find it diffieult to get good 
results when handling large classes of children. That 
teacher who is resourceful and systematic devises a 
score of ways to interest her children in keeping 
their paint boxes clean and in good condition, 
realizing that the habit of neatness which she is trying 
to develop will prove a valuable asset to all even 
though some do not show much skill in. the actual 
drawing and painting lessons. ‘The distribution of 
the material, too, which is attended in some rooms 
with wild confusion, may be systematized until “things 
move like clockwork,” and the effect upon the attitude 
of the children during the lesson and upon the paint- 
ing itself becomes plainly evident. : 
Consider a few of the devices which have been 
successfully used by various teachers, remembering 
that each teacher must follow the method best adapted 
to the local conditions“tnder which she labors. 
In the majority of places each child owns his paint 
box, but in others the paints are the property of the 
school board, and are passed around from room to 
129 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
©. 130 TALKS ON DRAWING   
room, one set of boxes being used in turn by several 
rooms. To keep the boxes in good condition under 
these circumstances is much more difficult than. when 
each child owns his materials, just as rented houses 
become shabby much more rapidly than those occupied 
by their owners. In one schoolroom where the color 
boxes were school property, the following was observed: 
The teacher chose from each row one boy whose neat- 
ness in caring for the paints commended him to her. 
Sometimes she chose girls and called them house- 
keepers. Jt was the duty of each housekeeper to 
inspect the boxes. in her row when they were ready 
for collection to see that everything was in fine order. 
Whenever a box was discovered in which a cake of 
red, yellow, or blue was needed, it was taken to the 
teacher for replenishing. When boys were chosen, 
they were called storekeepers and they took great 
“ > pride in seeing that their “clerks’’ were taking care 
of the stock. The “term of office’ expired every 
month and then others were chosen by the teacher. 
In other towns each box of school paints is numbered 
and when the child writes his name on his painting, 
he also puts down the number of the -box which he 
used. In this way any untidy box may be traced 
back to the one who last used it. 
It is more satisfactory for each child to own. his 
box of water colors. A paint box, properly eared for, 
should last several years, and fresh cakes for replenish- 
ing may be bought when necessary. The children 
from homes where money is plentiful buy a new box

each year, and they may be encouraged to leave their 
old boxes for the less fortunate children. The name 
of each child should be written on a slip of paper 
and pasted on the top of his box. The long boxes 
containing a brush with wooden handle are the best 
to have, but if the short ones are used the brushes 
may be kept in a tumbler, points upward, and 
distributed for each painting lesson. 
Were the child’s desk large enough, all of his 
painting materials might be placed in a little paste- 
board box and kept in his desk. In some of the 
places where text-books are school property and 
are collected after each lesson, the desk is left 
comparatively empty, and the drawing and painting 
materials are kept in them. ‘These materials consist 
of a box of water colors, a water pan, a paint cloth, 
and a soft sketching pencil. This simplifies distribu- 
tion materially, inasmuch as only the paper and the 
water remain to be passed. Sometimes, when it is 
not possible to keep these pasteboard boxes in the 
desks, they are placed on a table behind a screen. 
When a painting lesson is given, the screen is removed 
and the children march to the front of the room, row 
by row, each child removing his box in order. If 
his neighbor is absent from school, he removes his 
box also, placing it on the vacant desk. When 
this plan is followed, it is desirable that the paste- 
board boxes be uniform in size and that the owners’ 
names be plainly written on the ends of them. This 
is a very rapid and satisfactory way of distributing
-P-A-G-E-164
  132 TALKS ON DRAWING   
the materials, as each child knows his part of the 
procedure. In some places the children keep their 
materials in bags which hang from the desks, but this 
frequently gives rise to undue noise and confusion. | 
  Another way is to have a small peach basket for 
each row, letting the monitor | each row attend 
to the distribution and. collection of the paints, piling 
them neatly in the basket. One popular time-saving 
device is to give the painting lesson after the morning 
recess. When this plan is followed, the teacher, 
assisted by the monitors, attends to the distribution 
of materials during recess, and all is in readiness for 
work when the children come in. 
Children may use old cups, tumblers, etc., for the 
water but this motley array of receptacles is extremely 
difficult to handle in a schoolroom,.and the water pans 
which are made for the purpose are better in every way. 
They take up little room when put away, as they 
may be stacked one within the other, and the flatness of 
the base does away with much of the danger of over- 
turning. When each child owns his pan, he may care 
for it with his paints, or the monitor may collect the 
pans with the paint boxes. The pans should be 
thoroughly wiped after each les

‘be placed on the desk next to the water pan, ready

supply for the children who are not provided with 
them. If, however, certain children acquire the habit 
of depending too much upon this public supply, an 
occasional lesson in which they are not allowed to 
participate serves as a prod to their memories. 
When ready to paint, the box should be placed on 
the middle of the back of the desk, opened wide with 
the cover turned toward the pupil for greater con- 
venience in mixing washes, and the water pan should 
be placed at the right of the box and touching it. 
This is not only the most convenient way, but the 
resulting workman-like appearance of the desks is a 
stimulus to neat work by the children. 
Not the least important thing in color work is the 
care of the paints. Teach the children to “wash 
the faces” of their paints with brush and water after 
each lesson, to make the brush take up all the extra 
water from the top of the cakes and to dry the brush 
on the paint rag. If the boxes and brushes are put 
away in bad condition, nothing but muddy color can 
result in the next lesson. 
The soft pencils which are absolutely necessary 
for primary drawing break easily and must be handled 
carefully and used only for the drawing lessons. If 
so kept, and properly sharpened at the outset, they 
are not difficult to keep in condition. They are 
usually placed in cases, being arranged in order so 
that each child receives his own pencil. ‘These cases 
may be made of cloth with tape stitched on so as to 
hold the pencils in place, or with narrow pockets,   
 
-P-A-G-E-166
134 TALKS ON DRAWING   
or they may be made by punching holes in the cover 
of a shoe box and slipping the pencils into these holes 
so that they stand with points upward. This latter 
way has an advantage. ‘The sesh of the pencils are 
exposed more plainly to view, and the teacher may 
readily see when they need attention. 
Plenty of lead should be left exposed when sharpen- 
ing a pencil, and a piece of sandpaper upon which to 
file the lead to a conical point is a great convenience. 
This sandpaper may be tacked inside of the lid of a 
cigar box kept in the room so that) the filings will fall 
into the box when the lid is closed. 
Desk boards, almost indispensable in much of the 
drawing work, shy be placed across the aisles with 
ends resting on the desks when giving a nature or 
object lesson. Somitimes these bobrds are taken from 
old drygoods boxes; sometimes they are neatly made 
by the Manual Training boys, and sometimes they 
are the light boards upon which cloth in drygoods 
stores is wound; but desk boards there should be, 
else it is impossible to place objects quickly and satis- 
factorily. The accompanying diagram (see next page) 
illustrates how these boards may be} placed so that all 
the children may see the object, and the teacher may 
make her rounds of the room to inspect the drawings. 
It will be noted that the children on the front seats 
draw the object placed on the teacher’s desk. 
As stated in the Chapter on Cutting from Paper, 
the scissors used in paper cutting should be sharp- 
pointed ones. ‘The children should be taught how to

pass these to one another properly, that is, to hold 
the scissors by the points when passing them, so as 
to present the handle to the one who takes them. 
This is not for politeness alone, but is a precaution 
against accident.

should be kept in such cases as are described for 
holding pencils. This protects the scissors from dam- 
age and makes it easy to sée if any are missing 
after a lesson.
-P-A-G-E-168
136 TALKS ON DRAWING   
Paste is usually purchased in bulk and furnished 
to pupils. Sometimes, however, the children are 
required to furnish their own paste. ‘This is not only 
unnecessarily expensive, but the children often buy 
an inferior kind which is quite worthless. Besides, 
the care of many small bottles adds another burden 
to the teacher. If the children must furnish the paste, 
let each child bring his penny or pennies. ‘The teacher 
may make a good paste according to the following 
recipe: Eight ounces of wheat flour, one-fourth of 
an ounce of powdered alum, one and one-half ounces 
of glycerine, one dram of oil of wintergreen and one 
and one-half pints of water. Mix water, flour, and 
alum to a smooth paste and boil until it thickens, 
being very careful not to burn it or cook it too much. 
Take it from the stove and add oil and glycerine, 
mixing thoroughly. When first made, it is a trifle too 
thick to use but may be thinned by adding a little 
water when needed for use. A liquid will form at 
the top of the can after it has stood for a time. Do 
not remove this liquid. It helps to preserve the paste. 
The above recipe makes about a quart of paste. The 
  paste may be kept indefinitely when placed in a covered 
glass jar. It has excellent adhesive qualities and is 
inexpensive. 
The ordinary school ink may be used for silhouette 
work, but if blacker effects are desired, plan to give 
your brush and ink lessons when the ink is low in the 
wells, as it is then almost as black as the regular India 
drawing ink.

If the regular paint brush is used for the brush 
and ink work, it necessitates the distribution of paint 
boxes and water pans (for the brushes must be care- 
fully washed before painting again with the cakes). 
If possible, a set of brushes should be kept for ink 
work. These, kept points upward in a tumbler or 
mug, may be distributed quickly when needed, and 
after the lesson all of the brushes may be washed at 
one time, as it is not essential that every particle of 
ink be removed before another lesson. If the chil- 
dren use water color boxes, containing the three 
primary colors and a cake of black, the silhouette 
work may be done with the black cake in preference 
to ink. 
Many supervisors give their teachers specific direc- 
tions as to what to do with children’s work. If, how- 
ever, there is no supervisor, the following suggestion 
may prove helpful. After a lesson, the work should 
be collected and laid away until the teacher is at 
liberty to look it over carefully. Sometimes it is best 
to preserve the entire set of drawings as a class exercise 
to show to parents who are interested. It would not 
be possible to save all the work for any length of time 
as it accumulates too rapidly. However, a few of the 
very best from each lesson should be saved for dis- 
play in case an exhibition of school work is given. 
To have a screen or wire upon which some of 
these drawings may be hung after each lesson is a 
great source of inspiration to the children, but never 
leave the same drawings up for more than a few days.
-P-A-G-E-170
138 TALKS ON DRAWING   
The drawings which are not saved should never 
be destroyed before the children. When once they 
realize that the things which they have labored so 
hard to do well are merely thrown into the waste 
basket, it wounds their pride and causes them to lose 
interest in their work.

  XII. PLANNING THE WORK 
While the subjects treated in this book cover in 
general the leading kinds of work which have been 
evolved as suitable for Art Instruction in the primary 
grades, it remains for the teacher to select the helps 
which will contribute to the desired results and to 
make a plan of work in accord with local school con- 
ditions. In many cities the supervisor plans a course 
adapted to the local situation. Sometimes this course 
specifies in detail the work for each day; in other 
cases it gives only the general plan, leaving the teacher 
to work out the details. In many places the grade 
teacher must plan her own course, and for such the 
following suggestions are made: 
To make the year’s work a success, survey not 
only the particular subject to be taught today or 
tomorrow, but survey the whole ground to be covered 
during the year. Don’t try to carry the plan in the 
mind. Find time, once it is formulated, to fix it on 
paper. This is the only way to ensure a balance of 
work. It means some trouble but it will pay a 
hundred fold. 
In planning the work for the year, turn to the 
Table of Contents where the various subjects and the 
topics under each are specified and paged. After 
estimating the number of lessons that can be given 
during the year, select the subjects you wish to cover, 
139 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
140 TALKS ON DRAWING   
and apportion the lessons to each subject. In doing 
this you will, of course, assign many more lessons to 
Drawing from Things than to Drawing from Animals, 
as only an occasional lesson will be demanded by the 
last named subject. Drawing from Nature will rightly 
claim more lessons than Cutting from Paper, Working 
in Clay, or Special Days although each of these has 
its peculiar value and interest. 
It would be well to read the entire book before 
going farther, jotting down the topics under each sub- 
ject. Lastly, it becomes necessary to know whether 
the work shall be planned to follow each subject rather 
continuously for a number of weeks, or whether it 
shall be planned with reference to the daily life of the 
child, his activities, his other lessons, and the chang- 
ing seasons, each bringing in its own plant life. The 
teacher who follows the former plan might teach 
Drawing from Nature in September and early October; 
Drawing from Things in later October and November; 
Making and Decorating in December and early Jan- 
uary; Painting and Color for the following six weeks; 
Drawing from People and Animals in March, going 
back to Drawing from Nature in the spring. She 
would under this plan devote little attention to Special 
Days. She would follow the suggestions for Working 
in Clay or for Cutting from Paper only when they 
were pertinent to the other work, and would teach 
Drawing from Imagination only in connection with 
language. work.

although it has its advocates. It works out better in 
the upper than in the lower grades, for in the upper 
grades more stress is placed on technique, and a series 
of lessons in one subject surely confers greater technical 
skill. With very young children, however, we neither 
expect nor seek technique primarily. We should, 
therefore, strive to plan the work in such a way that 
the lesson of each day fits into the child’s interests and 
activities, and thus with the teacher’s definite plan 
and the year for a unit, there would be no dull routine 
for the pupil. | Each lesson would be welcomed as a 
delight, and together would form a balanced whole 
for the year. 
Two ways of laying out the work for one month 
under the latter plan are here shown, and although 
neither may exactly fit any particular case, they may 
at the same time prove suggestive. 
In the first instance, the number of drawing lessons, 
which are likely to come in September, are taken and 
apportioned to the subjects. It is frequently possible 
and always desirable to put the time of two regular 
drawing lessons into one painting lesson instead of 
two short ones, so when we say, “Drawing from 
Imagination, four lessons,” we may actually mean 
only two lessons. In the Northern States, the 
Drawing from Nature must necessarily be done 
during the fall and spring months, while in the 
South the nature lessons may be distributed over 
the year.

Having blocked out the subjects and lessons in 
this general way, it will be well to plan definitely just 
what stories are to be illustrated, and what poses and 
objects are to be drawn. 
The second way of laying out the work for Septem- 
ber shows the specification by days. While circum- 
stances might cause a readjustment of the program 
for any given day, it could in the, main be followed 
quite closely.

In laying out the work for the month as above, it 
would be well to write down the number of the page 
in this book where help for a particular exercise may 
be found, specifying the topical heading. 
It is suggested that a general plan of the entire 
year’s work be made, and then the detailed plan worked 
out a month at a time.

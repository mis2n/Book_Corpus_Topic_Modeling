PREFACE 
N gathering these papers into a volume, I have 
been moved by three considerations. First, a 
number of friends and pupils, including certain 
teachers of English, would have it so. Secondly, 
there has been a demand for some of the articles 
from persons unknown to me, and some of them have 
been handled as pamphlets by book-shops in a fash- 
ion not altogether satisfactory to the dealers or 
customers, or to the author. Thirdly, I have found 
nearly all the contents of the present volume useful 
in my teaching at Cornell University, as well as in 
summer courses given at the University of Illinois, 
Stanford University, and the University of Cali- 
fornia. Meanwhile the supply of offprints and 
pamphlets has been virtually exhausted, so that I 
must either reprint most of the papers, or relinquish 
the hope of giving again certain courses for teachers 
in what seems to me the most effective way. Per- 
haps it will not be amiss to add that I have faith in 
the eclectic body of doctrine here offered to a wider 
public. The volume naturally represents my own 
experience as a student and teacher in a special 
province; yet so much of it is assimilated from writers 
and thinkers, teachers and scholars, of all ages, that 
it may fairly be said to represent a broader range

of experience than could fall to the lot of any in- 
dividual; and hence I entertain the hope that the 
collection may be serviceable to others who are inter- 
ested in the teaching of language and literature. 
It will be found that these pages contain many, 
and some long, illustrative quotations, and frequent 
citations of opinion on questions that in recent years 
have been the subject of controversy. One entire 
paper, The Function of the Leader in Scholarship, 
is, of set purpose, largely made up of quotations. 
There and elsewhere, it has been my fortune to side 
with the few rather than the multitude, in re- 
spect to the solution of problems concerning which 
nearly every one has fairly definite opinions. In 
fact, I have more than once, after reading a paper 
at an educational gathering, experienced an attack 
upon what were called my ‘ideas,’ when I had taken 
pains to let Milton, or Wordsworth, or Plato, or a 
number of such men of weight, say for me what 
seemed to be unquestionable truth. A great deal of 
the truth concerning education is unpalatable to 
any crowd, and I am aware of no field where the 
truth is less palatable to the generality than in the 
teaching of literature. I must therefore beg the in- 
dulgence of the reader for a method of presentation 
by which I am enabled to set forth, not my ideas— 
as if ideas ever could be the property of an indi- 
vidual—but permanent human ideas, expressed with 
the skill and force of men whose utterances are 
likely to win assent, or at least to receive attention.

PREFACE vii 
The papers here included have been subjected to 
a revision designed to eliminate chance errors and 
unnecessary repetition of illustrative materials, and, 
so far as might be, to remove the signs of their oc- 
casional origin, together with personal allusions. 
And something has been done to fit them into a 
reasonable sequence. That the personal tone which 
may be excused in an occasional address has en- 
tirely disappeared is more than one could hope for. 
Nor is it to be expected that the parts of this book 
should read like the successive chapters of a treat- 
ise. If I had tried to avoid all overlapping, it 
would hardly be feasible to reprint some of the items 
at all. Where repetition occurs, I trust that the 
importance of the thought, or at least the strength 
of my convictions as to its importance, may serve as 
an excuse for what, after all, in a systematic treat- 
ise would amount to little more than a rhetorical 
device for the sake of emphasis. 
It gives me pleasure to thank the editors of the 
various periodicals in which the majority of these 
articles first appeared, for permission, always gener- 
ously granted, to reissue the articles in their present 
shape; these and other obligations are, I trust, in 
every case duly indicated at the proper place in 
the volume. But I now subjoin a list of the passages 
quoted with the kind consent of the English pub- 
lishers from recent books published in Great Britain. 
The extract on pp. 26-7 from Zielinski’s Our Debt 
to Antiquity, pp. 2-8, is reprinted with the consent 
of Messrs. George Routledge and Sons. The extract 
on p. 83 from Frederic Harrison’s Tennyson, Rus-

that on pp. 83-4 from Lord Morley’s Studies in

Smith’s Reminiscences, p. 71, and that on pp. 150-2 
from Welldon’s translation of Aristotle’s Rhetoric, 
pp. 164-6, are reprinted with the consent of Messrs. 
Maemillan and Company. The extracts on pp. 160, 
184-5, 189, from Jowett’s translation of The Dia- 
logues of Plato 1.472-8, 2.124-5, 2.129, that on pp. 
195-6 from Andrew Lang’s Memoir of W. Y. Sellar 
in Sellar’s Horace and the Elegiac Poets, pp. xxxi-

of Dante’s Convivio, pp. 31-4, and that on p. 249 
from Burgon’s Lives of Twelve Good Men, p. 38, are 
reprinted with the consent of the Clarendon Press. 
The extract on pp. 179-81 from Andrew Lang’s Es-

of Messrs. Longmans, Green and Company, and also 
of Messrs. Charles Scribner’s Sons. The extract on 
pp. 187-8 from Gierke-Maitland, Political Theories 
of the Middle Age, pp. 131-2, is reprinted with the 
consent of the Cambridge University Press. 
Finally I wish to thank two friends of mine, from 
the circle of my former students, who have materi- 
ally helped me in bringing these papers in their 
present shape before the public. But for the gener- 
osity of these two friends and pupils it would have 
been impossible for me to publish the volume at all. 
To them, since they wish to remain anonymous, I 
herewith informally dedicate the book.

GREEK CULTURE* 
INCE the following pages often lay stress on 
the importance of the ancient classics in a 
general education, it may be well to begin with a 
brief estimate of Greek antiquity, and some hints 
respecting our debt to it. 
The term ‘Greek culture’ properly embraces all 
the activities of the Hellenic race throughout all 
ages, with the influence of the Greeks upon other 
peoples and civilizations. A rapid survey can in- 
elude only what is typical of the best periods, to- 
gether with a few aspects of Greek tradition and in- 
fluence. 
Fifty years ago, Greek civilization seemed an in- 
explicable phenomenon, conditioned, indeed, by the 
geography and climate of the eastern Mediterranean, 
yet not derivative in the usual sense, since the early 
culture of Egypt and Asia Minor could not account 
for it, while to Thrace the Greek owed little more 
than an earnest desire to escape from Thracian bar- 
barism. Of late, however, we have become aware of 
a vast pre-existent Adgean culture, not only having

centres at Argos, Mycene, and Orchomenos, and in 
the Troad and Crete, but extending from the Archi- 
pelago to Syria and other distant shores of the 
Mediterranean. Archeology has pushed back the 
origins of Hellenic culture six thousand years or 
more; and if it does not explain the Greek genius 
and Greek art (since in art and genius there is always 
something that defies analysis), yet, by affording 
glimpses of age-long preparation, it satisfies the mind 
that is accustomed to the notion of simple origins 
and a process of evolution. Even so, in contemplat- 
ing the efforts of the Greek genius, we should doubt- 
less suspect the bias of our day, and be ready to 
eredit more rather than less to the originating power 
of great individuals, and to the mutual inspiration 
of gifted men in groups, as compared with the vague 
effect upon them of the masses. 
Explain the origins as we may, two periods stand 
out pre-eminent in Hellenic civilization: the Homeric 
age, from the tenth to the eighth century B.c.; and 
the age associated with the name of Pericles, an 
interval of 100 years or so, beginning about 480 B.c. 
To these we must add the less creative, more scien- 
tifie and critical, Hellenistic age, including the third 
and second centuries B.c. 
The Homeric Iliad and Odyssey represent the 
flower of early Hellenic culture. They were not, as 
Lord Macaulay thought, the outcome of heroic bar- 
barism ; certainly they evince no unsophisticated art. 
Rather they seem to have appeared near the end of 
a high stage of civilization, possibly as it began to
-P-A-G-E-13
  
  THE ILIAD AND THE ODYSSEY 3 
decline; though they idealize the life of a more 
heroic past. As to their origin, modern scholarship 
is now veering again toward the ancient belief in 
the existence of a great poet who may have organized 
earlier materials into the two masterly epics. True, 
there is in the Odyssey a difference in tone which 
led Longinus (or whoever wrote the treatise On the 
Sublime) to ascribe this poem to the old age of the 
author; and there are grounds for believing, not only 
that the Iliad is a more primitive work, but that 
more than one hand may have been concerned in 
giving it the form it now possesses. But in any case 
the Iliad, and still more the Odyssey, betray a wonder- 
ful command of metrical composition, a vast knowl- 
edge of history, geography, tradition, and myth, ex- 
traordinary insight into the ways and motives of 
men, and an ability to unite all these poetical re- 
sources into a single plot for the attainment of a 
designed artistic end. In structure the Odyssey is 
more perfect than most of the dramas of Shakespeare 
and the works of virtually all modern novelists. 
Such an art no doubt is unthinkable in a poet work- 
ing in isolation, without predecessors to learn from, 
and contemporaries to inspire and appreciate him. 
Accordingly, we must imagine a school of Aigean 
bards who gave rise to at least one superlative 
genius: Homerus, ‘he who sews together’—a maker 
or fitter, not merely of verses, but of characters and 
incidents into one orderly plan with a beginning, 
middle, and end. The final measure of Homeric civi- 
lization is the poetic art to be seen in the two  
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 GREEK CULTURE 
epics, from which, centuries after, the Aristotelian 
theory of poetry was largely deduced. But we have 
evidence also that the Homeric age possessed a 
noble architecture, knew the art of writing, was 
skilled in weaving tapestry, was expert in metal- 
work and woodwork, understood landscape garden- 
ing and road-making as well as sculpture, and had 
developed a seemingly naive, but very subtle, elo- 
quence. To judge from its two great epics, the age 
was benevolent toward religious tradition; not athe- 
istical, but employing the tales of the gods in no very 
edifying way. The Olympians are brought down 
not quite to the level of the heroes, while the heroes 
are elevated until, in conduct if not in power, they 
move on a plane not much lower than the gods as 
agents in the story. More important than all else, 
then, the Homeric age transmitted to that of Peri- 
eles ideals of human conduct—bravery and endur- 
ance in time of war, good counsel and fidelity in time 
of peace; at all times courage for individual achieve- 
ment, coupled with reverence and an instinctive 
feeling that communal interests are supreme. 
The age of Pericles is justly regarded as attain- 
ing the high-water mark of Greek culture. At this 
time Athens became the chief city of Greece and the 
centre of Mediterranean civilization. Here the vari- 
ous excellences of the several Hellenic stocks, Dorie, 
AMolic, and Ionic, were tempered and united in one 
superior blend of character. Here the streams of 
dialect merged into one clear, vigorous, and beauti- 
ful medium of expression, the Attic. Here the sys-

ALL STREAMS UNITE AT ATHENS 5 
tems of philosophy which had arisen in Asia Minor 
and in Sicily and southern Italy were sifted and in- 
corporated into the native systems of Socrates, Plato, 
and Aristotle. Here the Sicilian theory and practice 
of rhetoric matured into perfect eloquence. Here 
was developed tragedy; hither came comedy from 
Syracuse. Here the Homeric poems were learned 
by heart as the one basic element of education; and 
tragedies founded upon stories from the great epic 
tradition became familiar to a populace, large num- 
bers of whom in course of time took part in the 
choruses. In this period, Athenian life was charac- 
terized by the dominance of a regulated imagination 
in every sphere of activity, and by a complete inter- 
penetration of theory and practice. Imagination, 
hand in hand with reason, appeared in the ordering 
of the State, in the development of commerce and 
colonies, in the public festivals and religion, in the 
consummation of every fine and every useful art. 
In fact, the distinction between fine and useful art 
was not observed, so that even the commonest uten- 
sils became objects of beauty, to be wondered at by 
subsequent ages. For the simultaneous flourishing 
of sculpture, painting, architecture, music, and poetry, 
no other age can be compared with this, unless, per- 
haps, the thirteenth century of our era in France and 
Italy. But in Greece the arts subsisted in closer 
combination with each other, with the functions of 
the State, with religion, and with life. Witness At- 
tic tragedy and comedy, which arose in the worship 
of Dionysus, and were associated with the chief re- 
2
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 GREEK CULTURE 
ligious festivals and processions; were exhibited in 
a, theatre which was virtually a temple of the god, 
a masterpiece of architecture in marble, capable of 
holding a large share of the free populace at once; 
were supported by a State that supplied every citi- 
zen with the price of admission; were produced by 
poets who took part in the acting, as well as in train- 
ing the actors and chorus, and who were eligible to 
any office in the democracy (as Sophocles was ap- 
pointed one of the ten generals who led the expedi- 
tion against the revolt in Samos) ; were attended by 
strangers from every part of Greece, serving to unify 
the Hellenic consciousness; and in fact combined in 
one our modern drama, opera, dancing, and lyrical 
poetry, with the embellishments of the best landscape- 
painting and artistic costume. 
But Greek civilization was something more than 
what the Greeks actually accomplished, in art, or in 
commerce, or in statesmanship. The creator is 
greater than his works. More important than what 
they wrought were the agents, the men themselves, 
with their ability to produce both these and other 
works—with their unlimited capacity for contempla- 
tion and construction, for the highest kind of action, 
the orderly life of the spirit. Greek civilization 
means Phidias and Praxiteles, the sculptors, rather 
than the small part of their work now remaining. 
It means Ictinus and Polygnotus, the architect and 
the painter; Socrates, Anaxagoras, and Plato, the 
philosophers; Pindar, the lyric poet; Herodotus and 
Thucydides, the historians; Demosthenes, the orator;
-P-A-G-E-17
  
  PERICLES AND SOPHOCLES 7 
Aristophanes, the comic poet, prince in the realm of 
mirth and fantastic beauty; A®schylus, Sophocles, 
and Euripides, the masters of tragedy; and Pericles, 
the statesman, the artist and philosopher in govern- 
ment. There were also strange, indecent men, like 
Diogenes; and bad or irresponsible men, like Alcibi- 
ades and Cleon. Yet on the whole the Athenians, 
nobly simple, and quietly great, maintained a norm 
of good and beautiful conduct, observing measure 
in all things, even while devoting themselves each 
to his chosen way of life and communal service; for 
the life of the individual was subordinated to the 
welfare of the State, and found complete realization 
therein—the State did not, as in modern times, 
mainly exist for the sake of the individual. 
From this wonderful group and succession of 
gifted and cultivated men, whose activities really 
constituted the essence of Greek civilization, it is 
customary, following the example of Plutarch, to 
single out Pericles, leader and conserver of the 
Athenian polity, as the representative citizen, and 
the type of Hellenic culture. Grave and reserved, 
fearless and eloquent, combining judgment with im- 
agination, intelligence with sentiment, forethought 
with passion, of commanding presence, endowed, as 
it seemed to his fellows, with every physical excel- 
lence and power of mind, and possessed of the good 
breeding which is the crown of virtue, he might 
well have sat for the character-sketch of the ‘high- 
minded man’ that is drawn by Aristotle in the 
Nicomachean Ethics. But for our purposes of illus- 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 GREEK CULTURE 
tration, the magnanimous Sophocles may serve even 
better. For, first, he is a poet, or ‘maker,’ par ex- 
cellence; and examples of his work are still intact, 
while the Periclean State came to a sudden termina- 
tion. And secondly, it is easier to compare him with 
other typical Greeks, since he occupies the place of 
a golden mean betwixt the religious Aischylus, who 
‘did right’ as a dramatist ‘without knowing why,’ 
and the rationalist and realist, Euripides, who drew 
men ‘as they are’; whereas Sophocles, as he himself 
was aware, proceeded aright from correct principles 
of art as well as correct sentiments, and, observing 
men and human life even more truly than Euripides, 
nevertheless properly idealized his characters for 
the ends of tragic representation. As in his own 
well-ordered life, so in elaborating his dramas, and 
in the very process of displaying the misfortunes of 
a self-blinded Cidipus, he shows how the artistic 
regulation of impulse leads to success and happiness. 
Nor did his fellow-Athenians blunder in their esti- 
mate of him, for in the dramatic contests he secured 
first prize no fewer than twenty times. Moreover, 
in the comedy of the Frogs, Aristophanes, with his 
keen eye for disproportion, ridicules Aischylus some- 
what, and Euripides yet more, for departing on this 
side or that from the golden mean, while he signifi- 
cantly refrains from attempting to distort the work 
of Sophocles. 
As a typical Greek, Sophocles is religious; not, 
like the Athenians in their later decadence, ‘too re- 
ligious,’ as Saint Paul described them. He is also
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE TYPICAL GREEK 9 
many-sided, with a number of diverse faculties ready 
for the accomplishment of both his immediate and 
his final aim. But the unity and compactness of 
structure in his @dipus Rex or his Antigone reflect 
the inner unity of spirit in their author. Sophocles 
knows when to amplify and when to inhibit; he is 
equally sensitive to broad perspective and to the 
value of each detail. His vision is steady and com- 
prehensive, as a comparison of the eighth Psalm, in 
the Bible, with his chorus on man, in the Antigone, 
will disclose. He has formed a just estimate of the 
relation between external nature, mankind, and the 
divine. In the delineation of character he has never 
been surpassed, yet his plays do not, like those of 
Shakespeare, fail to take direct cognizance of the 
action of a higher divine power (something more 
than impersonal moral law) in the affairs of men. 
But the typical Greek has his limitations. Although 
Homer and Sophocles have a sense of the divine in 
relation to human life, they are both polytheistic. 
Though in both we find ideal relations between men 
and women represented or suggested, and though 
Athens and the Parthenon by their very names imply 
a lofty conception of womanhood, Greek society was 
disfigured by an attitude to homosexual impulse that 
often resulted in words and actions at once base and 
grotesque; nor should one forget that the leisure of 
cultivated men was made possible by the labor of 
slaves. And though both of these poets attribute 
human failure to human blindness of heart rather 
than to fate or divine prejudice, the Greeks did not
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 GREEK CULTURE 
in the main identify divine providence with divine 
good will. Aischylus, it is true, may almost be 
termed monotheistic; and Plato has been called by 
the Jews themselves the Greek Moses, as by English 
scholars he has on occasion been styled a Puritan. 
But Aschylus said that his plays were only morsels 
from the Homeric banquet; while Plato, in spite of 
the criticism passed on the ancient epic poems in the 
Republic, is heavily indebted to them, and, closely 
as he approaches Hebraism or the modern spirit in 
his deepest reflections, he still remains a pagan. It 
was left for the Hebrews and Christianity definitely 
to assert a pure monotheism for transmission to 
modern times; to develop the idea of the fatherhood 
of God; and thus to establish upon a firm founda- 
tion the principles governing the relations between 
men and women, women and women, men and men. 
Again, the joyous Greek was not the joyful Chris- 
tian; nor was death to him the beginning of life— 
the ‘cross’ of the Stoics takes on a new meaning in 
Saint Paul. And again, the medieval doctrine of 
‘the gentle heart,’ from which our modern concep- 
tions of lady and gentleman are mainly derived, was 
neither Greek nor Roman. While these conceptions 
owe much to classical antiquity, to the Homeric and 
tragic heroes and heroines, to the ‘highminded man’ 
of Aristotle and the refined orator of Aristotle, 
Cicero, and Quintilian, to the Virgilian Auneas (who 
was borrowed from the Greeks), they owe more to 
the Provencal and Italian, and to the Germanic and 
Celtic, attitude to woman; at the core they are 
Christian.
-P-A-G-E-21
HOW GREEK CULTURE HAS SURVIVED 11 
The Greek culture of the most vital period has 
been handed down to us by intervening civilizations. 
Even the Hellenistic age may almost be regarded as 
intermediary and transitional; though under the in- 
fluence of Aristotle there came not only a critical 
evaluation of what preceded him in the way of 
rhetoric, political science, and poetry, but new de- 
velopments of both moral and physical and biologi- 
eal science. In Theophrastus we have the father of 
botany; in Euclid, the founder of modern mathe- 
matics; in Eratosthenes, the beginnings of modern 
scholarship. From Athens Greek culture passed to 
Alexandria, and from Alexandria to Rome. Greco- 
Roman culture was succeeded and preserved by that 
of Byzantium, and then, during the decay of learn- 
ing in southern Europe, was preserved in Ireland 
and England and in Arabia and Syria, whence it 
returned to the Continent in the later Middle Ages. 
It has on three occasions reasserted itself with special 
force: at Rome under the Emperor Hadrian; in the 
thirteenth century—for example, in the scholastic 
philosophers and Dante; and again in all Europe 
beginning with the Italian Renaissance, this last, 
however, being mainly Latin in character, and but 
secondarily Greek. Still, if we regard the Renais- 
sance as extending to our own day, we find a better 
and better understanding and assimilation of Hel- 
lenism, until in poets like Shelley and Goethe we 
discover an approximation to the Greek spirit almost 
as close as that achieved at Rome by Cicero, Virgil, 
and Horace. All five are, so to speak, not Greeks
-P-A-G-E-22
12 GREEK CULTURE 
proper of the triumphant age, but, like Lucian and 
Plutarch, late and provincial imitators—who never- 
theless have in them something of the original Hel- 
lenie genius. But perhaps, in their respective arts, 
Raphael and Mozart more truly reveal it, working 
freely in the classical spirit, and yet escaping any 
domination by particular models since the music 
and painting of Athens are lost. 
What has Greek culture done for the world? The 
enthusiastic Shelley (writing in the year 1822) ex- 
claims: 
“We are all Greeks. Our laws, our literature, our 
religion, our arts, have their root in Greece. But 
for Greece, Rome—the instructor, the conqueror, or 
the metropolis of our ancestors—would have spread 
no illumination with her arms, and we might still 
have been savages and idolaters; or, what is worse, 
might have arrived at such a stagnant and miserable 
state of social institution as China and Japan pos- 
sess.’ ? 
If pressed, Shelley would have to admit that Euro- 
pean law was the invention of Rome; and that, so 
far as concerns religion, the function of the Greeks 
under the Roman Empire was that of formulating 
and transmitting, not of producing it. Moreover, the 
principle of government by elected deputies comes 
to us, not from antiquity, but from the medieval 
monasteries. The Christian liturgy, however, though 
based upon Hebraic forms, may have originated 
among Christian Greeks; ecclesiastical music is es-

  GREEK LITERARY TYPES 13 
sentially Greek; the most original literary efforts of 
the early Christian era, the hymns, were composed, 
some in Greek, and some in Latin; and the New 
Testament was written in the commercial Greek 
(adapted) that had spread after the supremacy of 
Athens, and was the general means of communica- 
tion for the eastern Mediterranean. For all that, the 
customary attribution of intellectual culture to the 
Greeks, and religious culture to the Hebrews, is in 
the main justified, if we remember that the differ- 
ence between the two races is one of degree and 
emphasis rather than kind, that the Greeks were not 
unreligious, nor the Hebrews unintellectual. Strictly 
considered, the gifts of the two races to civilization 
cannot be regarded apart. Thus, as Renan points 
out, the Hebrews discovered various literary types 
as well as the Greeks. And yet we are safe in deem- 
ing the main literary types, and, as Shelley says, 
the arts in general, a bequest of the Greeks to the 
world. It was they who provided the models which 
have aroused the enthusiasm of mankind: for the 
epic and mock-epic, the poems of Homer; for tragedy, 
A®schylus and Sophocles; for romantic tragedy and 
tragi-comedy, Euripides; for political comedy, Aris- 
tophanes; for the character-sketch, the rhetoricians 
and Theophrastus; for domestic comedy, Menander; 
for history, Herodotus and Thucydides; for the dia- 
logue, Plato; for the oration, Demosthenes; for lyri- 
eal poetry, Pindar; for pastoral, Theocritus. From 
the Platonic dialogue, through Seneca, came the es- 
say. The satire, so far as we know, was another in-

vention of Rome. But what is often thought to be 
the peculiar type of modern literature, the prose 
novel, nevertheless has its prototypes in the last pro- 
ductions of the Greek genius, the romances of Helio- 
dorus, Achilles Tatius, and Longus. Even our scien- 
tific monographs, and the various types of literary 
criticism, in verse as well as prose, go back to Aris- 
totle and to his successors at Alexandria. They who 
speak slightingly of Hellenistic and ‘Alexandrian’ 
scholarship and science know little of the matter. 
In the main, Greek art has given us a conception 
of orderly structure, when we have been willing to 
accept it, pervading all human activity and achieve- 
ment. The Greek, in his city-state built upon a hill, 
developed a sense for architecture which reappears 
in every other art, and in all domains of life. The 
words and sentences of his oration or his drama are 
arranged like the stones in each section of his citadel 
and hill-crowning temple, and the several parts are 
fitted together in order due, like the face and divi- 
sions of the Parthenon. The nomadie Hebrew origi- 
nally dwelt in tents under the stars of the desert. 
His architectonic sense is relatively weak. But his 
Psalms have expressed the grief and exultation of 
mankind; it is he who gave the final meaning to the 
Greek Logos, the Word incarnate and undying; and 
the Greek words Christ and Christian take us back 
not only to Rome and Greece, but, through Rome and 
Greece, to Palestine. In any case they lead us to 
the Mediterranean sources of all modern civilization.

ANCIENT AND MODERN LETTERS* 
HI BETA KAPPA is a ‘Greek-letter’ society. 
P Beta and Kappa, B and K, the second two 
constituents of its usual name, are found in what 
we call the Roman alphabet also, and hence in the 
English. But the first, the letter 6, is not; nor may 
the concept which Phi here represents, that is, phil- 
osophia, be perfectly understood by those-who never 
have received a direct and literal message from the 
Greeks. : 
Were it feasible to discuss at length the history of 
the separate words, ‘Philosophy, the Guide of Life,’ 
in which we render the noble motto, :\ocodia 
Biov xvBepvyirys, it would not be difficult to show how 
the phrase suggests an essential unity in all the di- 
versity of ancient, medieval, and modern culture. 
The words ‘guide’ and ‘life’ do, indeed, take on a 
different coloring when translated into other tongues, 
and interpreted for different stages of civilization:

der Leitstern des Lebens. French, and German, and 
English life at least have a very different outward 
appearance, as have different epochs in the life and 
thought of any one nation. The resemblances be- 
tween French thought in Abelard of the twelfth 
century, for example, and French thought in Loisy 
of the twentieth, are not wholly on the surface. Yet 
in every age, in the principal modern tongues, and 
to the most modern, who are often the most conserva- 
tive, of their times, the word ‘philosophy’ must re- 
main essentially unchanged, and essentially Greek. 
The Society was organized in the first year of our 
national independence, at a time when the study of 
Greek and Latin authors was felt to be indispen- 
sable to the cultivation of philosophy and the study 
of belles-lettres in general—‘beautiful letters,’ as 
the French so well express it. Subsequently there 
has intervened a brief space—brief, that is, in the 
perspective of the centuries, and even in the history 
of our own nation—during which certain alleged 
exponents and purveyors of culture have seemed to 
feel otherwise. At all events we have beheld osten- 
sible leaders of education, themselves sometimes ow- 
ing the best that was in them to the study of Greek, 
yet acting as if they fancied that the contemplation 
of less beautiful letters might embellish the souls of 
our American youth quite as well as the most excel- 
lent letters of all—namely, those most excellent 
letters in which the Homeric poems, the tragedies 
of Sophocles, the dialogues of Plato, and the books 
of the New Testament have come down to us. These

THE GREEK VIEW OF SELF-DENIAL 17 
intervenient guides have argued, in effect, that any 
kind of mental pabulum is wholesome for a man, so 
long as he craves it; that one subject is just about 
as good as another in the curriculum, so long as no 
sneering demagogue has labeled it ‘aristocratic’; and 
that the main principle in a general education no 
longer is, ‘Let a man deny himself, and take up his 
eross daily,’ but, ‘Let every man follow his bent.’ 
Yes, and on the same principle let the nation follow 
its bent, disregarding that piece of counsel in the 
Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle: ‘We must also 
observe the extremes toward which we ourselves are 
specially prone, for different natures have different 
bents; and we can ascertain our natural tendencies 
by a consideration of our feelings of pleasure and 
pain. And we must drag ourselves in the direction 
opposite to our bent . . . as we do when we straighten 
warped timbers.’ Under the elective system in 
studies, the drift of the nation, as of individuals, led 
away from Greek, and for many reasons; the chief 
one being that Greek, like mathematics, is hard—it 
brings students to a consideration of their feelings 
of pain,—while, unlike a part of the mathematics, 
it has little obvious bearing upon the production and 
distribution of animal comforts and necessities. Yet 
there is reason to believe that the evil time of lost 
distinctions and educational anarchy in America is 
past, or passing; that Greek, for example, was in its 
greatest peril about the beginning of the present 
century ; that signs now point to its coming rehabili-

tation; and that not a few persons whom it formerly 
nourished, who latterly have been faint-hearted or 
treacherous in its defence, are ready to join in the 
acclamation when the subject once more comes to 
its own. 
In this rehabilitation, it is safe to predict, the 
teachers of the modern literatures, and in particular 
the teachers of English, will ultimately be found to 
have exercised a decided influence. It may not be 
improper to say that I yield to none in the venera- 
tion of my own subject, the English language and 
literature. I will even venture to affirm that the 
man who teaches his own vernacular has, with cer- 
tain manifest disadvantages, certain paramount ad- 
vantages in the general culture of his students over 
the teacher of any foreign literature, whether an- 
cient or modern; nay more, that certain advantages 
ean accrue to the pupil only on the condition that 
his teacher shall approach the ancient or foreign 
literature through the vernacular. If this be granted, 
there will be less danger of misunderstanding when 
we add that it is a most pernicious error to assume 
that one subject, considered in itself, is as impor- 
tant as another in a general scheme of studies. Prop- 
erly considered, English literature, the most signifi- 
cant of modern literatures unless it be the Italian, 
is a very feeble instrument of education indeed as 
compared with the ancient classics, if it be dissoci- 
ated from them; and if a severance were necessary 
between the ancient and modern, the modern had 
better be dropped from the curriculum, and the 
ancient, above all the Greek, retained.  
-P-A-G-E-29
  
  FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES 19 
Of course there is dt present no likelihood that 
such a mischance will occur. What seems probable 
is that the teachers of modern languages will more 
and more clearly recognize the futility of pursuing 
their respective subjects, French, German, Italian, 
English, with students who are ignorant of Greek 
and Latin. They will more and more insistently 
demand that what is fundamental, what precedes 
in point of logic as well as time, shall be acquired 
by students before they approach the special investi- 
gation of a modern literature. In fact, during the 
past few decades, while Greek may have seemed to 
be losing ground, and Latin perhaps not to be gain- 
ing, eminent professors of English have been send- 
ing out of our American universities a succession of 
young doctors of philosophy convinced that the hope 
of the classics is the hope of any thorough general 
culture, and that the cause of English will stand or 
fall with that of Greek and Latin. What these emi- 
nent teachers of English have been doing, the emi- 
nent teachers of other modern literatures have like- 
wise been doing, with the result that we possess in 
the best-trained younger men and women in some of 
the more popular subjects of instruction a growing 
influence in favor of the classics, to be added to the 
persistent influence of classical scholars themselves. 
It would be impossible to explain in brief the 
cogent reasons that move these teachers of modern 
literature in their effort to direct the younger gener- 
ation betimes into the study of Greek and Latin; 
yet a few reflections upon the relation of our own 
literature to the classics may be suggestive.  
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 ANCIENT AND MODERN LETTERS 
It will doubtless be granted that the first requisite 
in understanding a poem in any language is a meas- 
ure of sympathy with the author. The reader must 
have had certain experiences in common with the 
poet. Now, with exceptions so rare as to be negli- 
gible, the English poets, beginning with Cynewulf, 
Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton, and in- 
cluding Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Browning, have 
had the common experience of reading Latin—every 
one of these, for example, knew Virgil; and, from 
Spenser and Milton to Tennyson and Browning, most 
of them read Greek before they wrote English poetry 
of any consequence. The inference is obvious; we 
may put it in the form of the advice which one of 
them, Wordsworth, gave to his nephew: ‘Remember, 
first read the ancient classical authors; then come 
to us, and you will be able to judge for yourself 
which of us is worth reading.’+ Precisely so. Let 
our Freshmen and Sophomores ‘first study Greek 
and Latin (and we may add, history and mathemat- 
ies) ; then, in the Junior or, better, the Senior year, 
let them specialize if they will in English, and they 
will be able to judge for themselves what is worth 
while in that subject. As for prospective teachers of 
English, one may say to them: Remember, first ac- 
quaint yourselves with the method of interpretation 
and criticism that has been developed by twenty- 
three centuries of classical scholarship in Europe, 
and you will be able to judge for yourselves how

SHAKESPEARE AND PLUTARCH 21 
much or how little variation there need be in apply- 
ing ‘this method to the study of the vernacular. 
Again, it will surely be granted that on the part 
of a student, as distinct from the naive and unformed 
reader, no greater mistake can be made than to fancy 
a particular thought or expression in an English 
author to be original with him, and an indubitable 
mark of his special genius, when in fact it is not orig- 
inal with him, but comes, let us say, through successive 
intermediate translations, from the Greek of Plutarch. 
There is a striking description in Shakespeare’s Antony 
and Cleopatra of the Egyptian Queen as she first 
appeared to the hero: 
When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up his heart, 
upon the river of Cydnus... 
The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne, 
Burned on the water; the poop was beaten gold; 
Purple the sails, and so perfuméd that 
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver, 
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made 
The water which they beat to follow faster, 
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, 
It beggared all description; she did lie 
In her pavilion—cloth-of-gold of tissue— 
O’er-picturing that Venus where we see 
The fancy outwork nature; on each side her 
Stood pretty-dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, 
With divers-colored fans, whose wind did seem 
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, 
And what they undid did 
Is the description original? So far as we are

  OD. ANCIENT AND MODERN LETTERS 
aware, the only measure of its originality is the pas- 
sage, in North’s translation from the French version 
of Plutarch by Amyot, which Shakespeare happens 
to be adapting: 
‘When she was sent unto by divers letters. . . she 
. . mocked Antonius so much that she disdained to 
set forward otherwise, but to take her barge in the 
river of Cydnus, the poop whereof was of gold, the 
sails of purple, and the oars of silver, which kept 
stroke in rowing after the sound of the music of 
flutes, howboys, citherns, viols, and such other instru- 
ments as they played upon in the barge. And now 
for the person of herself: she was laid under a pavil- 
ion of cloth of gold of tissue, apparelled and attired 
like the goddess Venus commonly drawn in picture; 
and hard by her, on either hand of her, pretty fair 
boys apparelled as painters do set forth god Cupid, 
with little fans in their hands, with the which they 
fanned wind upon her.’ + 
Upon this showing, which seems to be the more 
original, Shakespeare, or the biographer of Chero- 
nea? And if Shakespeare and his age could draw 
so much inspiration from Plutarch at two or three 
removes, why has Plutarch disappeared from the 
circle of humane studies to-day—that Plutarch who 
subsequently made fruitful the genius of a modern 
educator, Rousseau? Moreover, Plutarch is himself 
a late and relatively unoriginal Greek. The ultimate 
sources of vital ideas, of philosophia, lie far behind 
him. 
But again, it often happens that some portion of 
a modern author is almost unintelligible unless we

  CLASSICAL IMAGES IN MODERN POETS 23 
are familiar with the Greek or Latin image which 
he has in mind. One is bound, for example, to think 
that Shelley’s picture of himself in lines 289-295 of 
Adonais must be well-nigh meaningless to the reader 
who is unacquainted with the Greek conception of 
the suffering wanderer Dionysus: 
His head was bound with pansies overblown, 
And faded violets, white, and pied, and blue; 
And a light spear topped with a cypress cone, 
Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew 
Yet dripping with the forest’s noonday dew, 
Vibrated, as the ever-beating heart 
Shook the weak hand that grasped it. 
And certainly it makes the voluptuous nature of the 
hero in Wordsworth’s poem, Ruth, more compre- 
hensible if our previous studies have shown us that 
the panther and the dolphin are the classic com- 
panions of Dionysus in his joy: 
He was a lovely youth! I guess 
The panther in the wilderness 
Was not so fair as he; 
And, when he chose to sport and play, 
No dolphin ever was so gay 
Upon the tropic sea.t 
‘The poetry of ancient Greece and Rome, and 
modern Italy, and our own country,’ says Shelley 
in his Preface to The Revolt of Islam, ‘has been to 
me, like external nature, a passion and an enjoy- 
ment. Such are the sources from which the ma- 
1 Ruth 37-42.  
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 ANCIENT AND MODERN LETTERS 
terials for the imagery of my poem have been drawn. 
I... have read the poets and the historians and 
the metaphysicians whose writings have been acces- 
sible to me.’ And he adds that the training he has 
received, with the feelings it has evoked, does not 
in itself constitute men poets, ‘but only prepares 
them to be the auditors of those who are.’ 
One might multiply examples without end. The 
truth is that English literature, not merely from 
the time of Chaucer, but from the very outset, far 
from being original in the ordinary acceptation of 
the word, is derivative to an extent undreamed of 
by the layman; and, though the direct sources of 
inspiration are often French authors or Spanish, or 
more often, perhaps, Italian, the chief immediate 
source of most of the ideas of our poets has been 
Latin literature—and the ultimate source (aside 
from the Old Testament) is Greek. That all roads 
lead to Rome is as true for English as for the modern 
Continental literatures; and a thousand roads lead 
back from Rome to Greece. Accordingly, the one 
great model of English prose is Cicero, whose model 
was Demosthenes; and the great writers of English 
prose from Milton to Burke, and from Burke to 
Newman, have been familiar with either or both. 
And the two chief wells whence English poets have 
drawn their notions of poetic style, as well as their 
mythological allusions, have been Virgil and Ovid— 
Virgil, who takes his inspiration from the Alexan- 
drians and from Homer, and Ovid, who collected and 
arranged nearly all that is known of Greco-Roman
-P-A-G-E-35
SHORT CUTS TO THE POETS 25 
mythology. To an age that is eager for almost any 
short cut to the intelligent reading of our English 
poets, we might say that a hundred hours devoted 
to Ovid and Virgil, even read in translations, would 
be worth thousands of hours spent upon most of the 
books in the lists that have been adopted for ‘en- 
trance English.’ Of the mythological allusions in 
Shakespeare ‘for which a definite source can be as- 
signed, it will be found that an overwhelming major- 
ity are directly due to Ovid, while the remainder, 
with few exceptions, are from Virgil.’ So says a 
competent investigator; and he adds: ‘A man famil- 
iar with these two authors, and with no others, 
would be able to make all the mythological allusions 
contained in the undisputed works of Shakespeare, 
barring some few exceptions’ *—which we may here 
neglect. 
But there is no need at present of advocating a 
short cut to the interpretation of modern authors; 
if there were, it would be time to remark upon the 
necessity of studying the English Bible before at- 
tempting to read authors who knew it by heart, and 
who use its thought and language as a common pos- 
session of the reading public. What needs to be 
advocated is a short cut to that inner substance of 
the Greek classics, that sophia which the Greeks es- 
pecially loved, that leaven which has diffused itself, 
by way of Rome, throughout all modern literatures. 
There is but one short cut to the substance of Greek, 
and that way lies through the letters which enfold

-P-A-G-E-36

it. They are not dead, and they do not kill. The 
eternal spirit which inhabits those letters imparts 
its life to them, and makes them beautiful. There 
really is no arguing about the matter; only they who 
know that spirit, incarnate in those letters, are in 
a position to speak of the value of either in a sys- 
tem of education. Emphatically must one add that 
they who have but dabbled in Greek, and have not 
loved it, or do not now love it, are not in a position 
to speak on the subject; nor are they who never had 
an opportunity of studying it. But the latter class 
at least may attend to the deliberate judgment of a 
teacher of English, a judgment based upon direct 
observation: In nine eases out of ten, the under- 
graduates who think the best thoughts and express 
them in the best way, and who utter right opinion 
when they examine the standard modern authors, 
are those who have studied, or are studying, Greek 
and Latin. ‘A great London editor told me,’ de- 
clares Goldwin Smith in his Reminiscences, ‘that 
the only members of his staff who wrote in good 
form from the beginning had practised Latin verse.’ 
‘In regard to antiquity as an element of education,’ 
says an eminent Russian, Professor Zielinski, ‘people 
are disposed to deem it merely a singular survival, 
which has maintained its footing in our modern 
school curriculum in some unintelligible way, and 
for some unintelligible reason, but which is destined 
to make a speedy and final disappearance. But the 
man who understands the true position: of affairs will 
rejoin that antiquity, . . . owing both to historical

and psychological causes, is, and must be considered, 
an organic element of education in European schools, 
and that, if it be destined to disappear entirely, its 
end will coincide with the end of modern European 
culture.’ + 
In America, such groups as the Society of Phi 
Beta Kappa are not to regard themselves as uncon- 
cerned in the cultivation of Greek letters and the 
diffusion of the Hellenic spirit. The influence pos- 
sessed by small, yet well-organized, groups is suffi- 
cient to divert thousands of new students every year 
into the pursuit of classical subjects; it is sufficient 
within a generation to convert twenty American uni- 
versities into as many leading institutions in the 
realm of humane studies; it is sufficient to accomplish 
this, if each individual who has faith in Greek will 
attempt at the beginning of every academic term to 
implant his faith in the heart of two other persons. 
The effort must begin with individuals. Let all who 
believe shake off their apathy and indifference, their 
timorous regard for vulgar opinion, their supine 
acquiescence in conditions which they know to be 
evil; and let them resolutely send their most promis- 
ing pupils, and younger fellow-students, to the tables 
where generations of those who hungered and thirsted 
after wisdom have been fed, and felt no lack. 
Meanwhile the members of our learned societies 
should strive, according to their powers, to make each 
society perform its office in the body educational. 
At many of our colleges and universities, an election

to the Society of Phi Beta Kappa, for example, con- 
stitutes the sole distinction that is conferred upon 
pure scholarship without an attendant pecuniary 
reward. By their words and actions the members 
should make clear that they believe in the distinc- 
tion; because it sets a premium on the men and wo- 
men whose nominal and real business in a place of 
study are eminently one and the same, that is, the 
business or activity of students; and because it puts 
the mark of high success upon the sort of men and 
women for whom American idealists have founded 
universities. After a period in education during 
which everything has been tolerated save orthodoxy, 
it might be well to tolerate orthodoxy. Furthermore, 
in order to enhance true distinctions, one need not 
hesitate openly to condemn, wherever it may appear, 
the shallow thinking that gives honor to the man 
whose nominal business is study, but who slights his 
manifest duty, and, apparently, succeeds at some- 
thing else. A characteristic of the vulgar, says the 
caustic Shakespearean Ulysses, is their frantie wor- 
ship of a tinsel success that is not conjoined with the 
permanent issues of life: 
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin, 
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds ...

THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH AND 
THE STUDY OF THE CLASSICS’ 
HE ‘cultural value’ of the classics is a large topic, 
which we must in some way restrict. There 
will be a suitable restriction if we discuss the value 
of an early training in Greek and Latin as it appears 
to a teacher of English, after an experience of a 
dozen years and more with pupils in the modern sub- 
ject. This done, it will not be improper to indulge 
in a few general reflections. 
Let us have specially in mind the needs and the 
opportunities of first-rate students when they leave 
the preparatory school, and are not immediately to 
take part in active life. They are about to enter 
the academic course of a college or university, where 
they will be called upon to write numerous essays 
in the mother tongue, and to read selections from 
the standard modern authors. What qualities, and 
what training, should we expect them to bring to 
the performance of these tasks? To write a fair 
essay presupposes a, certain grade of cultivation; and

HINTS FROM THE POETS 31 
to sympathize with one of the great English poets— 
with Spenser or Milton, for example, or, let us say, 
with a lesser poet like Coleridge—means that one 
must have something in common, in the way of train- 
ing, with a man who wrote well, and who did s0, 
partly because of his genius, but partly also because 
he was well-taught. This immediately raises the 
question, how have the masters of the English tongue 
been educated—how did they learn to write? 
Before suggesting an answer to this question, it 
may not be out of place to marvel at teachers of 
English, and of other modern literatures, at our 
administrative officers in the higher education, and 
above all at our professors of pedagogy, for their 
general lack of interest in certain inquiries which no 
teacher, and no overseer in the art of teaching, should 
neglect. Their interests commonly are of another 
sort. They have traced the general history of educa- 
tion, and the history of various movements in educa- 
tion, and can tell you, it may be, what Plato and 
Comenius, or Herbart and Rousseau, have said or 
thought about the discipline of youth; perhaps they 
ean even explain the relation of experimental psy- 
chology to what we used to call ‘mental arithmetic’ ; 
but they have given little heed to the way in which 
great teachers actually have taught, or men of ac- 
knowledged attainments have acquired their power. 
We need not pursue this line of thought beyond 
remarking that the authors in whose works our col- 
legians will read, and about whom they will write, 
had, almost to a man, a classical training, and did 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
32 ENGLISH AND THE CLASSICS 
not secure their command over the English tongue 
without some acquaintance with Greek and Latin. 
The record of the studies of Chaucer, Spenser, Shake- 
speare, Milton, Pope, Dryden, Gray, Wordsworth, 
Tennyson, and Browning, and of Bacon, Chatham, 
Johnson, Burke, Ruskin, and Newman, represents 
the great experiment in English education—an ex- 
periment lasting through centuries, and a successful 
one, the results of which no teacher or theorist on” 
teaching in the field of English may set aside. 
So much in general; it may be wise to add a con- 
erete illustration. Let us consider the weekly rou- 
tine of the upper class in Christ’s Hospital, the school 
where Samuel Taylor Coleridge was prepared for 
Cambridge, and was inflamed with a love of English 
—where, in fact, he laid the foundations of a literary 
training. Here is approximately what he and the 
best of his fellow-pupils, the ‘Senior Grecians,’ were 
doing at the famous charity school at London in the 
year 1790: 
‘Monday morning: Homer or Tragic Chorus by 
heart; Greek Tragedy. Monday afternoon: He- 
brew Psalter; Horace or Juvenal. Written exercise 
for Monday: English and Latin theme, in alternate 
weeks. 
‘Tuesday morning: Xenophon at sight; Homer. 
Tuesday afternoon: Mathematical Scholium. Ex-

‘As the time of continuance on the Grecian’s form 
is always three, and generally four, years,’ says the 
historian of the school, ‘a very considerable acquaint- 
ance with the higher classics, as well as a readiness 
in the composition of English, Greek, and Latin, 
verse and prose, is easily attainable within this 
period, and forms a substantial groundwork for the 
more extensive researches of academical study.’* 
‘At school,’ says Coleridge himself, ‘I enjoyed 
the inestimable advantage of a very sensible, though 
at the same time a very severe, master [James Boyer]. 
He early moulded my taste to the preference of 
Demosthenes to Cicero, of Homer and Theocritus to 
Virgil, and again of Virgil to Ovid. He habituated 
me to compare Lucretius, (in such extracts as I then 
read) Terence, and, above all, the chaster poems of 
Catullus, not only with the Roman poets of the so- 
ealled silver and brazen ages, but with even those 
of the Augustan era; and on grounds of plain sense 
and universal logic to see and assert the superiority 
of the former in the truth and nativeness both of 
their thoughts and diction. At the same time that

we were studying the Greek tragic poets, he made 
us read Shakespeare and Milton as lessons; and they 
were the lessons, too, which required most time and 
trouble to ‘‘bring up’’ so as to escape his censure. 
I learnt from him that poetry, even that of the lofti- 
est and, seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a 
logic of its own, as severe as that of science, and more 
difficult, because more subtle, more complex, and de- 
pendent upon more, and more fugitive, causes. In 
the truly great poets, he would say, there is a reason 
assignable, not only for every word, but for the posi- 
tion of every word.’+ 
The career of Coleridge shows the way in which 
the great experiment, if one may so describe it, 
worked out in a particular instance. Such instances 
might be multiplied;* and the inference as to the 
nature of a liberal education, which means an edu- 
eation in good taste, would not be obscure. But the 
experiment of a classical training still continues, not 
only in England and on the Continent, but even in 
America; nor can we make light of the results as 
they appear, or are wanting, in the successive genera- 
tions of young met and women who throng to our 
higher institutions of learning in search of what is 
termed culture. What can we discover from an in- 
spection of our students? 
First, those relatively few young persons of our 
day who possess an adequate grounding in Greek 
and Latin have this in common with the English

CLASSICAL STUDENTS KNOW GRAMMAR 35 
poets: they know something about grammar—not 
English grammar specifically, nor Greek, nor Latin, 
but grammar in general. They recognize subject, 
copula, and predicate, whenever they meet them; 
they have an understanding for order and relation 
in the parts of a sentence. They are accustomed to 
see the elements of language as elements, and are 
not ineapable of arranging them in orderly fashion. 
They know the difference between a temporal and a 
causal connective; they can distinguish between post 
hoc and propter hoc—a very important distinction in 
life. The reason why they can do so is that, whereas 
it is possible to express oneself either loosely or 
distinctly in English, according to one’s previous 
education, both Greek and Latin compel the school- 
boy to make a sharp distinction between one thought 
and another. This is precisely what they who have 
missed a severe linguistic training are never prone 
to do. The teacher of a modern language and litera- 
ture should in this case know whereof he speaks. 
He should know why he is glad to welcome students 
of Latin and Greek to classes in English. There 
may be exceptions; if so, these are negligible. In 
the long run, they who have done well with Greek 
or Latin in the preparatory school can write pas- 
sable English as Freshmen in the university, and 
they who have had neither are ungrammatical and 
otherwise slovenly in usage. 
Next, the youth with a classical training has a 
superior knowledge, not only of connectives that are 
by themselves non-significant, but also of the signifi-
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 ENGLISH AND THE CLASSICS 
eant elements in the English vocabulary. In par- 
ticular, as compared with the youth who lacks that 
training, he recognizes and can use what we call 
‘learned’ words—that is, the sort of words that an 
educated man employs, and an uneducated man does 
not. Year after year one may toil with successive 
groups of uneducated Sophomores over the meaning 
and pronunciation of the sixth stanza in Coleridge’s 
Dejection, an Ode, that stanza in which the author 
has epitomized his tragic life. And why this recur- 
rent toil? Because the poet has here made use of 
terms like resource, research, and abstruse— 
And haply by abstruse research to steal 
From my own nature all the natural man— 
This was my sole resource— 
which fifteen out of twenty in a class will mispro- 
nounce, and which they do not comprehend, being 
unfamiliar with the Latin that survives in modern 
French and English. The ugly combination ‘résearch 
work’ (and who is responsible for this pronuncia- 
tion?) they have heard, perhaps in a laboratory; it 
does not, one may readily imagine, occur in any 
English poet. Our fifteen Sophomores will dimly 
gather what the combination signifies, because in 
intellectual work they see their ancient foe; they 
will look wise or otherwise when told that research 
is a ‘learned’ word; they will smile when they hear 
that its fellow is one of those that students of Latin 
and English call ‘popular.’ 
Again, the fit though few among those undergradu- 
ates who engage in the study of English have more 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  
THE SENSE OF ORDER 37 
orderly minds for the larger details, as well as the 
smaller, in written composition. They excel their 
untutored comrades in joining sentence to sentence 
when they build up a paragraph, and in linking 
paragraph to paragraph to form an essay. And why 
is this? Because the fit though few have had their 
mental operations regulated by a progress through 
some portions of Greek and Latin literature; and 
because the Greek and Latin authors that have come 
down to us differ from the rank and file of modern 
authors in evincing a better sequence of thought. 
Of course we must guard against any misapprehen- 
sion that the ancient classics are to be deemed in all 
ways superior to modern literature. On the con- 
trary, it is evident that in developing a boy of our 
generation into a clear-headed gentleman, if the an- 
cients will help more in making him clear-headed (and 
yet to some extent gentle as well), the modern writers, 
or some of them, can perform the greater service in 
creating within him a clean and tender heart. The 
fact remains, however, that in Sophocles the train of 
thought is more cogent than in Shakespeare, as the 
internal order of a speech in the Odyssey is more 
lucid than in Paradise Lost. 
Further, the boy with the classical training, since 
he is not so apt to be muddle-headed, is more likely 
to discriminate against false sentiment in what he 
reads, and still more likely to object to metrical 
bombast or nonsense when it is offered him as poetry. 
‘Coleridge!’ said his redoubtable teacher at Christ’s 
Hospital, ‘the connections of a declamation are not 
4  
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 _ ENGLISH AND THE CLASSICS 
the transitions of poetry. Bad, however, as they 
are, they are better than apostrophes and ‘‘O thou’s,’’ 
for at the worst they are something like common 
sense.’* Since the time of Coleridge, as the influ- 
ence of classical poetry has declined, the besetting 
sin of poets has been a lack of precision and good 
sense. In her fumbling description of A Lost Chord, 
Adelaide Procter writes: 
It seemed the harmonious echo 
From our discordant life. 
The echo of a discord is not harmonious. A boy 
who has studied the fable of Echo and Narcissus in 
the Metamorphoses of Ovid is aware that in litera- 
ture, as in his own experience among the hills, an 
echo is true when it closely resembles the original 
sound. As an able critic notes, ‘Sentimentality has, 
in this disguise or that, existed and poisoned Eng- 
lish poetry at all times since the sixteenth century. 
But, for its fellow vice, vagueness, this is otherwise. 
For vagueness there has indeed been no time so 
fertile as the first forty years of the nineteenth 
century.’® The beginning of the twentieth century 
is not free from it. Greek poetry in the fifth cen- 
tury before Christ is not vague or sentimental, nor is 
Homer or Virgil. When our Freshman is imbued 
with the spirit of Greek and Latin verse, he is in

HIGHER ADVANTAGES 39 
some measure armed against the insidious attacks 
of bad taste. 
Finally, the boy who has been drilled in the clas- 
sics has an immense advantage because he knows 
something of ancient story, of tradition—of mythol- 
ogy in a wide sense—and is not unacquainted with 
those living forms, divine yet human, in which the 
ancients embodied their highest conceptions of man, 
and their noblest religious convictions, the head and 
front of their culture. In dealing with English 
authors, he is not continually checked and baffled 
by allusions which were intended to be clear, and 
are so to an educated public. To the boy who is 
otherwise trained, that is, untrained for the study 
of English, they are not clear, and may envelop in 
an atmosphere of uncertainty passage after passage 
in any substantial author that he happens to take 
up. Can he appreciate George Eliot in Romola when 
she likens the shifty Tito Melema to Bacchus, if he 
is wholly ignorant of ancient ideas concerning the 
slippery and unstable Dionysus? And how can he 
read Milton if he is unfamiliar, not only with the 
Bible, but also with Homer and Virgil? For, be it 
noted that, whatever the reason, a decline of inter- 
est in the Scriptures has gone hand in hand with a 
growing indifference to the literary art of Greece 
and Rome. Indeed, one is reminded that Charles 
the Great, at a critical juncture for modern civiliza- 
tion, enjoined the study of letters, that is, of Latin, 
upon his clergy, in order that the study of the Scrip- 
tures might not languish in his realm. Would that  
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 ENGLISH AND THE CLASSICS 
a modern statesman might arise with equal power 
and foresight to influence our general education, 
and that shortly no one having the reputation of a 
cultivated man might be unable to read at first hand 
the most sublime of all mysteries, in the Greek of 
the New Testament! The boy with a classical train- 
ing has immediate access to the highest ideal of man- 
kind. 
In this gamut of advantages we have run from 
small details to large considerations. We began with 
the discipline a youth may receive through Greek 
and Latin in using the elements of expression; we 
have come to the benefit he may derive from these 
subjects in the interpretation of human discourse, 
or of a masterpiece as a whole, and in the assimila- 
tion of humanizing ideas. It is common, of course, 
to separate the disciplinary function of the classics 
from the cultural; but it is better to assume that no 
such cleavage exists. One never can draw a sharp 
line of demarcation between the outward form of 
expression and the idea that is expressed, or view 
the spirit apart from the letter through which it is 
revealed. And so long as this is so, literary disci- 
pline, involving a detailed examination of language, 
cannot be severed from literary culture. 
Indeed, it cannot be too often observed that all 
culture is unified, and that its final aim is to elimi- 
nate the trivial and the false from our ideal of hu- 
manity; to abstract from the best sources, however 
remote or neglected, whatever will define and en- 
noble that ideal; and to transmit an ever more vital 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE UNITY OF ALL CULTURE 41 
image of humanity for daily contemplation by the 
next and succeeding generations. This is what 
teachers of the humanities are striving to do, whether 
they know it or not, and whether they deal with 
Greek and Latin, or with French or German or 
English. But as is shown in the history of Europe, 
so in the development of the individual American, 
the basic elements of this ideal are most promptly 
secured through direct contact with Greek and Latin. 
‘When a foundation has been laid by skilful instruc- 
tion in the elements, the teachers of the modern 
Christian literatures can proceed with the super- 
structure. 
The destiny of Greek and Latin as a means of 
culture primarily rests with teachers of the classics, 
and secondarily with principals of schools and other 
men of influence in preparatory education. 
It is important that teachers of the classics at the 
present time should feel the great need of mutual 
recognition and support among all the friends of 
culture in America. But perhaps the need is great- 
est as between scholars in the ancient languages and 
students of the modern vernacular. They depend 
upon each other in performing their due service to 
the State; for a study of the ancient classics with no 
attention to their bearing upon modern life is only 
less futile than the study of English when it is dis- 
sociated from the accumulated experience of the past. 
Yet we should not exclude from our ideal organiza- 
tion any person whatsoever who contributes to the 
enrichment and intensifying of human life. And,
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 ENGLISH AND THE CLASSICS 
perhaps, all told, the friends of real as opposed to 
seeming culture are not so few as teachers of the 
humanities sometimes imagine. Few or many, if 
they would but make their cause a common one, they 
would hold the fort against every assault. The foes 
of thorough culture, the haters of ideas and ideals, 
are many—how often are they professed opponents 
of Greek! And the officious heralds of a shallow 
and unmeaning culture, who abhor the industry 
without which no cultivation ever was obtained, may 
be fraudulent and dangerous. They are not, and 
can not be, at one in their efforts, since they have 
nothing positive to unite them; but they do succeed 
in deterring young people who are ignorant of what 
is good and what is bad in education from taking up 
the proper studies at the proper time. 
The foe is numerous but unorganized. Upon what 
ground can the friends of culture best unite? To 
what practical effort can the teachers of the humani- 
ties most profitably devote their superabundant 
strength? Obviously to the maintenance and ad- 
vancement of the study of Greek. The defence 
should be concentrated where the attack is most fre- 
quent. If Greek were ultimately to disappear from 
the curriculum of all the schools, Latin in no long 
time probably would make a similar exit, and sooner 
or later the serious study of modern languages and 
literatures would be discountenanced, too. Every 
effort that is made for the study of Greek is favor- 
able to humane learning in its entirety. If Greek 
is duly cared for, Latin will take care of itself, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
FRIENDS OF GREEK 43 
so will English. If the teachers of all these subjects 
would combine for the rehabilitation of Greek, no 
enemy could withstand them. The program is simple. 
All that is needed is a measure of faith like that of 
the Centurion, whose suggestions every one followed 
because he expected it. If the teacher of English, 
or the teacher of Latin, were to advise a small num- | 
ber of promising young men and women every year 
to study Greek, they would do it. 
There are, indeed, signs of hope for the future. 
To judge from the utterances of university presi- 
dents and the like, the cause of Greek is now grow- 
ing stronger in the eastern section of the country; 
the conservative South has never lost its hold upon 
the subject; and the great Middle West is imitative 
in matters of education, so that a renaissance of any 
sort in New England would ere long be duplicated 
in those western sections which draw so many of their 
teachers from the older universities. One. thing, at 
least, is very significant. Within the last few years, 
our teachers of the classics have become noticeably 
less apologetic in their speech and attitude; they are 
growing more and more courageous. It would seem 
that they need only to act as if they were not losing 
but winning, and to recognize and abet their friends 
in other subjects, and their cause might be saved. 
As for numerous teachers of Latin, they should evince 
a higher selfishness, and not be but penny-wise. Too 
many have been merely bent upon saving themselves 
for the moment, instead of rushing to defend the 
point where the enemy has been most successful.
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 ENGLISH AND THE CLASSICS 
And as for the teachers of the modern languages, 
they should act upon the knowledge they possess; 
they are aware that a first-hand acquaintance with 
the classics is the indispensable prerequisite to any 
real insight into Italian, French, and Spanish, as 
well as English and German. 
Principals of secondary schools doubtless are open 
to reason, and the arguments in favor of Greek and 
Latin are many and varied, virtually all of them 
being found in Professor Kelsey’s collection of 
papers, by several hands, in the volume entitled 
Latin and Greek in American Education (published 
by the Macmillan Company). It is hard to believe 
that any one could resist the evidence contained in 
that volume—for example, in the last section, Sym- 
posium VII, Formal Discipline, under the headings, 
The Doctrine of Formal Discipline in the Light of 
the Principles of General Psychology (by James R. 
Angell), The Effects of Training on Memory (by 
W. B. Pillsbury), and The Relation of Special Train- 
ing to General Intelligence (by Charles H. Judd). 
To every man who has a voice in guiding our 
secondary education, either the arguments advanced 
by those who have studied the classics to some pur- 
pose are sound and convincing, or they are not; 
but until he has fairly weighed the arguments, the 
sensible man will withhold his opinion. If he is in 
a position where he must pass judgment, such a man 
will take pains to inform himself. For nine out of 
ten bright boys and girls, Greek either does what it 
is said to do, or it does not. We may leave out of 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST GREEK 45 
account the rare exception of a tenth, brilliant mind 
that is said to be incapable of learning this language. 
We hear of such minds, and one is inclined to think 
they must exist; for myself, I never have met one. 
Capable boys, and some dull ones, too, have been 
able to master the subject when they have not been 
spoiled for it by bad teaching. And we may also 
disregard the incompetent teacher of Greek, the 
pedant who does not make his pupils read as soon 
as they can, and lets them form the wretched habit 
of treating the language as if it were a Chinese 
puzzle, or the ignoramus who himself is unable to 
read continuously in either of the ancient tongues. 
These scattered individuals we may pass by. In 
general, it may be supposed, the teachers of the 
classics are as well trained to do their duty, and 
perform their office as well, on the whole, as any other 
body of instructors in the high school. If not, the 
solution of the difficulty lies in securing better 
teachers of the classics. It is no reasonable solution 
to throw these subjects out of the schools. 
To return, then: either Greek affects the subse- 
quent career of the pupil as is said to be the case, 
or it does not. If it does not, we are free to neglect 
that study in the schools. But if it does so affect 
it, we are bound to promote the study—unless we are 
willing to lose our own self-respect. If one never 
has read Greek, or, having read a little long ago, has 
forgotten the experience, how can one decide the 
question of its value? No doubt the books of Kelsey 
and Zielinski? would help the formation of an inde-

-P-A-G-E-56
46 ENGLISH AND THE CLASSICS 
pendent judgment; but it is desirable to look at 
some of the Greek masterpieces in translation. The 
hesitating principal, or the doubtful member of the 
school board, might read the Republic of Plato in 
the version of Jowett, and the Nicomachean Ethics 
of Aristotle as translated by Welldon, and then, let 
us say, Jowett’s rendering of the Politics. If, being 
previously unacquainted with those fountains of 
good sense and lofty inspiration, one were to find 
in them something of permanent value, it would be 
right to believe the persons who have read the orig- 
inal as well as the pale translation, and who de- 
clare that the Greek is better than the English ver- 
sion. And finally the principal might consider what 
he owes to the boys and girls whose education has 
been entrusted to his hands by his nation and his 
Maker.

GOOD USAGE* 
HE following’ remarks concern our national 
rr language, and incidentally the study of Latin. 
Our chief topic being, not simply usage, but good 
usage, we may begin with a recognized authority 
upon the subject, and one who is likewise an ex- 
emplar in his practice. In the Ars Poetica Horace 
observes : 
Yes, words long faded may again revive, 
And words may fade now blooming and alive, 
If Usage wills it so, to whom belongs 
The rule, the law, the government of tongues. 
So runs the spirited rendering by Conington, That 
we may be sure to catch the unexpected emphasis of 
the Latin poet, let us take also the matter-of-fact 
translation by Wickham: 
‘Many a term which has fallen from use shall have 
a second birth, and those shall fall that are now in 
high honor, if so Usage shall will it, in whose hands 
is the arbitrament, the right and rule of speech.’ 
1 Adapted from an address delivered at the meeting of the 
American Classical League in Cincinnati, June 24, 1920, An- 
other version of the paper, but under the same title, appears in 
the University of California Chronicle 22. 259-269 (July, 1920). 
The present version is printed with the kind consent of the 
editor of the Chronicle. 
47
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 GOOD USAGE 
It is often supposed that this tyrannous usage is 
the blind custom of the mass of the people—though 
we find nothing in Horace to warrant the supposi- 
tion; rather, both he and easily observed facts seem 
to indicate that the arbiters of custom are, first of 
all, the poets. When you are in doubt about the 
meaning or pronunciation of a word, or its propriety, 
you turn to a dictionary—for example, to the New 
English Dictionary of Sir James Murray and his 
fellows; there you see how Milton, or Gray, or Words- 
worth, or Tennyson, has used it; and ever after you 
try to use the word in that way. The statement of 
Horace is in keeping with this habit, and is the re- 
verse of the popular notion. He means that the 
favorite words of poetasters, and of the crowd, are 
not likely to endure. He means that the diction of 
great poets, on the other hand, has great vitality. 
In the standard authors of an earlier day he has 
noted words and phrases that seem to have disap- 
peared, and seem to be replaced by new and popular 
terms, but which come to life again in the verse of 
a well-read genius like himself. He perceives that 
good words of an elder time have actually come to 
life again in his own works. He knows that good 
usage is the custom of men of good taste, and exists 
through the consent of the learned. Thus, if we may 
illustrate his contention by an example from Eng- 
lish, the adjective cedarn was employed by Milton 
in Comus— 
about the cedarn alleys; 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
POETS REVIVE GOOD WORDS 49 
it was revived by Coleridge, a diligent student of 
Milton, in Kubla Khan— 
Down the green hill, athwart a cedarn cover; 
then Sir Walter Scott took it from Coleridge; and 
through these two poets it lives on in modern Eng- 
lish verse. In similar wise Lord Tennyson revived 
the verb burgeon, ‘to bud,’ and other writers have 
accepted it from him. 
That the mass of the people have an influence upon 
usage it is perhaps idle to doubt. Certainly the 
plain man likes to think this influence very great. 
And not the plain man only; one American pundit 
or journalist quotes with satisfaction an utterance 
of the philologist Darmesteter : 
‘Universal suffrage has not always existed in poli- 
tics, but it has always existed in linguistics. In 
matters of language the people are all-powerful and 
infallible, because their errors sooner or later estab- 
lish themselves as lawful.’ 
Yet the process of growth and decay that Horace 
observed in the poets goes on in the masses too, only 
more swiftly. Like leaves in the autumn, the crowd 
dies, to make room for another generation; and its 
words die likewise. In all this world of change, 
nothing dies so quickly as the words of some people. 
But good usage implies an element of permanence 
in language; the conception itself is the antithesis 
of change. It is not the crowd that can truly affirm: 
‘Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words 
shall not pass away.’ Moreover, when a word that 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  50 GOOD USAGE 
has seemed to perish is brought back to life, it is not 
brought back by the crowd; it is brought back to the 
crowd by some one who is in the crowd, but not of 
it. Ordinarily it is brought back to the rest of us 
by a poet, or at all events through the instrumental- 
ity of some piece of literature that has seemed to 
merit preservation in type or writing. 
Good usage clearly is something better and more 
vital than average usage. The people who say ‘Lun- 
non,’ ‘Brummagem,’ ‘N’Yawk,’ ‘Cincinnatah,’ and 
‘Frisco,’ have been, are, and will be, far more numer- 
ous than they who have said, now say, and will say, 
‘London,’ ‘Birmingham,’ ‘New York,’ ‘Cincinnati,’ 
and ‘San Francisco.’ The crowd says ‘this much’ 
and ‘that much’; good usage, and good syntax, favor 
‘thus much’ and ‘so much.’ We modify an adjec- 
tive, not by another adjective, but by an adverb? 
And, again, we do not use an adverb to modify a 
noun, nor sign ourselves, ‘Sincerely, Warren Wilson,’ 
but close the letter with ‘Sincerely yours,’ and then 
the proper noun. The crowd says ‘I claim,’ instead 
of ‘I assert’ or ‘I contend’; it ‘voices its sentiments,’ 
instead of uttering them. In common usage we hear 
‘Address,’ ‘inquiry,’ ‘rémance,’ ‘résearch’; in good 
usage, ‘addréss,’ ‘inquiry,’ ‘romance,’ ‘research.’ 
Good usage does not tolerate the ugly but familiar 
combination ‘résearch work’ any more than it would 
tolerate the tautological expression ‘search work.’ 
In common usage we have ‘verzhion,’ ‘converzhion,’ 
‘excurzhion,’ ‘Azhia,’ ‘Perzhia’—that is, with the 
sound of zh, not sh. Byron properly rhymes ‘ver-
-P-A-G-E-61
  
GOOD USAGE AND COMMON USAGE 51 
sion’ and ‘Excursion’ with ‘assertion.’ In these 
cases the voice does not carry through from vowel 
or semivowel to vowel; there is an intervening un- 
voiced consonant as at the end of the word hush. 
And similarly, in spite of the crowd, we should say 
‘Rossetti’ (not ‘Rozeti’?) and ‘Renaissance’ (not 
‘Renaizance’), with a true hiss, made by the breath 
alone, not with a, buzz produced by the voice too. It 
is unlikely that the usage of the many will ever 
make the pronunciation ‘Rossetti’? wrong. 
Unfortunately we have had a school of persons, 
who ought to have known better, advocating the no- 
tion that the usage of the crowd, the usage of the 
many, does dominate, and should dominate, in mat- 
ters of expression. The late Professor Lounsbury, 
I grieve to say, was one of these ‘authorities’; and 
there are professed advocates now living, not merely 
of average usage, but of bad usage, as if it were good 
usage. However, the average of any class—even of 
the class we call ‘authorities’—falls short, and some- 
times far short, of the good; nor is there any reason 
why a false conception of democracy should be im- 
ported into the realm of linguistic usage. Words 
are like men in being either average, or below the 
average, or above the average; they are better or 
worse in character and in origin, and better or worse, 
too, according to their associations. 
Usage is, of course, the usage of all, when some 
definite custom really is the possession of all those 
who speak a given language. Some part of our cur- 
rent English doubtless is the common property of

every one who knows the tongue. But at most only 
a fraction of any language is used alike by all who 
speak it. At most only some of the words are always 
pronounced in the same way; only certain construe- 
tions are common to all sections of the country and 
all stages in the scale of society. Within limits, then, 
we do have to consider the usage of the whole num- 
ber, as against the idiosyncrasies of the individual. 
But we must distinguish between the usage of the 
whole number and the common practice of any frac- 
tion, large or small, of that whole number. What 
we call the crowd, or the many, are not all. How- 
ever large a part, they are not the whole. 
The whole is, in fact, made up of parts, or groups, 
some of which have more power in linguistic usage 
than others. When there is a possibility of choice, 
the voices or votes are not all equally telling. Of 
all the voices of men in Homeric times, only the 
voice that is heard in the Iliad and the Odyssey has 
carried down to us. Now scholars are pretty well 
agreed that the diction of the Homeric poems is not 
a popular language at all; it was a special diction 
devised for a special kind of verse. Of all the voices 
that were heard in the age of Pericles, only a few 
have come to us—the voices of the philosophers, his- 
torians, orators, and poets. Among the Romans, the 
voice of Cicero and that of Virgil have produced the 
most widespread and distinct echoes in all subse- 
quent times. From the fourth century a.p. the ca- 
dences of Jerome reached the ears of our northern 
ancestors at the end of the sixth, when the mission-

aries brought his Latin translation of the Bible to 
pagan England; nor have those cadences ceased to 
resound at the present time, whether in the Latin 
Bible or the English. In our own day, the influence 
of the few continues to be relatively more powerful 
in linguistic matters than the influence of the many ; 
and these few have ‘generally had, among other 
things, a training in Latin. If this truth is not 
evident now, future years will make it so. 
Among the groups that compose the entire mass of 
speakers or writers (the illiterate, the half-taught, 
and the well-taught, all taken together), the follow- 
ing are very influential: public orators—for example, 
clergymen, educators, and statesmen; singers; schol- 
ars—for example, Sir James Murray and the other 
editors of the New English Dictionary; poets—for 
example, Mr. Kipling, who has studied Horace, and 
whose words are often more fully alive in the ear 
of the reader than are the words of the reader him- 
self. Nor may we forget the typesetters, the men 
who actually print the books, who exert an enor- 
mous influence, though one that is seldom noticed, 
upon linguistic usage. The best of them know Latin. 
They are very conservative, and, even without the 
help of the poets, orators, and the rest, would do 
much to maintain the purity of the English lan- 
guage. Think of the numbers of them in the British 
Isles, and the British colonies, from Canada, to South 
Africa, India, Australia, and New Zealand—not to 
mention the United States of America. The Ameri-

cial body, has accomplished nothing in the face of 
the silent, natural, habitual conservatism of printers 
from Edinburgh and Oxford to Calcutta and Mel- 
bourne. Publishers, too, are more likely to study 
and preserve good usage than to indulge in innova- 
tions. 
In the long run, we may say that all the influen- 
tial groups have studied Latin, if not Greek as well, 
and that all are conservative, especially the frater- 
nity of poets. Thus Wordsworth objected to the 
use of the nouns spring and autumn as adjectives, 
vehemently advocating the employment of the true 
adjectives vernal and autumnal instead. And, quite 
in the spirit of Horace, he remarks: ‘ ‘‘Joying,’’ 
for joy or joyance, is not to my taste; indeed, I ob- 
ject to such liberties upon principle. We should 
soon have no language at all if the unscrupulous 
coinage of the present day were allowed to pass, and 
become a precedent for the future. One of the first 
duties of a writer is to ask himself whether his 
thought, feeling, or image cannot be expressed by 
existing words or phrases, before he goes about creat- 
ing new terms, even when they are justified by the 
analogies of the language.’ Horace allows the poet 
to invent a new term only under stress of necessity, 
and in that case advises him to derive his new term 
by studying the best sources of the language. For 
him the best source was Greek; for us the best 
sources are Latin, Greek, and Old English.

generation becomes good in another, and take pleas- 
ure in noting that expressions once condemned by 
careful writers have eventually become established 
in the language. But nearly every one likes para- 
dox, while few care to study the efforts by which a 
Chaucer, a Tindale, a Spenser, a Gray, and a Words- 
worth have purified the English tongue. It is, of 
course, true that a number of words to which Swift 
objected are now tolerated; but more noteworthy 
are the expressions that have been approved by the 
judicious, and have remained in use. Meanwhile it 
is equally true that chance coinages seldom long 
survive. Mr. Kipling’s ‘scumfish,’ for example, in 
. . . leaping lines that scumfish through the pines, 
has not, it would seem, taken root; so far as I have 
observed, he himself used it but once, in the Road 
Song of the Bandar-log. The truth is that most of 
what is bad or casual in one age does not become 
legal tender in the next; the chances are against it. 
The concerted action of scholars and literary men in 
general is against it. When education in a country 
is systematic and good, the tendency of any language 
is to improve, partly by additions critically made, 
partly by critical elimination. Moreover, slang dies 
a natural death so quickly that a man who has been 
absent for two or three years in a foreign country 
will not half understand what the young folk are 
saying when he returns to his own land and attends 
to the new ephemeral growth. The slang of five years 
ago is for the most part utterly dead, and never will

be heard again. Good English and good Latin re- 
main steadfast; nor are they likely ever to be dis- 
joined. 
People are fond, too, of showing that what is 
called bad usage can all be explained by natural 
laws; that it has its origin in psychology, or in the 
earlier stages of the language, or that it has a paral- 
lel in the good usage of another tongue. The double 
negative of illiterate English, they say, is only the 
counterpart of the double negative in Attic Greek. 
Well, ‘He didn’t know nothing about Latin’ may 
be literally rendered into Greek that is good; but 
it isn’t good English. It is bad English for the 
reason that good writers do not use it. That it can 
be explained by natural laws does not help, for 
everything that happens can be so explained. The ac- 
tions of a thief have a natural cause. Bad manners 
and bad conduct of every sort, filthy language and 
base thoughts, as well as bad grammar and false 
pronunciation, can all be explained by something or 
other. According to Euripides, Menander, and 
Saint Paul, it is evil communications that corrupt 
good manners; and the term includes every kind of 
bad usage. To lay bare the causes of a phenomenon 
does not justify our acceptance of any practice as a 
norm. And further, if illiterate English on occasion 
will turn into tolerable Greek and Latin, slovenly 
English can more often be rendered by force into 
slovenly Greek and Latin. But more important is 
the fact that the best of Plato can often be translated 
word for word into the best English; and yet more
-P-A-G-E-67
GOOD USAGE IS SECOND NATURE 57 
important is the fact that they who have practised 
Greek and Latin composition, and have rendered 
Plato and Cicero into English, write a better Eng- 
lish style of their own than they who have not en- 
joyed this sort of literary education. 
Good usage also is natural, and has its origin and 
laws. It is nature improved by art; and art like- 
wise has its origin and laws. Good usage is the 
custom of the trained writer and speaker. It is an 
art that has become second nature. It is not the 
impulse or habit of the old Adam, but the wisdom 
of an Adam regenerate. Like all other arts, it is 
based upon a study of nature. The student of lan- 
guage aims to find out what nature at her best is 
trying to produce;. and this he strives to perpetuate, 
being himself one of the agencies in the survival of 
the fittest. Words are natural forms, like living 
animals—like mice and such small deer. You may 
clip their tails for a generation, or for more than 
one—and the next generation will have tails of the 
old length, if usage so determines. Nature is too 
strong for the ‘simplified’ spellers. It is not too 
strong for the student. of Greek and Latin. It was 
not too strong for Milton, who made extensive collec- 
tions for a thesaurus of classical Latin usage. With 
nature the poet joins forces, and so do the editors 
of the New English Dictionary, who record the lead- 
ing facts of our language as these are evident in the 
best poets and prose writers. Nature was not too 
strong for the conservative Horace; nor for Words- 
worth, who remarked that a poet would be likely to

know more than the average reader concerning the 
history of words. The arbiter of good usage must 
study the history of the language, so as to discover 
what is the newest of the old and the oldest of the 
new—for that is the right custom of speech. 
Not only so, but he must study the languages 
from which descending streams have contributed to 
the powerful current of good English, that main 
current which runs unsullied through the troubled 
waters of bad usage; for there have always been 
poets enough to serve as a clear channel. He must, 
above all, study Old English and Latin, and Chaucer, 
that well of English undefiléd, and the main poets, 
Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, and Wordsworth, who 
have drawn water from that well. 
Our language, called English (not ‘ Anglo-Saxon’) 
by the Germanic tribes, the Angles, Jutes, and 
Saxons, who brought it to England, originally con- 
sisted of three main dialects. These were severally 
domesticated in the north-eastern, south-eastern, and 
south-central parts of England bordering on the 
North Sea and the English Channel. Those tribes 
had not been quite untouched by Christianity and 
Roman commerce in their Continental home on the 
Danish peninsula and in adjacent districts washed 
by the German Ocean. But on that casual contact 
‘we need not dwell. Yet we may recall that they 
brought with them from the Continent to England 
a set of letters, the Runic alphabet, which the entire 
body of Germanic tribes had long since derived from 
Greece and Rome. On the whole, however, they were
-P-A-G-E-69
  
THE ROMAN MISSIONARIES 59 
essentially unlettered, and essentially pagan, when 
they began to harry the island of Britain about the 
middle of the fifth century. When they had been 
settling there for perhaps one hundred and fifty 
years, and were established in the land, there came 
among them a band of Christian missionaries, gathered 
from various Mediterranean countries, and sent from 
Rome. The first of these missionaries was August- 
ine, with a good Latin name; and the most impor- 
tant of those who immediately followed him were 
‘Mellitus, Justus, Paulinus, and Rufinianus. They 
were sent by Pope Gregory, who, according to Bede, 
‘was by nation a Roman, . . . deducing his race from 
ancestors that were not only noble, but. religious.’ 
Of the early missionaries, all, of course, knew Latin, 
and some knew Greek. Their first task was to learn 
English, and to write it in the Latin alphabet; their 
second, to adapt the resources of English to the ex- 
pression of ideas brought from the Mediterranean. 
Within seventy years they had done the fundamental 
work for the transformation of the English race 
from unlettered pagans into civilized Christians. 
Without the missionaries and their converts there 
would have been no English literature, for there 
would have been no records, no study, no safe tradi- 
tion, no development of style. Without the mis- 
sionaries and their Latin training we should have 
had no standard of good usage in English. Without 
them we now should have no such language as 
modern English, and possibly no homogeneous speech 
whatsoever, but a set of relatively crude dialects.  
-P-A-G-E-70
  60 GOOD USAGE 
But for the missionaries and their Latin, the thought 
of Greece, the ideals of Palestine, might never have 
entered into English civilization. Pope Gregory was 
right when he said: 
‘Behold, a tongue of Britain, which only knew 
how to utter barbarous language, has long since 
begun to resound the Hebrew Alleluia. Behold, the 
once swelling ocean now serves prostrate at the feet 
of the saints; and its barbarous motions, which earthly 
princes could not subdue with the sword, are now, 
through the fear of God, bound by the mouths of 
priests with words only; and he that when an in- 
fidel stood not in awe of fighting troops, now, a be- 
liever, fears the tongues of the humble.’+ 
The history of good usage, then, goes back to the 
Mediterranean; and good usage as a whole repre- 
sents the progress of civilization from Homer and 
the Old Testament down to the present day. On the 
classical side it represents the cumulative effort of 
the Greek poets and scholars, resulting in Attic 
Greek, and the effort of Roman poets and scholars, 
the inheritors of Greek culture, culminating in Cicero 
and Virgil. The line continues, then, let us say, 
through the Church Fathers and the Latin gramma- 
rians to Saint Jerome, a pupil of the grammarian Do- 
natus, schooled in all the classical learning of his time, 
yet with the fervor of a Hebrew prophet, and the 
first translator of the Bible whom we know by name. 
The missionaries took to England a knowledge of

JEROME AND THE VULGATE BIBLE 61 
the classical Latin authors, and some knowledge of 
Greek. They doubtless very early imported the 
grammar of Donatus, together with Priscian. But, 
with the actual volumes of the Latin authors, they 
brought to England the most influential book for 
post-classical European civilization that ever was 
produced, Jerome’s translation of the Bible into 
Latin. Out of this, through a series of adaptations 
and partial translations into Old and Middle Eng- 
lish, there subsequently arose the most influential of 
all books upon modern English culture, the Author- 
ized Version of the Bible, the Bible of King James. 
In the Vulgate of Jerome—for example, in the 
Book of Lamentations—the cadences of Ciceronian 
and Attic eloquence unite with the substance of 
Christian and Hebraic thought, and, on the whole, 
classic usage bends only in so far as is necessary to 
express conceptions that had not been familiar to 
ancient Rome. Let a single instance suffice. The 
Romans, like the English in their pagan state, virtu- 
ally never attained to the conception of monotheism. 
When they prayed, they addressed the immortal gods 
in the vocative plural; or they addressed some indi- 
vidual deity, as Hercules or Jupiter, using the voca- 
tive singular of his particular name. Because they 
worshiped gods many, they had no vocative singu- 
lar from the nominative deus. Accordingly, when 
Jerome came to translate the opening of the Fifty- 
first Psalm, ‘Have mercy upon me. O God!’ there 
was no classical usage that he could follow; he was 
forced to make use of the nominative singular as a
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 GOOD USAGE 
vocative: ‘Miserere mei, Deus.’ The entire history 
of civilization here converges on a point in usage. 
For the new conception the translator did not invent 
a new word, nor did he devise a new form by 
analogy. We find him as conservative as circum- 
stances permitted him to be; he makes a word and 
a form already in existence answer his purpose. His 
‘Deus’ is the first instance in Latin of an appeal to 
the one Divine Being in the vocative singular. 
The Vulgate, then, was the principal gift of Latin 
scholarship to the English race—to the Angles, Jutes, 
and Saxons, with Frisians and others intermixed. 
As the race became politically more unified, and 
also more thoroughly permeated by Christian civili- 
zation, the centre of government and of intellectual 
life moved, in the course of events, from the north- 
east to the south-west, and the three strains of the 
native language tended to unite in the south-mid- 
land district, while the influence of classical and ec- 
clesiastical Latin remained constant throughout. 
Eventually the south-midland dialect, with admix- 
tures from the other two, became the English lan- 
guage proper, taking shape as a fairly homogeneous 
unit in what has become the great centre of Eng- 
lish population and culture, notable for London and 
the two main seats of classical learning, Oxford and 
Cambridge. In this south-central district at the close 
of the Middle Ages we find the two scholars and 
great writers, Chaucer and Wyclif (both of them 
students of Latin), who, more than any others, gave 
form to that English tongue which has spread to the
-P-A-G-E-73
THE HISTORY OF GOOD USAGE 63 
ends of the earth. Though the process of develop- 
ment in earlier stages was gradual, leading up to 
the fourteenth century, we may definitely take this 
century of Chaucer, Langland, the unidentified 
author of the Pearl, and the beginnings of the Eng- 
lish drama, as the critical age for the supremacy of 
the midland dialect, and the formation of modern 
English. To the poetry of Chaucer and the Wyclif 
translation of the Bible we usually give the credit 
for fixing the language; but the age as a whole was 
one of extraordinary originating power—in this re- 
spect incomparable in English history—and full of 
literary activity. Witness the genius of Richard 
Rolle, and the high degree of talent in Gower, both 
of whom wrote with equal ease in Latin and English. 
It was also the most important epoch for the assimila- 
tion in our language of words of Latin origin. 
The language which then became unified, and 
dominant in England, was later moulded and made 
flexible on the Elizabethan and Jacobean stage, in 
the time of Shakespeare and of the Authorized Ver- 
sion of the Bible, while the colonial expansion of 
Great Britain was beginning over-seas. ‘The works 
of the old English dramatists,’ said Wordsworth, 
‘are the gardens of our language.’ Of the bond be- 
tween the Authorized Version and earlier English 
translations of the Scriptures, and between these and 
the Vulgate, I have already spoken. On the influ- 
ence, deep and wide, of the Authorized Version upon 
English usage it is needless to dwell. A well-known 
authority says: ‘The elevation and nobility of Bibli- 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 GOOD USAGE 
eal diction, assisted by its slightly archaic tinge, 
have a tendency to keep all English style above mean- 
ness and triviality.’ In the words of Coleridge, ‘in- 
tense study of the Bible will keep any writer from 
being vulgar in point of style.’ But we must note 
that this age of Elizabeth and James, again, was one 
in which strictly classical studies had a very large 
share in providing standards of good usage. The 
eloquence of Bacon, for example, comes partly from 
the Latin Bible, partly from Tacitus, partly from 
Cicero. 
The language handed down by the Elizabethan 
eourt and drama, and by the preachers of the Re- 
formation, that spoken language which is the basis 
of the written, virtually took final shape in the drama 
of the Restoration; and the spelling, too, was practi- 
eally fixed in the same period of Charles the Second ; 
while Latin continued to be the groundwork of a 
literary education. Addison, the eighteenth century 
in general, only refined our prose in small, though 
not insignificant details. At the end of the century 
it was at length possible to make an authoritative 
dictionary of modern English, that of Samuel John- 
son, an accomplished Latinist. 
Since then, the language has not, indeed, remained 
stationary ; there has been an increase in the number 
of words to be found in a dictionary—but mostly of 
technical words derived from Greek and Latin. There 
has been some increase, too, in the flexibility of speech 
and writing. Still, the last considerable reaction in 
the history of the language took the shape of a re-
-P-A-G-E-75
WORDSWORTH AND THE BIBLE 65 
turn to earlier standards. The movement is rightly 
associated with the effort of Wordsworth to imitate 
the diction of ‘real men,’ and to purge away the 
insineerities that had crept into English verse through 
the influence of Pope. Wordsworth himself gave 
some color to the notion that he was experimenting 
with the language actually used in his own time by 
humble and rustic persons. His ‘real men,’ how- 
ever, knew the English Bible and Liturgy by heart; 
he eliminated the crudities of rural speech by a stand- 
ard derived from his studies in the history of words; 
and when his usage at any point was called in ques- 
tion, he defended himself by an appeal to the usage 
of the earlier poets. With respect to diction he 
mainly succeeded in bringing back the simplicity 
and directness of Biblical English to poetical style, 
and in restoring to favor many words and phrases 
of permanent value from Chaucer, Spenser, Shake- 
speare, and Milton, and not a few of the minor poets. 
His practice demonstrated that the usage of the com- 
mon people is a kind of material furnished by na- 
ture, which the poet moulds by conscious art into 
a new creation. He also observed that nature is at 
work in the minds of mighty poets. 
The last great fact in the history of good usage 
is the production of the New English Dictionary 
(now almost complete) at Oxford, England, in the 
midland district where the language was formed, 
and at the home of English classical learning. 
Let us go back a little. The eighteenth century 
is especially important for America, since the chief 
 
-P-A-G-E-76

differences that we need to consider between English 
and American usage then arose—not in America so 
much as in England itself. We have to study the 
English usage of that century if we wish to know 
whether our present American usage, when there is 
a difference, is justified. Take, for example, the 
word labor, and other words which the English now 
uniformly spell with the ending -our. Gray (a very 
careful writer) and his age spell them in either way, 
without betraying a preference. But since English 
has taken many of them directly from Latin rather 
than French, since there is ample authority in the 
best writers of the eighteenth century for spelling 
them like the Latin, since this is simpler and more 
natural, and since there is no good reason for spell- 
ing them otherwise than labor, color, humor, ete., 
we are more than justified in adhering to what is 
called the American orthography. Ours really are 
eigtheenth-century English forms; and they are Latin 
forms. Possibly we should make an exception of 
Saviour, but on grounds of the best usage, and not 
arbitrarily. 
Let us take a final illustration: for ever—written 
or printed as two words, and not, as so often is done 
in America, in one. You cannot very well print it 
as one in the most familiar case of all, namely, in 
the Lord’s Prayer; there you must print or write it 
‘for ever and ever.’ So Keats gives it: 
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever. 
In the eighteenth century it has been noted once as 
a single word, in the poet Falconer. Shelley (or 
 
-P-A-G-E-77

his printer), in the nineteenth, gives it sometimes 
as one, sometimes as two. But at present we may 
distinguish the artist in language from the man who 
is not so artistic, by his use of for ever, centre, 
theatre, metre, thus much, so much, some one, any 
one, every one, and the like. 
Taken singly, such matters appear trifling; but 
perfection is made up of minutie—and perfection 
is no trifle. Good usage is a thing of beauty. Cal- 
verley did not think the orthography of for ever a 
trifle, since he wrote nine Horatian stanzas on it: 
Forever

Our rude forefathers deemed it two; 
Can you imagine so absurd

Did not. 
It looks, ah me! how trite and tame; 
It fails to sadden or appal 
Or solace—it is not the same 
At all.

And nevermore must printer do

Nor am I confident they erred; 
Are you? 
The phrase for ever represents the two words in

gate, a Latin book brought into England at the be- 
ginning of the history of our race and our literature. 
Latin has been read and written by men of English 
speech from the Old English period till our own day.

THE LATIN ELEMENT IN ENGLISH 69 
mize the beauty and utility of the native element in 
our language, or to slight any other element such as 
Greek. Rather I would suggest that these elements 
are so interwoven that they must be studied together 
by any one who desires to perpetuate standards of 
good linguistic usage. Yet it is proper to emphasize 
the fact that, in the main, the relation of Latin to 
English has been that of conquering and dominat- 
ing form upon a plastic, vital matter. If Old Eng- 
lish is the mother of our present tongue, a mother 
to be loved and cherished, Latin has been its father, 
a father to be revered and consulted. There are 
other strains in our speech, but the original wedding 
was between Old English and Latin. And there 
has been constant intermarriage between these two 
lines ever since. 
Here is one of the products. For a choice speci- 
men of virile English, I present the following utter- 
ance of Ben Jonson on good usage. He says: 
‘Pure and neat language I love, yet plain and 
customary.’ 
That is the kind of sentence people eall good 
straightforward Anglo-Saxon. Yet here the words 
of native origin are the least significant; of the 
really descriptive words, pure goes back to Latin 
purus, neat to Latin nitidus, plain to Latin planus, 
language to Latin lingua, and customary to Latin 
consuetudinarius. It is impossible to study English 
without a knowledge of Latin. Shakespeare is said to 
have had little of it; but he had more than the classes 
that nowadays read him in this country. It is said 
6

that Lincoln had less than Shakespeare; but he knew 
the Latin terms used in his practice of law, and he 
saw to it that his son was not deprived of a classical 
education. Milton wrote enviable Latin, both prose 
and verse, before he attained to the purest English 
style developed by any of our great poets. And he 
calls barbarism ‘a destructive intestine enemy to 
genius,’ and takes careless speech as the mark of an 
indolent mind ‘already long prepared for any amount 
of servility.’ It is his way of saying that bad usage 
corrupts good manners. In his day the cure was 
the study of Latin, which would still be effective, if 
our schools chose to make it so. In addition, we now 
have the New English Dictionary as the great anti- 
dote to bad language. It records the thrilling voices 
of a noble past, and indicates the course of good 
usage in the future. But one cannot consult it to 
the best advantage without a Latin dictionary at 
one’s elbow. 
Actually, every one believes in good usage. Little 
children are quick to notice and correct any depar- 
ture from what they consider right, namely, the 
speech of their fathers and mothers. They are by 
nature imitative and conservative of what they ad- 
mire. The illiterate, too, believe in the principle of 
good usage. Even the natural impulse of the indi- 
vidual to resent correction when he is wrong dis- 
plays the same conservative tendency; likewise his 
subsequent reaction, after he has looked the point 
up in the dictionary. The normal process is this. 
The teacher corrects the pupil, or the pupil corrects

  A BATTLE FOR GOOD USAGE 71 
the teacher. Some heat arises in the discussion, and 
the battle ends without an admission of defeat on 
either side. When the combatants separate, each 
furtively repairs to an authority he deems better 
than himself—to some one who knows both English 
and Latin. He goes to the work of Webster, or 
Funk and Wagnalls, or Murray. One of the con- 
testants finds himself in the wrong. Thereafter he 
avoids a repetition of the controversy with his pre- 
vious foe, being careful, however, not to mispro- 
nounce the same word again in the same presence. 
But he will be acrimonious from that time on in de- 
nouneing the fault in any one else. In this way his 
self-love recovers from the hurt it has suffered, and 
the stream of the native language tends to rid itself 
of one more impurity.

THE TEACHING OF WRITTEN 
COMPOSITION * 
IKE the ‘cultural value’ of the classics, the teach- 
L ing of English composition is a large subject for 
consideration within narrow limits. Properly ampli- 
fied, the subject would involve some treatment of 
various other topics, among them the gradual decline 
of interest in the disciplines of Greek and Latin, which 
have been essential to the development of English style 
in the past; and the concomitant popular demand for 
a kind of education in the vernacular which shall 
directly liberate the utterance of the masses, rather 
than produce a body of learned men whose paramount 
influence might elevate and sustain the standards of 
taste and good usage. 
My purpose, however, is necessarily restricted. It is 
my hope to direct the attention of teachers of English, 
and particularly those who are concerned with classes 
in written composition, to certain underlying prin- 
ciples that should govern the practice of requiring 
themes or essays from the immature. Fundamental 
principles are seldom free from the danger of neglect.

  THE DAILY THEME 73 
With reference to composition in the vernacular, there 
seems to be a special propriety in reverting to such 
principles, since within recent years a great and ex- 
emplary educational power in the Hast has had to 
rediscover one of them, and has at length concluded 
that the children of America should not be forced to 
make bricks without straw. In the academic year of 
1907-08 at Harvard University, the number of under- 
graduates enrolled in courses primarily devoted to the 
writing of English was considerably larger than the 
number in courses primarily devoted to the study of 
English literature, the proportion being almost three 
to two. Since then, owing, it would seem, to measures 
taken at Harvard by the department of English, this 
disproportion has undergone a change; in the next 
academic year there appears to have been a leaning 
toward courses the first aim of which was the acquisi- 
tion of knowledge, and the development of insight 
rather than expression. There would be no advantage 
in the use of precise statistics; the preceding case, and 
the following, are cited only in order to define a gen- 
eral impression, namely, that in 1909 or thereabouts 
the tide began to drift away from courses in the ‘daily 
theme’ and its like at the place from which many other 
institutions have ultimately borrowed such devices, 
though this drift may not have been immediately per- 
ceptible everywhere else. For the first semester of the 
year 1909-10 at a representative university in the 
Middle West, the number of students in courses mainly 
devoted to English composition, as against those in 
courses mainly devoted to the study of English litera- 
ture, bore a proportion of about ten to seven. I have
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 THE TEACHING OF COMPOSITION 
no desire to draw especial notice to the university in 
question, and have given the instance as presumably 
typical of a good many institutions. 
To one who from the beginning could have watched 
the daily theme advance from its home in New Eng- 
land to a gradual conquest of the South and West— 
while Greek kept sailing ever farther into the north of 
Dame Democracy’s opinion—the spectacle must have 
been attended with some misgivings. In the case of 
many teachers who, after years of experiment, persist 
—to use the words of Milton—in ‘forcing the empty 
wits of children to compose themes, verses, and ora- 
tions, which are the acts of ripest judgment,’ a proc- 
ess which he compares to the wringing of blood from 
the nose, andi ‘the plucking of untimely fruit,’ ? it may 
be that the only words to apply are those from Burns: 
One point must still be greatly dark, 
The moving Why they do it. 
1 Following the delivery of this paper, changes were made by 
certain of my colleagues in the preliminary work in English at 
Cornell University; since then virtually no courses there have 
been given in which the practice of composition has not been in 
some measure connected with the study of a more or less definite 
subject-matter. Following the publication of the article, letters 
eame to me from several quarters evincing a belief that I had 
in mind this or that institution other than the one actually 
alluded to,

wood, p. 6. Throughout the paper I have kept in mind certain

Personal Talk, and Bacon’s Advancement of Learning.

A DISTEMPER OF LEARNING 75 
To do a thing, and to continue in the practice, mainly 
because one hundred or one thousand others are en- 
gaged in the same pursuit, may be reasonable in a 
polity like that of Mr. Kipling’s Bandar-log; it is not 
the sort of motive that should dominate the republic 
of American colleges and universities. Yet one may 
pertinently inquire whether some such external imi- 
tation of one institution by another in this country 
has not been the chief cause in forcing the jaded 
wits of partly-trained instructors in English, some- 
times known as ‘English slaves,’ to correct number- 
less themes, essays, and orations; an occupation which 
allows these young men to do little else during what 
should be a most critical period of their growth, that 
is, during the period when the Docent in a Conti- 
nental university pursues the liberal investigations 
that shall shortly make him, within his field, a master 
of those who know. In a land like ours, which prides 
itself upon the development of efficiency, no harsher 
accusation could be brought against the ‘daily theme’ 
than that it squanders the energy of the teacher. 
{it causes him to spend an immoderate share of his 
time upon a mass of writing that has no intrinsic 
value, and easily leads him into the habit of regard- 
ing the details of outer form, rather than the sub- 
stance of what he reads. ‘Here, therefore,’ as Bacon 
says, ‘is the first distemper of learning, when men 
study words and not matter.’+ Is it not true that, 
if you take care of the teacher of English, his pupil 
will be taken care of? Whatever value may attach

  76 THE TEACHING OF COMPOSITION 
to this notion, daily themes and their like, once 
established in the curriculum, constitute a barrier 
to its acceptance. But let us turn to the pupil. 
What, then, are the laws that should govern the 
kind and amount of writing which we may require 
from our undergraduates? In asking this question, 
we are to have in mind the needs of university or 
college students of the first and second years, but 
the answer is applicable to a much larger circle of 
learners. 
By way of preliminary, one might inquire whether 
it is necessary that the art of written composition 
should be taught at all. The common belief that it 
is necessary may be too readily accepted. The wisest 
of all teachers, though He constantly referred to 
written tradition as a standard, and expected His 
hearers to be familiar with it, is not reported to have 
written more than once—and then in the sand. The 
wisest of the Greeks in the time of Pericles is repre- 
sented by Plato at the end of the Phwdrus as argu- 
ing to the uttermost against the art of written com- 
position, except as a means to the preservation of 
records, or as a pastime for the old. Aside from 
his main contention, this argument of the Platonic 
Socrates in favor of the spoken word offers no little 
comfort to the increasing number of those who main- 
tain that our present courses in English composi- 
tion should turn more and more upon the exercise 
of distinct utterance, that clear and well-formed 
speech is more intimately connected than writing 
itself with that precision of thought and feeling
-P-A-G-E-87
  
SEEK INSIGHT FIRST 77 
which is the basis of all good style. Yet it may be 
urged that Plato, the consummate artist in Greek 
prose, is himself an example with which to combat 
the argument against writing that he chooses to put 
into the mouth of a dramatic character. Even so, 
shall we, then, immediately rush away to the con- 
elusion that it is desirable, both for the individual 
and for the State, that all persons, or all the per- 
sons in any group, should obtain an equal opportu- 
nity for self-expression, whether in writing or other- 
wise? 
So far as concerns the individual, it is clear that 
the teacher, whether of English or any other subject, 
should prefer to make his pupil well-informed and 
happy, rather than enable him to advertise his wis- 
dom and contentment. Even in a democracy it may 
now and then be true that silence is golden, and 
‘long, barren silence’ better than ‘personal talk.’ 
As for the State, it is obvious that the commonwealth 
is benefited when the few who have a comprehension 
of its needs receive a hearing, and the many possess 
their souls in quiet. Nevertheless, among the plati- 
tudes that have escaped challenge is the current no- 
tion that every one should be taught to express him- 
self when on his feet, since there is no telling how 
often, in the way of civic duty, the average man 
may need to address an audience. One may venture 
to think that an inordinate amount of precious time 
has been lavished in windy debate upon generalities 
by students who have never made a speech, or needed 
to make one, after turning their backs upon the aca- 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  78 THE TEACHING OF COMPOSITION 
demic rostrum; and the fact remains that the aver- 
age man, either in civic or in private relations, 
always needs to know his business before he talks 
about it. A similar observation holds good with 
reference to the inordinate practice of written com- 
position for its own sake. It sounds like a truism 
to say that to acquire, and to meditate upon what is 
acquired, are more necessary than to express the re- 
sult in writing. Yet this essential priority of insight 
over expression is not reflected in the large number 
of undergraduates throughout our country who have 
engaged in the writing of themes with little or no 
restriction of subjects, as compared with the num- 
ber engaged in the systematic study of English 
literature under teachers who have made this field, 
or some part of it, their own. 
It may be objected that the disproportion exists 
only on the surface, and that the student’s whole 
experience, including his activity at the time in 
other branches of the curriculum, should furnish 
him with material about which he can tell the truth 
in writing. But the experience of the Freshman or 
Sophomore is easily exhausted; he reads, and has 
read as a schoolboy, very few solid books for him- 
self; and, in the other subjects which he may be 
studying, his teachers are better fitted to gauge the 
propriety of his statements than is the teacher of 
English. In any case, we can hardly avoid the ad- 
mission that everywhere, and at all times, the truth 
is of more importance than any language by which 
it may happen to be represented.
-P-A-G-E-89
   THE END AND THE MEANS 79 
May we not put the argument into a form like 
this? The main function of the vernacular, Tal- 
leyrand to the contrary notwithstanding, is the com- 
munication of truth. In a given case the importance 
of the function is measured by the importance of 
the truth to be conveyed. Since we may seldom take 
it for granted that the unripe student is in posses- 
sion of a valuable truth, and since the first inquiry 
of the teacher should, therefore, be concerned with 
the truth and accuracy of the pupil’s communica- 
tion, it follows that the teaching of self-expression 
can never safely be made the immediate aim of any 
course. If a sense of values is, in the nature of 
things, primary, it will remain so in spite of a 
thousand courses that may be built upon some other 
hypothesis. If expression is a medium for impart- 
ing one’s sense of values, if it is essentially a means 
to an end, we fall into the gravest possible error 
when we treat it as an end in itself. 
Our main question, therefore, resolves itself pre- 
cisely into this one of means and end; and hence we 
must lay the emphasis where it belongs, and no 
longer ask, ‘Can we teach such and such persons the 
art of composition?’ Instead, we are bound to ask, 
‘Can we use the practice of written composition as 
a means of imparting insight?’ Obviously we can 
use it as a test for determining whether the pupil 
has gained an appreciation of any particular sub- 
ject, and by successive tests can determine whether 
he continues to advance in his appreciation. We 
may perhaps use it with some frequency in order
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 THE TEACHING OF COMPOSITION 
to note the increasing faithfulness of his observation 
within a definite province; more rarely in order to 
measure his ability to compare his observations and 
to draw inferences from them. Employed by a 
teacher who has such ends in view, the writing of 
English becomes an instrument of value for pro- 
moting a general education, which may be taken to 
mean a study of particular subjects in the order 
of their importance and in a rational sequence. Em- 
ployed for less serious, or mistaken, ends, written 
composition may be regarded as a pastime for the 
young, or as an injurious waste of time. 
From these considerations we may pass to a few 
others, some of them implicit in the foregoing. 
The insight which it is the function of the teacher 
of English to impart is an insight, not into current 
theories of geology, or economics, or agriculture, or, 
in short, into much of the heterogeneous material 
that, in the shape of select readings, often serves as 
a basis for studying the formal structure of exposi- 
tion and description; it is an insight into the best 
traditions of English literature and such other litera- 
tures as are directly involved in an understanding 
of the English. This, presumably, is the material 
into which the vision of the teacher himself has most 
deeply penetrated. If not, he ought to be teaching 
something else, or nothing. Let the teacher of 
writers, as well as the writer, observe the caution 
of Horace, and choose with care his proper field. 
Some portion or phase of this subject which he knows 
and loves is the matter about which he may ask his
-P-A-G-E-91
THE PANGS OF AUTHORSHIP 81 
pupils to write; and not in helter-skelter fashion, 
as if it made no difference where one began, what 
one studied next, and so on, save as a question of 
arbitrary order; but progressively, on the supposi- 
tion that in the advance toward knowledge and 
understanding, certain things, not schematic, but 
substantial, necessarily precede others. 
Further, the amount of writing demanded of the 
immature student should be relatively small. In 
the space of a term, how many teachers of English 
composition produce as much manuscript of an aca- 
demic character as they expect from individuals of 
the Freshman or Sophomore class? If our courses in 
daily themes are to any extent derived from the edu- 
cational theories of antiquity, we may imagine that 
by one channel or another they eventually go back 
to Quintilian. But what is their real connection 
with the familiar advice of Quintilian, so vigorously 
rendered by Ben Jonson, ‘No matter how slow the 
style be at first, so it be labored and accurate’; or 
with this, ‘So that the sum of all is, ready writing 
makes not good writing, but good writing brings on 
ready writing’? Or what relation have they to the 
Horatian counsel, not merely to fill the mind from 
the page Socratic before one begins writing, but, 
after one has written, to correct, even to a tenth re- 
view? And the page Socratic itself in one case is 
reported to have been seven times rewritten. Ac- 
cordingly, from Plato, who remodeled the opening of 
the Republic these seven times, to Bacon, who revised 
the Instauratio Magna at least twelve times, and Man-

zoni, who would often recast a sentence a score of 
times, and then perhaps not print a word of it, and 
John Richard Green, who rewrote the first chapter of 
The Making of England ten times, there is a host of 
witnesses! crying out against the facile penmanship 
of five ‘themes’ a week on five different subjects—ap- 
proximately one hundred and seventy-five papers in 
an academic year, from the empty wits of Sopho- 
mores! To this number must be added six or eight 
‘long themes.’ Could any course of reading be de- 
signed which at the end of the year preceding should 
make of the Freshman a full man to the extent that 
such an exercise as this in the Sophomore year de- 
mands? 
In fact, the more one compares the current prac- 
tice of theme-writing with traditional theory and 
the actual experience of good writers in the past,

EXPRESSION A PART OF CHARACTER 83 
the less this practice seems to harmonize with either. 
Nor does it meet with the approval of representa- 
tive literary men in the present. Speaking at Ox- 
ford University not many years ago, Mr. Frederic 
Harrison delivered himself as follows: 
‘I look with sorrow on the habit which has grown 
up in the university since my day (in the far-off 
fifties) the habit of making a considerable part of 
the education of the place to turn on the art of serv- 
ing up gobbets of prepared information in essays 
more or less smooth and correct—more or less suc- 
cessful imitations of the viands that are cooked for 
us daily in the press. I have heard that a student 
has been asked to write as many as seven essays in 
a week, a task which would exhaust the fertility of 
a Swift. The bare art of writing readable para- 
graphs in passable English is easy enough to master ; 
one that steady practice and good coaching can teach 
the average man. But it is a poor art, which readily 
lends itself to harm. It leads the shallow ones to 
suppose themselves to be deep, the raw ones to fancy 
they are cultured, and it burdens the world with a 
deluge of facile commonplace. It is the business of 
a university to train the mind to think, and to im- 
part solid knowledge, not to turn out nimble penmen 
who may earn a living as the clerks and salesmen of 
literature.’ + 
And to much the same effect Lord Morley: 
‘I will even venture, with all respect to those who 
are teachers of literature, to doubt the excellence 
and utility of the practice of over-much essay-writ- 
ing and composition. I have very little faith in

erary Estimates, pp. 153-4; see Cooper, Theories of Style, p.

-P-A-G-E-94
  84 THE TEACHING OF COMPOSITION 
rules of style, though I have an unbounded faith 
in the virtue of cultivating direct and precise ex- 
pression. But you must carry on the operation in- 
side the mind, and not merely by practising literary 
deportment on paper. It is not everybody who can 
command the mighty rhythm of the greatest masters 
of human speech. But every one can make reason- 
ably sure that he knows what he means, and whether 
he has found the right word. These are internal 
operations, and are not forwarded by writing for 
writing’s sake. Everybody must be urgent for at- 
tention to expression, if that attention be exercised in 
the right way. It has been said a million times that 
the foundation of right expression in speech or writ- 
ing is sincerity. That is as true now as it has ever 
been. Right expression is a part of character. As 
somebody has said, by learning to speak with preci- 
sion, you learn to think with correctness; and the 
way to firm and vigorous speech lies through the 
‘ eultivation of high and noble sentiments. So far as 
my observation has gone, men will do better if they 
seek precision by studying carefully and with an 
open mind and a vigilant eye the great models of 
writing, than by excessive practice of writing on 
their own account.’ 
Could one wish for a better defense than Lord 
Morley here supplies of the notion that the ecultiva- 
tion of the vernacular must go hand in hand with 
a systematic study of literature, and of models never 
short of the best? 
Now it would be idle to suggest that the war 
which has been waged against the illiteracy of our 
Freshmen and Sophomores, and which has centred 
in the ‘daily theme,’ has been totally without avail;

MILTON ON TRUE ELOQUENCE 85 
though every teacher must recall instances where a 
compulsory exercise in fluent writing has chiefly 
served to encourage shallowpates in shallow think- 
ing and heedless expression. But where the struggle 
has availed, this has resulted from the more or less 
random observance of the principle which has been 
enunciated, namely, the priority of insight. Still, 
the observance has been random; for even where the 
teacher of composition at the outset announces his 
belief that the disease which shows itself in bad 
writing is bad thinking, he nevertheless is prone to 
spend the term, or the year, in battling against the 
symptoms. He lacks the courage of his convictions, 
and needs to restore his spirit with the passage in 
which Milton says: 
‘For me, readers, although I cannot say that I am 
utterly untrained in those rules which best rhetori- 
cians have given, or unacquainted with those ex- 
amples which the prime authors of eloquence have 
written in any learned tongue; yet true eloquence 
I find to be none but the serious and hearty love of 
truth; and that whose mind soever is fully possessed 
with a fervent desire to know good things, and with 
the dearest charity to infuse the knowledge of them 
into others, when such a man would speak, his words 
(by what I can express), like so many nimble and 
airy servitors, trip about him at command, and in 
well-ordered files, as he would wish, fall aptly into 
their own places.’ + 
The whole question does, indeed, finally reduce 
itself to one of pedagogical faith, to a belief that

  86 THE TEACHING OF COMPOSITION 
the ideal will work—that it is the only thing that 
will work effectively. If we never ask the student 
to write for us save on the basis of something which 
we ourselves may properly be supposed to know; if 
the material is one concerning which his knowledge 
is made to grow throughout a considerable length of 
time; if we expect of every essay, paragraph, sen- 
tence, phrase, and word which he writes that it shall 
tell the exact, if not the whole, truth; if the subject- 
matter of his study be itself the truest and most in- 
spiring that we can employ to fire his imagination 
and clarify his vision; if we observe all these condi- 
tions, will he altogether fail in acquiring the out- 
ward badge of education which is popularly de- 
manded of the college graduate? Will he fail to 
express himself better as his personality becomes 
better worth expressing? If, for example, we took 
our cue from the Greeks,? and restricted our train- 
ing in the vernacular to the patient absorption of 
one or two supreme masterpieces, would not our 
students escape what Ruskin says such a practice 
enabled him to escape, ‘even in the foolishest times 
of youth,’ the writing of ‘entirely superficial or 
formal English’ ?? Rather, would they not thus 
appropriate a matter wherein, on occasion, they 
might with justice become right voluble? No

  THE IDEAL IS PRACTICAL 87 
teacher can deny it unless he is ready to pretend that 
insight and expression are separable, or that insight 
is subordinate. Yet the belief that they are insepa- 
rable is not merely the verdict of present-day com- 
mon sense; it has received frequent vindication in the 
history of culture, as, for example, from the very 
practical man to whom, more than to any other 
single person in the annals of Europe, the continued 
existence of modern culture is owing, that is, to 
Charlemagne. In a plea for the study of letters, 
lest the knowledge of the art of writing vanish away, 
and with it all ability to interpret the Scriptures, he 
says to the abbots and bishops in the year 787: 
‘While errors of speech are harmful, we all know 
that errors of thought are more harmful still. There- 
fore we exhort you, not merely not to neglect the 
study of letters, but to pursue it with diligence.’

THE CORRECTION OF PAPERS '* 
HAT does “the correction of papers’ actually 
mean? Briefly, it means the correction, or 
straightening, or normalization, of one personality by 
another, through the instrumentality of truth ex- 
pressed in language. At least two personalities are 
concerned; and between A, the teacher, and B, the 
taught, lies the medium of the vernacular or some other 
tongue, representing a third element that needs consid- 
eration. A and B have each their rights as well as 
their duties, which require careful adjustment. They 
have also their relations to some larger group, of 
which they are individual members; since their stud- 
ies affect the welfare of the national language, there 
are mutual obligations existing between them and 
C, the State; for it will hardly be denied that edu- 
cation is the chief affair of state, since it determines 
the future of the nation, or that an ability to think

justly, and to tell the truth, is the principal end of 
education. 
In taking up the rights and duties of both teacher 
and pupil with reference to the national language, I 
shall advocate no hard and fast procedure for any 
course or class. We have had perhaps too much pre- 
scription of rules in the teaching of English, and too 
little discussion of first principles which the teacher 
may assimilate, and, when they have become a regu- 
lative force in his life, may instinctively apply in the 
varying circumstances of his profession. My aim is 
simply to encourage others in thinking about the 
fundamental obligations already mentioned, and to 
suggest an ideal balance among them—something not 
in all respects within easy grasp, it may be, and yet, 
on the whole, not so far beyond our reach that we can- 
not profitably strive to attain it. In order to suggest 
this ideal, it may be necessary to lay stress on certain 
elements in the problem of teaching English which are 
often overlooked—the rights of the State, for instance, 
in respect to the purity of the national language; and 
it may be useless to dwell at length upon those elements 
which commonly receive undue attention—as, for ex- 
ample, the claims of the mediocre to an education that 
is quite superficial. 
Let us begin with the medium of utterance. First 
of all, it behoves us to remember that language, in its 
essence, is something spoken, and that speech lies closer 
to the personality we wish to correct than does writing. 
And hence the need: of having the student read many 
of his exercises aloud in class, so that he may acquire
-P-A-G-E-100
  90 THE CORRECTION OF PAPERS 
the habit of uttering premeditated truth, may receive 
correction by word of mouth, and may reform a num- 
ber of his thoughts and phrases with the help of ear 
and tongue, as well as with the eye. 
Now we cannot disjoin language from the substance 
of which it is the expression. This substance, again, 
proceeds from the mind of the writer or speaker, but, 
before that, it has entered into his mind from sources 
without. In a sense, then, the correction of a theme or 
essay should begin with the sources of information—as 
it must end with the details of usage; for the first 
demand we make of language, whether spoken or writ- 
ten, is that it represent some portion of truth that 
deserves communication. May we assume that the 
student in his last year at school, or in his first year at 
college, will be ready with something worthy of utter- 
ance, if he is left to his own devices, or to chance, in 
his selection of subjects?) We cannot assume it. We 
must make sure in advance that his mind hag been 
filled, and we must know with what it has been filled ; 
we must see to it that he has materials of thought, and 
that the materials are well in excess of all drafts we 
are likely to make upon them when we ask for written 
compositions. Emptiness of mind is a serious flaw in 
the writer of a theme, and demands correction. We 
must see to all this because the first and sharpest of 
censures must be uttered when the student (or any one 
else) undertakes to write upon a subject of which he 
knows nothing. In the study of the vernacular, so 
close is this to the soul of the learner, it is perilous to 
dally with the truth. We dare not let our pupils infer
-P-A-G-E-101
   PROGRESS IN THINKING 91 
from our treatment of their compositions that the 
truth can ever be a secondary matter, or that substance 
is of less account than the way one manipulates it. 
The truth of the individual thoughts is the first 
consideration. Next in importance comes their 
order. Here is a topic which our present generation 
is not likely to forget, much attention being paid to 
‘sequence’ in our manuals of composition. Yet there 
is something more to be said about it. Not only must 
we expect a reasonable sequence in the matter which a 
student on a given day exhibits in his theme; but there 
is an order, by no means superficial or negligible, 
which the unwitting pupil cannot be expected to fur- 
nish in his work, but which nevertheless must be forth- 
coming, namely, a substantial order in the tasks that 
are assigned from week to week and from month to 
month in a course of systematic study. An essential 
progress in the thinking of the pupil must be assured. 
How can this be brought about? The following is one 
suggestion. Let the teacher of English restrict the 
subject-matter of his courses to the field he is sup- 
posed to know. Within this field let him select a body 
of material that is interesting to him, as well as im- 
portant in itself, and at the same time is not beyond 
the capacity of his class. In preparing to teach with 
this chosen material, let him meditate long upon the 
point where he must begin if he is to attain his object, 
and yet longer upon this object, that is, upom the pre- 
cise end he desires to reach with his group of learness 
by the close of the year. Let the writing of his stu- 
dents deal with successive parts of that material, and
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 THE CORRECTION OF PAPERS 
let the correction of papers, like any other educational 
device, be at all times subservient to the end he has in 
view, namely, to convert unfed, unorganized, unsensi- 
tive minds into minds that are well-nourished, orderly, 
and sensitive. Otherwise he may continue an unceas- 
ing strife with the external signs of illiteracy, and 
never touch the inner seat of weakness and disease. 
But we are verging on the duties of the teacher. 
What, in general, may we require of the personality 
that is engaged in correcting others through the 
medium of the vernacular? Tirst, the teacher must 
have the right sort of personality ; this affords the sole 
guaranty that he will have sought out and received the 
right sort of training before he enters upon his profes- 
sion. It is almost indispensable that he come from a 
family and home where good books are read and a good 
custom is observed in speaking. It is absolutely indis- 
pensable that from early youth he shall have been a 
reader of the best things. He must be so familiar with 
the masterpieces of literature that he has a standard of 
good sense and good English within him. He must be 
_a well of English undefiled. Late-learners may have 
their use in the teaching of other subjects; they will 
not do for English. Mere conscious rules, acquired 
after one has reached maturity, will never take the 
place of a correct habit formed during childhood and 
adolescence ; they cannot rectify a vicious tendency in 
one’s mode of utterance, they cannot change one’s 
mental disposition.
-P-A-G-E-103
  
PREPARATION OF THE TEACHER 93 
Yet the only proper complement of natural aptitude 
and correct habit is adequate professional training. As 
Horace says: 
To me nor art without rich gifts of mind, 
Nor yet mere genius rude and unrefined, 
Seems equal to the task. They each require 
The aid of each, and must as friends conspire.? 
Our guardians of usage must have some such education 
as the poets and orators who have enriched, refined, 
and established the English tongue. Upon this great 
topic I have touched elsewhere.? Suffice it to say that 
a candidate for the teaching of English in the prepar- 
atory school should have a thorough grounding in 
Latin (if possible also in Greek), a substantial knowl- 
edge of all the ancient literary masterpieces—of the 
Latin ones mainly at first hand, and of the Greek at 
least through translations. In addition to the degree 
of Bachelor of Arts, he should have a year of special 
work in the theory of poetry, reaching back from the 
treatises of Shelley and Sidney to the Poetics of Aris- 
totle, and accompanying the study of principles by 
judicious reading in the chief English poets; in Old 
and Middle English, so that he may see the earlier as 
well as the later literature in due perspective, and may 
be able to consult a historical dictionary of the lan- 
guage with intelligence; and in the development of 
prose, beginning at least with Cicero and Quintilian, 
and coming down to the English Bible and to Burke 
1 Ars Poetica 409-11, in the translation by Howes. 
2 See pp. 314.
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 THE CORRECTION OF PAPERS 
and Newman. Quintilian, at all events, should not be 
omitted, as the very best advice on the practice of com- 
position and the correction of errors is to be found in 
him. The prospective teacher of English in the college 
or university should have something more. He should 
have the literary insight and human sympathy that 
come from a full three years of special preparation 
under expert guidance; he should have the doctoral 
degree, and the degree should mean what it is supposed 
to mean. 
In any case, the corrector of personalities has a 
right, nay, a duty—his natural right, and his essen- 
tial duty—to live, and to live abundantly. Nothing 
could be worse than a teacher of English who is half- 
dead or half-alive, from whatever cause. A half- 
trained instructor may be deemed to be only half-alive. 
But suppose he has the natural endowment and the 
acquired training that the teacher needs; one requisite 
to the continuance of his life is leisure for study. Not 
only that, but he must have the strength and the in- 
spiration as well, and also the outward incentive. In 
reinforcing what has just been said, let us mention a 
few things a university instructor ought not to be or 
to do. He ought not to be untrained in any branch 
that is requisite to an understanding of the English 
language and literature. He ought not to be the sort 
of person who affects to despise scholarship. (Shake- 
speare respected it, Chaucer and Milton possessed it, 
George Eliot obviously developed her literary powers 
through it.) He ought not to be lacking in ambition, 
or on any score unworthy or hopeless of advancement
-P-A-G-E-105
RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PUPIL 95 
in his profession. Furthermore, he ought not to be 
overburdened, stultified, or disheartened with the read- 
ing of huge piles of uninspiring manuscript. There 
must not be an overplus of uninteresting sentences 
and paragraphs in the sum-total of what he reads, but 
the reverse: he must have more hours for Chaucer, 
Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton than for Freshman 
themes; otherwise he will begin to die—to die at the 
top, so to speak. It is his right and duty to be a vital 
influence in the lives he is supposed: to be shaping. 
The personalities entrusted to him he may shape for 
better or worse. It is hardly conceivable that he will 
not modify them at all. Yet if there are three possi- 
bilities, only one of them is tolerable. He must not 
leave his timber as it is, he must not warp it more, he 
must straighten it; and this requires ever-renewed 
vitality. 
And what of the timber? What are the rights 
and duties of the personalities that are to be cor- 
rected? We need not consider obligations that 
spontaneously suggest themselves on a superficial 
consideration, such as the right of the pupil to the 
best kind of correction. No teaching could be too 
good for our land of promise, with the civilization 
here to be developed. This is obvious. When we pene- 
trate more deeply, we perceive, first of all, that not 
every one has the same right to an education in the 
vernacular. An idiot, for example, has not the same 
right as a genius, nor in general have those who are 
below the average in capacity or attainments the 
same right as those who are above it. Doubtless
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 THE CORRECTION OF PAPERS 
every one in a sense has a claim to instruction in 
English, but the point is that some have a better 
claim, or a claim to more of it, than others. Who 
are these? Clearly, as has been suggested, they who 
have the greater capacity. It is a law of nature that 
to those who have shall be given. In our teaching 
we may well observe the tendencies of nature, fol- 
lowing her laws, and aiding her in the accomplish- 
ment of her purposes. It is said that ‘Whom the 
Lord loveth He chasteneth.’? An easy application 
of the text may be made to the teaching of English 
composition. 
Moreover, they who show promise have a right 
not to be herded in classes so large as to be unman- 
ageable, where the individual is lost, and where the 
teacher, instead of being lifted up and drawing 
young men after him, must descend to their level, 
and appeal, not to the spirit of a social group, but 
to the sentiment of a mob. Extremes should be 
avoided. Large portions of time should not be 
lavished on the correction of single individuals or 
knots of two or three, unless these persons are ex- 
traordinarily gifted or exceedingly well-trained. 
On the other hand, an hour devoted to a class of ten 
or twelve is likely to produce results more vital and 
lasting than will three hours a week devoted to a 
class of thirty. Accordingly, with a given force of 
instructors, and a given number of hours for Eng- 
lish in the schedule, it is better to divide our forty- 
five or thirty students into sections of fifteen or ten, 
so as to teach them properly when we teach at all.
-P-A-G-E-107
RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PUPIL 97 
It is to be expected that Freshmen and Sophomores 
will study more, and will prepare better composi- 
tions, when they must read their work aloud before 
a dozen of their fellows whom they have come to 
know as individuals, and in the presence of a teacher 
whom they meet in an intimate way, than under any 
other external conditions. 
Another right of the student may be thus stated. 
We must not require him to read books too rapidly, 
or to compose too many themes. Have our teachers 
of English a clear conscience as to their exactions on 
either score? And who shall guard those guardians 
if they lack a conscience? Better a little reading 
carefully done, and a little writing based upon ade- 
quate reading and reflection, than much hasty work 
of any sort. Connected with the right of the stu- 
dent to an opportunity for thought, and to leisure 
for the slow and often painful business of expres- 
sion, is his just and proper claim to some adequate 
form of utterance or publication. It is unfair to 
ask him to write, week after week, and month after 
month, without a single chance to produce his best 
in the hearing of his fellows. In general, when his 
papers are not thus presented, let him take charge 
of them himself, since he is the one who is most in- 
terested in them. It is bad for the teacher to stupefy 
himself with them in private, and the morality of 
throwing them into the waste-basket is doubtful. 
Worse still is an unseen public of one, an assistant, 
not the teacher, who comes into no personal: contact 
with the pupil, and whose humanity touches the
-P-A-G-E-108
98 THE CORRECTION OF PAPERS 
soul of the writer of a theme only through hiero- 
glyphics on its margin. 
Finally, if a youth has a right to any teaching 
whatsoever, he has a right to sympathetic treatment 
from the person who corrects him. The impulse to 
correct, which is natural, and is very strong in some 
teachers, is good only when, like other natural im- 
pulses, it is properly regulated. Doubtless we are 
all acquainted with pedantic men who cannot bridle 
their tongues when another tongue has made a, slip, 
or withhold their censure if another’s pen has gone 
astray. Their excess does not furnish an argument 
against rigorous correction at intervals; but the wise 
and sympathetic teacher is likely to suppress some- 
thing like five out of six impulses to chastise a 
fault, keeping ever in mind the advice of Ben Jon- 
son, who says: 
‘There is a time to be given all things for matur- 
ity, and that even your country husbandman can 
teach, who to a young plant will not put the prun- 
ing-knife, because it seems to fear the iron, as not 
able to admit the scar. No more would I tell a 
green writer all his faults, lest I should make him 
grieve and faint, and at last despair; for nothing 
doth more hurt than to make him so afraid of all 
things as he can endeavor nothing.’ 
As to the duties of the pupil little need be said. 
He must try to tell the truth, and to express it dis- 
tinetly, in speech as well as in writing. He must 
learn to be self-critical, so that he may correct him- 
* Discoveries, ed. by Castelain, pp. 88-9.
-P-A-G-E-109
TRANSLATION AND PARAPHRASE 99 
self. This will be accomplished when he is taught 
to respect the rights of others in the subject he is 
studying or explaining. His teacher has a right to 
the best effort of every individual in the class, and 
should accept no paper containing an obvious mis- 
take. The audience of the pupil has a right to a 
clear and orderly exposition, and to correct usage. 
The word he employs must correspond to the object 
he has in mind, and must mean the same thing to 
others as to him. It must therefore accord with the 
meaning given in the dictionary. I plead for a 
liberal use of the dictionary in the teaching of Eng- 
lish. 
And here I may advert to a second question of 
direct utility. As a rule, our teachers of English 
composition nowadays take little account of the ad- 
vantages to be gained from the exercise of para- 
phrasing; that is, of course, from paraphrasing 
English authors of the first rank. The practice cor- 
responds in a way to the training which former gener- 
ations obtained in working with the ancient classics, 
and which, luckily, a few of our best students still 
secure. For the rest, paraphrasing Burke or New- 
man or Ruskin would not be altogether different in 
effect from translating and otherwise reworking 
Demosthenes or Cicero. In the first place, a worthy 
substance is supplied, meriting the pains that are 
indispensable to an adequate re-expression. Secondly, 
the student takes to the practice by instinct, as any 
one may see from the answers to examination-ques- 
tions upon Burke’s Speech on Conciliation; the 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 THE CORRECTION OF PAPERS 
answers parody the speech. What we need is the di- 
rection of this native impulse to the ends of edu- 
cation, As it is, the student is usually but half- 
conscious of what he is doing, while the examiner 
often finds the imitation either ridiculous or highly 
objectionable. It may illuminate the point to cite 
two examples that will show how two authors, far 
apart in time and genius, and otherwise differing in 
their education, consciously went about the affair of 
teaching themselves to write. The first of the two 
is the young man Sir Philip Sidney, who on Janu- 
ary 15, 1574, wrote to his friend and mentor, Lan- 
guet : 
‘I intend to follow your advice about composition, 
thus: I shall first take one of Cicero’s letters and 
turn it into French; then from French into English, 
and so once more... it shall come round into the 
Latin again. Perhaps, too, I shall improve myself 
in Italian by the same exercise.’ + 
The second is Poor Richard, who, be it remem- 
bered, established an English high school in Phila- 
delphia, and outlined for it a plan of study which 
has by no means lost its significance to-day. Speak- 
ing of his boyhood, Franklin says: 
‘About this time I met with an odd volume of the 
Spectator. It was the third. I had never before 
seen any of them. I bought it, read it over and over, 
and was much delighted with it. I thought the 
writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate 
+The Correspondence of Sir Philip Sidney and Hubert Lan- 
guet, ed. by 8. A, Pears, p. 23.
-P-A-G-E-111
  
THE METHOD OF FRANKLIN 101 
it. With this view I took some of the papers, and, 
making short hints of the sentiment in each sen- 
tence, laid them by a few days, and then, without 
looking at the book, tried to complete the papers 
again by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, 
and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any 
suitable words that should come to hand. Then I 
compared my Spectator with the original, discovered 
some of my faults, and corrected them. But I found 
I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness in recol- 
lecting and using them, which I thought I should 
have acquired before that time if I had gone on 
making verses; since the continual occasion for words 
of the same import, but of different length, to suit the 
measure, or of different sound for the rhyme, would 
have laid me under a constant necessity of search- 
ing for variety, and also have tended to fix that va- 
riety in my mind, and make me master of it. There- 
fore I took some of the tales and turned them into 
verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well for- 
gotten the prose, turned them back again. I also 
sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into con- 
fusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce 
them into the best order, before I began to form the 
full sentences and complete the paper. This was to 
teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts. 
By comparing my work afterwards with the origi- 
nal, I discovered many faults and amended them; 
but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying that, 
in certain particulars of small import, I had been 
lucky enough to improve the method or the language, 
and this encouraged me to think I might possibly 
in time come to be a tolerable English writer, of 
which I was extremely ambitious.’*

102 THE CORRECTION OF PAPERS 
Let us pass to the rights and duties of the State. 
With reference to the vernacular its main duty is 
no secret. The State must provide and encourage 
able and well-trained teachers, according them ample 
means of subsistence, and a degree of honor not far 
below the highest. On this head we may give ear to 
the words of Milton in his letter to Benedetto Buom- 
mattei of Florence: 
‘Whoever in a state knows how to form wisely the 
manners of men, and to rule them at home and in 
war with excellent institutes, him in the first place, 
above others, I should esteem worthy of all honor; 
but next to him the man who strives to establish in 
maxims and rules the method and habit of speaking 
and writing received from a good age of the nation, 
and, as it were, to fortify the same round with a 
kind of wall, any attempt to overleap which ought 
to be prevented by a law only short of that of Romu- 
lus. . . . The one, as I believe, supplies a noble cour- 
age and intrepid counsels against an enemy invading 
the territory. The other takes to himself the task 
of extirpating and defeating, by means of a learned 
detective police of ears, and a light cavalry of good 
authors, that barbarism which makes large inroads 
upon the minds of men, and is a destructive intest- 
ine enemy to genius. Nor is it to be considered of 
small consequence what language, pure or corrupt, 
a people has, or what is their customary degree of 
propriety in speaking it; ... for, let the words of 
a country be in part unhandsome and offensive in 
themselves, in part debased by ‘wear and wrongly 
uttered, and what do they declare but, by no light 
indication, that the inhabitants of that country are 
an indolent, idly-yawning race, with minds already 
long prepared for any amount of servility? On the
-P-A-G-E-113
RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE STATE 103 
other hand, we have never heard that any empire, 
any state, did not flourish moderately at least, as 
long as liking and care for its own language lasted. 
Therefore, Benedetto, if only you proceed to perform 
vigorously this labor of yours for your native state, 
behold clearly, even from this, what a fair and solid 
affection you will necessarily win from your own 
countrymen. All this I say, not because I suppose 
you to be ignorant of any of it, but because I per- 
suade myself that you are much more intent on the 
consideration of what you yourself can do for your 
country than of what your country will, by the best 
right, owe to you.’? 
So much for Milton’s letter to Buommattei, with 
the warning it contains for our own generation, and 
the application we may make of it to the duties of 
the State. Turning now to the question of rights, 
one may argue as follows. The State demands an 
education in the vernacular which shall do the great- 
est good to the greatest number; this does not neces- 
sarily mean conferring an equal benefit upon every 
individual. Under certain circumstances it might 
signify the careful education of a few because of the 
preponderant influence to be exerted upon the lan- 
guage by a relatively small body of persons, such as 
poets, orators, clergymen, editors, and teachers; a 
small body, that is, in comparison with the popula- 
tion as a whole. If we consider, not the present 
generation alone, but future generations also, as con- 
cerned in our present stage of education, we may ad-

mit that thoroughly training a few persons of un- 
usual capacity is of greater advantage to the State 
than a superficial culture of many. Accordingly, 
these reflections on the correction of papers turn 
out to be a plea for cherishing the more talented 
among our students who show promise of becoming 
influential in maintaining the purity of the English 
language, and in rectifying the present debased us- 
age by means of a standard received from a good 
age of the nation. It is, above all, a plea for safe- 
guarding the interests of those who may become 
teachers of English. Such a plea is never untimely; 
it cannot be urged too often. The rights of the 
average student are in no peril, save as they are 
implicated in the rights of neglected potential 
leaders; and the claims of those who are below the 
average—of the Jukes family and the bad scions of 
the Kallikaks—will not in this humanitarian age go 
unnoticed. The poor, and their champions, we have 
always with us.

LITERATURE FOR ENGINEERS* 
HAT sort of literature should an engineer take 
for his private reading? Next, how should he 
read it? Thirdly—a question which must precede the 
other two, and the answer to which will really contain 
an answer to them—why should he read at all? 
To discuss this subject with a considerable body of 
engineers themselves is a pleasure and a privilege. 
Upon. the students, gathered here and there through- 
out our country, which such a body represents, de- 
pends to no slight extent the tone of many of our larger 
institutions of learning. At several universities the 
schools of engineering contain the largest section of the 
student population; and what is more, no other section 
consists so largely of picked men. That American uni- 
versity life as a whole is profoundly influenced by the 
beliefs and aspirations of the engineer may appeal to 
him as a conception in some degree novel. That the 
influence he exerts upon his fellows in other branches 
of study carries with it an obligation on his part will 
not, we may hope, strike him as paradoxical; for on

  106 LITERATURE FOR ENGINEERS 
the ground that he owes something to men in other 
fields, and to his university as well as his special de- 
partment, reposes much that is to be said to him on the 
score of reading. We do not ask him, for example, to 
read good literature because so-called academical stu- 
dents are supposed to read more than he; but we ask 
him to read more because those academical students do 
not read enough. So far as my observation goes, it is 
the simple fact that we have in the better American 
schools of engineering a larger proportion of men who 
really care for good literature, and would read it with- 
out the stimulus of formal instruction, than we find in 
most colleges and departments of liberal arts. At the 
same time one should not forget that the best-read men 
are still to be met where we should expect them, cling- 
ing to what is left of the older classical training. 
In any ease, there is at the moment no call in any 
single institution for the arraignment of deficiencies 
which, if they exist, arise from general conditions in 
technical education throughout the country, and even 
throughout the Western hemisphere. And if we are 
indeed to moralize, let us not, on the other hand, des- 
cant upon any form of self-seeking, cultural or what 
not. Far be it from a teacher of literature, of the most 
social of all the arts, to say to any man, ‘Go to; read 
now this, that, and the other literary masterpiece—read 
Milton, read Shakespeare—simply for your own sake,’ 
for the sake of what is called self-improvement. If 
true culture is essentially and inherently social, if it is 
inherently self-denying, sympathetic, we had better 
realize this inherent and essential nature of the thing 
at the outset.

  INFLUENCE OF THE ENGINEER 107 
Herein, accordingly, we find the immediate answer 
to the question why the engineer, or any other citizen, 
should read only what is good. He will read in order 
that he may be a good, helpful, efficient citizen, per- 
forming, and performing well, not only his special and 
technical, but also his general and humaner, functions 
as a part of the body politic. Now the life of the State, 
like the life of every great fitting-school for the State, 
amounts to something more than meat, or, in the cur- 
rent parlance, bread and butter; and amounts to more 
than the pulsating network of roads and bridges that 
our engineers will help to extend, by means of which 
in coming years the food for a hundred millions of 
Americans will be transported. The higher national 
life will not be wholly independent of food and 
raiment and the newer means of distribution, but it 
must be more than they. It will not be unsubstantial, 
unfounded, but it must be more than body or material. 
In this higher national life each individual has his 
right and share, which he can obtain only by communi- 
cating what is best in him to his fellows. Very briefly, 
then, the first reason why any one of us should busy 
himself with literature—with the best thoughts of the 
best men—is that he may react beneficially upon his 
neighbor. Has not the engineering student a powerful 
impulse, when he finds something good in a book, to 
read it aloud to his room-mate? And the first appli- 
eation of this principle will bring in the obligation we 
have noted, that is, the debt which our altruistic stu- 
dent of engineering, who would like to read Shake- 
speare for himself, owes to his benighted brother, the
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 LITERATURE FOR ENGINEERS 
academic, who puts his trust in formal courses, and 
reads Shakespeare mainly as an imposed task. Courses 
in literature are good after their fashion, very good for 
the man who is free, and knows how to use them. Yet 
it is hardly desirable to ask for the intrusion of non- 
technical courses upon a technical curriculum that 
is already overcrowded with special studies. For 
the present, no greater general blessing could de- 
scend on our professional schools than the adoption 
of some arrangement whereby their students should 
be led to employ the proper amount of time in pri- 
vate non-technical reading—the amount of time each 
day which a well-conditioned mind does so employ. 
Such an arrangement would not materially hurt the 
engineer, and would go far towards clearing the 
intellectual atmosphere of more than one university. 
Let us turn, however, to something more specific. 
The question why we should read or study Shake- 
speare or Milton is closely related to another. What 
is the precise effect of good literature upon the indi- 
vidual who reads or hears it? What sensations, and 
what inner experiences, should you meet with when 
you read aloud the best poem of Tennyson or Kip- 
ling? Very rare is the individual who has even 
tried to define and localize the chilly creepings that 
are felt in the scalp and down the back of the neck, 
and on either side the spine, whenever the particu- 
lar melody is heard which that particular soul likes 
best. Still fewer are they who have paid attention 
to the effects, whether bodily or spiritual, that the 
reading of good poetry produces on the man who 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
THE FUNCTION OF READING 109 
understands it. Yet it is just such relations of cause 
and effect that men of science are supposed to find 
interesting. When you have discovered that one 
thing causes or invariably precedes another, you as- 
sume that you know something about each of them. 
When you observe that the application of heat to 
water generates steam, you have a form of knowl- 
edge that may prove useful. What, then, is gener- 
ated by the proper application of a literary master- 
piece to a human being who is prepared to receive 
it? By way of anticipation, let us reply: some kind 
of power. 
This question concerning the proper effect of liter- 
ature belongs under a still more inclusive problem, 
namely: What is the effect, the proper effect, of the 
liberal arts in general? In other words, when we 
say that literature is the chief of the liberal arts, 
what do we mean? ‘Liberal’? The word looks like 
‘liberty ’—is, in fact, connected with it by deriva- 
tion; and liberty means freedom. What have any 
of the arts to do with that? In what sense is litera- 
ture a free art? In what respect or from what re- 
straints does it enfranchise or emancipate? Not to 
engage ourselves too far with etymologies, we may 
say that the history of the term ‘liberal arts’ allows 
us to explain the effect of the best literature some- 
what as follows. The best literature, and by that is 
meant the best poetry, generates in us a power or 
pleasure that is not servile, a pleasure that only a 
free man can fully enjoy. The man that does not 
enjoy good poetry is not free; and the man that is

AN EXPERIMENT IN READING 111 
periences that are very powerful, though he may 
never before have observed them with accuracy. 
The sense of bodily well-being is paralleled by an 
inner elevation or exaltation of spirit. ‘A few days 
ago,’ said Bouchardon, a French sculptor of the 
eighteenth century—‘A few days ago, an old French 
book that I never heard of fell into my hands. It 
is called the Iliad of Homer. Since I read that book 
men are fifteen feet high to me, and I cannot sleep.’* 
The reader is wide awake, bold for action. The ap- 
prehensions that but an hour since crowded upon 
him have dispersed into nothingness. His sympathy 
with his fellow-men asserts itself, but begins to lose 
itself immediately in anticipated efforts for their 
welfare. Were an opportunity present for such 
effort, were an object of human pity before him, his 
emotion would be instantly transmuted into an un- 
conscious act of charity. His feelings are aroused. 
His intellect likewise is quicker and more effective, 
1§o the anecdote is given by Paul Shorey in his edition (1901, 
p. xviii) of Books 1, 6, 22, 24, of Pope’s translation of the Iliad. 
A slightly different version appears in Joseph Warton’s Essay 
on the Genius and Writings of Pope, 1782, 2. 33-5: ‘ A very in- 
genious French nobleman, the Count de Caylus, has lately 
printed a valuable treatise entitled Tableaus tirés de l’Iliad et 
de l’Odyssée d’Homére. . . . Among the few who borrowed their 
subjects from Homer, he mentions Bouchardon with the honor 
he deserves, and relates the following anecdote: ‘‘ This great 
artist, having lately read Homer in an old and detestable French 
translation, came one day to me, his eyes sparkling with fire, and 
said: Depuis que j’ai lu ce livre, les hommes ont quinze pieds, et 
la nature s’est accrue pour moi.’’—‘‘ Since I have read this 
book, men seem to be fifteen feet high, and all nature is enlarged 
in my sight.’’’ In a footnote Warton refers to Caylus, p. 227.

112 LITERATURE FOR ENGINEERS 
begins grouping details under general heads, formu- 
lates plans, instantaneously perceives the relation of 
means to ends. If the reader is well-taught and wise, 
he will continue no longer in an idle contemplation 
of his own mental states, nor luxuriate in the warmth 
of this bodily and inward enjoyment; he will attack 
one of those daily tasks that a little while ago seemed 
formidable, but now seem moderate and feasible. 
And he will finish it in one-half the time he had ex- 
pected it would consume. If he can convince a friend 
or two that successful, fearless—and we may add, 
reverent—activity is the final product of good poetry, 
properly read, he may regard the experiment as 
brilliantly concluded. 
The specific effects of literature, and of the differ- 
ent forms of literature, no doubt, are various; vary- 
ing as the supple human spirit which literature tries 
to image. Yet on the basis of our experiment let us 
suppose that the most general and characteristic 
effects of the best literature are a sense of bodily 
well-being, and a less tangible, but very real, sense 
of spiritual elevation or exaltation, not wholly differ- 
ent from the feeling produced in us by the best 
music; a sense of freedom from fear, of unhampered 
ability to act, of pleasure in contemplating and per- 
forming our duties toward family and State. How, 
then, shall we know what is good, what will produce 
these effects, otherwise than by this experiment? 
For the experiment itself presupposes some one, a 
teacher or the like, to tell us what is good, in the 
first place. The dilemma after all is not absolutely 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  
SELF-PROTECTION IN READING 113 
baffling. In the nutrition of our minds nature has 
not left us more helpless than in the care of our 
bodies. In general we hasten to the medical man in 
order to hear from the gray chin of wisdom the pre- 
cepts on bodily health that our own common sense 
has already suggested, and to fortify our own wills, 
shameful to say, by invoking the will of a stranger. 
Is the teacher of literature to be asked, then, what an 
engineer ought to read, and what he ought not? 
Has not the engineer’s own common sense told him a 
hundred times what nutriment his better part should 
receive, and what stimulants it should forego? Does 
he not realize perfectly well that he may and ought 
to dine with Shakespeare and Milton, and not with 
the Sunday press? Is it not clear to everybody that 
in the choice of books one may and ought to be select, 
shutting his eye against the bad? And what shall he 
do when he has read a few poems of Milton and Shake- 
speare? Read them again! Reread them until the 
experiment we have described begins to work; for 
it will work, just as surely as the engineer is a 
normal man and they are poems for all time. It 
cannot possibly help working, if only the experi- 
menter will become so familiar with King Lear and 
The Tempest, with Comus and Samson Agonistes, 
that they continually ring in his ears, and rise to his 
lips when he begins to speak. Let him avoid all 
books that he is not sure about. This or that one 
may be very good; but until the judgment of time, 
that is, the accumulated wisdom of many well-trained 
critics, has grappled with it, he must be content to
-P-A-G-E-124
114 LITERATURE FOR ENGINEERS 
set it aside as doubtful. He is a student in a techni- 
eal school, or he is a practising engineer, or he is any 
sort of intelligent professional man you choose. His 
spare moments are few. He is not the type of man 
that likes to make mistakes. He is aware that he 
will not be making a mistake if he reads Homer or 
Dante in the best English translation, or Shake- 
speare, or the English Bible, or Milton. If during 
his leisure hours he will read them and little else for 
the next two or three years, and will eschew all 
popular magazines, he never will make another sad 
mistake about books; if he keeps the practice up, in 
the end he will have what is known as taste. The 
acquisition of taste calls for a certain amount of self- 
denial; taste nowadays almost invariably is acquired 
outside of school, if at all. But we assume that our 
professional student is possessed of initiative and a 
vigorous will. This latter is an instrument that is 
well-nigh indispensable in obtaining anything worth 
while. 
This list of authors unquestionably is brief. One 
ean hardly say it is narrow. It is drawn up in ac- 
cordance with an Old Latin maxim! of literary faith 
—non mulia, sed multum; read, not many things, 
but much. If more extended counsel is desired, and 
a longer list, one may go to Sir John Lubbock and 
Mr. Frederic Harrison, both of whom have written 
with intelligence and enthusiasm on the choice of 
books. Yet we must bear in mind that any selec- 
tion like Sir John Lubbock’s of the ‘hundred best 
1 Originally Greek: od wohdd dAAd Todd.
-P-A-G-E-125
A BRIEF LIST OF AUTHORS 115 
books’ is sure to omit something that the next com- 
piler would include, and may easily contain some- 
thing injurious to the reader who accepts the list un- 
critically. It is much easier to mention five authors, 
a real acquaintance with whom would constitute a 
liberal education, than to mention fifty. Nor would 
it be difficult to recall a number of great historical 
personages who, like Abraham Lincoln, were men of 
few books, but knew a few things well. We hear of 
such cases more frequently than we hear of any who 
try to emulate them. Perhaps the imitation does 
not seem unpractical enough. 
So much on why we read literature, and on what 
to read. We read what gives us power and freedom, 
and we read it because it gives us power and freedom. 
If we cannot solve these questions off-hand for our- 
selves, we have the judgment of the past to guide 
us. Now then, how shall we read? First of all, read 
aloud. Every bit of literature properly so called 
that history has to show is intended, not for the eye 
primarily, but for the ear. Every line of Shake- 
speare, every line of Milton, is meant to be pro- 
nounced, cannot be duly appreciated until it is pro- 
nounced. Often an entire masterpiece remains dark 
and forbidding, merely because the reader has sought 
to interpret it with the eye alone. For example, 
doubtless many a professional man has never felt 
quite ready to take up Paradise Lost; and indeed it 
might be well to begin the reading of Milton with 
Samson Agonistes. Yet no one who is fond of or- 
chestral music can long resist Milton in any shape,
-P-A-G-E-126
    
116 LITERATURE FOR ENGINEERS 
if only he learns how to reproduce the beat and swell 
and cadence of Milton aloud. In my experience as 
teacher I recall among my few and modest triumphs 
the cases of several students who thought themselves 
hopelessly blind to Paradise Lost, when their actual 
infirmity was nothing but an easily cured deafness. 
Unsealing their ears unlocked to them the doors of 
a Paradise with melodies not to be heard elsewhere 
in English verse. 
Very much of what we call prose—Bacon’s essay 
Of Death, for example, and passages in his Advance- 
ment of Learning—is in the truest sense poetry, and 
loses half its significance when followed only with 
the eye. Literary men, that is, men who write with 
imagination, are often ‘ear-minded,’ as we say. In 
the act of composition, they hear what they are about 
to write; whereas other persons are perhaps more 
often ‘eye-minded.’ The ordinary man, sitting at his 
desk, pen in hand, is likely to see his next sentence, 
or a part of it, in his mind’s eye, a moment or two 
before he will record the words on paper. The chief 
hindrance to his appreciation of the best literature 
may be that he never has been accustomed to hear 
the words that he sees. 
But we must not be content with hearing them. 
When we read, we must, if necessary, smell and feel 
and taste them. That is to say, reading means trans- 
lating the visible marks on the printed page into 
terms of all the senses. Hence, if it be asked, ‘How 
shall I read Shakespeare?’ the answer is, ‘Read him
-P-A-G-E-127
  
READ ALOUD AND SLOWLY. 117 
with alert bodily senses.’ When the Ghost in Ham- 
let says, 
But soft; methinks I scent the morning’s air, 
one must try to recall what the ozone at dawn smells 
like, since it is the earliest sign of day. If we do 
translate the diction into terms of the several senses, 
the inner meaning of Shakespeare or Milton will not 
often escape us. 
The process of making monotonous black charac- 
ters on the page vividly stir the latent sense-per- 
ceptions is, however, relatively slow and irksome. 
Few people have ever learned to do it consistently ; 
and henee, it is fair to say, few have ever truly learned 
to read. The moral is, read slowly. Take ample 
time. Pause where the punctuation bids one pause; 
note each and every comma; wait a moment between 
a period and the next capital letter. And pause 
when common sense bids you pause, that is, when 
‘you have not understood. As the line of sentences 
comes filing before the window of your soul, examine 
each individual expression with the animus, and more 
than the animus, you would maintain were you pay- 
ing-teller in a bank; saying to yourself continually, 
‘Do I know this word?’ and, ‘What is this phrase 
worth?’ Toward what they see in print many people, 
otherwise shrewd and sensible, are strangely credu- 
lous; what they find in a book they instinctively think 
must be true. Yet books are not more trustworthy 
than the men who write them; the number of mis- 
guided and misleading books is infinite. Good books 
are rare,

    118 LITERATURE FOR ENGINEERS 
Read aloud; read slowly; read suspiciously. Re- 
read. What a busy man has time to read at all, he 
has time to read more than once. Was it not Emer- 
son who held that he could not afford to own a book 
until it was ten years old—had at least to that ex- 
tent proved its ability to survive? Jealous of his 
time, he let others sift the ashes. And was it not 
Schopenhauer who considered no book worth while 
that was not worth a third perusal? If we read a 
thing but once, that usually is but so much lost time. 
The most industrious student forgets a large part 
of what he tries to retain. The best-read man is the 
one who has oftenest read the best things; who goes 
through Homer, Plato, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, 
and the Bible, once a year. A veteran teacher of 
English, who had a long and effective career in one of 
our eastern colleges, was approached by a student 
on some minor point in Hamlet. ‘Don’t search me 
too deeply,’ begged the teacher; ‘I haven’t looked 
at Hamlet in six months.’ When, therefore, we re- 
ceive, as the ultimate counsel on reading, the maxim, 
Non multa, sed multum, ‘Not many things, but much,’ 
‘much’ signifies, in part, ‘with great frequency.’ 
From this more general discussion of why, what, 
and how, let us pass to a number of concrete sug- 
gestions about reading, suitable to the needs and 
opportunities of men engaged in a non-literary pro- 
fession. 
First. Select for your private property, as it 
were, some one standard author; one with whom 
you mean to keep company for ten years. Love
-P-A-G-E-129
  
AN AUTHOR AS PLAYMATE 119 
him as the wolf loves the lamb—swallow him whole. 
Yet, on second thought, do not bolt him. Gradually 
masticate all that he has written, and the best of 
what has been written about him. Try to pierce the 
secret of his life and activity. The proper study of 
mankind is biography. When you have found his 
secret, it will probably bear a resemblance to some- 
thing within yourself, and that, too, no matter how 
gigantic your hero may look to you at first, or how 
remote his interests may seem from yours. The in- 
terests of all men and all ages are much the same, 
in kind if not in vigor. Accordingly, when you are 
casting about for a fish, do not be afraid of landing 
one that is too big. You may have the swiftest and 
strongest in the ocean, almost for the asking. The 
big fellows are always swimming in clear view. 
There is that leviathan Homer. You may draw him 
out with a hook—out of the book-market with an 
eighty-cent silver hook; and you may play with him 
as with a bird. Hugest of beasts that swim, he is 
the most amiable and amusing of household pets. 
The most fortunate and enviable of householders are 
those who, having a fair portion of this world’s 
goods and friends, have early in life caught a sub- 
stantial author for a playmate. To know his ways 
does not require much time. Many a business man 
gives more time to his dog; and the dog will live 
only a dozen years. 
Secondly. Have a few good books, of various 
sorts, not set on a shelf, but lying on a table where 
they can be easily opened. If you are, or think you 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  120 LITERATURE FOR ENGINEERS 
are, an unusually hard-working man, have the table 
near your bed, and read a little each night before 
you go to sleep. That may possibly be a strain on 
your eyes; but eye-strain is preferable to mental 
starvation. Turn at least ten pages in some good 
book every day. That will allow you 3650 pages 
every year, which is about equivalent to Homer, 
Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, and the Old Testament, 
in texts or versions easily accessible. The better the 
book, the more valuable the twenty minutes you 
give to it. And let no one object that good litera- 
ture is hard or uninteresting, or wearying to a mind 
already tired. The objection is a sure sign that the 
person who makes it is speaking without experience. 
He has not tried our experiment. He has second- 
rate books, or no books, or even bad books, on his 
table. Cultivate also the acquaintance of pocket- 
editions—in Everyman’s Library (published by Dut- 
ton) or The World’s Classics (Oxford Press) or 
The Temple Primers and Temple Classics (Dutton). 
One of the most widely-read men I know makes it 
his boast that he never had a course in ‘English,’ 
and has done most of his reading on the train. 
Thirdly. Read in company. As we observed be- 
fore, literature is a social art. In cultivating it we 
should set, and not follow, the fashion. If you are 
a university student, read with your room-mate, and 
have a tender care for his taste. Above all, read 
aloud. Organize readings for Sunday afternoon at 
your fraternity-house or club. The Greek-letter 
societies originally had some connection or other
-P-A-G-E-131
GOOD BOOKS IN THE HOME 121 
with the pursuit of literature. Their extraordinary 
growth in our great schools of technology and ap- 
plied science is one of the strange developments in 
American education. Why not restore to them some- 
thing of their lost function? It may be that they 
have emigrated from their birth-place, where Greek 
was taught, to the very end of preserving the cul- 
ture of the land. 
The technical student should also look forward to 
the time when he will again be in his home, and pre- 
pare himself to read and listen there. In recent 
years there has been harsh criticism all over the 
country of the methods in vogue in the teaching of 
English. Some of it is justified in so far as the 
teachers are ill-prepared for their work, though the 
nation is culpable in not providing better prepara- 
tion for them. Yet the teachers of English are con- 
fronted by an almost insoluble problem. They are 
virtually asked to accomplish by artificial stimulus 
in school and college what ought to be done naturally 
in the home. In the university, they are expected 
to give young men between the ages of eighteen and 
twenty-one a feeling for literature that usually is 
not acquired after the age of twelve. They can tell 
in an instant whether a Freshman has been reared 
in an atmosphere of good books, in a family where 
the excellent old custom persists of reading the Bible 
aloud, or comes from a house where father, mother, 
and children alike buy only the yellow journals and 
cheap magazines. In the latter case, he may appear 
to be well-fed and well-clothed, yet the first word he

utters will betray his mental ae In combat- 
ing this sort of poverty and famine we can do some- 
thing for our own generation, but we naturally have 
better hopes of the next. We can warn its parents. 
When a child asks for bread, no father will pur- 
posely give him a stone. 
Hence, fourthly. Begin no 
brary, for fear that those who shall some day be 
dependent upon you may starve. It is not important 
that a young man should own many books of general 
literature; it is imperative that he should own good 
books, and use them. The ted way to assure your- 
self that you really own a volume is to underscore 
sentences, and pencil the margin. For the sake of 
definiteness, I shall name a Tendfal of books that 
every one ought to possess and wear out, adding a 
hint or two about serviceable editions: The Iliad 
of Homer, translated by Lang, Leaf, and Myers, and 
published by the Macmillan Company.—The Odys- to accumulate a li- 
sey of Homer, translated by

best story of adventure ev utcher and Lang, is- 
The Odyssey is the 
put together.—The 
Divine Comedy of Dante, 4 any one of several 
translations; for example, in that of Tozer, published 
by the Oxford University Press—The Oxford Shake- 
speare, in one volume, published by the Oxford Uni- 
versity Press. This certainly is the best compendi- 
ous edition to recommend.—The 1911 Bible,’ pub- 
lished by the Oxford University Press, ‘a scholarly 
and carefully-corrected text of the historic English 
Bible, the time-honored Autlorized Version.’ One 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
USE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY 123 
reason why people fail to see that the Bible is the 
most interesting book in the world is that they are 
afraid of it; but the student of literature must not 
be put out of countenance by his own prejudices. 
Another reason is that it is usually cut up into 
verses in such fashion that the sequence of thought 
is injured. ‘The 1911 Bible,’ by restoring the origi- 
nal paragraph or strophe, ordinarily enables one to 
understand the connection, where one did not under- 
stand before. Throw away all preconceptions and 
second-hand opinions, and begin with the story of 
Job.—Last, the Oxford Milton, published by the 
Oxford University Press. At current prices, these 
six books will cost in all, I think, about seven dol- 
lars. They may prove a safer equipment for a liberal 
education than the multitude of authors in the stacks 
of a university library. 
Fifthly. At the same time, one need not be afraid 
of large public collections, either. There is, indeed, 
some danger that the multiplication of free circulat- 
ing libraries may discourage the private ownership 
of books. Yet the danger will hardly frighten a

larger collections than the average individual can 
afford, one could scarcely thi of prosecuting any 
study, whether literary or technical. Accordingly, 
for the sake of thoroughly owing the author we 
have taken as our playmate, let us utilize some near-

o not know what the 
inside of the university porary is like. 
We may now come back to the points that need final 
attention. Good general reading enables a man to 
work more freely and sanguinely and rapidly in his 
special vocation. This is not fancy, but solid fact. 
General reading is an act of recuperation. Most of an 
engineer’s mental activity is in the nature of exercise. 
His profession wears out the tissue of his mind. Good 
reading nourishes and builds up that tissue. Profes- 
sional men often complain ‘had they have little or no 
time for books. The better men seem to have time. 
Some have time, perhaps, because they are better engi- 
neers and the like; but more probably they are better 
professional men because they take time to feed their 
minds. They have time for the essential things of life, 
because their brains, being well-fed, have tone, and 
work with fearless precision. Time is elastic. He who 
as a man takes time for good general reading will find 
that his general reading gains time for him as an engi- 
neer or a lawyer or a physician. The proof of this 
pudding is in the eating. We have heard about the old 
ideal of education: ‘a sound mind in a sound body.’ 
Reconstructed to meet the conditions of the present  
-P-A-G-E-135
LITERATURE AN ANTIDOTE TO FEAR 495 
day, this ideal should be stated thus: a specifically 
trained mind, in a well-nourished soul, in a healthy 
frame. Of such a man his country will not feel 
ashamed. 
Such a man will not often be troubled by fear. 
From the Greeks down, the greatest poets and critics 
have been almost unanimous in recognizing that a 
primary function of the best literature is to release 
men from fear, to imbue them with an exalted and 
reverent courage. Thus, in the ideal Republic of Plato, 
Socrates would admit only such poetry as might after 
a positive fashion confirm the hearts of his ideal citi- 
zens, and directly contribute to the development in 
them of reverence. Thus the real Greeks under Xeno- 
phon chanted a pean before entering into battle. And 
thus the Normans of William the Conqueror are said 
to have moved against the English at Hastings, a re- 
nowned minstrel in front singing their national epic, 
the Song of Roland. 
In peace, fear is the subtle and destructive enemy of 
all original thought and action, of that personal inde- 
pendence which every man must preserve if he is to be 
deemed free, and of that unqualified devotion to his 
country which patriotism at all times demands. Little 
as men realize it, the atmosphere they live in is sur- 
charged with an infectious terror, blighting their per- 
sonal happiness, thwarting their services to the com- 
monwealth. In the long run, the most potent of all 
incentives and deterrents with respect to individual 
action is the fear of what others may say or think. 
And thus men live so continuously in a state of anxiety, 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  126 LITERATURE FOR ENGINEERS 
which is another name for fear, that they are not aware 
of the disease. They believe, because it is common, 
that it is a state of health. Yet; it is both chronic and 
vulgar. The anxiety to be like other people, only big- 
ger and richer, is, like nearly all the forms of fear, 
unspeakably vulgar; as vulgar now as when Aristotle 
observed that epic poetry and tragedy, in the hands of 
Homer and Sophocles, gave men pleasure by relieving 
them of certain disturbing emotions, one of which was 
fear. The antidote to individual and communal fear 
may be had in a few volumes. 
Here are fourteen lines from one of them, the senti- 
ments of a man eminently fearless, eminently reverent, 
a lofty being, endowed with every power of enjoyment 
that nature could bestow, or education develop; who 
nevertheless gave the vigor of his manhood to rela- 
tively humble and most laborious service of his State ; 
who lost his eyesight in that unremitting labor; who, 
old, impoverished, blind, lived a suspect under a re- 
stored monarchy which he hated as a tyranny ; who yet 
retained his courage unabated, and preserved his faith 
in the efficacy of human endeavor. In simplicity, in 
reverence, in the power of inspiring courage, there are, 
outside his own works, few things in English, or in any 
other modern language, to equal Milton’s sonnet On 
his Blindness: 
When I consider how my light is spent 
Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide, 
And that one talent which is death to hide 
Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent 
To serve therewith my Maker, and present
-P-A-G-E-137
POWER AND FREEDOM 127 
My true account, lest He, returning, chide— 
“Doth God exact day-labor, light denied?’ 
I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent 
That murmur, soon replies: ‘God doth not need 
Either man’s work or His own gifts; who best 
Bear His mild yoke, they serve Him best. His state 
Is kingly: thousands at His bidding speed 
And post o’er land and ocean without rest; 
They also serve who only stand and wait.’ 
In our age of hurry we may accept this final senti- 
ment respecting two kinds of service as of some value, 
since it comes from one who, after all, far exceeded the 
petty measure of our accomplishment to-day. Indeed, 
this poet, scholar, patriot, is the man, and his are the 
civic virtues, that Wordsworth longed for in times 
much like our own, with a longing not more suitable in 
England than in America: 
Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour. 
England hath need of thee. She is a fen 
Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen, 
Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower, 
Have forfeited their ancient English dower 
Of inward happiness. We are selfish men: 
O! raise us up, return to us again; 
And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power. 
Thy soul was like a star, and dwelt apart; 
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea. 
Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free, 
So didst thou travel on life’s common way 
In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart 
The lowliest duties on herself did lay.

TEACHER AND STUDENT* 
F I could now command the use of a few stage- 
properties, and several good, solemn, hypocritical 
actors, it would be not only diverting, but instructive, 
to have the curtain open, as it were, on a set of men, 
or rather reappearing ghosts, called Sophists, who 
should entertain us with cunning debate, in the antique 
style, on the difference between a teacher and a student 
—if there be a difference. There should: be a sympa- 
thetic ‘Chorus, and a leader of it, to call attention to 
each speaker before he began his part, and to stand 
aside in respectful silence during the speeches. We 
might, indeed, find the characters engaging, less be- 
cause they were ancient, than because the Greek Soph- 
ists had so many traits that are distinctly modern. 
But a dialogue carried on by Sophists appearing in the 
flesh, like Ibsen’s Ghosts, would be very suggestive if 
they maintained, in sophistical fashion, that the teacher 
and the student are not essentially the same person. 
It would suggest that the race of Sophists is not all 
dead ; that it comprises a large class of ingenious men

in every age, including many who seem to be fore- 
most in the realm of thought and education; and that 
America at this very hour is well supplied with Soph- 
ists incarnate. If only we could unmask and identify 
them! 
But to carry out the dramatic fiction would not 
satisfy the ends of a discussion that is intended to be 
more profitable than amusing. Nor may we now pry 
into the whole art of sophistry. For that, the curious 
reader must be sent to Jowett’s translation of the 
Dialogues of Plato, and to the writings of Matthew 
Arnold and Dr. Flexner. And yet it may illuminate 
the relation betwixt teacher and student to consider 
for a moment the ways of the Sophist, if haply we may 
learn of him and be wise. What are his character- 
istics? 
The Greeks also asked this question, for the Sophist 
was a frequent apparition among them; he called him- 
self a teacher; and he appeared so suddenly in so many 
different places that they found it necessary to identify 
and label him. To them—to Plato, for example—a 
Sophist was one who professed to have wisdom in gen- 
eral, and to be able to make other men wise, though he 
himself had no thorough knowledge of any one thing. 
For a substantial consideration, he would give you 
general culture with no special effort on his side, while 
you yourself were not under the painful necessity of 
learning anything in particular. He discoursed, or, as 
we should say, lectured; and you merely listened in 
delight to what he asserted. Yet to Plato the truly 
wise man was Socrates, who began operations by con-
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 TEACHER AND STUDENT 
fessing his ignorance; who was swift to inquire, and 
reluctant to affirm; and who, when he taught, taught 
only the habit and method of investigation. To Aris- 
totle, the greatest student of all time, a Sophist is a 
man who makes money by sham wisdom. Now every 
one, of course, obtains a living somehow; so that mak- 
ing money, or even the gaining of a reputation, cannot 
be the mark either of sham wisdom or of true. The 
primary trait of a Sophist, then, is his unwillingness 
to admit his own ignorance. He simply lacks the cour- 
age to say ‘I do not know.’ He begins with a flat asser- 
tion, rather than a question or hypothesis; he has 
investigated no one subject from the bottom up, but 
deals in sounding generalities; and, through a show of 
wisdom, he deceives himself and imposes on the crowd, 
so that they pay him money and spread abroad his 
renown. As he is afraid to say ‘I do not know,’ so is 
he unaware that silence is golden. He thinks that he 
will be heard for his much speaking. He therefore 
imagines that the aim of a liberal education is facility 
in self-expression. He develops a knack of rhetoric, 
yet never becomes a true orator, for what he says may 
stimulate attention, but cannot dominate the memory. 
He is fond of verbal quibbling, and tends to repeat his 
eatchwords, and to force them out of their normal 
meanings; though in general he utters stereotyped 
phrases like ‘in that direction’ and ‘along those lines’ ; 
and, not being possessed of the low cunning necessary 
to success in mathematics, will say that something or 
other ‘centres around’ a point. Again, having mere 
seraps of classical lore, and an abysmal ignorance of
-P-A-G-E-141
  CHARACTER OF THE SOPHIST 131 
the culture in the Middle Ages, he will use. the words 
‘old’ and ‘medieval’ as terms of censure, and ‘modern’ 
as a term of unqualified praise. But his favorite word 
of commendation is ‘broad’; and his ideal man is 
‘proad-minded,’ whatever that may mean—it seems to 
designate a person with a mind like a loose, ill-fitting 
shoe. He does not think that ‘broad’ ig the way that 
leadeth to destruction. Accordingly, his stock-in-trade 
of words and notions is partly eccentric and mostly 
tame. When the audience madly applauds, he does 
not (like the ancient orator) remark in an aside to his 
friend, ‘I must have said something foolish.’ He is, 
in fact, more eager for applause than for pelf—though 
he likes pelf, too. He is so intent upon winning both 
that he has no time for study. Yet he talks of over- 
work, or at all events of the multitude of his cares. In 
his search for novelty of thought, he has acquired the 
habit of making the worse appear the better reason ; he 
tells you that power gained by studying a subject that 
is hard, like Greek or mathematics, cannot be trans- 
ferred to the acquisition of a subject that is easy. 
He is far less apt to quote from Bacon’s essay Of 
Studies than from Mr. Dooley on Democracy and 
Education. In studies, he advocates the line of least 
resistance, which is the line of free choice from the 
kindergarten to the grave. He maintains that ‘cul- 
ture’ is to be had from every subject, and implies 
that it may be obtained as well from manual train- 
ing or blacksmithing as from mathematics or Greek 
—or English. At all events, he will say these things 
so long as the crowd repeats them. When their no-
-P-A-G-E-142
132 TEACHER AND STUDENT 
tions are altered, his utterances change also. Fi- 
nally, the Sophist cannot distinguish a man of real 
learning, save by a vague feeling of discomfort or 
apprehension when they meet, and a sense of being 
on his guard. He exhibits a kind of rage at phil- 
osophical ideas, if any one attempts to apply them 
to the practice of teaching. 
It now appears that, while talking of the Sophist, 
we have been thinking of the sort of teacher who is 
not primarily a student. And shall I confess that, 
out of an endless line of shadowy forms, seen darkly 
in a magic glass, and extending from remote anti- 
quity down to this month and minute, I have been 
watching the mien and gestures, grave or gay, of 
three notable Sophists whom the world has called 
educational leaders? And that, in reporting my 
vision, I have combined the most salient traits of 
these three great ones into a single composite por- 
trait? Their names are Protagoras, Evenus, and 
Prodicus; and the men are neither wholly dead nor 
wholly alive, but sometimes they seem to be phan- 
toms, and sometimes flesh and blood; though actually 
Protagoras has an existence in the real world, while 
Prodicus and Evenus are now in the abode of 
shadows.+ 
1It may be proper to explain that each of the three character- 
sketches is likewise a composite picture. If one of them sug- 
gests a historical personage whom I have elsewhere quoted with 
respect, it should be remembered that some freedom is granted 
to the method of satire, which must aim to represent, not indi- 
viduals, but general types, yet cannot create them out of noth- 
ing, 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  SOPHISTS GRAVE AND GAY 133 
The writings of Protagoras are familiar to all 
teachers of English, for the man himself once ap- 
peared in our midst, at the age of sixty-one, and 
began to make us wise by the direct method; nor did 
he fail to attain the end for which he came, though 
in St. Louis not more than three hundred and fifty 
Philistines would pay and hear him at one time. 
But a teacher of English in the Middle West has 
recently published a book entitled Protagoras—How 
to Know Him; so that there is little excuse for us 
if we fail to recognize the greatest of modern Eng- 
lish Sophists, who wrote on culture and anarchy and 
Homer and Celtic literature and many other sub- 
jects. At times a poet, at times almost a philosopher, 
a lucid and often elevating writer, he nevertheless 
was a teacher rather than a student, a fact which 
kept him from being the best kind of teacher. And 
by the following anecdote one may certainly know 
him; it is related by Goldwin Smith, who says: 
‘[Protagoras] was outwardly a singular contrast 
to his almost terribly earnest sire. Not that he was 
by any means without serious purpose, especially in 
his province of education. His outward levity was 
perhaps partly a mask, possibly in some measure a 
recoil from his father’s sternness. As we were travel- 
ing together in a railway carriage, I observed a pile 
of books at his side. ‘‘These,’’ said he, with a gay 
air, ‘‘are Celtic books which they send me. Be- 
cause I have written on Celtic literature, they fancy 
I must know something of the language.’’’ 
‘His ideas,’ adds Goldwin Smith, ‘had been formed 
by a few weeks at a Welsh watering-place.’ +

134 TEACHER AND STUDENT 
Prodicus, a venerable figure in whose career there 
always was a certain distinction, in bygone years 
was the leading spirit in a famous Oriental univer- 
sity. Like Protagoras, he wrote and spoke with abil- 
ity upon things in general, including religion and 
education, without a knowledge of the details in any 
one field of scholarship, however small. We might 
fancy him to have been well-versed, if not in He- 
brew, yet in New-Testament Greek; but his ideas of 
religion were not formed by severe study. Similarly, 
without being an accomplished Latinist, and without 
an extensive acquaintance with the teaching of Lat- 
in, he courageously divulged his sentiments on the 
value of linguistic discipline, to the confusion of the 
more or less experienced. For good or ill, no other 
man in his generation seemed to wield more power 
over Occidental education than Prodicus, partly 
through a lack of restraint in his followers, who, with 
the great body of American Sophists, metamor- 
phosed our colleges and similar institutions. Fi- 
nally, their educational system, if it could be called 
a system, descending upon the secondary schools, 
disintegrated these as well. Yet, for all his persua- 
siveness and acumen, and for all his native dignity 
and common sense, it may be said of Prodicus, as 
Socrates said of himself, and as the rest of us may 
say of ourselves, that he knew nothing; with this 
difference, that Socrates openly confessed it, and 
acted in harmony with the confession. And hence 
the time will come when men will ask: Did Prodicus 
work greater good, or greater harm, to American
-P-A-G-E-145
SOPHISTS GRAVE AND GAY 135 
education than any other man in history? But 
even now it is not impossible to understand him, if 
we begin the process in Socratic fashion. What did 
Prodicus teach or study in particular before he as- 
sumed the réle of making men wise in general? Of 
the thousands to whom his name and fame are famil- 
iar, virtually no one can reply. But the answer 
is that, before he began to fix the place of humane 
letters in the curriculum, Prodicus taught a certain 
branch of physical science. Did he love his subject 
with the quenchless love that qualifies a man to be 
a leader of education? It is boasted by friends of 
Prodicus that after he ceased, in his early prime, to 
instruct in his chosen field, he never again, through- 
out an ample lifetime, so much as looked at a book 
on that subject. Instead, he is said to have assisted 
artless publishing-houses, to his and their mutual 
advantage, in measuring the wisdom of the past in 
terms of flea-skips, making dubious estimates of books 
in general according to their length, at a time when 
he might well have hesitated about acting as a crit- 
ie of monographs in his own particular field. To 
tell the truth, Prodicus, though amply and variously 
endowed by nature, was not born with literary 
genius; nor did he become in fact a well-read man. 
No doubt the canny publishers were able to trade 
upon his reputation, and he was honestly deceived 
to his own profit; for some men are born Sophists, 
some achieve sophistry, and some have sophistry 
thrust upon them. 
Evenus is no mere college president. Indeed, no 
magie mirror will disclose whether he is a single 
   
-P-A-G-E-146
136 TEACHER AND STUDENT 
wise man, or many gathered into one. He is evanes- 
cent and ubiquitous. His speech may be heard at 
any time, in any place, on any subject or none; for 
his voice is an echo of all voices. Though he is 
always in all eyes and in his own, no man hath seen 
Evenus; nor hath Evenus often seen himself. He 
is a living mask and an embodied shadow, who be- 
comes aware of himself only in the presence of a 
student who studies, and then only through an inde- 
terminate sense of pain; for he wishes to be looked 
at, but not to be discovered. Must we find him a 
local habitation, as well as a name? If so, he is a 
kind of sultan in Mecca, the surintendent of a col- 
legiate institute so great in point of numbers that 
it long since outstripped the University of Cairo, 
while the University of Valparaiso has lost hope of 
vying with it, As an Oriental potentate he has the 
Midas-touch, and a feeling for all generalities that 
tickle the masses. Gold and pupils rush in upon 
Evenus in an endless stream, while the poet and 
musician flee away. The crowd listens to him 
breathlessly, and does not remember what he says: 
The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed. 
He seems always to be uttering general truths, and to 
speak upon many themes, above all upon education. 
But he, too, knows nothing in particular. There is 
no subject, nor any part of one, in which he is an 
acknowledged master; and herein he differs from the 
head of the Collége de France, in Paris, which is at 
the summit of French education; for the head of
-P-A-G-E-147
A REAL AUTHORITY 137 
the Collége de France is an acknowledged master of 
Greek. The magic glass will not reveal the funec- 
tion of Evenus as an educator; but many years ago 
a teacher of English in an Eastern school helped me 
to understand it. This teacher said: 
‘Evenus is the most wonderful man I ever met. 
You cannot ask a question of any sort, on any sub- 
ject, to which Evenus will not give you an immediate 
and final answer.’ 
I straightway begged for a sample of Evenus’ 
wisdom; but for some reason my informant could 
not repeat a single one of his replies. Whereupon 
I said to this teacher of English: 
‘In sheer intellect, the ablest man I ever met is 
Professor So-and-so, of such and such a Continental 
university. He is a leading European authority in 
a field to which, as it happens, I have devoted some 
years of study. If you go to Professor So-and-so, 
and ask him a question, he is likely to reply, ‘‘I do 
not know,’’ or ‘‘We do not know’’; for he is abreast 
of his times, and in his case the two statements are 
identical. He is then likely to continue, counting 
off his points of ignorance on his thumb and fingers: 
“I [or ‘‘We’’] do not know this first thing; and we 
do not know this second; nor do we know this third, 
nor yet this fourth. But here,’’ touching his little 
finger, ‘‘is a small but important thing which 
scholars have discovered. Let us begin with that.’’’ 
Professor So-and-so has spent far more of his life 
in studying than in talking; he has had a hand in 
training the greatest teachers of English in America, 
not to speak of other nations; and he is still one of 
the great teachers of his day. 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 TEACHER AND STUDENT 
Our topic, however, is not sophistry, but its anti- 
dote. By teacher and student we mean one person, 
the teacher as a student. 
The antidote for sophistry is intensive study; not 
general reading, however indispensable that may be, 
but special investigation. For the teacher of Eng- 
lish, actual or prospective, it is graduate study under 
scholarly supervision—under the direction of some 
one of the few highly productive scholars in our 
American universities; or else abroad; or, prefer- 
ably, first in America, and then in Europe. It is 
the study, not of things in general, but of one thing 
at a time, and of some one substantial subject for 
at least three years. A few weeks at a Welsh water- 
ing-place, a few weeks at a summer school, are not 
enough. Intensive study, coupled with extensive, 
and with a real philosophy of scholarship, is the sole 
means of regenerating English in America, where 
the subject has for the most part fallen into a so- 
phistical art of rhetoric. And a sophistical art it 
will remain so long as the emphasis is laid upon ex- 
pression, and not upon the truth and value of what 
is to be uttered; nay, until the pupils are taught to 
be silent until it is clear they have something to say. 
The ‘daily theme’ gives training in sophistry. 
In the long run, though, a man must be his own 
teacher, and must study for himself. He must seek 
out a topic not too great for his powers, yet one that 
will stretch them, and follow it consistently until 
he transcends himself through learning; for, while 
there is a distinction between pupil and master,
-P-A-G-E-149
  APPARENT AND REAL STUDY 139 
there is no essential difference between teacher and 
student. First-hand knowledge, completely possessed, 
gives one a base-line and a touchstone for esti- 
mating the extent and reality of the knowledge or 
pretensions of one’s fellow-teachers and one’s pupils. 
It enables us to distinguish between true generaliza- 
tion and empty platitude, between the grasp of wis- 
dom and the show. But the process of learning 
never ceases. The man who takes up the profession 
of teacher for life has taken up the profession of 
student for life. If not, he will suffer shipwreck. 
He may not lose his position in the world; Sophists 
do not lose their stipends and emoluments. But he 
will lose his self-respect, and his power in his work. 
Can a teacher who has ceased to study continue to 
sympathize with his pupils who are studying? Can 
he help them in the most critical point of instruc- 
tion, namely, in the art and method of study? 
Our pupils in the university who listen to lectures 
all day long do not know how to study, nor did they 
know how when they came to us as Freshmen. Why 
is that? The reasons, which are many, might be 
summed up in various ways. It has been hinted that 
American education has for years been in the hands 
of the Sophists, and is at their merey. And we may 
add that America for years has desired, not culture, 
but the appearance of it. The collegian is satisfied 
with a pass-mark of 60, and his elders are content 
if this brings him the degree of B.A. But, more 
definitely, the reason why the pupils cannot study 
seems to be this. Preparatory teachers are so beset
-P-A-G-E-150
  140 TEACHER AND. STUDENT 
with large classes and heavy schedules that they feel 
they have neither time nor energy for systematic 
private reading; and, if they have lost: the habit of 
study, they cannot give it to their charges. Yet in 
all likelihood the general conditions as to hours and 
classes will not greatly improve within our lifetime; 
and hence the difficulty cannot be met by complain- 
ing. We must somehow study on in spite of all, en- 
eouraged by the thought that teachers who do man- 
age to study, who begin by utilizing spare moments 
and half-holidays, in the end find more and more 
time for it. 
For their sake, let us outline a few courses that a 
teacher of English may give to himself as a vital 
elixir—as a relief and antidote for the difficulties 
and educational sophistries amidst which we stu- 
dents must live and breathe. Having alluded to the 
Platonic Sophists, we may turn to the Platonic no- 
tion of a symposium. And indeed it is seemly to 
begin any kind of educational banquet with Plato. 
Accordingly, by way of grace before meat, one may 
counsel every teacher, as Horace bids the poet: Go 
mark the world; and, Study the page Socratic.* 
That is, let us observe our fellow-men, whom we must 
‘understand in order to teach them; and for educa- 
tional ideas, let us go not to Matthew Arnold, or to 
Dr. Flexner, or to any one else, so much as to Plato 
—since it is to Plato that many a suggestive writer 
of the day owes the better part of his inspiration.

  COURSES FOR TEACHERS OF ENGLISH 141 
In the banquet, first of all comes the course in 
some favorite author—a great. poet, let us hope; say 
Milton or Wordsworth, or, if he be a prose poet, then 
some master of eloquence like Bacon or Ruskin. 
‘Choose him with care, as one would a husband or a 
wife. If he be.a first-rate poet in the stricter sense, 
read every word he ever published, and at the same 
time narrowly examine some one of his poems, as it 
were with a microscope. Ask yourself a thousand 
questions about it; delay the process of answering, 
and collect evidence that may settle them. Enter 
into your poet’s life, and make his friends your 
friends. Read what he read, for thus you will give 
yourself the education of a poet—no bad thing for 
a teacher of literature. Translate portions of him 
into the foreign language you know best. After an 
interval, translate these selections back into Eng- 
lish, and compare. Roger Ascham taught Queen 
Elizabeth after some such fashion; Franklin acquired 
an enviable style in a. similar way; and Sir Philip 
Sidney learned to write English by the same means." 
Study your poet, then, with dictionaries; and if some 
one has made a concordance of his poems, study that. 
Perhaps you never have read steadily: in the great 
Oxford Dictionary of English, or in Bradshaw’s 
Concordance to. Milton; one cannot conceive how 
fascinating the game is save by trying it. Work 
into your author deeply, and work. out again in all 
directions, until you live his life as he lived it in his

age. To relive the life of a Wordsworth or a Mil- 
ton is a prophylactic against sophistry. It is the 
sort of thing the Sophist never does. 
Secondly, there is the course in the principles of 
literature. For these, go to the masters and pro- 
ducers, and not to the middlemen. Go to Plato, 
Aristotle, Horace, and Longinus for a knowledge of 
the art of poetry, and an understanding of the es- 
sentials of a noble and impressive style. Read these 
authors themselves; do not first read what lesser 
men have said about them. And read what the poets 
and orators have said about their own art. Read 
Shelley’s Defense of Poetry, and Wordsworth on 
poetic diction; Cicero and Quintilian on the educa- 
tion of an orator, and Burke’s essay On the Sublime 
and Beautiful. 
This second course will immediately lead to a study 
of the main types of literature: the epic, the drama, 
the novel, lyrical poetry and pastoral, the sonnet, 
the character-sketch. Such are the forms in which 
the human mind normally expresses itself. Even 
the character of the Sophist must be sketched ac- 
cording to standards set for this kind of writing by 
Theophrastus. Follow the development of the novel 
from the Odyssey to the Greek romances, and from 
these through the Italians and the contemporaries 
of Shakespeare to the eighteenth century, to Goethe’s 
Wilhelm Meister and the works of Richardson and 
Fielding, and so to Thackeray and George Eliot.

tus Such, or with the character-sketches of John

Galsworthy, trace this type of composition back 
through the Tatler and Spectator and the Serious 
Call of William Law to La Bruyére, and from Hall, 
Overbury, and Earle, and the comedy of Ben Jon- 
son, back through the medieval rhetoricians, and so 
through Rome to Greece—to Theophrastus and the 
Rhetoric of Aristotle. 
The investigation of literary types will inevitably 
take one away from the English, which is a deriva- 
tive literature, to those Mediterranean literatures 
from which the English poets and orators have drawn 
their models, and, in very truth, their vital force. 
The epics of Milton carry us back to Dante, to Virgil, 
to Homer; his tragedy to Aschylus; his Lycidas to 
the Italian pastoral poets, and thence to the Eclogues 
of Virgil and the Idyls of Theocritus; just as Tenny- 
son, Wordsworth, and Burns, since they all studied 
Theocritus, suggest that we should do the same. 
And the study of any English poet leads, not only 
to classical sources, but also to the corresponding 
types in the Bible. It will also lead to the study of 
other modern literatures; since we cannot under- 
stand ourselves unless we know our neighbors, 
whether they be friends or enemies. However, it 
may be said that all the European literatures have 
been friendly with one another; they are all of one 
family. 
But doubtless our nearest neighbors in matters of 
the intellect have been the Greeks and Romans, since 
every English poet of the first rank read the Latin

poets, and every Roman poet read those of Greece. 
Accordingly, next in importance to cultivating some 
great English poet as a familiar friend, we may rate 
the last course now to be mentioned, a course in 
Greek and Latin literature. In the classical writers, 
even when approached through translations, we have 
not simply an antidote for sophistry, nor merely a 
single course in-a banquet, but a complete and 
wholesome feast—one that for a year will provide 
a hungry man or woman with daily bread, the spirit- 
ual food we pray for.*

and gleaming in the early sunlight. From the 
centre of the orb run delicate yet powerful radii to 
the circumference, and, as these rays diverge, they 
are crossed at narrow intervals by slender filaments 
that make a succession of concentric polygons within 
the confines of the whole; so that the whole becomes 
a cosmic network of correspondences and sympa- 
thetic communications. At the centre rests the subtle 
being that spun the cosmie pattern, like the soul ina 
well-ordered brain, constantly in touch with its sources 
of information. Perhaps no other form or pattern 
in external nature is so accessible to our sense of 
beauty, and to that grasp of order which is the es- 
sence of knowledge, as this web of the orb-weaving 
garden spider. The specimen needs no preparation. 
No microscope or telescope, no scalpel, no elaborate 
procedure, is required for a first inspection. The 
object is of intermediate size, as easily contemplated 
as the order of our thoughts about it, and more 
familiar to us Americans than the patterns in the 
starry sky. Indeed, it may be used as a type or 
semblance of the human mind, or of organized sci- 
ence, for, like the structure of the soul, or of the 
cosmos, it represents an idea, or form, or figure, in 
the mind of the Divine Creator. 
If the mention of Ilissus and the beautiful forms 
of nature and intellect has not already suggested 
the Socratic dialogues, the image of a child, or at 
all events of an unspoiled mind, fascinated by a 
pattern will surely recall the Platonic doctrine of 
forms or ideas, as the cobweb should recall the 
masterly plan of the Phadrus.
-P-A-G-E-157
  RHETORIC AND MENTAL PATTERNS 147 
In that dialogue we find that rhetoric, the servant 
of education, is described as the art of enchanting 
the soul; for love is a kind of enchantment, and 
good rhetoric is the art of the good and successful 
lover. As such, it is indispensable to the teacher, 
for he may be defined as the lover of humanity; to 
the lover of wisdom; to the lover of that truth which 
is beauty, and that beauty which is truth—as both 
Plato and Keats aver. It is the art which he must 
strive to acquire who would introduce form and 
order into the minds of men. 
No doubt this talk of woven orbs and patterns, 
and woven words and arguments, of an art of rhetori¢ 
which is also an art of love, and an art of love which 
is nothing but the prosaic art of teaching, will not 
in all respects commend itself to some of those who 
instruct the young in English composition, and who 
unwittingly still perpetuate the methods our fathers 
derived from the arid Scotch rhetoricians. In time, 
perhaps, we shall repudiate most of this heritage 
from the Scotch, and go back to the Greeks (whom 
the Scotch now and then consulted), seeing that 
they not only produced the best models of eloquence, 
but also understood how and why they did so. Now 
the ancient theory of rhetoric differed from one that 
calls itself modern, in a very important respect. It 
began, of course—as the modern one, let us hope, 
does also—by insisting that the speaker should know 
the truth about the subject he has under discussion, 
and, what is more, that he should tell the truth about 
it; he must know something at first hand before
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 PATTERNS 
offering to speak ‘at all, and he must be fair and hon- 
est in presenting what he knows. But, this assump- 
tion made, the ancient theory went upon the princi- 
ple that in order to fascinate, teach, and persuade, 
you need something more. In addition, or, indeed, 
first of all, you must thoroughly understand the soul 
of the man to whom your speech is addressed. You 
could not draw the mind of an undergraduate from 
the athletic-field to Bartram’s Garden with a cob- 
web, or from there to the outskirts of Athens with 
a hawser and a yoke of oxen, if you were not fully 
acquainted with that mind; or, if you succeeded 
without this knowledge, you would succeed by chance 
—perhaps with a chain and elephants when you 
needed but the silken filament of Arachne. If, how- 
ever, you once got inside the mind of the said under- 
graduate, so that you could feel out in every di- 
rection from the centre of it; if you knew and 
admitted precisely what it was like, what was its de- 
gree of organization or lack of organization; if, to 
change the figure, you knew what parts of it would 
hold or stretch, and what were its native motions, 
and so on, you might draw that mind, not only to 
the outskirts, but to the very pulsating heart, of civi- 
lization, and might do so with a cobweb, or some 
form even more ethereal—let us say, with a Platonic 
idea. First of all, then, the speaker must know the 
soul of the listener. 
Thus the treatises of Plato and Aristotle on rhetoric 
have the character, not of many recent works on the 
subject, but of works on psychology; so that act-
-P-A-G-E-159
THE RHETORIC OF ARISTOTLE 149 
ually there is more to be learned about human na- 
ture from the Rhetoric of Aristotle than from his 
essay, the De Anima, on psychology in the more tech- 
nical sense. These treatises reveal the. nature of 
the man in the audience; they disclose the pattern 
of the mind, and the pattern of the argument that 
will catch that mind; they discuss the traits of hu- 
manity in its various classes, and in the various 
times and circumstances of life. For several rea- 
sons they have a special value in this country at the 
present juncture, or would have it if they were care- 
fully studied. Even the minor truths to be ex- 
tracted from them are significant. It is clear, for 
example, that one will hardly gain the love of an 
elderly miser with the bait one has ready for a 
prodigal Sophomore, or a, group of such. 
This brings us to our sheep. If I refuse to dis- 
cuss at length the modern study of rhetoric which 
goes under the name of ‘English,’ it is because that 
study is typical of our whole system of liberal edu- 
eation so-called. This does not begin where it should 
begin—that is, with a consideration of the soul of 
the learner. It confuses means and ends, or rather 
neglects the end entirely. Instead of discovering, 
and then assuming, that a certain kind of person 
must be taught, it assumes that certain subjects—a 
great many—must be taught, and trusts that the 
proper students will gravitate to the classes in the 
several subjects. In other words, what passes for a 
liberal education in our American colleges and uni- 
versities does not rest upon an adequate inquiry 
11 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 PATTERNS 
into the veritable traits of the typical American at 
eighteen or twenty years of age. It is not based 
upon a sound estimate of his very great excellences, 
his undeniably grave defects. How can it, then, 
proceed to restrain and develop him according to a 
rational method? The first question is not, What 
subjects shall we teach? It is rather, What is the 
essential nature of the pupil? What is the pattern 
of his mind? What is he like? The answers to all 
other questions in education depend upon our an- 
swer to this fundamental inquiry. We may there- 
fore enter into a brief examination of the following 
topic or topics: 
The American undergraduate: What he is like; 
Why he is so; and, What we had best do with him. 
First, What is he like? With certain reservations, 
easily made, we may say he is like a young Athen- 
ian of the fourth century B.c. I quote from the 
Rhetoric of Aristotle, Book 2, chapter 12:1 
‘The young are in character prone to desire, and 
ready to carry any desire they may have formed 
into action. Of bodily desires it is the sexual to 
which they are most disposed to give way, and in 
regard to sexual desire they exercise no self-restraint. 
They are changeful, too, and fickle in their desires, 
which are as transitory as they are vehement; for 
their wishes are keen without being permanent, like 
a sick man’s fits of hunger and thirst. They are pas- 
sionate; irascible and apt to be carried away by their 
impulses. They are the slaves, too, of their passion, 
as their ambition prevents their ever brooking a 
slight, and renders them indignant at the mere idea 
of enduring an injury. And while they are fond of 
+ Welldon’s translation, pp. 164-6.
-P-A-G-E-161
  ARISTOTLE ON ‘YOUTH? 151 
honor, they are fonder still of victory; for superior- 
ity is the object of youthful desire, and victory is a 
species of superiority. Again, they are fonder both 
of honor and of victory than of money, the reason 
why they care so little for money being that they 
have never yet had experience of want. ... They 
are charitable rather than the reverse, as they have 
never yet been witnesses of many villainies; and 
they are trustful, as they have not yet been often 
deceived. They are sanguine, too; for the young are 
heated by Nature as drunken men by wine, not to 
say that they have not yet experienced frequent fail- 
ures. Their lives are lived principally in hope, as 
hope is of the future and memory of the past, and 
while the future of youth is long, its past is short; 
for on the first day of life it is impossible to remem- 
ber anything, but all things must be matters of hope. 
For the same reason they are easily deceived, as be- 
ing quick to hope. They are inclined to be valorous; 
for they are full of passion, which excludes fear, and 
of hope, which inspires confidence; as anger is in- 
compatible with fear, and the hope of something 
good is itself a source of confidence. They are bash- 
ful, too, having as yet no independent standard of 
honor, and having lived entirely in the school of 
conventional law. They have high aspirations; for 
they have never yet been humiliated by the experi- 
ence of life, but are unacquainted with the limiting 
force of circumstances; and a great idea of one’s 
own deserts, such as is characteristic of a sanguine 
disposition, is itself a form of high aspiration. Again, 
in their actions they prefer honor to expediency, as 
it is habit rather than calculation which is the rule 
of their lives; and while calculation pays regard to 
expediency, virtue pays regard exclusively to honor. 
Youth is the age when people are most devoted to 
their friends or relations or companions, as they are 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 PATTERNS 
then extremely fond of social intercourse, and have 
not yet learnt to judge their friends, or indeed any- 
thing else, by the rule of expediency. If the young 
commit a fault, it is always on the side of excess and 
exaggeration, in defiance of Chilon’s maxim [ pydev 
dyav |; for they carry everything too far, whether it 
be their love, or hatred, or anything else. They re- 
gard themselves as omniscient, and are positive in 
their assertions; this is, in fact, the reason of their 
carrying everything too far. Also, their offenses 
take the line of insolence and not of meanness, They 
are compassionate from supposing all people to be 
virtuous, or at least better than they really are; for 
as they estimate their neighbors by their own guile- 
lessness, they regard the evils which befall them as 
undeserved. Finally, they are fond of laughter, and 
consequently facetious, facetiousness being disci- 
plined insolence.’ 
In the main this description is good for all time. Yet 
there are ways in which the young American differs 
from his fellow in ancient Greece. For one thing, he 
tends, like the young Englishman, to be cleaner than 
the young man on the Continent of Europe, north or 
south. On the other hand, he is less childlike, less 
observant of detail, less fond of contemplating forms. 
His memory is poor, for his images are indistinct. He 
is like what he likes, preferring games that require 
physical strength and dexterity to various kinds of 
mental strife, such as the study of Greek, or solid 
geometry. He is unlike what he dislikes; and on the 
whole he has acquired a dislike of what Plato calls 
ideas—what we have here chosen to call patterns. His 
mind is not like the orb of Arachne, whose weaving of
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE MIND OF THE UNDERGRADUATE 153 
figures was unsurpassed among mortals. The Ameri- 
can youth has lost what the American child possesses, 
natural accuracy of observation, unappeasable curi- 
osity, a love of artistic structure, a retentive memory 
for form. 
If it be conceded that the American undergraduate 
is in general pretty much the sort of person we have 
been describing, why is he so? How does he come to 
be what he is, willing to go through the motions of an 
education, yet no lover of ideal distinctions or distinct 
ideas? In the main, not because our American stock 
is bad—it is mainly good and promising in itself; but 
because of bad teaching. No learning in the home, bad 
teaching in the schools. Save in a few cities with an 
excellent tradition, there is chaos in the American 
public schools. We hear not a little about the utility, 
or the worth, or the lack of either utility or worth, to 
be found in one study or another; but the country does 
not value the teacher; if he strictly attends to his own 
concern of studying and teaching, he has neither fame 
nor money for his efforts. In treating him thus, the 
country does itself a great wrong; but it does itself a 
greater wrong in not obtaining expert service. In com- 
parison with a teacher in France—not to mention Ger- 
many—our American is hopelessly ill-trained in the 
subjects in which he professes to instruct. And she— 
for we may now change the gender—she does not con- 
tinue long enough in the profession to learn the art of 
instruction. It requires at least three years to learn 
this art; not half who begin the process pursue it so 
long. The result is that, by a generous estimate, all
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 PATTERNS 
our pupils are in the hands of underpaid teachers, ill- 
trained in their subjects, and inexpert in class, for half 
the time; or half the pupils are in such hands all the 
time. The richest commonwealth in the world will put 
money into school-buildings, sanitary devices, adminis- 
trative officers, and janitors, but not into the training 
and the lives of teachers. Let us say nothing of classes 
of sixty in a room, when fifteen are not too few for 
efficient instruction, and eighteen begin to be too many ; 
nothing of the multiplication of subjects in the school 
curriculum, and the multiplication of interests (activi- 
ties so-called) outside, until it is impossible to learn 
any one fundamental subject well.. But let us say that 
the conditions of teaching in the public schools of 
America are bad, for every unprejudiced observer 
knows it. The average student when he leaves the high 
school, or the private school, is like the hero of the 
Homeric Margites ; he knows a great many things, and 
all very badly ; his mind has not thoroughly mastered 
any one subject. Thus the undergraduate who has just 
entered the university comes with the powers he had 
as a child, his endowment for life, almost ruined; and 
in a plurality of cases he leaves the university illiter- 
ate—he has not assimilated the patterns of English 
speech. Yet there is more hope of him at the age of 
twenty or thereabouts than of his elders at the age of 
forty. His imagination is still capable of being trained 
to grasp form or structure, and his ability to observe 
and to remember can be revived. It is still possible to 
teach him to think, though you cannot do so by lectur- 
ing to him and then asking him to write in an exami- 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  
HOW TO SAVE THE PATTERNS 155 
nation-blank a part of what you have told him, garbled. 
If yet there is hope, what are we going to do about 
it? This is our third and last question. And the an- 
swer is twofold, since there is a problem in the schools, 
and a problem in the college or university; in regard 
to both problems, however, let us not go beyond what 
directly concerns the university. 
To begin with, we must encourage the choicer spirits 
in our classes to train themselves for the vocation of 
teaching. There is an unfortunate sentiment often 
expressed nowadays, when university men, including 
professors, are gathered together, to the effect that we 
ought rather to discourage young men and women from 
entering our profession, just because conditions are 
said to be so untoward. People deem it unfair to the 
individual of superior mental endowment to send him 
into a field where the pecuniary rewards are so inade- 
quate. To this we must reply that it is unfair to the 
country not to direct the better minds into this very 
realm of endeavor. If we passively allow the mediocre 
person to drift into teaching, affairs can only go from 
bad to worse. The chief way to make conditions better 
is not to induce the State to pay more money to in- 
ferior and untrained servants, but to provide better 
service, and then to convince the public that the in- 
struction it receives is of a high order, given by men 
and women of real talent, of broad as well as intensive 
training, and expert in discovering and quickening 
ability in their pupils. If all who are concerned were 
to recognize this truth, and to act accordingly, condi- 
tions would be radically improved within half a gen- 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 PATTERNS 
eration. The standing of the profession would be 
higher, and the salaries would be more satisfactory. 
Such an inference at all events is warranted by the 
history of the improvement of conditions in medicine 
and law. Meanwhile let no one who has a true call to 
become a teacher refuse to obey for sordid reasons. 
How many a choice life of late became a willing 
sacrifice to patriotic duty! How many a young man 
of inherited wealth ungrudgingly forsook home and 
opportunity, and ended his career by death in an alien 
land: on the field of battle! And are we now to admit 
that there is no such thing as a living sacrifice to the 
welfare of the nation? Let us take heed lest our man- 
ner of advice to the young imperil’ the higher life of 
America for years to come. The eternal warfare with 
ignorance, unreason, and bad taste, has not ceased, has 
no cessation. And for the individual, what are the few 
luxuries and conveniences the teacher must forego as 
compared with the spiritual satisfactions constantly 
open to the well-educated and effective scholar and 
teacher? Accordingly, we need have no hesitation 
about advising the young man of intellectual promise 
to engage in the affair of education. Only, let us make 
sure that he is the right sort of person, willing to 
undergo a rigorous preparation in the graduate school, 
so as to run no risk of failure in mid-career. 
Such, as it seems to me, is one very pressing duty of 
our universities at the present time: to direct the fit 
though few into the path of scholarship and science ; to 
develop them and prepare them to be teachers—above 
all, teachers of the humanities; and to send them, thus
-P-A-G-E-167
  HOW TO SAVE THE PATTERNS 157 
developed and prepared, into the secondary schools. 
In this way, and in all other legitimate ways, we must 
aim to persuade the thoughtful men of the nation, and 
the leaders of the State, that the contemplative life 
transcends the active, and should be cherished by the 
government. 
But to return to the mass of our undergraduates, or 
the three-fifths of them concerning whom there is hope. 
What shall be done with the undergraduate as he is? 
What actually will induce this unthinking creature to 
think? 
Let him read Plato. The few who still take up the 
study of Greek should read as much of Plato as may be 
in the original, supplementing this with generous por- 
tions in a good translation. They should begin the 
reading of Greek with Homer and the easier parts of 
the Platonic Dialogues, and not with anything from 
Xenophon. As for the rest, the great majority, let 
them live with Jowett’s translation, taking, for ex- 
ample, the Phedrus first, then the Apology, and then 
the Republic. We should gain by substituting this 
version of Plato, since it is a masterpiece of English, 
for two-thirds of the English literature now read in 
Freshman and Sophomore courses. Were we to pro- 
voke every student in our American colleges and uni- 
versities to buy and read’ this work, within the space 
of two years the United States of America would be- 
come a nation ready for the highest culture. It is 
Plato who, outside the sacred books of our religion, 
and a few works characteristic of the Middle Ages, is 
the grand storehouse of human ideas. It is he who has 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  158 PATTERNS 
given to the world the very term ‘idea.’ And it is 
ideas that our students chiefly lack. The eager student 
of that subject in the curriculum to which we apply 
the misnomer of ‘English’ should examine the myth 
of the soul in the Ph@drus, where the pattern is dis- 
tinct, before he comes to the myth of the soul in Shel- 
ley’s ode To a Skylark, where the pattern is vague and 
disordered. Let him become acquainted with Plato- 
nism clear and pure at its source, before he takes up the 
insecure—one may almost say, muddled—Platonism of 
Wordsworth’s Ode, Intimations of Immortality from 
Recollections of early Childhood, 
General culture means the possession of distinct and 
important ideas, and the organization of these ideas 
into an orderly whole. It depends upon the ability to 
comprehend structure, and the habit of seeing patterns 
objectively with the mind’s eye. But this eye of the 
mind is not quite like an eye; it is more like an inner 
retina or network of lines and filaments. To go back 
to the image with which we began, it is a kind of reticu- 
lated orb like the web of our spider. We desire our 
student to possess a mind like the fabric hanging be- 
tween the fern and the laurel in Bartram’s Garden, 
with main lines of support and communication radi- 
ating from the centre in all directions outward, with 
sympathetic cross-communications in every part, and 
with a subtle, active intelligence at the hub of the 
wheel. Structure within the mind is developed by the 
contemplation of structure without. No other single 
means will so quickly and effectually reproduce an 
organized mind in our American undergraduate as the
-P-A-G-E-169
PLATONIC PATTERNS 159 
study of Plato. The statement is made upon the basis 
of repeated experiment with individuals of this genus 
—with the American undergraduate as he is, and not 
as our present uncorrelated curriculum of liberal 
studies assumes him to be. 
He has no prepossessions about Plato, no prejudice 
against Plato as against the word ‘Greek,’ or antiquity 
in general; and Plato instantly captivates him, and 
will transform him while yet there is hope. Nay more. 
Many a young teacher can be revivified by dancing out 
a mental fight or figure with Plato—in the Theetetus, 
or the Philebus. And it is perhaps never too late for 
any one to learn that he can teach his pupils more if, 
instead of haranguing them in lectures, he will enter 
into Socratic conversations with them about the sub- 
ject he and they may have in hand.

If the criticism of Shelley be thought severe, the 
reader should note again precisely what is said, and 
what is not said, of the poet. For example, I care- 
fully avoid saying: Do not read Shelley. The in- 
junction is: Read Plato first—a bit of advice de- 
rived from the habit, opinion, and counsel of Shelley 
himself. Does it seem ungracious to expose the 
weakness of the ode To a Skylark, and the inadvert- 
ence of those who deem it excellent without rigor- 
ously testing the whole by the standards of good 
sense and good technique? Of the inadvertent, those 
who are open to conviction may consult the analy- 
sis of the ode by Professor John M. Robertson ;*

or they may deal with the ode as Socrates, in the 
Phedrus, deals with the oration of Lysias, thus: It 
presents an untruth in the first place—

Bird thou never wert. 
‘Then as to the other topics—are they not thrown 
down anyhow? Is there any principle in them? 
Why should the next topie follow next in order, or

into his head!’ + 
Would the entire university curriculum be dis- 
rupted if we were to introduce the study of Plato 
in the wholesale fashion suggested? But the sugges- 
tion mainly concerns the work in English so-called. 
And here it is already possible to read almost any- 
thing; the teacher now has virtually complete free- 
dom of choice. Meanwhile, among the various trends 
in ‘English’ there is at present a distinct tendency 
in favor of reading more and more of the ancient 
classics in translation; in the next few years we 
are likely to see a kind of renaissance of classical 
study in this guise. But it would seem wise to direct 
the tendency according to sober principles, and 
neither to let our enthusiasms run away with us, 
nor yet merely to drift with the educational tide. 
Just now the most favored translator with teachers 
of English is Professor Gilbert Murray, and hence 
the most familiar Attic author is Euripides. Mur-

ray’s Euripides is better food for our young people 
than most of the texts in the list of the College En- 
trance Board for English. But Jowett’s Plato (per- 
haps with the translation of the Republic by Davies 
and Vaughan) is better yet. 
In other departments, of course, there has been a 
similar tendency. Since few of the students who 
elect philosophy have ever studied Greek, the pro- 
fessor of philosophy expects his class to read the 
Republic in the version of Davies and Vaughan; and 
the professor of political theory is likely to do the 
same. First and last, a goodly number of their col- 
leagues will require one and another group of stu- 
dents to read more or less of Plato. To tell the truth, 
if the present had not seemed to be a fair opportu- 
nity to strike a blow of a particular sort in favor of 
good sense and serious reading, I might have waited 
for a better time.

HIS strange and pregnant utterance has a 
deeper meaning for the religious imagina- 
tion; but for a secular purpose we may give it a 
secular interpretation, thus: the student of litera- 
ture who has digested the Republic of Plato is, as it 
were, a man of unlimited resources, possessing a 
store of ideas upon which he can always draw for 
the ends of life. As a collateral text one may cite 
the advice which the father of Robert, Earl Lytton,

Read old books. Do you want to find old ideas? 
Read new ones.’ ?

  IDEAS ARE NEITHER NEW NOR OLD = 163 
A teacher of the modern subject of English, while 
doubtless to be regarded as an exponent of things 
new, on occasion must glance at the interests of those 
who in the general mind pass for teachers of things 
old and permanent—that is, of the ancient classics; 
or at all events must try to discover what there is of 
common interest to both ancients and moderns. Yet 
the instructed scribe of either sort will straightway 
admit that the familiar distinction between ‘old’ 
and ‘new’ ordinarily has no scientific value, and as 
a rule serves only to darken counsel. The ‘new’ 
school of Dr. Flexner, for example, is not merely as 
old as the Emile of Rousseau; it is as old, though 
not so fresh and good, as the philosophy of Epicurus. 
And the ‘new religion’ of President Eliot was act- 
ually described more than half a century in advance 
by Renan in his essay on Channing;? in fact, being 
as old as Stoicism, it is not so new as the New Testa- 
ment. Accordingly, both ancients and moderns will 
readily grant that the groundwork of a sound 
general, and even a religious, education consists, not 
of things old as such, or of things new as such, but 
of things that are at once both new and old. In 
other words they will agree that a general educa- 
tion consists in the assimilation of a stock or fund of 
ideas which are by nature imperishable; of ideas 
which are the potential inheritance of every intelli-

gent human being. They are the specific property 
of no one man or age. They may be acquired by any 
man or nation through select and industrious read- 
ing within the space of forty years or less, if I under- 
stand the late Sir William Osler, though Aristotle 
would seem to suggest forty-nine years as the cor- 
rect figure, and Plato fifty. They may all be met 
and recognized before the age of thirty, to judge 
from the five years spent by Milton after he left 
Cambridge, at Horton, and the eight years of read- 
ing done by Swift after an unsatisfactory career as 
a student at Dublin. Moreover, one man differs 
from another, one period differs from another, in 
the way each man or period reacts to the common 
fund of human ideas. Thus a man or an age may 
possess more or fewer of these ideas, may possess 
some number of them more or less distinctly, and 
may possess them in more free or more restricted 
combination. Novel combination of old ideas is some- 
times said to be the mark of genius in a Shakespeare 
or a Goethe; yet it is clear that wealth of ideas is 
also a characteristic of originality, as in Plato; and 
even more characteristic is the habit of sharply dis- 
tinguishing between one idea and another, and of 
seeing the sum-total of ideas in order and due per- 
spective. 
This last quality is characteristic of the New Testa- 
ment, where we learn that, if we seek first the most 
important things, or ideas, the others will be added 
to us—on the principle that to him that hath shall 
be given. And it is a characteristic of the literary
-P-A-G-E-175
  
WHERE TO FIND IDEAS 165 
tradition that culminates in Dante, who sifts and 
unites the gains of the classical and the medieval 
spirit, and whose Vita Nuova and Divina Commedia 
as a result are strictly the most original productions 
in literature outside the Scriptures. But it is also 
a characteristic of Plato. 
Wealth of ideas, distinctness of ideas, perspective 
and emphasis in combining them, these, we may say, 
are the end and aim of a general or humane educa- 
tion, at least on the intellectual side. If we admit 
this—and who will deny it?—the main question for 
the educator, the instructed scribe, then becomes: 
What are the most effectual means of transmitting 
the largest number of clear and important human 
ideas in the best perspective? Yet there is another 
question, or perhaps another form of the same ques- 
tion, which takes precedence of this one, namely: 
Where are the fullest and most accessible treasuries 
from which the prudent scribe or householder may 
enrich his son or disciple? We have here in mind, 
of course, what is termed a literary education, rather 
than a mathematical or scientific one, and elemental 
thoughts, rather than their applications and modifi- 
cations; and the treasuries we immediately consider 
are books—works proceeding from antiquity, or from 
the Middle Ages, or from the Renaissance and mod- 
ern times. Indeed, under the Renaissance we must 
include everything from the end of the Middle Ages 
down to the present time; for we are still living in 
the Renaissance—or were until August, 1914. Since 
then, perhaps, for better as well as worse, for better 
12
-P-A-G-E-176
166 THINGS NEW AND OLD 
rather than worse, we have been returning to the 
ideals of the Middle Ages. 
We shall at any rate do wisely if we look for ideas 
in the place where we are certain to find them. 
Thus it might not be wise to look for them in the 
books of the last ten years, or in all the books of any 
particular ten years in history, where much chaff 
necessarily hides but little wheat. And again, it 
may not be wise for the general student to trust to 
the sources from which a particular man of great 
ideas extracted his special fund. The books em- 
ployed by a Bunyan or a Lincoln are likely to in- 
clude certain volumes of perennial worth; and his 
choice of teachers is always instructive. But the 
genius of Lincoln, feeding in the main upon a few 
significant books, was otherwise able to assimilate 
clarified ideas from sources that might furnish in- 
different nourishment to the mind of the average 
man. In any case, we must discover our fund of 
ideas somewhere in the past, whether the near past 
or the more remote. We cannot find them in the pres- 
ent, since we can study the present only when it has 
gone by and become a part of human experience. 
As for the future, in which the young people of IIli- 
nois and Kansas—and even of the State of New 
York—expect to meet new ideas that have not been 
expressed in old books like the ancient classics, it 
may be doubted whether we shall shortly be favored 
with a Plato or a Dante from those parts. It is the 
simple truth that the source of virtually all the hu- 
man ideas thus far developed has been one or an-
-P-A-G-E-177
ESCAPE FROM THE RENAISSANCE 167 
other part of the civilization that grew up on or 
near the shores of the Mediterranean. We may even 
affirm that, however amplified or varied the applica- 
tion of the common stock of ideas has been in the 
Renaissance, the additions to that stock since the 
time of Dante are well-nigh negligible. The main 
development since that time has been of the means 
of communication and of diffusion—the printing- 
press, the telegraph and telephone, and various forms 
of artificial locomotion; there has not been a signifi- 
cant increase in the number or importance of the 
things to be communicated; nor is ‘diffusion’ always 
to be taken in a favorable sense. One may read an 
entire newspaper in the Sunday edition, or an en- 
tire number of a current magazine, without finding 
a single idea of permanent value, well expressed. 
We may therefore raise an objection to the com- 
mon practice, exemplified in the curriculum of every 
Protestant school and college, of making a literary 
training chiefly consist in the persual of authors be- 
longing to and typical of the Renaissance. Besides 
the reasons I have suggested for this objection, others 
may be adduced. For example, since our pupils are 
living in the Renaissance, they do not escape from 
themselves through reading these authors; the indi- 
vidual student tends rather to stereotype the ideas 
which already govern him. Again, the casual read- 
ing of the crowd is naturally confined to this period; 
but education should supply deficiencies, not merely 
encourage desires that will satisfy themselves, once 
the intellectual curiosity of the individual has been  
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 THINGS NEW AND OLD 
awakened. The notion I wish to convey will be 
clearer if we turn to a matter of common observa- 
tion, which is this: the reading of Renaissance au- 
thors does not necessarily lead one to the reading of 
medieval and classical masterpieces. Thus the man 
who has read Milton may not have read Dante, and 
the man who has read Shakespeare may not have 
read Sophocles; but one will hardly find a student 
of Sophocles who has not read Shakespeare, or a 
student of Dante who has not read Milton. Yet 
again, the more difficult part of education is the ac- 
quisition of self-restraint, and the less difficult, the 
development of one’s natural bent. But the typical 
author of the Renaissance and modern times—a 
Montaigne, a Goethe, a Rousseau—glorifies individu- 
alism, self-assertion, self-expression, self-develop- 
ment; whereas the classical and medieval authors 
inculeate self-restraint and self-denial. Finally, 
what we call bad taste would almost seem to be the 
invention of the Renaissance and a special property 
of modern times. The literature of the Middle Ages 
is on occasion tedious; and the ancient classical au- 
thors are not without their faults of style and de- 
ficiencies of spirit. But bad taste as we know it in 
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is not to be 
detected in Plato, or in classical literature as a whole, 
or in Dante, any more than it is to be found in the 
New Testament. Were we to subordinate Renais- 
sance to ancient and medieval writers in the cur- 
riculum, we should tend to secure the pupil in his 
formative stage from the contamination of bad taste. 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  
PLATO AND DANTE 169 
Yielding to none in my love of what is best in Shake- 
speare and Milton, I am not, of course, aiming at a 
wholesale condemnation of Renaissance authors, or 
asserting that they should be uncritically excluded 
from a rational scheme of studies. 
But the superiority of Dante and Plato to any 
writer of modern times cannot be denied, when we 
consider each as a grand repository of human ideas. 
Outside the Sacred Scriptures, these two authors are 
in this respect incomparable, surpassing the greater 
or lesser among the encyclopedic minds whose works 
have been the sources of supply for many a literary 
reputation—such works, I mean, as those of Cicero, 
Plutarch, Montaigne, Bacon, Leibnitz, Goethe, or 
Sainte-Beuve. Serviceable as Plutarch has been to 
a Shakespeare, Montaigne to an Emerson, or Sainte- 
Beuve to a generation of literary critics, or as De 
Quincey has been to a Ruskin, or Ruskin to many a 
recent English writer, not one of them will replace 
Dante or Plato as a treasury of ideas. Taken to- 
gether, these two, Plato and Dante, virtually sum 
up, compactly, the germinal notions which are pos- 
sible to human kind. 
Yet they have more than wealth and compactness 
to recommend them. They have also distinctness 
and perspective or proportion. And these two quali- 
ties of distinctness and perspective suggest that the 
two authors are not merely individual, but also 
representative. What do they represent? 
It would seem that they represent two out of the 
three greatest literary traditions of all time, in which  
-P-A-G-E-180
  170 THINGS NEW AND OLD 
the wealth and importance of the ideas to be trans- 
mitted have been equaled by excellence in the man- 
ner of their conveyance. Chief among the three is 
the tradition of the Old and the New Testament; 
but this does not enter into the present discussion ; 
though pervasive in its influence upon all subse- 
quent European literature, it has its own special 
relation to the secular curriculum, being swi generis, 
and a thing apart—in the world, but not of it. Of 
the other two, one is manifestly the Greco-Roman 
tradition, beginning with Homer, and culminating 
in the Attic drama and Plato, yet living on in later 
Greek poetry and in the poets of Rome. The other 
begins in the tenth century with the troubadours 
of southern France, culminates in Dante, and lives 
on in Petrarch. For each of the two, the distinc- 
tive characteristic is perfection of artistic form 
developed through an unbroken succession of poets, 
each learning from his predecessors, striving to ad- 
vance beyond them, and generally successful in mak- 
ing old things new. Except for the Bible, as in the 
relation of the later to the earlier Psalms, no other 
literary tradition shows the same excellence arising 
from close continuity and straightforward progress. 
No such phenomenon can be observed, for example, 
in the literature of England, though there is some- 
thing like it in the progress of Old English poetry 
from Cedmon to the school of Cynewulf. But subse- 
quently, in their mastery of poetic form, the two 
leaders, Shakespeare and Milton, are, we may con- 
tend, aliens to England; for Shakespeare, with all
-P-A-G-E-181
  THREE LITERARY TRADITIONS 171 
his opulence, attains to artistic perfection, not in his 
dramas, but in some of his sonnets, which are ulti- 
mately Petrarchan; and the artistic mastery of Mil- 
ton comes not through an orderly development of 
English literature; from a distance, and after an 
interval, he strives to combine in one the streams of 
Mediterranean tradition. He does not, like Dante, 
or like Plato, live at home in his own native stream 
of ideas and art. But he could not have done better, 
and his practice indicates what we should do toward 
improving the ideals of a literary education: study 
the Bible—that goes without saying; and otherwise 
betake ourselves to the schools of Plato and Dante. 
It was to these that Shelley betook himself (until 
then a very mediocre poet), thereby enriching his 
substance, and greatly improving his art. 
This is as much as may now be suggested regarding 
storehouses of ideas—where to hunt for treasures. Let 
us briefly consider the other question—how to transmit 
the fund of ideas to the next and succeeding genera- 
tions. I have elsewhere? discussed the medieval tradi- 
tion which the best of modern scholars are engaged in 
winnowing for the future; to the student of English a 
study of Germanic and Italian or Romance origins is 
of more immediate concern than the study of Greek 
and Latin. Yet classical studies are of vital interest 
to the teachers of modern literature; when these 
studies fail, we cannot succeed. Nor could there be a 
more splendid testimony to the significance of classical 
scholarship in modern life than the body of recent 
1See below, pp. 199-200, 262-6, 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 THINGS NEW AND OLD 
French monographs upon English authors; for they all 
derive their method and inspiration from the work of 
French classical scholars like Gaston Boissier and 
Alfred and Maurice Croiset. In America, however, it 
would seem that our teachers of Greek and Latin have 
not in recent years been so directly helpful to students 
of English. Indeed, if I may speak for myself, I have 
had to learn the most needful things in the domain o* 
classical studies either from teachers of English or by 
myself—such needful things, that is, as the Poetics of 
Aristotle and the Encyklopidie of August Boeckh, 
which metamorphose and energize one’s conceptions of 
literary and linguistic study. Why, we may ask, do 
American classical scholars, in contrast with those of 
France, make so little use of these books in their teach- 
ing—above all, in the training of teachers for the sec- 
ondary schools? Or, to approach the problem from 
another angle, why should a bright young woman from 
tha Middle West, one who had read Cesar and Xeno- 
phon, be filled with astonishment, after reading a little 
of Jowett’s Plato for a course in English, that no one 
had ever before directed her to this magical source of 
ideas? Why, thought she, was I robbed of my birth- 
right? The fault must lie partly in the general state 
of education in America; it also lies in part with our 
teachers of the classics. I hope they will bear with me 
if I complain a little and advise a little on this subject. 
Faithful are the wounds of a friend. 
We teachers of modern literature—of Shakespeare, 
for example—have just cause for complaint that our 
pupils have read Cesar, and are not familiar with
-P-A-G-E-183
  MORE HELP FROM THE CLASSICS 173 
Ovid ; since perhaps the main difficulty in the allusions 
of Shakespeare, and even of Milton, has ceased to exist 
for a student who has read portions of the Metamor- 
phoses. Again, if our Sophomores are so lucky as to 
have read: a little Greek, it has been Xenophon rather 
than Plato; and hence they cannot understand Shelley. 
But, strictly speaking, and not to mention Greek, they 
cannot read Latin at all, one reason being that their 
teachers in the secondary schools cannot do so either. 
These teachers, naturally, cannot transmit a habit that 
they do not possess, and will never inspire a class with 
the faith that it can do what is not done. But why 
should not a teacher of the classics in the high school 
read classical authors wholesale, as his or her colleague 
in French or German reads authors in either of these 
tongues? Sympathize though we may with the diffi- 
culties under which classical teachers labor in this 
country, it is the simple truth that, with nearly all the 
best cards—the most fascinating authors—in their 
hands, they have not known how to play the game. 
They continue to assign the reading of the Gallic War, 
and: the orations against Catiline, which vitally inter- 
est but a few boys, and almost no girls, and they with- 
hold Ovid, who would interest all. And they insist 
upon Xenophon, who, if not always prosy, is yet as 
prosy as a Greek can be.t_ And why do they insist? 
*I do not wish to imply that Cesar, or Cicero, or Xenophon, is 
uninteresting when approached in the right way; but it is unde- 
niable that the rank and file of teachers make them so; whereas 
it is not so easy for a bad teacher to spoil the Auneid or the 
Odyssey. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  174 THINGS NEW AND OLD 
Because, forsooth, he writes Attic Greek that is not too 
hard! Meanwhile these pupils are bereft of the 
natural pleasure and stimulus which come from the 
habit of continuous reading; though if you make the 
Greek or Latin easy enough, and interesting enough, it 
is as possible to acquire the habit for either of these 
as for French or German. You must, of course, have 
teachers who can and do read books and authors in the 
languages they profess to teach. But you must also 
see to it that, with some intensive study for the sake 
of grammar and syntax, there goes much extensive 
reading on the part of the class. Let us not be afraid 
of the methods of those who teach the modern lan- 
guages. It is better also to read one book of the Odys- 
sey in the original, and the rest in the translation of 
Butcher and Lang, than two books of the original and 
nothing more. 
I sing of things old and new. For years we have 
been facing changed’ conditions in teaching Greek and 
Latin ; and the present, they say, is a critical time for 
Greek. The classical teachers appear to realize that 
they are in a predicament; but what have they done, 
what are they doing, about it? Very likely more than 
I have heard, of, but surely not enough; for more is 
needed than a general campaign of advertising to 
awaken a heedless public, more than eloquent replies 
to Dr. Flexner and his school, more than Latin exhibi- 
tions in the halls of public buildings. I am far from 
underrating the value of such efforts, or the admirable 
spirit of those persons who make them. More impor- 
ant, however, are the results attained in certain text-
-P-A-G-E-185
  NEW BOOKS FOR GREEK AND LATIN 175 
books like Professor Goodell’s The Greek in English, 
The First Year of Greek by Professor Allen, and the 
Latin readers projected by Professor Clark and his 
coadjutor, Mr. Game. But all these enterprises, so far 
as they are known to me, are in certain ways too much 
of a concession, and in certain ways too little. With 
all deference to scholars who know far more of Greek 
and Latin than I can ever hope to know, let me never- 
theless as a teacher of English assume that we need a 
new Greek Lesson-book and Reader, say a volume of 
six or seven hundred pages, and a similar volume for 
beginning Latin. The principles governing these 
books I trust we should all agree to. The details should 
be worked out by experts, though in each case, per- 
haps, under the guidance of a single editor; what I 
say of these details must be regarded as mainly tenta- 
tive or rather suggestive, and in no sense final and 
complete. In the volume for Latin there should be, 
first of all, such minimum of grammar and syntax as 
is indispensable for any progress at all in reading. 
But it must be strictly a minimum. We must, for our 
beginners, have less grammar at the outset, though 
what is given will have to be thoroughly mastered in 
a few weeks, with constant reference back and forth 
from numbered point in the text to numbered point 
in the grammar. But it must always be remembered 
that the main difficulty is not grammar or syntax, but 
vocabulary ; this is true of all languages, it is true of 
Greek and Latin. Much grammar should be reserved 
until later in the first year, some until the following 
year, and some until after the Day of Judgment. For 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
176 THINGS NEW AND OLD 
the rest, there should be several hundred pages of easy, 
interesting, and as far ay possible connected reading ; 
and reading should begin at the second meeting of the 
class. Among the earlier passages in the book there 
should be some for memorizing; here the Latin should 
of course be pure, but the order as near as possible to 
that of English ; these should be accompanied by close 
and exact translations into natural English, the trans- 
lations also to be memorized. It is astonishing how 
much of a foreign language can be quickly learned by 
this means, and how many important grammatical and 
syntactical forms can thus be acquired in advance of 
the learning of paradigms. Meanwhile the teacher has 
texts of reference for points of usage, not vaguely 
placed somewhere in a book, but clearly written in the 
mind of his pupil. In the first fifty or one hundred 
pages there should be a great deal of narrative adapted 
from the more familiar parts of the Bible in the 
Vulgate; additions might be made from apocryphal 
accounts of the childhood of Christ, in Latin, of course. 
I know of nothing which the average student reads 
with more avidity. But the book as a whole should 
contain mostly narrative, drawn from Ovid, Virgil, 
and such things as the Dream of Scipio. Surely this 
last is more attractive to the youthful mind than are 
the orations against Catiline; as indeed it might be 
well to throw over all the orations of Cicero in favor 
of his letters, if our aim is to enlist the interest of the 
pupil on the side of his own education. There would 
be no objection to observing the principle of pro- 
gressive difficulty, as we advanced toward the end of
-P-A-G-E-187
  A NEW LATIN READER 177 
the book; but the main principle should be: Lesen; 
viel lesen; viel, viel lesen. In fact, difficult passages 
should for the most part be simplified by the editor; 
glosses and side-notes, even interlinear translations, 
should be supplied where difficulties cannot be avoided 
or excised, and summaries of omitted intervening 
passages should be given in English; the editor and 
his helpers should virtually rewrite a large part of the 
Latin in the volume. The book might thus include the 
whole story of the Auneid, which is criminally treated 
when but the first half or third is read without refer- 
ence to the end. If it be necessary to rewrite Virgil, 
using his own words where possible, and. to print the 
paraphrase as normal Latin prose, by all meang let 
Virgil be rewritten. This would not preclude the occa- 
sional insertion of metrical excerpts, or the learning 
of them with the help of a teacher who knew the music 
of the Virgilian lines. If the Latin of the Vulgate, or 
if other medieval Latin, be not pure enough for the 
purists, let the editor improve it, so long as he does not 
make the order more difficult. But as I have sug- 
gested, much editorial effort should be devoted to re- 
ducing the Latin, wherever possible, to the order of the 
modern languages—which happens to be the order of 
Greek also. Finally there should be a full glossary. I 
have said nothing of written composition; exercises 
night, or might not, be included in the same volume. 
There is no reason why several books should not be 
employed in a course. Were I teaching Latin, I should 
expect my students to read a certain amount of Latin 
literature in the first year in the best English transla-
-P-A-G-E-188
  178 THINGS NEW AND OLD 
tions. And the same thing would be true were I teach- 
ing Greek. 
For the Greek Grammar and Reader, all in one, a 
similar procedure should be followed. The selections 
should be made into continuous reading. Passages of 
significant and connected discourse should be memor- 
ized with their English translations. Homer and 
Herodotus should be freely excerpted and adapted, 
virtually Atticized perhaps, the chief difficulties being 
removed or glossed. Many inflected forms should be 
recognized as individual words before they are seen in 
the artificial order of the paradigms. I, for one, should 
omit the Anabasis of Xenophon altogether, whatever 
the injury to existent text-books and current royalties. 
Certain easier passages from Plato should be included ; 
some of the more significant myths, with the difficul- 
ties removed or glossed; perhaps one or two of the 
shorter, less abstruse dialogues, with an argument at 
the beginning of each, and occasional summaries, in 
English. As in the Latin Reader, narrative portions 
of the Bible should come near the beginning, with 
occasional rewriting or rewording of the Old Testa- 
ment in the Septuagint and of the New Testament. 
Here, again, the apocryphal accounts of the childhood 
of Christ might be used to great advantage. And as 
some of the simpler Latin hymns might be included 
in the Latin Reader, so, perhaps, certain of the simpler 
Greek hymns here. And again there should be a full 
Greek and English glossary. 
Do these proposals seem unduly novel? They could 
hardly be so strange as the chance that, out of all the
-P-A-G-E-189
  
HOW ANDREW LANG BEGAN GREEK 179 
possible combinations of authors in the rich and varied 
literature of antiquity, has made Cesar and Xenophon 
mean ‘classical’ to a large part of young America; or 
the chance that upon these two as foundation should 
be reared the entire structure of a classical course— 
should be determined the order and nature of the 
texts, the apparatus, the method of teaching. These 
proposals are not more strange than the inability of 
most classical teachers to stand aside and look at them- 
selves and their work ab extra. They would not seem 
strange to Andrew Lang. Since formulating them, I 
have consulted his paper on Homer and the Study of 
Greek, which sustains with force and skill the main 
positions I have been upholding. I quote a passage 
from one who did much to vivify our times through 
the vital things of the past. To what he says of gram- 
mar nearly every one will hear an echo from within. 
And what he says of Homer is mostly applicable to 
Plato as well: 
‘At present boys are introduced to the language 
of the Muses by pedantically written grammars, full 
of the queerest and most arid metaphysical and philo- 
logical verbiage. The very English in which these 
deplorable books are composed may be scientific, may 
be comprehensible by and useful to philologists, but 
is utterly heartbreaking to boys... . The grammar, 
to them, is a mere buzz in a chaos of nonsense... . 
When they struggle so far as to be allowed to try 
to read a piece of Greek prose, they are only like the 
Marchioness in her experience of beer; she once had 
a sip of it. Ten lines of Xenophon, narrating how 
he marched so many parasangs and took breakfast, 
do not amount to more than a very unrefreshing sip  
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 THINGS NEW AND OLD 
of Greek. .. . The boys straggle along with Xeno- 
phon, knowing not whence or whither. . . . One by 
one they fall out of the ranks; they mutiny against 
Xenophon; they murmur against that commander; 
they desert his flag. They determine that anything 
is better than Greek, that nothing can be worse than 
Greek, and they move the tender hearts of their 
parents... . Up to a certain age my experiences at 
school were precisely those which I have described. 
Our grammar was not so philological, abstruse, and 
arid as the instruments of torture employed at pres- 
ent. But I hated Greek with a deadly and sickening 
hatred; I hated it like a bully and a thief of time. 
. .. Then we began to read Homer; and from the 
very first words, in which the Muse is asked to sing 
the wrath of Achilles, Peleus’ son, my mind was 
altered, and I was the devoted friend of Greek. Here 
was something worth reading about; here one knew 
where one was; here was the music of words, here 
were poetry, pleasure, and life. We fortunately had 
a teacher (Dr. Hodson) who was not wildly enthusi- 
astic about grammar. He would set us long pieces 
of the Iliad or Odyssey to learn, and, when the day’s 
task was done, would make us read on, adventuring 
ourselves in ‘‘the unseen,’’ and construing as gal- 
lantly as we might, without grammar or dictionary. 
On the following day we surveyed more carefully 
the ground we had pioneered or skirmished over, 
and then advanced again. Thus, to change the 
metaphor, we took Homer in large draughts, not in 
sips: in sips no epie can be enjoyed. . . . The result 
was not the making of many accurate scholars, 
though a few were made; others got nothing better 
than enjoyment in their work, and the firm belief, 
opposed to that of most schoolboys, that the ancients 
did not write nonsense. ... Judging from this ex- 
ample, I venture very humbly to think that any one 
who, even at the age of Cato, wants to learn Greek, 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  MAKING ALL THINGS NEW 181 
should begin where Greek literature, where all pro- 
fane literature begins—with Homer himself. It was 
thus, not with grammars im vacuo, that the great 
scholars of the Renaissance began. It was thus that 
Ascham and Rabelais began, by jumping into Greek 
and splashing about till they learned to swim.’ + 
This stimulating author then proceeds to explain 
his method for actual beginners in Homer; but since 
his method is in keeping with the one just outlined 
for the projected books in Greek and Latin, there is 
no need of enlarging upon it. As will be readily 
seen, in both volumes one main principle is the 
governing conception: the business of education is 
the transmission of ideas. Language is to be re- 
garded first of all as a means of communication, and 
not as an end in itself. 
Finally we teachers of things new and old may 
bear in mind that we are in a world where reality is 
permanent, and its appearance constantly changing. 
We must therefore be inflexible where reality is 
concerned, and flexible when change becomes neces- 
sary; for we may properly regard ourselves as co- 
workers with One who saith: ‘Behold, I make all 
things new.’

THE FUNCTION OF THE LEADER 
IN SCHOLARSHIP* 
O the restless citizens of our vast American 
Ec commonwealth, the precise service which the 
scholar renders to the State is by no means evident. 
In time of peace, a democracy is more apt to insist 
upon the rights which all men are said to possess in 
common than to care about the duties which the 
highly gifted and specially trained may be thought 
to owe to the social organism as a whole. 
In the ancient culture which grew up about the 
eastern half of the Mediterranean, and from which 
the best impulses of modern civilization—nay even 
of modern democracy—have chiefly sprung, a dif- 
ferent ideal held sway. To the representative think- 
ers of antiquity, special gifts and special training 
appeared, one may say, in an undemocratic guise, 
the emphasis being less upon the rights and claims 
of the individual, and more upon his higher or lower 
office as a member of the body politic. A similar 
readiness to subject the interests of the part to the 
welfare of the whole may be observed in the Middle 
Ages, that is, in the period in which our modern na-

THE STATE AS AN ORGANISM 183 
tions and vernacular literatures took their immediate 
rise. The very existence of feudalism, and the funda- 
mental activities of the medieval Church, alike in- 
volved the principle of spontaneous subordination, 
and made comprehensible the idea of a specific disci- 
pline fitting the choicest of the youth of each gener- 
ation for a type of willing service which amounted 
to spiritual leadership in the State. That this idea 
actually was familiar to the ancients is sufficiently 
clear to any one who has dipped into Plato or Quin- 
tilian; and that it persisted after the Middle Ages 
to the time of Milton, if not later, may be gathered by 
all who care to examine his cogent tractate Of Edu- 
cation. Yet the traditional human belief in the spe- 
cial obligations of special classes to the commonwealth 
may be more satisfactorily illustrated than by ab- 
stract treatises; and, in particular, we Americans 
need to have brought home to us the idea of a defi- 
nite kind of person, who, though in the fullest sense 
a member of the social organism, and actuated by 
an unusual concern for its welfare, is yet a free and 
relatively spontaneous agent—like the eye in the 
head—one whose special business is to spy out and 
watch over those eternal forms of human thought 
and feeling, of truth and beauty, in which the real 
life of every nation is manifested, and which the con- 
serving spirit of scholarship hands on from age to 
age. 
For a better grasp of the relation between the in- 
dividual and the State we may turn to a figure of 
speech. There are, indeed, not a few recurring
-P-A-G-E-194
  
  184 THE LEADER IN SCHOLARSHIP 
similes, or literary comparisons, which seem rather 
to bear the stamp of a universal human imagination 
than to be the work of any particular genius, and to 
have a greater validity for our thinking (as they 
have had a greater vitality) than any scientific or 
philosophical abstractions. Such is the comparison 
of the State to a ship, with all her tackling perfect, 
and every mariner, from the steersman to the look- 
out, performing his office, however great or humble, 
as needful to the majestic progress of the whole. 
‘What an appeal to the human mind has this figure 
not made, from Sophocles to Horace, and from Long- 
fellow to Kipling! But of a greater vitality yet is 
the comparison of the State to a living organism. 
It is imbedded in our very word ‘corporation,’ and 
in the phrase ‘the body politic.’ In Plato, as a poem 
or any other work of art is likened in its form and 
function to a living creature, ‘having a body of its 
own and a head and feet—there should be a middle, 
beginning, and end, adapted to one another and to 
the whole,’*—so the commonwealth, which is also 
considered a work of conscious art, is regarded as a 
being possessed of organic life. Thus, in the Apol- 
ogy, Socrates, the industrious man of leisure—the 
scholar, as we might say,—speaks of the city of 
Athens as ‘a great and noble steed who is tardy in 
his motions owing to his very size, and requires to 
be stirred into life’; and of himself as a dedicated 
agent sent to arouse this animal to its proper activ-

ity, which is the contemplation of truth and beauty 
and justice. ‘I am that gadfly,’ he says, ‘which God 
has attached to the State, and all day long and in 
all places am always fastening upon you, arousing 
and persuading and reproaching you.’+ Moreover, 
he adds that, from the very nature of his calling, it 
has been necessary for him to occupy a private sta- 
tion, and not a public one, and to deal with the citi- 
zens in smaller groups, or as individuals. 
Doubtless most of us are acquainted with this 
comparison of organized society to a living creature, 
not in Hobbes’ Leviathan, or in Livy or Dionysius, 
but in the first scene of Coriolanus, where Shake- 
speare’s fancy has played with the fable of the body 
and the members, already elaborated in Plutarch. 
We may slightly abbreviate the dialogue between 
Menenius Agrippa, senator and friend of Coriolanus, 
and the spokesman of the clamorous citizens who 
are suffering in the famine: 
Menentus. There was a time when all the body’s mem- 
bers 
Rebelled against the belly; thus accused it: 
That only like a gulf it did remain 
T’ the midst 0’ the body, idle and unactive, . 
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing 
Like labor with the rest, where the other instruments 
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel, 
And, mutually participate, did minister 
Unto the appetite and affection common 
Of the whole body... . 
With a kind of smile,

Which ne’er came from the lungs, but even thus— 
For, look you, I may make the belly smile 
As well as speak—it tauntingly replied ... 
First Orrmen. Your belly’s answer? What! 
The kingly crownéd head, the vigilant eye, 
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier, 
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter, 
With other muniments and petty helps 
In this our fabric, if that they ... 
Should by the cormorant belly be restrained, 
Who is the sink 0’ the body . . . 
What could the belly answer? .. . 
MeEneENtvs. Note me this, good friend; 
Your most grave belly was deliberate, 
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered: 
‘True is it, my incorporate friends,’ quoth he, 
‘That I receive the general food at first, 
Which you do live upon; and fit it is; 
Because I am the store-house and the shop 
Of the whole body: but if you do remember, 
I send it through the rivers of your blood, 
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o’ the brain; 
And, through the cranks and offices of man, 
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins 
From me receive that natural competency 
Whereby they live”... 
The senators of Rome are this good belly, 
And you the mutinous members... . 
What do you think, 
You, the great toe of this assembly ?+ 
It has been said that Saint Paul had the same 
original story in mind when he wrote of another sort 
1 Coriolanus 1, 1, 95-156.
-P-A-G-E-197
  
THE BODY AND THE MEMBERS 187 
of political economy, and a higher kind of distribu- 
tion: i 
‘Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would 
not have you ignorant. . . . Now there are diversities 
of gifts, but the same Spirit. ... For the body is 
not one member, but many. . . . If the whole body 
were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole 
were hearing, where were the smelling? ... But 
now are they many members, yet but one body. And 
the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of 
thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need 
of you... . And whether one member suffer, all the 
members suffer with it... . Now ye are the body of 
Christ, and members in particular. . . . Are all apos- 
tles? are all prophets? are all teachers? ... But 
covet earnestly the best gifts.’+ 
Saint Paul’s application of the fable is doubtless 
the most familiar case of all; possibly there is no 
instance in literature of a figure which has taken a 
more vital hold upon the imagination of mankind. 
Yet, so far as I am aware, the notion of corporate 
service as expressed in the organic comparison has 
never been so frequently employed as toward the end 
of the Middle Ages by certain political theorists, 
who enlarged upon it with an ingenuity almost more 
than Shakespearean. To take an example from John 
of Salisbury, who is typical: 
‘The servants of Religion are the Soul of the Body, 
and therefore have principatum totius corporis; the 
1T Cor. 12. Cf. Matt. 5. 29-30; and 6. 22-3: ‘ The light of 
the body is the eye. If, therefore, thine eye be single, thy whole 
body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole 
body shall be full of darkness, If, therefore, the light that is in 
thee be darkness, how great is that darkness.’
-P-A-G-E-198
  188 THE LEADER IN SCHOLARSHIP 
prince is the head, the senate the heart, the court 
the sides; officers and judges are the eyes, ears, and 
tongue; the executive officials are the unarmed, and 
the army is the armed hand; the financial depart- 
ment is belly and intestines; landfolk, handicrafts- 
men, and the like are the feet, so that the State 
exceeds the centipede numerositate pedum; the pro- 
tection of the folk is the shoeing; the distress of these 
feet is the State’s gout.’? 
An earlier writer says that the illustrious men of a 
community are quasi oculi.2, One might speculate how 
some later dramatist, fastening upon this novel con- 
eeit, would represent a mutiny in which the sinewy 
leg of athletic prowess and the trumpeting tongue of 
collegiate advertisement denied the paramount services 
rendered by the vigilant eye of pure scholarship. Or 
suppose that the belly of the State refused to nourish 
the optic nerve—where were the seeing ? 
I have dwelt at some length upon this notion, be- 
cause the truth which it envelops is not always real- 
ized at first glance, and because it must be realized 
before we can grasp the function of the leader of 
scholarship in the State, whose gifts we should earn- 
estly covet. Upon reflection, it seems to me that the 
scholar, properly considered, must be taken to repre- 
sent the eye of the State, and that the class to which 
he belongs must include all persons who are living the 
life of contemplation. In accordance with the mean- 
ing of the Greek term cxody (leisure), which reappears

-P-A-G-E-199
  CARE OF THE STATE’S EYES 189 
in our English words ‘school’ and ‘scholarship,’ the 
life of studious contemplation, which is the highest 
function of the body politic, is secured to the common- 
wealth by the release of the eminently gifted from the 
anxieties of the practical life, so that they may per- 
form the most important service of all with the utmost 
measure of efficiency. These are the persons who, as 
Plato suggests, ‘have never had the wit to be idle,’ yet 
have been ‘careless of what the many care for—wealth, 
and family interests, and military offices, and speak- 
ing in the assembly, and magistracies, and plots, and 
parties.’ That is the best-ordered state which makes 
the fullest provision for them, and renders them most 
free from paltry considerations. If they are forced to 
take anxious thought for the morrow, how shall they 
perform their duty toward the other classes in society ? 
They must be as free from care about their raiment 
as the lilies of the field. Where there is no leisure, 
there is no vision; and where there is no vision, the 
commonwealth languishes: the whole head is sick, and 
the whole heart faint. Shall the huge belly and intes- 
tines of Leviathan, I mean the enormous wealth of 
our nation, say to its eye, the scholar—for example, 
to the student of Greek or of medieval literature: We 
live to eat, we are a sink and a sewer, and have no need 
of you? 
And yet, whatever kind of smile our most grave men 
of wealth occasionally bestow upon pure scholarship, 
it cannot truthfully be said that we treat our scholars 
well in comparison with a great European nation like 
+ Apology. Dialogues, trans. by Jowett, 2. 129.
-P-A-G-E-200
190 THE LEADER IN SCHOLARSHIP 
France, or even a small one like Denmark. Hospitals 
for the ailing body; schools of applied science; even 
departments of pure science that stand in an obvious 
relation to what is called practical life; everything 
that concerns food, drink, shelter, and bodily health, 
and the means of rapid transportation, and the dis- 
ciplines which tend to multiply and distribute such 
blessings—for all these things our men of great out- 
ward fortune understand how to give generously. I 
am far from belittling such gifts. But they are not 
of the sort which our leaders in education should earn- 
estly covet, so long as the tide violently sets away from 
the theoretical life to the practical. Great engineers 
know how to control the tide when it comes rushing 
into their canals; but the children of this world are 
in their generation wiser than the children of light. 
It will be noticed that by implication the scholar has 
been set in a class with the philosopher, the painter, 
the poet, and all other men distinguished for their 
powers of vision, who see life steadily, and see it whole. 
Any failure to recognize the tie between the ideal 
student and the brotherhood of seers and artists would, 
indeed, be injurious to the entire fraternity of intel- 
lectual men. Nay more, I am persuaded that no vul- 
gar error of the belly and the big toe is so inimical to 
the arts of civilization as that by which scholarship 
is falsely identified with industrious pedantry, and 
poetic and philosophic insight with one or another 
sort of lazy mooning; as if the scholar and the poet 
were each endowed with his own kind of retina, and 
the impressions of the one were necessarily at variance
-P-A-G-E-201
  DEFECTIVE VISION 191 
with those of the other, as well as with the excellent 
vision of the man in the street. If this mistaken view 
is prevalent in America, and is shared by many who 
lay claim to refinement, we must grant that the eye 
of our nation is not single, and that the body of the 
commonwealth therefore cannot be full of light—or at 
least that our country is suffering from strabismus, 
without knowing that it is a serious visual defect. 
There is, of course, a blindness that will not see the 
relation between the best theory and the best practice, 
but this infirmity is not to be discovered in those ex- 
cellent men of business, Shakespeare and Goethe; or 
in the scholar-poets, Virgil, Dante, Chaucer, and Spen- 
ser; or in Milton, who took ‘intense labor and study’ 
to be his portion in this life. Nor was our own Profes- 
sor Longfellow thus afflicted. 
‘O thou poor authorling!’ he cries, ‘to cheer thy 
solitary labor, remember that the secret studies of an 
author are the sunken piers upon which is to rest 
the bridge of his fame, spanning the dark waters of 
oblivion. They are out of sight; but without them no 
superstructure can stand secure.’ + 
The truth is, as poets like Longfellow would admit, 
that we Americans are not over-friendly to secret 
studies and deep researches that concern the distant 
future rather than the passing moment; and doubtless 
we are too fond of calling ourselves a ‘practical’ folk, 
without considering what the expression may involve. 
By ‘practical’ do we mean anything more than physi- 
cally wide-awake and dexterous? Do we mean, for 
* Longfellow, Hyperion, Book 4, chap, 1.

        192 THE LEADER IN SCHOLARSHIP 
example, that, being less artistic than the Dutch, we 
are more successful than they in the planning of muni- 
cipal affairs? Who that knows will say so? And do 
we, with far-sighted patriotism, render to our national 
government exactly what is due to Cesar? Or do we 
render more, or less? Which of the alternatives is 
‘practical’? On the other hand, if we think it is the 
divine pur that any generation should eat, walk, 
build a house, pay taxes, and: go to the grave, without 
trying to realize the highest ideal of the human race, 
then we are a very unpractical folk indeed. Nor are 
we to be deemed crafty when we try to ease our con- 
sciences with an empty platitude. If this be simply 
an age of industrial growth—mere larding of the belly 
—and if, sooner or later, it must be followed by an 
age of spiritual reintegration and exalted national 
life, neither fate nor the many-headed multitude will 
bring about the change, but the eye of Providence 
gleaming in the visionary eye of the poet, priest, and 
and silver breed gold and silver, Shy- 
, as fast as ewes and rams; they do not 
breed spirit at all. And bulls and bears breed bulls     
    tical generation is that which, giving Cesar his due, 
still gives precedence to the higher or theoretic life, 
the life, not of the foot or belly, but of the head and 
eye. Speaking of the relation between theory and 
practice in Greek life, Professor Bosanquet asks: 
‘How is this glorification of theoria to be recon- 
ciled with what we take to be the needs of practi-
-P-A-G-E-203
  EFFECTUAL VISION 193 
cal life, and the necessity that education should pre- 
pare us for it? . . . Let us understand distinctly of 
what we are speaking. Theoria for a Greek is not 
what we mean by theory; and the theoretie life is 
not what we call a theoretical pursuit. Theory for 
us comes near to an intellectual fiction; a way of 
grasping and comprehending a complex of observa- 
tions. ... Theoretical considerations for us mean 
mostly what is abstract and hypothetical; ‘‘if this 
change, then that consequence.’’ Theoretic life for 
the Greek meant the life of insight, a man’s hold and 
grasp of the central realities of what is most valu- 
able and most divine, and therefore also most human. + 
Now it is to the attainment of this insight, and to 
the habitual diffusion of it throughout the State, 
that the long, laborious quest of the scholar must 
conduct him, if his efforts are not to be in vain. 
For him, as for all other children of Adam, the 
primal curse must be transmuted into the ultimate 
blessing through the steady employment of his own 
proper energy in the accomplishment of a desired 
end. He has details to learn and manipulate, as 
have the farmer and the financier. His province 
being knowledge, not vague and ill-defined, but ex- 
act as well as comprehensive, it is his function in 
society to be always learning, which means contem- 
plating, and not in a haphazard way, but with a pur- 
pose, and according to the most efficacious methods 
that have been, or can be, discovered. The best 
scholar, serving his country to the utmost, may be

Journal of Ethics, Jan., 1911, p. 163.

194 THE LEADER IN SCHOLARSHIP 
defined as the best man studying the best things in 
the best way; and whatever else the best way may 
imply, it means first of all a thorough and orderly 
procedure. If he is to render an individual service 
to the State, the scholar, at the least, is bound to 
know some one thing, or some aspect of it, better 
than any one else, and must be able to communicate 
a part of the insight which this knowledge gives him. 
And he must continue learning and communicating 
throughout his life. The moment he ceases to learn, 
he ceases to be a scholar; his essential service to the 
State begins to flag—and his own self-respect to ebb 
away. 
It follows that no one who is not a scholar can be 
a teacher, and, other things being equal, the better 
scholar he is, the better teacher will he be; and the 
more productive he is in the normal way of pub- 
lished studies, the more refreshing will his person- 
ality become to his thirsty students. It is better to 
drink of a flowing brook than from a stagnant pool; 
and the doctrine of faith without works has no last- 
ing appeal to a healthy mind. I know that the belly 
and the big toe and the blind mouth, who sometimes 
pretend to teach, make uncouth signs and sounds to 
the effect that the effluence of the disciplined eye is 
not essential. But as Ben Jonson says, to judge of 
poets is only the faculty of poets;? and similarly 
we may say here: to judge of scholars is only the 
faculty of scholars. As no one dare affirm that the

vinced that what he has tried is ideal, so no one can 
estimate the influence of scholarship upon teaching, 
who does not repeatedly, and for the sheer love of 
it, bring his own studies to a successful issue. ‘Great 
understandings,’ says Jonson, sometimes ‘will rather 
choose to die than not to know the things they study 
for. Think then what an evil [ignorance] is, and 
what good the contrary.’ Now who ever heard of 
the belly or the big toe preferring death to igno- 
rance? It is the eye alone that pines away in the 
dark. To the busily idle in our universities, how- 
ever, Jonson may seem to furnish only a broad and 
inconclusive rejoinder; for varied and slippery are 
the arguments against intense labor and study which 
the unscholarly invent in order to save themselves 
from a confession of indolence, or to put away the 
thought of their unfitness for the scholarly positions 
into which they have intruded. But if a specific in- 
stance is needed of a man who was a great teacher 
because he was a great and tasteful scholar, we may 
take the Latinist who taught the foremost popular- 
izer of classical literature in our day. Says An- 
drew Lang: 
‘It was extraordinary to see the advance which all 
who cared to work made under Mr. Sellar’s instruc- 
tions; . . . the stimulus of competition was needless 
to all who were able to feel the inspiration of [his] 
educational influence. It is not easy for his bio- 
grapher to refrain from saying that, having come 
to St. Andrews with no purpose of working, he left it 
in another mind, and that to Mr. Sellar he owes the

impulse to busy himself with letters. ... No less 
important than his work as an author, important as 
that is, was his example as a scholar, and as a man; 
his loyal, honorable, simple, and generous life. ... 
He loved his studies entirely for their own sake; he 
dwelt with the great of old because he enjoyed their 
company.’ ? 
We must allow, then, that good fellowship, easy 
manners, and a knowing way with the crowd, or the 
eloquence that often attends mere bodily vigor and 
lively spirits, cannot make an ideal teacher of one 
who lacks the habitual impulse to acquire sound 
learning, or to submit the results of his labor openly 
to the judgment and for the benefit of his peers. 
On the other hand, when scholarship is rare, it is a 
mistake for those who have the prime requisite, and 
have also the necessary tact, to shirk the responsibil- 
ity, and forego the personal advantages, of instruct- 
ing in class. Not that there should be too heavy a 
burden. The balance should always be in favor of 
less rather than more teaching; for even a little, 
artistically done, is good for the State, whereas over- 
much, perfunctorily and wearily, or jauntily and 
carelessly, gone through with, is worse than useless. 
In after-life most students very properly recall the 
benefits they once received from capable teaching; 
yet there is an account to be revealed at the Last 
Judgment of the injury wrought by instruction 
which had a name that it was alive, but was dead. 
With the proper amount of teaching—not more than

eight or ten hours a week—the scholar is of all the 
more worth to his university and to the State, not 
only because he thereby multiplies his personal in- 
fluence, sending out others of his sort into the com- 
munal life, but because the contact with young and 
growing minds is salutary to the spirit of the learned. 
The teacher must be singularly dense who cannot 
profit by an exchange of ideas with the pupils whom 
he has the opportunity of training. But, whether 
for his own sake or for that of the younger genera- 
tion, we may look with distrust upon the man who 
attempts to separate teaching from scholarship, or 
scholarship from teaching, save when some infirmity 
of temper, or ineradicable defect of manner, renders 
the presence of an individual scholar useless as well 
as unpleasant in class. However, we are dealing, 
not with the exceptional case, but with the typical, 
and with what every one should desire in a leader. 
All true scholars, being orderly learners, are 
organizers of knowledge, and of the means of attain- 
ing it, and hence possess to some degree the essential 
power of leadership in organizing instruction. The 
ease of Fichte is an illustration. According to his 
biographer, when. the peace of 1807 was concluded, 
among the first means to be suggested for restoring 
the political welfare of Prussia was the establish- 
ment of the University of Berlin, ‘from which, as 
from the spiritual heart of the community, a cur- 
rent of life and energy might be poured forth 
through all its members.’ Fichte being chosen as 
the man before all others fitted for the task, ‘un- 
limited power was given him to frame for the new

university a constitution which should insure its 
efficiency and success.’ He already had set forth 
his ideals of education in an impressive course of 
lectures at Erlangen, where he had discussed such 
topics as these: ‘Of Integrity in Study’; ‘Of the 
Progressive Scholar’; ‘Of the Finished Scholar’; 
‘Of the Scholar as Teacher’; ‘Of the Scholar as 
Ruler.’ He entered upon his new undertaking with 
ardor, 
‘And towards the end of 1807 his plan was com- 
pleted. . . . Its chief feature was perfect unity of pur- 
pose, complete subordination of every branch of in- 
struction to the one great object of all teaching—not 
the inculeation of opinion, but the spiritual culture 
and elevation of the student. The institution was to 
be an organic whole—an assemblage, not of mere 
teachers holding various and perhaps opposite views, 
and living only to disseminate these, but of men ani- 
mated by a common purpose, and steadily pursuing 
one recognized object. ‘The office of the professor 
was not to repeat verbally what already stood 
printed in books, and might be found there; but to 
exercise a diligent supervision over the studies of the 
pupil, and to see that he fully acquired by his own 
effort, as a personal and independent possession, the 
branch of knowledge which was the object of his 
studies. It was thus a school for the scientific use 
of the understanding, in which positive or historical 
knowledge was to be looked upon only as a vehicle 
of instruction, not as an ultimate end. Spiritual 
independence, intellectual strength, moral dignity— 
these were the great ends to the attainment of which 
everything else was but the instrument.’

THE MEDIAVAL USE OF LEISURE 199 
Now I submit that this ideal of Fichte, who was a 
student of Dante as well as a ‘post-Kantian’ phi- 
losopher, is in its essence an ideal of the organic 
scholarly spirit of the Middle Ages; and that none 
but a student of Dante and the Middle Ages can say, 
and few actually are aware, to what extent univer- 
sity education in modern times is indebted, through 
Fichte, to the theory of culture which is often mis- 
takenly condemned under the name of Scholasti- 
cism. ~‘Scholasticism’ is a forbidding word when 
people have not Greek enough to apprehend the 
significance of cxod7. The thirteenth century, the 
Middle Ages, had at least enough for that. To them, 
not less than to Plato and Aristotle, do we owe such 
notions as still persist of an organic unity in studies, 
of the superiority of the life of contemplation, and 
of a leisure which bas not the wit to be idle. In a 
State, as in a university, the level of civilization 
may be accurately gauged by the way in which ‘edu- 
vated’ persons use their leisure, and the ideal that 
is entertained concerning womanhood. Too many 
of our persons of leisure, a class that has been cre- 
ated by our enormous material wealth, have just wit 
enough to spend their time reclining in motor-cars 
or on the decks of luxurious private yachts. If we 
seek evidence of our reverence for women, our Par- 
thenon is yet to build, and we repudiate the spirit 
exemplified in Notre-Dame de Chartres. On occa- 
sion, however, we bow down to brick and stone, 
when the chance offers for the erection of a costly 
university building, while humane scholarship and

the true means to the organization of learning—that is, 
scholars—are left unprovided. 
Different sight 
Those venerable Doctors saw of old, ... 
When, in forlorn and naked chambers cooped 
And crowded, o’er the ponderous books they hung 
Like caterpillars eating out their way 
In silence, or with keen devouring noise 
Not to be tracked or fathered. Princes then 
At matins froze, and couched at curfew-time, 
Trained up through piety and zeal to prize 
Spare diet, patient labor, and plain weeds.t 
In its later actual embodiment, the vision of Fichte 
was modified in part by that of Schleiermacher, a 
Platonist, and Wilhelm von Humboldt, who is said to 
have refrained from composing his memoirs, in order 
to save time for the study of the classics. These ex- 
amples of scholarly organizers are typical, if any- 
thing is; so is the instance of Madvig, minister of 
instruction in Denmark; so is that of any one of the 
great scholars, Members of the Academy and profes- 
sors in the Collége de France, who, during the last 
fifty years, have directed the growth of education in 
Paris. With these patterns before us, how come we in 
America to believe that we may entrust the organi- 
zation of our schools and colleges to men who have 
not engaged in research, or in any way contributed to 
the advancement of learning, or to men who, when 
once they begin to multiply the formal devices of 
administration, give up the contemplative life, and

therewith their function of real scholarly leadership, 
making friends with Mammon in order to secure for 
their institutions the things that are Cesar’s? There 
are, and have been, notable exceptions. Woolsey at 
Yale was one, nor did Mammon treat him the worse 
for being an able scholar and teacher; and it is easy 
to think of other examples, searching candles, divine 
lamps to all the inward parts of Leviathan. History 
shows that the real leaders in education are those who 
continually see to it that the kingdom of scholarship 
is within them. 
What now, still more definitely, is the function of 
the true leader of scholarship, as opposed to the osten- 
sible? His office will be made clear through a restate- 
ment of the positions we have reached, if we include 
with these several other obvious truths, and illustrate 
here and there from the lives and opinions of some 
of the most eminent leaders themselves. The illustra- 
tions are mainly drawn from the domain of classical 
and medieval learning, and not from that of physical 
science, though the life of contemplation may be led 
there also. But the overbalance of attention which 
physical, biological, and economic science has chanced 
to obtain from the last six or seven generations should 
incline us to lay all the more stress upon those dis- 
ciplines which immediately concern the spirit of man, 
and which we directly associate with the term ‘human- 
ities.’ If we may judge from the custom of language, 
the organizer of humane studies, especially the study 
of the most original literatures, will be one of the 
chief leaders of men, and chief contributors to a more 
abundant human life. Vita sine litteris est mors.
-P-A-G-E-212
  202 THE LEADER IN SCHOLARSHIP 
The leader of scholarship must be a scholar, as the 
leader of an army must be a soldier, first, last, and 
always. Though it is necessary for him to understand 
the functions of other classes, and though the head of 
the State cannot say to him, ‘I have no need of you,’? 
he will not relinquish the fundamental duties of his 
own primary office, except in dire emergency. When 
William the Third summoned his people to withstand 
Napoleon in 1812, the professors of the new University 
of Berlin did not lag behind, says Hoffmann, in his life 
of the Hellenist, August Boeckh. Fichte and Schleier- 
macher bore arms in the ranks, and Boeckh had com- 
mand of acompany.? This experience as soldier is but 
an episode, however, in the record of the great cap- 
tain of Hellenic studies, who was perhaps, all things 
2 Compare Wordsworth, Monks and Schoolmen (Ecclesiastical 
Sonnets 2. 5): 
Record we too, with just and faithful pen, 
That many hooded cenobites there are, 
Who in their private cells have yet a care 
Of public quiet; unambitious men, 
Counsellors for the world, of piercing ken; 
Whose fervent exhortations from afar 
Move princes to their duty, peace or war; 
And oft-times in the most forbidding den 
Of solitude, with love of science strong, 
How patiently the yoke of thought they bear! 
How subtly glide its finest threads along! 
Spirits that crowd the intellectual sphere 
With mazy boundaries, as the astronomer 
With orb and cycle girds the starry throng. 
2 Hoffmann, August Boeckh, 1901, p. 28.

FICHTE AT ERLANGEN 203 
considered, the greatest organizer of scholarship in 
modern times, and who, toward the end of a career of 
quiet yet well-nigh incredible productivity as a writer 
and teacher, still described his proper motion in the 
words of Solon :Pypdoxw aiet roa. Si8acxduevos— TI grow 
old ever learning many things.’ 
The leader, having served his apprenticeship, will 
be able to distinguish his younger fellow-scholars when 
he sees them. He must be able to tell gold from brass 
and pinchbeck. And he will not encourage the un- 
scholarly in the profession of teaching. 
Though scholarship must concern itself with details, 
and can never forego this concern, its final purpose 
is the establishment of general truths as a basis for 
thought and action. Attend to the incomparable 
Fichte, as he addresses his students at Erlangen, with 
a bitter experience at Jena fresh in his mind: 
‘IT am a Priest of Truth; I am in her pay; I have 
bound myself to do all things, to venture all things, 
to suffer all things for her. If I should be persecuted 
and hated for her sake, if I should even meet death 
in her service, what wonderful thing is it I shall have 
done ?—what but that which I clearly ought to do?’ 
‘T know,’ he continues, ‘that an effeminate and 
nerveless generation will tolerate neither these feelings 
nor the expression of them; . . . but I know too where 
I speak. I speak before young men who are at pres- 
ent secured by their youth against this utter enerva- 
tion. ... I avow it freely, that from the point on 
which Providence has placed me, I too would willingly 
contribute something to extend in every direction, as 
far as my native tongue can reach, and farther if pos-
-P-A-G-E-214
  204 THE LEADER IN SCHOLARSHIP 
sible, a more manly tone of thought, a stronger sense of 
elevation and dignity, a more ardent zeal to fulfil our 
destiny at every hazard ;—so that when you shall have 
left this place, and are scattered abroad in all direc- 
tions, I may one day know in you, wherever you may 
dwell, men whose chosen friend is Truth, who adhere 
to her in life and in death, who receive her when she is 
east out by all the world, who take her openly under 
their protection when she is traduced and calum- 
niated, who for her sake will joyfully bear the cun- 
ningly concealed enmity of the great, the dull sneer 
= the coxcomb, and the compassionating shrug of the 
‘ool.’ * 
The veritable scholar represents the happy medium 
between the pedant who dwells immoderately upon 
the non-essential, and the dilettantish person who toys 
with half-truths and threadbare generalizations, which 
he takes at second hand from others of his stripe, 
never testing any of them by the inductive method. 
The scholar is not loose, and he is not dull. The vul- 
gar opinion that persons of great learning lack taste 
and insight, which is characteristic of persons who lack 
all three, is not borne out by an examination of typical 
instanees. Of Richard Bentley’s first publication we 
are told by his biographer, Monk: 
‘The style of the Epistle is animated and lively, 
and implies the gratification felt by a writer engaged 
in a field where his resources are abundant, and where 
he is sure to instruct and interest his reader. A per- 
son who opens it with the expectation of a dry dis- 
quisition upon certain abstruse topics is agreeably 
surprised by meeting with information not less enter-

taining than profound, and is irresistibly carried on 
by the spirited character of the remarks,’ + 
The scholar is known by his consuming love of some 
special department of knowledge throughout its own 
minutest interrelations, and in its relations to knowl- 
edge as a whole. On this point let us hear the signifi- 
eant words of a vivacious writer, well-known for his 
command of choice and fluent English, who is ‘not 
ashamed of being classed with the alphabetic gram- 
marians,’ though he has stood for the broadest kind 
of scholarship in America. I mean Professor Gilder- 
sleeve. He says: 
‘The intellectual and spiritual history of most men 
is to be found in the succession of their teachers, but 
it must be remembered that the function of the teacher 
is mainly the introduction to the love or the loves of 
one’s life. . . . That mistress of mine bore a lumber- 
ing name—Altertumswissenschafi—imperfectly ren- 
dered by ‘‘Science of Antiquity.’’ But then you can- 
not translate ‘‘Gretchen,’’ you can only love her. The 
man who introduced me to her was a quiet old Privy 
Councillor, . . . a man of shuffling gait, of slow and 
deliberate utterance, who read his lectures from a 
yellow ‘‘heft’’ to which were attached supplementary 
strips of paper, and yet his teaching made a passion- 
ate classicist out of an amateurish student of litera- 
ture. Boeckh was a great master, the greatest living 
master. of Hellenic studies, and if I became after a 
fashion a Hellenist, it was due not merely to the cata- 
lytic effect of his presence, but to the orbed complete- 
ness of the ideal he evoked, . . . and if I have ever 
brought any vital force for myself and others to the 
study of the classics, it has been through the belief 
1 Monk, Life of Richard Bentley, p. 25.
-P-A-G-E-216
  206 THE LEADER IN SCHOLARSHIP 
cherished from early manhood in the correlation of all 
the various departments of study.’ + 
The leader in scholarship perceives the relation of 
his own effort, not only to that of other scholars, but 
to the corporate functions of the State. He thus knows 
why he does one thing, perhaps seemingly humble, and 
abstains from another that is superficially alluring, 
in the light of his public service and the necessities of 
the time. He conceives of himself as fulfilling a higher 
purpose than any one else in the State save the poet— 
or artist in the inclusive sense—and the minister of 
religion. His activity is closely allied, as well as indis- 
pensable, to theirs. And when their energy flags, he 
must redouble his efforts. ‘When the death of his emi- 
nent predecessor, Edouard Laboulaye, left vacant the 
position [of Administrator of the Collége de France],’ 
Renan, says Gaston Paris, ‘declared to his colleagues 
that the place was the only one for which he had ever 
been ambitious, and that it seemed to him to be the 
highest and most beautiful that a Frenchman could 
occupy.’? And in connection with another celebrated 
Orientalist, a man of Jewish blood, the same Gaston 
Paris observed : 
‘We are come, as [Darmesteter] himself said, to the 
times described by the prophet: ‘‘Behold, the days 
come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine 
in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for 
water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And 
1 Hellas and Hesperia, pp. 40-43.

-P-A-G-E-217
SCHOLARS, POETS, AND PROPHETS 207 
they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north 
even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the 
word of the Lord, and shall not find it. In that day 
shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.’’ 
To that thirst which he felt about him [Darmesteter] 
pointed out the place where he discerned fresh foun- 
tains, and cisterns filled with water from heaven.’ + 
The leader in scholarship is aware that learning 
cannot to any considerable extent be directly trans- 
ferred from one person to another, but is a power 
which must be organically developed in the individ- 
ual. As a teacher, accordingly, he makes little at- 
tempt to deal with immature students in squadrons 
and gross bands. So was it with Renan, of whom 
we already have spoken. Though endowed with a 
faculty of popular exposition unequaled perhaps in 
his age and nation, he did not hesitate to announce 
that he regarded his true function to be the initiat- 
ing of a small number of scholars into his own spe- 
cial field of research.” 
Since the function of the scholar is one definite, 
indivisible kind of activity, the more scholarly a man 
is, the more typical will he be, and the more indi- 
vidual. This is a difficult thought, it may be, for 
those who have never been happy enough to recog- 
nize scholarship as a personal force, or to see in it 
a natural form of life. But those who have been 
well-taught have discerned the truth in the indi- 
viduality of their teachers. When his students and

friends throughout the world presented that great- 
est of mediewvalists, the late Gaston Paris, with a 
medal in honor of his election to the Academy, they 
addressed him in part as follows: 
‘No doubt, in summoning you to join her, the 
French Academy has meant to honor in a more par- 
ticular way the author, the man of letters for whom 
the rigors of precise investigation have occasioned 
no loss in the sense of beauty. As for us [pupils 
and fellow-scholars], we make no distinction; for the 
profound sympathy which we desire to signalize 
makes no distinction between the man and his 
work,’ + 
A writer in one of the general encyclopedias has 
also detected the essential unity of this distinct, 
refined, and comprehensive soul: 
‘Since Sainte-Beuve, who gave little attention to 
the linguistic side, the French nation had had no 
critic so great as Gaston Paris. In him the philolo- 
gist and the lover of beauty were at one. Paris was 
reared among literary men. Toward the end of his 
life he was at the head of scientific literary criticism 
in France. He had no showy theories, but his dis- 
eoveries were many, and his knowledge was so wide 
that other great scholars were loath to assail his 
views. Yet his influence, which had been won by his 
steadfastly scientific attitude, and by the modera- 
tion, clearness, and charm of his thought, created no 
doctrinary school. He had rare personal dignity, a 
keen, but sober wit, an extraordinary memory, and a 
wide acquaintance with men. ... He excelled not

-P-A-G-E-219
  GASTON PARIS 209 
only in textual criticism, but in teaching and in arous- 
ing a sound love of old literature.’ * 
The great scholar, being a leader and enthusiast, 
possessing the evidence of things unseen by the 
masses, and full of faith in conserving both the little 
and the great within his province, is rigorous, 
methodical, and exacting in his pursuit of the unify- 
ing ideal. When the necessity arises, he will be- 
come a gadfly like Socrates, or a whetstone like 
Horace. M. Frédéric Masson was aware of this, 
when he said of his predecessor in the Academy, 
thinking of him in his prime: 
‘M. Gaston Paris returned to France, convinced of 
the excellence of the German methods, and deeply 
tinged with the German spirit, not only through the 
forms of study which he had adopted, but through 
the direction that had been given to his thoughts. 
At the same time, his intelligence was of too high 
an order to be content with treading in furrows that 
were already ploughed; and he had hopes of opening 
new ones upon the soil of France. Proposing, there- 
fore, to show by his own example that the French 
were as capable as any other nation of perseverance 
in scholarship, of precision in criticism, of ingenuity 
in comparison, and of rigor in the drawing of a con- 
clusion, he naturalized the science which he had 
brought from Germany, and confidently aimed to 
win for France the supremacy in those studies that 
were essentially French. ... Before long, his oral 
instruction, productive though it had been of results, 
did not suffice for the energy which he brought to 
his task. To adapt the French spirit to this new

method, it must be subdued to a constant surveillance 
which would not allow the slightest hesitation or 
falling away, but would steadily maintain the activ- 
ity of those who attended his school, and unceasingly 
reveal to them the authority of the master. There 
was need of a discipline stringent, impartial, and 
hard, which should eall attention to faults, record 
results, chastise foolish blunders, and declare itself 
as much by the qualities of exactitude and distinct- 
ness as by a general competency. M. Gaston Paris 
was one of the founders of the Revue Critique. In 
this capacity, he subjected all books which, closely 
or remotely, touched upon his own studies to a 
formidable inquisition, a mode of analysis which, 
banishing phrases to the point of abbreviating names, 
winnowed out the facts, not suffering a single one 
to pass that was uncertain, and in terms which were 
severe, and sometimes cruel, formulated judgments 
that were definitive. No one ventured to appeal, for 
the response would have come, crushing and inex- 
orable.’ +   
Finally, the scholar tempers the severity which he 
must exercise in his high calling, and the pride 
which he ought to take in it, as well as the melan- 
choly of emulation which is said to afflict him, with 
a humility and pity which are often misleading to 
the hard-headed man of business and the foremost 
of the clamorous mob. He pities those who have 
missed, or seen and lost again, the vision of the 
Source of all the light that is in the material and 
immaterial universe; for as the lecturer at Erlangen 
put it: 
*Le Temps (Paris), Supplément au Journal du 29 janvier, 
1904,
-P-A-G-E-221
  
THE SCHOLAR IS HUMBLE 211 
‘The whole of the training and education which 
an age calls learned culture is only the means to- 
wards a knowledge of the attainable portion of the 
Divine Idea, and is only valuable in so far as it 
actually is such a means, and truly fulfils its pur- 
pose.’ + 
And the scholar is humble, because, with the poet, 
he knows that pride, 
Howe’er disguised in its own majesty, 
Is littleness; that he who feels contempt 
For any living thing, hath faculties 
Which he has never used; that thought with him 
Is in its infancy. ... 
O be wiser, Thou! 
Instructed that true knowledge leads to love; 
True dignity abides with him alone 
Who, in the silent hour of inward thought, 
Can still suspect, and still revere himself, 
In lowliness of heart.? 
The scholar is as humble in his unwearied patience 
as in his unwearied effort. Says Fichte: 
‘The scholar . . . is the teacher of the human race. 
. . . He cannot desire to hurry forward humanity at 
once to the goal which perhaps gleams brightly be- 
fore his own vision—the road cannot be overleaped; 
he must only take care that it do not stand still, and 
that it do not turn back. In this respect the scholar 
is the guide of the human race.’?

of the Middle Ages illustrated the pity and humil- 
ity of the scholar! Dante, in truth, has so com- 
pletely fused the thought of the Old and the New 
Testament in respect to the contemplative life that 
our series of authoritative utterances may fittingly 
conclude with a passage from the opening of his 
Conviwio: 
‘As the Philosopher says at the beginning of the 
First Philosophy, ‘‘all men naturally desire to have 
knowledge.’’+ The reason of this may be that every- 
thing, being impelled by foresight belonging to its 
own nature, tends to seek its own perfection. Where- 
fore, inasmuch as knowledge is the final perfection 
of our soul in which our final happiness consists, all 
men are naturally subject to the desire for it. Many, 
however, are deprived of this noblest perfection 
through various causes which, operating within or 
without the man, place the possession of knowledge 
beyond his reach, 
‘Within the man there may be two defects and 
hindrances, the one appertaining to the body, the 
other to the soul. That appertaining to the body 
arises when its parts are not properly ordered, so 
that it is receptive of nothing, as is the case with the 
deaf and dumb, and the like; that appertaining to 
the soul arises when wickedness prevails over her so 
that she becomes a follower of vicious delights, 
wherein she gives way to such deception that on 
account of these she holds cheap everything else. 
‘Outside the man, in the same way, two causes 
may be apprehended, one of which subjects him to 
necessity, the other to sloth. The first is the care 
of the family and of the State, which properly draws 
+ Aristotle, Metaphysica, first sentence.

DANTE ON CONTEMPLATION 213 
to itself the greater part of mankind, so that they 
cannot afford leisure for contemplation. The second 
is the fault of the place where a person is born and 
brought up, which sometimes will be not only devoid 
of every kind of study, but remote from studious 
people... .. 
‘Plainly, therefore, may any one who ponders 
earefully see that there is but a small remnant who 
can attain to the state desired by all, and that those 
who are hindered, and live always famishing for 
want of this food intended for all, are almost in- 
numerable. Oh, happy are those few who sit at that 
table where the bread of angels is eaten, and wretched 
are those who share the food of cattle. But since a 
man is naturally a friend of every man, and every 
friend grieves for the defect of him whom he loves, 
they who are fed at so lofty a table are not without 
pity for those whom they see go about eating grass 
and acorns on the pasture of beasts. And since pity 
is the mother of kind deeds, they who have knowledge 
always bestow liberally of their boon riches on those 
who are veritably poor; and are as it were a living 
fountain by the water of which the natural thirst men- 
tioned above is slaked. I who am not seated at the table 
of the blest, but am fled from the pasture of the 
common herd, and at the feet of those who sit at 
that table am gathering up of that which falls from 
them, perceive how wretched is the life of those 
whom I have left behind by the sweetness which I 
taste in that which little by little I gather up. 
Moved by pity, therefore, and not forgetful of my 
own state, ... I intend to prepare for all men a 
banquet. ...I do not wish that any one should sit 
at table with any of his organs in bad order; because 
he has not teeth or tongue or palate, nor any one 
addicted to vice, because his stomach is full of poison- 
ous and contrary humors, so that it could not retain

my meat. But let every one come hither who through 
domestic or public anxiety cannot appease the hunger 
that men feel, and let him sit at one table with all 
others who are likewise hindered. ... And I pray 
all of them that if the banquet be not so splendid as 
beseems its profession, they will impute every fault 
not to my will but to my want of power, because my 
will here aims at perfect and precious liberality.’ + 
Does a smile of derision, not untinged with pain and 
anger, run over the countenance of some most grave 
man of practical affairs, when, with a deliberation 
greater than his own, we assure him that the life of 
contemplation is not only more to be desired, but in- 
finitely more effective than his ?—That it is more to be 
desired because it is more effective? Its effects are 
more lasting; for we may now identify this superior 
scholarly life with the life not only of profound imagi- 
nation and clearest insight, but, as Wordsworth does, 
with that of absolute power. What the poet calls 
insight and imagination, the author of a celebrated 
letter dealing with this higher life calls Faith’—the 
power by which some men have gained a good repu- 
tation, others understood the first principles of celes- 
tial mechanics, others found the way to make pecu- 
niary sacrifices that in the end were profitable, and 
still others acquired the means of subduing the shape- 
less horror that Enoch avoided, and the belly is most 
afraid of. By the use of this power, the people that 
love the crowded city, and control most of the things

  THE THINGS THAT ARE CHSAR’S 215 
that are Cxsar’s, were yet led through the deep, as a 
horse through the wilderness, that they should not 
stumble; for the Jew as well as the Greek has shown 
us that if the practical is duly subordinated to the 
contemplative life, there is no quarrel between them. 
It was a Jew who declared that wisdom is better than 
rubies, and that all the things that may be desired are 
not to be compared to it: ‘I, wisdom, dwell with pru- 
dence ... I have strength. By me kings reign, and 
princes decree justice. ... My fruit is better than 
gold, yea than fine gold; and my revenue than choice 
silver.’ + 4 
Do we believe this, or not? If we believe it, let us 
awake from our apathy in the matter of inducting 
young men into the life of scholarship. Away with the 
false and cowardly arguments by which the life of the 
properly disciplined teacher is represented as tame and 
unsatisfying. The life of the unfit, untrained teacher, 
one may grant, can hardly be pleasing or satisfactory 
to himself or to any one else. But were the vocation 
of the scholar even worse rewarded than it is with the 
things of which Peter had none, our present duty in 
America would be not a whit the less clear. To what 
end do we say to the elect of our rising generation that, 
they are wise if they seek to engage in one or other of 
the professions that offer a rich reward in the things 
of the belly? What call have we to defraud those who 
can earn them of the highest enjoyments possible to 
human nature? If the country at large has been blind 
to their needs and its own, it is plain that from some

  216 THE LEADER IN SCHOLARSHIP 
source the country must obtain better organs of vision, 
and the new ones must be better disciplined. 
There seems to be one sole remedy for most of the 
ailments of our educational organism, however varied 
the complaints may appear to be; and murmurs arise 
on every side. As for the cause of these ailments, 
divers folk diversely deem : 
As many heddes as manye wittes ther been.t 
But if we liken, not the State, but our system of 
education, to the magic horse, a work of art that should 
move like a work of nature, it may be said that the 
cure for its ills will have little to do with the outward 
mechanism. Some may think that the mechanism is 
unnecessarily complex. But in any case that endless 
tinkering with the visible parts of the machine, which 
occupies the attention of so many doctors, has seem- 
ingly added little to the vitality of our instruction. 
My notion of the trouble with this steed is that he 
needs more of a certain kind of fuel, or spiritual 
naphtha, which, if brought from its Mediterranean 
source, and properly ignited within him, would cause 
his eye to gleam again, and enable him to mount and 
flash through the empyrean. 
It is sometimes maintained that educational reform 
must begin at the bottom, and work upward—from 
the gouty foot of the public school, doubtless, to the 
blindfold head of ill-guided research among advanced 
students of the humanities. But the founders of the 
University of Berlin thought otherwise; and where in

  CURE OF THE BODY EDUCATIONAL 217 
educational history is there an instance of a regener- 
ation from below? The hearing ear, and the seeing 
eye, they are both of them gifts from above, and their 
healing ministrations are potent throughout the body 
downwards; as Hippocrates observed, therefore, no 
injury to the head should be neglected. Let us have 
no more, then, of the heresy that the graduate schools 
of our country may shift for themselves, while we 
teach a horde of Freshmen the rudiments of English 
grammar and orthography. One apostle is worth 
many sparrows, and one are-light equal to a thousand 
farthing candles. Let there be fewer among the led, 
and let there be leaders who are continually purging 
their vision. 
In other words, a solution of all sorts of educational 
difficulties that have not yielded to a prolonged me- 
chanical treatment is this: let every one who has a 
capacity for the life of contemplation, and at present 
feels that he is not leading it, in whatever college or 
university he be, straightway begin to lead it, paying 
the homage that is due to Athens, the eye of Greece, 
Mother of Arts, and to Beatrice and Rachel of the 
direct and perfect vision. Though in some the vital 
faith be almost dead, shriveled to the proportions of 
a mustard-seed, nevertheless let it be immersed in the 
light that emanates from Italy and Greece and. Pales- 
tine, and it may kindle and spring up into a welcome 
efflorescence. As for the rest, who, like Mr. Kipling, 
chant the praise of the Sons of Martha, and win favor- 
able glances from Rachel’s ‘squint-eyed’ sister, Leah, 
of the practical vocations, let them betake themselves  
-P-A-G-E-228
  218 THE LEADER IN SOHOLARSHIP 
to their labor, which is necessary and honorable; but 
let them cease from their querulous assertion of the 
rights of the material body, lest they disturb the essen- 
tial activity of the soul and of human life. 
But to all who by scholarly works continually assert 
their interest in the things of the spirit comes the eter- 
nal assurance that they have chosen the better part; 
for they are in league with the rulers of men, with that 
great society, ‘the noble living and the noble dead,’ 
who have perceived through faith and imagination 
that truth and beauty are one—who are the victorious 
power in the world.

WAYS AND MEANS OF IMPROVING 
UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIP? 
I. A Rerorm or THE Meruop or INstrucTION 
BY LECTURES 
HE case for lectures as a means of instruction 
was ably argued by the late Professor Paulsen 
in his German Universities ;* yet it is clear from the 
arguments attacked by Paulsen that there has been no 
little dissatisfaction on the Continent with the grow- 
ing tendency there among university teachers to con- 
vey information by lecturing to the students, at the 
expense of seminary and proseminary courses in which 
the individual student hitherto has taken an active 
part in his own education. Moreover, it is not quite 
correct to say, as Paulsen does, that there must be some 
justification for a system that has had a continuous 
history from the time of Aristotle and the Greeks gen- 
erally, through the Middle Ages, and down to our own 
+ Under this head I have revised, combined, and extended, four 
communications which severally appeared in the Cornell Alumni 
News for June 15, 1916, May 17, 1917, and May 24, 1917, and 
the Nation, New York, for May 4, 1918; the material is used 
with the kind consent of the editor of the Cornell Alumni News 
and the editor of the Nation.

generation. Socrates did not lecture; he questioned 
his pupils, and debated with them. The works of Plato 
that have reached us are dialogues, not lectures. And 
the method of Aristotle in teaching is indicated by 
the name of ‘Peripatetic’; the master walked and 
talked with his students—he did not mainly talk to 
them. In the Middle Ages, again, disputation was the 
recognized method of arriving at the truth. Even 
formal lectures were constantly interrupted by ques- 
tions. The Colloquies of Alcuin, the debates of Abe- 
lard, are equally characteristic of the earlier and the 
later Middle Ages. The dialogue, the conference in 
the true sense, was the predominant form of instruc- 
tion with the best teachers whether ancient or mediw- 
val, before the invention of printing, when the easiest 
way of publishing knowledge was by dictation to a 
large audience. 
- But further, if the practice of lecturing to French 
or German university students is questionable, what 
shall we say of the practice when transferred from the 
Continent to this country, where conditions are so 
different—where the students are so differently pre- 
pared? Shall we not frankly confess, where they are 
so ill-prepared ? 
If it is proper to say so, I am one of those who be- 
lieve in an occasional stimulating lecture on a literary 
topic or the like, for the purpose of arousing the latent 
interests of the pupil, or less frequently, and yet often 
enough, in order to give him distinct notions of the 
great guiding lines that run through the subject he 
is studying, of the interrelations of that subject with
-P-A-G-E-231
  THE CASE AGAINST LECTURES 221 
others in the curriculum, and of the place of that sub- 
ject in the sum-total of knowledge. The attention of 
the student must be caught, and his energies awakened, 
by every legitimate device. Once caught and stirred, 
his interest and energies may be profitably directed 
into channels they might never enter of themselves. 
But it does not follow that the teacher should for ever 
keep striving to win an attention that has once been 
fairly captured. When we come to think of it, the 
constant use of lectures, as an instrument of educa- 
tion to which all other instruments are made subordi- 
-nate, is little short of grotesque. When, we may ask, 
will there be an adequate opportunity for the pupil 
to become self-active, if in the main he is taught only 
to listen and copy? Especially ridiculous is the cus- 
tom of lecturing to the Sophomores and Freshmen in 
our colleges and so-called universities as if they really 
were seasoned university students. In reality they 
have not, as compared with students of like age on the 
Continent, advanced beyond the stage of preparation 
represented by the last two years of a German gymna- 
sium or a French lycée; not to speak of the manifest 
inferiority in attainments—in actual knowledge and 
in critical ability—of our Juniors and Seniors in com- 
parison with Continental students when they reach 
the great European universities. How preposterous, 
then, is the tendency to introduce teaching by lectures 
into our preparatory and high schools! 
I naturally have in mind the practice of lecturing on 
English authors and on the history of English litera- 
ture. Accordingly, three of the four passages which 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  999) WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
follow are chosen from writers whose position in Eng- 
lish literature lends a special force to what they say. 
I give all four without needless preamble, but may add 
that, so far as I'am aware, the utterances of Dr. John- 
son and the poet Wordsworth on this topic have never 
before been brought together, though the resemblance 
between them is singularly close. The passage from 
Hilty may serve to recall a writer, of great good sense, 
who is perhaps less frequently read to-day than was 
the case fifteen or twenty years ago. 
Johnson's opinion is recorded by Boswell : 
‘Talking of education, ‘‘People have nowadays,’’ 
said he, ‘‘got a strange opinion that everything should 
be taught by lectures. Now I cannot see that lectures 
ean do so much good as reading the books from which 
the lectures are taken. I know nothing that can be 
best taught by lectures, except where experiments are 
to be shown. You may teach chymistry by lectures— 
you might teach making of shoes by lectures!’’ ’+ 
In June, 1825, Wordsworth wrote to Lord Lonsdale, 
alluding to ‘the London College Committee,’ and the 
educational scheme proposed by Brougham : 
‘As to teaching belles-lettres, languages, law, polit- 
ical economy, morals, ete., by lectures, it is absurd. 
Lectures may be very useful in experimental philos- 
ophy, geology, and natural history, or any art or 
science capable of illustration by experiments, opera- 
tions, and specimens; but in other departments of 
knowledge they are, in most cases, worse than super- 
fluous. Of course I do not include in the above censure

  WITNESSES AGAINST LECTURING 223 
“college lectures,’’ as they are called, when the busi- 
ness consists, not. of haranguing the pupils, but in as- 
certaining the progress they have made.’ + 
Goldwin Smith, himself an engaging lecturer when 
he chose to appear before an audience, is not less 
urgent than Wordsworth. Writing to Professor Nor- 
ton in 1869, he says: 
‘T try to keep him [the President of Cornell Univer- 
sity] from spending more money in flashy public lec- 
tures (of which we have far too many already) and 
other unsubstantial things, and to get him to turn all 
his resources, limited as they are, to the provision of 
means for hard work... . 
‘Curtis and Lowell come to lecture next term. I 
regard their arrival socially with unmixed: pleasure ; 
academically with mixed feelings. They will both be 
most brilliant I have no doubt; and the more brilliant 
they are, the less inclined our boys will be after hear- 
ing them to go back to the hard work by which alone 
any solid results can be attained. .. . The lesson of 
thorough, hard study is the one which these people 
have to learn. They will listen to Curtis, Lowell, and 
Dwight generalizing on their respective subjects, with- 
out knowing any of the facts on which the general- 
izations are based, and go away fancying themselves 
on a level with the most advanced thought of the 
age.’ ? 
The estimate of the Swiss jurist and university 
professor, Carl Hilty, is equally forcible:

‘Finally, in this enumeration of the things which 
waste one’s time, I may add that one must not per- 
mit himself to be overburdened with superfluous 
tasks. There are in our day an infinite number of 
these—correspondence, committees, reports, and, not 
the least, lectures. All of them take time, and it is 
extremely probable that nothing will come of them. 
When the Apostle Paul was addressing the Athen- 
ians, he remarked that they did nothing else than 
to hear some new thing. It was not the serious part 
of his address, or its spiritual quickening, to which 
they gave their attention; it was its novelty. And 
the outcome of his sermon was simply that some 
mocked, and the most friendly said with patronizing 
kindness: ‘‘We will hear thee again of this matter.’’ 
Indeed, the reporter of the incident finds it neces- 
sary to mention expressly that one member of the 
Athenian city-council, and one woman, in the audi- 
ence received some lasting good from the Apostle’s 
address. How is it, let me ask you, with yourselves? 
Have the lectures which you have heard been to you 
in any way positive influences of insight and deci- 
sion, or have they been merely the evidences of the 
speaker’s erudition ?’+ 
Far too much of our university instruction is given 
in the form of lectures, and this seems especially de- 
plorable when we think how few of the lecturers have 
such a mastery of their subjects as would enable 
them to fill chairs in the European universities. 
There is too little self-activity on the part of the

CHEAP TEACHING Is POOR 225 
student, who does not like to be passive (though he 
is not unwilling to be entertained), and naturally 
turns to the ‘student activities’-—to football, to the 
glee-club, to the editorial desk of the college paper— 
in order to find something to do that he deems worthy 
of a man with a backbone. Furthermore, the larger 
the audience, the more the lecturer must descend to 
their level if he wishes to gain attention. This is a 
cheap kind of teaching, measured in dollars and 
cents at the office of the university treasurer; it is 
obviously cheaper to pay one man five thousand 
dollars a year to lecture to fifteen hundred students 
three times a week than to pay even very modest 
salaries to one hundred scholars who would teach 
those students properly. But lecturing saps the 
energy of a good teacher (one who is not bent on 
amusing), and is of small permanent value to the 
student who desires knowledge of his own. 
The remedy, of course, calls for an outlay of money 
beyond anything the American people thus far has 
been willing to grant for education—aside from the 
erection of school and university buildings. But 
our recent contact with foreign nations, the experi- 
ence of our soldiers in France after the armistice, 
the glimpses they have had of the French educa- 
tional system, may have opened the eyes of America 
to the wisdom of liberal expenditures for the true 
ends of a university or college. The French dis- 
burse money for teaching rather than buildings. The 
French throughout the war kept up their instruc- 
tion in the German language as before, well aware
-P-A-G-E-236
  226 WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
that French, German, and Latin are among the neces- 
sary tools of scholarship, and must be paid for. 
War may alter sentiments, but cannot change intel- 
lectual facts. Instead of attacking the study of Ger- 
man in this country, we should attack the Conti- 
nental method of teaching by lectures; there is not 
the least doubt that it came to us from Germany 
rather than France—though the French also depend 
too much upon lectures in their system of higher 
education. 
II. A Rerorm iv THE Meruops or RecRuITING 
Facuuties 
In the American college and university, with few 
exceptions, the methods employed in recruiting the 
faculty are not the best. In almost every case the 
choice of a new instructor or professor rests with 
some one administrative officer, and not in the main 
with a committee of scholars. Too often the selec- 
tion of a professor depends upon his ability to give 
a popular lecture; and upon the impression he makes 
in two or three—or even one—of these. But there 
is no established procedure; and there should be one, 
clearly understood and always followed. Here we 
should imitate the plan that is pursued in the Conti- 
nental universities, but in only a very few institu- 
tions in America. The record of a candidate for a 
professorship should be fully investigated; every 
line he has written should be read by a committee 
of men proficient in the special field he represents, 
and at least one or two men from other fields.
-P-A-G-E-237
  METHODS OF RECRUITING FACULTIES 997 
Particularly vicious is our way of adding to the 
staff at the bottom of the list. Instructors are se- 
lected in the most haphazard fashion. An instructor 
in English will be taken on because he can turn out 
a clever jingle of verses, or because he has read Ibsen 
and Strindberg, or because he wears tailor-made 
clothes and shines in society. If the university is 
the faculty, a more or less permanent body, rather 
than the students, who continually change, nothing 
can be of greater importance than the training of 
the men who are to become instructors, or in the end 
professors, and a rigorous, even heart-breaking, se- 
lection of the fit. In these days of enlightenment, 
we should no longer wink at the appointment of a 
university instructor, overnight, who does not pos- 
sess the doctoral degree, and does not bid fair to be- 
come a productive scholar. 
The last statement is not meant to suggest that the 
mere presence of the letters ‘Ph.D.’ after a man’s 
name entitles him to become a university teacher, 
any more than the letters ‘B.A.’ in the same posi- 
tion indicate that a man is fit for life. Character in 
every instance is the thing that counts. Yet ‘Bache- 
lor of Arts’ ought to imply some special fitness for 
life—otherwise the degree represents a falsehood. 
And ‘Doctor’ here means teacher, or it means noth- 
ing. Very likely we ought to require more than the 
doctorate of a candidate for a position as instruc- 
tor, but certainly not less. In any case, regarded 
even in the most superficial light, the doctoral de- 
gree tells us that its possessor has spent at least
-P-A-G-E-238
  228 WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
three years in preparation for a task which others 
would like to perform without training. That a man 
has wished for training, and has been able to bring 
his desire to its normal conclusion, is no trifling in- 
dication of his character. But if we observe our 
candidate more narrowly, and find him to be a man 
of original power, and well-trained in addition, we 
are sure to regard him more favorably than if he 
were a man, let us suppose, of the same natural abil- 
ity, but untrained, self-trained, or half-trained, in 
the subject he offered to teach. 
In estimating the relation between the training 
implied in the doctoral degree and the capacity to 
teach there is sometimes a difference of opinion. 
The properly interested outsider, such as an intelli- 
gent alumnus, dealing with all sorts and conditions 
of men in business, is prone to underrate the value 
of training for a particular position in the univer- 
sity. But the person whose vital concern for years 
has been the problem of bettering the teaching of 
English in the preparatory school and the univer- 
sity will neither overrate nor underrate it. I fully 
agree with any one who thinks that the ideal man 
for the undergraduate college (and for the gradu- 
ate school, too, and for every other stage of educa- 
tion as well) is the ‘creative teacher.’ But if this 
means to any one the untrained, rather than the 
well-trained, genius, there we part company. What 
Kenyon Cox said of painters may be applied to the 
art of teaching : ‘Ignorance was never yet creative.’* 
*See my Methods and Aims in the Study of Literature, p. 19.
-P-A-G-E-239
  TRAINED UNIVERSITY TEACHERS 229 
In selecting and preparing teachers, however, we 
need not reckon with heaven-sent geniuses. We must 
take the better among the candidates for this pro- 
fession, and must try to cultivate such powers as 
they have, on the principle that good capacity can 
be brought ‘to real effectiveness only through rigor- 
ous discipline—such discipline as is demanded on 
the Continent of Europe of every university teacher. 
To this the only thing that with us in any fashion 
corresponds is the training for the doctorate. When 
we succeed in establishing a better kind of degree, 
or when we shall have raised the doctorate until it 
is always something better than it often is at pres- 
ent, then we can exact better credentials of our 
teachers. But credentials they must have, unless 
we choose to disclaim the principle that also governs 
the admission of younger students to an academic 
community. 
Unfortunately I am in the position of one who in 
saying the normal and sensible thing is likely to be 
accused of paradox; whereas it is the reverse of this 
sensible position that is paradoxical. It is not an 
‘aecident’ when a well-trained and productive scholar 
is a good teacher of undergraduates, or of children, 
either. Given the natural instinct, good teaching is 
the direct result of possessing real instead of second- 
hand knowledge; the result of contact with things 
themselves rather than with what is commonly said 
of them; the result of being familiar with reality, 
and not with shadows. If I may be allowed to say 
so, during my career as a professor of English I

never have let slip an opportunity to make the ac- 
quaintance of the most successful teachers of this 
subject; and it is my good fortune to know person- 
ally a number of the best in England, France, and 
Germany, as well as in this country. With excep- 
tions so rare as to be negligible, the best teachers of 
English have done the sort of work that leads to the 
doctorate, mostly hold the corresponding degree, and 
have continued all their lives to be productive schol- 
ars. It is the exception, however, that is more easily 
remembered, and the remembrance too often is al- 
lowed to interfere with general plans for education; 
the more reason, therefore, for our cleaving to the 
normal. I happen to have gained direct information 
concerning what are probably the best two under- 
graduate courses in Shakespeare given in America; in 
each case the teacher is a man well-known for his pro- 
ficiency in special research, who truly merits the 
name of productive scholar both for the effect of his 
teaching upon his pupils, and for the instruction and 
inspiration he affords to other teachers through his 
publications. The best teachers of Milton in this 
country are, as I believe, personally known to me, 
every one; and every one is a productive scholar. 
If there be men who have attained the highest suc- 
cess as teachers of English, and who yet have done 
nothing to instruct their peers, I have not heard of 
them, in spite of a persistent effort to discover such. 
Doubtless the average of anything human is not 
very good. The average physician is a charlatan, 
the average lawyer a pettifogger, the average clergy-
-P-A-G-E-241
RESEARCH IMPROVES THE TEACHER 231 
man a hypocrite, and so on; at least in the opinion 
of the world, which is partly right. And so, no 
doubt, the average scholar, so-called, is in some meas- 
ure a pedant, and the average possessor of the de- 
gree of Ph.D. not good enough for a first-class uni- 
versity. But for the average pedagogue who aspires 
to the name of university teacher, and does not hold 
that degree, we have no pleasant epithet. Fortu- 
nately, however, ‘the average’ has no real existence. 
Every one is an individual, with an independent 
value. Yet nothing could be more cruel than to en- 
courage men to go into the university career, if they 
have not spirit enough, and common sense enough, 
and higher intelligence enough, to secure three years 
of special, unimpeded study under able instruction, 
after they have learned as much as an undergradu- 
ate knows of any subject at the end of his Senior 
year. The exceptional case, of which we hear more 
than its exceptional nature warrants, will not lack 
recognition in the American college. What lacks 
recognition is the general truth that a man never 
ean know too much about the subject he is teaching. 
The average American does not believe in first-hand 
knowledge outside the realm of what he can touch 
and see. Neither did the Englishman—before the 
recent upheaval. What lacks recognition is the truth 
that you cannot take the right attitude to a study, 
nor have the right sentiments about it, if you have 
not studied the subject for yourself from every angle. 
But why must one defend truths that are axiomatic? 
In no other civilized country would the obvious in- 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
  232 WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
terrelation of knowledge and power, training and 
success, normal procedure and character, be seriously 
questioned, 
Nor, to dwell upon a matter alluded to before, is 
there any reason for admitting instructors to the 
faculty on terms essentially different from those on 
which we admit students to the university. We have 
specific requirements for the entering Freshman. 
These requirements might be more simple and rigor- 
ous, and there is a movement on foot to make them 
so; they at least suggest that something definite 
should be expected of those whom we might call en- 
tering instructors. At present we have our choice 
between requiring the doctoral degree of them, or 
something short of it—not something different. 
As for scholarly publication, in the long run it is 
the sign of a deep, abiding interest in one’s subject, 
and of a desire for the welfare of humanity; the 
abuse of it for purposes of self-advertisement affords 
no basis for argument against the thing itself. In 
an institution where the administrative officers let it 
be known that the instructor or assistant professor 
who does not publish need not hope for advance- 
ment, there may be, together with much useful in- 
vestigation, a certain amount of mere mechanical 
research and forced publication, but the evil is far 
outweighed by the good. Even the man who engages 
in research under compulsion is more likely than 
not ere long to become interested in what he is doing. 
In the few American universities where this policy 
is strictly adhered to, the results have been alto-
-P-A-G-E-243
SCHOLARLY PUBLICATION 233 
gether satisfactory. There is no danger of excessive 
productivity in scholarship. Every one who is famil- 
iar with the educational institutions of Europe must 
perceive that there are far too many teachers in our 
American universities who are not playing the game 
they have affected to enter—the game they have 
chosen for the one life that has been vouchsafed to 
them. They have embarked upon a career which in 
our time calls for several sorts of activity; yet 
through timidity and indolence, partly due to lack 
of training, and through lack of incentive, they fail 
in one essential respect; and they know it. The man 
who honestly looks into his own heart will say: ‘TI 
am aware that whenever I cease to study and pub- 
lish, my vitality as a teacher diminishes, and I do 
not respect myself when I am not playing the game.’ 
‘We must disabuse ourselves of any belief to the 
contrary. There is little hope for the improvement 
of American scholarship so long as people deceive 
themselves, pretending that on the whole the best 
scholars are not the best teachers—an error that is 
not borne out by the facts. 
III. A Rerorm THRovueH THE REDUCTION or NUMBERS 
The schools of antiquity, founded by Plato and Aris- 
totle, and continued by their successors, existed for the 
select few and not for the many. They did not exist 
for the select few in the sense that the students came 
from ‘any particular class of society, or constituted a 
social élite; no one was denied admittance so long as
-P-A-G-E-244
234 WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
he possessed great mental capacity. What counted was 
the desire for knowledge and the ability to acquire it. 
The few, the intellectual aristocracy, were sifted from 
the many. In the later Middle Ages, the universities 
which arose in Italy and France, and, in the early 
Renaissance, the universities which arose in Germany 
and England under the influence of the Italian and 
French foundations, were again for the few and not 
for the many ; though often attended by great numbers 
of students, they, again, made possible the existence 
of an intellectual aristocracy drawn—by a process of 
natural selection, sifted—from the population as a 
whole. The individual teacher sometimes gloried in 
the size of his following of pupils, though in general 
he took pride rather in the development of some few 
leading minds, or of two or three, or perhaps one. The 
size of the university, the attendance at any one place, 
was a matter of no special significance. 
In this country, the desire for numbers and external 
superiority has resulted in a very unsatisfactory con- 
dition. Of course the number of students in all the 
colleges and universities of America constitutes but a 
small proportion of the population as a whole. Never- 
theless, the men and women in attendance at these 
institutions do not consist of the select few; they do 
not make up an aristocracy of intellect; they are mere 
samples of the many. The method and means of sort- 
ing are so inadequate or so lax that the university has 
become a place where the man of average capacity 
feels at home. The indifference or derision shown by 
the mass of university students toward those who, 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  
THE REDUCTION OF NUMBERS 235 
through intellectual superiority coupled with diligence, 
secure an election to the society of Phi Beta Kappa, 
or to other honorary groups, is very significant. A 
man comes to a particular university because his father 
or his uncle once was a student there; or because his 
brother belonged to such and such a fraternity there; 
or because he has reason to hope that he will become 
a member of the football or the baseball team. Or he 
comes because he expects definite training for a par- 
ticular vocation. With the exception of those of for- 
eign birth or blood—for example, the children of 
Hebrew or Russian parents—almost no students come 
with the expectation of attaining eminence in the con- 
cerns of the mind. 
With the growth of numbers and the decline of intel- 
lectual standards it has come about that a large pro- 
portion of the actual teaching is done by underpaid 
and inexperienced instructors and assistants, who 
never will rise to a commanding height in this profes- 
sion. As in the preparatory school, so in the univer- 
sity, many of the teachers have not the persistence to 
learn their craft. Yesterday the man was clerk in a 
bank; to-day he is instructor in a college; to-morrow 
he will be an insurance-agent, or an amateur farmer, 
or he will accept a position with a publisher to write 
letters urging the adoption of text-books for classes in 
English composition. The result is that, instead of 
being in the hands of talented, enthusiastic, well-dis- 
ciplined masters, far too many classes are in the situa- 
tion of bodies undergoing dissection at the hands of 
medical students in the first year of anatomy.
-P-A-G-E-246
  236 WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
I may illustrate these strictures with the gist of a 
valuable report made ten years ago by the dean of the 
graduate school in an American university. It is not 
desirable to specify the particular institution, condi- 
tions there having slightly altered for the better in the 
mean time. Yet nowhere have they altered to such an 
extent as to rob the report of significance ; it represents 
the general drift of university education in America 
for twenty years or more before the recent war; since 
then, the value of salaries has declined, and casual 
increase of stipends here and there has by no means 
restored their purchasing power. 
According to the report, it is often said that the only 
limit to the growth of a university, even without an 
increase in its endowment, is the one set by the 
capacity of its class-rooms and laboratories. The 
figures show that the university in question has nearly 
reached the point where that statement is justified. 
Should the present tendency continue, and the average 
salary of all teachers—professors, assistant professors, 
instrugtors, and assistants—fall from $1190 to $1070, 
the salary of each additional teacher will be paid by 
the tuition of the additional students who make his 
presence necessary. But the growth of the university 
will necessitate a further decrease in the relative num- 
ber of professors and assistant professors, and an in- 
erease in that of instructors and assistants. If the 
percentage had remained the same for the preceding 
ten years, the university would now have 233 profes- 
sors instead of 189. Meanwhile an increase in the 
number of undergraduates adds to the burden of
-P-A-G-E-247
  NUMBERS AND ENDOWMENT 237 
administrative work, which falls upon the permanent 
members of ithe faculty, to the detriment of advanced 
study and research. The decrease in the relative num- 
ber of graduate students in the past ten years is almost 
exactly the same as the decrease in the percentage of 
professors and assistant professors. A further in- 
crease in the amount of undergraduate instruction will 
necessitate additional buildings and an expansion of 
material equipment. Without additional endowment 
there will necessarily be less pecuniary support for 
graduate study, and a general lowering of the standard. 
of instruction throughout the university. If an in- 
creased endowment for material growth should be 
obtained, we may still ask whether a university in 
which the average salary for teachers is $1070, and 
in which nearly half the instruction is in the hands 
of temporary assistants with a salary of $500 or less, 
is the type of institution we are willing to accept as 
our ideal. One might do more for the cause of educa- 
tion by aiming to make one’s institution the best in 
the country, rather than the largest. 
A few of our universities are in better case than 
the one for which this report was made; more, prob- 
ably, in worse; the average doubtless in pretty much 
the situation here described. Better or worse as the 
case may be, virtually every one of them is, so to 
speak, student-poor, and instructor-poor—as we call a 
man ‘land-poor’ when he has thousands of acres, and 
can barely pay the taxes. In our higher education, we 
have reversed the sentence of the New Testament: 
‘Many are called, but few are chosen.’ Our institu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  38 WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
tions of higher learning accept the many, and ignore 
the few who have a right to be there. With a large 
actual income, or at all events with income enough to 
do certain things well, each and every university is 
more or less impecunious. If we are to have better 
scholarship, drastic measures must be taken to make 
our relatively small means relatively great. We must 
either secure (not hope for) more money, or we must 
have fewer students, or, far better, we must have more 
money and fewer students. ‘Turn it how you will, 
manipulate it as you will, the few, as Cardinal New- 
man well says, can never mean the many.’ 
In A Letter to a Noble Lord, Edmund Burke draws 
the rather obvious distinction between parsimony 
and economy. However obvious it may be, it has 
escaped practical application by the practical Ameri- 
ean people in the realm of university finance: 
‘It may be new to his grace, but I beg leave to tell 
him that mere parsimony is not economy. It is separ- 
able in theory from it; and in fact it may, or it may 
not, be a part of economy, according to circumstances, 
Expense, and great expense, may be an essential 
part in true economy. If parsimony were to be con- 
sidered as one of the kinds of that virtue, there is, 
however, another and a higher economy. Economy 
is a distributive virtue, and consists, not in saving, 
but in selection. Parsimony requires no providence, 
no sagacity, no powers of combination, no compari- 
son, no-judgment. Mere instinct, and that not an 
instinct of the noblest kind, may produce this false 
economy in perfection. The other economy has

larger views. It demands a discriminating judg- 
ment, and a firm, sagacious mind. It shuts one door 
to impudent importunity, only to open another, and 
a wider, to unpresuming merit.’ + 
IV. An Enpowep Press ror THE ADVANCEMENT 
or LEARNING 
In the recent European crisis, and the troubles 
that still continue, humane scholarship abroad has 
been everywhere depressed, and in some parts utterly 
paralyzed. The great English and Continental uni- 
versities have been well-nigh empty of students; 
groups of masterly teachers have been dispersed; 
and many young men who would have been leaders 
in the promotion of learning are now lifelong inva- 
lids, or are in their graves. Printing-presses have 
stopped, the publication of scholarly works has 
dwindled, and learned periodicals are threatened 
with extinction. Between the declaration of war 
and December 31, 1914, two hundred and twenty 
men from the Oxford Press had joined the British 
army. Such being the state of affairs in Europe, a 
great opportunity, and a momentous responsibility, 
confront the United States of America; upon our 
scholars, and upon those who maintain them, are 
devolving, to an extent which no one could have fore- 
seen, the future of liberal learning throughout the 
world. It is manifestly our part to do more than 
ever before for learning while scholarship lan-

guishes abroad; and, now that the war is over, we 
have an essential function to perform in restoring 
unity in the higher life of nations. 
But at all times two main problems beset the 
higher, humane scholarship in America. First, there 
is the question (which has not been properly solved) 
of the ordinary expenses of scholars as men—how 
are they to be supported in freedom from anxiety 
for the morrow, so that they may possess the re- 
quisite courage and free energy for their special 
services to the community and the State? Secondly, 
there is the question of expense connected with all 
research and publication that necessitate pecuniary 
outlay, and promise no pecuniary return within a 
lifetime, or involve ultimate loss; for in America 
the works that are most valuable to the scholar can- 
not be supported on the basis of sales. Of course, 
these two questions are interdependent, since the 
economy of a scholar’s life and the economy of 
scholarship are one; but at present we may concern 
ourselves with the second question, and in the main 
with one side of that. What is the best way to solve 
the problem of publication? 
The proposal here made is that some man of wealth, 
and of good will toward the nation and mankind, be 
induced to endow a press for the advancement, through 
the publication of meritorious scholarly works, of those 
branches of learning which are most clearly essential 
to American culture, and which are properly known 
as the humanities; let there be an establishment upon 
American soil to perform in this country the service 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
     A PRESS FOR THE HUMANITIES 241 
which that greatest of European agencies for enlight- 
enment, the Clarendon Press, has hitherto performed 
in England. Specifically, let the new press be founded 
first of all for the sake of scholarly researches and 
indispensable works of reference in the field of the 
vernacular—of our English and American language 
and literature; but let it exist also for similar works 
in fields adjacent and disciplines fundamental to this, 
such as the Greek and Latin languages and literatures, 
and, among other modern subjects, the Italian, Span- 
ish, and French; together with ancient and medieval 
history and philosophy, Biblical studies, pure mathe- 
matics, and astronomy. The development of great 
publishing concerns in Europe shows that it is advis- 
able to begin with publications in some more restricted 
field of knowledge or effort, and subsequently to ex- 
tend the range of activities. Thus the Clarendon Press 
at Oxford began by specializing in the printing of the 
Bible, and the Cambridge University Press with the 
English Prayer Book. Accordingly, this American 
University Press would begin by caring for the human- 
ities. 
Still more specifically, such a press could take up 
the publication of works like those now to be sug- 
gested. The works of a number of important authors 
have never been properly edited as a whole; among 
these authors, strange as it may seem, are Milton and 
Burke. But an endowed press might well engage also 
in publishing lexicons for particular periods in the 
history of the English language, concordances to indi- 
vidual poets, researches into secular and ecclesiastical     
  
-P-A-G-E-252
  242 WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
history, studies in the history and theory of poetry 
and the other fine arts, and facsimiles of ancient and 
medieval manuscripts; and in reprinting valuable 
early books which are now in private collections, or 
are otherwise inaccessible to students. 
The stress here laid upon English, the ancient 
classics, and Romance languages and literatures, is 
justified upon several grounds. First, special studies 
in these departments, while they are of the utmost 
importance to the culture of our nation in view of 
its antecedents, are likely to be, as they have been, 
neglected in comparison with studies in agriculture, 
the mechanic arts, and the like. It is difficult for 
many, though not all, of those who are engaged in 
practical affairs to discern the advantage of the higher 
cultivation of humane studies to the country at large; 
and it is therefore quite necessary that such studies 
should not depend for their maintenance upon the 
opinion of the many. 
Secondly, it is generally conceded that the Church, 
or at any rate the evangelical denominations, some 
time ago began to lose the educational influence which 
the Protestant organizations once possessed. Accord- 
ingly, humane scholarship, which has always been 
closely allied with the Christian religion, should now 
be promoted in every conceivable way as an indirect 
but powerful instrument in upholding the spiritual 
life of the nation. 
Thirdly, it must be clear to an unbiased observer 
that, through a period of years which we hope is now 
ending, the sums of money which have been available
-P-A-G-E-253
  PURE SCHOLARSHIP IS NEEDY 243 
in this country for the advancement of research in 
medicine and applied science, while not unduly large 
in themselves, have been out of proportion to the 
meagre sums obtainable for the welfare of humane 
studies. Thus we have millions of dollars donated to 
aid in the discovery of a cure for cancer; expensive 
laboratories for research in chemistry, in physics— 
in almost every field where investigation may con- 
tribute to bodily health and comfort, or to ease of 
transportation and communication for the ends of 
commerce. But bodily health and the like, though we 
may sometimes regard them as good things in them- 
selves, do, after all, become really valuable only when 
they make possible a life that is higher than that of 
mere animal existence. Consequently, provision must 
be made for the human activities without which the 
health and comfort of the body are futile. Such a 
press as we have been describing would do more to 
stimulate these activities than any other imaginable 
device. 
It should be added that, in America at the present 
time, pure science in physics, chemistry, and' the like, 
fares better than pure mathematics, and that the 
sciences which are not strictly humane fare better 
than pure scholarship. The Carnegie Institution of 
Washington, it is true, contrary to the usual opinion, 
has not entirely lost sight of the humanities; see, for 
example, the concordances of Spenser, Keats, and 
Horace, in its list of publications. Yet the experience 
of that Institution itself shows the need of an en- 
dowed press for the exclusive end we are discussing.
-P-A-G-E-254
  244 | WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
In the year 1916 the Carnegie Institution had an in- 
come of but $50,000 for publications of all sorts. An 
income of several times that amount for subsidizing 
publications in humane scholarship would not be more 
than enough to start with, in the enterprise here recom- 
mended. The sum of £5,000 was contributed to the 
Clarendon Press by the Worshipful Company of Gold- 
smiths towards the production of Volume VI (con- 
taining the letters L, M, and N) of the great Oxford 
Dictionary of the English Language; this sum, nearly 
one-half the said income of the Carnegie Institution, 
did not suffice, it would seem, for the cost of that 
single volume—one volume out of ten. 
One cogent reason for the establishment of a press 
with ample funds for scholarly undertakings is the 
high cost of superior printing in this country. Under 
normal conditions in England the price of high-grade 
printer’s composition may be estimated at one-half the 
price in America; and good printing is as cheap or 
cheaper on the Continent. This assertion is based 
upon a comparison of the estimates submitted by Eng- 
lish, Continental, and American firms for scholarly 
works that have come under the immediate notice of 
the present writer ; it is borne out by the testimony of 
American publishers, who confess that they dare not 
venture in such enterprises with the freedom ordi- 
narily shown by publishing-houses in Great Britain 
and Germany. In Germany, before the war, humane 
scholarship was on a solid pecuniary basis, the cost of 
printing being low, and good scholars being numerous 
enough to create an adequate demand for published
-P-A-G-E-255
  MEAGRE INCOMES OF SCHOLARS 245 
investigations of a non-popular sort; in England the 
inherited ‘or accumulated wealth of the great univer- 
sity presses, and of a few long-established private con- 
cerns, has encouraged scholarly publication in a high 
degree. Furthermore, in both England and Germany 
the pecuniary rewards of the scholarly life are greater 
than in this country; university salaries are larger, 
and living expenses (in time of peace) are lower; and 
hence the scholar himself has on occasion been able to 
supply a subvention for a non-popular work which he 
wished to give to the world for the sake of a small 
number of his fellows whose need of it was great. 
In America the poverty of scholars is proverbial. 
Nine out of ten students who enroll for the humani- 
ties in the graduate school are poor; and when they 
reach the goal of their efforts, and become, let us 
say, university professors, their incomes are so poor 
as to excite the commiseration of their brethren in 
the universities of Europe. Of course, the main re- 
wards of the scholarly life are not pecuniary. And 
it is a pernicious state of affairs when young men 
and women are imbued with the notion that, as 
special students, they deserve to be paid—in ‘schol- 
arships’ and ‘fellowships’; it is a notion we fre- 
quently observe in the graduate school. They should 
not be ‘paid’—and yet scholarship must be sup- 
ported, and the scholar must be free from worldly 
care. Similarly, the ripe productive scholar must 
not expect to be paid in full, with coin, for his in- 
vestigations—and yet scholarly research must be 
supported, and scholarly publication, not merely 
17
-P-A-G-E-256
  246 WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
made possible, but directly encouraged. So it has 
always been when humane scholarship has flourished. 
So it was in Greece when the investigations of 
Aristotle were aided by the princely Alexander. 
So it was at Alexandria under the Ptolemies. So 
it was in the Renaissance, when modern scholarship 
began in the Italian cities under the protection and 
encouragement of the ruling houses and certain of 
the popes. And so will it always be. So must it be 
in America, where, under the conditions of a de- 
mocracy, the State will tend to advance the interests 
of the common schools, of industrial education, and 
of agriculture; and where the higher scholarship, 
if it is to thrive at all, must depend upon judicious 
but ample, nay generous, benefactions from men of 
wealth and insight. 
Here follow a number of suggestions respecting 
the organization and activity of the proposed uni- 
versity press. 
The endowment for the publication of books 
should be proportionately very large—five times the 
amount of endowment for the salaries of officers, 
elerical assistance, and the like, for the necessary 
buildings, and for the machinery of manufacture. 
But the press should have funds enough for the best 
material equipment, for the employment of the best 
skilled workmen, and for the payment of experts 
whose advice might from time to time be sought out- 
side the immediate staff.
-P-A-G-E-257
  SUGGESTIONS FOR A PRESS 247 
The press should make a point of developing the 
taste of the country in matters of typography, paper, 
and binding. 
Those who were called upon to organize the press 
would do well to study the history of the great 
Italian publishing-houses in the Renaissance, and of 
their followers in other lands, and the history, organ- 
ization, and present methods of the Clarendon Press, 
and, after that, the methods of other university 
presses, including those connected with Yale Uni- 
versity and the University of Chicago. 
Two kinds of experts would be needed in working 
out the details of organization—men of experience 
in finance, and a number of superior productive 
scholars. The experts on the scholarly side should, 
above all, not be drawn from the class of university 
professors who have produced little or nothing of a 
scholarly sort. They should be known for lives of 
industry in linguistic, literary, and historical re- 
search. 
From these business men and these scholars there 
should be selected a business head or president, a 
secretary or editor, and an advisory board. 
The press should be ready to accept works of merit 
from any source, and in time might itself originate 
them. Its first publications should be of the highest 
quality and importance, irrespective of the source. 
But in general it might aim to provide a channel for
-P-A-G-E-258
  248 + WAYS OF IMPROVING SCHOLARSHIP 
those American universities and colleges of high 
rank that have no adequate outlet for the publica- 
tions of their scholars. In time it might become the 
centre of organization for all, or many, of the par- 
ticular university presses throughout the country. 
The most important scholarly press in the world 
has been several times mentioned in the foregoing 
paragraphs—the Clarendon Press, at Oxford, Eng- 
land. It derives its name from Edward Hyde, Earl 
of Clarendon, 1608-1674, who contributed to the 
foundation. The history of that press serves to indi- 
cate how a man of wealth and public spirit could 
perpetuate his good name, and confer an inealeu- 
lably great benefit upon the higher life of our own 
nation, by providing the funds for a press that should 
rival the one at Oxford.

A writer in the Nation, commenting upon the 
doctoral degree in English, quotes with a slight in- 
accuracy a passage, on the aim of literary study, 
which (so he says) may serve ‘as the creed of the

kind consent of the editor. The principal changes occur at the

humanist.?+ The quotation may as well be given 
correctly : 
‘What, now, is the aim of literary study? Since 
literature is a liberal art, its function must be in 
some way connected with liberty; and since the study 
of literature belongs among the humanities, it must, 
if properly pursued, tend to make the student more 
humane; that is, more thoughtful, more reverent, 
and more fearless—more wise, sympathetic, and just. 
As a liberal art, poetry helps to free us from the 
slavery of fear; as a humane art, it disentangles us 
from the bestial part of our natures, and renders us 
more like the best and happiest, the most typical, 
men.” 
It would seem from the context in the Nation that 
the sentiments were drawn from the writings of 
Wordsworth; but in reality the passage is mine, and 
may be found preceding an authentic quotation from 
Wordsworth on page 55 of my Methods and Aims in 
the Study of Literature—a volume the general tend- 
ency of which is not in accord with the drift of the 
article by our alleged ‘humanist.’ 
Since my creed, or a part of it, has the sanction 
of this amiable writer, and is accepted by him as a 
basic ideal for the training of teachers of English, 
it seems proper to look into his subsidiary conten- 
tions; and the more so because his utterances echo 
what a number of well-intentioned persons of late 
have been thinking or saying, and will evoke the ap- 
plause of men who, through an imperfect induction

  A MISTAKEN ‘HUMANIST’ 251 
into scholarship, cannot perceive the eternal bond 
subsisting between scholarly (that is, scientific) in- 
vestigation and the ennoblement of humane learn- 
ing. 
His main positions, subsidiary to his ‘creed,’ are 
these. There is a class of men called investigators, 
who control the studies leading to the doctoral de- 
gree, and compel the graduate student in English to 
busy himself with the Middle Ages, and with the 
earlier stages of the language, to the neglect, on the 
one hand, of modern literature, and, on the other, of 
those classical studies which are known as the hu- 
manities. Since English literature is said to begin 
with Chaucer, and since Chaucer apparently belongs 
to the Renaissance rather than to the Middle Ages, 
we may set aside the study of Old English, and of 
medieval sources, as not pertinent to the needs of 
the day. Above all, we may omit medieval studies 
from the course of the graduate student who prom- 
ises to be a man of literary taste, and whose finer 
aspirations may be killed by forced preoccupation 
with research. An opportunity should be given to 
this kind of student to write a dissertation upon some 
topic that does not require investigation of the sort 
hitherto expected of all candidates for the doctoral 
degree. (No clear conception appears regarding the 
type of subject upon which he actually should write; 
yet the inference is legitimate that he may substitute 
for the results of investigation his own chance re- 
action to a modern author, or his own combination of 
the thoughts of others upon some literary question
-P-A-G-E-262
  252 | THE DOCTORAL DEGREE IN ENGLISH 
that has awakened his interest, or even that he might 
submit a specimen of his own creation, spun from 
his inner consciousness, in the way of literary art.) 
In any case, it is held, the dissertation should be 
original, should constitute the most weighty part of 
his work for the degree, and should not be a piece of 
useless ‘German’ scholarship. 
‘With as many of these positions as are half-truths 
the man of sense will find himself half-way in agree- 
ment. One is justified in deploring the excessive 
over-emphasis (where it really exists) upon linguis- 
tics, for those who are not to give their lives to 
linguistic research; the study of the Middle Ages, 
and of the classics, too, where that study is unre- 
lated to the inner life of the present; the direction 
of research, and the pursuit of it, by those who lack 
perspective; the acquisition of the doctoral degree 
in English by men who cannot develop a tolerable 
English style; and the inferior quality of some of 
the dissertations that are accepted by one or another 
university. 
If our amiable ‘humanist’ spoke for himself alone, 
there would be no need of assailing his positions in 
so far as they are not tenable. But he has made 
himself the mouthpiece for a number of critics who 
have not thought out the problem to be faced by the 
teacher of special students in English, and who 
nevertheless are outspoken in denouncing recent 
methods of advanced study. It is therefore desir- 
able to consider the views which he represents, and 
the subject upon which he has written.
-P-A-G-E-263
  A FALSE DISTINCTION 253 
First of all, he makes a distinction between the 
dilettante, the investigator, and the humanist. But 
the distinction is false. The great investigators in 
language and literature have been humanists, and the 
great humanists have been systematic scholars and in- 
vestigators; examples readily suggest themselves, from 
Dante and Petrarch down to Boeckh and Ten Brink 
and Gaston Paris, and the leading American scholars 
of our own day. For clarity of thought we need an 
Aristotelian distinction embracing a desirable mean 
and two undesirable extremes, the one more undesir- 
able than the other—thus: (1) the dilettante, or senti- 
mentalist; (2) the pedant; (3) the scholar, represent- 
ing the golden mean—the investigating humanist. Of 
the vicious extremes, the sentimentalist, possessing a 
naive or a sophistical eloquence, or a specious show 
of breadth, yet deficient in scientific curiosity, in exact 
knowledge, and in a real power of generalization, will 
be more acceptable to the crowd. The pedant may be 
useful, at least to the investigating humanist; for the 
pedant will hew wood and draw water, and something 
may be done with what he collects. 
‘Whence comes the notion that scientific research is 
not humane, or that there is any kind of study, ration- 
ally conducted, that is not scientific? Certainly not 
from an examination of the lives and activities of in- 
quiring men. Plato was the central figure of a group 
of scientists and scholars.1 Aristotle, whose place as 
leader in the study of poetry and rhetoric is still

254 THE DOCTORAL DEGREE IN ENGLISH 
secure, was a biologist; he, too, was the centre of a 
group, some of whom did a great deal of intellectual 
hewing of wood and drawing of water for him; while 
he himself never disdained to share in these funda- 
mental labors. Nor may any scholar, ‘humanist,’ or 
doctor of philosophy wisely pass a lifetime without 
often undertaking the simplest inductions, As to lan- 
guage and literature, Dante was the first of modern 
investigators—in the service of poetry. And Milton, 
great poet that he was, eschewed neither the humbler 
nor the higher tasks of scholarship. Not to speak of 
his collections for a Latin thesaurus, or to track him 
far in his varied scientific and scholarly pursuits 
(every one of them reflected in his poetry), we may 
note his geographical work on Muscovy as an example 
of integration from original sources, And his History 
of Britain in itself is a reply to those who would 
exclude the period of Old English (the writer in the 
Nation calls it ‘Anglo-Saxon’+) from the studies nec- 
essary to a qualified teacher of our language and liter- 
ature. Was Professor Child of Harvard less human, 
or more human, for his monumental work on the Eng- 
lish and Scottish ballads? The sentimentalist comes 
short of full humanity in not recognizing the great 
human law of obedience to the facts. The pedant (not 
the humble scholar, fired with a love of humanity, and 
therefore laying the lowliest duties upon his heart) is 
inhuman because he lacks philosophy. The scholar, 
the humane investigator, is faithful in little things,

  THE PRIMA PHILOSOPHIA 255 
and, with the help of that prima philosophia recom- 
mended by Francis Bacon, he also rises to an elevation 
from which he can survey details in a right perspective. 
Though America has had few examples of industry 
to match the unwearied application of a Littré or a 
Grimm, a Migne or a Rohde, or many another Con- 
tinental scholar, what our teaching of English mainly 
wants, if I mistake not, is this ‘first philosophy’ that 
enables a man to rise above the level of the study in 
which he engages, so as to relate the details to one 
another, and the whole to the scholarship of his time 
and all times. The defect, evinced in many ways, is 
notable in our mishandling of general terms, such as 
‘science,’ ‘investigation,’ and ‘philology,’ which are 
employed with some unconscious restriction, while the 
writer thinks he is generalizing. And the cure? For 
the aspirant to the doctoral degree in English the cure 
is to be found in the Encyklopadie of Boeckh and the 
systematic treatises on the study of language and liter- 
ature that have followed it; the work is better known 
in France than here, and to the humanists than to the 
narrower students of language. 
All study is scientific, is methodical. All study is 
investigation—proceeding step by step. The first step 
consists in observing some one thing in particular. 
But doubtless too many of those who assume the direc- 
tion of graduate students are in haste to put the raw 
recruit in the advance-guard of scholarship. In the 
first year the recruit should learn the manual of arms 
—should investigate certain things that have already 
been studied to advantage. How crude, how unfur- 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  256 THE DOCTORAL DEGREE IN ENGLISH 
nished, he often is, in comparison with the product 
of a French lycée or of the Continental schools in gen- 
eral! We dare not consume too much of histime with 
matters that are not well-known to his precursors 
in the same field. The desire of such a student for 
discovery, for learning, can be satisfied in the acquisi- 
tion of first principles, most of them being new enough 
to him; with adroit instruction, he will assimilate and 
reconcile the great critical treatises of the ancients, of 
Aristotle and Horace, of Plato and Longinus, with the 
modern works of Sidney and Shelley. Examining 
these for himself and reporting what he finds, not 
hearing about them at second hand in lectures, he will 
make the principles live within himself by supplying 
illustrations from his own reading of masterpieces. 
This organization of his own knowledge is itself a 
scientific procedure. Even so, it is well to whet his 
desire by an occasional glimpse of the undiscovered 
country. Eventually he must have more. A qualified 
teacher of English needs the experience, at some time 
a prolonged one, of ascertaining and combining facts 
that have not been interpreted, in an untrodden realm 
where there is no escape from first-hand observation, 
comparison, and inference. He is to be a leader in 
the advancement of learning throughout the nation; 
he cannot become such without this experience, which 
is necessary to the development of a directing mind; 
if he is potentially unfit for a lofty calling, the sooner 
he is frightened out of it the better for him and his 
country. No man shall say that his soul has per- 
formed the exalted functions of a humanist until he
-P-A-G-E-267
RESEARCH IS INDISPENSABLE 257 
has endured the test of intellectual independence. 
Transcendent genius may include the quality of mind 
that is excited by research, without the actual experi- 
ence, though we do not know this; in Plato, Dante, and 
Milton, genius did not dispense with investigation. 
For the high degree of talent that we must demand of 
our teachers of English in the future, participation in 
research is indispensable. 
If we are to ennoble the doctorate in English, we 
may not proceed in vacuo, nor yet on the basis of sur- 
mise by men who are afraid of scholarship; we must 
build upon what has been accomplished by men of 
long experience in the training of graduate students. 
In order to improve on the past, we should first try to 
equal the best that has been done in this country, and 
in England, and on the Continent. This emulation 
involves a direct scrutiny of certain schools of the 
humanities and their leaders. If I may speak for my- 
self (since the critic gives my creed his approval), I 
have tried to formulate my demands on a candidate 
for the doctoral degree in English to some extent by 
abstracting and combining elements from the theory 
and practice of Yale University (as represented by 
Professor Albert S. Cook), of Harvard University (as 
represented by Professor George L. Kittredge), and, 
to go to the field of the ancient classics, of Johns Hop- 
kins (as represented by Professor Basil L. Gilder- 
sleeve); for from these three centres have issued 
humanizing influences that have been potent for good 
in the country at large; the teachers who owe their 
training to the three scholars mentioned have been
-P-A-G-E-268
  
258 THE DOCTORAL DEGREE IN ENGLISH 
marked by breadth of perspective, artistic precision of 
knowledge, and a disposition and ability to vitalize 
the forces of society. But in considering what we 
should expect of candidates for the doctorate, we still 
have something to learn from an elder generation also, 
from the generation of Child and March and Shedd, 
of Longfellow and Norton. 
We have something more to learn from the schol- 
ars of Great Britain and the Continent; which 
brings us to what is called ‘German’ scholarship. 
Every thoughtful observer has been well aware of 
the injury to humane studies in central Europe and 
elsewhere through the recent commercialization of 
applied science. But the objections to ‘German’ 
scholarship usually proceed from writers who have 
glanced at the titles of a few dissertations, who 
know almost nothing of the leading Continental 
scholars of whatever nation, and who have failed to 
note that the system of university training is virtu- 
ally uniform from Scandinavia to Sicily. The com- 
plaint, if made, should include the scholarship of 
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Flanders, and 
Switzerland—not to mention Austria and Russia. I 
suppose it should include the work of Menéndez y 
Pelayo in Spain and Pio Rajna in Italy! Nor does 
the average German scholarship in the narrower 
sense lie open to the strictures commonly passed on 
it—of pedantic dullness and! accuracy, and tame sub- 
mission. When poor, it may be charged rather with 
inaccuracy, and with forced hypothesis and frantic
-P-A-G-E-269
  ‘GERMAN’ SCHOLARSHIP 259 
generalization. But we are not considering the 
average—or what should we say of the average schol- 
arly output of the American professor of English or 
Latin? If we are thinking of classical scholarship 
in Holland, Germany, and Austria, it owes its spe- 
cial impetus for the last century and a half to Eng- 
land and Richard Bentley. Moreover, the German 
tendency to the organization of studies owes much 
to the French encyclopedists of the eighteenth cent- 
ury. 
The great tradition of scholarship, of humanism, 
goes back to Plato and Aristotle. The learning they 
bequeathed was developed, yet gradually dissevered 
from philosophy, in the Alexandrian age, but found 
a sort of unity again in Cicero, and again in Plu- 
tarch. It was kept alive in Europe in the earlier 
Middle Ages by the Benedictine monks, but throve 
in Arabia and Syria, and in Ireland and England; 
whence it returned to the Continent, first from Eng- 
land (as when Alcuin carried the learning of Bede 
and Egbert from the school at York to the court 
school of Charles the Great, and to the school at 
Tours), and then, in the later Middle Ages, through 
the Saracens, though rills had all along trickled in 
from Byzantium and Toledo; and, partly through 
influences from Byzantium, Greco-Roman culture 
was revived in Italy in the Renaissance, thence 
spreading northward. In the earlier Renaissance, 
the tradition was rather Latin and Ciceronian than 
Greek and Platonic. More recently—in Boeckh, for 
example—the Greek tradition reached a point of
-P-A-G-E-270
  260 THE DOCTORAL DEGREE IN ENGLISH 
culmination. Meanwhile the tradition of Biblical 
scholarship, originating in the Fathers, had never 
wholly failed, nor had the scholarly tradition of the 
Hebrew commentators. With the Reformation, at 
least in England, begins the history of a scholarship 
devoted to the modern vernacular literatures. Some- 
thing like an organization of this scholarship ap- 
pears in the latter half of the eighteenth century, 
at least for English literature; for Italy, both the 
beginnings (in the critical work of Dante), and the 
first efforts at organization, come earlier. But the 
organization proper of scholarship for the Germanic 
and Romance languages and literatures follows the 
synthetic work of Boeckh and his age for classical 
studies. Like the organization of classical and 
Biblical scholarship, it has centred in Germany and 
France, yet has been the accomplishment of Europe 
as a whole, the North building upon foundations 
laid by the South. 
Since the English have shown no special genius 
for the organization of studies, we must chiefly look 
to the Continent for sound traditions in rebasing 
our demands for the doctorate; reviewing the entire 
history of classical and Biblical scholarship, in order 
to plot the curve of development in English and sub- 
jects thereto related. Nor may the notable scholars 
in modern subjects, such as Ten Brink, Gaston Paris, 
and many others, be disregarded in our survey. 
Of course the dissertation should be our main re- 
quirement for the doctorate. Who has thought 
otherwise? But the nature of the thesis, the subject
-P-A-G-E-271
       THE REQUISITE DISSERTATION 261 
of the dissertation, cannot be wholly determined in 
advance; it will vary, not only with several types of 
mind, but with the needs and capacities of the indi- 
vidual student, so long as the fundamental habits of 
thoroughness and accuracy are not imperiled. Fur- 
thermore, the dissertation should not be useful only 
to the man who writes it, or only to him and his 
preceptor. If the subject is well-chosen and well- 
treated, the monograph will subserve the vital inter- 
ests of at least a few persons in this country, pos- 
sibly of more in Great Britain, and of yet more upon 
the Continent. The choice requires knowledge and 
imagination in the teacher. Here, again, the im- 
agination has excellent models in the best of the 
Yale Studies in English; of the Harvard Studies and 
Notes in Philology and Literature; of the mono- 
graphs produced by students of Professor Carleton 
Brown, Professor Manly, Professor Bright, and 
others. At Columbia University a great many excel- 
lent subjects have been hit upon. In England, we 
have the admirable series inspired by Professor Her- 
ford at Manchester, not to speak of the stimulating 
influence of Professor Ker, the late Dr. Furnivall, 
and many others. In France, the doctoral disserta- 
tion is the work of a more mature student than in 
Germany, appearing ten years or so after the author 
has become established as a teacher; such are the 
monographs produced by pupils of men like Beljame 
and Angellier, or frequently of classical scholars like 
the brothers Croiset. The German dissertation, com- 
monly written by a young man of wide reading, 
18  
-P-A-G-E-272
  262 THE DOCTORAL DEGREE IN ENGLISH 
does not often display or utilize his general attain- 
ments. It is too often perfunctory, too much sub- 
ordinated to other parts of his training. Yet very 
few are useless, and some are of great value; the 
quality has always differed in different universities. 
Of late, the topics suggested by Professor Kaluza at 
the University of Kénigsberg will bear inspection. 
In Denmark, under the same kind of training, the 
monographs written under the direction of Profes- 
sor Jespersen offer hints that may enter into our 
synthetic conception of the range of subjects suit- 
able for the dissertation in English. This concep- 
tion must arise in part from the philosophy of schol- 
arship, and in part from experience—through 
inference from the best work already done under 
the best teachers. Alas, how few of us can know 
what we ought about the great scholars, the great 
humanists, of the Italian Renaissance, or of that 
Alexandrian learning, so often decried, which in the 
end gave rise to a Virgil! 
The classical Renaissance reached a temporary 
culmination about the year 1850. We are now in 
the midst of a renaissance of the Middle Ages, of 
the life from which sprang Dante and the ecclesias- 
tical architecture of France. Though the medieval 
elements in Spenser, Shakespeare,! and Milton are

obvious, the more definite reintegration began with 
the poets and scholars in the latter half of the 
eighteenth century, and was carried on by their 
successors in the nineteenth—for example, in the 
Ecclesiastical Sonnets of Wordsworth and in Ten- 
nyson’s Idylls of the King. The brothers Grimm, 
Montalembert, Longfellow, Ruskin, illustrate various 
aspects of the same revival, which has indeed been 
multiform. The great English historians contem- 
porary with Ruskin—Freeman and Stubbs, for in- 
stance—were mediwvalists. And the great produc- 
tive scholars of the present day are medievalists. 
The most eminent American architect is a medieval- 
ist. This vital movement, which is now becoming 
unified, assuredly has yet some time to run; and it 
will sweep on regardless of falsetto protests from 
neo-pagans, or from unoriginal minds that contem- 
plate mere eddies on the surface of life and learning. 
For Europe and America, for the colonies of Eu- 
rope, the two fountain-heads of modern culture are 
the ancient Mediterranean civilization (of Greece, 
Rome, and Palestine) and the Middle Ages. Modern 
times, modern languages and literatures, are unin- 
telligible apart from the ancient and medieval 
sources from which they sprang, and from which 
they still proceed. Thus the recent war can hardly

theories and political conditions in the Middle Ages, 
or, say, of English ideals from the time of King Al- 
fred. The statement might be deemed a truism, 
were it not often denied by implication; the fact has 
a necessary bearing upon the demands we make on 
our doctors who are to propagate the English tradi- 
tion. 
That the ideals we hold dearer than life were 
formed in the Middle Ages is the primary reason 
why we cannot dispense with the study of Old Eng- 
lish. It is astonishing to find a man who affects some 
interest in those ideals contending that the serious 
student of them may forego an acquaintance with 
the language, literature, and general civilization of 
England before the time of Chaucer. Not to men- 
tion the poetry of Cynewulf, one of the six or seven 
foremost English poets, how are we to grasp the full 
meaning of Chaucer, or of Langland, or of Wyclif, 
or of the Pearl, or of the earliest English drama, 
without a previous familiarity with Old English? 
Are we actually to consign the age of Alfred, the 
early history of the Church in England, and the de- 
velopment of Biblical English, to the limbo of obliv- 
ion? What would Milton and Wordsworth say to 
this? Or Tennyson? Or Mr. Kipling? To observe 
English literature, English ideals, from the time of 
the Renaissance alone is to observe them in their 
period of diffusion. Before the age of colonial ex- 
pansion, the ideals of English culture lie all together, 
as it were, and are clear and distinct; subsequently, 
they are scattered, overlaid, often more or less dim
-P-A-G-E-275
  
CHAUCER AND OLD ENGLISH 265 
and tarnished. We test the genuine English tradi- 
tion in a Wordsworth, a Tennyson, a Kipling, by 
reference to parallels in the Middle Ages. 
Thus we may justify a seminary course in Chaucer, 
or at all events in some topic requiring a study of 
the Middle Ages. There is good reason for selecting 
Chaucer himself: he is remote enough to insure the 
perspective that intensive courses in Spenser, or 
Shakespeare, or Milton, or a more recent author or 
period, are not certain to develop in a graduate stu- 
dent; and for the ends of investigation the scholarly 
apparatus is now more adequate for Chaucer than 
for any later poet save Shakespeare. Again, he is 
a meeting-point for Old English scholarship, medi- 
eval French and Italian scholarship, and (through 
Boethius and the like) classical scholarship. Nearly 
all our studies lead to him, or away from him to 
modern times. The uncritical assumption that he 
may be dealt with in scholarly fashion by one who 
has neglected Old English may satisfy the purveyor 
of information in a finishing-school for young ladies; 
it may even echo a lecture by Sir Arthur Quiller- 
Couch; it will hardly do for a modern humanist and 
a censor of university studies in English. What 
Chaucerian scholar of note has lacked a complete 
linguistic training? Tyrwhitt? or Child? or Skeat? 
or Ten Brink? 
We have heard too much ill-considered talk about 
‘medievalism’ and ‘Anglo-Saxon,’ and about the 
elassies forming ‘the great tradition and inspiration 
of English literature,’ and English literature as be-

ginning with Chaucer—as if Christian culture meant 
nothing to our poets, or as if there were no classical 
culture in Bede and Aldhelm, in Alcuin and A‘lfric. 
Such notions are tags by which the real humanist of 
the present may detect the sham or one-sided humanist 
who has lagged behind the march of scholarship. One 
may venture to say this with the more emphasis, whose 
lot it has been to do what he could, in teaching, in 
research, and in publication, to promote the study of 
the ancient classics in relation to English. But nearly 
all I should like to say concerning false notions of 
medievalism, and of literary and linguistic investiga- 
tion, and of the relation of the Middle Ages to the 
humanities, has been anticipated by two writers who 
are more adroit and learned and humane than ever 
I can hope to be. I refer all who wish to consider 
the creed of the humanist, and to formulate require- 
ments for the doctoral degree in a modern subject, to

gent, and that on The Province of English Philology

Language Association of America

things, and hold fast that which is good.

TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION * 
OETS, according to Horace, may have any one of 
three ends in view: they may aim to instruct, 
or to entertain, or at once to profit and delight.2 What 
of teachers?—for they in a sense are poets, that is, 
literally, makers; not makers of verse, to be sure, or 
of fiction in words, but makers of character and mould- 
ers of intellect, by the instrumentality of pleasure and 
pain, their principal tools. If their means are pain 
and pleasure, censure and praise, have they also two 
main purposes, or is the final object of education 
always one and the same? The chief end of education, 
I take it, must be allied to the chief end of man; and 
this, in the words of the Catechism, is ‘to glorify God, 
and to enjoy Him for ever.’ There we have, as it 
seems, a double aim—not quite that of Horace, but re- 
minding us of his distinction. A good! education may 
therefore be defined as one which leads us to glorify the 
right things, and to enjoy the right things, in the right 
‘measure; for in truth when we discover what a man 
really enjoys, and what he deems profitable and praise- 
worthy, we know his inmost nature, and the essential 
effect of all his training.

  268 TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION 
I have dwelt, not by accident but intentionally, upon 
these several pairs of terms—instruction and enter- 
tainment, profit and delight, pain and pleasure, cen- 
sure and praise, glorification and enjoyment; I would 
gladly add other examples—the old and the new, tradi- 
tion and the present, a fixed curriculum and free 
choice, discipline and content—upon which the follow- 
ing discussion may directly or indirectly bear; for my 
subject is ‘T’wo Views of Education,’ and I would fain 
believe that these two views are fairly comprehensive, 
that they include the opposite opinions, however dis- 
guised or transmuted, underlying the most varied dis- 
cussions of pedagogical theory and practice. Mean- 
while we shall do well to remember that for every pair 
of opposites there is commonly a third or interme- 
diate term to be found, as the dictum of Horace on 
poets might easily suggest. In fact, our topic is not 
adequately described until we call it ‘Two Views of 
Education, and a Tertium Quid’; for neither view 
completely reckons with the contradictions in human 
nature—at once the best thing and the worst with 
which we are immediately acquainted. 
The two views in question are as old as humanity, 
and as young ; as ancient as the Greeks, and as modern; 
as remote as the Old Testament, and as near as the 
New; they belong quite as much to America as to 
Europe. Both are traditional, and like tradition itself 
they are, properly speaking, neither old nor new, but 
eternal. We might therefore illustrate them in many 
ways and from many sources; but I shall select as 
representative of these opposite views two men who
-P-A-G-E-279
  CALVIN AND ROUSSEAU 269 
belong to the modern Protestant tradition, rather than 
the ancient classical, or the medieval Catholic. Both 
men are associated with democratic rather than mon- 
archical institutions; both are connected in our minds 
with republican Switzerland and the Protestant city 
of Geneva. For good or ill, the influence of each has 
been powerful, as it has been obvious, upon the edu- 
cation of Protestant America. The two main educa- 
tional tendencies in our country, I submit, may be 
fitly designated if we link one with the name of John 
Calvin and the doctrine of human depravity, and the 
other with that of Jean Jacques Rousseau and the 
belief, as he expressed: it, in the original goodness of 
man. I invite the reader’s attention first to the Cal- 
vinistic doctrine of original sin. 
In Europe, and hence in America, the influence of 
Calvin is prior, and now might almost seem to have 
run its course. He was born in the year 1509, two cen- 
turies before Rousseau—not, like Rousseau, at Geneva. 
However, during his relatively brief career (for he 
died at the age of fifty-five) he was mainly active 
there; and from Geneva the effect of his life and 
learning spread through the countries of the Reform- 
ation, for example to Scotland, and thence to the 
American colonies. Thus the rigorous classical tradi- 
tion of Princeton may easily be traced to him. But 
in general, of course, we are right in connecting the 
type of learning, and the view of life, which once pre- 
vailed throughout our Eastern colleges with the ideals 
of Calvin, even though these ideals were shared by 
other leaders of the Reformation.
-P-A-G-E-280
  270 TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION 
For him and his followers, the taint of sin is in 
every man and: woman: 
In Adam’s fall we sinnéd all, 
as the New England Primer has it. The whole man 
is infected. The natural process of generation is evil; 
the babe in the womb is guilty; each and every infant 
born into the world is a sinner, subject to the power 
of the devil, and under condemnation of the law of 
God unless the badness ingrained is driven out with 
a scourge. Education, therefore, cannot be purely 
delightful. To teach is not to please, and to profit is 
not to entertain. The native motions of the individual 
soul toward glory and delight lead straight to self- 
assertion and self-enjoyment. They must be killed; 
for learning means self-mortification in order that we 
may glorify and enjoy in the right fashion. 
The doctrine of original sin finds no great favor in 
America at the present time among so-called persons 
of cultivation. For that matter, sin itself is not a 
word to argue with, as are heredity, environment, and 
soon. The belief in the doctrine is supposed: to rest 
upon a way of interpreting the story of the fall, in 
Genesis, which is no longer countenanced. That story, 
we are told, represents, not literal, but poetical truth ; 
the Chureh Fathers themselves for the most part 
treated it as allegory. But after all, interpret the 
story as we may, it corresponds to something in human 
nature; the notion that we come into the world with

ORIGINAL SIN 271 
evil tendencies is borne out by the inner experience of 
every one of us. Call the thing by whatever name we 
like, what Calvin termed original sin represents an 
ultimate element in human life. It is, accordingly, 
something to which the honest educator dare not shut 
his eyes. Let him strive to render his teaching as posi- 
tive and constructive as may be, he must yet be pre- 
pared to be negative, and to act in a destructive man- 
ner, when the occasion shows the need. He must make 
the pupil learn how to deny himself, and we have never 
seen this accomplished in a living human being with- 
out the infliction of pain, whether mental or physical, 
or both. There is, then, something to be said for the 
Calvinistic mode of education. For one thing, begin- 
ning with Calvin himself it produced many scholars of 
wide and deep learning. 
Not least among these was Milton. The great poet 
of the Reformation well exemplifies what may be 
expected of the traditional rigor in teaching and 
studying the classics under the best of circumstances. 
It is true, in his tractate Of Education he clearly 
recognizes the desirability of introducing an element 
of pleasure in education, and the need, not of forced, 
but of ‘willing’ obedience on the side of the student. 
But in his own exceedingly effective practice as 
schoolmaster he did not follow the principle of ‘read- 
ing without tears.’ Aubrey says of him that he 
‘took into his tuition his sister’s two sons, Edward 
and John Philips, the first ten, the other nine, years 
of age, and in a year’s time made them capable of 
interpreting a Latin author at sight, . . . and within

three years they went through the best of Latin and 
Greek poets.’ The biographer adds: ‘As he was 
severe on one hand, so he was most familiar and 
free in his conversation to those to whom most sour 
in his way of education.’ Indeed, it is said that 
his first wife left his house in part because she could 
not endure the eries of distress from the pupils.? 
To adapt his own words, what with mild and effec- 
tual persuasions, and what with the intimation of 
some fear, but chiefly by his own example, he kept 
them plying hard and daily until they knew the chief 
and necessary rules of a good Latin Grammar; and 
shortly had them reading the authors of works on 
agriculture, Cato, Varro, and Columella—‘for the 
matter is most easy, and if the language be difficult, 
so much the better, it is not a difficulty above their 
years.’* Doubtless he would have failed in giving 
boys the ability to read (not to puzzle out) Latin in 
a year, or to do as well with Greek in another, had 
there been no sourness in his procedure, 
I might go on to show how the tradition thus en- 
nobled in the hands of Milton held sway, in teaching 
that was not always equally successful, throughout 
Protestant Europe and America well into the nine- 
teenth century. Under less competent teachers, of 
course, the pupils did not learn to interpret Greek 
and Latin with ease; and the plan of driving out the

  ROUSSEAU AND ORIGINAL GOODNESS 273 
old Adam by forcing him to grind gerunds no doubt 
led to many an abuse. Nor can we defend a study of 
language that does not quickly lead to the free com- 
munication of ideas from the author to the reader. 
At the same time we must not forget that virtually 
all the culture we had in America during the forma- 
tive years of the Republic was essentially classical, 
essentially Calvinistic, and in the last analysis cen- 
tred in the doctrine of original sin. Even to-day, 
the stronghold of the old classical type of education 
is the South, in the sections where the stricter forms 
of Protestantism still maintain their integrity, and 
where parental authority has not relaxed. 
Somewhat less than a century and a half after 
the death of Calvin, there was born at Geneva, in 
the year 1712, a child whose mother died in giving 
him birth, and whose irresponsible father allowed 
him to grow up without a semblance of discipline. 
This boy soon found himself in conflict with the tra- 
ditions of his native city; his entire life might be 
described as a long rebellion against society as he 
found it, and against the education by which society 
is formed. Himself undisciplined and self-educated 
(which means to some extent badly educated), in 
time he became known as a writer on the practice of 
education. Whether we give the credit to Rousseau 
himself for the ideas which have circulated as his, 
and which his native eloquence rendered intelligible 
to the masses, or whether he gave utterance to beliefs 
which were common property in his age, is imma- 
terial. We are amply justified in associating with
-P-A-G-E-284
  274 TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION 
his name a conception of human nature, diametri- 
cally opposed to that maintained by Calvin, which 
we may term the doctrine of original goodness. With 
it goes a corresponding theory of education. 
Coming from the hand of the Author of all things, 
contends Rousseau, the child, like every other part 
of creation, is good; whereas in the hands of man 
everything degenerates. The depravity we observe 
in those about us is not inborn; it arises from the 
first contact of the individual, a vicious contact, with 
his kind. From this first depravity all others come 
in succession; the entire moral order is changed, and 
natural feeling is extinguished in all hearts. Do 
you wish, then, that the child shall preserve his 
original form? Help him to preserve it from the 
moment he enters the world. As soon as he is born 
take possession of him, and do not let him go until 
he is a man. The Author of nature has given chil- 
dren an active principle, but in a state of nature He 
leaves them with little power to indulge it to their 
own injury. But no sooner do those about the child 
permit him to regard them as the instruments of his 
will, whom he can set in motion, than he uses them 
in following his own inclination. In this way 
he becomes disagreeable, tyrannical, imperious, per- 
verse, unruly; a development, not arising from a 
natural spirit of domination, but creating such a 
spirit. The child, then, in the main, must be treated 
in such fashion that he seems to be left to himself. 
Our pedantic mania for instructing constantly leads 
us to teach children what they can learn far better

for themselves, and to lose sight of what we alone 
ean teach them. What, then, must be thought of that 
barbarous education which sacrifices the present to 
an uncertain future, loads the child with every de- 
scription of fetters, and begins, by making him 
wretched, to prepare for him some far-away indefi- 
nite happiness he may never enjoy?+ 
It is no concern of ours to explain away the incon- 
sistencies in these sentiments from Rousseau’s Emile. 
We need not ask why, if the natural inclination is 
always good in all men to begin with, the inevitable 
result should be that in the hands of man all things, 
including his own children, degenerate. Nor are we 
bound to reflect how it comes about that Rousseau, 
whose general tendency was inimical to Christian- 
ity, and whose life was far from a model for the 
Christian, should nevertheless on occasion draw close 
to the utterances of Christ respecting children and 
the necessity of our becoming like them. We are 
simply dealing with the ideas of Rousseau as he 
published them, and as a subsequent generation of 
educational theorists received them. The child, in 
his view, is a child of God, and is therefore good. If 
we free his inborn tendency from hindrances, nature 
will do the rest. The teacher is simply the power 
that affords nature a chance of which nature will

gladly avail itself. In general, under the scheme of 
Rousseau, the child is to escape censure; he is not to 
do anything because it is traditional; he is to live in 
the present, not forced to perform actions with a 
view to his subsequent welfare; his studies are not 
fixed, he is free to choose what he will learn; he 
knows nothing of discipline. In this arrangement, 
obviously, to teach is to please, and to profit is to 
furnish entertainment. The chief end of man is 
present glory and enjoyment. If the child reads at 
all, let him read without tears. But so far as I 
know, it is not recorded that Rousseau ever actually 
taught a living individual to accomplish anything, 
much less to read Latin or Greek in either one year 
or more; and, if pushed to extremes, we should have 
to admit that on the whole he was not well educated 
enough to be both happy and useful, always promot- 
ing and relishing the highest and best things in life. 
To employ the words of Milton, on ‘a complete and 
generous education,’ Rousseau was never fitted ‘to 
perform justly, skilfully, and magnanimously all 
the offices, both private and public, of peace and 
war.’* Yet it would be idle to maintain that his re- 
flections are without value. On the contrary, if I 
am not mistaken, many of us would find it difficult 
not to assent in some measure to the truth of most 
of his contentions. 
At all events, America at large has found it impos- 
sible not to assent to them. And the history of Amer- 
ican education, as we can see by a glance at the change

  ‘DISCIPLINE’ AND ‘CONTENT’ 277 
which occurred in the last fifty years of the nineteenth 
century, has meant a gradual movement away from 
the ideals of Calvin and the Protestant Reformation 
toward those of Rousseau and the French Revolution. 
We have come to aim less at ultimate improvement, 
and more at immediate satisfaction. Not discipline, 
but content, is the watchword, We are not to trouble 
ourselves and our students with what is old, difficult, 
unnatural, and far-away, when we and they crave what 
is new, easy, natural, and close at hand. The chief 
end of man is to make a living and to adapt himself 
comfortably to his environment. Let him know the 
objects that lie about him—and this means, we may 
say, not the books of permanent value (though libraries 
existing at this very moment are full of them, so that 
they are always a part of our environment), but the 
geology of his native region, and the latest number 
of the Outlook or the Review of Reviews. Strangely 
enough, no one objects to the study of geological 
strata, near in point of space, but in point of time 
many thousand years more remote than the Greeks 
and Romans; but indeed: our theorists on education 
tell us to occupy ourselves with our neighbor and with 
proximate interests before they give us any answer to 
the question, ‘Who is my neighbor?’—though the 
answer, as in the parable, is generally not the one 
that first occurs to the casual observer. The Republic 
of Plato and the Ethics of Aristotle have, after all, 
been neighbors to more well-educated minds than 
ever the Outlook or the Review of Reviews will be. 
Furthermore, remembering that Plutarch formed an 
19
-P-A-G-E-288
  278 TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION 
inspiring item in the surroundings of the young Rous- 
seau, one is tempted to recall that Emile was to be 
reared, not in a chance, but in a carefully selected 
environment; the principle might involve the removal 
of any given book or pamphlet from his clutch, and 
the substitution of ‘The Lives of the noble Grecians 
and Romans, compared together by that grave learned 
Philosopher and Historiographer’ of Cheronea. In 
the type of pedagogy inspired by Rousseau, the acci- 
dental circumstances and the natural leaning one 
betrays at the outset count as the determining factors 
in one’s instruction. And so in our time we study 
English, French, and German, and, newest of all, 
Spanish, since the peoples seem to be our neighbors; 
and we do this to the disadvantage of Greek and 
Latin, good Samaritans able and willing to care for 
the boy who is wounded in the head by ignorance. So 
also we have the elective system in place of a fixed 
curriculum, with lectures to listen to instead of reci- 
tations to make, so that our students know more about 
taking pleasures than about taking pains; and we 
educate them for the first ten years of life after they 
leave school, rather than (to quote Rousseau again) 
‘for some far-away indefinite happiness they may 
never enjoy.’ We will educate our boy for the chief 
end of man if you do not put the end too far ahead. 
But why not go at least as far as the pagan Plato, and 
train our youth with a view to their activities at the 
age of fifty? 
It seems reasonable to believe, however, that the 
pendulum has again begun to swing the other way.
-P-A-G-E-289
A WELCOME TO DISCIPLINE 279 
An excess of rigor and inelasticity in education is 
likely to be followed by a period of greater freedom ; 
and again, when liberty of choice runs into wild 
license, the natural good sense of mankind will reas- 
sert the principles of moderation and restraint. If 
the cause of discipline and the classics suffered more 
and more in the latter half of the nineteenth century, 
it would appear that a reaction has already set in dur- 
ing the first half of the twentieth. For unlimited 
choice in studies we have a well-marked tendency 
to substitute groups of studies, and fixed conditions 
within the group. And though theorists declaim 
against the recognition of formal discipline in the 
schools, here and there the nation shows signs of wel- 
come to a universal military service as a means of 
inculeating punctuality, obedience, and the love of 
order, in a lax and careless generation. The complaint 
of business men that the college graduate has done 
what he likes so long that he has no power to do what 
he ought has brought the faculties, trustees, and even 
the alumni of universities to consider ways and means 
of improving scholarship. At least one of our col- 
leges, Amherst, has definitely announced its intention 
of returning to ancient ways, in the direction of rigor 
and of Greek and Latin—a motion, let us say, toward 
the glory of God and perpetual felicity. We might 
go on to note other signs of a better time to come; 
for instance, the resentment aroused: in the public 
schools by the interference of a heavily-endowed pri- 
vate board in favor of a shallow kind of education in 
which the country had begun to lose faith; or the
-P-A-G-E-290
  280 TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION 
recoil against a type of belief, or unbelief, ‘the re- 
ligion of the future,’ so-called,+ which has, like the 
free elective system, already had its little day and 
been found wanting. If the reaction against these 
things is already in motion as an undercurrent, call- 
ing attention to them will serve to hasten its progress. 
But it would never do to imply that the belief in 
the natural goodness of man is wholly misplaced, or 
that the notion of universal human depravity is the 
sole, and an adequate, basis for the practice of teach- 
ing. What we need to insist on is the happy medium. 
In educating man we have to deal with him as he 
is, neither an angel nor yet a demon. Those who 
have to do with children know that there is a con- 
flict from the outset in the human heart. The child, 
and mankind, are, we know not how, at once origi- 
nally good and originally sinful.? The process of edu- 
cating man does mean eliminating the original sin and 
setting free the original goodness that constitute his 
heritage. It makes no difference at what stage we 
meet him, so long as he is not fully educated; in the 
long run the first time we come in contact with the 
individual, whether immediately after birth, or before 
or after adolescence, or whenever it may be, we have 
to reckon with a contradiction in his very nature. 
Nevertheless this nature is not dual, but one. Life 
itself is full of contradictions, irreconcilable in the 
abstract, which are somehow unified and even har- 
monized in practice. Now the reconciliation is effected 
1See above, p. 163, and footnote,

-P-A-G-E-291
THE REGULATION OF IMPULSE 281 
by an art which is an imitation and fulfilment of life, 
and which is likewise contradictory in itself; for the 
artist—the poet, or painter, or musician—is a con- 
scious and self-restraining workman, knowing what 
he does, and directing his own action, even while he 
gives way to the creative impulse; so that in some 
inexplicable manner he is both conscious and uncon- 
scious at one and the same time. In fact, successful 
art, like successful life, is the systematic regulation 
of irregular impulse for the attainment of a predeter- 
mined end. 
In the art of education, then, we have what looks 
like a double task, and yet is a single one. It is our 
function as teachers in some way to say with Calvin 
that crude impulse is bad, and with Rousseau that 
crude impulse is good. We must know how to kill 
it, and, even in the act of doing so, to make it live 
again. The teacher must bea kind of fate to his pupil, 
and at the same time must bestow upon him the su- 
preme good gift of free will. Pain, the thwarting 
and crossing of inclination, discipline, unintelligible 
hardship, cannot be omitted even from the earliest 
stages of a preparation for life, for in life every indi- 
vidual is certain to meet each and all of them; nor 
can their opposites be omitted. The original sin of 
the individual must be scourged and purged away; 
his original goodness must be cherished and encour- 
aged. We have to recognize and harmonize the con- 
tradictory views of a Rousseau and a Calvin both. 
There is, as it were, a third view, comprehending 
and reconciling the other two, and free from the ex-
-P-A-G-E-292
282 TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION 
cess or defect of either. This we may find, as Aris- 
totle found each several virtue, in the mean between 
two extremes. Thus courage was for him an inter- 
mediate state between cowardice and rashness, being 
neither of these, and yet in a sense partaking of the 
nature of both, since the brave man is both cautious 
and bold; and so on throughout the list of human 
virtues as he knew them. Similarly in teaching we 
must strive to reach the golden mean. We cannot 
do away with the notion of discipline; we cannot ig- 
nore an ultimate something in human nature which 
defies the lure of gentle persuasion and the promise 
of enjoyment—a something for which no better name 
can be found than ‘original sin,’ a something very 
close to the real nature of the individual. Call it 
how you will, it is there, and the teacher must deal 
successfully with it or fail in his effort to benefit 
the pupil. Nor, on the other hand, can we neglect 
the assistance of the native impulses of the human 
heart. Between. constant rigor and constant yield- 
ing in the treatment of inclination lies the virtue of 
the teacher. 
But we observe that the Aristotelian mean never 
lies precisely midway between the two extremes. It 
is always nearer to one of them than to the other— - 
as courage has a greater resemblance to rashness 
than to cowardice, In practice, accordingly, we 
must drag ourselves away from the extreme to which 
we naturally tend, and struggle toward its opposite. 
The rash man is exceptional; most of us are by na- 
ture cowardly, and must attain to a measure of
-P-A-G-E-293
A TIME FOR ALL THINGS 283 
courage by aiming at boldness. Are we, then, in the 
matter of education to aim at severity or at soft- 
ness? Must we seek to provide discipline, or to 
arouse interest in content? Are we to direct our ef- 
forts toward the eradication of original sin, other- 
wise letting nature have her way, or toward the 
positive inculcation of excellence, keeping the pupil 
active in useful and noble pursuits, and allowing 
the evil in his nature to die for want of exercise? 
Perhaps the answers would vary in different periods 
of history, for different periods in the life of the 
pupil, with different pupils, and with different 
teachers, 
No doubt the excessive drudgery of much of the 
older classical training was not sufficiently tempered 
by a desire to enlist a willing obedience in the pupil 
through legitimate appeals to his curiosity and emo- 
tions. If so, the time-honored formal drill, blind to 
the surpassing interest and beauty in the tale of 
Ulysses, brought its own penalty; just as a perni- 
cious abuse in the subsequent elective system in stud- 
ies bids fair to bring down destruction upon its 
own head. A given period in education must be 
studied as a whole; its guardians may be called on 
to interfere with its drift toward a vicious extreme. 
Again, in the life of the pupil there is a time for 
‘the infliction of less pain, and a time for the inflic- 
tion of more. Yet tender plants are not the worse 
for a little pruning. With allowance for the occa- 
sional exceptionally delicate flower, the judicious 
teacher will not permit young America, even in the

kindergarten, to fancy itself in a world devoid of 
shock, The most successful teacher of infants I 
happen to know about was Susanna Wesley, the 
mother of nineteen children, two of whom, John and 
Charles, became eminent, and afford an easy com- 
parison with Rousseau or his Emile. In later years 
(July 24, 1732) she wrote to her son John as follows: 
‘Dear Son: According to your desire, I have 
collected the principal rules I observed in educating 
my family... . 
‘The children were always put into a regular 
method of living, in such things as they were ca- 
pable of, from their birth. . . . When turned a year 
old (and some before), they were taught to fear the 
rod, and to ery softly, by which means they escaped 
abundance of correction they might otherwise have 
had; and that most odious noise of the crying of 
children was rarely heard in the house, but the 
family usually lived in as much quietness as if there 
had not been a child among them. 
‘As soon as they were grown pretty strong, they 
were confined to three meals a day. At dinner their 
little table and chairs were set by ours, where they 
could be overlooked; and they were suffered to eat 
and drink (small beer) as much as they would, but 
not to eall for anything. If they wanted aught, 
they used to whisper to the maid which attended 
them, who came and spake to me; and as soon as 
they could handle a knife and fork, they were set 
to our table. They were never suffered to choose 
their meat, but always made to eat such things as 
were provided for the family. ... Nor were they 
suffered to go into the kitchen to ask anything of 
the servants when they were at meat; if it was known 
they did, they were certainly beat, and the servants

severely reprimanded. At six, as soon as family 
prayers were over, they had their supper; at seven, 
the maid washed them, and, beginning at the young- 
est, she undressed and got them all to bed by eight; 
at which time she left them in their several rooms 
awake, for there was no such thing allowed of in 
our house as sitting by a child till it fell asleep... . 
‘In order to form the minds of children, the first 
thing to be done is to conquer their will and bring 
them to an obedient temper. To inform the under- 
standing is a work of time, and must with children 
proceed by slow degrees as they are able to bear it; 
but the subjecting the will is a thing which must be 
done at once, and the sooner the better; for by 
neglecting timely correction, they will contract a 
stubbornness and obstinacy which is hardly ever 
after conquered, and never without using such 
severity as would be as painful to me as to the child. 
In the esteem of the world they pass for kind and 
indulgent, whom I call cruel, parents, who permit 
their children to get habits which they know must 
be afterwards broken. Nay, some are so stupidly 
fond as in sport to teach their children to do things 
which in a while after they have severely beaten 
them for doing. Whenever a child is corrected, it 
must be conquered; and this will be no hard matter 
to do, if it be not grown headstrong by too much 
indulgence. And when the will of a child is totally 
subdued, and it is brought to revere and stand in 
awe of the parents, then a great many childish fol- 
lies and inadvertences may be passed by. Some 
should be overlooked and taken no notice of, and 
others mildly reproved; but no wilful transgression 
ought ever to be forgiven children without chastise- 
ment less or more, as the nature and circumstances 
of the offence require. I insist upon conquering the 
will of children betimes, because this is the only
-P-A-G-E-296
  286 TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION 
strong and rational foundation of a religious educa- 
tion, without which both precept and example will be 
ineffectual. But when this is thoroughly done, then 
a child is capable of being governed by the reason 
and piety of its parents till its own understanding 
comes to maturity, and the principles of religion have 
taken root in the mind... . 
‘The children of this family were taught, as soon 
as they could speak, the Lord’s prayer, which they 
were made to say at rising and bedtime constantly ; 
to which, as they grew bigger, were added a short 
prayer for their parents, and some collects, a short 
catechism, and some portion of Scripture, as their 
memories could bear. They were very early made to 
distinguish the Sabbath from other days, before they 
could well speak or go. They were as soon taught to 
be still at family prayers, and to ask a blessing imme- 
diately after, which they used to do by signs, before 
they could kneel or speak. 
‘They were quickly made to understand they might 
have nothing they cried for, and instructed to speak 
handsomely for what they wanted. They were not 
suffered to ask even the lowest servant for aught with- 
out saying, ‘‘Pray give me such a thing’’; and the 
servant was chid if she ever let them omit that word. 
Taking God’s name in vain, cursing and swearing, pro- 
faneness, obscenity, rude ill-bred names, were never 
heard among them. Nor were they ever permitted to 
eall each other by their proper names, without the 
addition of ‘‘Brother’’ or ‘‘Sister.’’ . . . 
‘There was no such thing as loud talking or play- 
ing allowed of, but every one was kept close to their 
business, for the six hours of school. And it is almost 
incredible what a child may be taught in a quarter 
of a year by a vigorous application, if it have but a 
tolerable capacity and good health. Every one of
-P-A-G-E-297
  ON WHICH SIDE WE ERR 287 
these, Kezzy excepted, could read better in that time 
than the most of women can do as long as they live.’ * 
Again, the individual teacher must consider himself 
and his own tendency, and, if he be convicted of sin, 
must strive toward the opposite pole in an attempt to 
become a virtuous master of his art and craft. Does 
he harp immoderately on the rudiments of diction 
and grammar, and never bring his pupils to think of 
Latin as a means of communication between intelli- 
gent human beings? Do these pupils halt and stumble 
through four, or it may be six, books of the Auneid 
without ever discovering how the whole great epic 
works out at the end? Do they toil through some 
hundred lines of the Odyssey, unaware that the entire 
story is in fact the most captivating romance that 
could possibly fall into their hands? In a word, does 
the teacher see to it that the values of little things 
(and I do not underrate their value) are properly sub- 
ordinated to the values of great? 
But leaving the possible differences in the needs of 
other times, and the probable differences of tendency 
among individuals, what shall we say of the general 
need in American education at present? Do we err 
on the side of too much or too little severity in deal- 
ing with the inborn and acquired inclinations of our 
charges? Who will contend that as a nation we are 
rigorous enough in our demands upon students? I 
do not mean that we are not asking or permitting

288 TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION 
them to do too many things, since the very multi- 
plicity of studies in our scheme of general education 
savors of laxness and not of rigor. But what has be- 
come of the training that will lead a boy or a girl to 
take pains? I know there are schools where the intel- 
lectual discipline is effective. But in general have we 
not lost sight of the truth that the subjects we teach 
are a means and not an end; that by aiming to pro- 
duce character we succeed better in instilling knowl- 
edge? Is it any longer the common belief that the 
promising youth is the one who, to speak in terms of 
Plato, will endure the lower, immediate pain for the 
sake of the higher, ultimate satisfaction? who delights 
in meeting and overcoming difficulty in the things of 
the mind? who will take up his cross daily with glad- 
ness, and endure it with joy, for the sake of the crown 
gleaming in the distance? who will glorify the humble 
toil, and will enjoy the high reward in prospect? 
‘We need more of the spirit of Calvin, and less of 
the spirit of Rousseau, in American education. When 
the nation has been tending to excess in one direction, 
the educational leader will not try to drive it into a 
greater excess of the same kind; he will help, where 
he can, to restore the golden mean. All honor, then, 
to the teachers of the ancient classics. They con- 
stantly plead for those studies which in former years 
have proved themselves capable of furnishing the dis- 
eipline that preserves the intellectual life of the 
nation. They are not misled by superficial distinctions 
between the old and ‘the new, the near and the re- 
mote; for, being nourished on the literatures of Greece
-P-A-G-E-299
REGENERATION 289 
and. Rome, from which the chaff has been blown away, 
and of which the wheat alone remains, they hold fast 
to the permanent and the essential, irrespective of 
time and place. 
Yet we cannot return to a former age save in imagi- 
nation. If it be true that, to be well educated, we 
must be born again and must become as little children, 
nevertheless we cannot actually re-enter the womb of 
time and again be little children. The study of the 
ancient classics can never again be what it was before 
the advent in the curriculum of English and the 
modern Continental languages and literatures. But 
it can be more than ever it was in the past if the 
teachers of all the humanities will co-operate in hand- 
ing on the tradition, not of words, but of ideas. If 
classical culture is to perform its proper function in 
American life, we must not simply give heed to the 
mint, the anise, and the cummin of diction and syntax, 
neglecting weightier matters, such as the meaning of 
a work of literary art as a whole. We may glorify 
the detail only as a means to the enjoyment of the 
entire masterpiece. 
But, after all, it is for the teachers of the classics to 
tell us moderns, us teachers of English, French, and 
German, what to do. It is our place to encourage 
them, and theirs to admonish us. It is for them to 
insist that in literary and linguistic studies we should 
give more of our time to what is lasting, and less to 
what is transient—more to the works of Goethe, Schil- 
ler, Heine, and Lessing, than to Storm’s Immensee, 
Gersticker’s Germelshausen, Heyse’s L’Arrabbiata,
-P-A-G-E-300
290 TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION 
Baumbach’s Das Habichtsfriulein, Leander’s Tréu- 
mereien, and Arnold’s Fritz auf Ferien; more to the 
works of Corneille, Pascal, Boileau, Moliére, Racine, 
and Bossuet, than to Brunot’s Le Tour de la France 
par deux Enfants, Malot’s Sans Famille, Saintine’s 
Picciola, Bnault’s Chien du Capitaine, Halévy’s 
L’Abbé Constantin, and De la Bréte’s Mon Oncle et 
mon Curé. Let us not contend that contemporary lit- 
erature has no place in the curriculum, but let us say 
that its place is very limited, since only a small frac- 
tion of it will survive and prove useful in the future. 
The Greek and Latin authors, as we have them, leave 
no room for an altogether faulty choice of subject- 
matter in a ‘teacher with an inclination toward the 
trivial. It is for devotees of the classics to insist that 
we pay more attention to the ideas of Chaucer, Spen- 
ser, Shakespeare, and Milton than to those of the Out- 
look and the Review of Reviews; and more to the edu- 
cational theory and practice of Milton—a great writer, 
a successful teacher, and perhaps the best-read man 
of modern times—than to the shallow and ephemeral 
speculations of those who have never thought out the 
relation of the past ten days, or weeks, or years, to the 
vast remainder of human experience. It is for them 
to insist also, with Milton, that ‘though a linguist 
should pride himself to have all the tongues that Babel 
cleft the world into, yet if he have not studied the solid 
things in them, as well as the words and lexicons, he 
were nothing so much to be esteemed a learned man 
as any yeoman or tradesman competently wise in his 
mother dialect only.’ It is for students of Greek and
-P-A-G-E-301
  MILTON AND PEDAGOGY 291 
Latin to insist that there is no ‘discipline’ without the 
acquisition of ‘content,’ nor any true acquisition of 
content without strict adherence to the letter. Is it 
not their own Horace who finally teaches and pleases, 
both in one? Is it not he and his master Plato who 
unite precept and illuminating example in such fashion 
as to convince us that no lasting pleasure is unprofit- 
able, and no true learning ultimately unpleasant? 
‘The labor we delight in physics pain.’ 
The frequent reference to Milton’s tractate Of 
Education throughout this discussion has not been 
undesigned. The work makes more profitable read- 
ing than our current pedagogy, or, as he well knew, 
the current pedagogy of his own day. I only wish 
that words of mine might cause many teachers in 
the land to take its wise precepts and sound philoso- 
phy to heart. We may without impropriety think 
of the author as a follower of Calvin—so are we all, 
in a sense; but he was not so in any narrow fashion. 
We might, on some grounds, regard him as a pre- 
eursor of Rousseau. Certainly in the tractate, as 
elsewhere, he rises above the level of dogmatism and 
empiricism to a conception of a higher expediency, 
in physical, mental, and spiritual training, not far 
short of the highest. If he errs at all, he does so 
in ways that cannot harm any one in our generation. 
In trying to suggest an ideal by approaching it from 
either side, we may use him as an illustration of one 
aspect rather than the other; but he actually ap- 
proximates the ideal more nearly than any one 
writing in the present day. Need I explain that I
-P-A-G-E-302
  292 °° TWO VIEWS OF EDUCATION 
have in mind the Christian ideal of education? This 
is the education that gives a man absolute power 
over himself--the power to lay down his life and 
the power to take it up again, that is to say, com- 
plete capacity both negative and positive. It enables 
the individual to treat his neighbor as well as him- 
self, and himself as well as his neighbor; to flee from 
pain or to face it; to reject pleasure or to accept it; 
to offer his face for a second blow from an enemy 
or to chastise a friend—or to forgive a wife or a 
brother; to follow a line of conduct in steadfastness 
or to take up another with the swiftness of light- 
ning ; to be both flexible and inflexible; to bring forth 
out of his treasure things new and old. In educa- 
tion, as Milton knew, the emphasis will commonly lie 
upon one side more than the other; more upon duty 
to one’s neighbor, less upon duty to oneself, or the 
true balance will not be struck; more upon facing 
pain and rejecting pleasure, and upon steadfastness 
of aim, than upon their opposites. Need I add that 
the stress will be more upon the tradition of the last 
twenty-five centuries and less upon the tradition of 
the last twenty-five years; more upon training in 
the classical languages and literatures and less upon 
training in French and German; more upon ‘disci- 
pline’ in a higher sense and less upon ‘content’ in a 
lower? Let me illustrate. Is it not better to learn 
a few passages of Homer, Virgil, and the New Testa- 
ment by heart than to read the contents of the Sun- 
day newspaper? 
We have heard of late, from persons whose names 
will be forgotten in a very little while, that disci- 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  MILTON ON ‘DISCIPLINE’ 293 
pline is of very little value. In opposition to this 
superficial view I venture to quote another passage 
from an author whose name will be remembered, and 
whose words will be listened to, so long as the Eng- 
lish language shall be intelligible to educated men— 
Milton, On the Reason of Church Government: 
‘There is not that thing in the world of more grave 
and urgent importance, throughout the whole life of 
man, than is discipline. What need I instance? He 
that hath read with judgment of nations and com- 
monwealths, of cities and camps, of peace and war, 
sea and land, will readily agree that the flourishing 
and decaying of all civil societies, all the moments 
and turnings of human occasions, are moved to and 
fro as upon the axle of discipline. So that whatso- 
ever power or sway in mortal things weaker men 
have attributed to fortune, I durst with more con- 
fidence (the honor of Divine Providence ever saved) 
ascribe either to the vigor or the slackness of disci- 
pline. Nor is there any sociable perfection in this 
life, civil or sacred, that can be above discipline; 
but she is that which with her musical cords! pre- 
serves and holds all the parts thereof together. .. . 
And certainly discipline is not only the removal of 
disorder, but, if any visible shape can be given to 
divine things, the very visible shape and image of 
virtue; whereby she is not only seen in the regular 
gestures and motions of her heavenly paces as she 
walks, but also makes the harmony of her voice 
audible to mortal ears.’ ?

lent to chords.

  APPENDIX 
A COURSE IN TRANSLATIONS OF THE 
CLASSICS + 
‘English Translations of Greek and Latin Classics’ 
is the title of a course I have for more than fifteen 
years given annually at Cornell University, with 
what the reader will pardon me for deeming excel- 
lent results. For the sake of those who may be 
tempted to give, or to follow, a similar course, I 
shall set forth the principles underlying this one, 
and shall sketch the actual work done by a typical 
class preparing a weekly written report or paper 
for some thirty-two weeks. 
It must first of all be noted that the work in ques- 
tion, while intended to serve the special ends of stu- 
dents of English (in select groups of ten or twelve), 
is not designed to supplant any part of the intensive 
study of Greek and Latin literature in the original 
tongues. Actually, those who have hitherto done 
best in the course have with few exceptions been 
students of Greek and Latin to begin with. Others, 
coming to the university with no knowledge of Greek, 
have been convinced by their work with translations 
that an educated man cannot afford to be ignorant 
*My description of this course was first published in The 
Classical Weekly for November, 1917, at the suggestion of the 
managing editor; materials there appearing are here utilized 
with his kind consent. In its present shape the description is 
somewhat expanded. 
294
-P-A-G-E-305

of that language, and accordingly have promptly 
taken up the study of it. 
Yet the course is based upon the assumption that 
the teacher of the classics has not always made the 
best use of his opportunities. The mainspring of the 
work is the application of classical theories of liter- 
ary art to masterpieces of classical literature, in so 
far as this is possible through the best English trans- 
lations. And through this medium it is possible to 
enforce lessons of the utmost value, which so far as 
I can learn have been sadly neglected in almost every 
part of America. Through this medium, with princi- 
ples supplied by the ancients themselves, one may 
teach a Sophomore to regard the Odyssey as an 
organic work of art, with a beginning, middle, and 
end—as a unified whole, in the light of which every 
detail is to be interpreted; and then to regard the 
Gdipus Rex of Sophocles in a similar fashion; and 
to go on to other masterpieces, with the same intent 
—learning the universal laws of artistic structure as 
they are not learned in classes where fifty lines a 
day are read in the original, chopped off irrespective 
of the natural joints, where the emphasis is laid first 
upon diction and syntax, and secondly upon realien 
(appropriated by American text-books from German 
ones), and where the pupil at best makes an occa- 
sional inference concerning the portrayal of charac- 
ter, the structure of a speech, or the treatment of an 
incident in and for itself. 
The course is, then, I trust, formal in the better 
sense of that word: fundamental laws are illustrated 
by specific examples, the union of the two being ef-
-P-A-G-E-306
  296 APPENDIX 
fected by the student for himself, with the minimum 
amount of obvious help from the teacher. However, 
much substantial information in the usual sense is 
absorbed by the student; for throughout the aca- 
demic year he thrice returns to tasks requiring a 
survey of ancient mythology; a rough chronological 
sequence is generally maintained in all he does; and 
at the close of the second semester he applies what 
he has previously learned to the study of several 
topics in English literature. It will be seen that an 
attempt has been made to convert the whole into a 
kind of drama, itself with a beginning, middle, and 
end, the successive efforts of the class being, as it 
were, so many incidents following one another in a 
natural, if not always an inevitable, sequence. 
Ideally, no doubt, the sequence of any course of 
study should be inevitable; but in practice incidental 
concessions must now and then be allowed to the 
actual needs of the student. This course in transla- 
tions may therefore be described as sufficiently theoret- 
ieal, but with a slight leaning to the practical be- 
cause most of those who take it wish ultimately to 
specialize in English. 
At the first meeting of the class, I am in the habit 
of making a few remarks, in substance as follows: 
There are persons who decry translations. Yet 
men of sound learning and good judgment make and 
publish them. Why do they? According to Lord 
Morley, ‘Scholars of great eminence and consum- 
mate accomplishments, like Jowett, Lang, Myers, 
Leaf, and others, bring all their scholarship to bear, 
in order to provide for those who are not able, or 
do not care, to read old classics in the originals,
-P-A-G-E-307
  A COURSE IN TRANSLATIONS 297 
brilliant and faithful renderings of them in our own 
tongue.’ And he adds: ‘Nothing but good, I am 
persuaded, can come of all these attempts to connect 
learning with the living forces of society.’+ There 
is the answer in a nutshell. If it needs corrobora- 
tion, we have only to recall that the most valuable 
and influential book ever printed in the English 
language is a translation—the Authorized Version 
of the Bible. 
The object of this course, stated in one way, is to 
connect learning with the forces of the student’s 
life. Much of the classical study that is done in our 
schools is regarded, and to some extent justly, as a 
study of ‘dead’ languages. At the moment, we do 
not need to ask whether the Greek and Latin tongues 
can be revived in most of us. Let us say that they 
should be whenever they can be. But we all know 
that, as these two languages are taught in America to- 
day, very few students ever reach the stage of profi- 
ciency where either of them becomes in all essentials 
a living medium of communication between the author 
and the reader. How many of you have ever been 
able to appreciate an entire work of literary art like 
the Aneid or the Odyssey in the original? Even a 
thorough scholar is likely to find that his attention 
is divided; he must now and then stop to puzzle out 
the words, and cannot always give his whole mind 
to the substance of what he is reading. Yet every 
time the mind is forced to halt over the meaning of 
a phrase, some part of the effect of a piece of litera- 
ture as a whole is almost certain to be lost. 
This is a course in literature. You will treat 
individual masterpieces as works of art, taking up 
important things one by one, a whole one at a time. 
In your work in Greek and Latin you have been ac- 
customed to pay more attention to small details than 
to large ones. Here you will give more attention to 
1 Studies in Literature, p. 192.
-P-A-G-E-308
  298 APPENDIX 
the larger details of structure. No detail, however 
small, is unimportant in a work of art, but we have 
authority in the words of Aristotle, the greatest critic 
produced by antiquity, for believing that some de- 
tails are of more consequence than others, and that 
the plot or main idea of a poem is by far the 
most important thing of all—just as the plan of a 
building is more important than the particular sort 
of stone employed in its construction. The plan is 
not independent of the kind of material in which it 
is to be worked out; yet, after all, one may use 
virtually the same plan for a house of marble or a 
house of granite; either building would serve the 
same purpose—it is the plan that counts. The same 
is true of an epic poem, whether in the original 
Greek or in a faithful English translation. And for 
us the structure is more easily discerned in an Eng- 
lish translation than in the Greek or Latin original. 
The wealth of material at our command necessi- 
tates selection, and where all is good selection is dif- 
ficult. We cannot avoid the omission of works that 
every one should read. You must therefore regard 
the books we are now to study as but a centre for 
your own individual reading later on. 
Human culture is continuous. Until you have read 
and meditated for some years, you cannot afford to 
bear very heavily upon what seem to be the differ- 
ences between ancient and modern times. As far 
as possible give up the distinction. between ‘ancient’ 
and ‘modern,’ and substitute the distinction between 
‘permanent’ and ‘transitory.’ 
Pay only moderate attention to what you read or 
hear about the classics, but much attention to what 
you can find in them for yourself. Observe for your- 
self; never relinquish the process. 
After these remarks I distribute copies of a printed 
leaflet containing a number of requirements and
-P-A-G-E-309
A COURSE IN TRANSLATIONS 299 
recommendations for the course, and a brief list of 
books for general reference, as follows: 
A knowledge of Greek and Latin, though desir- 
able, is not required, the work of this course being 
independent of any language but English. Rapid 
reading will be done in the best translations, with 
emphasis upon Greek masterpieces—for example, the 
Tliad and the Odyssey, selected plays of Sophocles, 
and selected dialogues of Plato. Translations from 
the Latin will be chosen for the bearing of the origin- 
als on modern literature. There will be papers and 
discussions. 
1. Students are urged to own as many of the books 
employed in the course as circumstances permit, and 
to form the habit of marginal annotation. 
2. A general knowledge of the life of each author 
studied may be obtained from the works of refer- 
ence recommended in the accompanying list. 
8. Students must become familiar with classical 
geography; see the atlases noted in the list. It is 
desirable that each secure a map of the eastern 
Mediterranean, to be hung near his desk. 
4, Punctuality in work and attendance is impera- 
tive. Under ordinary circumstances work that is 
behindhand will not be accepted. By an unexcused 
absence the student indicates his willingness to fail in 
the course. 
5. The work of the first semester is so related to that 
of the second that it is desirable to take the course 
either throughout the academic year, or not at all. 
6. The formal work of the course will consist of 
weekly papers or reports, to be read and: discussed in 
elass. These papers and reports each student is to 
preserve, in proper sequence, in a note-book kept solely 
for this purpose. The note-books may be called for at 
any time; they will be submitted to the instructor at 
a last meeting of the class before the term examina- 
ons. 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
300 APPENDIX 
7. Appointments for personal conference will be 
arranged. 
Careful reading should precede all writing. The 
object of each paper or report should be thoroughness 
and truth. Literary finish and individuality of ex- 
pression are desirable. 
The aim of the course is a lasting acquaintance with 
classic story and ideals, as an indispensable basis for 
the appreciation of English literature. 
Among works of reference the following are recom- 
mended: 
Histories of Greece Histories of Greek Literature 
Grote Jebb, Primer 
Curtius Mueller 
Bury Croiset 
(The best work under this 
head, Croiset, should be 
History of Rome consulted, by those who Mommsen read French, in the un- 
abridged edition.)

There are bad books as well as good; for the pur- 
poses of this course make use of no work save those 
that are recommended, without consulting the in- 
structor. 
The leaflet, it will be observed, aims at simplicity. 
It would be a mistake, for example, to discourage the 
undergraduate by mentioning too many unfamiliar 
books at the outset. The class is expected to procure  
-P-A-G-E-311
A COURSE IN TRANSLATIONS 301 
my version of the Poetics of Aristotle (Ginn’), The 
Greek Genius and its Influence (Yale University 
Press), Jebb’s translation, in one volume, of Sopho- 
cles (Cambridge University Press), the Iliad, in the 
translation of Lang, Leaf, and Myers (Macmillan), 
and the Odyssey in that of Butcher and Lang (Mac- 
millan). Im general, one may either own the books 
employed, or use the duplicate copies in the Univer- 
sity Library. 
Here follows a scheme of the work, arranged 
according to weeks, 
1. Read at least three, and preferably more, of the 
selections in Cooper, The Greek Genius and its Influ- 
ence; abstract, what you deem of special importance ; 
and combine in a paper of about 500 words. 
2. Report upon what you think important or doubt- 
ful in the first fifteen chapters of the Poetics of Aris- 
totle. The use of the introductory matter in my ver- 
sion of the Poetics is optional. 
3. Report on the remainder of the Poetics; where 
you can, supply examples of your own. 
4, Paper applying the principles of Aristotle to 
the Biblical story of Joseph in Genesis 37, 39-45. 
Memorize the speech of Zeus on fate and free will, 
near the beginning of the Odyssey (1.83243; Butcher 
and Lang, p. 2), and the speech of Creon when he first 
sees the body of his son, in Sophocles’ Antigone (lines 
1261-9 ; Jebb, p. 169). 
5. Report on Butcher, Aristotle’s Theory of Poetry 
and Fine Art (Macmillan), chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, in the

the poem. No paper or report. 
[32a. No. 32 may be divided into halves, if the 
schedule permits, and then the intensive study of a 
few lines at the beginning of the poem will consti- 
tute the final task for the year. At the last meeting 
of the class, the students are advised to read further 
in Milton during the summer.] 
I shall not attempt to defend particular choices 
in respect to the masterpieces read, or the books 
used, or the order of the assigned tasks. The selec- 
tion of the parts and the order of the whole have 
been modified, though not essentially, in the lapse of 
years, and may be said to represent the best I can 
devise in view of the accessible means, and the kind 
of student to be dealt with. I have a firm belief in 
the efficacy of the course. A somewhat detailed ac- 
count of it has been given, because frequent inquiries 
are made concerning it, because there would be no 
great difficulty in adapting it to conditions in other 
institutions, and because, in my opinion, too much, 
relatively, is said and printed on the ways in which 
teaching should be done, and too little on the actual 
working out of courses in which theory and practice 
are combined, and which have lived long enough to 
justify their existence.

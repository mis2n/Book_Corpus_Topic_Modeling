PREFACE 
Aut well-established subjects of instruction in the 
public schools are more or less standardized and uni- 
form throughout the country. The fields of science, 
mathematics, English, and history have been carefully 
outlined. Instruction in vocational subjects is not so 
well defined, and it may take many more years to 
determine the proper subject-matter and methods in 
order to secure desired vocational results from such 
instruction. 
Agriculture has been taught in the public schools for 
a sufficient number of years to warrant the following 
conclusions: — 
(a) That agriculture as a subject of study contrib- 
utes to certain great values and controls of life; 
(b) That agriculture applies directly to concrete 
problems of everyday life, whose solution has 
educational values; and 
(c) That the study of agriculture liberalizes the ed- 
ucation of the student as well as trains him di- 
rectly in the vocation of farming, resulting in 
improved farm practice. 
Agriculture is one of the major vocations and basic 
industries. There is a fund of agricultural knowledge 
which has grown opt of the experience of farmers and

of the educational work of the land-grant colleges for 
the past fifty years, and this agricultural knowledge 
has been and can be taught. Our problem is to or- 
ganize that part of agricultural science and practice 
which is teachable in the public schools, and to estab- 
lish such principles and methods as will guide in the 
proper teaching of the subject. Agriculture in the pub- 
lic schools should have a decided vocational aim. It 
should give the student a degree of accurate knowl- 
edge and skill and familiarity with the best modern 
farm practices. Agricultural education should guar- 
antee that the future farmers be educated country 
gentlemen who work with their hands, and gather 
about them the best things which civilization affords. 
Within these pages are recommendations concern- 
ing the aim, the scope of work, the principles, materials, 
and methods to be used in teaching agriculture in ele- 
mentary and secondary schools.

INTRODUCTION 
Tuat the teaching of agriculture should be at- 
tempted at all was until recently quite commonly 
regarded as one of the fads that would speedily perish 
in the wreckage of its own failures. Instead, it has 
lived, and to-day it constitutes a basis for the recasting 
of many of our convictions, not only as to the materials 
and methods, but also as to the ideals and purposes, of 
education. 
Whether the chief purpose in any individual in- 
stance is the education of farmers, or whether it is the 
utilization of the materials and methods of farming for 
the purpose of a general education, the living force, if 
there be any, in agricultural materials lies in the two 
facts: first, that agriculture is a part of nature; and 
second, that by these agricultural materials we make 
use of natural facts and forces for the definite end of 
sustaining life. 
It has been but inevitable that some mistakes 
should be made in our earlier attempts to teach this 
complicated and difficult subject. We have often been 
quite uncertain as to whether we were teaching a sci- 
ence or an art, or whether after all our principal pur- 
pose was not, perhaps without our knowing it, to edu- 
cate men. If the former were our purpose, we were 
very strenuous about materials, and if the latter
-P-A-G-E-8
viii INTRODUCTION 
assumed greater prominence in our minds, we empha- 
sized methods. 
We have often forgotten that even in so far as agri- 
culture is a science, it is not an exact science like math- 
ematics. Much bad teaching has been done, no doubt, 
simply because of a determination to compel the stu- 
dent to get his lessons and to maintain grades indica- 
tive of a creditable academic standard. Have these 
grades or credits been too easily earned? Then the 
course has been stiffened by adding a mass of “‘ mem- 
ory work” not very different in purpose or character 
from the “ busy work ” of the lower grades. It must be 
definitely understood that no student in any branch 
of a natural science will ever make the grades that are 
sometimes found in mathematics, for example, where 
a mark of perfection is clearly possible. 
But academic standing is not the true measure of 
success, either in the teaching or in the study of agri- 
culture. That measure is found in the performance of 
those who actually go to the land, live there, and suc- 
ceed; for, after all, the fundamental purpose of our 
great system of agricultural education is to insure a 
better agriculture and to make a country life as nearly 
perfect as possible. 
The object of agricultural education is not even to 
arrest the tide that flows cityward and turn it back to 
the land, although that is one of the results; but the 
great purpose is to fit for country life those who have 
east, or who are about to cast, their lots with the farm,

emphasizing the fact that when proper attention is 
bestowed upon this great calling, it will find of itself its 
proper place in affairs American, and that that place 
will be both high and serviceable. 
Any man who writes a good book upon any phase of 
this great subject of agricultural education performs a 
distinct service to his day and generation. It is too 
much to expect that any book will be faultless, espe- 
cially in these pioneer stages of a new science, but 
Professor Nolan has labored long and faithfully to put 
out an honest piece of work. I am sure it will be read 
with both pleasure and profit by his many friends 
and the many seekers after truth in this new and rich 
domain.

THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
I 
SOME REASONS FOR TEACHING AGRICULTURE 
Aims for individual students. Since agriculture has 
been admitted as a subject of study in the public 
schools, we are asking the question, What shall be the 
aims and what are the intrinsic values of such a course 
of instruction? What shall be the aim of agricultural 
education for the individual student, and what contri- 
butions should such education make to a democratic 
society? We hear a great deal about pre-vocational 
agriculture, non-technical or general agriculture, prac- 
tical or vocational agriculture, but there seems to be no 
clear-cut line of division between these so-called fields 
of agriculture. There may be a justification for the 
terms “ general ” and “ vocational ” agriculture when 
we mean to include in the former all such general and 
interesting information about plants, animals, and 
other materials and processes of agriculture as his- 
tories, values, relationships, and principles of the in- 
dustry and business; and when under vocational agri- 
culture we mean the knowledge and skill necessary 
for successful farming. In both general and vocational
-P-A-G-E-12
  2 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
agriculture there must be educational values for the 
individual, such as all science is able to give. The 
specific aims of vocational agricultural education for 
the individual student are, (1) to give the pupil who 
intends to become a farmer preparation for wholesome 
and successful farming and country life; (2) to give 
the skill and knowledge necessary to the control of 
plant and animal production, to the end of economic 
profit; and (3) to articulate such education with other 
education so as to produce an educated country gen- 
tleman who works with his hands and gathers about 
him all the best things which civilization affords. 
Social aims in view of modern demands. Any sub- 
ject that contributes in any constructive way toward 
the great fundamental needs, values, and controls of 
the human race deserves to be taught to the people 
and to the children of the people. Such a subject ag- 
riculture has come to be, and it should be taught in 
school and out of school, in season and out of season, 
to the hosts who are coming to learn. 
Sane modern demands would have our natural re- 
sources conserved, rural life vocations made more effi- 
cient, the health of the country folks conserved and 
improved, a greater appreciation of all art, a perma- 
nent and persistent moral growth, a closer and more 
efficient rural organization, and a more liberal educa- 
tion among the whole rural population. 
To these modern demands of public-spirited think- 
ers and leaders, agriculture, in its threefold aspects
-P-A-G-E-13
  REASONS FOR TEACHING AGRICULTURE 3 
—as an industry, a business, and a life, — comes with 
large contributions to meet each demand. 
Conservation of natural resources. It is perfectly 
clear that through scientific agriculture most of our 
natural resources can be conserved. To improve and 
make permanent the fertility of the soil, to maintain 
and to increase crop and animal production, to im- 
prove the breeding of plants and animals, to combat 
and control insects and diseases among crops and ani- 
mals, to conserve and plant the forests, to utilize 
wisely the mineral resources, — these are all questions 
of scientific and technical agriculture, and the teach- 
ing of agriculture must result in the wise use and con- 
servation of these natural resources. It is not a ques- 
tion of the conservation of the soil, for example, on 
the farm of Mr. Brown, for his own good alone; it is 
a public question, and concerns the public welfare. 
Enough surveys have been made to show that we are 
safe in generalizing on this point, — that our natural 
resources are not being conserved properly, and that 
scientific agriculture makes for conservation. 
Inefficiency in rural vocations. We need no further 
proof than common observation and government sta- 
tistics to generalize again and say that rural life voca- 
tions are not as efficient as they should be. When the 
corn crop averages only about twenty-five bushels 
per acre, and the wheat crop about fifteen bushels; 
when the annual income per acre averages only about 
twelve dollars; when insects destroy our crops to the
-P-A-G-E-14
4 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
extent of millions annually; when the live-stock pro- 
duction decreases about eight per cent every decade; 
when farm machinery is left to deteriorate under the 
open sky; when roads are impassable in prosperous 
country districts for several months each year; and 
when there occurs great rural exodus of young folks 
each year, — there must be some inefficiency some- 
where. The fault is not placed, nor the whole remedy 
suggested, but it must be clear that scientific agricul- 
ture will give greater efficiency to these vocational 
interests and contribute much to their improvement. 
Health in rural life. Surveys by several state boards 
of health in various sections of the country have shown 
that the health of the country~people is not so well 
conserved or looked after as that of the city people. 
There are more cases of tuberculosis, typhoid fever, 
and other infectious diseases in the country per capita 
than in the city. With the fresh air, pure water, whole- 
some food, etc., of which country folks boast, this 
ought not to be. The demand is, therefore, made upon 
educational institutions, subjects of study, and modes 
of life that this condition be improved. It goes with- 
out saying that the very nature of the farmer’s voca- 
tion, as he works in the sunshine and air, with every 
opportunity for living in almost perfect obedience to 
the laws of life making for health, ought to be a fac- 
tor for better rural health. A more general study of 
scientific agriculture in all that it involves, will create 
a better attitude toward science, will give more defi-
-P-A-G-E-15
  REASONS FOR TEACHING AGRICULTURE 5 
nite knowledge as to the better ways of living, and will 
make direct contributions toward the improvement 
of sanitary and health conditions of the home and 
community life. 
A greater appreciation of art. Rural life is entitled 
to the two great sources of permanent happiness, the 
creation and appreciation of the fine arts. To be able 
to produce and to appreciate any one form of art, will 
lead to a greater appreciation of all other arts, and 
thus open an avenue to larger joys in living. The 
new-old art of landscape gardening has in it all the 
essentials of a fine art. It may be the adequate ex- 
pression of a genuine emotion, using the finest mate- 
rials in all creation, the grass, shrubs, flowers, and 
trees. The teaching of agriculture brings large contri- 
butions to this fine art. It should result in more 
beautiful countrysides, towns, and cities, and its influ- 
ence should extend to a greater appreciation of all art. 
When scientific agriculture results in a greater econ- 
omy of time, allowing more leisure and a saving of 
labor, then men and women will have more heart and 
ability to produce and appreciate not only the land- 
scape art, but other fine arts, such as music, painting, 
architecture, and literature. 
Moral growth. The conservation of all things of 
real worth, whether material or spiritual is possible 
only when the moral standards of men are high and 
progressive. There can be no permanent agriculture, 
no preservation of health, no genuine art, no social
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
integrity without such moral standards as those ex- 
pressed and implied in the Golden Rule and the two 
great commandments. Before going too far afield 
with this preachment, let us ask what contributions 
the teaching of agriculture can make to this demand 
for moral growth. If the teaching of agriculture re- 
sults in no other motive than that for personal aggran- 
dizement, then all is in vain so far as moral worth is 
concerned. But if there results through the teaching 
of agriculture a spirit of service for the common good, 
an ideal for instance of permanent soil fertility, im- 
proved plants and animals, preserved forests, better 
roads and rural institutions for the benefit not only 
of the present generation, but for the future genera- 
tions, then there has been inculcated into the minds 
and hearts of the people, the essence of moral growth, 
and a practical means of service. No small factor con- 
tributing to the moral training of boys and girls is the 
work of caring for plants and animals and the asso- 
ciations with life and its realities in the open country. 
Rural organization. Some enthusiastic rural-life 
workers go so far as to say that better organization of 
rural life and forces is the greatest demand of our 
times. Be that as it may, it is a well-known fact that 
agriculture and rural life are notoriously unorganized 
as compared with other interests and industries. 
There are three good reasons why this is true; the 
great number of farmers, their isolation, and their 
extreme individualism. Because there are these diffi-
-P-A-G-E-17
REASONS FOR TEACHING AGRICULTURE 7 
culties is no reason why there should not be better 
organization. They who cannot work together, or 
will not work together, are the natural prey of those 
who can, and for the reason of mere self-defense, rural 
organization is essential. It is furthermore a biological 
principle that the greater the organization and co- 
operation of the parts of a body, the higher the form 
of life represented in that body. If rural life would 
grow in all its parts and relations, it must therefore 
be organized and codperative. Now the teaching of 
agriculture leads directly to rural organization. It 
organizes boys’ and girls’ clubs, it teaches codperation 
in buying and selling, in combating insects and dis- 
eases, in building roads, in consolidating schools, and 
in general agricultural and rural-life improvement. 
Liberal education. The education of the people 
collectively and individually may be thought of as 
technical or vocational, and liberal or cultural. Agri- 
culture is the vocation of most of the people in the 
country, and all that is included in the science and 
art of agriculture would certainly be technical edu- 
cation of practical value to the country people. In 
addition to this education, country folks should have 
a liberal education in such fields of learning as are 
usually covered in an accredited public high school. 
English, for example, would be a subject in the lib- 
eral education of the farmer, and a technical subject 
for the professional writer or speaker. On the other 
hand, agriculture would be a subject of liberal edu-  
-P-A-G-E-18
8 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
cation for the professional writer, and at the same 
time a technical subject for the farmer. A wide ex- 
tension of the teaching of agriculture in the public 
schools would liberalize the education of men in all 
vocations as well as give technical training to the 
farmer. Furthermore, to give scientific, technical edu- 
cation along the line of any vocation leads the student 
to liberalize and broaden his general education in 
other lines. The teaching of agriculture, therefore, 
both gives technical training to the farmer and leads 
to a liberalizing of his education, and contributes to 
the general education of all men in all vocations. To 
be concrete, accurate information about plant food 
elements and the conservation of soil fertility should 
be of general educational value to men in any walk 
of life; such information made practical is technical 
knowledge for the farmer, and in the study and appli- 
cation of this knowledge, the farmer is led into the 
field of botany, chemistry, economics, etc., where his 
education is broadened and liberalized. As his suc- 
cess in scientific agriculture leads to greater prosperity, 
books, travel, schooling, etc., bring the farmer’s life 
into larger and more liberal fields of education. 
According to the statements of many educators, 
the teaching of agriculture requires the services of a 
teacher better trained academically, and better trained 
in psychology, pedagogy, and methods, than does the 
teaching of any of the subjects now included in the 
school curriculum, |‘ The teaching of agriculture em- 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
REASONS FOR TEACHING AGRICULTURE 9 
braces the whole of a teacher’s art. It is a pervasive 
and exacting subject. It embodies the most impor- 
tant aspects of character building; for in teaching 
pupils scientifically to plant, cultivate, and harvest 
farm crops, and to care for farm animals, we are train- 
ing them in some of the most valuable lessons of life. 
Industry is not only explained and commended, but 
it is realized. (tt has been amply demonstrated that 
those persons who have had special training along the 
lines of agriculture are able not only to make this sub- 
ject a vital one in the schoolroom, but in the com- 
munity as well. Tax payers and parents have come 
to feel that our schools must offer instruction in the 
real activities of life.” 
What Dr. Coulter says of the value of science in 
education applies to agriculture. “If the proper in- 
tellectual result of the humanities is appreciation, 
whose processes demand self-injection, the proper and 
distinctive result of the sciences is a formula, to obtain 
which there must be rigid self-elimination. The stand- 
ard of science is absolute, founded upon eternal truth. 
Two such distinct mental attitudes as self-injection 
and self-elimination must receive attention in educa- 
tion, which cannot be complete without both.” 
Rural problems. The foregoing paragraphs have 
merely attempted briefly to state some of the sanest 
demands of modern education, and to say rather arbi- 
trarily without elaborate proof that the teaching of 
agriculture will contribute in large measure to the  
-P-A-G-E-20
  
10 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
adequate supplying of these needs. We may organ- 
ize these demands as rural problems and state them 
in another way and come to the same conclusion that 
the teaching of agriculture will help materially in 
solving the rural problems. 
We may suggest three main groups of rural prob- 
lems, to which the teaching of agriculture must turn. 
a. The problems of farm improvement. How can we 
improve the soil? How can we have better breeds 
of plants and animals? How can we have better 
systems of farm management? How can we bet- 
ter protect against the ravages of plant and ani- 
mal diseases and pests? These are all questions 
of increased productivity and constitute one 
‘group of rural problems. But from the stand- 
point of the consumer as well as from the farmer, 
we have not yet solved the farm problem when 
we have increased productivity. We find a sec- 
ond group of rural problems, namely: — 
b. The problems of marketing and exchange. How 
can the farmer get money to carry on his business 
to advantage? How can he best buy his supplies? 
How can he best sell his products? Here are 
matters of highest importance, and problems of 
a knotty character. There arises in connection 
with the development of agriculture a third 
group of problems: — 
ce. The problems of community life. This group com- 
prises such questions as the efficiency of rural 
/
-P-A-G-E-21
  REASONS FOR TEACHING AGRICULTURE 11 
government; the influence of the rural home; 
the improvement of the rural school; the lead- 
ership of the rural church; the attainment of 
adequate social and recreative facilities; the 
maintenance of a high standard of morals; the 
beautifying of homesteads and roadsides. 
These are practical working groups of rural prob- 
lems, stated here in order to show a line of approach, 
or a point of view in teaching agriculture. It must be 
fairly evident at the outset that efficient teaching of 
agriculture must and will help solve the problems of 
farm improvement, of marketing, and of community 
life, especially when we consider agriculture as an in- 
dustry, as a business, and as a life, and teach it in this 
threefold aspect.
-P-A-G-E-22
I 
NATURE-STUDY PRECEDING AGRICULTURE 
Nature-study principles. Since agricultural mate- 
rial and agricultural life deal constantly with the 
things and processes of nature, an intelligent under- 
standing of, and sympathy with, these things and 
processes would seem necessary in order that men and 
women be able to adjust themselves best to the envi- 
ronment in which they “live, move, and have their 
being.” Nature-study proposes to give boys and girls 
in the earlier grades of the public schools this acquain- 
tance with, and interest in, the natural world which 
will furnish a basis for further study of the pure and 
applied sciences to those who continue in school, and 
for those who drop out of school, and this will be by 
far the larger number, an intelligent interest in nature 
which will contribute to their success and happiness 
in whatever walk of life they may follow. _ 
When we think of nature-study in a sane way, there 
can be no objection to it, either from the ultra-prac- 
tical farmer or the most theoretical pedagogue. Be- 
fore the seventh grade of the public school, agricul- 
ture should probably not be taught as a vocational or 
technical subject. Nature-study should here be the 
content and spirit of the work. Nature-study should 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  NATURE-STUDY PRECEDING AGRICULTURE 18 
be pre-vocational to agriculture. It will underlie and 
prepare for future work in agriculture whether taken 
up in school or as a life vocation. We may not always 
be sure it is best to introduce subjects, merely be- 
cause practical grown-up men think that the subjects 
are useful. Farming is one thing, and teaching agri- 
culture in the public schools is another. What ap- 
peals to the man may not appeal to the child at all. 
The agriculture in the lower grades should be nature- 
study. The principles to guide in the selection of 
materials, and in the teaching of nature-study in the 
grades of the public schools, may be stated as fol- 
lows: — 
a. The definition — Nature-study is a direct ob- 
servation study of the common things and proc- 
esses of nature, from the standpoint of our human 
interest in nature as it touches our daily life 
directly. 
b. Nature-study should be differentiated from 
technical science, both in subject-matter and 
method. It may contribute to a further study of 
the sciences, but it should not be technical sci- 
ence, even though reduced to words of one syl- 
lable. 
c. The aims: (1) To give general acquaintance 
with, and interest in, the common things and 
processes of nature. (2) To give training in accu- 
rate observation as a means of gaining knowledge 
direct from nature. (3) To give pupils useful 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
14 
  THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
knowledge concerning natural objects and proc- 
esses as they directly affect human life interests. 
. The method of all nature-study should be obser- 
vational. The teacher and pupils must here 
escape from textbooks and four walls. Nature- 
. study and agriculture are live subjects and they 
are out of doors: Pupils must see real things 
and think for themselves. 
. The materials to be studied must be the most 
common and the most interesting from the stand- 
point of everyday life. 
f. Nature-study must be for the child and not for 
the adult. We must recognize the principles of 
child study in all nature-study work. Primary 
grade pupils ask, “ What is it?” Intermediate 
pupils ask, “How?” Upper grade pupils ask, 
“Why?” in the presence of nature phenomena, 
and the school, through nature-study should an- 
swer these questions for the child. 
Nature-study for primary grades— grades one 
and two. In the first years of the school there is sure 
to be much unorganized nature-study. The purpose 
in these grades should be to give general acquaintance 
with, and to arouse interest in, the common things 
and processes of nature. The children of these grades 
ask, “ What is it? ” in the presence of nature. Birds, 
trees, insects, flowers, wild animals, and pets, should 
be the general topics. Select the nearest at hand and 
most interesting nature material. A detail study
-P-A-G-E-25
NATURE-STUDY PRECEDING AGRICULTURE 15 
should not be attempted. It is better to return again 
and again to the same interesting things of nature, 
than to try to “ finish ” in a stated time. The sequence 
of the seasons should be a large factor in the selection 
of nature-study material. During the autumn months 
work may be done with animal pets, animals that 
work for us; learn the names and the simple life his- 
tory of a few common insects; a few trees, ten or 
twelve, should be recognized and called by name, fruit 
trees and nut trees especially; arouse interest in arbor 
day and tree-planting; observe leaf coloration; note 
seed dispersal among weeds and wild plants; learn the 
names of a few common birds, and arouse interest 
in their winter migration; nature-study myths and 
stories may be used by a judicious teacher. During 
the winter months, some physical nature-study may 
be given; observe the compass and the thermometer 
and learn how to read them; observe clouds and learn 
to distinguish rain clouds from other kinds; make 
simple daily weather charts; teach relation of sun, 
moon, etc., to directions; have window boxes and 
pots with growing plants; teach the care of plants 
and animals in winter; note signs of approaching 
spring, the arrival of early birds, the opening of early 
buds, ete. Simple lessons in hygiene may be put on an 
observation basis and be made good nature-study. For 
the spring months, note early spring activities in 
nature; begin in a simple way a bird calendar; learn 
to recognize by song and sight ten or a dozen com-
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
mon birds; note the opening of the flower and leaf- 
buds in the trees; learn to know the common spring 
flowers, avoid formal dissections, learn their names 
and where they grow; children of these grades may 
have school gardens, working in groups; field trips 
to study brook-life, pond-life, field and forest should 
be made whenever possible. Have all excursions well 
planned, and keep the attention of the children con- 
stantly to the natural things and processes about them. 
Nature-study in third and fourth grades. Since 
these grades of the public school usually take up oral 
and home geography, and since this work should be 
placed largely on an observation basis, and deal with 
the common things and processes of nature, the na- 
ture-study work of these grades and the home-geog- 
raphy may be combined as one course. The general 
topics usually outlined for home geography will make 
good nature-study material, and the work outlined 
for the preceding grades will give good preparation 
for this phase of nature-study. It must be remem- 
bered that children of these grades not only ask, 
“ What is it? ” in the presence of nature, but “ How?” 
introduces many of their questions, and their study 
and observations must answer these questions. Au- 
tumn activities of farm and home will furnish good 
subject-matter for the beginning of the nature work 
in these grades. Location of country homes and roads; 
maps of school grounds and home grounds should 
be made; interpretation of maps of local regions; les-

sons on hills, valleys, streams, prairies, etc.; methods 
of communication and travel; food stuffs bought and 
sold in the community; harvesting, marketing, stor- 
ing, and preserving of food for man and farm animals 
in autumn; observation lessons upon the principal 
farm crops and animals of the community; not a tech- 
nical study, but merely such interesting information 
as will arouse interest in farm life and affairs; learn 
about the wild animals of the State, our friends and 
foes among them. During the winter months, the 
pupils may study and observe the materials used in 
building our houses, lumber, stone, brick, clay, etc.; 
observe effects of weathering on these materials; have 
pupils confer with workmen who will gladly give in- 
formation about building material; study water, how 
we get water, how plants get water, effects of water on 
land forms, formation of ice, snow, etc.; observation 
of common types of soil, grow plants in pots of rich 
soil and poor soil; study hygienic and sanitary con- 
ditions of the school and home surroundings; study 
evergreen trees and their especial adaptation to win- 
ter conditions, learn names of more trees; in studying 
the various industries taken up in the elementary 
geographies — fishing, lumbering, mining, manufac- 
turing, farming, etc., use the materials of the indus- 
tries, as far as possible for nature-study work. For 
the spring work of these grades, garden work is well 
adapted. Each pupil should have his own plot of 
ground, either at school or at home. Pupils should
-P-A-G-E-28
  18 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
note the home markets for local and foreign sup- 
plies and learn where the products go and come, 
from the markets; note time required for germination 
of seeds; identify weeds as they appear in yard and 
garden; study flowers, wild plants, shrubs, and trees 
in connection with beautifying the home and school 
grounds; review constantly the pupils’ acquaintance 
with common trees, wild flowers, birds, insects, grains, 
and grasses of the community. All these topics should 
be unified and organized about the home life and in- 
terests of the community. 
Nature-study in the fifth grade. (May be alter- 
nated with sixth-grade work, and both grades com- 
bined each year.) Since so large a number of the school 
population drops out about the fifth and sixth grades, 
it becomes very important that the nature-study 
work of these grades should give to the future citizens 
correct and helpful information along biological and 
physical lines, enabling them to adjust themselves 
more sympathetically and intelligently to their en- 
vironments. It would seem best therefore in these 
grades to have some rather intensive work along the 
larger and more important groups of nature mate- 
rial touching human interests. Economic considera- 
tions appeal to children, but these should not be over- 
emphasized. In this and later grades the children in 
addition to asking “What” and “How,” are ask- 
ing “‘ Why.” They want to know the reasons for nat- 
ural things and processes. Children should keep good 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  
NATURE-STUDY PRECEDING AGRICULTURE 19 
notebooks, prepare pictures, charts, calendars, etc. 
It should not be the aim in these grades to attempt 
technical science, but to arouse a permanent and in- 
telligent interest in the common things and processes 
of nature, so that the boy or girl may become a citi- 
zen, able and willing to enter a vocation and to do 
effective economic work for his community, because 
of a better understanding of natural things, laws, and 
processes. 
It will not be in place here to outline a course of 
study in detail for this grade. Suffice it to say that 
trees and insects should furnish the large topics for 
the autumn work; domestic and wild animals, soil, 
rock studies, and simple astronomical observations, for 
the winter months; and garden work, bird studies, 
field and orchard observations, the work for the spring 
season. In this grade credit for home work in garden 
projects may be allowed. The pupils of this grade 
will usually be able to assimilate about as much in- 
formation along the line of the large topics mentioned 
above as the teacher of these grades can give. If the 
work be put on an observation basis, related to prac- 
tical interests, and carried on out of doors and with 
nature material as far as is possible, there is little dan- 
ger of its becoming too technical or advanced for this 
grade, and the interest and information acquired will 
be of permanent worth to the boys and girls. 
Nature-study in the sixth grade. (May be alter- 
nated with the fifth-grade work, and both grades  
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
combined each year.) In the sixth grade we may be- 
gin a correlation of physical nature-study with geog- 
raphy and arithmetic. At least two periods a week 
may profitably be given to special topics in physical 
nature-study, such as light, heat, sound, and elec- 
tricity, keeping always in mind the nature-study 
viewpoint, and avoiding science abstractions. The 
work in both the fifth and sixth grades should gradu- 
ally point the way to the sciences and vocations 
which it has served to develop and introduce. 
The large topics for general study throughout the 
year should be water, its properties and relationships; 
elementary studies of air and its relation to life; sim- 
ple tools and mechanical principles; heat, what it does 
and how produced; light, sources and applications in 
common processes of life; sownd, principles applied to 
common utilities; simple studies in electricity, and its 
common uses; simple chemistry of cleaning and sani- 
tation; elementary life relations of plants and animals 
to the various physical processes and phenomena 
studied. 
The nature-study work of the fifth and sixth grades 
should be a sort of general science training, enabling 
the pupils to find intelligent and sympathetic adjust- 
ment to their natural environment. This is necessary 
whether as a preparation for adult living without 
further academic training, or for a prerequisite to 
further scientific study.

UI 
ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE AND BOYS’ AND 
GIRLS’ CLUB WORK 
Some suggestions as to content of courses, and 
methods. It is an easy step and a proper one from 
the nature-study work of the lower grades of the 
schools to elementary agriculture. “ Agriculture in 
the grades is something more than nature-study. It 
is nature-study plus utility. It is nature-study with 
an economic significance.” ! Below the seventh grade 
agriculture as a vocational subject should not be 
taught, with the possible exception of the club work 
when carried on in the fifth and sixth grades as de- 
scribed later. In the seventh and eighth grades it 
should be taught as intensively and extensively as 
the capabilities of the pupils and the training of the 
teacher will make possible. The emphasis should be 
placed upon the vocational phases of the subject. It 
should be assumed as a point of view that here, in these 
grades, the pupils are having their last chance to study 
agriculture in a systematic way in school; therefore, 
the major topics of agriculture must be taught as 
thoroughly and as practically as possible. It should be 
furthermore assumed that the students are studying 
1 From Davenport’s Education for Efficiency.
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
agriculture to prepare for the vocation of farming, and 
hence the practical vocational features should receive 
the emphasis. In the face of these assumptions, if the 
pupils should continue the study of agriculture beyond 
these grades, or go into other vocations than agricul- 
ture, the point of view above taken will not in the 
least handicap their progress. If, on the other hand, 
the assumption prove true, the direct vocational train- 
ing will be of inestimable value to the student. 
Two methods of procedure are used in teaching 
elementary agriculture in the grammar grades. 
The textbook method. Basing the work as far as 
possible upon the seasonal sequence of actual farm 
operations and interests, this method follows some 
good textbook in the study of the principles and 
practices of the major phases of agriculture, such as 
agronomy, animal husbandry, the farm physical plant, 
farm business, and horticulture, supplementing the 
work in proper order and proportion with laboratory, 
field, and home practical exercises. In most cases it 
has been found best to give this work to the combined 
seventh and eighth grades, divided so as to provide 
two years of work and given in alternate years. Under 
this plan the first year’s work is given to the plant 
industry, and the second year’s work to animal hus- 
bandry. When the seasonal sequence can be followed, 
illustrative material is easily obtained, the interest of 
the pupil is at once awakened, and codperation with 
the farm activities is natural and inevitable.

  2m THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
More detailed outlines of these courses are given in 
the Appendix. 
An elementary textbook, with plenty of reading 
matter giving full discussion of principles and prac- 
tices of well-known and established agricultural in- 
formation, should be in the hands of each pupil. Sim- 
ple laboratory exercises and demonstrations, having 
a direct bearing on agricultural practices should oc- 
cupy at least two fifths of the class work time. A great 
part of these exercises may well be field trips taken 
by the entire class, or home work, related to the sub- 
ject under discussion, done by the individual student 
on the home farm under definite direction. A very 
good method, and at the same time one wholly prac- 
ticable, would be to give two or three formal class- 
room textbook recitations per week and require two 
or three definitely assigned pieces of home work, of 
an agricultural nature, per week. Form blanks, upon 
which the parents could vouch for the work done each 
week or month, would facilitate this method of cred- 
iting home work in agriculture. Unfortunately, no 
text has been prepared, or lists of home work sched- 
uled, to fit into such a plan. Textbook work, wherein 
correct scientific principles of agriculture are learned, 
as well as laboratory and actual farm practice, is both 
a practical and necessary part of successful agricul- 
tural training in any grade of school instruction. 
Home project work described in more detail under 
the high-school courses, may be a large feature of
-P-A-G-E-35
ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 25 
the methods used in the seventh and eighth grade 
agriculture, supplementing the text and laboratory 
work. The homes and farms of the open country fur- 
nish the best laboratories for school instruction that 
can be provided for any school. 
It must be clear to the reader that this work in 
elementary agriculture can best be given in the con- 
solidated rural:schools, where better-trained teachers 
are usually found, where supervision is provided, and 
where more time is allowed for the subject than is 
possible in the one-room country school. Good work 
in elementary agriculture, however, can be done in 
the one-room country schools, and in the seventh and 
eighth grades of the city schools, and the handicaps 
of each of these classes of schools should not prevent 
them from undertaking instruction in the elements 
of agriculture. 
The home project club method. Basing the work 
upon home projects, this method organizes the activi- 
ties and studies around the subject-matter of these 
projects carried on by the boys and girls as members 
of groups, generally known as boys’ and girls’ clubs. 
These agricultural clubs are associations of boys and 
girls for the purpose of growing or producing the most 
and best of a specified product on a certain area of 
ground, under definite rules which all agree to follow. 
These clubs at first emphasized the competitive fea- 
tures of their work, but more and more they are get- 
ting away from wrong standards too often set up by
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
large awards, to the ideal of good work well done, with 
the products successfully disposed of, as a sufficient 
reward for the work. The work of the girls in these 
clubs usually centers about garment-making, canning, 
gardening, and poultry-raising. 
Mr. O. H. Benson, National Club Leader, states 
the definition as follows: “ Club work is an organized 
system of extension teaching for young people through 
demonstrations in the field and home. It contem- 
plates the organization of young people into groups 
called clubs, for the purpose of definite work under 
carefully prepared projects, and with adequate local 
leadership.” “‘ Eventually these clubs, which are now 
widespread, will probably be incorporated into some 
more permanent form of educational organization; 
but they are performing a useful function as at present 
constituted, and they seem to be an important link 
in the evolution of a more efficient system. The clubs 
are being closely affiliated with the work of the pub- 
lic schools and are beginning to be regarded as a de- 
finite part of the educational system.’’! 
Club work may well begin in the fifth and sixth 
grades of the school and continue as the basis for 
agricultural instruction throughout the seventh and 
eighth grades, and even into the first years of the high 
school. 
The purposes of boys’ and girls’ agricultural club 
work as set forth by J. H. Greene, Illinois State 
Leader, are: — 
1 From Leakes’s Means and Methods of Agricultural Education.
-P-A-G-E-37
  ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 27 
1. To teach practical vocational agriculture. 
2. To help boys and girls to become producers and 
thereby lessen the high cost of living. 
8. To teach business methods and thrift by pro- 
moting the selling of products and the canning 
of the surplus. 
4. To stimulate community spirit in boys and girls 
through the organization of neighborhood or 
school clubs. 
5. To capitalize and turn to good account the gang 
spirit naturally inherent in boys, by directing 
their vacation activities along social as well as 
economic lines. 
6. To provide a plan whereby the public school 
system and the various religious and civic or- 
ganizations can together give direction to young 
people along the lines indicated by providing: 
(1) capable leadership and (2) suitable awards. 
Tn the study and practice which contribute to vocational 
efficiency we may distinguish three aspects, each involving 
distinct pedagogical characteristics and special problems 
of administration. To train the horticulturist, for example, 
it is necessary to give him a variety of practical experiences 
in working with soil and plants, and with the problems of 
marketing. In addition, he may and should study those 
phases of botany, physics, chemistry, entomology, bac- 
teriology, meteorology, economics, etc., which contribute 
useful technical information and principles. A further field 
of possible study is found in the history of horticulture, and 
the practice of that craft in other parts of the world, the 
evolution of plant life, etc. The first group of studies and 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
practices may be called the concrete, specific, or practical; 
the second group, the technical; and the third, the general 
vocational studies.t 
Boys’ and girls’ club work affords excellent oppor- 
tunity for the practical aspects of a system of voca- 
tional education, involving these three pedagogical 
divisions. 
Dr. Snedden further states in his Problems of Sec- 
ondary Education that the keynote of the newer edu- 
cation in these fields is to be found in the development 
of facilities for obtaining the practical experience un- 
der conditions as nearly approximating those of the 
actual vocation as can be obtained. 
In the field of agricultural education this seems 
especially desirable, although in most of our schools 
the practical work is little more than an “ imitation ” 
of the real thing, because of administrative difficul- 
ties connected with the organization of definite units 
of practice in some phase of the actual vocation. The 
only practice that will prove to be worth while edu- 
eationally and vocationally is that which requires the 
student to organize, on an economic basis, certain 
agricultural activities which he will carry through to 
the final fruition. The growing of an acre of corn, 
the cultivation and management of a home vegetable 
garden, the care and handling of poultry, the raising 
of pigs, etc., are agricultural projects commonly car- 
ried on by boys’ and girls’ clubs, and these projects, 
1 From Snedden’s The Problem of Vocational Education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  
ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 29 
properly directed by the public schools, offer excel- 
lent opportunities to furnish practical work and the 
vocational training for the grammar grades which is 
most satisfactory both to the schools and to the homes. 
More will be said in this connection under the dis- 
cussion of home projects for the high-school agricul- 
tural work. 
It may be well to go into further detail on the sec- 
ond method, since it is coming into greater favor 
among agricultural education leaders. Under the 
plan, the boys and girls who are to take agriculture 
are organized into clubs, and assigned to definite 
home projects. Among the projects usually carried on 
by the clubs are corn-growing, pig-raising, poultry- 
raising, gardening, dairying, potato-growing, tomato- 
growing, garment-making, and a number of others 
depending upon local conditions and interests. All 
the members of the class take the same one or two 
projects for the year and for a second year the class 
may take new projects or continue the old ones as 
seems advisable and practical. 
The following general outline of a home project in 
corn-growing indicates the method of using this work 
as a basis for the work in elementary agriculture: — 
1. Plans for club organization for codperative work 
in buying, selling, exhibiting, and social activ- 
ities. 
2. Calendar of monthly operations giving details 
for all field and indoor work, notebook, and
-P-A-G-E-40
  
30 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
record work, reading and study for each month 
of the year. 
8. Study of the technical subject-matter on corn 
production from the selection of the seed to the 
harvesting and storing of the crop. These stud- 
ies should parallel in so far as possible the home 
practical work, and include all closely related 
topics. 
4. Laboratory exercises, correlated with the proj- 
ect work in seasonal sequence. 
Similar plans for many home projects may be 
worked out as a basis for the elementary agriculture 
of these grades.

IV 
HIGH-SCHOOL AGRICULTURE 
Some curriculum problems. The first questions al- 
ways arising with the introduction of agriculture into 
the high school are, (a) What are the purposes of the 
course? (b) How much time shall be given to it? (c) 
How shall the work be fitted into a unified science 
course? and (d) How shall the subject-matter be 
organized and presented? The writer is fully aware 
that the final word has not been said in reply to any 
of these questions, nor does he presume to say it in 
these pages, but the teacher of agriculture must have 
a working theory and a clear, definite program for 
himself in order to accomplish satisfactory results. It 
is to set forth some guiding principles in the teaching 
of high-school agriculture that the following answers 
are set down to the foregoing questions. 
The principal aim of high-school agriculture should 
he. vocational = to “contribute to “the practical” edu 
cation of thé farmer. “Teaching the Subject ‘with this 
aim and by the methods necessary, need not lessen 
the value of the subject as a factor in the liberal edu- 
cation of the student, should he decide not to enter 
the vocation of farming. The high schools located 
near the great masses of the farming population may 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  32 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
serve in this capacity much better than the colleges, 
and being better equipped in every way than the 
elementary schools, they may plan to do vocational 
work of greater value than is possible in the elemen- 
tary schools. 
How much time should be given to agriculture in 
the high school? It will depend to a large extent upon 
the training of the teacher, the location of the school, 
and the general interest_of the community. There is 
a strong opposition growing up among the men at 
work in high-school agriculture against the one-year 
general course, and a tendency to put in two or more 
years of agriculture, devoting single semesters to spe- 
cial phases of the work, such as agronomy, live stock, 
horticulture, etc. Even when only one year at a time 
can be given to agriculture, secondary-school men are 
preferring to give one year to plant industry and one 
year to animal husbandry, in alternating years, rather 
than to give the one-year general course with its ency- 
clopzedia hodge-podge of everything pertaining to agri- 
culture from corn to the celestial spheres. There might 
not be the objection to the one-year course as a gen- 
eral study, providing that types of the larger topics 
were taken up and studied thoroughly, rather than 
an attempt to cover every important phase of the 
major divisions of agriculture. Agricultural education 
leaders are recommending the four-year course in 
agriculture for all high schools prepared to emphasize 
vocational training in their curriculum. 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  HIGH-SCHOOL AGRICULTURE 33 
Teachers of agriculture cannot say how or where 
other courses of the high-school curriculum should 
be given, but they may claim at least_one fourth of 
the student’s time in school for this subject. It is 
very desirable that the work in agriculture be in- 
cluded in some way in a unified science course which 
our science teachers are trying to work out for the 
high schools. A year of general science may well pre- 
cede any high-school course in agriculture. Botany 
should precede or parallel farm crops; zodlogy, ani- 
mal husbandry; chemistry, soil fertility; and physics, 
farm mechanics. Perhaps in some such order as given 
above, the ‘years’ courses will be given best. A com- 
mon and successful program of studies offers for the 
first year, Agronomy, including farm crops and the 
elements of soil physics and soil fertility for the first 
semester, and General Horticulture for the second 
semester; for the second year, Animal Husbandry, 
including dairying and poultry; for the third year, 
The Farmstead, including farm mechanics, engineering 
and management; and for the fourth year, semester 
units in Horticulture, Improvement of Plants and Ani- 
mals, or other special phases of agriculture as best 
suited to the community and school needs. 
We are hearing a great deal these days about uni- 
form courses in agriculture, reorganization of secon- 
dary courses in agriculture, national systems of agri- 
cultural education, etc., but so long as agricultural 
conditions and interests of widely separated regions
-P-A-G-E-44
  34 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
differ, so long will all attempts to make uniform or 
national systems of agricultural education fail. In 
the organization of subject-matter for the courses in 
secondary school agriculture, teachers will continue 
to be guided by local and State interests and by the 
textbooks adopted for the courses. The following 
units are quite generally accepted, and fairly good 
texts are available in each for high-school use. One 
unit is a year’s work. 
Junior and senior high-school agriculture. The 
tendency to the organization of the public schools on 
the so-called “ six and six plan,” raises the question 
of agricultural education in the junior and senior high 
schools. Consistent with the suggestions made in 
former paragraphs on the content of courses for the 
seventh and eighth grades in elementary agriculture, 
the following outline for junior high-school agriculture 
is submitted: —

Agronomy in the high school. Agronomy is a divi- 
sion of agriculture treating of the factors in crop pro- 
duction and the economic production of the various 
farm crops. It makes an excellent first-year subject 
in an agriculture course, because it touches so many 
phases of agriculture, and lays a good foundation as 
an introductory branch. The growing of crops is the 
basis of all agriculture. We plough, fertilize, and cul- 
tivate the soil in order to grow crops. We depend 
upon farm crops for the production of live-stock. We 
manufacture and use implements in order to produce 
and harvest farm crops. We fight to control insects
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
and plant diseases in order to save the crops. We de- 
pend upon crops for the supply of human food, cloth- 
ing, and a large part of our shelter. We buy and sell 
farm crops as a commodity in many branches of busi- 
ness. 
It would seem, therefore, that agronomy, dealing 
with the production of farm crops, should precede and 
introduce other phases of agriculture in the high 
school. This subject may be introduced under vari- 
ous names, such as Agronomy, Farm Crops, Intro- 
ductory Agriculture, etc., but it should always be 
vocational, not an agricultural “kink” to botany, 
chemistry, or general science. These subjects should 
be given as pure sciences, and the various phases of 
agriculture, as applied sciences. In the study of the 
pure sciences in the high school, illustrations of prin- 
ciples should be made, and applications of laws seen, 
from all vocations and human interests, not from 
agriculture alone. 
Agronomy properly taught includes applications of 
botany, chemistry, physics, zodlogy, geology, etc., 
and leads to practical economic crop production. It 
motivates the study of these sciences and has prac- 
tical value in itself. The teacher of agronomy may 
well go afield at times, into any of these pure sciences, 
in order to make sure that his pupils are learning the 
vocational agronomy that will “stick” and serve’ 
them in practical production. It is not necessary, 
however desirable it may be, that the high-school 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  HIGH-SCHOOL AGRICULTURE 37 
student have had these pure sciences in order to learn 
the agronomy that will make him a successful pro- 
ducer of crops, and if he becomes that, he is more 
likely to follow up later with a study of the related 
sciences, than he is to follow his pure science with prac- 
tical, vocational agriculture. 
As an introductory course in agriculture, agron- 
omy affords opportunity for the study, (1) of plant 
propagation and the principles of plant growth; (2) of 
economic farm crops; (3) of soils and plant foods; (4) 
’ of farm machinery used in connection with crop pro- 
duction; (5) of insects and plant diseases affecting the 
crops studied; (6) of elementary work in breeding; and 
(7) of crop rotation and problems of farm manage- 
ment and other farm business. Many of the phases of 
agriculture necessarily included in the study of agron- 
omy are taken up later as special courses, and the 
introductory study here made furnishes a basis for 
future work. 
A study of agronomy in the high school should lead 
to an understanding of the processes of plant growth, 
of the factors in crop production, together with an 
appreciation of the scientific basis underlying them, 
some knowledge of a few special crops, a fair amount 
of deftness in laboratory work and other practical 
exercises, ready and accurate observations, and the 
formation of right ideas of agriculture and country

Animal husbandry in the high school. Animal hus- 
bandry is usually given in the high school as a gen- 
eral course including a study of types and breeds and 
the care and management of domestic animals. The 
course may well be given in the second year of a three- 
or four-year course in agriculture. When the high- 
school course in animal husbandry extends through- 
out the year, the first semester is usually a general 
course in live-stock study, and the second semester 
a special course in dairying, poultry, feeds and feed- 
ing, or other special phases of animal husbandry. In 
some instances the general course and the special 
course run parallel on alternating days throughout 
the year. The emphasis laid upon any phase of ani- 
mal husbandry will vary considerably in different
-P-A-G-E-57
HIGH-SCHOOL AGRICULTURE 47 
localities, depending upon the live-stock interests of 
the community. 
Various outlines for secondary courses in animal 
husbandry have been printed and issued by many 
State colleges of agriculture, State departments of 
education, and by high-school instructors. Valuable 
suggestions may be obtained from most of them, but 
in by far the greater number of cases the teacher of 
agriculture in the secondary school adopts a textbook, 
and the sequence and material taken up in the book 
furnish the outline as well as the principal subject- 
matter for the course. Such textbooks as Plumb’s 
Beginnings in Animal Husbandry, Harper’s Animal 
Husbandry for Schools, and others, are worth more 
as guides to the teacher than all the outlines pub- 
lished. A good teacher will supplement the text by 
lectures and assigned readings in bulletins and agri- 
cultural reference books. 
Probably the greatest needed supplementary help 
in teaching animal husbandry in high schools are 
laboratory manuals giving practical exercises in gen- 
eral live-stock study. The instructor may make up his 
own list of laboratory and practical exercises by ref- 
erence to various texts, State courses, bulletins, and 
circulars of the States, and the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. 
Much of the material equipment for the animal 
husbandry work will be found on the farms of the 
community. Score cards, lantern slides, charts, and 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
models of farm animals are valuable equipments to 
be supplied for this work. In many cases it may be 
practical for the school to own some live-stock for 
demonstration purposes. The agricultural library 
should be supplied with up-to-date books on live- 
stock, and the school should receive one or more of 
the best live-stock periodicals for use by the students. 
The animal-husbandry work of the high school lends 
itself easily to home projects, boys’ and girls’ club 
work, and other extension features described later un- 
der these phases of agricultural teaching.

dry in high school, including lists of practical field 
and laboratory exercises follows: —

Lesson Plan 
Title: Some Values of Good Live-Stock on the Farm. 
Aim: To give some knowledge and appreciation of the values 
of good live-stock on the farm. 
(Classroom recitation, using questions, statements, and 
discussions inductively to develop the aim as stated above.) 
Subject-matter and method: — 
I. Introduction. 
“Every boy with good red blood in his veins loves 
to associate with farm animals.” The farmer boy 
has a chance to see, know, and enjoy the life in the 
country. “ How many have enjoyed the compan- 
ionship of a farm animal?” (Almost all.) Besides 
this value which every country boy appreciates, we 
must learn other values of farm animals to the 
farmer and his farm. 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
56 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
II. Presentation. 
A. Through questions and leading statements, the 
following facts brought out by the students, with- 
out being told: — 
Farm animals. 
1. Provide food and clothing. 
2. Help to maintain soil fertility through 
the return of manure to the land. 
3. Utilize much of the waste material on the 
farm. 
4, Perform necessary farm labor. 
5. Make possible farmhand labor all the year 
round. 
B. If all these values result from farm animals, does 
it make any difference whether the animals are 
pure-bred or “ scrubs” as to the extent of the 
values we have stated? 
1. The story of “Gold and Gilt.” (See Illi- 
nois Extension Circular No. 1.) 
2. The story of the difference between the two 
cows is given as an example of a general 
truth for all farm animals, — that good farm 
animals are more profitable than “ scrubs.” 
8. How can the farmer profit by this example? 
III. Conclusions. 
Summarize statement of facts and principles learned. 
Horticulture in the high school. The high-school 
course in horticulture should consist of at least one 
half unit and be given preferably during the second 
semester of the first year of the agricultural course. 
When general science is given the first year of the 
high-school course, the agricultural work may well 
follow during the sophomore year, offering agronomy
-P-A-G-E-67
  HIGH-SCHOOL AGRICULTURE 57 
the first semester and horticulture the second semes- 
ter, thus giving the year to the plant industries. 
It will be an exceptional community that could not 
profit by a semester’s study of horticulture. The prop- 
agation of plants, the planting and care of fruit trees, 
the raising of a vegetable garden, the beautifying of 
home grounds, are phases of horticulture that are 
practical, and usually needed in all sections of the 
country, in urban as well as rural communities. If 
the community is one especially well adapted to hor- 
ticultural pursuit, a second semester may be given to 
a study of special phases of horticulture such as vege- 
table gardening, landscape gardening, small fruits, 
tree fruits, forestry, etc. This one half unit should be 
offered among the elective courses in the senior year. 
Horticultural subjects lend themselves to school 
work as well if not better than most phases of agricul- 
ture. Like agronomy, horticulture is a good intro- 
ductory course, since it deals with many phases of 
agricultural science. There is plant propagation, fruit- 
growing, vegetable gardening, floriculture, landscape 
gardening, viticulture, forestry, entomology, plant 
pathology, soil problems, marketing problems, etc., 
all included in a general course in horticulture, and 
this, together with a semester’s work in agronomy, 
recommended for the first year of agriculture, con- 
stitutes a unit of plant industry making an excellent 
first year’s work in agriculture for the high school. 
A half unit of horticulture, beginning in the second
-P-A-G-E-68
58 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
semester, may follow the seasonal sequence of spring 
operations, and make a very interesting and practical 
general course. A few days given to the study of farm 
forestry in February, followed by tree fruits, prun- 
ing and spraying, plant propagation, vegetable and 
landscape gardening, during March, April, and May, 
will outline the work in general horticulture in good 
seasonal sequence. 
The materials included in the horticultural course 
will vary in different sections, but in the main the 
larger topics mentioned above would be included. In 
any case the number and kinds of fruits, vegetables, 
or other horticultural plants will be selected with ref- 
erence to the local needs and the time at the school’s 
disposal. The greater emphasis in most schools teach- 
ing horticulture will be placed upon fruit-growing 
and vegetable gardening. These courses can be taught 
effectively in the high school. 
There is a splendid opportunity for varied, useful, 
and interesting laboratory and field work in connec- 
tion with a course in horticulture. Probably one half 
of the class time should be given to laboratory and 
field work. Many phases of horticulture admit of the 
home project method of practical work. Planting a 
catalpa grove, setting out a young orchard, rejuvenat- 
ing an old orchard, beautifying home grounds, grow- 
ing strawberries, growing a garden, growing flowers, 
or any single vegetable or fruit on a large scale, are

ried on at the home grounds. The use of the school 
grounds has been discussed in another chapter, in 
which suggestions for horticultural work are given. 
Field trips to nurseries to inspect stock, to orchards 
to note pruning, spraying, and cultivation methods, 
to vineyards, to packing-houses, to public markets, 
and to canning-factories should be made whenever 
possible. All excursions should be well planned, and 
definite requirements made for each individual as to 
observations, note-taking, and collections. 
Equipment for work in horticulture should, if pos- 
sible, include a greenhouse. There should be flats, 
flower pots, soil sieves, and other needed tools such 
as grafting and budding knives, pruning knives and 
saws, illustrative material used in spraying, a barrel 
spray pump mounted on wheels, fruit packs, garden 
tools, etc.; in fact the equipment for horticulture in 
school should be practically the same as that for the 
business in a successful way on the farm. 
The agricultural library should contain all the avail- 
able circulars and bulletins from the United States 
Department and from the State College of Agricul- 
ture. Good horticultural journals and books should 
also be provided for the students’ reference. 
Horticulture offers an excellent field for community 
extension service. Illustrated lectures, public demon- 
strations of pruning and spraying, fruit and vege- 
table exhibits, arbor and horticultural day at school, 
and boys’ and girls’ club work are some activities in

Special elective courses in agriculture for one half 
unit credit for junior or senior year. Following the 
courses in plant industry, which includes agronomy 
and horticulture, and the courses in animal hus- 
bandry, — the two major groups of agricultural 
studies making up two units of high school work, — 
there may be offered several elective courses of one 
half unit weight in the junior and senior years. Such 
courses would include Soils, The Farm Physical Plant 
or Farm Engineering, Farm Management, Improve- 
ment of Plants and Animals, Poultry Husbandry, 
Dairy Husbandry, Vegetable Gardening, and other 
special phases of plant industry or animal husbandry 
which the needs of the local communities may demand, 
and the school is able to offer. 
A study made by Mr. S. H. Dadisman, of the Cali- 
fornia State College of Agriculture in 1917, shows that 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  HIGH-SCHOOL AGRICULTURE 65 
farm mechanics is an unsettled course, and that many 
changes and much shifting of places in the curricu- 
lum are seen in connection with this subject among 
the schools of the country. It seems to be finding a 
settled place in the third and fourth year. Farm man- 
agement is strictly a fourth-year subject. The newer 
courses are providing a half unit of special soil work 
in the third and fourth years. Mr. Dadisman reports 
that animal husbandry is popular as a second-year 
study in the Western States, while in the Middle and 
Eastern States it is found commonly in the fourth 
year. 
The Committee on Agriculture for the National 
Education Association has recommended that such 
courses as Farm Mechanics, Rural Engineering, Farm 
Management, and special courses in plant and animal 
studies be offered in the third and fourth years of 
agricultural courses. The following outlines of special 
courses will suggest the nature of the work included 
under half-unit credits for Soils, Farm Physical Plant, 
Farm Management, and Improvement of Plants and 
Animals, Poultry Husbandry, Dairy Husbandry, and 
Vegetable Gardening. In all cases a good text should 
be in the hands of the pupils, and the work as outlined 
by the text supplemented by bulletins, reference read- 
ing, field trips, and laboratory work as good teachers 
will be able to do.

1 By the right approach the instructor can very briefly give the student an excel- 
lent knowledge of the reproductive process in plants and animals, and incidentally 
impart a fund of extremely valuable information. The following is about the most 
successful outline of procedure: — 
Begin with the ovum, the female cell among animals, a common example of which 
is the egg on the open market; show that the essential part of this ovum is its nu- 
cleus, which is in most cases microscopic; state that this nucleus will, under proper 
conditions, develop into a new individual of the same species; sometimes it is a 
question merely of surrounding conditions, but generally it requires the advent and 
union with a new nucleus from the male side before development takes place. 
The mechanism for bringing these two nuclei together varies widely; among 
plants, gravity, winds and insects are the common agencies, while in animals special- 
ized organs are required.

In addition to the textbook, field, and laboratory 
work outlined for the one-year general course in agri- 
culture, each student should choose one home project, 
and carry it through to some satisfactory point of con- 
clusion. The essentials of a home project, are: (1) A 
definite, detailed plan for work at home, covering a 
more or less extended period of time; (2) it should be a 
part of the instruction in school in agriculture; (3) par- 
ents, pupils, and teacher should agree upon the plan; 
(4) the home work should have competent supervision; 
(5) records and reports of the work must be kept and 
submitted to the teacher. Many of the home projects 
done in agriculture may be begun in the fall and others 
are best undertaken during the second half of the school 
year. The home project is credited in various ways. An 
additional five or ten per cent may be added to the 
pupil’s-grade in agriculture, his grade may be withheld 
until the project is satisfactorily completed, or from 
one fourth to one half unit may be added to the stu- 
dent’s school record. 
The following home projects are recommended: — 
. Equipping a farm boy’s office. 
. Poultry-raising. 
. Keeping dairy cows. 
. Raising pigs. 
. Growing a plot of corn. om

Anthology of Agriculture 
G. Stanley Hall, in his famous work on Adolescence, states 
that all branches of study relating to nature are approached 
best through sentiment, and that sentiment comes before 
utility. He believes that the reason why many branches of
-P-A-G-E-107
  
HIGH-SCHOOL AGRICULTURE 97 
science in the high school are not popular with the students 
is because they are taught in too formal and technical man- 
ner, and that in textbooks and methods of teaching, we ig- 
nore natural interests, which according to Dr. Hall lie in the 
field of myth, poetry, hero-worship, and religious sentiment. 
Here is opened a field for investigation. If Dr. Hall is right, 
then in our agricultural teaching in the high school we should 
make much of poetry, hero-worship, religious ideals, and the 
anthology of agriculture. Our standard texts have not em- 
phasized these things, and our agricultural teachers pretty 
generally hold to the technical, practical, and vocational 
lines, and are so advised by their agricultural supervisors 
and leaders. 
It might be well for some of our high-school teachers of 
agriculture to try out some work in the anthology of agri- 
culture as a supplement to the technical subject-matter 
given. Very little organization of this material is available, 
but students and teachers might work out a collection to- 
gether, and thus ascertain among small groups the response 
to this phase of agricultural interest. s 
Our literature abounds in real literary gems of agricul 
tural reference, but these have not been brought together 
to any considerable extent. Among the more common re- 
ferences containing good material of this kind, are: — 
Bartlett. Familiar Quotations. 
Pliny. Natural History. 
Pope. Essay on Man and other essays. 
Abercrombie. Folk-Lore and Garden Craft of Shakespeare. 
Roe. Success with Small Fruits, containing abundant 
quotations from literature. 
The Geneva Experiment Station, New York, has pub- 
lished volumes on each of the leading fruits of New York. 
In the introduction of each volume are liberal quotations 
from classic literature. 
Among horticultural writers whose literary tastes lead
-P-A-G-E-108

them to anthological quotations may be mentioned: Adlum, 
Bailey, Barry, Downing, Hovey, Hussmann, and Longworth. 
Students of secondary agriculture should have definitely 
assigned readings and reports from among the foregoing 
references, and from such books as The Holy Earth, Bailey; 
The Landscape Beautiful, Waugh; Adventures in Content- 
ment, Grayson; New Lives for Old and One Way Out, Carle- 
ton; Joe, the Book Farmer, Harris; The Challenge of the

SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES IN TEACHING 
AGRICULTURE 
A fundamental principle. Whatever the text, 
method of teaching, order of sequence, or content of 
subject-matter may be, out of a course of agricultural 
instruction should result as an asset to the student: 
first, clear and sure knowledge of the practical things 
to know and to do in order, here and now, to main- 
tain the best standards of crop and animal production 
known, and to make such improvements as are needed 
to reach these standards; second, good business judg- 
ment in matters of buying and selling on the markets 
of the world; and, third, social consciousness of civic 
relations as a good citizen. 
The science of agriculture and farm practice. Upon 
the introduction of agriculture into the high school 
one often hears from school boards and principals: 
“Now we must get some land and equipment right 
away.” The idea is to make the course practical, and 
the opinion seems to prevail that if the school could 
acquire land and elaborate equipment, then the prob- 
lem of practical work is solved. There are two weak- 
nesses to this proposition: first, the failure to realize 
that the science of agriculture, and the sciences con- 
tributing to it, may be as practical_to the_successful.
-P-A-G-E-110
    
100 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
vocation of agriculture as farm practice; and, second, 
that as‘our’sthools are now organized it is not possible 
to get any real farm practice from the use of school 
land. 
When we think of science as organized knowledge 
or information upon any subject, and realize that 
before there can be any scientific farm practice, the 
farmer must get the science or information, then we 
can see that a genuinely practical part of agricultural 
study would be to get the facts and principles of the 
science, and this can be done through books, lectures, 
and laboratory work. Of course, the ideal method 
of agricultural instruction would be to have the school 
out on the farm in the open country, where the stu- 
dents could get real farm practice in an economical 
way, in addition to the science they could learn from 
the books and from the practice. Even here the stu- 
dent could not get the “real thing’; for, as one 
farmer puts it, “He is not up against the hillside 
with a mule and a plough, and Betsy and the babies 
to provide for.” 
Until our schools are willing to break with tradi- 
tions, and employ an instructor of agriculture for 
twelve months of the year, procure enough land for 
profitable production, and provide manual labor at 
the disposal of the agricultural department through- 
out the year, our agricultural instruction in the high 
schools should confine itself to a study of the scien- 
tific principles of agricultural practice and such other
-P-A-G-E-111
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 101 
sciences as may contribute to a better understand- 
ing of these principles, worked out through textbooks, 
bulletins, laboratory exercises, and such contribu- 
tions to them as the instructor may be able to give, 
—and find opportunity for farm practice work by 
carrying on, in codperation with the home farm, home 
project work. 
Some principles of scientific agriculture. In order 
to be concrete in this discussion, it may be well to 
mention some principles of scientific agriculture which 
may be taught in various phases of the subject, prin- 
ciples of science which are eminently practical, be- 
cause they underlie all successful farm practice, and 
must be understood whether taught in the classroom 
or in the field. 
First, note some of the facts relating to permanent 
soil fertility. Plants must be fed; their food comes 
from the air and soil; about ninety-eight per cent of 
the plant food is carbon, coming from the air; nitro- 
gen is most often a limiting plant-food element, and 
in farm practice it is most economically supplied from 
the free nitrogen of the air by being pre-worked by 
lower forms of plant life known as bacteria, living 
parasitically upon the roots of legumes; phosphorus 
is often a limiting plant-food element and is economi- 
cally supplied by liberal applications of fine-ground 
raw rock phosphate incorporated into the soil with 
organic matter; lime corrects soil acidity, improves 
the physical condition of soil, adds a plant food, and
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
aids in rendering available other mineral foods. These 
and other facts are practical and teachable, and it 
does not require expensive equipment or farm prac- 
tice to get them. It goes without saying, however, 
that successful farm practice, involving the principles 
of permanent soil fertility, will fix the knowledge as 
no other method can do. 
Second, the principles and facts concerning the 
life-histories of beneficial and injurious insects, and 
the stages of fungous diseases well known, may be 
taught and learned in the high school through labora- 
tory, field trips, and texts, the student thereby gain- 
ing practical knowledge for farm practice; learning 
the life-history of the chinch bug and how to combat 
it with the oil-line, and good cultural methods; learn- 
ing how to treat oats for smut and to practice the 
method in the laboratory; these are all very practical, 
nor does the teaching require farm practice to give 
them worth. 
Third, before there can be improved farm prac- 
tice in breeding up and growing a productive strain 
of corn, cattle, or chickens, and making them more 
resistant to disease and other adverse conditions, 
principles and methods of plant and animal breeding 
must first be taught and learned; the learning and the 
teaching of these principles are as practical a part 
of agricultural education as their application in farm 
practice. 
In all this discussion it must not be understood that 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 103 
the writer does not appreciate the value of practical 
farm work as a method of teaching; on the contrary, 
the reader should understand that farm practice in 
the application of the principles of scientific agricul- 
ture is the ideal method of vocational agricultural 
education. The point to be emphasized is that the 
scientific principles and facts, whether they be learned 
from books, lectures, laboratories, or farm practice, 
are an essential part of vocational agriculture and 
are just as practical as the farm practice. They must 
be learned first or in connection with the practice. 
The use of textbooks. Since the teaching of any 
subject should be a systematic business and proceed 
by some plan in a more or less organized way, text- 
books have been found to be necessary in order to 
assure this systematic procedure. This principle holds 
for the teaching of agriculture. In most cases the 
textbook becomes the course of study; hence, the 
importance of good texts in the teaching of agricul- 
ture. A good text in agriculture should give ample 
space to the discussion of principles and practices of 
the phase of the subject under consideration. It is 
better to give the information which the student 
should have, in the pages of the text, than to be con- 
stantly giving references to which the student sel- 
dom goes. A good text will be fully illustrated with 
attractive pictures that supplement the subject-mat- 
ter. Laboratory and field work will be properly pro- 
vided for, with definite and explicit directions, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
demonstrate, afford practice in, verify, or discover 
principles to be taught. A good text will be scientifi- 
cally accurate, clearly and forcibly written, and pre- 
sent, especially for the elementary and secondary 
schools, stock information well established, proved 
facts, and successful practices. 
The lecture method. The lecture method in agri- 
cultural teaching is extensively used, especially in 
the case of subjects for which there has been no suit- 
able textbook. This method is generally used in col- 
leges, and this fact may account for its extensive use 
in secondary schools. It happens too often that the 
secondary teacher gives to his students the same 
material he received in college, in much the same 
manner that it was given to him. Lecturing before 
the class may be a good training for the teacher, but 
it is not so valuable for the students. The more the 
students put into a recitation the more they get out 
of it. There is no teaching until somebody learns. 
There is less likelihood that a boy or girl will learn 
through the lecture method than through other 
methods requiring greater activity on the part of the 
student. The teacher’s task is an easy one, when he 
only talks on a subject he knows. He may have to 
use methods calling for greater activities among 
pupils, and more labor on his part, if any real teach- 
ing and learning are done. 
It will be necessary for the teacher to supplement 
reports and recitations of the students, and to take
-P-A-G-E-115
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 105 
part in the discussions, but he should not use too much 
of the time. The gift of silence is of rare worth to a 
teacher. The lecture method in agricultural teaching, 
even in secondary schools, however, may be profit- 
ably used to vary the type of recitation, and to give 
the pupils some preparation for that method of in- 
struction should they ever attend college. At some 
point in the study of each large topic, a more or less 
formal talk or lecture may well be given. An outline 
of the talk should be placed before the pupils, and 
this outline, together with brief notes which students 
should take, will furnish material from which the 
students should “write up” the lecture in perma- 
nent notebooks provided for this purpose. When the 
lecture method is thus sparingly employed, it pro- 
vides variety to the recitation, opportunity to sum- 
marize and review subject-matter, drill in note-tak- 
ing, and a concrete, definite form of assignment in 
notebook work which is satisfactory in results both 
to the instructor and students. 
Reports and class recitations by students. The 
more general the participation of the students in class 
recitation the better it will be for the students. If 
classes are small and the students are fairly mature, 
informal discussions of assigned readings, practical 
exercises, field trips, and home projects are successful 
methods in classwork. When classes are large and 
the students of first- or second-year standing, it is 
often necessary to use more formal methods. It may
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
be necessary in these classes to draw out discussion 
with questions at first and gradually develop the 
topic method. 
The teacher may supplement the recitations from 
textbooks and other general class assignments by 
having students report upon special topics. Perhaps 
a bulletin of general interest to the class is assigned 
to a student who has special interest in the subject. 
A subject may be assigned that involves a study of a 
number of references, or the report may cover a special 
project or problem worked out at home or in the lab- 
oratory, or a visit of agricultural interest. This method 
should be used to develop weak students, rather than 
to exercise the most able ones. Too much of the class’s 
time should not, however, be taken up with lengthy 
special reports by individual students. 
Good class recitation methods used in teaching 
other subjects and the general rules of discipline in the 
school should prevail in the teaching of agriculture. 
Use of illustrative material. If agriculture is to be 
given a permanent place in the curriculum, it must 
be something more than a study of books. Ilustra- 
tive material, laboratory exercises, and home projects 
must be utilized. Instruction must proceed from these 
known concrete material things of the farm to the 
unknown, abstract principles of agricultural science. 
Visualization of the lessons, made possible through 
the use of illustrative materials, is essential in arous- 
ing and maintaining interest, as well as in fixing valu- 
able information in the mind.
-P-A-G-E-117
  
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 107 
Abundant use should be made of the blackboard 
in placing before students outlines of lessons, impor- 
tant points to be remembered, facts involving figures 
and data, expressed in graphic ways. Charts, pic- 
tures, and maps serve well as illustrative material. 
Stereopticons should be used wherever and whenever 
available. Much agricultural material, such as plants, 
insects, seeds, animals, etc., may be brought into the 
classroom. Permanent collections of plants, insects, 
rocks, soils, seeds, etc., in the form of an agricultural 
museum, are often the source of much helpful illus- 
trative material for classroom work.! 
Many phases of agriculture are studied most profit- 
ably out-of-doors. Growing crops, animals in barns 
or pasture, orchards and gardens, farm machinery in 
operation, — all these are best studied by field trips. 
These trips must, however, be planned and supervised 
with a definite aim in view, if they are to have educa- 
tional value. 
Laboratory methods. Agriculture has taken many 
of its methods from the teachings of other sciences; 
hence, it has utilized the laboratory method more or 
less from the beginning. It has used in many cases 
much the same materials and apparatus as those used

(1914).
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
in other sciences, or has copied in the high schools the 
exercises used in the agricultural colleges. As a result 
much of the laboratory work in agriculture lacks def- 
inite aim and application, having therefore but little 
educational or vocational value. For the sake of having 
laboratory work, which is thought by many to be in- 
dispensable to agriculture in order to give educational 
value to the course, many cheap and foreign exercises 
are often dragged in, many good exercises properly 
belonging to other sciences are borrowed under the 
name of agriculture, all of which have little benefit 
from the standpoint of vocational training in agricul- 
ture. It is possible to have such laboratory work as will 
teach practical aspects of agriculture and yet have 
all the educational value desired by the more con- 
servative of school men. 
The laboratories for agriculture need not be elabo- 
rately and expensively equipped. The great out-of- 
doors in the open country, with the farms, forests, 
fields, orchards, gardens, crops, live-stock, houses, and 
barns, affords the greatest laboratory equipment of any 
science in any school on earth. In addition to these 
only a few well-selected articles, in addition to what 
can be improvised, need be added. (See Appendix.) 
For convenience in discussing laboratory work, the 
exercises may be classified as follows: Experiments, 
Verifications, Demonstrations, and Practicums.1 
1 From Agricultural Education Monthly, United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, States Relation Service.
-P-A-G-E-119
  SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 109 
a. Experiments. Those exercises which aim to dis- 
cover truth new to the student are classed as experi- 
ments. Agriculture as a science is dependent upon 
men of research, who through their investigations are 
discovering new knowledge, much of which may be ap- 
plied to the art of farming. Much of this knowledge is 
now available in books and bulletins, so that students 
do not need to seek it from primary sources. While 
it is not the function of the high school to discover new 
truths nor even to train scientists, secondary agricul- 
tural students should become familiar with methods of 
research, especially the methods used in the agricul- 
tural experiment stations, which have such an impor- 
tant relation to the teaching of agriculture in this 
country. 
Exercises may be planned to impress upon the 
students the following essentials of an experiment: 
(1) A clear comprehension of the object of an experi- 
ment; (2) an open-minded attitude as to probable 
results; (3) control of all factors except the one tested; 
and (4) accuracy and a knowledge of probable causes 
of errors. Experiments may be performed in the labo- 
ratory or upon the farm. For example, a student may 
test the effect of different mulching material on the 
conservation of moisture with pots or cans of soils in 
the laboratory. The scales may be used and quanti- 
tative results secured. If it is desired to learn the 
effects of different mulches on the growing crop, the 
experiment may be performed with a crop on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
school or home farm. In either case the student has 
no definite knowledge of what the result will be. It 
is not to be expected that experiments will form a 
large part of the laboratory work. Those given as 
exercises should come after skill has been developed 
through verifications as suggested below. 
b. Verifications. In this class are included those 
exercises which aim to verify or confirm facts or 
principles known to the student. Most of the so-called 
experiments outlined for secondary students really 
come under this class of exercises. Such exercises are 
valuable in satisfying the student that statements of 
facts and principles or laws are true; in making more 
vivid impressions; and in developing skill in research 
methods. A student may read in a bulletin or text 
that nitrogen has a certain effect on plants under 
certain conditions. In testing out the effect in the 
laboratory or in the field he not only becomes assured 
of its truth, but he also has the fact impressed in a 
manner never to be forgotten. If the exercise has been 
planned and supervised as it should have been, he will 
have acquired some skill and developed some inter- 
est in and appreciation of the work of investigators. 
The high school should afford an opportunity for young 
men to find themselves. The laboratory exercises 
should be conducted in such a manner that those 
who have a natural leaning toward research may have 
their interest stimulated rather than checked. 
c. Demonstrations. These include those exercises
-P-A-G-E-121
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES ill 
in which the teacher or some member of the class 
uses materials and apparatus in teaching the class 
principles already known to the demonstrator. In 
case an exercise is too difficult for the students, or 
equipment is not available for each student, it may be 
conducted by the teacher, or some one who has had 
special preparation, for the benefit of the class. In this 
there is an application of the inductive method of 
teaching. Abstract laws and principles are approached 
through manipulation of materials familiar to the 
student. Each step should be clearly understood by 
the student so that when the demonstration is com- 
pleted proper conclusions may be drawn. These exer- 
cises have the same effect and value as verifications 
except that the student does not get the practice 
and the interest associated with doing the thing himself. 
There is often economy of time as well as materials | 
in a demonstration, as everything should be in readi- 
ness before the exercise begins. 
Demonstrations may be made for the purpose of 
showing students how a practicum is to be carried out. 
The teacher may prune or spray a tree or judge farm 
animals before the class in order that they may have 
- a better idea of how they are to do the work. Another 
type of demonstration will be considered under home 
projects. 
d. Practicums. Those exercises in which the chief 
aim is the acquiring of skill and in which the knowl- 
edge of the student is applied are termed “ practi-
-P-A-G-E-122
  112 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
cums.” In applying the vocational aim in agricul- 
tural education practice becomes of the utmost im- 
portance. The student cannot become successful as 
a farmer unless he becomes skillful in applying the 
knowledge he has gained. In the teaching of agricul- 
ture it is often assumed that the student is capable of 
more farm practice than he really knows. In order 
to be satisfied that the student knows the art as well 
as the science in connection with the different branches 
of agriculture covered by the course, certain require- 
ments may be made which involve skill in practice. 
If these requirements are not met by previous train- 
ing of the student or by school practicums the work 
should be done at home. For example, every student 
should know how to plough and to harness and handle 
a two-, three-, or four-horse team according to the 
practice of the community. 
Special attention should be given to practice in con- 
nection with the chief crops of the section. In corn- 
growing sections, for instance, emphasis should be 
placed on skill in such practices as selecting and testing 
seed, husking and stringing. the ears. Students of 
animal husbandry and dairying should develop skill 
in judging animals as an aid to selection; in milking a 
cow in a skillful and sanitary way; in running a sepa- 
rator and cleaning it properly; and in teaching a calf 
to drink. They should know how to mix rations suit- 
able to the requirements of economic production. In 
poultry husbandry, the student may be required to
-P-A-G-E-123
  SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 113 
run an incubator and brooder, or at least to set a hen 
in a proper manner and to test eggs skillfully. In horti- 
culture, students should become proficient in such 
practice as simple budding and grafting, making of 
cuttings, planting of trees, pruning, mixing and apply- 
ing sprays, and the packing of fruits and vegetables. 
Whoever is to direct the practicums must be skill- 
ful and thorough in every detail. If the teacher does 
not feel competent to direct the work in a line of agri- 
culture important in the community, he should call for 
the services of an expert, wherever possible. He should 
realize that the formation of right habits is very im- 
portant with the adolescent who is getting a start 
toward a vocation. Under the direction of a good 
teacher, this work becomes more than an application 
of knowledge and drill toward skill; it becomes a 
medium through which the student may express the 
best that is in him. 
Laboratory and field work should be a definite part 
of each course, and definite time provided for it. The 
proportion of the time devoted to this work will depend 
upon the course to some extent. Such courses as 
dairying and farm mechanics may be mostly practi- 
cal work while other courses may be taught principally 
in the classroom. As arule, when a subject is given five 
days a week, two of these are devoted to laboratory 
and field work, the periods for such work being double 
the length of the class recitation. It is preferable to 
have the practical work come at the end of the day,
-P-A-G-E-124
  
  114 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
as some exercises may run overtime. If the students 
do not have to attend a class after the practical work, 
they will not have to change clothes again or be con- 
cerned about their personal appearance. All exercises 
should be planned ahead, so that materials and equip- 
ment may be provided and in working order and all 
necessary arrangements made for work in thefield. Stu- 
dents should be notified of the nature of the work to be 
done, so that they may dress suitably for the work they 
are to do. Most of the practice at school should be 
given as class practicums, i.e., the students doing the 
work asaclass. The home work should be largely indi- 
vidual. It may be a problem as to how to secure the 
best results with required home work. At some schools 
special credit is given for home practicums and home 
projects. The contest idea may be used to advantage 
with students of high-school age. A day may be set 
apart for agricultural exhibits and contests covering 
such work as judging farm animals and farm products, 
rope work, fruit packing, stringing of corn ears, etc. 
Many of the home practicums will become features 
of the home projects where the project plan is in 
operation. 
Teaching farm craft. Among the educational 
changes which may grow out of the present world war 
is the attempt to teach farm craft in its most practi- 
cal aspect to the boys of the secondary schools. The 
United States Boys’ Working Reserve is an organiza- 
tion effected, under the statutory power of the Na-
-P-A-G-E-125
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 115 
tional Department of Labor, to enroll, from patriotic 
motives, boys from sixteen to twenty inclusive, for 
productive service on the farms. The appeal of this 
organization is strong, especially to city boys. It 
often-seems. necessary, in order to get the more com- 
monplace tasks achieved, that they must be recog- 
nized, dignified, and credited by some institutional or 
organized body. The United States Boys’ Working Re- 
serve is such an organization, and proposes, through 
honorable recognition and suitable rewards for serv- 
ice, to enlist boys in the work of food production and 
conservation by helping farmers in such labor as may 
be called farm craft. Large numbers of boys are en- 
listing for this service. Several educational problems 
and opportunities for the high schools arise at this 
point. 
1. What constitutes the essential features of work 
in ordinary good farm practice, skilled and un- 
skilled farm craft? 
2. How is this farm craft material to be organized 
into teachable form adapted to school conditions? 
8. With what success will high-school teachers pre- 
sent this work, and the boys get it? 
4, As measured by the work of the boys who have 
come from such school courses, are we justified 
. in attempting to teach farm craft? 
In Illinois these problems are being attacked. The 
writer sent a questionnaire to one hundred successful 
farmers of the State to ascertain what they considered 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  116 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
the essential farm-craft work in good farm practice, 
and to learn what they thought of the value of under- 
taking to teach this work in the high school. Opinions 
on these matters were also sought from as many ex- 
perts in the agricultural college. There was a general 
agreement that the following topics should be included 
under farm craft: grooming the horses; hitching and 
unhitching horses; driving and handling horses; feed- 
ing and care of horses; milking the cows; feeding the 
pigs; handling machinery in ploughing, seeding, cul- 
tivating, and harvesting; mending harness; splicing 
ropes; tying knots; repairing fences and gates; using 
properly and caring for hand-tools and machinery; 
hoeing, weeding, etc., in garden and field; feeding 
all farm animals; and doing the chores. 
This list, as may be seen, includes many subdivi- 
sions requiring various degrees of skilled and unskilled 
labor. With but few exceptions the farmers and college 
men believed that the high school could help to prepare 
boys for greater usefulness along these practical farm- 
craft lines. There was a consensus of opinion that 
specially prepared circulars, giving information, illus- 
trations, graphic instructions and definite farm-craft 
practice while in school, placed in the hands of a 
teacher, utilizing the resources of the community as 
far as possible, would be the best methods of instruc- 
tion to use. Accordingly the Illinois Division of the 
United States Boys’ Working Reserve requested the 
State College of Agriculture to prepare such a series
-P-A-G-E-127
| 
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 117 
of farm-craft circulars, and the State Council of De- 
fense secured the codperation of the high schools of 
the State to undertake this instruction. In order to en- 
courage and facilitate this work, all school authorities 
in charge of high schools were urged to adopt rules and 
formulate plans by which boys shall not only receive 
instruction in what has been called the language of the 
farm, but that no boy should forfeit any credit or 
receive any handicap in his school because of absence 
from his classes during his sojourn upon the farm. 
Circulars were prepared by the faculty of the College 
of Agriculture on the following topics: — 
. When the City Boy Goes to the Farm. 
. Doing the Chores. 
. Grooming the Horse. 
Hitching and Unhitching the Horse. 
. Driving the Horse. 
. Feeding the Farm Work Horse. 
. Handling the Plough, Disc, and Harrow. 
. Seeding and Making the Seed Bed. 
. Destroying the Weeds.

22. Work in the Orchard. 
23, Rainy-Day Work. 
24, The “ Why ” of, Proper Steps in Handling Soil. 
25. Learning the Vocabulary of the Farm. 
In the preparation of these courses each author has 
aimed to give the minimum of technical agricultural 
science necessary to furnish a motive and an intelligent 
background for the work, and a maximum of practical 
directions, of “ What and How to Do” the manual 
work of the farm. 
Suggestions are made in each case for the specific 
school exercises which are feasible, in order to give the 
boys real practice in lines related to farm craft. 
It becomes evident at once that there are many dif- 
ficulties in the way in teaching farm-craft work in the 
school. Our teachers are not usually farmers and farm- 
ing is not done at school. If, however, the teachers 
have had farm experience and are willing to undertake 
this instruction, and if the proper facts and directions 
for the practical work are organized and presented, — 
furthermore, if teachers will take the boys to farms, 
livery barns, implement stores, and encourage them 
to take every opportunity to practice farm work, even 
on a small scale, — then such a course as here proposed 
will be at least a “ bit” of help to the boy as he goes 
to the farm to perform his service in the work of food 
production and conservation. 
The farm craft course may be supplemented by a
-P-A-G-E-129
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 119 
general reading course from bulletins, circulars, the 
best farm papers, and agricultural books, or a more sys- 
tematic general course from textbooks may be given, 
but all this reading work should not be over-empha- 
sized, nor take up too much of the boys’ time. At 
least three fourths of the students’ time in such a farm- 
craft course should be spent in actual practice in farm 
operations or with farm materials. The Illinois Farm- 
Craft Course has not been in operation for a sufficient 
length of time to formulate any conclusions as to the 
success it will have in the schools, or with what suc- 
cess it will train the boys for increased usefulness in 
actual farm work. The signs of the times are promis- 
ing, and there seems little doubt but that a farm- 
craft course has a useful place in the agricultural 
curriculum of the high schools. 
Home projects in secondary-school agriculture. In 
several States, particularly those giving State aid for 
vocational work in secondary schools, a distinction is 
made between agriculture ordinarily taught in the 
high school and vocational agriculture. If the faith 
of the people in agricultural education is to be main- 
tained, there should be only vocational agriculture in 
the high school. For those who may later follow agri- 
culture asa life-work, the high-school course should be 
a direct preparation for that work. Even though it be 
given a vocational emphasis for those who will not take 
up agricultural pursuits, the course will contribute 
to the liberal education of these students in somewhat
-P-A-G-E-130
    120 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
the same way that English will contribute to the gen- 
eral education of those who make agriculture their vo- 
cation. 
As our schools are now equipped and organized, it is 
extremely difficult, to say the least, to make agriculture 
vocational to the extent of giving farm practice with 
plants and animals on real land and under practical 
farm-management conditions. To be sure, it is true 
that to teach the sciences which underlie and control 
successful farm practice is good, practical vocational 
work; yet neither the principles nor the science of agri- 
culture become the real possession of the student until 
he has worked them out in successful farm practice. 
Until we can have a school farm for the high school 
and so organize the course of study that students of 
agriculture may get real practice in farm production 
and management under all-year instruction, the home- 
project feature of school agriculture is the best sub- 
stitute for practical instruction which can be given. 
Under this plan the instructor in agriculture outlines 
certain definite agricultural projects to be carried on 
at the homes of the students, as a part of the course in 
agriculture. 
Massachusetts was the first State to give State aid 
to vocational agriculture based upon the home-project 
plan. In 1911 the State Legislature made State funds 
available for the establishment of agricultural depart- 
ments in secondary schools. The agricultural instruc- 
tor, whose salary is paid partly by the State and partly
-P-A-G-E-131
  SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 121 
by the local community, must be a specially qualified 
teacher who devotes his entire attention to agriculture. 
Such teachers are employed for the entire year, and 
the summer months are spent in supervising the home 
projects of students. The classwork is centered around 
the home project which is required of each agricultural 
student. Since the home-project plan was introduced 
into Massachusetts, the States of New York, Pennsyl- 
vania, New Jersey, and Indiana have based school 
agriculture largely upon the home-project plan. 
The project as a basis for methods of instruction. 
According to Dr. W. W. Charters, of the University of 
Illinois, a project is a reflective act carried on in its 
natural setting. The project itself is a large problem 
carried over into action. It may be composed of a 
group of problems, which constitute subdivisions of 
the project. The project is the normal life situation. 
In school we often take these problems out of their 
natural setting in the project and study them one by 
one. The tendency is to teach the problems in isolated 
groups rather than as related to some life situation. 
The chief educational function of a project is to 
translate information into ‘conduct. To illustrate, let 
us take potato-growing as a project. In the life situa- 
tion, in the natural setting, there would be a flow of 
certain activities and problems such as preparation 
of the ground, planting, cultivating, relationships to 
the home, etc. An attack of the potato beetle appears. 
Here a special problem arises, calling for information
-P-A-G-E-132
  122 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
as to methods of control. Other interests and activi- 
ties stop for the time being, and the student sets about 
to get the necessary information and to apply this 
knowledge in the solution of the problem. After this 
problem is solved, the activities continue to the 
completion of the project. Everything connected with 
the process is in its natural setting and relates to 
definite behavior and degrees of interest. 
In the usual school situation, studying potato- 
raising, the student is related to a certain flow of 
activities and interests, such as study hours, recess, 
classes, books, groups of pupils, attitude toward the 
teacher, routine of the school, etc. The special prob- 
lem of the control of the potato beetle comes in the 
course of study. The information as to the methods of 
combating the beetle is acquired by the pupil, and the 
problem is solved, intellectually. The flow of school 
activities continues, and throughout the whole process 
a degree of interest may be manifest, but it is quite 
likely to be considerably less than in the former case. 
The project method attempts to reinstate the natural 
situation in the educational process. Conduct or 
behavior is here the aim of education, rather than 
information. In the project, intellectual matters flow 
out of conduct, and flow back into conduct. Conduct 
is a steady, flowing stream in which problematic situa- 
tions arise, are solved, and the stream flows on. 
The chief values of a project are: — 
(1) It carries information over into conduct.
-P-A-G-E-133
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 123 
(2) It arouses interest, since there are many 
reservoirs from which interest may flow, being 
tied up with life situations. 
After one has learned the theory and principles of 
how to do a thing, there is much left to be done in 
order to carry it over and apply it in the actual life 
situation. The process of carrying out a theory or 
given information is often as problematic as the the- 
ory itself. The student often needs as much assistance 
in the actual carrying-out of the technique of a project 
as in getting the necessary information. 
Farmers often report that students of school agri- 
culture are frequently helpless when they come to the 
farms to do the farm-craft work necessary in successful 
practice. ‘In order to get the complete benefits of a 
successful project, — the information carried over into 
action, — further assistance must be given the student 
in this process, and it is at this point that the project 
method affords the best help. 
The home project when applied to instruction in 
elementary and secondary agriculture, includes each 
of the following requisites, according to Mr. C. H. 
Lane, of the States Relation Service of the United 
States Department of Agriculture: (1) There must 
be a plan for work at home covering a season of more 
or less extended period of time; (2) it must be a part 
of the instruction in agriculture of the school; (3) there 
must be a problem more or less new to the pupil; 
(4) the parents and pupil should agree with the teacher
-P-A-G-E-134
ee ee pee ee 
124 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
upon the plan; (5) some competent person must super- 
vise the home work; (6) detailed records of time, 
method, cost, and income must be honestly kept; and 
(7) a written report based on the record must be sub- 
mitted to the teacher. 
A distinction should be made between home pro- 
jects and the comparatively simple exercises discussed 
under laboratory methods. These exercises for the 
most part are utilized to illustrate and apply some 
principle, or for the purpose of increasing skill in some 
farm operation. A project to be worthy of the name 
should involve skill in many operations, the applica- 
tion of a number of principles and problems of gen- 
eral management. To accomplish this it should cover 
a branch of farming that will extend over a compara- 
tively long period of time. As it is to be a part of the 
instruction in agriculture it should have a definite 
relation to the course of study. Growing an acre of 
corn would mean the application of many principles 
of agriculture and would involve skill in general farm 
operations as well as those connected especially with 
corn culture, hence it would be a suitable project for 
a student in general agriculture or agronomy. Caring 
for an orchard or a garden would be a suitable project 
for a student in a class in horticulture because it would 
involve many of the principles and practices of that 
phase of farming. Students in animal husbandry may 
select as projects the care of a flock of poultry, or of one 
or more pigs in which the general principles of animal
-P-A-G-E-135
  
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES = 125 
production will be applied. If the project is to have 
the highest educational value it must involve new 
problems. A student may grow an acre of corn year 
after year and continue to learn something new, but if 
the work of the first year has been directed properly 
it will have far greater educational value than that of 
the succeeding years. After growing corn one year, 
the student may better take up some other crop, or 
better still an entirely different phase of farming. 
Parents should be interested in the pupil’s home 
project. The boy and the teacher should consult with 
them from the beginning. The teacher should explain 
to the parents that agricultural instruction is conducted 
on the principle that there are still educational op- 
portunities at home, and that the school, in order 
properly to perform its functions, must make use of 
these opportunities. The parents must be in sym- 
pathy with the idea that the home and school need to 
work hand in hand to offer the best educational ad- 
vantages to the pupil. 
The following extracts from a letter written by H. B. 
Allen, of LeRoy High School, New York, to the par- 
ents of the boys studying agriculture in his school, 
illustrate an excellent way in which to supplement per- 
sonal interviews with the parents in an effort to enlist 
their codperation: — 
Instruction in agriculture in the high school cannot pre- 
tend to be complete and sufficient when it restricts its field 
to the classroom and laboratory. Instruction in such a sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  
126 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
ject deals with living and definite objects, although treating 
considerably of the general theories and practices relating 
to the same. Only in so far as the teaching is connected with 
everyday occurrences and the application of the general 
principles is demonstrated will the instruction prove effec- 
tive. The laboratory work and field trips are efforts in this 
direction. However well these may be conducted, the teach- 
ing has not proved effective until the pupil has solved some 
problem related to the subject and tested the thoroughness 
of his knowledge. As a practical test the home project has 
been decided upon. 
Each pupil who takes work in agriculture is expected to 
take up a home project. The project must be related to the 
subject which is being studied that year in school. Because 
of the seasonal nature of home projects they are necessarily 
being continued both during school and after school has 
closed. The instruction is so planned that school time will 
be omitted and outside time credited in order that no 
injustice may occur. 
The different kinds of home projects may be grouped as 
follows: — 
1. Productive projects. 
2. Experimental or demonstration projects. 
8. Improvement or construction projects. 
Group 1 includes those projects having for their aim the 
successful raising and care of a crop, animals, ete. Group 2 
is composed of those projects which discover or demonstrate 
some practical application of the theories and practices stud- 
ied. Group 3 isa large indefinite group which includes nearly 
all not in 1 and 2. Remodeling a poultry-house, beauti- 
fying the home grounds, would be good examples of this 
group. 
The pupil should choose some project satisfactory to the 
parents and approved by his instructor. It is intended that 
these projects shall not in any way become an unjust bur- 
den on the pupil or the home. Unreturned expense is unde-
-P-A-G-E-137
  
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 127 
sirable, and for this reason productive projects are sug- 
gested as more feasible. 
It is intended to make the project a definite problem in 
itself. It is best that the work be done in so far as possible 
by the pupil himself. This is not to restrict parental in- 
terest, but rather to prevent any lack of responsibility on 
the part of the pupil. In conducting the project the pupil 
will be supplied with all necessary blanks to keep records, 
costs, etc., in order that a complete summary of production 
and profit may result. The instructor intends to keep 
thoroughly in touch with every pupil carrying on a project. 
In conclusion, let it be stated that if a project can be 
adjusted so as to fit into the customary routine of duties of 
the pupil at home, such conditions are ideal. The project, 
however, must be a unit in itself and not neglected or over- 
looked because it may be routine. Remember that the first 
object of the project is primarily to test the instruction 
gained by the pupil, and to reinforce the instruction through 
practical experience. 
The home-project plan has not been used sufficiently 
long to have established a very definite order of pro- 
cedure. There are many problems arising in connec- 
tion with the efforts to apply the home-project methods 
in secondary-school agriculture. The following prob- 
lems are mentioned by Mr. Barrows in Farmers’ Bul- 
letin 346, of the United States Department of Agri- 
culture: — 
. Supervision of the projects. 
. Fitting the projects to the course of study. 
. Giving credit for projects. 
. Contests, prizes, and awards. 
. To what extent shall projects yield a profit. oom

6. Securing codperation of parents. 
7. Substitutes for home projects. 
8. Preparation of teachers. 
a. Suggestions for the control of home projects. In 
order to meet and solve these problems satisfactorily 
for the time being at least, the instructor in agriculture 
must be guided by principles and have pretty definite 
convictions as a working basis for procedure. The 
following suggestions may be helpful: — 
(1) Project work when conducted properly is ex- 
pensive, and supervision must be provided. Schools 
which cannot afford to hire an instructor for the full 
year, may well hesitate about adopting the plan, for 
summer supervision is most important to the success 
of home-project work. The teacher should not scat- 
ter his attention over too wide a range of projects. 
Local agricultural conditions will govern the number 
and choice of projects feasible. 
(2) If the agriculture given is a general one-year 
course, the projects may be more varied and several 
different ones carried on by members of the same class; 
if, however, the course is a special one, such as agron- 
omy, animal husbandry, or horticulture, then the 
projects should be selected within the field of study. 
It is a question whether the work and study of agri- 
culture should grow out of the project, or whether the 
project should develop from and supplement the agri- 
cultural study. In the high-school courses it has been 
found more practical to follow the latter method. Such
-P-A-G-E-139
  SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES = 129 
time as seems necessary to the successful progress of 
the project is given in the regular classwork in agri- 
culture. 
(3) The crediting of home-project work presents a 
difficult problem. It may be feasible in some cases to 
withhold the credit in agriculture until the student 
has carried out the project to the satisfaction of the 
instructor. In other cases the project has been graded 
on the same basis as the class-work in agriculture, and 
an average of the two grades taken to make up the 
final grade. Many instructors weigh the various proj- 
ects in terms of units of agriculture, and add from one 
fourth to one unit to the pupil’s high-school credits 
for the satisfactory completion of a home project. In 
the writer’s opinion this is a better way to give credit 
for home-project work in agriculture. 
(4) The project work must be related to the high- 
school instruction as a particular feature of it, yet 
those students carrying on the home projects may well 
be organized into an agricultural society or club, and af- 
filiated with the State boys’ and girls’ club movement, 
or some other national organization. The contest fea- 
tures including prizes and awards need not be em- 
phasized in the high-school project work, but with- 
out detracting from the educational or vocational 
value of the work, these club ideas may be used with 
success. 
(5) The project undertaken in high-school agricul- 
ture should be considered worth while by the student. 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
It must require effort and management, and be prof- 
itable withal. When a student carries on a successful 
project he should have hope of some reward in addition 
to the school credit he may gain. No false standards, 
such as are often given by high awards, should be set 
before the student, but the true standard of success 
and productive project. 
(6) In all efforts to secure the codperation of the 
parents in home-project work, the teacher will ac- 
complish more by working quietly to win the con- 
fidence and good-will of the parents and patrons than 
he will by making arbitrary rules. A campaign of edu- 
cation among the parents is often necessary before 
home-project methods can be successfully used. 
(7) If there are students of agriculture who do not 
live on the farm or who do not have resources avail- 
able for carrying on a home project, it is usually pos- 
sible to secure land or animals from others to carry 
on the work. Caring for dairy cows, gardening on 
vacant lots, pruning and spraying orchards, etc., are 
projects which may be undertaken on a profit- 
sharing basis with owners. 
(8) The lack of preparation of teachers to supervise 
home-project work is perhaps the greatest problem at 
present. Teachers who are prepared to succeed in the 
supervision of home projects are much in demand. It 
is worth while for teachers of agriculture to make an 
extra effort to prepare themselves for this phase of vo- 
cational agriculture. In several of the agricultural

colleges the departments of agricultural education 
are now giving special attention to practical training 
for project work.

  182. THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
Supervised farm practice under the Smith-Hughes 
Law. The Smith-Hughes Law providing Federal funds 
to the States for the salaries of teachers of vocational 
agriculture in secondary schools, states, in section 19, 
“That such schools shall provide for directed or super- 
vised practice in agriculture, either on a farm provided 
for by the school or other farm for at least six months.” 
This practical work may be either regular farm occu- 
pations or special home projects as referred to above. 
Regular farm work for this purpose implies an inter- 
pretation of the regular farm duties carried on by the 
pupil in accordance with outlines or instructions pre- 
pared by the supervisor, corresponding reports by the 
pupils to the supervisor, and actual visitation by the 
supervisor to inspect the pupil’s work and to confer 
with him. 
The home-project work, as described in the fore- 
going pages, supplies one form of supervised farm 
practice under the provisions of the Smith-Hughes 
Law. The following excerpt from Bulletin 8 of the 
Illinois Board for Vocational Education, relating to 
the supervision of regular farm work as an integral 
part of the school course, was a suggestion of the author 
in an approach to one solution of this problem: — 
In order to provide more definite standards and better 
organization of the supervised practice work in agriculture, 
we may classify the farm operations commonly found in the 
State, under the following systems or kinds of farming: — 
1. Grain farming. 
2. Live-stock farming. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 133 
8. Dairy farming. 
4. Truck farming. 
5. Fruit farming. 
6. Poultry farming. 
7. General farming. 
Should a student in the vocational course in agriculture 
choose to do his six months’ supervised farm practice in 
helping his father or as a hired laborer in any one of these 
systems of farming, then, in addition to the certificate of 
work signed by the parent or guardian to the teacher of 
agriculture, the student should have a special notebook in 
which to write, each week of the twenty-four, the answer to one 
of the twenty-four questions here submitted for the kind of 
farming he is doing. The supervisor should visit the student 
at least once each week, and the principal topic for discussion 
or demonstration for the visitation should be the point in 
question to be answered that week in the student’s notebook. 
The following points suggested for the various systems of 
farming may not come up in actual order of farm operations 
as here listed, but the supervisor should designate such 
questions for his visit and for the written paragraph answers 
in the student’s notebook as apply as nearly as possible to 
the work the student is doing on the farm at the time. A 
permanent notebook which may be labeled, ‘“‘The Smith- 
Hughes Supervised Farm Practice Notebook,” should be 
used for this work. A few introductory pages should be 
written describing the farm, the system of farming, and the 
general plan of the student and supervisor for the season. 
It would be well to set aside pages for a diary of operations 
and the work certified to each week by the parent.

For the general farming system the supervisor may choose 
from the lists on grain farming and live-stock farming any 
twenty-four points applicable to the student’s case. In fact, 
these points are only meant for suggestions and methods, 
and the supervisor should feel at liberty to adapt the points 
and reports to the student’s work and community interests. 
For the other systems of farming in which students of voca- 
tional agriculture may offer their supervised practice work, 
the agriculture teacher should carefully prepare the twenty- 
four points, admitting of practice and demonstration upon 
the supervisor’s visits and having definite notebook answers 
to be made by the student.

Norz: For the notebook work, describe each practice 
or construction, and state the fundamental principles 
learned. The supervisor of agriculture may find on 
any farm where his students are working opportunities 
to give some excellent practice from among the points 
suggested above. 
Use of reference materials. Books and other pub- 
lications intended for the use of farmers and students 
of agriculture are not only increasing in number, but 
improving in quality as well. The Department of 
Agriculture at Washington, D.C., the various State 
agricultural colleges, and many commercial institu- 
tions publish valuable material which may be used 
as reference by secondary schools teaching agriculture. 
The leading agricultural journals should be available 
for the use of the students. The teacher of agriculture 
should keep in touch with the sources of all these 
reference materials, and arouse interest in his students 
to collect and use them. Students may be required 
to obtain such available bulletins as bear upon their 
courses and projects. 
For most reference reading students must depend 
upon the school library. With so much material avail-

able there is little excuse for a high school being with- 
out some kind of an agricultural library. Much of the 
best reference material is in the free publications, but 
in such a form that it is often overlooked. The teacher 
should use a card-index system, so that students may 
readily find the available information on any topic 
which may be assigned. Bulletins should be in suit- 
able boxes arranged according to the card-index 
system in use. Covers may be provided for bulletins 
which are used extensively. If files are not kept of 
the farm papers, clippings may be made of such articles 
as have a bearing upon the subjects studied. These 
clippings may be placed in large envelopes or letter 
files and indexed under title of subject with the bulle- 
tins. If the students are made acquainted with sources 
of information and established in efficient habits in the 
use of that information, much will be accomplished 
in their training.

Agricultural extension in the high school. Contempo- 
rary educational philosophy demands a free field for educa- 
tional experimentation, an evaluation of educational attain- 
ments in terms of personal and social efficiency, refinement 
and happiness, and an expansion and extension of school 
activities.?

SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 147 
When any school or department of that school gets 
away from the monastic ideals of education, and is 
willing to bring whatever of good it possesses to all the 
people within reach, then the school not only takes 
on new life within itself, but enlists the moral and 
financial support to a larger degree of all the people it 
endeavors to serve. This has been shown in the history 
of the colleges of agriculture of the country. For a 
score or more of years the Land-Grant Colleges of 
Agriculture pursued the even tenor of their way, 
scarcely known outside the campus farm, drawing 
few students to the college, and receiving little or 
no State aid. When, however, these colleges began 
to establish extension departments, and to have the 
extension spirit, they began to enroll students by the 
hundreds, and to receive State aid by the thousands 
and millions. 
The high schools, especially since they are of aristo- 
cratic origin and have been born and bred in classic 
atmosphere, must also see to it that they break down 
the closed-wall ideals and serve the common people 
with a democratic and universal education. This the 
American high schools are beginning to do through the 
introduction of vocational courses and the develop- 
ment of the community service and extension ideals, 
and as a result of this movement we witness the most 
remarkable growth of any educational institution in all 
history, in that of the modern high school. 
With the introduction of agriculture into the high
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
school, a new and practical means of effective exten- 
sion service is possible, and the high school having 
a department of agriculture fails to see its golden op- 
portunity when it neglects extension activities along 
agricultural lines. Once the spirit and value of exten- 
sion service is felt and realized by the high school, then 
the whole school through its various activities be- 
comes a community-serving institution in the broad- 
est sense. 
a. The objects of high-school extension are: ! — 
1. To vitalize the regular work of the school by 
articulating it more closely with the home, 
farm, shop, and other forms of human en- 
deavor. 
2. To carry the benefits of the school to many 
groups who are deprived of its direct influences. 
8. To codperate with all educational agencies of 
the community which do not at present come 
under school administration, utilizing these as 
far as practical in the educational work of the 
school and community. 
4. To institute promising educational efforts 
that may result in increased human pros- 
perity and welfare. 
There are well-established educational and govern- 
ment principles underlying the movement for exten- 
sion work: —

Circular, University of California.  
-P-A-G-E-159
  SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 149 
1. Government control and direction aims in all 
good democracies to increase individual and 
social content and happiness. 
2. Whatever organized society desires to do for 
the common good are legitimate matters for 
governmental agencies to foster. 
8. A continuation of education of the right sort 
is desirable for every citizen of a democracy. 
4. Modern civilization demands of every citizen 
a@ more extensive and differentiated training 
than the conditions of a simpler age required, 
and the adaptation of educational forms and 
progress to. the changing needs of society is 
in harmony with the principle of evolution 
and gives warrant for the continued enlarge- 
ment of public school activities and increased 
financial support thereof. 
Many agencies beside the school are contributing 
to the work of education, — the home, church, theater, 
library, playground, club, workshop, farm, business 
house, press, museum, art gallery, concert hall, lecture 
platform, legislative hall, convention hall, and the 
great out-of-doors. 
Without going into detail to outline forms of ex- 
tension activities through which a high school may 
serve the entire community along many lines of human 
interest, a few suggestions, referring to the four ob- 
jects of extension work given above, may be grouped 
about these larger aims as forms of extension work.

The teacher of agriculture who plans to begin a 
policy of extension service from his department, may 
wisely practice a little “ watchful waiting.” This may 
also be good extension policy for the high school as a 
whole. It may not be tactful to announce at first any 
. extension plans, but they should early be formulated 
and set in motion, whenever and wherever the occa- 
sion and opportunity are ripe. The extent and amount 
of agricultural extension work done by the high school 
will depend very much upon the type of school in 
which agriculture is given. When the school does not 
require the teacher of agriculture to teach other sub- 
jects, and gives him at least half of his time for ex- 
tension'work, it is evident that such work will develop 
to larger proportions. 
ce. There are four rather effective methods of approach 
to agricultural extension work : — 
First, the community survey should be made.! 
1 See Appendix.  
-P-A-G-E-162
152. THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
Through the survey, the natural resources of the com- 
munity may be determined, and the nature of the or- 
ganizations and institutions affecting agricultural and 
country life interests. 
Second, home-project work, as described earlier in 
this discussion, is an excellent method of approach to 
extension service. By this method practical instruction 
in agriculture is brought to the homes of the boys and 
girls, and not only the students who attend school and 
do the project work are benefited, but the parents and 
other out-of-school folks, seeing the results of success- 
ful home-project work, may gain valuable agricultural 
information. 
Third, individual work among farmers is real ex- 
tension work, practical and possible, when the teacher 
of agriculture has time and when he is capable of 
doing it. Such work as testing seeds and milk, examin- 
ing soils, advising on points of farm management, 
pruning and spraying fruit trees, vaccinating swine 
for cholera, testing cows for tuberculosis, caponizing 
young cockerels, treating oats for smut, referring to 
authorities the different problems arising, etc., are 
common methods of individual extension work the 
high-school department may do, but the teacher must 
be “mighty sure” that he knows his ground, from an 
abundant and successful experience, as well as from 
technical scientific knowledge along the line of work 
he attempts. 
Fourth, organization of farmers’ clubs forms an 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 153 
opportunity for good extension activities by the high- 
school agricultural department. In addition to the 
organization of agricultural clubs among the interested 
students in the high school, the school may be active 
in the organization and leadership of agricultural socie- 
ties, farmers’ clubs, and country-life clubs, and other 
similar organizations among the adults of the com- 
munity. 
Where there is a county agricultural adviser, the 
school may follow up and conserve the work of the 
adviser in all his efforts at organization in the com- 
munity. 
One interesting form of codperation which is a 
splendid piece of extension work, is an agricultural 
advisory committee chosen from among the successful 
farmers of the community. These men advise in all 
matters relating to the agricultural work in the local 
high school. They may give practical talks to the 
classes in agriculture, and what is better still, they 
may take the class on automobile trips to see actual 
farm operations and conditions having educational 
value for the students of agriculture in school. 
The development of agricultural and home economic 
short courses, to which all the people of the community 
may come, will contribute more and more, like the 
folk high schools of Denmark, to the vocational as well 
as to the liberal education of the old and young of the 
open country. The community high school will ulti- 
mately not only be doing all the extension work now 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
    154 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
done by the colleges of agriculture, but vastly more and 
with much greater efficiency because it is nearer to the 
farmer’s home. 
In reply to a questionnaire sent out by the Assistant 
in Agricultural Education in the United States Office 
of Experiment Stations in 1914 to the high schools of 
the couritry, over one half of the four hundred schools 
replying reported that they were engaged in some kind 
of boys’ and girls’ club work as an extension activity. 
In most cases the agricultural instructors were acting 
as local leaders. The principle types of extension work 
done in the high schools were organizing farmers’ 
clubs, cow-testing and live-stock work, seed selection, 
speaking at meetings, and giving advice to individual 
farmers. The various kinds of extension work carried 
on by the agricultural instructors as listed in the 
report of the above-mentioned questionnaire are as 
follows: — 
Spraying Organizing clubs 
Pruning Speaking at meetings 
Grange work Cow-testing 
Testing milk Alfalfa plots 
Weed identification Corn clubs 
Testing seed corn Wheat-breeding 
Consultations Experiments 
Dairy improvement Farm visits

School contests Care of cattle

Planning and building silos Codperative associations
-P-A-G-E-165
  SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 155 
Agricultural extension work, properly carried on, 
should reach the purse, the mind, and the spirit. It 
should bring increased knowledge, added profits, and 
greater contentment and happiness to farm people. 
Local extension work enables the instructor to become 
familiar with country-life conditions, and to be bet- 
ter able to teach the pupils coming from the country 
homes. Agricultural extension work in the high school 
offers opportunity to relate the State agricultural col- 
lege, the school, and the farming population of the 
community in ways mutually helpful to all. 
The teacher of agriculture in the high school, if 
properly prepared for his work, is in an ideal position 
to do effective agricultural extension work. Extension 
work from the college of agriculture must necessarily 
be at long range and only a few people are directly 
reached. The county adviser can come in touch with 
his farm constituency only at more or less infrequent 
intervals. The high-school teacher of agriculture is 
in the community, “on the job” every day. He is 
able to prove himself the farmer’s friend and confident. 
It is his duty to make himself a vital factor in pro- 
moting better agriculture and happier country living 
throughout the community employing him. If he has 
the confidence of the farmers, they will bring their 
problems to him and heed his advice. If he cannot 
answer their questions, he will take them to some agri- 
cultural expert who is especially fitted to do so. 
Professor Hummel, of the California State College
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
of Agriculture, made a study of certain phases of 
high-school agricultural extension work and found: — 
First, that it was advisable that one half of each 
school day, preferably the morning, should be given 
by the agricultural instructor to classwork, and that 
the other half be left free for preparation, for labo- 
ratory work, and community extension work. 
Second, that the agricultural teacher should be 
hired for twelve months, a vacation of one month 
being allowed at the most convenient time. 
Third, a part of the financial support for the local 
extension work should come from the State, and a 
part from the local high-school district. A tactful 
‘teacher can find ways, however, of starting effective 
local extension work, even though no funds are pro- 
vided or moral support given. 
Fourth, the kinds of extension work may be clas- 
sified under five heads: (a) work with farmers, as 
organizing or working in farmers’ clubs, an annual 
farmers’ short-course week, field and orchard demon- 
stration, codperative experiments on farms, good seed 
distribution, seed- and milk-testing, preparing plans for 
buildings, selecting and purchasing improved live- 
stock, etc.; (6) work with farm women, as afternoon 
or evening meetings, short courses, home garden, and 
poultry experiments; (c) work with young people, as 
short courses in agriculture and home economics, agri- 
cultural contests and societies; (d) work with rural- 
school teachers, as meetings for agricultural instruc-
-P-A-G-E-167
  SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 157 
tion, assisting in conducting school fairs; and (e) work 
with rural-school children, as boys’ and girls’ agricul- 
tural or domestic science clubs, school fairs or exhibits 
of work, rural improvements, and athletic field days. 
From all these studies we may conclude that among 
the kinds of agricultural extension work found effec- 
tive in secondary schools are: — 
Short courses for men and women over school age; 
farmers’ week in codperation with the State college of 
agriculture sending representatives for extension lec- 
tures;. visiting and advising with individual farmers; 
organization of farmers’ clubs for definite purposes, 
and work in these organizations; rural schoolhouse 
meetings with farmers, with talks and round-table dis- 
cussions on agricultural and rural-life problems; assist- 
ing farmers in keeping cost and yield records; help- 
ing in balancing feeding rations for farm animals; 
suggesting improvements in crop rotations, testing 
milk, seed, etc.; distributing good seed; pruning, 
spraying, the use of hog-cholera serum, caponizing 
poultry, treating oats for smut; codperative demon- 
stration plots on farms of the community; home-pro- 
ject work among farm boys; promoting the teach- 
ing of agriculture in rural schools, and assisting in 
this work; organization of boys’ and girls’ clubs; 
getting up local fairs, contests, farm product days, 
etc.; issuing of school bulletins on timely topics, agri- 
cultural items in local papers, and agricultural sup- 
plements occasionally ; establishing farmers’ circulating 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  
  158 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
libraries; listing farmers for “sale” and “ want ” 
items at the school or in published lists-to be dis- 
tributed; and utilizing all the educational and agricul- 
tural resources of the community for the improve- 
ment of agriculture and rural-life conditions. 
Difficulties in connection with this work should not 
dismay the right kind of an agricultural teacher. If he 
is properly trained for his work and brings a man’s 
estate to the task, he need not fear failure. The agri- 
cultural teacher who is qualified to give courses in a 
high school, who is thoroughly grounded in the ele- 
mentary principles of science, who has a detailed 
technical knowledge of agriculture and a certain 
amount of training in farm practice, should be able to 
do a certain kind and amount of good community ex- 
tension work. Training in public speaking and Eng- 
lish will be of great value. Knowledge of rural sociology 
and agricultural economics will be important. Keen 
sympathy with, and an understanding of, community 
needs and welfare are essential. 
Use of land in teaching agriculture in secondary 
schools. The Office of Experiment Stations of the 
United States Department of Agriculture in 1914 sent 
out a questionnaire to all high schools receiving State 
aid, to special agricultural schools, and to normal 
schools known to have courses in agriculture. To this 
400 replies were received. Out of the replies received 
257 reported that some land was used in connec- 
tion with agricultural instruction. These schools were
-P-A-G-E-169
  
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 159 
distributed rather representatively in the Eastern, 
Southern, and Middle Western States. Of the 257 
schools with land, only 82 reported farm animals. 
Over one half of the school farms had 6 acres or less. 
There were 58 farms with over 20 acres. The report 
shows that of the 257 school farms, 150 were growing 
corn; 129, garden crops; 84, potatoes; 75, oats; 61, 
alfalfa; 42, cotton; 35, wheat; 29, clover; and 20, sweet 
potatoes. 
Some of the larger uses to which the land was put 
were 827 acres for crop rotation, 593 acres for general 
demonstrations, 382 acres for raising pure-bred seed 
for distribution among the farmers, 206 acres for dormi- 
tory supplies, 166 acres for fertilizer demonstrations, 
and 166 acres for general experiments. 
A question was asked as to whether the school farm 
was essential in secondary-school agricultural instruc- 
tion. The replies indicated that a majority were op- 
posed to the school farm. In stating the advantages 
and disadvantages of the school farm, replies indicated 
that the advantages were all educational, and the dis- 
advantages arose in connection with the management 
of the school farm. 
Advantages referred to were that the school farm 
made instruction real, gave the student some practical 
work, supplied laboratory material, and gave oppor- 
tunity to carry on demonstrations for the benefit of 
the pupils and farmers. The principal disadvantages 
were that help was hard to get, the land poor, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  160 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
instructor’s time was poorly spent. Many difficult prob- 
lems of management arise. The farms are small, build- 
ings and equipment poor or absent, help of men and 
teams must be hired, the investment is high in propor- 
tion to the acreage cultivated and to the crops ob- 
tained, and the agricultural instructor seldom lives on 
the land or is employed for the entire year. The farm- 
ers of the community are likely to criticize the school 
farm if the agricultural instructor does not make it 
produce crops with a profit. It is questionable whether 
the school farm should be managed for profit; it is 
even doubtful whether it should be called a “ farm,” 
if land at the school must be managed at all. School 
plots which seem to have met with the best success 
are those which grow pure-bred seed corn, small grains, 
alfalfa, potatoes, etc. This plan enables the school to 
get good seed to be distributed in the neighborhood. 
Fruit trees, forest and ornamental trees, and berry 
vines, may be grown on the school plot and distributed 
in a similar manner. No objection can be raised to the 
use of school land when it becomes the distributing 
center for high class seeds, plants, and trees. The 
same idea may be extended to the use of live-stock 
on the school land. By the use of pure-bred sires good 
live-stock may be distributed over the community. 
The use of student labor on school plots is a vexing 
problem. Outside of a few hours per week which may 
be required as laboratory time, no adequate amount of 
labor, such as successful farming requires, can be de-
-P-A-G-E-171
SOME METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 161 
manded of students regularly attending school. The 
three types of work usually done on the school land 
are, preparation of the land, planting of the crops, and 
harvesting. Pupils usually have little time or oppor- 
tunity for the work of cultivation. 
When we consider the small size of the school plot 
and the number of students taking agriculture, it may 
readily be seen that the student can get but little 
actual experience in farm operations, and that the 
instructor can simply show what has happened under 
certain conditions. The school farm would, therefore, 
seem to be justifiable only as a center of distribution 
of pure-bred seed, good varieties of plants, and of the 
services of pure-bred animals; as a demonstration of 
certain principles in agricultural instruction; and as an 
outdoor laboratory for the production of agricultural 
material for class use. In order to succeed with these 
purposes, the school must provide labor and super- 
vision the year round.

  VI 
THE TEACHER OF AGRICULTURE 
The most important factor in education is the 
teacher. If agricultural instruction is to be effective, 
if the faith of the people in agricultural education is 
to be maintained, we must have efficient agricultural 
teachers. It is, perhaps, more essential that teachers 
of agriculture in elementary and secondary schools be 
prepared to teach well the subject-matter of agricul- 
ture than those in the colleges. Strong students may 
gain information in colleges in spite of the poor meth- 
ods of instruction too often common there. 
Teacher-training courses in agricultural education 
are being established and extended rather rapidly in 
normal schools and colleges of agriculture, and we are 
now able to find good teachers both technically and 
professionally trained to teach in elementary and 
secondary schools. The man with the pure science 
training, who was “brought up on the farm,” may 
have been a good pioneer in agricultural teaching, but 
he cannot satisfy the demands of modern scientific 
vocational education. He lacks a proper viewpoint in 
his work and does not understand the applications of 
scientific agriculture to farm problems. The young 
graduate who knows only technical agriculture is
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE TEACHER OF AGRICULTURE 163 
likely to present his subject in an unpedagogical way 
often “ above the heads ” of his students. If we are 
to have competent agricultural teachers, they must be 
properly prepared for this work. They must be thor- 
ough scientists, technically trained agriculturists, lib- 
erally educated men, practical farmers, and profession- 
ally trained teachers. To be specific, the prospective 
teacher of agriculture should first have a thorough 
foundational training in the elementary principles of 
science. To this he should add a detailed technical 
study of as many phases of agriculture as possible, 
together with a certain amount of farm practice. His 
course should include rural sociology, agricultural eco- 
nomics, public speaking, and other work to liberalize 
his general training. His professional training should 
include studies of the history of education; of the prin- 
ciples of education; of educational psychology; of school 
management; of the principles and methods of teach- 
ing agriculture; and practice teaching in elementary 
and secondary agriculture. It is especially important 
that the teacher of agriculture be liberally educated 
and a man of affairs, for it is usually expected that he 
not only give instruction to his pupils in school, but 
that his influence and activities extend outside of the 
school to the rural life of the community. 
The three inseparables in the case of a good teacher 
are: (1) strong personality, (2) high standards of quali- 
fication, and (3) a respectable salary. The point of 
attack in the preparation for teaching is, perhaps, at 
   
-P-A-G-E-174
  164 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
number two. It is more easy to improve one’s quali- 
fication technically and professionally, where that is 
weak, than it is to improve the personality. The per- 
sonality of the teacher is a very difficult thing to de- 
fine, yet we know it when we see it. The agricultural 
teacher must have desirable personal qualities. He 
should be physically sound; his character should 
“ring true”? to the highest moral standards; he 
should have a strong, sympathetic nature, free from 
sarcasm; he should have a keen imagination, and a 
well-developed sense of humor; he should be intelli- 
gently interested in affairs, and able to meet people 
pleasantly in the working relations of the commun- 
ity; and he should have enthusiasm which inspires, a 
dominant optimism for his work, and an innate love 
for country life. 
If there is no prospect that these elements of per- 
sonality, where they are abnormally weak, can be 
improved by a college education, then there is little 
hope for success as an agricultural teacher. An agri- 
cultural college education is worth to the prospective 
teacher all that it costs, but it is no guarantee of suc- 
cess as a teacher, unless he has the desirable elements 
of personality and loves the work. When the strong 
personality and the high standards of training are at- 
tained, then the respectable salary is sure. For voca- 
tional work especially the best teachers are needed, 
and when the best teachers are available good salaries 
will inevitably be paid.
-P-A-G-E-175
THE TEACHER OF AGRICULTURE 165 
Former President Vincent, of Minnesota, says that 
the real test of a teacher beyond the point of techni- 
cal preparation is the test of imagination. How able 
is the teacher to see agriculture in its ideal relation- 
ship? The enduring enthusiasm, the driving power of 
pursuit, the real success, come to teachers who have 
imagination. The teacher of agriculture who has the 
scientific imagination has a tremendous advantage. 
He is able to see agriculture in its larger and essential 
aspects and to take a delight in it. Too many teachers 
of agriculture pin their faith to technique, seeing every 
problem in its immediate aspects and fail to see it in 
its larger relationships. Agriculture under the inspira- 
tion of one who has imagination can be made as gener- 
ally a cultural subject as almost any subject one can 
find. It all depends upon the teacher and the attitude. 
The teacher of agriculture who has this large imagina- 
tive point of view refuses to be segregated; he enters 
into the work of the school in a spirit of thorough 
comradeship. He does not want special treatment as 
though he were a particularly isolated type. He is 
willing to throw in his fortune with the common enter- 
prise. 
In all our technical arrangements, in the adjustments 
of agricultural courses and units, in the detailed lists 
of problems, and the like, the ultimate success of this 
profession, as of every profession, will depend upon 
the degree to which one can develop an imaginative 
background, and an enthusiasm, based on enduring  
-P-A-G-E-176
eo ee 166 THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE 
faith that grows out of the imagination, that sees the 
problem in its widest scientific, social, and national 
aspects. The teacher of agriculture with such imagi- 
nation, with a job that he likes and for which he is 
fitted, keen, loyal, and enthusiastic, has a work full 
of dignity and rich in service.

II. SUGGESTED COURSE IN NATURE-STUDY 
First Six Grades 
FIRST GRADE 
In the first years of the school there is sure to be much 
unorganized nature-study. The purpose should be to give 
general acquaintance with and arouse interest in the com- 
mon things and processes of nature. Children of the primary 
grades naturally bring tonature-study the question, “ What?” 
In these grades the answer should be given. Birds, trees, 
insects, flowers, pets, etc., should be the general topics. 
Select the nearest and most interesting at hand. A detail 
study should not be attempted here. It is better to refer 
briefly to a topic at different seasons than to try to “finish” 
in a stated time. 
Autumn months 
1. Discussion of summer experiences and out-of-door ac- 
tivities. 
2, Animal pets about the house. Animals that work for 
us. Where kept? How cared for? 
8. Identify a few common insects. The simple life-history 
story is most interesting to children. 
4, Only a few trees need be taught. No priztciples of for- 
estry or study of anatomy should be given. Learn to 
recognize and know by name ten or a dozen common 
trees. The nut-bearing trees should be studied first. 
Observe the bark, leaves, and general form of the trees. 
Autumnal coloration will furnish interesting lessons. 
Observe Arbor Day: transplant small trees. Learn to 
recognize the fruit trees, note the coloration of the fruit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
180 
  APPENDIX 
Lessons on evergreen may be given; how they differ 
from other common trees. The Christmas Tree; pur- 
pose, decorations, ete. 
. Informal field studies; note seed dispersal in dandelion, 
thistle, and milkweed; learn names of a few common 
birds and wild flowers. Note how trees and insects 
are preparing for winter. 
. Nature-study myths and stories may be used by a ju- 
dicious teacher. (See Bingham’s Little Folks Land.) 
Winter months 
. Some physical nature-study may be given here. Study 
the compass and how to use it. Teach the general marks 
and meanings of the thermometer. The observation of 
clouds to distinguish rain clouds from the others may 
be made. 
. Make a weather calendar for each month, serving to 
teach days of week, name of months, seasons, birthdays, 
holidays, ete. The relation of snow, rain, etc., to tem- 
perature. The relation of sun, moon, etc., to directions. 
(Many adults are weak on these points. We have lost 
the woodman’s art of observation, and proper early 
training in nature-study may help to regain it.) 
. Plant nasturtiums and other plants in window boxes. 
Care of potted plants indoors. 
. How plants and animals are cared for in winter. How 
to care for birds and pets. 
. Simple lessons in hygiene may be put on an observa- 
tional basis and be made good nature-study. Breathing 
and ventilation; lessons in thorough mastication; care 
of teeth; table manners, etc. 
. Note signs of coming spring, lengthening of days, 
weather, early bird arrivals, pussy-willow, hibernating 
animals, etc.
-P-A-G-E-191
  APPENDIX 181 
Spring months _ . Continue weather charts and observations. 
. Report on spring activities at home. 
8. Begin in a simple way a bird calendar. 
Tn the study of birds, get acquainted with their com- 
mon names, learn to recognize by song and sight ten or 
a dozen common birds. Learn something of their habits 
and habitat. Put out food, water, and nesting material. 
Keep cats from the birds. 
4. Note the opening of the flower and leaf buds in the 
trees. Review the names of trees learned last autumn, 
and recognize them again. Observe Arbor Day and 
Bird Day, plant trees, and provide nests for birds. 
Songs and poems about birds and trees. 
5. Learn to know a few spring flowers. In the study of 
flowers, learn only the common ones; avoid formal 
dissection of blossoms. Learn where they grow. Bring 
in wild plants, such as claytonia, violets, cranesbill, 
anemones, dandelion, etc., for transplanting in pots, 
or on the school grounds. A wild-flower chart may 
be made by the teacher, with names and dates of 
blooming. 
6. The school garden. Children of this grade may plant 
a small school garden working as a group. Let each 
child have a share if possible. Flowers are more suit- 
able to this grade, perhaps than vegetables. Plant sun- 
flower seeds, and nasturtiums borders. Popcorn, rad- 
ishes, and beans may be planted. ©

  APPENDIX 183 
SECOND GRADE 
The second-grade work in nature-study should continue 
as in the first grade with no sharp demarcation, giving general 
acquaintance with and interest in common natural and phy- 
sical objects. A few more details may be added and the 
same ground gone over a second time with profit. Unless the 
first and second grades are in separate rooms, it is best to 
give the same work to the combined grades in one class. If 
the second year can have a separate course and another year 
for the work, there could be no objection to the consideration 
of the same general topics as given in the first year, but it 
would be advisable to use new materials to illustrate the same 
principles. 
Autumn months 
1. Discussion of summer experiences and out-of-door 
activities. 
2. Continue the interest in animal pets. Emphasize how 
the animal makes its living and how we can help it. 
8. Learn to identify a few more common insects. How the 
insect makes its living. How insects help the flowers. 
How the insect escapes its enemies. How insects af- 
fect our lives. Some observations of the honey bee 
and its work. 
4, Pupils of the second grade should learn to recognize 
eighteen or twenty different species of trees by their 
common names. Observe Arbor Day, plant trees and 
follow tree studies as suggested for grade one. Study 
fruits and nuts of trees. Identify a few varieties of 
apples and nuts. How nuts and fruits are stored for 
winter. 
5. Bulbs may be planted by second-grade pupils, in pots, 
window boxes or in the school yard. 
6. Some of the common weeds should be gathered and 
identified.
-P-A-G-E-194
  APPENDIX 
Winter months 
. Continue physical nature-study as suggested for first 
grade. Study weather signs and evidences of approach- 
ing winter. Make a weather chart, as described for 
first grade. 
. Some simple observational studies of the common do. 
mestic animals are advised here, — the horse, cow, etc. 
Note the food, habits, care, etc. No opportunity should 
be lost to give the humane phase proper emphasis. 
. Continue simple lessons in hygiene, as related to good 
habits in breathing and eating. 
. Make some observational studies of winter birds if pos- 
sible. Place suet or bones on trees for the birds’ food. 
Study the English sparrow, its habits and disposition. 
. Note signs of approaching spring, and make nature- 
study lessons from them where practical. 
Spring months 
. Second-grade pupils may learn the common names of 
about twenty-four common wild flowering plants. It is 
worth while to know the common names of things as a 
part of general human interest. 
. Create an interest in the mother hen and her chickens. 
Continue bird studies as suggested in grade one. 
. The garden work of the second grade may take a prac- 
tical turn. The common vegetables are advised as well 
as flowers for this grade. Have a class garden on the 
school ground if possible, and let each pupil or group of 
pupils be responsible for certain plants. The “garden 
habit” is a very good one to form early in life. The 
‘school garden will furnish an excellent opportunity for 
many interesting lessons in nature-study. 
. Review tree studies and make sure of the names of those 
learned last fall.
-P-A-G-E-195
APPENDIX 185 
5. Make field trips whenever possible and study brook- 
life, pond-life, birds, trees, insects and flowers wherever 
the occasion affords. Have all excursions well planned 
and organized and keep the attention of the children 
constantly to the natural things and processes about 
them. 
Sample Lesson Plans 
I. Title: Leaves of Common Trees. 
Season: Autumn or spring. 
Object: To review the names of ten or twelve common 
trees from the leaves and what the leaves are 
for. 
Material: Each child with ten or twelve leaves. 
Subject-matter and method: — 
Plan beforehand to have each child bring in ten or 
twelve leaves from trees, or better still, go with the 
children to gather the leaves. Have them write the 
names of the leaves on slips of paper and pin to 
the leaves. Let each child stand and name his 
leaves as he points them out. After becoming fa- 
miiliar with the leaves ask what the leaf does. Per- 
haps the teacher will have to tell that the leaf gets 
part of the tree’s food for it out of the sunshine 
and air. 
How do the leaves help the children? 
What becomes of them? To play in during the autumn. 
Are they good to eat? etc. 
Read some leaf poem or legend to the children. 
II. Title: The Rain. 
Time: A rainy day in spring. 
Object: to teach value and appreciation of the rain.

THIRD GRADE 
Since the third grades of the public schools usually take up 
oral or home geography and since it should be placed on an 
observational basis and deal largely with the common things 
and processes of nature, the nature-study work of this grade 
and the home geography should be combined as one course. 
The general topics usually outlined for home geography will 
make good nature-study material and the work outlined for 
the preceding grades will give good preparation for this 
phase of the study. The natural questions of the intermedi- 
ate grade children in the presence of nature are, “What?” 
and “How?” The work in these grades should answer these 
questions. .

post-office, telephone, roads. Foodstuffs bought and 
sold in the community. Pupils may begin to realize
-P-A-G-E-197
  APPENDIX 187 
the relation of the farmer as a producer to the city 
dweller as a consumer. 
. The study of fruits, grains, and other farm products 
used as foods. The harvesting, preserving, and storing 
of food supplies in autumn. 
Winter months 
. The materials used in building our homes furnish a 
basis for observational work on trees, lumber, stone, 
brick, sand, clay, etc. Observe the effects of weathering 
on these materials. Have pupils report on home obser- 
vations of these materials. Different workmen engaged 
in building our houses. 
. Water. Various forms of water. How we get water in 
country and city. How plants get water. Why water 
is sometimes muddy. Effects of water on soil in 
washing, etc. How lands are drained, naturally and 
artificially. 
. Observation of soils. Grow plants in pots of rich soil 
and poor soil. Kinds of soil in the community. Weather 
effects on soils. 
. Simple hygiene of the home and its surroundings. 
Methods of heating, lighting, and ventilating. Sanitary 
conditions. These may be put on an observational basis 
and be good nature-study. 
Spring months 
. School garden work is well adapted to this grade. Each 
pupil should have his own plot of ground for a garden. 
Relate the garden work to home life. Pupils should 
note the home markets for local and foreign supplies, 
and learn where the products go and come from on the 
markets. Note time required for germination of seeds. 
Identify weeds and combat them as they appear in the 
garden.

. Flowers and trees in relation to the home. Beautifying 
the home grounds is often a topic in home geography, 
and hence here in the nature-study is offered an op- 
portunity to study flowers, trees, wild plants, bulbs, 
flower-gardens, etc., in connection with the beautifying 
of home and school grounds. 
. Review the pupils’ acquaintance with the common trees, 
wild flowers, birds, insects and grains and grasses of 
the community. 
All these topics of the third year should be unified and 
organized about the home life and interests of the com- 
munity.

Why they go. Why they come back. Tell them of 
the long dangerous flight, and of the welcome and 
help they deserve. ' 
Read Longfellow’s “Birds of Killingworth.” 
FOURTH GRADE 
The fourth-grade work in nature-study should be corre- 
lated closely with the primary geography used in this grade; 
in fact the courses might easily be run together. The indus- 
trial phase of the geography work as well as the study of the 
natural objects and phenomena of the earth about the pupils 
furnish excellent nature-study material. 
Autumn months 
1. Supplementary to and alternating with the textbook 
work in the primary geography, the nature-study may 
take up the farm products of the community, making  
-P-A-G-E-200

observations and reports as follows upon corn, wheat, 
clover, potatoes, tomatoes, etc. 
(a) Observations and classroom talks about the whole 
plant, root, stems, leaves and fruit. 
(6) Where and to what extent these crops are grown 
in the community.

-P-A-G-E-201
  APPENDIX 191 
‘the rain water from ocean to ocean, noting the various 
changes it undergoes and the effects it produces on 
climate, soils, water-supply, etc. 
. As the various industries, such as fishing, lumbering, 
mining, manufacturing, farming, etc., are taken up in 
the primary geography, supplement the work freely 
with nature-study lessons on the materials used in 
these industries. 
(a) In lumbering, review names of trees and note by 
observations the nature of some of the various 
woods used. 
(b) In manufacturing, note as much of the raw ma- 
terial used as possible, the fibers used in rope-

gested for grade three. Encourage the growing of 
home gardens for the production of vegetables for the 
market. 
. Have review lessons in the identification of trees, birds, 
insects, and wild flowers as the coming of spring calls 
attention to them. 
. Continue the correlation of the industries with natural 
objects, as suggested for the winter months, especially

(Similar studies may be made of all common 
trees.) 
FIFTH GRADE 
(May be alternated with sixth-grade work and both grades com- 
bined each year.) 
Since statistics show that large numbers of the school pop- 
ulation drop out about the fifth and sixth grades, it becomes 
very important that the nature-study work of these grades 
should give to the future citizens correct and helpful informa- 
tion along biological and physical lines, enabling them to ad- 
just themselves more sympathetically and intelligently to 
their environments. It would seem best therefore to have 
some rather intensive work along the larger and more impor- 
tant groups of nature material affecting human interests. 
Economic considerations appeal to the children, but these 
should not be over-emphasized. Children should keep good 
notebooks, prepare pictures, charts, calendars, etc. It should 
not be the aim in these grades to attempt technical informa- 
tion or to develop the scientific spirit, but to arouse a perma- 
nent and intelligent interest in the common things and proc- 
esses of nature, so that the boy or girl may become a citizen, 
able and willing to do effective economic work for his com- 
munity. In addition to the questions, “What?” and “How?” 
pupils of these grades begin to ask “Why?” in the presence 
of nature phenomena. At least two half-hour periods a week 
should be given to this work. 
Autumn months: trees and insects 
1. Insect studies, — the interesting common species re- 
lated to, human life.

from observation, the number of legs, segments 
of the body, eyes, feelers, wings, etc. Note the 
chewing mouth parts. Examine these parts with 
a hand-lens. Make drawing of the grasshopper. 
This study should give some idea of the nature of 
insect bodies. 
(6) Make similar study of the squash bug. Note es- 
pecially the sucking mouth parts. Teach that 
insects injure plants by chewing or sucking. Ex- 
plain methods of combating each kind. Show

ing; Government forest reserves and the United 
States Forest Service; the foresters’ life; lumber- 
ing; uses of wood; collection of samples. 
(e) The farmer’s woodlot. Some points in the care 
of woodlot, such as preventing fire, cleaning out 
dead and decaying trees, and keeping brows- 
ing cattle out. Planting of catalpa, locust, and 
osage for posts and farm wood supplies. A plot 
in the school garden should be planted to catalpa 
seedlings. 
(f) Some attention to fruit trees; how they differ 
from forest trees in habits of growth and in cul- 
tivation and care given them. 
Winter months 
1. Census of the domestic animals of the neighborhood. 
The market values of each kind of farm animal. Use 
for reference Davenport’s Twelve Studies of Farm Ani- 
mals. Make observational comparisons between draft 
horses and driving horses; between beef cattle and 
dairy cattle; between pure-bred stock and “‘scrubs.”

APPENDIX 197 
practice in the preparation of ground, planting the 
seed, cultivating the vegetables, combating the pests, 
harvesting and disposing of the products. Records 
of expenses and receipts in simple businesslike forms 
should be kept. The garden should be an individual 
possession of each student, either at school or at 
home, preferably the latter, and it should include 
the standard vegetable crops. Attention should be 
given in a practical way to the planting of flowers, 
shrubs, and trees in the beautifying of home and school 
grounds,

AGRICULTURE 
Seventh and Eighth Grades 
THE TEXTBOOK METHOD 
SEVENTH GRADE 
Tue seventh and eighth grades should be combined, and 
the work here outlined for these grades given in alternate 
years. The elements of vocational agriculture follow logi- 
cally a course in nature-study such as outlined for the first six 
grades. The subject-matter given in various textbooks as 
outlined below should follow the seasonal sequence wherever 
possible and be used as a basis for classroom recitations and 
demonstrations. For the practical work pupils should do the 
real things of the farm, including the chores and such work 
in crop and animal production as they are able to do.

Norns 
Tn connection with the work in Agriculture in the seventh 
and eighth grades, it is recommended that special notebooks 
be made, illustrated and kept by each student, on each of the 
larger topics studied. Notebooks on corn, wheat, insects, 
orchard, weeds, garden, swine, cattle, sheep, horses, poultry, 
etc., may easily and profitably be made to correlate with 
work in English and drawing. These notebooks may be in 
the form of booklets, with neat cover design, illustrated by 
crayons or water colors. Industrial Booklets, published by 
Webb Company, St. Paul, Minnesota, are excellent helps 
in this connection. 
Practica, Homz Work 
There is little time for laboratory or field work at school 
in connection with agriculture in the seventh and eighth 
grades, especially in the one-room country schools. But a 
method referred to in Chapter III is entirely feasible, and 
more detailed suggestions are here submitted. 
From the following list of farm operations which a boy 
of these grades can do, the teacher may select any two per 
week, related as nearly as possible to the subject-matter 
being studied at school, and assign these home duties to the 
pupil. The parents may sign a form blank each week vouch- 
ing for the work done by the pupil. From five to ten hours 
per week should be required.

Outline of the Plan Suggested on Page 204 for 
Seventh- and Eighth-Grade Agriculture 
THE HOME-PROJECT PLAN 
Basing the work of these grades on the home project, the 
class should decide upon one or possibly two projects and 
each member of the class should do the work outlined in a 
calendar similar to the one given below. Class recitations and 
laboratory exercises should be based upon the practical work 
done at home. Under this plan very little of the time of the 
regular school hours need be given to formal classwork, but 
the school becomes the guide and inspiration for the home 
work. During the seventh and eighth years several projects 
may be completed without any. duplication of study or work, 
and it may be better for the student to complete a thorough 
study and practice of a few agricultural projects than to skim 
over the general field of agriculture by the textbook method 
of school work. In connection with the project plan, no better 
book for general study could be used than Davenport’s 
Introduction to Agriculture.t 
The following project outline is taken from the Row, 
Peterson Home Project Series ? and illustrates the method of 
using the home project as a basis for elementary agriculture.

APPENDIX 
  CORN PROJECT CALENDAR 
September 
1. Organization of club. The class in agriculture, under- 
taking to base its year’s work upon the home project, should 
be organized as directed by the club plan. Each member of 
the class should become a member of the club and plan to do 
all the work outlined for the project. ‘The plan should meet 
the approval of the board of education and of the parents of 
the boys and girls undertaking the project and have the 
hearty support of the county superintendent of schools and 
of the teacher. The State Club Leader at the State College 
of Agriculture should be notified of the organization of the 
club so that he can send enrollment blanks and all such liter- 
ature and publications as will be helpful in the progress of the 
work. 
2. Selecting the plot. For the corn growing project we may 
well begin operations in September for the next season’s crop. 
The first thing each pupil should do after the organization 
of the class is to select the plot upon which he is to grow his 
corn. Not less than an acre should be used for this project. 
The father should allow the boy an acre of good well- 
drained, fertile land upon which to grow his corn. 
3. The notebook. Each pupil should be provided with a 
good permanent notebook in which he may keep a neat and 
accurate record of all operations, results, and accounts, 
month by month, so that at the end he will have an agricul- 
tural booklet he will be proud to exhibit. It would be well 
to have all these notebooks uniform in style and size. Upon 
the durable cover may be pasted some such words as, “Ag- 
ricultural Booklet”; ‘Corn is King”; some good pictures - 
clipped from papers; or even the photograph and name of 
the boy.

horse labor. Record cost of material used. When the 
diary activity brings in a return, record it under re- 
ceipts to be summarized later. When the diary of the

  4. Mapping the plot. Make a map, drawing to scale, of 
your proposed acre of corn ground. Copy this neatly 
in yournotebook. Write answers to the following points. 
(a) Location of the plot. 
(6) Type of soil, sandy, clay, loam, upland, lowland, 
etc. 
(c) Cropping and treatment of the plot for the last 
three years. ‘ 
(d) Present condition as to plant growth and fer- 
tility. 
(e) Drainage. 
(f) Estimated value of the acre of land. 
§. Field selection of seed. Attention may well be given this 
early in the project to the selection of the seed corn for 
next spring. Send to the various seed corn breeders of 
your State for their circulars; also to the International 
Harvester Company and to the State College of Agri- 
culture for bulletins on seed corn. 
Go into the field and study good types of stalks and 
ears from which seed corn should be selected. (Labora- 
tory exercises on this point may precede this trip.) 
Become thoroughly familiar with the ideal stalk and 
ear which should be selected when the time for husking 
the seed corn comes.
-P-A-G-E-227
  
  APPENDIX 217 
October 
1. Storing seed corn. Devices for storing seed corn should 
be planned and made this month. Each pupil should 
make definite provision for storing his seed corn in some 
of the various types of racks or devices used. 
2. Selecting and storing seed. Before freezing weather or 
severe frosts, the seed corn to be used in this project 
should be selected in the field and brought in for drying 
and storing. The only satisfactory way of selecting 
seed corn is in the field where one can take into account 
the whole plant. The ear should be taken from a leafy 
stalk that is well developed, standing at proper dis- 
tance from other stalks and grown under normal con- 
ditions. The ear should be supported about midway 
up the stalk on a short shank inclined slightly down- 
ward. Desirable ear characteristics are given in stand- 
ard score cards. Since the pupil is to select for only a 
small planting area, great care should be taken to select 
and store the best seed corn possible. Determine the 
number of ears required to plant an acre of corn. Select 
several times this number for storing. Dry cellars, 
basements or attics, if free from mice and rats, may be 
used for storing corn. The old practice of hanging seed 
corn from rafters is a good one to use until the corn is 
finally stored for the winter. Corn contains considerable 
moisture, the germ is a living thing, and the vitality 
of the corn may be seriously injured if it is allowed to 
freeze. Record in diary: (1) Amount of seed selected; 
(2) where obtained; (3) variety of corn; (4) how stored. 
8. Soil treatment. Attention should be given this fall to the 
proper treatment of the soil of the plot to be planted. 
Ifa clover crop has been growing to be ploughed un- 
der, well and good. In any case, an application of five or 
six tons of barnyard manure should be applied to the 
acre. Most soils are deficient in phosphorus, and there
-P-A-G-E-228
APPENDIX 
  would likely be beneficial results from applying about 
two tons per acre of finely ground raw rock phosphate. 
The whole — crops residue, clover, manure, and rock 
phosphate — should be ploughed down this fall to de- 
compose and become available for plant food for the 
corn crop of next season. 
_ We must be sure that the soil is not sour. Get some 
blue litmus paper at the drug store. Make up a moist 
ball of the soil and insert the litmus paper. If after 
five or ten minutes the litmus paper turns pink or red 
we have evidence that the soil is acid. Now limestone 
corrects acidity, and if the soil of the proposed plot 
is acid from two to three tons of ground limestone 
should be applied to the land after the fall ploughing. 
The pupil should keep a record in his notebook of all 
that is done by way of soil treatment on his plot: — 
. What crop residue is present? 
. How much manure applied? When? 
- How much phosphorus applied? When? 
. When the plot was ploughed:—Depth. Was the 
ground disked? 
. How did you test for acidity? Was your soil sour? 
. How much limestone applied? When? 
. Record hours of horse and man labor necessary.

2 IAN 
November 
1. Unfinished work. Any of the unfinished work of select- 
ing and storing seed corn or of the preparation of the 
ground as described for October may be finished in 
November. The seed corn should be stored in the racks 
prepared, out of reach of rats and mice, in a dry room 
where dampness or freezing will not occur. 
2. Practice in judging corn. Full directions for scoring 
and judging corn are given by State colleges and text- 
books adapted to local needs. 
8. Preparation of club exhibits. Details for corn exhibits 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  APPENDIX 219 
are given in various State publications. The class 
should arrange a corn exhibit in the schoolroom, even 
though the corn for this first year of the project was 
not grown by the pupils. For the second year of the 
project pupils should exhibit their own corn. 
December and January 
. School-room studies. No practical work directly relating 
to the project is necessary these months. Class recita- 
tion work based on a study of the market prices and 
causes of variation; systems of permanent soil fertility; 
crop rotation; and the place of corn in systems of grain 
and live-stock farming. Consult daily market quota- 
tions and record prices of’ corn in a table prepared in 
the notebook. 
Class recitations and study on the subject-matter re- 
lating to this project. Consult farm papers, bulletins, 
and reference texts for class reports on corn-growing 
and related problems, such as soil, weeds, insects, feed- 
ing values, and uses of corn. 
. Laboratory exercises relating to the above studies. 
February 
. The plot work again. We may now begin to turn our 
attention more specifically to the plot and the next 
steps in the production of the acre of corn which has 
been planned since last September. 
. The signboard. One of the things each member of the 
class or club should do is to make and letter a signboard 
to be placed at the plot upon which the project is to 
be done. This should be 12x8 inches planed on one 
side. The signboard should bear the name of the local 
or county club preceded by the word “Member ”; 
as, —
-P-A-G-E-230
APPENDIX 
Member 
Lincoln County 
Corn Club 
  The lettering may be done by means of a stencil cut 
from cardboard. The letters may be cut from adver- 
tisements or made by some member of the class. They 
are then laid on the cardboard, their outline drawn 
with a pencil, and the letters cut out. 
. Testing and grading seed corn. A rectangular box seed 
corn tester and as many other kinds of testers as pos- 
sibly can be secured should be available for this work. 
Send to your State College of Agriculture for circulars 
of instruction on making the seed corn test. Test for 
germination at least fifty high-scoring ears of corn 
selected and stored last fall in order to discover the 
twelve or fifteen having the most vigorous vitality to 
be used for planting your acre. Record the results of 
your testing in the notebook: (1) When tested; (2) how 
tested; (3) per cent of good germination. 
March and April 
. Preparation of seed bed. If the ground has not been 
ploughed last fall, the first preparation in the spring 
would be the breaking of the ground. Disking and 
deep ploughing would be in order. If the ground has 
been broken last fall, the plot should be disked and 
thoroughly harrowed in the spring. A firm, deeply 
ploughed, sub-surface with a well-pulverized surface 
soil is the ideal seed-bed preparation. Record all 
operations in the notebook records. 
(1) Was ground ploughed in the fall or spring? Why? 
(2) How was your seed bed prepared? 
(3) Record hours of man and horse labor used.

1. Corn-planting. Corn may be planted from the first to 
the middle of May or even later. From one and one 
half to three inches is the depth to plant corn, depend- 
ing on the character of the soil. 
Tf the acre used in this project is a part of a larger 
field, the corn may be planted by the planter along with 
the rest of the field. If the acre is apart from other 
plantings the seed may be drilled or even dropped by 
hand. 
2. Record in the notebook diary as follows: — 
(a) When planted. 
(6) Method used. 
(c) Distance apart of rows and corn in rows. 
(d) Amount of seed used. 
(e) Record hours of man and horse labor used. 
8. Planters. Study various corn-planters and drills. Write 
a paragraph in your notebook on the advantages and 
disadvantages of each method of planting. 
June and July 
1. Cultivation. Weeds are kept out and the shallow soil 
mulch maintained in proper cultivation. Early rolling 
and harrowing before or soon after the corn comes up
-P-A-G-E-232
  222 
  APPENDIX 
is a good practice facilitating the early control of the 
weeds. 
The soil should be cultivated as often as is necessary 
to maintain a loose, shallow soil mulch, and keep down 
the weeds. Never allow the surface to become baked 
and hard. It should be cultivated as soon after a rain 
as it is dry enough to work. Care should be taken not to 
cultivate too deep. If the roots of corn are injured, the 
yield is reduced. 
. Record in the notebook diary as follows: — 
(a) Was your stand good, medium or poor? 
(6) What and when was your first cultivation? 
(c) Was cultivation deep or shallow? 
(d) What implement was used? 
(e) How many times did you cultivate? 
(f) Record hours of man and horse labor used. 
. Insects. Observe and note the insect injuring the corn. 
(a) Name of insect. 
(6) Nature of the injury. 
. Weeds. List the weeds that were troublesome. 
. Other damages. Was your corn damaged by any other 
causes? 
. Read and study bulletins, books, and farm papers re- 
lating to corn production. 
July and August 
- Cultivation. Continue cultivation to keep down weeds 
and maintain the soil mulch. 
. Field trips. If the teacher or club leader is helping, 
during the summer frequent trips to the plot should be 
made by the pupil and leader to observe and discuss — 
(a) Pollination and fertilization. 
(6) Insect and fungous injury. 
(c) Corn stand. 
(d) Probable causes of success or failure in good corn 
growth. 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  APPENDIX 223 
Diary records of these observations should be made. 
The teacher or club leader should assist the pupil in 
completing in a full, neat, and satisfactory way all the 
records and accounts connected with this project. 
. Picnics. A club picnic should be the closing feature of 
the year’s work. 
. Concluding work. The concluding work of the Booklet 
should be the pupil’s story of “How I Grew My Acre 
of Corn.”

Mucus of the laboratory equipment needed for a study of 
biology, chemistry, and physics is suitable for work in agri- 
culture. It is supposed that those schools which offer agri- 
culture will be fairly well supplied with such apparatus as 
suitable laboratory desks, tables, compound microscope, 
hand lenses, etc.; hence, only that material somewhat pecu- 
liar to the study of agriculture will be mentioned here.

V. THE SMITH-HUGHES BILL AND VOCA- 
TIONAL AGRICULTURE IN SECONDARY 
SCHOOLS 
Tue Smith-Hughes Bill, providing Federal grants to the 
respective States of the Union for the promotion of vocational 
education, was passed by the Sixty-fourth Congress, signed 
by President Wilson on February 23, 1917, and became 
operative as a law on July 1, 1917. 
There is through this measure projected a great Nation- 
al system of vocational education, extending downward 
through the secondary schools, with Federal support similar 
to that given to the Land-Grant Colleges by the Morrill 
Act, signed by Abraham Lincoln, in 1862. 
EXTRACTS FROM THE SMITH-HUGHES LAW, REL- 
ATIVE TO THE TRAINING OF AGRICULTURAL 
WORKERS 
An Act to provide for the promotion of vocational edu- 
cation; to provide for codperation with the States in the pro- 
motion of such education in agriculture; . . . to provide for 
codperation with the States in the preparation of teachers 
of vocational subjects; and to appropriate money and regu- 
late its expenditure. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
That there is hereby annually appropriated, out of any 
money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the sums 
provided in Sections 2 and 4 of this Act, to be paid to the 
respective States for the purpose of codperating with the 
States in paying the salaries of teachers, supervisors, and 
directors of agricultural subjects . . . and in the preparation 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  APPENDIX 229 
of teachers of agricultural subjects. ... Sums shall be ex- 
pended as hereinafter provided. 
Sec. 2. That for the purpose of codperating with the 
States in paying the salaries of teachers, supervisors, or 
directors of agricultural subjects there is hereby appropri- 
ated for the use of the States, subject to the provisions of this 
Act, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1918, the sum of 
$500,000; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919, the sum 
of $750,000; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1920, the sum 
of $1,000,000; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1921, the 
sum of $1,250,000; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1922, 
the sum of $1,500,000; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1923, the sum of $1,750,000; for the fiscal year ending June 
30, 1924, the sum of $2,000,000; for the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1925, the sum of $2,500,000; for the fiscal year 
ending June ‘30, 1926, and annually thereafter the sum 
of $3,000,000. Said sums shall be allotted to the States in 
the proportion which their rural population bears to the 
total rural population of the United States; not including 
outlying possessions, according to the last preceding United 
States census. 
Sec. 4. That for the purpose of codperating with the 
States in preparing teachers, supervisors, and directors of 
agricultural subjects and teachers of trade and industrial 
and home economics subjects there is hereby appropriated 
for the use of the States for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1918, the sum of $500,000; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1919, the sum of $700,000; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1920, the sum of $900,000; for the fiscal year ending June 
30, 1921, and annually thereafter, the sum of $1,000,000. 
Said sums shall be allotted to the States in the proportion 
which their population bears to the total population of the 
United States, not including outlying possessions, according 
to the last preceding United States census. 
Sec. 5. That in order to secure the benefits of the ap-
-P-A-G-E-240
  280 APPENDIX 
propriations provided for in Sections 2 and 4 of this Act, 
any State shall, through the legislative authority thereof, 
accept the provisions of this Act and designate or create a 
State board, consisting of not less than three members, and 
having all necessary power to codperate, as herein provided, 
with the Federal Board for Vocational Education in the 
administration of the provisions of this Act. The State 
Board of Education, or other board having charge of the ad- 
ministration of public education in the State, or any State 
board having charge of the administration of any kind of - 
vocational education in the State may, if the State so elect, 
be designated as the State board, for the purposes of this 
Act. 
i 
Any State may accept the benefits of any one or more of 
the respective funds herein appropriated, and it may defer 
the acceptance of the benefits of any one or more of such 
funds, and shall be required to meet only the conditions 
relative to the fund or funds the benefits of which it has 
accepted, Provided, that after June 30, 1920, no State shall 
receive any appropriation for salaries of teachers, super- 
visors, or directors of agricultural subjects until it shall have 
taken advantage of at least the minimum amount appropri- 
ated for the training of teachers, supervisors, or directors 
of agricultural subjects, as provided for in this Act. 
Sec. 6. That a Federal Board for Vocational Education 
is hereby created, to consist of the Secretary of Agriculture, 
the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the 
United States Commissioner of Education, and three citi- 
zens of the United States to be appointed by the President, 
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. One of 
said three citizens shall be a representative of the manufac- 
turing and commercial interests, one a representative of the 
agricultural interests, and one a representative of labor. 
The board shall elect annually one of its members as chair-
-P-A-G-E-241
  APPENDIX 231 
man. ‘In the first instance, one of the citizen members shall 
be appointed for one year, one for two years, and one for 
three years, and thereafter for three years each. The mem- 
bers of the board other than the members of the Cabinet 
and the United States Commissioner of Education shall 
receive a salary of $5000 per annum. 
The board shall have power to codperate with State boards 
in carrying out the provisions of this Act. It shall be the 
duty of the Federal Board for Vocational Education to make, 
or cause to have made studies, investigations, and reports, 
with particular reference to their use in aiding the States 
in the establishment of vocational schools and classes and 
in giving instruction in agriculture. . . . Such studies, inves- 
tigations, and reports shall include agriculture and agricul- 
tural processes and requirements upon agricultural workers; 
...and problems of administration of vocational schools and 
of courses of study and instruction in vocational subjects. 
The Federal Board for Vocational Education shall have 
power to employ such assistants as may be necessary to carry 
out the provisions of this Act. 
Sec. 8. That in order to secure the benefits of the ap- 
propriation for any purpose specified in this Act, the State 
board shall prepare plans, showing the kinds of Vocational 
Education for which it is proposed that the appropriation 
shall be used; the kinds of schools and equipment; courses 
of study; methods of instruction; qualifications of teachers; 
and, in the case of agricultural subjects, the qualifications of 
supervisors or directors; plans for the training of teachers, 
and, in the case of agricultural subjects, plans for the super- 
vision of agricultural education, as provided for in Sec- 
tion 10. Such plans shall be submitted by the State board 
to the Federal Board for Vocational Education, and if the 
Federal board finds the same to be in conformity with the pro- 
visions and purposes of this Act, the same shall be approved. 
The State board shall make an annual report to the Federal 
Board for Vocational Education, on or before September
-P-A-G-E-242
232 APPENDIX 
  first of each year, on the work done in the State and the 
receipts and expenditures of money under the provisions of 
this Act. 
Sec. 9. That the appropriation for the salaries of teachers, 
supervisors, or directors of agricultural subjects... shall 
be devoted exclusively to the payment of salaries of such 
teachers, supervisors, or directors having the minimum 
qualifications set up for the State by the State board, with 
the approval of the Federal Board for Vocational Educa- 
tion. The cost of instruction supplementary to the instruc- 
tion in agriculture, provided for in this Act, necessary to 
build a well-rounded course of training, shall be borne by the 
State and local communities, and no part of the cost thereof 
shall be borne out of the appropriations herein made. The 
moneys expended under the provisions of this Act, in 
codperation with the States, for the salaries of teachers, 
supervisors, or directors of agricultural subjects, . . . shall 
be conditioned that for each dollar of Federal money ex- 
pended for such salaries the State or local community, or 
both, shall expend an equal amount for such salaries; and 
that appropriations for the training of teachers of vocational 
subjects, as herein provided, shall be conditioned that such 
money be expended for maintenance of such training and 
that for each dollar of Federal money so expended for 
maintenance, the State or local community, or both, shall 
expend an equal amount for the maintenance of such 
training. 
Sec. 10. That any State may use the appropriation for 
agricultural purposes, or any part thereof allotted to it, 
under the provisions of this Act, for the salaries of teachers, 
supervisors, or directors of agricultural subjects, either for 
the salaries of teachers of such subjects in schools or classes, 
or for the salaries of supervisors or directors of such sub- 
jects under a plan of supervision for the State to be set up by 
the State board, with the approval of the Federal Board for 
Vocational Education. That in order to receive the benefits
-P-A-G-E-243
  APPENDIX 238 
of such appropriation for the salaries of teachers, supervisors, 
or directors of agricultural subjects the State board of any 
State shall provide in its plan for agricultural education that 
such education shall be that which is under public super- 
vision or control; that the controlling purpose of such edu- 
cation shall be to fit for useful employment; that such edu- 
cation shall be of less than college grade and be designed to 
meet the needs of persons over fourteen years of age who 
have entered upon or who are preparing to enter upon the 
work of the farm or of the farm home; that the State or 
local community, or both, (1) shall provide the necessary 
plant and equipment determined upon by the State board, 
with the approval of the Federal Board for Vocational Edu- 
cation, as the minimum requirement for such education 
in schools and classes in the State; (2) that the amount 
expended for the maintenance of such education in any 
school or class receiving the benefit of such appropriation 
shall be not less annually than the amount fixed by the State 
board, with the approval of the Federal board as the mini- 
mum for such schools or classes in the State; (3) that such 
schools shall provide for directed or supervised practice in 
agriculture, either on a farm provided for by the school or 
other farm, for at least six months per year; (4) that the 
teachers, supervisors, or directors of agricultural subjects 
shall have at least the minimum qualifications determined 
for the State by the State board, with the approval of the 
Federal Board for Vocational Education.

fits of the appropriation in this Act for the training of 
teachers, supervisors, or directors of agricultural subjects, 
. .. the State board of such State shall provide in its plan 
for such. training that the same shall be carried out under 
the supervision of the State board; that such training shall 
be given in schools or classes under public supervision or con- 
trol; that such training shall be given only to persons who 
have had adequate vocational experience or contact in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  234 APPENDIX 
line of work for which they are preparing themselves as 
teachers, supervisors, or directors, or who are acquiring such 
experience or contact as a part of their training; and that the 
State board, with the approval of the Federal board, shall 
establish minimum requirements for such experience or 
contact for teachers, supervisors, or directors of agricul- 
tural subjects, and for teachers of trade, industrial and home 
economics subjects; that not more than sixty per centum nor 
less than twenty per centum of the money appropriated under 
this Act for the training of teachers of vocational subjects 
to any State for any year shall be expended for any one of 
the following purposes: For the preparation of teachers, 
supervisors, or directors of agricultural subjects or the pre- 
paration of teachers of trade and industrial subjects, or the

appropriations its State Treasurer, who shall receive and 
provide for the proper custody and disbursements of all 
money paid to the State from said appropriations. 
Sec. 16. That the Federal Board for Vocational Education 
may withhold the allotment of moneys to any State when- 
ever it shall be determined that such moneys are not being 
expended for the purposes and under the conditions of this 
Act. 
Sec. 17. That . . . no portion of any moneys appropriated 
under this Act for the benefit of the States shall be applied, 
directly or indirectly, to the purchase, erection, preserva- 
tion, or repair of any building or buildings or equipment, or 
for the purchase or rental of lands, or for the support of any 
religious or privately owned or conducted school or college. 
. Approved, February 23, 1917.

APPENDIX 235 
Some of the outstanding benefits of the Smith-Hughes 
Vocational Fund will be: — '' 
(1) The supervision of agricultural, industrial, and home 
economics teaching in secondary schools. 
(2) The training of teachers for these vocational subjects. 
(3) The opportunity given to help boysand girls into bread- 
winning vocations, as well as to a liberal education. 
Coming as this Federal aid does at the time of the great 
world war, it should assist very materially in training agri- 
culturists and mechanics to support the men on the firing 
line. It should aid also to no small extent in providing help- 
ful vocational training to those who return, maimed in many 
ways from war and battle, to take up the task, under great 
handicap, of earning a livelihood for themselves and their 
families. 
This movement is a great new advance in-education. The 
resources of all the Nation are pooled for this large enterprise. 
Great tasks and responsibilities are being placed on Federal, 
State, and local boards and directors in the organization of 
the work, and in the establishment of principles and meth- 
ods with which to carry it forward. One great danger is in- 
herent in the whole scheme. Much authority and power is 
taken away from those local communities accepting the pro- 
visions of the law. Matters of equipment, courses of study, 
qualifications of teachers, and even methods of teaching, are 
largely under the control of the State and Federal boards. 
Let us hope that the broad and liberal policy of the present 
Federal Director, Dr. Prosser, who stated that local com- 
munities shall be given the largest freedom possible in the ap- 
plication of this law to the vocational education in the schools, 
will prevail throughout the country. Another danger in 
connection with the development of this movement is the 
establishment of separate vocational schools. Let the work 
be done under the supervision of existing boards and super- 
intendents, and in departments of regularly established 
schools. To go outside of these and establish separate State
-P-A-G-E-246
  236 APPENDIX 
or local boards of education would be unnecessary duplica- 
tion and a useless expenditure of the people’s money. The 
same kind of men and the same kind of teachers would likely 
be found on these separate boards and in separate schools, 
and nothing is to be gained that could not be had, with 
many added advantages, by establishing these vocational 
courses in schools already existing.

covering a season or a more or less extended 
period of time. 
2. It must be a part of the instruction in ag- 
riculture of the school. 
8. There must be a problem more or less new 
to the pupil. 
4. The parents and pupil should agree with 
the teacher upon the plan. 
5. Some competent person must supervise the

selected by the student with the advice and 
consent of the teacher and parent. The

student sufficient time for the work for the 
project; (c) allow the student the net pro- 
fits accruing from the project. 
2, Equipment. The equipment required will 
vary widely with the type of project. For 
the plant production projects at least one- 
tenth acre of land will be necessary. For 
animal husbandry projects, pigs, poultry, 
baby beeves, with necessary feeds, build- 
ings, etc., will be required. For those stu- 
dents who are unable to furnish a satis- 
factory equipment at home the Local 
Board may arrange to supply, at the 
school, such of the equipment as may be 
found desirable and necessary. It is ad- 
vised, however, that school projects be 
substituted for home projects only under 
unusual circumstances. 
8. The supervisor in charge shall visit each 
project at least once each month for the 
purpose of directing and giving such ad- 
vice as may be needed. 
4. Reports.

teachers, supervisors, and directors of vocational 
agriculture shall have completed a four years’ 
college course in Vocational Agricultural Edu- 
cation. Candidates for admission to this course 
must have presented upon entrance to the course

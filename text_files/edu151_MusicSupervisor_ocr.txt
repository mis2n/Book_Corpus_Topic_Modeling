  PREFACE 
The author aims to present in these pages the 
salient factors that should constitute the professional 
activity of the Supervisor of Music. 
Assuming his technical preparation to be sufficient, 
the chapters of this book discuss the practical ap- 
plication of the Supervisor’s skill and training, not 
alone to the demands of the schoolroom, but to the 
needs of the entire community as a natural amplifi- 
cation of the school and its work. 
The author desires to express his obligation and 
appreciation for the use of original matter contributed 
by him to 
THE MUSICIAN, Boston, for the text of the 
chapters of this volume devoted to Community 
Music, and to THE ETUDE, Philadelphia, for the 
substance of Chapter XVIII.

  CHAPTER I 
Tue Fievp or Lasor 
Before the Supervisor may enter upon the 
efficient practice of public school music certain 
facts should engage his attention and command 
his consideration. 
We will assume for a moment that the neces- 
sary professional training has been attained, and 
that the Supervisor is now ready to begin work. 
What point of vantage will permit him to view 
the field of his professional activity, its possible 
expansion into an ever-widening circle of utility, 
its relationship with concurrent school and 
social activities? 
To begin with, no one lives and works unto 
himself alone. Though we pursue our ambi- 
tions along individual pathways, these con- 
stantly cross and intercross, bringing us into 
frequent and intimate relationships with our 
fellow-beings. The fact that we are, in count- 
less ways, related to contemporary individuals 
and institutions is the basis of all work for 
service. 
That we are all, and in a greater degree than 
we commonly realize, workers of intereommuni- 
cating interests must be the basic consideration. 
That people do not perceive this fact and reckon 
with it accounts for many failures in all walks
-P-A-G-E-10
    10 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
of life. To avoid a failure due to such a cause 
let us inquire what are the relationships, near 
and remote, that immediately spring into being 
the moment the Supervisor of music enters the 
community to inaugurate his professional 
activity. 
In whatever city he may have procured his 
position the Supervisor will find that a Board of 
Education and a Superintendent of schools are 
respectively the legislative and executive heads 
of the educational system. A little inquiry will 
make it clear to him that he is become a 
factor in a more or less extensive organization. 
This may be pictured something like this: 
1300 Children 
35Grade Teachers 
      It does not matter whether the Supervisor 
imagines himself standing in authority at the 
right hand of the Superintendent or in service 
among the thirty-five teachers; what he must 
realize is this: [He is to succeed in making the 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  THE FIELD OF LABOR ll 
thirteen hundred children at least as capable in 
music as they are becoming capable in every 
other subject. 
To secure this result he must be sure of him- 
self and of his subject. He must know how to 
secure the enthusiastic participation of the 
grade teachers. On his part he must partici- 
pate freely, and if need be as a learner, in the full 
educational program of the Superintendent. 
In these and many other ways will he establish 
for the general benefit (which includes his own) 
those intercommunicating interests of which 
we have already spoken. 
All this suggests that the Supervisor need 
have but little imagination to see that (if he is 
to suc ) the Board, the Superintendent, the 
thirty-five teachers and himself must constitute 
a working unit. Furthermore, it should be easy 
for him to understand that the thirteen hundred 
children are-not the endpoint of all the effort 
that is centered upon them. What they be- 
come capable of doing does not cease with them. 
It moves on to an ever-widening area of in- 
fluence. If now he will take his place and look 
beyond the children and out upon the com- 
munity from which they come, he will see this: 
   
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
The majority of these ten thousand people 
are individual property owners; they are also 
partnership owners in the municipal (town) 
property: The town hall, the school land and 
buildings, the highways, the public library, the 
fire protection equipment, and the like. And 
these ten thousand people by virtue of being 
corporate owners of this property become em- 
ployers of many specialists. They employ and 
pay the municipal officers for conducting the 
business of the town, the firemen for being 
ready to protect it against destruction; they 
pay for the construction and upkeep of high- 
ways to insure safe and easy travel. They 
likewise engage and pay the police, the Super- 
intendent of schools, the teachers, and the new 
Supervisor of music. They purchase and pay 
for all sorts of school and other supplies and 
undertake to keep the buildings in a condition 
suitable for their high educational purpose. 
The ten thousand people constituting the 
town have, therefore, many demands, every one 
of which costs money. The town is, in fact, a 
business firm of ten thousand partners, who, 
- because the partnership is so large in numbers, 
must elect certain people to act for them. 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-13
THE FIELD OF LABOR 13 
By collecting so much money from each prop- 
erty owner, on an assessed valuation of holdings 
the authorized officers of the town secure the 
necessary funds with which to pay its indebted- 
ness. If the town has never before had a 
music Supervisor, the advent of the young man 
whose fortunes we are following can take place 
only after the town officers have provided 
enough money to pay his salary and such con- 
tingent expenses as his office must incur. And 
the only way by which funds may be procured 
to this end is by the one process of taxation that 
pays for everything else. Thus, while the Su- 
pervisor is ostensibly employed by the school 
authorities, his real employer is the business 
corporation of ten thousand partners. 
He should now see himself in this relationship: 
  The Supervisor. occupies, at least in this pic-, 
ture, a central position. He will conclude, if he 
thinks about it, that the only satisfactory way 
in which the taxpayers can offer him his salary 
is in actual money; that the only source from 
which money may be forthcoming in the form 
of taxes is from prosperous house-holders, suc- 
cessful industries, and profitable commercial 
enterprises; for on these the very life of every 
community and its institutions depend. 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
Therefore, as he finds time, the Supervisor 
must try to comprehend the industrial and 
commercial activities of the town whose pros- 
perity, in terms of labor and resources, means 
the security of his position. 
Being really interested in his professional 
work as the executive of ten thousand people 
the Supervisor should not hesitate to try his 
hand for an evening or two at mapping the 
town. On this map let him locate the geo- 
graphical layout of the town, its highways and 
waterways, its relative areas; mark the places 
locating industries, institutions, churches, 
schools, library, and any other significant land- 
marks. It will not be necessary, let us hope, to 
suggest that he acquaint himself with the musi- 
cal activities of the community, its church 
music, musical organizations, number of music 
teachers, number of school children studying 
music privately; and the number of families 
with musical equipment and with musical possi- 
bilities of some sort. 
One may attempt to secure such facts as these 
by direct and careful study and inquiry, which 
shall result in exact knowledge, or by some 
other means which may result in very hazy un- 
certainties. If the Supervisor’s methods are 
those which result in exact information, he will 
find all he can learn about the community in 
which he works to be of value to him. People 
“in institutions will gladly become his aides.
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE FIELD OF LABOR 15 
He should recognize the work that private 
music teachers are doing with school children, 
for it has a value in the public educational plan. 
The public library is of much possible service to 
him, and he can be of no less possible service to 
it, for it should procure some good music litera- 
ture and music scores to be used in conjunction 
with class work in music. And he should in- 
vestigate those communities that have added 
mechanical musical instruments to the public 
library as a portion of its cultural equipment 
and determine their value in his own daily work 
in the schools. 
Now all this has not to be done on the day the 
Supervisor arrives in town. It may take him 
many months, if not a year or so, to secure 
these facts — even longer, perhaps, to make the 
alliances suggested here. But they must 
occupy his attention, for they are indispensable 
to his fullest measure of success. This consti- 
tutes a type of work which, after its kind, is as 
necessary as that other which must go on per- 
sistently, namely, the team-work with the 
Superintendent and teachers which shall per- 
mit music to contribute its best toward the 
ideal educational results that the teaching 
bodies are attempting to secure. This side of 
educational work includes not only exact in- 
formation, but that patient application which 
results from the contribution of a subject like 
music to the curriculum. The object is to do
-P-A-G-E-16
16 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
the best one can to influence and enrich the 
little citizen who spends a few years of life in 
school and a great many out of it. 
How, in fact, can the art of music do its best; 
that is, be made to do its best on this assign- 
ment of years?

This should prove at least suggestive of what 
the music Supervisor may think and do to pre- 
vent his art from failure to find its rightful place 
in the child’s education. Such lines of inquiry 
as we have touched upon will result in facts of 
the most important kind. These facts will, in 
turn, help to vitalize the music work of the 
schools, securing for it not spectacular value, but 
that solid educational regard which is an earnest 
of its worth. 
Following the procedure of the Efficiency 
expert, may we not essay to formulate, at this 
point, an outline, by the aid of which, the Su- 
pervisor may readily grasp his town at a glance. 
The facts which he will secure by filling up this 
outline may not appear for some time in the 
light of their true value, but the value is there, 
and will gradually manifest itself in various 
ways.

not actual but purely arbitrary totals.)

CHAPTER II 
Tue Supervisor AS MEMBER 
OF THE TEacHING Facu.ty 
Just as the Supervisor must regard himself as 
one of many teachers, so he must regard music 
as one of many subjects. While to him, as 
specialist, music will always assume the place 
of prime importance, it will be accepted by the 
teaching body only as a single factor contribu- 
tory to a complex of subjects which complex, in 
turn, finds unity in making for a definite purpose. 
It is this word Purrosg that should most 
particularly engage our attention and court our 
investigation. While it has often been said 
that education aims to secure the liberation of 
the mind, it has perhaps more truly been said 
that education is a process for awakening, de- 
veloping, and organizing the mind. This pro- 
cess directs itself upon the end that the child 
shall increase in power and wisdom and so 
gradually become capable of working to the 
best interests of himself and of the society of 
which he forms a part. Whether or not educa- 
tion actually accomplishes all this is a ques- 
tion; but it must be accepted as a fact, without 
shadow of doubt, that this is what education 
19
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
strives to accomplish; is that to which it seeks 
to adapt itself more and more perfectly; striving 
always to equip the child for practical living. 
We have only to stop for a moment to con- 
sider the magnitude of the mechanism, to stop 
for more than a moment. to count the number 
of its operatives, and to pause yet longer to 
note the millions of children who cannot wait 
for perfection of methods and of systems be- 
cause Time is relentlessly taking away their 
childhood and adding unto them the symbols 
common to men and women. < Education then 
is a process striving toward an Ideal which has 
for its purpose to make a high type of citizen 
out of all types of children} To perceive what 
is involved in the effort to attain this purpose 
or anything approaching it, we must bring into 
the picture some suggestion of the equipment 
involved. 
The nation of one hundred million people 
dwells in fifteen million homes, over the thres- 
holds of which there pour every morning on the 
way to school twenty millions of children. 
Approximately six hundred thousand teachers 
receive these pupils of primary and grammar 
grades. To these six hundred thousand teachers 
there must be added the teaching staff of 
specialists: Superintendents, Directors, Music, 
Drawing, and other Supervisors. Here is an 
army of people conducting a Children’s Crusade 
of such enormous proportions that the figures 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  AS MEMBER OF TEACHING FACULTY 21 
overwhelm the mind, denying it the privilege 
to form a concrete picture. 
But there is solace in the fact that though we 
cannot grasp the whole panorama, we know 
that its movement is a complex of many centers, 
more or less alike in their purpose and operation. 
In brief, what the nation as a whole is trying to 
do with its children is precisely what every city 
and town is, or should be, trying to do. There- 
fore, the place of residence of the individual 
Supervisor presents many, if not all of the prin- 
cipal practices that arise in the effort to accom- 
plish what we have already stated to be the 
Purpose of Education: 
To make high types of citizens out of all types 
of children. 
If this vast army had a commander-in-chief 
who determined every plan, established every 
policy, directed every operation, the task of its 
individual officers and lesser workers would be 
specific and, let us add, machine-like. But the 
conduct, for example, of a commissary depart- 
ment is not to be likened to the problems of 
education. The one is largely material, the 
other is almost wholly spiritual. The one is 
simplified as a problem by the application of 
mathematics. The other augments as the spirit- 
ual vision of the worker increases. Great edu- 
. cational leaders have ever been the men and 
women to whom great spiritual vision has come. 
In all our doings in education we must never
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
overlook this factor of vision, increasing in 
range, from day to day, as we learn to peer into 
the illimitable. 
This vast national educational activity, then, 
finds it microcosm in the town in which we have 
placed the Supervisor of music of the previous 
chapter. Here before him are the substantial 
factors typical of education everywhere. How 
shall he meet them, not only in their local appli- 
cation, but in this as an expression of the na- 
tional spirit of design in education? 
The fundamental processes of education have 
become almost platitudinous: From whole to 
part. From known to unknown. These and 
many other statements are familiar to us, but 
for that very reason they are apt to elude us in 
their depth of wisdom. They suggest one es- 
sential principle: The processes of education, 
taken by and large, are just as applicable in 
music as they are in other subjects. And con- 
sequently any educational process found to be of 
value in music must be just as valuable in read- 
ing, spelling, and grammar. 
But reading, spelling, and grammar, taking 
the schools of the country over, are taught with 
a reasonably high percentage of success. Chil- 
dren learn to perform the operations involved 
in these subjects and to perform them well. 
But taking the identical schools of the country 
over results in music are less satisfactory. 
What is the reason for this condition?
-P-A-G-E-23
  AS MEMBER OF TEACHING FACULTY 23 
v 
There is not one, but there are many reasons. 
To begin with, music is still regarded by many 
educators as a non-utilitarian subject. This 
is, in a measure, due to the fact that Superin- 
tendents, in the training for their office, study 
music so little that while they may approve of 
it, their knowledge of its value is negligible. 
They have to learn of this after they assume 
office or they may never learn it. Again, it 
seems never to occur to the average Supervisor 
of music to attempt to convince his Superin- 
tendent of the one hundred per cent of efficient 
service that music may be made to perform. 
That is, the average Supervisor is not a good 
salesman. Presumably he knows the value of 
the contribution of his profession to education 
and believes in it, but he fails to sell his idea 
to his fellow-worker. 
It would be amazingly worth while, however, 
if the Supervisor would set himself the task of 
preparing as a subject to be presented to a man 
hard of persuasion, say, twenty reasons why 
music is indispensable in the schools of the town. 
Every Supervisor worthy of the name is capable 
of doing this and of winning out in any fair 
presentation of his claims. Then, having won 
out, it becomes his next duty to insist that music 
is responsive to all he claims for it only when 
given a fair deal. And this fair deal takes the 
form of Timer, Marertat, ASSISTANCE, AND 
EqQuipMent.
-P-A-G-E-24
  24 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
If the Supervisor will put the case of music 
before his Superintendent and teaching as- 
sociates so forcibly that he actually wins them 
to his ideas of its value, a good beginning will 
have been made. And yet, strange to say, 
this is a form of beginning that is not always 
made. 
Anyone familiar with the early history of 
training schools for music Supervisors, knows 
that no school,and comparatively few individuals, 
paid the slightest attention to the principles of 
pedagogy as essential in a Supervisor’s training. 
But that day, fortunately, is past. 
Rather it was assumed that music, being 
an art, comes into education in quite an inde- 
pendent way; in a way, in fact, which may 
disregard the old and well-tried principles that 
had come to their glorv both in,great and hum- 
ble schools. 
But in the past decade the conviction has 
grown with men and women, leaders in super- 
vision, that the principles of education are so 
fundamental that they apply just as pertinently 
to music as they do to English, to reading, and 
to geography. But even yet there is much 
training work in music supervision that ig- 
nores the subject of educational psychology - 
and pedagogy, assuming the student will come 
by this knowledge through experience. He 
may, but it is a costly way. And then again he 
may not; a result which would prove, to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
eg Ey Se ee LE ey ee ee ee ey ee 
AS MEMBER OF TEACHING FACULTY 25 
Supervisor and to the schools, even more costly. 
Returning now to the individual Supervisor, 
whose first steps we are following, it is obviously 
his business to be adequately prepared not only 
in music, and in the methods of presentation 
peculiar to it; but he must recognize that his 
study shall include this other and, in a sense, 
greater art of knowing the pedagogy and psychol- 
ogy of his profession as teacher. Not as music 
teacher alone must he know this but as a 
teacher, associate with men and women who are 
attempting to peer into the future for the sake 
of children yet unborn. 
Trreparable harm is done wherever the Su- 
pervisor’s conception of his work is the other 
way about. It is a glorious matter to conduct 
an orchestra and chorus in the presence of the 
townspeople. One seems suddenly to burst 
into prominence and fame. But, after all, 
this is only a by-product, so to speak, of the 
patient, plodding application of educational 
principles to music, made hour after hour and 
day after day, in the schoolroom. Therefore, 
grade by grade, such studies as these should be 
taken up: 
A STUDY OF THE CLASS 
1. What is the daily program in this room? 
2. What does the system of which this 
grade is a unit, require it to accomplish between
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
the time of opening school in the morning and 
its close in the afternoon? 
3. The Supervisor will, to his own immediate 
profit, study the daily program of the teacher 
in each room. Let him become intimately ac- 
quainted with just how she has to spend her 
time; the number of subjects she is expected to 
teach perfectly; the rapid succession of classes; 
the number of times through the year that the 
day’s program is interrupted by the coming 
of the specialist, like himself. Finally, let him 
ascertain how much time the grade teacher 
spends out of school to keep up her work.

maximum amount of music instruction and prac-

your part. 
A STUDY OF THE GRADE TEACHER 
1. Is she experienced as a teacher? 
2. Does she control the class well? 
3. Is she quiet, forceful, resourceful, always 
in command? 
4. Or is she nervous, easily disturbed, ir- 
ritable, distracted, a poor team worker? 
5. To what extent is she capable of directing 
the music work, as you require it, properly to 
supplement your efforts? 
6. What is her individual need in music 
study? That is, what can you, the Supervisor, 
suggest to her as material for study and prac- 
tice which will make her an efficient substitute 
and assistant? 
7. Has she all necessary equipment for her- 
self and the class? 
8.° Does she follow strictly the lesson as- 
signments that you leave with her? 
A STUDY OF MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT 
1. Has each room a sufficient supply of . 
charts and books? } 
2. Has it enough blackboard space reserved 
for music?
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
3. Or is the room under-equipped? 
4. Is all material in good condition? 
5. What is the time cost of equipping the 
class for the music recitation? This has to do 
with location of material, and the time it takes 
to place it in the hands of the children ready 
to begin. 
A STUDY OF THE SUPERVISOR BY HIMSELF 
It is only by pondering on the exclamation of 
the poet, which begs that we may see ourselves 
as others see us, that we remove the grime from 
the mirror of environment into which we are for- 
ever peering, and in which we usually see only 
what we want to see. 
1. DoJ practise all the efficiencies I demand? 
2. Am I clear in my assignments both to 
my teachers and to myself ? 
8. When I leave a room does the teacher 
perfectly comprehend what she is to do in prepa- 
ration for my next visit? 
4. Have I told her positively how to do it? 
5. Am I welcomed by teachers and pupils? 
6. Is response to my demands hearty and 
immediate, or half-hearted and dragging? 
7. Am I, by each day’s work in the schools, 
increasing in knowledge and training? 
8. When I fail to arouse enthusiasm* in the 
class-room do I try to discover the reason?   
*Enthusiasm: to be inspired by God.

9. Do I so conduct the music of the class- 
room that teacher and children feel that each 
new lesson carries them forward? 
10. Do I secure adequate results by simple 
means or am I loading myself and my teachers 
with an intricate and burdensome system? 
Furthermore, it will benefit the Supervisor 
to know of the grade teacher: 
1. Just what she is required to teach in 
number of subjects covering an entire school 
year. 
2. What the sum total is in time cost? 
8. Is she willing to augment her music 
knowledge and skill? 
4. What is the most direct, easiest, quickest, 
and securest way for her to accomplish this? 
5. Does she follow work-assignments faith- 
fully? 
AND IN RESPECT AGAIN OF EQUIPMENT 
1. If this room is under-equipped, if it lacks 
necessary material, or if books and charts are 
in bad condition, or if material is so placed that 
it costs too much time in handling; if any one 
of these or other negative condition handicaps 
either the teacher or yourself, it is essential for 
the Superintendent to know the fact, and for 
you, the Supervisor, to be able to show him the 
cost in terms of education failure. That is, 
with proper work on thepart of the grade teacher
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
and yourself, and with adequate equipment, the 
class can accomplish in the year approximately 
so-and-so much. Let us say its maximum at- 
tainment under proper conditions is... ... 100% 
Without adequate conditions, charge 
against this total of 100% the following: 
Under-equipment ............ 20% 
Inconvenience of equipment ...20% 
Negative reaction on teacher and 
  
50% 50%   
Balance in possible benefit... ... 50% 
If the whole matter be regarded in the light 
of an investment, of skill, time, and equipment, 
and if the required one hundred per cent of 
result be charged with the damages, the benefit 
becomes almost mathematically definite. 
The Supervisor, then, is efficient as school- 
room worker: 
1. When he is, by training, an educator. 
2. When he knows the secret of intimate and 
valuable-team work with his entire corps of 
fellow-workers. 
Not a few school-room tragedies are the re- 
sult of unwise and unwarranted assignments; 
of demands made upon a teacher by those who 
are utterly ignorant of pre-existing demands. 
It is often the old story of the last straw added 
thoughtlessly to the camel’s burden.  
-P-A-G-E-31
  AS MEMBER OF TEACHING FACULTY 31 
The grade teacher’s daily program must be 
efficiently organized, each minute of the work- 
ing day must be assigned to its purpose. This 
purpose must include some elasticity for the 
play of parts in the day’s mechanism. The 
Supervisor’s music assignment, therefore, must 
fall in place as the perfectly adjusted part of 
the whole. When the grade teacher’s daily 
program is disorganized from any cause, the Su- 
pervisor will fare badly. Hence the necessity is 
immediate and momentous that his grasp of the 
situation shall be based upon exact knowledge of 
facts: of time, sequence of subjects, materials 
and equipment, of assignments as a whole, and 
of assignments reduced to daily practice. 
Tn brief, in the Supervisor’s art there must be: 
included a highly developed degree of organ-, 
ization and of administrative ability that shall 
aim to secure not merely military precision, but 
precision plus elastic co-operative inter-relation 
of work. School-room co-operation is not of the 
militarytype. It thrives on order, definiteness, 
and such qualities applied (shall we say, of the 
heart?) as make for mutual assistance and 
sympathetic helpfulness. 
The various studies suggested in this chapter, 
if thoroughly worked out, will yield the Super- 
visor infinitely more than seems at first sight 
to be included within the scope of the queries 
given under the various captions. All such 
Efficiency investigation leads us out into the

open. Strange as it may seem, we cling to the 
old ways, not because we are convinced that 
they are the best ways, but because we are 
bound to them by the bonds of tradition, cus- 
tom, convention, and superstition. Once we 
become fearless investigators of our own domain, 
we are certain to be discoverers of wonderful 
treasure trove. 
And all must be inspired, in music as in 
/ everything else, by the Ideal of Attainment 
which covers successfully the whole period of the 
school course only when it is so arranged as to 
accomplish every day’s assignment in perfect 
relation thereto.

CHAPTER III 
Tue Supervisor as TEAM WoRKER 
I. 
While it may seem that all the suggestion of 
the title of this chapter has been included in the 
preceding pages, it may not be amiss to direct 
the reader’s attention to two distinct efforts in 
the preparation and establishment of profes- 
sional ethics to the end that team work in schools 
may become an increasing activity. 
There are included in the pages of this chapter: 
1. The Code of Professional Ethics as 
adopted by the New Hampshire State Teachers’ 
Association in October, 1915. 
2. That of the Levana Club, of Worcester, 
Massachusetts. 
Perusal of these Codes will convince the Su- 
pervisor that their statements are valuable, 
both for the literal information they convey and 
for the suggestions they offer. 
We have attempted to show in what relation 
the Supervisor stands to the tax-paying citi- 
zens who guarantee his salary; to the families 
from which the children come who are receiving 
instruction; to the Board of Education; the 
Superintendent of schools; the body of grade 
teachers; and, perhaps no less intimately, the 
33
-P-A-G-E-34
  
a 34 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
town’s institutions. These various lines of 
association are truly important matters for 
reflection. A Chesterfield would undoubtedly 
construct a code of ethical conduct that would 
place one in perfect accord with each of these 
objectives. Even if it be probable that the 
Chesterfieldian effort would overdo it, it re- 
mains true that no man becomes of such momen- 
tous importance to a community that he can af- 
ford to disregard the more commonly observed 
amenities of life. He cannot afford it because 
the product of his work must suffer in conse- 
sequence. Whenever a man’s actions mani- 
fest in savagery of intenseness, in brutality of 
method, in lack of sympathy, he, himself, pays 
for the crudity of his process. That is, it is true 
for all professional men that without the most 
carefully thought-out ethical principles of 
team work, it is not possible to secure from as- 
sociates and assistants anywhere near the one 
hundred per cent of their efficient endeavor and 
attainment. 
With the town as a whole the Supervisor comes 
into intimate contact. He is a designer, a builder, 
in fact, of much that may be ideal in its life. 
With the children he becomes actual creator of 
a thought process that may illumine the darker 
hours for all life to come, that may give joy in 
all the days of life. With the Superintendent he 
must sustain, having once established it, that 
intimacy of co-worker’s relation which gives
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE SUPERVISOR AS TEAM WORKER 85 
and takes strength and inspiration. With the 
teaching body of the schools he is truly guide, 
philosopher, and friend. 
Why should a man endanger the power- 
giving quality of any of these units of associa- 
tion? Why should he assume or actually pos- 
sess mode or manner of thought and action that 
destroys where he needs to make strong?- In 
brief, why should he deny himself any oppor- 
tunity to establish conditions of the most ideal 
order when it is upon such conditions alone, as 
upon the rock foundation of the house of the 
Scriptures, that he builds. 
Anything else is a building upon the sands. 
Nor, let us add, are temperament, manner, and 
method the only factors that weave the fabric 
of good or bad team work. Years ago it used 
to be charged against the ill-prepared Supervisor 
that he generally did more damage in English 
than he could possibly repair by his music teach- 
ing. Fortunately, that type of gentleman has 
disappeared. Today the Supervisor appre- 
ciates. the fact that information, direction, and 
instruction must be conveyed in good English. . 
The entire teaching staff of any institution needs 
this tool, precisely as every carpenter needs a 
hammer. It is not a passable form of English 
that the teacher should be equipped to use, but 
English of the purest type. He should know the 
art of using words in speech and writing strictly 
in accord with their meaning. He can never 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
learn that art except by study, nor can he sub- 
stitute for good speech grimaces or motions of 
the hands and feet. : 
There is, in short, no factor of the Supervisor’s 
life that can be allowed to run to waste, or to 
weeds, without a lowering of the individual 
- value. The Supervisor has a direct and worthy 
investment in his personal appearance, in his 
habits, in the form and subject of his conversa- 
tion; in all that makes up his private, public, 
and civic life. The sun shines on him from the 
very nature of his position “day and night.” 
It is a comment on his value as perceived by 
others whether the town’s children greet him as 
a friend and superior, or whether they quietly 
ignore him, as a menace to their liberty of 
thought and action. 
II. 
Following is the New Hampshire Code re- 
ferred to in the beginning of this chapter. The 
Supervisor, it is hoped, will find in it a suggestion 
for the building of a similar code in his own work: 
It is desirable that there should be a general pro- 
fessional agreement as to the designations to be 
given to members of the teaching profession accord- 
ing to the functions which they perform. The fol- 
lowing designations are, therefore, recommended, 
and it is hoped that different official bodies, quali- 
fied to do so, will eventually give them their sanc- 
tion.
-P-A-G-E-37
THE SUPERVISOR AS TEAM WORKER 37 
The title of the heads of the Normal Schools 
should be Director. 
A professional educator engaged in the supervision 
of local school systems should be called Superintend- 
ent, and his assistant in the work of general super- 
vision should be called Assistant Superintendent. 
A person whose sole duty is directing both teach- 
ers and pupils in a special department of school 
work should be called a Supervisor. 
The head of an approved secondary school of the 
first class should be called Head Master. 
A school officer having the supervision and control 
of teachers and pupils in an elementary school or of a 
secondary school below the grade of first class 
should be called Principal. 
The teaching force of the New Hampshire State 
College and the Normal Schools should be called the 
Faculty and that of secondary schools should be 
called the Staff. 
The title of Professor should be reserved for teach- 
ers holding chairs in colleges and graduate schools. 
The duty of teachers to the community is to be 
loyal to those in authority over them— In case of a 
conflict of educational ideals, between teachers and 
trustee or school boards, while they should recog- 
nize the fact that the school authorities must direct 
the general policy of the school, it is the duty of 
teachers to be loyal to their professional ideals, to 
protest against any violation of professional ethics, 
and in extreme cases to resign, stating theirreasons . 
to the community. ' 
While never exploiting their position, teachers 
should always maintain a progressive conservatism 
of thought and action, dignity of character, honesty 
of purpose, and should take an unqualified stand 
for the best in education and in social life. 
It is the duty of every teacher to regard every
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
other teacher as a fellow craftsman and as entitled 
to all the rights, courtesies, and emoluments that 
usually obtain in other professions, with recognized 
standards. 
It is unprofessional for teachers to criticise co- 
laborers and predecessors, as such procedure tends 
to weaken the confidence in which the work of our 
profession is held by the community. 
All teachers should actively affiliate themselves 
with professional organizations and should acquaint 
themselves with the procedings of the State Associa- 
tion and should interest themselves in its activities. 
It is an essential part of the ethics of the profes- 
sion that teachers should constantly familiarize 
themselves with its recognized and authoritative 
literature. 
Since they are rightly regarded as examples to 
pupils, teachers should always so conduct themselves 
that no just reproach may be brought against them. 
Where liberty of conscience is not concerned, they 
should stand ready to make personal sacrifice, be- 
cause of the prejudices of the community in which 
they live. 
It is unprofessional for teachers to tutor pupils 
of their own classes for remuneration. 
It is unprofessional for teachers to promote the 
interests of canvassers and other salesmen, either 
directly or indirectly, by writing testimonials of 
their wares. 
It is unprofessional for any teacher to lend him- 
self to any scheme of self-advertising. 
It is unprofessional to call for or to allow the use 
of substitutes, except for serious illness or for other 
grave reasons. 
A clear understanding of the law of contracts is 
incumbent upon all teachers. Since teachers should 
scrupulously keep whatever agreement they make,  
-P-A-G-E-39
THE SUPERVISOR AS TEAM WORKER 39 
they should refuse to sign a contract unjust and 
humiliating in form. 
It is unprofessional for teachers to resign during 
the period for which they have been engaged. They 
may rightly ask to be released, by giving notice of 
not less than four weeks, but must, in case of refusal, 
abide by their contracts. 
It is unprofessional for a teacher to underbid a - 
rival in order to secure a position. 
It is unprofessional for a superintendent or other 
school officer to visit, with a view to employing, a 
candidate at work, without the permission of his or 
her superintendent. When visiting schools, the 
visitor should never disarrange the work of the day. 
It is unprofessional for superintendents and teach- 
ers, in their relations with publishing or supply 
houses, their agents or salesmen, to give just grounds 
for the suspicion of obligation tending to influence 
the purchase or adoption of books or supplies in 
favor of any particular agent or firm. 
The indiscriminate writing of general recommenda- 
tions for pupils or teachers is unprofessional. 
Teachers should at all times be ready to assist 
one another by giving information, counsel, and ad- 
vice, and by such services and acts as teachers can 
perform without detriment to themselves or their 
work. Such reasonable service should be regarded 
as a professional duty for which remuneration be- 
yond actual expenses should not be accepted. 
It is incumbent on teachers loyally to ackaowl- 
edge all the duties and obligations of citizenship, 
and to discharge them both in letter and in spirit. 
Because of their peculiar position, teachers should 
especially regard themselves as guardians and pro- 
moters of the physical, moral, social, and spiritual 
welfare of the community in which they live. 
Teachers are and should be the servants of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
people, without regard to distinctions of political 
party, religious faith, or other matters which are 
brought into issue and upon which individuals 
honestly disagree. Teachers are fully entitled to 
liberty of conscience, but it is unprofessional for 
them to become partisans upon issues which divide 
the community. 
Til. 
In order to secure unity of purpose and to 
inspire high ideals in the work of education, the 
Levana Club, of Worcester, Massachusetis, 
adopts the following Code: — 
CuaractEerR. We believe that the first qualifica- 
tion for the teacher is a character of the highest type. 
A teacher should strive to be absolutely honest in 
every detail of life; to be just and generous; to be 
free from selfishness and jealousy; to see beyond the 
petty concerns of private convenience and pleasure; 
and to stand for what is best in the life of the com- 
munity. 
Prrsonauity. We believe that every teacher 
should cultivate that superior power which uncon- 
sciously transmits values, attitudes, and ideals, and 
creates an atmosphere of refinement, culture, and 
dignity. 
Soctan Rexations: We believe that the teacher 
should have an interest in the fundamental prob- 
lems and purposes of modern social life, so keen and 
so vital, that the reaction to the situations of school 
life and classroom instruction will be true to the 
larger aspirations of the outside world. 
ArrituvE: (a) We believe that we should give 
one another loyal co-operation, mutual support, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
    THE SUPERVISOR AS TEAM WORKER 41 
deferential treatment in all professional and busi- 
ness relations. 
(b) We believe that both appreciation and frank 
constructive criticism should be given honestly and 
kindly, and should be welcomed as a stimulus to 
better work. 
(ce) We believe that the teacher’s attitude to- 
wards the pupils should be sympathetic, and that 
the child’s individuality should be respected. 
(d)_ We believe that our attitude towards teach- 
ing should be professional and not commercial; 
that we should put public service before personal 
ain. 
(e) We believe that each individual teacher 
should feel a personal obligation to maintain a high 
professional standard. 
OrcanizaTion: We believe that organizations 
of teachers should recognize their responsibility 
towards the whole body, and in taking action should 
regard the honor and credit of the profession. _We 
believe that any use of such organizations for selfish 
gain or political control is unprofessional. 
ProressionaL Preparation: We believe that ade- 
quate preparation both in scholarship and in pro- 
fessional training is necessary that we may invigorate 
life through knowledge and make constant progres- 
sive adjustments to changing needs. 
Positions: (a) We believe that the recognized 
basis for appointment to any position should be 
moral and educational worth together with fine per- 
sonality. 
(6) We believe that it is unprofessional to attempt, 
by any means, to secure a position which has not been 
declared vacant. 
(c) We believe that is it unprofessional for any 
teacher to use the influence of politicians, of publish- 
ing or supply houses, or of any agencies which may 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
be affected by motives other than those of public 
interest. 
(d) We believe that a contract is a business obli- 
gation which cannot be set aside without the con- 
sent of both parties concerned. 
Press anp Pusuic: We believe that it is un- 
professional for a teacher to betray any confidence 
concerning the school, the teachers, or the pupils, 
or to make public or give to the press any informa- 
tion which should come from other sources. 
Anyone who carefully considers the state- 
ments that make up these and other Codes of 
Professional Ethics will recognize that funda- 
mental to their successful application is the 
simple business principle of salesmanship. We 
co-operate most successfully when we are cap- 
able, out of an honorable intention and a sincere 
service motive, of making the other man accept 
our idea; and no less so, when we are capable of 
being influenced to accept his. In the one case 
we sell the other man our idea; in the other case 
he sells us his. 
There is a good deal of sentimental day- 
dreaming about some individual codes. As 
teachers of art we probably assume to hold our- 
selves above the world of the business man and 
of his methods. But a little wisdom and ex- 
perience, added to what we may have, shows us 
that of all great artists the world has produced 
thus far, none is greater than the business man 
who serves the public, ranges the world to find 
goods for it, creates them if he cannot find them, 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  
THE SUPERVISOR AS TEAM WORKER 43 
and does it all on the simple yet efficient basis 
of mutual trust and mutual profit. 
Now the selling idea of the business man is his 
secondary asset; hence it is the second thing he 
needs after he has provided himself with the 
first, which is preparation for service. With the 
teacher there is no less need for these two as- 
sets: (1) A clearly perceived service to be 
rendered; (2) the ability to sell the service 
wherever it is needed. The Superintendent 
must not merely enterta in an ideal for the school 
system; he must sell it (conscious 0 its worth) 
to every member of his teaching staff so that they 
all will gladly buy the idea of him and apply it. 
In fact, a school system offers a complex of 
inter-relating service-salesmanship. The Su- 
pervisor must possess his major ideal and his 
group of minor ideals; he must sell these to 
Superintendent, principals, and grade teachers. 
The ultimate result of selling the idea or ideal 
must necessarily reach out to the citizens on the 
one hand and to the children on the other. It 
took four months for a school teacher to sell me 
the idea of Long Division, because he never 
troubled to show me the goods carefully enough 
for me to comprehend what they were like. One 
day he became convinced that I really wanted to 
buy Long Division and that I did not seem to 
know how to inaugurate and complete the pur- 
chase. Then he took pains to show me the 
principle, the process, and the purpose. 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
    44 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
This sort of salesmanship is called handling 
human nature. No one can handle human 
nature by brute force, by a conscienceless 
method, by ignoring it, or by a selfish will. 
Someone once pointed out that it is easy to get 
a man’s attention by hitting him with a brick, 
but hard to sell him anything immediately after- 
ward. So we cannot for long, and never suc- 
cessfully, bulldoze, drive, and abuse our associate 
workers. Some Supervisors seem to succeed in 
this form of conduct. But there is a yawning 
chasm ahead of him whose schemes include this 
fatal process. Everybody but himself is watch- 
ing his step, because they all know that he does 
not know that he is about to disappear. 
To handle other people we must make up our 
mind to do it on the basis of helping them. To 
help them we must understand them and their 
needs. They must receive forcible direction 
tempered with sympathy; be willing to travel 
a straight line for a definite purpose, under 
kindly guidance and instruction without yield- 
ing to the desire for self-indulgence or enter- 
tainment. 
The divine Creator of energy did not 
make us all in one mould, but He gave us all 
one power, namely, that of being able to aid 
the other man in his quest of finding the power 
jand beauty of his life.
-P-A-G-E-45
  CHAPTER IV 
Tue Supervisor As Errictent Epucator 
The skill that teaches is one skill, as the Ori- 
entals put it, but its channels of expression are 
many. 
But skill is not needed to teach a parrot to 
speak. The bird picks up the sound that it. 
hears most frequently and, out of exactly the 
same impulse that prompts a magpie to steal a 
silver spoon, appropriates what it can take. 
We have here, in both instances, an illustration 
of reaction to environment. 
Teaching, as a process, goes deeper than 
merely the providing of environmental demands 
for parrots and magpies. It is a process that 
aims to stimulate power; so to instruct the owner 
of the power that he shall know how best to 
direct it; and, finally, to make clear what shall 
be the ultimate purpose, to the man and his en- 
vironment, of the presence, use, and direction 
of his power. 
A subject, then, is valuable in the educational 
curriculum, to the extent that it stimulates and 
draws upon power; to the extent that it re- 
quires the-distribution of power through many 
channels of operation, and finally resolves it 
into serviceable use, or beauty, or both. Now 
45
-P-A-G-E-46
    46 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
this matter of serviceable use and beauty has 
produced on the one hand, technical, trade, and 
vocational schools; on the other, schools of art. 
In the public school system, where such 
division is not possible as a matter of actual 
plan, the distinction seems not to exist. But 
it is there for all that. When teaching aims 
to discover utility and beauty, it finds them, or 
should, in practically every subject. If a 
teacher of English literature attempts to teach 
not only the beauty of a sonnet, but insists 
with herself that the task is not complete until 
she has succeeded equally well in showing the 
use of the sonnet to the veriest ragamuffin in 
her class, she will be amply and wonderfully 
repaid. And again, if the teacher of Geometry 
would pledge himself to resign if he fails to 
show every boy and girl in his class the poetry 
of lines and angles, the majesty of a triangle 
that involves the Earth, the Sun, and the planet 
Jupiter, for example; he too would be filled with 
delight at the great reward that would come to 
‘im. ; 
(au true teaching is a master blend of use and 
beauty. And true teaching is achieved only 
when the pupil is resolved by severe but direct 
training into an organized unit of working 
power, of discrimination and appreciation as to 
use andgbeauty in all aspects of life. 
Anything less, however seriously intentioned, 
approaches the parrot and the magpie.
-P-A-G-E-47
  
e THE SUPERVISOR AS EFFICIENT EDUCATOR 47 
This should be the supreme test that the 
Supervisor applies not only to every member 
of his teaching staff, but to himself, first, last, 
and unflinchingly— 
In the teaching of music, let him ask himself: 
1. Does the technical factor in my practice 
of music tend to crush the spirit? 
2. Is there no awakening of power? 
8. Is there too exclusive appeal made to 
that fatal facility for imitation which we all 
possess? 
4. Am I aware of what music mastery means 
in terms of a child’s growing experience with 
it in school ? 
Natural to music, as to everything else, are 
its processes and its lines of action which, once 
set into operation and guided intelligently, pro- 
duce an artistic result. (all knowledge of music me 
is contained within its processes. Music knowl- 
edge comes not from memorizing facts, but 
from setting processes into motion and déduc- 
ing facts from the operation.) A good academic 
teacher may spend weeks endeavoring to fa- 
miliarize a pupil with clef, meter sign, key sign, 
measure-content, bar and double bar. But a 
practical, energy-directing teacher will all but 
ignore them while centering the child’s atten- 
tion on the art of making pretty melodies, 
that is of composing them, which incidgntally 
involves the use of all these technical signs and 
of many others, in a vital process.  
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
The case of the boy who had a story-telling 
gift and who wished to learn to write stories, 
is, unfortunately, the too common lot of many 
gifted ones. He fell into the hands of an expert 
penman who convinced him that he should 
first perfect his handwriting. But it took 
twenty years to accomplish this to the pen- 
man’s satisfaction, and then the boy died, his 
glory all unsuspected, having never written 
anything more original than, 
If, at first, you don’t succeed, 
Try, try again. 
The processes of music are peculiar to itself, 
but the method of teaching them is less so. 
The Supervisor must be aware of this and do 
all he can, even if it takes years, to become 
familiar with the art of teaching, as an art appli- 
cable in everything. He must apply in his 
own work every principle as he learns it until 
he knows it as intimately as he knows any famil- 
iar detail. No subject is of itself capable of dic- 
tating or suggesting all that is requisite for one 
to know in order adequately to teach it. That 
particular secret has to do with the art of teach- 
ing, dissociate from any specific application. 
Therefore the teaching of music is an impossible 
process so far as resolution within itself is con- 
cerned* We must learn to teach and we must 
learn music; then in the laboratory of the school- 
room these two activities must approach, merge,
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE SUPERVISOR AS EFFICIENT EDUCATOR 49 
and weld into the solid matter of true instruc- 
tion, or that which “builds in’. 
It is not infrequently true that the Super- 
visor knows so much more about music than 
he knows about the artof teaching music that the 
results he secures are disappointing. What he 
needs to do is first to obtain some academic 
training in Pedagogy; then to study applied 
Pedagogy; meanwhile, to observe teachers 
ceaselessly; to talk with educators; to discover 
in the great laboratory of essential education 
what are the successful practices of significant 
men and women. It is at once amazing and 
pathetic to observe the extent of our content- 
ment with our own methods of madness. Of 
all astounding traits of human nature apathy 
to the new idea is easily one of the greatest, just 
as gossip is one of the meanest. 
II. 
Here is Mr. B., Supervisor in a good com- 
munity, earning a fair amount of compensation 
for his services; performing his task in the con- 
ventional way. This means that he keeps com- 
fortably busy but remains a stranger to investi- 
gation and to enthusiasm. 
But let us suppose that he sets out one morn- 
ing enthused with the sudden illumination of a 
great purpose. Something has aroused him. 
Something has, all in a moment, destroyed that 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
degree of complacent apathy that is the one 
visible sign of most men. Some circumstance 
has taken him to the top of the mountain and 
permitted him to see himself plus his undevel- 
oped resources of spirit, mind, and body. Never 
again will he move placidly along the streets of 
his town. Never again will he permit Comfort, 
Indolence, and Company to dictate the terms 
of his life. (But practically all human beings 
do this.) Mr. B. has suddenly entered upon 
the quest of his own potentiality. Fortune is 
ahead of him and he determines to attain it even 
though he remain all his life a Supervisor of 
music. For Fortune, he now knows, is best 
defined as that which eventuates for a man 
through the finest use of his power. Never 
again will he conceive it as the more or less 
accidental accumulation of goods and chattels. 
Mr. B., in the former easy life, had devoted 
a few moments, now and then, to meditating 
upon teaching, and had discovered that the art 
of teaching is inclusive of all subjects, music 
with the rest; and that it must be learned by 
special apprenticeship. He now returns to 
that thought with energy and determination; 
and in order to set the matter before himself 
fairly and squarely, he prepares to test himself 
severely. This, he has learned, is the efficiency 
device for getting at facts concerning one’s 
scope, depth, and value. It is the mirror which 
reveals us as others see us. 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE SUPERVISOR AS EFFICIENT EDUCATOR 51 
Mr. B. produces the following test for his 
own benefit: 
1. What are the best books on teaching, 
applicable to work in the public schools? 
2. Who wrote these books? 
3. What positions do these authors fill and 
for what are they noted individually? 
4. Who are some of the most significant 
teachers in the public schools of the United 
States, and why are they held to be significant? 
5. Who are the leading Supervisors, in any 
subject, and what qualities give them a repu- 
tation as leaders? 
6. What are the leading educators doing 
that I do not do? 
7. Can I learn to do these things by inten- 
sive study and application? 
8. Am I individually under-equipped; that 
is, do I get along the best I can with what I have 
happened to pick up? ' 
9. Am I making the best use of my powers 
and faculties, or have they, like Topsy, just 
simply grown up? 
10. Do I conserve my health, by plan and 
forethought, as my fundamental equipment 
asset? 
11. Am I careless of manner,speech,promise? 
12. What evidence do I give to other men 
of my perception of life, of my interpretation of 
the universe we live in, of its Creator, of patri- 
otic duty, of civic pride? That is, am IT
-P-A-G-E-52
  52 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
touching the circle of life merely here and there 
or am I striving to grasp the meaning of its en- 
tire circumference as a pathway of duty? 
18. Which is first with me, the salary I draw 
from this town, or the skill and the love for musie 
that I give its children? 
14. Am I teaching the children to learn to- 
day’s lessons as a temporary time-filler, or as 
a step toward the love and understanding of 
music for all time? 
15. Is this town slow? Yes. Am I making 
it slower ? 
16. Is this town material in its aims and 
actions? Yes. Am I trying to make it spirit- 
ual? 
17. Is this town given over to social cliques? 
Yes. Am I as clique-affected as all the rest? 
18. (Anyone, with a little imagination, can 
carry this list of questions on to his heart’s 
desire and beyond it.) 
This is a self-probing scheme of inquiry of the 
Supervisor who sets out to discover himself as 
a factor in relation to the educational activity, 
not merely ofa town, but of the American people 
as a nation. Mr. B. can keep abreast of the 
times by reading closely the magazines devoted 
to education, the reports of teachers’ con- 
ventions, the educational items printed by the 
Associated Press. It may be that he cannot 
leave town a day in a year, and yet that mar- 
velous power, the United States mail, will bring 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
THE SUPERVISOR AS EFFICIENT EDUCATOR 53 
him from afar, and place in his hands, more 
material than he can handle on his subject, 
which is not music, but teaching; the rare art 
of making another understand how he can do 
something worth while, something he has never 
done before, and from the process of which he 
can deduce knowledge. 
No need to list here for Mr. B. the magazines, 
reviews, associations, and clubs that are literally 
working night and day in his behalf. He can 
discover them readily enough and it should be 
his own task to take them on as equipment, as 
tools with which to work. And tools, let him re- 
member, are edged things that one must respect. 
There is one difficulty of which Mr. B. should 
be warned, a condition that he, a teacher of 
music, will find in the study of the science of 
Pedagogy. The difficulty is that of knowing 
how to carry over, how to apply a principle of 
teaching, exemplified in a subject other than 
music. It has been said that most men in sud- 
den need of a dentist will telephone for an ap- 
pointment, and so save waiting in what is known 
as the torture chamber; but no man, they say, 
telephones his barber, whose shop is a place 
where the aggregate of waiting hours the coun- 
try over, must be stupendous. The thing in- 
volved here is that of applying the time-saving 
principle to every operation. And so, can the 
Supervisor, observing a good teaching device 
in English grammar, catch its secret and make
-P-A-G-E-54
  
    54 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
it an equally good device in teaching music? 
Of every fact let him ask himself: 
1. Why did this statement (or device) at- 
tract my attention? 
2. What is its full significance? 
8. Wherein is it applicable in music? 
There should follow enough laboratory ex- 
periment with the principle involved to dis- 
cover its applicability in the Supervisor’s 
work. After all, the one difficult thing to learn 
is that all facts are tools with which to do good 
work. To the man who has studied them thor- 
oughly, better still, who has learned to apply 
them in daily life, such statements as: “Love 
thy neighbor as thyself,” ‘Resist not evil,” are 
tools pure and simple, because he can take them 
in hand, apply them to his problems and do con- 
structive work with them. 
Knowledge acquired academically is of little 
moment unless applied in action. To watch 
that action and deduce facts from its move- 
ments and application is to get knowledge.

CHAPTER V 
Tue Supervisor as Errictent Musictan 
I. 
Is the Supervisor a teacher or a musician? 
He is both. 
The emphasis rests on his teaching if he does 
all the grade work himself; on_ his skill as a 
directing musician, if his grade teaching force 
is thoroughly capable of carrying out his assign- 
ments. 
If the Supervisor realizes all that is involved 
in his equipment as a co-operative educator (as 
described in Chapter IV); if further he realizes 
that his preparation for supervision must be 
thorough; that his actual training begins after 
he has graduated from school and has taken up 
his professional work; if he perceives these 
simple facts of adjustment, then he is ready to 
begin to develop himself as a musician, accord- 
ing to one or two demands: 
(a) The one within himself that craves more 
knowledge, skill, and training in music, 
as highly specialized talent. 
(b) That of his official position which, 
through its requirements, reveals to him 
his unpreparedfiess to meet certain 
phases of demand. 
55 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
In this chapter we will not consider the first 
(a) of the preceding demands as it clearly con- 
cerns itself with the broader dictates of am- 
bition resting purely in music itself. In con- 
fining ourselves to the second (b) we are seeking - 
to discover the lines of technical musical train- 
ing necessary for a Supervisor in a good-sized 
community in which the ideals of the Superin- 
tendent include as artistic a concept of music 
as of anything else. 
The Supervisor may ask himself: 
What knowledge is required of me that I may 
successfully practise music supervision? 
The preceding pages have, in a measure, an- 
swered this question, but at this point let us 
review the reply, and in respect of the music 
training required, let us somewhat amplify it. 
1. The Supervisor must be by nature and 
by training an educatory 
That is, his interest must lie in music as edu- 
cational activity. He must not merely live in 
the enjoyment of superiority of position over 
a few grade teachers and children, or in the 
monumental state of elevation above mankind 
because he now and then conducts a chorus and 
orchestra. Both of these are elementary fac- 
tors subsidiary to his duty, which is that of 
teacher. 
2. To be an educator in the school sense, he 
must train himself to be a good school man. 
3. He must train himself to be a congenial
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE SUPERVISOR AS EFFICIENT MUSICIAN 57 
team worker and leader, agreeable and helpful 
in his speech, manner, appearance, perception, 
and creative ability. 
4. He must be cultured and his culture must 
not have been designed and completed years 
ago, but it must be growing, amplifying, in- 
creasing in charm and naturalness every day 
of his life. ; 
5. His civic sense must be alive. He must 
see clearly what sort of men and women he is 
helping to make out of children; what ideals of 
life he is presenting and inspiring; in short, how 
he is building the state. 
6. He must have some music training em- 
bodying principally these few elementary fac- 
tors: 
(a) A pleasing (because well-trained) speak- 
ing and singing voice. 
(b) Perfect enunciation of English words. 
(c) Some ability to play a musical instru- 
ment. 
(d) A scientifically accurate knowledge of 
the few facts of music theory. 
(e) He should be able to write as easily, as 
rapidly, and as accurately as a cultured 
man writes a letter, the music that forms 
the basis of all exercise and song material 
in any year of the school course. 
(f) The necessary training in elementary 
melody writing, harmony, simple coun- 
terpoint, and music analysis. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
(g) And suggested by the last, a knowledge 
of the simpler music forms—vocal and 
instrumental. : 
(h) The knowledge that comes from having 
analyzed and learned intimately an 
abundance of music. 
The one most frequent and lamentable omis- 
sion from the practical education even of Super- 
visors of some prominence is this of intimate 
knowledge of a wide range of music. It makes 
a vast amount of difference whether a man 
speaks about music from guesswork or from the 
intimate knowledge gained by a close study of 
it over a long historical range. 
(t) Some knowledge of music history, of 
aesthetics, of the lives of men and 
women who have won prominence in 
music, and a familiar acquaintance with 
what may be called the current history 
of music. 
(j) Conducting, perhaps. But if the Super- 
visor proposes to become festival con- 
ductor involving the use of a great or- 
chestra, it is not sufficient that he knows 
how to conduct his singers even to giv- 
ing detailed cues, leaving the orches- 
tra to come in as it may. He must 
either know his orchestra as well as he 
does his singers, or pause to learn it. 
Not a few amateur conductors dare not 
give a cue to an oboe player, for they
-P-A-G-E-59
    THE SUPERVISOR AS EFFICIENT MUSICIAN 59 
have no prescience of what the resulting 
tone will sound like. 
(k) And he should be at least as well edu- 
cated in the terms of the school as one 
is who is prepared to enter college. 
Many teachers who have this degree of educa- 
tion were unable to secure it in the schools, but 
they have industriously worked out their own 
salvation by private reading, study, association 
with others, and a wise use of their spare time. 
So far as educational training is concerned a man 
may have fared badly in his youth, but there is 
no reason for his continuing so to fare, for the 
opportunity to secure an after-school education 
in these days is little less than amazing. There 
is at least one great university that permits a 
student to do work by correspondence to the 
credit extent of one-half a Bachelor of Arts 
Degree. 
Now the musical requirements mentioned 
above area minimum. They include and imply 
the ability to read at sight, to take dictation, to 
perceive and differentiate rhythmic figures, and 
so on. The essential factors are the freedom 
and accuracy that come from a vast amount of 
actual music writing. A well equipped Super- 
visor of music should find no more difficulty in 
writing all types of music examples and songs 
than he finds in writing a ten-word telegram. 
An essential of the Supervisor’s teaching 
should be the clearness with which he perceives  
-P-A-G-E-60
  60 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
music structure. Upon this alone all phrasing 
and rhetorical dynamics depend. He should be 
able to win the interest-ofchildren by uncon- 
scious effort; in one way, perhaps, through the 
countless beautiful stories that are found in the 
biographies of the musicians... Stop for a mo- 
ment to think of their variety and inspiration. 
Bach used to walk a distance of two hundred 
miles and return merely to hear a good organist. 
Handel, as a little boy, once ran after his 
father’s coach and by so doing gained the 
favor of a Duke, and so won his desire to 
become a musician. 
Handel used to love to play for the children 
of the Foundling Hospital, and made them 
beneficiaries in his will. 
Haydn was taken from home at the age of six 
and made a chapel singer in Vienna. 
Mozart began to imitate his sister’s harpsi- 
chord lessons at the age of three. 
And so on through scores and scores of the 
most delightful incidents that one can imagine. 
(The teacher who can drop one or two of these 
stories now and again into the class conscious- 
ness has enriched it. And the beauty of it all 
is,itmay be done in the happiest way, indirectly 
and without effort, but always with joy to the 
children. ) 
7 Il. 
There is another phase of the Supervisor’s 
music training that must not be overlooked. It
-P-A-G-E-61
THE SUPERVISOR AS EFFICIENT MUSICIAN 61 
has to do with the bibliography of his profession, 
not alone as musician but as teacher— 
It was formerly the case that the Supervisor 
who used one system or course of text-books 
would scarcely deign to recognize another, in 
whose schools a rival course of texts was in use. 
We trust that the last vestige of this loyalty has 
disappeared. It is also to be hoped that no 
Supervisor is, or ever will be, who believes one 
course of books to be the best. In the nature of 
the case no such course of books can exist. Some 
books are good, other books are better; and it 
is an open question if a series of books, literally 
bad, ever appeared or ever will appear. 
Manifestly the duty of a skilful, wide-awake> 
Supervisor is to own all currently used text- 
books. His education should be sufficient to 
enable him to analyze every book in use and to 
arrive at its individual value without benefit of 
advertising matter. The number of Super- 
visors is constantly increasing in whose schools 
two or more courses are employed; one as basic, 
the other, or others, as supplementary material. 
A Supervisor who knows his work well, and 
whose efforts are seconded by Superintendent 
and grade teachers, will conduct the children 
through a basic primer or reader in so short a 
time that they can, in the one year, read another 
book or two of the same degree of difficulty. 
One of the most pathetic exhibits of the past, 
of the history of music supervision in America, 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
62 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
is the record on teachers’ assignment slips of 
such items as the following: 
On Page 36. Sing Exercises 74 and 75. 
On Page 37. Sing Exercises 80—82—83. 
On Page 38. Omit the song. 
A Supervisor who carries half an ounce of 
steam pressure can make a class of children 
feel an abounding delight in the effort to see 
how quickly, accurately, and beautifully they 
can sing everything on pages 36, 37, and 38. 
In conclusion let us say that the Supervisor of 
music who knows its story and legends will stim- 
ulate in all children an interest in the story of 
music and musicians. Arthur Bodansky re- 
cently said in an article in The Craftsman: 
“In Germany we learn music not only by 
studying it and playing it and hearing it, but 
our love of it is increased because we are taught 
the history of the great musicians; we know 
them intimately, we know their successes and 
their sorrows, we know about them when they 
were little children, and when we play their 
music we love it through loving them; and as 
we grow older we study their influence on their 
nation, on all musical development.” 
If the Supervisor loves to sit down and read 
music as he reads a novel, enjoying mentally the 
message of the music symbols, he will find a way 
to make music reading a life-long pleasure to 
others; not less replete with imaginative pleasure 
than the play, the poem, or the novel.
-P-A-G-E-63
  
THE SUPERVISOR AS EFFICIENT MUSICIAN 63 
If he learns to write melody and part-music as 
readily as the grade teacher writes English sen- 
tences, it will be no difficult thing for him to 
teachchildren howto write their music sentences. 
If his voice is well modulated, if he use it 
naturally and musically, there will never appear 
in the school rooms, over which he has charge, 
any considerable evidence of screaming, shout- 
ing, of harsh tone, and vulgar use of the voice. 
If he loves music his children will absorb so 
much from him that they will begin uncon- 
sciously to study music appreciation from the 
day of the first rote song, and never abandon it; 
and so from the beginning the love will be real. 
But if he is of the unprepared order of Super- 
visor, one who begins by force of ambition or 
circumstances to supervise before he has grasped 
the full meaning of the art, then a truly wonder- 
ful secret will be revealed to him, namely : Every 
grade teacher and every child in town, every one 
of them, will be living examples of all his own 
troubles and inefficiencies. 
Is his voice raucous? 
Theirs will be crude and uncultivated. 
Is he uncertain in sight reading? 
They will never learn the art of tt. 
Is he a stranger to the message of music? 
Tt will never be whispered into their ears. 
Is he unsuspecting of music’s mission among 
men? 
They will never catch the secret.
-P-A-G-E-64
  
64 THE MUSIC. SUPERVISOR 
For we are constantly projecting that which 
is within us and it persistently comes back to us, 
being our bread cast upon the waters. 
There can be no such thing in education 
therefore as a non-progressive teacher. Onclose 
examination we find that there is always motion, 
one way or the other. Either there is motion 
out into the crescendo of useful living, or a 
fading away into the diminuendo of withdrawal 
from utilitarian service. In any case the 
teacher stands before his class and it sends back 
to him (reflects upon him) exactly what he 
gives forth. It is to his purpose, then, to send 
forth in the fulness of his power.
-P-A-G-E-65
CHAPTER VI 
Music 1n Epucation 
L 
Education—in the present day at least—is a 
truly complex affair. In the details of its pro- 
gram it may be said to succeed when it brings 
us to an understanding of our material and gives 
us command over it. 
Does public school music enjoy the practical 
distinction of being so presented that children 
understand to a degree what it means, and do 
they gain command over it as material? 
The reply to this question must be: Yes, more 
or less. In some cities and towns music is 
taught as definitely and as thoroughly as any 
other subject is. It has recently been stated 
that in one normal school there are twenty or 
more students who have elected to continue 
their music study as professional attainment. 
That is, they have followed it through the grades 
to the high school, and into the normal school, 
with such response to it and with such command 
of it that it appeals to them as a desirable vo- 
cation. 
When we stop to consider what there is to be 
said about music as a subject of educational 
value we discover at once that it offers just as 
65
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
great opportunity as any other subject does for 
the acquirement of information; and that be- 
yond this it demands infinitely more than most 
subjects do for the expression of its meaning. 
It even surpasses the art of reading literature 
in this respect. 
That it requires great art to read these lines 
of Goethe no one will gainsay: 
Sah ein Knab’ ein RGslein steh’n, 
RGslein auf der Heiden, 
War so jung und morgenschén 
Lief er schnell, es nah zu seh’n. 
Sah’s mit vielen Freuden, 
Réslein, réslein, réslein rot, 
Roslein auf der Heiden. 
But let a Schubert set this to music and im- 
mediately there is demanded for its adequate 
presentation a degree of skill that is immeasur- 
ably greater and rarer than the skill ofthereader.

  MUSIC IN EDUCATION 67 
It should scarcely be necessary to go beyond 
this single statement to justify music as a sub- 
ject in the school curriculum. Its perpetua! 
demand for broader and deeper refinement in 
the act of self-expression which is, after all, but 
self-realization, gives it at once a supreme im- 
portance as a subject of training and attain- 
ment. As we go on in our practice of music it 
continues to demand more and more of us—more 
in the refinement of methods of doing, more of 
depth and sincerity in expression. So it builds 
us bit by bit into a rarer individuality, because 
it is continually drawing upon the depth of the 
self for adequate interpretation. 
The acquirement of correct Spelling makes 
an exact thinker, but not necessarily a refined 
one. All the processes connected with learning 
Geography, varied and vivid as they are, may 
go on year after year without awakening any 
depth of feeling, without stimulating to any per- 
ceptible degree the desire for self-expression. 
The reading of the masterpieces of literature, as 
we have instanced above with the lovely lines 
of Goethe, should accomplish this in a degree. 
And yet many of us pass through the experience 
of studying literary forms and types without 
developing a sense, much less a skill, for ade- 
quate literary expression and appreciation. 
Even after so many years of the practice of 
public school music, its individual \ alue and its 
association values with other school studies are    
  
-P-A-G-E-68
68 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
by no means fixed. Educators do not agree 
that its place in the curriculum is definite. 
Many reasons may be given for this. Its value 
as a knowledge subject is not clear. Its place 
as a skill and training subject is no more so; and 
finally its unique value in requiring the physical 
body to become a delicate instrument, obedient 
to the direction of the mind in the production 
of a beautiful art message, is scarcely guessed 
at as a possibility. Supervisors are aware that 
in music there is found all the necessary material 
that makes for the acquirement of information, 
that is, the gaining of knowledge; and with 
some opportunity the potentiality that any 
other subject offers for what we have chosen to 
call refinement of self-expression. 
Naturally, the term music implies much, and 
the term musician no less. But in its applica- 
tion to the public schools music must aim: to 
provide opportunity for the attainment of 
knowledge, as a by-product resulting from a 
developing skill in interpretation. And for 
these purposes: The knowledge must, as in all 
other subjects, make for skill in interpretation; 
skill in interpretation must_make for expanding 
self-expression; self-expression must take many 
forms: silent reading, singing, writing, the abil- 
ity to grasp the meaning from the printed page, 
and the complementary power of expressing 
one’s own meaning in the symbols of the printed 
page with convincing definiteness. 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  IC IN EDUCA’ 3 MUSIC IN EDUCATION 69 
So studied, to practical ends, music not only 
enriches life, but it permits, perhaps better than 
any other subject does, social application.” It 
is the only possible community activity in art 
that does not allow the participant to sit quietly 
by himself meditating upon his individual 
states of being. \ 
a I. 
The history of music points out, and science 
corroborates the historian, that singing is an 
instinctive human impulse. This instinct, let 
it be noted, seeks expression in activity, in a 
manner more fundamentally natural perhaps 
than speech itself. And it is upon this instinc- 
tive craving in the human being to express him- 
self in song that the claims of music for educa- 
tional recognition must be based, and that 
without fear, favor, or apology. The inference 
is clear that to a degree it is possible to reach 
the art side of the child’s nature from its ad- 
vent into the school by making him at once the 
master of the process, which applied to his own 
physical body (as the instrument) produces the 
artistic result. 
Those who have witnessed the singing of 
school children at Carnegie Hall, New York, 
under Dr. Frank Damrosch, at the Cincinnati 
May Festival, and elsewhere, where community 
music has gained an established footing, will 
readily distinguish the factors just indicated. 
To set them forth in order:
-P-A-G-E-70
ee eee eae 
70 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
1. The children have, by training and study, 
learned an art. 
2. They have mastered the process of voic- 
ing it. 
3. The intellectual mastery, expressed by 
the body, produces an artistic result. 
4. In this expression the physical body is . 
the musical instrument, and the indwelling 
spiritual self is the performer. 
Music as educational activity is seen to be, 
in this illustration, of far-reaching influence. It 
demands fine discrimination, in tone, in shading, 
and in quality; it demands an adequate memory, 
often exercised on a complex and involved 
whole; it demands a degree of accuracy in per- 
formance that is comparable for exactness with 
nothing less than an involved mathematical 
operation; and beyond the operation it forever 
makes for the artistic form. it demands self- 
control, self-government to a degree that no 
other art can approach. Every physical pro- 
cess, breathing, enunciation, tone control, tone 
gradation, are forever required to be brought 
under a degree of centralization in order that an 
immediate and perfect response may be realized. 
But music is not alone artistic singing, with 
proper physical control. We have already in- 
dicated that the word music implies a complex; 
the word musician no less a complex. When we 
stop for a moment to enumerate the more obvi- 
ous social alignments that have come from music 
   
-P-A-G-E-71
MUSIC IN EDUCATION a 
in a comparatively short time, we see that its 
two-fold aspects (a) Social, (6) Professional, reach 
into the very heart of our national life. Hence, 
every fact about music that a child learns, every 
bit of skill he gains in the practice of it, brings 
him into closer relation with the society of which 
he is a part. 
Let us map even roughly (a) the Social, (6) the 
Professional phases of music. 
(a) SOCIAL l/ 
The symphony orchestra, the oratorio society, 
the choral club, the community chorus, the 
town band, the amateur orchestra, church 
music (choir, chorus, quartet, soloist, organ- 
ist), the instrumental trio and quartet, the 
theatre orchestra, the opera company. 
(b) PROFESSIONAL 
The conductor, the violinist and player of other 
string instruments, the pianist, organist, wind 
instrument player (horn, cornet, tuba, etc.), 
woodwind players (flute, oboe, clarinet, bas- 
soon), harpist, vocalist, music supervisor, choir 
director, theorist, historian, writer on music 
education, aesthetics. 
These lists aim not at the complete represen- 
tation of what music is in social and professional 
life. They are merely suggestive of music’s 
contingency; they show some of its points of 
contact with life. Whether the child study 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  72 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
music ultimately from the love of it as an avo- 
cation or as subject matter for actual profes- 
sional life, it offers him the opportunity of enter- 
ing into the life of his times through many 
doorways. It makes him socially capable of a 
refined form of service. In brief, it augments 
him. One need only compare this range of 
possible activities through music with what is 
offered by any of the other subjects of the edu- 
cational curriculum to be convinced that while 
they are all useful and necessary, music, more 
than any one of them, is not only quite as neces- 
sary, but more exacting in its demands, more 
insistent upon a high standard of attainment; 
hence the bestowerof greater skilland perception. 
Usually this insistent demand of music for the 
unyielding standard is cverlooked or not taken 
into account. We have but to think for a mo- 
ment to realize that if music in school could be 
presented, studied, and attained to one hundred 
per cent of efficient results, it would contribute 
more to the child’s control and use of his own 
power than any thing else he learns. But it is 
difficult so to present it; hence we are prone to 
view it, to estimate its value from the results we 
obtain through a low percentage of efficiency; so 
yielding to the Little while the Great lies near 
our hand. “ 
Let us, in conclusion, see what some educators 
and musicians have felt to be the truth in respect 
of the place of music in the social life of our
-P-A-G-E-73
MUSIC IN EDUCATION 73 
times which life, a few years hence, must be 
assumed and portrayed by the children of today. 
This fact makes it momentous that we provide 
them with Ideals, at once the most practical 
and attractive; these are inevitable standards. 
In arrecent issue of The Craftsman, Dr. Ernst 
Kunwald, conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony 
Orchestra, said: 
“I believe that the way for America to 
become a musical nation is for all the people, 
young and old, rich and poor, to wish to play 
good music. ) 
“When you play music yourself, serious 
music, chamber music, you at once become a 
better listener, because the best music, the 
music that has been taken from the rich store- 
house of the genius of the world must be under- 
stood, it must be studied, and the way to study 
a thing is along the line of perfecting yourself 
in it. The more you study music, the more 
cultivated your mind becomes, and the more 
you play classical music, the more you realize 
all its variations, its difficulties, its power, the 
inspiration which gave birth to it and the joy 
which its production must forever give the 
world. 
“TI find the interest in music in the Cin- 
cinnati public schools is growing daily. I am 
one of the advisory committee in public schools 
on musical matters. I see the school people 
and the school children are very much interested 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
in having me superintend their orchestra work, 
and pupils from these classes come to our after- 
noon concerts regularly. For the social com- 
munity also I feel that such musical work as 
we are doing is important. It must of neces- 
sity heighten the standard of culture. If people 
want good music and have it, and grow to un- 
derstand it, love it, and play it, they will inevi- 
tably feel the urge for finer art and painting and 
sculpture. They will want more intelligent 
dramatic presentations, they will want the 
truer and better home architecture. In other 
words, is not all art impulse one and the same 
desire for beauty, only flowing out through dif- 
ferent channels, so that if it is cultivated along 
one line it is bound to seek the various outlets 
that are essential to it? 
“And artistically, too, I believe that for 
a city to be a musical center must be a valuable 
and significant thing for the civic growth and 
improvement.” 
And in conclusion, let an American educator, 
Dr. A. E. Winship, editor of the Journal of 
Education, in whose heart American education 
has first place, say what he thinks of the prac- 
tical value of music: 
“We must, first, last, and all the time insist 
that music is an educational essential, not to 
be neglected by the teacher because other school 
activities are more insistent, not to be aban- 
doned because the tax-payer’s pocket squeals. 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  MUSIC IN EDUCATION 15 
“Music is as real in its service to humanity as 
the multiplication table. 
“Why does a boy whistle when he needs heart? 
“Why did the soldier boys sing Dixie or March- 
ing through Georgia when there was danger of 
over-much thinking of Home, Sweet Home, or ot 
the morrow’s picture of the carnage? 
“Why doesn’t the boy repeat the multipli- 
cation table? Why didn’t the soldiers have 
a spelling match? 
“When you need music you need it more than 
you need the list of irregular verbs. 
“Why has every evangelist had his Sankey, 
Alexander, or Excell to warm up the audience 
until the blood tingled and thrilled like the 
springtime sentiment of youth? Why not start 
a revival with a recitation of definitions? 
“Why do wedding bells chime joyous music 
in the happiest hour of a girl’s life? 
“Why are social reformers so afraid of the 
cabaret? Why is it that music sets the brain 
a-whirling, the heart a-thumping, the feet a- 
going? 
“Why is it that music possesses the soul of 
most people as nothing else does? Is it because 
it is a non-essential, a side issue, a trifling inci- 
dent in one’s life? Is it so unimportant in 
life, in war and politics, in love and religion, that 
it has no place in education? = 
{, “For good or ill, music is one of the greatest — 
forces in life, individually and collectively.

-P-A-G-E-76
76 THE MUSIC SUPERVIGOR 
“All pretense to educate without music is like 
pretending to be rapturously happy while wrink- 
ling the face with scowls and frowns and clogging 
the voice with wrath or hate. 
(“Music is the smile of education smoothing 
out frowns, giving dimples in place of wrinkles, 
rippling, echoing tones in place of curses. ) 
“All our troubles have come from mistaking 
scholarship for education, from putting know- 
ing above thinking, doing, and feeling. 
“Above a college gateway is this warning: 
‘He who reads and reads 
And does not what he knows 
Is he who plows and plows 
And never sows.’ 
“There is no education in scholarship except 
as it is used to educate. 
“Education is adjustment to life, adjustment 
to new problems, adjustment to the morrow 
instead of the yesterday. 
“Music when rightly taught and practised gets 
into the life of boys and girls and stays there 
into manhood and womanhood as does nothing 
else in the school. 
“Music has not had adequate recognition 
because some people do not sing or play the 
violin. We have been too ready to assume 
that the schools should do nothing for any child
-P-A-G-E-77
MUSIC IN EDUCATION 17 
that it does not do for all children. We have 
broken down that barrier in all industrial lines 
but we have made slight concession as relates 
to music. , 
“Rhythm is for all children.) No youth is 
such a blunderer that he will not soon learn 
to keep step if he is in a military company. No 
normal child is incapable of getting the beauty 
and the physical and mental effect of rhythm. 
“There are few who cannot get all the benefit 
of melody, at least in appreciation thereof. No 
soldier escapes the effect of Dixie or The Battle 
Hyman of the Republic. No one in a revival ser- 
vice fails to get the magic of the melody of the 
revival songs. 
“Not all will get the intellectual stimulus of 
harmony but there will be as many children 
who get the personal advantage of harmony 
in music as of the artistic effect of a master- 
piece in poetry, and more than will get any 
sense of the essayist’s art. We insist upon the 
study of English literature in every grade from 
the first grade to high school graduation by 
every child, knowing that to some it is only the 
rhythm and the melody that appeal to them. 
There is as much profitintellectually and morally 
and more aesthetically in the study of rhythm, 
melody, and harmony in music than in lan- 
age.” 
Forever, in life, we find ourselves attempting 
to decide between the useful and the beautiful. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
It is a strange temptation; it is strange that we 
find any temptation whatever in it. We need 
to know, as an ever-present knowledge-asset, 
that the beautiful is exactly as useful as the 
useful itself. There is just as much actual need 
in the life of every one of us for music, pictures, 
poetry, and drama as there is for little figuring 
(that we may do business with the butcher) or 
a little talking (that we may buy coffee and tea 
of the grocer). 
It is a question if in the daily life of many, 
even today, there is not more evidence of the 
vitalizing purpose of music than there is of 
geography or of mathematics. Have you, 
reader, hummed a tune today? Or have you 
found happiness in the multiplication table, or 
in repeating to yourself the number of ounces 
to a pound? ©

  CHAPTER VII 
Tue Erricient AssIGNMENT 
5 
The one single factor of institutional activity 
which contributes enormously to its ultimate 
success is the principle known as the Efficient 
Assignment of work. This demands that those 
who establish the Ideal of an institution must 
be able to assign specific tasks to every co- 
worker, so definitely that the desired end is 
directly approached in each single effort. Thus 
there comes forward for our consideration the 
subject of the Efficient Assignment. The Su- 
pervisor will perceive that while theartof assign- 
ment is a distinct factor in efficiency, it really 
involves other factors, which in turn demand 
to be efficient, or confusion results. 
The one desirable characteristic of assign- 
ment is that it shall be clear. To be clear it 
must issue from a central source or authority 
which knows thoroughly the whole work to be 
accomplished, and the value to the whole of 
each single contributive act. The Supervisor 
will find, then, that his work will prosper ex- 
actly in proportion as he determines these 
things and establishes them as his platform: 
1. The total accomplishment in music, which 
79
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
consummates in the highest grade of the school 
system. 
2. The specific accomplishment for each 
grade leading stepwise to the highest grade of 
the system. 
8. The necessary distribution of work to 
assure the grade by grade accomplishment. 
4. The individual effort of the grade teacher 
making directly toward the Ideal of the whole. 
5. The individual task or effort of the grade 
teacher proceeding from an assignment made 
with the greatest accuracy by the Supervisor. 
The Efficient Assignment then, involves a 
central authority (in this case, the Supervisor) 
who, having determined what is to be done, is 
able to direct all contributory effort into the 
main stream flowing toward the Ideal. This 
desirable state of affairs is impossible to a be- 
ginner. He soon discovers that we have to 
Do things—and todo them for a long time before 
we begin to Know. In brief, knowledge fol- 
lows upon action. He will probably establish 
the full round of his purpose in the school system 
only after a year or several years of investiga- 
tion and experiment. It is perfectly easy, how- 
ever, to recognize, in the work of the Supervisor 
or of his grade teachers, whether the recitation 
in hand is contributing its portion toward a well 
organized plan, or whether it is merely the 
momentary activity involved in disposing of a 
disagreeable task, recurrent and inevitable.
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE EFFICIENT ASSIGNMENT 81 
For a hasty comparison we may say that the 
one is a brick laid carefully by a master mason 
in exactly its right place in the building, as 
called for by the architect’s plan. The other 
is merely a stray brick. No one has made a 
plan involving it, no one has established a place 
for it. 
Let us consider the subject of the Efficient 
Assignment by reviewing the factors that must 
enter into and inspire each individual lesson 
in music. The following list of questions and 
suggestions should furnish the Supervisor with 
means for checking up his plan of work, or for 
suggesting one if he has not yet formulated 
at. 
It should be kept in mind that every list of 
queries such as this, aiming to secure informa- 
tion, should be worked out with scientific 
accuracy. 
1. To what end am I teaching music in the 
public schools? 
2. What shall a boy or girl who progresses 
through all the grades be able to do in music on 
final graduation? 
(This Ideal for the individual makes the Ideal 
for the mass.) 
8. Number of pupils of the first year in 
school? Number of teachers for this grade? 
4. Specific program for the first year in 
music. (For this first year in school, the Super- 
visor plus the first year teachers constitute the
-P-A-G-E-82
  82 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
music faculty. Their united work must lead 
directly to the purposes that justify music in 
the graduating year of the high school.) 
5. In like manner, for each year in school; 
number of pupils, number of teachers (as music 
faculty). 
6. At first the Supervisor will determine in 
a general way his plan and intention for the de- 
velopment of music. But he will begin at once 
to fix, bit by bit, the program for each year as 
it is inspired by the whole range of work. 
7. Is every member of the music faculty 
for any specific year in school a thoroughly 
capable assistant? 
8. If not, what may I do to make the grade 
teacher capable to carry on the work in music 
that I am planning for this system of schools? 
9. What is the logical equipment necessary 
for each grade in books, charts, and other 
material? 
10. Is this equipment in efficient condition 
and so positioned that it may be handled with 
the least cost in time and energy? 
11. What system governs the care and 
handling of the music equipment? 
12. What is the total number of minutes a 
week devoted to music in the grades? What 
does the handling of material cost; that is, 
books on desks, books put away, charts made 
ready, charts put away, blackboard space made 
ready; in brief, a totally efficient preparation ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE EFFICIENT ASSIGNMENT 83 
Subtract this total number of minutes from 
the week’s total. The amount of time given 
to musicis generally complained of as too small; 
but if efficiently conserved and handled, it 
should be found ample. As a matter of 
fact twelve minutes a day for actual work, or 
sixty minutes a week, aggregate about forty 
hours a year. This is equivalent to eighty 
half-hour lessons, an amount as great as the 
average allowance in any one subject in music 
for a private or conservatory music student 
who aims, probably, at professional attainment. 
Let us plan or outline the situation as we 
have suggested:

no one of these outlines is worth a moment’s
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
time or trouble unless the Supervisor is forever 
at work on the curriculum as a whole. And 
about this matter a word or two. 
It is not enough that the pupils constituting 
the entire school system shall be run through a 
series of text-books. The principal idea under- 
lying all school music effort is individual attain- 
ment. What is the ultimate object for a pupil 
who, beginning at the age of six, attends every 
grade in order and graduates from the high 
school at the age of eighteen? Is it to read 
music? God forbid, as the Pagan philosopher 
used to exclaim. Is it to write little tunes? 
No. But it is to attain, year by year, a keen 
and sensitive appreciation for music through 
the skilful guidance of those who know how to 
arouse and develop a love for the art. There 
is work to do, there are hard problems to solve. 
The way is not easy; sight reading, music writ- 
ing, part-singing, dictation, and all the rest of 
that merry company are but contributory assets, 
making a desirable objective— that is, making 
it by having produced it. And yet, how often 
do we take our eyes from our goal and actually 
forget it in these details. 
Now a Supervisor may continue in one place 
for twenty-five years and for the entire period 
be able constantly to perfect his plan as a whole. 
Indeed, he might stay on a century, did life per- 
mit, and still keep on modifying and improving 
that sum total of plan from his constantly grow-
-P-A-G-E-85
    THE EFFICIENT ASSIGNMENT 85 
ing perception of its purposes. He should 
know before he begins that he is building an 
Ideal which is definite only as viewed moment 
by moment. Its definiteness is that of a growing 
tree to the eye, that cannot possibly be per- 
ceived in the act of growth which reason says is 
actually taking place before it. The old proverb 
tells us, “happy is the tired traveler who has 
a destination.” We may apply this to the 
teacher. And happy again is he who, having 
reached the Inn at night, knows that there are 
still countless destinations ahead. The true 
teacher isa traveler ever making for farther and 
farther goals. 
Supervisors have adopted various means for 
making assignments definite. Before the Super- 
visor determines to adopt any one form, let him 
take thought that he must, first of all, determine 
upon proper assignments to himself. The pre- 
ceding list of questions suggests somewhat the 
nature of such assignment in broader lines. In 
the conduct of his weekly and daily program 
the Supervisor’s assignment to himself should 
beas definite and asinflexible as experience justi- 
fies. Thus, for example: 
WEEK OF MAY IST 
1. Schools to be visited, schedule for each 
room, day by day. 
2. Appointments necessary with teachers 
in groups or individually.
-P-A-G-E-86
    86 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
8. As each classroom is entered ask for the 
assignment card left with the grade teacher on 
the previous visit. 
4. Has the full assignment been accom- 
plished? With satisfactory results? Is the 
teacher up on all the work? Does she show 
incapacity in any item? What assistance does 
she need? 
5. Make out and leave new assignment slip. 
The purpose of this is to place in the hands of 
the grade teacher a positively definitestatement 
of the direction the ship is to take for the week 
to come. With a skilled teacher the details of 
sailing may be left as unspecified asthe Super- 
visor’s experience deems wise. 
Another matter which should interest the 
Supervisor is this: He shouldroutehis own work 
so that the efficiency principles of plans, sched- 
ules, standardized conditions and operations, and 
despatch shall be regulated. Reverting to our 
suggestion of Chapter I in regard to mapping 
the town, it may be said now that this operation 
should reveal the best, easiest, and most direct 
way for getting about town so as to save time, 
energy, and motion. The Supervisor’s trans- 
portation problem for the five days of school 
demands the most careful consideration. No 
needless step should be permitted to consume 
the precious moments of the working day. 
When we contemplate the comparatively small 
number of hours during which we can work 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE EFFICIENT ASSIGNMENT 87 
intensely and compare the number with one 
hundred and sixty-eight, or the total number 
of hours in a week, we are amazed at the time 
cost of sleep, meals, routine, and waste. 
I. 
In conclusion, a few paragraphs on Assign- 
ment as a general efficiency principle may be, 
at least, suggestive: 
Automobile road books and European trav- 
elers’ guides are often among the best types of 
efficiently prepared and published information. 
They aim to convey, in the clearest possible 
manner, exactly what the reader wishes and 
needs to know. 
But to whatever extent a book is unclear, in- 
accurate, hazy, and indefinite, to that extent 
it fails to serve. It follows upon this that people 
will not buy an article that becomes known to 
be under one hundred per cent trustworthy, 
accurate, and dependable. Hence the business 
possible for such a thing begins to fall off. 
But given a thoroughly reliable article, as 
trustworthy as human ingenuity can make it, 
and the business possible for it will steadily in- 
crease. 
Here, THEN, are presented two conditions and 
two apparently inevitable consequences: 
1. We start toward our public with a one 
hundred per cent efficient article that the public
-P-A-G-E-88
ee Ee ee ee SET Ye ae Ee eh ee 
88 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
needs and it will come smiling to meet us. It 
wants what we have. It may be a book, a ser- 
mon, or a song. 
2. We start toward our public with an arti- 
cle that is needed, but which, as we offer it, does 
not exactly serve its purposes. In a little while 
the public will turn around and run away from 
us. 
Perhaps then we may conclude that: 
An efficient article, efficiently delivered, will 
yield the salesman (he may be merchant, preach- 
er, or teacher) the maximum possible efficient 
reward. 
Let us try this out in a few familiar appli- 
cations: 
1. The housewife who knows exactly what 
she wants done, who knows exactly how it 
should be done, and how to convey directions 
and information to her maid, will inevitably suc- 
ceed in getting it done. 
And, conversely, the housewife who does not 
know exactly what she wants done, who cannot 
do it herself, and who cannot give explicit direc- 
tions, changes service frequently. She is help- 
less because she is a worthless exemplar. 
2. Widespread, indeed, is the belief in the 
efficiency principle which tells us, that a com- 
petent Counselor is best, even though his ser- 
vices are costly. This is the efficiency principle 
which justifies the addition of the Supervisor 
in music, to the municipal list of school officers.
-P-A-G-E-89
  
  THE EFFICIENT ASSIGNMENT 89 
He is the best, easiest, and quickest way to 
those things in music most desirable for the 
child to carry forward into life. 
It is inevitable that much poor teaching must 
be charged to the lack of care on the part of 
supervising teachers and others in making exact 
work requirements; and from failing to specify 
the process by which work is to be done. 
However much the Supervisor may be in- 
clined to think that it is the grade teacher’s 
business to listen to directions, it will be forced 
upon him in time that in all work assignment 
he must reckon upon a certain amount of inertia 
on the part of the listener. 
There are teachers and pupils to whom no 
one can sell inefficiency of assignment in great 
quantities. Like the needle they always point 
true north. 
But they are not over-many and their capa- 
city to orientate themselves is so uncommon that 
it need not be reckoned with here. What we 
have to consider in theschool-roomis the average 
teacher with a class of average pupils. We 
must inquire about this teacher before we 
assume any definite attitude: 
1. Is she capable of holding to enthusiasm? 
2. Is she likely to exercise one hundred per- 
cent of attention when spoken to? 
8. Or, does she fail to an appreciable degree 
to take in what is said to her? 
The music assignment often reaches the 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  90 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
teacher as a totally unfamiliar group of ideas. 
To appreciate this the Supervisor might con- 
duct with himself such an experiment as this: 
Let him undertake to prepare himself to give 
a lecture on the Nature and Use of Carbo- 
hydrates. Let him secure oral instruction and 
compare in himself the results in terms of frame 
of mind with the attitude of the grade teacher 
when he gives her a complex music assignment.

L * 
No one accustomed to dealing with the limi- 
tations of the average human being can view 
the daily task of a grade teacher in the public 
schools with ‘anything less than genuine amaze- 
ment and deep-felt emotion. Let us observe 
the immediately necessary reaction on her part 
to the demands that are made upon her by her 
superior officers, always in the calm assurance 
that she will rise to the occasion and not fail 
them. In truth, she rises to these demands so 
reliably and so faithfully that we are in danger 
of forgetting that she is only a human being. 
Let us see what she must be, must know, and 
be able to do. 
She must be forever true to her calling, re- 
fined of mind, of manner, of speech, and of ap- 
pearance. She must be inspired by an ideal 
of life that sets her standard high. She must 
be forever so true to her ideal that she is always 
abreast of her standard. Of habit, attire, and 
personal conduct she must be not only above 
reproach, but an ever-present model of perfec- 
tion that never varies. She must evince, under 
actual test of circumstances, these qualities: 
91
-P-A-G-E-92
  92 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
Tact, patience, affability, care, forethought, 
kindness, sympathy, perspicacity, happiness, 
faith, trust, optimism, good nature, cheerfulness, 
health, strength, endurance, dependability, re- 
liability, responsibility, honesty, truth, a clear 
eye, and a perfect digestion. 
Further, she must teach in one day to the 
future well-being of her children, to the satis- 
faction of her Superintendent and supervising 
teachers, and to her own mental and spiritual 
contentment: 
Arithmetic, Geography, Penmanship, Gram- 
mar, History, Music, Reading, Spelling, Con- 
duct, Ethics, Cleanliness, and special subjects 
now and again not a few. 
She must begin this round of amazing diver- 
sity of applied skill in a fresh and vigorous 
frame of mind at 9 A.M., and pause in the same 
sort of a frame of mind (or somebody will com- 
plain) at 4 P.M. She must then remain after 
school, transacting her necessary business, and 
prepare to take home for the evening hours a 
full equipment of work. 
She must do this forty weeks in the year for 
a salary that makes her dreams about the pro- 
visions of old age of a kind she dares not enter- 
tain in the day time. \ Indeed, we may profit- 
ably pause for a moment to view her emolu- 
ments and to wonder whether she ever wishes 
that she could have been made by fate a car- 
penter or a plasterer, a policeman or a fireman.

Perhaps we have troubled ourselves too far 
to view the intimate affairs of the grade teacher. 
The Supervisor disclaims any interest in the 
preceding statements and demands the teacher’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-94

94 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
perfect co-operation with him so far as the re- 
quired music study of the grade is concerned. 
She will co-operate. But first she asks, and quite 
appropriately: What am I to do? How shall I ’ 
learn to doit? (For, let us remember, she does 
not alwaysxemerge a perfectly equipped music 
teacher from the normal school.) =~<———— 
Her questions are fair and should be enter- 
tained. She is to teach music, let us assume, 
in the third grade, from September to June, and 
under the direction of the Supervisor. She 
must conduct the class satisfactorily through 
the curriculum of books, charts, song literature, 
music writing, dictation, and the like. Once in 
a while she is supervised. Perhaps ninety per- 
cent of all recitations are left to her and her own 
resources. And she wants to know what must 
be her equipment with which to accomplish all 
this. And in reply the Supervisor states it as 
follows: ; 
\ 1. Everything we have already alleged of 
her as a grade teacher. 
2. A pleasing voice. 
8. A repertoire (perhaps) of rote songs, or 
art songs, or of both. 
4. The ability to sing pleasingly. 
5. To enunciate English words perfectly. 
6. To sing in tune. 
7. To teach the class all these attainments, 
meanwhile keeping them up to pitch, and 
maintaining a high degree of conduct.
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE GRADE TEACHER’S EQUIPMENT 95 
8. To interpret a song as model lesson with 
fair artistic skill and perception. 
9. To be sensitive to the individual and class 
voice quality and to know how to repress harsh, 
raucous singing. 
10. To work up a song repertoire. 
11. To know how to keep material so that 
it may be handled with the least cost of time. 
12. To have grasped what the Supervisor’s 
aim is relative to music throughout the school 
system. 
13. To know the nature of the contribution 
of her grade to the whole. 
14. And particularly to know rather inti- 
mately the scope of music work in the grade 
below and in the grade above her own. 
15. Then the technic of the problems which 
are required by the music text-books of her 
grade add the finishing touch to her omniscience. 
They are Sight Reading, Dictation, Enunciation, 
Music Writing, Voice Training, Art Singing, 
Song Interpretation, Vocal Drill; occasionally 
varied by exhibitions to visitors, school concerts, 
and preparation for community singing. 
We trust the Supervisor is not impatient at 
the presentation of this detail; we beg to assure 
him that it is not by any means a complete 
presentation. Furthermore, we may assure 
him that with co-operation on his part, with 
definite assignments for class work, with help- 
ful suggestions for the development of her own
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
individual skill in music, the grade teacher will 
go quietly about her amazing business ande 
gradually become a skilled and dependable as- 
sistant in music. 
But, to this end, and to which she will in- 
variably lend her energy most. assiduously, 
earnestly, and cheerfully, she needs and must 
receive proper guidance. Speaking at a meet- 
ing of the New York State Teachers’ Association, 
J. M. Thompson, Principal of the State Normal 
School at Potsdam, said: 
“Tt must be evident to anyone who looks into 
the situation carefully that the function of 
music in the public schools is such that we can- 
\, notexpect the best results until each grade teach- 
er can teach the music of her grade. It is a 
' fairly reasonable proposition in school adminis- 
tration that the mass of average children should 
not be asked to learn what the average teacher 
is not able to teach. The teaching of music by 
a special teacher creates the impression that it 
is so different from the other subjects of the 
school that only gifted individuals may become 
proficient in it. Such teaching is apt to lack 
one of the essential conditions necessary to good 
teaching, namely, the stimulus of hope. (The 
permanent, progressive aim of the normal school 
therefore should be to produce a teacher who 
can teach the music of her grade, and the first 
step in this direction is a firm belief that it can 
be done; a more general acceptance of the truth 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE GRADE TEACHER’S EQUIPMENT 97 
that musical ability is inherent in the average 
individual, that it is a part of his inheritance 
too valuable to be neglected and too vital to be 
overlooked.” 
There is scarcely a fraction of one per cent of 
grade teachers who, with proper help and en- 
couragement, cannot adequately handle the 
music ofthegrade. The teacher must be taught 
to do not alone the work of the children of her 
grade, but she should be familiar with just 
a little more, below it and above it. In fact, 
without undue addition to the extent of respon- 
_ sibility she already carries, the grade teacher 
who masters the entire scope of music for the first 
three years at school, will possess (in it) a foun- 
dation for the work of any specific grade. This 
fundamental knowledge will serve her in any 
emergency. As a minimum of requirement 
plus familiarity with the problems of her own 
particular grade, it would give her light upon 
every question that arises in her musical ex- 
perience. 
There is one aspect of grade music that is 
never touched upon in the limited literature of 
the subject found in the Association reports. I 
refer to the appreciation by teacher and pupils 
of the music they sing day by day. One feels 
at times that we are in danger of forgetting 
about the valuable hours in music with which 
the grades provide us, as we run off at top speed 
toward the high school in pursuit of courses of 
=p,
-P-A-G-E-98
  | while in high school unless it has been amply 
‘teaching of the first rote song. It must inspire 98 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
appreciation in instrumental music, the study 
of the symphony, the building of the orchestra, 
and the like. None of these things is worth 
prepared for and carefully worked up from the 
first year in school. We are learning to dis- 
tinguish among Supervisors those who are weak 
in every requirement of the grades, and given to 
over-emphasis of what we may call the pub- 
licity features possible in the high school. 
Music appreciation is no study for the high 
school exclusively. It properly begins with the 
the singing of the scale, down or up, as youmay 
prefer. It must put sunshine into exercises for 
one voice, two voices, or three voices. It must 
make vocal drills a pleasure, because it inspires 
the singer with a purpose and the beautiful ex- 
pression of it. 
We would have, therefore, the fundamental -   ‘gift of the grade teacher in music to be that love 
for its practice, enthusiasm for accomplishment 
init as an art of aesthetic expression. We would 
have her see that a boy of the toughest type 
who may be made to sing beautifully for a 
minute and a half or two minutes, is, in that 
period of time, no longer a tough boy, but atrue 
artist. She has only to increase the minutes of 
the art life to reduce those of the tough life. 
And herein is the whole power of music. 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  CHAPTER IX 
Tue CraDLE or GENIUS 
I. 
By nature and a strange twist in human 
credulity we favor all fortune tellers who deal 
with the future and with the remote. Readers of 
George Borrows’ Bible in Spain will appreciate 
the point when we recall his relation of the life 
and tragedy of the Swiss, Bernard Moll. 
Conversely, readers of Russell Conwell’s vivid 
story entitled Acres of Diamonds, no doubt ap- 
preciate (if they have not acquired) the habit 
‘of never looking afar for riches; but of seeking 
them under their own feet, at home, in their 
own yard, anywhere near at hand, but never 
in the future and the remote. 
Within the domain of our own labor we are 
poor futurists, because we are poor readers of 
the present, and so, not appreciative of the for- 
tune the present has for the future. We are 
strangely incapable of detecting the unusual 
in the commonplace. Therefore, in the class- 
room, often so dull and so familiar, we are poor 
readers. The human consignment of child- 
ren, to be coaxed into tractability for the ac- 
quirement of knowledge, is just an ever-present 
trouble to us. And yet, could we look back upon 
99
-P-A-G-E-100
  100 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
the hundreds of thousands of school-rooms of 
our country, say thirty years hence, we should 
then appreciate the truth that in these rooms 
there sits (now) all the genius with which our 
world will then be guided, governed, instruct- 
ed, and delighted. 
It is here, within these little ones who have so 
hard a time, even under our patient care, to 
adjust themselves and their private affairs to 
our rules, regulations, and curriculum. 
Here again, in the title of this chapter, is a 
turn in the road, that brings the Supervisor and 
his assistants face to face with their most con- 
siderable responsibility. It is not enough that 
the children shall be taught to sing after the 
dictates of the best course of study. But it is 
necessary above all things that some measure 
of the child’s gift of music be made as he passes 
swiftly from class to class. Among the mil- 
lions of children whom we are teaching today, 
is every genius of the generation that is to re- 
place our own. Who is watching for these 
geniuses? Are they slipping by us unnoticed? 
Shall it be said of us that, for years, we enter- 
tained a genius unawares? Perhaps the Super- 
visor may rebel at being made responsible for 
this; and yet would it not grieve him to realize 
that though a boy in his charge was gifted with 
the sacred fire, he, the Supervisor, never per- 
ceived its presence ; never helped to fan it into 
the life-giving flame? 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
    THE CRADLE OF GENIUS 101 
A remarkable thing about community music 
is not the music, not the community, but the 
latent power possessed by the people. There 
is a Sleeping Beauty in every class or group of 
human beings; not a sleeping individual beauty, 
but a spirit of beauty which may be individu- 
alized. Briefly, community music is a form of 
activity that discovers ability, trains it, liberates 
it, permits it to speak to the well-being of itself 
and the uplift of the neighbors. Music in the 
school-room must be no less potent a divining 
rod. With it in hand the Supervisor makes of 
it a magic wand, touching this one and that, 
awakening here a little response, there a greater 
response, and yet beyond perhaps a genius. 
The one will love music, another will make it, 
and the third will cause it to tell his countrymen 
universal secrets out of the very heart of himself. 
One may make his way day after day through 
the schools, the children grouping themselves 
about him as he passes, and yet never by word 
or sign shall he catch the secret of their souls; 
or again he may pass, heart and mind alert, de- 
tecting here a bit and there a bit more genius, 
and beckoning to it to turn its face to the East, 
the direction of all wise men. 
We urge, then, that the Supervisor shall 
watch and listen.. He is a planter whose seeds 
will sprout in their own good time and give the 
world their fruit in another generation. We 
urge upon him that he draw as near as possible 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  102 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
to the units of his class. Genius (like stupidity) 
is not of the mass until it is of the individual. 
There should be no fear of loading up oneself 
with detail. The man or woman who is afraid 
of the detail of work is not a worker, but a job- 
holder. Hence, it becomes desirable that we 
aim for more and more individual music work. 
It will give poise, self-reliance, self-control, and 
make for clear expression. It will accustom 
the young to confidence in doing a beautiful 
act. It will reveal the strength of individual 
talent. 
Here is a boy whose tone perception is good, 
his rhythmic sense reliable; he plays games with 
a sureness of control over his wholebody. His 
hands and fingers are supple and well formed. 
He will play a musical instrument admirably, 
possessing all the external signs of adaptability. 
But no one notes his equipment; no one, there- 
fore, translates it into terms of growth, making 
for deeper individual expression. So he goes 
forth into life tongue-tied where he could have 
been oratorical; lame when he could have run 
at marvelous speed. 
Why should this happen? Why should not 
every specialist in school strive with all his soul to 
become a clear and accurate reader of the future 
man and woman in the present boy and girl ? 
The world becomes, otherwise, a comedy of 
errors. Many a child entirely unfit by nature’s 
gifts to study music is kept at it, year after year,
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE CRADLE OF GENIUS 103 
to satisfy the ambition of someone who desires 
to make him a pianist. And the tragedy is, 
that there is no equipment for pianism present. 
But many another has starved to death for want 
of an opportunity to study music who could 
easily have satisfied the craving if someone had 
only detected the gift in the early years. 
Why do we fail to do these things? 
Because we are too aboundingly interested 
in ourselves, in our little affairs of income, in 
our self-indulgences, in our unprincipled desire 
to be entertained. We are too busy to go about 
trying to peer into a little child’s soul because 
the lamp of our own soul has ceased to shine. 
No, we say, the town does not pay me for 
that. 
The Supervisor who by skill and judgment 
can interest boys and girls in the study of music 
privately is a public benefactor. Boys particu- 
larly who master even to a small degree the 
mysteries of piano playing (or any other form 
of instrumental music) add a quality to life 
which sweetens it as the honey-locust sweeteus 
the summer air. Hence, it is to be desired that 
more boys study music not so much for what 
they may do with it as boys, but for its individ- 
ual and social value, when they become men. 
And not for its value to them alone even then, 
but for the influence that they, as musically 
developed men, will be in their own homes, in 
their clubs, societies, and business relations.
-P-A-G-E-104
104 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
The point is that a boy who has been faith- 
fully taught music and sympathetically led into 
the love of it will be, as a’ man, its best pub- 
licity agent. He will speak enthusiastically of 
it, urge it upon his community, and, best of all, 
he will be able to say why he advocates it. 
Many cases have come to our attention of 
young men who have studied music from boy- 
hood and who have formed chamber music or- 
ganizations. This form of music, like chorus 
singing, is one of the best. One finds, on in- 
quiry, that there is an amazing number of 
amateur chamber music organizations, but 
there are by no means enough of them yet; not 
until we have one in every half-score of fam- 
ilies shall we come near an adequate supply. 
Nor are there enough piano teachers who 
stimulate and cultivate in their pupils a love 
for ensemble playing. This is one of the best 
cultural social assets we can possess. 
Of course, there is again in this the tempta- 
tion of the few to attempt to entertain the 
many. In amateur orchestra practice and in 
chorus singing the many are engaged and are 
benefiting. Each is becoming more or less 
skilled as an expressive performer. In Germany 
the custom of playing ensemble music is wide- 
spread. Many a family has its quartet that per- 
forms regularly and enthusiastically to the 
everlasting betterment of its members and 
friends. Boys and young men taught thus to 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE CRADLE OF GENIUS 105 
seek their way into the best of music will end 
in loving music as it seeks its way into them, 
and so they will be forever its advocate. 
One may quite appropriately (because to the 
public benefit) advocate the closest community 
of music interests between the Supervisor and 
the private teacher of music. Do we find in 
the school-room four or five pupils who should 
study the piano? Then let the Supervisor be- 
come the master mason who builds the bridge 
for them across the river of Privation over into 
the abundant land of Opportunity. It should 
be the one supreme joy of his work to set these 
children captives free; free to soar on the wings 
of their talent the moment someone breaks for 
them the bars of the cage that imprison them; 
bars of Want, Blindness, Tradition, Custom, 
of Selfish looking-in instead of Spiritual looking- 
out. 
Is it usual, all this service work for the 
children? It is, unfortunately, only too com- 
mon a happening that we neglect the full round 
of service to children. Nevertheless, the ser- 
vice is our duty toward them. They are not 
to take from us merely the burdens we bear. 
We must first find for them the strength with 
which to bear all burdens. And for this there 
is no greater guarantee than the augmentation 
of the individuality. This gives depth for 
firm foundation and height for outlet. 
This detection and liberation of talent is the
-P-A-G-E-106
  THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 106 
broadest, deepest service that the Supervisor 
can contribute to his country, his people, and 
his times.
-P-A-G-E-107
CHAPTER X 
Community Music—Its PosstBitities 
Should the Supervisor attempt to carry his 
music work over into the community as a means 
for developing its latent musical capacity “as, 
in a high degreé;his-work-in schools devélops 
it in the town’s children? That is, shall he 
trouble himself to amplify his work? To take 
on a heavier burden? 
This proposition has been taken up, worked 
with, and prayed over by many an individual. 
Let us show in the pages to come how some of 
them have answered it and then let the Super- 
visor go and do as he thinks best for himself, 
as later on he looks back upon his work. 
First, what is the problem? 
All successful community work reflects the 
creative power and energy of a leader and in- 
vestigator. This person, by perceiving things 
“yet to be,” makes them possible. Individually 
we are (as community members) efficient; col- 
lectively, we establish a lower average; and yet 
that average is infinitely above what we think 
it is. 
The community leader to be of the most value 
must be able (1), to see possibilities, even when 
they are still deeply hidden in the shell; and 
107 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  108 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
(2), he must know how to make every possi- 
bility a concrete fact of accomplishment. His 
work is not only to dream dreams; he must in- 
terpret them and then set to work to make 
them come true. 
Community workers realize that scattered 
(separate) units of ability (players and singers, 
for example) have little influence as units but 
a surprising amount when they are organized. 
Unorganized talent is a loss exactly as pri- 
vately hoarded money is a loss. Both are un- 
economic. Until they are brought to a central 
place and made active from it they are dead. 
If a hundred thousand people have each saved 
ten dollars with which they refuse to part they 
are denying the world which supports them 
the use of a million dollars. Talent that does 
not find its way into circulation is a similar loss. 
And just as a hundred thousand ten dollar 
units earn more money when set to work as a 
concrete million, so talent (in one) combining 
with talent (in others) earns its increase. 
He was right who said: 
“Let me do my work well for then I may 
doit better; deny me the privilege of work and 
I can do nothing.” 
But often communities are slow to respond. 
The Prince must touch their eyes repeatedly. 
They become convinced of their own latent 
capacity only after much patient argument. 
An instance has come to our attention recently
-P-A-G-E-109
COMMUNITY MUSIC—ITS POSSIBILITIES 109 
of the working up of a pageant in a compara- 
tively small community. The most important 
and interesting part of the story is not what 
concerns the ultimate success of the undertaking 
but the conviction of practically everybody in 
town that the thing could not be done. We 
are not, they argued, that kind of people. But 
they had the pageant. And they had it — 
notice — because someone organized the people 
for a purpose; convinced them that they had 
the capacity, and then showed them how to 
make good. 
In every humble country town some sort of 
art expression lies latent, waiting to be awakened. 
The Greeks were skilled at this sort of thing, 
and their reputation for putting their belief into 
successful operation has persisted to this day. 
But we can conclude without any doubt in our 
minds that in every Greek community there 
was someone who went about making citizens 
do beautiful things. 
Have we no opportunity for such things? 
Here is what the organizer of the pageant above 
referred to says about the matter: 
“Our educational institutions have in their 
graduation exercises an excellent opportunity. 
Think of the thousands of high school students, 
more than one-half of them sweet and hardly 
twenty, sitting primly on the platform and 
reading essays on the conduct of men and things 
to the delight of parents, but to the ennui of 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  
  110 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
everyone else. True, such exercises have a 
slight trimming of music, but where is the pro- 
cession, the drama, and the true, hearty music? 
Think, O spirit of the Greeks, what youth 
and June have come to in our bookish educa- 
tion! Would it be less expressive of poise and 
self-control if the muslins and black frocks 
should perform a stately march and dance, 
showing by rhythmic movement and gesture, 
with songs and wreaths of flowers, the maturing 
for a still higher stage of activity? ” 
In these days of successful Corn Clubs, To- 
mato Canning Clubs, and the “ greatest num- 
ber of bushels to the acre” Clubs, let us be- 
think ourselves that all these corn, tomato, and 
vegetable specialists can sing, march, dance, 
wear costumes, give deep and reverent expres- 
sion to themselves in many a beautiful way. 
The dreadful thing about most communities 
is the absence of any centralizing influence that 
brings people together and through some 
special activity, such as chorus singing, enriches 
life. “Educators (a class in which all music 
teachers must take their stand), recognize that 
the very existence of the community lies ulti- 
mately in what boys and girls do with their 
spare time. Hence, community work is con- 
ceived and planned to use up spare time and to 
direct the energy that otherwise goes to waste 
in rowdyism, hoodlumism, and ultimately in 
crime. What we are trying to make evident 
ad
-P-A-G-E-111
  COMMUNITY MUSIC—ITS POSSIBILITIES lll 
here is this: Any music teacher, Supervisor, 
or private teacher, who will make careful study 
of how he can be of lasting profit to his com- 
munity, will find himself receiving several re- 
wards all at once. He will find that there will 
come to him: 
1. The joy of doing something really worth 
while and for somebody else. 
2. The wonderful satisfaction of working 
with many people for the good of all, instead of 
working solely for himself. 
8. The stimulating influence of Altruism, 
of finding all the joy in life by developing joy 
in other lives. 
And as if the biblical injunction were espe- 
cially directed to him, he will find that all other 
things will be added unto him. 
There. are scores of hundreds of communities 
in the United States that are accurately por- 
trayed in the following statement. Every one 
of such communities is a rich (potential) music 
center waiting for someone to go to work and 
make good. 
We are not seven, but ten thousand. 
Properly to educate, morally and otherwise, 
this ten thousand there are eight churches, six 
schools, two Camp Fire and one Boy Scout’s 
Clubs, a City Improvement Association, a 
Woman’s Club and another Woman’s Club, 
Equal Suffrage, and a Carnegie Library. For 
the pleasures of the gentlemen we have a Men’s
-P-A-G-E-112
  112 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
club, an Elk’s Hall, a Masonic Lodge, and to 
protect the men the labor organizations. 
This mass of people, I would say without 
hesitation, is fond of music. 
In some of the poorest homes one finds a 
phonograph and numbers of records. 
The mothers pinch and sacrifice to give their 
children music instruction; but unfortunately 
it ends there. 
Occasionally, when there is company, Mary 
may be invited to play, but the good old days 
when Mother sat down and sang with Mary 
and the others seem to be gone. The old plan- 
tation melodies, even Yankee Doodle and Amer- 
tca, are almost sealed secrets to the average 
child. 
We have seventeen hundred children in the 
schools. There is public school music but it 
does not do much. In the high school there 
is a glee club that rehearses one-half hour a 
week. No history of music is taught, no -bi- 
ography in any of the schools, and many of the 
children are so inattentive that they cannot 
tell the key, composer, or character of their 
pieces and songs. 
At times there have been efforts to start 
choral societies, but they “ peter out,”’ with the 
ambitious ones surveying a financial deficit; not 
an unusual termination to our efforts. 
We have a conservatory of music and several 
small orchestras that play the popular songs 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  
  COMMUNITY MUSIC—ITS POSSIBILITIES 113 
and some of the comic operas. Occasionally 
they perform one of the old overtures. 
The Italians across the track know their opera 
by heart, but we Americans cannot sing one 
line of anything good without being bored. 
Can you do something for us? It seems to 
me that it sifts down to too much hurry and 
lack of concentration. 
Now there is a man in Kansas* who has looked 
out over the broad acres of his state and has 
seen the hunger of the people for this art of 
music which Luther referred to as the gift of 
heaven. A description of his work in his own 
words is all that is needed to show its convincing 
superiority as an individual contribution to the 
spiritual possibilities of our times. 
You may be personally interested in some of 
the things we have done here in Emporia by 
way of inducing this and other communities to 
express themselves musically. 
A traveling Appreciation Course, consisting 
of a Talking Machine, and a dozen selected 
records has been journeying over the state of 
Kansas for three years. With this is sent a 
printed lecture, consisting of non-technical listen- 
ing hints and some interesting information 
relative to the selections played. The cost of 
transportation is the only expense connected 
with the lecture. This has been in constant 
demand by high schools, women’s clubs, and a

  114 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
number of sets have been necessary to meet the 
demand. We have followed this with other 
lectures, Folk-songs, Characteristic music of 
nations, Forms of vocal music, Orchestral in- 
struments and the Orchestra, the Oratorio, the 
Opera, and Forms of instrumental music. 
For rural schools‘ we have outlined a very 
simple course, including among the records 
Mother Goose songs and singing games. This 
is sent by parcel post and is allowed to remain 
in a school two or three days. A program is 
played for the teacher and the suggested plan 
includes a closing entertainment utilizing jointly 
the work of the children and the records. The 
demand for this has been very much beyond 
our expectations and will require twelve or 
fifteen machines if we are able to finance the 
proposition. 
What we have called telephone concerts have 
been given to local and rural subscribers by the 
installation of a special transmitter and horn 
in our Music Hall. As many as fifty persons 
have constituted a single audience and with a 
small number the music has been transmitted 
fifteen miles. Sacred programs and programs 
for shut-ins have made the plan popular. In 
an all-town gathering for comniunity singing 
of the old-time melodies we have enlisted the 
interest of our local celebrities, William Allen 
White and Walt Mason, the former writing a 
poem Emporia which was sung to the melody

of Maryland and the latter Kansas Land to the 
air of Soldier's Farewell. The program of the 
all-state singing contest aroused considerable 
local interest, since five hundred dollars was 
raised by volunteer subscription for the prizes. 
_ Such instances might be multiplied, not a 
thousand fold perhaps, but certainly a hundred. 
If the Supervisor wants to begin to establish 
not a little noisy reputation for himself but a 
forward going movement of community uplift 
he has but little to do before he actually begins. 
Let him assume that the resources of the average 
community, in the way of providing its own 
entertainment, are but rarely realized. Too 
often, persons and organizations from outside 
are brought in to provide it, when it could be 
supplied more ably by home folks. This sug- 
gestion has been offered: 
First, make a survey of the community. En- 
list everyone who is able to contribute talent of 
any kind. Ask only for volunteer service. 
Offer no compensation. Appeal rather to the 
altruism of the people and try to make them 
feel that here is offered a chance for community 
service. /Be sure that the people whom you 
enlist to\aid are representative of every church 
and social group, because the movement must 
be kept truly representative, else it will fail in 
its purpose. 
Where there is an assembly room in connec- 
tion with the schools, large enough, it is greatly

  116 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
to the advantage of the enterprise to hold en- 
tertainments there, for it will lessen the danger 
,of improper domination. 
The natural starting point in the production 
of “home-talent” entertainments is in the 
schools, utilizing the children and young people 
in various ways. Where persons outside of the 
schools can be brought in to work in conjunc- 
tion with the students, immediately there be- 
gins a desirable relationship between school and 
community which, when properly fostered and 
directed, results greatly to the advantage of all 
concerned.

CHAPTER XI 
Community Music 
From the Private Music Teacher’s Standpoint. 
I. 
Assuming that the Supervisor has by actual 
investigation and experiment proved to himself 
that the private music teacher is a capable, 
valuable, and, indeed, indispensable team- 
worker, may he not to his profit spend a few 
moments in attempting, to look out over the mu- 
sic field of the community from the private 
teacher’s point of view and vantage? 
Anyone who reads current news items of 
music happenings cannot fail to be impressed 
by what has been called “the immense recep- 
tive capacity ” of the American people for music. 
It is truly areal capacity and, by nature, healthy 
and active. But even more satisfactory, in a 
sense, is the evidence shown on every hand of 
an equal capacity for expression through music. 
While it is valuable to any community to listen 
to the music of a visiting artist, it is quite as 
essential, even more so, that the people them- 
selves shall make their music, have their own 
music interests, and, through whatever form 
of practice they may elect, to come into more 
117  
-P-A-G-E-118
  118 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
intimate knowledge, understanding, and ap- 
preciation of music as an intimate art. 
For some years past communities all over the 
United States have been attending most per- 
sistently to this particular and praiseworthy 
matter, and as a result Community music has 
come into being. Often it is a most serious 
affair. The classics are now to be heard in the 
most unheard of places. Choral organizations, 
too numerous to count, have come rapidly to 
the front and are doing significant work. In 
short, the communities are musically awake. 
Quite as valuable as all this is the existence 
of amateur musical organizations (using the 
word “amateur ”’ in its strict sense). Anyone 
who has not inquired about the matter will be 
surprised to learn of the considerable number 
of chamber music organizations that are pri- 
vately practising and playing to audiences of 
friends and music lovers. There was reported 
recently the interesting story of a chamber 
music organization, wholesome and _ healthy, 
that exists in the North Carolina mountains. 
Every Sunday the neighbors are welcome to 
come in and hear the players, who are business 
men. “Haydn and Mozart cheer them up 
beyond words, especially a Minuet or a sprightly 
Allegro. Upon hearing these their faces light 
up with expression and joy.” The leader of the 
quartet* says the effects of the music of Brahms 
*Mr. Woodroffe.
-P-A-G-E-119
  COMMUNITY MUSIC AND PRIVATE TEACHER 119 
and Schumann upon this audience “ are a bit 
trying; we hear occasional coughing, shuffling 
of feet, here and there a muffled yawn. We 
have often succeeded in driving out the bulk of 
our audience with a straight course of indigest- 
ibles. 
“Every communityisin direneed of a chamber 
music organization of some kind, good, or as 
good as possible. Why are not prizes offered 
for the best city quartets, just as our music 
clubs and wealthy patrons stimulate the writing 
of new operas and other compositions? ” 
This reaches out to the matter in its most 
important phase. Anything that can be done 
to broaden and deepen local musical activity is 
infinitely superior to offering prizes for works 
that are not destined to be heard by as many 
people as there are dollars in the prize. 
Two influences have led to the quickening of 
local musical interest. One is music as a sub- 
ject of growing importance in the public schools 
under the Supervisor whose career we are des- 
cribing. He must determine its consequent 
reflex effect upon the home plus its contribution 
to festival chorus concerts. The other is the 
persistent pioneering of artists and organiza- 
tions through skilled managers, which, as the 
saying goes, is causing two concerts to grow 
where one grew before. 
At this point fairness demands us to recog- 
nize still a third means which has a decided
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
measure of influence: the mechanical player. 
One of the most unique instances of community 
music activity that has come to the present 
writer’s attention centers around a family that 
owns a phonograph and a piano-player. They 
give carefully thought-out programs, mostly of 
cheerful music, to the neighbors. And they 
offer a marvelous list of attractions. In that 
little front room the people come together to 
hear nearly every artist on the pay-roll of the 
Metropolitan Opera: Company, and_ besides 
them Paderewski, Hoffman, Ysaye, Elman, and 
all the rest. The community is devoted to 
manufacturing and small agricultural pursuits. 
We may be positively sure that the mechanisms 
that produce this music are affecting mill work 
and agriculture. The good and the pure al- 
ways permeate and influence the useful and 
beautify it. 
There is another phase of community music 
of which we hear little, because it is conducted 
by one who works well and finds his reward not 
in “loud proclaiming ” but in the joy of what 
he actually accomplishes. He is the private 
teacher who has carefully studied the community 
in which he lives and has made up his mind that 
he can make his teaching and his knowledge of 
music bring pleasure and uplift into the livesof 
all the people he can reach. Some of them are 
pupils, others are the adult citizens of the 
town. To all of these he believes he can make 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
COMMUNITY MUSIC AND PRIVATE TEACHER 121 
some appeal worth while. Such a teacher 
studies the town systematically and lays it out 
something like this: 
    Then he begins to study each item in the 
group to discover wherein he may be of personal 
service without pay and for the common good. 
No, the suggestion is not utopian. It is 
eminently practical. Community music or com- 
munity interest in music has never raised its 
head an eighth of an inch without the coaxing 
encouragement of some one person. 
This is an office to which one elects one’s self. 
It is quite as important as any other office in 
the town, (Selectman, Pound Keeper, Over- 
seer of the Poor. In fact, this teacher becomes 
“ Overseer of the poor in musical experience.’’) 
Let one assume the position with a heart full 
of thanks. It is something well worth doing.
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
Has the library no books on music? He recom- 
mends those that are of prime importance. Do 
the Boy Scouts and the Camp Fire Girls sing 
when they come together? If so, what do they 
sing? If not, why do they not sing? He offers 
to teach them a few songs and they fairly jump 
at him in gratification. 
But, one says, “ I never taught boys and girls 
to sing a song in my life. I am a pianist.” 
There was once a man who was asked by four 
college boys if he could teach them Italian. 
“ Boys,” he said, “I do not know a word of 
Italian, but we will get five grammars and begin. 
There is nothing that five willing minds cannot 
learn.” 
And still again there is another form of music 
benefit to the neighborhood, and community 
at large, that is by no means overworked. I 
refer to the teacher’s own active music life with 
her pupils as members of the public school sys- 
tem. If she gives pupils’ recitals, and she 
should, let the public benefit by them as much 
as is possible. This is neither self-adulation, 
nor pushing one’s self forward, nor self-adver- 
tising. It is really permitting a good and (let 
us hope) a beautiful opportunity to reach as 
many as possible. Many teachers are doing 
just this sort of work. But there is need of 
countless others to join in and to stimulate the 
music of their neighborhood and of the town at 
large.
-P-A-G-E-123
COMMUNITY MUSIC AND PRIVATE TEACHER 123 
Let us look again at the diagram that illus- 
trates this chapter and ask ourselves whether 
we really take pains to know anything definite 
about our own community. All about us are 
avenues of approach into the hearts and homes 
of the people. Do we seekthem out, impelled 
by the service idea, striving to find what we 
can contribute of our talent to the lives of those 
who have not this talent? We must remember 
that nothing of this order is spontaneous. Some- 
body must get the materials ready and start the 
fire. A township* in Pennsylvania has a paper 
called Our Town, the purpose of which is to de- 
velop the community idea among its citizens. 
This is a practical thought. But it will be found 
that somebody has to secure the copy, and edit 
the paper, and write the uplift articles and all 
probably without recompense. 
Anybody intent on community music will 
find all these’ troubles and several others. The 
one deadly weight that is guaranteed to keep 
any person or community inactive is Tradition. 
In the presence of a new idea or plan Tradition 
always halts, pulls out its sign and hangs it on 
its coat. 
I AM BLIND 
But it is not Blind; it has just fallen asleep, 
and the enthusiastic one has to shake it awake. 
The traditional method of teaching a country 
*Narbeth, near Philadelphia. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  124 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
school, for example, is “just to teach school,” 
but a woman in Nebraska who is not averse to 
starting new things and entertaining new ideas, 
has established in the schoolhouse a neighbor- 
hood center. 
She perceived three things, true for cities and 
towns everywhere: 
1. No public building is used so few hours 
per annum as a schoolhouse. 
2. Few parents ever visit the schools. 
8. Few teachers, comparatively, do any- 
thing to bring parents to the school except as 
bearers of grievances. 
So she has started neighborhood center meet- 
ings in the schoolhouse. The program of ac- 
tivity includes those things in which the neigh- 
borhood is economically interested: Education, 
agriculture, housekeeping, the future of the 
children, and so on. A traditional diagnosis 
of this activity would predict a failure. But 
the fact is that people come to the meetings in 
such numbers that sixty automobiles and teams 
is no unusual number to be counted along the 
fence. 
One who thinks in professional terms only, 
may ask what all this has to do with music. 
And the answer is: 
Unless music has to do with all this it will re- 
main “traditional” and about one-third as 
efficient as it could be and that without any 
increase of cost to itself. 
 
-P-A-G-E-125

II. 
Perhaps nothing will exemplify the moral of 
this chapter more convincingly than the follow- 
ing incident, literally taken from life, and there- 
fore valuable initstruth. This is the confession 
of a private teacher of music. 
At first I was entirely skeptical as to the value 
to be found by the community in the work of 
the private teacher. I argued thus from my 
own experience: I attend to my work just as 
faithfully as I can. On my own initiative I 
secure my pupils and by my own study, know- 
ledge, and industry I help them. The whole 
matter then is private; it involves me and my 
pupils and is no affair of the public. This is 
the way I argued at first. 
Then one of my pupils asked me whether she 
might play at a school function to be held on a 
Friday afternoon in the assembly room. We 
decided upon what she should play, worked it 
up carefully, and held the proper rehearsals. I 
determined to attend if I could. The principal 
was very courteous and invited me to sit with 
- the teachers. The program was excellently 
arranged and splendidly carried out. Every 
number had individual interest, was pleasingly 
presented, and the appreciation of the children 
was delightful to witness. Emily played her 
piano piece quite to my satisfaction and in- 
finitely more to the satisfaction of her joyously 
applauding school-mates. 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
    126 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
As I cameaway from the building and watched 
the children romping, running, and shouting 
on their way home, their sedate parents bring- 
ing up the rear, it suddenly crossed my mind 
that I had been in attendance at a community 
concert; that my pupil, Emily, had made her 
debut as a community performer; and that by 
all lines of reasoning I had become a community 
teacher. That is, by my work with Emily, done 
privately and earnestly, we had this day given 
pleasure to an audience of several hundreds of 
people, young and old, hitherto unknown to me. 
I determined, then and there, to study the 
question of community service; not academically 
but in the practical application of my ability 
to my townspeople. Here is a school, a com- 
munity unit, which could quite easily think of 
itself as I had thought of myself, called upon 
to teach and—shall we say —let it go at 
that. Butitdid not let it go at that. It found 
twenty ways to please its pupils and their par- 
ents; it took time, trouble, and pleasure in 
arranging as pleasant an afternoon’s entertain- 
ment as one could wish to attend. At once I 
thought more of the principal of that school and 
of the teachers. They were making good, and 
not only that, they were anxious for the make- 
good to be known and enjoyed. 
What, in like manner, was I doing? 
When I asked myself that question I nearly 
fell over. What I had hitherto rather rebell-
-P-A-G-E-127
COMMUNITY MUSIC AND PRIVATE TEACHER 127 
iously regarded as my private professional ac- 
tivity I now saw was a straw man of my own 
selfish creation. The root and branch of the 
truth was this: I had clung to the privacy of my 
work, to the exclusion of my task, to the dignity 
of my calling, because I was a poor team worker, 
or better, no team worker at all. I stopped 
quarreling with the community music preach- 
ment, and made up my mind that I had been 
interpreting it wrongly. Instead of pondering 
on what people are doing in distant places; in- 
stead of thinking how impossible distant suc- 
cesses would be at home I saw at once that it 
was my duty to think of what would succeed 
here. I determined then to examine my sur- 
roundings. 
I would recommend to you, dear reader, 
to do what I next took the pains to do (and they 
were real pains). I wrote as carefully and as 
fully as I could two sets of sentences. 
1. What can the music teacher do for her 
community? 
2. What can I do for mine? 
When I thought I had done my best on these 
two lists, I made a third. 
3. What I am not doing for mine? 
I said to myself, here I am forty-six years old. 
In all the years of my teaching I had supposed 
myself free and clear of debt, and now I find 
that I owe a tax. But I am glad to pay it. 
This home town of mine has provided welfare
-P-A-G-E-128
128 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
to me and to my parents and even to my grand- 
parents. It gave me a splendid education; it 
gave me even a part of my music training. And 
when I was ready for them it gave me children 
to teach, boys and girls of its schools and fami- 
lies. And all these years I have been thinking 
that all I do in my daily teaching life is my own 
private affair. I have discovered a new and 
enticing working creed. I am going to pay my 
annual tax in service, such as I ean render, and 
I am joyful in the anticipation of my plans. I 
see expansion in my work and not contraction. 
(Forty-six is a tragedy when interests are grow- 
ing fewer!) Perhaps readers of this experience 
would like to know what I wrote down for the 
three lists, particularly number two: What can 
I do for my community? 
I find that every statement in this list springs 
from the individuality of the town and its 
people. I am not attempting to run my town’s 
music; I am trying to contribute to it. These 
things shape themselves more by the guidance 
of an invisible hand than we are inclined to be- 
lieve. FromitIhavelearned a few things. It 
is restricting, constricting, belittling to be musi- 
cally exclusive. I shall never forget the first 
big hint. Let me show it this way: 
(a) I, sitting in all my feeling of privacy, 
in the school. 
(6) Emily, in all her pride and innocence, 
a real community entertainer.
-P-A-G-E-129
COMMUNITY MUSIC AND PRIVATE TEACHER 129 
(c) The five hundred or more listeners cheer- 
ing Emily and waking me up. 
Does it take time and does it pay? Yes, it 
takes time just as everything does; going to © 
Europe, or stopping in the midst of a day’s work 
to receive the good news that a legacy has come 
to you. But now, I regard the time it takes as 
the greatest privilege of my life. I am doing 
something for other people. 
Does it pay? Yes, it pays, just as it pays to 
take the trouble to sit down with a good friend, 
or as it pays to accept a kindness. It pays in 
outlook, inlook, pleasure given and received, 
knowledge more and more humanely applied. 
Familiar to us all is the condition of the ag- 
riculturist who impoverishes himself by impov- 
erishing his land; by persistently taking from 
it without giving back to it. Land so treated 
becomes, in time, worn out. Men often act in 
individual manner toward their business or 
profession in the same way. They continue to 
take without giving. 
A community is just as much in need of en- 
richment as the land is. 
The public school takes the child untrained 
and returns him later more or less trained. 
Every teacher contributes to this enrichment 
of the community brought about by enriching 
the mind of the individual child. All classes of 
private teaching should be inspired by no less 
a motive than this community betterment. Its 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  130 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
contribution to our times is not alone material; 
it is essentially that spiritual phase of enrich- 
ment which is vital in all forms of efficiency; 
which when absent makes so many efficiency 
processes but dead letters. 
Therefore it is not only true, as we have just 
concluded, that a community, like land, is in 
' (need of enrichment; it is also true that it 
needs spiritualization, just as the individual 
does.

CHAPTER XII 
Tae Socia, Vatur or Music 
The preceding chapters have shown, we trust, 
what a real demand there is throughout the 
United States on the part of the people them- 
selves for opportunity to make music; to find 
along the highways of this beautiful domain the 
call to song and the stimulus to the elevating 
benefits of it. Whether the Supervisor sees in 
public school music its little play of daily task 
for the consummation of daily needs that must 
be gotten rid of; or whether he sees it, as the 
broader canvas on which it adds literally the 
loveliness of future national life—whichever of 
these he perceives most clearly — it yet has been 
proved that music has entered our social life 
as a great influence. 
That indefatigable and creative worker in 
behalf of American music, Mr. John C. Freund, 
has spent valuable time and money in securing 
reliable statistics in respect of the amount of 
money we spend annuallyfor musicinthe United 
States. We present here his larger summations: 
Opera: Italian, French, and English (exclusive of 
musical comedies) ..............ceseeeees $8,000,000

concerts by women’s clubs, etc. ........... 25,000,000

These are amazing figures; but they become 
more amazing when they are analyzed as one 
writer* has done,“‘ They mean that we spend for 
music: ” | 
1. Three times as much as we do on the army 
and navy or as we do on the postal service. 
2. Within twenty per cent. of the value of 
the hay crop, which is the largest crop of the 
country. 
8. Within fifteen per cent. of the cotton 
crop, which is the next largest crop. 
4. Four times as much on music as the total 
value of our agricultural implements. 
5. Thirty per cent. more that the value of 
the woolen industries, |

6. Three times as much as the value of the 
poultry, fresh-killed or frozen, that we consume 
during a year. 
7. Four times the entire product of our 
orchards for a year. 
8. Five times as much as the butter crop. 
9. Nearly three times as much as the potato 
crop. 
“ Another most significant feature of these 
figures is that the largest item is for tuition, for 
musical education. While a large amount in 
itself is spent for opera and concerts by foreign 
artists, the amountis insignificant compared with 
what is spent for education, pianos and talking 
machines, which virtually means music in the 
home. The annual output of pianos and player 
pianos alone is about four hundred thousand 
instruments. 
“This shows most conclusively that we are 
a very musical nation. But is all this expen- 
diture to good purpose? Has our hard earned 
money gone for that which will further the ele- 
vation of society? 
“Mr. Freund says the largest item of expense 
is for tuition. Has this been spent to the best 
educational purpose when we have no definite 
standard for music teaching either public or 
private? ” \

  sorts, have witnessed many instances that show 
og potentially music is entering our national 
ife. 
Without the fear of error we may say that the 
Supervisor who elects so: to plan his work for 
public school classes as to enable him to employ 
it as a social factor, through the home and 
through the community, has arisen to the recog- 
nition of the most significant possibilities of his 
profession. . Speaking of the social value of the 
music festival the organizer and secretary* of a 
recent successful festival thus presents the facts 
in respect of its value. 
“The music festival can be made a part of the 
municipal life of any community. It is a factor 
in the promotion of educational and commercial 
activities. (Of all the arts there is but one which 
strikes a responsive chord in every home and 
heart — and that is music. ) 
j/ Socially, it means much. Lovers of music 
ate gathered from various quarters and con- 
ditions of life, all assembling with but one mo- 
tive, the study of music. Friends greet friends, ° 
and the rehearsals often prove excellent meet- 
ing places for those with leisure evenings who 
would otherwise congregate elsewhere, or for 
those who desire a pleasant change from the 
every-day business routine. 
J‘Commercially, it has unnumbered advan- 
tages. To the trades people it brings added

business, especially at the time of the concerts. 
The taxicab companies, the street car lines, the 
restaurant owners, the drug and department 
stores, the music publishers, the piano houses, 
as well as hundreds of others, all profit. The 
music teacher lists new pupils, the orchestra and 
soloists and others who assist receive their pay, 
and, in fact, everyone, including the managers, 
if the concerts are successful, gains in some way. 
The audience has its share in enjoyment, and 
the city receives large profits through the splen- 
did publicity and advertising which such an 
enterprise gives. 
(3 \ Educationally, it is one of the greatest 
schools a city can possess. Under the leader- 
ship of an able conductor, the best music is 
studied, and the chorus acquires for little or 
nothing a training which would be worth many 
dollars to the individual pupil. The course of 
music as taught in the public schools is fine, but 
it is not comprehensive enough for the aspiring 
student. The guiding hand of a well-known 
conductor, the knowledge and experience which 
he can use to splendid advantage, are what the 
average teacher cannot offer. And the fact that 
a public performance is to be given on a big 
scale with a large orchestra and noted soloists 
is only one of many incentives for the singers to 
work and study. 
|_** Whether it be ragtime or opera, the world 
loves music. If we can cultivate a desire for

  136 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
the classical instead of the so-called popular 
tunes, have we not accomplished much?” 
Another writer and leader deeply and broadly 
experienced in the matter of the social value 
of music, Dr. Frank Damrosch, said recently, in 
a letter addressed to the New York Times: 
“ Tt is now twenty-four years since I organized 
the People’s Singing Classes, which a little later 
developed into the People’s Choral Union. In 
1892 I offered to teach all those who wanted to 
learn to sing from notes, regardless of previous 
knowledge of music and without a previous ex- 
amination of their voices. At the first meeting 
in Cooper Union seven hundred presented them- 
selves, and this number grew to over one thou- 
sand in the course of the year. 
“Two additional classes in different parts of 
the city had to be established and in this way, 
year after year, thousands of people have been 
educated in choral singing. We do not, how- 
ever, promise to teach them to sing the Messiah 
in ten lessons. On the contary, we tell the 
people that at the expiration of the first season’s 
work in the elementary class they would be 
promoted into an advanced class and then, 
and not until then, would they be admitted to 
the People’s Choral Union, which undertakes 
the study of the great oratorios and other 
choral music. 
“ But the claims of the People’s Choral Union 
for recognition do not rest so much upon these 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE SOCIAL VALUE OF MUSIC 137 
performances, with which it comes into com- 
parison with other established choral societies, 
but rather in the unique field which it and it 
alone has filled for nearly a quarter of a century. 
This field is that of being a community chorus. 
“During the twenty-four years of existence 
of this people’s chorus, no one has been asked 
to contribute one cent toward its maintenance. 
The members pay ten cents every time they 
come for a lesson. The teachers have one and 
all given their services gratis. The only ex- 
pense has been hall rent, music, and such inci- 
dental printing and postage expenses as are re- 
quired in all organizations; and all this work 
has been done without fuss and feathers, with- 
out attempting any of the sensational adver- 
tising methods which are usually adopted by 
efforts to attract attention to ephemeral schemes 
which interest the public for a day and a night 
and then drop for something that has more 
novelty in it.” 
It is the testimony of practically all who have 
reported upon the effort to interest groups of 
people in music that success always follows 
upon a persistent appeal ‘to the individual’s 
participation in the music as, for example, in 
chorus singing, and orchestra playing. It is 
also evident that efforts which tend merely to 
entertain the people of the neighborhood or 
community are less successful. Concerts and 
lectures (when not too loud or distracting) offer
-P-A-G-E-138
  138 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
little hindrance to somnolence; but to play a 
tuba or sing bass necessarily keeps the citizen 
awake and alert; and furthermore, participation 
in music-making develops skill and the highest 
form of team work. Therefore, it develops the 
individual. The davicuaen individual is an 
enrichment to his times and people, and so the 
good is propagated. 
We see, then, that the old-fashioned singing 
school was an effort in the right direction. It 
divided the community into three groups: 
1. Those who sang. 
2. Those who came to listen and encourage. 
8. Those who remained unattached (and 
upon this third class many blessings fall for they 
do other highly essential things). 
All evidence seems to show, then, that the 
best interests of a community are conserved 
through self-expression; that is, through actual 
participation in music making under skilled 
leadership. 
./A certain business house employing two or 
three hundred people brings them together once 
a week for chorus practice. For that hour or 
so, this firm really goes out of business. The 
chorus director works on a definite schedule 
which culminates in a midwinter concert and 
a spring concert, all of value and experience, 
and thoroughly delightful. 
All community activity that we have as yet 
studied or discussed with those who are develop- 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
THE SOCIAL VALUE OF MUSIC 139 
ing it, points to the conclusion that small per- 
manent results follow upon efforts to entertain, 
while significant results follow upon partici- 
pation. ; 
When this conclusion was presented to me 
by a community music worker I asked this 
question: “ What benefit comes to the audiences 
that attend the amazing number of concerts 
which are given every winter all over the United 
States? ” 
And his reply was: 
“JT have never been able to tell what is the 
benefit.” 
An honest reply but a disappointing one, for 
there must be a benefit. 
The moment young Lochinvar comes out of 
any point of the compass and proposes to make 
the community a distinct music center, someone 
will rise to inquire if his proposed organization 
will constitute a good business asset. Will it 
help our town and our people? 
The opinion has been expressed that a local 
orchestra is a good asset in a business sense. 
The press has urged upon citizens in some of 
the larger cities to contribute to the support of 
the local orchestra because it is considered good 
business to do so. The business men of Cin- 
cinnati support the festival chorus concerts 
generously because it brings people to their com- 
mercial center. 
The community music director may assure 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
himself that he is a logical business factor. He 
awakens, enlivens, vitalizes. It is a pity that 
everybody may not come under his influence. 
“¥or he is a discoverer of individual and com- 
munity resources. He seeks for them and. finds 
them within the domain o! ordinary circum- 
stances. He looks not for results to a com- 
munity of unusual citizens, but to one of the 
average type of American citizen. 
Because he can develop the power of the 
average citizen into an unusual form of expres- 
sion, is the reason that the developer of com- 
munity ability is at once of value to his people 
and a builder of their ideals.

CHAPTER XIII 
Music in THE Home 
i. 
In a recent address before the Utah State 
Association a speaker* whose topic was Es- 
sentials said: 
“The gist of present-day pedagogy, as I 
catch it is this: eliminate the non-essentials and 
vitalize everything you teach by connecting it 
closely with life..... The present’ pronounced 
tendency to crowd on to the school the work 
that rightfully belongs to the home is unfair. 
The pessimistic wail that this must be done 
because the home is passing should receive no 
encouragement from the teacher.... But the 
home’is not passing, it is readjusting with the 
age.” 
We are spending not a little time and a vast 
amount of money the country over to carry out 
our first experimental undertakings in Com- 
munity Music. The activity is not absolutely 
new, but as a widespread social expression its 
significant accomplishment is recent. Many 
communities have been noted for a considerable 
period for definite and artistic work. We may 
instance the Cincinnati Biennial Festival, the 
annual music performance at Norfolk, Conn., 
*Mr. Howard R. Driggs. 
141 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
    142 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
the Bach Festival at Bethlehem, Pa., and many 
others of like kind. Furthermore we are dis- 
covering the value and the beauty as a social 
factor of the Pageant, a recent form of social 
community spirit. 
Naturally into the various forms of social 
expression the individual enters as a primary 
necessary unit. Before he is of any organized 
value he must be trained. He often receives 
this training exclusively within the organization 
itself and he seldom carries over the experience 
into private life to the degree of fulness that is 
possible.; But when one does this there results 
such an enrichment of individual life that one 
begins to experience a totally new series of re- 
actions. When the leader of any form of or- 
ganized activity takes that interest in the indi- 
vidual which leads to recommendations for 
augmentation in private work he is enriching 
his own individual associate and he is creating 
a new and richer center of life. 
There are a few, probably many more than 
the writer knows of, present-day music organi- 
zations, membership in which is permitted only 
after a searching preliminary examination and 
the explicit agreement that the new member 
shall continue to study privately so long as he 
retains his membership. This agreement makes 
for a utilitarian object, namely, a possibly im- 
proving talent capable of greater and greater 
demands on the part of the one who employs
-P-A-G-E-143
MUSIC IN THE HOME 143 
it in an organized capacity. This is the one 
stimulating factor of all membership in formal 
and informal associations: one is impelled to 
give more to the group idea by persistently im- 
proving the quality of the unit. 
But we may turn this many-sided shield again 
to find that individual improvement suggested 
by organized activity lends a vast amount of 
pleasure and benefit- that is peculiar to this 
method of securing it. The writer knows an 
excellent bass singer, member for many decades 
of a famous chorus, who from the stimulation 
of the chorus practice period has attained year 
by year an amazing degree of music skill, knowl- 
edge, inspiration, and, to an extent, authority, 
simply by taking home the hints and suggestions 
of the chorus director and by thought and study 
resolving them into individual knowledge and 
training. He has found a distinct form of 
pleasure as well as of ability, something he never 
would have attained by confining himself ex- 
clusively tochorus practice. In brief, he has be- 
come an active agent for his own advancement. 
It is worth while then for us all to secure the 
benefits that come from quietly studying and 
resolving our institutional and social problems 
in private. Every hint may be so developed 
as to produce valued results. The one thing 
we all stand in need of more than anything else, 
the one thing that we are constantly failing to 
secure, is the larger individual interpretation, 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  144 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
in our private life, of our experiences won through 
social and organized activities of any kind. 
Il. 
We have suggested in Chapter I of this book 
that the Supervisor map the town in order to 
comprehend it better as a unit. May we ven- 
ture to suggest once again to him that he now 
make another map; perhaps a tabulation will 
serve as well, on which he may see at a glance 
what proportion of families in his town are pro- 
vided with musical instruments (including 
phonograph); listing as well who the individual 
children are of the schools that are studying 
music privately. No one would complain if 
he should silently and privately elect himself 
Supervisor of Music in every home whether 
music be made there or not. He may become 
at his own instance official and friendly adviser 
in every family. One would need only to look 
back on his opportunity and possible sphere of 
influence, in the light of a quarter century, to be 
convinced that the privilege of doing this is 
really a duty. 
To go a step or two beyond the mere fact of 
taking interest in the domestic (family) music 
life throughout the town, the Supervisor may 
see how valuable an asset is to be found in or- 
ganized effort between himself and the private 
teacher, himself and the homes where music is 
cultivated, himself and the children who pri-
-P-A-G-E-145
MUSIC IN THE HOME 145 
vately study music. Whether he emphasize 
this intimacy of association one way or another, 
it will result in benefit to all concerned. 
Is there a phonograph in the home across the 
way? Let him learn the usual history of the 
phonograph in the family. He will find that 
in a majority of cases it has been purchased with 
enthusiasm; then the familiar records are pur- 
chased and played until everyone has grown 
weary of them; then there has come a day when 
no one knows how to determine what the most 
desirable records for continued purchase are. 
After a few vain attempts to increase the col- 
lection, it is given up as a bad joband the in- 
strument is put away and all is forgotten. Let 
the Supervisor note that the original enthusi- 
asm which purchased the instrument has died 
away only because the purchaser does not know 
how to go on increasing his investment. There 
are scores of thousands of records in existence 
but he knows not how todiscriminate among 
them, and in doubt he does not act. 
But a phonograph and its records, properly 
_' employed, constitute a wonderful opportunity 
- for the non-technical musical family to enjoy 
music. Acting as friend or adviser to these 
people, the Supervisor can, in one of a dozen 
ways, revive or keep up their interest in music 
and acquaint them with such simple technics 
hee these: How to care for the instrument: how 
‘to adapt the needle to the record (this often
-P-A-G-E-146
  146 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
makes all the difference between a good and a 
bad rendition); he can make out for them a list 
of desirable records to purchase. He may even 
venture to go so far as to help a musical family 
to learn the interesting art of constructing’ 
proper programs, that is, the art of grouping 
pieces in such wise that they have good sequence 
and effect taken asa whole. There should bethe 
same degree of congeniality in a program of ten 
phonograph pieces that there is, or should be, 
in a social gathering of ten persons. It is per- 
fectly easy, by the introduction of one jarring 
character, to disturb an otherwise pleasant en- 
semble. 
It may be that the reader will smile at the 
freedom with which a writer permits himself 
to make suggestions bearing upon work he is 
not himself to perform. But it is shown so 
convincingly in all the affairs of life that even 
an elementary faculty for organization results 
in such a disproportionate degree of benefit 
that, once the matter be undertaken, its con- 
tinued successful exploitation is so relatively 
simple that it should not cease to exist because 
the first step seems hard. 
Let us keep ever in mind that what we are 
striving to do is to establish a community re- 
sponsive to music, not alone in its community 
activity, but in its private practice following 
upon community inspiration. Once we make 
the amateur sensitive to music, the mind keenly
-P-A-G-E-147
MUSIC IN THE HOME 147 
alert to it, and the heart responsive to it, we 
have opened the ear and established the listen- 
ing sense. Daily life proves to us that we are 
surrounded by a mass of tangible and intangible 
material to which we react only in the crudest 
way. Now the art of life is to learn to react to 
the rarest experiences that may fall within our 
environment. The writer of the address whose 
words are quoted in the opening paragraph, 
expressed on the same occasion, this exceedingly 
direct testimony : 
“We need time to open our eyes and our ears to 
the truths and glories of this good old world. 
Most of us are going through it half blind and 
deaf to the best things that life has to offer. 
This thought was impressed upon me recently 
by my little boy. We were standing on a 
corner amid the hum and roar of the street, 
when suddenly he grasped my arm and said: — 
Papa, I can hear a house finch singing. 
Oh, you must be mistaken, I replied. 
No, he insisted, I can hear it. I?ll find 
it in a minute. There it is. He pointed to 
the little bird on the wires above us. 
The incident thrilled me. Thank God, I 
thought, for the teacher who has opened my 
boy’s ears to hear the songs of the birds even 
above the clamorous noise of the city. The 
crowds were streaming by. Only one, perhaps, 
out of the thousands had caught the exquisite 
bit of nature music.”  
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
Now in this bit of evidence from real life, we 
discover something worth while, something we 
are looking for in education, art, business, so- 
ciety, science, religion, and everywhere else— 
The thing has been accomplished. 'The child, 
once deaf to the song of the house finch, is now 
awakened. The world of sound is henceforth 
a world of meaning and beauty. 
No wonder the father exclaimed, thank God!
-P-A-G-E-149
CHAPTER XIV 
Tae Mecnanicayt Musicau INSTRUMENT 
A decided movement is observable tending 
to the specialization of music in the high school. 
It includes Music Appreciation, the Study of 
Musical Instruments, the Orchestra, Music 
History, Biography, and the public performance 
of choral works in large forms. It is the pur- 
pose of this chapter to discuss one of the con- 
tributory factors of this specialization, namely, 
the mechanical player. This may be either 
the player-piano mechanism or the phonograph; 
the latter predominating for the reason that it 
is less expensive and permits certain forms of 
reproduction, impossible to instruments of the 
piano type. 
Obviously, the primary question in respect 
of these instruments is their practicability. Do 
they contribute to actual demand? Do they 
reproduce music in a way that makes them 
desirable objects of association? What re- 
strictions must be recognized as bounding their 
utility? 
For the simple reason that these instruments 
are capable of doing what most individual 
teachers cannot do, they have already attained 
a degree of popularity in the schools that seems 
149
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
to stamp them with the hall-mark of “ Indis- 
pensable.” A player-piano mechanism can do 
so much more than the average teacher or Su- 
pervisor can do that it seems natural enough 
for the performer of limited capacity, to step 
aside and let the machine speak. So with the 
phonograph. The teacher may be able to 
describe musical instruments; but the phono- 
graph reproduces their tone quality with more 
or less fidelity. It can sing amazingly well; it 
reproduces stringed instruments well and the 
tone of some wood instruments with uncanny 
exactness. This has given them an indispen- 
sable place, and yet so perfect are they that we 
have failed to get the obvious best use from 
them as object lessons. 
No one can begin to interest a class of chil- 
dren in a word description of an orchestra that 
compares for a moment for convincingness with 
the tone effect of a few measures of a phono- 
graphic symphony. It may please the assembly 
audience to hear the Supervisor sing a song or 
aria, but out of the magic of the disc there issues, 
in all vigor and naturalness, the voice of Caruso, 
‘of Melba, of Sembrich. And not these alone, 
but surprisingly good reproductions of string 
instruments, of some wood-wind instruments, and 
of some ensemble compositions. No one can 
remain deaf to the message of these mechanisms, 
and consequently no one can remain uncon- 
vinced as to their utility. But it is essential
-P-A-G-E-151
THE MECHANICAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENT 151 
indeed to keep clearly in mind of what their 
utility consists. Otherwise any form of me- 
chanical player may easily become an abomi- 
nation. In brief, it must be employed as a ser- 
vant; a helper in a greater plan. 
We have hitherto spoken of the tendency of 
the times evincing itself in a divorce from the 
educational activity of the grades in music and 
making a swift, sudden turn to miscellaneous 
courses in the high school. To say the least, 
the latter are not always in sequence with the 
details of grade work. Here we find the one 
weak link in the chain, and it threatens to break 
at the point where we enter upon the high school 
segment. 
Already too many cases are in evidence of 
excellent music coming from the grades leading 
into an entirely unorganized high school. Too 
many high schools are entirely without ade- 
quate musical instruction of any kind. And, 
perhaps worst of all, instances are not a few of 
Supervisors who do surprisingly good work in 
the high school in appreciation, orchestral 
playing, and the like, but whose work in the 
grades is by no means so satisfactory. 
The one single, simple problem of the Super- 
visor in whose charge are both elementary 
grades and high school is carefully and logi- 
cally to plan a course of study embracing every 
year of the school system; a course, the impetus 
of which moves steadily forward, accumulating
-P-A-G-E-152
  152 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
power and amplifying in field from the first 
primary to the last high school year. 
Such a plan demands, and necessarily implies, 
progress and sequence. There must be no 
break, and the task of the child in the primary 
grade is to contributeits clearly distinguishable - 
mite, as well as “ might,” to what it shall do in 
later years as a member of the graduating class 
of the high school. 
We conceive, therefore, that music appre- 
ciation, for example, is not conclusively a high 
school subject, but an essential phase of music 
study that must be taken up in the days of the 
first rote songs and kept vitally alive all the 
way along to and through the high school. 
If children sing, say for eight years, and then 
begin to study music appreciation, is it not fair 
to ask why they have not been taught to appre- 
ciate what they have sung for eight years?) We 
express here and now a profound sympathy for 
the Supervisor who cannot make a class appre- 
ciate the rhetorical beauty of a simple eight- 
measure exercise. And we venture to say that 
unless the study of music appreciation is care- 
fully carried on from the advent into school of 
the child, and unless it be applied to all singing, 
it will never be thoroughly attained, however 
much time may be given it in the high school 
classes. And for this reason (and we trust that 
the over-enthusiastic appreciation specialist will 
pause for a moment to grasp this truth): We
-P-A-G-E-153
THE MECHANICAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENT 153 
appreciate art and life not from the stimulation 
of general information, but from our individual 
knowledge and experience. Appreciation is solid 
wood, not veneer. When appreciation is neg- 
lected throughout the grades, is taken up in 
the high school and applied to music types 
with which the children have had no experience 
as performers, it is foredoomed to a degree of 
failure which makes it an investment of doubtful 
value. It is no longer a matter of the heart, but 
it has become a topic for the conveying of gen- 
eral information. 
We have said that we learn to appreciate 
music relatively to the terms of our experience. 
The fundamental experience in music of chil- 
dren throughout the elementary grades, is sing- 
ing, listening, and writing — the three factors 
of music-making. They know, or should know, 
quite an extensive vocabulary of good types of 
songs. From the moment they begin to learn 
a melody, whether they learn it from the pages 
of a book or write it from the dictates of their 
thought, from that moment they should begin 
to appreciate the value of the expression or im- 
pression. The fact is, then, that any means 
which supplements the actual vocal activity of 
the school room is valuable as an appreciation 
factor/ For this reason phonographic records 
that parallel the grade work are indispensable. 
One should never overwhelm the child with 
the majesty of music that is wholly beyond its
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
comprehension, but one will find that by skilful 
direction even little children may be led into 
an expression of love and delight for the art 
of master singers. Therefore, if records are 
chosen with discrimination, the phonograph 
becomes an indispensable adjunct from the first 
primary grade throughout the school course. 
We must reiterate, do not merely overwhelm 
the child by causing him to remain more or less 
passive to great records. It is an essential part 
of ateacher’s duty to be assured of the right reac- 
tions that eventuate in all music-making for 
children. 
The Supervisor should keep it in mind that 
the player-piano mechanism is preferable for 
the reproduction of the vast literature of piano- 
forte composition; that it is preferable also for 
the reproduction of symphonic movements as 
a whole, because nothing inhibits their repro- 
duction in their entirety. It must be remem- 
bered that the phonographic record has a very 
definite and limited time run and that it is in- 
capable of recording, for example, the whole of 
a symphonic movement. Consequently all such 
movements must be reduced by the omission 
of portions to bring them within the time limit. 
On the other hand, the phonograph is superior 
to the player-piano for the performance of songs, 
of music by stringed instrument and by wood- 
wind instruments. Practically any orchestral 
instrument may be studied through certain 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
THE MECHANICAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENT 155 
educational phonographie records which give 
a surprisingly satisfactory idea of the instru- 
ments’ compass and tone quality. The phono- 
graph is practically valueless as a reproducer 
of pianoforte playing, although a few records 
have been produced, which, while unsatisfac- 
tory, as reproductions of the music in the most 
artistic sense, are strangely suggestive of the 
individuality of the performer. And yet even 
in this particular, the phonograph falls far below 
the player-piano. 
Supervisors who will study the matter care- 
fully will be surprised to discover what a com- 
plete series of programs may be made, illustra- 
tive of the national schools of music. Some of 
the most surprising records of Chinese instru- 
mental and vocal music and dramatic decla- 
mation are available. Indeed, a Music History 
course illustrated by records, grouped on the one 
hand, chronologically by nations, and the other, 
chronologically by forms, is possible and practi- 
cable. 
Perhaps the most valuable reaction on the 
part of the child, following what we may call the 
spontaneous appreciation of music, is to be 
found in that studious listening capacity which 
tends to express itself about music in terms of 
English speech. The effort to do this is valuable 
in two ways: First, it encourages the child in the 
establishment and use of a vocabulary peculiar 
to his own relation and interpretation of good
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
music; and, secondly, it is invaluable in showing 
him that a considerable portion of the delight 
we receive from music, much of its appeal to 
the heart and mind, is not to be expressed in 
English words. 
And thus, one comes to realize the truth of 
Mendelssohn’s statement of himself that tone- 
thought began at the point where word-thought 
ceased,

CHAPTER XV 
Music APPRECIATION 
I. 
Someone has said that the only person who 
does not study music appreciation is the mu- 
sician. If this be true, it implies much that is 
to be regretted; for while the exercise of the 
critical faculty should involve appreciation, it 
is sad to relate that it rarely does so. And there 
is another fact about music appreciation that 
is no less sad to relate: It is often purveyed to 
the public, to children, and to adults by those 
who are inadequately prepared to teach it; 
and to nobody’s gain, in, particular. 
The purpose, then, of this chapter is to point 
out some ways and means by which the Super- 
visor-whose training has not included the study 
of music appreciation may undertake the work 
with some realization of its importance and with 
an earnest of worthy results to his classes. But 
neither this chapter nor any other can teach 
all that is to be said to a class in respect of music 
appreciation. It can point the way only, the 
way of entrance into a vast area of music and 
of the literature of music from which the teacher 
must gradually select the materials with which 
he builds an effective course of study.

Those who remember reading for the first 
time Palgrave’s Golden Treasury of English 
Verse will recall that all of its numbers were not 
primarily of equal interest, were not in fact of 
equal appeal. The poems of Scott, Burns, and 
Thomas Campbell seem to find their way into 
the heart and mind almost without effort. 
Herrick’s Daffodils entered and was at home 
with us without question or formality, but other 
types stood aloof from us. We could not come 
near to them. Spenser’s Prothalamion seemed 
less easy to grasp and we concluded that for the 
most part the relatively modern in poetry was 
easier to understand than the archaic was. So 
we learned that the beauty of much poetry, par- 
ticularly of the older forms, is not obtained 
without effort. 
Quite the same condition arises with music. 
When we begin to study Appreciation we find 
ourselves confronted with even more types than 
we find in the Golden Treasury. Some of these 
are beautiful and appeal to us without effort 
on our part. Others are interesting; still 
others are odd or queer; and of another class 
we feel convinced that by no process on our part 
can they win our admiration. 
Now this many-sided appeal of music often 
leads teachers to avoid the issue which thus 
arises and to seek the shortest way out of the 
difficulty. Thus a teacher recently announced 
that he would teach appreciation to his classes  
-P-A-G-E-159
MUSIC APPRECIATION 159 
by giving them what they-understand. If there is 
any possible intellectual dodge calculated to in- 
duce paralysis, it is this very trick of solving exist- 
ing problems by giving others what we assume 
they understand. The average audience, whether 
it be of school-children or of adult amateurs, 
understands little or nothing of music as sub- 
ject for adequate appreciation; and therefore 
the whole art of teaching them lies primarily in 
this: That we shall persist in giving them what 
they do not understand. Meanwhile we stand 
by to help, succor and rescue, if need be, until 
understanding awakens in them; that we do 
everything we can to make the inherent beauty 
of all music a clear and convincing reality. But 
we must recognize that this is not to be done by 
permitting the patient to direct his own cure. 
Music appreciation is an intellectual accom- 
plishment. It literally incubates into reality. 
It is not a simple process. No mere willingness 
and readiness to take on culture can secure it. 
In brief: 
Music appreciation is a capacity of the de- 
veloped intelligence. 
And so, again, in brief: 
Music appreciation is not general informa- 
tion about music and musicians. 
To teach appreciation adequately then the 
teacher must first perceive the essential differ- 
ence between these two statements and then 
proceed to formulate a plan. In the chapter 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
on Books about Music, the reader will find the 
titles of a few works on music appreciation that 
are of value. They make plain the essential 
factors, or, put another way, they indicate main 
highways which, if traveled observantly and 
not too hurriedly, will interest us somewhat as 
to how to aim at the beauty of music and so 
make it possible for us to attain unto it. 
There are several plans of entry into the sub- 
ject. One may formulate work in appreciation 
according to any one of the following plans, or 
routes of progress, and be sure to emerge with 
a reasonable assurance of having produced for 
the student a real Golden Treasury of types. 
This is our cue. We must establish in the minds 
of the student types that shall remain forever 
as essentially true messages of the art of the 
composer. 
The principal methods of approach are: 
1. The historical (Chronological). 
2. By Schools of Composition. 
3. By Forms: (a) Instrumental, (6) Vocal. 
4. By composers. (This generally coincides 
with No. 1.) 
5. By instruments (that is, piano music, 
organ music, violin music). 
6. By nations (a plan of study admirably 
worked out by the Federation of Music Clubs). 
Something may be said in favor of each of 
these processes. If the Supervisor intends to 
formulate and develop his own course of study,
-P-A-G-E-161
MUSIC APPRECIATION 161 
working independently of text-books, he will 
need first to block out his plan, to sub-divide 
it into allotments of periods (recitations), to 
collect his material ready to hand and to have 
an abundant supply of reference matter of au- 
thoritative character. Let us assume that he 
proposes to present music appreciation by the 
third plan of instrumental and vocal forms. He 
immediately becomes aware of the fact that 
only a fair presentation of types of forms will 
involve theentire history of music; and that he 
can only touch upon the more salient facts and 
examples.. That is, he is overwhelmed by the 
immense richness of the field and constantly 
drawn aside by the temptation to present many 
examples of one concrete type. 
This conviction may lead him to adopt the 
efficiency expert’s plan of blocking his resources. 
Here is a preliminary sketch of what he will 
discover in reference to forms: 
(a) Vocal (b) Instrumental 
The variety and extent of the material as dis- 
covered in any other of the six plans mentioned 
above is no less embarrassing. The Supervisor 
will find that he can accomplish the historical 
phase with a measure of success, even if he only 
selects a single form for study, provided he 
undertakes to show its development from its 
inception. Effectively to do this he must thor- 
oughly prepare himself in order that he may give 
an adequate running comment upon the events
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
of music history contemporaneous with the par- 
ticular example of the form he is presenting. 
Thus, he may simplify the form presentation 
by selecting one type, say the Sonata or Sym- 
phony, or a group of types, say the Dances of 
the Suite; performing for his class the best types 
and presenting them with such historical com- 
ment and in such historic rstionhip that it 
carriesthe form along with all associated activity. 
For example, he may proceed with the sym- 
phony in this manner:

VI. Thus with Schumann, Brahms, 
Glazounoff, Mahler. 
1. The development of the symphonic 
poem by Liszt, Berlioz, Richard Strauss. 
2. The increase in orchestral resources in 
recent times. 
These are merely suggestions of points of 
interest that spring up in any appreciation pro- 
gram. A half year could readily be spent in the 
study of the symphony as we have sketched it 
here, and even then only the most obvious fea- 
tures would be discovered. In such a program 
an adequate means for presenting the music is 
of prime importance. In public schools this 
is limited to piano arrangements, to player-piano 
rolls, and to phonographic records. The dis- 
advantage of the piano lies in its utter inca- 
pacity to give the orchestral coloring. The 
disadvantage of the phonograph lies in the 
limited time duration of its records and the 
consequent necessity of emasculating the music. 
At present, about five minutes is the limit of the 
record run, but many symphonic movements 
last from twenty to thirty minutes. Hence, the 
necessity for cutting them down, which is equiv- 
alent to reducing them to a few bare lines. 
The record does give in a degree the orchestral 
coloring, but even this is not wholly satisfactory 
because when the tone of the higher wood-wind 
instrument enters the recording apparatus it 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
reproduces sharp, while the pitches of the lower 
instruments, strings, horn, etc., come out flat. 
If the phonograph is depended upon exclu- 
sively to illustrate the works selected for appre- 
ciation courses, it should be employed in such 
selections as are best recorded. The piano is 
not one of these. Like the records of orchestra 
music, the piano record is sharp and thin in 
upper tones, vapid, and dull in the lower register. 
Records for stringed instruments, particularly 
solo, are usually excellent. Most vocal records 
are good, though the high soprano voices are 
not so satisfactory as others. Ensemble music 
is, as a rule, unsatisfactory, but good enough 
to convey more than a general impression. 
Mcqubtely to employ this instrumental de- 
mand for appreciation requires a considerable 
amount of study and patient experiment on the 
part of ‘ile Supervisor; for after all, the essential 
factor in music appreciation is not alone in- 
formation, but the presence of beautiful tone. 
It is this one thing, beautiful tone, expressive 
of the soul and intention of the great mind, or 
of a people, that we are striving to appreciate. 
The ability to keep step with a band does not 
necessarily imply a trained musical intelligence. ° 
II. 
If the Supervisor’s educational training has 
not made him familiar with a considerable 
repetoire of masterpieces in music, with such
-P-A-G-E-167
  
  MUSIC APPRECIATION 167 
constructive features as Melodic Invention, 
Counterpoint, Orchestration, and Music Form, 
it will be necessary for him now to turn his at- 
tention to these matters, working them out so 
carefully that when he presents a composition 
for appreciation study his presentation shall 
be complete. 
Let the Supervisor note this: Unless his train- 
ing has made him thoroughly familiar with all 
the factors that enter into the genesis and ex- 
pression of music, he will fail to reveal to his 
class the very heart of the composer’s message. 
For it is obviously one of the easiest of accidents 
that may befall us of not seeing what is present, 
and thus being unable to enlighten others. 
Hence, the Supervisor, unprepared in the mat- 
ter of music education, unless he begins immedi- 
ately to repair the omission, is certain to become 
a greater menace than a benefit. For he who 
reveals only a little of what is truly great, can- 
not be said to be a truthful exponent of the ar- 
tist to the learner. 
Dr. Winship has the courage to say that the 
one essential test of education is not knowledge 
gathering, not memory training, not the light- 
ning calculator’s art, but it is Appreciation. 
A man’s life can rise no higher than his aspi- 
ration, and his aspiration will be no higher than 
his appreciation. A man at his highest is the 
appropriation in realization of his appreciation 
in idealization. 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  168 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
“Appreciation is always looking forward, and 
not backward, always advances and never re- 
tracts, always enhances values.” 
And the basis of all appreciation as a factor 
to be taught, is the appropriate knowledge of 
it; knowledge that is deep and true and se- 
cure. It is not to be attained by half hour 
courses, but comes quietly, as a growth 
development.
-P-A-G-E-169
  CHAPTER XVI 
Tue Newer PrRoBLEMS 
I. 
Educational institutions, including summer 
schools, for twenty years past, have striven 
earnestly to establish an efficient requirement 
for the intending Supervisor. While formerly 
his training was a matter of almost total 
omission of essentials, it is now a highly de- 
veloped, well-prepared curriculum, logical in 
its arrangement of units, scientific in their inter- 
relation; and in their totality representing the 
demands of education, not merely of music. 
The point of view that has gradually been 
assumed and from which this change has been 
wrought, demands the recognition of the Super- 
visor in a way quite unlike that of former times. 
No longer is he the accident upon the throne. 
He now enters by right of succession which rests 
in his equipment. He is no longer, in the 
opinion of the higher institutionalists that teach 
supervision, a teacher of music, but he is an 
educator who sustains a complex relationship 
with his community and with his pupils. He 
is not a job-holder, but a giver of service. He is 
not a time-filler, but a builder of the future. 
169
-P-A-G-E-170
    170 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
We may exhibit his inter-connecting interests 
and responsibilities in this manner. He is: 
1. Co-worker with the Superintendent, who, 
he knows, is convinced of the value of music as 
a factor in the total educational ideal.- 
2. Co-worker with the grade teachers as a 
prepared and reliable music faculty; sub-divided 
into faculty groups, of which he is Chairman, 
according to the school grade system. 
8. Contributor of a definite and well-organ- 
ized musical education to every child in town. 
4. Student of those lines of association by 
which he, the Supervisor, and his work are 
circuited with the activity of the private music 
teacher, with music in the home and in the 
church, with the amateur music organizations 
of the town, with the public library, and the 
committee, if there be one, on Town History 
and Pageantry. 
In another sense, the Supervisor is a modern 
type of the Town Musician of the German 
cities of olden times. But to many duties of 
his office he must elect himself, for while they 
are pertinent to his activity, they seem not to 
be recognized by his associates. He is, in short, 
a public official of immense value and influence 
only when he privately recognizes that fact and 
goes to work at his duty without being directed 
by someone else. There has never been so fine 
an educational opportunity as this of the Super- 
visor of music for self-education, self-direction,
-P-A-G-E-171
  
THE NEWER PROBLEMS 171 
and self-development, in a vast area of work 
the terms and title of which do not stand in the bond. 
No one has ever before enjoyed so immense an 
opportunity for fundamental constructive work 
that looms large in the present and builds large 
into the future. He is indeed one who may cast 
his bread upon the water; nor does he have to 
wait many days for its return. 
In the preceding pages we have suggested 
that from the very nature of his office the Super- 
visor is, like all school teachers, a factor in the 
family life of his community; perhaps a more 
intimate one than other teachers for what he 
deals with is a cultural influence, which, because 
it is what it is, stands in bolder relief than such 
essentials as spelling and history. These latter 
are taken as a matter of course; the other as a 
‘matter of distinction. So that while the one 
who can “ spell down ” everyone else in town 
has thereby won a distinction, the permanent 
ability to play or sing artistically is an ever- 
present joy wherever it may appear. 
Formerly the whole problem of school music 
rested upon the selection of a series of text-books. 
They (the books) were supposed to be an open 
sesame. But books work wonders only when 
a real worker perceives the wonder he wants 
and goes after it intensively. 
The text-book is no longer the problem. It 
is a tool to be selected with care and used with 
fine discrimination. Nor is the problem any
-P-A-G-E-172
  172 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
longer sought for in the process of teaching 
music, but in the application of the music at- 
tainment to cultural purposes. In brief, the 
Supervisor determines, not too hesitatingly or 
too generally, but after mature consideration 
and a study of detail, what the school-demand 
and the community-interest represent in sum 
total; how this sum total influences school-room 
work, and thereby establishes lines of procedure. 
The fact is that no one has yet fully realized 
the message of music in the fulness with which 
it may come from the hearts of children. One 
day every momentous event in town will be 
signalized by singing. Sometime (and may it 
not be a distant day) the assembly hour in the 
schools will be the time and place of pilgrimage, 
the townspeople coming in the same reverent 
spirit that prompts us in these days to entera 
place of worship for a few moments of medi- 
tation and prayer, of cleansing and uplift. A 
town well equipped for school music, whose 
community interests are centralized and properly 
observed, should be (and could be),day in and 
day out, a constant giver of joy to its people. 
Newer problems in school music are few, per- 
haps, indeed, there is none, save where schools 
have not yet arrived at what is deemed the 
essential course of study in music. Sight read- 
ing is no longer the direct aim of class singing, 
nor is the work of the chorus. The one distinct 
object of cultural attainment (music aiding and
-P-A-G-E-173
THE NEWER PROBLEMS 1738 
assisting) is the individual child. When we can 
express in clear terms what we think he should 
attain unto, we have before us all the music 
problems, old and new. 
Let us pause a moment to indicate the scope 
of attainment that would result in doing the 
most for the child who proceeds through the 
schools to the point of graduation from the high 
school. That is, to what extent may the 
Supervisor prescribe, direct, oversee, and bring 
about that degree of attainment which shall 
make the individual child a fair epitome of his — 
the Supervisor’s —vision of music. And before 
we begin to set forth in definite terms what this 
individual attainment may reasonably be, may 
we not wisely recall the terms of the investment: 
One hour a week for forty weeks, annually 
for twelve years. 
Or a total of four hundred and eighty hours 
of instruction. 
Or an equivalent of nine hundred and sixty 
half-hour lessons. 
Verily what we need in school music is not 
more time, but a definite goal and more intensity 
of action in the attempt to reach that goal. 
Suppose we possessed and used to the fullest 
extent of all value concerned: 
1. A skilled Supervisor. 
2. A body of grade teachers each skilled 
in music. 
8. A logical course of study.
-P-A-G-E-174
  174 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
4, An ample equipment. 
5. An ideal of attainment for each individual 
child. 
6. A time investment of one hour per week. 
7. The guiding hand and capable advice 
as to private music study. 
8. Wisely conceived and rightly operated 
music participation in community life. 
9. The whole plan and effort carried on by 
logical procedure and thoroughly vitalized by 
enthusiasm. 
Should we not then accomplish results as yet 
undreamed of? It would then be possible for 
the school system (plant, method, and operating 
force) to assure the average pupil of as practical 
a knowledge of music as it is assumed he will 
attain of English speech and literature. And 
this should include: 
1. The ability to read a considerable pro- 
portion of all vocal music at sight. 
2. To read it so well and so understandingly 
that the message of the composer shall reach the 
singer just as the message of the writers of prose 
and poetry reaches the reader. 
8. To appreciate why the great composer 
is great; to perceive the power of his genius and 
the quality of his message. 
4. To have an intimate acquaintance with 
the life, the point of view, the struggle and at- 
tainment of a few composers; this knowledge 
to be obtained for the inspiration which it 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE NEWER PROBLEMS 175 
yields; an inspiration just as valuable as that 
which comes from the study of the lives of states- 
men, generals, and inventors. 
5. To be able to use the voice agreeably 
both in song and speech, and to appreciate the 
sound of the cultured voice as it falls upon the ear. 
6. To know the symbols of music (they are 
few) as familiarly as we know the letters of the 
alphabet, the numerals, and such abbreviations 
as $ and cts. 
7. To be able to write simple music sen- 
tences (like the phrases of folk songs). 
8. To give entertainment to others and to 
receive it from others in terms of music. 
9. To contribute something of worth to the 
community activity when called upon. 
10. To perceive in all good music a gift of 
worth and beauty; so to hold it and respect it. 
11. To guarantee for the boy and girl a 
manhood and womanhood in whose spirit the 
culture of music will forever be vital. 
In brief, to make music a dynamic factor of 
self-expression, that creates pleasure within and 
expresses it without. We have not spoken here 
of appreciation, popular as the term is, and for 
the apparent reason that it is the very spirit of 
music emanating from the true study of the art. 
And further, we have tried inthepreceding pages 
to make clear how essential it is that appre- 
ciation be-inaugurated from the days of the first 
rote song. Appreciation is primarily the glow
-P-A-G-E-176
  176 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
of an understanding heart; it is never the record 
of a note-book. 
II. 
It is often held that the public school curric- 
ulum is valuable to the child in its varied de- 
mands, because in its very variety it produces a 
lasting benefit in mental training. We trust 
that this thought will some day tempt some one 
of the type of the late William T. Harris to 
plumb its depths and to ascertain in truth 
whether it be deep or shallow. The depth may 
be there, but this fact is obviously before us: 
A vast amount of school training passes abso- 
lutely out of sight, escapes us, leaves no trace 
in us that shows we ever encountered it, unless 
it may be a delicate tint in what we are prone 
to call our “ general education.” 
If the reader will take the trouble to make a 
written list of every subject he has studied since 
the first day he entered school, and will then 
check off that list the subjects of vital impor- 
tance to him today, he will be in a position to 
speak with more reliability of what’ general 
education has cost him. To make the matter 
even more convincing than this suggestion, we 
present herewith the factors in the training of 
a young woman of twenty-four. She is now 
specializing in art, and this group of studies (in 
art) is not included here. But everything else 
is, or as much as the young lady can remember.
-P-A-G-E-177
    " THE NEWER PROBLEMS 177 
To peruse this list one would think that to have 
received the benefits of its stimulation and in- 
spiration would produce nothing less than an 
Admirable Crichton. As a matter of fact the 
young lady of the list is quite an average type 
and as harmless of conversation as most people 
who have been subjected to a treatment that 
approaches the following in intensity. 
Here is a process by which the young lady 
has been trained, modified, guided, directed, 
to the end that she shall possess a “ general edu- 
cation.” She has studied: —

the Supervisor’s attention the fact that he must

organism truly alive, that it shall gain its inde- 
pendence to the degree that it may not be for- 
ever lost in such a mass of general education as 
we have just shown in detail,

Teacuine as Pusiic SErvicR 
In what shall the Supervisor find his reeom- 
pense? 
Persistently throughout the pages of this book 
we have burdened him with more and yet more 
responsibility. We have increased his area of 
work, and yet we have said nothing directly 
about the reward he should reasonably .expect | 
to receive for it. Is he to conclude that his task 
is without limit and his reward negligible? Or 
may he hope in return for what he does to be 
fairly compensated? 
Music supervision as vocation is, taking the 
country over, a more or less unorganized pro- 
fession. The foundation of Supervisor’s Asso- 
ciations, both state and national, will, in time, 
establish order and a consistent program, will 
create definiteness where now there is none. 
Supervisors are paid by no particularly consistent 
plan; some are amply recompensed; others, and 
by far the greater number, in an amount that 
cannot stimulate them to unrestrained en- 
deavor. \ 
Before the well-equipped Supervisor can be 
- sure of meeting with adequate recognition in 
all states, definite publicity work must be 
179

  180 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
undertaken the country over to educate both 
the public at large and the school authorities 
in reference to the purpose, value, and require- 
ment of public school music. We hear less in 
these days than we heard formerly the argu- 
ment that favored or disfavored music as a part 
of the curriculum. It seems as if that point has 
been won nearly everywhere. Gradually the 
propaganda favoring music has brought con- 
viction, especially to Superintendents. 
But in not a few places music is still the Cin- 
derella of the curriculum. It is left to get along 
as well as it may by providing its own resources. 
Instances are still only too common which show 
that when the Supervisor needs a phonograph 
or a piano she is compelled to arrange a concert 
in an effort to secure the funds for it. But if 
her work is really enhanced by phonograph or 
piano she certainly should not be required to 
purchase it in any such indirect taxation man- 
ner. We fail to hear of the manual training 
teacher giving a vaudeville entertainment in 
order to raise funds to buy a work bench or a 
set of tools. His equipment is assured, because 
it is held to be indispensable, and the money is 
appropriated directly. But when Cinderella 
wants anything, she must sit in her misery and 
sing for it. 
This is no reflection upon Cinderella, but upon 
her superiors.

point out that music supervision will never 
obtain the place it deserves, nor will Supervisors 
secure the standing they should have until 
Superintendents are convinced by the music 
working force that there is just as much voca- 
tion outlook, just as much cultural attainment, 
just as much mental training in the music lesson 
as elsewhere. In short, music as subject for 
study and as teaching activity, has importance; 
and yet it is properly the responsibility of the 
Supervisor to establish that importance. 
That manual training and other special sub- 
jects generally fare better than music is invari- 
ably the Supervisor’s fault. Until he knows 
what he wants, why he wants it, and how to 
obtain it, he will remain under-equipped, under- 
appreciated, and under-paid. The fact is that, 
by and large, the Supervisor has still to make 
his place, to define its scope and value, and to 
demand what is due to it. All this, however, 
is coming rapidly. Formerly the Supervisor 
was frightened to death to make demands for 
fear of losing his position. Now there are scores, 
perhaps hundreds, of Supervisors who not only 
know the strength of their contribution to the 
school-room system, but who have the courage 
and conviction to make their demands and to 
secure whatever form of equipment is necessary 
to their purposes. 
Where Supervisors have done fine grade 
teaching, have proved their value to school and

work to the level of any other subject in the 
system. Where they have hesitated to demand. 
necessary time, material, and assistance; where 
they have shown themselves content to take 
what they could get to work with, they have 
failed to a degree of significant accomplishment, 
and on the basis of such an attitude they al- 
ways will fail. 
Gradually music supervision is attracting to 
its training schools a higher and higher type 
of student. Men are beginning to consider it 
a profession worthy of a man’s time and serious 
purposes. The college-trained man and woman 
are more frequently met with in training classes 
for Supervisors. Normal schools are, little by 
little, placing more emphasis on music for the 
simple reason that they see more and more 
clearly that its demand is becoming general. 
In the decade to come many changes will take 
place in supervision and in the supervising body. 
Better prepared and more highly educated 
teachers will appear. The old assumption that 
anyone who knows a little about music will do 
for school music teaching will entirely disappear. 
Supervisors will be subjected, as they are now 
in certain institutions, to a high degree of indi- 
vidual training. They will be judged on the 
basis of this training, and to some extent on 
their power of organization and administration. 
Superintendents will, in the course of their
-P-A-G-E-183
  TEACHING AS PUBLIC SERVICE 183 
training, learn more about music than they have 
hitherto; and in consequence they will work 
co-operatively and with deeper insight with the 
Supervisor. 
We may look, too, for the discussion and per- 
haps, to some extent, the decision as to what 
constitutes a fair salaryfor musicwork in schools. 
But it must forever remain true that the one 
final arbiter of salaries is the individual’s train- 
ing, attainment, and fitness for his position. 
When a Supervisor is interested merely in the 
express speed of his schedule, in fulfilling the 
text of his contract, but in doing no more than 
that, he will be found a very dear encumbrance. 
The Supervisor who works: enthusiastically, 
whose day is given over to delivering his best 
individual service, irrespective of hours of labor, 
can ultimately fix his own salary. This, how- 
ever, must always lie within the reasonable 
limits of the value of his order of service in the 
complex of which it isa unit. This (the relative 
service value) must constantly be kept in mind 
in relation to financial recompense. Probably 
not many cities and towns in the United States 
are paying as much for school music as they can 
afford. Some Supervisors are drawing more 
than they are worth or ever will be worth. But, 
on the other hand, there are numerous large 
municipalities paying astonishingly small sala- 
ries for the amount and quality of service they 
are securing from the music director.
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 “THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
This question of salary is one that deserves 
all the consideration the various Supervisors’ 
Associations can give it. Ina sense the amount 
of salary is not wholly or exactly a local matter; 
as for instance, where a city of nearly five hun- 
dred thousand inhabitants pays its music di- - 
rector, or Supervisor, less than $2,500. Cer- - 
tainly, in this case, the city has not reached its 
limit. Its Supervisor is either under-paid or 
over-paid; but he is certainly not justly paid. 
Supervisors, as a class of teachers, will de- 
termine and reach a more satisfactory level of 
payment for service when they lend their united 
effort to determine these conditions: 
1. A minimum attainment for professional 
training for those who propose to specialize 
in music in small communities. 
2. For Supervisors who add high schools 
to their program. 
8. For those who teach in the grades exclu- 
sively, using the grade teacher to the minimum. 
4. For those who organize and prepare a 
music faculty for each grade of the school sys- 
tem. 
And so on, through the various classifications 
possible to work, organized as school work is. 
Furthermore, Supervisors must persistently 
hammer home to Superintendents, principals, 
and others the logical place of music in the cur- 
riculum, its value in cultural terms to the child. 
In brief, they must go forth into the educational 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  TEACHING AS PUBLIC SERVICE 185 
world as missionaries who carry a message of 
importance. They may present their claims 
on behalf of music along many lines. Music 
is, for example, as valuable mental training as 
any other subject is. It is superior to many. 
It demands more in terms of self-expression than 
them all. It is one of the few studies that con- 
stitutes a valuable vocation. Therefore, it is 
a utilitarian subject. The humblest singer of 
one song can give pleasure to others while the 
finest speller in the world remains entirely un- 
entertaining. 
Therefore, music is useful in terms of happi- 
ness. It offers an infinite opportunity for ac- 
tion and accumulation to the type of mind that 
loves to obtain information; a single dictionary 
of music is obtainable of approximately four 
thousand double column pages. Here is infor- 
mation for the most gluttonous. 
And above it all, through it all, in it all, for- 
ever and forever, breathes the spirit of beauty. 
Let the Supervisor meet the educator and be 
not ashamed to say to him: 
“T believe in beauty as the manifestation of 
triumphant life. I believe in looking for Beauty 
everywhere; watching for it, searching for it 
in the great and in the small, in the unusual and 
in the commonplace things of this wonderful 
world. I believe in working for Beauty always; 
planning for it, trying for it in the making of 
all that has to be made, and in the doing of all
-P-A-G-E-186
  186 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
that has to be done. I believe in living the 
Beautiful life: a life in right relation to the lives 
of others, and in harmony with the eternally 
unfolding life of God.* 
The Supervisor’s service is perhaps li con- 
cerned with the great extent of knowledge which 
is passed on from teacher to teacher than it is 
concerned with the spirit which animates it all. 
For, after all, teaching is primarily the art of 
awakening, forming, and directing inherent 
power. A speaker recently expressed an ele- 
vated standard of individual creed in these 
words: 
“Go forth to your labors, superior to disap- 
pointment, unshaken in your ideal of service, 
patient under misunderstanding, indifferent of 
the petty limitations of petty people. Do not 
lose your first enthusiasm. Remember that 
although you may meet many whom you may 
teach, you yourself have much to learn. 
“Teaching should be included among the 
most splendid occupations — when it is prac- 
tised by men and women whose dominant idea 
is devotion to the ideal of service. You cannot 
make the teaching profession fine by arguing 
about it. There is but one way. You must 
sanctify it by service.” +

CHAPTER XVIII 
Sruptes 1n Types op MInDEDNESS 
I. 
The Supervisor who refuses to become the 
mere purveyor of general information through 
music, whose interest is stimulated to the extent 
that he studies and records the tendency and 
attainment of the individual child in music, 
will meet with many puzzling problems. We 
have learned that there is a certain inter-relation 
for example, of adenoids, tonsils, monotones, 
tone-deafness, and the like. It is also becom- 
ing clear that we enter upon this phase of con- 
scious (earth) life equipped, it would seem in 
predetermined ways, to receive impressions 
from our environment, and to make impression 
upon that environment. 
The material of this chapter is offered to the 
Supervisor as a suggestion. It is hoped that 
he may be enabled through reading and appli- 
cation, the better to understand the child’s 
equipment; perhaps to strengthen it; certainly 
to observe it in action. 
All teachers become convinced even after 
limited experience that for every pupil there is 
an easiest way both for the acquirement of 
knowledge and for the expression of power. 
187
-P-A-G-E-188
  188 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
This way is rarely the same for any two pupils. 
Given identical opportunities, methods, and 
directions, equally gifted pupils become amaz- 
ingly different as sums total. What seemed 
equality in the beginning is found to be like 
apparently identical apple blossoms; yet we 
know one will produce a russet and the other a 
yellow fruit. 
Manifestly to teach music to the individual’s 
best advantage, we should know from contribu- 
tory evidence what kind of fruit is latent within 
the blossom; and above all, we should not try 
to make the russet apple blossom yield a yellow 
fruit. What we must do is to seek ways for 
the production of the most perfect fruit of each 
after its kind. 
This chapter offers a few suggestions not in 
the slightest degree empirical, but as stimulating 
positive study and inquiry on the part of the 
teacher, which shall reveal facts of real value. 
One day we may be able to establish some fun- 
damentals of music education that will allow 
us to build our house upon a rock and not upon 
the shifting sands of one method for all. 
Let it be understood that the aim is to dis- 
cover the strong individual characteristics; to 
work with them as positive factors; likewise to 
discover weaknesses and to strengthen them 
to whatever extent is possible. 
It must further be understood that the 
Supervisor will find these tests of some value
-P-A-G-E-189
  STUDIES IN TYPES OF MINDEDNESS 189 
when he applies them to himself and to the 
individuals of his assisting corps. 
Il. 
We do not store up actual thoughts. Wha 
we do is to increase our thought tendency. 
Thought tendency is probably the one single 
process that characterizes (the mind in) each 
of us. It is the individualizing process. 
The mind finds its major functioning tendency 
along one or more main lines of operation. If 
the teacher will make a careful study of his 
pupils he will find that they may be classified 
in many practical ways as to what we shall call 
“ mindedness.” 
For example, one is found to be distinctly of 
the tendency to receive impressions through 
the ear. He is ear-minded. 
Another is most strongly impressed by outer 
phenomena through the eyes. He is eye- 
minded. 
Here, then, are two ways of receiving im- 
pressions (that is thoughts pressing in). Con- 
versely here is a pupil whose best effort results 
when the entire muscular and nervous systems 
are willed into activity. He is motor-minded. 
A second finds the hand to be his best trunk 
line for despatching his commands and inten- 
tions. He is hand-minded. Here are two of 
many possible orders of expression (that is 
thoughts pressing out).
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
A few concrete examples are presented here 
for the purpose of suggesting to the teacher to 
become thoroughly acquainted with the pupil 
to the end that the thought tendency may be 
used to his greatest advantage. The desirable 
end is that he shall be taught in such manner 
that impressions enter along his best line of 
communication, that his expressions go out over 
similar lines; that weak lines be strengthened. 
Case No. 1. Boy age seventeen, unusually 
gifted as pianist. Technic fluent and perma- 
nently established. Has absolute pitch. Hand- 
and ear-minded. Disinclined to do gymnastic 
work. In no sense motor-minded. (That is 
of the whole body.) In writing notes on music 
paper constantly writes C sharpfor Dflat. The 
eye does not distinguish differences where the ear 
impression is not fixed. Reads slowly at sight; 
in writing notes is inexact in the effort to locate 
them on a line or space. Hence, not at all eye- 
minded. 
In music theory work takes in suggestions 
by oral instruction, but gets little or no help in 
attempting to read from books. This boy 
would fail in a written examination; whereas 
he could’pass a more severe test and pass it well 
if it were given to him orally. 
Case No. 2. A young man of twenty- 
three; earns his living by doing stenographic 
work (typewriting), plays the violin as a pastime, . 
and is preparing in some lines of civil service
-P-A-G-E-191
  
STUDIES IN TYPES OF MINDEDNESS 191 
work. His facility in operating a typewriter 
machine is considerable; that is he writes rapidly 
and generally correctly. But a typewritten page 
as it comes from his hands is seldom satisfactory 
to his client. It is invariably smudged and its 
appearance is not attractive, for he has no gift 
of alignment or spacing, and his use of capital 
letters is original. 
But he can tell by the click of the machine 
where it is out of order. His sense of pitch in 
violin playing is good, but his interpretation of 
music sounds just about as his typewritten page 
looks. He is the least eye-minded person of any 
I have seen. I asked him how he was getting 
along with his civil service test and he said, “ I'll 
never make it.” And of course he will not, 
because he is not in the slightest degree eye- 
minded; but oral instruction or an oral test 
would, no doubt, pass him. 
Case No. 3. Man of thirty, loves music, 
owns a violin and is very fond of trying to play 
the piano. A good all-round athlete; that is, 
motor-minded. Can row a boat, use carpen- 
ters’ tools, steer an automobile, and play ball. 
Hence, hand-minded as a whole. But he uses 
his fingers awkwardly. Hence, while hand- 
minded, he is not finger-minded. Sings well 
(a motor activity). Has never learned to read 
notes and he is not eye-minded. 
Case No. 4. Boy of eighteen. No music 
talent. His playing gives actual offense, for
-P-A-G-E-192
  192 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
he intrudes wrong notes without any distress 
to himself. Receives oral instruction with the 
greatest difficulty. His greatest joy in music 
seems to be to make symbols on music paper. 
This he does in the most elaborate and florid 
manner, so that a page coming from his hand is 
a work of art, but the music of which the page 
consists is as riotous in meaning as a futurist’s 
program. He is decidedly hand-minded, but 
should not study music. Would make an ex- 
cellent music engraver or sign painter. He will 
have to receive all directions for business in 
writing as he does not receive impressions 
quickly or accurately by ear. He would be a 
failure as a telephone operator. 
These few cases indicate tendencies, some 
positive, some negative; but from them we may 
deduce a few practical principles which will aid 
us in the training of pupils. 
These principles should enable us to discover 
ways and means for strengthening the minor 
faculties and fully developing the major. They 
will shed some light upon operations involved 
in sight reading, dictation, and music memory. 
In short, with what has to do with sight and 
sound involved in music. They should further 
lead us into the closest scrutiny and continued 
observation of the familiar operations involved 
in music. The observation has often been 
made that a talented pianist is not necessarily 
a capable sight reader. The explanation of
-P-A-G-E-193
  STUDIES IN TYPES OF MINDEDNESS 193 
this is simple: a pianist may be highly ear- 
minded, hand-and finger-minded, and yet to 
no considerable extent eye-minded. 
It becomes necessary then to determine what 
we have just referred to as the major trunk 
lines of mindedness, and to make the most of 
them; but it makes it equally necessary that 
we should determine the direction and the 
strength of minor lines, modify and increase 
them. 
Even the casual consideration of a few types 
will convince one that a particular form of 
mindedness, that of the ear for example, does not 
imply a like degree of receptive and expressive 
power over all the phenomena involved. 
For example, a certain musician of unusual 
endowment is rapidly ear-minded as to music, 
receiving it spontaneously; but he isso slowly 
ear-minded as to speech that it is almost pathetic 
to observe his effort to receive and interpret 
words by translating them into mental images. 
I have noted another case of a man fond of 
music in a degree who receives it slowly; that 
is, as if he could not handle it without stopping 
to consider and examine before he accepted it. 
But on the other hand,he receives words through 
the ear, resolves them immediately into their 
images and all without betraying any inter- 
regnum between sensation and comprehension. 
The following fact seems to be true: An eye- 
minded person strives to make visible symbols
-P-A-G-E-194
  194 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
audible. That is, an eye-minded person will 
learn to read music at sight readily, but he may 
be very slow and inefficient in music dictation; 
while an ear-minded person may be skilful at 
dictation and yet have much trouble not only 
with sight reading but with visualizing a staff 
picture of tones easily grasped by the ear. 
It seems to be true for music students that 
the way to build up the weaker faculty is 
through the stronger. For example, the fol- 
lowing phrase may be sensed in many different 
ways, that is, it may be reached out for by one 
of several tentacles: 
  For example: 
1. A pianist may receive it purely along the 
tactual line. As he looks at the notes he will 
move the fingers upon an imaginary keyboard 
striving to secure the audible impression. 
2. An eye-minded singer will hum the phrase 
through and by that act build up the tone mes- 
sage as the reading proceeds. That is, he may 
not (and generally does not) perceive it as a 
whole before he begins to read. 
8. An ear-minded person, let us say without 
technical skill, might find the notation of this 
more or less of a puzzle and would require that
-P-A-G-E-195
  STUDIES IN TYPES OF MINDEDNESS 195 
some one pass the tones to him, so to speak, by 
means he himself cannot command. This ac- 
counts for the rapidity with which the boy of the 
street appropriates, and generally perfectly, the 
melody and rhythm of the latest popular song; 
however complex it may be. 
These are by no means the only ways by 
which human beings translate music notation 
into actual vital music. But they will suffice to 
show us that unless we are “all around’’-minded 
in music there is much land for us to possess; 
not curiously, but to our benefit. 
Again, for example: The pianist who invari- 
ably moves the fingers on an imaginary key- 
board when looking over a new composition, 
may be eye- or ear-minded or both. If heis 
neither to any considerable degree, the in- 
voluntary play of the fingers represents his 
tentacle-groping for something on which to lay 
hold.- He perceives that in his fingers there has 
been built up a tendency which actually un- 
locks sound for him. 
The pianist with this habit should read music 
with the voice (even humming it will suffice) until 
he eliminates the finger motion or joins to it the 
ability to make the visible sign become the au- 
dible effect. The ultimate aim must be to 
perfect audible reaction. 
The ear-minded person who is a slow or poor 
sight reader should sound or play such little 
tone groups as these and then immediately close
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
the eyes to visualize the written expression in as- 
sociation with the audible: — 
  This is ideally supplied as training in music 
dictation. Many people are quite convinced 
that they have the gift of composition; but being 
unable to write down the classics that surge 
through the brain, they are as if hid under a 
bushel. The hand and eye do not come to the 
assistance of the creative faculty that manifests 
through the sense of hearing. These types 
must visualize the staff, must choose a given 
starting point, say second line G, and actually 
see it, not necessarily as a note but as a staff 
degree. Then they must improvise melodies, 
visualizing the staff as they select its pitches. 
In brief they must learn to improvise on the 
staff visible to them as a mental image. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  CHAPTER XIX 
Books FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
I. 
The deeper meanings which we are reading 
into school music imply a broader preparation. 
The Supervisor must interest himself in a wider 
area of educational and humanitarian topics. 
He must be able to do many things, be familiar 
with many subjects related to music and con- 
tingent upon its domain. While formerly sight 
reading was held to be more or less the end and 
aim of all public school music instruction, today 
it is but an incidental factor. It is not sufficient 
for the child to be able to spell his do, re, mi. 
He must become skilled in music as a language 
to be expressed; this involves ear and eye, hand 
and voice and heart. The eye is for reading; 
the ear for tone discrimination; the hand for 
writing; the voice for the enunciation of tonal 
beauty; and the heart for the love of it all. 
These factors making for effort and subse- 
quent attainment act and react to produce 
music-mind. The Supervisor who is to develop 
all these lines of music sensitiveness and skill 
must be broadly prepared. We have indicated 
some topics that must come before him; and 
we have suggested somewhat the degree of his 
197
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
mastery in music theory, composition, har- 
mony, counterpoint, history, and biography. 
The texts mentioned in this chapter are a group 
from which he may profitably select many a 
volume which, when rightly used, will become a 
veritable tool or implement in his professional 
work. As a group, they will serve to give him 
that background of power which will make his 
teaching at once authoritative and abundantly 
interesting. 
The Supervisor will find that in addition to his 
direct influence as a leader of the teachers who 
develop technical skill in the child, he may add 
to this, and for their sakes, an abundance of 
inspiration which will enrich the child’s music 
world. The child will learn to love music, 
but no less will he learn to find in the story of 
its heroes as thorough inspiration and as wide 
variety of biographical interests as he finds in 
the lives of Washington, Franklin, Lincoln, and 
the heroes of invention and discovery. 
Before we list the texts of this chapter, a few 
words about Books and Reading may not be 
inappropriate, particularly as they may offer 
suggestions which the Supervisor can pass on 
as he finds it necessary: 
( A book is a formal expression of somebody’s 
experience. It is a report of what someone 
has observed, thought, felt, performed.) To a 
degree, even fiction may be so summarized. 
Every writer who knows the primary essentials 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
BOOKS FOR THE SUPERVISOR 199 
of his craft is impelled to write out of the im- 
pulse of feeling, which stimulates thought, 
which, in turn, impels to action; and lastly, 
these three influences cause to come forth the 
final factor, result, or the finished written 
product. Now the first factor, feeling, is ac- 
companied more or less vaguely by mental 
pictures; in turn it passes over to thought the 
mental pictures which come into clearer and 
clearer outline. 
It is these mental pictures that the author 
strives, with inspiration and skill, to fix in words. 
So far as he is capable of doing it, he must 
make English words actually produce for the 
reader the brilliant pageantry of his thought. 
That is, he must be so skilled in his craft, his 
knowledge of his material must be so intimate, 
that with the proper co-operation of the reader 
the brilliancy of the picture in his (the author’s) 
mind shall reflect to the reader’s mind without 
loss. 
A writer of true feeling, whose thought process 
is well under control, who acts directly and with 
a high degree of skill and of art, is the one who 
can most truly be said to perform a really 
wonderful creative act. Much of the current 
printed matter of the day, however, gives little 
or no evidence of the art and method of the 
true author. It calls therefore for little skill 
on the part of the reader. The necessity for 
furnishing entertainment for the people must 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  200 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
account for the mass of printed matter that is 
not literature, and the desire for quasi-enter- 
tainment of the most fleeting order must ac- 
count for a scheme of reading that has neither 
depth nor purpose. 
The skill of the true author, his process of 
fixing his experience, of conveying his message 
in words so that he who runs may read, de- 
mands on the part of the reader a degree of 
ability that must rise in kind to that of the 
creative author himself. Hence it is far above 
the average of reading capacity and, like all pro- 
cesses connected with the attainment of skill in 
music or in any other art, is a technic distinctly 
to be cultivated. To make clear the process of 
transfer, or of reflection of the mental picture 
from the author to the reader, let us embody it 
in the following statements: 
1. The author’s experience stimulatesfeeling, 
brings into play mental imagery which is fixed 
in words in the pages of a book. 
2. The reader must peer into the author’s 
words until the pictures they hold flash (re- 
flect) upon his own mind. 
These are complementary processes. They 
suggest the very evident fact that a careful writer 
is worthy of a careful reader. A careless reader 
is unworthy of any author; for by the very fact 
of his carelessness he will misinterpret, mis- 
quote, and misrepresent him. There is no 
subject in all the school and college curriculum
-P-A-G-E-201
  BOOKS FOR THE SUPERVISOR 201 
more worthy of the serious attention of educa- 
tors than this simple yet masterly technic of 
gaining exact information from a sentence 
written by a careful thinker. There is doubtless 
no subject in all education so little thought about 
as the art of reading. Every teacher must be 
on his guard against inefficient reading and 
the inefficient reader. By virtue of the rapidity 
of his methods and their inaccuracies, the 
inefficient reader not only misconstrues an 
author’s meaning, but he acts upon his own 
misconstruction; that is, he makes the error of 
his interpretation the cause of his activity. 
So prevalent is the habit of half-reading or of 
wrongly reading a text that most of us will find 
in it, if we look deeply enough, the one lack of 
general advancement in training and culture. 
The enormous spread of the product of the 
printing press has robbed us of our skill by sub- 
jecting us to the spell of its might. We have 
literally to be on guard against the temptation 
of its riches. 
One of the tasks the Supervisor must take 
upon himself is that of being teacher and 
apostle of true reading. Unless he enlists this art 
as one of his resources, he will find his ends de- 
feated through inaccuracies. With himself he 
must insist on learning how to secure one hun- 
dred per cent of the author’s meaning, of secur- 
ing, when possible, one hundred per cent of the 
meaning of a person who addresses him; of in-
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 THE MUSIC SUPERVISOR 
sisting that his staff of assistants and associates 
shall get from him, as speaker or author of writ- 
ten assignments, one hundred per cent of exact 
direction and information. All this, easy tosay, 
is no easy matter to perform. And whenever 
he can he must urge upon others, assistants, 
pupils, and friends, the cultivation of sincerity 
in all reading. 
To the average reader it is difficult to do the 
patient, plodding apprentice work necessary to 
relearn the reading art, which as little children 
we once possessed. Witness the hours when we 
were filled with delight at the pictures that 
leaped up in the consciousness as we followed the 
wonderful adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Little 
Nell, Paul Dombey, and all the heroes of that 
time of romance. But as we grow older there 
is thrust upon us more reading matter than 
we can honestly investigate: the daily papers 
(morning and evening), countless magazines, 
weeklies, monthlies, books in scores and hun- 
dreds, all overwhelm us like an Alpine avalanche. 
In our desire to give a little to it all we become 
dishonest readers; dishonest to the author in 
skimming where we should penetrate; dishonest 
to ourselves in taking skimmings for real depth 
of meaning. 
If the reader of these pages has never perused 
Ruskin’s essay, entitled Of King’s Treasuries, 
he has a delightful experience in store. No 
one has ever told so perfectly and so well just

what a book is and what it may do for us. No 
one has ever insisted so sternly on what we must 
do for a book. What duty and service we owe 
it are only complementary to the treasures it 
holds for us. Prefatory to any reading de- 
manding serious thought and attention should 
come the learning of the lesson so admirably 
presented in Sesame and Lilies.

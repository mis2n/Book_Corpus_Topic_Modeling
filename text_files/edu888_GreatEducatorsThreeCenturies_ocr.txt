PREFACE . | t 
[ Ir has now come to be understood that a series of essays 
upon the educational reformers cannot by any stretch 
: of the imagination be termed a ‘history of education.’ 
: The biographical and personal details must be subordi- 
4 nated and brought into perspective, and a suitable his- - 
torical and philosophical connection given a work, before 
- it can be so dignified. The present volume, therefore, © 
is not intended to be a continuation of my History of 
| Education before the Middle Ages and my treatment of 
the Middle Ages and the Transition to Modern Times. 
To a certain extent it duplicates material toward the 
end of the latter volume, and it largely anticipates my 
History of Education in Modern Times, but the nature 
and purpose of the present work are quite different. 
T have felt that an account of the life and work of the 
_ men who, during the past three centuries, have intro- 
duced various innovations and reforms into modern 
education might contain interest and value for many 
who would never read a more comprehensive and unified 
production. I have, however, made some attempt as 
well to present the social setting of each reformer. 
Moreover, although the facts of biography are narrated 
somewhat at length, an effort has been made to elimi-

nate everything that does not seem to have some bear 
ing upon the contributions of the educator unde 
consideration or upon the, spread and permanence o 
his work. Such a treatment, I venture to hope, wil 
prove of service to the general reader and to th 
student of educational origins whose time is lim- 
ited. The volume may be used as a reference work, 
a reading circle book, or even as a text for classes that 
are not in condition to cope with the complexities of 
modern educational history. The worth of the book 
for any of these purposes has probably been heightened 
by a liberal quotation from the sources in the body of 
the text and the addition of supplementary readings at 
the end of each chapter. 
This work is largely an outgrowth of my lectures be- 
fore extension classes, teachers’ institutes, and other 
informal gatherings in the states of Missouri and ‘Ohio. 
I have, no doubt, unconsciously received much help 
from those who have listened to me upon these occasions, | 
and have made bold to dedicate the book to them. 
More direct assistance, however, has been received from 
my friends, Professors Jesse H. Coursault of the Univer- 
sity of Missouri, Arthur J. Jones of the University of 
Maine, and Edward O. Sisson of the University of 
Washington, and from my wife, Helen Wadsworth 
Graves.

CHAPTER I 
JOHN MILTON AND HIS ‘ACADEMY’ 
Iw the popular mind the name of John Milton (1608- 
1674) is associated only with the great epic, Paradise 
Lost. Scholars and literary men include a wider range 
of his poetry within their vision, and recognize a large 
difference between the products of his youthful period 
and those of his enriched maturity. But between these 
stages comes a period as a prose writer and pamphleteer, 
which, while little known even to the student ‘of litera- 
ture, has made Milton one of the interesting figures in 
education. The great poet was a stanch Puritan, and, 
} during this middle stage of his career, several vigorous 
pamphlets of protest fell from his pen. He wrote upon 
_ the freedom of the press, the tenure of kings, religious 
toleration, and against the episcopacy. At this time, 
also, he undertook as part of his reforms to contribute 
to educational theory and to the improvement. of the 
schools themselves. He conducted a boarding school 
throughout his thirties, and the T vractate of Education 
B rt Milton was a 
pamphleteer 
and a school- 
master, as 
well as apoet, 
and wrote a 
Tractate of 
Education.

(z644) is an outgrowth of his practical experience as 
schoolmaster. 
Milton’s Opposition to the Formal Humanism 
Although he came somewhat later in th: 
of education, Milton is to be classed amo: 
‘innovators’! who were endeavoring to in*--~---- - 
broader humanism in the place of the narroy 
nianism’ into which the educational produ 
Renaissance had hardened. Instead of the restriction! 
to words and set forms, they advocated a study of 
the ideas, or ‘real things,’ of which the words were the 
symbols. This emphasis upon the content of the clas- 
sics, which has usually been known as ‘humanistic’ 
realism, is especially noticeable in Milton. With it often 
went the study of social and physical phenomena, in 
order to throw light upon the meaning of the passages 
under consideration. There seemg also to have been 
an attempt to adapt education to actual living in a real 
world and to prepare young people for the concrete duties 
of life, and it was usually suggested that the breadth of 
view necessary for this could be obtained best through 
1Qther innovators were Rabelais, Montaigne, Mulcaster, etc. See 
Graves, History of Education during the Transition, Chap. XVII. 
Because of the nature of his educational position, Milton is treated here | 
before Bacon, Ratich, and Comenius, although he follows them in point | 
of time. |

travel under the care of a tutor or by residence in a for- 
eign school. This latter tendency, which appears to 
some extent in Milton’s Tractate, may be called ‘social’ 
| realism. However, while one element or the other may 
seem to be more prominent in a certain treatise, these 
_ two phases of education are largely bound up in each 
other, and both tendencies are evident in most re- 
formers of the times. They seem to be but two sides 
of the same thing and to constitute together a natural 
bridge from the humanism of the later Renaissance to 
the ‘sense realism’ of the seventeenth century. 
The Tractate of Education is an admirable illustration 
of this broader humanism. While a remarkable classi- 
‘cist himself, Milton objects to the usual humanistic edu- 
cation with its “(grammatic flats and shallows where 
they stuck unreasonably to learn a few words with lamen- The Tractate 
of Education 
opposes the

manism, 
table construction,” and declares that the boys “do for 
the most part grow into hatred and contempt of learning.” 
He claims that “we do amiss to-spend seven or eight 
years in scraping together so much miserable Latin and 
Greek as might be learned otherwise easily and delight- 
fully in one year.” He especially stigmatizes, as Locke 
did ifr, the formal work in Latin composition, “forcing 
the empty wits of children to compose themes, verses, 
and orations, which are the acts of ripest judgment and 
the final work of a head filled by long reading and ob- 
serving.” .

objects. Eyén in his recommendation of a most en

.it is an education of books, and the enormous load of 
languages — Italian, Hebrew, Chaldee, and Syriac, as 
well as Latin and Greek, — together with mathematics, 
sciences, and other studies, would make such a course 
impossible, except, as some one has said, for a ‘college 
f Miltons.’ 
    His Broad Definition of Education 
As with some of the other humanistic realists, notably 
Montaigne, Milton also would have considerable time 
given, toward the end of the course, to the social sciences, 
such as history, ethics, politics, economics, and theology, 
-and to such practical training as would ‘bring one in 
‘ouch with life. He likewise advocates the experience 
| and knowledge that would come from travel in England 
‘and abroad. Thus, in the place of the usual restricted 
conception of humanistic education, Milton would sub- 
‘stitute a genuine study and understanding of the clas- 
‘sical authors and a real preparation for life. While at 
first he piously declares that the aim of learning is “to 
repair the ruins of our first parents by regaining to 
know God aright,” he is more specific later when he 
frames his famous definition : — | :

“I call therefore a complete and generous educationsthat which 
fits a man to perform justly, skilfully, and magnanimously all 
the offices both private and public of peace and war.” and much

earning a livelihood, and at the same time of furnishing 
higher education to the young dissenters who were ex- 
cluded from the universities and ‘grammar’! schools. 
The first of these academies was that established by 
Richard Frankland at Rathmill in 1665, and this was 
followed by the institutions of John Woodhouse at 
§ Sheriffhales, of Charles Morton at Newington Green, 
and of some thirty other educators of whom we have 
record. While these academies usually followed the 
humanistic realism of Milton, and, since their chief func- 
tion was to fit for the ministry, included Latin, Greek, 
; and Hebrew in their course, they were also rich in sci- 
| ences, mathematics, and the social sciences, and the 
vernacular was especially emphasized ? The new tend- 
ency was also broadened and amplified by the writ- 
ings of Locke, whose Thoughts * became the great guide 
for the managers of the Puritan academies. In 1689, 
when the Act of Toleration put nonconformity upon a 
legal footing, the academies were allowed to be regularly 
incorporated. 
So in America, when, by the middle of the eighteenth 
century, the number of religious denominations had 
greatly increased and the demands upon secondary

would gladly have excluded the languages altogether 
and made the course completely realistic, but for politic 
reasons he made these subjects elective. His academy 
was opened at Philadelphia in 1751, and similar institu- 
tions sprang up rapidly through the other colonies during 
the latter half of the eighteenth century. . Shortly after 
the Revolution, partly owing to the inability or the un- 
willingness of the towns or the counties to maintain gram- 
mar schools, the academy quite eclipsed these institutions, 
and became for a time the representative type of second- 
ary school in the United States.?

classics composed the chief part of the curriculum. They had been bor-

colonists. See Graves, History of Education during the Transition,

new discoveries in science and inventions were made, 
and philosophy began to base itself upon reason and the 
senses. Kepler made it possible. to search the heavens, 
Galileo reorganized the science of physics, and an air 
pump was invented by Guericke. This scientific progress 
was accompanied on the philosophic side by the rational- 
ism of Descartes and the empiricism of Locke. The 
educational theorists, as a result, began to introduce 
science and a knowledge of real things into the curricu- 
lum. It was felt that humanism gave a knowledge only 
of words, books, and opinions, and did ‘not even at its: 
best lead to a study of real things. Hence new methods 
and new books were produced, to shorten and improve 
the study of the classical languages, and new content 
was imported into the courses of study. The movement 
would even seem to include some attempt at a formula- 
tion of scientific principles in education. 
Bacon’s New Method 
_ The new tendency, however, did not appear in educa- 1 
tion until after the time of Francis Bacon (1561-1626). 
The use of the scientific method by the various discoverers 
was largely unconscious, and it remained for Bacon to 
formulate what he called the method of ‘induction,’ 
and, by advocating its use, to point the way to its devel- 
opment as a scientific theory of education. He is, there- 
fore, ordinarily known as the first sense realist. Accord- hecena :

ing to Dr. Rawley, his biographer, Bacon, while still at 
the University of Cambridge, conceived a disgust fo 
Aristotle’s philosophy as it was then taught. At am 
rate, it is known that even during the busiest part of his 
public career he undertook in sporadic works to combat 
the Aristotelian method, and to:form a new procedure 
on the basis of the scientific discoveries of the day. Not 
until 1620, however, did he publish his great treatise on 
inductive reasoning called Novum Organum (‘new in- 
strument’) in opposition to Aristotle’s work on deduc- 
tion. In behalf of his treatise ‘Bacon argues that, 
as the hand is helpless without the right tool to aid 
it, so the human intellect is inefficient when it does not 
possess its proper instrument or method, and, in his 
opinion, all men are practically equal in attaining com- 
plete knowledge and truth, if they will but use the 
mode of procedure that he describes. This new method 
of seeking knowledge he contrasts with that in vogue, 
as follows: — 
“There are and can be only two ways of searching into and 
discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars 
to the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth 
of which it takes for settled and immovable, proceeds to judg- 
ment and the discovery of middle axioms. And this way is now 
in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and par- 
ticulars, rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives 
at the mst general axioms last of all. This is the true way, but 
as ye untried.” :

, BACON AND THE INDUCTIVE METHOD. 13 
Hence, Bacon would begin with particulars, rather than 
use the @ priori reasoning of the syllogism, as advocated 
by the schoolmen under the impression that this was the 
method of Aristotle. Before, however, one’s observa- rust, how. 
tions can be accurately made; Bacon felt it would be mast divest 
necessary to divest oneself of certain false and ill-defined Bimeelf at 
notions to which humanity is liable. The preconcep- Breconcep- 
tions of which it is necessary to be rid are his famous ‘idols’ 
‘idols.’. These he declares to be of four classes : — 
* “Jdols of the Tribe, which have their foundation in human 
nature itself; Idols of the Cave, for every one, besides the faults 
he shares with his race, has a cave or den of his own; Idols of 
the Market-place, formed by the intercourse and association of 
men with each other; and Idols of the Theatre, which have immi- 
grated into men’s minds from the various dogmas of philosophies 
and also from wrong laws of demonstration.” 
Nor should the new method end with a mere collection And one 
of particulars. This proceeding Bacon believes to be "in reticn 
useless and fully as dangerous-for science as to generalize lars. 
a priori, and holds that these two polar errors together 
account very largely for the ill success of science in the 
past. He declares:   
“Those who have handled sciences have been either men of 
experiment or men of dogmas. The men of experiment are like 
the ant; they only collect and use : ‘the reasoners resemble spiders ; 
who make cobwebs out of their substance. But the bee takes a 
middle course; it gathers its material from the flowers ci the

        garden and the field, but transforms and digests it by a pow 
of its own. Not unlike that is the true business of philosoph: 
for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mi 
nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural histo 
and mechanical experiments and lay it up in the memory whol 
as it finds it; but lays it up in the understanding altered an 
digested. Therefore, from a closer and purer league betwee 
these two faculties, the experimental and the rational (such 
has never yet been made), much may be hoped.” 
In the second book of the Novum Organum Bacon| 
begins, though he does not complete, a more definite 
statement of his method. : Briefly stated, his plan was, 
after ridding the mind of its prepossessions, to tabulate 
carefully lists of all the facts of nature. It seemed to 
him a comparatively easy task to make, through the 
codperation of scientific men, a complete accumulation 
of all thé facts of science. After these data were secured, 
the next step would be to discover the ‘ forms ’ of things, 
by which he means the underlying essence or law of each 
particular quality or simple nature. Such an abstrac- 
tion could be achieved by a process of comparing the 
cases where the quality appears and where it does not 
appear, and of excluding the instances that fall under 
both heads until some ‘form’ is clearly present only 
when the quality is. Then, as a proof, another list may 
be drawn up where the quality appears in different 
degrees and where the ‘form’ should vary corre- 
spondingly.

BACON AND THE INDUCTIVE METHOD 55 
‘ Salomon’s House’ and the Pansophic Course 
A description of what Bacon thinks may be expected 
when this scientific method is systematically carried out 
can be found in his fable of the New Adlantis. The in- 
habitants of this mythical island are described as having sh 
in the course of ages created a state in which ideal sani- 
tary, economic, political, and social conditions obtained. 
The most important institution of this society is its 
‘Salomon’s House,’ an organization in which the members 
devoted themselves to scientific research and invention, 
and in their supposed investigations Bacon anticipates 
much that scientists and inventors have to-day only just 
begun to realize. He represents these Utopian scientists 
as making all sorts of physical, chemical, astronomical, 
medical, and engineering experiments and. discoveries, 
including the artificial production of metals, the forcing 
of plants, grafting, and variation of species, the infusion 
of serums, vivisection, telescopes, microphones, tele- 
phones, flying-machines, submarine boats, steam-engines, _ 
and perpetual-motion machines. 
Bacon was not a teacher, and his treatment of educa- 
tigpak-problems appears i in brief and. scattered passages,.

Bacon prop- 
erly rejected the contem- 
@ priort 16 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
description of ‘Salomon’s House’ would seem to imply 
an interest in promoting scientific research and higher 
education at least, and a belief in such an organization 
of education that society might gradually accumulate 
a knowledge of nature and impart it to all pupils at every 
stage. Perhaps this is attributing too much to the great 
English philosopher, but such certainly was the plan of 
Ratich and Comenius, who later on worked out the Ba- 
conian theory in education, and this dream of pansophia 
(‘all-wisdom’) formed part of the educational creed of 
the later realists in general. Moreover, we know from 
the second book of his Advancement of Learning that 
Bacon ardently desired a reformation of the organization, 
content, and methods of higher education, and that 
among his suggestions for advancement were a wider 
course of study, more complete equipment for scientific 
investigation, a closer codperation among institutions 
of learning, and a forwarding of the ‘unfinished sciences.’ 
The Value of Bacon’s Method 
In estimating the method of Bacon, it is difficult to be

He reacted from the current view of Aristotle’s reason-’ 
| ing, and, taking his cue from the many scientific workers 
of his time, formulated a new method in opposition to 
what he mistook as the position of the great logician. 
He very properly rejected the contemporary method of 
' attempting to establish @ priori the first principles of a 
, Science, and then deduce from them by means of the 
syllogism all the propositions which that science could 
contain. But in endeavoring to create a method whereby 
any one could attain all the knowledge of which the human 
| mind’ was capable, he ‘undertook far too much. His 
effort to put all men on a level in reaching truth resulted 
in a most mechanical mode of procedure and neglected 
the part played by scientific imagination in the framing 
of hypotheses. Scientific method is not at present satis- 
| fied to hold, as Bacon did, ‘that because all observed cases 
under certain conditions produce a particular effect, 
every other instance not yet observed will necessarily 
have the same property or effect. “The modern procedure 
is rather that, when certain effects are observed, of which 
the cause or law is unknown, the scientist frames an 
hypothesis to account for them; then, by the process of 
deduction, tries this on the facts that he has collected ; 
and if the hypothesis is verified, maintains that he has 
discovered the cause or law. Yet this is only a more 
explicit statement of what has always been implied in 
every process of reasoning. The method had certainly

in attempt- 
ing to put all

cedure.

been used by the later Greek philosophers, and it, as 
well as the syllogism; had even been formulated by Aris- 
totle, although this part of his work was not known in 
Bacon’s day. 
Bacon cannot, therefore, really be said to have in- 
vented a new method It is also evident that he failed 
_to appreciate the work of Aristotle and the function of 
genius in scientific discovery. But he did largely put 
an end to the existing process of @ priori reasoning, and 
he did call attention to the necessity of careful experi- 
mentation and induction. Probably no book ever made 
a greater revolution in modes of thinking or overthrew 
more prejudices than Bacon’s Novum Organum. It 
represents a culmination in the reaction that had been 
growing up through the Renaissance, the Reformation, 
and the earlier realism. 
As far as education is concerned, Bacon, while not 
skilled or greatly interested in the work himself, influ- 
enced profoundly the writing and practice of -many who 
were, and has done much to shape the spirit of modern 
education. ‘ His method was first applied directly to 
education by a German known as Ratich, and, in a more — 
effective way, by Comenius, a Motavian. |

RATICH AND HIS EDUCATIONAL CLAIMS 
Wolfgang von Ratke (1571-1635), generally called 
Ratich from an abbreviation of his Latinized name} 
was born in Wilster, Holstein, and first studied for the 
ministry at the University of Rostock. Later, he con- 
tinued his studies in England, where he probably became 
acquainted with the work of Bacon. Before long, realiz- 
ing that he had an incurable defect in speech which 
would keep him from success in the pulpit, he decided 
to devote himself to educational reform. He planned to 
apply the principles of Bacon to the problems of education 
in general, but he intended especially to reform the meth- 
ods of language teaching. 
Ratich’s Attempts at School Reform 
In 1612 Ratich memorialized the imperial diet, while 
it was sitting at Frankfurt, and asked for an investiga- 
tion of his methods. Two professors from the University 
of Giessen were commissioned to examine his propositions, 
and afterward the University of Jena similarly had four

however, on the strength of such reports, the town coun- 
cil of Augsburg gave him control of the schools of that 
- city, he was not able to justify his claims, and the ar- 
Tangement was abandoned at the end of a year. Having 
appealed to the diet again without encouragement, 
Ratich began traveling from place to -place, trying to 
interest various princes or cities in his system. He was 
befriended by Dorothea, Duchess of Weimar, who in- 
duced her brother, Prince Ludwig of Anhalt-Kéthen, to 
provide a school for Ratich. This institution was fur- 
nished with an expensive equipment, including a large 
printing plant; a set of teachers that had been trained 
in the Ratichian methods and sworn to secrecy, were 
engaged; and some five hundred school children of 
Kéthen were started on this royal road to learning. The 
experiment lasted only eighteen months, and, largely 
owing to Ratich’s inexperience as a schoolmaster, was a 
dismal failure. The prince was so enraged at his pe- 
cuniary loss and the ridiculous light in which he was 
placed that he threw the unhappy reformer into prison, 
and released him at the end of three months only upon 
his signing a statement that he had undertaken more His attempts

than he could perform. After this, Ratich tried his hand ~

of theological differences, and then was enabled to pre-

religion, and government. As Ratich stated the 
claims seemed decidedly extravagant, but as f 
expected to carry them out, they were but the 
aims of an education based upon realism and 
conian method.

| become somewhat known.’ In linguistic training he 
| insisted, like all realists, that one “should first study the 
| vernacular” as an introduction to other languages. He 
also held to the principle of “one thing at a time and 
- often repeated.” By this he meant that, in studying a 
language, one should master a single book. At K&then, 
as soon as the-children knew their letters, they were 
required to learn Genesis thoroughly for the sake of their 
_ German. Each chapter was read twice by the teacher, 
while the pupils followed the text with their finger. 
When they could read the book perfectly, they were 
taught grammar from it as a text. The teacher pointed 
out the various parts of speech and made the children 
find other examples, and then had them decline, con- 
jugate and parse. In taking up Latin, a play of Ter- 
ence was used in a similar fashion. A translation was 
-read to the pupils several times before they were shown 
the original; then the Latin was translated to them from 
the text; next, the class was drilled in grammar; and 
finally, the boys were required to turn German sentences 
into Latin after the style of Terence. This method may 
have produced a high degree of concentration, but it was 
liable to result in monotony and want ‘of interest, unless 
skilfully administered. 
Another formulation of Ratich’s, whereby he ‘insisted

His Educational Infiuence 
Thus Ratich not only helped shape some of the best 
methods for teaching languages, but he also anticipated 
many of the main principles of modern pedagogy. In 
carrying out his ideas, however, he was uniformly un- 
successful. This was somewhat due to his charlatan 
method of presentation, but more because of errors in 
his principles, his want of training and experience as a 
teacher, and the impatience, jealousy, and conservatism 
of others. He must have been regarded by his contem- 
poraries in general as a complete failure, whenever they 
contrasted his promises ‘with his performances. Never- 
theless, it is clear that he stirred up considerable thought 
and had a wide influence. He won a great many converts 
to his principles, and, through the texts and treatises 
written as a result of the movement he stimulated, his 
ideas were largely perpetuated and expanded. In the Ratich antici-

failed to 
carry out his 
principles. 
next generation came Comenius, who carried out prac- . 
tically all the principles of Ratich more fully, and thus, 
in a way, the German innovator, unpractical as he was, 
became a sort of spiritual ancestor to Pestalozzi, Froebel, 
and Herbart.

CHAPTER IV 
COMENIUS AND HIS GREAT DIDACTIC. 
Jan Amos Komensky (1592-1671), better known by 
his Latinized name of Comenius, was born at Nivnitz, a 
village of Moravia. He was, by religious inheritance, a 
devoted adherent of the Protestant sect called Moravion 
Brethren While he became bishop of the Moravians, 
and devoted many of his writings to religion or theo- 
logical polemics, this does not concern us here, except as 
it affected his attitude as an educational reformer and 
a sense realist. 
The Education and Earliest Work of Comenius 
In his schooling, possibly as the result of careless 
guardianship of his inheritance, Comenius did nol 
come to the study of Latin, the all-important subjecl 
in his day, until he was sixteen. This delay must,

‘provinces’ of Moravians, the German, British, and American. They 
number in all about thirty-five thousand members, of whom some twenty 
thousand are in the United States.

as his maturity enabled him to perceive the amount of 
time then wasted upon grammatical complications and 
other absurdities in teaching languages, and was instru- 
mental in causing him to undertake an improvement of 
method. After his course in the Latin school, Comenius 
spent a couple of years in higher education at the Lutheran 
College of Herborn in the duchy of Nassau," where he 
went to prepare for the ministry of his denomination. and 
at the University of Heidelberg. Then, as h

residence of fourteen years. as rector of the Moravian 
gymnasium here, he accomplished many reforms in the 
schools, and began to embody his ideas in a series of 
remarkable textbooks. ‘The first of these works was pro- 
duced in 1631, and has generally been known by the name 
of Janua Linguarum Reserata (‘Gate of Languages Un- 
locked’). It was intended as an introductory book to 
the study of Latin,! and consisted of an arrangement into 
sentences of several thousand Latin words for the most 
familiar objects and ideas. The Latin was printed on 
the right-hand side of the page, and on the left was given © 
a translation in the vernacular. By this means the pupil 
obtained a grasp of all ordinary knowledge and at the 
same time a start in his Latin vocabulary. In writing 
this text, Comenius may have been. somewhat influenced 
by Ratich, the criticism of whose methods’ by the pro- 
; fessors at Giessen * he had read while at Herborn,’ but he 
seems to have been more specifically indebted both for 
his method and the felicitous néine of his book to a 
‘Jesuit known as Bateus,‘ who had written a similar work. 
1In the first edition it was called Janua Lingue Latin Reserata. 
2 See pp. 20 £. 
3 As, however, Ratich had failed to answer the letter of inquiry he 
wrote him from Leszno, Comenius must have largely worked out the plan 
independently. 
4 Batty or Bateus was an Irishman, although at the College of Sala- 
manca in Spain. Comenius makes acknowledgments to him in the 
Jona, but says his ideas had been outlined some time before his attention 
was called to the book of the Jesuit father.

From his description of an ideal ‘schoql for Patak,! 
and from other works, it is known that he intended also 
to write a fourth ? work in the Janual Series, but he never 
completed it. This was to be known as Sapientia 
Palatium (‘Palace of Wisdom’), and was to consist of | 
selections from Czsar, Sallust, Cicero, and. others of the 
best prose writers. While in Patak, however, Comenius 
did write two supplementary textbooks, the Orbis Sen- 
sgalium Pictus (‘The World of Sense Objects Pictured’) 
and the Schola Ludus (‘School Plays’). The latter, 
which is an attempt to dramatize the Janua, soon fell 
‘into disuse, but the former, in which Comenius applied 
his principles of sense realism more fully than in any other 
of his readers, remained a very popular text for two. cen- 
turies, and is most typical of the Comenian principles. 
It is practically an edition of the Janua accompanied 
with pictures, but is simpler and more extensive than 
the first issue of that book. Each object in a picture 
is marked with a number corresponding to one in the

The Didactica Magna as the Basis of All, His Works 
Thus, throughout his life Comenius was more or less 
engaged at every period in writing texts for the study of 
Latin. But these books connected with method were 
only a part of the work he contemplated. During his 
whole career he had in mind a complete system of the 
principles of education, and of what, in consequence, he 
wished the organization, subject-matter, and methods 
to be. His ideas on the whole question of education 
were early formulated at Leszno in his Didactica M. aging" 
(‘Great Didactic’). While this work has marty original 
features and is more carefully worked out than anything 
similar, Comenius frankly recognizes his obligations to 
many who have written previously. In fact, he rather 
strove to assimilate all that was good in the realistic move- 
ment and use it as a foundation. In this way the Didac- 
tica may be said to develop many of the scientific prin- 
ciples and methods found in Vives, Bateus, Ratich, 
Comenius as early as the Vestibulum as a desirable one, which at that time 
could not be carried out for lack of a skilful engraver. It may have been 
suggested to Comenius in the first instance by a Greek Testament edited 
early in the seventeenth century by a Professor Lubinus of the University 
of Rostock.

for its pansophic basis of education to the works of Bacon 
and even more to the Encyclopedia of Johann Heinrich 
Alsted, under whom Comenius had studied at Herborn. 
The Didactica seems to have been completed in the 
Moravian dialect * about the time the Janua first ap- 
peared, and must have been contemplated, somewhat 
earlier. Hence, while this work was not translated 
into Latin and published until 1657, and was never 
printed in the language in which it was originally written 
til a century and three quarters after the death of its 
author, the point of view must have been established 
even before Comenius came to Leszno, and influenced. 
him throughout his career. 
The rest of the books of Comenius may be regarded 
as amplifications of certain parts of the Didactica. To 
make his instructions on infant training more explicit, 
he wrote, while still at Leszno, the Informatorium Skoly 
several years in England. His chief treatise, De Tradendis Disciplinis, 
insists upon religion and classics as the main content of education.

attacked the formal religion and education of the times in numerous 
pamphlets.

Paris, who produced a number of practical works.

Comenius, by organizing his data about large principles, 
instead of merely accumulating facts, had advanced 
beyond previous attempts. Further, in his Didactica 
he recommends that a great College of Pansophy, or 
scientific research,! be established, and in 1641, just be- 
fore his call to Sweden, he went to England, at the invita- 
tion of Parliament, to start an institution of this charac- 
ter there. At Patak he even undertook to establish a 
pansophic school of secondary grade,-as outlined in his 
Pansophice Schole Delineatio (‘Plan of a Pansophic 
School’). 
Pansophia as His Ruling Passion 
This idea of pansophia seems to have been most keen 
and vivid with Comenius all his Hife, but he was always 
prevented from undertaking it te any extent by one acci- 
dent or another, and was doomed to constant disappoint- 
ment. Finally, shortly after his return from Patak, when 
Leszno was burned by the Poles, Comenius barely es- 
caped with his life, and his silva, or collection of pansophic 
materials, upon which he had worked for forty years,

Comenius foolishly published a letter of congratulation to the Swedish

According to 
Comenius, 
education 
should aim at 
knowledge, 
morality, and 
piety. 
Man’s lower 
nature should his favorite conception further. 
The Threefold Aim of Education 
While mystic and narrow at times, Comenius was a 
sincere Christian, and his view of life is most consistently 
carried out in his conception of education. He hoped 
for a complete regeneration of mankind through an 
embodiment of religion in the purpose of education. This 
educational aim is shown in the following propositions, 
which he develops in successive chapters of the Didac- 
tica: — 
“() Man is the highest, the most absolute, and the most 
" excellent of things created ; II) the ultimate end of man is beyond 
this life; (ITI) this life is but a preparation for eternity ; (IV) there 
are three stages in the preparation for eternity: to know oneself 
(and with oneself all things), to rule oneself, and to direct oneself 
to God;! (V) the seeds of these three (learning, virtue, religion 2) 
are naturally implanted in us; (VI) if a man is to be produced, it 
is necessary that he be formed by education.” 
Thus, from his religious conception of society, Come- 
nius works out as his aim of education knowledge, morality,

gere. Cf.

and piety, and makes these ideals go hand in hand. It 
is to be noted, however, that his ideas about what con- 
stitutes religion have advanced a long way beyond those 
of medizval times. He regards education not as a means 
of ridding oneself of all natural instincts, and of exalting 
the soul by degrading the body, but as a system for con- 
trolling the lower nature by the higher through a mental, 
moral, and religious training. Education should enable 
one to become pious through the establishment of moral 
habits, which are in turn to be formed and guided through 
adequate knowledge. 
Universal Education and the Four School Periods 
But as with Comenius education is to prepare us to 
live as human beings, rather than to fit us for station, 
rank, or occupation, he further Molds : — 
“(VIII The young must be educated in common, and for 
this schools are necessary; (IX) all the young of both sexes should 
be sent to school,” ° 
Under these headings he shows that, while the parents 
are responsible for the education of their children, it has 
been necessary to set aside a special class of people for 
teachers and to create a special institution known as the 
school, and that there should be one system of schools 
for all alike, — “boys and girls, both noble and ignoble, 
rich and poor, in all cities and towns, villages and ham- 
lets.” g controlled

the ‘acad-

  38 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
Later on,! the Didactica more fully describes the or. 
ganization that Comenius believes would be most 
tive. The system should consist of four periods 
years each, ranging from birth to manhood. The first 
period of instruction is that through infancy, which lasts 
up to the age of six, and the school is that of the ‘mother’s 
lap.’ Next comes childhood, which continues until the 
pupil is twelve, and for this is to be organized the ‘ver- 
nacular,’ or elementary, school, From that time up to 
eighteen comes the period of adolescence, with its ‘Latin,’ 
or secondary, school. Finally, during youth, from eight- 
een. to twenty-four, the ‘academy,’ or university, to- 
gether with travel, should be the means of education. 
As to the distribution and scope of these institutions, 
Comenius declares: — ‘ 
“A mother school should exist in every house, a vernacular 
school in every hamlet and village, a Latin school in every city, 
and a university in every kingdom or in every province. The 
mother school and the vernacular school embrace all the young 
of both sexes. The Latin school gives a more thorough education 
to those who aspire higher than the workshop; while the univer- 
sity trains up the teachers and learned men of the future, that 
our churches, schools, and states may never lack suitable leaders.”’ 
Hence only those of the greatest ability, ‘the flower of 
mankind,’ were to go to the university. “A public

examination should be held for the students who leave 
the Latin school, and from its results the masters may 
decide which of them should be sent to the university and 
which should enter the other occupations of life. Those 
who are selected will pursue their studies, some choosing 
theology, some politics, and some medicine, in accordance 
with their natural inclination, and with the needs of the 
Church and of the State.” 
Such an organization of schools as that suggested by 
Comenius would tend to bring about the custom of edu- 
cating according to ability, rather than social status, and 
would thus enable any people to secure the benefit of 
all their genius. It was a genuine ‘ladder’ system of 
education, open to all, and leading from the kindergarten 
through the university, such as has been commended by 
Huxley in speaking of the American schools. At the © 
day that Comenius proposed it, this organization was 
some three centuries in advance of the times. Such an 
idea of equal opportunities for all could have been pos- 
sible in the seventeenth century only as the educational 
outgrowth of a religious attitude like that of Comenius, 
and may well haye been promoted in his case by the 
simple, democratic spirit of the little band of Christians

  40 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
The Pansophic College and the Encyclopedic Courses 
of Study 
But beyond the university, which, like the lower schools, 
was to make teaching its chief function, Comenius held 
it to be important that somewhere in the world there 
should be a Schola Scholarum or Collegium Didacticum, 
which should be devoted to scientific investigation. 
Through this pansophic college, learned men from all 
nations might codperate, and, he holds, — 
“These men should . . . spread the light of wisdom through- 
out the human race with greater success than has hitherto been 
attained, and benefit humanity by new and useful inventions. 
For this no single man and no single generation is sufficient, and 
it is therefore essential that the work be carried on by many, work- 
ing together and employing the researches of their predecessors as 
a starting-point.” 
This plan of a ‘Universal College’ for research would 
seem to be a natural product of the pansophic ideal, which» 
has been seen! to dominate all of the educational theory 
of Comenius. Such an institution would form a logical 
climax to his system of schools, bearing, as he says, the 
same relation to them that the stomach does to the other 
members of the body by “supplying blood, life, and 
and are exactly alike, except for size, so ‘iain e in this Christian family 
may appear more prominent than the other. A similar interpretation 
of the Master’s ‘brotherhood of man’ is evidenced in all the Moravian 
social life. 1 See pp. 35 f.

strength to all,” for he holds that a training in all sub- 
jects should be given at every stage of education. Such 
universal knowledge, however, Comenius believes, should 
be given only in outline at first,.and then more and 
more elaborately and thoroughly as education proceeds. 
The Didactica, accordingly, states : — 
“These different schools are not to deal with different sub- | 
jects, but should treat the same subjects in different ways, giving 
instruction in all that can produce true men, true Christians, 
and true scholars; throughout graduating the instruction to the 
age of the pupil and the knowledge that he already possesses. . . . 
In the earlier schools everything is taught in a general and un- 
defined manner, while in those that follow the information is par- 
ticularized and exact; just as a tree puts forth more branches : 
and shoots each successive year, and grows stronger and more 
fruitful.” 2 
In later chapters of the Didactica and in his works for 
the special stages, Comenius gives the details of the pan- 
sophic training in each period of education. Even in the 
mother school, it is expected that the infant shall be 
taught geography, history, and various sciences; gram- 
mar, rhetoric, and dialectic; music, arithmetic, geom- 
etry, and astronomy; and the rudiments of economics, 
politics, ethics, metaphysics, and religion; as well as 
encouraged in sports.aad the construction of buildings.

temporal, spatial, and numerical relations; in distin- 
guishing.sun, moon, and stars, hills, valleys, lakes, and 
rivers, and animals and plants; in learning to express 
oneself, and in acquiring proper habits. It is, in fact, 
very much like the training of the modern kindergarten. 
Similarly, the vernacular school is to afford more 
advanced instruction in all literature, morals, and reli- 
gion that will be of value throughout life, in case the pupil 
can go no further. The course is to include, beside the 
elements, motals, religion, and music, everyday civil 
government and economics, history and geography, 
with especial reference to the pupil’s own country, and 
a general knowledge of the mechanic arts. - All these 
studies are to be given in the native tongue, since it would 
take too long to acquire the Latin, and those who are 
to go on will learn Latin more readily for having a wide 
knowledge of things to which they have simply to apply 
new names instead of those of the vernacular. 
The Latin school, while including four languages, — 
the vernacular, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, is also to 
.continue this encyclopedic training. The seven liberal 
arts are to be taught in mgre-formal fashion, and consider- 
able work is to be given in physic séography, chronology, 
history, ethics, and theology. In his description of the 
Pangophic school that he undertook to establish at Patak, 
ea
-P-A-G-E-53
COMENIUS AND HIS GREAT DIDACTIC 43 
Comenius gives an even more specific account of the rangé 
of knowledge that should be gained in secondary education. 
He maps out seven classes, of which the first three are 
to be called ‘philological,’ and the other four to be known 
as ‘philosophical,’ ‘logical,’ ‘political,’ and ‘theological,’ 
respectively. In the philological grades, he indicates 
that Latin is to be taught; arithmetic, plane and solid 
geometry, and music are to be gradually acquired; and 
instruction is to be afforded in morality, the catechism, 
the Scriptures, and psalms, hymns, and prayers. So he 
gives exactly the amount of training in mathematics, 
the arts and sciences, and religion that is to appear in 
the next three classes, and arranges that Greek shall be 
studied and Hebrew begun. In the last class, the wide 
range of secular knowledge is to be continued, and such 
theological matters as the relation of souls to God are to 
be discussed. 
Finally, in the case of the university, Comenius main- 
tains that “the curriculum should be really universal, 
and provision should be made for the study of every 
branch of human knowledge,” but “each student should 
devote his undivided energies to that subject for which 
he is evidently suited by nature,” — theology, medicine, 
law, music, poetry, or oratory. However, “those of 
quite exceptional talent should be urged to pursue all 
the branches of study, that there may always be some 
men whose knowledge is encyclopedic.”

The Method of Nature . 
Thus at every stage of education Comenius believes 
that there should be pansophic instruction. The way in 
which this knowledge is to be acquired, he intends also 
to have in full accord with sense realism. He insists that, 
in order to reform the schools of the day, which were 
uninteresting, wasteful of time, and cruel, the ‘method 
of nature’ must be observed and followed, for “if we wish 
to find a remedy for the defects of Nature, it is in Nature 
herself that we must look for it, since it is certain that 
art can do nothing unless it imitate Nature.” He then 
shows how Nature accomplishes all things “with cer- 
tainty, ease, and thoroughness,” 1 in what respects the 
schools have deviated from the principles of nature, and 
how they can be rectified only by following her plans. 
These principles concerning the working of nature were, 
however, not established inductively by Comenius, but 
laid down @ priori, and were mostly superficial and fanci- 
ful analogies. The following quotation from the First , 
Principle that he gives under the ‘certainty’ of nature, 
may serve as a specimen of his method: — 
“Nature observes a suitable time. For example, a bird that 
wishes to multiply its species, does not set about it in winter, 
when everything is stiff with cold, nor in summer, when every- 
thing is parched and withered with heat; nor yet in autumn, 
when the vital force of all creatures declines with the sun’s declin-

ha a

ing rays, and a new winter with hostile mien is approaching; 
but in spring, when the sun brings back life and strength to all.” 
The schools deviate from this method of nature, he 
claims in the first place, because “the right time for men- 
tal exercise is not chosen,” and to rectify the error, — 
“(1) The education of men should be commenced in the spring- 
time of life, that is to say, in boyhood (for boyhood is the equiva- 
lent of spring, youth of summer, manhood of autumn, and old 
age of winter). (II) The morning hours are the most suitable 
for study, for here again the morning is the equivalent of spring, 
midday of summer, the evening of autumn, and the night of 
winter,” 
It is not remarkable that, with all his realistic tend- 
encies, Comenius did not employ the inductive method 
to any extent. He had inherited the notion that not all 
truth can be secured through the senses or by reason. 
He claimed that even Bacon’s method could not be ap- 
plied to the entire universe, all of which is included in 
his pansophia. There are, he held, three media for 
knowledge, — the senses, the intellect, and revelation, 
and “error will céase if the balance between them is 
preserved.” The natural sciences were young in the 
day of Comenius, and he was very limited in his grasp 
of their content and method. It is a sufficient merit 
that, imbibing the spirit of sense realism, he had for 
the first time in history applied anything like induction 
-to teaching, and produced the most systematic and The induc-

After working out in the Didactica these general prin- 
ciples for following nature, Comenius renders his work 
made eee. much more practical by showing how such principles 
al erie may be made effective in the ordinary schools. He 
oftfe general then applies his general method to the specific teaching 
fhe sciences, of various branches of knowledge, — sciences, arts (in- 
suse, y - cluding reading, writing, singing, composition, and 
piety. logic), and languages, and to instruction in morality and 
piety. On this practical side of his method, he applies 
more fully the induction of Bacon. After showing the 
necessity for careful observation in obtaining a knowledge 
of the sciences, he gives nine useful precepts. for their 
study, and while they are stated as general principles, 
they are clearly the inductive result of his own experience 
ae as a teacher. Similarly he formulates rules for instruc- 
Impression

sured by ex-

description of special method in sciences, too, is thor- 
oughly in harmony with realism in its insistence that, 
in order to make a genuine impression upon the mind, 
one must deal with realities rather than books. The 
objects themselves, or, where this is not possible, such 
representations of them as can be conveyed by copies, 
models, and pictures, must be studied. In the case of 
the languages, arts, morality, and piety, impression must 
. be insured by expression. ‘What has to be done, must
-P-A-G-E-57
COMENIUS AND HIS GREAT DIDACTIC 47 
be learned by doing.” Reading, writing, and singing 
are to be acquired by practice. The use of foreign lan- 
guages affords a better means of learning them than do 
the rules of grammar. Practice, good example, and 
sympathetic guidance teach us virtue better than do 
precepts. Piety is instilled by meditation, prayer, 
and self-examination. 
As would be expected from the threefold interrelated 
aim and the encyclopedic content of education, Comé- 
nius everywhere in his method intends that all subjects 
shall be correlated. In particular, he holds: — 
“The study of languages, especially in youth, should be joined 
‘to that of objects, that our acquaintance with the objective world 
and with language, that is to say, our knowledge of facts and our 
power to express them, may progress side by side.” 1 
In the matter of discipline, as a natural accompani- 
ment of his improvements in method, Comenius was 
in advance of his time. He holds that the end of -dis- 
cipline is to prevent a recurrence of the fault, and it 
must be inflicted in such a way that the pupil will recog- 
nize that it is for his own good. Severe punishment   
must not be administered for a failure in studies, Butts, 
only for a moral breach, and exhortation and reproof 
are to be used before resorting to more stringent meas- 
ures,

The Influence of Comenius upon Education 
Such was the work of Comenius, who may in the fullest 
sense be considered a great educational reformer and 
the real progenitor of modern education. His position | 
grew out of sense realism, but to the encyclopedic con- _ 
tent and the natural method of Bacon, Ratich, and 
others, which he rendered more elaborate, consistent, 
and rational, he added his natural endowment of innate 
piety and a sense of the ‘brotherhood of man.’ Come- 
nius made it evident that education should be a natural, 
not an artificial and traditional, process in harmony 
with man’s very constitution and destiny, and that a 
well-rounded training for complete living should be every- 
where afforded to all, without regard to sex, social posi- 
tion, or wealth, because of their very humanity. He 
outlined a regular system of schools and described their 
grading, and was the first to suggest a training for very 
young children. He held that bodily vigor and physi- 
cal education were essential, and made sense training 
an important part of the course. He further broadened 
and enriched the entire curriculum by subordinating 
Latin to the vernacular, and insisting upon geography, 
history, the elements of all arts and sciences, ard such 
other studies as would fit one for the activities of life. 
He correlated and coérdinated all subjects, and com- 
bined even the training in Latin with a knowledge of
-P-A-G-E-59
| 
|

real things. This he accomplished through a series of 
textbooks that were a great advance over anything pre- 
viously produced. Thus he greatly contributed to make 
education more effective, interesting, pleasant, and 
natural. 
However, for nearly two centuries Comenius had but 
little direct effect upon the schools, except for his lan- 
guage methods and his texts. The Janua was trans- 
lated into a dozen European, and at least three Asiatic, 
languages; the Orbis Pictus proved even more popular, 
and went through an almost unlimited number of edi- 
tions in various tongues; and the whole series became 
for many generations the favorite means of introducing 
young people to the study of Latin. But until about 
half a century ago, the work of Comenius as a whole had 
purely an historical interest, and was known almost 
solely through the Orbis Pictus. The great reformer was 
viewed as a fanatic, especially as the pansophic ideal 
tured out to be of only ephemeral interest. Human- 
ism was too thoroughly intrenched to give way at once 
to realism. 
Nevertheless, the principles of Comenius were uncon- 
sciously taken up by others and have become the basis of 
modern education. Francke was anticipated by Come- 
nius in suggesting a curriculum that wauld fit one for 
life; before Rousseau, Comenius intimated that the 
school system should be adapted to the child rather than ° . een

‘self-activity,’ and play, suggested by Froebel, had been’ 
previously outlined by the Moravian. Hence it hap- 
pened that in the middle of the nineteenth century, when 
the works of Comenius were once more brought to light 
by German investigators, it was discovered that the old 
realist of the seventeenth century had been the first to 
deal with education in a scientific spirit, and work out 
its problems practically in the schools. His evidently 
was the clearest of visions and broadest of intellects. 
While it is easy to criticize him now, in the light of history 
Comenius is a most important individyal in the develop- 
ment of modern education.

JOHN LOCKE AND EDUCATION AS DISCIPLINE 
Tur educational position of Jokn Locke (1632-1704) 
eis usually misinterpreted. The general estimate of his 
theory is taken from his work entitled Some Thoughts 
concerning Education. This treatise grew out of his 
experience as a private tutor in the family of the Earl 
of Shaftesbury, and consists of a set of practical sug- 
gestions for the education of a gentleman, rather 
than a scholar. The recommendations contained in the 
Thoughts are consequently somewhat at variance with 
the underlying principles of Locke’s philosophy, as given 
in his famous Essay concerning the Human Understand- 
ing, and with the intellectual training suggested in his 
other educational work, Conduct of the Understanding, 
which was originally an additional book and an applica- 
tion of the Essay.

Locke holds that book education and intellectual training 
are of less importance than the development of character 
and polish. After treating bodily education at consider- 
able length, he states the aims of education in the order 
of their value as “Virtue, Wisdom (i.e. worldly wis- 
dom), Breeding, and Learning,” and later adds: — 
“Learning must be had, but in the second place, as subservient 
only to greater Qualities. Seek out somebody that may know

Point, and this provided for, Learning may be had into the Bar-

Such a training, Locke agrees with Montaigne, can 
be secured only through personal attention, and the young 
gentleman should be given a tutor when his father can- 
not properly look after his training. Likewise, he feels 
that, “to form a young Gentleman as he should be, ’tis 
; fit his Governor should himself be well-bred, understand- 
ing the Ways of Carriage and Measures of Civility in all 
the variety of Persons, Times, and Places; and keep his 
Pupil, as much as his Age requires, constantly to the 
Observation of them.” This private training is infi- 
nitely to be preferred, Locke holds, to that “from such a 
troop of Play-fellows as schools usually assemble from 
Parents of all kinds.” Locke also believes, with Mon- Character is

that it should not, as it usually did, come at the critical _ 
period between sixteen and twenty-one, but either earlier, 
when the boy is better able to learn foreign languages, or 
later, when he can intelligently observe the laws and cus- 
toms of other countries. 
Locke approaches the earlier realists even more closely 
in showing scant respect for the narrow humanism and 
tedious methods of the grammar school. He declares 
specifically : — 
“When I consider what an ado is made about a little Latin 
and Greek, how many Years are spent in it, and what a Noise and 
Business it makes to no purpose, I can hardly forbear thinking 
that the Parents of children still live in Fear of the Schoolmaster’s 
Rod, which they look on as the only Instrument of Education; 
as a language or two to be its whole Business.” 
Yet Locke agrees with Montaigne again in thinking 
that Latin is, after all, “absolutely necessary to a Gentle- 
man,” but that “’tis a Wonder Parents, when they have 
had the Experience in French, should not think (it) ought 
’ to be learned the same way, by talking and reading,”! 
instead of through grammar, theme. writing, versifica-

Locke does not regard as essential to a gentleman’s edu-

cation, although he may in manhood take it up by hini- 
self. 
As a further part of ‘intellectual education,’ Locke 
holds that, “‘besides what is to be had from Study and 
Books, there are other Accomplishments necessary for a 
Gentleman,” —- dancing, horseback riding, fencing, and 
wrestling. The pupil should also, he contends, “learn 
@ Trade, a manual Trade; nay, two or three, but one more 
particularly.” This the future gentleman should ac- 
quire, not with the idea of ever engaging in it, but for 
the sake of health and of “‘easing the wearied Part by 
Change of Business.” ! 
Locke as a ‘Sense Realist’ 
But there are also elements throughout the T ‘houghts 
and to some extent in the Conduct, where Locke seems to 
have been affected by the concrete material and interest- ; 
ing methods of Comenius, the great ‘sense’ realist, as 
clearly as he was elsewhere by the earlier realism of Mon- 
taigne. Even in the subjects he recommends for the 
education of a gentleman, where he was especially follow- 
ing Montaigne, Locke makes a selection, utilitarian in 
nature and wide in range, that reminds one of the ency- 
clopadic advice of Bacon, Ratich, and Comenius. He

also resembles the sense realists in desiring to begin with 
the vernacular studies, which with him are reading, 
writing, drawing, and possibly shorthand. And when 
the pupil is able to take up a foreign language, Locke 
believes, with Comenius, that this should not be Latin, 
but the language of his nearest neighbor, — in the case of 
the English boy, French. After the neighboring lan- 
guage has been learned, Latin may be studied. Like the 
Moravian, too, Locke believes in correlating content 
studies with the study of languages. He suggests: — 
~ “At the same time that he is learning French and Latin, a 
Child, as has been said, may also be enter’d in Arithmetick, Geog- 
raphy, Chronology, History, and Geometry, too. For if these be 
taught him in French or Latin, when he begins once to understand 
either of these tongues, he will get a Knowledge in these sciences, 
and the Languages to boot.” 
In the matter of method also, Locke reminds one of 
andinhis Comenius and the other sense realists. He believes that 
ee of “contrivances might be made to teach Children io read, 
teaching. whilst they thought they were only playing,” and makes 
the suggestion of pasting the letters of the alphabet upon 
the sides of the dice. And further, — “when by these 
gentle Ways he begins to read, some easy pleasant Book, 
suited to his Capacity, should be put into his Hands, 
wherein the entertainment he finds might draw him on.” 
Healsoholds Moreover, Locke is most thoroughly a sense realist in ‘ 
eat impree ig theory of knowledge and.the pedagogical recommenda- sions are

tions that grow out of it. He holds that impressions 
are made through the senses by observation, and are 
only combined afterward by reflection. The develop- 
ment, therefore, of such knowledge to the most complex 
ideas comes through induction, and in this way the 
sciences should be studied. In the Conduct? he 
states : — 
“The surest way for a learner, in this as in all other cases, is 
not to advance by jumps, and large strides; let that which he 
sets himself to learn next be indeed the next; i.c., as nearly con- 
joined with what he knows already as it is possible; let it be 
distinct, but not remote from it; let it be new and what he did 
not know before, that understanding may advance; but let it be 
as little at once as may be, that its advances may be clear and 
sure.” 
It is not surprising that, with such pleasant methods, 
Locke, like the realists generally, declares in his Thoughts 
that “great Severity of Punishment does but very little 
Good, nay, great Harm in Education.”? He prefers 
“Esteem or Disgrace” as the proper means of discipline, 
and maintains, as Comenius did, that.corporal punish- 
_ ment should be for moral rather than intellectual re- 
missness.

is a reflection 
of his philoso-

given in the 
Essay, 58 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
‘Locke as the Advocate of ‘Formal Discipline’ 
Locke, however, cannot be judged to be primarily a 
realist of either the ‘humanistic’ or the ‘sense’ type. 
His real attitude in education must be taken chiefly from 
the Conduct, and read in the light of his rationalistic 
philosophy, which, in turn, is directly connected with 
his view-point in religion and politics. While Locke’s 
ancestry was Puritan, this seems to have had little in- 
fluence upon his life and philosophy, except as he was 
ever the advocate of civil, religious, and philosophic 
freedom. This tendency was increased by his close per- 
sonal relations with the noted liberal, Lord Shaftesbury. 
In accordance with his convictions, Locke wrote two 
Treatises on Government, three Letters on Toleration, and 
an essay upon the Reasonableness of Christianity. Each 
of these works vigorously opposed absolutism and dog- 
matism, but they are all simply applications of the 
thought underlying his great Essay concerning the Human 
Understanding. Yn this treatise, which was the product 
of his reflection during a score of years, he holds, as in the 
more special works, to the fruitlessness of traditional 
opinions and empty phraseology. He rejects all ‘innate 
ideas,’ or axiomatic principles, and charges that this 
tenet was imposed by masters and teachers upon their 
followers, “to take them off their own reason and judg- 
ment, and put them on believing and taking them upon
-P-A-G-E-69
JOHN LOCKE AND EDUCATION AS DISCIPLINE 59 
trust without further examination.” All knowledge, 
claims the Essay, comes rather from experience, and the 
mind is like “white paper, or wax, to be molded and 
fashioned as one pleases.” + On it ideas are painted by 
‘sensation’ ‘and ‘reflection.’ Locke further finds it 
necessary to determine, when the ideas are once in mind, 
what they tell us in the way of truth. He holds that 
“knowledge is real only so far as there is a conformity 
between our ideas and the realities of things,” and that, 
as we cannot always be sure of this correspondence, 
much of our knowledge is probable and not certain. We 
must, therefore, in each case carefully consider the grounds 
of probability, — ‘the conformity of anything with our 
own knowledge, observation, and the testimony of 
others.” 
To train the mind to make the proper discriminations 
in these matters, Locke claims that a formal discipline 
must be furnished by education. This attitude is made 
" clear in his posthumous educational work, Conduct of the 
Understanding. As regards the aim of intellectual edu- 
cation, he holds in his work : — 
“As it is in the body, so it is in the mind; practice makes it He holds in 
his Conduct 
that the 
mind, like the 
body, grows through exer- 
cise, 
what it is, and most even of those excellences which are looked on , 
as natural endowments will be found, when examined into more 
narrowly, to be the product of exercise, and to be raised to that 
pitch only by repeated actions. Few men.are from their youth

  and that the 
best gymnas-

soning is 
found in 
mathematics. 
He also ad- 
vises a tange

mind so as to

ence, 60 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
accustomed to strict reasoning, and to trace the dependence of 
any truth in a long train of consequences to its remote principles 
and to observe its connection; and he that by frequent practice 
has not been used to this employment of his understanding, it is 
no more wonder that he should not, when he is grown into years, 
be able to bring his mind to it, than that he should not be able 
on a sudden to grave and design, dance on the ropes, or write a 
good hand, who has never practiced either of them.” 
Concerning the best studies for producing this mental 
gymnastic, Locke says : — , 
“Would you have a man reason well, you must use him to it 
betimes, exercise his mind in observing the connection of ideas 
and following them in train. Nothing does this better than 
mathematics, which therefore I think should be taught all those 
who have the time and opportunity, not so much to make them 
mathematicians as to make them reasonable creatures. .., that 
having got the way of reasoning, which that study necessarily 
brings the mind to, they might be able to transfer it to other 
parts of knowledge as they shall have occasion.” 
So Locke advises a wide range of sciences, not for the 
sake of the realistic knowledge obtained, but for intel- 
lectual discipline, “to accustom our minds to all sorts of 
ideas and the proper ways of examining their habitudes 
and relations; . . . not to make them perfect in any 
one of the sciences, but so to open and dispose their 
minds as may best make them capable of any, when they 
shall apply themselves to it.” Similarly, he implies that 
reading may become a means of discrimination. “Those
-P-A-G-E-71
JOHN LOCKE AND EDUCATION AS DISCIPLINE 61 
who have got this faculty, one may say, have got the true 
key of books, and the clue to lead them through the mize- 
maze .of variety of opinions and authors to truth and 
certainty.” ‘ 
The same disciplinary conception of the aim of educa- 
tion underlies most of Locke’s recommendations on moral 
and physical training in the Thoughts. When in this 
- work he comes to treat moral education, he declares at 
_ the start : — 
“As the strength of the Body lies chiefly in being able to en- 
dure Hardships, so also does that of the Mind. And the great 
Principle and Foundation of all Virtue and Worth is plac’d in 
this: That a Man is able to deny himself his own Desires, cross 
his own Inclinations, and purely follow what Reason directs as 
Best, tho’ the Appetite lean the other Way. ... This Power is 
to be got and improv’d by Custom, made easy and familiar by an 
early Practice. If, therefore, I might be heard, I would advise 
that, contrary to the ordinary Way, Children should be us’d to 
submit their Desires, and go without their Longings, even from 
their very Cradles. The first Thing they should learn to know, 
should be that they were not to have any Thing because it pleased 
them, but because it was thought fit for them.” 
Hence, in Locke’s opinion, morality comes about 
through submitting the natural desires to the control of 
reason, and thereby forming virtuous habits. In this 
light he discusses various virtues and vices as they 
occur to him, and insists that, in order that the proper 
habits may be ingrained in them, children should

  Hence 
Locke’s real

recognize the absolute authority of their fathers and 
tutors. 
The ideal upon which Locke bases his physical train- 
ing is even more fully that of formal discipline, and has 
since been generally known as the ‘hardening process.’ 
His advice concerning this part of a pupil’s training 
might be abridged as follows: — 
“Most Children’s Constitutions are either spoil’d or at least 
harm’d by Cockering and Tenderness. The first Thing to be taken 
Care of is that Children be not too warmly clad or cover’d, Winter 
or Summer. The Face when we are born, is no less tender than 
any other Part of the Body. ’Tis Use alone hardens it, and 
makes it more able to endure the Cold. I will also.advise his 
(z. e. the child’s) Feet to be wash’d every Day in cold Water, and 
to have his Shoes so thin that they might leak and let in Water, 
whenever he comes near it. I should advise him to play in the 
Wind and Sun without a Hat. His Diet ought to be very plain 
and simple, — if he must needs have Flesh, let it be but once a 
Day, and of one Sort at a Meal without other Sauce than Hunger. 
His Meals should not be kept constantly to an Hour. Let his 
Bed be hard, and rather Quilts than feathers, —- hard Lodging 
strengthens the Parts.” 
Thus the intellectual education suggested by Locke 
in the Conduct is evidently very different in content and 
+ Strangely enough, Locke, despite his doctrine of a tabula rasa, here 
recognizes native tendencies in the child, but they seem to be all hostile 
to moral development, and must be ‘suppressed,’ ‘weeded out,’ and 
‘cured.’ Whereas the good elements have in general to be ‘imprinted,’ 
‘implanted,’ and ‘instilled’ from the outside,

measured. And his real educational theory is clearly 
exhibited in the mental training advocated by the former 
work and in the positions taken on physical and moral. 
training in the latter. The idea he gives here of training 
the mind by means of mathematics and other subjects 
so as to cultivate ‘general power,’ together with his 
‘denial of desires’ in moral education and the ‘hardening 
process’ in physical training, would seem to make Locke 
the first! writer to advocate the doctrine of ‘formal dis- 
cipline.’ 
The Influence of ‘ Formal Discipline’ upon Education 
Adherents of this theory hold that the study of certain 
subjects yields results out of all proportion to the effort 
expended, and gives a power that may be applied in any 
direction. It has been argued by formal disciplinarians, 
accordingly, that every one should take these all- 
important studies, regardless of his interest, ability, or pur- 
pose in life, and that all who are unfitted for these partic- 
ular subjects are not qualified for the higher duties and 
responsibilities, and are unworthy of educational con- 
sideration. These subjects are usually held to be the 
classic languages to improve the ‘faculty of memory,’ 
and mathematics to: sharpen the ‘faculty of reason,’

although strenuous efforts have been made by the scien-

the ‘formal discipline’ in their own favorite studies. 
This principle of formal discipline has had a tremendous 
effect upon each stage of education in practically every 
country and during every period almost up to the last 
decade, when a decided reaction began.? The formal 
classicism of the English grammar and public schools 
and universities, and of the German Gymnasien, afford 
excellent examples of the influence of this doctrine.

society has enabled changes to be more readily made,

grammar were defended in our elementary education 
upon the score of ‘formal discipline.’ But, with the 
growth of science, the abandonment of the ‘faculty’! 
psychology and the development of educational theory, 
the curriculum has everywhere been broadened, and the 
content of studies rather than the process of acquisition 
has come to be emphasized. 
It should, however, be recognized that Locke did not 
defend, but vigorously assailed, the grammatical and 
linguistic grind in the English public schools. His 
attitude toward formal discipline sprang from his desire 
to root out the traditional and false, rather than to sup- 
port the narrow humanistic curricula of the times. His 
philosophy and educational doctrines grew out of his 
purpose to aid the cause of liberty and reason, and his 
esteem for mathematics as an intellectual training shows 
his connection with Descartes? It was, moreover, his 
doctrine that, developed to an extreme, eventuated in 
the destructive philosophy of the French rationalists 
and the skepticism of Hume. While, therefore, Locke’s 
imagery of the tabula rasa and his disciplinary theory

his Jesuit traditions. The effort to strip off preconceived opinions is 
similar in both, and while Locke rejects the ‘innate ideas,’ to whose cer- 
tainty Descartes holds, he also believes in mathematics as the best means 
of disciplining the mind and of getting rid of the false.

have had an influence far beyond his times, it can hardly 
be supposed that he took that position in conscious sup-

schools. He was in this, as in all his positions, a radical 
and a rationalist.

  CHAPTER VI 
FRANCKE AND HIS INSTITUTIONS 
CorRESPONDING to the development of Puritanism 
in England, a great religious revival also began in Ger- 
many téward the close of the seventeenth century. In 
the midst of the formalism into which Lutheranism had 
fallen, there arose a set of theologians who were con- 
vinced of the need of moral and religious reform, and 
desired to make religion a matter of life rather than of 
creed. ‘ 
Spener and Francke 
Among their number early appeared Philipp Jakob 
Spener (1635-1705), a pastor in Frankfurt, who insti- 
’ tuted at his home a series of so-called collegia pietatis 
(‘religious assemblies’), in which were formulated propo- 
sitions of reform. The views here represented seem to 
have been borrowed largely from Puritan writers. They 
did not advocate any new doctrine, but simply subordi- 
nated orthodoxy to spiritual religion and practical moral- 
ity. The movement spread rapidly, and made a great 
impression throughout Germany. The old orthodox 
theologians and pastors were grievously offended, and,

from the name of the gatherings, the reformers became 
known in reproach as Pietists.t 
From the standpoint of education, however, the most 
important Pietist was August Hermann Francke (1663- 
1727). Francke received an excellent education at the 
Gotha gymnasium, where he became acquainted with 
the reforms of Ratich and Comenius, and at the uni- 
versities of Erfurt, Kiel, and Leipzig, in which he studied 
theology and the languages, especially Greek and He- 
brew. He first came into notice at Leipzig, where he 
had become a Privatdocent, by starting a Pietist society 
for careful discussion and pious application of the Scrip- 
tures. His attitude aroused the ill-will of the older 
professors and caused his dismissal. After a brief but 
stormy career as a preacher at Erfurt and as a teacher 
at Hamburg, he assisted in founding the University of 
Halle, which became the center from which Pietism was 
diffused throughout Germany. 
Organization of Francke’s Institutions 
Here in 1692 Francke became a professor of the Greek 
and Hebrew languages, but was afterward transferred 
to his favorite subject of theology. To make ends meet,

he was also appointed pastor in the suburb of Glaucha, 
and through this latter position his real work as an edu- 
cator began. While catechizing the children who came 
to the parsonage to beg, he was shocked at their ignorance, 
poverty, and immorality, and resolved to raise them 
from their degradation by education. One day early in 
1695, upon finding a contribution of seven guldens! 
in his alms box, he started an Armenschule (‘school 
for the poor’) in his own house, and engaged a student 
of the university as its teacher. As he was soon re- 
“ quested to open another school for those whose parents 
could afford to pay, he rented two rooms in a neigh- 
boring building, — one for the Armenschule and one for 
the Biirgerschule (‘school for citizens’). Further, be- 
lieving it of advantage to remove orphans from their old 
associations, he established a third institution for them, 
called the Waisenansialt (‘orphanage’), and later he sub- 
divided all three organizations upon the basis of sex. 
Still in this same year, he undertook for a wealthy 
widow of noble family to educate her son together with 
some other boys, and his work in this direction grew

but in Francke’s time a coin of the present value of a dollar had a very 
large purchasing power. With the contribution, we learn, Francke pur- 
chased two thalers’ (about $1.50) worth of books and employed a poor 
student to teach the children two hours daily. For the further support 
of the school he declared he would ‘ trust God.’ ‘Armen-

rapidly into a secondary school, which came to be known 
as the Pddagogium. Two years later he started another 
secondary course for the purpose of preparing the brighter 
boys from the orphan and poor schools for the university, 
and this was called the Lateinische Haupischule, or 
Schola Latina, to distinguish it from the elementary 
schools, in which no foreign language was taught. As 
early as 1698, Francke likewise wished to organize a 
boarding-school where girls whose parents could afford 
it might obtain a training in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and 
other secondary subjects, and while at first this enter- 
prise was on a small scale, within a dozen years the 
Héhere Téchterschule (‘higher school for girls’) became 
a regular part of his system. Moreover, through his 
colleague, Semler, a secondary school of a more practical 
type, called the Realschule, in which the pure and ap- 
plied sciences were taught, became associated in 1708 
with the institutions of Francke. 
In addition to these elementary and secondary schools, 
Francke was also enabled, through a gift of four thou- 
sand marks ($1000), to institute in 1695 a Seminarium 
Preceptorum (‘seminary for teachers’), in which the 
theological students that taught in his schools might be 
trained. These students practiced teaching for two 
hours each day under the supervision and criticism of 
inspectors, and were boarded at a Freitisch (‘free table’), 
established by means of the endowment.

  FRANCKE AND HIS INSTITUTIONS qt 
His Religious Aim in Education 
Even if we were not acquainted with the origin of 
Pietism, or with the practice in Francke’s schools, the 
explicit statements in his Brief and Simple Treatise on 
Christian Education’ would make it evident that the 
educational aim underlying all his work was primarily 
religious training. “The chief object in view,” says 
Francke, “is that all children may be instructed above 
all things in the vital knowledge of God and Christ, and 
be initiated into the principles of true religion.” He 
goes so far as to insist : — 
“Only the pious man is a good member of society. Without 
sincere piety, all knowledge, all prudence, all worldly culture, is 
more hurtful than useful, and we are never secure against its 
misuse.” : 
His position is, therefore, a real return to the Reforma- 
tion emphasis upon faith and non-ceremonial worship. 
Nevertheless, it has been clear that he was sufficiently 
affected by the times to found his schools somewhat with 
reference to existing social strata, and he distinctly 
declares, “In all instruction we must keep the pupil’s 
station and future calling in mind.” 
Course and Methods in His Schools 
Naturally, then, the subject most emphasized in all 
of Francke’s schools was religion. In the elementary

schools, four out of seven hours each day were given to 
Bible study, catechism, prayer, and pious observances, 
and the reading and writing were based ‘upon the Scrip- 
tures as material. After learning to read, a pupil studied 
arithmetic for four hours, and vocal music for two hours 
each week. Incidentally, the course was enriched with 
a knowledge of ‘real’ or useful things, such as the simplest 
facts of astronomy and physics, bits of geographical and 
historical information, and various household arts. 
In the Padagogium, not only was religion the chief 
study, but Greek and Hebrew were taught largely for 
the sake of exegesis, compositions were written in Latin 
upon Bible subjects, and French was learned through a 
New Testament in that language. The realistic turn 
to Francke’s work also appeared in training in the ver- 
nacular, in such studies as mathematics, German oratory, 
history, and geography, and in the elements of natural 
science, arts, and crafts, and of astronomy, anatomy, 
and materia medica. He also added the management 
of estates, gardens, and vineyards, and such other knowl- 
edge as the upper classes of society would find useful. 
As the pupils in the Schola Latina were not of sufficient 
social standing to demand it, the French and some of 
the practical studies of the Pddagogium were omitted, 
but the curriculum was otherwise the same. The Real- 
schule went more fully into the mathematics, sciences, 
and useful subjects than did the Pddagogium. The
-P-A-G-E-83
ae 
  FRANCKE AND HIS INSTITUTIONS 73 
work in the Téchterschule was not unlike that in the Latin 
school, but included the household arts and other occu- 
pational studies and ‘accomplishments.’ 
While the course in all of Francke’s schools was dis- 
tinctly disciplinary in theory, good pedagogy was not 
altogether neglected. The teachers were directed by 
his treatise to study each individual pupil, and were ad- 
vised how to train children to concentrate, observe, and 
reason. Although much memorizing was practiced, 
“children were not to be permitted to learn to prattle 
words without understanding them.” This comprehen- 
sion of the work was, of course, increased by applying 
all studies to everyday life. The pupils wrote formal 
letters, receipts, and bonds, and their mathematical 
problems were based upon practical transactions. The 
discipline in all the schools of Francke, in consequence, 
though strict, was mild and humane. 
The Influence of Francke’s Institutions 
From these schools, together with the orphanage, 
seminary, and ‘free table’ as a nucleus, have developed 
the now celebrated organization known as Franckesche 
Stiftungen (‘Francke’s Institutions’). “It is difficult 
to decide,” says Adamson, ‘‘whether the most surprising 
feature is their humble beginning, or their rapid growth 
and steady adaptation of means to ends.” In spite of

These institutions have since been increased in num- 
ber, and there are now some twenty-five enterprises 
conducted in a large group of structures built about a 
double court. Among the additions are a printing 
plant and bindery, a bookstore, a Bible house, a drug 
store and dispensary, and a home for women, as well as 
a Realgymnasium' and a Vorschule Through these 
institutions more than four thousand persons are being 
provided with the means of an education or livelihood, 
‘and many good causes are advanced. Over one million

appropriations, tuition fees, and profits upon the enter- 
prises, are expended each year in maintaining the in- 
stitutions. .

studies of the Pdédagogium and Schola Latina have been

have somewhat affected the curricula of the Gymnasien. , 
The Realschule of Semler was brought in a slightly modi- 
fied form to Berlin by Hecker, one of the teachers in the 
Pédagogium. From the capital it spread gradually 
throughout Prussia, until it was taken into the public 
system, and is to-day one of the most important features. 
The seminary, or training school for teachers, has been 
adopted by practically every one of the German states. 
Further, since in the various schools of Francke were 
realized the chief ideals of most educational reformers 
up to that time, Germany was thereby given a concrete 
example of what it might best strive to imitate. Again, 
by means of teachers trained in his system at the semi- 
nary, all Germany has been leavened with the spirit of 
the great Pietist. 
As to Pietism itself, however, while originally a pro- 
test against creed and ceremonial, in later years it lost 
much of its living power and deteriorated into a formal- 
ism in religious life and thought. It magnified even the 
smallest of daily doings into expressions of piety, and 
became, like Puritanism, pervaded with affectation and 
cant. To a great extent its schools, with their spiritual 
purpose and content, then lapsed into merely inefficient 
classes in formal catechism, and all hold upon real living 
was lost. The religious revival of Spener and the edu- All Germany

CHAPTER VII 
ROUSSEAU AND NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 
THE inconsistencies and contradictions of Rousseau 
are almost proverbial. But in his antecedents and ca- 
reer can be found a ready explanation for the positions © 
of this most illogical writer. The theories of no man are 
‘more clearly a product of his heredity, experience, and 
- times, and, thanks to his own mercilessly frank Con-— 
fessions, there are few instances in history where the 
life and environment of any other personage are known 
in so much detail. 
The Life, Training, and Times of Rousseau 
Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) was born of upper- 
class parentage in the simple Protestant city of Geneva. 
His father, a watchmaker, was descended from a Parisian 
family, and inherited much of the romanticism, mercurial 
temperament, and love of pleasure of his forbears. The 
mother of Rousseau, too, although the daughter of a 
clergyman, was of a morbid and sentimental disposition. 
1 The Confessions carry his life from early childhood up to his expulsion 
from the Ile de Saint Pierre and his preparation to go to Hume. See p. 104. 
We are largely dependent upon the Reveries and Letters for the rest of his 
biography.

She died at the birth of Jean Jacques, and the child was 
brought up by an indulgent aunt, who made little attempt 
to correct his pilfering and lying, and utterly failed to 
instil in him any real moral principles. This general 
tendency toward a want of self-control was further in- 
creased by the careless attitude of his father. While 
the boy was but six, the elder Rousseau sat up with him 
night after night until daylight reading the silliest and 
most sensational of romances from the extensive collec- 
tion left by his wife. Thus were nurtured within the 
child an extreme emotionality, imaginativeness, and pre- 
cocity. After a year or so the novels were exhausted, 
and Rousseau was forced to turn for material to the 
more sensible library of his grandfather, the preacher. 
The works the child found here, such as the Parallel 
Lives of Plutarch and the standard histories of the day, 
made quite as profound an impression upon his character. 
They contributed to his sense of heroism and what he 
afterward termed “that republican spirit and love of 
liberty, that haughty and invincible turn of mind, which 
rendered me impatient of restraint.” His want of con- 
trol may in this way have first come to turn itself toward 
- revolution and the destruction of existing society. 
The two years following this period Jean Jacques 
spent in the village of Bossey, just outside Geneva, where 
he had been sent with a cousin of about the same age to 
be educated. Here his love of nature, which had already
-P-A-G-E-89
ee ROUSSEAU AND NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 79 
been cultivated by the beauties of Genevan environment, 
was greatly heightened. He found a wonderful enjoy- 
ment in this rural life, until a severe punishment for a 
boyish offense turned all to dross. Thereupon, he de- 
clares, he began to evolve the theory that it is through 
restraint and discipline of the impulses and departure 
from nature that humanity has ever been corrupted and 
‘ruined, and it may well be that later on, from his adult 
standpoint, this experience seemed to have contributed to 
what tlien became the central feature of his philosophy. 
After this the boy returned to Geneva and spent a 
couple of years in idleness and sentimentality. Then, 
during trade apprenticeships lasting four years, he was 
further corrupted by low companions and gave free 
rein to his impulses to loaf, lie, and steal. Eventually, 
he ran away from the city, and spent several years in 
vagrancy, dissoluteness, and menial service. During 
this time the beauties of nature were more than ever 
impressed upon the youth by the wonderful scenery of the 
Savoy country through which he passed, and his educa- 
tion was somewhat improved by incidental instruction 
from a relative of one of the families he served. Finally, 
at nineteen, Rousseau went to stay in Savoy with 
Madame de Warens, a person of shallow character and 
considerable beauty. In the decade he lived there, 
under most anomalous conditions, upon the meager 
pension of a woman, he obtained further sporadic train- departure

His want of 
self-control, 
love of na- 
ture, and 
sympathy with the op- 
pressed, were 
strengthened 
by his 
wanderings. 
     
-P-A-G-E-90
  His attitude 
blended well 
with the

ments of the 
period. 80 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
ing in Latin, music, philosophy, and some of the sciences. 
Through occasional wanderings he also strengthened 
his love of nature and learned to sympathize with the 
condition of the poor and oppressed. At length he and 
Madame de Warens grew tired of each other, and Rous- 
seau gravitated to Paris. In this city he was forced to 
earn a livelihood for himself and Thérése Le Vasseur, a 
coarse and stupid servant girl, with whom he lived for 
the rest of his life. He thus began to develop some sense 
of responsibility. 
While Rousseau’s days of vagabondage were now over, 
they had left an ineffaceable stamp upon him. His 
sensitiveness, impulsiveness, love for nature, and sym- 
pathy for the poor, together with his inaccurate and un- 
systematic education, were ever afterward in evidence. 
And it can be seen that these characteristics of Rous- 
seau blended well with a body of inchoate sentiments 
and vague longings of this period that were striving for 
expression. These were the days of Louis XV and royal 
absolutism, when the administration of all affairs in the 
kingdom was controlled nominally by the monarch, but 
really by a small clique of idle and extravagant courtiers 
about him. It was necessary for those who had any 
desire for advancement to seek to attach themselves to 
the court and adopt its elaborate rules and customs. In 
consequence, a most artificial system of etiquette and 
conduct had grown up everywhere in the upper class of
-P-A-G-E-91
| | ROUSSEAU AND NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 81 
society. Under this veneer and extreme conventionality 
were the degraded peasants, ground down by taxation, 
deprived of their rights, and obliged to minister to the 
pleasure of a vicious leisure class. But against this op- 
pression and decadence there had gradually arisen an un- 
defined spirit of protest and a tendency to hark back to 
simpler conditions. There had come into the air a feeling. 
that the despotism and artificiality of the times were due 
to the departure of civilized man from an original benefi- 
cent state of nature, and that above all legislation and 
institutions was a natural law in complete harmony with 
the divine will. Hence it happened that Rousseau, emo- 
tional, uncontrolled, and half-trained, was destined to 
bring to consciousness and give voice to the revolutionary 
and naturalistic ideas and tendencies of the century. 
His Discourses, and The New Heloise, Social 
Contract, and Emile 
For some time, among other methods of securing a 
living, he had been attempting literary production, when 
by a curious accident in 1750 he leaped into fame as a 
writer. The preceding year the Academy of Dijon? 
had proposed as a theme for a prize essay: Has the prog-

purify morals? + This inquiry seems to have suddenly 
brought to a focus all the chaotic thought that had been 
surging within Rousseau, and with much fervor and con- 
viction, though most illogically, he declared that the 
existing oppression and corruption of society were due 
to the advancement of civilization. In the discourse 
written by him he contrasts the rugged conduct of men 
in the primitive ages with the artificial manners of his 
day, under which were cloaked impiety, deception, and 
arrogance. He undertakes to show from the history of 
the Oriental and classical nations that this degeneracy 
has ever been caused by the development of the arts and 
sciences and the attempt to pass from that happy state 
of ignorance in which men are placed by nature. Rous- 
seau’s essay won the prize and created a tremendous 
stir. Three years later he competed for another prize 
offered by the same acadeniy on the subject: The origin 
of inequality among men? In his discourse on this subject 
Rousseau holds that the physical and intellectual in- 
equalities of nature which existed in primitive society were 
scarcely noticeable, but that, with the growth of civiliza- 
tion, most oppressive distinctions arose, especially through 
the institution of private property. He declares : — 
“The first man who, having inclosed a piece of ground, could 
think of saying, ‘This is mine,’ and found people simple enough to

believe him, was the real founder of civil society. How many 
crimes; wars, murders, miseries, and horrors would not have been 
spared to the human race by any one who, pulling up the stakes 
or filling in the trench, could have called out to his fellows: ‘Be- 
ware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you forget 
that the earth belongs to no one, and that its fruits are for all!’” 
For, he claims, it is the institution of property that 
soon led to robbery and insecurity, and this brought about 
civilization and laws to protect the accumulations of the 
wealthy. Through a law-governed society the poor were 
thrown more deeply into bondage and a new power was 
added to the rich? . 
As Rousseau’s democratic and revolutionary spirit 
developed, Paris, with its hypocritical and cold-blooded 
atmosphere, became more and more stifling to him. 
Finally, in 1756, he withdrew to the village of Mont- 
morency and the society of devoted friends. Here in 
1761, after a period of idleness and a most unfortunate 
1 The following ironical letter written by Voltaire to Rousseau concern- 
ing this work exposes the fundamental weakness of the author’s philos- 
ophy :— 
“T have received your new book against the human race and thank you 
for it. Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all 
stupid. One longs on reading your book to walk on all fours. But as I 
have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the im- 
possibility of renewing it. Nor can I embark in search of the savages of. 
Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render'a Euro- 
pean surgeon necessary to me; because war is going-on in those regions; 
and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as 
bad as ourselves.” After with- 
drawing to

rency, he 
produced by

tract, and

love affair, he produced his remarkable romance, The 
New Heloise, and in the following year his influential 
essay on political ethics, known as the Social Contract,? 
and that most revolutionary treatise on education, the 
Emile. The New Heloise departs somewhat -from the 
complete return to nature sought in the two discourses. 
It commends a restoration of as much of the primitive 
simplicity of living as the crystallized traditions and 
institutions of society will permit. While the first part 
of the work is filled with passion and illicit love,’ the 
last is an exaltation of marriage and the family, and of 
the happiness and peace of rural life. In the Social Con- 
tract, Rousseau also finds the ideal state, not in that of 
nature, but in a society managed by the people, where 
simplicity and natural wants control, and aristocracy 
and artificiality do not exist. A state of nature, how- 
ever, is still the starting-point. Civilized society orig- 
inated when men in the primitive condition found the 
obstacles to self-preservation too strong, and sought by 
association to protect the person and property of all. 
The body thus constituted is sovereign, and every citizen 
is a member of it. The government which it sets up, 
whether a monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy, may, 
therefore, be abolished at any time by the general will

of the people. The furore that this doctrine created 
in church and monarch-ridden France can easily be 
imagined. 
The Purpose of the Emile 
But the work that has made the name of Rousseau . 
famous and most concerns us here is his Emile. This 
treatise and the two discourses their author declared to 
be “three inseparable works, which together form a single 
whole.” He might well have included also the New 
Heloise and the Social Contract, especially as the Emile 
assumes more nearly the modified position of the later 
works, and undertakes to show how education might 
minimize the drawbacks of civilization and bring man 
as near to nature as possible. As the Social Contract 
and his discourses were written to counteract the op- 
pressive social and political conditions, the Emile aims 
to replace the conventional and formal education ot the 
day with a training that should be natural and spontane- 
ous. We learn that under this ancien régime little boys 
had their hair powdered, wore a sword, ‘the chapeau 
under the arm, a frill, and a coat with gilded cuffs,’ that 
a girl was dressed in equally ridiculous imitation of a 
fashionable woman, and that education was largely one 
of deportment and the dancing master, for “this is to 
be the great thing for them when they become men and 
women, and for this reason it is the thing of chief impor- The Emile

tance for them as children.”! On the intellectual side, 
education was largely traditional and consisted chiefly of 
a training in Latin grammar, words, and memoriter work. 
Rousseau scathingly criticized these practices and pleaded 
for reform. Hence in the Emile he applies his natur- 
alistic principles to the education of an imaginary pupil 
of that name “from the moment of his birth up to the 
time when, having become a mature man, he will no 
Its divided longer need any other guide than himself.” The work 
parts: is divided into five parts, four of which deal with Emile’s 
education in the stages of infancy, childhood, boyhood, 
and youth respectively, and the fifth with the training 
of the girl who is to become his wife. 
The Five Books of the Emile 
@ “infancy,” Rousseau starts the first book with a re-statement 
pupil ite of his basal principle that “everything is good as it comes 
beremoved from the hands of the Author of Nature; but everything from society, 
aad given a degenerates in the hands of man.” After elaborating 
physica this, he shows that we are educated by “three kinds of 
teachers, — nature, men, and things, and since the co- 
operation of the three educations is necessary for their 
perfection, it is to the one over which we have no con- 
trol (i.e. nature) that we must direct the other two.”

Education must, therefore, conform to nature, and must. 
be a means not of preparing for citizenship in any par- 
ticular government, much less for an ‘occupation, but 
of developing manhood and fitting for ‘the duties of 
human life.’ “To live,” says Rousseau of his pupil, 
“is the trade I wish to teach him.” For so delicate a 
task the training of the child must be undertaken by his 
parents, or if, as in the case of Emile, he is an orphan, by 
a trustworthy tutor, who can secure his full confidence. 
As an infant, Emile must be removed to the country, 
where he will be close to nature and farthest from the 
contaminating influences of civilization. His growth 
and training must be as spontaneous as possible. He 
must have nothing to do with either medicine or doctors, 
“unless his life is in evident danger; for then they can 
do nothing worse than kill him.” His natural movements 
must not be restrained by caps, bands, or swaddling 
clothes, and he should be nursed by his own mother. 
1It is clear from the mention of a tutor that Rousseau had in mind 
reforming only the unnatural education of the upper class. With all his 
sympathy for the downtrodden peasants, he did not feel the need of 
improving their training. He is rather impressed with their opportunity 
. for free development, saying, “The poor man needs no education, for his 
condition forces one upon him.” 
- ® The effect of this teaching of Rousseau upon the fashionable French - 
mothers was not altogether happy. When this ‘return to nature’ came 
to be a fad, these ladies did not abandon society, but had the infants 
brought in at dessert, when the mothers were filled with wine and food, 
or in the intervals of the dance, when they were overheated, and gave

He should likewise be used to baths of all sorts of tem- 
perature. In fact, the child should not be forced into 
any fixed ways whatsoever, since, with Rousseau, habit 
is necessarily something contrary to impulse and so un- 
natural and a thing to be shunned. “The only habit,” - 
says he, “which the child should be allowed to form is 
to contract no habit whatsoever.” Since, however, ugly 
objects, alarming sounds, and the dark exist in nature, 
he should be gradually accustomed to them. When he 
cries for a reason, he should be cared for, but when from 
caprice or obstinacy, he should not be heeded, or, if it 
is necessary to divert his attention, it should be without 
his suspecting it. His playthings should not be “gold 
or silver bells, coral, elaborate crystals, toys of all kinds 
and prices,” but such simple products of nature as 
“branches with their fruits and flowers, or a poppy-head 
in which the seeds are heard to rattle.” Language that 
is simple, plain, and hence natural, should be used with 
him, and he should not be hurried beyond nature in 
learning to talk. He should be restricted to a few words 
that express real thoughts for him. 
The education of Emile during infancy is thus to be 
purely physical. The aim is simply to keep his instincts 
them their natural sustenance at that time. Nevertheless, Rousseau did 
permanently modify the attitude toward children and the treatment of 
them. Parents entered into more intimate relations with their children 
and found time to look after their education.

and impulses, which, Rousseau holds, are good by nature, 
free from vice, and his intelligence free from error. This 
natural and negative education is continued in the second 
book, which deals with the child between the years of 
five and twelve. No moral training is to be given as 
such, for “until he reaches the age of reason, he can form 
no idea of moral beings or social relations.” Rousseau 
maintains that “the terms obey and command are pro- 
scribed from his vocabulary, and still more the terms duty 
and obligation.” Certain lessons are, however, to be the 
taught him indirectly by a control of his environment, 
for ‘the terms force, necessity, impotency, and constraint 
should have a large place” with him, and “he is to be 
taught by experience.” He is to learn through ‘natural 
consequences’ until he arrives at the age for understand- 
ing moral precepts. If he breaks the furniture or the 
windows, let him suffer the inconveniences that arise 
from his act. Do not preach to him or punish him for 
lying, but afterward affect not to believe him even when 
he has spoken the truth. If he carelessly digs up the 
sprouting melons of the gardener, in order to plant beans 
for himself, let the gardener in turn uproot the beans, 
and thus cause him to learn the sacredness of property. 
In intellectual matters, too, Rousseau condemns the 
usual unnatural practice of requiring pupils to learn so 
much before they have reached the proper years. He 
rhetorically asks: ‘Shall I venture to state at this point (2) ‘child-

the most important, the most useful, rule of all education ? 
It is not to gain time, but to lose it.” Hence during this 
period Emile is not to study geography, history, or lan- 
guages, upon which pedagogues ordinarily depend to 
exhibit the attainments of their pupils, although these 
understand nothing of what they have memorized. He 
is not to commit fables to memory, for he will be very 
likely to misapply the moral. Rousseau even goes so far 
as to declare: — . 
“Tn thus relieving children of all their school tasks, I take away 
the instrument of their greatest misery, namely, books. Reading 
is the scourge of childhood, and almost the sole occupation that we 
know how to give them. At the age of twelve, Emile will hardly 
know what a book is. But I shall be told that it is very necessary 
that he know how to read. ThisI grant. It is necessary that he 
know how to read when reading is useful to him. Until then, it 
serves only to annoy him.” 
The chief function of education at this period is to 
develop the body and “keep the soul fallow,” for, ‘in 
order to think, we must exercise our limbs, our senses, and 
our organs, which are the instruments of our intelli- 
gence.” “To obtain this training, Emile is to wear short, 
loose, and scanty clothing, go bareheaded, and have the 
body inured to cold and heat, and be generally subjected 
to a ‘hardening process’ similar to that recommended 
by Locke.!| He should have plenty of time for sleep, 
although he should learn to have it interrupted and to

endure a hard bed. He must learn to swim, to protect 
himself from drowning, and must prepare for emergencies, 
by practicing long and high jumps, leaping walls, and 
scaling rocks. His senses are to be exercised on natural 
problems in weighing and measuring masses and dis- 
tances; his hand and eye are to be trained by drawing 
from nature about him, and his ear is to be rendered 
sensitive to harmony by learning to sing. 
There comes, however, between twelve and fifteen, 
after the boy’s body and senses have been trained, “an 
interval when the power of the individual is greater 
than his desires, which is the period of his greatest 
relative strength.” This period, which is dealt with in 
his third book, Rousseau declares, is intended by nature 
itself as “the time of labor, instruction, and study.” 
But it is obvious even to our unpractical author that 
not much can be learned within three years, and he 
accordingly decides to limit instruction to “merely, that 
which is useful.” And even of useful studies the boy 
should not be expected to learn those “truths which 
require, for being comprehended, an understanding 
already formed, or which dispose an inexperienced mind 
to think falsely on’ other subjects.” After eliminating 
all useless, incomprehensible, and misleading studies, 
Rousseau finds that natural sciences alone remain as 
mental pabulum for the boy. The natural method for 
acquiring these subjects, he believes, is through an 
‘ (3)* boy- hood,’ be-

and fifteen, 
when he is to

appeal to the curiosity and instinct for investigation. 
“Ask questions that are within his comprehension, and 
leave him to resolve them. Let him know nothing 
because you have told it to him, but because he has 
comprehended it himself; he is not to learn science, 
but to discover it. If you ever substitute in his mind 
authority for reason, he will no longer reason.” So 
Rousseau. contrasts the current methods of teaching 
astronomy and geography by means of globes, maps, 
and other misleading representations, with the more 
natural plan of stimulating inquiry by observing the 
sun when rising and setting during the different seasons, 
and by studying the topography of the neighborhood 
and drawing maps of it. Emile is taught to appreciate 
the value of these subjects by being lost in the forest, 
and, in his efforts to find a way out, discovering a use 
for them. He learns the elements of electricity by 
meeting with a juggler, who attracts an artificial duck 
by means of a concealed magnet. He similarly dis- 
covers through experience the effect of cold and heat 
upon solids and liquids, and so comes to understand the 
thermometer and other instruments. Hence Rousseau 
feels that all knowledge of real value may be acquired 
clearly and naturally without the use of rivalry or text- 
books. “TI hate books,” he says; “they merely teach 
us to talk of what we do not know.” But he finds one 
book, “‘where all the natural needs of man are exhibited 
+
-P-A-G-E-103
  ROUSSEAU AND NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 93 
in a manner obvious to the mind of a child, and where 
the means of providing for these needs are successively 
developed with the same facility.” This book, Robin- 
son Crusoe, should be carefully studied by Emile. In 
order to lear the interdependence of men from the 
industrial rather than the moral side, Emile and his 
tutor now also labor in the various arts, and that he 
may be independent of changes in fortune and revolutions 
_ in government, the boy is to learn a trade. Cabinet- 
making, as being ‘nearest to the state of nature’ and most 
capable of exercising both mind and body, is chosen. 
Emile is now fifteen, and his mind is prepared to 
receive an ethical training’ This is treated in the fourth 
book, which is the most brilliant and chimerical of all. 
The motive of education has hitherto been self-interest, 
and the object self-development. Emile must now 
learn to live with others and be trained in social rela- 
tionships. He is to be made affectionate, moral, and 
religious. “We have formed his body, his senses, and 
his intelligence ; it remains to give him a heart.” The su- 
’ preme importance of the adolescent period for this moral 
training is recognized by Rousseau in the declaration : — 
“This critical time, though very short, has lasting influences. 
Here is the second birth of which I have spoken; it is here that

man really begins to live, and nothing human is foreign to him. 
So far our cares have been but child’s play; it.is only now that 
they assume a real importance. This epoch, where ordinary 
education ends, is properly one where ours ought to begin.” 
“To turn his character toward benevolence and 
goodness” during this impressionable age, Rousseau 
declares, is to be accomplished not through precepts, 
but in a natural way by bringing the youth into contact 
with his fellow men and appealing to his emotions. 
Emile is to visit infirmaries, hospitals, and prisons, and 
witness concrete examples of wretchedness in all stages, 
although not so frequently as to become hardened. 
That this training may not render him cynical or hyper- 
critical, it should be corrected by the study of history, 
where one sees men simply as a spectator without feel- 
ing or passion. Further, in order to deliver Emile from 
vanity, so common during adolescence, he is to be 
exposed to flatterers, spendthrifts, and sharpers, and 
allowed to suffer the consequences. He may at this 
time also be guided in his conduct by the use of fables, 
for “by censuring the wrongdoer under an unknown 
mask, we instruct without offending him.” In a simi- 
larly indirect and informal fashion Emile’ is to be given 
his religious education. Until now he has been taught 
nothing about God or the human soul, as Rousseau 
holds that “it would be much better to have no idea of 
the Divinity than to have ideas which are low, fanciful,
-P-A-G-E-105

wrong or unworthy of him.” But now “the natural 
progress of his intelligence carries his researches in that 
direction” and “from the study of nature he comes 
without difficulty to a search for its Author.” Under 
the guise of the Savoyard Vicar’s! Profession of Faith 
Rousseau describes the deism, or naturalistic views, 
which his pupil is to adopt. This formulation, which is 
written in stately but impassioned language, while de- 
parting from the position of the traditionalized Church 
of the day, is not, like the attacks of the rationalists, 
, merely destructive. It seeks to replace organized Chris- 
tianity with a natural and undogmatic religion. The 
vicar declares :— 
“TI perceive God everywhere in his works; I feel him in myself; 
I see him universally around me. But when I fain would seek 
where he is, what he is, of what substance, he glides away from me, 
and my troubled soul discerns nothing. The less I can conceive . 
him, the more I adore. I bow myself down, and say to him, O 
being of beings, I am because thou art; to meditate ceaselessly on 
thee by day and by night is to raise myself to my veritable source 
and fount.” 
Emile at length becomes a man, and a life companion 
must be found for him. A search should be made for a

suitable lady, but “in order to find her, we must know 
her.” Accordingly, the last book of the Emile deals 
with the model Sophie and the education of woman. 
It is the weakest part of his work, for here Rousseau 
completely abandons the individualistic training to be 
given the man. He insists: — 
“The whole education of women ought to be relative to men. 
To please them, to be useful to them, to make themselves loved 
and honored by them, to educate them when young, to care for 
them when grown, to counsel them, to console them, to make life 
agreeable and sweet to them — these are the duties of women at 
all times, and what should be taught them from infancy.” 
Like. men, women should be given adequate bodily 
training, but rather for the sake of physical charms and 
of producing vigorous offspring than for their own 
development. Their instinctive love of pleasing through 
dress should be made of service by teaching them sew- 
ing, embroidery, lace-work, and designing. Further, 
“girls ought to be obedient and industrious, and they 
ought early to be brought under restraint. Made to 
obey a being so imperfect as man, often so full of vices, 
and always so full of faults, they ought early to learn 
to suffer even injustice, and endure the wrongs of a 
husband without complaint.” Girls should be taught 
singing, dancing, and other accomplishments that will 
make them attractive without interfering with their 
submissiveness. They should be instructed dogmati-
-P-A-G-E-107
ROUSSEAU AND NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 97 
cally in religion at an early age. “Every daughter 
should have the religion of her mother, and every wife 
that of her husband.” In ethical matters they should 
be largely guided by public opinion. A woman may 
not learn philosophy, art, or science, but she should 
study men. ‘She must learn to penetrate their feelings 
through their conversation, their actions, their looks, 
and their gestures, and know how to give them the 
feelings which are pleasing to her, without even seeming 
to think of them.” 
Such was Rousseau’s notion of a natural and indi- 
vidualistic education for a man and the passive and 
tepressive training suitable for a woman, and of the 
happiness and prosperity that were bound to ensue.! 
To make a fair estimate of the Emile is not easy. It is 
necessary to put aside all of one’s prejudices against the 
weak and offensive personality of the author and to 
view the contradictions of his life and writings in their 
true perspective. His work on education is probably 
the most extraordinary union of strength and weakness, 
fascination and repulsion, high ideals and unpracticality, 
1 Later on, Rousseau seems to have had misgivings as to the effect of 
this training, and started a work called Emile and Sophie, or the Solitaries. 
This consists of a series of letters from Emile to his tutor, in which Rous- 
seau endeavors to show how, even if adversity should overtake his pupil, 
the natural education would still be the best. At every turn Emile rises 
superior to his misfortunes, exhibits the most valuable knowledge and 
Fesources, and comes rapidly into places of honor and emolument.

are out- 
weighed by its merits:

that was ever produced. But its errors and illusions are 
fully outweighed by great truths and lofty sentiments, 
and, in making an appraisal, one should offset the grave 
defects of the book by its still larger merits. 
The Merits and Defects of the Emile 
The Emile, it must be admitted at the start, is often 
illogical, erratic, and inconsistent. Rousseau constantly 
sways from optimism to pessimism, from spontaneity 
to authority, from liberalism to intolerance. While he 
holds that society is thoroughly corrupt, he has great 
confidence in the goodness of all individuals of which it 
is composed. In the face of history and psychology, he _ 
opposes nature to culture, and creates a dualism between 
emotion and reason. Although the instincts and re- 
actions of Emile are apparently given free play, they 
are really under the constant guidance of his tutor. 
The supposed isolation of the pupil is conveniently for- 
gotten on occasion by attendance at fairs, parties, and 
competitions with his fellows. Emile is to have his 
individuality developed to its utmost, but Sophie’s is to 
be trained out of her. However, in spite of such glaring 
inconsistencies, the Emile has at all times been ac- 
counted a work of great richness and power. The 
brilliant thought, the underlying wisdom of many of 
his suggestions, the sentimental appeal, and the clear,
-P-A-G-E-109
ROUSSEAU AND NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 99 
enthusiastic, and ardent presentation have completely 
overbalanced ‘its contradictions and logical deficien- 
cies. 
The most marked feature of the Rousselian education 
and the one most subject to criticism has been its ex- 
treme revolt against civilization and all social control. 
A state of nature is held to be the ideal condition, and 
all social relations are regarded as degenerate. The 
child is to be brought up in isolation by the laws of 
brute necessity and to have no social or political educa- 
tion until he is fifteen, when an impossible set of expe- 
dients for bringing him into touch with-his fellows is 
devised: The absurdity of this anti-social education 
has always been keenly felt. Children cannot be 
reared in a social vacuum, nor can they be trained 
merely as world citizens to the complete exclusion of 
specific governmental authority. And although society 
may become stereotyped and corrupt, it yet furnishes 
the means of carrying the accumulated race experience 
and attainments. One should remember, however, that 
the times and the cause had need of just so extreme a 
doctrine. The reformer is often forced to assume the 
position of a fanatic, in order to secure attention for his 
propaganda. Had Rousseau’s cry been uttered a gen- 
eration later, when society had become less artificial 
and more responsive to popular rights, it might have 
contained less exaggeration. But at the time such It is anti-

and an ex-

necessary. 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  | It fails to understand

individualism alone could enable him to break the 
bondage to the past. By means of paradoxes and 
exaggerations he was able to emphasize the crying 
need of a natural development of man, and to tear 
down the effete traditions in educational organiza- 
tion, content, and methods. Moreover, the fallacy 
involved in such an isolated education is too pal- 
pable to deceive any one, and is scarcely sufficient 
for condemning Rousseau. On the contrary, those 
who have most admired him and endeavored to de- 
velop his theories — Basedow, Pestalozzi, Herbart, and 
Froebel — have all most insistently stressed social activ- 
ities in the training of children. 
About this position of natural and unsocial education 
described in the Emile cluster several elements of weak- 
ness and strength. In the first place, Rousseau is abso- 
lutely opposed to all book learning and exaggerates the 
value of personal observation and inference. He con- 
sequently neglects the past, and robs the pupil of all 
the experience of his fellows and of those who have 
gone before. But he develops the details of obser- 
vational and experimental work in elementary training 
to an extent never previously undertaken, and em- 
phasizes physical activity as a means to the growth and 
intellectual development of children. 
Again, a fact of far greater importance is that, although 
Rousseau’s knowledge of children was exceedingly defec-
-P-A-G-E-111
  ~ 
  ROUSSEAU AND NATURALISM IN EDUCATION tot 
tive,! and his recommendations were marred by unnat- 
ural breaks and filled with sentimentality, he saw the 
need of studying the child as the only basis for edu- 
cation. In the Preface to the Emile he declares : — 
“We do not know childhood. Acting on the false ideas we 
have of it, the farther we go the farther we wander from the right 
path. The wisest among us are engrossed in what the adult needs 
to know and fail to consider what children are able to apprehend. 
We are always looking for the man in the child, without thinking 
of what he is before he becomes a man. This is the study to which 
I have devoted myself, to the end that, even though my whole 
method may be chimerical and false, the reader may still profit 
by my observations. I may have a very poor conception of what 
ought to be done, but I think I have the correct view of the subject 
on which we are to work. Begin, then, by studying your pupils 
more thoroughly, for assuredly you know nothing about them. 
Now if you read this book of mine with this purpose in view, I do 
not believe it will be without profit to you.” 
As a result of such appeals the child has become the 
center of discussion in modern training, and we may 
thank Rousseau for introducing a new principle into 
education. And, despite his limitations and prejudices, 
this unnatural and neglectful parent stated many details 
of child development with much force and clearness 
and gave an impetus to later reformers, who were able 
to correct his observations and make them more prac- 
ticable in education.

In this connection may be mentioned the sharp divi- 
sion that Rousseau makes of the pupil’s development 
into definite stages that seem but little connected with 
one another and his prescription of a distinct education 
for each period. This is often cited as a ruinous breach 
in the evolution of the individual, and the reductio ad 
absurdum of such an atomic training would seem to be 
reached in his hope of rendering Emile warm-hearted 
and pious after keeping him in the meshes of self-interest 
and doubt until he is fifteen. But such a criticism loses

of the times. sight of the remarkable contribution to educational 
theory and practice made thereby. Rousseau has shown 
that there are characteristic differences at different 
stages in the child’s life, but each ‘has a perfection or 
maturity of its own,’ and that only as the proper activi- 
ties are provided for each stage will it reach that ma- 
turity or perfection. It can be seen how these prin- 
ciples fulfill his contention that the child must be studied, 
and, if put into effect, they would demolish the type of 
education which then was struggling to introduce the 
pupil into studies and activities far in advance of his 
interests and capacities. 
Finally, we should, on the whole, commend Rous- 
seau’s religion of nature and deism. While it is lacking 
in warmth, reality, and power, it did much to replace 
the institutionalized and dogmatic Christianity, which 
had been overwhelmed by the attacks of rationalism,
-P-A-G-E-113

with a pure, lofty, and tolerant faith. His mysterious 
Being penetrating all nature would seem a deity too 
vague and too removed to be of comfort and refresh- 
ment to human souls, but it was sufficient to purify the 
dying hierarchical system and duly stress the common 
interests of humanity. 
The Influence of Rousseau upon Society and Literature 
So revolutionary a work as the Emile could hardly 
escape the wrath of the despotic government and hier- 
archy. The month following its publication, the Par- 
liament! of Paris ordered the book to be burnt and its 
writer arrested on the charge of irreligion, and shortly 
afterward the theological doctors of the Sorbonne and 
the Archbishop of Paris likewise condemned it. Rous- 
seau avoided arrest by fleeing from Montmorency, and 
from that time until his death was driven from pillar 
to post, at first by the tyranny of the rulers in Church 
and State, and later by his own morbid imagination. 
He would have taken asylum in Geneva, but he found, 
upon reaching Yverdun, that the Council had closed 
the gates of his native city to him, and decreed the burn- 
ing of both the Emile and the Social Contract. A similar

persecution met him wherever he went in Switzerland, 
and in 1766 he fled to England at the invitation of the 
philosopher Hume. Here he soon imagined himself the 
victim of a plot, and returned to France, where for more 
than a decade he wandered about in the vicinity of Paris. 
In 1778 he died and was buried at Ermenonville.  Fif- 
teen years later, during the Reign of Terror, he was 
hailed as a liberator, and his mortal remains were borne 
. in triumph back to Paris by the revolutionists. There

dedicated by France to her greatest sons. 
This recognition was late, but deserved. No other 
person, indeed, has ever approached Rousseau in point- 
ing out the cares and distresses of the poor and op- 
pressed, as they drag along their existence and produce 
the prosperity which is concentrated in the hands of a 
small but privileged group. No works besides his 
treatises have so graphically depicted the need for a 
change of front in society, or sounded such a clarion 
call to the downtrodden to arise in battle. His anarchic 
and unsocial individualism complemented the rational- 
ism and intellectual skepticism of Voltaire, and there 
resulted a furious revolution and a blind reaction to the 
decadent order of society. Rousseau may not have 
caused the French Revolution, but, as Napoleon de- 
clared, it would have been impossible without him. 
His brilliant and emotional naturalism crystallized the
-P-A-G-E-115
ROUSSEAU AND NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 105 
spirit of the times. It furnished the watchwords of 
the Jacobins and later of the Committee of Public 
Safety, and shook France from center to circumference. 
Similarly, America, although inheriting her love of 
liberty from Anglo-Saxon ancestry, expressed her con- 
victions in formulas taken from the works of Rousseau. 
The American colonies seem to have assimilated the 
ideas, phrases, and even words! of the Gallic revolu- 
tionists and echoed them in the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence, the Articles of Confederation, and in various 
documents and debates. 
In many other ways the influence of Rousseau has 
been felt. While he has left no direct impress upon the 
tenets of political science, he has raised many inquiries ji, 
in that subject that have since had to be answered. 
He is largely responsible for the conception of socialism 
and of philosophic anarchy, although his economic 
writings do not advocate either in specific terms. In 
religion, the modern tendency to emphasize the emo- 
tional element, and at the same time to reject doctrines, 
ritualism, and extreme organization received an impetus 
from Rousseau. To him is largely due the development 
of romanticism in the literature of the late eighteenth 
and early nineteenth centuries. During that period 
sentimentality, heroicism, personal adventures, domi- 
nance of the emotions, analysis of the passions, and

inner conflicts pervade the writings of France, Germany, 
England, and America. Likewise, the descriptions of 
scenery and natural environment, and of the charm of 
the country, mountains, and lakes in literature, and the 
love for the natural, picturesque, and rural in art and 
architecture, largely find their beginnings in Rousseau’s 
naturalism. 
His Influence upon Educational Theory and Practice 
But the most complete revolution and the most 
potent effects of Rousselianism appear in educational . 
theory and practice. Few men have had as great an 
influence upon the organization, method, and content of 
education. Although his mission was largely to destroy 
traditionalism, and most of the specific features of his 
naturalism have in time been modified or rejected, 
many of the important principles in modern pedagogy 
go back to him. His criticism caused men to rush to 
the defense of existing systems, and when they failed 
in their attempts to reinstate them, they undertook the 
construction of something better. In the first place, 
his attitude toward the artificial, superficial, and in- 
human society of the times led him to oppose its arbi- 
trary authority and guidance of education according to 
an unnatural and traditional organization. He advo- 
cated the virtues of the primitive man and a simpler

basis of social organization, and held that all members 
of society should be trained so as to contribute to their 
own support and to be sympathetic and benevolent 
toward their fellows. Through him education has thus 
been more closely related to human welfare. The 
present-day emphasis upon the moral aim of education, 
the cultivation of social virtues, and the development of 
industrial education alike find some of their roots in 
the Emile. On the side of method and content also, 
education is indebted to the naturalism of Rousseau. 
He first insisted upon the study of children as funda- 
mental in education, and showed that the material or 
activities provided must be in keeping with the dif- 
ferent stages of development. Rousseau may, there- 
fore, be credited in part with the modern regard for the 
freedom of the child and the study of his psychological 
development. Through him we have come.to abandon 
the conception of the child as only an adult on a small 
scale. We may thank the Emile to some extent, too, 
for the increasing tendency to cease from forcing upon 
children a fixed method of thinking, feeling, and acting, 
and for the gradual disappearance of the old ideas that 
a task is of educational value according as it is dis- 
tasteful, and that real education consists in straining to 
overcome meaningless difficulties! It is likewise due to 
him primarily that we have recognized the need of physi-

cal activities, especially in the earlier development of 
the child, as a foundation for its growth. and learning. 
Further, it is the education of Emile that suggested 
familiarity with nature and natural phenomena as a 
means of counterbalancing the corrupt action of man, 
and, partly as a result of this, schools and colleges have 
come to include the study of physical forces, natural 
environment, plants, and animals. 
The great influence of Rousseau upon education in all 
its aspects is shown by the library of books since writ- 
ten to contradict, correct, or disseminate his doctrines. 
During the quarter of a century following the publica- 
tion of the Emile, probably more than twice as many 
books upon education were published as in the preceding 
three-quarters of a century. This epoch-making work 
created and forced a rich harvest of educational thinking 
for a century after its appearance, and it has affected 
our ideas upon pedagogical subjects from that day to 
this. But Rousseau’s principles did not take immediate 
root in the schools themselves, although their influence 
is manifest there as the nineteenth century advanced. 
In France they were apparent in the complaints and 
recommendations concerning schools in many of the 
cahiers* that were issued just prior to the Revolution, 
1 These were lists of grievances and desired reforms prepared by the 
various towns and villages throughout France at the request of the king 
(Louis XVI), in accordance with an old custom.

and afterward clearly formed a basis for much of the 
legislation concerning the universal, free, and secular or- 
ganization of educational institutions. In England, since 
there was no national system of schools, little direct 
impression was made upon educational practice, but in 
America this revolutionary thought would seem to have 
had much to do with causing the unrest that resulted 
in secularizing and universalizing the public system and 
in producing the foundation for the first public ‘high’

into actual practice the naturalistic education of Rous-

sion in another chapter.

Tht should, however, be noted here that the work of 
Rousseau was bound up in a revolution from the society, 
traditions, and education of the past. His theories 
involved a destruction of the old social and moral 
sanctions, but did not directly supply much to take their 
place. A new social order, philosophy, and education 
were needed to bring about truth and freedom and a 
reconstructed view of the world. The individual had 
demanded free sway, and it was now necessary to adjust

him to his environment without repressing his develop- 
ment. The transition from medievalism thus became 
logically complete. It appeared about the middle of the 
fourteenth century, and, proceeding through a series of 
interconnected and overlapping advances followed by 
retrogressions -- Renaissance, Reformation, Realism, 
Puritanism, Pictism, and Rationalism, — reached a gen- 
uinely destructive stage in Rousselianism toward the 
end of the eighteenth century. Evolution had failed, 
and revolution resulted, but through this was opened 
the vista of reconstruction on the modern basis.

BASEDOW AND THE PHILANTHROPINUM 
Basedow Johann Bernhard Basedow (1723-1790) was by nature 
thodex inthe very sort of person to be captivated by Rousseau’s 
theology ‘and doctrines. He was talented but erratic, unorthodox, 
professio. 
te esionof tactless, and irregular in life. He was the son of a 
Hamburg wigmaker, but refused to follow his father’s 
business and ran away. A gentleman with whom he 
took service discovered his remarkable ability and per- 
suaded the lad’s father to educate him. After due prep- 
aration at home, Basedow was sent to the University of 
Leipzig for a theological training, but soon proved heret- 
ical and again rejected the vocation chosen for him. 
He then (1749) became a tutor in Holstein to a Herr 
von Quaalen’s children, and with these aristocratic’ 
pupils first developed his famous methods of teaching 
through conversation and play connected with sur- 
rounding objects. Within four years his patron secured 
for him a professorship at the Ritterakademie! of Soroe, 
Denmark, but by 1761 he had given such sérious offense 
by his unorthodox utterances that the government felt 
obliged to transfer him to the Gymnasium at Altona.

From -his position here he flooded Germany with a 
variety of heretical essays, and-was eventually refused

Basedow’s Educational Reforms and Writings 
About this time, however, Basedow fell under the 
spell of Rousseau’s Emile, which was most congenial to 
his methods of thinking and teaching, and turned to 
educational reform. The schools of the day were sadly 
in need of just such an antidote as naturalism was. cal- 
culated to furnish, The rooms were dismal and the 
work unpleasant, physical training was neglected, and 
the discipline was severe. Children were regarded as 
adults in miniature, and were so treated both in their 
dress and their education. The boys had their hair 
“ curled, powdered, and smeared with pomade, and wore 
embroidered coats, dainty knee breeches, silk stockings, 
and swords. A boy standing by his father would have 
seemed to differ only in size. Little girls were bound 
up in whalebone waists, donned enormous hoop skirts, 
and wore upon their heads “a combination of false curls, 
puffs, and knots fastened with pins and crowned with 
plumes.” Education was largely a matter of instruction 
in artificial deportment.! The study of classics com-

posed the entire intellectual curriculum, and the methods 
were purely grammatical. 
As a result, Basedow’s suggestions for educational 
improvement attained as great popularity as his theo- 
logical productions had received abuse. After 1767 he 
was allowed by Bernstorff, the Minister of Education, 
to give all his time to reform and yet retain his salary. 
The following year, in his Address on Schools and Studies, 
and. their Influence on Public Happiness, he called gen- 
erally upon princes, governments, ecclesiastics, and 
others in power, to assist him in bringing out a work 
on elementary education, the plan of which was de- 
scribed in outline. The emperor of his native land, the 
sovereign of his adopted country, and several other 
tulers of Europe, together with such prominent persons 
as Bernstorff, Behrisch, Lavater, Goethe, and Kant, 
showed great interest, and a subsidy to the sum of ten 
thousand dollars was speedily raised. Six years later, 
Basedow completed his promised textbook, Elementar- 
werk, and the companion work for teachers and parents 
known as Methodenbuch. The Elementarwerk was issued 
in four volumes with one hundred accompanying plates, 
which were too large to be bound in with it, and con- 
tained many of the principles of Comenius as well as 
of Rousseau. It has, in fact, been referred to as ‘the 
Orbis Pictus! of the eighteenth century,’ ahd gives a

knowledge of things and words in the form of a dialogue. 
It deals first with natural phenomena and forces, then 
with morals and the mind, and the method of instruc- 
tion in natural religion, and finally with social duties, 
commerce, and affairs. The Methodenbuch, while not — 
following Rousseau literally, contains many ideas con- 
cerning the natural training of children that are sugges- 
tive of him. Later, Basedow, together with Campe, 
Salzmann, and others of his followers, also produced a 
series of popular books especially adapted to the char- bool 
acter, interests, and needs of children. Of these works, 
which are all largely filled with didactics, moralizing, 
religiosity, and scraps of scientific information, the best His followers

The Course and Methods of the Philanthropinum 
Eight years before this, however, Behrisch had in- 
duced Prince Leopold Friedrich Franz to allow Basedow 
to found at Dessau an educational institution, called the 
‘Philanthropinum,’ which should embody that reformer’s 
ideas. Leopold granted him a salary of eleven hundred ;

thalers,' and three years later gave him an equipment of 
buildings, grounds, and endowment. At first Basedow 
had but three assistants, but later the number was con- 
siderably increased. The staff then included several 
very able men, —such as Wolke, who had taught at 
Leipzig; Campe, chaplain at Potsdam; Salzmann, who 
had been a professor at Erfurt; and Matthison, the 
poet. The attendance at the Philanthropinum was very 
small in the beginning, since the institution was re- 
garded as an experiment, but eventually the number of 
pupils rose to more than fifty. They came from many 
different countries, and the school soon had a wide 
reputation throughout Europe. After it had been in 
existence about a year and a half, Basedow invited the 
scholars and distinguished men from everywhere to 
attend a great public examination and determine whether 
the school ought to continue. There are extant two 
accounts of this inspection, one by Professor Schummel 
of Magdeburg and the other by Basedow himself, and 
from these we gain most of our information concerning 
the institution. . 
The underlying principle of the school was | 
thing according to nature.”” The natural instine.s auu 
interests of the children were only to be directed and 
not altogether suppressed. They were to be trained as

cents.

children and not as adults, and the methods of learning 
were to be adapted to their stage of mentality. That 
all of the customary unnaturalness, discomfort, and 
want of freedom might be eliminated, the boys were 
plainly dressed in sailor jackets and loose trousers, their 
collars were turned down and were open at the neck, 
and their hair was cut short and was free from powder, 
pomade, and hair bags. 
While universal education was believed in, and rich 
and poor alike were to be trained, it was felt that the 
natural education of the one class was for social activity 
and leadership, and of the other for teaching. Conse- 
quently, the wealthy boys were to spend six hours in 
school and two in manual labor, while those from families 
of small means labored six hours and studied two. 
Every one, however, was taught handicrafts — car- 
pentry, turning, planing, and threshing —as a recognition 
of the educative value of constructive work. There 
were also physical exercises and games for all. On the 
intellectual side, while Latin was not neglected, more 
attention was paid to the vernacular and French than 
to the classics, in order that instruction might deal with 
realities rather than words. According to the Elemen- 
tarwerk, Basédow planned to create a wide objective and 
practical course.- It was to give some account of man, 
including bits of anthropology, anatomy, and physi- 
ology ; of brute creation, especially the uses of domestic instincts and 
interests.

animals and their relation to industry; of trees and

minerals and chemicals; of mathematical ‘and physical 
instruments ; and of trades, history, and commerce. He 
afterward admitted that he had overestimated the 
amount of content that was possible for a child, and 
greatly abridged this material.! 
The most striking characteristic of the school, however, 
was its improved methods. Languages were taught by , 
speaking and then by reading, and grammar was not 
brought in until late in the course. Facility was ace 
quired through conversation, games, pictures, drawing, 
acting plays, and reading on practical and interesting 
subjects. Similar linguistic methods had been recom- 
mended by Montaigne, Ratich, and Locke, and largely 
worked out by Comenius,” but were never before made 
as practical as by Basedow and his assistants. His in- 
struction in arithmetic, geometry, geography, physics, 
nature study, and history was fully as progressive as that 
in languages. Arithmetic was taught by mental meth- 
ods, geometry by drawing figures accurately and neatly, 
and geography by beginning with one’s home, and ex- 
tending out into the neighborhood, the town, the country, 
and the continent. In a similarly direct way the pupils 
“were instructed in matters of actual life. For example,

they cast lots in the classroom to-see who should have 
« the privilege of describing the tools and processes of a 
trade depicted in an engraving. Finally, the Philanthro- 
pinic plan for teaching the naturalistic religion of deism 
should be noted. The boys were prepared for learning 
of the existence of God by having their attention turned 
to various features and phenomena of nature and being 
asked what caused them. Then they were kept in the 
house for four or five days in a darkened room, so that 
they would be the more impressed with the wonders of 
creation when they should be released and told of the 
God whose handiwork it was.! 
. The Influence of the Philanthropinum 
Most visitors to the Philanthropinum were greatly 
pleased with the institution, especially on account of the 
interested and alert appearance of the pupils. Kant had 
such high expectations of its results as to declare in 1777 
that it meant “not a slow reform, but a quick revolu- 
tion,” and felt that “by the plan of organization it must 
of itself throw off all the faults which belong to its be- 
. ginning.” He afterward admitted that he had been too 
optimistic, but he still felt that the experiment had been 
well worth while, and had paved the way for better things. 
1 This method of religious education was first practiced by Wilke, but 
it had been suggested by Basedow in the Elementarwerk (Part I®pp. 87- 
90). Great expec- — 
tations were 
had for the 
school, and 
it proved a 
great stimu- 
lus for 
younger 
children, -

                      120 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE ‘CENTURIES 
Although it may not have served well for older pupils, it 
was certainly excellent in its stimulus to children under 
ten or twelve, who too often are naturally averse to books, 
and can be captured only by such appeals to the senses 
and to nature. 
Basedow proved temperamentally unfit to direct the 
institution. He soon left, and began to teach privately 
in Dessau and write educational works along the lines 
he had started. Campe, who first superseded him, with- 
drew within the year to found a similar school at Ham- 
burg. Institutions of the same type sprang up elsewhere, 
and some of them had a large influence upon education. 
In 1793 the Philanthropinum at Dessau was closed per- 
manently, and its teachers were scattered through Ger- 
many. Such followers as Wélke, Campe, and Salzmann 
carried on the Philanthropinic movement with great 
vigor. On account of its popularity it was adopted by 
a large number of others, who unfortunately were often 
mountebanks. They prostituted the system to their 
own ends, and the profession of. teaching was often 
degraded by them into a mere trade. Nevertheless, the 
Philanthropinum seems not to have been without good 
results, especially when we consider the educational con- 
ditions and the pedagogy of the times. It introduced 
- many new ideas into all parts of Germany and Switzer- 
land, and these were carefully worked out by such re- 
formers as Pestalozzi, Froebel, and Herbart. Hence,
-P-A-G-E-131

despite his visionary disposition, his intemperance, and 
his irregularity of living, the reformer who first at- 
tempted to embody the valuable aspects of Rousseau’s 
naturalism in the education of Germany was Basedow, 
rather than Pestalozzi, who afterward transformed it so 
much more successfully.

PESTALOZZI AND EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 
Tue happiest educational results of Rousseau came 
through Pestalozzi. Rousseau had shattered the eight- 
eenth-century temple of despotism, privilege, and hypoc- 
risy, but it remained for Pestalozzi to erect a more 
enduring structure out of the ruins. It was Pestalozzi 
that developed the negative and inconsistent naturalism 
of the Emile into a positive attempt to reform corrupt 
society by proper education and a new method of teach- 
ing. , 
The Earlier Life of Pestalozzi 
But to understand the significance of the experiments, 
writings, and principles of this widely beloved reformer, 
one must make a brief study of his life and surroundings. 
Johann Heinrich Pesialozzi was born at Ziirich in 1746. 
“Through the death ot his father, he was brought up from 
early childhood almost altogether by his: mother. She 
was a woman of great unselfishness and genuine piety, 
and her training had a lasting influence upon his educa- 
tional ideals. From this experience in great measure 
must have come his later ideas that the home, as a center 
122
-P-A-G-E-133
PESTALOZZI, EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 123 
of love and codperation, should be a model for the school, 
and that education should include a training of the heart 
and hand, as well as of the head, if the race were to be 
regenerated. Mothers he certainly held to be the ideal 
teachers, and to them he ever directed his counsel and 
exhortations. Yet to the maternal guidance must also 
be ascribed his extraordinary sensibility, imaginative- 
ness, and unpracticality. 
Another strong influence upon his life was that of his. 
grandfather, pastor in a neighboring village. Through 
visits with him to the poor, sick, and distressed of the 
parish, young Pestalozzi became acquainted with the 
degradation and suffering of the peasants and resolved 
to relieve and. elevate them. Naturally he first turned , 
to the ministry as being the best way to accomplish this. 
But he broke down in his trial sermon, and gave up the 
hope of entering this profession. He then turned to the 
study of law, with the idea of defending the rights of his 
people. In this, too, he was destined to be balked; 
strangely enough, through the influence of Rousseau. 
In common with several other students of the University 
of Ziirich, he was greatly impressed by the Social Con- 
tract and the Emile, which. had recently appeared, and, 
becoming involved with the rest in.a radical criticism of 
the government, he saw his dreams of public office and 
useful legislation disappear in thin air. 
Pestalozzi, accordingly, abandoned his legal career.

Then, in 1769, in the hope of demonstrating to the peas- 
ants the value of improved methods of agriculture, he 
took up, after a year of training, a parcel of waste land 
at Birr: This he called by the name of Neuhof (‘new 
farm’). Within five years the experiment proved a 
lamentable failure, but even before the final crash Pesta- 
lozzi had come to feel that his philanthropy had been ab- 
sorbed by a material ambition. A son had meantime 
been born to him, whom he had undertaken to rear upon 
the basis of the Emile, and the results, recorded in a 
Father’s Journal, suggested new ideas and educational 
principles for the regeneration of the masses. He held 
that education did not consist merely in books and 
knowledge, and that the children of the poor could, by 
proper training, be taught to earn their living and at the 
same time develop their intelligence and moral nature.

Pestalozzi the opportunity he craved to experiment with 
philanthropic education. (Power the end of 1774 he 
took into his home some tWenty of the most needy chil- 
dren he could find. These he fed, clothed, and treated 
as his own. He gave the boys practical instruction in 
farming and gardening on small tracts, and had the girls

trained in domestic duties and needlework. In bad 
weather both sexes gave their time to spinning and 
weavingcotton. They were also trained in the rudiments, 
but were practiced in conversing and in memorizing the 
Bible before learning to read and write. The scholastic 
‘instruction was given very largely while they were work; 
ing, and, although Pestalozzi had not as yet learned to 
make any direct connection between the occupational 
and the formal elements, this first attempt at an indus- 
trial education made it evident that the two could 
be combined. Within a few months there was a striking 
improvement in the physique, minds, and morals of the 
children, as well as in the use of their hands. But Pesta- 
lozzi was so enthusiastic over the success of his experi- 
. Ment that he greatly increased the number of children, 
and by 1780 was reduced to bankruptcy. 
Nevertheless, his wider purpose of social reform by 
means of. education was not allowed to languish alto- 
gether, fora friend shortly persuaded him to publish his 
views. The Evening Hour,of a Hermit2 a collection of 
one hundred and eighty aphorisms, was his first produc- 
tion. This work contained, as von Raumer puts -it, 
“the fruit of Pestalozzi’s past years and at the same time

and key to his action in pedagogy,” but it could be under- 
stood by few of the people and received little attention. 
Pestalozzi was, therefore, advised to put his thought into 
more popular form, and in 1782 he wrote his well-known 
story of Leonard and Gertrude. ‘This work, with the sub- 
sequent additions,? gives an account of the degraded 
social conditions in the Swiss village of ‘Bonnal’ and the 
changes wrought in them by one simple peasant woman. 
‘Gertrude’ reforms her drunkard husband, educates her 
children, and causes the whole community to feel her 
influence and adopt her methods. When finally a wise 
schoolmaster comes. to the village, he learns from Ger- 
trude the proper conduct of the school and begs for her 
continued codperation. Then the government becomes 
interested, studies the improvements that have taken 
place, and concludes that the whole country can be re-

* To elucidate more fully the teachings of this story, the following year 
Pestalozzi wrote his Christopher and Eliza, and to show how it could be 
used as a manual of popular education, he later produced The Instruction 
of Children in the Home, and Figures to my A B C Book (afterward called 
Fables), but the public, wishing only to be amused, would not read them, 
and Pestalozzi was driven by popular taste to add other parts to the Leon- 
ard and Gertrude in 1783, 1785, and 1787. A translation of the original 
first volume, with excerpts from the later parts concerning the village 
school, is given in Barnard, American Journal of Education, Vol. VU, 
Pp. 525-648. An admirable condensation of the whole work has been 
made by Eva Channing (Boston, 1892).

formed in no better way than by imitating Bonnal. 
The Leonard and Gertrude appealed especially to the ro- 
manticism of the period, and constituted Pestalozzi’s one 
popular success in literature. It was, however, taken 
simply as an interesting story, and the author’s sugges- 
tions for social, political, and educational reform were 
generally passed over.! 
His School at Stanz and the Observational Methods 
During the last decade of his life at Neuhof, Pestalozzi 
was too busy warding off poverty and starvation to write 
or develop his principles. But in 1798 a turn in political 
forttines gave him another opportunity to test his theories 
by actual practice. In that year Switzerland came under . & . : s . 
the control of the French revolutionists, and the inde- 
pendent cantons were united in a Helvetic Republic 
under a ‘directorate’ like that in France. As this move- 
ment promised reform, Pestalozzi enthusiastically sup- 
ported it. He was in turn offered patronage by the new 
government, but he asked only for a school in which he 
might carry out his principles. While the authorities 
. were settling upon a site near his home, an unexpected 
occurrence brought him instead to the village of Stanz. 
The Catholic community in this place had refused to

~ yield to what they considered a foreign and atheistic 
invasion, and most of the able-bodied adults had been 
slaughtered. That left the government with a throng 
of friendless children for whom they felt bound to pro- 
vide. Pestalozzi, being asked to take charge of them, 
started an orphan home and school in the Ursuline con- 
vent at Stanz. Here he soon gained the confidence and 
love of the children, and produced a most noticeable 
improvement in them physically, morally, and intel- 
lectually. 
‘Through He declined all assistants, books, and materials, as he 
Sere felt that none of the conventional methods could be of 
ee service in his work, and he sought to instruct the children

merity and. statements and words. * Religion and morals, for ex- 
ample, were never taught by precepts, but through in- 
: stances that arose in their own lives he showed them the 
value of self-control, charity, sympathy, and gratitude. 
To a friend he declared : — 
“I strove to awaken the feeling of each virtue before talking 
about it, for I thought it unwise to talk to children on subjects 
which would compel them to speak without thoroughly under- 
standing what they were saying.”!

books. While they did not learn their natural history 
primarily from nature, they were taught to corroborate 
what they had learned by their own observation. With 
regard to this whole method Pestalozzi said : — 
“T believe that the first development of thought in the child is 
very much disturbed by a wordy system of teaching, which is not 
adapted either to his faculties or the circumstances of his life. 
According to my experience, success depends upon whether what 
is taught to children commends itself to them as true through being 
closely connected with their own observation. As a general rule, 
I attached little importance to the study of words, even when ex- 
planations of the ideas they represented were given.” + 
In connection with his observational method, Pesta- 
lozzi at this time began his attempts to reduce all obser- 
vation to its lowest terms.? It was while at Stanz, for i 
example, that he first adopted his well-known plan of 
teaching children.to read by means of exercises known 
as ‘syllabaries.’ These joined the five vowels in succes- 
sion to the different consonants, — ‘ab, eb, ib, ob, ub,’ 
and so on through all the consonants. From the pho- 
netic nature of German spelling, he was able to make the 
exercises very simple, and intended thus to furnish a 
necessary practice in basal syllables. In a similar way 
he hoped to simplify all education to such an extent that

schools would eventually become unnecessary, and that 
each mother would be able to teach her children and 
continue her own education at the same time. More- 
over, while not altogether successful in his efforts at a 
correlation, Pestalozzi, more than at Neuhof, now 
“sought to combine study with manual labor, the school 
with the workshop,” for, said he:—~ 
“JT am more than ever convinced that as soon as we have edu- 
cational establishments combined with workshops, and conducted 
on a truly psychological basis, a generation will necessarily be 
formed which will show us by experience that our present studies 
do not require one tenth of the time or trouble we now give to them.” 
The ‘Institute’ at Burgdorf and the Psychologizing of 
Education 
From these methods and principles that Pestalozzi 
started at Stanz eventually developed all his educational 
contributions. But before the close of a year the con- 
vent that had served as such a fruitful experiment station 
was required by the French soldiers for a hospital. As 
soon as he recovered from the terrific physical strain 
under which he had labored, Pestalozzi was forced to seek 
another place in which to continue his educational work. 
But, according to the usual standards for securing a 
position to teach, “he had everything against him; 
thick, indistinct speech, bad writing, ignorance of draw- 
ing, scorn of grammatical learning. He had studied
-P-A-G-E-141
PESTALOZZI, EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 131 
various branches of natural history, but without any 
particular attention either to classification or terminology. 
He was conversant with the ordinary numerical opera- 
tions, but he would have had difficulty to get through a 
really long sum in multiplication or division, and had 
probably never tried to work out a problem in geometry.”! 
And in spite of his understanding of ‘the mind of man 
and the laws of its development, human affections, and 
the art of arousing and ennobling them,”! he would 
probably have been unable to obtain a school, had it not 
been for certain influential friends in the town of Burg- 
dorf. They secured a position for him, first in the school 
for the tenants and poorer people, and later in the ele- 
mentary school of the citizens. 
In Burgdorf, Pestalozzi “followed without any plan 
the empirical method interrupted at Stanz,” and “sought 
by every means to bring the elements of reading and arith- 
metic to the greatest simplicity, and by grouping them 
psychologically, enable the child to pass easily and surely 
from the first step to the second, and from the second to 
the third, and so on.”? He further worked out and 
graduated his ‘syllabaries,’ and invented the idea of large 
movable letters for teaching the children to read. Lan- 
guage exercises were given his pupils by means of exam- 
ining the number, form, position, and color of the designs,

pressing their observations in longer and longer sentences, 
which they repeatéd after him. For arithmetic he de- 
vised boards divided into squares upon which were placed 
dots or lines concretely representing each unit up to one 
hundred. By means of this ‘table of units’ the pupil 
obtained a clear idea of the meaning of the digits and the 
process of addition, and practiced his knowledge further 
by counting his fingers, beans, pebbles, and other objects. 
Pestalozzi further explained that “after the child has 
come to a full understanding of the combinations of units 
up to ten, and has learned to express himself with ease, 
the objects are again presented, but the questions -are 
changed : ‘If we have two objects, how many times one 
object ?’? The child looks, counts, and answers correctly.”” 
In that way the pupils learned to multiply, and the mean- 
ing of division and subtraction was similarly acquired. 
The children were also taught the elements of geometry 
by drawing angles, lines, and curves. Likewise. the de- 
velopment of teaching history, geography, an: 
history by this method of observation must

As a result of these experiments, says Pestalozzi, and thus 
“there unfolded itself gradually in my mind the idea of es Cot . 
the possibility of an A B C of observation,! to which I observation,’ 
now attach great importance, and with the working out ¢a(ed wish 
of which the whole scheme of a general method of in- Bize educa. 
struction in all its scope appeared, though still obscure, 
before my eyes.” #{ And the underlying principle of his 
system he shortly formulated most tersely in the state- 
ment, “I wish to psychologize education.”* By this, 
he showed, is meant the harmonizing of instruction with | 
the laws of intellectual development, together with te YK i 
simplification of the elements of knowledge and their 
reduction to a series of exercises so scientifically graded 
that even the lowest classes can obtain the proper phys- 
ical, mental, and moral development. And sense per- 
ception or observation, he holds, when connected with 
language for expressing the different impressions, is, 
therefore, the foundation of education. : 
Despite a want of system and errors in carrying Out Pestalozzi’s 
his method, Pestalozzi seems to have produced remark- uatieate at Burgdorf 
able results from the start. At the first annual exam- Fensely 
ination the Burgdorf School Commission wrote him that svg —

was made by him when asked for a written statement of his system by the 
‘Friends of Education,’ a society that was striving to propagate his views.

“the surprising progress of your little scholars of various 
capacities shows plainly that every one is good for some- 
thing, if the teacher knows how to get at his abilities and 
develop them according to the laws of psychology.” And 
the reformer soon met with even greater success in a 
school of his own. In January, 1801, the government 
granted him the free use of the ‘castle,’ or town hall, of 
Burgdorf and a small subsidy for his ‘institute,’ Pupils 
poured in; a number of progressive teachers, including 
Kriisi, Tobler, Buss, and Niederer,! came ‘to assist him ; 
many persons of prominence visited the school and made 
most favorable reports upon its methods; and during 
the following three years and a half the Pestalozzian 
views on education were systematically developed and 
applied. 
How Gertrude Teaches Her Children and Other 
Works 
Pestalozzi was also able at Burgdorf to undertake a de- 
tailed statement of his method by the publication in Octo- 
1 Hermann Kriisi, a young schoolmaster of Gais, had, during a famine in 
Appenzell, brought a troop of starving children to Burgdorf at the invita- 
tion of Fischer, a friend of Pestalozzi. Fischer died shortly afterward, 
and Kriisi joined Pestalozzi’s venture. Through Kriisi, the services of 
Tobler, “a private tutor whose youth had been much neglected,” and of 
Buss, “a bookbinder, who devoted his leisure to singing and drawing,” 
were also secured for the institute. Niederer was a clergyman and 
philosopher, who gave up his parochial duties to work with Pestalozzi.

work does not mention Gertrude, but consists of fifteen 
letters to his friend, Gessner. The first two letters con- 
tain biographical details, especially concerning the meet- 
ing with his assistant teachers. Then follows an account 
of his general principles; of the specific teaching of lan- 
guage, drawing, writing, measuring, and number by 
means of observation; of the elementary books that he 
contemplates writing, — the A B C of Observation and 
the Book for Mothers ;? of the reform in elementary edu- 
cation and of the need of judgment as well as knowledge; 
and of moral and religious development. Like all of 
Pestalozzi’s works, How Gertrude Teaches Her Children 
is quite lacking in both plan and proportion, and is filled 
with repetitions and digressions. It contains, however, 
the foundation of his system and of most modern reform 
in elementary education, and has to be studied to reveal 
its values. It has already been quoted several times

his assistants likewise produced a variety of books applying the new 
method to various school subjects. To explain

ful study of this unsystematic work, may serve to give 
an idea of Pestalozzi’s educational creed. He had come 
to believe:   
“yt, Observation is the foundation of instruction. 
“2, Language must be connected with observation. 
“3. The time for learning is not the time for judgment and 
criticism. . . 
‘4. In each branch, instruction must begin with the simplest 
elements, and proceed gradually by following the child’s develop- 
ment; that is, by a series of steps which are psychologically 
connected. 
“5. A pause must be made at each stage of th 
sufficiently long for the child to get the new matte: 
into his grasp and under his control. 
“6, Teaching must follow the path of development, and not 
that of dogmatic exposition. 
“7, The individuality of the pupil must be sacred fo! 
teacher. 
“8, The chief aim of elementary instruction is not * 
the child with knowledge and talents, but to develop anc 
the powers of his mind. 
“9. To knowledge must be joined power; to what i:

everything. in 1804 the cantonal government demanded 
back the ‘castle,’ although it turned over to Pestalozzi 
an old. convent at Miinchenbuchsee. For a few months 
the reformer made a fruitless attempt to codperate in his 
new location with Emanuel von Fellenberg (1771-1844), 
who had founded in the neighboring Hofwyl a prosper- 
ous industrial school upon Pestalozzian principles. This 
school of Fellenberg has played so important a part in 
American educational history as to deserve more extended 
consideration than can be given here. The founder 
had, from his early youth, felt a great sympathy for 
the poor and unfortunate, and when, while holding an 
important government office, he came to despair of 
ever accomplishing anything by legislation, he turned 
his attention directly to practical educational reform. 
He purchased an estate at Hofwyl} and started in- 
dustrial training on the basis of Pestalozzi’s experiences, 
with which he had long been acquainted. Owing to his 
ability as an organizer and administrator, his school was 
conducted with ever increasing success from 1804 un- 
til his death. He was careful to introduce the various 
features of his work gradually. Believing that agricul- 
ture, as the chief industry of the country, would afford 
tho-most tflective physical and intellectual training, he

laid out a farm of some six hundred acres, and, with the 
addition of the necessary workshops, undertook to train 
farm laborers, cartmakers, blacksmiths, carpenters, 
locksmiths, shoemakers, and tailors. This ‘Agricultural 
Institute’ furnished a practical training for the poor and 
enabled them to support themselves by their labor while 
being educated. Through the same institution he also 
undertook to train rural school-teachers. But his work 
did not stop there. He felt that the wealthy should 
understand and be more in sympathy with the laboring ~ 
classes, and learn how to direct their work intelligently. 
Accordingly, he established on the estate a ‘Literary 
Institute,’ with the usual classical course for the boys 
of the upper classes. Both sets of boys had to culti- 
vate gardens and work on the farm, and in many other 
ways come into touch and mutual understanding. 
The ‘Institute’ at Yverdun and the Culmination of 
the Pestalozzian Methods 
When, however, despite their similarity of purpose, a 
marked difference of temperaments made a union of the 
work of Pestalozzi and Fellenberg impossible, Pestalozzi 
transferred his school to Yverdun in 1805, and was soon 
followed by most of his assistants. The ‘institute’ here 
sprang into fame almost immediately, and increased in 
numbers and prosperity for several years. Children 
were sent to Yverdun from great distances, and teachers
-P-A-G-E-149
PESTALOZZI, EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 139 
thronged here to learn and apply the new principles at 
home. Visitors and sightseers came from all parts of 
Europe and America. Pestalozzi was decorated by the 
Czar of Russia, and presented with distinctions from 
other monarchs. A flourishing girls’ school grew up 
near the institute under the direction of associates, and 
for a short time Pestalozzi himself conducted a school 
for orphans in the neighborhood, while Conrad Naef of 
Ziirich came to Yverdun and founded a celebrated in- 
stitution for the deaf and dumb upon the Pestalozzian 
principles. 
The work of the institute at Yverdun was a continua- 
tion and culmination of that started at Stanz and Burg- 
dorf. It wasa great center of educational experimenta- 
tion, and nearly every advanced method characteristic of 3 
present elementary education was first undertaken there. 
The keynote in teaching all subjects was observation 
connected with language. ‘The children were taught to 
observe correctly and form the right idea of the relations 
of things, and so to have no difficulty in expressing clearly 
what they thoroughly understood. The simplification 
introduced through the ‘syllabaries’ and ‘table of units’ 
was further elaborated. A ‘table of fractions’ was also 
devised for teaching that subject concretely. . It con- 
sisted of a series of squares, which could be divided in- 
definitely and in different ways. Some of the squares 
were whole, while others were divided horizontally into Here he

two, three, or even ten equal parts. The pupil thus 
learned by observation to count the parts of units and 
form them into integers. There was further developed 
a ‘table of fractions of fractions,’ or compound fractions," 
in which the squares were divided, not only horizon- 
tally, but vertically, so that the method of reducing two 
fractions to the same denominator might be self-evident. 
It was in this number work that the Pestalozzians were 
most radical’) By means of various devices Kriisi, and 
afterward Schmid? even more, attained great clearness, 
accuracy, and rapidity in arithmetic. The work was 
often done aloud without paper, and many of the students 
became most apt in calculation. 
Similarly, in order to draw and write, the pupil was first 
taught the simple elements of form. The consecutive 
exercises for building up form from its elements, however, 
Pestalozzi was not happy in determining, but Buss success- 
fully worked out an ‘alphabet of form.’ Objects, such as 
sticks or pencils, were placed in differe-* T---t#-n= --4

models, and were encouraged to.design symmetrical and 
graceful figures. This also paved the way for writing, 
for, said Pestalozzi, “In endeavoring to teach writing, 
I found I must begin by teaching drawing.” The chil- 
dren wrote on their slates, beginning with the easiest 
letters and gradually forming words from them, but soon 
learned to write on paper with a pen. Writing was, 
however, taught in connection with reading, although 
begun somewhat later than that study. Constructive 
geometry was also learned through drawing. Much 
use was made of squares, which were divided into smaller 
squares or rectangles, and thus sense impression prepara- 
tory to geometry was furnished. The pupils were taught 
to distinguish, first vertical, horizontal, oblique, and par- 
allel lines; then they learned right, acute, and obtuse 
angles, different kinds of triangles, quadrilaterals, and 
other figures; and finally discovered at how many points 
a certain number of straight lines may be made to cut 
one another, and how many angles, triangles, and quad- 
rilaterals can be formed. To make the matter more 
concrete the figures were often cut out of cardboard or 
made into models. Thus the pupils were led up to the- 
oretical geometry, which was made more valuable and 
interesting by their working out the demonstrations for 
themselves, instead of learning them from a book. 
In nature study, geography, and history the concrete 
observational work was similarly continued. Trees, natural sci-

flowers, and birds were viewed, drawn, and discussed. 
The pupils began in geography by acquiring the points 
of the compass and relative positions, and from this 
knowledge observed and described some familiar place. 
The valley of the Buron near at hand was observed in 
detail and modeled upon long tables in clay brought 
from its sides. Then the pupils were shown the map 
for the first time and easily grasped the meaning of its 
symbols. Pestalozzi himself did not altogether under- 
stand the real purpose of geography, regarding it rather 
as a means for cultivating language, but he inspired some 
of his assistants, like Tobler and Ritter, with a great love 
for the subject and a desire to work it out psychologically. 
Nor was Pestalozzi sufficiently acquainted with music 
to apply his method to it. This was, however, done by 
his friend, Nageli, a Swiss composer of note, who reduced 
’ it to its simplest elements and then combined and devel- 
oped these progressively into more complex and con- 
nected wholes. Pupils were thus led to discover pleasing 
combinations and develop musical inventiveness. In 
religious and moral training, as at Stanz, Pestalozzi 
sought by concrete examples to quicken the germ of 
conscience into action and develop it by successive steps. 
The love of God he believed could be taught better 
through the child’s love for his mother ! and other human

nificance of ‘obedience, duty, and unselfishness through 
being required to wait before having his desires fulfilled, 
and so realizing that his own is not the only will or pleas- 
ure in the world. / 
During this period, also, many books upon the applica- 
tions of the new methods were issued both by Pestalozzi 
and his assistants. The most famous was probably 
Schmid’s Exercises on Numbers and Forms. Niederer also 
undertook to put the doctrines of Pestalozzi into philo- 
sophic form, and published several treatises and pam- 
phlets. A Weekly Journal was likewise issued for several 
years, and a complete edition of Pestalozzi’s works was 
brought out. . : 
With all these achievements, however, the institute 
of Yverdun was slowly dying. Pestalozzi was never a 
practical administrator, and he was now an old man. 
The death of his wife deprived him of most of the mental 
balance that remained to him. He came to depend al- 
most entirely upon his assistant, Schmid, who was most 
despotic and drove away several of the best teachers 
from the institute. Disputes and lawsuits became 
common, and the finances of the institution went from 
bad to. worse. The constant interruptions of visitors 
also demoralized the school. Finally, in 1825, after an 
existence of ascoreof years and with areputation through- 
out the civilized world, the institute was closed. Pesta- Many books

Pestalozzi’s Educational Aim 
After this account of Pestalozzi’s personality, experi- 
ments, and writings, we are ready to discuss his aim in 
education and to understand in what sensé his prin- Seiten eee 
ciples were a continuation of f Rousseaw’s *naturalism.’ 
in his Arst - writing, The Evening Hour of a Hermit, he 
held that “all the beneficent powers of r of man are due to 
neither art nor or chance, | but to ature,” ure,” and that eduéa- 
tion. “should follow. “the course laid down by nature.” 
“so in all his works he he constantly y returns to the whalogy 
of the child’s development with that of the natural growth en ne 
of the plant or animal. For or example, he he writes : 
“Sound education stands before me symbolized by a tree planted 
near fertilizing waters. A little seed, which contains the design of 
the tree, its form and proportions, is placed in the soil. See how 
it germinates and expands into trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, 
and fruit. The whole tree is an uninterrupted chain of organic 
parts, the plan of which existed in its seed and root. Man is simi- 
lar to the tree. In the new-born child are hidden those faculties 
which are to unfold during life. The individual and separate organs 
of his being form themselves gradually into unison, and build up 
humanity in the image of God.” 
2A memorial inscription, which now covers the rear of the school- 
house, after relating his labors and achievements, closes with these 
fittirig words: ‘‘ Man, Christian, citizen. Everything for others, noth- 
ing for self. Blessings on his name.”
-P-A-G-E-155
PESTALOZZI, EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 145 
Consequently, P-stalozzi defines education as “the nat- 
ural, progressive, and harmonious development of all the 
powers and capacities of the human being,” and insists 
that “the knowledge to which the child is to be led by 
instruction must, therefore, be ¢ subjected to a certain 
ee Gat ote ccession, the beginning of which must be PEeetie pone 
       
  to this education in harmony with nature, Pesta- 
lozzi saw that the traditional practices of the times gave 
the pupil a mere ability to read words, a memory kr knowl- 
edge of of mathematics, and a “superficial “culture > through 
the classics that was purely’ formal and ‘in 
real development. “Our unpsychologica! 
declares, ® are essentially only artificial stifling machines 
for destroying all the results of the power and experience 
that nature herself brings to life.... After the children 
have enjoyed the happiness of sensuous life for five 
whole years, we make all nature around them vanish 
before their eyes; tyrannically stop the delightful course 
of their unrestrained freedom; pen them up like sheep, 
whole flocks. huddled together in stinking rooms; piti- 
lessly chain them for hours, days, weeks, months, years, 
to the contemplation of unnatural and unattractive 
letters, and, contrasted with their former condition, to a 
maddening course of life.” . 
.. This need for gradually developing the. powers of the 2 L

child in keeping with nature and the complete absence of 
it in the schools of the period had been pointed out by 
Rousseau, but in a purely destructive way. He talked 
blindly in his ‘naturalism’ about an abandonment of all 
society and civilization and a return to nature, but he 
failed to make his educational doctrine concrete and 
explicit and to apply it to the school. Pestalozzi further 
modified and extended the Rousselian doctrine by recom- 
mending its application to all children, whatever their 
circumstances and abilities. Where Rousseau evidently 
had only the young aristocrat in ind in the eaiieation 
of Emi Emile, Pestalozzi held that t poverty could be ould be relieved 
and sot society ref ref ormed : ‘only through ridding each a ach and every 
one of his degradation by means of mental “and moral 
development. Accordingly, he was the stanch advocate 
of universal education, as shown by the protest implied 
in the following simile : — 
    “As far as I am acquainted with popular instruction, it appears 
to me like a large house, whose uppermost story shines in splendor 
of highly finished art, but is occupied by only afew. In the middle 
story is a great crowd, but the stairs by which the upper one may 
be reached in an approved and respectable manner are wanting ; 
if the attempt be made in a less regular way, the leg or arm used 
as a means of progress may be broken. In the lowest story is an 
immense throng of people, who have precisely the same right to 
enjoy the light of the sun as those in the upper one; but they are 
left in utter darkness and not even allowed to gaze at the mag- 
nificence above.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
PESTALOZZI, EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 147 
His Genefal Method and Its Applications 
Pestalozzi’s underlying principle for producing this 
natural development of the powers of all and so for re- 
forming social conditions was to train his pupils in ‘ob- 
servation’! He felt that clear ideas could be formed 
only through careful sense perceptions, and was thor- 
oughly opposed to the mechanical memorizing with little 
understanding that was current in the schools of the day. 
In all studies, therefore, he strove to direct the sensesof the 
pupils to outer objects and to arouse their consciousness 
by the impressions thus produced. While such ‘object 
lessons’ did not exist in the traditionalized schools, 
Pestalozzi insisted that the material for them is all about 
the children, and that it can best be obtained in the home 
and school and in the ordinary occupations, surroundings, 
and experiences of life. His method in general seems to 
have been to analyze each subject into i its Simplest ele- i anarcanini i nO ie ener a ke 
ments and to develop it by. ‘graded e exer ses $ based as 
far as possible upon the study | of 0 ‘objects. rather than 
words. Yet Pestalozai felt that “experiences must “be 
clearly expressed in words, or otherwise there arises the 
same danger that characterizes the dominant word 
teaching, — that of attributing entirely erroneous ideas 
to words.” Accordingly, as shown in the summary of 
How Gertrude Teaches Her Children, in all instruction 
he would connect language 1 with observation.

by means. of f analysis, observation, and expression to the 
ious 5 studies constituted ‘the most far-reaching work 
  “of ‘Pestalozzi. ‘The special applications of this general 
method that were worked out by hin and his followers 
in the most common subjects of the curriculum have been 
described in detail in the account of his work at Stanz, 
Burgdorf, and Yverdun. Language was taught, not by 
abstract rules, but by conversation concerning objects. 
As thinking is thus made to precede language, speaking 
is held to precede grammar, reading, spelling, and com- 
position. The language training began with single 
elements or sounds, learned through the ‘syllabaries’ ; 
from these words were built up; and. from words, sen- 
tences. As sounds were the elements in language, 
numbers were the basis of arithmetic. Here again ob- 
servation was used, and numbers and their relations were 
taught the pupil through objects. For this purpose the 
various tables of units, fractions, and compound fractions 
were devised. Similarly, from the rudiments of form were 
taught drawing, writing, and constructive and theoret- 
ical geometry. For the study of geography, nature, 
and history, elements were found in the locality that 
could be combined until the whole world and all the 
relations of man were worked out. Music was re- 
duced to its simplest elements and progressive’- 7~ 
veloped, and moral and religious training was
-P-A-G-E-159
PESTALOZZI, EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 2} , 
through the ordinary concrete relations and experiences 
of life. 
The discipline connected with Pestalozzi’s method 
was naturally mild. Throughout his work he main- 
tained that the school should be as nearly like the 
home as possible, and that the chief incentives to right 
are not fear, but kindness and love. In such a sym- 
pathetic atmosphere, where the pupils were constantly 
busied with interesting activities, and all their physical, 
intellectual, and moral needs were regarded, it is not 
remarkable that severe punishment was seldom required. 
On this point Pestalozzi most sensibly remarks : — 
“T do not venture to assert that corporal punishment is inad- 
missible, but I do object to its application when the teacher or 
the method is at fault and not the children.” 
The Permanent Influence of His Principles 
It is easy to exaggerate the achievements of this 
almost sainted reformer of Switzerland. Pestalozzi’s 
doctrines were neither very original nor well carried 
out. His merit lay in making concrete and positive 
the abstract and general principles of Rousseau, and in 
applying them to the schools. Even in this he some- 
what failed in practicality and consistency. He was 
often unable to apply his own method; he grasped 
principles, but not details. While he stated his views 
in general most convincingly, we have seen that much His disci-

        and was often 
repetitious, 
inaccurate, 
and lacking 
in compre- 
hensiveness. 150 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
had to be worked out by his assistants and followers. 
This he realized when he declared : — 
“T cannot say that it is I who have created what you see before 
you now. Niederer, Kriisi, and Schmid would laugh if I called 
myself their master. I am good neither at figures nor writing ; 
I know nothing about grammar, mathematics, or any other science ; 
the most ignorant of our pupils knows more of these things than I 
do. Iam but the initiative of the institute and depend upon others 
to catry out my views.” 
Often he badly violated his own principles. Although 
strongly opposed to all verbal and memoriter teaching, 
in language work he made the mistake of shaping the 
sentences for his pupils and having them repeat after 
him; he insisted upon teaching reading and spelling by 
pronouncing every possible variety of syllable; and in 
geography, history, and nature study he required the 
pupils to commit mere lists of important places, facts, 
or objects arranged in alphabetic order.

experiments and his writings, Pestalozzi

-P-A-G-E-161
The inconsistency and incompleteness of Pestalozzi’s 
work, however, is of small import when compared with 
its influence upon society and education. The value of PESTALOZZI, EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 15! 
> 
his achievements rests, not in their adequacy or finality, & { 
but in the fact that they were the germ of all modern 
pedagogy and reform. In the eighteenth century caste 
tuled through wealth and education, while the masses, 
| who supported the owners of the land in idleness and 
‘luxury, were sunk in ignorance, poverty, and vice. 
The schools for the common people were exceedingly 
few, the content of education was largely limited by 
ecclesiastical authority, and the methods were tra- 
ditional and verbal. Brutal discipline and corporal 
punishment accompanied the memoriter methods. The 
teachers generally had received little training, and were 
selected at random. Often it was only the old soldier, 
widow, servant, or workman who gathered the children 
for an hour or two on Sundays to learn the rudiments. 
( Ordinarily the pay was wretched, no lodgings were 
| provided for the teacher, and he had often to add domes- 
"tic service to his duties, in order to secure food and 
clothing. 
Tn the midst of such conditions appeared this Swiss 
' reformer and most famous of modern educators, who 
} never ceased to work for the reformation of society 
through education. He saw what education might do 
to purify social conditions and to elevate the people, He held edu- 
cation to be 
a panacea, 
for all social 
ills.

and attempted to apply it. As Voltaire, Rousseat 
others had held that the panacea for the corrupt 
was rationalism, atheism, deism, socialism, anarcl 
individualism, Pestalozzi found his remedy in educ

ness, and degradation of the existing society, but he

social conditions and to elevate the people, ‘and he | 
burned to apply it universally and to develop methods — 
in keeping with nature. He would make Rousseau’s 
naturalism specific and extend it to all. 
Hence through Pestalozzi has gradually been 
strengthened the demand for universal popular educa- 
tion. Through his example at Neuhof and Stanz, and 
still more through the model institutions of his prac- 
tical disciple, Fellenberg, at Hofwyl, various types of 
industrial education have come to supplement the 
academic courses, and extend the work of the school to 
a larger number of pupils. The poor, the defective, and 
the degraded have, through his efforts, been redeemed and 
given an opportunity in life, and many children have been 
kept in school that, would inevitably have fallen by the 
wayside. Public schools, special industrial schools, 
orphanages, institutions for the deaf and blind, reforma- 
tories, and even prisons have thus yielded rich harvests 
because of his first sowing. Likewise, the tendency of
-P-A-G-E-163
ee PESTALOZZI, EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 153 
modern society to care for the education of the unfor- 
tunate through industrial training has sprung from the 
philanthropic spirit of Pestalozzi and his endeavors to 
furnish educational opportunities for all. : 
The efforts of Pestalozzi to evolve a natural method Bis natural 
of teaching were likewise fruitful. Through his ex- reo ie 
periments, educational theory has come, in place of aera 
se sys and caused. formal principles and traditional processes, to work out ecusr | 
carefully and patiently the development of the child approach the 
mind and to embody the results in practice. And, above of the home. 
all, Pestalozzi’s work has made clear the new spirit in the 
school by which it has approached the atmosphere of 
the home. He found the proper relation of pupil and 
teacher to exist in sympathy and friendship, or, as he 
states it, in ‘love.’ This attitude constituted the 
greatest contrast to that of the brutal schools of the 
times and introduced a new conception into education. 
What, then, if Pestalozzi be right in saying, “My 1 his system

experiments nor even the results, but the fact that he 
believed in finding his theory through experiment, and

practice was most fixed, it was least effective; and

was suffused with his principles, and his method has 
become the basis of all subsequent reform. Th: “7

The Spread of Pestalozzian Schools and Methods

The principles of Pestalozzi and institution:

throughout Europe. Strange to-say, aS a result Ot 
their familiarity with his weaknesses and the ~---*r"

PESTALOZZI, EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 155 
Kriisi, after leaving the institute at Yverdun, also 
founded a number of schools and carried Pestalozzian- 
ism into various parts of Switzerland. He finally, in 
1833, became the director of a teachers’ seminary at his 
native village of Gais. Near this institution he founded 
two Pestalozzian schools under the management of his 
daughter, and during the last decade of his life con- 
tributed largely to the Pestalozzian literature. Many 
other disciples eventually started or reorganized schools 
in various parts of Switzerland upon the principles of 
Pestalozzi, and, before the middle of the nineteenth 
century, educational conditions had greatly changed in 
Switzerland. Pestalozzi’s ‘observation’ methods were 
in general use, every canton had its ‘farm school,’ and 
industrial training had been introduced into most of the 
normal schools. 
But the reforms never secured the hold upon the coun- 
try of their origin that they did in Germany. The 
innovations were most remarkable in Prussia, and the 
system there has, in consequence, often been referred 
to as the ‘Prussian-Pestalozzian.’ By the beginning of 
the nineteenth century Pestalozzianism began to find 
its way there. In 1801 the appeal of Pestalozzi for a 
public subscription in behalf of his project at Burgdorf 
was warmly supported. The next year the publication 
by Herbart of Pestalozzi’s A BC of Observation attracted 
much attention. A representative was sent from Pru 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
156 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
Prussia to Burgdorf to report upon the new system in 
1803. Meanwhile the Pestalozzian missionaries were 
fast converting the land. Plamann, who had visited 
Burgdorf, established in 1805, after several other edu- 
cational enterprises, a Pestalozzian school in Berlin,’ 
and published several books applying the new methods 
to language, geography, and natural history. The same 
year Griiner opened a similar school at Frankfurt, 
which was later the means of starting Froebel upon an 
educational career. Zeller was coaxed away from Wiir- 
temberg, and in the seminary at Koénigsberg lectured 
to large audiences, and organized a Pestalozzie~ «-hon- 
age there. A similar institution for educatin 
was opened at Potsdam by von Tiirck. In 
of Pestalozzi’s pupils, Nicolovius and Siivern, ' 
directors of public instruction in Prussia,

educators zealously advanced the cause. Th 
impulse, however, was given the movement b : 
losopher, Fichte. In the course of his Addr: : 
German Nation, 1807-1808, he described thi 
Pestalozai and declared :— 
“To the course of instruction which has been invent: * } 
brought forward by Heinrich Pestalozzi, and which is novi

Berlin. See p. 199.

successfully carried out under his direction, must we look for our 
regeneration.” 
In this position Fichte was ardently supported by 
King Friedrich Wilhelm III, and even more by his 
noble queen, Luise, who now felt that only through 
these advanced educational principles could a restora- 
tion of the territory and prestige lost to Napoleon at 
> Jena be effected. Throughout his reign the king took 
the keenest interest in the Pestalozzian schools, and the 
queen frequently went to visit the institutions of 
Zeller. 
A similar spirit was animating the other states of 
Germany. As early as 1803, Bavaria sent an educator 
named Miiller to Burgdorf to study the methods, 
and upon his return he started a school at Mainz. 
Saxony authorized Blochmann, a former pupil of Pesta- 
lozzi, to reorganize its schools upon the new basis. 
Through Denzel, Wiirtemberg introduced the new 
methods, and during the first decade of the century 
| many Pestalozzians were appointed seminary directors er 
4. and school inspectors. Denzel also organized the school 
system for the duchy of Nassau. The Princess Pauline 
of Detmold and other rulers were likewise eager to im- 
prove the education of their realms by the introduction

and issued two commendatory reports, which induced 
some thirty French pupils to go to Pestalozzi’s institute. 
Chavannes also published a treatise upon the Pesta- 
lozzian methods in 1805. Three years later the philoso- 
pher, de Biran, founded a Pestalozzian school under the 
management of a certain Barraud, whom he had sent to 
study under Pestalozzi. These efforts, however, had 
little effect upon education, and the Pestalozzian prin- 
ciples did not make much headway in France up to the 
revolution of 1830. After that time they rapidly became 
popular, especially through Victor Cousin. This famous 
professor and minister of public instruction issued in 
1835 a Report on the State of Public Instruction in Prussia, 
which showed the great merit of Pestalozzianism in the 
elementary schools of that country. The other great 
minister, Guizot, had likewise recommended the Prus- 
sian schools as the best type for the reform movement, 
and had shown himself most zealous in training teachers 
‘for their vocation after the ideals of Pestalozzi. 
Spain at first took kindly to the new methods. A 
few schools were founded on these principles, and a 
number of pupils sent to Pestalozzi through the gov- 
ernment, but a reaction soon occurred and education 
was turned over to the ecclesiastical authorities. In 
Russia the Czar showed himself interested in Pestalozzi’s 
work, a school similar to the ‘institutes’ was founded, 
and a former assistant of Pestalozzi became tutor to the Spain,

of them met with much success, and continental Europe 
in general eventually adopted the new principles in- 
directly from Germany. 
In England there was a tendency to combine Pes- 
talozzianism with the Bell-Lancaster ‘monitorial’! sys- 
tem and to adopt rather its formal methodological 
aspects than its underlying spirit. However, the Pesta- 
lozzian school of Dr. Mayo and his sister near London 
during the second quarter of the century was famous 
both for its methods and its teachers. The Mayos, 
together with a friend and admirer of Pestalozzi, named 
Greaves, and the reformer’s biographer, Biber, did much 
at this time for the cause of educational reform. 
Through their efforts, with the codperation of many 
other educators, ‘The Home and Colonial Society’ ? was 
established in 1836 largely upon Pestalozzian principles, 
and a number of training schools were founded. The 
industrial training of Pestalozzi has also found a foot- 
hold in England, and in the well-known Red Hill school 
and farm for young criminals and in other institutions it 
has produced remarkable results.

Pestalozzianism in the United States 
Pestalozzianism began to appear in the United States 
as early as the first decade of the nineteenth century. 
It was introduced, not only from the original centers in 
Switzerland, but indirectly in the form it had assumed 
in Germany, France, England, and other countries. 
The instances of its appearance were sporadic and seem 
to have been but. little connected at any time. The 
earliest presentation was that made from the treatise 
of Chavannes in 1805 by William McClure. This 
gentleman was a retired Scotch-American merchant and 
man of science, who had, upon the invitation of Na- 
poleon, gone to visit the orphanage at Paris directed by 
Joseph Neef, a former teacher at Burgdorf. Mr. 
McClure afterward spent much time at the institute in 
Yverdun, and by his writings, articles, and financial 
support did much to make the new principles known in 
the United States. In 1806 he induced Neef to come 
to America and become his “master’s apostle in the new 
world.” Neef maintained an institution at Philadelphia 
for three years and afterward founded and taught 
schools in several parts of the country. But his imper- 
fect acquaintance with English and with American 
character and his frequent migrations prevented his 
personal influence from being greatly felt, and the two 
excellent works that he published upon applications

Hofwyl, and such lecturers as the Rev. Charles Brooks 
began to suggest the new principles as a remedy for 
our educational deficiencies. The Pestalozzian methods 
were applied to arithmetic by Warren Colburn, who 
spread ‘mental arithmetic’ throughout the country, 
and in his famous First Lessons even printed the ‘table 
of units’; to geography by Arnold Guyot, a pupil of 
Ritter’s; to music by Lowell Mason, who was influenced 
by the works of Nageli; and to various other subjects 
by a number of educators. Bronson Alcott and his 
brother urged and practiced the principles of Pestalozzi 
in their schools, and David P. Page, as principal of the 
New York State Normal School, utilized the spirit and 
many of the methods of the Swiss reformer.

Annual Report (1843) of Horace Mann, and through the 
inauguration of the ‘Oswego methods’ by Dr. Edward A. 
Sheldon. Mann spoke most enthusiastically of the suc- 
cess of the Prussian-Pestalozzian system of education 
and hinted at the need of a radical reform along the 
same lines in America. The report caused a great sen- 
sation, and was bitterly combated by a group of thirty- 
one Boston schoolmasters and by conservative sentiment 
throughout the country. Nevertheless, the suggested 
reforms were largely effected, and were carried much 
further .by the successors of Mann in the secretaryship 
of the Massachusetts State Board of Education.! 
Dr. Sheldon, on the other hand, caught his Pesta- 
lozzian inspiration from Toronto, Canada, where he 
became acquainted with the Mayo methods through 
publications of the Home and Colonial Society. He 
resolved to introduce the principles of Pestalozzi into 
the Oswego schools, of which he was at that time super- 
intendent, and in 1861 sent to the Society in London 
for an experienced Pestalozzian to train his teachers in 
these methods. After a year and a half of the experi- 
ment, a committee of distinguished educators, who had 
been invited to inspect the work, pronounced the Oswego 
movement an unqualified success. Superintendent Shel- 
don had from the first admitted a few teachers from 
outside to learn the new methods, and in 1865 the 
Oswego training school was made a state institution.

Thus was established the first normal school in the 
United States, where object lessons were the chief feature, 
and where classes were conducted by model teachers 
and practice teaching afforded under the supervision of 
critic teachers. The excellent teachers graduated from 
this institution caused the Oswego methods to be widely 
known throughout the country. A large number of 
other normal schools upon the same basis sprang up 
rapidly in many states, and the Oswego methods crept 
into the training schools and the public system of numer- 
ous cities. As a consequence, during the third quarter 
of the nineteenth century, Pestalozzianism had a pre- 
vailing influence upon the teachers and courses of the 
elementary schools in the United States. 
The industrial phases of Pestalozzi’s and Fellenberg’s 
work, however, were slower in coming into the United 
States than into most of the European countries. They 
were given publicity through the descriptions of William 
C. Woodbridge in the American Journal of Education 
and the American Annals of Education in 1831-1832, 
after his visit to Hofwyl, and through articles by others 
on the subject, and were rapidly introduced into various 
types of schools. It was not, however, until 1873, with 
the visit of Miss Mary Carpenter, the English prison 
reformer, that the ‘contract labor’ of the reformatories 
began to be replaced with farming, gardening, and 
kindred domestic industries. But in the second quarter
-P-A-G-E-175
PESTALOZZI, EDUCATION AS DEVELOPMENT 165 
of the nineteenth century a very large number of insti- 
tutions of secondary or higher grade with manual labor 
features, in addition to the literary work, sprang into 
existence in the United States. The students were thus 
enabled to obtain exercise and self-support throughout 
their course. Little attention was given to the peda- 
gogical principles underlying this work, however, and as 
material conditions improved and formal social life de- 
veloped, the industrial work of most of these institutions 
was givenup. Further, such schools as Carlisle, Hamp- 
ton, and Tuskegee adopted industrial training for some 
special type of education, and the work has also been 
largely used in the education of defectives. Within the 
last decade there has been a growing tendency to 
employ industrial training for the sake of holding pupils 
longer in school and increasing the efficiency of the pub- 
lic system. In so far as this has tended to replace the 
more general educational values of manual training, once 
so popular, with skill in some special industrial process, 
this modern movement represents a return to Pestalozzi.

CHAPTER X e 
‘HERBART AND EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE 
A most elaborate development of Pestalozzi’s prin- Herbart de- 
ciples was that introduced by Herbart. This great Peloed 
educationalist was first inspired by the Swiss reformer, Hier 
but his careful training and his keen philosophical in- ¢mPhasizing

the ‘observation’ and the pedagogical devices of his 
homely master until they formed a well-rounded system. 
He stressed the educational process from the stand- 
point of the teacher, and paid the most minute atten- 
tion to method. He is the first example of the philos- 
bpher and psychologist in education. His contemporary, 
Froebel, was an immediate pupil and colleague of Pes- 
talozzi, and probably owed more. to his influence. He, 
however, lacked the complete philosophic insight and 
training of Herbart, and never became quite as clear and 
systematic, or paid such minute attention to method.

paternal grandfather was rector of the gymnasium at 
Oldenburg, Herbart’s native town, and his father was 
a lawyer and privy councilor there. Moreover, the 
mother of Herbart is known to have been ‘a rare and 
‘ wonderful woman,’ who was able to assist her son in 
his Greek and mathematics, and to do much toward 
directing his education. While still a youth in the 
gymnasium, Herbart showed that he himself possessed 
_ ;that ‘many-sided and balanced interest’ he afterward 
~’ commended, and soon distinguished himself by writing — 
“essays upon moral freedom and_ other metaphysical 
subjects. At the University of Jena, under the inspira- 
‘tion of Fichte, he produced incisive critiques upon the 
treatises of that philosopher and of the other great 
idealist of the age, Schelling, and began to work out his 
own system of thought. Just before graduation, how- 
ever, Herbart left the university to become private tutor 
to the three sons of Herr von Steiger-Reggisberg, Gov- 
ernor of Interlaken, Switzerland. During the two years 
(797-1799) that he occupied this position, he obtained 
his only real practical experience in pedagogy. He was 
required by his patron to make bi-monthly a written re- 
port of the methods he used and of his pupils’ progress 
in their studies and conduct. Five of these letters are 
still extant, and reveal the germs of the elaborate system 
that was afterward to bear the name of Herbart. The 
youthful pedagogue seems thus early to have based his

methods of training upon psychology. He showed a due 
regard for the respective ages and individualities of his 
pupils, and undertook to develop in them the elements 
of morality and a ‘many-sided interest.’ 
While in Switzerland, Herbart met Pestalozzi and 
was greatly attracted by the underlying principles of 
that reformer. He paid a visit to the institute at Burg- 
dorf in 1799, and during the next two years, while at 
Bremen completing his interrupted university course, 
he attempted to render more scientific the thought of 
the Swiss educator. It was at this time that Herbart 
wrote a critical, but kindly, essay On Pestalozzi’s Latest 
Writing, ‘How Gertrude Teaches Her Children, and 
made his interpretation of Pestalozsi’s Idea of an ABC 
of Observation? In the former work, Herbart gives an 
account of the aim and methods of Pestalozzi and shows 
the development of his own ideas from Pestalozzianism. 
The latter treatise describes the value, cultivation, and 
_ use of observation, and attempts to found the method 
of Pestalozzi upon a definite mathematical theory. 
His Moral Revelation of the World and His 
General Pedagogy 
Following this period, from 1802 to 1809, Herbart lec- 
tured® on pedagogy at the University of Gdttingen.

‘educative instruction,’ or real ethical training. Sense

in his standard work on General Pedagogy, which he 
produced shortly afterward. Nim

His Seminary and Practice School at Kénigsberg 
In 1809 Herbart was called to the chair of philosophy 
at Kénigsberg as practically the successor of the illus- 
trious Immanuel Kant,! and there did his great work 
for educational theory and practice. He soon estab- 
lished his now historic pedagogical seminary and the 
practiceschool connected with it. This constituted the 
first attempt at experimentation and a scientific study 
of education on the basis now generally employed in 
universities. The students, who taught in the practice 
school under the supervision and criticism of the pro- 
fessor, were intending to become school principals and 
inspectors, and, through the widespread work and 
influence of these young Herbartians, the educational 
system of Prussia and of every other state in Germany 
was greatly advanced. In his numerous publications 
at Kénigsberg, Herbart devoted himself chiefly to de- 
veloping a series of works on his system of psychology, 
but he also wrote a number of essays and letters upon 
education. -The conservatism and opposition to free 
inquiry in Prussia, however, eventually became too 
restrictive for a man of Herbart’s progressive tempera- 
ment. 
1Kant died in 1804, and was succeeded by Wilhelm Traugott Krug, 
who resigned in 1809 to accept the chair at Leipzig.

The Matured System in His Outlines 
After serving nearly a quarter of a century in Konigs- 
berg, he accepted a call to a professorship at Géttingen, 
and the last eight years of his life were spent in expand- _ 
ing his pedagogical positions and lecturing with great 
approval at his old station. Here, in 1835, he published 
his Outlines of Pedagogical Lectures, in which six years 
later he embodied his Ouilines of General Pedagogy’ 
This treatise gives an exposition of his educational sys- 
tem when fully matured, together with its relation to 
psychology. The work proved to be his swan’s song, 
for, shortly after the new edition appeared, Herbart died 
at the height of his reputation.’ 
e 
Herbart’s ‘Ideas’ and ‘Apperception Masses’ 
To understand the educational principles of Herbart, 
it is necessary to know something of his psychology 
and of the metaphysics lying back of it. With the 
possible exception of Kant’s educational theories, Her- 
bart’s was the first real system of education that was

4 His complete works were not published until 1850, when Hartenstein 
collected them. The most satisfactory collection at present is that found 
in the seventh edition of Bartholomii, revised by von Sallwitirk (Langen- 
salza,'1903).
-P-A-G-E-183
HERBART AND EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE 173 
based upon a psychology worked out by the founder. 
His psychological positions have now been almost en- 
tirely abandoned or reconstructed, but the idea of» 
founding education upon psychology has been produc- . 
tive of a marked advance in educational theory. This 
system of psychology was an outgrowth of his own 
introspection. With Herbart, the simplest elements of 
consciousness are ‘ideas,’ which result from the vary- 
ing states into which the soul is thrown in endeavoring 
to maintain itself against external stimuli. Once pro- 
duced, the ideas become existences with their own 
dynamic force, and constantly strive to preserve them- . 
selves. They struggle to attain as nearly as possible 
to the summit of consciousness, and each idea tends 
to draw into consciousness or heighten those allied to 
it, and to depress or force out those which are unlike. 
Hence in the constant interaction between ideas present 
. 
1This psychology is part of a pluralistic metaphysics somewhat re- 
sembling the doctrine of ‘ideas’ in Plato or Kant’s ‘Dinge an sich,’ 
and even more the ‘monadology’ of Leibnitz. Herbart assumes an 
unseen universe, composed of ‘units’ called ‘reals,’ which are unchange- 
able and constitute the ‘noumena’ of which our experiences are the ‘phe- 
nomena.’ His ‘reals,’ however, are mere existences, and, unlike the 
‘monads,’ do not possess activity of any sort, save that of ‘self-preserva- 
tion’ against annihilation. The soul is simply a species of superior ‘real.? 
Its sole function in psychology seems to be that of producing the ideas or 
mind atoms in reaction to the outside world, for once the ideas are born 
they go on by their own laws, and the parent ‘soul’ plays no further part 
in their life.

- at the same time in consciousness, ‘similar’ ideas 
fuse or combine into a homogeneous whole, and be- 
come more powerful in resisting all efforts to drive 
them out of consciousness; ‘disparate’ ideas, or those 
which cannot be compared, also combine, but form a 
complex or group rather than an indistinguishable 
unity; while ‘contrary,’ or hostile ideas, produce actual 
opposition, and each attempts to drive the other out of 
consciousness. For example, ‘sweetness’ and ‘white- 
ness’ would be ‘disparate’ ideas, since they are not 
of the same class and might coexist in our idea of an 
object, but ‘whiteness’ and ‘blackness’ are so ‘con- 
trary’ that one would necessarily contradict the other. 
Each new idea or group of ideas is, therefore, re- 
tained, modified, or réjected according to its degree 
of harmony or conflict with the previously existing 
ideas... In other words, all new ideas are interpreted 
~ through those already in consciousness. This principle, 
which Herbart called apperception, is the central doctrine 
in his whole educational system, and he constantly 
returns to it from many different angles. In accord- 
ance with ‘apperception’ the teacher can hope to

secure interest and the attention of the pupil to any 
new idea or set of ideas and have him retain it, only 
through making use of his body of related knowledge. 
The educational problem thus becomes how to present 
new material in such a way that it can be ‘apperceived,’ 
or incorporated with the old. Hence, too, the soul of 
the pupil is largely in the hands of the teacher, since 
he can make or modify his ‘apperception masses,’ or 
systems of ideas. 
The Moral and Religious Aim of Education 
It is probably because of this control of the pupil’s 
destiny by his instructors that Herbart holds the aim 
of education should be to establish the moral life or 
character. His Outlines opens with the statement :— 
“The term ‘virtue’ expresses the whole purpose of education. 
Virtue is the idea of ‘inner freedom,’ which has developed into an 
abiding actuality in an individual. Whence, as inner freedom is 
a relation between ‘insight’ and ‘volition,’ a double task is at 
once set before the teacher. It becomes his business to make 
actual each one of these factors separately, in order that later a 
permanent relationship may result.” 
In other words, virtue is attained by the pupil when 
his perception of what is right and wrong is in com- 
plete accord with his deeds, and the aim of education 
should, therefore, be to instil such ideas as will develop 
both his understanding of the moral order and a con- tho: pee 
in conscipys-

Besides

tion of con- 
duct with 
‘insight,’ 
Herbart 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
176 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
scientious spirit in carrying it out. “To induce the 
pupil to make this effort,” Herbart admits, “is a diffi- 
cult achievement. It is easy enough, by the study of 
the example of others, to cultivate theoretical acumen; 
the moral application to the pupil himself, however, 
can be successfully made only in so far as his inclina- 
tions and habits have taken a direction in keeping with 
his insight.” To make clearer the meaning of this 
‘inner freedom’ and the ethical aim, Herbart formulates 
four subsidiary moral concepts, which make up the ele- 
ments of character and must be understood by the 
teacher. These are ‘efficiency of will,’ which includes 
positiveness of purpose, vigor in action, and harmony 
with the ethical order of the world; ‘good will,’ or 
recognition of the welfare of others as if it were one’s 
own; ‘justice,’ the idea of rights, which demands 
abstinence from contention; and ‘equity,’ which arises 
when existing relations are changed for good or evil, 
and is the basis of society’s systems of punishments or 
rewards. These five fundamental concepts should from 
the first be incorporated into the pupil’s stock of ideas. 
But even the attainment of moral living is not’ suf- 
ficient. Herbart declares : — 
“Tt is necessary to combine moral education proper, which in 
everyday life lays stress continually on correct self-determination, 
with religious training. The notion that something really worthy 
has been achieved, needs to be tempered by humility. Conversely, 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  
    HERBART AND EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE 177 
religious education has need of the moral also to forestall cant 
and hypocrisy, which are only too apt to appear where morality 
has not already secured a firm foothold through earnest self- 
questioning and self-criticism with a view to improvement.” 
‘Many-Sided Interest’ and the ‘Historical’ and 
‘Scientific’ Studies 
The making of the morally religious man is, therefore, 
Herbart’s idea of the end of education. His ultimate 
aim must, however, be attained through instruction, 
and since that medium has to deal with the human 
mind, the more immediate purpose must be based upon 
psychology, just as the final goal is dependent upon 
ethics. It is obvious to Herbart that existing instruc- 
tion has not succeeded, because it is based upon a 
false psychological theory. He maintains that “what 
is customarily ascribed to the action of the various 
‘faculties’ takes place in certain groups of ideas.’ 
Even ‘will,’ upon which man’s character rests, is not 
to be regarded as an ‘independent faculty.’ “Volition 
has its root in thought,” he claims, “not, indeed, in the 
details one knows, but certainly in the combination and 
1 From the nature of Herbart’s psychology, the soul or self cannot, as 
with Leibnitz or Kant, be an original synthetic activity, which forms expe- 
rience. It cannot be possessed of innate powers or ‘faculties,’ as sup- 
posed by those who would treat the chief types of mental states as real 
forces, but consists merely of the aggregate of ideas and their combina- 
, tions.

: t 
total effect of the acquired ideas.” A careful study 
must, accordingly, be made of each pupil’s -thought 
masses, temperament, and mental capacity and processes, 
to determine how instruction may furnish a ‘moraf* 
revelation of the world.’ In Herbart’s judgment :— 
“Instruction in the sense of mere information-giving contains 
no guarantee whatever that it will materially counteract faults 
and influence existing groups of ideas that are independent of the 
imparted information. But it is these ideas that education must 
reach; for the kind and extent of assistance that instruction may 
render to conduct may depend upon the hold it has upon them.” 
There is not much likelihood of the pupil’s receiving 
ideas of virtue that will develop into glowing ideals of 
conduct when his studies do not appeal to his thought 
systems and are consequently regarded with indifference 
and aversion. They must coalesce with the ideas he 
already has, and thus touch his life, if interest is to be 
felt and will aroused. Instruction must be so selected 
_ and arranged as to appeal to the previous experience of 
the pupil, and to reveal all the relations of life and con- 
_ duct in their fullness. To expand the mental horizon and 
open every avenue of approach to his ideas, interests, 
and will, it is necessary that the pupil should be given 
as broad instruction as possible. In this way only can 
a wide range of ideas be furnished and the necessary 
‘many-sided interest’ created. In analyzing the ‘many- - 
sided interest,’ Herbart further holds that ‘ideas and
-P-A-G-E-189
  & 
HERBART AND EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE 179 
interests spring from two main sources, — ‘experience,’ 
which furnishes us with a knowledge of nature, and 
‘social intercourse,’ from which come the sentiments 
‘toward our fellow men. Interests may, therefore, be 
classed as belonging to (1) ‘knowledge’ or (2) ‘partici- 
pation.’ These two sets of interests, in turn, Herbart 
divides into three groups each. He classes the ‘knowl- 
edge’ interests as (a) ‘empirical,’ appealing directly to 
the senses; (b) ‘speculative,’ seeking to- perceive the 
relations of cause and effect; and (c) ‘zsthetic,’ resting 
upon the enjoyment of contemplation. The ‘ participa- 
tion’ interests are divided into (a) ‘sympathetic,’ dealing 
with relations to other individuals; (6) ‘social,’ including 
the community as a whole; and (c) ‘religious,’ treating 
‘one’s relations to the Divine. After making this analysis 
of the six types of interest that are needed, he also dilates 
upon the dangers of one-sidedness in each case, and en- 
deavors'to “bring out more clearly the manifold phases 
of interest that must be taken into account.” 
For Herbart, then, just as religious morality is the final 
aim of education, the more immediate purpose of instruc- 
tion is many-sided interest. “Instruction,” he declares, 
“will form the circle of thought, and education the char- 
acter. The last is nothing without the first. Herein 
is contained the whole sum of my pedagogy.” Since 
character is thus to develop through the medium of in- 
struction and the growth of concrete knowledge, which ; 
. There is 
needed a 
‘many-sided 
interest.’ 
‘This will in- 
clude inter- 
ests of (1) 
‘knowledge,’ 
which are 
‘divided into 
‘empirical,’ 
‘speculative,’ 
and ‘zs- 
thetic,’ and 
of (2) ‘par- 
ticipation,’ 
which are 
divided into 
‘sympa- thetic,’ 
‘social,’ and 
‘religious.’

should be as broad as possible, the subject-matter of the 
curriculum should cover the entire range of known ideas. 
Hence, to correspond to the two main groups of interests, 
Herbart divides all studies into two main branches, — 
the (x) ‘historical,’ including history, literature, and lan- 
guages; and the (2) ‘scientific,’ embracing mathematics 
and industrial training, as well as the natural sciences. 
But, while all these subjects are needed for a ‘many-sided 
interest’ and the various studies have for convenience 
been separated and classified by themselves, they must 
be so arranged in the curriculum as to become unified and 
an organic whole, if the unity of the pupil’s consciousness 
is to be maintained. Concerning this Herbart holds : — 
“Scattering no less than one-sidedness forms an antithesis to 
many-sidedness. Many-sidedness is to be the basis of virtue ; 
but the latter is an attribute of personality, hence it is evident 
that the unity of self-consciousness must not be impaired. The 
business of instruction is to form the person on many sides, and 
accordingly to avoid a distracting or dissipating effect. And in- 
struction has successfully avoided this in the case of one who 
with ease surveys his well-arranged knowledge in all of its unify- 
ing relations and beholds it together as his very own.” 
‘Correlation,’ ‘Concentration,’ and the ‘Culture Epochs’ 
-This position of Herbart forecasts the emphasis upon. 
correlation, or the unification: of studies, so common 
among his followers. The principle was further de- 
veloped by later Herbartians under the name of concen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-191

tration, or the unifying of all subjects about one common 
central study, such as literature or history. But the 
‘selection and articulation of the subject-matter in such a 
way as to arouse many-sidedness and harmony is not 
more than hinted at by Herbart himself. He specifically 
holds, however, that Homer’s Odyssey should be the 
first work read, since this represents the interests and 
activities of the race while in its youth, and would appeal 
to the individual during the same stage. He would 
follow this epic with the Iliad, the Philoctetes of Sopho- 
cles, the histories of Xenophon, Plato’s dialogues, and 
other classics, in the order of the growing complexity 
of racial interests depicted in them.’ This tentative 
endeavor of Herbart, in the selection of material for the 
course of study, to parallel the development of the in- 
dividual with that of the race, was also continued and 
enlarged by the disciples of Herbart. It especially 
became definite and fixed in the culture epoch theory 
formulated by Ziller and others.” 
‘ ‘Absorption and Reflection’ and the ‘Formal Steps 
of Instruction’ 
But to secure this broad range of material and to unify 
and systematize it, Herbart realized that it was necessary

to formulate a method of instructing the child. Due 
sequence and order must be introduced to shape the 
material into a well-arranged structure. This plan of 
instruction he wished to conform to the development and 
working of the human mind, and in this connection in- 
troduced his distinction between absorption and reflection.? 
This twofold mental process is necessary in grasping all 
* new knowledge, and the alternation between the two 
steps has sometimes been described as the ‘breathing’ 
of the mind. ‘Absorption’ is giving oneself up to ac- 
quisition or contemplation of facts or ideas, and ‘reflec- 
tion’ is the unification or assimilation of the manifold 
knowledge gained by absorption. As these two stages 
are mutually exclusive, the pupil passes in psychical 
development from one to the other. On the basis of 
this description of mental activity and growth, Herbart 
worked out the outlines of his logical method in instruc- 
tion, which he states as follows : — 
“We prescribe the general rule: give equal prominence to 
absorption and reflection in every group of objects, even the 
smallest; that is to say, emphasize equally clearness of the "~~ 
vidual perception, association of the manifold, codrdination ¢ 
associated, and progress through exercise according to thi. __

is purely ‘absorption’; (2) association, the uniting of 
these with related facts previously acquired, is mainly 
‘absorption,’ but contains elements of ‘reflection’; (3) 
system, the coherent and logical arrangement of what 
has been associated, is non-progressive or passive ‘reflec- 
tion’; and (4) method, the practical application of the 
system by the pupil to new data, is progressive or active 
‘reflection.’ The formulation of this method was made 
only in principle by Herbart, but it has since been largely 
modified and developed by his followers. - It was soon 
felt that, on the principle of ‘apperception,’ the pupil 
must first be made conscious of his existing stock of ideas 
so far as they are similar to the material to be presented, 
~and that this can be accomplished by a review of preced- 
ing lessons or by an outline of what is to be undertaken, 
or by both procedures. Hence Herbart’s noted disciple, 
Ziller, divided the step of ‘clearness’ into preparation 
and presentation, and the more recent Herbartian, Rein, 
added aim as a substep to ‘preparation.’ The names of 
the other three processes have been changed for the sake 
of greater lucidity and significance by the later Herbar- 
tians, and the five formal (i.e. ‘rational’) steps of instruc- 
tion are now generally given as (1) preparation, (2) pres- 
entation, (3) comparison and abstraction, (4) generali- 
zation, and (5) application? Herbart also made numer-

ous other suggestive analyses and interpretations of the 
mechanics of instruction.! 
‘Government’ and ‘Training’ in Discipline 
As a corollary of his improvements in method, Her- 
bart’s ideas concerning discipline are important and well 
worthy of consideration. While he admits the need of 
‘government,’ which is repressive, he sharply distin- 
guishes this from ‘training,’ or real moral education, for 
- which the former is intended to prepare. The purpose 
of government is to hold the pupils in order and subser- 
vient to the will of the teacher until moral habits are 
formed. It should keep them properly occupied and 
supervised, and should issue prohibitions and commands,’ 
rewards and punishments. «But an irreparable moral 
injury is wrought if pupils are forever governed and never 
trained. “The function of training,” says Herbart, 
“does not consist in always restraining and meddling ; 
still less, in grafting the practices of others to take the 
Place of the pupil’s self-activity.” Training shapes the 
will for self-control, as.cannot be done by constant re- 
pression or emotional appeals. Aid and sympathy from 
the teacher are correlated with confidence and dependence 
upon the part of the pupil. Training is thus the parent 
of voluntary codperation, and should be the ultimate

aim of schoolroom discipline. It unites with ‘educative 
instruction’ to form character. 
The Value and Influence of Herbart’s Principles 
On all sides, then, as compared with Pestalozzi, Her- 
bart was most logical and comprehensive... The former 
was primarily a philanthropist and reformer; the latter 27né 
a psychologist and philosopher. Pestalozzi succeeded 
in arousing Europe to the need of universal education 
and of vitalizing the prevailing formalism in the schools, 
but he was unable with his vague and unsystematic 
utterances to give guidance and efficiency to the reform 
forces he had initiated. While he felt the need of ‘psy- 
chologizing instruction’ and of beginning with sense per- 
ception for the sake of clear idea’, he had neither the time 
nor the training to construct a psychology beyond the 
traditional one of the times, nor to analyze the way the 
material gained by observation could be assimilated. 
Herbart, on the other hand, did create a system of psy- 
chology that had an immediate bearing upon education. 
He showed how the product of observation was assim- 
ilated through ‘apperception,’ and maintained the pos- 
sibility of making all material tend toward moral develop- 
ment through ‘educative instruction.’ This, he held, 
could be accomplished by use of the proper courses and 
methods. In determining the subjects to be selected and 
articulated, he considered Pestalozzi’s emphasis upon the and the prin- 
ciple of ‘ap- 
perception,’ and. made all

study of the physical world to be merely a stepping- - 
stone to his own ‘moral revelation of the world,’ and, 
while the former made arithmetic, geography, and natural 
sciences his chief care, he preferred to stress history, lan- 
guages, and literature. He also first undertook a careful 
analysis of the successive steps in all instruction. 
On the other hand, a great drawback to the Herbar- 
tian doctrines is found in their formalization. But while 
Herbart’s psychological system is most mechanical and 
applies better to the process of instruction than to the 
human being in general, it has started all the fruitful 
research in psycho-physics, and has worked well as a 
basis for educational theory and practice. There has 
been considerable danger, too, that the attempt of Her- 
bart to bring about due sequence and arrangement in 
instruction would become perverted through his disciples 
into an inflexible schema, but it has, upon the whole, 
done much to introduce system and order into the work 
of the classroom. As we shall see, where Froebel under- 
took to explain Pestalozzi’s rather vague conceptions of 
following the nature of the child by elaborating it on 
the volitional side, Herbart renders it more explicit by 
an intellectual interpretation While Froebel’s empha-

strength and weakness and in these formulations of his 
is indicated how differently from the mystic founder of 
the kindergarten he had developed the naive practice 
and formulations of Pestalozzi. 
The Extension of His Doctrines through Disciples 
in Germany 
‘The theoretical foundations of Herbart, however, were 
laid mostly in outline. He himself had but little experi- 
ence in teaching and had no opportunity to work out his 
principles in the schoolroom. His early disciples, how- 
ever, were able to fill in and extend his work. They 
reduced his theories to practice and applied them to the 
content and methods of the elementary and secondary 
systems of Germany. From practically the beginning 
there were two contemporary schools of Herbartianism. 
In its application of Herbart’s theory, the school of Stoy 
for the most part held closely to the original form; but 
that headed by Ziller gave it a freer interpretation, and 
contributed some important modifications and elabo- 
rations. Karl Volkmar Stoy had been a student under 
Herbart after that philosopher’s return to Gdttingen. 
He became a professor at Jena, and established there a 
pedagogical seminary and practice school upon the Her- 
bartian basis. His Encyclopaedia of Pedagogics and His work was 
extended by 
his dis- 
ciples, — 
Stoy, who 
held to the 
original lit- 
erally, and

and elabo- 
rated ;

numerous other educational works were mainly a force- 
ful restatement of Herbart’s positions. Tuiskon Ziller, 
both as a teacher in a gymnasium and as professor at 
Leipzig, did much to popularize and develop the Her- 
bartian system. His great work, The Basis of the Doc- 
trine of Educative Instruction,’ brought Herbartianism 
into prominence, and resulted in the formation of the 
society known as the ‘Association for the Scientific 
Study of Education,’ * which has since spread through- 
out Germany. Ziller further emphasized Herbart’s 
division of the curriculum into two groups of studies, 
and made clear the subordination of the ‘scientific’ 
studies to the ‘historical.’ He also elaborated the doc- 
trines of ‘correlation’ and ‘concentration,’ and was the 
first definitely to formulate the ‘culture epoch’ theory. 
“Every pupil should,” said he, “pass successively through 
each of the chief epochs of the general mental develop- 
ment of mankind suitable to his stage of development. 
The material of instruction, therefore, should be drawn 
from the thought material of that stage of historical de- 
velopment in culture, which runs parallel with the present 
mental stage.of the pupil.’* These principles Ziller 
worked out practically in a course of study for the eight

years of the elementary school, which he centered around 
fairy tales, Robinson Crusoe, and selections from the 
Old and New Testaments. He, moreover, developed 
Herbart’s ‘formal stages of instruction’ by dividing 
the first step and changing the name of the last. 
Other Germans to influence Herbartianism have been 
Lange, Rein, and Frick. Karl Lange’s Apperception is 
an excellent combination of scientific insight and popular 
presentation. It treats the various problems of educa- 
tion on the basis that “all learning is apperceiving.” He 
agrees in general with the Herbartian method, but warns 
against its mechanics and formalism. Wilhelm Rein, 
a pupil of both Stoy and Ziller, succeeded the former at 
Jena, but is closer to the latter in his interpretation of 
Herbart. His Outlines of Pedagogy ' shows the develop- 
ment that has taken place since the time of Herbart. 
He adopts Ziller’s ‘concentration’ and ‘culture epochs,’ 
but makes these theories more rational by coérdinating 
other material with the ‘historical’ center in the curricu- 
lum. Otto Frick, director of the ‘Francke Institutions’ 
at Halle? inclining more to the litera] interpretation of 
Stoy, devoted himself to applying Herbartianism to the 
secondary schools? A throng of other German school-

masters and professors have further adapted the doc- 
trines of Herbart to the school, and while their theories 
differ very largely from one another, from their common 
basis they are all properly designated ‘Herbartian.’ 
Herbartianism in the United States 
Next to the land of its birth, the United States has 
been more influenced by Herbartianism than any other 
country. The movement was fostered largely by Amer- 
ican teachers who had taken the doctor’s degree in Ger- 
many, and during the last decade of the nineteenth cen- 
tury it attained almost to the proportions of a cult. In 
1892 ‘The National Herbart Society’ was founded to 
extend the scope of these principles and to adapt them 
to American conditions. The association started imme- 
diately to translate the works of Herbart and various 
German Herbartians, and since 1895 it has regularly 
published a Year Book. Besides these efforts, individual 
members of the organization have been active in dis- 
cussing Herbartian ‘principles and their embodiment in 
our methods of instruction. Charles DeGarmo, pro- 
fessor of Education at Cornell University, who was the 
first president of the Herbart Society and the editor of 
its publications, has given wide popularity to many of 
the principles and has utilized them as the basis of his 
textbooks. Frank M. McMurry of the Columbia 
University Teachers College, and his brothet, Charles

A. McMurry, of the Illinois State Normal University, 
both by books and articles, have done yeoman service 
for Herbartianism. 
Moreover, many who would hardly consider themselves 
Herbartians have undertaken to modify and adapt these 
principles, especially ‘correlation’ and ‘concentration.’ 
Francis W. Parker of Chicago, for example, sought to 
center the course of study around a hierarchy of natural 
and social sciences, and his associate, Wilbur S. Jackman, 
attempted a correlation of science and history. The 
Committee of Fifteen, appointed by the National Edu- 
cation Association to report upon elementary education, 
show Herbartian influence in their discussions of ‘corre- 
lation,’ although they give the term a wider interpreta- 
tion. Various other types of unification about a core of 
literature, history, or nature study, or, through combi- 
nation with Froebelianism, of social activities, have been 
suggested. 
While in this way all elementary and to some extent 
secondary schools have been affected, Herbartianism in 
its purity has been largely abandoned for less dogmatic 
methods. Even the Herbart Society has ceased to exist 
as a propaganda and has since 1901 been known as ‘The 
National Society for the Scientific Study of Education.’ 
Yet probably no system of pedagogy has had so wide 
an influence upon American education and upon the 
thought and practice of teachers generally. while many 
not Herbar- 
tians have 
used ‘corre- 
lation’ and 
‘concentra- 
tion’ in 
modified 
forms. 
Yet Her- 
bartianism, 
while most 
influential, 
has become 
less of a 
propaganda.

FROEBEL AND THE KINDERGARTEN 
ANOTHER great educational theorist to develop the 
the icles principles of Pestalozzi was Friedrich Froebel, the 
of Pe founder of the kindergarten. He and Herbart may be 
regarded as contemporary disciples and interpreters of 
the Swiss educator, who was born 4 generation before 
them, but they continued his work along rather different 
lines. As Herbart concerned -himself with method and 
the work of the teacher, so Froebel laid emphasis upon 
the child’s development and activities. The latter was 
perhaps a more logical successor of Pestalozzi, whose 
immediate pupil and colleague he had been, but he, too, 
worked out more broadly and explicitly the implications 
of the master, and attempted to interpret them after 
. the philosophy and science of the times. Moreover, he 
developed his system for a period of life totally untouched 
by Pestalozzi, and formulated principles and methods 
that have come to underlie every stage of education in 
modern times. 
Froebel’s Early Life and His Experience at Jena 
Friedrich Wilhelm August Froebel (1782-1852) was born 
in Oberweissbach, a village in the Thiiringian forest. 
194
-P-A-G-E-205
—< rte FROEBEL AND THE KINDERGARTEN 195 
His father was a Lutheran clergyman, and the religious 
influence of the home made an ineradicable impression 
upon Froebel. The elder Froebel, however, was engrossed 
in the multitudinous cares of his scattered charge, and a 
little half-brother soon came to engage all the love and 
attention of the boy’s stepmother. Froebel’s childhood 
was: consequently neglected, and he spent much time 
roving about the mysterious woods, and pondering on 
the birds, wild animals, plants, flowers, and the various 
phenomena of nature. Thus there grew within him that 
vein of mysticism and search for hidden unity which 
afterward entered so profoundly into his educational 
theories. This desire to find a ‘connectedness’ in all 
things was increased by the sporadic nature and the iso- 
lation from life that were only too apparent in what little 
formal schooling he did receive. At fifteen he was for 
two years apprenticed to a forester, and, although his 
master could not afford him proper instruction, the youth 
was enabled to continue his religious communion with 
nature. He enlarged his wood lore and practical ac- 
quaintance with plants, and gained some scientific knowl- 
edge of botany through books borrowed from a physician 
in the neighborhood. 
At length, Froebel’s hunger for a knowledge of the 
natural sciences impelled him to overcome parental oppo- 
sition and enter the university at Jena. This institution 
had become the intellectual center of Germany, and the Going to the

atmosphere was charged with the idealistic philosophy, 
the romantic movement, and the evolutionary attitude 
in science. Although Froebel was at Jena for the pur- 
pose of pursuing more practical subjects, he could not 
well have escaped the discussions upon Fichtian philos- 
ophy, which were current upon the street, at the table, 
and in every informal place of meeting, and he must have 
witnessed the academic growth of Fichte’s pupil and 
colleague, Schelling. He must likewise have fallen under 
the spell of the Jena romanticists, — the Schlegels, Tieck, 
and Novalis, and possibly even of their friends and pro- 
tectors, Goethe and Schiller. The advanced attitude 
in science at Jena must also have impressed the youth. 
“While much of the science instruction failed to make clear 
that inner relation and mystic unity for which he sought, 
he must occasionally have caught glimpses of it in the 
lectures of the professors. Unhappily, after a couple of 
years, all this enchanted world was closed to him through 
financial difficulties not altogether his own fault, and he 
returned home in scholastic disgrace and disillusionment. 
His Adoption of Teaching and Stay with Pestalozzi 
For the next four years, Froebel was wandering and 
groping for a niche in life. He tried one occupation after 
another in keeping with his preparation — agriculture, 
Jand-surveying, clerical work in forestry, and manage- 
ment of country estates— but managed now and then to
-P-A-G-E-207
  ee FROEBEL AND THE’ KINDERGARTEN 107 
absorb philosophy and romanticism and indulge his liter- 
ary impulse. Eventually, in 1805, while beginning the 
study of architecture in Frankfurt, he met Dr. Anton 
Griiner, head of a Pestalozzian model school, who per- 
suaded him of his fitness for teaching and gave him a 
position in ‘the institution. Of the result Froebel de- 
clared: ‘‘From the first I found something I had always 
longed for, but always missed; as if my life had at last 
discovered its native element. I felt as happy as a fish 
in water.” 
But it was soon evident to the new teacher that he 
had a sufficient knowledge of neither subject-matter nor 
the laws of mental development to achieve much success 
in his chosen profession. Five days after his appoint- 
ment he-paid a brief visit to Pestalozzi at Yverdun, and 
upon his return undertook a systematic study of Pesta- 
. lozzianism under the guidance of Griiner. He also began 
in this period to develop his own principles and methods, 
and, through the use of modeling in paper, pasteboard, 
and wood with some private pupils, came to see the value 
of the creative instinct as a means of education. After 
three years in Frankfurt‘he withdrew for further study 
and practice at Yverdun. The two years he spent there 
proved most profitable. He gained much from the train- 
ing in physiography and nature study that he gave the 
pupils during long walks in the country; he found an 
opportunity to“study the play of children in its effect he stumbled

upon intellectual as well as physical development; he 
first came to attach importance to that earliest training 
of a child by its mother; and his knowledge of music, 
which was to play so important a part in his methods, was 
greatly enlarged. Moreover, he came to feel that the 
lack of organization and the deficiency in unity and con- 
nection of studies that were always evident in Pesta- 
lozzi’s work were an evidence of vagueness in aim and 
method, and he determined to eliminate these faults by 
making more definite the underlying principles of his 
master. 
     
  Crystallization of His Law of ‘Unity’ at Berlin 
As a further result of his stay in Yverdun, Froebel 
:began to see more than ever the needof a broader training, 
if he were going to unify education, and as soon as 
sible he gave up his work in Frankfurt, and renewet 
university studies. He went first to Géttingen in 1811, 
but was the next year attracted to Berlin by the 
tation of Professor Weiss in mineralogy. While 
_ Weiss, he became fully “convinced of the demonstrable 
connection in all cosmic development,” and thus 
tallized that nrystic law of unity with which he had 
been struggling. Of this he declared : — 
' “What I had recognized in things great or nc. 
man and in the ways of God, as serving towards 
of the human race, I found I could here recognize a! 
of these fixed forms which Nature alone had st

    “ FROEBEL AND THE KINDERGARTEN 199 
thereafter my rocks and crystals served me as a mirror wherein I 
might discern mankind, and man’s development and history.” 
For about a year the work of Froebel was interrupted 
by service in the army to repel the Napoleonic aggressions. 
Here he met his enthusiastic young friends and lifelong as- 
sistants, Heinrich Langethal and Wilhelm Middendorf, who 
had been students of theology at Berlin. Then, in 1814, he 
returned to the university, and, as an assistant to Profes- 
sor Weiss, for a time became completely immersed in crys- 
tallography as a key to the organization of the universe. 
His School at Keilhau and the Education of Man 
But Froebel had never lost sight of his original pur- 
pose of educational reform. While at the university 
he continued his study of child nature by teaching 
in the Pestalozzian school of Plamann,! and his in- 
sight into natural science only intensified his belief in 
the possibility of “a more human, related, affiliated, 
connected treatment and consideration of the subjects of 
education.” He declined a professorship at Stockholm, 
and, in 1816, against the advice of his friendly chief, he 
even resigned from Berlin, to take charge of the education 
of five young nephews and thus work out his pedagogical 
theories. In this venture he was soon joined by Midden- 
dorf and Langethal, and with them he founded ‘The 
Universal German Institute of Education’ at the Thiirin-

gian village of Keilhau.' The education here aimed to de- 
velop the pupils harmoniously in all their powers through 
the exercise of their own activity in subjects whose rela~ 
tions with one another and with life had been carefully 
thought out. Self-expression and free development were 
the watchwords of the school. Much of the training was 
obtained through play, and, except that the pupils were 
older, the germ of the kindergarten was already present. 
There was much practical work in the open air, in the gar- 
den about the schoolhouse, and in the building itself. 
The lads built dams and mills, fortresses and castles, and 
searched the woods for animals, birds, insects, and flowers. 
They learned to work out practical problems in form and 
number, and had the world of imagination opened to 
them through romances, ballads, and war song~ ‘ 
To popularize the Institute, Froebel publishe 
a complete account of the theory practiced al 
in his famous Education of Man2 While thi:

Griesheim, where Froebel’s deceased brother, the father of three of the

hold.

compressed, repetitious, and vague, and its doctrines had 
afterward to be corrected by experience, it contains the 
most systematic statement of his educational philosophy 
that Froebel ever made. It consists in an application to 
education of the idealistic philosophy and the evolution- 
ary theory of the time. It describes Froebel’s interpre- 
tation of the universe and the consequent meaning of 
human life, makes an exposition of his chief principles 
of education, and applies them to the various stages of 
life and to the chief school subjects. 
But the times were not ripe for such radical positions, 
and the Education of Man influenced but few people in 
their estimate of the Keilhau community or the doc- 
trines of Froebel. The Institute was even suspected 
of revolutionary tendencies, and the government inspec- 
tor of schools was ordered to investigate. ‘This official, 
however, made a most favorable report, saying in 
part:— 
“T found here a closely united family of some sixty members 
held together in mutual confidence and every member seeking the 
good of the whole, ... That this union must have the most 
salutary influence on instruction and training and on the pupils 
themselves, is self-evident. ... No slumbering power remains 
unawakened ; each finds the stimulus it needs in so large a family. 
. . . The aim of the institution is by no means knowledge and 
science merely, but free self-active development of the mind from 
within.”

Nevertheless, gossip and detraction did not cease, and 
a disloyal assistant added fuel to the flames. Froebel, 
moreover, was dogmatic and irascible, and possessed little 
practical sense. While a financial crisis was for a time 
averted, the school soon found itself in serious straits.

tation to locate in the neighboring town of Willisau. 
Here he met with bitter opposition from the conservative 
clergy of the vicinity, but, at a public examination held in 
1833, his work was shown to be a striking success and his

line of what he had been attempting in his Letter to the Duke of Meiningen 
(2827) and his Leifer to Krause (1828), the Géttingen philosopher, and 
from these autobiographical works most of our ideas concerning his early 
life have been derived. He expected at one time to be granted the estate 
of the duke at Helba for his enlarged school, but the offer was to a large

seven, which should furnish “such a course of training 
as would answer to the laws of development and the laws 
of life.” The institution was located at Blankenburg, 
two miles from Keilhau, in one of the most romantic 
spots in the Thiiringian Forest, and was before long 
appropriately christened Kindergarten. Here he put 
into use the material he had invented in Switzerland, 
added new devices, and developed his system. The main 
featuresof this were the ‘play songs’ for mother and child; 
the series of six ‘gifts,’ consisting of the sphere, cube, and 
other geometrical forms; and the ‘occupations,’ which 
applied to different constructions the principles the child 
had learned through the ‘gifts.’ To this, during his 
seven years in Blankenburg, he constantly added new 
material, of which accounts periodically appeared in his 
journals? By 1843 he had thus expanded his collection 
of songs into that attractive and popular book known 
as Mother and Play Songs? ‘This work was intended to 
illustrate concretely the principles and methods sug- 
gested in the Education of Man.

and the term Kindergarten came to him like an inspiration one day while 
walking in the forest.

The Closing Days of Froebel 
Although the kindergarten attracted considerable 
attention, and many teachers came to Blankenburg to 
study the system, Froebel’s want of practical judgment 
eventually involved him in a heavy debt while endeavor- 
ing to spread his gospel.! In consequence, the institu- 
tion was obliged, in 1844, to close its doors. The next five 
years Froebel spent largely in traveling about Germany 
and lecturing upon his system, with much success, espe- 
cially before groups of mothers and women teachers. 
But in 1849 he settled down near the famous mineral 
springs at Liebenstein in Saxe-Meiningen, and shortly 
afterward married his favorite kindergartner.2 During 
this period Froebel obtained the friendship and support 
of the Baroness Berthe von Marenholtz-Biilow, who 
had .come to the watering place for recuperation. This 
intelligent and accomplished lady became his ardent dis- 
ciple. She brought a large number of people of distinction 
in the political and educational world to see his work in 
1 He undertook to organize a stock company, which should establish at 
Blankenburg a model kindergarten, a training school, a factory for kinder- 
garten-materials, and a kindergarten publishing house. The shares were 
to be taken by German women, who have little control of the purse strings, 
and the visionary scheme was doomed to failure from the start. 
2 His first wife had died in 1839. Luise Levin, his second wife, was an 
unlettered country girl, who, from a secret devotion to Froebel, entered 
menial service at Keilhau in 1845, to be near him, and although well along 
in her thirties, succeeded in securing a kindergarten training. Through

Froebel died 
under the 206 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
operation, and secured a magnificent seat for his institu- 
tion upon the neighboring estate of Marientha]l. She has 
also given us a most interesting and accurate account of 
Froebel’s activities during the last thirteen years of his 
life, and after his death she spread his principles through- 
out most of Europe. Owing to her, Froebel’s closing 
days bade fair to be most happy and successful, but in 
1852, through a confusion of his principles with the social- 
istic doctrines of his nephew, a decree was promulgated 
in Prussia by the minister of education,’ closing all 
kindergartens there. While his work could still be carried 
on in the other states of Germany, Froebel never recov- 
eréd from this unjust humiliation. His health broke 
under the strain, and he died within the year. 
Development of Froebel’s Principles 
Such, in brief, is the historical development of Froebel’s 
theories, as they were expanded and corrected by appli- 
cation to practical teaching, and -came to their culmina- 
tion in the kindergarten. His underlying principles are 
clearly the outgrowth of the religious influences of his 
boyhood and his early communion with nature, combined 
with the idealistic philosophy, the romantic movement, 
and the scientific spirit of the day. This may be seen by 
glancing at these spiritual tendencies in his times. The 
chief feature of German idealism is an interpretation of 
1 Strangely enough, this bigot was the great educationalist, von Raumer.

FROEBEL AND THE KINDERGARTEN 207 
the universe that holds to the unity of nature with the 
soul of man. The ‘Absolute,’ or God, is regarded as the 
self-conscious spirit from which originated both man and 
nature. Hence has arisen in the universe a manifold- 
ness within unity. Likewise romanticism, which charac- 
terized the literature, art, and religion of the period, is 
mystic in expression and symbolic in thought. It is 
synthetic rather than analytic in its view-point, and ap- 
peals to faith as upon a par with reason. Finally, in the 
scientific thought of the times there is apparent a feeling 
of unity and inner relation2 ‘These influences touched 
the life of Froebel at every point, and made a profound 
impression upon one of his temperament and experience. 
Besides his associations at Jena, he listened to Fichte 
again at Berlin, and here found enthusiastic students © 
of that philosopher in his co-workers, Langethal and 
Middendorf. These friends, in turn, encouraged him to 
wed that brilliant idealist and romanticist,? who, as his 
wife, greatly influenced his earlier career. Similarly, the 
scientific views of Jena? were developed in his experi- 
ences while the pupil of Weiss. It is, therefore, but natu-

ral that we should find Froebel adopting an organic and 
unitary view of life, symbolism and mysticism in expres- 
sion, and the conception of ordered evolution, and that, 
while his writings are scientific in form, they should 
appear vague, emotional, and difficult to comprehend. 
His fundamental view of organic unity appears in his 
general conception of the universe, and the Education of 
Man opens with the statement : — 
“Tn all things there lives and reigns an eternal law... . This 
law has been and is enounced with equal clearness and distinctness 
in nature (the external), in the spirit (the internal), and in life, 
which unites the two. This all-controlling law is necessarily based 
on an, all-pervading, energetic, living, self-conscious, and hence 
eternal Unity. ... This Unity is God. All things have come 
from the Divine Unity, from God, and have their origin in the 
Divine Unity, in God alone. All things live and have their being 
in ‘and through the Divine Unity, in and through God. The 
divine effluence that lives in each thing is the essence of each thing.” 
‘Unity,’ ‘Continuity,’ and ‘ Development’ as Educational 
Ideals 
From this Froebel derives his educational aim. Edu- 
cation with him “consists in a recognition of the eternal 
law, — its origin, essence, totality, connection, and in- 
* Froebel is unconsciously following Schelling, when he talks of nature, 
symbolism, or esthetics; and Fichte, when he deals with will, duty, 
Personality, and morality. Most striking is his resemblance to Schelling, 
especially as he seems to have borrowed much even of his phraseology 
from the pupil of Schelling, his friend Krause.
-P-A-G-E-219
  FROEBEL AND THE KINDERGARTEN — 209 
tensity, and the representation and practice of it in the 
life of man.” And in keeping with the definition, he holds 
in detail : — 
“The purpose of education is to raise man into free, conscious 
obedience to the divine principle that lives in him, and to a free 
representation of this principle in his life. It should lead man to 
see that this principle also constitutes the essence of nature and 
is permanently manifested in nature. It should demonstrate 
that the same law rules both nature and man, and that man and 
nature proceed from God and are conditioned by him. It should 
lead and guide him to clearness concerning himself, to peace with 
nature, and to unity with God. The inner essence of things is 
recognized by the innermost spirit of man through outer manifesta- 
tions, and all education, all instruction and training, start from the 
outer manifestations of man and things, and, proceeding from the 
outer, act upon the inner, and form its judgments concerning the 
inner.” 
As a corollary to this principle of ‘unity,’ Froebel holds 
to ‘continuity’ and ‘development’ in all creation, and so 
in the human race. “God,” he declares, “creates and 
works productively in uninterrupted continuity.” And 
again, he says: ‘‘God never grafts in the world of nature, 
nor is the soul of man to be grafted. God develops the 
most minute and imperfect elements, through ever-rising 
stages, according to a law eternally founded in itself, and 
ever unfolding out of its own nature.” , This progressive 
development from the lower to the higher grades of 
being, Froebel finds equally in the advancement of the 
P which gives 
rise to his 
aim in educa- 
tion ; 
and to 
‘continuity’ 
and ‘develop- 
ment’ in all

race and in. the history of the individual. For this 
reason, while he does not formulate any set ‘culture 
epoch’ theory, like that of the Herbartians, he holds that 
“each successive generation and each successive human 
being, inasmuch as he would understand the past and 
present, must pass through all preceding phases of hu- 
man development and culture,” and he vigorously op- 
poses “sharp limits and definite subdivisions within the 
“continuous series of the years of development, which 
withdraw from attention the permanent continuity.” 
More explicitly he maintains : — 
“It is highly pernicious to consider the stages of human develop- 
ment — infant, child, boy or girl, man or woman — as really 
distinct,! and not, as life shows them, as continuous in themselves 
in unbroken transitions. ... The child should be viewed and 
treated with reference to all stages of development and age, with- 
out breaks and omissions ; the vigorous and complete development 
_ of each successive stage depends on the vigorous, complete, and 
characteristic development of each and all preceding stages of life. 
‘The boy has not become a boy, nor has the youth become a youth, 
by reaching a certain age, but only by having lived through child- 
hood, and, further on, through boyhood, true to the requirements 
of his mind, his feelings, and his body. The child, the boy, the man, 
indeed should know no other endeavor but to be at every stage of de- 
velopment wholly what this stage calls for.” 
Similarly, this Froebelian law of ‘unity’ appears in 
every aspect of educational theory: under a variety of 
1 Contrast Rousseau’s four set divisions of Emile’s life. See pp. 86 ff. 
and ro2.
-P-A-G-E-221
  FROEBEL AND THE KINDERGARTEN 2m 
guises. It is almost too comprehensive in its various 
applications, meanings, and implications to be fitly named 
by any one word or phrase. Besides elaborating the unity 
in the universe, nature, humanity, individual man, and 
age periods, Froebel insists upon a unity in the intellec- 
tual, physical, and moral life of the individual at all 
stages, and in the relations of his mental phases of know- 
ing, feeling, and willing. 
‘Connectedness’ of All Education 
He likewise holds to a unity in subject-matter and a 
‘connectedness’ in the course of study, although he does 
not, with the Herbartians, crystallize any definite plan of 
‘correlation’ or ‘concentration.’ For instance, he de- 
clares : — 
“Human education requires the knowledge and appreciation of 
religion, nature, and language in their intimate living reciprocity 
and mutual interaction. Without the knowledge and appreciation 
of the intimate unity of the three, the school and we ourselves are 
Jost in the fallacies of bottomless, self-provoking diversity.” 
This integral unity should exist, Froebel holds, because 
of a feeling of dependence upon a higher being. Nature 
study gives acquaintance with the handiwork and mani- 
festation of God, mathematics makes clear the reign of 
law in the universe, and language must be connected with 
religious instruction, in order that words may be joined 
with real ideas in life. So writing is but an expression 
of real ideas, reading should arise from a desire to recall in intellec- 
tual, physi- 
cal, and 
moral life, 
and in -know- 
ing, feeling, 
and willing.

what has been written, and art is a striving to represent 
. the inward life. Knowledge is a tree upon which the 
new subjects spring as shoots from the established trunk 
and branches, and all compose one organic whole. And 
and be between there should likewise be a ‘connectedness’ between the 
homelife. school and homie life, unless the former is to be regarded as 
a means of cramming children’s minds with extraneous 
and external information and culture, — ‘far-fetched, 
veneered, knowledge and skill,’ instead of raising knowl- 
edge and skill, like a plant, from within. The home and 
the school are to work together in training the child, 
and the means of education should combine domestic 
and scholastic occupations. 
‘Self-activity’ and ‘Creativeness’ as the Methods of

him and reveal it with self-determination and freedom. 
“For the living thought,” says Froebel, “the eternal 
divine principle as such demands and requires free self- 
activity on the part of man, the being created for freedom 
in the image of God.” ! And later, in speaking of ‘devel- 
opment,’ he adds :— 
“This should be brought about, not in the way of dead imitation 
or mere copying, but in the way of living, spontancous self-activity.

child of God, there lies and lives humanity as a whole; but in each 
one it is realized and expressed in a wholly particular, peculiar, . 
personal, and unique manner, and it should be exhibited in each 
individual human being in this wholly peculiar, unique manner.” ? ay Rumen Peng Jn Ea : a 
y ‘self-activity’ Froebel, therefore, means more than 
mere activity. It is not simply activity in response to 
suggestion or instruction from parents or teachers that 
he seeks, but activity of the child in carrying out hi 
own impulses and decisions. Individuality must be 
developed by this activity; and selfhood given its rightful 
place as the guide to the child’s powers when exercised 
in learning. It is not sufficient that the learner shall do 
all for himself, but activity must enlist the entire self 
in all its phases of being. Development is produced 
through the exercise of function, which consists in the 
unfolding of a system of inner aims. The soul does not 
so much possess activity as it is itself activity, and instead

of being influenced by, or conforming to, its environment, 
it tends to make its environment more and more the in- 
strument of self-realization. “Training, therefore, should 
begin with the internal tendencies and volitions of the 
pupil, but, through the activities stimulated. and the 
interest guaranteed thereby, the instructional process 
should aim to direct him toward ideals and achieve- 
ments of greater importance and permanence than 
would result from these impulses, if left to them- 
selves. However, this increasing self-realization or 
individualization is also a process of socialization. It 
is bound up with participation in institutional life. 
Each one of the various human institutions in which 
the mentality of the race has manifested itself — the 
home, the school, the Church, the State, and society at 
large — becomes a medium for the activity of the indi- 
vidual, and at the same time a means of social.control. 
Each institution has its own function, but tends to com- 
plement all the others. ~\?he individual can be educated 
only in the company of other human beiigs.. Hence, 
Froebel held that in education ‘self-activity’ should be

tion with the increasing knowledge, and there is no gap 
between theory and practice. 
Hence with this development through ‘self-activity’ is 
connected Froebel’s educational principle of ‘creative- 
ness,’ by which new forms and combinations are made and 
expression is given to new images and ideas. Here also 
he at first gives his theory a mystic garb and states it in 
religious language. He declares that “‘since God created 
man in his own image, man should create and bring forth 
_ like’God; this is the high meaning, the deep significance, 
the great purpose of work and industry, of productive 
and creative activity.”1 But when he comes to deal 
with constructive handwork in the school, he bases his 
position more upon psychological grounds and says : — 
“Man is developed and cultured toward the fulfillment of his 
destiny and mission, and is to be valued, even in boyhood, not only 
by what he receives and absorbs from without, but much more 
by what he puts out and unfolds from himself. ... Plastic 
material representation in life and through doing, united with 
thought and speech, is by far more developing and cultivating than 
the merely verbal representation of ideas.” *

The Mother and Play Songs * were believed by Froebel 
to contain the best illustration of his system. Of them 
he says, “I have here laid down the fundamental ideas 
of my educational principles.” This work consists of an 
organized series of carefully selected songs, games, and 
pictures, and is intended to make clear and direct the 
| educational instinct of the mother. The songs should 
enable her to see that the child’s education begins at 
birth, and should awaken her to the responsibility of 
motherhood. They should likewise exercise the infant’s 
senses, limbs, and muscles, and, through the loving union 
between mother and child, draw both into intelligent and 
agreeable relations with the common objects of life about 
them. For the culture of the maternal consciousness, 
Froebel prefixed to the ‘play songs’ seven ‘mother’s 
songs,’ in which he depicts the mother’s feelings in viewing 
her new-born infant, and her hopes and fears as she wit- 
nesses the unfolding physical and mental life of the child. 
The fifty ‘play songs’ contain each three parts: (1) a 
motto for the guidance of the mother; (2) a verse with 
the accompanying music, to sing to the child; and (3) a 
picture illustrating the verse. Each song is also con- 
nected with some simple exercise, which answers to a 
special physical, mental, or moral need of the child. 
The selection and order of the songs were determined 
with reference to the child’s development, which ranges

have been largely increased in range and number. Froe- 
| bel also strove to carry out his principle of ‘development’ 
| in the order and gradation of the ‘gifts.’ They are so 
arranged as to lead from the properties or activities of one 
' to those of the next, and, while introducing new impres- 
sions, repeat the old. Every new ‘gift’ is used alter- 
nately with the old, and the use of the new makes the play 
with the old freer and more intelligent. The first ‘gift’ 
consists of a box of six woolen balls of different colors. 
They are to be rolled about in play, and thus develop ideas 
of color, material, form, motion, direction, and muscular 
| sensibility. A sphere, cube, and cylinder of hard wood 
compose the second ‘gift.’ Here, therefore, are found a 
known factor in the round sphere and an unknown one 
in the cube. A comparison is made of the stability of 
the cube with the movability of the sphere, and the two 
are harmonized in the cylinder, which possesses the 
characteristics and powers of each. The third ‘gift’ 
is a large wooden cube divided into eight equal cubes, 
thus teaching the relations of the parts to the whole and 
to one another, and making possible original construc- 
tions, such as armchairs, benches, thrones, doorways, 
monuments, or steps. The three following ‘gifts’ divide 
the cube in various ways so as to produce solid bodies of 
different types and sizes, and excite an interest in num- 
ber, relation, and form. The way is thus prepared for 
copgtructive geometry, algebra, and trigonometry, and

for artistic constructions. In addition to the six regular 
‘gifts,’ additional play with ‘tablets,’ ‘sticks,’ and ‘rings; 
sometimes known as ‘gifts’ seven to nine, was also intro

lines, and points in contrast with the preceding solids, and 
brings out the relations of area, outline, and circumference

Nature study always formed part of Froebel’s cur- 
riculum. His principles of unity and the. symbolic rev- 
elation of God in nature impelled him to introduce the 
children early to an informal study of the natural sci- 
ences. Even in the school at Keilhau+ there were con- 
tinual excursions for the study of nature. Likewise, the 
songs, games, and stories of the kindergarten are filled 
with references to natural surroundings, and the pupils 
are encouraged in their instinctive love for flowers and 
living creatures through gardening and the care of pet 
animals. These occupations satisfy their inherent crav- 
ings, call forth love, wonder, self-control, and self-sacri- 
fice, and furnish material for the development. of obser- 
vation and intelligence. The children gain a permanent 
interest in natural science, become familiarized with the 
phenomena of nature, and come to feel a communion and 
living connection with God. 
Since Froebel held to the method of ‘self-activity’ and 
creativeness’ and appealed more to individual interests, 
his idea of discipline necessarily varied from the authori- 
tative one usually imposed. He held that the principle 
to be observed was a harmony between spontaneity and 
self-control. He would have evil overcome by starva- 
tion and atrophy and by the nurture and development 
of the good. He believed that the will could thus be 
diverted without paralyzing it, and that, if bad traits

were not entirely removed, their proportion would at 
least be reduced. With him punishment was not abol- 
ished, but the necessity of it practically disappeared. 
The schooling beyond the kindergarten stage was 
never worked out by Froebel. He felt that the continuity 
and development in the life of the individual should be 
unbroken, and in the Education of Man he promises at 
some future time to consider the stages of éducation 
beyond boyhood, with which he closes there. But after 
the kindergarten was once formulated, he became com- 
pletely absorbed in the development of early childhood, 
and could not be induced for any length of time to take 
an interest in the later stages of education and the ordi- 
nary school problems. In consequence, except for a 
small effort of Froebel toward the close of his life to map 
out a course for ‘transition classes,’ no one has ever se- 
riously undertaken to bridge the gap betwe~~ *h> ?-4-~

Froebel’s Crudities, Mysticism, and Symbolism 
For one pursuing destructive criticism only, i 
not be difficult to find flaws in both the theory a1 
tice of Froebel. In fact, the defects in both his 
works, Education of Man and Mother and Play Songs, are

singularly obtrusive, if they be regarded only superficially. 
In the latter the pictures are rough and poorly drawn, 
the music is crude, the verses are difficult to memorize, 
and the arrangement and sequence seem at times to lack 
consistency. But the illustrations and songs served 
well the interests and needs of those for whom they were 
produced, and Froebel himself was not insistent that 
they should be used after more satisfactory compositions 
‘were found? He wished only to afford examples of how 
the mother might aid in the development of her child, 
and no other collection of children’s songs has ever 
been devised to compare with his in educational value. 
Similarly, the mysticism, artificiality, and even triviality 
that appear in various forms throughout the Education 
of Man bear no essential relation to his basal principles 
or his argument. In undertaking to make apparent 
and efficient at every point the fundamental law of life 
and development, Froebel often strains his principle of 
‘unity,’ and becomes most vague and fanciful. Such, 
for example, would seem to be his constant attempts to 
reveal the relationship underlying apparent conflict in 
his ‘harmonization of opposites’ and his ‘connection by

life andthe advance in knowledge and music, there is a group of Froebe-

of the master. Play Songs

contrasts.’ So symbolism is overemphasized by him, 
and is often fantastic and confusing, especially when the 
basal philosophy is not understood. Since all things live 
and have their being in and through God and the divine 
principle in each is the essence of its life, everything is 
liable to be considered by Froebel as symbolic in its 
very nature and as made by God to reveal and express 
himself. Thus with him the sphere becomes the symbol 
of diversity in unity,? the faces and edges of crystals all 
have mystic meanings? and the numbers three and 
five reveal an inner significance. At times this sym- 
bolism descends into a literal and verbal pun, where it 
seems as if Froebel can hardly be serious or is struggling 
for a suggestive system of mnemonics. Such is his ex- 
planation of the ‘ball’ as the symbol of unity, the ‘nurs- 
ling’ as a great appropriating ‘eye,’ and the ‘boy’ as one 
who strives to ‘announce’ himself.5 At times, too, 
Froebel’s mystic views and attitude on divine revelation 
make a curious and incongruous combination with his

principles, upon which they are mere excrescences. © 
Likewise, Froebel’s practical work, while at times me- 
chanical, over-schematized, and bolstered by esoteric 
; speculations, is most ingenious, and has enabled society 
to provide for a neglected and most important stage in 
| education. 
The Value of His Principles 
It is, at any rate, a most lamentable interpretation 
' that takes account only of the shortcomings of Froebel. 
e was the truest successor of Pestalozzi. Like the 
Swiss reformer, he desired a natural development of man, 
but he had a clearer and more definite comprehension 
of what this censisted in, and he greatly enlarged the 
means of accomplishing a training in keeping with it. 
Pestalozzi, through his sympathy for humanity and the 
inspiration of the moment, was interested primarily 
; in the practical aspect of educational reform, and devel- 
oped his theories afterward. Froebel, on the other hand, 
: sought to formulate general principles from his observa-

tion, make his educational method grow out of their 
application, and constantly test his generalizations by 
practical experience. While the one would teach the 
pupil to secure accurate knowledge through observation 
and to imitate, the other would enable him to train his 
senses and emotions to proper activity as a preparation 
for later knowledge and activity of a more original sort. 
Froebel has thus not only supplemented Pestalozzi, 
but is recognized as one of the first reformers to apply 
the advanced philosophy and scientific ideas of the nine- 
teenth century to education. While Froebel never 
developed his system much beyond the earliest period 
of life, his principles are suggestive of the most im- 
portant tendencies in all stages of education to-day. 
Through his ideas of ‘continuity’ and ‘development’ 
one may. more thoroughly understand the nature of 
the child and realize the central feature in all life rela- 
tions. From these principles may be derived the real 
‘purpose of education and the means and method for ac- 
‘complishing it. Thus may be secured a training adapted 
to every period of life and stage of development, furnish- 
ing the highest philosophy and the most ennobling ethical 
thought. Now that the meaning of his ‘self-activity’ 
and ‘creativeness’ is coming to be comprehended, they 
are recognized as most essential laws in the educational 
process, and are to be valued as the universal criterion 
of effective teaching. In harmony with Froebel, the  
-P-A-G-E-237
    ~ . d- 
FROEBEL AND THE KINDERGARTEN - 227 
- school is coming to be conceived as an institution in 
which to discover and work out individuality by means 
of initiative and execution; and spontaneous activities, 
like play, constructive work, and nature study, have more 
and more become the means to this end. The im- 
portance of having all instruction lead to activity as 
| directly as possible is now appreciated, and education ~ 
has been given a social, moral, and practical meaning 
throughout the learning process. Thus the implications 
( of Froebel’s system are apparent in all modern educa- 
tional theory and practice. — 
The Spread of Froebelianism through Europe 
Froebelianism and the kindergarten, then, contained 
principles that were destined to spread by virtue of their 
educational value. But their dissemination was greatly 
- facilitated after the death of Froebel by the reformer’s 
devoted followers. Froebel’s widow, Middendorf, and 
the Baroness von Biilow especially became the heirs of 
his spiritual possessions, and proceeded at once to make 
the heritage productive. Middendorf did not long sur- 
vive the master, and Frau Froebel’s part in the wide 
' evangelization was somewhat limited by her education. 
It remained for the intellectual and cultured noble- ~ 
woman, by means of her social position and knowledge 
of modern languages, to become the great apostle of ess von Bii- 
low through- Froebel throughout Europe. Shortly after his death, out Europe

from either the ministry or the king, the baroness turned 
to foreign lands. - She visited France, Belgium, Holland, 
England, Italy, Russia, and nearly every. other section of 
Europe, and the propaganda was everywhere eagerly 
embraced. In Paris she took rooms at the Louvre, 
and gave parlor lectures to audiences including the most | 
distinguished men of all religions and philosophies, who | 
accepted the Froebelian principles and system with re- 
markable unanimity. The minister of education in 
Belgium invited the baroness to Brussels, where she 
addressed numerous circles of prominent women, school 
officers, and teachers, and by means of great personal 
efforts succeeded in establishing model kindergartens 
and a journal devoted to the movement. In Holland 
she founded kindergartens at Amsterdam, the Hague, having failed to obtain a revocation of the edict in Prussia | 
      . Rotterdam, and Gueldern, and interested the minister 
of education, many school inspectors, and directors of 
schools in the maintenance of such institutions. She 
carried on a similar work in England, and popularized 
the idea throughout the British Isles; and kindergartens, 
endorsed by numerous men of repute, sprang up on all 
sides. Through her lectures in Italy a system of kinder- 
gartens was started at Naples and elsewhere, and great 
promises of support were exacted. A most noteworthy 
recognition was shown the principles she represented by 
the invitation given her to speak before the ‘Congress

of Philosophers’ at Frankfurt in 1867. This distin- 
guished gathering had been called: to inquire into con- 
temporary educational movements. As a result of the 
elucidation of Froebelianism by the baroness during four 
afternoons of the sessions, a committee of the society, 
known as the ‘Froebel Union,’ was formed to continue 
a study of the system. Among the achievements of this 
organization. was the foundation five years later of an 
institution for training kindergartners at Dresden. 
Thus, while the kindergarten was not generally adopted 
by the governments, it was widely established by volun- 
tary means throughout civilized Europe, and in all coun- 
tries the work has grown to mammoth proportions. In- 
struction in Froebelian principles is now generally re- 
quired in most normal and teacher training institutions of 
| Europe. Sometimes, as in France and England, it has

remained. The deadening effects of the ministerial de- | 
cree, despite the efforts of the heroic baroness in estab- 
lishing and encouraging kindergarten associations, hung | 
over the German states for a decade; and even since the 
removal of the ban, kindergartens have, with few ex- 
ceptions, never been recognized as real schools or part of 
the regular state system. The kindergartners are not 
subject to the requirements demanded of all other ele- 
mentary teachers, and are forbidden to touch on the for- 
mal school subjects or work of any sort that would seem 
to duplicate the primary curriculum. Even to-day the 
German kindergarten is regarded as little more than a 
day nursery or convenient place to deposit small chil- 
dren, and have them amused. The educational principles 
for which Froebel contended are not generally conceded 
in Germany! 
The Kindergarten in the United States 
The influence of the kindergarten has been more 
marked in the United States than in any other country. 
In the early sixties Elizabeth P. Peabody and others 
1 When Professor Payne of the London College of Preceptors visited 
the kindergartens in six German cities in 1874, he found that, while the 
theory was just, natural, and all-sided, the teachers were inefficient, and 
the rooms were often small, unsanitary, and ill-lighted. (See Payne,| 
Lectuyes on the History of Education, pp. 203-271.) More than a genera-| 
tion later the same general conditions seem to obtain.

became interested in accounts of Froebel’s system, and, in the United 
without a proper knowledge of the details, undertook 8 
to open kindergartens in Boston. Notwithstanding 
. the immediate success of these institutions and the evi- 
dent enjoyment of the children, Miss Peabody felt that 
she had not succeeded in getting the real principles and 
| spirit of Froebel, and in 1867 she went to study. with 
his widow, who had been settled in Hamburg for several 
years. Upon her return the following year Miss Pea- 
, body corrected the errors in her work and established a & 
periodical to explain and spread Froebelianism. The 
philanthropists, and school boards in the movement, 
and a service was done for the kindergarten in America 
almost equal to that of Baroness von Biilow in Europe. 
In 1872 Maria Bolte, afterwards the wife of Professor 
John Kraus,! who had studied with Frau Froebel, was 
induced to settle in New York, and, through her pupils 
, and those of other German kindergartners, the cause was ‘remainder of her life was spent in interesting parents, the work | 
rapidly promoted. The same year saw the beginning of” 
Susan E. Blow’s great work in St. Louis, where her free 
training school for kindergartners was opened. Two 
years later S. H. Hill of Florence, Massachusetts, started 
a munificent provision for free kindergartens in his 
vicinity, and four years after that Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw

still (x9x) living in New York City.

began establishing them at various locations in the 
neighborhood of Boston, until she was supporting at 
Jeast thirty such institutions. Many other philan- 
thropic persons became much interested, and over one 
hundred voluntary associations were soon organized to 
found and maintain kindergartens. Through the work 
‘of Emma Marwedel, who was invited to California in 
1876 by the ‘Froebel Union,’ successful training classes 
were established at Los Angeles, Oakland, and Berkeley. 
' Voluntary kindergartens were also rapidly opened, and 
there was soon organized the ‘Golden Gate Association’ 
at San Francisco, which at its height supported forty- 
one free institutions and an excellent training school. 
In Philadelphia, Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Pittsburg, 
Cincinnati, Cleveland, Washington, Baltimore, Louis- 
ville, and other centers, subscriptions were before long 
raised by the churches and other philanthropic agencies, 
and the work everywhere grew apace. 
But philanthropy and private foundations, after all, are 
restrictive, and it was not until the kindergartens began 
to be adopted by the school systems that the move- 
ment became truly national in the United States. Boston 
early added kindergartens to her public schools, but 
after several years of trial gave them up on account of 
the expense. ~The first permanent establishment under 
a city board was made in 1873 at St. Louis through the 
efforts of Miss Blow and Dr. William T. Harris, then city

superintendent of schools. Twelve kindergartens were 
organized at first, but others were opened as rapidly as 
" competent directors could be prepared at Miss Blow’s ——=—_————— 
  training school. Within a decade there were more than 
fifty public kindergartens and nearly eight thousand 
pupils in St. Louis. San Francisco authorized the incor- 
poration of kindergartens in the public schools in 1880; 
and New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Pittsburg, 
Rochester, Providence, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and most 
other progressive cities and even many smaller munici- 
palities have gradually made the work an integral part 
of their system. “At present there must be nearly two 
hundred cities that include this stage of education in their 
schools. That means a total of some fifteen hundred 
public kindergartens ! with nearly twice as many teachers 
; and fully one hundred thousand pupils. About twenty 
of the cities employ a special supervisor to inspect the 
work. Excellent training schools for kindergartners are 
also maintained by half a hundred public and quasi- 
public normal institutions. A large number of extensive 
treatises, manuals, and periodicals devoted to the sub- 
ject of kindergarten work are published, and have a wide 
circulation in every state of the Union.? 
1 The number would be nearly quadrupled by the addition of the pri- 
vate kindergartens.

dergarten in the United States is given in Susan E. Blow’s Kindergarten 
Education, pp. 1-10, under the head of ‘four sharply defined movements.’

CHAPTER XII 
LANCASTER AND BELL, AND THE MONITORIAL 
SYSTEM 
In 1798, an English Quaker, but twenty years of age, 
opened a novel type of school for the children of the poor 
in Southwark, London. The youthful teacher, whose 
name was Joseph Lancaster (1778-1838), had. come to 
feel that “the want of system and order is almost uni- 
form in every class of schools within the reach of the 
poor.” He declared, “ there is little encouragement for 
masters, parents, and scholars; and while this is the 
case, it is no wonder that ignorance prevails among the 
poor.” That this illiteracy and lack of organization 
might be overcome, he began himself to educate as many 
of the barefoot and unkempt children of the district as 
he could. His schoolroom was soon crowded with a 
hundred or more pupils, and, in order to teach them 
all, he used the older scholars as assistants. He taught 
the lesson first to these ‘monitors,’ and they in turn 
imparted it to the others, who were divided into equal 
groups. Each monitor cared for a single group. 
_ 337 To educate 
the poor in 
Southwark, 
Lancaster 
started a 
‘monitorial’ 
school.

as ‘The Brit- 
ish and For- 
eign Society.’ 238 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
Success of Monitorialism, and the Formation of the 
‘British and Foreign’ and the ‘National’ Societies 
The work was very successful from the first, and Lancas- 
ter called further attention to it in 1803 by an account 
he published under the title of Improvements in Education 
as it respects the Indusirious Classes of the Community. 
The school was twice enlarged by persons of wealth; 
many of the nobility and aristocracy came to visit the 
institution; and the king summoned Lancaster for an 
interview, and made a generous contribution for his work. 
A training school was soon opened to spread this system 
among other teachers, and Lancaster began to lecture 
on his methods throughout England and to establish 
‘monitorial’ schools everywhere. It was generally be- 
lieved that the problem of national education had at 
length been solved, and that an effective means had been 
found for educatingeveryone with little cost. Lancaster, 
however, proved most reckless, and his venture had by 
1808. phinged him into debt to the extent of six thousand 
pounds. Having rescued him from the debtors’ prison, 
certain philanthropic men of means in that year founded 
‘The Royal Lancasterian’ Institution,’ to continue the 
work on a practical basis. But within half a dozen years, 
Lancaster, who seems never fo have been able to get along 
with people, withdrew from the association and started 
a school of his own, A few years later he left England
-P-A-G-E-249
    | LANCASTER AND BELL, MONITORIAL SYSTEM 239 
for foreign lands, where he again met with failure and 
poverty, and eventually died in the city of New York, 
a disappointed man. 
Vet the organization for perpetuating his work, which 
after the withdrawal of Lancaster became known as 
‘The British and Foreign Society,’ continued to flourish 
and perform a splendid service for education. So suc- 
cessful was it that the Church of England began to fear ° 
its liberalistic influence upon education. Following the 
nonconformist attitude of its Quaker founder, the edu- 
cation of the society included religion and reading the 
Bible, but permitted no catechism or denominational } 
instruction of any sort. To most Anglican churchmen 
-such religions teaching seemed loose and colorless, and 
in 1811 ‘The National Society for Promoting the Educa- 
tion of the Poor in the Principles of the Established 
Church? was founded by them. This long-named 
association was. to use the ‘monitorial’ system, and to 
have.a Reverend Doctor Bell as its manager. Andrew 
Bell (1753-1832) had been. an army chaplain and the 
superintendent of an orphanage in India, and had the 
idea of monitorial instruction suggested to lim by the 
Hindi education. A year before. Lancaster opened his 
school, Dr: Bell had published his treatise known as 
An Experiment in Education Made at the Male Asylum 
of Madras; and. while the Quaker philanthropist began . 
his system independently, it is not unlikely that he re-_
-P-A-G-E-250
  240 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
ceived help later from Bell. Although they formed no 
part of Bell’s original methods in Madras, the catechism 
and the prayer book were now taught dogmatically in the 
schools founded by the ‘National Society,” and as Dr. 
Bell proved an admirable director, the affairs of the 
organization prospered marvelously. In consequence, a 
healthy rivalry with the older association of the Lan- 
casterians rapidly grew up. 
Differences between the Systems of Lancaster 
and Bell 
‘Monitorial’ or ‘mutual’ instruction, however, was 
not original with either Lancaster or Bell. Besides being 
used by the Hindus,! it has formed part of the Jesuit 
system of education,” and was confidently recommended 
by Comenius in his Didactica Magna’ Nevertheless, 
it was the work of Lancaster and Bell that greatly de- 
veloped the method and brought it into prominence. 
The plans of the two men, while analogous, differed 
somewhat in spirit and details. Without considering 
the methods of religious instruction, the system of Lan- 
caster was generally animated by broader motives. 
While he failed to teach certain subjects, it was simply 
because his resources were limited; but the National

Society purposely curtailed the range of its instruc- 
tion on the ground that “there is a risk of elevating 
those who are doomed to the drudgery of daily labour 
above their station, and rendering them unhappy and 
- discontented with their lot.” In the matter of details, 
both men worked out systematically the idea of instruct- 
ing through monitors, and both used a desk covered 
with sand! as a means of teaching writing; but in other 
respects Lancaster elaborated the method more than 
> Bell. By having the speller or other text printed in 
large type and suspending it from the wall, he made one 
| book serve for a whole class, or even for the entire school. 
Through the use of slates and dictation he had five hun- 
dred boys spell and write the same word at the same 
time. He arranged a new method in arithmetic whereby 
any child who could read might teach the subject with 
accuracy. Moreover, although a member of the Society 
of Friends, Lancaster introduced more military discipline 
into his system than did his rival. He believed in com- 
pany organization, drill, regimental control, precision, 
' and a prompt observance of the word of command. He 
also developed a system of badges, tickets, offices, and. 
other rewards, and, in order to avoid flogging, a set of 
punishments by which the offender was made an‘object. 
of ridicule rather than physical pain. There were also 
a number of unessential differences between the two

systems in the manner of arranging their classes. They 
likewise differéd in their method of training teachers. In 
order to acquire the Lancasterian system, a teacher was 
required to spend a week or more as a monitor in each 
of the classes from the lowest to the highest, while with 
the Bell organization he had to become an actual pupil 
in each of the grades. 
Value of the Monitorial System in England 
Neither Bell nor Lancaster deserves much praise as 
an educational reformer. Each was vain and peda- 
gogically ignorant, and saw but one side of education. 
While both societies accomplished much good at a time 
when little attention was given to instruction and less 
to the problems of education, the monitorial systems 
overemphasized repetition in the teaching process and 
treated education purely from the standpoint of rou- 
tine. The monitorial method was not real instruction, 
but a formal drill. . It had no principles and little of 
the elasticity that was apparent in the more psycho- 
logical methods of the reformers on the Continent.. The 
mechanical basis of such a system is exposed by:the arith- 
_ 1 For example, Lancaster had his pupils located in a mass at the center 
of the room, while Bell arranged their desks around the walls. The classes 
when reciting under Lancaster’s monitors consisted of ten or twelve 
standing in semicircles; Bell placed a larger number in each group and 
seated them on benches in three sides of a square.

metical boast of Lancaster. He calculated: ‘‘Each boy 
can spell one hundred words in a morning. If one hun- 
dred scholars can do that two hundred mornings yearly, 
the following will be the total of their efforts at improve- 
ment.” He then shows that there will be an annual 
achievement of two million words spelt. Similarly, in 
arithmetic he seems to hold that it is simply a question 
of the number of sums done in a given time, and not at 
all a matter of principles. 
Yet the Lancaster-Bell schools did awaken the con- 
science of the English nation to the need of general edu- 
cation for the poor, and the system emphasized the school 
as an organized community for mutual aid. ‘The societies 
afforded a substitute, though a poor one, for national

‘ 
Results of Lancasterianism in the United States 
In the United States, where complete freedom in 
religion obtained, the system of Dr. Bell and the Na- 
tional Society found little footing. The monitorial 
system in its Lancasterian form, however, was intro- 
duced into New York City in 1806. The ‘Society for 
the Establishment of a Free School,’ after investigating The Lan- 
casterian 
system was 
introduced 
into many 
cities,
-P-A-G-E-254
and did a 
where free 
schools had 
been few 244 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
the best methods in other cities and countries, decided 
to try the system of Lancaster. It spread rapidly 
through New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Con- 
necticut, and other states, and before long had in- 
fluenced nearly all cities of any size as far south as 
Charleston, and west as far as Cincinnati. In 1818 
Lancaster himself was invited to America, and assisted 
in the monitorial schools of New York, Brooklyn, and ° 
Philadelphia. A dozen years later the system began to 
be introduced into the high schools and academies, and 
for two decades it was the prevailing method in second- 
ary education. Training schools for teachers on the 
Lancasterian basis became common. 
In fact, the monitorial system was destined to perform 
a great service for American education. At the time of 
its introduction, public and free schools were generally 
lacking, outside of New England. Even in that section 
the early Puritan provision for ‘schools had largely be- 
come a dead letter, and the facilities that existed were 
meager, and available during but a small portion of the 
year. In all parts of the country illiteracy was almost 
universal among children of the poor. This’ want of 
school opportunities was rendered more serious by the 
rapid growth of American cities, which was evident even 
in the earliest part of the century, and by the consequent 
increase and concentration of ignorance, poverty, and 
crime. Societies like that in New York City, formed to
-P-A-G-E-255
ti RE RN, A 0 EM (A | AM, A A | LANCASTER. AND BELL, MONITORIAL SYSTEM 245 
study and relieve the situation, were driven to the con- 
clusion that free schools must be instituted, if the poorer 
classes were to be trained to habits of thrift and virtue. 
Because of its comparative inexpensiveness, these philan- 
thropic: associations came to regard the system of Lan- 
caster as a very godsend for their purpose. And when, 
before long, the people awoke to the crying need of public 
education, the legislators found the monitorial schools 
the cheapest way out of the difficulty, and the provision 
they made for these schools gradually prepared the way 
for the ever increasing expenditures and taxation that 
had to be made before satisfactory schools could be 
established. Hence the introduction of Lancasterianism 
may well be considered to have provided a basis for the 
substantial public support of education now universal in 
the United States. 
Moreover, the Lancasterian schools were not only 
economical, but most effective when the educational 
conditions of the times are taken into consideration. 
Even in the cities, the one-room and one-teacher school, 
which had been perpetuated from the district system, and the work 
ineffective, 
was the prevailing type, and grading was practically . 
unknown. The whole organization and administration 
was shiftless and uneconomical, and a great improve- 
ment was brought- about by the carefully planned and 
detailed methods of Lancaster. The schools were made 
over through his definite mechanics of instruction,
-P-A-G-E-256

centralized management, well-trained teachers, im- 
proved apparatus, discipline, hygiene, and other fea- 
tures. We can, then, well understand the enthusiasm 
for these new schools that is apparent in the utterances 
and writings of statesmen, educators, and other per- 
sons: of the times that felt responsible for the training 
of the people. One of the earliest and best known 
estimates is that of the governor of New York, De 
Witt Clinton, who in 1809 declared in his address at 
the dedication of the new building of the Free School 
Society : — 
“When I perceive that many boys in our school have been 
taught to read and write in two months, who did not before know 
the alphabet, and that even one has accomplished it in three weeks 
—- when I view all the bearings and tendencies of this system — 
when I contemplate the habits of order which it forms, the spirit 
of emulation which it excites, the rapid improvement which it 
produces, the purity of morals which it inculcates — when I behold 
the extraordinary union of celerity in instruction and economy of 
expense — and when I perceive one great assembly of a thousand 
children, under the eye of a single teacher, marching with un- 
_ exampled rapidity and with perfect discipline to the goal of knowl- 
edge, I confess that I recognize in Lancaster the benefactor of the 
human race. I consider his system as creating a new era in edu- 
cation, as a blessing sent down from heaven to redeem the poor 
and distressed of this world from the power and dominion of 
ignorance.” ? 
1 For Clinton’s complete eulogy of the system adopted by the Free 
School Society, of which he was president, see Bourne, History of the 
Public School Society of the City of New York, pp. 18-20.

But while the monitorial methods met a great edu- 
cational emergency in the United States, they were 
clearly mechanical, inelastic, and without psychological 
foundation. Naturally their sway could not last long, 
and as public sentiment for education increased, and 
enlarged material resources enabled the people to make 
greater appropriations for education, the obvious defects 
of the monitorial system became more fully appreciated 
and brought about its abandonment. It gave way to 
the more psychological conceptions of Pestalozzi and 
to those afterward formulated by Froebel and Herbart.

CHAPTER XIIT 
HORACE MANN AND THE AMERICAN 
EDUCATIONAL REVIVAL 
Tue close of the first half of the nineteenth century 
was distinguished by a remarkable revival in educa- 
tion throughout the United States. This awakening 
began and centered in Massachusetts, and was greatly 
strengthened by the leadership and efforts of Horace 
Mann. To appreciate the underlying causes, one must, 
therefore, learn something of the life and purposes of 
this great American educator. 
The Early Career of Horace Mann 
Horace Mann (1796-1859) was born on a small farm 
in .Franklin, Massachusetts. His parents were plain 
people, but of superior mental capacity and consider- 
he grew up also furnished an environment of unusually 
high ideals in intelligence and morals. The hard con-

quired a reverence for knowledge and books. He also 
secured much instruction and intellectual enrichment 
from the small library of his native town. While he 
reacted most strongly from the stern, uncompromising 
Calvinism of the religious life of the times, it inculcated 
in him a faith in God and a subordihation of his moral 
nature to the higher law, and he obtained through its 
system a remarkable drill in logic. At|the age of twenty, 
young Mann happened upon a brilliant preparatory 
teacher, and was speedily fitted to enter the sophomore 
class of Brown University in the fall of the same year. 
He was graduated in 1819 at the head of his class, and 
was shortly afterward engaged for two years as a tutor 
in Latin and Greek at his alma mater. After demon- 
strating extraordinary ability as a classical scholar and 
teacher, and concluding, far in advance of his times, 
that the natural sciences were much superior infeontent

Before long ‘he entered the political arena, and served 
the state in the Lower House for six years (1827-1833) 
and in the Senate for four more (1833-1837), the last 
two of which he was president of the body. A brilliant 
career as a statesman lay before him, but he retired at 
the age of forty-one to accept the secretaryship of the 
newly created State Board of Education. Through that 
office, however, he was destined to elevate education 
not only in Massachusetts, but through all the Union.

Horace Mann’s equipment for this, his real work in 
life, will readily be perceived. By heredity and early 
training he was suffused with an interest in humanity 
and all phases of philanthropy. This manifested itself 
preéminently in his efforts in behalf of education, al- 
though he was always an ardent worker for the cause 
of charity, the kindly treatment of defectives and

dependents,! temperance, anti-slavery, and all other 
forms of social improvement. An ardent belief in what 
he continually termed ‘the improvability of man’ is 
shown in all his college orations* and early public 
speeches, and his optimistic views were strengthened by 
reading the Constitution of Man by George Combe * and 
his later companionship with that high-minded exponent 
of phrenology. Mann’s early potentiality had been 
further rendered actual and shaped by the best educa- 
tion available, by constant reading and thinking, and by 
experience in writing and speaking and in practicing 
and making law. He may well be judged oversanguine 
in his faith in knowledge and education as the means 
of social advancement, and it may be that he under-

improvement and extension of public education, but it 
provided no real powers. It was obvious that the per- 
manence and influence of the Board would have to 
depend almost wholly upon the intelligence and force of 
character of its secretary, and the peculiar fitness of 
Mann can alone account for his selection. By reason 
of his efforts in behalf of educational reform, his per- 
sistent advocacy of the bill as a member of the legisla- 
ture, and his undoubted merits as an educator, a school- 
master named James G. Carter would seem to have 
been the logical man for the secretaryship. The 
teachers of the state were bitterly disappointed that 
one outside their number should have been preferred, 
but it would now appear that the choice of a broad- 
minded and philanthropic statesman was most wise. 
Mann, moreover, did not seek the place, and the sur- 
render of a fairly lucrative practice and an assured 
career for the mere pittance and the uncertainty of the 
secretaryship was no small sacrifice. Yet his only hesi- 
tation was as to his qualifications for ‘filling this high and 
responsible office,’ and his zeal to ‘adequately perform its 
duties.’ Having accepted the responsibility, he wrote the 
governor that ‘so long as I hold this office, I devote myself 
to the supremest welfare of mankind upon earth,” and, 
closing his law office, he made the memorable declaration : 
“The interests of a client are small compared with the interests of 
the next generation. Let the next generation, then, be my client,”

His Labors in Reforming Education 
During the next twelve years, as secretary of the 
State Board, Horace Mann subserved the interests of 
his accepted client most faithfully. Educational ideals 
were in sad need of expansion and democratization, and 
school organization, curricula, and methods called for 
enlargement and a complete modernization. To awaken 
the people, the new secretary at once started upon an 
educational campaign through the state,.and during 
each year of his tenure he made an annual circuit for 
this purpose. At first the reception given him was 
cold and spiritless; often after a hard journey he found 
but a handful of an audience, and upon one occasion he 
had even to sweep out the room himself and put it in 
order! Keenly as he felt this want of appreciation, 
nothing could daunt him, and these annual visits gradu- 
ally grew in interest and enthusiasm, and eventually he 
came to meet almost with ovations. Besides the regu- 
lar trips, Mann held himself subject to calls from 
everywhere, within the state and out, for educational 
meetings, lectures, and addresses; and when, after 
seven years, teachers’ institutes were introduced into

Massachusetts, he constantly served as an efficient lec- , 
turer and instructor. 
An even more effective means of disseminating Mann’s his Annuat 
teforms was found in the series of Annual Reports eee 
which he-issued from the first, and in the publication of 2*> 
his Common School Journal, begun in the second year of 
his administration. The Reports were by law to give 
information concerning existing conditions and the 
progress made in the efficiency of public education 
each-year, and to discuss the most approved organiza- 
tion, content, and methods for the common schools, in 
order to create and guide public opinion most intelli-

the great benefits to the state and the individual of a

suggestions as a whole maintain a definite point of 
. view and a connected body of practical doctrine. Some- 
times they seem commonplace, but it must be remem- 
bered that they were not so. then, and that the work of 
Mann did much to render them familiar. The last 
report contains a summary of what he had endeavored 
to accomplish and shows how all his criticism of the — 
schools had been undertaken as a conscientious duty 
and with a full realization of what the consequences to 
himself would be. The Reports were frequently written

hastily and are sometimes poorly arranged, illogical, 
and exaggerated; but the style was always forceful and 
animated, and often fervid and eloquent. They are 
the most important and enduring of his writings, and 
will ever be regarded as educational classics. While 
addressed to the State Board, they were really intended 
for the citizens of Massachusetts in general, and their 
influence was felt far beyond the confines of the state. 
They vitally affected school conditions everywhere in 
New England, and were read with great-interest in all 
parts of the United States, and even in Europe. An 
issue of eighteen thousand copies of one report was 
made for free distribution by act of the New York 
legislature, another was reprinted in Great Britain, and 
Germany translated and distributed editions of several. 
The Common School Journal, on the other hand, was 
issued semi-monthly and consisted of sixteen pages to 
each number. It was devoted to spreading information 
concerning school improvement, school law, and the pro- 
ceedings of the State Board, and it urged upon school 
officials, parents, and children their duties toward health, 
morals, and intelligence. This publication, which was 
continued by Mann during the whole of his administra- 
tion, laid him under the necessity of much writing him- 
self and of securing contributions from other educators.

number of towns and school districts through a sub-

creation and use lasted only five years, they were pro- 
ductive of an immense amount of good in creating a 
taste for proper reading and in democratizing educa- 
tion. 
. But probably the most permanent means of stimu- 
lating the revival and propagating the reforms led by 
Horace Mann was the foundation by Massachusetts of 
the first public! normal schools in this country. A 
devoted friend of Mann? offered to donate ten thou-

supply a like amount. This generous proposal was 
accepted by the legislature in 1838. It was decided to

methods of these institutions were largely influenced by

everywhere in the state, the schools, while not largely 
attended, were a great success from the start, and have 
‘been of immense service in raising the standard of 
teaching in Massachusetts and through New England? 
The arduous and unremitting labors of Mann in 
instituting and promoting the various means of school 
reform must have made the greatest inroad upon his 
time and strength. His correspondence alone, in a day 
before the general use of stenography, typewriting, or 
even fountain pens, is estimated to have averaged thirty

entire incumbency his work extended over fifteen hours 
of each day, and that he was frequently afflicted with 
insomnia for weeks.! Moreover, through all this period, 
his income did not amount to a living wage. While his 
salary was at length raised from one thousand to fifteen 
hundred dollars, no allowance was made for running his 
office and but little for traveling expenses: He paid for - 
many conventions and hundreds of copies of his Reports 
and Journal out of his own pocket. As a result, he 
was at times unable to purchase sufficiently nourishing 
food, and only the addition made to his salary by a 
wealthy admirer? kept him from want. 
The Opposition of Conservative Politicians, Schoolmen, 
and Theologians 
But the most trying obstacle that the great reformer 
had to contend with was the dense conservatism and 
bitter prejudices often animating people that he felt 
ought to have eagerly supported him in his herculean 
efforts. The Board and its secretary were for years 
violently assailed by sordid politicians, unprogressive. 
schoolmen, and sectarian preachers. Attempts were 
early made in the legislature to abolish the Board of

farm and in college, Mann was a ‘lifelong invalid,’ and that, owing to his 
official toil and want of sleep, his brain often ‘flamed like a brush-pile on a

matter can be somewhat realized. _ * See footnote 2 on p. 257. : = , He was bit-

Education or to have its duties and powers transferred 
to the governor and council, but after a fierce fight 
this type of opposition ceased. 
Mann’s controversy with the Boston schoolmasters 
was also sharp, but decisive. His Seventh Annual Report 
(1843) gave an account of his visit to foreign schools, 
especially those of Germany, and praised with great 
warmth the instruction without textbooks, the enthu- 
siastic teachers, the absence of artificial rivalry, and the 
mild discipline in the Prussian system. The report did 
not stigmatize the conservatism of the Boston schools 
or bring them into comparison with those of Berlin, 
but the cap fitted only too well. The pedagogues 
- were seriously disquieted, and proceeded to answer most 
savagely. Although not all the Boston teachers were 
opposed to the new order of things, the Principals’ 
Association through a committee of thirty-one joined 
battle by issuing their Remarks on the Seventh Annual 
Report of Hon. Horace Mann. This was a pamphlet of 
one hundred and forty-four pages, which undertook to 
vindicate the historic educational system of Massachu- 
setts, and to discredit the normal schools, libraries, 
methods, discipline, and other features of the new 
régime. The secretary straightway made a Reply of 
even greater length, and when they returned to the 
charge with a Rejoinder, he soon had an Answer ready. 
While much in Mann’s pamphlets is unfair, weak in

argument, and unnecessarily severe, he had been un- 
justly and deeply wounded, and in the main was felt 
to be right. When the smoke of battle had cleared 
away, it was seen that the leaders of the old order had 
been completely routed and had wrought their own 
destruction. 
A more insidious attack upon the broad-minded 
reformer was that led by the ultra-orthodox. The old 
schools of the Puritans with their dogmatic religious 
teaching had been steadily fading away some time before 
the new Board had been inaugurated, but the educa- 
tional revival of Mann made this fact patent for the 
first time. There was, in consequence, a tendency upon 
the part of many conscientious but narrow people to 
charge this disappearance to the reformer, whose liberal 
attitude in religion was well known. Others took ad- 
vantage of the popular clamor to vent upon Board and 
secretary the spleen which for various reasons they had 
accumulated against them. The assault, which cul- 
minated with articles in the sectarian press and with 
polemic sermons, was vigorously and successfully re- 
1In fact, the prominence that this controversy gavé him as the apostle 
of reform was the making of Mann’s reputation as a great educator.

pelled by the secretary and others, including many of 
the more sensible orthodox people. Mann throughout 
the contest consistently maintained that the Bible 
should be read in the public schools, but without com- 
ment, and thus became the first educator of prominence 
to attempt an adjustment of the relations of state and 
church. 
His After Life in Congress and at Antioch College 
In 1848 Mann resigned the secretaryship of the 
Board to enter Congress as an eloquent opponent to the 
extension of slavery.! While his subsequent life reveals 
the same high moral and philanthropic principles, his 
efforts after leaving the secretaryship do not especially 
concern us here. In 1853 he retired from active politics, 
and, in the hope of furthering certain advanced ideals 
that he held for higher education, he undertook the 
presidenicy. of Antioch College at Yellow Springs, Ohio. 
The strain of building up the new institution, in addi- 
tion to exhausting labors for many years, resulted in 
his death at the age of sixty-three. Until the end he 
reasoned earnestly with those he had summoned for 
counsel to his deathbed concerning ‘truth, God, man, 
and duty.’ 
1 After a most insistent demand on the part of his fellow-citizens, he 
entered Congress to fill out the unexpired term of John Quincy Adams, and 
was twice reélected. x

Thus passed a great soul whose influence would have

| the common schools. His general positions and specific 
fecommendations concerning education may easily be 
gathered from his Lectures, Reports, and Common School 
Journal. A brief interpretative summary may give 
| some idea of their purport and range. First and fore- 
| most he held that education should be universal and 
free. “I believe,” he says, “in the existence of a great 
; immortal, immutable principle of natural law, a prin- 
dple‘ of divine origin, clearly legible in the ways of 
  every human being that comes into the world.” Girls 
should be trained as well as boys, and the poor should 
have the same opportunities as the rich. Public schools 
should afford education of such a quality that .the lieved ina 
universal

the highest 
wealthy would not patronize private institutions because . Providence — the absolute right to an education of 
of their superiority. And as Mann’s reforms advanced, 
he took great pride in the fact that “more and more of _ 
the children of the Commonwealth are educated together 
under the same roof, on the same seats, with the same 
' €hcouragement, rewards, punishments, and to the ex- 
| dusion of adventitious and artificial distinctions. ”

ciency, 
.- ‘The material

attention. 264 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
This universal education, however, should have as its 
chief aim moral character and social efficiency, and not 
mere erudition, culture, and accomplishments. “No 
amount of intellectual attainments,” in Mann’s judg- 
ment, “can afford a guaranty for the moral rectitude of 
the possessor.” But while the public school should 
cultivate a moral and religious spirit, this could not be 
accomplished, he felt, by inculcating sectarian doctrines. 
The main objection urged to the private school system 
in his First Report was its tendency “to assimilate our 
modes of education to those of England, where Church- 
men and Dissenters, each sect according to its creed, 
maintain separate schools in which children are taught 
from their tenderest years to wield the sword of polem- 
ics with fatal dexterity; and where the Gospel, in- 
stead of being a temple of peace, is converted into an 
armory of deadly weapons for social interminable war- 
fare.” 
His Improvement of Material Equipment and of 
Methods 
' This practical reformer likewise gave much attention 
to the material side of education. He declared that 
school buildings should be well constructed and sanitary. 
This matter seemed to him so important that he wrote 
a special report upon the subject during his first year 
in office. He carefully discussed the proper plans for

1 rooms, ventilation, lighting, seating, and other school- 
| house features, and insisted that the inadequate and 
J. squalid conditions that were existing should be im- 
| proved. In his Fourth Report also he considered many 
- of the physical evils, especially those arising from pupils 
of all ages being in the same room. He found that in 
“many cases this was the result of a multiplication of 
districts, and suggested union schools or consolidation as 
| a remedy. 
Instruction in the schools, he maintained, should be 
based upon scientific principles, and not authority and 
tradition. “Some teachers,” said he, ‘will teach only 
from the bo from which they themselves learned. 
This would fcteate an hereditary descent of books, and 
the line would be immortal.” And elsewhere he insists, 
“No one is so poor in resources for difficult emergencies 
| as they may arise as he whose knowledge of methods is 
| limited to the one by which he happened to be in- 
structed.” Pestalozzi’s inductive method of teaching. 
received his approval, for he felt that the pupils should 
be introduced at first-hand to the facts of the humani- 
ties and sciences. The work should be guided by able 
teachers, who had been trained in a normal school, and 
should be imparted in a spirit of mildness and kindness 
, through an understanding of child nature. The teachers,

only a little more than half that number? Among far.

veying; and among seekers after intellectual and moral truth, 
why should rhetoric have double the followers of logic?” 
Similarly, he holds that of all subjects, except 
‘rudiments, physiology should receive the mc:

His Missionary Spirit and Its Achievements 
In order that these various ideals might be realized, 
| Mann insisted frequently that the state should spare no 
j aber or expense. “A patriot,” to his mind, “is known 
by the interest he takes in the common schools.” But 
in a republic he felt that “education can never be at- 
tained without the consent: of the whole people. Com- 
ot 1 if it were desirable, is not an available 
Enlightenment, not coercion, is our re- 
: nature of education must be explained.” 
clares elsewhere, “All improvements in the 
‘se and require a: corresponding and simul- 
wrovement in public sentiment.” It was 
ation of ideals, effort, and expenditure that 
n sought, and for which he began his great 
ft crusade. He was a man of action, and not a philosopher. 
He had no deep thoughts on the problems of education, 
‘and not much insight into its nature beyond a dim 
notion gained from phrenology ' that there were certain 
great ‘laws’ in man’s nature which would furnish a 
plan for education and moral reform. Most of his im-

; as Gall, Spurzheim, Combe, and, later, 0. S. Fowler, show the standing 
| of the subject then. Their theory of a localization of brain functions 
. isnow accepted by psychology in a general way, just as their contention

Mann proved most effective, and resulted in more sys- 
tematic reports and great improvements in the training 
‘of teachers, material equipment, courses, textbooks, 
methods, and discipline throughout New England. 
Other states caught the enthusiasm’ along various lines. 
New York, which had been training its teachers through 
facilities in some of the academies, started a regular 
normal school, greatly improved its supervision, and 
finally separated the state superintendency of schools 
from the office of the secretary of states Farther west, 
progress was made pari passu with” “the settlement of 
the country. Early in the secretaryship of Mann, Ohio 
established a state superintendency and an advanced 
set of school laws, and Michigan and other states made 
ample provision for their systems of common schools. 
A regular yt of the state schools, with a 
central authority“of some sort, rapidly followed every- 
career as an educator, and greatly supplemented Mann’s work. He 
served as Secretary of the Board of School Commissioners in Connec- 
ticut (1838-1842), as School Commissioner of Rhode Island (1843- 
1849), and Superintendent of Schools for Connecticut (1850-1854). 
Later (1867-1870) he became the first United States Commissioner of 
Education. He expended a fortune in getting out the volumes of his 
monumental American Journal of Education (1855-1872), which has been 
“the greatest mine of information in existence upon educational history, 
theory, and practice. Owing to the overshadowing importance attached 
to the great educational fight made by Mann, whose service for the com- 
mon schools was,: after all, comparatively brief, Henry Barnard has re- 
ceived altogether too little recognition.

Thus by the force of example the influence of Horace

resulting from his work were recognized even in several 
states of Europe. Many articles and books upon this

‘The natural 
Spencer was 
eared amid CHAPTER XIV 
HERBERT SPENCER AND THE RELATIVE VALUE 
OF STUDIES 
Tue latter half of the nineteenth century witnessed a 
great development in the natural sciences and in the part 
they should play in the curricula of various educational 
institutions. At the beginning of this period, Greek and 
Latin had everywhere an almost unbroken monopoly 
in secondary and higher education, and stubbornly re- 
sisted the admission of any training in science; while, 
by the close of the century, not only was the power of the 
_ Classical fetish greatly diminished, but a constant struggle 
and a complete revision of methods to maintain these 
subjects at all had become necessary. This general 
change. of attitude grew largely out of the material 
development of the times, the increasing popularity of 
evolutionary doctrine, and the work of the educational 
reformers that had preceded. But while it was in the 
spirit of the times, it was first crystallized and defended 
by the English philosopher, Spencer. 
Spencer’s Education and Other Writings 
Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) was the descendant of 
educators, and during all his youth was surrounded by 
° 274 :
-P-A-G-E-285
SPENCER AND RELATIVE VALUE OF STUDIES 275 
otellectual and literary traditions. He never went to 
he university, possibly on account of the poor health 
tom .which he suffered all his life, but he engaged in a 
vide range of miscellaneous studies at home. He began 
arly to read on natural science and mathematics, per- 
orm experiments and make inventions, and show remark- 
ble ability in working out original problems. In his 
‘roung manhood he wrote on economic and social sub- 
ects with great force and clearness. By the time he was 
hirty he had produced his Social Statics, in which he 
teats the evolution of society through natural laws, and 
luring the next quarter of a century he devoted himself 
0 a systematic development of his ideas. He elaborated 
nd applied the laws of evolution to important questions 
a biology, psychology, ethics, politics, and sociology, 
nd issued a monumental series of works. During his 
‘thirties he also worked out his ideas on education with 
smuch enthusiasm. His treatises were originally con- 
tributions to magazines, but in 1860 they were collected 
and published in book form as Education, Intellectual, 
Moral, and Physical. 
“What Knowledge Is of the Most Worth?” 
Spencer did not read widely upon educational subjects, 
and his conceptions are largely his own, but in his Edy- traditions, 
and early 
showed an 
interest in 
At forty he

his treatise 
on Educa- 
tion, 
sation he has apparently been affected by the atmosphere | 
of the times, and has combined with his principles some

of the ideas previously expressed by Rousseau, Pestalozzi, 
and Herbart. Of the four essays in the book, the firs 
has been by far the most influential, and called forth th: 
greatest amount of comment. This part of the work, 
which seeks to investigate What Knowledge Is of Most 
Worth, raises the whole question of the purpose of educa- 
tion, and is completely subversive of the old classical 
traditions. Spencer’s argument runs as follows: ! — 
“In order of time decoration precedes dress. And in our 
universities and schools at the present moment the likéFintithesis 
holds. As the Orinoco Indian puts on his paint before leaving 
his hut, not with a view to any direct benefit, but because he 
would be ashamed to be seen without it; so a boy’s drilling in 
Latin and Greek is insisted on, not because of their intrinsic 
value, but that he may not be disgraced by being found ignorant 
of them. The comparative worths of different kinds of knowl- 
edge have been as yet scarcely even discussed — much less dis- 
‘cussed in a methodic way with definite results. Before there 
can bea rational curriculum, we must decide which things it 
most concerns us to know. To this end, a measure of ‘value is 
the first requisite. How to live ? —that is the essential question for 
us. Not how to live in the mere material sense only, but ingthe 
" widest sense. To prepare us for complete living is the function 
which éducation has to discharge; and the only rational mode of 
judging of any educational course is, to judge in what degree it 
discharges such function. Our first step must obviously be to 
classify, in the order of their importance, the leading kinds of 
activity which constitute human life. They may be arranged 
into: 1. Those activities which directly minister to self-preserva- 
1 In the quotation everything not essential to the argument is omitted. 
.
-P-A-G-E-287
a SPENCER AND RELATIVE VALUE OF STUDIES 277 
tion; 2. Those activities which, by securing the necessaries of 
life, indirectly minister to self-preservation; 3. Those activities 
which have for their end the rearing and discipline of offspring ; 
4: Those activities which are involved in the maintenance of 
proper social and political relations; 5. Those miscellaneous 
activities which make up the leisure part of life, devoted to the 
gratification of the tastes and feelings. We do not mean that 
these divisions are definitely separable. We do not deny that 
they are intrinsically entangled with each other in such way 
that there can be no training for any that is not in some measure 
a training for all. Nor do we question that of each division 
there ardportions more important than certain portions of the 
preceding divisions. But after making all qualifications, there 
still remain these broadly marked divisions; and these divisions 
subordinate one another in the foregoing order. The ideal of 
education is complete ‘preparation in all these divisions. But 
failing this ideal, as in our phase of civilization every one must 
do- more or less, the aim should be to maintain a due proportion 
between the degrees of preparation in each, greatest where the 
value is greatest, less where the value is less, least where the value 
is least.” 
The ‘Sciences’ Most Useful in All Life Activities 
Applying this test, Spencer finds that a knowledge of 
the sciences is always most useful in life, and therefore of 
most worth. He considers each one of the five groups 
of activities and demonstrates the need of the knowledge 
of some science or sciences to guide it rightly. An ac- 
quaintance with physiology is necessary to the mainte- 
nance of héalth, and so for self-preservation; any form 
of industry or other means of indirect self-preservation and holds 
that a knowl- 
edge of the 
sciences is a 
most valu- 
able prepa- 
ration for 
each,

will require some understanding of mathematics, physics, 
chemistry, biology, and sociology; to care for the physi- 
cal, intellectual, and moral training of their children, 
parents should know the general principles of physiology, 
psychology, and ethics; a man is best fitted for citizen- 
‘ship through a knowledge of the science of history in its| 
political, economic, and social aspects; and even the 
zsthetic or leisure side of life depends upon physiology, 
mechanics, and psychology as a basis for art, music, and 
poetry, and ‘“‘science opens up realms of poetryewhere to 
the unscientific all is a blank.” ! 
Besides the This argument for the sciences on the ground that their 
Seen. aso ‘content’ is so much ‘superior for the activities of hfe 
at ne would seem to be sufficient. But Spencer now shifts his 
aes whole point of view, and attempts to anticipate the de- 
: seein fense of the classics on the score of ‘formal discipline’ 
by meeting them on their own ground. He admits that 
“besides its use for guidance in conduct, the acquisition 
of each order of facts has also its use as mental exercise, 
and its effects as a preparative for complete living have 
to be considered under both these heads.” But he holds 
that by “the beautiful economy of Nature those classes 
of facts ‘which are most useful for regulating conduct are 
best for strengthening the mental faculties, and the edu- judgment, and‘morals, 
1 Spencer even undertakes to show that a systematic knowledge of 
facts and the laws of science in the physical and psychological worlds is 
essential to the best esthetic production and enjoyment.
-P-A-G-E-289
SPENCER AND RELATIVE VALUE OF STUDIES. 279 
tation of most value for guidance must at the same time 
be the education of most value for discipline.” As evi- 
dence of this, he undertakes to show that science, like 
lnguage, trains the memory, and in addition exercises 
the understanding; that it is superior to language in 
cultivating judgment; that, by fostering independence, 
perseverance, and sincerity, it furnishes a moral disci- 
pline; and even that science, ‘inasmuch asit generates a 
profound respect for, and an implicit faith in, those uni- 
form laws which underlie all things,” is the best disci- 
pline for religious culture. Hence, from the point: of 
View of formal discipline and mental gymnastics, as well 
as of content and guidance, Spencer declares science, 
tather than language and literature, to be of most worth 
in education. 
These educational conclusions of-Spencer seem to in- 
volve a complete reversal of the Renaissance, and they 
certainly called for a loosening of the traditional hold of 
the classics upon England. Instead of Greek and Latin- 
for ‘culture’ and ‘discipline,’ and an order of society 
where the few were educated for a life of elegant leisure, 
this English philosopher advocated the ‘sciences’ and a 
new scheme of life where every one should enjoy all 
advantages in the order of their relative value. We 
should, however, note the fallacy in his use of the word 
‘science.’ With Spencer this term denotes the social, 
Political, and moral sciences, as well as the physical and

the same underlying principle and may be equated with 
the ‘practical’ of Kant or the ‘esthetic’ of Herbart. 
The ‘science’ with which he would replace the tradi- 
tional humanistic studies contributes to moral values. 
It should elevate conduct, and make life pleasanter, 
nobler, and more effective. 
His argument for the superiority of the sciences in 
disciplinary value, however, is unfortunate. There was 
no need of his accepting that point of view at all; and, in 
doing so, he shows that he is not altogether emancipated 
from tradition, and that he has not fully grasped the dis- 
dplinary claims of language, which he bases entirely upon 
memory training. He likewise begs the question in 
stating that nature is bound, as a matter of economy, to 
make the training that is best for guidance also the best 
for discipline. As a matter of fact, nothing is more un- 
economical than nature, which always produces a super- 
abundance, on the principle that much will necessarily 
be wasted. : 
Essays upon ‘Intellectual,’ ‘Moral,’ and ‘ Physical 
Education’ 
The second essay in Spencer’s work is entitled Intel- 
lectual Education, and deals largely with his ideas on 
method. In the first place, he insists, with Pestalozzi, 
“that education must conform to the natural process of 
evolution.” He criticizes the methods of the time, and His argu- 
ment for the 
‘disciplinary’ 
value of the 
sciences is, , 
however, 
traditional, 
and 
his ‘economy 
of nature’ 
begs the 
question.

      282 GREAT EDUCATORS OF THREE CENTURIES 
undertakes to state his guiding principles in logical ord 
as follows: “x. In education we should proceed from th 
simple to the complex. 2. Our lessons ought to stat 
from the concrete and end in the abstract. 3. The edu, 
cation of the child must accord both in mode 
arrangement with the education of man considered hi 
torically. 4. In each branch of instruction we shoul 
proceed from the empirical to the rational. 5. Th 
process of self-development should be encouraged to the 
fullest extent. 6. There is always a method productive 
of interest, and this is the method proved by all c 
tests to be the right one.” These principles, whicl 
exemplifies by applying them to various studies, are 
strikingly similar to some already formulated by Pesta- 
lozzi, Herbart, and Froebel. 
No greater originality is displayed in his ess

training, he criticizes the existing control by 
tradition, and harshness, and insists upon inhibition, 
repression, and elimination of the natural ‘evil impulses’! 
as‘ the ‘guiding principle of moral education.’ But 
while he does not agree with Rousseau that thi 
by nature good,! he does indorse that writer’s 
of punishing through ‘natural consequences.’? In the 
1Jn fact, despite his rejection of the old ‘natural depravity’ theory of 
the theologians, he holds, like Locke, a most unfavorable view of child- 
. mature, and declares that “as the child’s features resemble those of the 
savage, so, too, do his instincts,” : 2 See p. 89.
-P-A-G-E-293
} SPENCER AND RELATIVE VALUE OF STUDIES 283 
matter of physical training, he holds that the first req- 
uisite to success in life is to be a good animal. He insists 
upon the preservation of health as a duty, and discusses 
most sensibly the proper food, clothing, exercise, and play 
{ for the boy and girl. Excessive study, he declares, should 
be avoided as fatal to happiness, and he would make but | 
little use of set exercise, on the ground that it is artificial. 
Influence of Spencer 
Obviously, except for his definition of the aim of edu- 
cation and his test of the relative value of studies, there is 
little that is really original in Spencer. Yet his way of 
combining Rousseau, Pestalozzi, and other reformers 
‘was new, and gave a basis of solidity, practicality, and 
common sense to these educators. Herbert Spencer was 
probably one of the greatest minds the world has ever 
known. He was without question the one great English 
philosopher of the nineteenth century and the only educa- 
tional writer of that country to make much impression 
upon the times. His treatise has been translated into 
thirteen languages and has influenced all parts of the 
civilized world. It has ever since given the sciences a 
standing that has assured them of complete recognition 
in the curriculum, and it is one of the most important 
works ever written in English. Spencer thus 
worked out 
the relative 
value of 
studies and 
made a sen- 
sible combi- 
nation of the } 
theoretical 
reformers. 
He was the 
only English 
educational- 
ist to make 
much im- 
pression on 
the nine- 
teenth cen- 
tury.

A History of Education before 
the Middle Ages 
BY 
FRANK PIERREPONT GRAVES, Px.D. 
Professor of the History of Education in the Ohio State University 
Cloth, 12mo, $1.10 
This book gives a comprehensive account of the history of education 
before the day of the monastic schools. It presents sufficient material 
to mark the most significant movements and discloses the underlying 
principles without entering into unnecessary detail. All interpretations 
are based upon historical data collected from the sources, and direct 
quotation is liberally used throughout. 
“ Professor Graves has taken the method of procedure, at once most natural 
and most philosophical, of studying each stage with a view to progress.” 
— The Outlook. 
“A book which gives evidence on every page of ripe scholarship, breadth 
of view, and keen discrimination between significant things and mere detail.” 
— The School Review, 
“Professor Graves does well to give the profession the fruit of his abundant 
knowledge in a scholarly text-book and reference work, complete without be- 
ing tedious, condensed without being lifeless.” — Journal of Education.

le need of such work is evidenced: By the great mass of varied educa- 
tional literature showing an equal range in educational practice and the- 
| ory; by the growing importance of the,school as a social institution, and 
the fuller recognition of education as a social process; and by the great 
increase in the number of teachers and the instability of tenure which at 
the same time marks the profession. 
© men who need it are: All teachers, professional men, editors, minis- 
ters, legislators, all public men who deal with large questions of public 
welfare intimately connected with education — every one who appreciates 
the value of a reference work which will give him the outlines of any ed- 
ucational problem, the suggested solutions, the statistical information,

F EDUCATION 
: By PAUL MONROE 
Professor of the History of Education, Teachers College, 
Columbia University 
Cloth. Crown. 800. xxiii + 772 pages. $1.90 
| The aim of this book is to emphasize the great typical educational movements thought and practice, and to give the student very definite conceptions of com- tively few leaders rather than to treat a multiplicity of more or less unrelated cts and a multitude of men with diverse ideas. In each general topic treated, enough material is given to elucidate the main characteristics. The contributions f two or three of the most representative men are discussed for the same pur- jose. Since the restrictions of space and the working plan of the author forbid further elaboration, the text at almost every point is suggestive rather than ex- haustively conclusive. A selected bibliography and a series of questions or sug- gestive topics accompany each chapter, to assist the student in further study. 
Chronological tables are given in connection with the more important historical periods, so that the student may get a conspectus of the period under considera-. tion, and the relation of the educational to other aspects of historical develop- 
jment. A detailed analysis of the book aids in preserving a correct perspective 
land the proper relationship between the various topics. The numerous illustra- 
tions add a realistic touch to the discussion of the more practical aspects of the 
subject.

This condensation of 4 Text-Book in the History of Education has been pre- 
pared to meet the demands of normal and training schools and of those colleges 
that have not sufficient time at their disposal to master the contents of a larger 
text. While the text at every point aims to be suggestive rather than exhaustive, 
even in this abbreviated form the volume contains more material than most other 
texts on the subject. The methods of presentation are the same as in the larger

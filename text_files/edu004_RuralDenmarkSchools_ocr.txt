    PREFACE 
Rurat life in our country is undergoing a most remark- 
able—though very natural—transition. The day of pio- 
neering is at an end, and the period of land exploitation, in 
the midst of which we have been living, is likely to yield 
soon to genuine husbandman farming. Indeed, new adjust- 
ments in national life are forcing the changes upon us. We 
must either become a nation of scientific producers from the 
soil or we shall soon find ourselves reduced to the condition 
of older nations whose civilization has long suffered from the 
effects of diminishing returns. The United States is no 
longer solely agricultural. In fact, we are to-day half agri- 
cultural and half industrial, and our organized industrial cen- 
ters will probably continue to outgrow the rural communities. 
The immediate proof of our unbalanced national life can 
be seen in the fact that the agricultural production does not 
any longer keep pace with the demands made upon it. The 
Federal Census for 1919 shows that in the ten years from 
1899 to 1909 agricultural production in the United States _ 
increased less than 1o per cent, while the population in- 
creased all of 21 per cent. The American boast has been 
that we can feed the world. And yet, during the past year 
our imports in meat products have far exceeded the exports. 
To be exact, on the basis of the Census of 1910 and the 
vii

  vill PREFACE 
estimated population in 1914, American farms are short 
18,259,000 meat animals to put the country in the same 
condition as regards its meat supply as it was in r1gro. 
During the decennium the United States’ exports of food- 
stuffs fell from $251,000,000 to $136,000,000 and the imports 
of foodstuffs showed an increase of $13,000,000. In spite 
of our enormous area of arable land and favorable natural 
conditions, the United States has come face to face with the 
question of how to feed its increasing millions. 
From this it will appear that the great problem of Ameri- 
can rural life is tied up closely with agricultural production. 
It is not so much a question with us of a largely increased 
number of producers —although this, too, is desirable — 
as it is a question of a largely increased production. Soil 
exploitation must be put to an end and scientific agriculture 
given its rightful day. Thinkers generally are becoming 
aware that one of our greatest national sins is this soil 
exhaustion that is actually threatening to undermine the 
greatest of all our heritages. How to change the prevailing 
indifferent system of agriculture is right at the bottom of the 
whole matter. 
Two things, at least, should receive our serious considera- 
tion; viz., to till the soil so scientifically that our agricul- 
turists may get better returns on their capital and labor 
expended than they have been getting; and to make country 
life so attractive and wholesome that our farm population 
shall be eager to spend their lives in the open country in- 
stead of, as so many are doing at this time, leaving the farm 
just as soon as they have laid by a small competence and 
moving to the country villages and larger towns where many

retire from active life, thereby adding little or nothing to the 
sum total of the productiveness of these centers. 
“The factors in this agricultural reorganization are natu- 
rally many, but none is greater than the educational factor. 
Before much improvement can be made, rural communities 
must set up a leadership of their own, such as is now seldom 
found there. The demand is for men and women imbued 
with the spirit of masterful action and thoroughly prepared 
to cope with the difficulties of present-day agricultural life. 
Properly directed education can best furnish this leadership. 
If we have educated men and women, the other great prob- 
lems cannot resist solution. The farmers will then come to 
realize with Moses that the soil is holy, and that to treat it 
properly they must put back into it at least as much as they 
take out of it year by year. The right kind of education will 
help the farmers to become organized and so enable them to 
hold their own against the centralized interests of city life. 
In fact, every phase of social, economic, and spiritual retar- 
dation in agricultural districts may be expected to yield to 
such a new educated leadership. 
A number of real farm community schools are beginning 
to spring up here and there over the length and breadth of 
our country, which are making themselves felt in this agri- 
cultural reorganization. But all this is just a beginning. 
Our rural schools, as a whole, have been unusually slow to 
find their bearing in the new transition, and many of them 
have become retarded in the process and have dropped out 
of the vanguard of progress so that they may justly be 
blamed for much of our ineffective agriculture and the mov- 
ing away from the land.
-P-A-G-E-12
  bs PREFACE 
American people, naturally enough, would not care to 
transplant to western shores the school systems of Europe 
—nor would this be either practicable or desirable. But 
we should be willing to profit by whatever is good in the 
older systems of the long-established agricultural nations. 
With this in view the story of rural Denmark and its schools 
is written. 
Denmark found itself in dire distress, both of political and 
social-economic nature. The discredited country sought the 
panacea for its ills in a remarkable school system which 
furnishes a broad culture and thorough technical preparation 
to every man, woman, and child living in its rural districts. 
The results have been marvelous. A war-crippled and al- 
most bankrupt nation has, within two generations, taken an 
honorable place among the producing nations of Europe. 
Its agriculture is unexcelled, both as to the matter of pro- 
duction from the soil and distribution of the manufactured 
products to the markets of the world. 
The story of Denmark is told in these pages because the 
writer sincerely believes that many of the blessings that 
have come to Denmark through its schools can be ours if 
we. take heed of some of the things that we, in our greater 
industrial hurry, neglect ; but which to the Danes have held 
the key to all success. This need not call for any violent 
reorganization of the schools as they now exist. It would 
face them more directly towards the soil and give them a 
new spiritual uplift; and it would, at one and the same 
time, provide the broadest kind of culture and supply the 
required technical skill for scientific farming.

THE RECENT DANISH AGRICULTURAL 
REHABILITATION 
CHAPTER I 
RuraL DEVELOPMENT DURING RECENT YEARS 
The Land and the People. — Denmark is a very small 
country, embracing, all told, less-than-15,000..square 
miles. It is cut by sinuous arms of the ocean which have 
left it one prominent peninsula and more than 500 
islands, some of which are mere sand bars of little eco- 
nomic value. The small kingdom has considerably less 
than one half the area of Maine, and about one eight- 
eenth the area of Texas. The country forms a part of 
the North-European Lowland and is marked for its 
low rise above sea level. Indeed, the average elevation 
is only about ninety-five feet. The surface soil is, on 
the whole, light and in some regions very poor. It com-

prises, in the main, moraine clays, strong in lime and 
mixed with pebbles, with here and there moraine sands ; 
and in central Jutland, great stretches of heather sands 
belonging to the Glacial Period. Of more recent origin 
are the peat bogs common to most of the islands, the 
marshlands rising out of the sea at Ribe, and the sand 
formations heaped up along the northwestern shore of 
Jutland. 
Taken as a whole, nature has treated Denmark in a 
stepmotherly fashion so far as riches of soil are con- 
cerned. The fact that the country is producing great 
crops from the land is not because of any fresh, virgin 
fertility or other natural resource; but because of the 
application of a broad, general intelligence to the work 
of building up a naturally meager soil, forcing it to pro- 
duce more and more. 
The climate, while never extremely cold, is raw and 
inhospitable the greater part of the year. This is due 
to the damp and chilly winds which blow almost inces- 
santly from the ocean. The average annual precipi- 
tation is 24.94 inches. Fog prevails ninety-four days 
out of the year, and Copenhagen — in a favored loca- 
tion — has only fifty days of sunshine annually! As 
a result of this it is often difficult to harvest the crops, 
and the cattle must be stall fed nine months out of the 
year. 
This much handicapped land has waged a mighty

to come. This is jnevitable. At the same time, this 
growth should not be at the expense of the country 
districts. We should so organize our agricultural 
affairs that American rural districts might hereafter re- 
tain a majority of the rural-minded people who now 
live upon the soil as well as their natural increase 
from year to year. This would mean the gradual or- 
ganization of a natural agricultural population, capa- 
ble of greatly increased production. Then would cease 
the beguiling call of “ back to the land” of those who 
have already moved away from the land, and who 
had just as well stay away because they are not by 
nature rural minded. 
A Marked Reclamation Service. — The fact that the 
cityward tide has been stemmed in Denmark indicates 
that a larger degree of prosperity and contentment is 
coming to rural communities. As a matter of fact, the 
old Denmark is being made anew by the industry of 
man. The sand dunes that have been heaped up by the 
North Sea along the western shore of Jutland are being 
checked in their inland drift. Great windbreaks of pine 
and spruce are beginning to check the force of the north- 
west winds. Vast plantations of evergreens and decidu- 
ous trees are reclaiming the heather regions at the heart 
of Jutland, where nothing save ling could grow before. 
The very waters from the inland bogs are utilized to 
irrigate the dry upland heath and turn it into productive

  RURAL DEVELOPMENT DURING RECENT YEARS ae 
meadow. Everywhere the fields and meadows are kept 
in a high state of production through careful tilling and 
fertilization. All barnyard manures are carefully hus- 
banded and utilized. Great quantities of marl are dug 
at great labor from deep beds and sprinkled over the 
fields. Rock phosphates from the United States and 
elsewhere are also used to coax the soil to produce. 
Great macadamized turnpikes have drawn the farmsteads 
_close to the markets and made the large traffic in raw 
materials from farm to town possible and convenient. 
Free rural delivery and parcels post have long since 
become indispensable. Rural telephones are common, 
and in many regions the farm homes and farm schools 
are lighted with electricity generated by wind power. 
Remarkable Growth of Codperative Enterprise. — 
To produce much from the soil is but one side of agricul- 
ture; to be able to take these products and place them 
upon the world markets to the best advantage is quite 
another matter. But the Danish farmer has solved 
both the production and the distribution sides of his ag- 
riculture. In the first place, as will be shown later, the 
schools, and especially the folk high schools, teach a 
mutual trust and confidence which have made possible 
this remarkable development in codperative enterprise. 
And no one thing has played a greater part in the agri- 
cultural prosperity than the spirit of codperation which 
prevails on every side.
-P-A-G-E-26
  8 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
More than one thousand and four hundred codperative 
stores with several hundred thousand members sell more 
than $20,000,000 worth of goods annually. In addition, 
many scores of societies are formed for the joint purchas- 
ing of feeding stuffs, fertilizers, and such materials, and 
tools. The selling associations are organized on plans, 
in many respects, like those that govern the English 
Rochdale system of stores. 
The coéperative dairies and cheese factories were the 
first to give Danish farm industries a name abroad. The 
first codperative dairy was started as late as 1882. At 
the beginning of 1913, no less than eleven hundred and 
eighty-eight such codperative plants were busily at 
work. To those may be added three hundred and 
twenty-eight private dairies, which makes the total num- 
ber fifteen hundred and sixteen. About 2,700,000,000 
kilograms of milk, making fully 96,500,000 kilograms of 
butter, are handled in the codperative plants. One dairy 
alone — “ Trifolium ” at Haslev, Zealand — receives the 
milk from 12,000 cows, treating at least 28,500,000 kilo- 
grams of milk. Forty thousand cheeses of fifty varieties 
are usually stored in the curing cellars of the dairy, which, 
if put end to end, would cover fully thirteen miles. 
The small kingdom boasts sixty-four well-established 
bacon-factories of-which forty-two-are codperative and 
managed by the farmers themselves. Practically every 
farmer belongs to one or another of these enterprises.  
-P-A-G-E-27
  
RURAL DEVELOPMENT DURING RECENT YEARS 9 
It matters not whether he is a small holder and produces 
only half a dozen pigs a year, or is a big estate owner with 
his three or four hundred. Last year about 2,000,000 
pigs were slaughtered in the codperative bacon factories, 
representing a value of fully $31,000,000. This does 
not take into consideration the slaughtering of beef 
cattle, which is quite a side industry. Every pig killed 
for export is carefully inspected by government veter- 
inarians and must-be absolutely free from every trace 
of disease, or it cannot receive the red government export 
stamp. This bacon is sold on the English markets in 
successful competition with the products of the Western 
Hemisphere. All this work of preparing the pork prod- 
ucts for the markets, from raising the pig to selling it 
in London, is done by farmers trained in special courses 
in the rural schools. 
Even the exportation of eggs has been organized as a 
powerful codperative enterprise. This began in 1895 and 
is now carried on from five hundred gathering centers. 
Danish eggs control remarkably high prices abroad 
because they are scientifically handled and sold under 
absolute guarantee of being fresh. This is made possi- 
ble by the branding system in vogue, and the severe 
regulations under which the eggs are gathered, candled, 
and packed. 
Control Unions and Government Breeding Centers. — 
Agricultural effort is systematized and kept at a high

point of perfection by an army of control union assistants 
or local agricultural experts, trained in special courses 
at the rural agricultural schools. These men test the 
milk for butter fat, instruct in feeding, make soil analyses, 
and give advice on how to fertilize; they instruct in 
farm accounting, test cattle for tuberculosis, and in other 
ways lend a direct assistance to farming. Five hundred 
and twenty-four such unions are organized at the present 
time. The importance of this work may be seen in the 
fact that during the year 1911, the total number of milk 
cows belonging within the unions gave on the average 
six hundred pounds of milk, or twenty-three pounds of 
butter, more each than did the cows not so owned. To 
systematize, to perfect, and to remove all waste is the 
endeavor of the control unions. It is a happy indication 
of an improved agriculture to know that in the United 
States, too, agricultural advisers are being appointed in 
many progressive communities. 
The Danish national government takes an active part 
in agricultural progress by training large corps of addi- 
tional experts who do their work at the many experiment 
stations of the country or out among the farmers. Of 
great importance are the efforts of the government in 
operating, or at least giving state aid for, the main- 
tenance of breeding centers for choice stock. Thus 
great work is being done for the perfection of the two 
types of Danish native horses: the heavy Jutish sorrels

and the lighter Fredriksborg bays; likewise, the fine 
black and white Jutish cows and the smaller red Fiinen 
cows are receiving much attention, as are also the large, 
white Danish “land swine” — the perfection bacon 
hogs. Nineteen hundred and eleven stock breeding 
societies have been organized between 1890 and 1913. 
Their value to agricultural progress can scarcely be 
overestimated. 
Parceling Out the Large Estates. — The day of land- 
lordism — absentee or otherwise — is a thing of the past 
in Denmark. Since the farmers have learned to direct 
their own government they have passed laws which 
forbid the joining of several farms already established. 
On the other hand, the partition of larger farms or 
estates into small parcels is encouraged by legislative 
enactment. The government encourages industrious 
farm laborers to become landowners, by making direct 
long-time loans for this purpose at 34 or 3 per cent. 
Local credit unions of farmers are also organized to assist 
members of the unions to borrow money to invest in land ~ 
or farm improvements, which money can generally be 
procured at 4 per cent on the several credit of the organ- 
ization. This solution of rural credits makes it possible 
for men of small means to become independent, an 
~, opportunity which would be an impossibility under other 
»sconditions. Only one fifteenth of the Danish farmers 
are now tenants or leaseholders, which is quite a re-

markable condition. At this time 116,614 farms con- 
tain seven and one fifth acres or less; 28,992 farms con- 
tain from eleven and one fourth to twenty-two and one 
half acres ; 35,257, from thirty-three and three fourths to 
sixty-seven and one half acres; 6502, from one hundred 
and thirty-five to two hundred and seventy acres; and 
22 contain five hundred and forty acres and over. The 
latter are the old entailed estates which have not yet 
been reached by the new land laws. It should be added, 
however, that during the last few years several of the 
large estates have been voluntarily parceled out into 
small holdings. In this way intensive small farming is 
ever on the increase. 
Rural Social Life. — Two things at least are necessary 
if one would hold a strong farm population on the soil : 
one is returns from the soil commensurate with the labor 
and money invested; the other pertains to the social 
existence in rural communities. Without the former, 
no one can be contented to remain there. Denmark 
has solved this side of the problem. As for the latter, 
even if agriculture is made reasonably profitable as a 
calling, such alone will not be sufficient inducement to 
hold a large productive population on the farms. Daily 
life there must be kept both humanly interesting and 
attractive. If the open country cannot offer at least 
simple social attractions, people will go where they can 
get them.
-P-A-G-E-33
  RURAL DEVELOPMENT DURING RECENT YEARS = 13. 
In these respects, too, Denmark has been fortunate. 
There is really no longer any danger of a movement 
away from the land. Many of the social problems con- 
fronting us in American rural communities have been 
cleared away. First of all, the great working factors in 
country life — the school and church — have been able 
to hold their own against urban influence. Strong 
churches and well-organized schools in charge of devoted 
and well-trained men who are giving their lives to the 
work in the open country, live there as permanent cita- 
dels against any outside aggression. Much of the social 
life in the community is inspired by these institutions. 
Pastors and teachers have their share in the remarkably 
effective extension work emanating from the folk high 
schools and local agricultural schools. Because the 
social and recreative life is in the main directed from 
these sources, it is generally wholesome. Each country 
parish has its own assembly hall and gymnasium. The 
former is used for extension-course lectures, by the local 
singing union, and for matters of a similar nature. The 
latter holds high place in Danish rural life. The gym- 
nasium, in fact, is the center of the athletic and play 
activities of the community. Gymnastics is compulsory 
in all the rural schools, and is continued at home after 
the close of school life. It is not uncommon to see 
graybeards among the drilling youngsters, turning hand- 
springs and vaulting the horse with the best of them,

Such activities keep the farm hearts eternally young! 
Another unique organization of the farmers is the so- 
called skytteforeninger or sharpshooters’ associations. 
These were founded years ago as patriotic volunteer 
organizations, to hold themselves in readiness for the 
eventualities of war. With the passage of time these 
clubs also have become centers for much of the commu- 
nity’s social life. 
Last of mention, the schools are training young men 
and women for a varied rural artisanship. The small- 
holders’ schools, especially, are doing a good work here. 
Carpenters and masons who take special interest in 
rural architecture, weavers, cobblers, and others who live 
and do their work in the country or rural hamlets, — all 
add their fraction to rural life betterment. It is well to 
remember that in the United States we had at one time 
a twofold social life in rural districts. There were the 
soil tillers, pure and simple, and the group of artisans 
down at the crossroads — the blacksmith, wheelwright, 
cabinetmaker, cobbler, weaver, and so on — who repre- 
sented an important part of our early social life. These 
have long ago disappeared, being forced to the 
cities because of inability to compete with the ma- 
chine-made wares there. Whether our schools or 
other forces shall be able to reconstruct such an artisan- 
ship, or whether this is at all desirable, is quite another 
question.

A Correct Outlook on Life. — Danish farmers have 
learned to take the right outlook on life. They have 
learned in a generation that agricultural life need not be 
complementary of city life; but that it can be complete 
in itself. Such farmers are no longer subject to news- 
paper cartooning or witty lampooning. They have 
found their strength and are exerting it in a wholesome 
way for national improvement. With the conquest of 
the soil came new, hitherto unknown, powers. The 
schools pointed the way. In order best to handle the 
products of the soil, good laws were necessary. This 
led the way to politics. The radical or left party, which 
is composed mainly of small and middle-class farmers, is 
now in full control of the government and the Rigsdag. 
Practically the entire cabinet, from the prime minister 
down, are men from rural communities. And most of 
the progressive agricultural and social legislation enacted 
in recent years can be traced to the radical party. In 
order fully to make clear the remarkable changes that 
have been wrought in recent years, the beginnings of the 
agricultural evolution must be told at this point. 
The Changes of a Century. — The middle of the eight- 
eenth century found Danish agriculture in a deplorable 
condition. The bulk of tillable lands had, down through 
the times, become centered in an arrogant, landholding 
nobility or in the Crown. Not many of the one-time 
powerful free landed peasantry had been strong enough 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
   
   16 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
to survive the changeable times of the Middle Ages as 
independent landowners. A majority of them had been 
forced into a condition of serfdom, under which they 
must remain on the estate where they were born from the 
age of four to thirty-five. After this period of bondage 
had expired they were obliged, under law, to rent land 
lots from their recent overlords on conditions most 
intolerable. Among other burdens, they were subject to 
Hoveri, or working a specific number of days weekly at 
the head estate. In addition, they were ground down 
by heavy tithings. And personal initiative was curbed 
by the system, then in vogue, of working the soil in com- 
mon. The soil was poorly managed, and science in 
agriculture unknown. Even the national government 
seemed deliberately to discriminate against the struggling 
peasants through unfair legislation — especially in the 
form of exorbitant export duties. To fill the cup « 
the peasants’ despair, a virulent cattle plague swept t! 
country and closed the markets of Hamburg against liv. 
cattle, their one chief export. 
In the middle of one of Copenhagen’s most prominen 
thoroughfares stands a rather plain obelisk called Frihed. 
Stétte or liberty monument. It was erected to com- 
memorate the freeing of the serfs in 1788. On the one 
side it bears the inscription: ‘‘ The King Saw that Civi 
Freedom Fixed in Righteous Law Gives Love of Countr: 
Courage for Its Defense, Desire for Knowledge, Long! 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
URAL DEVELOPMENT DURING RECENT YEARS I7 
for Industry, Hope of Prosperity ’’; and on the other, 
“The King Bade that Serfdom Should Cease; that to 
the Landlaws Should Be Given Order and Might, that 
the Free Peasant May Become Brave and Enlightened, 
Industrious and Good, an Honorable Citizen, in Hap- 
piness.” These words of wisdom and prophecy have 
been fully justified by a century of attainment on the 
part of the freedmen. 
The first reforms had already come in 1781, when 
communism in landholding was abandoned. Three 
years later the great Crown estates were parceled out; 
then, in 1788, serfdom came to an end. Export duties 
were lifted on corn and cattle, and the government 
established a credit fund to help the new smallholders 
get on their feet. This period of reform wrought wonders 
in the life of the people. Much progress was made in 
jgiculture. The public schools were improved and 
nyplligence grew apace. Then came the Napoleonic 
sas, carrying with them widespread national ruin. 
Che war left Denmark politically crushed. Its fleets 
jere gone and with them its power at sea; Norway was 
jst for good, leaving a shrunken geographical area and 
.. discouraged people. As soon as the embargoes on 
oodstuffs were lifted, grain prices fell below the cost of 
joduction. The period 1823 to 1825 saw a great crisis 
,the agricultural life of the nation. More than one 
l of all the big estates went under the hammer and 
c

changed hands. Once more patriotic leaders came to the 
rescue and brought about additional reforms which gave 
gradual relief. 
The second great national shock came with the dis- 
astrous German war of 1864. A struggle, long drawn 
and embittered by national differences, had culminated 
in 1848 in a desperate war between Denmark and the 
rebellious duchies of Slesvig and Holsten. For the time 
being, Denmark came out victorious. But the fires of 
bitterness fed by race differences were kept alive. In 
North Slesvig, where an overwhelming number of the 
people were Danish-speaking, the officials were German 
sympathizers and did all they could to stir contention 
and strife. At this critical time the first folk high schoo 
in history — a kind of school which, as will be showr 
later, has been chiefly instrumental in bringing about 
the rehabilitation of rural Denmark — was established at 
Rédding (1844), just a few miles south of the present 
boundary between Germany and Denmark. Thus we 
see the first of these schools took root in patriotic seed- 
ground. Around it was waged a bitter struggle for 
national existence; and when Slesvig became foreign 
soil at the close of the war, the school was moved 
bodily from Rédding to Vejen on the Danish side of the 
border, where under the name of Askov Folkehijskole 
it became the alma mater of the folk high schools of the 
land.

But when all seemed lost and the nation was sinking 
in a lethargy of despair, new voices were heard in the 
land. A new philosophy was being promulgated; it 
taught that education must become universal, practical, 
and democratic, and that hereafter Denmark’s defense 
must be built on the foundation of broad intelligence 
rooted in the love of God and home and native land. 
The father of the new philosophy was Bishop Nikolai 
Frederik Severin’ Grundtvig. Aided by Kristen Kold 
and others, he laid the foundation to the folk high schools, 
mentioned above. The elementary schools, too, felt 
the new influence and strove to answer the needs of the 
new times. The people were eager to listen and to act. 
The new spirit expressed itself in more ways than in 
schools. E. M. Dalgas and his co-workers began the 
gigantic task of reforesting the heather lands of Jutland 
and of draining the bogs and irrigating the upland heaths. 
In a lifetime almost as much tillable land has been re- 
claimed as was lost to the enemy. C.F. Tietgen became 
the chief spirit in a movement to reorganize commerce 
and manufactures; and Svend Hégsbro, more recently, 
and others with him, have drawn the farmers into a 
remarkable system of codperative buying, producing, and 
selling associations, which are now the envy and marvel 
" of the world. A new era of national prosperity came 
® into being in which a scientific agriculture is the most 
important economic factor. Indeed, fully 88 per cent

of the country’s export trade falls under the head of ~* 
“ agricultural produce,” while manufactures, other than 
farm products, represents only 8 per cent, and fishing 
4 per cent. |

CHAPTER II 
THE -STRUGGLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT oF THE LAND 
A Conservation that is remaking the Nation. — The 
previous chapter gave, in general terms, the history of 
the Danish agricultural transformation, and hinted at 
the part played in this great work by the unique school 
system of the land. In the following pages it is the 
purpose to give some of the details of the splendid enter- 
prise and stubborn perseverance that is gradually 
reclaiming for civilization hundreds of square miles of 
land that had for ages been considered irretrievably 
lost. 
When Slesvig and Holsten passed from the nation, in 
1864, it became clear to all who loved the dismembered 
fatherland that now every foot of untilled land must be 
reclaimed and put under the plow. What had been lost 
could be regained by making heath and moor and sandy 
dune bear their share in sheltering and feeding the 
nation. And all this has come to pass. For half a cen- 
tury the work has gone forward, carefully and effec- 
ly, without any blare of publicity. Private phi- 
hropy has vied with public liberality in being the 
urst afield and doing the most. Some of the choicest 
21 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  22 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
spirits of the land have given their time and substance 
in the great cause. In places where the heather held 
sway only two score years ago proud monuments are 
now being reared to these heroes in the midst of splendid 
green forest and fertile meadow—and who would 
exchange such a memorial with that ofthe greatest war 
hero of all time! These men have done their work well 
— they have remade the soil and have at the same time 
taught their fellows that the land is holy and must be 
treated as such! The truth has gradually taken root 
that the fundamental wealth of the nation must come 
from the soil, and that to conserve this wealth and add 
to it, is the sacred duty and privilege of every free-born 
man and woman ! 
The Jutish Heath in Olden Time. — Before the work 
of reclamation began Jutland was a land of barren 
heath, of moor and bog, of great stretches of sand, with 
here and there an oasis of fertile soil, especially where the 
fjords penetrate to the heart of the land. The east 
third of the peninsula only had a better soil and was 
reasonably well protected from the bleak winds sweeping 
the heath. 
But Jutland was not always bleak and sere and poor. 
Two or three thousand years ago it was populated by 
a numerous folk belonging to the Stone Age and, later, 
to the Bronze Age. Their burial mounds and works of 
war and peace lie in continuous chains from coast to
-P-A-G-E-47
STRUGGLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAND 23 
coast. At that time the heath was covered with great 
forests of fir and oak, where the prehistoric people 
hunted, and under their shelter tilled the soil and raised 
herds of cattle and sheep. This early race has passed 
away, but mounds of stone and earth stand to tell the 
story. Later civilization followed the path broken by 
the Stone Age men. When Christianity came, churches 
sprang up in the heart of Jutland, close by the ancient 
tumuli. But Jutland was the battle ground of the cen- 
turies. Here German and Dane met in bloody combat, 
and here, for ages, feuds and civil wars of Danish chiefs 
were fought. When the distress was at its greatest and 
the people least able to make successful resistance, the 
Black Death invaded Denmark. The pestilence at one 
fell stroke.changed the whole of central Jutland. Towns 
were emptied of human inhabitants and the fields went 
uncultivated. The heather sprang up and choked out 
the work of human hands. Where there were populous 
towns at one time, dim outlines only of foundation walls 
may now occasionally be found deeply hidden under the 
heather. 
The work of destruction begun by the Black Death was 
later completed by man and the elements. The ax and 
the keen west winds aided one another in completing the 
devastation. Thoughtless man, eager for gain, hewed 
down the forest and neglected to replant it. The winds 
swept triumphantly across the land; the heather closed 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
24 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
in upon the roots of the remaining trees and killed them. 
Then the last of the grass and corn plants had to retreat 
and the curse of barrenness was upon the heath. Indeed, 
thereafter, for centuries no man would cross its far- 
stretching desolation who could escape it. The land had 
become the abiding place only for outlaw and wild beast. 
First Attempts at Reclaiming the Soil. — During the 
eighteenth century the friends of conservation made 
several attacks on the heath, but it proved too strong 
for their crude methods. The most interesting as well 
as most expensive of these experiments was the calling 
in of one thousand German colonists, in 1759. These 
people were taxed with the stupendous task of putting 
the land under cultivation again, by marling and planting, 
draining and irrigating. Everything was furnished 
them by the government; colony towns were built, and 
churches with German pastors were opened. But it 
was all in vain. The climate was inhospitable and the 
soil unyielding. By degrees the disheartened colonists 
drifted back to Germany or to more friendly regions in 
Denmark. In 1790 the Government began systematic 
experiments in tree planting, but little came of the 
work because no one yet understood how to treat the 
soil and just what trees to plant. The Government 
used the common Danish firs, but these could not thrive 
under the present hard conditions. 
During the first half of the nineteenth century, Steen 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  STRUGGLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAND 25 
Steensen Blicher, the Danish heather poet, roamed the 
length and breadth of the ling with dog and gun. In 
those days he could go for miles without seeing a human 
being, and would be alone with the skylarks and his 
dreams of how Denmark should once again populate the 
dreary wastes. When he died in 1848, the saga of the 
heath was almost complete. A new generation of men, 
—and chief among them Col. E. M. Dalgas, — well versed 
in all that recent science had to offer, began a well- 
planned attack against which the heath could not make 
successful resistance. 
Dalgas and the Danish Heather Society. — In March 
of 1866, Col. E. M. Dalgas and a small group of other 
-national-spirited men, among whom might be mentioned 
Mourier Petersen, Drewsen, and Morville, met and 
organized the Danish Heather Society (Det Danske 
Hedéselskab), which had as its sole purpose to redeem for 
the fatherland, through works of peace upon the land, 
the humiliating losses of the recent war. Thoughts of 
personal gain had nothing whatever to do with the stu- 
pendous undertaking — and that is the right term to 
use, for these men had taken upon themselves the con- 
quest of a land area that, if successful, would add fully 
one fifth to the tillable area of the nation ! 
At the time of writing the society has a membership 
of sixty-five hundred and draws from State subsidies and 
private sources aid to the amount of 450,000 kroner 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  
26 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
annually. The work is very comprehensive and is di- 
rected in many channels. A certain section of the soci- 
ety devotes all its energies to reforestation; a second sec- 
tion concerns itself with making the heath arable through 
the application of marl, lime, fertilizers, and proper cul- 
tivation ; a third drains the bogs and curbs the overflow 
of the rivers and develops the peat industry; and a 
fourth looks after irrigation and the height of the surface 
water. The association holds about seven thousand 
hectares of plantation in its own name and supervises the 
development of 73,000 hectares of privately owned land. 
A number of important experiment stations are main- 
tained where the public may seek assistance on any 
phase of reclamation work desired. 
When the society was organized in the 60’s, Jutland 
alone had two thousand and sixty-five square miles of 
barren upland heath, three hundred and sixty-five square 
miles of bog, and two hundred miles of sand dunes. In 
1896, this area had already been reduced to twelve 
hundred and seventy-five square miles of heath, one 
hundred and fifty square miles of bog, and one hundred 
and forty-two square miles of sand dunes. This means 
that in thirty years almost one half of the entire area 
had been reclaimed —a remarkable showing, indeed. 
Since then even more rapid progress has been made. 
When Dalgas died a few years ago, twenty-five hundred 
square miles of land in Jutland and the islands hitherto

dominated by “ the evil principle” had been reclaimed 
and converted into forest, field, and meadow, and new 
industries established in naval stores, wood gas, and 
lumber — results which challenge the world. Yom" 
Reforesting the Heath. — It is of especial interest to 
Americans to know just how the Danes got their forests 
to grow. Our own Government, it may be recalled, 
recently threw open to settlement large tracts of land in 
the State of Nebraska, which had for some years be- 
longed to the National Forest Reserve. The ostensible 
reason for doing this was that evergreens could not be 
made to grow on these sandy hills. The experiment at 
reclamation was given up ag a failure because results 
were slow to come. If the Danes had been no more per- 
severing than we have been in this experiment, the west 
winds might have been allowed to blow forever. un- 
hindered across the heath. 
Red spruce is the desideratum of all the Danish tree 
planting. But it cannot be coaxed to grow in the raw 
heath —alone. It must have a nurse tree. Hard 
experience has taught this. Mountain firs are the har- 
diest of all evergreens. They will grow in the sand and 
in the sour turf. The procedure is briefly this: the heath 
turf is broken; and then plowed a second time. This 
gives it a chance to air out, and nitrogen becomes avail- 
able. Then the whole is thoroughly subsoiled with a 
Hanoverian subsoiler. It is quite desirable to marl 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
28 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
the surface in order to neutralize the acidity of the soil. 
In many places, indeed, this is essential to success. The 
whole is now ready for the planting to begin. A few 
years ago it was customary to plant the whole in red 
spruce ; but after a few years they would become stunted 
in their growth, making no perceptible headway. The 
red spruce, for some cause, did not have the power to 
gather from the atmosphere and heather soil the neces- 
sary amount of nitrogen to make them thrive. They 
were, accordingly, planted in a mixture with French 
mountain firs which were known to have a remarkable 
nitrogen-fixing capacity. The experiment proved success- 
ful so far as infusing new life into the red spruce is con- 
cerned. The starved plantations turned green and flour- 
ished. An examination of the root structure disclosed 
the fact that large masses of bacterial nodules similar to 
those on the mountain firs were forming at the roots of 
the red spruce, which had none such while growing 
alone. But the mountain firs were fast outgrow- 
ing the red spruce and threatened to smother them. 
Then the query rose, Would the spruce now continue to 
grow if the firs were cut away? After due experimenta- 
tion this proved to be the fact. The red spruce could 
get along without its nurse tree once the start had been 
made. It is now customary to cut down the firs as 
soon as they begin to crowd the spruce noticeably. But 
they are not permitted to go to waste, as they are ad-

                         mirable for naval stores, wood gas, charcoal, mine 
« props, and posts. 
In 1862, the total forest area of Jutland was two hun- 
>, dred and eighteen and four tenths square miles. At the 
¢ 9resent time it comprises seven hundred and two square 
y ailes. This takes into consideration compact areas of 
plantation chiefly. Then there are windbreaks and 
Pi hedges of mountain fir and hardy white and Sitka spruce, 
which form a continuous checkerboard on the surface of 
the heath. A few years more and the open heather will 
have passed for good. An interesting fact is this, that 
an association of Danish-Americans recently collected, 
in the United States, a fund which was used to purchase 
a tract of the old Jutish Heath to be set aside and pre- 
served for coming generations. This bit of sentiment 
shows that the Danes themselves feel that the end of 
the struggle is almost at hand. 
Reclamation by regulating Height of Surface Water. 
—It was stated in the last chapter that all Denmark 
rises only a few feet above the ocean level. As a natural 
consequence of this, its rivers are sluggish and tortuous 
in their windings, and the peninsula and islands have 
ae many lakes, marshes, and fens. To straighten the rivers 
and, by science, regulate the height of their water so 
to reclaim for cultivation bordering lowlands and 
shes has been another of the interesting works of
-P-A-G-E-56
  30 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
work in recent years to embrace the islands as well as 
the peninsula. 
Annually recurring high water has been the cause of 
much loss to crops along the river courses. To remedy 
this condition, the Heather Society has undertaken and 
carried to successful execution no less than one hundred 
and twelve such projects to regulate the height of the 
surface water, thereby reclaiming immediately 54,460 
acres of excellent bottom land. This is usually done by 
straightening the river bed to increase its fall and by 
deepening the channel to lower the height of the water, 
which is kept normally as near as possible three to five 
feet below the level of the adjacent land. The great 
value of this water to the process of surface evaporation 
and capillarity is well understood. To keep it from falling 
too low at certain seasons, substantial retaining locks are 
built at stated intervals. 
. For every such new conquest in land there is rejoicing 
throughout the kingdom. When Skals River, or, as the 
Danes call it, Skalsaa, was regulated in this way several 
years ago, the daily press had this to say about the 
opening : “ One of the happiest events that we ever have 
to record in the acquisition of fresh territory within the 
boundaries of our native land. Barren heaths are 
brought under cultivation. Useless pools and swamps 
are turned into pastures and arable land. This means 
that in the future more men can find a home and earn
-P-A-G-E-57
  
  STRUGGLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAND 3r 
their daily bread in their own country. Such an increase 
of territory has taken place during the last two years as 
a result of the regulation of the course of Skalsaa.” 
This small river leaves Lake Tusing near Randers and 
winds along almost imperceptibly for some forty-four 
miles, emptying into an arm of Limfjord. The method of 
procedure has been to clean out and deepen the channel 
and to cut through the excessive windings. By this 
process the river bed has been shortened by almost ten 
miles, and its surface level has been lowered between 
two and five feet. The width of the river has been re- 
duced to a channel ranging from twenty-five to fifty 
feet, its depth is from five to eight feet. Twenty-seven 
retaining locks regulate the height of water. At an 
outlay of 250,000 kroner an area of 14,500 acres has been 
reclaimed, giving an increase in value of at least 4,000,000 
kroner. In other parts of Jutland the lowlands are being 
protected against floods by river dikes similar to the 
Mississippi levees. The most recent project of this kind 
now getting under way is a redoubtable one to wrest the 
old tidal meadows near Ribe in southwest Jutland from 
the North Sea by erecting great dikes for miles along 
the shore line. So the work goes ever onward and in a 
short while even the ocean storm flood will be denied and 
held in check by the prowess of man. 
Irrigation and Drainage. — Two hundred and twenty- 
five miles of irrigation canals — the work of a few years
-P-A-G-E-58
  32° RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
— penetrate into the heart of the upland moor. Many 
thousand acres have thus been transformed from barren- 
ness to great fruitfulness. The author had the pleasure 
to see the work of transformation at Hesselvig near Hern- 
ing, where a one-time desolate heath has been changed 
to beautiful meadow, field, and forest in a surprisingly 
‘short time. Nearly all the irrigation projects take ad- 
vantage of gravity for conducting the water. In some 
instances water wheels, windmills, and even steam en- 
gines are used to lift the water to higher levels. There 
are even cases in which bog water from draining proj- 
ects is used to irrigate the moor. Bogs and marshes 
which have no natural outlets are pumped dry and 
then kept free from water by a series of windmills of 
great power and occasionally by steam and petroleum 
engines. 
Making the Soil. — To drain the lowlands and irrigate 
the upland moors is only the first step in the reclamation 
process. The “evil principle” must be removed. 
This means that the sour lowland soil must be given the 
necessary treatment to make it fit for cultivation by 
neutralizing its acidity and adding such soil ingredients 
as it may lack. The higher and drier uplands generally 
are in need of most of the great elements of fertility, 
which must be brought to them before they are fit for 
use. The lowlands are rich in nitrogen, but have prac- 
tically no potash and phosphorus. Of these, the former  
-P-A-G-E-59
  STRUGGLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAND 33 
is imported from the kali mines of Germany, and most 
of the latter come from the mineral phosphate beds of 
Florida. Lime and marl come from native supply. 
The barnyard fertilizers are carefully husbanded in large 
cemented reservoirs, and the liquid manures are kept in 
underground cisterns. The latter is carefully sprinkled 
in due season over the meadow and plowlands, so that 
nothing is lost. 
Without marl or lime the heath cannot become arable. 
Fortunate, therefore, are the heath dwellers who chance 
to live close to good marl beds. If the marl proves of 
poor quality or in scant quantities, life cannot thrive. 
The Heather Society and similar organizations have men 
— the so-called marl seekers — who devote all their time 
to finding new deposits. The author was crossing the 
heath on one occasion, when he chanced upon an excited 
group of men at work, drawing a long, slim auger from 
the ground. They were the marl seekers. One of 
them poured a few drops of acid on the fine core of soil 
that had just been raised from the ground. All with 
one voice exclaimed: ‘“ It bubbles, thank God for that!” 
Yes, if it bubbles, it is marl and means inexpensive fer- 
tilization of the soil. The Heather Society has found fully 
seventeen hundred marl deposits, and the Government 
lends its aid by transporting it at very low cost over the 
state-owned railways. The Society also owns many 
miles of movable roadbeds ‘and hundreds of cars, using 
D  
-P-A-G-E-60
  34 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
steam, petroleum, and horse power as motive force. If 
the heart of the heath is to be attacked and no marl can 
be found there, one of these narrow-gauge movable tracks 
is laid in ready-made sections, and the life-giving sub- 
stance is soon at hand ready for use. 
In the islands the soil is better than in Jutland, as 
most of it has been under cultivation for ages. Even 
here soil experiment stations are found in large numbers. 
Every man learns to take advantage of this scientific 
assistance and early in life learns just what his land 
requires. The average Dane knows the significance of 
the phrase, the soil is holy. For every crop taken 
from it he strives to put back into it fertilizers at least 
equal to what was taken out. In Denmark, he is con- 
sidered the best farmer who hands over to his children 
his acres stronger and better than he got them from his 
own father. 4 
{ Lessons for American Agriculture. — The Danish motto 
is to use all the land, abuse none of it, and treat it well 
~ because it is holy.) Our forefathers who settled along the 
Atlantic seaboard may have been religious men in their 
own way, but they certainly did not apply the teachings 
of the Pentateuch in the way in which Moses had in- 
tended they should be applied; for in New England and 
the South alike they drew the virgin fertility from the land 
without putting anything back into the soil. Perhaps 
in those days it was impracticable to do otherwise, as new

lands cost little or nothing, and could be taken into use 
as soon as the older ones were worn out. At any rate 
it is high time now to conserve what we have left and 
reclaim and remake what has been worn out. The old 
Northeast has its thousands of deserted farms and the 
cotton kingdom has hundreds of square miles of land at 
one time rich plantations, now overrun by jack pines and 
sassafras. These must be reclaimed, all of them. We 
have exploited the riches of nature in the past. But 
now there is a marked sentiment that all this must end, 
and a distinct movement is already under way, North, 
South, East, and West, to usher in this period of real 
husbandry farming which is at our doors. 
This new period will demand masterful men with the 
desire for real conquest in them. Scientific farming is 
not a simple business and needs well-prepared men and 
women. With the ordinary chance farming, and blind 
resignation and fatalism, of which there has been too 
much in the rural communities of all countries — and 
of which the United States has its full share —little 
headway can be made. Denmark was no exception 
to the rule. But in the fullness of time the country 
saw the fatal mistake — or was forced to see it — and the 
great change came. The American nation can well 
profit by the lesson that little Denmark teaches. It 
will be a great thing to meet these agricultural needs 
now while we yet are a young people and the virgin

wealth of the soil is still in great measure unexploited. 
In the United States, too, properly applied education 
will play the master réle in this greatest of human - 
enterprises.

  CHAPTER III 
Tue ImporTANCE OF COOPERATION IN THE DANISH 
AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM 
General Statement. — When one takes into considera- 
tion the deplorable conditions under-which the Danish 
peasantry formerly lived, the arrogance with which the 
land-owning nobility treated them, the injustice of the land 
laws, and their own lack of education and scientific train- 
ing, it is hard to realize how they should have become, 
almost over-night, the leaders that they are in scientific 
agricultural production and distribution. And, assuredly, 
this could not have come to pass had it not been for 
the leavening and elevating influence of their remarka- 
ble rural schools — and especially of the folk high schools. 
/ Many European nations have excellent rural schools; 
but few, if any, can boast a system which reaches and 
benefits all classes without distinction so thoroughly, | 
in just such a way as*does the Danish.) The folk high 
schools have disseminated among all the country folk a 
broad general culture which has enabled them to rise 
out of self and local trivialities to see the world in large 
perspective. The schools have helped them to think and 
37
-P-A-G-E-64
  38 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
reason for themselves and have called forth a strong 
unifying fellow feeling, which has made the people 
trust one another, which in turn has made it possible 
and easy for them to work together in common purpose. 
Extreme Thoroughness of the Preparatory Steps. — 
The entire agricultural reorganization has been accom- 
plished by these intelligent farmers themselves. To be 
sure, scientists among them have been responsible for 
many great forward strides; but even they belong to the 
agricultural class at the same time that they are their 
representatives, paving the way for new things in the 
agricultural schools, in the laboratories, or at the experi- 
ment farms. “One is struck,” says Jessie Bréchner, 
“by the extreme thoroughness of all preparatory work, 
by the variety of fields that have been made subject to 
practical and exhaustive investigation. Comparative 
tests in almost every department of agriculture and 
dairy farming have tended to show the true merits of 
methods, of breeds, of machinery, of seeds, etc., and have 
enabled the farmer to apply the rational rule of three to 
many an old routine. The Danish farmer not only 
knows what he is doing, but he knows why he is doing 
Hin ie 
American Agricultural Schools have up to very re- 
cently devoted their energies to the production side of 
agriculture almost exclusively., There has been and

-P-A-G-E-65
COOPERATION IN DANISH AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM 39 
still is a great need of intelligent production from the 
soil of our country. But it is quite noticeable that the 
leading schools are beginning to lay considerable stress 
on the preparation of farm products for the markets and 
the actual marketing of them. This is indeed a happy 
sign. Before the American farmer can hope to get much 
more for his labor than he is now getting, he must learn 
the réle of handling his own products. But this lesson 
will come hard. It is certain to be a slow one. It 
will likely begin as a leaven and work its way outward 
from a few especially favored centers. The American 
nation lacks the homogeneity of the Danish people. 
The comparative newness of the land and its plenty, 
the long distances between farms, and the natural 
wanderlust towards the setting sun — all these must be 
taken into consideration. 
Meanwhile, it is interesting to see what agricultural 
Denmark has been able to accomplish in the field of 
codperative enterprise. 
Buying and Selling Societies. — The Danish system 
of codperative societies is very much like the English 
Rochdale enterprises, with this marked exception, that 
while the English societies are almost wholly confined 
to the towns, in Denmark the opposite is true. Of the 
230,000 members all but about 2 per cent live in rural 
districts. This means that practically every farm house- 
hold is vitally interested in one or more such stores. If 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  40 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
the Danish farmers did not purchase direct their fodder 
stuffs, fertilizers, seeds, machinery, and such things, but 
should have to pay a middleman’s profit, their whole 
system would collapse. There are great numbers of these 
societies —some large, others small. The largest, — 
The~Joint Codperative Society- for Danish Codperative 
Stores, — which has thirteen hundred auxiliaries, — turned 
over, last year, goods to the amount of $16,000,000. 
Another— The Jutish Codperative Society for the 
Purchase of Fodder Stuffs — has a membership of 34,000 
and purchased, in 1913, goods amounting to $7,500,000. 
A third, — The Danish Céoperative Society for the Pur- 
chase of Fertilizers, — with six hundred and seventy 
auxiliaries, imported from Germany, the United States, 
and South America, 47,000,000 kilograms of chemicals 
and mineral fertilizers, during the same period. 
The success of all such societies in Denmark is trace- 
able to their practical organization, and the intelligence 
and general integrity of their management. They are 
all genuinely codperative, being based on the man-vote 
principle explained below. 
Importance of Codperative Diatiying lJ All Danish 
codperative dairies are founded on the rock of faith in 
one another’s word of honor} When the farmers organize 
a dairy, they pledge themselves to furnish a given amount 
of milk annually for a specified number of years. This 
pledge is never broken. The association borrows its

COOPERATION IN DANISH AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM 41 
capital on the joint credit of its members who severally 
sign the obligations of the association, each limiting his 
responsibility to a specified amount. A board of mana- 
gers is then chosen, which elects directors and the chief 
“butter maker.” The enterprise is codperative in the 
truest sense of the word, being based on the man-vote 
principle — that is, each man has only one vote whether 
he furnishes much or little milk, whether he has obligated 
himself for much or little of the indebtedness. The 
members receive semi-monthly pay checks for milk 
supplied. Semi-annual dividends are declared on actual 
profits. When a specified number of years has elapsed 
— generally not more than twenty-eight — the accumu- 
lated property may be divided among the stockholders 
according to the amount of original liability undertaken 
by the various members; or the business may be con- 
tinued for another twenty-eight years, and so on. 
Of the codperative dairies which came under the 
writer’s notice, the largest, though in some respects not 
the most typical, was the Trifolium Dairy and Butter 
Factory near the center of Zealand. This is a very large 
plant, beautifully kept, supplied with all the latest mod- 
ern machinery and many new contrivances which are con- 
stantly being made in Denmark to supply dairy needs. 
Trifolium receives the milk from 12,000 cows, treating 
at least 28,500,000 kilograms of milk; 40,000 cheeses of 
fifty varieties were stored in the curing cellars of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
42 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
dairy at the time of the visit. These, if put end to end, 
would cover something like thirteen miles, which should 
give one a good idea of the size of the plant. Besides 
making butter and cheese this plant sends specially 
bottled milk to the great Copenhagen Supply Company 
and furnishes other associations as far south as Berlin 
pure milk for young babies. About five thousand 
pounds of butter are churned daily. 
It was of great interest to watch the manufacture of 
Swiss cheese. Many of these weigh from one hundred 
and sixty to one hundred and eighty pounds, needing at 
least nineteen hundred pounds of milk for a single cheese ! 
The whey from this cheese is passed through a separator, 
which takes out whatever butter fat is left over; and it is 
considerable. This is then churned into a second-grade 
butter. The remaining whey is thereupon made into a 
peculiar brownish sweet cheese called in Scandinavia 
“Myseost.” In great heated caldrons, the whey is 
stirred and gradually evaporated, leaving a thick brownish 
mass, which is sweetened and pressed into cheese forms. 
This shows how carefully everything is managed so that 
nothing shall be wasted. 
The farmers of this association borrowed the original 
capital from savings banks at 3} per cent, the plant, at 
the time of the visit, representing an investment of 
one million kroner. The expectations are that in twenty 
years from the time of its founding the enterprise will 
   
-P-A-G-E-71
  
COOPERATION IN DANISH AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM 43 
have paid out the original investment. Then the plant 
will belong to the organizers to do with as they please. 
Not a single instance has ever come to notice in the 
history of Danish dairying wherein those who helped 
to organize it did not get a reasonable semi-annual 
dividend, besides a good market price for their milk. 
In addition to this, most of them will have the plant 
clear of all encumbrance within a score of years. In this 
way they are paid liberally for their risk and trouble. 
In 1909, the country’s collective number of milk cows 
was 1,282,254, of which 83 per cent, or 1,059,956, were 
cows on farms delivering milk to the codperative dairies. 
The total milk production was 3,400,000,000 kilograms, 
making an average of twenty-five hundred and seventy 
kilograms per cow. The milk production proved to be 
considerably larger per cow on the small farms than on 
the larger ones. 
It is-interesting to note the strict regulations under 
which the milk is prepared for the dairies. These demand 
that the utmost care be taken during the process of milk- 
ing, and that the milk be perfectly clean and properly 
chilled. The managers will discard all milk that shows 
the slightest degree of impurity or uncleanness. ‘All the 
milk is pasteurized to assure the destruction of germ life. 
Codperative Bacon Factories rapidly Increasing. — 
Scarcely of less importance than the dairy industry is the 
bacon production. The bacon factories are organized
-P-A-G-E-72
  44 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
generally by the farmers who form man-vote associations. 
This organization is very similar to that of the dairy. 
At the annual or semi-annual meeting, whatever profits 
are made during the year are divided among the members 
according to the number of pounds of pork, dressed weight, 
furnished by each. Very often these factories are able 
to give their members not only the highest market price, 
or something more than the regular market price, but 
give besides, in the form of dividends, three and one 
half re, or about one cent per pound for their products. 
All this is in addition to setting aside a considerable 
reserve to take care of the original funded indebtedness. 
Practically all the fine bacon goes to England, where the 
Danish inspection stamp is accepted without question. 
The writer visited a typical bacon factory of this kind 
at Haslev, Zealand. The association has a membership 
of thirteen hundred and fifty, drawing support from a 
radius of ten or twelve English miles. The members 
range from large owners who furnish several hundred 
head of hogs per year down to the smallholders with 
their two or three. Any one may belong by solemnly 
giving his word of honor to furnish all or a certain per 
cent of his annual output of hogs. The organizing 
capital of the Haslev plant was borrowed in part from 
members who had money to lend. This does not, how- 
ever, give these men more control in the association 
than the smallholder with his two hogs. When we begin  
-P-A-G-E-73
   
    COOPERATION IN DANISH AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM 45 
to organize our codperative concerns on the man-vote 
principle in the United States instead of the old joint 
stock company idea, which so often ends by one or more 
enterprising geniuses forcing. the small members out, 
these enterprises will prosper better than they do now. 
The actual number of hogs handled by the Haslev 
farmers last year was 24,433. They sold meat products 
to the amount of 1,848,582 kroner, most of which was 
placed upon the English markets. The organizers 
received the highest market price for these products in 
addition to which 19,326 kroner was distributed as profits, 
and nearly four thousand kroner set aside for the sinking 
fund. This factory also handled, free of charge to its 
members, 170,000 pounds of eggs, yielding on the mar- 
ket 98,000 kroner. 
€The Danish bacon swine must not weigh more than 
one hundred and eighty pounds dressed weight? At the 
Haslev factory the average for the year was just one 
hundred and thirty-three and two tenths pounds. A 
premium of one ére per pound is paid for hogs weighing 
between one hundred and twenty-five and one hundred 
and forty pounds, dressed. 
The inspection is especially thorough. Expert veteri- 
narians, trained and appointed by the government, have 
absolute charge of the factory. Every carcass exported 
must be entirely free from disease, no matter how trifling. 
During the year, thirteen hundred and eighty-one seem- 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  46 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
ingly good hogs were refused the exportation stamp in 
this factory. Of these, one thousand and fourteen 
received the blue stamp which signifies a minor ailment 
that does not interfere with domestic use; two hundred 
and seventy-eight received the black stamp and were 
condemned except for specific purposes; eighty-nine 
were condemned as entirely unfit for food. This rigid 
inspection, together with the fact that only the finest 
young swine, fed according to the rules of the National 
Swine Association, are used, explain the great popularity 
of Danish bacon abroad. 
Science in Egg Exportation. — The exportation of eggs 
is the last of the thr ~ ost important Danish agricul- 
tural industries. A wry man and woman in the 
country belongs to o 4e many gathering associa- 
tions. At the time ot ming a member, each one 
is pledged solemnly to fu.n. h only fresh, candled eggs. 
If the pledge is broken, the member may be put under 
arrest and severely fined. The result is that no bad 
eggs are ever brought to the gathering stations. The 
Danish exporter has long ago learned that large white 
eggs are the most popular abroad. At the large breeding 
centers of poultry the effort is now being made to produce 
across between the black Minorcas and the Leghorns 
to supply this demand. Every member of a gathering 
station has his own number or mark; the station, also, 
has its number. The gathering stations send all their
-P-A-G-E-75
  COOPERATION IN DANISH AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM 47 
eggs to one of the great export centers at Copenhagen, 
Esbjerg, or elsewhere. Here the eggs are carefully 
classified according to size, shape, and color, and placed 
in nice boxes containing a dozen or a score. They are 
trademarked and shipped to the English markets and 
sold to the best hotels and private families at surprisingly 
large prices. Indeed, this enterprise has taken on such 
proportions that very few eggs produced in Denmark are 
consumed at home. It is common to import eggs from 
Finland, Scandinavia, or Russia to supply home con- 
sumption. In other words, the Danes have developed 
this enterprise to such limits that it actually pays to send 
the home product out and bein-sshe foreign product in, 
paying transportation char. e. vays, and yet having 
a wide margin for the trov , 
Just how have the Da; jen able to control the 
markets wherever they hay.icseriously tried? No doubt 
the answer. is this: through the excellence of the product 
offered for sale and the attractiveness with which they 
have been marketed. The determining factor, more 
than anything else, is the guaranty of quality which 
may always be relied upon. In the matter of bacon 
products, for example, the Danish government is never 
known to have permitted unsound hogs to pass the 
gauntlet of its veterinarians; the national reputation and 
honor is staked on these things, hence the popularity and 
high place of Danish agricultural products abroad. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76

Satisfactory Rural Credits. — It is often pointed out 
that short-time tenantry is one of the greatest banes of 
modern agriculture. One of the many reasons for loss 
of agricultural population in the United States is the 
fact that many boys who are really steeped in a knowledge 
of the soil, find themselves forced to desert the country 
  
    
community because of the increasing difficulty of pro-   
curing land, due to rising land values and particularly 
to high interest rates. Many of these are of too big a 
caliber to be satisfied to remain on the land as tenants. 
They consequently move to town, where opportunities 
for leadership are more promising. Judging by the 
present activity in many circles of government, the 
American people may expect very soon to get substantial 
relief in the form of satisfactory rural credits for the 
sturdy, rural-minded youths who are eager to remain 
in the open country, if conditions for land ownership 
can be made more tolerable. 
Denmark has a system of rural credits that has made 
it possible for more than 75,000 families to become free- 
holders, who would otherwise have remained day 
laborers in the country or else would have been absorbed 
in the city maelstrom. Besides this, the system makes 
it easy for any farmer, be he big or small, to borrow 
funds at such low rates for long-time periods that he 
can afford to develop his holdings to the highest degree 
of efficiency.
-P-A-G-E-77
  
  COOPERATION IN DANISH AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM 49 
The State Smallholdings. — At this point it is well to 
consider briefly the Danish “Law for the Creation of 
Smallholdings.” Who may take advantage of it? 
Just how does it operate? 
Any person, twenty-five years of age or over who has 
had five years’ experience in farming and can satisfy 
the government as to his character, may — under the 
law of 1909 — select a piece of land then upon the market, 
not less than three acres, the farm, including stock and 
other equipment, not to cost in excess of eight thousand 
kroner and preferably not above six thousand five hun- 
dred. Of this amount the government will lend, up to 
nine tenths, money which is to be repaid within ninety- 
eight years (interest at 3 per cent). Applications are 
considered in the order in which they are filed. The 
number of loans made depends upon the amount annually 
made available for this purpose. At this time, the 
government actually pays 33 per cent for the money 
lent to the smallholders at 3 per cent, but the general 
feeling is that the nation at large can well afford to pay 
the difference in order that “ all men may get their legs 
under their own table.” To date, the national govern- 
ment has loaned in all $25,000,000, of which it has lost 
less than $10,000. 
The Danish Credit Unions. — In all instances where 
the funds are provided by the Government, the bene- 
ficiaries are called “state smallholders.” There are 
E
-P-A-G-E-78
  5° RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
now many thousands of these in Denmark. But the 
country has also what may be termed “ natural small- 
holders,” being farmers of small means who are generally 
financed by some one of the many credit unions so 
common throughout the kingdom. These organizations 
are not banks as commonly understood; but a number 
‘ ? of farmers unite to form the “ union,’ making use of 
their aggregate credit to help those of their numbers who 
may need funds. The borrower simply executes a 
mortgage on his land in favor of the credit union, which 
thereupon issues a bond to the borrower, who sells this 
upon the open market much the same as stocks and 
bonds are sold in our country. In such a way the funds 
are secured. These loans are for long time and draw 
4 per cent interest. 
For the past fiscal year the thirteen most important 
Danish Credit Unions showed resources amounting 
to 1,764,200,000 kroner with liabilities of 1,617,000,000 
kroner, leaving a reserve fund of 66,500,000 kroner. 
It ought to be stated, finally, that losses incurred under 
the system of credit unions have been trifling, the reserve 
fund being in every instance more than able to meet the 
losses. One credit society only — Jydsk Kébstads- 
Kreditforening — has been obliged to seek liquidation. 
“ This liquidation,” says Mr. M. P. Blem, President of 
the Credit Society of Estate Owners in the Danish 
Island — Diocese Districts, “is soon to be finished, and

The total number of farms is 260,083, with an aggre- 
gate acreage of 8,177,169, making the average-size farm 
in Denmark slightly above thirty acres. If from these 
figures the handful of large estates were subtracted, the 
average size would be materially decreased. 
This is mentioned here because of the marked tendency 
of recent years to parcel out these large estates so that 
every man may have an opportunity to live on his own 
land. \ This movement is entirely voluntary on the part 
of the estate owners, who often are the leaders in the 
reforms. 
The life of the Danish smallholders is so full of instruc-
-P-A-G-E-82
  52 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
tive teachings that the story of such a one is in- 
cluded here. The holding in question lies some three 
miles from Ringsted, Zealand, and the owner is Hans 
Nielsen. 
The author was driven to the stead in a quaint little 
carryall drawn by one horse, a small but well-built 
animal, seemingly a cross between the small Icelanders 
and the heavy Jutish sorrels. The road, like all Danish 
roads, was a well-rounded macadam with large, open 
gutters at the sides. Just on the edge of Ringsted lay 
the codperative bacon factory of which Mr. Nielsen is a 
member and to which he annually sells some twenty odd 
bacon hogs. A little further out we passed Kerehave 
School for Smallholders, one of a number of schools 
established here and there over the country to help 
farmers solve the problems peculiar to the successful 
tilling of smallholds. Our host pointed with much 
pride to the fact that both his wife and he had taken 
short courses at Kerehave, a fact which was later at- 
tested by two small framed diplomas hanging over the 
‘lounge in the Nielsen living room. 
Arrived at the stead, we found it a place of seven 
acres, in rather light soil, though in a high state of cultiva- 
tion. The farm buildings lay back from the road several 
hundred yards; but as the soil must all be used, the 
road was flanked by high-stemmed cherry trees instead 
of ordinary shade trees. The whole made a striking
-P-A-G-E-83
    
COOPERATION IN DANISH AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM 53 
object lesson. The living house, barn, and stable were 
all built together under one roof, according to ancient 
custom; though the place was so beautifully clean that 
there was no seeming nuisance whatever. The house 
had four rooms, simply and comfortably furnished. 
Here lived Mr. Nielsen and his family of five, including 
the hired domestic. The cow barn was separated from 
the dwelling house by a solid brick wall. The entire 
structure, by the way, was made of brick with a stucco 
finish, and with thatched roof. The barn was the home 
of three fine red Fiinen cows for nine months out of the 
year. They certainly lived in comfort in their painted 
stalls and within freshly whitewashed walls. The 
floor was cement, furnished with a drain communicating 
directly with an underground cistern, where was stored 
the liquid manure for such time as it should be sprinkled 
over the clover meadow or the plow land. Another 
cemented reservoir contained all other manure from the 
barn and stable. Complimented on the care exercised 
in saving all fertilizers, Mr. Nielsen smilingly made 
answer, “ Yes, it is the care of these small things, as you 
call them, that makes our success possible. Were we 
Danes to pitch our manure in heaps out of doors the 
way you are said to do in America, permitting the real 
manure to run off, and then scattering the straw over the 
fields, we should go bankrupt! ” 
Our attention was next called to the cows, and it soon
-P-A-G-E-84
  
54 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
became perfectly clear to us that star boarders are un- 
known at the cow barns of Danish smallholders. A daily ~ 
record of each cow is kept in a frame on the barn wall. 
If one of the cows should chance to fall the least bit 
below a certain standard in butter fat and milk, she 
would immediately be led away to the slaughterhouse. 
Such an inscription as this appeared over the head of 
each of Mr. Nielsen’s cows: 
Rose — Born 14/6, 1905. 
Sire L. VII. 
Dam B. 13. 
Calved 7/11 . . . Bred 16/12. 
Milk, 13, 563 lbs. (Danish) — Butter, 489 Ibs. (Danish). 
It appeared from the record that these three cows had 
yielded their owner 39,952 pounds of milk and 1447 
pounds of butter during the year. 
The pigsty was an interesting place. At this time 
thirteen shoats were getting ready for market. They 
were of the Danish breed of whites, which grow rapidly, 
are very prolific, and well suited for bacon purposes. 
Mr. Nielsen boasted of having his hogs ready for the 
cooperative slaughterhouse when they were no older 
than three months. They would then weigh from one 
hundred and thirty to one hundred and forty pounds, 
dressed weight, and therefore draw the additional price 
of one dre per pound offered for this class of hogs. They
-P-A-G-E-85

are fattened on sugar beets ground up with corn and 
oatmeal, to which is added a little finely chopped clover 
hay. } 
This particular holding emphasized, as side lines of 
production, apple growing, egg production, and bee 
culture. The yield in apples was particularly remark- 
able. Because the land is so limited, dwarf trees are 
grown, set from nine to ten feet apart. Thus Monk’s 
Codlin trees planted in 1908 yielded, in 1912, at the rate 
of 1274 kroner, or $344.60, per acre. Denmark, by the 
way, has recently developed an apple of its own which 
promises to strike the American importer a serious blow. 
This is the famous Pettersen’s Reinette, which combines 
many of the fine qualities of our Stark’s Delicious with 
the keeping qualities of the Gravenstein. 
Mr. Nielsen’s farm was a money-maker because it was 
scientifically handled. In front of the house were beauti- 
ful flower beds in the midst of which stood a number of 
beehives. Immediately at its rear was an interesting 
kitchen garden. The fields received every ounce of 
manure produced on the place and, in addition, a small 
amount of Florida rock phosphates. One half acre 
was devoted to apples and small fruit, an acre and one 
half to mangolds, rutabagas, and sugar beets; the re- 
mainder of the land comprised clover and meadow, 
barley, oats, and a mixture of legumes. The rotation 
employed was the following: (r) barley, (2) mangolds 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  56 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
and sugar beets, (3) legumes for fodder, (4) barley, 
(5) rutabagas, (6) oats, and (7) clover. 
At the house, over a cup of excellent coffee, Mr. 
Nielsen gave his life story. Born of poor parents — 
agricultural day laborers on one of the large estates — 
he had known considerable want in his early years. He, 
himself, following in the father’s footsteps, had become an 
agricultural laborer, accumulating a small sum of money. 
He had been able to take advantage of the good rural 
schools, which placed him in line for land ownership 
when the first Danish smallhold law went into effect in 
1899. With a government loan of five thousand kroner 
he had purchased his seven acres, paying four hundred 
and twelve kroner per acre. The buildings had cost 
him three thousand kroner, and the stock and other 
equipment seventeen hundred kroner. The total initial 
outlay was seventy-five hundred and eighty-four 
kroner, or $2049.70. His balance shéet for the current 
year showed that, aside from giving a good living to the 
family, he had taken in above expenses two thousand 
and sixty-six and five tenths kroner, equivalent to 
$558.51, which must be considered good returns on an 
investment of only $2049.70. It is but fair to add, how- 
ever, that Mr. Nielsen’s balance sheet showed up better 
than the average.

CHAPTER IV’ 
Tue Sociat Lire or RuRAL DENMARK 
Economic Prosperity and Satisfactory Social Life. — 
It is well to realize that two things at least are necessary 
if we would hold a strong population on the soil: first, 
the returns from the land must be commensurate with the 
money and labor invested; second, the daily life on the 
farm must be made socially attractive and wholesome. 
Without these no man can really feel content to remain 
there all his life. This condition is universal. Denmark 
has solved this side of the question largely through its 
schools. In our own country many farmers are becom- 
ing wealthy and are freer from care than are their city 
brothers; but the fact remains, nevertheless, that if one 
leaves out of consideration the unearned increment in 
land values, American farmers are not, on the average, 
getting as large returns as they should have on the invest- 
ment made, This has caused considerable shifting about 
from place to place, often leading to the abandonment 
of the farm for town. : 
Even when agriculture is made more profitable than 
is usually the case now, this alone will not be sufficient 
inducement to keep people in country districts. The 
57  
-P-A-G-E-88
  
  58 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
social life of the farm must contain all the elements that 
normal human beings crave. If the simplest social sat- 
isfactions are wanting, country people are sure to go 
where they can get them. This is, perhaps, one of the 
most aggravated causes for much moving away from 
the farm in some sections of the United States to-day. 
Denmark is centuries old and has either long ago 
mastered, or perhaps never had, many of the problems of 
everyday social life that American farmers must contend 
with. The American people have settled an empire in a 
few short generations, bringing, as it were, an old civiliza- 
tion with them. The European nations have evolved 
slowly and painfully, checked first by the beasts of the 
forests, then by human enemies, plagues, and what not. 
The United States has become settled in spite of, or, at 
least, unchecked by, all such enemies. But we are 
young upon the prairies, and plains, and mountain sides ; 
and vast distances, and comparative isolation, family 
from family, make the task of thorough socialization 
comparatively slow and difficult. 
A Social Life in Harmony with its Natural Environ- 
ment. — The first thing to strike one forcibly in the study 
of Danish rural life is that this life accords and harmonizes 
with the environment in which the people live. Our 
great country life worker, L. H. Bailey, says in one of 
his books that ‘‘ the country man must be able to interest 
himself spiritually in his own native environment as his
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE SOCIAL LIFE OF RURAL DENMARK 59 
chief resource of power and happiness.” ! This is what 
Danish country folk do. Their first love is for the soil. 
They understand in good measure the meaning of the 
phrase that the soil is holy. Whether it is on account of 
the forethought of their leaders or just because the world 
moves more’ slowly on that side of the Atlantic, — it is 
hard to say which, — at any rate, we could find none of 
your enthusiasts over there trying to transplant every 
form of city entertainment to country districts, to keep 
farmers from moving to-town. There is often grave 
danger of overdoing country life affairs by trying to 
transplant bodily — as some of our reformers would do 
— the cheap social‘ life of the town to the open country. 
This Danish love of nature takes form in flowers and 
shrubbery, in small formal gardens with their graveled 
walks and vine-clad arbors. Life is not so strenuous as 
with us—and this has both its good and bad sides ; 
but, at any rate, the farmer finds time for more than 
merely work from starlight to starlight to accumulate 
an abundance of this world’s goods. With his wife he 
has time for more than ‘a wearisome round of labor, of 
eating and drinking, of saving and skimping, of doing 
without farm ¢éonveniences and household helps — 
solely to make money.’ Not: that this is intended as 
a general charge against the American farmers, for no 
farmers in the world live better than ours, wherever 
+ “The State and the Farmer,” p. 65. :
-P-A-G-E-90

they have the right outlook on life; but it is a great 
thing, after all, in the midst of the workaday struggle, 
to be able to sit:down in the midst of one’s flowers and 
rest, without worrying about the cabbages and the pigs 
all the time — and this is true of the average housewife 
in rural Denmark. * 
Feast Days ‘and Hospitality. — ‘The country home is 
made as attractive as the owner’s means will permit. If 
anything, many Danish rural folk stretch their incomes 
to the breaking point, in order to show their hospitality. 
Such seasons as Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, are 
celebrated with great festivities, never to be forgotten 
by those so fortunate as to be partakers. Seed time 
and harvest, also, have their own rollicking merry- 
makings. The hearth is no longer the literal fireplace, 
but it is still in spirit the center of the rural home. Of an 
evening one can still hear song and folklore dispensed as 
of old. Many of the household industries, which with 
us have long ago passed away, are still doing much to 
hold the family group together and are still giving the 
head, heart, and hand education that we have begun to 
reintroduce through such school subjects as manual 
training and household economics. 
Trained Artisans Important Factors in Rural Social 
Life. — Rural Denmark has, as was stated above, a 
double social life. First, there are the farmers who 
devote their time to the soil; and, second, the country 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
    THE SOCIAL LIFE OF RURAL DENMARK 61 
artisans — such as blacksmiths, wheelwrights, cobblers, 
weavers, and short-time laborers — who are trained in 
the schools for country occupations. ‘This really gives a 
twofold social life to the country. Some of the folk high 
schools and local agricultural schools offer carefully 
planned courses for young men who will cast their lot 
as builders and small-scale manufacturers with the 
villages and open country. But the special schools for 
smallholders offer, perhaps, the most attractive and 
practical courses for this group of workers. Some of 
the smallholders who have secured their few acres through 
government or credit union assistance combine some 
form of artisanship with small farming, thereby enhanc- 
ing their incomes materially. The artisanship influence 
has certainly tended to keep the rural social life from 
becoming monotonous through one-sidedness and same- 
ness of routine. * 
One cannot help but believe that there was more real 
sociability in our American farm communities in the 
early times than now — at the time before the passing 
of the barn raising, the quilting, the husking bee, the 
singing school, and the folk dance. These have gone 
for good and always, and the trouble is that the schools 
and the other organizations which must furnish the 
modern substitutes have not yet been able to do so. 
Significance of Church and School. — All of the every- 
day life of the Danish country people is lived around or
-P-A-G-E-92

62 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
at the common community center; that is, their every- 
day activities, their thoughts, their life plans, are all 
centered in the work of the two great country institutions 
—the school and the church. And, when the Ls 
“centered ” is employed, this embraces not alone the 
immediate work of the church and school, but all the in- 
fluences for better life that indirectly emanate from them. 
At the crossroads or on the edge of the quaint old 
hamlet lies the schoolmaster’s house, a rambling place, 
neatly kept without and within. Flowers, graveled 
walks, and rustic seats fill the front yard. To the rear, 
are a vegetable garden and an experimental plot, in 
which the schoolmaster and the children work oak day 
to day, side by side, while the earth preaches sermons 
for their ears, making them love to live close to nature’s 
heart. Then there is the schoolhouse, in ample grounds, 
just beyond. Here, too, the love of nature is apparent, 
both in planting and in growing things. The school- 
master dwells in the midst of his people twelve months 
out of the year. In this way he learns to know take 
becoming a more and more useful community force, able 
and competent to give assistance in practical farm life 
affairs. 
Just, beyond the schoolyard lies the fine old manse or 
parsonage and the century-old stone church, which is 
never lacking in a Danish rural community. Just as the 
schoolmaster lives in the midst of his people, honored 
   
-P-A-G-E-93
  THE SOCIAL LIFE OF RURAL DENMARK 63 
and revered, so the pastor dwells in the midst of his 
flock, ministering to them, baptizing them, marrying 
them and, finally, burying them in the graveyard out 
beyond the church. There can be no question of dying 
country churches in a community where such a pastor 
labors. He is a scholarly man ; he has studied the needs 
of his people; and now he has rightfully taken his place 
as spiritual leader and adviser who, together with the 
schoolmaster, gives the country community the high 
level of idealism necessary in order to keep pace with 
the progress made at the industrial centers. 
a often hears the statement that “the Danish 
farmer leans for support with one shoulder on the school- 
house and the other on the church while plowing his 
fields.”") For all this he is not much of a Puritan. He 
attends church zealously enough on Sunday morning, 
_ but follows the continental European custom of making 
the afternoon a time of amusement and entertainment. 
Most of this is devoted to innocent neighborly calls. 
Many spend the time in field and forest with lunch 
basket on one arm and the family, figuratively speaking, 
on the other. In a few backward places one can still 
find drinking and carousing; but this is less frequent 
than it used to be. 
Wholesome Recreative Life. — It may be well at this 
point to be more specific as to what Danish country 
people do for recreation.
-P-A-G-E-94
  64 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
First of all, they sing. The music is not classic by any 
means; but it keeps alive an emotionalism and love of 
rhythmic movement that saves the somewhat phlegmatic 
Scandinavian farmer from his own mysticism. Folk 
songs and patriotic songs are sung everywhere and are 
known by heart. Even the long, slowly swinging church 
hymns are favorites at all sorts of gatherings and speak 
well for the religious tone of the community. 
Athletics are next held in high esteem. The schools, as 
has been said, all teach physical education in the form of 
gymnastics and play, from the first years of the pNor 
tary schools up through the entire system. The young 
men and women who have graduated from the advanced 
rural schools continue these physical activities all their 
lives, in the community gymnasium. Nothing can be 
more striking than to see, as one commonly does in 
rural districts, white-haired old men turn somersaults 
and handsprings as limberly as the young folks. And 
why not? Is it not true that a man is young just about 
as long as he acts young? These farmers seem to have 
the same love of personal prowess that marke their 
Viking forefathers of some centuries back. Ring rid- 
ing— a form of horseback tourney —is a favorite pas- 
time, especially during Lenten week. Each season of the 
year, indeed, has its favorite pastime. Of the seasonal 
gatherings none is more enjoyable than the Hést Gilde 
or Harvest Festival. When the last sheaf is tied, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE SOCIAL LIFE OF RURAL DENMARK 65 
harvesters, both men and women, march in triumph to 
the largest granary on the place, which has been made 
festive with garlands and flowers. Here the good house- 
wife has a great feast spread for them. Later comes sing- 
ing of folk songs, with dancing and play games on the 
green. Occasionally a little discord may be injected 
into the rollicking fun by the dispensing of intoxicants, 
but this is getting less and less frequent. 
The monthly market day plays a great réle in the 
recreative life of the country folk. It is much like the 
annual country festival day that is now being introduced 
so successfully by country life leaders in some of our 
states. The chief difference is, in Denmark the gatherings 
come twelve times a year. First of all, the market is 
the “clearing house” for the extra stock that may have 
accumulated at the farm place. Long lines of horses, 
cows, and sheep may beseen, up and down the village 
street, under the inspection of critical buyers. But 
there are sports and games, feasting and dancing, and 
meeting of old friends, and, occasionally, too much 
drinking of beer. With all due allowance for the 
latter the market gatherings do much to bind the coun- 
try folk in common ties and to satisfy the many soul 
cravings which nothing short of city glamour and glare 
could otherwise fill. ee 
Aside from what has been mentioned here, the rural 
teachers and pastors do much for organized recreation, 
F 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  66 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
which tends to offset many counter attractions away from 
the soil. Lecture courses, extension courses, gatherings 
of young and old people at the assembly halls for such 
occasions as the narration of Norse myths and fairy 
tales, — all come within this field of work. 
Dearth of Rural Recreation in the United States. — 
At this point it is well to consider a law of labor and 
recreation which must always be reckoned with, whether 
one lives in country or town. It can be stated briefly 
in these words? Systematic labor must always react in 
organized recreation. 7 That is to say, whenever the 
human being is tied down to hours of self-repression, his 
body craves a certain amount of relaxation to be sought in 
play or amusement of some sort. If this is wisely pro- 
vided, all will go well; if ignored as unnecessary and 
wasteful, the person affected will be sure to seek relief 
or an outlet for his pent-up desires in questionable ways 
and places. 
Acting upon this principle, factory owners and other 
great corporations in the United States, employing many 
laborers, are beginning to furnish their employees 
attractive recreation, such as individual gardens, play- 
grounds equipped for baseball, volley ball and croquet, 
swimming pools, reading rooms and social chat rooms. 
Now our country folk have had no such organized recrea- 
tion to speak of, to offset their natural cravings. As a 
result, great numbers of young men and women of the
-P-A-G-E-97
THE SOCIAL LIFE OF RURAL DENMARK 67 
convivial type and strongly developed social instincts 
have abandoned the country for the towns and cities 
in search of just these things. 
Let us remember, it is generally the lack of spiritual 
things as much as a lack of material things that attracts 
the youth to the city glamour. How often could not the 
condition that the poet here besings have been escaped 
had we only recognized the fundamental craving of the 
youthful soul for recreation : 
“The old farm home is Mother’s yet and mine, 
And filled it is with plenty and to spare, 
But we are lonely here in life’s decline, 
Though fortune smiles around us everywhere; 
We look across the gold 
Of the harvests, as of old — 
The corn, the fragrant clover, and the hay; 
But most we turn our gaze 
As with eyes of other days, 
To the orchard where the children used to play.”

THE WORK OF THE RURAL SCHOOLS IN THE 
NATIONAL REORGANIZATION 
CHAPTER V 
Tue System oF EDUCATION IN GENERAL OUTLINE 
The Schools that have made this Agricultural Pros- 
perity Possible. — To say that the rural schools of Den- 
mark, unaided by other forces, are solely responsible 
for this great measure of agricultural prosperity might, 
perhaps, be difficult to substantiate. The spur of 
necessity, we have learned, had a great deal to do with 
making the beginnings of the movement. Patriotic 
men rose up and organized the forces at their disposal 
as best they could; but, without the broad general intel- 
ligence furnished through the remarkable system of new 
rural schools, the peasantry would have been in no condi- 
tion to receive and profit by the progressive propaganda 
of their leaders. These schools are, indeed, organized asa 
part of the movement and stand, therefore, in the relation 
both of cause and effect; for, while brought into being 
68
-P-A-G-E-99
SYSTEM OF EDUCATION IN GENERAL OUTLINE 69 
  or at least revitalized and perfected through the same 
necessity which made patriotic men and women come to 
the rescue of the fatherland, the schools alone could bring 
the system to full fruition by making education available 
to every man, woman, and child in rural districts. The 
schools that brought all this to pass may be classified as 
rural elementary schools, folk high schools, local agricul- 
tural schools, rural schools of household economics, and 
special schools for smallholders. 
The rural elementary schools of Denmark emphasize 
to a remarkable degree the fundamental school subjects 
and do the work in them in a most thoroughgoing fash- 
ion; but at the same time they have seen the way 
clear to root the entire course of study to the soil in such 
a way that they are able to inculcate in the pupils love of 
soil tilling as a life calling. 
The folk high schools, which are Denmark’s unique 
contribution to education, have gone farther by actually 
disseminating a peasant culture throughout the agricul- 
tural communities which has freed the peasantry from 
city domination until they now practically control the 
country both economically and politically. According 
to the testimony of prominent Danish leaders, the great 
agricultural victories of modern times were won through 
the work of these so-called schools for grown-up people. 
Their finest work is the development of character which, 
these leaders find, forms the basis for the whole future
-P-A-G-E-100
  7o RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
development of the nation. The mutual trust that the 
schools teach has made the entire movement of codpera- 
tive enterprise in the kingdom possible. Without this 
trust in one another the farmers’ credit societies could 
not exist; nor could the thousands of ba on factories, 
dairies, and buying and selling associations carry on 
their splendid work. 
The folk high schools, then, accomplish their ends 
through the building of noble character and stimulating 
it to the loftiest idealism. Still other institutions, under 
the name of rural agricultural schools and rural schools of 
household economics, lay their emphasis more particu- 
larly on the theory of scientific agriculture and practical 
home making, thus preparing the way for the applica- 
tion of these theories at home on the farm. These 
schools may be considered, in a way, as continuation 
schools for the folk high schools, since practically all 
accredited schools of this kind demand attendance at 
one of the folk high schools as a requirement for entrance. 
Finally, a special kind of school is organized for smallhold 
farmers to aid them in the difficult problem of making a 
living out of a few acres of land — a thing which would 
be utterly impossible were it not for the well-systematized 
training offered in these schools. } 
The Free Elementary Schools. —The scheme of 
education for farm life begins with the free elementary 
schools, and is, thereafter, continued part of the time in
-P-A-G-E-101
  SYSTEM OF EDUCATION IN GENERAL OUTLINE 7t 
the classroom and part of the time in practical outside 
work until all has been mastered that is essential. to suc- 
cess in agriculture. The elementary schools are com- 
pulsory from the age of,seven to fourteen, although many 
children enter school at six. The compulsory attendance 
laws are enforced under such rigid regulations that practi- 
cally no children of school age evade them. The schools 
are taught by mature, professional teachers who devote 
their lives to work in the country. The uniform 
thoroughness which marks the elementary rural schools 
ds clearly explainable in well-trained teachers of long 
tenure in the same community. These teachers are well 
paid and content with their lot; they rank high socially 
and in most instances make use of their opportunities 
to become community leaders and organizers. Under 
such teachers — a large majority of them are men — the 
children complete the first seven or eight grades of school 
work, in which great emphasis is laid on the mother 
tongue, mathematics, and other essential subjects, to- 
gether with religious instruction, nature study, music, 
and gymnastics. At fourteen or fifteen years of age 
most Danish children are confirmed in the State Church, 
ending the responsibility of the State so far as free in- 
struction is concerned — a fact which would seem a great 
weakness in the system were it not for the many Govern- 
ment-aided continuation schools open to every worthy 
farm boy or girl.
-P-A-G-E-102
  72 1 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
The Period of Physical Growth. — After leaving the 
free elementary schools a few of the children immediately 
enter the Middle Schools, which are found in every one 
of the organized towns; and those children eventually 
make their way through the Gymnasia and Real Skoler 
to the National University or the National Polytechnic 
Institute. But the rural children who go the so-called 
learned way are not many compared with those who 
remain on the farm. And yet, the latter are not left 
without further opportunity for study. While it is true 
that some of the laborers’ children go to work immedi- 
ately upon leaving the elementary school or have to be 
satisfied with evening school instruction, nevertheless 
a much larger number, relatively, take advantage of 
continuation schools than in the United States. This is 
borne out by statistics which — for 1906 — show that 
33 per cent of all young men and a slightly smaller num- 
ber of young women of eighteen years and over attend the 
folk, high schools for a longer or shorter period, while 
14 per cent of the young men attend special agricultural 
schools in addition to the agricultural studies offered in 
many of the folk high schools, and a considerable number 
of young women attend special schools of domestic 
science. All of these institutions are situated in the 
open country. 
Pupils are not accepted at the above-mentioned schools 
before the candidate for admission has reached eighteen
-P-A-G-E-103
  SYSTEM OF EDUCATION IN GENERAL OUTLINE 73 
years of age. There is then a period of four years after 
leaving the elementary school for which an accounting 
must be made. Danish thinkers are pretty well satisfied 
that these years of adolescence should be devoted par- 
ticularly to physical development and practical tasks 
rather than to classroom routine. They call attention 
to the fact that during this period of growth — of change 
from youth to young manhood — the physical in the 
human being seems to have the upper hand, and intellec- 
tual attainments are acquired under compulsion chiefly 
and often at the sacrifice of health. Therefore, with 
them this is essentially a period of work and play. The 
children then learn practical agriculture and household 
duties at home; or, better still, are apprenticed to learn 
these at recognized model farms, where they get the 
benefits of the knowledge of “ control assistants” or 
specialists in farm science, maintained in the field at 
State and local expense. 
It is quite common to pay for the privilege of working 
on these model farms. But time is also given for play 
and gymnastics. It is compulsory to give instruction 
in gymnastics in the elementary schools. This is con- 
tinued in all the folk and agricultural schools. More- 
over, almost every country community has its local 
gymnastic organization and usually its own assembly 
hall and gymnasium. Here the youth while out of 
school, and their fathers for that matter, assemble fre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  74 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
quently and take their physical exercise under able 
leaders. In this way the years pass, and the youth are 
ready for the folk high schools. 
The Folk High Schools and the Culture Period. — 
The folk high schools are essentially schools for mature 
young people. The Danes speak of them as schools 
for “ grown-ups,” and the term is appropriate, since one 
finds there students from eighteen to twenty-five and 
even older. The schools are not high schools in the 
American sense of that term, nor are they “ poor men’s 
_ universities,” as some writers have denominated them, 
for the students, while mainly from farming communities, 
‘come from every walk in life and from the homes of the 
well-to-do and the poor alike. In general, they are 
schools for mature young people, whose main object is 
development of personal’ character rather than the 
giving of specialized instruction. To these schools come 
the young people after a period of rest from intellectual 
labor, strong in body, full of hope, and eager to learn. 
They are zealous to realize the best in life — to know 
themselves and the purpose of life. To be more specific, 
th¢ aims of the schools are : 
(t) To make a broad-minded, moral citizenship; 
(2) to foster a deep-seated love of the soil and native land ; 
(3) to give a correct outlook on agricultural life; (4) to 
free the people from class domination and show them how 
best to utilize their growing political power: (5) to lay
-P-A-G-E-105
SYSTEM OF EDUCATION IN GENERAL OUTLINE 75 
a broad cultural foundation for the technical subjects to 
be pursued in the local agricultural schools; and (6) to 
prepare the young people to face intelligently the great 
struggle for existence that presses hard on all alike in the 
older European countries. 
Very few of the schools are coeducational. The schools 
for young men are in session for five or six months, 
usually beginning with November. The young women 
then attend the same schools from three to five months 
during the summer season. The work is based upon 
lectures rather than textbooks. The success of the school 
is therefore dependent upon the ability of the teachers to 
inspire and instruct; and this calls for carefully trained 
teachers. 
The Local Agricultural and Household Economics 
Schools and Scientific Training. — The young people 
spend one, two, or even more terms at one or another of 
the local agricultural schools or, in the case of young 
women, the rural schools of household economics. 
Young men who have had practical experience in farm 
pursuits before entering the folk high school usually go 
immediately from the latter to one of the agricultural 
schools, of which there are twenty-nine scattered over 
the country. In case such practical training is lacking, 
it must be secured at one of the Government-recognized 
model farms before they can matriculate at the agricul- 
tural schools. These latter teach primarily the theory 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  76 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
of agriculture, land surveying, agricultural chemistry, 
and the other sciences which underlie the practice of 
agriculture. Since the students are already what might 
be called practical farmers, the aim of the agricultural 
schools is “to connect the principles of agricultural 
science with practical facts and to render their daily 
work more attractive to them than before by trans- 
forming their ‘knowing how’ into ‘ understanding 
why.’ ” : 
Strong schools of household economics, located in the 
open country, furnish young women a counterpart of 
what the agricultural schools are doing for the young 
men. It is conceded that the women who are destined 
to become helpmeets for the scientific young farmers 
must themselves understand how to manage the farm 
households economically and scientifically, Such de- 
mands the schools strive to supply. The folk high 
schools have long taught these subjects as incidental to 
genuine farm culture, and particularly have they laid 
great stress upon needlework and embroidery. But 
the new schools of household economics address them- 
selves exclusively to the science of housewifery. 
Special Schools for Smallhold Farmers. — Peculiar 
schools organized particularly for the smallhold farmers 
are the so-called Husmandsskoler. These combine the 
most valuable features of the folk high schools with 
those of the agricultural schools and make a strong  
-P-A-G-E-107
SYSTEM OF EDUCATION IN GENERAL OUTLINE 77 
point of short courses for smallholders of any age or 
preparation, no matter how old or how poorly prepared. 
The side lines of agriculture—such as bee culture, 
chicken raising, rabbit breeding — receive much atten- 
tion. Indeed, any smallholder with a problem, it 
matters not what, may enter these schools and obtain 
the desired assistance. 
Young men who desire to join the large class of Govern- 
ment experts in dairying, swine culture, and like occupa- 
tion, may procure their final preparation by spending 
one or more years in study and experimentation at the 
Royal Veterinary and Agricultural Institute located in 
Copenhagen. 
The most important task performed by educationists 
in Denmark has been to impart a remarkably large stor€ 
of culture without giving the people a contempt: for. 
work with the hands. The system outlined above has 
done much to ennoble manual work in the estimation . 
of the people and to heighten their ability to do the work.

  A. THE ELEMENTARY RURAL SCHOOLS 
CHAPTER VI 
THEIR ORGANIZATION, ADMINISTRATION, AND MaIn- 
TENANCE 
History of the Elementary Rural Schools. — The 
common people of Denmark had only the most meager 
opportunities for schooling prior to the seventeenth 
century, when the great “ pietistic”’ reform movement 
forced the organization of a free public school system. 
At that time, it has been estimated, 80 per cent of all the 
people living in the country and 4o per cent of those 
living in town could neither read nor write. Now, on 
the other hand, less than one tenth of one per cent 
of all the people are illiterate. The year 1739 marked 
the first definite steps in public school organization. 
In accordance with Royal promulgation of that year 
schools were to be opened in every commune, and parents 
and legal guardians were admonished to send the children 
to ‘the schools. King Frederik IV erected some two 
hundred and forty schools for this purpose; but trained 
teachers were scarce and times were hard so that much 
less came out of the law than had been hoped.

THEIR ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 79 
  The first real advance in educational affairs came 
through the Ordinance of 1814, which immediately raised 
Denmark as a model among European nations in educa- 
tional affairs. The new law made school attendance 
compulsory between the ages of seven and fourteen and 
enforced attendance through a system of fines. Definite 
salaries and pensions were provided. Steps were taken to 
give the teachers a reasonable professional training, and 
these, in turn, became assured of permanent “ calls ” to 
long-tenure positions. The schools were maintained en- 
tirely by the local communes. Instruction was obliga- 
tory in the religious subjects Bible, Bible history, cate- 
chism, and religious hymns — in reading, writing, arith- 
metic, singing, and gymnastics (for boys). 
he supervision of the schools was ineffective until 
after 1848, when the Ministry of Education and Ecclesias- 
tical Affairs became the central authority in all educa- 
tional affairs. In 1856 a new law was passed under 
which the state began to defray a part of the school 
expenses, such as salary increases and direct aid to weak 
communes. In 1899 teachers’ salaries were materially 
increased and teacher training greatly improved. The 
inner management of the schools and course of study 
were also bettered. In 1908 still another new salary 
law went into effect. This was so liberal as to make the 
position of rural teacher very attractive and sought after. 
In most particulars the management of fhe elementary
-P-A-G-E-110

schools is left to the local communes under state super- 
vision. : 
The following table gives numbers of children of school 
age, school enrollment in public and private schools, and 
number and sex of teachers. It is compiled from the 
latest official data, January 1, 1911:

It will appear from the table that both public and 
private schools are maintained in rural communities, 
1 In addition to these there are about 700 teachers in private elementary 
schools in rural districts. 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
THEIR ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 81 
although the latter are found only in comparatively 
small numbers. The private schools are state supervised 
and must maintain certain required standards of work. 
Of all the children of school age only three hundred and 
seventy, or one tenth of one per cent, failed to attend 
school during the year. The number of men teachers is 
much larger than that of the women teachers, although 
the number of the latter has been on the rapid increase 
the last few years. This has not been at the expense 
of the men teachers who, by actual numerical count, are 
on the increase. The explanation lies in the large 
number of primary schools (Forskoler) that are being 
established, requiring the services of women teachers. 
Compulsory education ends with the close of the ele- 
mentary school as does also free instruction. In the 
tural districts several kinds of private continuation 
schools flourish. In effect they are “ free” schools, 
‘since the Government gives the schools liberal aid and 
even subsidizes worthy students. 'Night schools are 
maintained (z91z) in eleven hundred and fifty rural 
communities for pupils who have completed the ele- 
mentary schools, but cannot afford to attend the regular 
farmers’ continuation schools — the folk high schools, 
local agricultural schools, and schools of household 
economies. 
Rural children who may desire an education other 
than for farm life usually enter the Middle Schools of 
G

the incorporated towns immediately upon completing 
the elementary course.) There they may continue their 
study through the Gymnasia or Real Skoler to the 
National University, or the National Polytechnic In- 
stitute. Or they may earlier branch off into the various 
technical schools, trade schools, schools of navigation, 
and schools of similar nature. 
Ministry of Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs the 
Head of the National School System. — Since 1848 the 
administration of public education has been vested in the 
Ministry of Education. This department issues all 
necessary administrative circulars and bulletins for the 
direction of school authorities, including general rules 
and regulations for the schools. The authority of the 
Ministry may be classified as direct and appellate. 
Certain school matters must be decided by the Ministry ; 
others may be settled by it on appeal from lower author- 
ity. Under the former head the Ministry has sole 
authority in all questions of teachers’ salaries, pensions, 
and increases (except as limited by law), and in the en- 
forcement of courses of study together with changes in 
same. Likewise ministerial sanction must be obtained 
before new schools are established, although the com- 
munal authorities may be a unit in favor of the proposed 
schools. 
In a general way these are the powers and duties of the 
Ministry of Education: to interpret and enforce all
-P-A-G-E-113
THEIR ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 83 
educational codes passed by the National Rigsdag; to 
prescribe rules and regulations for the schools; to decide 
questions of difference which may risein lower administra- 
tive circles; and to recommend needed school legislation. 
The Ministry of Education has in its employ a national 
“konsulent ” or educational specialist who gives advice 
on legal questions coming up for decision. He may also 
propose improvements and alterations in the school 
system. Other educational specialists attached to the 
Ministry, who give it expert advice in addition to having 
the national supervision in their several departments, 
are general inspectors of music, gymnastics, sloyd, and 
drawing. 
In this way enough of the administrative machinery is 
centered in the general government to assure uniformity 
in educational effort. 
The Church in School Administration. — From times 
immemorial, almost, bishops, deans, and local ministers 
have had active part in school administration. These 
men have naturally exerted a powerful influence in 
school affairs because they were, then as now, with few 
exceptions, the best-equipped men in their respective 
districts for just such work. 
The bishops were expected, under the Law of 1814, to, 
have close supervision over the schools within their re- 
spective bishoprics. To this end they may require 
regular reports from the deanery boards and the local 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
           84 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
boards of education. In the olden time the bishops were 
accustomed to assemble the parish children at the church 
and there examine them “in Godly and worldly learn- 
ing.” Later this inspection of educational matters was 
transferred to the school building. Of recent years the 
bishops have become satisfied to delegate the immediate 
school inspection to the deans and local ministers, while 
they still require regular reports from the several school 
boards. 
An Interrelated System of School Directories and 
School Boards. — The schools are administered, for con- 
venience, with the various political and religious units 
as bases. In this way each of the nineteen amts or mu- 
nicipal subdivisions has its amt school directory. Each 
of the seventy-three deaneries has its deanery board 
of education. Finally, each of the eleven hundred and 
thirty-four country communes or parishes has its own 
school commission working under the direction of the 
parish council. 
The Amt School Directory is a superior body com- 
prising representatives from each of the deanery direc- 
tories or boards of education within the amt. Its chief 
function is to administer the school funds of the amt and 
certain other matters dealing with school maintenance 
which cannot wisely be intrusted to minor boards. 
Even this directory is not given free hands to administer 
the funds as it might deem best. Every amt school
-P-A-G-E-115
    
THEIR ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 85 
directory is held in check and assisted in its tasks by 
an amt school council, which draws its membership from 
the regularly constituted municipal council. This ar- 
rangement gives assurance that the school funds will 
be administered according to practical business prin- 
ciples, since these two boards are pretty sure to have in 
their membership some of the ablest men in the mu- 
nicipality. 
The Deanery School Directory or Board of Education 
is the most important link between the Ministry of Edu- 
cation and the local communal boards. The latter can 
reach the Ministry through the deanery board only, 
while the Ministry in its turn administers all local affairs 
through the medium of the deanery board. The man- 
agement of many matters of local concern is delegated 
to the final decision of the deanery board by ministerial 
decree or even by law. The supervision of the schools 
is one of the board’s most important duties. Though, 
in practice, the dean alone visits the schools, he is obliged 
to make full reports to the Ministry of Education, from 
time to time, on blanks,furnished for that purpose. The 
deanery board as a whole must finally file with the Min- 
istry an annual report of school matters within the 
deanery, together with recommendations and suggestions 
for educational improvement. 
The Communal or Parish School Commission has the 
practical administration of all the schools within the 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  86 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
parish. The commission comprises the parish pastor 
and members chosen from the parish council. The local 
pastor is charged especially with school supervision. In 
matters concerning financial expenditure the school 
commission becomes subordinated to the parish council, 
which in such matters has the final word. 
All the school directories and commissions are inter- 
related to a remarkable degree, and their duties and re- 
sponsibilities are divided so as to secure the best results 
in school administration. By way of illustration, 
matters of school maintenance are mainly in the charge 
of the large amt school directories; but these are ame- 
nable to suggestions from the deanery directories and 
requests from the local parish councils and school com- 
missions. In extreme cases they may even be regulated 
by the Ministry of Education. School supervision is 
governed in much the same way. 
“The Ministry supervises the schools through its ed- 
ucational specialists; the bishops supervise the schools 
within the bishopric occasionally in person, though gen- 
erally through subordinates; the dean is charged with 
visitation and school inspection of all deanery schools; 
and, finally, the local school commission, headed by 
the local pastor, supervises the two or more parish 
schools. 
How the Elementary Schools are Maintained. — The 
Danish system of taxation for school purposes is based
-P-A-G-E-117
  THEIR ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 87 
on the principle that the entire people is vitally interested 
in the education of every individual in the kingdom. 
Education is both of national and local concern; there- 
fore, both nation and local community must bear their 
proportionate shares of the cost. As the result of a 
hundred years of careful effort the system is now pretty 
well balanced. The state for its part pays sufficiently 
to equalize educational advantages throughout the na- 
tion, and the smaller units enough to keep alive and 
foster local interest in school affairs and to develop the 
greatest measure of local independence and self-reliance. 
The maintenance of the rural school may advantageously 
be discussed under three heads: (r) state aid; (2) per- 
manent funds; and (3) local taxation. 
State Aid in School Maintenance. — The general 
government extends financial assistance in a number of 
ways to induce to greater educational effort and effi- 
ciency. The aid comes to the community as reward for 
good work already begun — work sometimes voluntarily 
undertaken, sometimes under the compulsion of legal 
enactment. — 
According to the Ordinance of 1908, the state shall 
extend annual aid to districts which have bonded them- 
selves for the construction of new buildings, including 
gymnasiums and teachers’ homes, or which have re- 
modeled old buildings, in compliance with law. This 
aid shall in no case exceed four hundred and fifty kroner 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  88 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
annually, and must be used only in paying interest on 
and reducing the face of the indebtedness. 
By all odds the largest state aid is for teachers’ sal- 
aries. As-was stated elsewhere, the general Government 
obligates itself to pay all the increases in teachers’ sal- 
aries above the initial salary paid by the communes. 
Furthermore, one half of the entire amount paid for 
old-age pensions comes from the general treasury. The 
balance comes from the permanent amt fund. 
Considerable sums are also used in the purchase and 
maintenance of school libraries and teachers’ libraries. 
The evening schools, of which many hundred are in 
operation in rural communities, too, are maintained 
through Government aid. 
Finally, the state extends direct aid to needy com- 
munes, and even refunds one half of the total amount 
that the permanent amt fund may annually use for 
needy communes within the amt. Just what per cent 
of the total amount of school maintenance is defrayed 
by the state is difficult to say, as there are no statistics 
available, but it is very considerable. 
Permanent School Funds. — As early as 1814 a per- 
manent fund was organized, the chief aim of which was 
to extend aid to needy teachers. These funds canie 
through direct amt taxes, through assessments on the 
teachers, and in large part from the sale of certain school 
buildings and school lands which were no longer needed
-P-A-G-E-119
  THEIR ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 89 
in the reorganized school system. In 1856 the teachers’ 
aid feature was abolished and teachers were no longer 
expected to pay their quota to the fund, the purpose 
being to aid and promote education within the amt. 
The invested moneys now have their source in the sale 
of certain school “ lots,” fines, and direct appropriations 
by the amt council. The fund is administered by the 
amt school directory in conjunction with the amt school 
council, which draws its membership from the regularly 
constituted amt council. This gives assurance of able 
administration of the funds. 
The general purpose of the permanent amt fund is to 
equalize educational opportunities within the amt by 
tendering aid to the several communes according to need. 
In addition, all state aid is paid directly into this fund, 
and from it to the several school districts. 
One half the amount of the old-age pensions within 
the amts is defrayed from the permanent fund. The 
pay for certain provisional teachers not otherwise pro- 
vided for likewise is drawn from this source. In addition 
to all this, the fund may aid in maintaining schools in 
household economics and evening schools, if there are 
sufficient funds on hand. 
Local Taxation. — The chief source of school mainte- 
- nance is, after all, from local taxation. The commune 
with its several school districts is the basis. This would 
be a pretty small tax unit, and scarcely to be trusted with
-P-A-G-E-120
  RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 90. 
When such important legislation, were it not that the Com- 
munal Council and School Commission are guided pretty 
closely by the Deanery School Directory and Ministry 
of Education. Asa matter of fact, national and amt aid 
depend almost solely upon the wisdom shown in voting 
and expending local funds. And any attempt at unwise 
expenditure would immediately be checked by higher 
authority, the same as wise and liberal expenditure receives 
its encouragement and reward in the form of State aid. 
The commune is obligated with the general maintenance 
of the local schools, such as erecting the necessary build- 
ings and keeping them in repair, furnishing all necessary 
school furniture, and paying the original salaries of per- 
manent teachers and regular assistant teachers.

TuerR MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 
School Attendance. — This is compulsory between the 
ages of seven and fourteen. Time is counted from the 
beginning of the first half year of school immediately 
after the child has completed the seventh year and ends 
with the close of the half year of school during which the 
child has completed the fourteenth year: Abnormal 
children and others affected with infectious disease do 
not come under this ruling. They are cared for in sep- 
arate schools governed by other regulations. Children 
may, however, be received in the schools as soon as they 
have reached the age of six years. A large number take 
advantage of this concession. 
The recent increase in numbers of rural children of 
school age is considerable when the total population is 
taken into consideration. The annual increase is ma- 
terially larger than in Copenhagen and the provincial 
towns. The numbers of school age for 1909, 1910, and 
1g11 were respectively: 255,681, 258,888, and 261,518.

A glance at the table shows that a large majority of 
the children of school age are in school. Only six hun- 
dred and forty-three children were unaccounted for 
during the year. Table I, giving statistics for 1orr, 
makes a still bettersks _, with only three hundred and 
seventy children un sunted for. A large majoricy 
are in the public schools. Those in private schools are 
chiefl;’ children of ue country gentry who have not yet 
overcome their prejudices against “ free ‘schools.” The 
seve: 1 thousand instructed at home are children of 
wealthy parents, some of them of the old nobility, pre- 
paring for admission to the “ learned schools ” in Copen- 
hagen. But whether instructed at home, in private or 
public schools, such instruction is enforced during the 
compulsory period, without fear or favor, upon all alike. 
All children must be able to show certificate of successful 
vaccination when they enroll in school. 
Enforcement of the Compulsory Attendance Law. — 
As a rule the Danish people are so imbued with the value 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
MANAGEMENT AND METHODS: OF INSTRUCTION 93 
of education that they will go to any extremity to keep 
the children in school. Or where this may not be the case 
the wholesome respect for law will hold them from dis- 
obeying it. The few who persist in avoiding their legal 
responsibilities are punished so severely that they are, as 
a tule, glad enough to change their ways. 
The head teacher in every rural school is charged 
with the task of keeping a complete record of all the 
children of school age within the district. This other- 
wise arduous duty is simplified by a requirement of law 
that parents and guardians must give notice to the parish 
council one week before they intend to withdraw their 
children from school when m~ “~~ away from the parish. 
whe same kind of notice musi ae +ven the authorities 
of the parish to which the family’ Thoves, in order that 
the children may be properly reco." “d and no time lost. 
Children are kept on the records of the school from Which 
they have moved until the teacher is ‘notified, in writing, 
by the teacher in the new parish that these children are 
reénrolled in school. This method of tracing children 
has had excellent results. 
The teacher must investigate all cases of absence from 
school and decide whether they were “ without legal 
reason.” Once a month such cases are reported to the 
parish council, who may make further investigation as 
to the justness of the charges. They shall thereupon 
proceed to fine the parents or guardians of the delin- 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
     94 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
quents, unless the former are able to show that the 
children in question are habitual truants—in which 
case the children themselves are taken in hand by the 
council. The fines appear small as compared with 
American money, but are heavy enough for the classes 
in Denmark most likely to err in school matters. Twelve 
dre must be paid for each day’s absence during a first 
month of offense; twenty-five dre for each day during 
a second month; fifty dre for each day during a third 
month, and one krone for each day of a fourth month 
—and this with the further provision that there shall 
be an added fine of twenty-five dre for each absence 
above four each month, provided that in no case shall 
the fine exceed one krone per day. If necessary the 
parish council may have recourse to the processes of 
law to collect these fines. And the important fact is 
that the fines are collected. 
Length of School Year.— According to the Ordi- 
nance of 1904, “ instruction shall be given in town and 
country schools during at least forty-one weeks.” As a 
Danish school week covers six days, this gives a minimum 
school year of two hundred and forty-six days. But the 
law is not interpreted to'mean that all the children or 
all the classes must be in attendance all the time during 
these two hundred and forty-six days. Actual attend- 
ance becomes a matter of a specific number of sixty- 
minute periods spent in school weekly. On this point      
-P-A-G-E-125
  MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 95 
the law states that in the larger towns the average 
minimum amount of instruction for each class shall be 
twenty-one hours and in rural districts eighteen hours 
weekly. This does not, however, include gymnastics, 
sloyd, handwork, drawing, or household economics, 
which would increase the number of hours very ma- 
terially. 
The following table gives the number of rural school 
classes (or groups) in the most important subdivisions 
of the kingdom which fall below the minimum number 
of school days, the number employing more than two 
hundred and forty-six days, and so on.

The table shows that forty-four hundred and seventy- 
four classes attended school on the basis of the legal
-P-A-G-E-126
96 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
minimum of two hundred and forty-six days to the school 
year. Two hundred and twenty-six classes fell below 
the minimum because of epidemics or sudden illness of 
teachers. Forty-four hundred and eighty-seven classes 
attended on the basis of more than two hundred and 
forty-six days. 
How the School Days are Divided. — As stated above, 
the minimum requirement in rural schools is eighteen 
sixty-minute periods weekly (not counting gymnastics, 
sloyd, drawing, handwork, and household economics). 
Just how these periods are to be got in for the various 
classes is left to the teachers and the local school com- 
mission to decide. And this decision is generally gov- 
erned by the needs and conditions in the community. 
Usually the older children spend more time in school 
during the winter months than the smaller children, with 
the reverse in summer. Some schools arrange their 
programs wholly on the half-day session plan; others 
give a certain number of whole days (below six) to each 
“class; others, again, have both half and whole day 
sessions for the different classes. This variety of ar- 
rangement can best be made clear through illustra- 
tions. 
Vor Frue Landsogns Skole near Odense in Fiinen is 
organized into eight grades, and these grouped into six 
groups. Grades one, two, three, four are separate 
groups; grades five and six form group five; and grades 
   
-P-A-G-E-127
MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 97 
seven and eight, group six. The school year covers 
two hundred and forty-six days only. The school day 
begins at 8.30 o’clock during winter and 8 o’clock 
during summer, and closes at 3 o'clock, although 
four days in the week the children have gymnastics 
and domestic science from 11 to 12 or 3 to 4 
o’clock accordingly as they are “ forenoon ” or “ after- 
noon” pupils. Groups six, five, and two spend their 
forenoons only in school, and groups four, three, and one 
are in school afternoons only. This arrangement gives 
each grade four hours school work daily, six days a week. 
The actual amount of time in school during the year is 
nine hundred and eighty-four hours, or one hundred and 
sixty-four school days of the regulation length customary 
in the United States. There are three teachers in the 
school. During the forenoons five classes are in school, 
an arrangement which gives two teachers two each and 
the third teacher only one. These teachers do not keep 
the same room or classes all the time, but change from 
room to room with the change in hours. During the 
afternoons there are only three classes in school, one for 
each teacher. Considerable home study is required of 
all the pupils, so that the four periods in school can be 
devoted to recitations and careful assignments for the 
following day’s work. The half-day sessions in this 
school certainly have many points in their favor: (1) 
the teacher devotes his full attention to not more than 
H 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
       98 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
two classes during the half day; (2) the pupils are wide- 
awake and busily at work all the time both by reason of 
the shorter time and the continuous personal attention 
from the teacher; (3) the older pupils may devote a 
portion of the afternoons to work on the farm — an item 
which cannot be ignored in Danish agricultural economy 
at least. 
Himmelev Rural School, near Roskilde in Zealand, 
~ affords an illustration of the mixed system of both half 
and whole days. This is a well-organized school of three 
teachers. School is in session for forty-three weeks out 
of the year, or during two hundred and fifty-eight days. 
The only time the school is at rest is during Christmas 
and Easter and a short vacation in August. The idea 
prevails that it is a good thing to keep the children in 
school practically all the year, but for shorter school 
days than is the custom in some countries. At Him- 
melev the older pupils attend school four whole days and 
two half days during the winter half year, while the pupils 
in the four lower classes are in school three whole days 
and two half days. In the summer time, when the older 
children are needed at home, this arrangement is reversed. 
This makes an average of four and one half days a week 
per pupil, or one hundred and ninety-three and five 
tenths school days to the year. 
Ejby Rural School, Ejby, Fiinen, may be used as a’ 
last illustration. Here, also, attendance is on the mixed

plan of half and whole days, for two hundred and fifty 
days of the year. Table IV makes this plan clear:

‘It must be understood that this table is for the winter 
half year only. In summer time conditions are reversed. 
1A — the primary class — attends six half days only 
during the winter; at the same time the highest class 
is in session four whole and two half days. This makes 
a yearly average of three and three fourths days attended 
per week for each pupil throughout the school year. On 
the basis of twenty school days to the month the average 
school year at Ejby would be eight and one half months. 
The Course of Study.— The law requires certain 
fundamental subjects to be taught in every rural school. 
The list includes religion, reading, writing, arithmetic, 
geography, song, drawing, gymnastics (for boys), and 
handwork. Other subjects which are optional with the

Natural science with special reference to agriculture 
receives more and more emphasis. Nature study is 
taught informally in all the lower classes (Forskoler), 
although not as a separate subject, but rather as a leaven 
in all the subjects. German and English are prominent 
on account of the close commercial relations with these 
countries. The mathematics of Table V is algebra and 
geometry as applied to mensuration. Hygiene is given 
in the primary grades through informal discussion.
-P-A-G-E-131
  MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION I01 
This is found in most of the schools. Sloyd is not 
found in many rural schools, although it is on the in- 
crease. The larger towns and cities, on the other hand, 
are far ahead of the rural districts in this respect. 
Class Organization. — In very few rural schools is all 
the teaching left to one teacher. In such rare cases that 
teacher must be aman. But, as a rule, the district has 
a Forskole or school for primary pupils, in charge of a 
woman teacher. This is often entirely separate from the 
regular school, in its own building, and generally more 
centrally located, because of more recent origin than the 
main school. ‘ : 
The primary schools teach reading, writing, arithmetic 
through whole numbers, and singing of children’s songs 
and hymns. Much of the work is based on object lessons. 
The narrative method is used largely in teaching the 
outlines of Bible history, Danish history and mythology, 
geography, and natural history (nature study). Gym- 
nastics and play, especially the latter, receive much atten- 
tion in the Forskole. This work ends with the fourth 
year. 
In the regular one-teacher districts the children are 
under the care of the man teacher from the beginning of 
the fifth school year, unless the district offers no Forskole 
work when, of course, the children enter the regular school 
from the first. But it must be kept in mind that very 
many of the Danish rural schools are regularly graded 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  
  102 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
schools of two or more teachers, all working in the same 
building. In such cases there are no separate Forskoler. 
The School Subjects. — A point of note is that read- 
ing and spelling are not mechanized and treated as arts 
complete and separate. They are taught rather as 
means necessary to higher educational ends. Spelling 
is taught as a part of the reading process. Consequently 
separate spelling books are not used. 
Under the experienced teachers usually found in the 
schools, the mechanical and technical phases of language, 
_ such as reading, spelling, and grammar, are handled in ~ 
such a way that the children show a good ability to apply 
the language of the classroom to the language of the 
playground and the home. Danish language is taught 
largely through “ doing ” —i.e. through composition 
and dictation exercises. The teacher may give dictation 
from some simple reader or classic. This is studied and 
analyzed, and rules of grammar are applied as needed. 
The work is largely of an inductive nature. 
The religious subjects — such as Bible history, cate- 
chism, sacred music — are strongly emphasized in all 
the schools. Bible history is given orally in the lower 
grades and is studied from textbooks in the upper grades. 
As taught it furnishes an excellent foundation for general 
history. Catechism is taught from textbooks, much of 
it verbatim. 
History and geography hold high place in the course
-P-A-G-E-133
  MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 103 
of study. All school work, in fact, is given an historic 
background. History study is not limited to Denmark 
and Scandinavia alone. It is true Danish history receives 
special emphasis, but the course is rooted intelligently in 
the general history of all Europe and the Orient. A 
certain amount of church history is taught in the religion 
classes; this supplements the work in the history of the 
Middle Ages. Scandinavian mythology is studied as 
one of the history foundations. The geography classes 
devote much time to the Scandinavian countries, though 
the course covers the physical, mathematical, and polit- 
ical history of the entire globe in a reasonably thorough 
manner. The methods employed in teaching history 
and geography do not seem always of the best. In a 
few schools too much of the old memoriter processes pre- 
vail, and some of the teachers are inclined to lecture 
on history instead of teaching it. 
Children in the primary grades are early made ac- 
quainted with nature; in part through stories and nar- 
ratives dealing with natural history, illustrated by means 
of charts and colored pictures, and in part through a 
study with their teachers of the school environment. 
The upper grades get a pretty thorough course in nat- 
ural history, or biology, covering a general outline of 
botany and zodlogy and ending with a study of man, and 
hygiene and sanitation. The amount and thoroughness 
of the work varies greatly, with the schools.
-P-A-G-E-134

104, RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
Very few rural schools offer courses in manual training 
or sloyd; but indications are that such work is getting 
popular in the larger schools. Some of the night schools 
do good work in sloyd. The village and city schools 
have, many of them, excellent courses of this kind. 
Handwork, such as sewing, knitting, darning, and 
embroidery, is required in all rural schools where women 
teachers are employed. In some of the one-teacher 
schools with men teachers in charge, the wife of the 
teacher gives instruction in handwork, for which she 
receives a little pay. 
Singing is taught in all rural schools. All teachers 
must be able to instruct in music whether they can sing 
or not. The teacher almost invariably accompanies the 
song on a violin, which all teachers know how to use. 
Patriotic and religious songs, folk songs, and nature 
songs are sung remarkably well. Even part songs are 
common in many schools. 
Drawing is popular and well taught. Accuracy and 
neatness are watchwords in the drawing classes. Much 
the same can be said for the writing classes. Here, too, 
the children display much painstaking care and neat- 
ness. It is true the writing seemed to lack somewhat 
in rapidity. Our “muscular movements” in writing 
have little or no hold on the schools. 
Much more attention is paid to mental arithmetic than 
in American schools. The quickness and accuracy dis-
-P-A-G-E-135
     MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION I05 
played by the younger children in analyzing mental 
problems is quite remarkable. Enough of plane geom- 
etry is included in the highest class to furnish an intelli- 
gent foundation for problems in mensuration. 
Gymnastics is compulsory in all the schools for boys. 
The older girls generally take the work as a “ special ” 
after regular hours. In the first three or four grades the 
boys and girls take the work in mixed classes. Later 
the sexes are drilled separately. The newer rural schools 
are supplied with indoor gymnasiums. Where these 
are lacking, a suitable plot of ground must be prepared 
out of doors, sanded, and supplied with suitable apparatus. 
The work in gymnastics is uniformly good. It is later 
taken up where elementary schools have dropped it and 
continued in the various folk high schools and local 
agricultural schools. 
Methods of Instruction.— Danish schools depend 
more upon the ability of the teachers and less upon the 
textbooks than is the case in American rural schools. 
      
    
    
   
     
  The teachers are professionally prepared and con- 
sequently know how to draw upon their broad general 
reading and experience for much of the classroom ma- 
terials, instead of depending upon the textbooks to fur- 
nish everything required. The latter are mere “ leading 
threads ”’ in the school work, containing only the funda- 
mental processes, if in mathematics, or outline studies, 
if in history and like subjects. The teacher supplies    
-P-A-G-E-136
   
   106 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
the rest. This means that the average teacher is free 
from too much enslavery of books and can give more of 
himself and his individualism to the work. Where the 
books do not furnish everything, both teachers and 
children make larger use of the constructive and inven- 
tive ingenuity. On the other hand, it is true that some 
of the Danish textbooks are too meager and are of rather 
poor mechanical construction. In the hands of inex- 
perienced teachers they would be of little value. 
School Work as observed in Some of the Schools. — 
It is thought best at this point to give with some detail 
work as it was actually observed in the Danish rural 
schools. For this purpose, the brief story of five schools 
is told. These are not selected because of any marked 
excellence above any other schools visited, but are taken 
as the first five schools that chanced to lie in the path of 
visitation. 
Ryslinge Rural School. — The teacher in charge of 
this school is Mr. P. J. Winther. He was just complet- 
ing the thirteenth year in the district, and previously he 
had spent nineteen years in another parish before coming 
to Ryslinge. The school lies high on a rise of land from 
which can be seen miles of beautiful South Fiinen land- 
scape. It is surrounded with garden and parking, and 
at one side and at the front with well-sanded play- 
grounds. The whole is surrounded by well-kept living 
hedge, outside of which forest trees are planted. Imme-  
-P-A-G-E-137
  MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 107 
diately beyond the school lie the country church and 
the manse with its gardens and fields. This is a one- 
teacher school, having a Forskole at a distance of one 
mile. The building is modern and well built. But this 
will be dwelt upon later in this book and may, therefore, 
be passed by here. The teacher has his abode in the 
school building. The main classroom is well lighted 
and heated by a jacketed ventilating stove. There is 
an abundance of illustrative materials of all kinds, such 
as geographical and historical maps; biological, physio- 
logical, and other charts. A good collection of physical 
apparatus is used as the basis for simple experiments 
in natural science. A small chemical cabinet contains 
what is necessary in milk testing, working with soils 
and the like. Good geological and ethnological collec- 
tions are seen neatly arranged in cases at one side of the 
room. A circulating library of six hundred volumes is 
available for the children and their parents. The deep 
windows are filled with house plants and nature study 
materials. The schoolroom is, in short, a good working 
laboratory for a genuine country school. 
The time spent at Ryslinge School was devoted mainly 
to a study of classes in gymnastics. The gymnasium is 
indoors. It is a model for simplicity and neatness, being 
square, having a good floor, and being equipped with all 
the inexpensive apparatus required in the Ling system of 
gymnastics. Mixed classes of boys and girls from eight
-P-A-G-E-138
      
108 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
to eleven years of age gave an interesting exhibition of 
their everyday work. Before this began, the floor was 
carefully mopped to keep down the dust. Then the 
windows were thrown wide open, in spite of the chilling 
March wind blowing out of doors. All the children 
wore slippers on the feet and the girls had short skirts 
like bloomers. The work included the Ling system of 
“ setting up ” exercises, marches, the use of the Swedish 
wall racks, arm beams, horse for vaulting, and such 
gymnastics. Boys and girls entered into the spirit of 
the work entirely unconscious of sex differences. Part 
of the exercises were accompanied by song —a thing 
that is noticeable even in the gymnastics of the higher 
continuation schools. It isa common thing, for example, 
to hear large classes of husky young farmers in the gym- 
nasium of a folk high school burst suddenly into a rousing 
war song or patriotic lay. At this particular exercise 
the song suddenly changed in time and the march re- 
solved itself into a folk dance. This, again, changed to 
play. But at a signal from the teacher, the ranks were 
immediately reformed. Three quarters of an hour were 
occupied with exercises of similar kind. 
Grades five and six were called upon for song. Mr. 
Winther directed this and led the singers upon the violin. 
First scales were run for some five minutes. In the 
singing that followed the children had good opportunities 
to display their ability to read music. Several national,  
-P-A-G-E-139
  MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 109 
folk, and religious songs were sung. _What appealed to 
the auditors more than anything else was that every 
child took part. This is a test of thorough handling of 
the class. : 
Opportunity was also given to examine specimens 
of writing by all the grades and original compositions 
by grades six, seven, and eight. The writing was ex- 
ceptionally neat and painstaking. The compositions 
showed considerable thought and knowledge of history, 
geography, and agriculture— these being the most 
popular themes employed. The general impression 
carried away from this school was that Mr. Winther 
fully realized the needs of his school community and had 
shaped his school work accordingly. He presided over 
a school thoroughly organized, well disciplined, and 
harmonious with country life needs. 
Vor Frue Landsogns Skole. — This school has been 
used to illustrate other points in this book, but can well 
be discussed a little further. The school lies just beyond 
the large provincial town of Odense and is attended by 
two hundred and ten children, most of them from the 
homes of small farmers, country artisans, and day la- 
borers. It is in a sense a consolidated school with three 
teachers in charge. Because the school uses the half- 
day system for all the pupils there is not that congestion 
which would otherwise be unavoidable in a school of 
more than two hundred and only three teachers. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  IIo RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
school building is modern and roomy. Mr. Hindse- 
Nielsen, the principal, and his two assistants have suites 
in the building. 
The table on opposite page is a reproduction of the 
daily program of six groups into which the classes are 
divided. It will be recalled (page 96) that groups one, 
two, three, and four correspond to years one, two, three, 
and four; but that group five comprises years five and 
six; and that group six comprises years seven and 
eight. 
The inspection at this school covered classes in singing, 
arithmetic, and nature study. 
The singing did not differ much from what had been 
experienced at Ryslinge. The children sang from notes, 
running the scale remarkably true. They kept time with 
their arms as they sang. Songs of a religious, patriotic, 
and folk-lore nature were rendered with feeling and true- 
ness to note. Some of the part songs that were sung 
would be considered difficult for children of equal age in 
good city schools of the United States. 
The sixth grade gave an interesting recitation in 
mental arithmetic, about one half of the period for 
which is devoted to mental drills. The following com- 
mon and decimal fractions were placed on the board, one 
after another, by the teacher. Hands went up to indi- 
cate that answers were ready almost as soon as the 
figures were completed. A careful analysis was made

For rapidity and accuracy the exercise was quite remark- 
able. The three American visitors laid some claim to 
ability in “ figuring,” but found it pretty difficult to keep 
pace with these sixth grade farm children. More mental 
arithmetic in our own lower schools would probably be a 
good thing. 
The nature study lesson was in charge of the primary 
teacher — a woman — and was devoted almost wholly 
to the English sparrow. The class was the second grade. 
Colored charts, last year’s nests, and blackboard draw- 
ings were utilized freely in the discussion. The children 
displayed considerable knowledge of bird lore and were 
given opportunity by the teacher to express this in their 
own way. It became clearly manifest before the period 
closed that this young woman was succeeding in creating 
a love for nature in the breasts of the little ones who 
should later as scientific farmers become the wardens 
of this nature and its creations.

- within and partly outside the regular daily pro- 
gram. Gymnastics is given in mixed classes for grades 
one A, one B, two, and three. 
The inspection here included classwork in natural 
history and advanced arithmetic. 
The natural history as studied in Danish schools 
is really elementary biology. It includes descriptive 
courses in zodlogy and botany, devoting considerable 
time also to physiology. The class at Ejby had for their 
lesson the general topic, “mammalia” and dwelt 
particularly on the domesticated mammals, making 
practical applications to the cow, horse, sheep, and like 
animals. Danish teachers are of the opinion that nature 
study (love for nature), natural history (acquaintance 
with nature), and agriculture (application of both love 
and knowledge of nature) can all be acquired in the rural 
schools — that practical agriculture, however, should be 
studied in the continuation schools after leaving the 
elementary school. 
The class in advanced arithmetic was engaged in 
working out practical original problems in mensuration. 
Enough of plane geometry was used to make the rules 
of measurement intelligible. One half of the class was 
occupied with finding the contents of a seven-sided field, 
the actual dimensions of which they had from their own 
measurement of the field; the rest were calculating the

water surface of a pond lying at some distance from the 
school. All this work was practical and far superior to 
what was observed in a number of other schools, some of 
which adhered too closely to the textbook. 
Hjortespring Rural School. — The last school to be 
mentioned is a one-teacher school near the village of 
Herlév in Zealand. Mr. Johan Egeberg, the teacher, 
had been in the school seven years, coming to the com- 
munity from‘a school tenure elsewhere of nineteen years. 
His position was found to be that of unquestioned 
leadership among the intelligent people where he lived. 
His school building, too, was modern, and beautifully 
set on a ridge surrounded by living hedge, trees, and 
shrubbery. 
The comments on the school work at Hjortespring are 
given as a summary rather than as the result of observa- 
tion of single classes, because more time was spent here 
than in most of the other schools. 
Reading and Language. — Reading as a fundamental 
art is strongly emphasized. A combination of several 
methods is used in teaching the younger children to read. 
Spelling is from the first a part of the reading. It is not 
considered an end in itself; hence, no separate textbooks 
need be used. All the spelling grows out of the reading. 
The reading books are arranged in such a way that they 
can be used as language books also. The mother tongue 
is learned inductively through the reading and the ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-146

planations offered by the teacher. Very early the 
children are taught to copy small portions of reading 
matter from the reading-language book on paper or on 
their slates. This is analyzed and explained by the 
children with the teacher’s assistance. Next follow 
dictation exercises by the teacher. The children are 
expected to write down correctly what is given, emphasiz- 
ing properly sentence structure, punctuation, capitali- 
zation, and like points of form. Rules are laid down 
for convenience, not before they are needed. By the 
time the children reach the eighth grade they have a 
good understanding of language usages without having 
used a specially prepared book. Now a compendium in 
grammar is used in order finally to clarify and sum- 
marize what has been learned. 
Arithmetic.— The textbook contains the essentials 
only; the teacher supplies the rest. The thoroughness 
with which the four elementary processes are learned is 
striking. Rules play a very minor part. The children 
learn by doing. Mental arithmetic is popular and well 
taught. The textbooks contain considerable material 
with a farm “flavor.” Farm accounting and farm 
problems comprise a big part of the subject matter in the 
books. 
Geography. — A small textbook and a large separate 
Atlas are used. The historical and political elements are 
prominent; though most of all the commercial and
-P-A-G-E-147
- 
MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION I 
‘eit agricultural phases are emphasized. History and gi 
raphy are taught as inseparable. 
History. — The children get a large vision of the 
historic field before leaving school. To begin with, they 
are taught the history of Denmark, and this is insepara- 
bly connected with the history of Norway and Sweden 
— thus giving them in reality the history of the North. 
It is also to a large degree rooted to England, Holland, 
Germany, and Russia, so that much of general history 
creeps in. All the children are taught Bible history. 
This is a simple narrative of Bible events from Hebrew 
and Oriental history. In addition, the highest class 
gets a simple outline of Church history. So, taken all 
together, these history courses furnish the children a 
good historical horizon. 
Natural history and nature study, music, gymnastics, 
hygiene and sanitation, and handwork (the last in 
charge of Mrs. Egeberg), are uniformly well taught, not 
differing materially from what had been seen in the 
schools already described. These may, therefore, be 
passed by at this time.

   CHAPTER VIII 
  THEIR BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 
Schoolhouse Construction. — The construction of all 
new school buildings and the modification of all old 
structures must be done in accordance with a circular 
issued by the Ministry of Education. Such important 
_ Matters are not left entirely with the local commune 
    and school board. And wisely are they not so left, for if 
they were the best interests of the school district would 
often be made to suffer from the selfishness and close- 
fistedness of a few influential individuals. As matters 
now stand, all building construction must comply with 
Ministerial regulation. The final plans and specifica- 
tions — whether for a new building or for the reconstruc- 
_tion of an old one — must be inspected and ratified by the 
“ Targe deanery school directory before the local authori- 
ties can proceed to build. In specific cases the local 
board may appeal to the Ministry of Education for final 
decision on points in controversy. 
According to the circular of 1900, the building site 
must be large, sightly, and sanitary. Each classroom 
must be large, well lighted, and ventilated. The ceiling 
118
-P-A-G-E-149
THEIR BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 119 
must be at a height of not less than ten feet. School- 
rooms in Forskoler and the regular elementary schools 
must contain a minimum air space of four thousand and 
five thousand cubic feet respectively. This is figured 
on the basis of a maximum of thirty-five pupils to 
the room. Each room shall have at least a ventilator 
shaft connected with a jacketed stove as means of 
ventilation. Many are supplied with racks and lockers, 
with at least three square feet of floor space for each 
child. 
Wherever practicable,(new school buildings are to 
contain indoor gymnasiums, and equip them with all the 
apparatus required for the Ling system of gymnastics. 
When this cannot be done for good reason, as in the case 
of buildings constructed before such requirements were 
made, an outdoor gymnasium must be constructed to 
answer this need. This shall be laid off as near the 
school building as possible and is to contain at least six 
hundred and twenty-five square meters. The place 
must be reduced to a water level, properly drained and 
covered with several inches of screened sand. Perma- 
nent apparatus is to be erected on the ground, and such 
apparatus as cannot be exposed to the weather may be 
kept in a storeroom erected for that purpose, on the 
edge of the ground. 
Rules Governing Schoolhouse Sanitation. — The rules 
governing the cleansing of schoolrooms are very per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
    
      I20 
  RURAL DENNARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
tinent and suggestive. These are, therefore, given in 
some detail : 
1. The floors must be kept perfectly tight and filled, 
varnished, painted or covered with linoleum, or otherwise 
protected from dampness. 
2. The classrooms must be aired frequently — both 
before the session begins and during all intermissions. 
3. All school furniture and walls must be wiped with a 
damp cloth daily. All window panes must be polished 
at least once a week. 
4. The floors must he washed daily, and scrubbed once 
a week with soap and warm water. 
5. The water-closets must be kept scrupulously clean 
and the excreta emptied frequently. The urinals must 
be washed out daily. 
6. The children shall not be permitted to remain in 
classrooms and halls during intermission except in in- 
*lement weather. 
‘st. ‘The expense incidental to the enforcement of these 
vegtilations shall be borne by the commune. It shall be 
the duty of the teacher and the local school commission 
to see that the regulations are enforced. 
\Ordinarily, Danish teachers, even in the smallest 
country schools, have nothing to do with the actual work 
of cleansing the schoolrooms. Janitors — often women 
—are employed for this purpose. In a few districts, 
however, chiefly in the sparsely populated heather re-

gions of western Jutland, the teachers nt ae after the 
cleaning of the schools. But they are, in every instance, 
paid for this work by the commune. | 
Some Schoolhouse Plans. — The Danish ‘ire schools 
are substantially built. Many of them are very attrac- 
tive from the architectural point of view. And_prac- 
tically all the new buildings are well supplied with modern 
sanitary conveniences. The building material commonly 
used is brick or reénforced concrete. Tile or slate 
roofs are in ordinary use. Occasionally one may find old 
schoolhouses covered with thatch; but these are passing 
rapidly. The fearful spread of tuberculosis throughout 
the nation has furnished ample argument for sanitary 
building construction. Now the general government 
pays a part of the cost of new, modern schoolhouses, as 
an inducement to abolish the old. It even goes so far as 
to give state aid in the modernization of old buildings. 
Plan I.— This shows the ground plan of Vor Frne 
Landsogns School which has been mentioned sev 
times before. The building was erected in 190, at_a 
cost of 30,000 kroner. It has three classrooms and living 
accommodations for the three teachers. 
The upper grades have classrooms (A and B) opening 
upon the main hall (£). The lower grades (C) have 
their own hall (D) from which their teacher — a woman 
—may reach her suite of four rooms overhead by her 
own separate stairway. The “ first teacher’ occupies

the remainder of the first floor. The “second teacher ” 
—an unmarried man — has four rooms above the princi- 
pal’s suite. The fuel-house, including toilets (M4), lies 
immediately to the right and to the rear of the main 
building. The gymnasium, which is also the social center 
hall, lies in a like position to the left of the school. The 
latter structure is used daily for gymnastics by the school 
children and during certain evenings of the week by the 
gymnastic association of the parish. It is used, more- 
over, as the rallying center of the community in its 
school extension courses and in many social gatherings. 
The yard is of good size, is well planted and protected 
by a strong hedge and picket fence. 
Plan II,—This is a smaller school, being of one 
room only. The classroom (A) has, contrary to Ameri- 
Garden.

can ideas, its main window exposure towards the west. 
But this is easily understood when it is known that 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
    124 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
Denmark has very few bright sunny days and some- 
thing like ninety that are foggy. 
The teacher has an office and six living rooms down- 
stairs besides several others above. Almost all of the 
teachers in the rural schools, who were asked whether 
they preferred their present mode of living to separate 
cottages, made answer that present conditions were 
entirely satisfactory. The noise from the Ryslinge 
School seemed to be a small matter, especially as it, like 
all the modern buildings, is of substantial construction. 
In this case a heavy brick wall separates the classroom 
and gymansium from the teacher’s home. In many of 
the schools, the teachers’ entrance to the building is on 
the side opposite from the children’s entrance. In this 
way there is little disturbance. It is of great advantage 
to the teachers to live right in their own great laboratory 
where they can always be handy to their work — but 
where they can also have the necessary amount of privacy. 
Plan III. — This is the largest of the rural schools 
visited. ‘The main building is constructed of hard brick 
with tile roof, at a cost of 50,000 kroner. The gymna- 
sium, which lies to the rear and right, cost 10,000 kroner. 
It is to be noted that this school is planned on the 
quadrangle idea. The main building forms the fore- 
ground; the gymnasium (B), the right side; a proposed 
teachers’ home (C), the left side ; and the fuel house with 
toilets (D), the rear. A good-sized sanded playground

(Z) lies within. The entire basement of the school 
building is cemented. The intention is to use a part for 
playroom in inclement weather; the remainder will be 
fitted for manual training shops. This has not yet been 
done for want of funds. The first floor contains four 
classrooms, all lighted from the left and heated by 
means of very effective ventilating stoves. The halls 
are large, affording much space for wardrobes. Atten- 
tion is also called to the separate entrances leading re- 
spectively to the homes of the principal, ‘second teacher,” 
and women teachers. The gymnasium is the most 
complete of its kind found in the rural schools. Besides 
the large floor equipped with the Ling system apparatus, 
the building is equipped with dressing rooms and shower 
baths, above which is a spacious gallery for spectators. 
The fuel house and toilets are all under one roof and 
substantially constructed of brick. In cold weather 
the toilet rooms are heated. Four complete gardens, — 
one for each teacher, — laid out and planted at com- 
munity expense, lie to the rear and flank the quadrangle. 
Plan IV.—This shows the old inland hamlet of 
Gamborg in which a one-teacher school has been running 
for many years. A few years ago the railroad was 
built through the community; and a station town by 
the name of Kauselunde sprang up. The new town com- 
prised a part «f the Gamborg school district and was, 
from the first, sbliged to send its children to that 
 
-P-A-G-E-157

school. It is noteworthy that in Denmark the authori- 
ties are reluctant about cutting up school districts.

128 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
compromise was agreed to whereby a nice new Forskole 
was erected on the highway between the two towns, 
leaving the original Gamborg school for the older pupils. 
At Ejby and Himmelev, and other places, large consoli- 
dated schools have been erected somewhere between the 
two hamlets, a way which appeared really more satis- 
factory to solve the school problem. 
Teachers’ Gardens. — The provision for free homes is 
a great stride in the direction of long tenures in the same 
district, whether it be in Denmark or in the United 
States. The addition to this of the permanent use of a 
piece of land would be another help in making the teacher 
a permanent community leader. In the olden time 
Danish teachers drew much of their income from the 
permanent school lot, which was a body of land, ranging 
from two to ten acres, attached to the school. The 
patrons and others who lived within the school district 
were even obliged, at one time, to furnish the school- 
master a certain amount of forage. Recently, the school 
lots are being sold off and the teachers’ salaries have been 
increased with a money equivalent. A few are still in 
existence. 
But the teacher’s garden has always been kept separate 
from the school lot. It goes really with the teacher’s 
home and is considered as essential to happy, complete 
country living. Under the law, the first teacher must 
have at least one third of an acre; the other teachers 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  THEIR BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 129 
are entitled only to one fourth as much. In case the land near the school is not adapted to garden use, the teacher may accept a money equivalent. But this arrangement is seldom made. 
The garden is much more than a vegetable garden. It is a permanent plantation. The community must stand the expense of planning and planting. It must be prop- erly drained and fenced; fruit trees and shrubbery 
must be planted. And in other ways it must be per- manent and satisfactory. Primarily, the garden is intended for the teacher and his family — to give them pleasure and added income. But, as stated elsewhere, 
they are used for classroom Purposes also — not in all schools, though in many. In them, teacher and children dig and rake and hoe, side by side, learning lessons from blade and leaf and flower. It is here, close to the earth smells, that the children gain their first love of nature. 
Playgrounds. — The Danish rural schools are not, as a rule, equipped with large playgrounds. This is quite natural in a country where every square foot of ground is needed in bread winning. The important thing is that they are properly utilized and well equipped to that end. The law forbids loitering indoors during inter- missions except in inclement weather. The children must be out on the playground and under the eye of the teacher. Nearly all the playgrounds are fenced. All kK

are well drained and some part of each is sanded and 
fit for use even in damp weather. Considerable play- 
ground apparatus is found at every school, particularly 
where there is an outdoor gymnasium.

  CHAPTER IX 
PREPARATION, SALARIES, AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS OF 
‘TEACHERS 
Preparation of Elementary Teachers. — It is safe to 
place professional preparation of teachers first on the 
list in looking for the cause of the uniformly good work 
done in Danish rural schools. No Person can receive a 
permanent call as teacher who is not a graduate from one 
of the twenty normal schools or who does not hold some 
university degree. ‘Non-graduates may hold places such 
as those of apprentice teachers, hour teachers, substitute 
teachers, but such are not considered as teachers in the 
real meaning ofthe word. 
The table on following page gives a good idea of the 
Preparation of teachers in the public rural schools. 
Conditions are much the same for private rural schools. 
Comments on the table are scarcely necessary. Out of 
a total of three thousand eight hundred and twelve men 
teachers only one hundred and forty-one are non- 
graduates; of one thousand four hundred and fifty-three 
women teachers four hundred and thirty-eight are non- 
graduates. The men teachers are practically all gradu-

ates. Fully one half of the woman non-graduates are 
assistants only, and are not counted as regular teachers. 
The Forskole diploma mentioned under “ women” 
refers to a special training course for primary teachers. 
Now as a large majority of the teachers get their prep- 
aration in the teachers’ seminaries or normal schools 
it is well to study the requirements of these schools more 
closely. 
Teachers’ Seminaries: Course and Requirements. — 
The elementary school teachers of Denmark receive 
their professional preparation in twenty seminaries or 
normal schools, erected wherever needed throughout the
-P-A-G-E-163
SALARIES AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS OF TEACHERS 133 
nation. Four of these only are state schools; the other 
sixteen are privately owned or belong to some branch of 
the state church or the free church. The work in all of 
them is under strictest state supervision. The privately 
owned schools are practical'y maintained by the State, 
which furnishes liberal aid. Entrance requirements, 
course of study, final examinations, and similar char- 
acteristics are similar-in all the schools. 
Candidates for matriculation must have satisfied the 
following requirements before they can enter upon study 
in the first year class: 
/ x. Must furnish baptismal, confirmation, and vac- 
| cination certificates. 
2. Must have attained the age of eighteen before 
the expiration of the first calendar year in school. 
3- Must show evidence of satisfactory moral charac- 
| ter, and show, in detail, how their time has been spent 
since they completed the public school work. 
4. Must produce a physician’s attest to show that 
they are in good bodily health; especially, that they are 
not suffering from any disease which would make them 
unfit for the teaching profession. 
5. Must have devoted at least one full year as appren- 
tice in some school satisfactory to the Ministry of Educa- 
| tion. (The presupposition is that all candidates have a 
| good knowledge of the academic subjects. They are 
| then placed for a year in the hands of an expert teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
134 RURAL\ DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
to permit him to \determine whether they have any 
natural qualifications, to recommend them. In case 
these seem lacking the teacher may withhold the neces- 
sary credentials.) 
6. Finally, the candidate) for admission must pass a 
satisfactory test in the following subjects: 
a. Arithmetic and elementary algebra; 6. outlines 
of natural history; c. geography with special reference 
to Denmark; d. history of the North and outlines of 
general history; e. test in reading; /. written composi- 
tion; g. elements of Danish grammar; 4. Bible history 
and catechism ; 7. test in knowledge of music — must be 
able to play simple compositions on the violin; j. young 
women must show some ability in sewing and knit- 
ting. 
The candidates for admission have for the most part 
pursued study in higher continuation schools since 
they left the elementary school. Or they have at least 
spent a year under a capable tutor preparing for the 
entrance examinations. 
The seminaries offer one year’s study in preparatory 
work for students knowing themselves to be deficient 
in some of the entrance requirements. Very few stu- 
dents, however, take the preparatory studies, as nearly 
all who enter come with advanced standing. 
The following is the minimum course for teachers in 
the rural and other elementary schools :

(The policy of Danish schools is to study a large num- 
ber of subjects at once by reducing the number of hours 
a week to a minimum for each study, where American 
schools would reduce the number of subjects and give a 
maximum number of hours weekly.” JDanish educators 
insist that better educational results are gained by “ dove- 
tailing ” the entire course into an educational whole, all 
parts of which are held constantly before the mental eye. 
On account of this belief subjects which could be com- 
pleted within the school year are drawn out over several. 
Students do not recite the total number of sixty-minute 
periods given above, each week. The course of study 
prescribes a certain amount of work to be completed 
annually in each subject. That particular class recites 
the prescribed number of hours while completing this 
work only. The actual number of hour recitations per 
week varies from about twenty-eight in the first year 
to eighteen or twenty in the third. 
It should be added that there is a movement on foot
-P-A-G-E-167
    SALARIES AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS OF TEACHERS 137 
to make the requirements for graduation considerably 
heavier than they are now. 
How One may become a Permanent Teacher. — 
Graduation from one of the seminaries does not necessa- 
rily carry with it government appointment to a permanent 
position. The supply of teachers is normally larger 
than the demand. All are obliged to begin as assistants 
or substitutes, or as teachers in provisional, private, and 
special winter schools. The permanent positions in the 
country include places as principal teacher of one-room 
school, second teacher, and woman primary teacher. 
Permanent calls to fill vacancies in these schools may 
be issued only to teachers having all the following re- 
quirements : 
1. Principals and teachers of one-room schools must 
have attained the age of twenty-five years; all others 
must be at least twenty-one years of age. 
2. They must present an attest (not more than three 
months old) from a reputable physician that they are 
not afflicted with tuberculosis or other infectious disease. 
3. Preparation must be as set forth above. 
4. They must all have had experience in practical 
teaching — i.e. as assistants, substitutes, and so on — 
candidates for principalships, at least two years; teachers 
in one-room schools, the same. All other applicants 
shall have had at least one year’s experience. 
The important duty of issuing permanent calls to 
, 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
    138 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
teachers falls to the deanery school directory, upon the 
nomination of candidates by the communal council and 
local school commission. The procedure is briefly this : 
the deanery directory announces the vacancy and re- 
ceives all applications for the position. A complete list 
of all the eligible candidates is then sent to the communal 
council and school commission (the latter being present 
in an advisory capacity only). The communal council 
now nominates three candidates from the list. The one 
of the three seemingly having the best qualifications is 
thereupon chosen for the vacancy by the deanery 
council. 
( Length of Tenure and Age of Teachers. — The per- 
manently called teachers naturally hold office during life 
or good behavior. ) This has many advantages. The 
teacher from the first feels that he has entered upon a life 
in the community and finds it worth while to “ grow up 
with the place.” Such a position does not preclude the 
teacher, on the other hand, from later becoming a can- 
didate for a more desirable place, though teachers seldom 
remain less than seven to ten years in the same commu- 
nity. 
Teachers may be expelled from their positions only on 
account of gross immorality or misfeasance in office. 
The deanery council may also suspend them temporarily 
for neglect of duty, until an investigation can be made 
by the Ministry of Education. If it appears that a
-P-A-G-E-169
SALARIES AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS OF TEACHERS 139 
teacher has outgrown his usefulness in a given community 
on account of incompatibility of temperament, or by 
having “ got into a rut” or the like, he may be trans- 
ferred to some school where he will fit in better. 
The rural teachers are mature men and women, a 
fact which will appear from Tables VIII and IX. Prin- 
cipals and teachers of one-room schools show the highest 
age. “Second teachers’ seem to reach promotion to 
these positions at the age of thirty to thirty-five. None 
of the assistant teachers is over thirty. A few irregular 
teachers in temporary schools are even below twenty; 
but these, it must be recalled, are not teachers as legally 
understood.

Practical Results. — Professional training and long 
tenures have been wrought with great influence on rural 
community life. The teachers are trained for country 
life and understand its needs. They enter upon their 
tasks, knowing that they have time to rear well and 
fundamentally. This results in a community leadership 
which cannot be hoped from peripatetic teachers, as in 
the case with teachers in most American rural districts, 
who remain in country schools for a term or two, and 
use them as stepping-stones to town school teaching or 
other occupations. Danish rural districts can count 
hundreds of teachers who would not exchange their posi- 
tions for a first-rate inspectorship in Copenhagen — all be- 
cause they have been enabled by these fortunate arrange-     
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  SALARIES AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS OF TEACHERS I41I 
| ments to hew out for themselves, where they are, an im- 
portant niche in the educational life of the people. 
Rural Teachers are Well Paid: Reasons Why. — In 
Denmark, as elsewhere in Europe, teaching is as much a 
profession as law or medicine or theology. Every 
teacher is a professional teacher. Eminent preparation 
is required of all; but the state in return pays for the 
services in a way commensurate with the time and effort 
used in preparation. Every hamlet and city realizes 
that education is essential to success in life. Since the 
disastrous war with Prussia and Austria, in 1864, Den- 
mark has more than regained the population and wealth 
that were lost in that disaster, chiefly through its school- 
masters, who have been indefatigable in the educational 
campaigns which have placed the kingdom well in the 
forefront of nations intellectually and industrially. The 
teachers are rewarded furthermore with a high social 
ranking. Scholarship is respected and reverenced alike 
by high and low; all classes look up to the teaching 
fraternity because of its importance to the State. 
What the Teacher Remuneration Comprises. — The 
Ordinance of 1908 made very satisfactory provisions 
for the care and keep of rural teachers. The following 
points are of particular interest : 
1. Salary. — “ First teachers” and teachers of one- 
toom schools are engaged at a beginning salary of not 
less than nine hundred kroner nor more than fourteen
-P-A-G-E-172
  142 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
hundred kroner to be paid, monthly in advance, by the 
commune. The State adds to this amount at the rate 
of two hundred kroner each fourth year until a total of 
a thousand kroner has been reached. In this way it 
becomes possible to draw twenty-four hundred kroner 
per annum upon the completion of the twentieth school 
year. 
“Second teachers” and women teachers are paid 
according to a similar sliding scale, although the beginning 
salary is less. The commune pays them not less than 
seven hundred kroner nor more than nine hundred kroner. 
The state thereafter makes specified increases. 
Teachers in many “ trading-places” which in the 
United States would be rated as rural get the same pay 
as the teachers of the large provincial towns. Men 
begin with fifteen hundred or sixteen hundred kroner and 
may get increases up to twenty-eight hundred or three 
thousand kroner. Women begin with fourteen hundred 
or fifteen hundred kroner and may in time reach nineteen 
hundred or two thousand kroner. 
This can be seen at a glance from the figures on the 
opposite page. 
2. Home.— All teachers are provided with com- 
fortable homes. These are built and owned by the com- 
mune, which looks after the upkeep. If the home does 
not come up to the required standards, the teacher can 
have recourse to law. In a few instances where it is

necessary to heat the house in comfort, including also 
what is necessary for kitchen purposes. 
4. Garden. — A well-planned and planted garden plays 
an important réle in the teachers’ remuneration. is 
ranges in size from one half or one third 3 
principal to one eighth or one twelfth of an as 
the other teachers. “In case the lay of the land or c 
sistency o° ‘the soil makes it impracticable to prov 
gardens, money ranging from something like twenty~ 
five to three hundred kroner may be accepted in lieu of 
them. 
5. Perquisites.— The old school “lots” mentioned 
above still furnish considerable income in a few sec- 
tions. Here the teachers also receive a stated amount 
of fodder annually, enough to winter two cows and six 
sheep. 
Finally, there are specific incomes from the positions 
of church chorister, organist, and church fees. The 
“first teacher ”’ usually has charge of the choir, getting 
for his services one hundred to two hundred kroner. 
The “ second teacher ” generally plays the organ, which 
nets him one hundred kroner or more. 
To make this matter of remuneration as clear as 
possible it may be well to use the following illustration 
taken from an average school near the center of the island 
of Fiinen. The three teachers of the school made the 
following showing :

A Good Living for Rural Teachers. — Thirty-four 
»piadred kroner amounts to about $920 in 1. » American 
quivalent. This is a considerable sum as teaching 
goes. But if it is to be a just basis for comparison the 
greater purchasing power of the Danish equivalent must 
be kept in mind. As things go to-day the thirty-four 
hundred kroner has a purchasing power in Denmark 
equal to from $1500 to $1800 in the United States. 
This may be observed in the figures used in estimating the 
value of house rent and fuel. The seven-room modern 
house, for example, is figured at about $10 per month 
— an equally good house would cost twice as much in the 
United States. : 
But to make the figures really effective they might be 
compared with salaries paid in our own country, where 
the average annual salary of all teachers, rural and city, 
is now $485. Just what the rural teachers are getting 
cannot be said with absolute exactness. But in rg10, 
this amounted to only $296.93, according to figures 
compiled by the writer from the reports of thirty states. 
The past three years have shown a material increase so 
L  
-P-A-G-E-176
       146 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
that the amount is no doubt considerably above the 
$300 mark. Even then it is scarcely more than one third 
of what many teachers of one-room schools get in Den- 
mark. 
Old-age Pensions. — These might also in full justice 
be counted as a part of the teacher’s remuneration; they 
are such, only deferred. Full provision is made by the 
State to pension superannuated teachers and their 
widows and children under certain regulations. Under 
this category come also teachers who have become 
incapacitated through accident or disease during their 
years of service. 
General regulations governing all pensions are these: 
1. Regularly employed permanent teachers only are 
entitled to pensions. This excludes all assistant teachers, 
apprentice teachers, hour teachers, and the like. 
2. The applicant must have been regularly employed 
for at least five years when the application for pension is 
made. Exception may be made in a case where the appli- 
cant has held the same or similar position as assistant 
teacher before being made permanent. In this way 
only is it possible to obtain a pension in disregard of 
the five-year limit. 
3. The applicant must be at least thirty years of age 
at the time of making application, and the cause for 
retirement can be no other than old age, constitutional 
weakness, sickness, and the like. Any teacher leaving     
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  SALARIES AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS OF TEACHERS 147 
the teaching profession to engage in other employment 
as a life work will not be given consideration. 
4. Exceptions to these regulations are made in the 
case of teachers who are obliged to discontinue their 
work on account of having contracted infectious tuber- 
culosis. All such, no matter whether permanently 
employed or not, are entitled to an annual pension for 
life equivalent to two thirds of the average income on 
their “ living ” for the last five years immediately prior 
to retiring. 
Scale of Pensions. — The size of the pension is based 
upon the entire “living” of the teacher —i.e. on his 
cash salary, house, fuel, and perquisites. It is not 
based on the last year’s income, but upon the estimated 
average of the five years immediately before retir- 
ing. 
Here follows the present scale: From o to 2 years’ 
service above five years ; of the average income during 
these five years; from 2 to 4 years’ o #y of the 
income ; from 7 to 10, 745; from 10 to 20, 2; from 20 to 21, 
at from 21 to 22, its from 22 to 23,28; from 23 to 24, 
8; from 24 to 25, 8; from 25 to 26, 86; from 26 to 
27, $$; from 27 to 28, 88; from 28 to 29, é$; and over 
| 29, §. 
Widows of teachers on the eligible list are entitled to 
an annual pension of one eighth of the husband’s average 
“living” during the last five years of his office. This
-P-A-G-E-178
  % 
148 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
rule’ holds good whether the husband dies during active 
service or after having been retired. 
The children of the deceased are, strictly speaking, 
not entitled to pension, but under the ruling of the Law 
of 1856, all unconfirmed children of such shall be cared 
for from a special fund set apart for this purpose. The 
care of these children, so far as pecuniary aid is concerned, 
is intrusted to the deanery school directory.
-P-A-G-E-179
  CHAPTER X 
APPLICATION OF THE DanisH System TO AMERICAN 
SCHOOLS 
General Statement. — The elementary rural schools of 
Denmark have reached their present state of high 
efficiency as the result of many years of painful develop- 
ment. The fact that the Danish people are homogeneous 
and form a small nation has naturally made the process 
less difficult. When to this be added dire necessity 
which several times within the past hundred years has 
acted as a needed spur, one can readily understand the 
present satisfactory conditions. 
On the other hand, there are reasons enough why rural 
school conditions in the United States are no better 
than they are. Ours is a great nation in the process of 
making. There is a continuous shifting and changing 
going on in the country population. Many have been 
seeking the new lands of the West; others have been 
moving into the large villages and some to the cities, 
compelled by the modern industrialism. Much of this 
shifting process has been wholesome as it has rid agri- 
cultural communities of many people who are city- 
minded. 
149
-P-A-G-E-180
  150 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
But in this process of reorganization the rural schools 
and all other factors in country life have suffered much 
loss. The former have been unable for many reasons to 
keep pace with the great changes that have been going 
on. Many of them have become retarded and are 
unable to cope with the new agricultural conditions. The 
most hopeful thing about this difficult situation is, no 
doubt, that educationists all over the country are awake 
to present needs and are at work to seek and apply the 
remedies. 
In some sections of the United States the small rural 
schools are bound to persist indefinitely, chiefly on ac- 
count of geographical conditions. Elsewhere, great 
changes are taking place in school organization. Where 
need has compelled or conditions for reorganization 
have been right, thousands of country communities 
have consolidated, or are in the process of consolidating, 
the enfeebled schools in natural rural centers, grading 
the work thoroughly, and in many instances offering as 
many as four years of high school work. 
The new schools will be pretty sure to accomplish 
\tor the country community what the old have been | 
incapable of doing; namely, to train the boys to become 
scientific farmers and the girls practical wives for the 
farmers.) From these schools are beginning to come 
already many impulses to organize the country people 
on a more permanent social-economic foundation.
-P-A-G-E-181
TO AMERICAN SCHOOLS I5r 
‘al Schools of Value to American 
d elsewhere, it would be unwise to 
nited States educational systems 
taken from countries; yet such countries can 
often teach lesson. of greatest value. The rural schools 
of Denmark have accomplished certain things which 
American schools have as yet failed to attain. In part 
these failures are explainable in natural causes which 
could not be surmounted; but very often needless 
disorganization in school policies might have been pre- 
vented had there been more widespread knowledge of 
educational conditions as they exist in the older Euro- 
pean states. ‘ 
The following paragraphs summarize some of the 
salient things in the Danish system. They contain 
also some suggestions as to the possible application of 
some of them to our American rural schools. 
Teaching in Denmark a Life Profession. —No man 
or woman is permitted to teach in the public schools 
who has not completed at least the regular professional 
course in one of the twenty State accredited teachers’ 
seminaries. Nor can any teacher receive a permanent 
“ call” until he has been tested as a substitute teacher, 
hour teacher, and so on, This plan tends to weed out 
those who are unfit. 
A majority of the teachers remain in the same com- 
munity for many years, growing up in a way with the 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
       152 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
community, coming soon to understand local needs, and 
then setting to work systematically to supply them. 
These teachers are well paid and well housed. The 
calling is dignified and is held in the highest esteem. 
Because of these fortunate conditions men teachers — 
generally married men — are in a large majority in the 
schools. To be exact, 82 per cent of elementary school 
teachers are men. 
Conditions in the United States. —In this country 
conditions are quite different. A large majority of rural 
teachers have little, if any, professional training. Many 
of them are certified as teachers by local authority 
immediately after leaving the grades. The average ten- 
ure for all teachers is short, and for rural teachers, it is 
much shorter. Ina great state of the Middle West, last 
year, 47 per cent of the rural teachers were entirely 
untried, and in other states conditions are fully as bad. 
The percentage of men teachers has dropped from 29.9 
per cent in 1899-1900 to 21.1 per cent in 1909-1910 
and 20.7 per cent in 1910-1911. 
It is evident that the rural schools of our country will 
find it difficult to furnish the trained leaders needed in the 
open country until a staff of professionally trained 
teachers is placed in charge of the schools. Prevailing 
conditions in Danish schools would suggest that the 
professionalizing of our rural teachers might be hastened, 
(x) by providing, through legal enactment, a liberal   
-P-A-G-E-183
  
  APPLICATION TO AMERICAN SCHOOLS 153 
sliding-scale salary, increasing definitely with the 
length of tenure; (2) by making it obligatory upon the 
community to erect teachers’ cottages, thereby keeping 
the teachers in the country permanently; and (3) by 
encouraging teachers’ colleges, normal schools, high 
schools with teacher-training courses, and like institu- 
tions to organize thoroughgoing departments in country 
life and country teaching, from which to draw teachers 
willing and able to undertake the difficult task of teach- 
ing real farm community schools. 
Organization for School Maintenance and Supervision. 
— The maintenance of Danish schools through a system 
of local and State taxes is eminently fair, as it both 
‘encourages to greatest local initiative and equalizes 
educational advantages throughout the Kingdom. 
School supervision is fairly close and effective, since it 
works concentrically from the great central authority 
outward to the smallest rural community. Supervision 
is left in the hands of several authorities, the one keeping 
a check on the activity of the other. Special supervisors 
in charge of music, gymnastics, drawing, sloyd, and such 
subjects are very effective in their work. 
~ In the United States probably nothing has done more 
to retard the development of the rural schools than the 
general want of a unit of organization large enough to 
make the management of the schools efficient, economical, 
and intelligent. The small independent district of the
-P-A-G-E-184
  
Especially is this true where the taxing power is con-

open country has generally proved too small to be in- 
trusted with final legislation in matters of importance. 
cerned. The union of several townships into strong 
administrative and supervisory units is to be commended 
for the older states where the township (town) is the 
unit in local government. In the Middle West Fee 
Western States a change should be made from th 
district, as well as township, to the county b: 
organization. When one school board, elected fre 
area at large, controls all the schools, a more © 
standard of excellence and equality in school p: 
is sure to prevail: In sections where the large 
prevails, excellent results may already be seen in’ 
consolidation of weak schools into effective farm sche 
The problem of close, helpful supervision is comp: ~ 
tively easy of solution in densely peopled sections, but 
will continue as a serious hindrance to good teaching 
in sparsely settled regions. But, in a general way, things 
could be materially improved if State departments of 
education had the use of a number of carefully trained 
rural supervisors to help local supervisors standardize 
their work. Finally, local supervisors can scarcely 
become genuinely helpful before a continuous professional 
relation is set up between local supervisors and teachers. 
Enforcement of Compulsory Attendance. — School 
attendance in Denmark is almost ideal. For 1913, only
-P-A-G-E-185
  APPLICATION TO AMERICAN SCHOOLS 155 
eight hundred and twenty-two children of school age in 
country districts failed to enter school. Of these, four 
hundred and fifty-two were abnormal or afflicted with   
        
infectious disease and were by law excluded. Only 
three hundred and seventy were unaccounted for, which 
for the entire school population makes about one tenth 
of r percent. The people in general are so imbued with 
the idea of education, or, if this is not the case, they have 
at any rate such wholesome respect for the compulsory- 
attendance law that they never think of breaking it. 
The fact in point is that the law is enforced without fear 
or favor. 
At the present time thirty-seven states in the United 
' States have compulsory-attendance laws on their statute 
books ; six have laws which apply to part of their terri- 
tory only ; and another five have no such laws whatever. 
Many weaknesses could be pointed to in these laws, 
though perhaps the most serious is the manner in which 
the average law is enforced. In most states the enforce- 
ment is left to local authority, which is often influenced 
by local prejudice and interests to such an extent that 
the law becomes practically inoperative. If all the states 
would follow the example of Connecticut and appoint

‘School Work adapted to Country Needs. —Th 
elementary rural schools of Denmark do not pretend to 
teach agriculture as a practical subject; they leave that — 
for the agricultural schools to do. But they do teach a 
love of nature in such a way that the average child early 
learns to love nature and to live in harmony with its 
laws. Where there is a genuine love of the soil for its 
own sake, the work of training the young agriculturists 
becomes reasonably easy. The schools teach other 
practical subjects effectively; but this teaching is never 
done at the expense of such essential subjects as language, 
mathematics, geography, and history. Music and gym- 
nastics hold exceptionally high place in the daily work. 
Much rural school work is done as thoroughly in some 
tural sections of the United States as in rural Denmark, 
although for many reasons uniformly good results are 
yet far from attainment. But in respect to music and 
physical education, at least, our schools may learn much 
from Denmark. Our rural teachers should be required 
to sing, or at any rate should be able to instruct in music 
and song. And since flat chests and crooked knees are 
just as common in rural children as in town children, the 
teachers may reasonably well be expected to have train- 
ing in sanitation and physical education, including play.

CHAPTER XI 
Tue Work OF THE LocaL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS 
General Statement.-The Danish country. boys 
leave the elementary rural school at the age of fourteen 
or fifteen; then they devote three years or more to 
practical home and farm tasks. At eighteen they may 
enter the folk high schools, spending there a winter or 
two to get as large a share as possible in the cultural 
subjects. Then at nineteen or twenty or even later they 
are ready to make a final study of the technical agricul- 
tural subjects — in the local agricultural schools. 
Although the agricultural schools of Denmark are 
the direct outgrowth of the folk high schools, let us 
consider them here instead of after the folk high schools, 
which are discussed in detail from Chapter XII to the 
close of the book. 
The importance to students of a course in the folk high 
schools before they enter the agricultural schools can 
scarcely be overestimated. The life at the former 
schools has a quickening effect upon them; they learn to 
think for themselves, and they enter the agricultural

  158 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
schools ready to appropriate and apply to a larger degree 
what they find there than could otherwise have been 
possible. From figures quoted elsewhere it appears that 
about 50 per cent of all agricultural students have 
attended folk high schools for one or more winter sessions 
before entering upon their technical studies. Many 
agricultural schools, as a matter of fact, require that 
their matriculants shall have spent some time at the 
folk high schools before beginning agricultural studies. 
Captain J. C. la Cour loved to say: “ The Danish 
Agricultural School is the child of the Danish Folk High 
School, and must, like it, have Christian faith and 
national life for its basis.” The union between the two 
kinds of schools is remarkably close. In organization and 
internal management the agricultural schools are very 
similar to their prototype, the folk high schools. The 
same democratic spirit of government, the dormitory 
plan of student life, the great emphasis placed on song 
and gymnastics, the use of the lecture method whenever 
feasible — all bespeak this. 
Every agricultural school has its school farm. But, 
for that matter, so has practically every folk high school. 
Some of them have even well up towards a hundred 
acres. It is true that the latter makes use of its land 
chiefly to aid in the upkeep of the school by furnishing 
vegetables; and the agricultural schools make use of 
theirs for laboratory purposes. The amount of practical

  WORK OF THE LOCAL AGRICULTURAL SI 
work varies greatly. Some schools are content to 
closely to teaching the theory of agriculture. O 
have extensive experimental fields, herds of milk cow 
great numbers of swine and poultry; at a few school 
there are fully equipped creameries for the working up 
of the milk produced on the school farm and milk hauled 
in from neighboring farms. Several have well-equipped 
bacteriological laboratories where problems are worked 
out of the greatest value to agricultural life. Each 
separate school strives to formulate its courses to the 
needs of its own agricultural section. 
{ ” ‘The government-aided agricultural schools number 
twenty-three, which includes three special agricultural 
schools for smallhold farmers. It is the purpose to tell 
below a little of the daily life and work at three typical 
schools of this kind. Those chosen are Lyngby in Zea- 
land, Dalum in Fiinen, and Ladelund in Jutland. 
Lyngby Agricultural School. — Lyngby is one of the 
most beautiful spots in Denmark. It is only seven miles 
north of Copenhagen, and on this account is visited by 
foreign commissions and unattached educators more 
frequently than the other schools. The Lyngby com- 
munity comprises a whole system of educational institu- 
tions rather than a single school. There is the Lyngby 
Agricultural School and, right across the road from it, 
Grundtvig’s Folk High School. A government experi- 
ment farm lies contiguous to the agricultural school,

    TRURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
most unique agricultural museum adjoins the folk 
y school grounds. Besides these a codperative as- 
ciation of local farmers has experiment fields and sales 
mporiums in the school community. 
Lyngby Agricultural School was organized in 1867 by 
Captain J. C. la Cour and a local association of farmers. 
This was really an attempt to operate an agricultural 
school that has as one of its integral parts a folk high 
school department. But this arrangement did not prove 
very satisfactory. At least, the folk high school de- 
partment did not prosper. In 1890 the Grundtvig 
High School Association (organized to perpetuate the 
bishop’s name in a folk high school) purchased the agri- 
cultural school and additional land. A group of new 
buildings was erected for Grundtvig’s Folk High School, 
giving the school at the same time a separate administra- 
tion. The present status is therefore this: one associa- 
tion of schoolmen and farmers own both schools; but 
these have separate principals and separate internal 
management. Yet they work in the greatest harmony, 
so far as to use a gymnasium in common, exchanging 
lecturers and in other ways helping each other. The 
work, according to expert testimony, has been much 
more satisfactory to all concerned since the division into 
two schools. 
Lyngby Agricultural School is a good illustration of 
the substantial smaller schools of agriculture. The
-P-A-G-E-193

school farm embraces some nineteen acres only; but 
Lyngby has the opportunity to make use of important 
investigations carried on by the government on its ex- 
periment farm mentioned above. The students may 
also draw much inspiration from Grundtvig’s Folk High 
School and from study at the great Danish Agricultural 
Museum (Dansk Landbrugsmuseum) near by. 
Lyngby offers two courses for young men — one of 
six and one of nine months. Prerequisites for admis- 
sion are: (1) some familiarity with farm work, and (2) 
time spent at some folk high school. The six months’ 
course is: 
Chemistry (Inorganic and or- 
ganic). 
Physics. 
Study of Soils. 
Treatment of Soils (Including 
meadow and moorlands ; irri- 
gation and draining).

162 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
The nine months’ course includes all of the above, but 
is more detailed. Lecture courses in sociology and 
economics with special reference to rural life are added. 
Some work is also offered for students who desire to 
become “ control assistants” —i.e. local agricultural 
experts who offer advice in such subjects as dairying, 
feeding, and fertilization of soils. 
The Government experiment station is utilizing some 
one hundred and twenty-five acres of land at this time. 
The Lyngby station limits its work to cereals and root 
plants especially adapted to Zealand conditions. Highly 
scientific experiments are carried on in the comparative 
values of cereals, clover, roots, and soon. All such work 
may be observed by the students of the agricultural 
school. 
Dansk Folkemuseum is the largest museum of its 
kind in Denmark. Several large buildings are filled 
with agricultural implements, and furniture and house- 
hold utensils, arranged chronologically, covering many 
hundred years. Here the students have the opportunity 
to study the evolution in the plow or harrow from the 
simple wooden affair of the forefathers to the many 
modern implements. Harvesting, threshing, and dairy- 
ing may likewise be observed from their primitive 
beginnings to the present-day labor-saving machinery. 
Entire farmsteads, with all their outbuildings, two, 
three, or even four hundred years old, have been moved

in from various parts of Denmark, Sweden, the Faroes, 
and Iceland and rebuilt on the museum grounds at 
Lyngby. 
The codperative enterprises carried on in the com- 
munity can also be utilized to practical ends by the 
school. 
Dalum Agricultural and Dairy School. — To take the 
half hour’s walk from Odense in Fiinen out to Dalum 
Agricultural School seemed almost like making a pil- 
grimage to the shrine of Kristen Kold. His first Rys- 
linge school, it will be shown in Chapter XII, was moved 
to Dalby in northeast Fiinen, and in 1862 Kold opened 
a more pretentious school at Dalum, where he labored 
up to the time of his death in 1870. His was a great 
work and when he died no available man was found to 
continue what he had begun, with the result that the 
school eventually closed its doors, not to be reopened 
before 1886, when it was reorganized by a great school- 
man, Jorgen Petersen, as Dalum Landbrugskole. 
This school with Ladelund and Tune make the trio of 
greatest local agricultural schools in Denmark. It has 
influenced Danish agricultural life to every corner of the 
kingdom. Forty-two hundred and sixty-seven students 
have completed its courses in the twenty-six years 
of its existence. Of these thirty-one hundred and 
ninety-eight have returned to the soil as scientific farmers, 
six hundred and fifty-two have gone into the creameries,  
-P-A-G-E-196
  
  164 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
and four hundred and seventeen have become control 
assistants, or agricultural experts whose business it is 
to advise the farmers and teach them better agriculture. 
The average winter attendance is about two hundred 
and in summer only twenty-five of the most capable 
students are retained, who get the practical work of the 
farm by actually doing it under experts. This small 
group become heads of large farms, managers of dairies, 
of bacon factories, and of similar businesses. 
Dalum offers the following courses: 
1. Courses for Agriculturists. 
a. 6 months (November-April)

mestic animals). 
The nine months’ course: This presupposes the 
completion of the above six months’ course or its equiv- 
alent in some other school. The course includes all 
the studies enumerated in the six months’ course in 
addition to three months of advanced work with prac- 
tical application in laboratory and experiment field, 
during May, June, and July. 
The three months’ course: This is a continuation

course for old and advanced students. It is practical 
laboratory and field work chiefly. It covers the months 
of May, June, and July. 
COURSE FOR DAIRYMEN 
The‘ dairy school of Dalum has its own lecture 
halls, bacteriological and chemical laboratories, a large 
creamery which manufactures the milk from the school 
herd of cows and from the farms of the vicinity, and 
much other modern equipment. The course covers eight 
months’ work, from September to April. The studies: 
Chemistry Domestic Animals Arithmetic 
Physics Dairying Penmanship, and 
Machinery Farm Accounting Gymnastics 
Bacteriology Bookkeeping 
Practical Exercises 
1. Study of milk in the creamery ; testing for fats, etc. 
2. Bacteriological exercises; common bacteriological 
technique, microscopic cultures, etc. 
3. Chemical analyses of a practical kind for the dairy, 
such as testing for purity, determining per cent of water 
in butter, etc. 
4. Chemical experiments in qualitative analysis deal- 
ing with the chief inorganic and organic substances. 
COURSE FOR CONTROL ASSISTANTS 
The demand for control assistants is so urgent that the 
school has organized a special course in this field. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
WORK OF THE LOCAL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS 167 
work is open to men and women of maturity and experi- 
ence who have already completed an agricultural or 
dairy course at Dalum or at some agricultural school of 
equal rank. The work is all advanced. 
The course includes classwork and lectures on di irying, 
dairy accounting, study of feeding, study of soil tests and 
fertilizing ; with practical work in milk weighing, testing 
for fats, etc., the use of Dr. Gerber’s apparatus, keeping 
records of individual cows, etc. 
Dalum is a large school. Something like a score of 
substantial structures have sprung up around Kold’s 
original school building, which is still in use. The 
experiment fields are large and interesting. The school 
herds of cattle and swine were the best seen anywhere 
on our trip. The faculty list includes some of the ablest 
agricultural scientists in Denmark. The Principal is 
Th. Madsen-Mygdal, who has done great work for 
Danish agriculture. Another man of note is Jacob E. 
Lange who is well known for his great work in horticul- 
ture. 
Ladelund Agricultural and Dairy School. — This great 
farm school lies only an hour’s walk northwest of Askov, 
or may be reached in a few minutes by rail from Vejen 
to Brorup Station. The school embraces fifty or more 
acres of land divided into home farm, experimental 
plots, forestry station, and school campus. The latter 
contains some forty farm and school buildings.

  WORK OF THE LOCAL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS 169 
The purpose of the school is stated in the following 
language: ‘‘ Through the courses of instruction it is 
sought to give the students — who must be acquainted 
with the practical side of agriculture and dairying — such 
a foundation of knowledge as will enable them to attain a 
clearer insight into those things which they in practice 
must labor with, and hence also greater interest, greater 
returns, and greater joy in their work. This end is 
sought to be attained, partly by giving the students 
knowledge of nature that surrounds them, of the forces 
that are at work and the laws that govern, and before 
which we must yield and regulate our daily work in field 
and barn and dairy ; and partly by making known to the 
students the results of experimentation, of investigation, 
and so on, in the field of agriculture and dairying — 
results on the basis of which we must shape our practical 
activities.” + 
The school offers courses in agriculture, in dairying, 
and in the preparation of control assistants. 
The agriculture courses are three: (1) a five months’ 
course, from November to March, for young farmers 
who cannot give the growing season to study; (2) a nine 
months’ course, from November to July, for long-time 
students; and (3) a four months’ continuation course, 
from April to July, for students who have already taken 
a short preparatory course. The subjects of instruction

17o , RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
are practically the same as studied at Lyngby. The 
continuation course, however, lays great stress on prac- 
tical field work. 
The course in dairying includes: chemistry, physics, 
bacteriology, farm accounting, Danish, drawing, gymnas- 
tics, bookkeeping (for dairymen), dairy culture, history 
of agriculture, dairying, rural economics, and practical 
work in the bacteriological laboratory and school dairy. 
There are three courses for control assistants — six, 
three, and one month courses. These agricultural spe- 
cialists devote their time to giving expert advice to 
the farmers of a given community, and are paid partly 
by the community and partly by the State. Such experts 
may be found all over the land testing milk for butter-fat, 
or the cows for tuberculosis. They make soil examinations 
and give advice in such matters as what fertilizers to use 
and what rations to feed. Their work has been especially 
effective among the older farmers who have not had the 
opportunities for study now being offered. Students 
taking control-assistant courses have generally completed 
some agricultural course before matriculating in the new 
work. Here emphasis is laid on control accounting, 
milk testing, bacteriology, and the study of domestic 
animals. 
Ladelund Agricultural School is equipped with re- 
markably strong bacteriological and chemical labora- 
tories. The latter is used extensively to analyze milk,

fertilizers, and feeding stuffs from the farmsteads far 
and near. The school owns a herd of thirty-five red 
Fiinen cows, some of which yielded 16,500 pounds of 
milk annually. This milk, together with the milk from 
many hundred red cows from adjoining farms, is manu- 
factured into butter and prepared for the English markets 
at the codperative creamery which is a part of the school 
plant. This school creamery handled the past year 
fully one million kilograms of milk. 
The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural Institute. — 
It would scarcely do to close this chapter of the book 
without making some mention of the great mother school 
of agriculture, the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural 
Institute (Den Kongelige Veterinzer- og Landbohéjskole), 
situated almost at the center of Copenhagen. The 
agricultural schools discussed above are mere local 
schools intended to train practical farmers. The Royal 
Institute, on the other hand, is a school of research, and 
offers advanced courses for the training of practical 
agriculturists, horticulturists, foresters, surveyors, veter- 
inaries, and blacksmiths. Most of the teachers in the 
local agricultural schools have been trained in this great 
school. 
The college was founded in 1783, at first solely as a 
veterinary school, but afterwards it was enlarged so as to 
include agriculture and horticulture. Still later depart- 
ments were added for surveyors and foresters. In 1892
-P-A-G-E-204
  172 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
and 1893 the State contributed about 1,000,000 kroner 
for further enlargement. 
The total number of students ranges from four hundred 
to six hundred. Of these about two hundred belong to 
the veterinary group. The agricultural group is smaller, 
seldom passing one hundred and twenty-five. The rest 
are divided pretty evenly among the foresters and the 
horticulturists. The attendance is not limited to Den- 
mark. The reputation of Dr. T. Westerman, Dr. K. 
Rordam, Professor B. Bang, the great authority on 
animal tuberculosis, and other members of the faculty is 
so great that students attend from all over Northern 
Europe and even from Bulgaria, Greece, and Roumania. 
It is not the purpose to give the detailed work of the 
Institute. It is a great institution, comprising many 
acres covered with massive buildings, wherein are found 
well-equipped laboratories, libraries, and museums. 
The school forms the center of all agricultural activity 
inthekingdom. Here is, for example, the Laboratory for 
Agricultural-economic Experiments, through which im- 
portant chemical, bacteriological, physiological, and 
other experiments in dairying, feeding, and breeding of 
cattle, swine, and poultry are carried on at selected farms 
throughout the land. The laboratory pursues continu- 
ous tests of butter intended for export. Another im- 
portant arm of the service is the Serum Laboratory, 
which prepares and distributes various sera, vaccines, and
-P-A-G-E-205

4S preparations intended to stamp out disease of ee 
animals. 
vb “Finally, the twenty-five national experts in aaieuibccal = 
economics (Statens Landékonomiske Konulenter) are 
connected more or less closely with the Royal Institute. 
Four do their work under the Ministry of Agriculture, 
one is attached to the Ministry of Justice, and the re- 
maining twenty are stationed at the scattered experi- 
ment farms, and are in direct touch with the school. 
These specialists lend direct assistance to the local 
agricultural schools, and in many other ways promote 
agricultural improvement.

  CHAPTER XII 
SpEcIAL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS OF 
HovsEHOLD Economics 
General Statement. — Three special schools have been 
established for the sons and daughters of smallhold 
farmers, and, in some of their courses, for the fathers and 
mothers also. The smallholders face problems which 
call for special treatment. Seventy-five thousand such 
farmers must make a living out of from two or three to 
seven acres of land each. As the regular agricultural 
schools are organized to answer the needs more partic- 
ularly of the gaardmand, the husmand sought relief in 
these schools, which have been opened at Ringsted in 
Zealand, Odense in Fiinen, and Borris in Jutland. 
Here follows a brief description of two of these schools 
— Kerehave near Ringsted, and Fyn Stifts School near 
Odense. f 
Kerehave Husmandsskole (Smallhold School).—N. J. 
Nielsen-Klodskov, who is credited with originating the 
movement for the new schools — and who is at present 
the principal of Kerehave — states the purpose of the 
schools as being “‘ to prepare leaders who shall make the

  SPECIAL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS 175 
life of the Danish husmand so honored and recognized 
that the young sons and daughters of these homes will 
gladly choose this calling in preference to city life.” 
The schools have indeed already done much to make the 
smallholders’ lot more tolerable and their work more 
profitable. They prepare the students for intensive 
scientific farming in the same way as the agricultural 
schools are doing. But they go even farther in stress- 
ing the auxiliaries or side lines of agriculture, as chicken 
raising, rabbit breeding, and bee culture. Many of the 
smallholds would be unable to make ends meet were it 
not for the chickens, rabbits, and bees. The smallhold 
schools also lay an unusual stress on the short courses of 
eleven or more days — time enough to give people who 
are in the ruts inspiration for a new start! 
Kerehave was founded in 1903, and during the ten 
years of its existence has instructed fifty-five hundred 
students ranging in age from eighteen to seventy-five 
years. The school is the property of Principal Nielsen- 
Klodskov. A gift of 50,000 kroner from a local phil- 
anthropist, and a State loan of 60,000 kroner made 
its foundation possible. Later other friends of the 
school have given liberally to place it on a solid founda- 
tion. At this time, the school property, including the 
experimental farm of one hundred and twenty-five 
acres, is valued at half a million kroner nearly. The 
student capacity is two hundred.
-P-A-G-E-210
  176 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
The school equipment of the smallhold schools is at 
least equal to what may be seen at the best of the agricul- 
tural schools. Keerehave has a land area divided about 
as follows: ten acres used for buildings, campus, parking, 
flowers, and shrubbery; three acres of beech and oak 
forest fashioned as an outdoor auditorium for summer 
meetings; seven acres divided into parcels and used 
variously for the breeding of chickens, rabbits, hogs, 
and other fowls and animals; three acres planted to 
orchard for experimental purposes ; two acres given over 
to experiments in vegetables and for a school kitchen 
garden; four acres used exclusively for horticultural 
experiments; and, finally, ninety-six acres divided into 
interesting smallhold farms of six, twelve, eighteen, 
twenty, and forty acres respectively — the latter as 
practical object lessons in how to manage farms of 
different size. 
In variety of courses the smallhold schools take first 
place. Kerehave offers the following long and short — 
courses : 
During the Winter Session: 
Six months’ agricultural course for young farmers. 
Six months’ training course for country artisans. 
Six months’ horticultural course for young gardeners. 
Six months’ course in household economics for young 
women.

Six months’ continuation course for agriculturists. 
Six months’ course in horticulture for men. 
Throughout the Year : 
Eighteen short courses of eleven working days each, 
for older men and women, residents of Zealand. New 
courses open on the first and third Tuesdays of each 
month except October. 
Agricultural Courses. — The courses, it will be seen, are 
two of six months each. The first course covers the same 
ground as is covered in the elementary course in the aver- 
age agricultural school. It includes work in sanitation, 
gymnastics, Danish, accounting, history of agriculture, 
plant culture, domestic animals, farm bookkeeping, sur- 
veying, practical experimentation, and manual training. 
By special enactment of the Rigsdag, a liberal sum of 
money has been set aside for aid to worthy students of the 
smallhold schools. This is more liberal than in the other 
schools. For example, a worthy young man of small 
means may obtain as high as thirty kroner a month to 
help him through the six months’ course mentioned 
above. This is nearly enough to pay his way through 
the winter half year. 
But the practical and theoretical continuation c 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
     178 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
is actually planned to give the student worker an income. 
According to a law passed in 1908, students who have 
completed a course in this or other recognized agricul- 
tural or folk high school may ask admittance to the sum- 
mer continuation course and receive aid and pay through | 
the Ministry of Agriculture. 
The daily plan is about as follows: 
  
  
  Tie DEvoreD To Time DrvoTeD To Frecp Work InsTRUCTION Tipe ee Mae 
5-6.25 A.M. 4-5 P.M. 6.30-7 A.M., coffee.

II-2.30 P.M. 6-7 PM. 2.30-4. P.M., dinner 
7.30-8 P.M., supper 
      
  
The instruction embraces agriculture, plant culture, 
domestic animals, horticulture, and the auxiliaries of 
agriculture. Theory and practice go hand in hand. 
The students are divided into groups, each in charge of 
teachers and field managers. The practical work is 
done in the several experiment fields under the direction 
of the latter. During October the daily instruction is 
suspended and all time is devoted to work. 
The students receive ten kroner a month during the 
first five months and fifty kroner during October, in 
addition to free tuition, board, and lodging. Such work 
as this is learning to do by doing. It has proved re- 
markably satisfactory. A young man who applies his 
ies to the soil in the sweat of his brow is likely to get 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  SPECIAL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS 179 
his agriculture about right. At least so it has proved at 
Kerehave, which sends out annually a throng of practical 
and industrious young farmers who are well equipped for 
their life work. 
Courses in Household Economics. — The two courses 
for young women are thorough and fit their students well 
to take charge of small farm homes where the greatest 
economy must be exercised to make ends meet. 
The half-year courses are almost identical, so an out- 
line of one may answer for both of them. 
Hygiene and Sanitation (Anatomy of the human body; laws 
of health; home sanitation). 
Gymnastics (New Danish gymnastics). 
Danish (Reading, composition, and themes). 
Accounting (Common and applied arithmetic). 
History (History of civilization, history of literature, church 
history, history of the North, geography, and sociology). 
Song (Folk and patriotic songs). 
Physics (Physics of everyday life). 
Chemistry (Chemistry of the household). 
Housekeeping (Preparation of foods, baking, butchering, prac- 
tical kitchen work, drying and preserving, pickling, etc.). 
Handwork (Knitting, darning, patching, plain sewing, dress- 
making, and embroidering). 
House Management (Relation to domestics, treatment of 
clothing, the laundry). 
Sick and Child Nursing (Lectures and practical work). 
Sloyd (Basketry, patching shoes, work in pasteboard, book- 
binding, making clothes brushes, etc.). 
Bookkeeping (Practical household accounting). 
Plant Culture (Structure, life, treatment, and improvement ;
-P-A-G-E-214
     
   
   180 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
kitchen plants, small and large fruit, windbreaks, seed culture 
weeds). | 
Domestic Animals (Anatomy, life, management ; special study 
of chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, and bees). 
Practical Work (Practical application in all the above so far 
as possible). 
This course is seen to include considerable work of an 
agricultural nature. The housewife at the average 
smallhold works her own garden and may, in a pinch, 
help in the field. A considerable number of women 
still work regularly in the Danish fields; but these are 
chiefly Polish and Russian girls, who are glad to do a 
man’s work, thereby escaping the worse condition of their 
old home. Needy young women may procure aid on the 
same terms as the young men. In this way they may 
draw from the State, upon application through their 
home commune, as high as thirty kroner monthly for 
not to exceed five months. 
Eleven-day Courses for Mature Men and Women. — 
By far the most interesting are the short courses of eleven 
days each. A special appropriation has been made to 
aid men and women of small means to take advantage 
of them. Any person who by reason of his occupation 
can profit by such a course is eligible to aid. The total 
- cost of the course is thirty kroner. And the amount of 
aid is usually enough to cover both this and such other 
expenses as railroad fare to and from the school. 
The practical lessons learned in the short courses are
-P-A-G-E-215
SPECIAL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS 181 
unquestionably many and important ; but the inspiration 
gained from contact with other people with problems to 
solve, is even greater. Many a smallholder has re- 
turned home from the short courses with a new outlook 
on life, and with courage in the heart for renewed effort. 
“When my wife returned home from her eleven days at 
Kerehave,” says one man, “she looked eleven years 
younger than when she left home.”’ And so it is down 
the line with others. 
Fyn. Stifts School near Odense. — This school, also 
known under the name of Odense Husmandsskole, was 
organized by the United Associations of Smallholders in 
the Island of Fiinen in 1908. The institution is leased 
to the present principal for ten years, as the universal 
experience in Denmark has been that the success or 
failure of all these schools is closely bound up with the 
individuality of the one man at the head. 
The purpose of the school may be stated from the 
school catalogue in these words: “It is to give the 
students a good spiritual awakening and general guidance, 
and to offer them such knowledge of the professional 
subjects as shall enable them to take their place in the 
body politic and community as independent citizens, 
as farmers, in such ways that they may live economically 
independent lives, and make the most of their lot as 
smallholders. The purpose is, moreover, to give such 
knowledge and understanding of the auxiliary lines of 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  | 
182 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
agriculture that the smallholder may be enabled to keep 
his entire family together, each member to work at some 
specific avocation at home.” 
The instruction is similar to that of Kerehave. It 
embraces long and short courses for young farmers, with 
special application to smallholds; two courses for young 
women to aid them in their difficult réle as helpmeets on 
these small farms; two courses for artisans — carpen- 
ters, masons, etc. — and two courses for control assist- 
ants. 
But here, too, of greatest interest are a number of 
short courses for men and women, young and old, living 
in the open country. At this point the school is very 
close to the people, and why should not every school 
project itself into the midst of the people, to aid in solving 
their daily life problems? The investigator found at 
Odense middle-aged and old men and women mingling 
in classes with young men and women in their best 
years — the ages ranging from twenty-five to seventy- 
five years — but all with life problems to solve. Some 
come to get new insight into potato culture, others make 
a two-weeks’ study of soil from their own land, or others 
take up bee culture, rabbit breeding, or chicken raising ; 
and they all gain enough stored-up inspiration to tide 
them over the hard places of the future. 
It is hard to say whether this school or Kerehave 
attracted us the most. Both of them are well built and
-P-A-G-E-217
  
SPECIAL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS 183 
well equipped. Their grounds and experiment plots 
were especially full of interest. The school lies in an 
area of sixty-five acres. The main building is set in a 
beautiful lawn of several acres. In the left foreground 
is a complete model smallholding of seven areas. In the 
right foreground are the outbuildings of the larger farm 
(twenty-five acres) which furnishes the school with vege- 
tables, milk, and meats. There is also a horticultural 
experiment station of some seventeen acres, for the cul- 
tivation of small and large fruit, including a large kitchen 
garden and individual garden plots for students. An- 
other part of the farm has a modern hennery, a rabbitry, 
and anapiary. There is even an area of mulberry trees 
for silkworm culture. 
The model smallholding of seven acres deserves a few 
words in passing. Upon it a model home has been 
erected, adapted to the size of the farm. It contains a 
suite of four rooms for the family, a barn for the cows and 
stall room for a horse, besides room for grain, fodder, and 
machinery. And all of this is under one roof — but it is 
, all built so substantially and is kept so clean that it 
never becomes unsanitary or a nuisance. Over the stall 
of each cow is kept a record of the weekly production in 
milk and butter-fat; and if a cow should fall below a 
certain minimum it would go immediately to the butcher. 
Because the smallholder’s land is very limited, dwarf 
apple trees and long-stemmed cherry trees are grown,
-P-A-G-E-218
184 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
the latter often along the driveways where they combine 
the useful with the attractive. Dwarf apple trees are 
planted from nine to ten feet apart. Some of them 
yield amazingly. A perfect system of rotation is fol- 
lowed in the smallhold. Every foot of ground is utilized 
and records are kept of everything produced and sold, 
and everything purchased. The young farmers who 
make a special study of this model smallhold are able to 
attack their own farm problems with eyes wide open. 
Rural Schools of Household Economics. — Separate 
schools to prepare country girls for their later life respon- 
sibilities is a comparatively new thing in Denmark, 
although housemother schools have been popular in the 
towns for many years. Not more than a dozen rural 
schools of this sort are yet recognized by the state, 
though seventeen or more are in operation. 
All of the folk high schools offer summer courses for 
young women, especially of the inspirational order, and 
several thousand students attend them annually. Class- 
work in sewing and needlework, lectures on sanitation 
and other important themes, are included in these 
summer courses. But this has never been considered 
sufficient preparation for the responsibilities of house- 
keeping. It is an old custom in Denmark to send the 
young women, as soon as betrothed, to some large 
country home — the manse or the home of the country 
squire — to take a year’s work in practical housekeeping.  
-P-A-G-E-219
  SPECIAL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS 185 
This has unquestionably been a fine training for Danish 
housewives. But even the best homes are not expected 
to know many of the latest things which science is 
thrusting upon the schools and which schools alone can 
supply. With the demand for agricultural schools in 
which to train scientific young farmers came a natural 
insistence that the helpmeets of these young men should 
be afforded equal opportunities — hence the rural schools 
of household economics. 
The schools are built in the open country or on the 
outskirts of some rural-minded village. It usually has 
land enough — three to five acres —to furnish vege- 
tables, milk, and butter for school consumption. A first- 
class vegetable and fruit garden is used as a laboratory 
where the young women do much individual work. The 
flower garden, too, receives its share of attention. 
The young women are expected to reside at the school 
during their continuance there. The courses are usually 
six months in length. This enables the schools — which 
often run the entire year — to train two sets of students 
each year. The buildings are equipped with model 
kitchen, dining room, living room, and chambers, 
all of them intended as models for practical farm 
homes. 
Some idea of the scope and thoroughness of the schools 
may be obtained from the following brief description of 
one such school — Haraldsborg near Roskilde. 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
186 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
Haraldsborg School of Household Economics. — This 
school lies on the beautiful ridge of hills overlooking 
Roskilde Fjord, about twenty minutes’ walk from the 
railway station. The housemother, Fru Anna Bransager- 
Nielsen, limits the number of resident students to thirty- 
five, who are treated as members of the family. These 
are grouped for convenience into five families of seven 
each. At the time of our visit, three families had 
charge of the model kitchen, one family was occupied 
in the living-rooms and bed chambers, and the re- 
maining family was hard at work in the dressmaking 
rooms. 
The school is a marvel of neatness. What seemed 
most valuable in this system of preparation was not so 
much what the young women learned to do, as the right 
habits of life inculcated with the work of the day. 
Haraldsborg is large enough to produce the vegetables, 
milk, meats, etc., consumed at the school. Four acres 
are devoted to lawn and flowers, and ten acres to the 
farm, which keeps a span of horses, a couple of cows, and 
some pigs. 
The course of study includes the following subjects: 
Natural Science (Chemistry and physics, with special reference 
to the household). 
Housekeeping (Preparation of foods; food values, theory of 
household economics ; household accounting; baking, butchering, 
curing meats; pickling, cleaning house, dining-room work, wash- 
ing, and ironing). 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  SPECIAL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS 187 
Handwork (Plain sewing, dressmaking, patching, darning, fine 
needlework and embroidery). 
Sanitation (Study of human anatomy; laws of health, home 
sanitation). 
Garden Culture (Care of kitchen, fruit and flower gardens, 
preparing vegetables and fruit for keeping and winter use). 
Other Subjects (Song, gymnastics, literature, rural sociology, 
and reviews in any of the elementary subjects wherein the students 
may prove deficient).

that while the 
 
-P-A-G-E-223

schools do not immediately emphasize the so-called 
worldly-practical, they do give something instead that 
has proved of vastly greater importance — a broad 
culture, furnishing its possessor with a keen world-out- 
look, making him altruistic, strong in love of God and 
fellow man, of home and soil and native land. Above 
everything else, the life lived in the schools imparts a 
deep confidence and trust in man to man, thereby 
making possible all the remarkable codperative enter- 
prises spoken of elsewhere. And last of mention, the 
folk school life has made clear to its students that success 
in life should be measured by standards other and higher 
than mere money standards, and with such practical 
results that achievement for land and people is in Den- 
mark esteemed to-day far above successful accumulation 
of wealth. The teacher, the preacher, the economist, 
who gives his best for his country holds higher rank 
than the man who has heaped up great fortunes. 
Testimony of Leading Economists and Schoolmen. — 
That the folk high schools are to be credited with organiz- 
ing and systematizing Danish agriculture seems almost 
incredible at first. Foreign educators and parliamentary 
and congressional commissions have come to study the 
schools in skeptical mood and have gone away convinced. 
- One needs go no farther than take the testimony of the 
Danish leaders themselves. On all his trip of investiga- 
tion, the writer could find no man willing to give the credit
-P-A-G-E-224
  | 
190 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
to an organization other than the folk hich schools. To be sure, many would point to contribu ry causes and the good work of the local agricultural schools; but even these are the “rightful children” of the folk high schools. 
Says Poul la Cour, the late lamented scientist of Askov: “ Just as an enrichment of the soil gives the best conditions for the seeds sown in it, so the horizon-broaden- 
ing, well-grounded training of the folk high schools provides the surest basis for business capacity, and not the least so in the case of the coming farmer.” So much for the general cultural value of the folk high school education. Speaking on another occasion in regard to the almost phenomenal spread of codperation, he says: “The resoluteness and capacity with which Danish 
farmers passed ae from making a quantity of poor butter on the smaller farms and holdings up and down the country to the manufacturing in codperative dairies of a butter of almost uniform fineness is no doubt the consequence of their having had expert leaders like the late N. J. Fjord, without whom no Progress could have been made. But the question remains how a great agricultural population in so short a time could be induced to follow directions and carry the matter through.” 
By way of getting us answer to his query, Mr. la Cour 
sent out a questionnaire to nine hundred and seventy 
codperative dairies dad two hundred and sixty dairies of 
   
-P-A-G-E-225
    
THEIR EVOLUTION IQr 
a private nature. Unfortunately, only four hundred and 
thirty-six of these made answer; but even this was sufficient to give a good idea of how these leaders are trained. The answers showed that of the men in charge 
of the plants, 47 per cent had attended some folk high 
school, 62 per cent some dairy school, 24 per cent had attended some local agricultural school, and go per cent 
had been at one or another of these schools, which are all 
imbued with some degree of Grundtvig’s philosophy. 
Principal Alfred Poulsen of Ryslinge speaks in similar 
vein on the same subject. “The quickness and preci- 
sion,” he says, “ with which this change was carried out 
is due partly to the leading agriculturists of our country and partly to the high schools. By their help a set of young, energetic men were brought up to understand 
the importance of the new ideas, and to secure the success 
of the new principle of codperative manufacture. Some of them, after a very short course of professional instruc- tion, were able to undertake the responsible work as managers of the larger and smaller coéperative dairies.” ! Hon. M. P. Blem of Copenhagen, one of the keenest 
of the modern agricultural leaders, in conversation with the writer declared that “the greatest factor in our national agricultural life is the high schools; for at these a staff of able young men and women is annually being trained and sent out, men and women who, with open 
eee Poulsen, “The Danish Popular High School,” p. 14.  
-P-A-G-E-226
    192 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
eye and undaunted courage, go out into practical farming 
life and with energy and understanding perform the 
work they have been trained and perfected in.” 
Sir Horace Plunkett, who has himself made a careful 
study of agriculture in Denmark, says: ‘A friend of 
mine who was studying the Danish system of state aid 
to agriculture, found this [that the extraordinary national 
progress was due to the folk high schools] to be the 
opinion of the Danes of all classes, and was astounded 
at the achievements of the associations of farmers not 
only in the manufacture of butter, but in a far more 
difficult undertaking, the manufacture of bacon in large 
factories equipped with all the most modern machinery 
and appliances which science had devised for the pro- 
duction of the finished article. He at first concluded 
that this success in a highly technical industry by bodies 
of farmers indicated a very perfect system of technical 
education. But he soon found another cause. As one 
of the leading educators and agriculturists of the country 
put it to him: ‘It’s not technical instruction, it’s the 
humanities.’ ” ? 
A great mass of similar evidence could be furnished 
to show how the folk high school influence is viewed by 
those intimate with the schools; but enough testimony

Denmark, p. 7.

  THEIR EVOLUTION 193 
has already been introduced to satisfy the reader on the 
point of the importance of the part played by them in 
Danish national life. It is now time to ask just how these 
schools originated, and how they have grown into their 
present power and influence. These queries will be 
answered in the following section. 
Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig (1783-1872). — 
To tell the story of the beginnings of the Danish folk 
high schools is virtually to unfold the narrative of the 
long and useful life of its originator, Bishop Grundtvig. 
This master mind dominated the educational and theo- 
logical world in the North for nearly three quarters of a 
century, and placed the indelible stamp of his spirit 
upon the national life in Denmark and, to a lesser degree, 
in Norway and Sweden. Poet, philosopher, historian, 
and educator, not only did he become the schools’ 
spiritual father, but his philosophy of civilization has 
come to form the pedagogical foundation of the schools, 
and his religious zeal has given them their marked charac- 
teristics, making these schools distinctive in the educa- 
tional world. 
Grundtvig came of an ancient, worthy family. From 
his mother, who sprang from an ancestry renowned in 
national annals, he inherited a love of historic research. 
He lived in a world of books till the age of nine, when, 
according to the custom of the day, he entered the house- 
hold of a minister near Vejle, on the edge of the gloomy 
°o
-P-A-G-E-228
  194 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
Jutish heather, where he spent six years in preparation 
for the Latin school. While roaming the heather, young 
Grundtvig became intimate with the somber life of the 
folk living on the monotonous moor, a fact which stood 
him well in stead when his life work for the common 
people began. 
In 1798 he entered the Latin school at Aarhus and 
spent there, as he later tells, two wasted years. For this 
institution was one of the narrow, scholastic type preva- 
lent in those days, where natural boys were compelled to 
absorb much Latin and catechism through a meaningless 
memoriter process. The result of it all was that from 
this time onward Grundtvig became the irreconcilable 
foe of the old aristocratic Latin schools with their deaden- 
ing formalism and disdain for the masses of the people. 
In 1800 he came to Copenhagen to prepare for his univer- 
sity entrance examinations. - Here he almost immediately 
fell under the influence of Dr. Steffens, the friend of 
Goethe, Schiller, Fichte, and Schelling, through whose 
inspiring lectures he was first carried into a new thought 
world of philosophy, history, and literature, which was 
later destined to change his entire life and the thought- 
life of the nation. 
An impossible love affair awakened the poetic in 
Grundtvig’s nature, who despairingly strove to drown his 
passion in Goethe, Schiller, and Shakespeare. His poems 
and translations soon began to appear in leading periodi- :
-P-A-G-E-229
  THEIR EVOLUTION 195 
cals. Especially did he enter heart and soul upon the 
study of Norse mythology, and in 1808 his great work, 
“Norse Mythology,” was published. His fame im- 
mediately spread over northern Europe, Frederik 
Schlegel in his enthusiasm proclaiming Grundtvig Den- 
mark’s greatest poet. ; 
These had been trying years for the war-pressed nation. 
The unwelcome alliance with Bonaparte; the desperate 
naval battle with Lord Nelson’s English fleet in Copen- 
hagen harbor; later the bombardment of Copenhagen ; 
the desperate though hopeless resistance of the remnants 
of a one-time proud naval force — all had a paralyzing 
effect on the feeling of nationality among the masses. 
At least so it seemed to the young enthusiast, who with 
sorrow contrasted the time in which he lived with the 
days when Danish ravens scoured every sea and Norse 
viking names struck terror in craven hearts. The people, 
he felt, no longer knew the glorious story of Valhalla and 
the ancient gods. Their very origin, as sons of fhe free, 
unconquered North, even seemed to have lost its mean- 
ing. He must write and translate and through books 
acquaint this people with their own glorious past and so 
inspire them to future deeds! Thus began long years of 
literary activity, making him, perhaps, the most volu- 
minous.of Danish writers. 
In spite of the fact that his manuscripts would have 
filled at least 30,000 octavo pages he was in no sense a
-P-A-G-E-230
196 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
  bookworm. His was properly a great pan-Germanic 
spirit, ever striving for expression. It has been said of 
Grundtvig “that he dreamed so mightily that he made 
a world thereof.” His researches, so patiently carried on, 
were not for the mere love of study but for the fruits he 
could bring the people. Poetry was to him the language 
of the heart, through which he best could touch respond- 
ing chords in the hearts of others. 
Meanwhile, Grundtvig had completed his theological 
education and entered the active pastorate. Almost 
immediately he found himself plunged into a struggle 
against all that was false and formal in the state church. 
This led to an open break with officialdom and high 
church dignitaries. Finally, the pulpit was closed 
against his polemics, but not before the demand for 
reforms had gone too far to be checked ; and Grundtvig 
lived to see a new freedom in church organization adopted 
by the country, in keeping with the other reforms in- 
spired by him. 
In 1828 Grundtvig retired from the active ministry, 
and the historian, poet, and student of research in him 
again steps into the foreground. During the great 
activity of this period he translated Snorre Sturlason’s 
Heimskringla from the Icelandic, and put Saxo Gramma- 
ticus’ Chronicles of Denmark from Latin into homely 
Danish. Similarly, he translated Beowulf from the 
Anglo-Saxon into Danish. .These gigantic tasks were
-P-A-G-E-231
  
  THEIR EVOLUTION 197 
inspired by a love for the masses, in a desire to make the 
great literature of the Old North available to all. His 
purpose was to bring the glorious past to the common 
people in such simple and attractive garb that the 
slumbering memories of a great ancestry would stir the 
discouraged among them to renewed effort. Nor were 
his hopes misplaced, as shall be seen. 
About this time, Grundtvig made several trips into 
England, where he pursued his researches at Oxford and 
Cambridge. Here it came to him as an unpleasant 
shock that England had a throbbing, pulsating folk life 
which stood in striking contrast to the sluggish indiffer- 
ence of the peasantry at home. Again he had found his 
spur to further effort. When he returned home it was as 
a Columbus “ with sunshine in his eye and a new world 
in his heart.” 
“ Awake! Awake! O Danish Knighthood, 
Day and Deed spell Hero Rhyme.” 
“ By this time,” says Dr. Hollmann, “ he was clear in 
his own mind that books are the shadows only of the liv- 
ing word; his own experience had clearly enough taught 
him that no people can be roused by books alone, even 
though these may be ever so soulful. He even went so 
far as to smile at his own impatience, that neither the 
old nor the new writings could give new life to the Norse 
spirit and the Danish tree of life.”* From now on, 
1 Hollmann, Dr. A. H., “Den Danske Folkehdjskole,” p. 20. 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  198 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
plans for a school that could bind all classes together 
through a common folk culture were gradually taking 
form in his mind. At first it looked as though Grundtvig 
might organize the work in person; but this was not to 
be. He became reconciled to stand as the great inspirer 
and left the practical realization to others, perhaps 
better fitted for this phase of the work.

asserts Grundtvig, “is the creative period of the spirit 
when the great hopes and visions appear that foreshadow 
"the period of maturity, and when the soul reaches out 
for the cloak that fits it.” He would place the youth - 
_ under inspired and inspiring teachers at a time when 
| impressionable to the noblest ideals in life. There must 
, be an awakening of the spirit. The youth are to be 
‘taken in hand towards the close of the period of adoles- 
cence when all young people are ready ‘to hitch their 
little wagon to a star,’ when the fires of hope burn bright. 
To get them to pause, to think, to ask themselves the 
questions, “‘ What are we?” and ‘“‘ Why are we?”’—to 
turn introspectively and examine into their own souls in 
search of the purpose of life . . . all this is the first work 
of the “ inspirers.” With some glimmer of comprehen- 
sion of life purpose comes the birth of altruism and love 
of fellow man. Now the awakening is carried on apace. 
It is to be Christian, historical, national, and individual. 
Such work calls for great teachers —men who are 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  THEIR EVOLUTION 199 
“ gifted with enthusiasm for what is historically true, 
ethically noble, and esthetically beautiful ” ; and for “a 
continuation of the best home influence, only intensified 
and broadened.” + Denmark has been fortunate in such 
teachers, and the schools, in their daily life, furnish the 
intensified home influence. 
Grundtvig abhorred the narrow humanistic schools of 
his day. He called them “ the black school” and the 
“ school for death.” ‘The chief characteristic of the 
prevailing humanism,” he asserted, “ was to turn its 
back upon the homelike and ‘ folkly. >” The Roman 
flood, as he called the learning of the day, was a tragedy 
which had robbed the north-European nations of much 
of what was innermost and best. The schools had given 
stones instead of bread, and filled the youth with ques- 
tionable impressions of a foreign culture at the expense of 
their own virile northern culture. 
Grundtvig had practical reasons as well for com- 
bating the so-called learned schools of his day. “ All 
these institutions have the fault,” he said, “ that they 
embitter their students against ordinary work-a-day 
activities, so that they lose all desire to handle hammer, 
tongs, and plow, and can no longer feel happy in the 
ordinary manual activities.”* The learned schools 
trained the few to become professors in the university and

  RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
to hold “ fat livings ” in government office. Meanwhile, 
the masses were left to shift for themselves. The’folk 
high school philosophy came asa powerful protest against 
this prevailing system and led to its ultimate overthrow. 
Grundtvig’s Early Ideas of What the School should 
Be. — The great bishop never outlined a: definite plan 
for the school; but he did promulgate, from time to 
time, as his ideas on the subject became crystallized, 
the great working principles around which the school is 
built. It was left for Kristen Kold and others to make 
the practical application in the school. 
First of all, the ultimate aim of the schools must not 
be “examinations followed by a government living ” 
but rather a culture, an enlightenment, which shall be 
its own reward. The main thing must be, “ that which 
is living, mutual, and simple ” — that which every man 
can afford to seek because it is both useful and will add 
zest and enjoyment to life. 
Secondly, books must not be unduly emphasized. 
This does not mean the wholesale condemnation of 
books, but is a protest against the useless heaping up of 
book-learning for no other purpose, seemingly, than to 
pass an examination. Books will continue as necessary 
compendiums, that is true. But in the new schools, 
the voice from the speaker’s stand shall wing the teacher’s 
personality to the students, so that individual students 
may feel their own personality quickened into life.
-P-A-G-E-235
  THEIR EVOLUTION 201 
Again, the method used in presenting the subjects is as 
important, if not more so, than the subject matter. 
Grundtvig exclaims, “It is in nowise enough —al- 
though necessary —in the Danish folk high schools to 
strive to acquaint the youth with the mother tongue, 
with history, sociology, and statistics, with constitution 
and law, administration and municipal affairs; for this 
might all be done in such a stiff, dead, tiresome, and even 
‘un-Danish ’ way that the folk school would become an 
empty shadow or a land plague.””* The school was to be 
based on the historic-poetical and above all have a 
decided national stamp. That Grundtvig should em- 
phasize the national element above everything else is 
readily explainable in the Danish struggle for national 
existence, crowded and threatened by the world powers 
as was the kingdom. 
The use of the Danish “ folkelig,” which everywhere 
appears in Grundtvig’s system, carries a deeper meaning 
than our “ popular.” The German “ Vélkisch ” comes 
nearer to expressing it. It is “ popular,” but it is “‘ pop- 
ular” in its nationalistic setting. When Grundtvig 
emphasizes the national element as necessary in the 
schools, he ‘‘ meant thereby, what he himself was — a 
deep national personality, grown up in the historic soil 
of the fatherland, bearing the imprint of its language, 
and soul-inspired by its ‘ folkly ’ peculiarities.” ? 
1 “Smaaskrifter,” p. 181. ? “Den Danske Folkehdjskole,” p. 25.
-P-A-G-E-236
  202 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
In consequence, the folk high school should concern 
itself first of all with the fatherland, with its nature, 
its history, its needs, its occupations, and its shortcom- 
ings. First in the list of subjects must come the mother 
tongue and all that belongs to it — literature, song, 
music, and the like. 
The folk high school has been highly successful in 
teaching its students to express themselves in pure, 
ringing Danish, and to sing the virile folk songs and hero 
ballads. Likewise, it has created a taste for the fine 
old Norse Sagas and the best in more recent literature. 
All this may seem to vary in nowise from the ordinary 
curriculum. One must be in the schools and follow the. 
methods used, and feel the spirit of the students to under- 
stand fully. Grundtvig himself used the purest of Danish 
and his prose writings have had a purifying effect on the 
language; his psalms are sung everywhere in Danish 
churches, and his folk songs, to this day, hold first place 
in the average home. 
To digress a little here, Dr. Hollmann, who has studied 
the schools carefully, has this to say about the remarkable 
influence of language study in the folk high schools on 
, the nation at large: “The foreigner is surprised as a 
_ tule, when he hears that in Denmark plain peasants 
are the leaders of debate in the Rigsdag and control 
| the more important government offices; and he is even 
more surprised when he has the opportunity to hear
-P-A-G-E-237
THEIR EVOLUTION 203 
them give their views on important questions in the 
Rigsdag or at agricultural meetings. . . . The foreigner 
will, perhaps, be even more surprised, when he hears in 
the Danish folk high schools lectures given to young 
people of nothing more than ordinary common school 
preparation, on Hegel, Schleiermacher, and the more 
modern philosophical and social problems.” * The 
“living word ” in these schools does not usually concern 
itself with what one would call “popular” lectures; it 
strives to make real thinkers out of the sturdy, red-fisted 
youths on the school benches, by offering the best food 
for thought; and it teaches them to express themselves 
in pure, incisive Danish. 
Then, again, the schools must be supplied with teachers 
able to use the “ living word ” so intimately, so soulfully, 
so poetically as to bridge the span between speaker and 
hearers. \Thisis really the very foundation of the folk high 
school system and the secret of its success. Those of the 
teachers who have been most successful in their work have 
not been noted for great oratorical gift, nor have they 
employed the intimately technical methods of the 
searching scientist. The middle ground has been theirs. 
“ These men,” says Hollmann, “ speak without ecstasy, 
use no bombastic, flowery language; but throughout 
the lecture there courses a deep undercurrent of feeling 
that goes right to the heart and holds the attention. 
1 “Den Danske Folkehdjskole,” p. 36. 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
204 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
They speak as would men of a rich inner life concerning 
the matters they deal with; much as the rays from a 
lighthouse that penetrate the surface of the deep, so as 
to light up for the moment the turmoil of the rolling 
billows in the otherwise monotonous darkness.” ! 
Finally, the work of the school must rest on a historical 
foundation. The subject matter shall not lay emphasis 
on mere facts, chronological arrangement, and memori- 
ter processes. Grundtvig would prefer to see it taught 
as did the old Norse skjalds or minnesingers, who through 
fiery song told the valor of old, to spur the living to greater 
deeds. To him the history of the fatherland was a living 
story which should be narrated from man to man, from 
generation to generation. With all this, the practical 
side of life was not to be neglected. He would empha- 
size “ statistics” or, as now understood, economics and 
sociology. There should also be an understanding of 
the constitution and law of the land. Even a study 
of local municipal affairs is hinted at in some of his 
writings. 
It should be made clear here that Grundtvig warns 
against all manner of technical instruction in the schools. 
He believed sincerely that such would be impossible 
alongside of the general culture. Practical agriculture, 
for example, and the application of codperative enter- 
prise through the schools held no place in his plans. 
* “Den Danske Folkehéjskole,” p. 40. 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  
  THEIR EVOLUTION 205 
It is true that had he lived in our day, he would, with- 
out question, have included the history of agriculture, 
the theory of codperative enterprise, and like subjects in 
the curriculum. But the fact remains that he did not, 
and whatever of innovation has come in recent years 
must be accredited to other leaders. 
King Christian VIII Invited to Open a “ Royal Free 
School for Life.” — It early became Grundtvig’s dearest 
hope to see a high school for the people established at 
historic Soré in Zealand. Here, on the site of one of the 
most noted ‘monasteries of the Middle Ages, stands 
“Sord Akademi,” the best endowed and most noted 
classical school in the kingdom aside from the National 
University. He eagerly set about convincing King 
Christian VIII of the vast significance of such a step for 
the future welfare of the people. The Queen, Caroline 
Amalie, became his enthusiastic ally. “ If King Chris- 
tian VIII, as I gladly hope,” says Grundtvig, “ opens 
such a Royal Free School for Life, for popular life in 
Denmark, he will be able, not merely to smile at the 
papers when they praise or blame him, but also to rejoice 
in a popular remedy just as wonderful as our absolute 
kings; for he has therein opened a well of healing in the 
land, which will be sought by crowds from generation to 
generation and will win this renown, even in distant 
lands and in far future days, that therein, past counting, 
blind people received their light, the deaf their hearing, 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  206 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
and the dumb their speech, and that there the halt cast 
away their crutches and showed clearly that the dance 
trips it clearly through the wood.” + 
The king was practically converted to Grundtvig’s 
views, and requested him to outline a definite plan for 
the school. Meanwhile unexpected difficulties were en- 
countered in the bitter opposition of numbers of the 
University faculty and the Minister of Education. This 
led the king to postpone the matter, and with his sudden 
death in 1848, all hope of realization was abandoned. 
But probably this was fortunate for the future of the 
folk high schools. As it later proved, the strength of the 
school has lain in its leadership ; if this is unworthy, the 
school — being a private enterprise—can easily be 
“ snuffed out ” and a new one begun by other leaders. 
For, it should be recalled, the strength of these schools 
has never been in imposing buildings nor excellent equip- 
ment but in leadership solely. 
Rédding Folk High School Founded. — It was stated 
elsewhere that the first of the folk high schools came into 
being in North Slesvig at a time when national existence 
was threatened there. ‘The common people were Danish 
speaking, but the government officials were, for the most 
part, German sympathizers and adherents of the House of 
Augustenburg. It is not surprising that the folk high 
school should take root in such patriotic seed ground.

-P-A-G-E-241
  THEIR EVOLUTION 207 
Dr. Christian Flor, who was Professor of Danish language 
and literature at Kiel University, became the great 
champion in the movement to establish the Rédding 
School. When it was opened in 1844 to a score of peasant 
lads, it would have been hard to see anything in this 
humble institution to betoken the great future destined 
to come to the new kind of school. 
The purpose of the school was stated in the school’s 
first circular and reads as follows: ‘“ The aim set is to 
found an institution where peasant and burgher can 
attain useful and desirable arts, not so much with im- 
mediate application to his particular calling in life as 
with reference to his place as a native son of the land 
and a citizen of the state. We call it a high school be- 
cause it is not to be an ordinary school for growing chil- 
dren, but an institution of learning in part for young 
people above the confirmation age, in part for full grown 
men — and we call it a folk high school because members 
of every station in life may gain admittance to it, al- 
though it is primarily adapted to the needs of the 
peasantry and from it the school chiefly looks for its 
students.” 4 
Rodding had a stirring existence. The first principal, 
Johan Wegener, resigned after a year, compelled by 
_ financial and other difficulties. Then Dr. Flor, himself, 
led the destinies of the school until the uprising broke 
1 Schréder, “Den Nordiske Folkehdjskole,” p. 46.
-P-A-G-E-242
  208 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
out against Danish authority in 1848. The school re- 
mained closed down to 1850 when Dr. Flor once more | 
succeeded in putting it upon its feet. But no sooner had 
the financial and political difficulties been smoothed over 
than a difference fraught with the greatest importance 
to the future of these schools reached a crisis. This was 
what might be called a struggle between spirit and 
matter. The faculty was about evenly divided on the 
question whether the school should continue as a cultural 
institution or become a school of technical instruction. 
A heated and often bitter period of discussion followed ; 
but it ended finally with Grundtvig’s philosophy winning 
the victory. 
In 1862, one of Denmark’s greatest folk high school 
leaders, Ludvig Schréder, cast his lot with the destinies 
of Rodding. In 1864, the German war broke out and, 
again, the school was abandoned. At the conclusion of ~ 
peace the friends of the institution moved it from Rédding 
across to the other side of the new boundary line. Here, 
under the name: of Askov Folkehéjskole, it has grown 
under Ludvig Schréder’s leadership to become the 
greatest of all the folk high schools. 
Rodding could not be called typical of the folk high 
schools. It was too closely tied up with the purpose of 
preserving nationality and mother tongue in North 
Slesvig to make of it such a factor in folk culture as the 
schools of present-day Denmark have become. 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
Pr ee THEIR EVOLUTION 2090 
Kristen Kold (1816-1870), the Real Organizer of the 
Folk High Schools. — Bishop Grundtvig’s folk high 
school ideas were in a sense an abstraction containing 
certain fundamental principles for a unique national 
education. But he never reduced his philosophy to the 
tangible, so as to give expression to a crystallized system, 
applicable to time and place. This certainly does not 
diminish the importance of Grundtvig’s work in the great 
cause of popular education. He must continue to stand 
preéminently as the “‘ great inspirer.” 
Of those who realized Grundtvig’s theories in practice, 
Kristen Kold should have first place —and this, not 
because he did so much more than others, but because he 
pointed the way and gave the schools the first impetus 
in the right direction. He was born in 1816, the son of a 
shoemaker, who originally intended the boy to follow the 
cobbler’s trade. But, after much beseeching, his parents 
permitted him to become a school teacher. He spent   two years (1843-1845) at Snedsted Teachers’ Seminary, 
and this was followed by a period as tutor in private 
families and as assistant teacher in various schools. 
It dawned upon him by degrees that the methods of 
teaching then in vogue were wrong and often even cruel. 
One day he found a little girl pupil weeping bitterly 
because she could not learn a difficult explanation in the 
catechism. Then it was that Kold asked himself, 
“ Can it really be God’s will that children be thus tor- 
a
-P-A-G-E-244
    210 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
tured with learning by rote?” Then and there he 
broke every established usage in the traditional system ; 
for, As the book aside, he began talking over the 
substance of the lesson with the children, explaining it 
to them in detail, and permitting them to ask questions 
upon it. This innovation led to a breach with the 
archdeacon, the bishop, and the Minister of Education, 
and in a short while the public schools were closed against 
him. He then spent two years in Smyrna as a missionary. 
On the way home he became practically stranded at 
Trieste for want of funds. The indomitable courage of 
the man can be seen in the way he returned to Denmark. 
Spending his last penny for a small draw cart, he put all 
his earthly belongings into this and started northward 
overland. It took over two months to make the journey ; 
but, he says, “Tt was worth it.” Kold had the kind of 
nerve required in those days of the successful reformer ; 
for to suggest any kind of school reform invariably 
meant to invite the opprobrium of the whole learned 
officialdom. 
Kristen Kold was stirred mightily by the reform move- 
ment and the wave of liberal thought that swept over 
Europe during the middle of the last century. He 
played a humble réle in helping to quell the uprising in 
the Duchies in ’48; then returning home filled with 
pride and zeal because of Danish victories against great 
odds he wondered how such an outburst of national feel-
-P-A-G-E-245
  THEIR EVOLUTION 211 
ing could be kept alive in the people “so that all its 
members could take part in the great national questions 
and live in the national history.” 
Now Kold began a unique experiment. While tutor 
in the family of the well-known clergyman, Vilhelm 
Birkedal, he requested and received permission to take 
in and instruct four young peasants in addition to his 
regular pupils. The result proved so satisfactory that 
Kold determined to resign his place and organize a small 
school of his own. With his savings he secured a piece 
of land for the school. But, as his means were insufficient 
to carry out the enterprise, he laid his plans before 
Grundtvig who immediately headed a subscription list 
for the new school, at the same time commending Kold 
to the good offices of other friends of the high school 
idea. A sufficient sum of money was raised and Kold 
opened the school at Ryslinge, Fiinen, in the fall of 1851, 
with fifteen students ranging in age from fourteen to 
thirty-three years. This was before Kold had decided to 
follow Grundtvig’s advice to exclude all below eighteen 
years of age. The school gave instruction — mostly by 
the lecture method —in the history of the world, in 
Norse history, Bible history, northern mythology and 
geography, together with readings in Danish and Scan- 
dinavian literature, and practice in singing, especially the 
old folk songs and hero ballads. Considerable emphasis 
was placed, in addition to this, on a review of the ele- 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
212° RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
mentary school subjects which were now taught in such 
a way as to make them immediately applicable to daily 
life. | 
All went well until Kold and his adherents undertook 
to reform the elementary schools of the island. Then 
all his opponents rallied against him and for a while it 
looked dark for the future of the school. But through 
it all his students were stanchin their support. Finally, 
a government board was sent to examine and catechize 
the students to see whether the charge could be substan- 
tiated that the school taught nothing but foolishness. 
The crisis in the examination came, according to Kold 
himself, when the examining dean asked the husky farm 
lads this question: “ Who checked and defeated Atilla 
the Hun?” But almost instantly a young peasant 
from Jutland answered: “ Aitius.” This helped. The 
board had come in a critical mood and went away con- 
vinced that the school was doing a genuine work for the 
community. The commission recommended that the 
state aid be increased, and thus the school was saved. 
Before all this happened, Kold had moved his school 
from Ryslinge to Dalby in northeast Fiinen where he 
worked successfully for nine years. The. number of 
students grew year by year, necessitating larger quarters. 
Mr. Kold, accordingly, acquired a farm of considerable 
size at Dalum, near Odense, where he erected substantial 
buildings. Here, from 1862 till the time of his death 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
THEIR EVOLUTION 213 
eight years later, the great high school man continued 
his noble work. In those years at least thirteen hundred 
students sat in his classes, becoming inspired to go out 
and live right and useful lives. 
Kold left no writings of value behind ; he was a man of 
action — aman of deeds. His voice has passed away, it is 
true, but the seed he sowed has multiplied a thousand 
fold. Says Hollmann: “ Kold reminds one in more than 
one way of the great Greek philosopher, who did service 
as midwife to bring truth into the world; he was Socratic 
too, in the even tenor of his mode of life, as well as in his 
method.” He had a way of awakening all that was 
good and noble in his auditors, and could impress them 
with the surpassing value of clean, noble living. Kold 
was more than an instructor of his pupils. He was their 
friend and adviser. Because he remained unmarried 
until late in life he was able to spend all his time among 
them. He presided at the common table by day and 
dwelt in the same rooms with the young men at night. 
The striking home and group life which marks the folk 
high school originated with him. The summer schools 
for young women, also, were originated by him. 
Kold’s school fell far short of Grundtvig’s ideals of 
what such a school for universal folk culture should be; 
but he gave the masses of the people all they were pre- 
pared for at that time. Some of the folk high schools 
1 “Den Danske Folkehdjskole,” p. 63. 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
214 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
were founded by men of much greater academic training 
than had Kold, though none got as great a hold on the 
common people as he. Now, after half a century of 
evolution, we find throughout the land a system of folk 
high schools which combines the best of Kold’s homely 
wisdom with the learning of his better academically 
trained compeers at Rédding and Askov. 
When the War of 1864 broke out there were less than 
a dozen of the schools in existence, But the disastrous 
war furnished the necessary spur. In a short time they 
were springing up on every side to become the centers 
from which the national reorganization began. At the 
time of writing, four score such schools are busy in every 
part of the kingdom, inspiring young and old with the 
‘ best life ideals, teaching them to work for a nobler 
nationalism and a greater Denmark.

THEIR ORGANIZATION AND METHODS oF INSTRUCTION 
Ownership of the Folk High Schools. — Kristen Kold 
owned his school in person. Whatever subscriptions he : 
received for the Ryslinge School were made outright as 
gifts to the cause. From that time on a large majority 
of the schools have been privately owned; or, in the 
few instances where this has not been the case, they be- 
long to a self-perpetuating corporation so organized that 
it cannot exploit the school for personal gain. The 
reader should be clear on this point, that the success of 
these schools has depended from their inception on the 
personality of their organizers. The term “ folk high 
school ” stands for a faculty of able, consecrated leaders 
rather than for huge piles of brick and mortar! Indeed, 
most of the schools rather pride themselves upon the 
simplicity of their buildings and equipment. Kold 
began his school with a capital of less than $2,000. 
Many of the schools have begun their work in rented 
quarters — often in rooms in some commodious farm- 
house. Later, if they proved successful, means for the 
construction of permanent quarters could readily be 
obtained.

One hundred and forty-five folk high schools and 
thirty-nine local agricultural schools were organized 
between 1844 and 1913, of which sixty-six folk high 
schools and sixteen agricultural schools were later closed 
down, leaving in all seventy-nine schools of the former 
kind and twenty-three of the latter. This table takes

schools only. A leading high school man emphasized

ease with which the schools can be ‘ snuffed out’ is the 
best guarantee the country has against the schools’ out- 
living their own usefulness.” It is interesting to notice 
how the most influential of the schools have been success- 
ful in training and inspiring an unbroken dynasty, as 
it were, of teachers and leaders who have a common 
purpose and continue the school’s once-for-always 
established policy. At Askov, for instance, Ludvig 
Schréder was succeeded by his son-in-law, Jacob Appel, 
who had for years been a leading faculty member. 
When the latter was called to become the Minister of 
Education, Mrs. Appel had all the training and inspira- 
tion necessary to step in and take her husband’s place. 
Likewise, at Vallekilde, the great Ernst Trier was suc- 
ceeded by his son-in-law, Poul Hansen, and at Lyngby, 
J. Rosendal has just taken his son, H. A. Rosendal, into 
the administration as joint principal with him, intending 
by degrees to release the reins of control. So it goes 
down the line of the other schools. 
The Teachers: Their Training. — A group of nearly 
six hundred men and women are required to do the work 
of the folk high schools. These teachers are bound by 
common bonds through Grundtvig’s philosophy. Their 
efforts are further harmonized at great periodical high 
school meetings held over the country, by special uni- 
versity courses for high school teachers, and the like.

of the principals and permanent teachers have thé best 
academic preparation possible. The rest are educated 
in the teachers’ seminaries and at the folk high schools 
themselves. While thorough academic and professional 
training is held in high esteem at the folk high schools 
these are by no means the only qualifications considered. 
As a matter of fact, they are not always even the first 
qualifications to be considered. Learned dullness holds 
no place in the schools. This is as much as to say that, 
first of all, the teacher must be seized by inspiration for 
his work and be capable of transmitting this inspiration 
to others. Some of the most successful high school 
teachers have come as students right up through the folk 
high school in which they later did their best work. The 
government leaves the question of teacher preparation 
entirely to the principal in charge, depending on its right 
of inspection to maintain standards of desired excellence. 
The Students who attend the Schools. — A study of 
Table XI gives some interesting figures. During the pe- 
riod 1844-1846, thirty-four men and six women attended 
the folk high schools, and thirty-six men the agricultural 
schools. By 1911-1912, sixty-nine hundred and thirty- 
six men and women were in attendance at the folk high 
schools, and sixteen hundred and fifty-nine men and 
women, at the agricultural schools. These figures leave 
out of consideration the twelve or more rural schools of 
household economics :

The total attendance for 1911-1912 was eighty-five 
hundred and ninety-five, a number which would almost 
reach 10,000 if the schools of household economics and 
1 These are regular students only. The large number of short course 
students are not considered. 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  220 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
certain non-recognized schools were counted. The 
agricultural schools comprise a little more than 19g per 
cent of the total attendance, and the women almost 
46.5 per cent of the folk high school attendance. 
The total number in attendance at any one time may 
seem small if compared with American school attendance ; 
but when considered on the basis of the total rural popu- 
lation of Denmark it proves surprisingly large. Indeed, 
333 per cent of the young men and a somewhat smaller 
number of young women spend some time, at least, at 
the folk high schools, and 44 per cent of these later 
attend the local agricultural schools. When one bears 
in mind that not quite all agricultural students attend 
the folk high schools as preparatory to the agricultural 
schools it will be seen that at least } of the young people 
frequent the agricultural schools in addition to the folk 
high schools. 
Table XII shows that the schools are open the year 
round, although the heaviest attendance is during the 
winter months (November—March) when the schools for 
men are all in session, and during the summer months 
(May-July) when the schools for women are in session. 
The attendance for the other months is drawn from cer- 
tain advanced continuation courses, requiring school 
residence throughout the entire year. 
A large majority of the students pursue the regular 
folk high school and agricultural school courses, as may

be seen from Table XIII. Some of the schools have 
special well-equipped’ departments for the training of 
artisans — such as masons, carpenters, cabinet makers, 
painters, and tinners. Two of the high schools, lying 
near the coast, used to offer courses for sailors and fisher- 
men of an inspirational rather than professional nature ; 
but these have recently been discontinued. Special 
departments are maintained for the training of teachers 
in physical education and gymnastics. Gymnastics is 
otherwise taught as a subject in all the regular courses. 
Subjects in household economics are offered in the regular 
courses. But no complete departments of this kind 
have been maintained since the establishment of separate 
rural schools of household economics, The number of

over the figures set forth in the above table. 
According to statistics for 1910-1911, only 6 per cent of 
the students in the two kinds of schools came from the 
towns or cities. This shows definitely that the folk high 
schools — as also the local agricultural schools — have 
become distinctively the schools of agricultural com- 
munities. The average for all the schools is about 
eighty-five students. However, the actual-attendance 
ranges from ten or more to about four hundred to a school. 
Many of the smallest schools do some of the very best 
work,
-P-A-G-E-257
    
ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 223 
Fifty-four per cent of all the students were (1910-11) 
children of substantial middle-class farmers (Gaard- 
mend); 20 per cent came from the smallholds (Hus- 
meend) ; 1o per cent were children of country artisans ; 
3 per cent of country laborers ; and the rest were variously 
distributed. Ten per cent of the students were country 
artisans by trade, and 38 per cent of all received state 
aid. 
Of the total number in attendance, 1 per cent of the 
students were below sixteen years of age at the time of 
matriculation; 6 per cent were between sixteen and 
eighteen years of age; 80 per cent were between eighteen 
and twenty-five years; and 13 per cent were above 
twenty-five years. Only +45 of the entire number had 
attended Realskoler or Latin schools. All the others 
had completed the work of the elementary school and 
had devoted their time to practical tasks until old enough 
to gain admittance to the folk high schools. 
State Aid to Schools and Students. — For reasons 
stated elsewhere, the schools are and, in Denmark at 
least, should continue to be private institutions.. But if 
they are to do their work well and reach the mass of the 
common people, they must be state aided financially. 
Almost from the first this has been the case. For a 
number of years the state aid was small and grudgingly 
given. But as the government came to realize the great 
value of the schools, and especially since the farmers 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
    224 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
themselves have come into control of the government, the 
annual appropriations to aid the schools and deserving 
students have increased rapidly. 
The aid takes the form (zx) of assisting in the direct 
maintenance of the schools, and (2) in helping students 
to meet school expenses. The amount of the former to 
any one school is regulated by the size of the budget of 
the particular school for the past fiscal year. The 
amount of the latter is determined by a number of cir- 
cumstances, although it must not exceed a specified 
amount monthly for any one individual. The policy 
at this time is to reduce the amount given immediately 
to the schools, and increase the amount of student aid. 
It should be understood that the amount allowed a 
student is paid directly into the school’s coffers and 
never to the beneficiary. 
Table XIV explains the amount of state aid that was 
given during the year 1910-1911, the monthly amount 
for each applicant, the total number of applicants, etc. 
The total amount distributed during the year, for 
student aid, was 233,805.78 kroner. The total number 
of applications for aid was forty-seven hundred and 
forty-seven, of which only twenty-seven hundred and 
five were accepted. Every such application must be 
made direct to the municipal board of the municipality 
where the applicant resides and is known. Only persons 
of unimpeachable character who do not have sufficient

It all amounts to this, that in Denmark every person 
who has an inclination to take advantage of these rural 
schools for grown-up people has the opportunity to do 
so; and this in spite of the fact that the schools are 
privately owned. 
The following figures show the recent growth in state 
subsidies to the schools and their pupils: 1908-1909, 
229,292 kroner; 1910-1911, 241,551 kroner; 1912-1913, 
Q
-P-A-G-E-260
  226 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
424,700 kroner; and 1913-1914, about 520,000 kroner. 
The “ Expanded ” Askov Folk High School has just been 
voted a special annual aid of 30,000 kroner out of which 
4,500 kroner is to be used for student aid. 
State recognition of the schools is regulated by law. 
In order to be placed on the accredited list the school 
must have been in successful operation at least two years, 
and for the two years must have enrolled no less than 
ten students for twelve months, or twenty students for 
six months, or forty for three months. None of these 
can be less than sixteen years of age; nor can more than 
25 per cent of the male students be from sixteen to eight- 
een years of age. Any other students of low age shall 
not be counted. 
Cost of Schooling. — One of the chief reasons for the 
substantial growth of the folk high school is the relatively 
low cost of the schooling. The amount charged for 
tuition, board, and lodging is determined from year to 
year by the Association of Folk High Schools and Agri- 
cultural Schools, which is binding upon all the schools 
holding membership in the Association. The charges for 
the current year (1913) are as follows: A winter course 
of five months for men, one hundred and seventy-five 
kroner for tuition, board, and lodging. The amount to 
be divided in this way: twenty-five kroner a month for 
board and lodging; for tuition, twenty kroner the first 
month, fifteen kroner the second month, ten the third,
-P-A-G-E-261
ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 227 
five the fourth, and nothing the last. For a summer 
course of three months for women the amount is: ninety- 
six kroner for tuition, board, and lodging ; and tuition for 
the three months, twenty, fifteen, and ten kroner respec- 
tively. To the above, ten kroner should beadded for books 
and other supplies, and two kroner for doctor’s fee. This 
makes the total amount paid for a five months’ winter 
course only one hundred and eighty-seven kroner or 
$50.50, and for a three months’ summer course one 
hundred and eight kroner or $29.19. 
Naturally these sums will not buy any luxuries; but 
the food is wholesome and plentiful. The dormitory 
rooms are exceedingly plain and are arranged for two, 
three, and four students in a room. The schools are 
now generally being equipped with central heating plants. 
In the older schools many of the dormitories are heated 
by stoves, or are even without heat of any kind. When 
the latter is the case, the students are expected to do 
their studying in large heated study rooms and reading 
rooms in the recitation hall. 
The School a Democratic Body. — The students of the 
folk high schools form a highly democratic body. A 
strong sense of responsibility and respect for the rights 
of others pervades the school atmosphere. The students 
are treated as members of the principal’s family. Indeed, 
the latter usually presides over the dining-room where 
teachers and students meet on common ground. All the

  ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 229 
when they are most impressionable. The “ inspirers ” 
know this period and turn it into an abundant seed 
time. The Germans call it the “sturm und drang ” 
period, which comes to all who stand on the threshold of 
mature manhood and womanhood. 
Denmark has been fortunate in producing an unfailing 
supply of teachers able to meet the heart cravings of the 
seekers after truth. They are themselves men who 
“ feel a fervor and zealous warmth for their vocation and 
possess a power to captivate the attention of their 
students.” 
As indicated repeatedly above, the lecture method of 
presenting the subject matter prevails. Though this is 
varied, without warning, with a give and take process of 
questions and answers somewhat like the maieutics used 
by Socrates of old. The element of interest plays a great 
réle in all this work. 
The teachers must have what has been called the 
“ historical-poetical faculty,” for the whole course of 
training is based on history. The pageantry of the past 
is portrayed in living colors for the purpose of illuminat- 
ing incidents in one’s own national history and life 
history. ‘‘ Here,” says Alfred Poulsen, ‘we find 
mentioned the relation of man and woman, parents and 
children, master and servant, religious, social, and politi- 
cal questions, which all agitate our own times. It is, if 
you like, a sort of unsystematical, practical life-philos-

-P-A-G-E-265
ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 231 
the high schools might safely go in the pursuit of the 
“ practical subjects.” Shall training for life pursuits 
be taken up by the high schools, or shall this be left en- 
tirely to professional schools? Many of the leading 
schoolmen insist that to introduce professional studies 
would mean the early decadence of real folk high school 
culture. Of the seventy-nine government accredited 
schools forty-eight adhere to the culture idea, pure and 
simple. And in this list are, perhaps, a majority of the 
schools which have done most to place a real stamp on 
the character of the nation. But thirty-one schools — 
among them some of the largest — offer specific courses 
in agriculture, horticulture, carpentry, masonry, and 
like subjects and seem in no danger of losing their 
original inspiration. 
Some Subjects of Particular Interest: Song. — The 
“songbirds ” in the hearts of the Danish peasantry are 
not dumb. Go into any home and they sing — not 
alone the long and sometimes doleful church hymns . 
but folk songs, ballads, and patriotic songs of every sort. 
The children all learn to sing in the elementary schools. 
No teacher, indeed, can secure a certificate to teach who 
is unable to lead the pupils in song. Music, song, and 
poetry play a great part in the folk high school’s work. 
Every lecture or recitation begins with song; every 
student sings. The average high school man is quite a 
poet in addition to being a music lover. Many of them 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
232 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
show the gift of spontaneous composition so common 
in the old Norse skjalds or minnesingers. 
The song collection in daily use comprises songs written 
by high school men from Grundtvig down to the present 
time. One can get a good idea of what the schools sing 
by glancing over the contents of the songbook edited by 
the Association of Folk High Schools and Agricultural 
Schools, which is almost universally used.

  Gymnastics and Play Life. — No phase of folk school 
activity appeals to the observer more strongly than does   its work in gymnastics. The students come to the 
schools from a variety of occupations, generally from 
outdoor, active life. But they are not permitted to 
become “stale,” as every day’s work includes at least
-P-A-G-E-267
  ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 233 
sixty minutes of gymnastics and very possibly twice that 
time. The earliest schools used a violent military system 
of drills formulated after the German army system. In 
the early 80’s Vallekilde abolished this and adopted in its 
place the more scientific Ling system from Sweden. 
Even the latter has become modified with time and 
improved. This new Danish-Swedish form of gymnas- 
tics can now be seen in all the schools. 
“Our work in gymnastics,” said one of the schoolmen 
in conversation, “has made sturdy, clear-eyed, keen- 
witted men out of the shuffling young farm louts who 
have come to the school; and it has taught our young 
women pride in strong, beautiful bodies, helping them to 
understand what it means to be created in God’s own 
image.” 
The effect of the work is far felt. The love of gymnas- 
tics and play is carried home by the high school students 
who have organized gymnastic associations in every 
country commune. This means much for a continued 
close social relationship. Song, gymnastics, and play 
make up the tripod of Danish rural recreative life. 
Where you find the one, the other two are sure to be. 
The excellence of Danish folk school gymnastics is 
now generally recognized on the continent. In IgIt, 
Jens Ovesen, who has charge of gymnastics at Ryslinge, 
brought a group of twenty-eight young gymnasts, most 
of them farm boys from Ryslinge School, to represent 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
234 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
  Denmark at the International Hygienic Congress, at 
Dresden. Exhibitions were also given at Berlin and 
other German cities, and everywhere the Danish farm 
lads were applauded for their skill and ability, getting the 
heartiest kind of praise from the continental press. In 
1912, Denmark picked its representatives to the Olympic 
games at Stockholm largely from the folk high schools. 
And last year, Niels Buch, an old Vallekilde student, 
had charge of twenty young men and sixteen young 
women who won high honors in the competitive drills 
held in connection with the Congrés International de 
l’Education Physique,‘at Paris. 
School Work that makes Thinkers of Men. — To 
make their students able to think and reason for them- 
selves has been the aim of the schoolmen. Encyclope- 
dism has been avoided, and the students generally return 
to their homes, with strong, reasoning minds, open to 
conviction, but just as ready to convince if on the right 
side of the argument. 
The writer, on one occasion, had gone through a 
strenuous day with the one hundred and sixty young 
men at Vallekilde and met with them again in the eve- 
ning for the last lecture of the day. The lecture happened 
to deal with the social economic development of Europe 
during the latter part of the eighteenth century, and 
seemed rather dry and technical. But this did not dis- 
courage these horny-handed sons of toil who proved to be 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
  ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 235 
surprisingly well at home with such personages as Adam 
Smith, Malthus, Carlyle, Voltaire, and Rousseau! At 
the close of the lecture the students broke up into smaller 
groups, continuing a discussion of the arguments pro- 
pounded by the lecturer in a manner to confound many 
a university senior of recent memory. 
Indeed, the superiority of the folk high school gradu- 
ates over students from mere technical agricultural 
schools is pretty sure to lie in the broader world horizon 
of the former and in the facility with which they have 
learned to reason from cause to effect — to think things 
through for themselves. 
Historical Study the Main Background. — The folk 
high school makes no use of formal methods in its 
instruction, partly because it does not concern itself 
with technical subjects, and partly because its students 
are grown people to whom it can address itself in a 
popular-philosophic manner. The school does not teach 
the classic languages at all. English and German are 
studied in some of the schools, because of the intimate 
commercial relationship between Denmark and _ these 
nations. They are taught with a view to immediate 
practical use only. Even the mother tongue is not pre- 
sented in such a way as to emphasize the grammatical 
machinery beyond the merest necessity. Mathematics as 
a systematic study holds a minor place. The require- 
ments are always limited to the practical application of  
-P-A-G-E-270
236 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
  arithmetical and geometrical calculation. Professor Poul 
la Cour has even gone so far as to create a method of his 
own for the presentation of mathematics and physics. 
He calls this the historical method. Under it mathe- 
matics and the natural sciences take on a new life as the 
lecturer unfolds them in their historical setting as his- 
torical growths. 
But history is, after all, the main lecture subject. 
And by this is meant history in the broadest sense of the 
word. It covers what is generally termed universal or 
general history, the history of civilization, and history of 
racial culture and literature. About two thirds of the 
time spent in the schools is devoted to these studies. 
Through the use of such material the folk high schools 
strive to give the mass of the people a broad culture, 
much the same as the regular academic schools seek to 
convey to their students through a larger number of 
subjects, covering a longer period of time. 
The main difference between the cultured person and 
the man of no culture is, no doubt, that the former feels 
himself in an organic touch with the higher cultural life 
and its development down through the times; while the 
latter — without knowing it — lives in a disconnected 
and mostly accidental relation to the culture and spiritual 
life that surrounds him. In most countries there exists 
a startling gap between the comparatively small circle 
that can lay claim to the higher culture and the mass of
-P-A-G-E-271
  ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 237 
the people who go through life without it. Here the 
Danish folk high schools have been great bridge builders, 
spanning the once existing deep gulf in the spiritual life of 
its masses. An able English schoolman who had made 
many trips to Denmark to study the schools, referring to 
this happy circumstance in an address at Askov, once 
said: “We Englishmen have much to learn from you 
here in Denmark. We have a glorious history; but it is 
foreign to the larger mass of the people. We need folk 
high schools to span the gap between the people and its 
history and poetry.” + 
Spiritual Growth and the Work of the Day. — How 
the thought life of the student gradually unfolds itself 
under the influence of the daily contact with the high 
school “ inspirers ” can be told in no better way than it 
has been done by an old Askov student, in a graphic 
little booklet called, “En Vinter paa Askov Héjskole af 
en Elev.”* A picture of the daily life at the school, as 
described by him, is therefore reproduced here in free 
translation : 
“At 7 o’clock in the morning, the school bell hanging 
before the main entrance is sounded. The school be- 
comes awake. Doors and windows are thrown open, 
and then students make their beds (There are, as a rule,

two in a room, for which each student furnishes his 
bedding from home), fetch water, brush, beat, sweep, 
and polish. By half past seven o’clock everything must 
be spick-and-span. The bell sounds for a second time 
and all students assemble for coffee in ‘ Dagmarsalen.’ 
One hears a clappering of wooden shoes and heavy boots. 
From the ‘white house,’ from the main building and from 
the dormitories the husky fellows come a-galloping and 
are soon seated at the long tables in the large dining- 
room.! After coffee there is morning devotion. It is a 
personal matter whether or not one takes part in this. 
Exercises open with a piano voluntary by Fru Ingeborg 
Appel, wife of the principal ; then follow song and prayer. 
“ The first class period of the day begins at 8 o’clock, 
in the large lecture room. The lecture is preceded by 
song. Song, song, and again song, might well be the folk 
high school motto! The songs are mainly from Grundt- 
vig, Richardt, and Bjérnsen, together with folk songs. 
The lecture program varies. from day to day. Either 
Dr. Marius Kristensen lectures on philology or Professor 
Poul la Cour gives a course in historical mathematics, 
or Professor Ludvig Schréder speaks on Norse mythol- 
ogy and the heroes of old. 
“ At the close of the lecture the young men rush out

  ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 239 
ina hurry. They must get to their rooms and dress for 
gymnastics, which begin at nine o’clock. The instructor 
gives the order, and the columns ‘ double quick ’ around 
the gymnasium several times to rouse the gymnasts to 
keen attention. Then they go through the ‘ setting-up 
exercises’ with great expedition. Thereupon they sepa- 
rate into smaller groups and are soon engaged in a large 
variety of exercises. Some go through contortions on the 
Swedish ladder; others are using the hand and arm 
beams; still others are exercising on the horse. Every 
man works with a vim and at the close of the period the 
perspiration stands out all over their well-knit bodies, 
The command to dismiss is given and the young fellows 
rush to the baths and the welcome showers, No sooner 
are they dressed than the bell calls to breakfast. 
“At 10: 30 o’clock all the students meet again in the 
large lecture hall. This time it is either Professor la 
Cour or Principal Appel who gives an interesting lecture : 
on some topic in natural science or Professor la Cour lec- 
tures on the historic method in mathematics or Professor 
Axelsen introduces a theme in modern history. When 
this period is ended the students scatter to various class- 
rooms to receive instruction in accounting, handwork, 
hygiene and sanitation, history and geography, up to 
2 o'clock. 
“Two o’clock is the dinner hour. The kitchen at 
Askov is not the least remarkable of the many interest-

ing places there. An exceptionally able housekeeper is 
required to make ends meet and to make it possible to 
serve four meals a day on the twenty-five kroner a month 
for board. The dinner is good and wholesome; there 
are always at least two courses, say, vegetable or fruit 
soup and roast beef, or a variety of Danish national 
dishes. The culinary department is at Askov, as at other 
folk high schools, under the particular supervision of the 
principal’s wife ; who, besides, at times takes considerable 
part in the practical instruction. After dinner, the class 
work is suspended until 3 : 25 o’clock. Such students as 
desire may meanwhile devote their time to outdoor 
sport; football, or, when the weather permits, some 
winter game or other. 
“ At 3: 25 o'clock, the beloved old Nutzhorn, one of the 
original founders of the school, appears with his baton 
under his arm. The students gather at the gymnasium, 
and soon the large hall is filled with a great volume of 
song from the hundreds of student voices. 
“From 4 to 5 o’clock instruction is given in Danish, 
German, and English for the young men, while the young 
women! take their gymnastic exercises under the com- 
mand of Fru Appel. 
“ At 6 o'clock all the students meet in the large lecture 
hall for the last lecture of the day, which again deals with 
history. Either Professor Fenger lectures on an epoch of

  ™ ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 241 
Danish history, or Principal Appel takes up a phase of 
other European history, as for example, of Prussia or 
England, or Professor Schréder deals with Grundtvig’s 
national philosophic thought or a theme of similar con- 
tent. Schréder is Askov’s real founder and is one of the 
high school leaders who has wielded the greatest influence. 
The methods used by him in presenting his subjects is, 
according to the testimony of many high school teachers, 
the acme of the highest and purest in the art of popular 
lecturing ; and whoever has been so fortunate as to have 
heard him will know the significance of the power of the 
‘living word.’ Self-control and deep sincerity character- 
ize his method. Remarkable for deep thought, he ex- 
presses himself in plain, straightforward terms which 
are as free from doctrinaire dullness as from oratorical 
pathos. Schroder is known to have said that he is often 
filled with diffidence and worry to have guests, especially 
from learned circles, tell him at the close of a lecture, 
that they found it ‘interesting.’ ‘If my lecture has 
only been entertaining,’ he would say, ‘then it has 
failed in so far as it was the purpose to impress my 
listeners with some responsibility which they should 
meet and take. There is another way of listening. It 
happens occasionally that one hears at the close of a 
lecture, a great inhalation of the breath! This is a sure 
indication that the inner man has felt the weight of the 
argument and has taken it to himself personally.’ ”

One will see from this glimpse of -daily life at Askov 
that a school spirit reigns there well worthy of com- 
parison with the best to be found in academic institutions 
of the highest rank. School life there is a cumulative 
growth, developing as the days go by, setting the indi- 
vidual free from the many trivialities which before bound 
him, furnishing him with an altruism which makes work 
for others and coéperation with one’s neighbors seem 
both right and easy.

General Statement. — It is difficult to convey to the 
reader all that the folk high schools are and do. The 
work is of the spirit more than of matter. It is felt and 
experienced rather than seen. Therefore, the glimpses 
of the journeyings to and fro among the schools by the 
writer and his friends, which are given in the following 
paragraphs, may not always convey as much to the mind 
as would be highly desirable in order to do the schools 
justice. 
There are now seventy-nine government-accredited 
folk high schools established throughout Denmark, 
besides a few that are striving towards recognition. To 
tell the story of all would be out of the question. Six 
schools only which are typical of all the schools have, 
therefore, been selected from this number. They: are 
Roskilde, Fredriksborg, Vallekilde and Haslev in Zealand, 
Ryslinge in Fiinen, and Askov in Jutland. 
A Day at Roskilde Folk High School. — Roskilde, the 
ancient capital of Denmark and burial place of its kings, 
is near the center of Zealand. The school lies two miles 
243
-P-A-G-E-278
  244 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
up the fjord from the town. A brisk walk over the excel- 
lent, well-rounded surfaced and ditched roads brought us 
to the school which is constructed of brick and stone in 
sixteenth century style. Several substantial teachers’ 
cottages flank the main approach. The principal and his 
family live in a wing of the main building, so as to be in 
the midst of the pupils, to direct and advise. We were 
well received by Principal Thomas Bredsdorf, who intro- 
duced us to his family and faculty, making us feel quite 
at home. 
One hundred and forty young men were in attendance 
—asturdy family. Sixty per cent of them Gaardmend’s 
sons (farmers of from fifteen to one hundred acres), 
25 per cent of them Husmend’s sons (farmers of one to 
fifteen acres), and the rest, sons of artisans and laborers 
from country and town. But here they were on an 
absolutely equal footing. 
A lecture period by the principal, which we attended, 
reflected the daily life and work of the school. The period 
began as every period does, with song. This was a 
rousing religious-patriotic song through which the youth 
pledges himself to God and fatherland. The particular 
lecture theme was, “ Grundtvig’s Influence on History, 
Poetry, and Song.” The high school “ inspirer” as he 
is at his best was seen in Mr. Bredsdorf, who so filled his 
listeners with enthusiasm that they hung on his every 
word,
-P-A-G-E-279
  TYPICAL FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 245 
We ate dinner with the students and faculty. The 
fare was exceedingly simple. But, then, the students in 
this particular school pay only twenty-two kroner per 
month for board and room, equivalent to about $5.95! 
The charge for tuition is twenty-three kroner for the 
first month, eighteen kroner for the second, thirteen for 
the third, eight for the fourth, and three for the fifth. 
The course of study had the usual broad historical 
basis. “History,” said Bredsdorf, “must be consid- 
ered as never ending. All play their réle in it. It is a 
living stream in which is the power and the destiny of 
the eternal. All must do their little mite in order that 
the stream can sweep on resistlessly as is its destiny.” 
Love of land and home and church fructify under this 
school influence. Somehow, while the sturdy farm youth 
are seated on the hard benches listening, the crust to 
their better selves gives way and the soul shines through 
— they become converts to the high school faith. Then 
and there, they become better Christians, better Danes, 
ready to put self-interest aside in order that God and 
native land may get what by right is felt to be theirs! 
During the afternoon intermission, groups of young 
men continued to discuss the more vital points raised in 
the morning lectures. Some of these concerned questions 
of such ethical and philosophical nature as the farm 
youth of most countries would seldom care to approach. 
The zeal of the students and instructors cannot be better
-P-A-G-E-280

demonstrated than in this, that one of the busy faculty 
members of Roskilde walked all the way to town with 
us in his eagerness to explain some of the great points in 
the school doctrines. He left us only when he had to 
hasten back to make his evening lecture, which strangely 
enough was to deal with “ Lincoln and the Emancipation 
of the Negro Slaves ”’! 
Fredriksborg Folk High School, the Inspirer of Eng- 
lish Schools. — This is one of the most renowned of the 
newer schools. It was founded by the well-known Askov 
instructor, Holger Begtrup, in 1895. As a high school 
leader Begtrup is known as few others, being a much 
sought leader in the extension courses out among rural 
communities. Up to 1902, he had delivered 2000 
lectures outside of the classroom. He is, moreover, 
ranked as an able historian, having recently completed 
his great work on ‘Denmark in the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury.” An ardent follower of the famous poet, J. C. 
Hostrup, who was also a great patron of the folk high 
schools, Begtrup became determined when the poet 
died in 1892, to raise up a school in Hostrup’s home com- 
munity as the most practical way to honor the memory 
of a man who in life gave the best he had for Denmark. 
Thus Fredriksborg Folkehéjskole came into being at 
Hilleréd in northeast Zealand. The name (originally 
intended as “‘ Hostrupsminde ”) is that of the renowned 
royal Fredriksborg castle on the edge of Hilleréd village, 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
TYPICAL FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 247 
  which naturally became fastened to the school. The 
institution and its grounds are very attractive. It com- 
prises a large, well-built main building, and several 
smaller structures together with teachers’ cottages and 
a school church. The latter is a “ free church ” — i.e. 
established by the school and community as a voluntary 
organization outside of the state church. These churches 
are found as members in most of the high school organiza- 
tions, and their origin is easily traced to the movement 
for freedom within the Church begun by Grundtvig in 
the early day. Twenty-five acres of land comprise the 
beautiful, well-planted campus, garden, park, and home 
farm on which latter vegetables and fruit are raised for 
school consumption. 
The winter school (November—March) at Fredriksborg 
is usually attended by from one hundred and twenty-five 
to one hundred and forty young men of sterling worth. 
The summer school (May-July) for young women is 
larger, often passing the two hundred mark. 
Principal Begtrup emphasized, for our particular 
benefit, the vast importance of the folk high school to 
Danish rural life. “Eighty per cent of the leaders in 
dairy work, and all the other codperative enterprises,” 
he stated, “‘ are high school men.” He further called 
attention to the extension course influence emanating 
from the schools. The kingdom has a veritable network 
of organizations at work holding meetings, lecturing on all
-P-A-G-E-282
248 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
  manner of inspirational and practical subjects. “ This 
work,” said Begtrup, “is done by high-school trained 
men. And more than this, our schools return all their 
students to the plow, happy and contented.” 
On the wall of the general lecture room at F redriksborg, 
back of the rostrum where all the listeners can see it, 
hangs a large painting by Viggo Petersen, which sym- 
bolizes well the work of the school. It is a Bible scene. 
Isaac stands in the open field before the tents as sunrise 
tints the landscape in wonderful color waiting to receive 
Rebecca, his betrothed, coming out of the North. 
The remarkable scene symbolizes the Danish peasantry 
waiting for the light of education, brought to them by 
that modern Eleezer, Grundtvig ! 
Fredriksborg offers interesting continuation courses 
for advanced students. These are organized into an 
association called, rather sententiously, the ‘‘ Window,” 
or “ The Window in the West’; the idea being that 
this class of advanced and mature students should be 
looking out from the windows of life with serious thought 
towards the ultimate purpose of being. 
Principal Begtrup gave an interesting lecture on Leo 
Tolstoy, which was followed closely, eagerly almost, 
by the one hundred and twenty-five young auditors. 
The speaker sparkled with wit and humor, giving besides, 
a lecture so historically deep and philosophically acute, 
that many university students would have been put to
-P-A-G-E-283
TYPICAL FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 249 
their best paces to follow it. One of the remarkable 
things about the folk schools is, that in the unusually 
short time of five months the students are enabled to 
get a really helpful outline on philosophy, history, and 
literature ; and, in addition, many practical things, much 
gymnastics and song. As to the latter, Holger Begtrup 
expressed it: “We have much song, Northern song; 
though perhaps not what some people would call ‘ fine 3 
song.” 
Fredriksborg holds the unique position of being the 
touching point between the Danish folk high schools and 
the schools of a similar nature now rooting themselves 
in English soil. The first school of this kind was opened 
at Bournville, near Birmingham, in 1909, by Tom Bryan, 
a scholarly gentleman, whose inspiration to establish - 
such a school came to him while he was listening to a 
lecture in one of the Danish schools. During the last 
few years a most interesting exchange of ideas has 
been going on between Fredriksborg and Fircroft, the 
Bournville school. Both teachers and students have 
been exchanged. A year ago a group of fifty English 
teachers visited Fredriksborg. The past two years an 
enthusiastic young Englishman by the name of Jonty 
Hanaghan has been at Fredriksborg preparing himself 
to do folk high school work in Yorkshire, while a young 
Englishwoman, his betrothed, is equipping herself for the 
same work at Vallekilde. During 1912, nearly one fourth 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  250 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
of the Fircroft students were Danes from the Fredriks- 
borg community. In this way the two countries are 
beginning to reach out to one another a helping hand to 
the end that — 
“ The toiler, bent 
Above his forge or plow, may gain 
A manilier spirit of content, 
And feel that life is wisest spent

Vallekilde, A Great Folk High School. — Immediately 
after the close of the disastrous German war of 1864, 
Ernst Trier, one of the three or four greatest schoolmen 
that Denmark has produced, laid the foundations of 
' Vallekilde, in northeast Zealand. He felt that now 
Denmark’s only hope lay in education. ‘“ The folk high 
schools,” he said, “ alone can lift the disheartened peo- 
ple.” 
Success came from the very first, because he was inspired He opened the school in rented quarters in 1865. 
for the great task. To-day, his son-in-law and successor, 
Poul Hansen, stands at the head of one of the most 
complete and influential schools in the country. 
Ninety acres of fine rolling land, laid out to ornamental 
gardens, parkings, experimental plots, and school farm, 
comprise the working area of the school. In this lies a 
regular village of buildings. This appears graphically 
from the accompanying drawing. The most important

of the structures are a large, fire-proof central school 
building with dormitory capacity for two hundred, .a 
good, carefully equipped gymnasium, a building for 
manual training, and another for art work. There are 
cottages for all the married teachers, a school church, 
and an elementary school for the children of the faculty. 
The school farm has some remarkable buildings that 
deserve at least a passing notice. The entire plant, by 
the way, including cowbarns, stables, and hoghouses, is 
lighted by electricity generated by means of wind power. 
The enormous windmill was the first of its kind erected 
by the famous Askov teacher-scientist, Poul la Cour. 
The mill is fitted with storage batteries of sufficient size 
to supply current for a week at a time in case of still 
weather. 
In the fine sanitary cowbarns, thirty thoroughbred red 
Fiinen cows are kept installed. As an illustration of 
careful economy in everything agricultural, all liquid 
manure from these barns is made to pass by cement 
gutters to outside cisterns, whence it is forced by electric 
power to the meadows and plowed ground, and carefully 
sprinkled over the soil. The school butchers its own 
pork and beef. But the cream all goes to the codperative 
creamery in the vicinity, and the butter is actually 
“bought back”? by the school. There is also a large 
school bakery on the campus, and a well-equipped 
hospital with separate building for contagious diseases.

Vallekilde has from one hundred and sixty to one hun- 
dred and eighty young men in attendance during the win- 
ter months and two hundred young women during the 
summer time. The young men are divided into distinct 
groups as “ agriculturists ” and “ industrialists.” The 
former prepare, as the name would indicate, for soil 
tilling pure and simple; and the latter are to become 
farm artisans of various kinds. It is interesting to 
note that Vallekilde, which has retained the early high 
school philosophy in all its purity, is able to combine 
with this a large degree of the practical without losing 
any of the cultural values. To be sure, the entire in- 
dustrial group must attend all the general lectures and 
live in the same “‘ atmosphere ”’ as the other students. 
And, the industrial work is chiefly theory, after all. 
Such subjects as these are taught: the history of archi- 
tecture, building’ construction, drawing, — freehand, 
mechanical, machine, — painting (practical work), cal- 
culation, bookkeeping, and penmanship. The agricul- 
tural group makes some approach. to the practical 
through occasional lectures in agriculture and horti- 
culture, drawing and actual field work in surveying and 
leveling. 
Vallekilde is strong in gymnastics and play life and 
song. The young women of the summer school are 
offered exceptional opportunities for the study of hand- 
work, music, and the fine arts. But these studies 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  254 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
are considered as incidental merely to the culture lec- 
tures. 
It was the writer’s pleasure to be permitted to spend 
a night at ‘‘ Hytten,” or the lodge, the most interesting 
of all the buildings on the campus. ‘“ Hytten ” is held 
sacred in the memory of all Vallekilde students. 
There is scarcely a student but has been made a better 
man or woman for having come within its benign 
influence. 
.§ The story is this: Ingeborg Trier, a daughter of 
Ernst Trier, was born into the Vallekilde high school 
world in the late sixties, a true daughter of a great 
father. All her life she gave to the cause of the men 
and women who toil close to the soil. As a young girl 
she led the other girls in their games and gymnastics. 
She was the woman who later taught the girls gym- 
nastics in such a way that they learned the significance 
of being created in God’s own image. Then she married 
Niels Hansen, brother of Principal Poul Hansen, who 
is farm manager at Vallekilde. She was brought as a 
bride to “ Hytten,” and there she remained to the 
day of her death, a mother to the whole school. When

the work of the classroom. Here they sang and played 
their games. But more: here came the young woman 
to confide her heartaches to the mistress of the house, 
usually to go away again with the balm of Gilead in 
her heart; here came, too, the young man who sought 
soul rest, and the wild young fellow who had gone 
wrong, and Ingeborg Trier Hansen had words of wis- 
dom for them all. No wonder that thousands look 
towards “ Hytten ” with benedictions in their hearts. 
This bit of sentiment is given a place here because 
it comes pretty near disclosing the secret to the success 
of the high school men and women. The folk high 
school life at its best is a communion of man to man, 
the work of emancipated leaders consecrated to the 
work of freeing others. 
Haslev, a Folk High School of the Practical Kind. — 
This school is one of a group of six schools founded 
by the “Inner Mission Church ” — an independent 
church body. To be exact, the school is owned by an 
association of church members which seeks to reach 
primarily its own membership, though all students are 
made welcome. The “ patriotic-spiritual” life which 
stamps the regular Grundtvigian schools is possibly 
not so marked at Haslev. On the other hand — being 
a church institution — religious subjects are actually 
taught as part of the course of study. 
The school lies on the edge of Haslev, a small town 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  256 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
in south-central Zealand. The buildings are set in a 
tract of seventy-five acres, fifteen acres of which are 
devoted to campus, parking, experiment, plot, and 
garden. The rest of the land is farmed, and supplies 
milk, meat, and vegetables for the school. Three good- 
sized buildings are used immediately for teaching pur- 
poses, besides ample barns, stables, and so on. There 
is dormitory capacity for two hundred and ten persons. 
Electricity is freely applied in this school from peel- 
ing potatoes in the school kitchen to running the 
threshing machine at the school barns. 
The study courses here aim to reach two classes 
particularly: (1) those who are to till the soil; and 
(2) those who are to live as artisans in the country. It 
is interesting to see how the school seeks to train the 
actual soil-tillers and the country artisans as well, 
thereby keeping alive in the country a twofold civili- 
zation. 
The first mentioned of the two classes is really what 
the other schools would designate the regular cultural 
group, though here at Haslev it becomes the farm 
group. It gets less of the inspirational work offered 
by the former schools, but more of religious lectures 
and practical agricultural work. Forty-five hour 
periods are devoted to class work each week by the 
young men in the winter school, as appears from the 
following enumeration :

The seven hours devoted to agriculture and horti- 
culture include the history of agriculture, practical 
work in planning the farm, platting and planting gardens, 
and field work in surveying and leveling, pruning of 
fruit trees, and like work. 
The summer course for young women is quite similar 
to the course described above, with this exception, 
that six hours of handwork (plain sewing, embroidery, 
knitting, and dressmaking) is substituted for the agri- 
culture. It is well to add here that the summer schools 
for women in all the folk high schools require much 
handwork — in few less than one hour daily.

The artisan group at Haslev is subdivided into 
smaller groups or classes, as carpenters, brick and 
stone masons, smiths, machinists, painters, tinners, 
and wheelwrights. The courses of study for carpenters 
and masons serve to illustrate the kind of work required 
from the entire group. 
The courses cover three winters of five months each, 
and are intended especially to answer the needs of 
country artisans who work during the summer months. 
The first year is devoted more particularly to theory 
—ie. geometrical drawing, projection, algebra, and 
geometry. The second year class emphasizes building 
construction. By the close of this year the students 
are able to draw plans and specifications of fair size 
farm buildings. By the close of the third year they 
make their own drawings and calculate the size of 
timbers, iron supports, and similar materials with great 
accuracy. Much practical work is done on the premises, 
although most of the work is devoted to miniature 
buildings and models.

Haslev is proud of the fact that it is sending out 
annually scores of practically trained artisans who not 
only know their profession, but who are also equipped 
with the additional advantages of having spanned the 
gap between the deadening work-a-day in life and the 
higher culture life which of right should be the common 
heritage of all. 
Ryslinge in Fiinen. A Historic School. — Ryslinge, 
which is a small country village in south-central Fiinen, 
beautifully situated in a prosperous agricultural com- 
munity, holds high place in folk school history. It was 
early brought into notice because here Kristen Kold 
opened his first school in 1851. But the community 
has been prominent in many other ways. The free 
church movement began here in the early day. The 
first “ Valgmenighed,” or free choice congregation, was 
founded here — i.e. a congregation in which the member- 
ship is free to choose its own pastor instead of being 
obliged to accept one appointed by the State. Here, 
too, were organized the first “skytteforeninger”” or 
associations of sharpshooters, which built at Ryslinge 
the first of the rural assembly halls now found in every 
country commune. Nowhere have the gymnastic or- 
ganizations prospered more than here. 
Ryslinge Folk High School can scarcely be considered 
a continuation of Kold’s school, though it has taken to 
itself all the spirit and all the traditions of this school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  260 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
As it now stands, Ryslinge owes its origin to former 
Army Chaplain Johannes Clausen, who began his school 
activities here in 1866. He was pastor of the local 
church and really intended his school for an “ Inner 
Mission ” institution. But he brought several teachers 
—his intimate friends— into the school, who had 
strong Grundtvigian tendencies. This indiscretion prob- 
ably cost the principal his position; but it gradually 
gave the school new coloring, so that to-day it stands 
for the purest of Grundtvig’s philosophy. 
In 1884, a new era began at Ryslinge when Alfred 
Poulsen was chosen principal. He came from Lyngby 
Agricultural School; where he had been in charge of 
the folk high school department. Poulsen is one of 
the biggest schoolmen in the active charge of the schools 
at the present time. The most lucid delineation of the 
folk high schools ever penned in English is from his 
hand. He is also the President of the Association of 
Folk High Schools and Agricultural Schools, an organi- 
zation which has been of vast importance in unifying 
the work of the schools, and in getting for them the 
necessary state recognition and aid. 
Professor Poulsen is one of the most ardent advo- 
cates of the policy to keep the folk high schools as free 
as possible from textbooks and classroom practices. 
“Tt is a great mistake,” he says, “ and contrary to the 
high school philosophy, to combine this school with

  agricultural schools, or with other departments requir- 
ing much study. The right spiritual uplift of the man 
and opening of the soul demands, first of all, peace and 
quiet. Where there is much book activity there can 
be little time for meditation and the living word be- 
comes powerless.” His fear is that many practical 
subjects strongly emphasized will force the real spirit 
of the folk schools into the background — ultimately 
to get only such time for lectures as cannot be used for 
“ practical”? purposes. A majority of the schoolmen 
seem to share these views. 
Ryslinge is remarkably well built and attractive. Its 
attendance is limited to two hundred young men in 
winter and two hundred young women in summer. 
Months before a term opens the matriculation sheets 
are closed, and the students are refused for want of room. 
The fact that such schools deliberately limit themselves 
to a comparatively small number of students should 
convey a hint to schools where big numbers too often 
play the master réle. 
It is unnecessary to take the time here for a review of 
the work seen at Ryslinge. In organization of courses, 
in daily life, and in other ways it resembles Vallekilde 
very much, so that to tell the story of one school is to 
give that of the other. Our sojourn there was delightful 
and instructive, although cut short because of the prin- 
cipal’s forced absence from home.

  Askov “Expanded” Folk High School. — When 
Slesvig became German territory Rédding Folk High 
School was transplanted, it will be recalled, root and 
branch, to loyal soil, north of Kongeaaen (King’s River), 
which marks the new boundary. Vejen is an unimpor- 
tant country village on the railroad between Kolding and 
Esbjerg, and the topography of the country is, on the 
whole, monotonous and uninteresting. In spite of all 
this, no spot in Denmark has greater historic memories, 
nowhere is the patriotic life and the folk life more keenly 
alive than here on the frontier. Askov Folk High School, 
the greatest of all the folk high schools, lies in the midst 
of this community, a short half hour’s walk south from 
Vejen, right in sight of the German frontier — and this is 
reason enough. Had Denmark built strong, frowning 
earthworks along the boundary they could not have been 
the national defense that it now has in the work of this 
school! North of the line the people have become 
welded in clear-sighted, far-seeing nationality, and south 
of it Danish spirit and Danish language are kept alive 
whether to German liking or not. It is a significant 
fact that a large number of young people from the 
German side of the boundary may be seen not only at 
Askov, but at the other schools in the peninsula and over 
on the islands. 
Askov is a direct continuation of the first school 
established in Denmark, and has retained all the old
-P-A-G-E-303
TYPICAL FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 263 
traditions. Above the portal of the oldest of its many 
school buildings may yet be seen the inscription: “ Flors 
H6jskole,” in remembrance of Dr. Christian Flor, the 
early champion of Rédding. Ludvig Schréder brought 
the school across the boundary and directed its work up 
to the time of his death in 1908. During these years 
remarkable progress has been made. The school was 
at first conducted as an ordinary folk high school; but 
in 1878 it was reorganized as the “ Expanded ” Askov. 
Prominent high school leaders had ever since Grundt- 
vig’s time kept alive the hope that Soré Academy would 
eventually be converted into a great central high school 
with continuation courses for students from the other 
schools. But all hope finally failed, and by common con- 
sent Askov waschoseninstead. Indeed, such men as Ernst 
Trier of Vallekilde and J. Fink, an old Ryslinge leader, 
and their supporters were among the first to point to 
Askov as the logical place for such a school. “ Danish 
High School Association ” was organized to look after 
the financial side of the problem, with such marked 
success that the reorganized school could begin its work 
as early as November, 1878. 
At the present time the following courses are offered : 
An advanced course for men, covering two winter sessions 
of six months each; an advanced course for young 
women, also covering two winter sessions of six months 
each; and a regular summer course for young women. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  264 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
In the advanced courses the men and women attend 
‘the lectures in common; although in most of their other 
work they have separate classrooms. The men alone 
reside at the school dormitories during the winter ses- 
sions. The women students find accommodation in the 
small village that is springing up around the school 
grounds. ' 
Some two hundred and sixty men and women — the 
pick of the advanced folk high school students — were 
in attendance at the time of our visit. Many of these 
had completed the regular courses in the other folk high 
schools; some were here from the agricultural schools ; 
some from teachers’ seminaries and from the “ learned ” 
schools; and still others had come from the National 
Polytechnic Institute and the National University. 
This enthusiastic throng was here preparatory to going 
out into the other folk high schools as teachers and 
inspirers. 
The summer courses at Askov differ but little from the 
summer work in the other schools. Even the first year 
of the advanced course is practically the same as offered 
elsewhere. The difference lies in the second year’s 
work. Throughout, there is more actual book study, 
methods, and laboratory work. The natural and social 
sciences, especially, receive much attention. 
The following daily programs will give a good idea of 
school work at Askov:

Askov has had associated with it the names of such 
great men as Poul la Cour, Svend Hégsbro, and others. 
La Cour is known to the world for utilizing wind power 
to generate electric current. The mill-at Askov is built 
above a very interesting electrical laboratory, off in a 
grove of trees by itself. The mill furnishes current 
to light the entire school, a score or more buildings, 
besides supplying all the electricity required for experi- 
mental purposes. The laboratory was primarily in- 
tended for advanced research work only; but, of late, 
two weeks’ courses have been added for farmers and 
their hired men and dairy employees, who are all obliged 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  268 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
to understand the general principles of electricity, since 
this is coming more and more into use for lighting the 
farmsteads and running the dairies. 
October 6 to 14, 1874, marked the beginning, in Den- 
mark, of a most remarkable system of extension work. 
At that time some seventy or eighty young and old 
people met at Askov and “lived ” for more than a week 
in an atmosphere charged with religious fervor, patriotic 
zeal, and eager desire to help one’s fellow men. This 
was the beginning of a series of annual meetings which 
grew in importance with time. Each autumn larger 
throngs of the peasantry and town folk flocked to the 
school. 
This movement was not limited to Askov alone. Ina 
short time other folk high schools and agricultural schools 
had taken it up and the two weeks’ autumn meetings 
were being held all over the land. School buildings 
proved too small to hold the throngs, and groves of 
trees near by were used instead. Some schools have their 
natural woods, while others have been obliged to make 
plantations for this purpose. ; 
Askov has a historic grove for its great meetings, 
which, by the way, are no longer limited to the autumn 
time, but are held during spring and summer as well. 
This is “ Skibelund Krat,” a small forest of gnarled oaks 
and other trees, a few minutes’ walk south of the school, 
overlooking the German frontier. This spot has been
-P-A-G-E-309
TYPICAL FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 269 
sacred ground for many years. Here the peasantry 
met to celebrate the signing of the liberal constitution 
of 1849; and here have the Danes south of the border 
met with their brothers annually since the war to renew 
their vows of steadfastness to a lost cause. Since the 
coming of Askov, Skibelund has become a veritable

  Mecca for the high school folk. All kinds of popular 
meetings are held here. At or near the natural amphi- 
theater where the speaking is held are busts and monu-
-P-A-G-E-310
  270 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
ments of folk leaders who have given their lives for a 
happier Denmark. Among the others can be seen a 
great memorial to Principal Ludvig Schréder and his 
wife, who died some six years ago. Perhaps the most 
striking thing at Skibelund is “‘ Modersmaalet,” a group 
monument in the center of which stands a woman of 
heroic size, gazing southward — ‘The spirit of the 
Mother tongue ” — blessing her divided children. 
The themes discussed at these gatherings cover a wide 
range of knowledge. At first they were limited by the 
folk high school traditions to the “ inspirational ” 
lectures in history, literature, mythology, and like 
subjects. But with time the field has broadened until 
now every phase of ethics, politics, agriculture, sociology, 
and the like are freely discussed. This extension work is 
quite similar to the American Chautauqua, barring the 
money admission, as these meetings are entirely free. 
It might be added here that many men who had gained 
their inspiration at the high school meetings later organ- 
ized their home community and continued the great work 
at the community hall and gymnasium, one of which 
may be found in every rural district. In the towns and 
cities the friends of the new education built Héjskolehjem 
or High School Homes, institutions combining many 
of the features of a modern Y. M. C. A. with the conven- 
ience of a first-class hotel. Even Copenhagen has such 
an institution, called Grundivig’s Hus (Grundtvig’s
-P-A-G-E-311
TYPICAL FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 271, 
aj\> 
House). Aside from offering the facilities of first-class 
hostelries, managed in a truly Christian spirit, these 
homes are the rallying centers in town and city for the 
new extension work. Each has its library and reading 
rooms, and holds weekly meetings fashioned after the 
great outdoor meetings. It is estimated that in this 
way a wholesome and helpful education is brought to 
the very threshold of every farmer and villager in the 
kingdom. 
The state has lent marked assistance to the extension 
movement by encouraging perambulating courses in 
agriculture and household economics, setting aside for 
this work annually large sums to pay teachers and 
lecturers. To this should be added that the Government 
maintains a national service of “ control assistants” — 
science specialists — whose services as speakers and agri- 
cultural organizers may be had for the asking.

CHAPTER XVI 
THEIR TRANSPLANTATION TO OTHER NorTH EuROPEAN 
CouNTRIES 
  The Adaptability of the Folk High Schools. — The 
question naturally arises, could such institutions as the 
Danish folk high schools be adapted to the needs of other 
countries? They were born of peculiar national needs. 
Can they live and do their work on other than Danish 
soil? The answer is that the schools have been quite 
adaptable to changed conditions and needs. They have 
done as well, in fact, outside of Denmark as at home. 
It is true that the transplantation has so far been limited 
to North European nations of kindred origin with the 
Danish. But there seems little doubt that Grundtvig’s 
system, especially in its more recent practical applica- 
tion, could find a ready field for usefulness even as far 
from the land of its origin as the United States. Indeed, 
Danish emigrants have already made a beginning at 
transplanting them to American soil. 
The folk high schools were carried to the mountain 
regions of Norway in 1864 where they have flourished, 
considering the much adverse legislation. In 1868, 
they were transplanted to Swedish soil where forty-four 
272
-P-A-G-E-313
  THEIR TRANSPLANTATION 273 
strong schools, somewhat modified, are now wielding a 
remarkable influence in farm communities. Finland 
has found the folk high schools a national bulwark against 
Russian aggression, since forty-three such schools are 
now keeping alive the sturdy Finnish folklore. Even 
Iceland and the Faroes have each one high school. The 
next step was the successful transplantation to England. 
The first school of the kind for English-speaking people 
began its activities at Bournville, near Birmingham, in 
1909, under the name of Fircroft School. Its appeal 
has been especially to the artisan class with which it is 
doing a good work. A second school is just being opened 
in Yorkshire, which will be watched with much interest 
by friends of the movement. 
The Folk School in Sweden. — The school came to 
Sweden as a protest against a deadening materialism 
and indifference for fatherland and nationality that had 
long prevailed. “ The peasantry,” according to Swedish 
thinkers of fifty years ago, “ were devoted solely to their 
swine, their calves, and brandy stills, and the chief 
qualification for election to the Riksdag was a promise to 
see to the reduction of taxes. The great social questions 
of the future were left to shift for themselves.” 
Then rose up Dr. August Sohlman (1824-1874), editor 
of the Swedish “ Aftonbladet,” as an advocate of “a new 
kind of school free to all the people —a school which 
might also become a means to reform the existing narrow
-P-A-G-E-314
  274 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
humanistic schools and lead to a national folk culture.” 
He was seconded in his effort by many leading men of the 
day. Ultimately the ‘“Nordiske Nationalforening”’ of- 
fered its support to the new cause with the result that 
the first Swedish folk high school was founded at Her- 
restad in East Gothland, November 1, 1868. The very 
same day another school was opened at Onnestad in 
Skaane, and one day later Hvilan Folk High School, 
near Akarp in southwest Sweden, threw open _ its 
doors. 
This beginning marked a renaissance in Swedish 
agricultural life. The school has caused the same 
“ breaking through of sleeping souls” here as in Den- 
mark. The spirit of confidence in one’s neighbors is 
just as marked also. Codperative enterprises are cluster- 
ing wherever the folk high schools thrive. In Sweden, 
the schools early emphasized more of the purely practical, 
laying more stress on textbook study. And in a few 
instances examinations were introduced, though generally 
to be discontinued later. The chief Swedish modifica- 
tion of the Danish system lies in the addition of fully 
equipped agricultural departments to most of the schools. 
In this respect, at least, the Swedish policy is at variance 
with the tenets of a majority of Danish high school men. 
Since 1882 — when the Swedish government began offer- 
ing liberal support for the establishment of agricultural 
1 Schréder, “Folkehéjskolen i Sverige,” p. 398.
-P-A-G-E-315
  THEIR TRANSPLANTATION 275 
schools — the folk high schools have gone through a 
partial reorganization. Two schools are now usually 
found on the same campus, under one administrative 
head, although the schools continue to have separate 
principals and are housed in their own buildings. Their 
relation is much the same as is that of the several schools 
in an American university — each with its own dean 
subject to a common administrative head. The schools 
at Lyngby and a few other places in Denmark have a 
similar organization. 
Sweden has forty-four government-recognized folk 
high schools, with eleven hundred men and ten hundred 
and eighty women students. The state appropriation 
for aid to the schools — privately owned as in Denmark 
—in 1912-1913, was 339,200 kroner, and stipends for 
needy students, 80,000 kroner. 
Hvilan Folkhégskolan och Lantmannaskolan. — It is 
unnecessary to describe in detail the Swedish schools. 
In administration, methods of instruction, and subject 
matter, they follow closely their Danish prototypes. 
The ane marked difference has been noted above: the 
Swedes prefer to bring under one administration all

tinct institutions. In all probability, any adaptation 
that might be made of these schools in the United 
States would likely resemble the Swedish plan more than 
the Danish, since our conditions will hardly permit of

schools depending solely on the inspirational elements to 
attract a student body. i 
Hvilan Folk High School and Agricultural School may 
be taken as typical of the Swedish schools. The four 
distinct Danish schools — folk high school, agricultural 
school, smallhold school, and school of household eco- 
nomics — are all represented at Hvilan by very good 
courses. This is not to say that the opportunities offered 
here are just as good in every respect as in the separate 
Danish schools. Such a condition could not be expected. 
But the fact remains that very satisfactory work is 
being done, and that is the only consideration. 
The courses and number of students in each course 
for the year 1911-1912 were as follows:

  Origin of the Norwegian Folk High Schools. — In Our 
Redeemer’s Churchyard at Christiania stands a simple 
gravestone bearing an inscription that may be translated 
thus :
-P-A-G-E-317
THEIR TRANSPLANTATION 
“So awaken the folk one morning tide 
With life in heart and light in mouth, 
And sweetly it sings 
With loosened tongues 
What life’s about.” 
  Beneath the stone sleeps Ole Vig, the Norwegian teacher 
and writer who first brought Grundtvig’s spirit to Nor- 
way. With him came a great awakening to his people. 
Now V. A. Wexel roused the Church to a greater spiritu- 
ality; Ivar Aasen strove to purify the mother tongue ; 
P. A. Munch and others wrote in fiery words the history of 
Norway ; Asbjérnsen and Moe published their marvelous 
collections of folk tales; Lindemann set the mountains 
a-echoing with his folk-melodies; and Ole Bull played 
for all the world. This was in the decade 1850-1860. 
Like Grundtvig, Ole Vig was only the prophet ; others 
were to carry to execution his plan for a system of 
Norwegian folk high schools. 
Two young university students, Herman Anker and 
Olaus Arvesen, were won for the high school cause by 
Vig’s zeal. They both went to Denmark and lived the 
folk school life for a season. When they returned home 
they took steps to open a school jointly, Anker, who was 
a man of wealth, to furnish the means, and Arvesen to 
devote all his time to the work. 
In this way Sagatun Folk High School, beautifully 
situated on the shore of Lake Mjésen, was organized,
-P-A-G-E-318
| 
278 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
  and opened its doors to the public in October, 1864. 
Eighty young people were in attendance the first year 
and the folk school idea took root, never to lose its 
hold. 
In 1867, the great schoolman, Christoffer Bruun, 
founded the renowned Vanheim Folk High School. 
This was followed by Seljord and nearly a score of others. 
But these schools have all had their difficulties to meet. 
Some own their own buildings; others have been obliged 
to get along with rented quarters; and a few are really 
perambulating, going from mountain district to mountain 
district, opening their doors for a few weeks or months 
at a time at some large farmstead. Yet, in the midst of 
all these difficulties, the spirit of the schools has not 
lagged, the song has continued to stir their souls to 
noble action. 
Two serious difficulties have hampered the work of the   
      
folk schools in Norway: (z) each amt or local adminis- 
tration unit had its own continuation school above the 
free elementary school, intended to give the country 
population a liberal education. But, unfortunately, as it 
appears from an investigation, “The amt schools have 
proved the cause of drawing many farm boys away 
from the soil and into other callings, instead of preparing 
them to live the country life as enlightened and interested 
citizens, with a keen sense for the life and customs of 
their forefathers.”” The amt schools were inclined to
-P-A-G-E-319
  THEIR TRANSPLANTATION 279 
be aristocratic and narrowly scholastic, becoming really 
nothing more than preparatory schools for the higher 
learned institutions. Naturally these schools were not 
inclined to share the field with the privately owned folk 
high schools. (2) The folk high schools at first had to 
depend solely on private open-handedness for mainte- 
nance, as the state was disinclined to lend aid. 
More recently these difficulties have been surmounted. 
The folk spirit has, down through the years, permeated 
the whole people, reaching even the official classes. 
State aid has been extended to all worthy folk high schools. 
The amt schools, too, have become somewhat modified 
in their organization, making it possible for the schools 
to work in greater harmony than in the past. 
Norway is a great mountain ridge cut by deep ocean 
fjords into innumerable mountain districts, each 
with its own manners and customs, and even dialect. 
The folk high schools have invaded these fastnesses 
and rallied the mountain folk around them. The great 
nationalizing movement in Norway of recent years 
which has culminated in the adoption of a purified na- 
tional tongue, a national music, a revival of national 
dress, folk dances, and the like, can be traced in large 
measure to the subtile influence of the folk high schools. 
The Folk High Schools in Finland. — Here Elias 
Lénnrot, well known for his compilation of Finnish folk 
songs, the Kalevala; Johan Ludvig Runeberg, the poet;
-P-A-G-E-320
  280 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
and Uno Cygneus, the father of the sloyd system — 
all had something to do with preparing the people for 
the coming of the folk high schools. 
The first school was organized by a woman, Sofia 
Hagman, at Kongasala near Tammerfors, in 1889. 
She rallied around her the young women of the com- 
munity, giving them from eighteen to twenty hours of 
instruction weekly. Handwork for women was the 
most important part of her course. Besides this, there 
were classes in religious study, accounting, drawing, 
song, and gymnastics, and lectures on the history of the 
world, church history, geography, and so on. 
This school was soon followed by Borgaé Folk High 
School, which was largely inspired by the poet Runeberg. 
The first folk school in Finland to use the Swedish tongue 
‘ was opened at Kronoby in East Bothnia, in 1891. This 
resembles in almost every respect the Danish and Swedish 
schools. 
In 1905, Finland could boast twenty-three folk high 
schools, of which seven used the Swedish language. 
Now they have grown in number to forty-two, of which 
fifteen are Swedish-speaking. Prior to 1905, the Finnish 
government was very conservative in its support of the 
schools. Then, by degrees, the government’s policy 
changed. At this time it encourages the schools to the 
best work through liberal state aid. This now amounts 
to more than 300,000 marks annually.

  The Folk High Schools on English Soil. — One day 
back in 1905, a party of English educators and other 
gentlemen on a tour of inspection in Denmark were 
spending the week-end as the guests of Principal Poul 
Hansen at Vallekilde Folk High School. While here, 
they listened to an instructive address, among other 
things, on the purpose of the folk high school by Pro- 
fessor Valdemar Bennike. One of the English party was 
J. S. Thornton, who has written much on the Danish 
school system for the press and educational periodicals. 
He describes the scene of the address in the following 
language: ‘“ As he (Bennike) spoke he stood in front of 
the Ansgar picture (it was Ansgar who first brought 
Christianity to Denmark), thus emphasizing all he had 
to say by showing that the teaching of himself and his 
colleagues, whilst looking eagerly forward to the future, 
was nevertheless rooted in the past and based on a 
Christian foundation. . . . 
“¢The main object of this school,’ said Bennike, 
‘is not to impart to our students a mass of useful in- 
formation — that is only a secondary aim. The princi- 
pal aim is to impart to them a spiritual view of life, so 
that they may see there is some sense in their existence.’ 
The last words were scarcely from the speaker’s mouth, 
when I heard an involuntary chuckle from the neighbor 
at my right, telling me that the phrase had gone home. 
The seed had fallen into good ground; for, some three
-P-A-G-E-322
  282 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
years after, the gentleman in question— Mr. Tom 
Bryan — had become the head of the First People’s 
High School in England that could fairly be said to 
resemble the Danish original.” + 
The school here referred to is Fircroft, at Bournville 
near Birmingham. It would be unfair to say that it is, 
root and branch, a transplantation from the Danish 
mother tree. To say that it is a Danish graft on an 
English stock comes much nearer being the truth. 
For it is really a continuation of the so-called Quaker 
Adult School which used to meet at Bournville Sunday 
morning for a serious study of the history and literature 
of the Bible. With such preparation it was not difficult 
for the folk high school to strike root. 
A little booklet issued by the school has this to say 
about the genesis of the school: ‘“ The founding of Fir- 
croft College in January, 1909, was the outcome of 
serious thought on the part of a few people keenly 
interested in the education of working men. 
“ A study of existing educational facilities impressed 
them with the disabilities under which the workers 
labored, and the strong necessity of attempting to 
lessen these disabilities if, in case of the workers, educa- 
tion was to yield its best results. 
“Tt was felt among other things that the invaluable : 
work of the Adult Schools, the Workers’ Educational 
1 Thornton, “Fircroft, the First People’s High School in England,” 
pia: 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
THEIR TRANSPLANTATION 28 3 
  Association and kindred institutions needed supple- 
menting in a particular way; that larger opportunities 
of systematic study should be brought within the reach 
of those pursuing it; and that, beyond all, there should 
be added to systematic study a common life and fellow- 
ship through which might be nurtured a clearer discern- 
ment of the things of abiding value. 
“ The desirable thing, indeed, was a modest Working 
Men’s College, which should be adaptable to varying 
standards of educational attainment on the part of its 
members, but the chief end of which should be to mold 
and fashion men, and teach them the greatest theme 
of all — the Art of Right Living. 
“ Education, it was felt, was not an exhaustive pursuit 
of facts nor a desultory acquaintance with them, but 
a broadening of the whole life, and the success of Fircroft 
would be measured by the extent of its achievement in 
this direction.” 
Fircroft has, for the past four years, worked along 
these lines with the greatest success. Laborers, clerks, 
teachers, gardeners, farmers, colliers, mechanics, and shop 
assistants from various parts of the United Kingdom 
have spent some time at Fircroft “ who are witnesses to 
the broader outlook made possible by their stay.” 
The school is situated near the Village Green at 
Bournville, and is set in three acres of beautiful old 
garden. The accommodations are limited to a family
-P-A-G-E-324
284 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
of twenty only. The school is equipped with library, 
lecture hall, common room, gymnasium, dressing rooms 
with shower baths, and a workshop. The garden is in- 
teresting. It offers opportunity for practical gardening in 
charge of an expert gardener; for open air study, — of 
which there is much at Fircroft, — and for recreation. 
Methods of instruction and subject matter are much 
like what is offered in the Danish schools. The sub- 
jects include Bible study, political and social history, 
economics, industrial history, English literature, natural 
science, local government, and social questions of the 
day. An interesting feature is the Monday Evening 
Lecture Course on social questions of the day by eminent 
specialists. Another recent innovation is a correspond- 
ence course which can reach many who find it impossible 
to be in residence.

It is interesting to have the opinion of the English 
press and the verdict of the resident students at Fir- 
croft on the value of such an institution. We may first 
quote from the report of a special representative of a 
prominent London paper,! who made a careful study of 
the school. He says in part: 
“T found the authentic stamp of the Héjskole on 
Fircroft. Here are workers — there a clerk, a mechanic 
or shop assistant, there a gardener, a labourer, or a 
miner — withdrawn, for a time only, from the daily 
round, to learn what they may make, if they will, not 
only of their minds and souls, but of their bodies — for 
physical exercises, the only compulsory thing at the rural 
high schools in Denmark, are given a prominent place 
at Fircroft. The three dozen men—in their early 
twenties, chiefly — cultivate the humanities in an old 
house sequestered in three acres of garden, and their 
way of life is simple and frugal. As to study, there is 
freedom of choice that characterizes the Héjskole sys- 
tem. There is also the same intention not to make of 
education a thing pumped into people. From the 
activities and opportunities of Fircroft there results, it 
is found, not an exhausting pursuit of facts nor a des- 
ultory acquaintance with them but a broadening of the 
whole life. It is certain that many who have been 
introduced for the first time at Fircroft to a wider world

of thought and knowledge are now, when back at their 
occupations, keener-eyed. and better able to play a 
serviceable part in the world. ‘The students,’ says the 
Warden, are ‘ drawn into a new atmosphere of study and 
reflection, affecting the whole of their subsequent life.’ 
“ The report of the inspectors of the Board of Educa- 
tion pays a tribute to. the high quality of instruction 
given. But the individual attention which the students 
receive is even more important than the class instruc- 
tion. The Warden, speaking on the subject of cultivat- 
ing a taste for literature, says illuminatingly: ‘A book 
must be found for each man which will make the direct- 
est appeal to his imagination. In the case of a man 
who has had a religious training, the thing that appeals 
to him most readily is poetry, like Lowell’s Vision of 
Sir Launfal. The influence of this upon the mind of a 
young farmer was magnetic. In the case of a farm 
laborer, book after book was suggested, apparently 
without any effect; the awakening came in reading 
Adam Bede. In the case of a mechanic, Kingsley struck 
the note which found a response.’ ” 
At the annual reunion of old Fircrofters held May 
25, 1912, six of the one-time students, Alf Stephens, 
Cecil Leeson, Bob Pounder, Syd Davis, Tom Handforth, 
and Frank Ferguson, gave five-minute speeches on 
“The Value of Fircroft: My Personal Experience,” 
which bring out some very illuminating phases of this
-P-A-G-E-327

and similar schools. These statements are contained 
in the July issue of “ The Old Fircrofter,” the student’s 
periodical : 
“Frank Ferguson said there were many ways in 
which Fircroft had benefited him. He came, having 
read a little and thought a little; but Fircroft filled in 
the gaps. He had previously had a fair grounding in 
Industrial History, but at Fircroft he got many details 
he couldn’t have got elsewhere. Then again at Fircroft, 
he had his mind ministered to on more than one side ; 
he had heard something of literature, and Bible matters, 
and science; and as a result he was now better equipped 
for serving the community. But that wasn’t all. Fir- 
croft also gave him food for his soul. It did something 
to temper his disposition; it gave him new points of 
view; and, mixing with other fellows, he was educated 
in human nature as well as in books. It was one of the 
great pleasures of his life to look back on the two terms 
he spent at Fircroft. 
“Bob Pounder said that at Fircroft he got hold of 
the idea that the wealth of the nation did not depend 
on pounds, shillings, and pence, but on healthy, well 
educated individuals. He found that religion did not 
consist of facts and creeds, but of feeling and thought, 
and action. But there was something that one couldn’t 
understand unless one spent a term at Fircroft. One 
got bound up with a lot of fellows.

“Tom Handforth said that before he came to Fir- 
croft he was a rebel; he was a rebel still, but a different 
kind of rebel. From his early days he had thought 
it was wrong for so few people to have so much, while 
so many had so little. He even joined a socialist party, 
but he hadn’t the faintest idea what socialism was, 
or which way he was going. At Fircroft he found the 
very thing he wanted. He learned something of the 
past history of the nation and of other nations, and

admission simply in order to attain positions conven- 
tionally regarded as higher than those held by working 
men, in connection with Trade Unions, etc., it seemed 
to him that where there was found in a crofter any 
talent worth cultivating, one could not afford to waste 
it. 
“(2) In answer to the question whether the Fircroft 
training had been of material advantage in his own 
case, he said that since his residence his wages had 
increased about one third and his worries about one 
hundredfold. Fircroft was quite at liberty to take 
credit for the one, provided it shouldered responsibility 
for the other. 
“ (3) He did not want to see any definite preparation 
for residence at Fircroft except that which should develop 
an interested state of mind. 
“(4) Asked what he would have done differently if he 
had his time at Fircroft over again, he said, first, that 
he now realized that, in the lecture, the student should 
work at least as hard as the lecturer; and secondly, 
that he would try to be courageous enough to do without 
a notebook at lectures. 
“ (5) He did not think that attendance at University 
classes by Fircroft students was advisable. Fircroft 
was too small to be divided, and if it was to keep its 
distinctive atmosphere it could not afford to find room 
for external students. 
U

“(6) Answering the question, What do you value 
most as the result of your residence at Fircroft? he 
emphasized three points. First, he had learned the 
value of books in giving information; secondly, he had 
learned the greater value of books in giving rise, in 
the reader, to thoughts which in a very real way were 
original; and thirdly, he had attained self-reliance. 
“Tn answer to the same series of questions, Syd 
Davis agreed in most points with Cecil Leeson. But 
he thought that it would be a great advantage to a 
prospective Fircrofter to have had a preliminary train- 
ing in the rudiments of English grammar and to have 
taken a course in the correspondence classes.” 
England has made a beginning. But “ whether such 
a school can become as widely popular here as it is in 
Denmark,” Professor Thornton says, “remains to be 
seen.” “If Lancashire and Yorkshire,” he continues, 
“had fifty such schools dotted about their country 
spots, and other counties had them in the same pro- 
portion, we should still have fewer for our population 
than they have in Denmark. But they would be 
enough to uplift not a man here and there, as already 
happens, but to leaven the whole lump. For Eng- 
lishmen are of the same race as Danes, Norsemen, and 
Swedes; and what has happened on the east of the 
North Sea may just as well happen on the west. There 
is no Sunday school, no council school, no town or

community that would not have received an upward 
impulse. The effect would be seen in all our industrial, 
political, and religious life.” 4

  CHAPTER XVII 
DanisH-AMERICAN Fork HicH SCHOOLS IN THE 
UnITED STATES 
Early History of the Transplantation. — Danish im- 
migration to the United States was of little consequence 
numerically before the close of the Civil War. The 
period 1865-1870 marks the beginning of a rising tide. 
Ten thousand Danes landed in the United States during 
the five years. Nearly 36,000 came during 1870-1880, 
and this number increased to 76,000 the next decade. 
But by this time agricultural conditions had become very 
much improved in the Danish Islands, and the emi- 
grants came in decreasing numbers, until now the an- 
nual influx is considerably less than it was in the early 
seventies. 
But many of these newcomers, scattering over the 
country and particularly over the Middle West, were 
old folk high school students who found it hard to 
forget the teachings of their early school days. They 
instinctively sought the open country, and made their 
pioneer settlements from Michigan and Iowa westward 
to the Pacific. Every settlement had its church and 
292
-P-A-G-E-333
  DANISH-AMERICAN FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 293 
its resident pastor, who was also generally a high school 
man. The pastors have generally taken the lead in 
organizing the schools within the settlements, also. 
In November, 1874, Rev. Olav Kirkeberg, a Nor- 
wegian in the service of the Danish-American Church, 
and resident pastor at Elkhorn, Iowa, an inland settle- 
ment many miles from railroad, opened the first 
Danish-American folk high school in the United States. 
Kirkeberg was a student of the great Norwegian folk 
schoolman, Christoffer Brunn, and his assistant at 
Elkhorn was Kristian Ostergaard, an old Askov student. 
Another school was founded at Ashland, Michigan, 
in 1882, by the Ryslinge student, Rev. H. J. Pedersen. 
Unfortunately, this school lay too far eastward to at- 
  
      tract Danish-Americans in sufficient numbers to pay 
expenses. Several able schoolmen, including Professor 
Christian Bay, a well-known writer on the folk high 
schools in English, have tried to reorganize the school. 
At the time of writing it is being reopened by a group 
of friends of the cause, who have great faith in its ulti- 
mate success. 
Another school which later suspended activity was 
opened at West Denmark, Wisconsin, in 1884, by Rev. 
K. L. Norgaard, also an Askov student. Schools were 
further established at Blair, Nebraska (Dana College) 
and Des Moines, Iowa (Grand View College) which 
still retain considerable of the folk high school spirit,

method, and subject matter; but whose chief work 
is now to prepare pastors for the two branches of the 
Danish Lutheran Church in the United States to which 
they belong. These may, therefore, be passed by in 
the present discussion. 
This leaves just three typical Danish-American 
folk high schools for our consideration: Elk Horn 
Folk High School, Elk Horn, Iowa; Nysted Folk High 
School, Nysted, Nebraska; and Danebod Folk High 
School, Tyler, Minnesota. 
Elk Horn Folk High School. — This and all the other 
schools of its kind in the United States have been founded 
either immediately by some body within the Danish 
Lutheran Church or by an association of members 
belonging to the Church. The Elk Horn school was 
at first the property of the congregation. The campus 
comprised three acres, upon which was erected an 
unpretentious main building costing about $3000. 
This has twice been destroyed by fire, and each time 
rebuilt larger and better. There is also a dormitory 
for young women, a gymnasium, and a home for the 
principal. 
The school, when it was first opened, lay far out on 
the Iowa rolling prairies, and the settlers were pretty 
scattered. But the Danish farmers of Shelby and 
Audubon counties supported it loyally, giving freely 
of their small means and doing such work with their
-P-A-G-E-335
DANISH-AMERICAN FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 205 
  own hands and teams as might be required of them. 
All coal and building materials, for example, had to be 
hauled over hilly roads from railway stations twelve 
to twenty miles away. All this work was cheerfully 
donated by the settlers. Even the students, who in 
Elk Horn’s most palmy days used to come from twenty 
or more states, had to be transported laboriously by 
wagon. “‘ These experiences,” says A. P. Juhl, the 
present principal of the school, “ were not of the most 
pleasant when the students in order to ease the load for 
the horses were obliged to get out and trudge through 
the mud up the hills, to say nothing of the bitter winds 
they often were obliged to face.”’ Nothing short of the 
folk high school spirit could have suffered such hard- 
ships without complaint. 
The work at Elk Horn in the early day was in every 
respect similar to the work of the Danish schools. Man: 
lectures and_very_little textbook work was the plan. The 
  lectures — especially from 11 to 12 noon and 7 to 8 at 
night— were well attended by the farmers of the vicinity, 
who would drive miles to be present. 
Rev. Kirkeberg was succeeded by Rev. H. J. Pedersen, 
who later founded the Ashland school. In 1882, he 
was in turn superseded by Rev. Kristian Anker, a 
distant relative of the great schoolman, Herman Anker 
of “Sagatun,” Norway. Under Anker’s administra- 
tion, from 1882-1897, the school did its best work. Stu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  296 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
dents came annually from nearly half the states in the 
Union, reaching close up towards th two hundred 
mark. Anker owned the school privately, and under 
this management it naturally prospered the best. Then 
came church differences and other disagreements. The 
school was sold to one of two discordant church bodies, 
and after that time has not been so prosperous. 
Down through the years considerable classwork has 
been added in academic subjects. The lectures have 
been reduced in numbers in the same proportion. The 
school has done some work in preparing teachers for the 
rural schools and even for commercial activities. But, 
  unfortunately, it has not seen its way clear to be of any 
material assistance in tying the agriculturist to the soil 
in the way the modified Danish schools do in the mother 
country. 
Nysted Folk High School. — This interesting little 
school was founded in the fall of 1887, by Rev.-C. J. 
Skovgaard, who also belonged to the large group of Askov 
students doing pioneering work in the Middle West. 
The school is located near the small pei of Nysted 
in Howard County, Nebraska. The sc!

-P-A-G-E-337
DANISH-AMERICAN FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 207 
  The second year a school was opened with a capacity 
for twenty-four students; but the founder had difficul- 
ties in making ends meet financially, as he was obliged to 
pay 24 per cent interest on a small loan for the building! 
A corporation was established and given the name 
“ Nysted Héjskolesamfund,” which purchased and now 
supports the school. This body consists of about three 
hundred stockholders, and is independent of any church 
organization. A suitable building with dormitory ca- 
pacity for fifty students was soon after erected on an at- 
tractive campus of ten acres. 
“The school,” says Principal Aage Moller, “ has 
replaced the undesirable dancing and drinking of former 
days with a serious spiritual life. The whole country- 
side, including teachers and students, form a harmonious 
brotherhood of kindred interests.” 
“Our school,” continues Mr. Miller, “is reared 
on exactly the same principles as are the folk high schools 
in Denmark. But, the United States is now our country. 
This must be kept well in mind. We are planting the 
school in American soil, and we feel that success shall 
in the end be ours.” 
Eighty to ninety students are enrolled in the course 
of a year; young men during the months December to 
March, and young women during April to July. An in- 
teresting short course of eight days is given in March for 
old and young people. The work is highly inspirational.

It includes lectures on Church History, Bible study, 
social and economic problems, debates and song. 
Danebod Folk High School. — There is a large degree 
of similarity in the history of the Danish-American 
folk high schools. They all began as pioneer institu- 
tions in new prairie settlements, and have all seen hard 
times, always hampered in their possibilities by lack of 
funds. They have, every one, had among their leaders 
and teachers many who were ready to suffer surprising 
hardships for the sake of the cause of education. Per- 
haps none of the schools has had a more varied career 
than Danebod, near Tyler, Minnesota, and yet sur- 
vived, with a fair promise of greater usefulness in the 
years to come. 
Danebod was organized in 1888 by Rev. H. J. Peder- 
sen, who has been mentioned above in connection with 
other schools. A heroic struggle now began, which 
has been continued for a little more than a quarter of 
acentury. In the early years, the settlers were desper- 
ately poor and could do but little. After the school 
had been in operation for a few months, teachers and 
students began to feel the need of an assembly hall and 
gymnasium. Lumber was expensive, but great bowlders 
— glacial drift— were abundant. Many hundred loads 
of these were dragged together, and slowly hewn into 
shape for the “‘ Stone House.” This little structure was 
used for several years as church, auditorium, and gym-

  nasium. “It was not attractive,” says an old stu- 
dent, “ but it was here that many of us first learned to 
know ourselves, and that to us sheds an everlasting halo 
around it.” 
Danebod gradually grew from its humble beginnings. 
A church was built, the original school building was 
greatly enlarged, then a gymnasium and, finally, a 
small hospital, were added. By 1912, during the ad- 
ministration of Rev. Thorvald Knudsen, the attend- 
ance had reached the one hundred mark. The new 
principal, Rev. Halvdan Helweg, has just celebrated 
the quarter-centennial of Danebod amidst promises of a 
most prosperous future. 
Hindrances to Satisfactory Growth of the Danish- 
American Schools. — It is undeniable that the Danish- 
American folk high schools have not succeeded as well 
as their friends had hoped; and, yet, if they should all 
close their work for good right now, no one who under- 
stands the work they have done would have the temerity 
to say that their existence has been in vain, or that the 
results from their labor have not been worth the sacri- 
fice of the heroic souls who gave both their time and 
their means to the cause. The schools have done a 
work of inestimable value among Danish-Americans, 
and one can only wish that the future may shape itself 
in such a way that the work of the schools for the coming 
years may be greatly enlarged. 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
300 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
  It is in place here to point out the main reasons why 
the schools have succeeded no better than they have; 
so that this be not taken as valid reason why other 
schools of the folk high school type in the United States 
should not be able to prosper. 
Perhaps no one difficulty that Danish-American lead- 
ers have suffered under is greater and more insuperable 
than the scattered condition of the people from whom 
students must be drawn. There is scarcely half a 
million Danes in the United States, counting the first 
native-born generation. And these are scattered from 
ocean to ocean. Even under these conditions the-folk 
high school spirit has been strong enough to draw stu- 
dents for many hundred miles, so that even the humblest 
school can boast students from half a dozen states. 
At Elk Horn, fifty students of the winter session, 1896— 
1897, as an experiment, averaged up their traveling 
expenses — going to and from the school, and their 
expenses at the school — and found that-it_had—cost 
15 per cent more to reach-the school than to spend-the 
term there! This seems cause enough to force the 
closing of almost any ordinary kind of school. 
Again, there has been a lack of financial backing. 
The men who led in the work have themselves been 
poor men. It will be recalled that the Danish schools 
could scarcely make any headway before the state came 
to their aid with subsidies. The growth of the schools
-P-A-G-E-343
  DANISH-AMERICAN FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 301 
has been crippled in Norway for the same reason. It 
is quite certain that had substantial aid been extended 
to these schools in the United States, they might have 
succeeded quite as well as they have done in Denmark. 
It would seem that here is an opportunity for educational 
philanthropists or foundations to extend aid to a worthy 
and important cause. 
It would be hard to deny, too, that some of the high 
school leaders, who have had all their " training from Den- 
mark, found it-difficult_to readjust- themselves to the 
newconditions. The tendency is that, in spite of their nat- 
ural broadmindedness and contrary to Grundtvig’s philos- 
ophy, whichis all-embracing, they would expend too much 
Suetey in reproducing whist ee and life, — 
On the pote atte it is but fair to state that the Janie 
have served as a check upon the over-hasty immigrant, 
making of him a saner, truer Danish-American for being 
first well-grounded in the best that the schools have 
had to offer. , 
A last cause for indifferent success is, no doubt, 
that the schools have been unable to adapt their activ- 
ities, in any large measure, to American conditions, and 
this may be explained again in lack of funds. If, for 
example, the threé Danish-American folk high schools 
that are now active should reorganize their school 
plants on such a basis ds to combine the pure folk cul-
-P-A-G-E-344
302 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
ture with the practical courses offered, say, at Haslev 
or Vallekilde, and more particularly with the long and 
short courses of such schools as Kerehave or Fyn Stift’s 
School at Odense, they would unquestionably be enabled 
to accomplish a much more vital work for Danish- 
Americans than they are now doing. In other words, 
it would seem that it should be possible to combine in 
the Danish-American folk high schools of the future 
Grundtvig’s philosophy with the practical work of the 
other Danish schools which are so successful in meeting 
the needs of an agricultural people.

CHAPTER XVIII 
Feasisitiry or ADAPTING FoLtk HicH ScHOOLs TO 
AMERICAN CONDITIONS 
General Statement.— The discussion of adapting 
the folk high schools to American conditions has been 
left to the last. It seems scarcely necessary to raise 
the question as to whether such an adaptation is pos- 
sible after telling the Danish story in detail above, or 
whether it is desirable to make use of the inspiring folk 
high school culture as a leavening influence in American 
communities. The only questions asked ought to be, 
Where should the beginnings be made? And how 
should they be made? 
That there is both a place and a need must be evident 
to people of ordinary discernment. The great national 
industrial transition going on round about us at the 
present time is forcing upon the country a partial reor- 
ganization of the educational system. Fifty years 
ago the American people were essentially agricultural. 
By 1913 it has become half rural and half urban, half 
agricultural and half industrial. The cities are grow- 
ing apace — often at the expense of rural communities 
303 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
304 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
—and thither are flocking also hundreds of thousands 
of unassimilated aliens. 
It is self-evident that an educational process which 
can reach clear down to the roots of things, strengthening 
, character, and teaching rights of fellowman, loyalty 
to the State, and fear of God, even while it supplies the 
youth and old men, without distinction, with practical 
training for bread-winning, may be made of inestimable 
value in hurrying the Americanization of the alien. 
Such is the Danish system. But the school, after all, 
adapts itself most readily to country needs and condi- 
tions. And in American rural life there seems, if any- 
thing, greater urgency for educational reorganization 
than in city life. 
’ The Agricultural Reorganization. — The movement 
away from the land — either to the cities or to newer, 
unexhausted soil — has retarded and stunted the agri- 
cultural development of whole sections in our country. 
In places this retardation has culminated in the decay 
of both agriculture and the people who live on the soil. 
There is a surprising amount of degeneracy in many 
one-time prosperous rural communities which have 
become drained of their best blood. Likewise, other 
sections, lying far from the highways of civilization, 
have become lost to progress, not because of disinte- 
gration of population particularly, but because of the 
deadening effects due to isolation from fellowmen. 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
FEASIBILITY OF ADAPTING FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 305 
  The future_of_our_agricultural -life-must—be~closely 
tied up with education. The pioneer period of the 
nation lies behind us; and even the time of household 
economy in American life is past. Instead, we are in 
the midst of a period of exploitation. Even before 
rural districts had felt the call of the cities and the beck- 
oning of the West, land exploitation and land specula- 
tion’ were well under way. One of our greatest national 
weaknesses is this disregard for the God-given soil and 
the way we plunder it. The soil should be holy; but 
the schools, at least, have been unable to inculcate this 
doctrine. The very worst phase of our present agricul- 
tural transition, perhaps, is tenant farming. Ameri- 
can landowners are moving to town, drawn thither 
by educational, religious, and social attractions. Here 
they add little to organized life, being naturally con- 
servative and opposed to progressive enterprise. The 
farms are left in the hands of tenants that “ skin ” 
the soil to death in their efforts to meet the increas- 
ingly high rents. This suicidal system is gradually 
destroying our greatest natural resource — the soil. 
And now, what have the rural schools been doing to 
check this national evil? 
The Old Rural Schools Unable to Cope with the Situa- 
tion. — The small one-teacher schools which answered 
well the needs of rural life among the pioneers and the 
household economy type of farmers, can no longer keep
-P-A-G-E-348
306 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
  up with the procession of change and reorganization in 
agricultural life, and must be abandoned for a new 
type of school organized to meet the needs of our new 
agriculture — that of the husbandman type. 
It is true that in some sections these small schools 
must persist for an indefinite time, chiefly on account 
of geographical difficulties. Here, the most will have 
to be made of a bad situation by providing good, 
well-trained and well-paid teachers, and who, withal, 
must have the right vision of the new agricultural 
life. 
Coming of the Centralized Farmers’ Schools. —A 
great movement is now beginning to. spread across the 
continent, which contemplates the consolidation of the 
many weakling schools in a few centrally located, graded 
farmers’ schools. The best organized of the consoli- 
dated schools offer eight grades of elementary work and 
from two to four years of high school work. 
The new schools should do for the community what 
the old have been incapable of doing; namely, training 
the boys to become scientific farmers and, the girls prac- 
tical farmers’ helpmeets)) Such training can be made to 
inculcate a wholesome love of countrylife, and may be 
expected to counteract the townward exodus) More- 
over, from these schools must come many impulses to 
organize the country people on a more permanent social 
and economic basis.
-P-A-G-E-349
FEASIBILITY OF ADAPTING FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 307 
How the Reorganized Schools may profit by the 
Danish System. — The first lesson taught by a study 
of the Danish system is that rural schools must be reared 
in the midst of the rural community and nowhere else. 
By this is meant the open country or the rural-minded 
village, preferably the former. The whole system of 
Danish rural schools — elementary school, folk high 
school, agricultural school, and school of household 
economics — invariably lie in a rural environment. 
Their founders are too wise to tempt the pupils’ sus- 
ceptibilities for city life by rearing the schools in the 
organized urban centers. 
There are in the United States at this time several 
thousand consolidated schools, many of them built 
in the midst of ideal rural surroundings — as real farm 
schools. But in too many instances, unfortunately, 
consolidation has been brought about by disorganizing 
independent — adjacent to some village or larger 
town, adding the taxable farm area to this and sending 
the children to the town school. It should be under- 
stood that this is not invariably a wrong way to solve 
the problem. (If the village is rural-minded and clean, 
nearly as good results. may..be.looked for; but ordi- 
narily, the town school.is organized.solely for the town 
children, and the farm.boys.and_girls.are-not-likely to 
come under satisfactory influences,.since. the agricul- 
tural atmosphere will be lacking. 
 
-P-A-G-E-350
  308 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
Parenthetically speaking, it may be stated here that 
in one or two states where the consolidation has taken 
place right in the open country, the organizers have been 
so unwise as to carry to the country a fully organized 
town course of study, including grades and high school, 
striving to graft this city branch on the rural stock. 
Such procedure must fail wherever tried, and in several 
instances it has brought the reorganization of the schools 
into ill-repute. 
The Folk High School Spirit in Our Agricultural 
Communities. — It has been stated and reiterated above 
that the folk high school spirit has emancipated the 
agricultural population in Denmark. It has at least 
made them the peers of their city brethren. They 
have become leaders in affairs—in production, in 
distribution, in politics, and chiefly because they have 
learned to think for themselves and to act independently 
of the industrial classes. As much cannot be said of 
our farmers as a body. The schools have been of small 
help in this respect. Now that the new agricultural 
schools are coming to the nation we should be clear on 
several points : 
First, there is great danger of going to the extreme 
in the immediately practical and technical. The work 
of the schools is in danger of focusing too much on 
making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, 
on teaching girls to cook and keep house according to
-P-A-G-E-351
    
FEASIBILITY OF ADAPTING FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 309 
sanitary regulations, and the like. These things are 
all excellent and must be taught in the schools; but they 
are utterly insufficient to make us a really great agri- 
cultural nation. Let us recall here, it was not the local 
agricultural schools and household economic schools 
that primarily made Denmark a great scientific agri- 
cultural nation. If the worldly practical is separated 
from a broadening culture the life horizon of the pupil 
is prone to become narrowed down to what is immedi- 
ately present only, resulting in shrewd, calculating-seek- 
ing for personal gain instead of a far-reaching altruism. 
Second, our final conquest of the soil can scarcely 
come before a more genuine folk culture permeates our 
rural communities at large. This would teach a greater 
love of the soil— and the naturalist farmer is the great- 
est kind of farmer; it would help us to measure the 
good in life by spiritual standards and not by man-made 
rules. It would help us to rise above the limitations 
of locality and state, and teach an understanding of 
the national and even universal in existence. 
Therefore, men and women, trained in schools where 
this inspiration abides, themselves imbued with the 
spirit of altruism, wise as to the purpose in life, inspired 
and inspiring — and such only, should be given charge 
of the new farm schools! 
Inspirational Lectures and Extension Courses. — 
The writer believes that there should be at least one 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
  
| 
| 310 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
inspirational lecture by teachers and others daily in 
all the consolidated rural schools. There is need of 
real thought food for the daily appetite of adolescent 
boys and girls. To argue that there is no time for these 
things in the schools would be much the same as to say 
that we have not time to live our lives. If teachers 
are incapable of giving heart-to-heart talks intended 
to make the pupils pause and seriously seek the purpose 
of life, it is quite evident that they are out of place in the 
schoolroom. 
The Danish folk high schools are centers from which 
all kinds of extension work spring. To begin with, 
grown-up people of the community take advantage of 
the noon-day and evening lectures in the regular lec- 
ture halls; and in summer they attend numerous meet- 
ings in the groves near by the schools. Finally, the 
high school leaders organize lecture courses in the assem- 
bly halls, far and wide, over the country. Some such 
work is being done in our country now; but it is only 
a meager beginning. Every consolidated and other 
farm school must become the social and intellectual 
center of the community. Stated lecture courses — 
both inspirational and practical— should be offered 
the grown people of the school community. 
Short Courses for All who need Help. — Nothing in 
the plans of the folk high schools and their auxiliaries 
appealed to the investigator more strongly than did
-P-A-G-E-353
FEASIBILITY OF ADAPTING FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 3II 
the continuous short courses. At the small hold schools, 
for example, new courses begin each first and third 
Tuesday of the month, and continue eleven or twelve 
months in the year. The time spent in school is short ; 
but it is long enough to give an abundant store of inspira- 
tion and much practical knowledge. 
Annual short courses are now a part of the established 
work of most of our agricultural colleges, and even the 
local village and country schools in a few states have 
begun to offer this work. But the work has not yet 
been carried so far that people beyond school age, as 
ordinarily understood, feel that the school is intended 
as fully for them as for the children. It will be a great 
day in the life of American country communities when 
the schools shall see their way clear to labor continuously 
for the whole community — to seek to solve the life 
problems for all the people, whether young or old. 
The preceding paragraphs have merely suggested 
the application of Danish folk school spirit and matter 
to the new farm schools that are gradually superseding 
the older smaller schools. The remainder of the sec- 
tion is devoted to the possible establishment of the 
school as a whole —in a modified form —in certain 
sections of the country. : 
Why there is Need of Schools for Grown-ups in 
the United States. — When the Federal Census for 
the year 1910 was taken, there were in the United States 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  
  312 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
5,516,163 persons ten years of age and over who could 
neither read nor write, including 2,273,603 who were 
twenty-one years of age and over. “ Of these illiter- 
ates, 3,184,633, or 58 per cent, were white persons; 
1,534,272, or 28 per cent, were native-born whites; 
and 1,650,361, or 30 per cent, foreign-born whites; 
2,227,731, O© 40 per cent, were negroes. The rest, 2 
per cent, were Indians, Chinese, Japanese, and others.” ! 
More than two thirds of all the illiterates come from 
rural communities. These illiterates are not now limited 
to race or section of country. The colored illiteracy 
of the South is almost balanced by the ignorant aliens 
of the North; and the illiteracy among the remote 
parts of the Southern Mountain Plateau is scarcely 
greater than the illiteracy in rural life in the Northern 
Appalachians. 
But all this illiteracy is found very largely among 
persons above twenty years of age —men and women 
who cannot be expected to get their education from 
the ordinary school. The nation has its choice between 
letting this generation of illiterates continue to live 
and die in their ignorance at a fearful cost to national 
life; or it may organize schools especially adapted to 
their needs, in which they may get the rudiments of 
learning, and in addition to this, some inspiration to do

  upland region that usually goes by the name of the 
South Atlantic Highland.! 
This comprises a total area of 108,164 square miles, 
with a population of 5,085,736. One whole state and 
parts of seven others have been carved out of the South 
Atlantic Highland, which really embraces the three 
well-marked geographical areas known as the Alleghany- 
Cumberland Plateau Belt, the Greater Appalachian 
Valley Belt, and the Appalachian Mountain Belt, or 
as it is also called, the Blue Ridge Belt. It includes 
the whole of West Virginia, forty-two counties in west- 
ern Virginia, twenty-three in western North Carolina, 
and four in western South Carolina; twenty-five in 
northern Georgia, seventeen in northeastern Alabama, 
forty-five in eastern Tennessee, and thirty-six in eastern 
Kentucky. 
While large areas within this Highland are no more 
backward educationally than the rest of the country, 
all are included here for convenience of statement. 
But the truth remains in any case that adult illiteracy 
in these mountain regions is surprisingly large and duty 
demands that educators face the facts as they really 
are in order that relief may come. The Federal Census 
for 1910 gives the illiteracy per thousand in the total 
population ten years of age and over in these states as

follows: West Virginia, 83; Kentucky, 121; Tennessee, 
136; Virginia, 152; North Carolina, 185; Georgia, 
207; Alabama, 229. The figures for adult males twenty- 
one years of age and over are even more startling. 
For the same states they are: West Virginia, 104 for 
each thousand in the total population; Kentucky, 145; 
Tennessee, 157; Virginia, 177; North Carolina, 213; 
Georgia, 228; Alabama, 243 ; and South Carolina, 271. 
These figures are for the entire state, and would in some 
cases be increased if applied to the highland area only, 
while in others, on account of the large lowland negro 
population, they would be somewhat diminished. The 
figures are, however, sufficiently correct to emphasize 
the urgency of the need. 
The “ Moonlight” Schools of Kentucky, an Experi- 
ment in the Elimination of Adult Illiteracy. — Attempts 
have been made from time to time by Church organiza- 
tions and individuals to reach the illiterate adults of 
the southern highlands. Some of these attempts have 
been more or less abortive of results, and others have 
proved a great blessing to limited communities. A 
most notable illustration of what can be done — show- 
ing also the startling need of what must be done — is 
the work of Mrs. Cora Wilson Stewart and her asso- 
ciates, in the so-called “ Moonlight ” or night schools 
for illiterates, which were begun in Rowan County, 
Kentucky, in the fall of 1911. 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
316 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
  Mrs. Stewart made a careful study of local condi- 
tions and decided the most feasible plan to be to open 
night schools on moonlight evenings in the public school- 
houses over the county. The regular teachers all 
responded to the call and made their preparations and 
issued their invitations. We read, “It was expected 
that the response would be slow, but more than 1,200 
men and women from 18 to 86 years of age were enrolled 
the first evening. They came trooping over the hills 
and out of the hollows, some to add to the meager edu- 
cation received in the inadequate schools of their child- 
hood, some to receive their first lessons in reading 
and writing. Among them were not only illiterate 
farmers and their illiterate wives, sons, and daughters, 
but also illiterate merchants or storekeepers, illiterate 
ministers, and illiterate lumbermen. Mothers, bent 
with age, came that they might learn to read 
letters from absent sons and daughters, and that 
they might learn for the first time to write to 
them.” 1 ‘ 
This remarkable experiment grew rapidly in popu- 
larity. In 1912, the enrollment of adults in Rowan 
County reached nearly 1,600 and the movement had 
meanwhile spread to eight or ten other counties. Of 
the 1,600 mentioned above, 300 entered the school 
utterly unable to read and write at all, 300 were from

those who had learned in September, 1911, and 1,000 
men and women of meager education. 
The work of such schools as these must naturally be 
limited to the merest rudiments of education. To learn 
to read and write, to spell and figure, with brief drills 
in the essentials of language, history, geography, civics, 
sanitation, and agriculture—this is the most that 
can be expected. But the mountain districts crave 
vastly more than reading, writing, and arithmetic. The 
fatalism of retardation engendered by centuries of isola- 
tion, poverty, and civil war has placed a peculiar stamp 
upon the civilization there which mere academic schools 
  
    will find it difficult to remove. At least it cannot be   
removed in the present generation. 
The Berry Country-life Schools near Rome, Georgia. 
— Religious and philanthropic organizations, as was 
stated above, have done what they could to alleviate 
life conditions in the South Atlantic Highland. This has 
been done chiefly through mission schools of elementary 
and secondary grade. Many of these schools also have 
limited their efforts to the mere rudiments of reading, 
writing, and arithmetic, although a small number of the 
most successful have extended their work beyond this 
and have succeeded in teaching the practical things 
necessary to improve immediate living conditions. In 
this way the fine old home crafts of the early Scotch-Irish 
pioneers have become revived in places through the
-P-A-G-E-362
318 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
schools. Weaving, basket making, and other useful 
household arts are taking on a new life in some moun- 
tain homes, which means that a new contentment and 
an added source of income are coming to the moun- 
tain women. 
But mere mission schools and “ moonlight ” schools 
cannot hope to solve the great problems of the moun- 
tains. This demands a country-life school where the 
mountain folk can come and live and do. At least one 
such school has been organized and is now beginning 
to bless the young men and the young women in the 
Southern highlands. This is the remarkable Berry 
Country-life Schools at Mount Berry near Rome, 
Georgia. The school was founded in 1902 by Miss 
Martha Berry, a Southern woman of the highest ideals 
and sympathies, who is devoting her life and her means 
to setting up a new race of country-life leaders in her 
own section of the South. The Berry schools — for 
there are separate schools for young men and young 
women — more nearly approach the Danish ideal than 
does any other school of its kind in our country. Here 
is taught a love of the soil and the dignity of honest 
labor. Here the young men are taught self-help and 
are assisted to useful trades, while the young women are 
taught independence and thrift and are prepared to 
become practical housekeepers. With more means at 
its disposal, this great institution might be enabled to 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
FEASIBILITY OF ADAPTING FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 319 
reach outward to bless all of the people— young and 
old — who stand in need of inspiration and guidance to 
get over the hard places in life — and therewith fulfill 
all the requirements of the Danish folk school system. 
Schools which might be transformed into Country- 
life Institutions after the Danish Type. — A study of 
higher educational institutions in our country discloses 
the fact that many denominational, private, and semi- 
private colleges and schools which in the past have done 
great public service in an educational way, now lie 
stranded, high and dry, because they have been unable 
to keep up with the flood tide of national change. Every 
section of the country has schools of the old classic type 
which, because of their ultraconservatism and_ reluc- 
tance to conform their work with modern demands, can 
no longer do a service commensurate with the physical 
equipment at their disposal. Occasionally it has hap- 
pened that better supported State schools with more 
liberal curricula have dispossessed the smaller institu- 
tions. 
Many such schools lie on the borders of the South 
Atlantic Highland, in the midst of a large native popula- 
tion with the finest of traditions, and almost under the 
shadows of the mountains where dwell a folk of pure 
Anglo-Saxon origin, but now retarded and in need of 
help. The people of the valleys and the mountain 
sides cannot be saved by the philosophy of the ancients, 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
320 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
nor by courses in Latin and Greek — excellent though 
all these be. The mountain folk crave a different kind of 
learning — a culture that can help them live more com- 
plete lives as members of the great human family and as 
citizens of the State and Nation, which will help them 
earn their daily bread in their own community. 
Is it not fair to say that a school of the Berry type is 
doing vastly more to lift the nation than are many of 
the small schools of the old scholastic type which are 
unable to aid the common folk pleading for help at their 
doors? Is it not time for men to rise up and reorganize 
these schools by turning them away from the past and 
facing them towards the needs of the present day? 
The introduction of a good measure of Danish folk high 
school culture and agricultural theory and practice 
would unquestionably restore them to their former place 
of usefulness in the great work of the Nation. 
How the Schools might be Reorganized. — The schools 
should be able to inspire to an early coérdination of head, 
heart, and hand. Real inspirers must be found to take 
charge of the schools. These should offer a liberal 
number of lectures on historical, social-economic, and 
local themes, in connection with the practical work in 
the rudiments of learning. 
The schools should receive all who are not now looked 
after by the public schools. In some communities 
the schools would include even the public school chil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  FEASIBILITY OF ADAPTING FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS 321 
dren. There should be courses for those who are entirely 
illiterate as well as for those who have had some school- 
ing. The schools must, in fact, be ready to meet the 
problems of all the people, without regard to age or 
preparation. The poor hillside farms have their prob- 
lems — these must be looked after. The mountains 
need their own artisan class to rebuild the homes and 
teéstablish the household arts of the olden time on a 
modern footing. There should be long courses for the 
youth and continuous short courses for their parents 
and grandparents. There should be day lectures open 
to the whole country side, and extension lectures should 
be carried into the remotest coves. The schools for 
smallholders in Denmark had conditions almost as 
difficult to meet. What they did, Americans will not 
refuse to do. 
The work might be directed to some extent by the 
national government, and be, in time, subsidized by 
national and state aid. The heads of the schools 
should have much the same freedom as in the Danish 
schools. As a beginning, tuition and lodging should 
be entirely free, and scholarships might include all ex- 
penses in return for work done on the school premises. 
Schools in which to train the “ Inspirers.”” — But who 
shall the teachers be in these schools? Whence shall 
come the inspirers able to understand the needs of their 
people and willing to undertake the work? Much 
, 4
-P-A-G-E-366
322 RURAL DENMARK AND ITS SCHOOLS 
the same questions are being asked throughout the 
nation to-day in regard to the supply of teachers for 
the modern rural schools. It is easy to see that the 
trained leadership needed in country districts cannot be 
realized until a staff of teachers, professionally trained 
and with the right vision and power, establish them- 
selves as permanent teachers. Heretofore, the schools 
have done little to prepare rural teachers for their diffi- 
cult tasks. A most encouraging sign of the times is 
this that some Normal Schools, Colleges of Agriculture, 
and Schools of Education in the Universities have begun 
to see their opportunity in training teachers for the 
new farm schools. 
But with all that is being done, there is urgent need 
for one or more central schools to devote all their energies 
to the preparation of rural life leaders of all kinds — 
teachers, local agricultural experts, rural community 
organizers of various kinds, including the men to take 
charge of the transplanted folk high schools. The 
Seaman Knapp Memorial School at Nashville is prom- 
ising to train men for rural leadership. Perhaps this 
school and other southern institutions similarly or- 
ganized may begin the great task of preparing the first 
leaders for the folk schools in the South Atlantic High- 
land. Possibly even some of the old scholastic insti- 
tutions may hear the call and answer it.

A Brier STATEMENT OF THE RuRAL LIFE MovEMENT 
IN THE UNITED States? 
INTRODUCTORY 
We of the United States have met with no great 
political disaster to stir us on to larger purpose. But 
we have with us to-day, nevertheless, many serious 
problems that will require our thoughtful and prayerful 
consideration. Of these, none has greater significance 
than the country life movement, so called. 
Our country life is undergoing a transition. There is 
a shifting, changing, and one might almost say disin- 
tegration going on in country population, manifesting 
itself in the crumbling, or at least, weakening, of church 
and school and allied institutions out in the open coun- 
try. This situation must be met fairly and frankly by 
the thinking men and women of America. It is well 
to bear in mind that our country life is our only genu- 
inely normal American life. It stands for a rugged 
conservatism which is both wholesome and essential

in the strife to reconcile all the elements of our present 
civilization. A proper solution of the difficulties now 
confronting American country life must ultimately be 
of vital importance to city life and national life as a 
whole. Under such circumstances, we may well con- 
sider what other nations are doing to make their country 
life satisfactory and wholesome. The least we can 
learn is that the past lack of policy has lead to needless 
disorganization, and that the introduction ofa virile 
policy of progressive forethought at the present time 
will do as much for our people as it has done in other 
countries where tried. 
HISTORY OF CHANGES IN AMERICAN RURAL LIFE 
The Pioneers. — Our New England forefathers lived 
a village life, with their existence centering in the meet- 
inghouse and the grammar school. Their pastors and 
teachers of the first generation wore the gowns of Oxford 
and Cambridge. The life they lived was of the house- 
hold economy type. Modes of life were simple. Each 
family or group of families produced practically what- 
ever was necessary for life’s sustenance. Each child 
in the family was taught to fear God and to study his 
catechism, and the three R’s. The practical phases of 
education which no longer are taught in the average 
home were a part of the daily training. 
Meanwhile, the primitive country folk — the pioneers 
 
-P-A-G-E-369
  APPENDIX 325 
— had their wilderness to conquer. Their environment 
made them independent and self-reliant. From that day 
to this the dwellers in our great open country have been 
swayed by an individualistic spirit which in those days 
was essential to existence. They lived along the frontier 
line, ever pushing it westward, breaking a path in which 
civilization could follow. Such men and women had 
little of school and church. Some of them could worry 
their way through Webster’s spelling book and the 
Bible. They prayed as they shot, if they prayed at all 
—straight and to the mark! When the circuit rider 
and perambulating schoolmaster came from the older 
settlements, the restless path breakers for civilization 
moved nearer to the setting sun. While the pioneer 
day is past, farm districts still retain much of the self- 
sufficient individualism which marked that period. This 
trait, in many ways so praiseworthy, is the very thing 
that makes it difficult for farmers to-day to stand 
together and coéperate in things of mutual concern. 
The Household Farmer. — Slowly, as the pioneer 
cleared the way, the household farmer filled the land. 
He reared homes and tilled the soil. His tenancy was 
a permanent one. The household arts were brought 
out to the farmstead from the New England village. 
Church spires began to appear along the sky line. 
Church services were held with some regularity; or 
in lieu of these services Bible study and devotional 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
326 APPENDIX 
  exercises had place in most households. Schools were 
found at long intervals — schools well attended, because 
those were days of large families when children found a 
five or six mile walk to school no great hardship. Many 
of these early tillers of the soil may have been practical 
farmers, but scientific agriculturists they certainly were 
not. With all their fear of God they did not hold His 
soil sacred. Plundered year by year through a same- 
ness of crops, which knew no rotation, the soil early 
became impoverished, and great regions east of the 
Alleghanies faced their period of decay and disintegra- 
tion. As the vast corn and wheat lands in the Middle 
West were thrown open to settlement, the sterile New 
England hillside farms speedily succumbed to the un- 
equal competition. This led to farm abandonment or 
at least to depletion of the households on the small 
unproductive farms in New England, and along the 
entire Atlantic seaboard as far south as Georgia. 
Mid-country Development. — West of the Allegha- 
nies a great, virile people, of restless and unquenched 
spirit, seized upon the land. Their love of religion and 
education burned strong in them, and churches and 
schools kept pace with development of the soil. One 
thing especially was marked: These churches were 
built to answer the needs of the time. None then 
demanded resident preachers. When the circuit rider 
made his round every four or six weeks the whole country- 
 
-P-A-G-E-371
  
APPENDIX 327 
side gathered to hear the Word. The children were 
baptized; the young folks were wed. Those were the 
thriving days of camp meetings and emotional revivals ; 
for such things were bound to move strongly men and 
women dwelling, as our fathers, in the midst of great 
expanse of prairie hemmed in by vast forest reaches. 
The schools, too, played an important part in the crude 
civilization of the times. Brawn rather than brains 
was master; indeed, most people took seriously the old 
saying that “ without lickin’ there can be no larnin’.” 
But mark the change! Settlers coming from the 
older Eastern States brought along with them to the 
New West their old family traditions, their religious 
sentiments, and their educational ideals. Here is seen 
the beginning of a denominational rivalry which in our 
day has brought disaster to the country church. At 
every crossroad, where people at one time had been 
content to worship in a union church, two, three, or 
more rival churches appeared. Competition in reli- 
gious life seemed for years to stimulate to noblest 
effort; but, unfortunately, a reaction soon set in, com- 
ing, as we shall see, from a source then unexpected, and 
continuing until in our day the entire country church 
has lost much of its one-time influence as a community 
builder and leader. 
The same may be said of the school. If the early 
schools could boast nothing else, they certainly were 
‘  
-P-A-G-E-372
  328 APPENDIX 
  big schools. A man teacher, occasionally well educated, 
taught here big crowds of strapping boys and girls. But 
by and by local ambition and short-sightedness forced 
the division and redivision of these large districts into 
smaller and smaller units until the limited tax area 
could no longer support a strong man teacher; the 
whole matter ending in retarded schools at the hands 
of underpaid and poorly prepared teachers. 
This policy in church and school was already causing 
disaster when another phenomenon came to be reckoned 
with, which in time has practically completed the work 
of retardation begun through misplaced zeal and exag- 
gerated ambition — this is the recent disintegration of 
country population and the moving away from the land. 
Recent Industrial Revolution. — The world-wide in- 
dustrial revolution which began in the eighteenth cen- 
tury with the invention of the spinning jenny and power 
loom, and the introduction of steam power, has since the 
Civil War all but changed our national make-up. In 
1790, only 3.4 per cent of the American people lived in 
cities, now just about one half of the nation dwell at 
the great industrial centers. The phenomenal growth 
of cities has indeed been coincident everywhere with 
growth in manufacturing industries. These latter have 
produced modern, labor-saving machinery for the farm, 
and have consequently reduced the demand for farm 
hands. Factory-made wares and cheap transportation 
i
-P-A-G-E-373
APPENDIX 329 
  have sounded the death knell of many local industries 
which in the olden time flourished at every crossroads. 
Rural craftsmen, their occupation gone, have flocked 
to the city. Farm hands, crowded out by the new 
machinery, have followed in the same path. The 
youth of the countryside — the strong young men and 
women who should furnish its intelligence and vigorous 
life — have, in large numbers, faced cityward, attracted 
by the glamor of city life and its many flattering oppor- 
tunities for advancement. Once the disintegration got 
under way, it continued to grow by sheer force of its 
own increasing momentum. The drift was at first 
purely economic in nature; subsequently every social 
organization in the country began to feel the pressure 
and to yield ground. Life in farm communities has 
gradually become shorn of many satisfactions, where 
such were at one time common. (People are moving 
to town because the rural church can no longer offer 
the spiritual uplift demanded by the human soul. They 
go because the rural school does not. offer.an adequate 
education. They go, finally, because social life there is 
barren and often unwholesome — with increasingly large 
farms in many sections — and this life has been getting 
more and more shorn of its possibilities in proportion 
as the isolation has increased. 
Vanishing Country Church. — For fear that the readers 
may not get the full purport of the statements made 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
  330 APPENDIX 
  above, some details may be offered — first, as regards 
the country church. A few years back the church was 
the “ meetinghouse ” for many social as well as the 
religious gatherings. Here the young folk began their 
courtship; here they were married; here their children 
were baptized; and here, finally, all were placed to 
rest, as testified by the leaning tombstones near many a 
weatherbeaten country church. It was bad enough in 
the early day to set up many churches where only a few 
were needed. Bad became worse as soon as the rural 
disintegration began. Churches, which had barely 
been able to keep open doors, were abandoned one by 
one until, in the year 1912, almost every state in the 
Union could count them by the hundreds. 
For one thing, a church which must devote all energy 
to keep its own organization alive can do little for the 
extension of the Kingdom. Besides, large numbers of 
such churches continue as constant drains on the Church 
Extension and Home Mission Boards of their several 
denominations. To illustrate: A rural life survey made 
a few years ago by the Board of Home Missions of the 
Presbyterian Church in the United States, of three coun- 
ties in northeastern Missouri, shows that the average 
church — rural and village — spends ninety-two cents 
out of every dollar collected to keep itself alive, seven 
cents for missions and Church Boards, and only one cent 
Sor local benevolence. Verily, is it not high time that we
-P-A-G-E-375
APPENDIX 331 
  apply some modern business sense to the country church 
organization! In the state of Missouri something like 
one thousand country churches have recently been aban- 
doned. With their doors and windows nailed up, they 
are crumbling in decay and becoming eyesores upon 
the landscape. The neighboring state of Illinois makes 
fully as bad a showing, and other states are faring no 
better. But the situation is not hopeless; it need not 
even mean that religious zeal in rural districts is materi- 
ally abating. Some country life surveys, indeed, show 
that in many sections the country folk are as funda- 
mentally religious as they ever were, though in others 
a disregard for church and Sabbath day is regrettably 
on the increase. 
Other Losses. — With the introduction of modern sys- 
tems of communication and better means of transporta- 
tion the shut-in condition of country communities has 
come to an end. They were opened to the world and 
became a part of the world; but the world at large has 
given in return much less than it took from the average 
farm community. In the old-time school there were the 
good, old-fashioned debating clubs and literary societies, 
spelling bees, and singing schools; of a more social- 
economic nature were the quiltings, the huskings, the 
barn raisings, and play parties of every kind. So far as 
all these activities are concerned, which in the olden time 
brought young and old together to partake of a natural, 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
    332 APPENDIX 
unconstrained social life, they have either been aban- 
doned altogether or are lingering in some denatured form. 
Neither village-dwelling preacher nor city-trained teacher 
knows how to give the country folk modern substitutes 
for their “lost arts”’; and the farmers lack leadership 
from their own ranks. 
Tenant Farming and Absentee Landlordism. — Even 
before the farm community had felt the call of the city 
and the beckoning of the West, land exploitation and 
land speculation were well under way. One of our 
greatest national sins is this disregard for the God-given 
soil and the way we plunder it. The soil should be 
sacred, but we do not comprehend that term. The era 
beginning with 1873 has been especially marked by land 
speculation, making well-nigh impossible a stable and 
permanent country community life. Holding the land 
only long enough to receive the coveted rise in market 
value and then moving on to newer lands has been the 
universal practice. Under such conditions “ home ” 
cannot have the true ring in the open country. But 
‘the greatest bane of our present agricultural transition, 
after all, is tenant farming and absentee landlord- 
ism. American landowners are moving to town, drawn 
thither by its educational, religious, and social attrac- 
tions. Here they add little to organized life, being 
naturally conservative and opposed to progressive enter- 
prise. The farms are left in the hands of tenants that
-P-A-G-E-377
APPENDIX 333 
generally “ skin ” the soil to death-in-their-efforts to 
meet the heavy rents. This suicidal system is gradually 
destroying our greatest natural resource —the soil. 
We are accustomed to think of Rome as falling before 
the onslaught of Goths and Germans; but in reality, 
Rome died by stages, as unwise tax policies obliged its 
peasantry to take crop after crop from the soil with- 
out power to restore the soil’s declining fertility. What 
is true of Rome is true of most of the one-time mighty 
empires of the East. Once their soil became debauched 
all else availed but little. 
OUR RURAL LIFE PROBLEM 
Now, just what is the rural life problem? What shall 
the solution be? These are questions that must be 
analyzed in all seriousness. 
What the Problem is Not. — To begin with, it may 
be said that the problem is not essentially a movement 
to draw a larger population to country districts. It is 
true that the country has suffered through the shift in 
population by moving to town and to newer farm regions. 
But the remedy is not to be sought in the so-called 
“ back-to-the-land”’ movement. This agitation is a 
city impulse, which if realized might help in a measure 
to solve the difficult problem of the city, without aiding 
the open country; or in many instances, making the 
difficulties of the latter still more complicated by dump- 
 
-P-A-G-E-378
334 APPENDIX 
ing upon our reserve farm lands an overflow population 
of defeated or impractical city people —a population 
which would chiefly add to the blind resignation and 
fatalism of which there is too much in country com- 
munities now. Of course, so far as “ rural-minded ” 
people can be found in the cities the country welcomes 
them; otherwise they should remain where they are. 
What we need on the farm to-day is not so much greatly 
increased numbers of producers as greatly enlarged 
‘production. This can never be realized from a flow of 
population from the city, for these people are, and 
nearly always will remain, “ city-minded.” 
What the Problem Is. — The call really is for a more 
" scientific agriculture, which shall render greater returns 
on expended efforts. Such an agricultural life will 
form the very foundation of all satisfactory living in 
the country. If farming communities can keep the 
rural population now there, and make farm life so 
attractive that the natural increase in population will 
be content to spend their lives as farmers, all will in the 
end be well with the country community. 
The problem resolves itself into a matter of outlook 
on life. There can be no lasting improvement until 
our farmers shall in some way attain a new and broader 
outlook on the real significance of farm life. The latter 
must be more than ‘a wearisome round of labor, of eat- 
ing and drinking, of saving and skimping, of doing with- 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
  APPENDIX 335 
out farm conveniences and household helps — solely 
to make money.’ The solution lies finally in our ability 
to keep in the open country a good, sound population 
with correct American ideals capable of scientific farm- 
ing; and, withal, content to live wholesome lives in close 
communion with the Almighty. 
The ultimate readjustment of the country community 
will have to come at the hands of the country folks 
themselves; but before the farming districts are able 
to produce this generation of strong men and women 
imbued with the spirit of masterful action, there are 
many obstacles to be overcome and much work to be 
done. Rural life to-day is what it is largely through 
city domination. It behooves, then, that the city lend 
a helping hand to this promising field for educators, 
social philosophers, philanthropists, and church workers 
of all kinds. 
General Factors in the Problem.—It is now time 
to make a brief statement of the general factors through 
which the present deficiencies of country life may reach 
a solution; but, in doing so, we must bear in mind that 
the rural life problem is to be treated as a united whole. 
An-attempt_to better some one-phaseof country life 
while ignoring the others will meet with failure. Thus, 
for example, it becomes. impractical to attempt the 
betterment of rural school conditions while ignoring 
the social and economic questions of the community, 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
      336 APPENDIX 
  or to improve country church life while holding aloof 
from participation in educational affairs — albeit these 
lie beyond the province of ordinary school and church 
practice. Educators and other workers to make head- 
way with the composite problem must be prepared to 
consider at least the factors which follow below. With- 
out a full understanding of all of these, their work in 
behalf of community betterment will be seriously 
curtailed. 
Isolation. — The most striking thing about country 
life is its comparative isolation. Men-are by nature 
gregarious. And where they are separated by relatively 
long distances, as in the average farm community, this 
is accomplished at the loss of a keener social existence. 
As a matter of fact, what the American farmer has 
gained in individualism, independence, and self-reliance, 
is more than~counterbalanced in a loss through social 
stagnation, } The power of suggestion which comes 
where many gather is enough to overcome the habits 
and conventions of the few and will save the individual 
from becoming narrow and introspective. ) Farm life 
tends toward the latter. a 
The country village — which is a part of the country 
community — suffers in much the same way. While 
not isolated in just the sense that the farm is, the power 
of suggestion in the few groups of families there gathered 
is insufficient to furnish a spirit of genuine codperation. 
     
-P-A-G-E-381
  
APPENDIX 337 
The result is that the country village partakes of some 
of the worst elements of farm life and a few of the worst 
of city life — it is neither truly individualistic nor codper- 
ative in spirit. 
Means of Communication. — This social stagnation 
may be remedied in several ways. First of mention 
comes a craving for better means of communication. 
With distance annihilated, much of the isolation will 
disappear. Here is a vast field of opportunity for the 
sincere worker. It is really unnecessary to mention 
the great good already done through the establishment 
of free rural delivery, the introduction of the rural tele- 
phone, the -building of better roads, and the extension 
of trolley lines into the country. But the one thing 
to emphasize is that the beginnings only have been made. 
Many farm communities, for instance, do not yet 
comprehend the meaning of “ good roads.” Here the 
example of such a social reformer as John Frederic 
Oberlin may well be emulated. This Lutheran clergy- 
man came as pastor to a poor mountain parish (Steinthal) 
on the border of Alsace-Lorraine, in 1767, and in a 
short time wrought great changes in the character and 
condition of his parishioners. But, let this be borne in 
mind, he began by building roads and bridges, laying 
the first stones with his own hands! Some of the most 
successful among country teachers, pastors, and Young

Recreation. — Greatly enlarged facilities for organized 
recreation of young and old alike are second to be con- 
sidered. Farm people do not take enough time for play 
and rest from labor. What is more, so much of the 
recreation that is common to country life is unwholesome, 
and is to a greater degree than the average man imagines 
given to bad practices and immoral suggestion. In 
early times we had the barn raising, the quilting, the 
husking bee, the singing school, and the folk dance. 
Since farm life has become systematized and reduced 
to soil tilling exclusively, too much of labor and drudgery 
has crept in, with too little time to live, to associate 
with one’s fellows. In many localities it means labor 
from starlight to starlight. The result is that great 
numbers of young men and young women with strongly 
developed social instincts have abandoned the country 
for the towns and cities, in search of things that country 
life as it exists denies them. The country towns and 
villages have responded to this very demand for recrea- 
tion which the open country has been unable to furnish, 
and are offering all comers a cheap, artificial amusement 
life, often quite immoral and vicious. Finally, where 
the livelong day is spent in work, an-outlet for the 
pent-up energy is sought on Sunday. Whether we 
like it or not, Sunday in the country has become a holi- —    
 
-P-A-G-E-383
APPENDIX 339 
day more than a holy day. Aside from the many really 
innocent pastimes summed up in neighborly calls and 
community gatherings on Sunday, this day is quite 
generally given over to baseball, horse racing, and, in 
some places, to carousals reflecting but little credit on 
an otherwise wholesome country life. 
A new kind of recreational life must be worked out 
through each of the great country institutions — the 
home, the school, and the church. Certain definite 
things are expected from the parents. The teacher will 
organize the play life of the school and even go so far 
as to interest the older youth and adults in many kinds 
of play life, athletics, and club work. In New York 
State and elsewhere entire counties are organized into 
annual play festivals, which include the old folks. 
The organized country Young Men’s Christian Asso- 
ciation is doing remarkable things for rural recreation 
in some sections. The Grange, which is the country 
people’s own social institution, and in the South the 
Farmer’s Union are accomplishing no little good 
where the orders are well established. But all this 
is just a beginning. Nowhere, it seems, is there greater 
opportunity for home mission work than here. Con- 
secrated men and women are needed to help foster 
the social instincts which are at this time necessary to 
bind together our over-individualistic country people 
for a fuller codperation and a more complete country life.

   The Farm Woman’s Lot. — These things can also be 
hastened by making the average farm woman’s lot more 
attractive than it is. She lives too much of a humdrum 
existence. Her little world is hemmed in by the limi- 
tations of the barn lot. In these respects her husband 
is more fortunate, since he is in touch with the outer 
world and thus acquires a world outlook. This is an 
unfortunate condition. The farm home cannot be 
raised socially until its mistress is given time to broaden 
her own life ideals. Labor-saving appliances and home 
conveniences are beginning to appear in some homes. 
These will relieve the woman from much of the old 
drudgery and allow time for acquaintanceship with her 
beautiful natural environment, which in all likelihood, 
she may never have known. It is, indeed, good for a 
working woman to enjoy a beautiful sunset occasionally, 
and to work among the flowers without having to worry 
about the potatoes and cabbages. Especially is it 
necessary that she shall have time to meet with others 
of her own sex, at the mothers’ meetings and the farm 
women’s clubs. Emancipate the country woman from 
her drudgery, and much that is sordid and unattractive 
in country life will pass away. City women, with 
their many opportunities for self-improvement, owe 
their country sisters a helping hand in this search 
after a fuller life.

become better organized than they are. Coéperative 
organizations of all kinds are imperative. “It is well 
enough to know how to produce the raw materials, 
but it is as important to know how to manufacture them 
and place them in the hands of the consumers at the 
smallest cost.’ Here is a fundamental weakness in our 
agricultural life. There must be more genuine coépera- 
tion in dairying, in poultry raising, in fruit culture, and 
in marketing. There must be buying and selling asso- 
ciations of many kinds. Unnecessary middlemen are 
to be eliminated, a condition which will mean that the 
farmer is to get more for his products and the consumer is 
to pay less. Such organizations are especially needed to 
advance social, educational, and ethical interests. Pub- 
lic gatherings, festival days, literary clubs, reading clubs, 
public health-societies, and the like fall under this-head. 
City life is highly organized; country life is generally 
unorganized. Organization is a test of efficiency. 
The country community must be taught the wisdom of 
this. 
There are now left for discussion two great institu- 
tions, the school and the church. Of these the school 
comes in for first mention. 
The Rural School a Prominent Factor.—The school 
has had its face toward the city, drawing therefrom its 
sentiments, its teachers, and its course of study. It 
has broken the fundamental law: that any form of 
 
-P-A-G-E-388
342 APPENDIX 
education, to be effective, must.reflect.the daily life and 
interests of the community employing it. Our country 
schools must offer an agricultural education; that is, 
must prepare for satisfactory agricultural life. This 
has not been done. “ And,” says Mr. Roosevelt’s 
Commission on Country Life, “the schools are held 
largely responsible for ineffective farming, lack of ideals, 
and the drift to town.” The task nowis to put the school 
in harmony with the needs of present-day life. This 
means that several important changes must be brought 
about : 
(x) There must be a thorough redirection of the sub- 
ject matter taught in the school; (2) there must be a 
general reorganization of the entire working staff of 
school boards, superintendents, and teachers; (3) the 
entire school plant must be rebuilt; and (4) education 
must be carried into the farm home through various 
kinds of extension courses. Lack of space forbids a 
detailed exposition of the above statements. Briefly 
then: throughout the length and breadth of our land 
are scattered thousands of weak one-teacher schools — 
schools which were good enough in the days of early 
land exploitation. With the shifting of population 
they have become small and weak, poorly taught, and 
poorly paid. They have become “ retarded” and are 
now no longer able to cope with our new agricultural 
conditions. In some sections these small schools must 
 
-P-A-G-E-389
APPENDIX 
  ' persist indefinitely, chiefly on account of geographical ~ 
reasons. Here the most will have to be made of a 
bad situation by providing good, well-trained and well- 
paid teachers, who understand present-day country 
needs, and who, withal, have the right vision of the new 
country life. 
But the movement, now beginning to spread across 
the continent, as stated in the body of the book, 
contemplates the consolidation of the many weakling 
schools in a few, centrally located, graded farmers’ 
schools. Such schools, offering eight grades of ele- 
mentary, work, together with from one to four years of 
high school work, are springing up by the thousands, 
a single state alone counting as many as six hundred. 
The new school will do for the country community 
what the old was incapable of doing; namely, train the. 
boys to become scientific farmers and the girls practical 
farmers’ helpmeets. It is beginning to inculcate a 
wholesome love for country life, and may be expected 
to .counteract.the..townward exodus. But more — 
from this school must come many impulses to organize 
the country people on a more permanent social and 
economic basis. It. will become the center of much 
community interest to be shared by it with the new 
social service church. 
Rural Church Reconstruction. — Overchurching and 
denominational rivalry aided by the shift in population, 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
    344 APPENDIX 
have brought the country church face to face with a 
crisis. If the church were to surrender its leadership 
at this time, when so much is at stake, it would cause 
little short of a calamity. The strong young men and 
women of correct vision and initiative who are to set 
up new standards of living in the country community 
should acquire their preparation under the inspiration 
and guidance of religious motives. The tendency of 
the day is to reduce everything to worldly standards. 
The church has been the saving force in the habits and 
moral conduct of country people; it must ever con- 
tinue as such.| But the church stands not alone for 
ethical idealism —it stands for esthetical idealism as 
well. The school may teach a love of nature in its 
pupils and then lead them to a love of nature’s God. 
The church, on the other hand, teaches its membership 
that the bounties and wonders of nature are the handi- 
work of God, and through him they learn to live in the 
closest communion with the wonders of nature round 
about them. 
Interdenominational Cotiperation, The call must 
now go out to.all denominations for codperation in be- 
half of the country church.) Thoughtful Christians must 
prepare to lay aside docttinal differences, ancient preju- 
dices, and denominational sentiment, and meet on the 
common ground of faith in one God. Thoroughgoing 
reorganization coming from within the several denomi-

All the pastors in rural Denmark live in the midst of their flocks, where they 
can minister to the needs of the people all the time, and so become 
leaders in both spiritual and temporal matters.

nations, together with harmonious coéperation between 
denominations are probably the means through which 
the solution must come. 
Conclusion. — In the body of this book has been told 
the story of the rebirth of Danish agricultural life. 
The place of education in the great rehabilitation has 
been clearly set forth. Without the work of the schools 
the great tasks inspired at a time of distress could not 
have been carried to the successful fruition that they have 
been. In the United States, the future of agricultural 
life must depend in a large measure on the leadership 
from ‘within the ranks of the agriculturists themselves. 
Just how broad, how strong this guiding force of 
the future shall become, will rest upon the successful 
reorganization of the American rural schools, rural 
churches, and their kindred organizations.

    ' 20 THE, ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
12. Maintained sixty-eight fellows and scholars from the 
United States, China, and Brazil who were studying 
at American medical schools; 
13. Supported studies in mental hygiene; 
14. Continued appropriations for the after-care of infantile 
paralysis cases; 
15. Made additional gifts to the Rockefeller Institute for 
‘Medical Research; 
16. Lent for various services expert members of the 
Foundation’s staff; 
17. Brought its studies in industrial relations to an end; 
18. Made surveys for the American Red Cross and for the 
American Social Hygiene Association. 
In addition to these more characteristic activi- 
ties of the Foundation, appropriations in ful- 
fillment of pledges were made to a number of 
organizations whose work does not lie directly 
in the fields of public health, medical education, 
or war service. (For a complete list of appro- 
priations for 1918, see pages 69-71, and the 
detailed report of the Treasurer.) 
WHY SHOULD AMERICA TRY TO TEACH 
FRANCE ABOUT TUBERCULOSIS? 
It may well be asked whether it was not 
presumptuous for Americans to go crusading 
against tuberculosis in the land of Louis Pasteur. 
Was there any justification for sending a Com- 
mission overseas, save the fact that France, 
sorely pressed by war, could spare neither per-
-P-A-G-E-19
  
PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 21 
sonnel nor resources for a fight against the white 
plague? When, in July, 1917, Dr. Livingston 
Farrand and his colleagues of the Foundation’s 
Commission for the Prevention of Tuberculosis 
in France reached Paris and began their survey 
of the field, they found already in existence 
examples of almost every kind of agency known 
to modern medicine and public health adminis- 
tration as effective in combating consumption. 
French scientific men understood the theory 
of tuberculosis and the principles which underlie 
the control of it. In the Leon Bourgeois dispen- 
sary in Paris were to be found the essential fea- © 
tures of an efficient diagnostic and out-patient 
clinic: a well-planned and adequately equipped 
building, the leadership of an expert director, a 
staff of laboratory and clinical assistants, a 
group of visiting nurses, a training center for 
these functionaries, daily sessions for patients, 
and free public lectures on the nature of the 
disease and the best ways of guarding against it. 
In one sense, the Americans had nothing to teach 
the French about the organization and admin- 
istration of a tuberculosis dispensary. 
Another fundamental institution in the con- 
trol of tuberculosis is the sanatorium. With 
respect to this the French had little if anything 
to learn. For example, the sanatorium at 
Bligny, thirty miles south of Paris, is said to be  
-P-A-G-E-20
  22 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION - 
equaled by few and surpassed by only one bi 
two American institutions of this sort. Its 
tastefully designed fire-proof buildings, situated 
in spacious and beautiful grounds, afford accom- 
modations to 600 patients. ‘The scientific and 
other equipment is thoroughly modern. Ample 
sun porches, pleasant walks, opportunities for 
simple games and for gardening, are provided. 
The Director is a recognized specialist who adds 
to expert knowledge, unusual administrative 
capacity and a fine devotion to his life work. 
The daily per capita cost in pre-war days was 
3.85 francs; in May, 1918, this had risen to 5.65 
francs. Apparently Americans had more to 
learn than to teach at Bligny. 
In the organization of local committees, in 
relief measures, in issuing literature and in carry- 
ing on educational work, in Government provi- 
sion for tuberculous soldiers, in setting apart 
hospital beds, and in other ways, much was being 
done in France when the American Commission 
arrived. It soon became apparent, however, 
that these various institutions and activities 
were few in number, isolated, almost unrelated. 
In France ideas do not spread rapidly by imita- 
tion as they do in:the United States. There are 
few French national organizations which can 
quickly inform every community of what is being 
done in every other. The ‘“‘boosting”’ spirit is
-P-A-G-E-21
  PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 23 
largely lacking in the Gallic character. Individ- 
ualism, both personal and of the group or com- 
munity, is a dominant influence. Thus, there 
was no efficient, co-operative, centralized organ- 
ization among French agencies for a united, 
comprehensive attack on tuberculosis. 
TEAM-PLAY AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS 
The American contribution, then, has been a 
demonstration of organized team-play. Only as 
dispensaries, hospitals, sanatoria, preventoria, 
open-air schools, home supervision by visiting 
nurses, relief, extra food, educational campaigns, 
committees, and government officials are all 
fitted into a co-operative and unified system, can 
really effective results be secured. The Commis- 
sion for the Prevention of Tuberculosis of the 
Rockefeller Foundation and the Tuberculosis 
Bureau of the American Red Cross set them- 
selves the task of demonstrating to the French 
people the possibilities of such team-play. In 
their own relations these two organizations af- 
forded a striking example of the thing they 
urged upon others. The Nineteenth Arrondisse- 
ment in Paris and the Department of Eure-et- 
Loir of the provinces were selected for intensive 
organization of the essential agencies of tuber- 
culosis control. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  24 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Four dispensaries were planned for the Arron- 
dissement, three of these being opened and in 
operation before the end of 1918. Groups of 
nurses, or visiteuses a hygiene, attached to these 
centers visited patients in their homes. The Red 
Cross provided extra hospital wards, opened 
sanatoria and preventoria in the suburbs, and 
supplied food and clothing to needy sufferers 
from tuberculosis. ‘Thus, elements relatively 
ineffective when isolated were combined into a 
mutually re-enforcing co-operation. As it turned 
out, the undertaking did more than demonstrate 
the possibilities of public health progress. Dur- 
ing the dark days of April, May, and June, 1918, 
when air-raids were frequent and the long-range 
gun was dropping many shells in the Nineteenth 
Arrondissement, the French and American nurses 
went their daily rounds, calm, cheerful symbols 
of normality and quiet courage among the panic- 
stricken workers and the harassed refugees who 
crowded that quarter of Paris. These noble 
women did much to combat tuberculosis, but 
they did infinitely more to dispel fear and to 
maintain morale. 
During 1918 four central dispensaries and six 
secondary centers were opened in the Depart- 
ment of Eure-et-Loir. Another six were nearly 
completed, and seven others were located for 
future development. It is expected that by
-P-A-G-E-23
PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 25 
July, 1919, the twenty-three called for in the 
program will be in operation. In the chief 
towns the French have set aside hospital beds 
for the use of the Commission, a sanatorium is 
being prepared near Dreux, and a day camp is 
available north of Chateaudun. The French 
authorities and the local committees are co-op- 
erating heartily in securing facilities, and as the 
Red Cross withdraws will assume increasing 
responsibility for relief work, the provision of ex- 
tra food, etc. A: systematic campaign of educa- 
tion has been carried on throughout the area, so 
that no family, however remote, has been wholly 
untouched by this attempt to organize a typical 
provincial department for a public health crusade. 
In increasing numbers, public officials and com- 
mittee representatives from all parts of France 
are visiting Paris and Eure-et-Loir to see what 
American methods are accomplishing in actual 
operation. 
TRAINING LES VISITEUSES D’HYGIENE 
When the Commission was organized in 1917, 
one of the problems was to find public health 
nurses who were familiar with tuberculosis work 
and who could speak French fluently. Fortu- 
nately, a group of exceptionally able and loyal 
American nurses was secured. Their services
-P-A-G-E-24
«yg gpa eas i: has 5s gaa a ek 
26 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION | 
have contributed in a notable way to the success 
of the undertaking. But it was soon evident that 
reliance must more and more be placed upon 
the training of a French personnel. One of the 
first tasks, therefore, was to provide centers in 
Paris in which could be organized special courses 
consisting of lectures, clinics, hospital and sana- 
torium experience, and field work in visiting 
patients in their homes. French and American 
physicians were engaged as instructors, oppor- 
tunities of the essential kind were secured, and 
bourses, or scholarships, of 150 francs per month, 
were offered. French women of a satisfactory 
type responded in gratifying numbers. About 
seventy were enrolled by the spring of 1918. At 
the end of the year, forty-five nurses were in the 
service of the Commission and fifty-six others 
were in training—forty-five in three centers and 
four dispensaries in Paris, seven at a new school 
in Bordeaux, and four in Lyons. An additional 
training center had been opened in Nantes. All 
of the fifty-six pupil nurses were receiving schol- 
arships from the Commission. With the organ- 
ization of local committees throughout France 
the demand for visiteuses dhygiene is growing. 
‘Training centers on the model of those in Paris 
are likely to multiply in the near future. It is 
worth noting that the Commission did not seek 
to attract French nurses by offering them higher  
-P-A-G-E-25
PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 27 
salaries than they had been accustomed to re- 
ceive from various other institutions and socie- 
ties. Instead, it used its good offices with the 
other agencies to have each of them increase its 
salary scale for nurses. In this way the different 
organizations gave an effective example of team- 
play. 
THE MEDICINAL “TANK”: ITS CREW AND 
ITS AMMUNITION 
“Do you know the Medicinal Tank?” asks a writer in 
Le Matin of November 30, 1918. “It is an invention of 
the Rockefeller Foundation. This tank rolls over the 
roads of France, bearing signboards. . . . Behold 
this tank entering a city—or a village. It does not come 
unannounced . . . a delegate arrives. He pays 
visits to all the newspapers and to the municipal, military, 
prefectoral, and religious authorities. . . . The Mayor 
offers a free hall to the impresario—I mean the delegate. 
After the hall has been obtained the delegate covers the 
city with posters. And such posters! Barnum and 
Bailey would not be ashamed of them. . . . The 
legends and designs make people laugh. They gather in a 
circle, they are amused, and—instructed. 
“In the meantime a train at the station discharges a 
gentleman lecturer and a lady lecturer. These are 
accompanied by another lady, the ‘demonstrator,’ whose 
task it is to comment on the posters in the exposition room. 
Finally the automobile truck appears. 
“The directors of the ‘International Department of 
Hygiene’ of the Rockefeller Foundation are aware that

even the best article does not sell unless you ‘hit the 
nail on the head.’ Possessors of that excellent though 
neglected commodity known as truth, they find that 
public education is necessary in spreading it, and that 
this, after all, consists in nothing more than applying the 
art of advertising to the facts of science. This is their 
harangue brought to us by posters and cinema: 
“*Nlo one, O Frenchmen, has excelled you in the scientific 
study of tuberculosis. But it is not enough that your 
scientists combat this disease; each one of you must take 
part in the battle, must benefit from the knowledge 
acquired, and perform in his turn the office of edu- 
cator. . . . Why do you give your patronage to 
charlatans? Because they advertise. We have taken 
advertising away from them and use it in the interests 
of science. You think of tuberculosis only after you 
have it. We are going to make you think of it all the 
' time so that you may protect yourself against its inva- 
sion. . . This way, this way, follow the crowd. 
We put medicine within the reach of little children. This 
way, this way, tell us what you prefer, moving pictures 
or the hospital. Our show saves you from the hospital. 
We are advertising public health.’ ” 
There is little to add to this clever description 
of the educational campaign of the Commission. 
During 1918 three traveling exhibits and groups 
of lecturers visited ten departments, and in 141 
towns of 3,000 or more population gave 875 lec- 
tures with demonstrations and exhibits. In the 
same period 2,115,708 pieces of printed matter, 
posters, pamphlets, post-cards, and games, were
-P-A-G-E-27
PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 29 
widely distributed throughout the whole of 
France. A series of twenty-four articles on tuber- 
culosis appeared in thirty-three important pro- 
vincial newspapers. The Commission’s publicity 
material, written by French men and women, 
and charmingly illustrated by French artists, 
has set a new standard for popular public health 
education. 
TURNING THE SYSTEM OVER TO THE FRENCH 
A campaign of extension has reached twenty- 
seven departments. Representatives of the 
Commission and of the American Red Cross 
have visited leading towns and cities in a sys- 
tematic effort to organize local committees and to 
induce these groups to establish dispensaries as 
the first step toward a complete plan for the con- 
trol of tuberculosis. In the twenty-seven depart- 
ments, at the time of the first visit, twenty-one 
dispensaries were already in existence. By the 
end of the year fifty-seven new dispensaries had 
been opened, twenty other dispensaries were in 
process of installation, and plans for forty-nine 
more had been definitely made. Besides these 
dispensaries, fifteen laboratories were arranged 
for, thirty-eight new nurses installed, and forty- 
two new and active committees organized. It is 
important to remember that almost all of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-28
30 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION | 
expense, not only for the creation but for the 
maintenance of these activities, is borne by 
the French themselves. Plans are on foot for 
the establishment by the French of a complete 
system of dispensaries for the Region du Nord, 
which comprises the five departments recently 
re-occupied by the Allies and restored to France. 
Urgent requests are coming from many parts of 
the country for co-operation in organizing tuber- 
culosis work. 
Allusion has already been made to progress in 
the training of French nurses. It is equally 
gratifying to report that physicians are showing 
a keen and intelligent interest in the plans of the 
Commission. Arrangements have been made to 
bring a group of these men to the United States, 
and to afford them an opportunity to observe 
American institutions and methods. It is ex- 
pected that in this way leadership will be pro- 
vided for the assumption in France of rapidly 
increasing responsibility for the campaign. 
Local societies and committees which have co- 
operated so cordially with the Commission are 
apparently ready to do their part, while govern- 
ment officials have expressed the hope that a 
new ministry of health may be created which 
will take over the central supervision of the 
machinery that is being set up. “Within a reason- 
able time, therefore, the Foundation expects to
-P-A-G-E-29
PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 31 
withdraw, confident that the work will go on 
until a nation-wide system for combating tuber- 
culosis has become a permanent part of the 
policy of France. 
CHEAPER TO GET RID OF MALARIA THAN 
TO HAVE IT 
The demonstrations begun in 1916 to test the 
possibilities of ridding a community of malaria, 
were continued during 1918. In four towns in 
Arkansas, anti-mosquito measures were carried 
out with marked success. By draining or filling 
pools, by ditching sluggish streams, and by oiling 
surface water which could not be otherwise dealt 
with, the breeding of the anopheles (malaria- 
carrying) mosquito was almost wholly prevented. 
Thus the sole means by which malaria can be 
transmitted was eliminated. ‘The results, as 
tested by the number of calls made by physicians 
on persons who were suffering from the disease, 
were striking. In Hamburg, Arkansas, the num- 
ber of calls fell from 2,312 in 1916 to 259 in 1917, 
and to 59 in 1918, a reduction for the period of 
97.4 per cent. The per capita cost for 1917 was 
$1.45; for 1918 it was only 44 cents. In four 
other communities the percentage of reduction 
varied from 94.8 per cent to 78.4 per cent, while 
the per capita costs ranged from $1.25 to 46 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
32 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
cents. In the computation of per capita costs 
the overhead expenses of supervision by repre- 
sentatives of the Board haye not been included. 
One could not ask for more convincing proofs 
that a community may rid itself of malaria on 
terms which cannot be wisely rejected. It is not 
surprising that towns and villages are making 
appropriations faster than trained sanitarians 
can be found to undertake the work of malaria 
control. 
There are regions in which the anti-mosquito 
program cannot be successfully carried out be- 
cause: surface waters cannot be controlled. In 
such cases another method of attack must be 
adopted: the individuals who harbor malaria 
germs in their blood must be discovered and 
treated. In Sunflower County, Mississippi, the 
Foundation’s International Health Board, guided 
by previous experiments in another county in 
the same state, undertook a demonstration 
which aimed at curing the “carriers” of malaria. 
In this way the mosquito was given no opportu- 
nity to receive the infective organism, and there- 
fore no opportunity to transmit it to others. It 
is believed that in the rural area a malaria con- 
trol of 80 per cent was secured.. For the whole 
region of about 100 square miles, with a popula- 
tion of 1,000 in the town and 8,000 on the plan- 
tations in the country, a large measure of control
-P-A-G-E-31
  PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 33 
was brought about at an initial per capita cost of 
$1.08. The manager of one plantation, which 
has a tenant population of 600, estimates that 
for the past ten years the doctors’ bills formalaria 
in this group have averaged $3,000 per year, or 
$5 per capita. But, of course, doctors’ bills are 
the least of the items in the total cost of malaria 
to a community. These demonstrations have 
left no room for doubt. Malaria elimination is 
feasible, scientifically and economically; it repre- 
sents a striking contribution to community 
progress and human happiness. 
STATES UNDERTAKING MALARIA CONTROL 
A constant aim of the International Health 
Board is to turn over to government agencies, 
public health activities which have been demon- 
strated to be effective. ‘The anti-malaria cam- 
paigns in Arkansas and Mississippi, following an 
initial experiment begun under the auspices of 
the U. S. Public Health Service, have been car- 
ried out in closest co-operation with the Health 
Boards of these states. It is a source of satis- 
faction that the state authorities in Arkansas 
have decided to create a special division to deal 
with malaria control. The Legislature has be- 
fore it a bill which sanctions this arrangement 
and provides public funds for co-operation with ‘ i
-P-A-G-E-32
  34 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
communities throughout the state in a concerted 
movement to rid the entire commonwealth of 
malaria. The measures of control will be based 
upon the demonstrations conducted under the 
auspices of the International Health Board, and 
also upon the results which the U. S. Public 
Health Service has secured in sanitating, on a 
large scale, the zones surrounding certain of the 
army cantonments and camps. 
A forward movement is also under way in 
Mississippi. In 1919 the demonstration described 
above will be extended to the whole of Sunflower 
County, which will bear one-half the expense. 
The State Board of Health is deeply interested 
and is carrying on the work under its own aus- 
pices. If the large-scale experiment proves suc- 
cessful, there is every reason to expect that in 
the early future the state will assume entire 
responsibility for a state-wide and persistent 
effort to eliminate malaria. Among the signifi- 
cant features of the enlarged plans for the Sun- 
flower County demonstration are striking post- 
ers, popularly written and illustrated pamphlets, 
newspaper articles, instruction in the schools, 
public lectures, and the sale of standardized 
quinine at low rates by all druggists. It has even 
been suggested that all individuals who are 
found free from malaria germs be given buttons 
as badges of immunity.

PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 35 
ATTACKING THE SEED-BEDS OF YELLOW 
FEVER 
General William C. Gorgas, on his retirement 
from the office of Surgeon General of the United 
States Army, in November, 1918, became Direc- 
tor of the Yellow Fever Work of the International 
Health Board, with freedom to carry out the 
recommendations of the Special Yellow Fever 
Commission of which, in 1916, he was the chief. 
The program called for the determination of the 
seed-beds of yellow fever, and for systematic 
attempts to destroy the disease at its sources. 
To this work General Gorgas immediately ad- 
dressed himself. Before the end of 1918 he had 
set out upon a preliminary journey to Central 
America. 
A yellow fever epidemic was reported in Guate- 
mala in June, 1918. In view of the large concen- 
trations of United States troops near Southern 
ports, the existence of an uncontrolled epidemic 
so near the border was regarded by the Surgeon 
General of the Army and by the United States 
Public Health Service as a menace calling for 
energetic measures. After consultation with the 
Guatemalan Minister in Washington, the Inter- 
national Health Board tendered its services to 
the President of the Republic, and offered to send 
a competent medical officer, with funds, to co-
-P-A-G-E-34
  36 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
operate in bringing the epidemic under control. 
This offer was promptly accepted, and on July 
11, 1918, Dr. Joseph H. White, released from the 
Army and granted leave by the Public Health 
Service, sailed for Guatemala. He was cor- 
dially received, granted full authority, and given 
necessary aid. Quarantine was established, 
physicians were drafted into service, and all 
well-tested measures for the control of yellow 
fever were promptly put into effect. The epi- 
demic was brought under control, so that when, 
on September 19, the expiration of his leave com- 
pelled Dr. White to return, infection was left 
at only one point. The resident representative 
of the Board took charge and continued appro- 
priate measures. On December 4 he reported 
that no yellow fever remained in Guatemala. 
The diagnosis of yellow fever is a difficult task. 
Some of the symptoms closely resemble those of 
other diseases, notably infectious jaundice. The 
germ of yellow fever has never been identified, so 
that laboratory tests cannot be used to determine 
the presence of the malady. In order that first- 
hand studies and investigations might be made 
in the field, a commission of five men, with labo- 
ratory equipment, was sent to Guayaquil, Ecua- 
dor, in June, 1918, for a stay of two months. As 
a result of this trip, important information was 
secured with respect to the sanitary conditions
-P-A-G-E-35
PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 37 
in Ecuador and concerning the bacteriological, 
chemical, and clinical aspects of yellow fever. 
Measures for the control of yellow fever in 
the city of Guayaquil were actively inaugurated 
on November 27, 1918. These measures are 
being conducted with the hearty co-operation of 
the Government of Ecuador and of the munici- 
pality. The attack is being directed against the 
stegomyia mosquito by which alone yellow fever 
can be communicated. At the end of December, 
125 men, divided into squads of five men each, 
were systematically at work in the city of Guay- 
aquil. It is hoped that measurable results in the 
reduction of infection will be disclosed in the near 
future. Yellow fever is being pressed further and 
further into isolated areas. This seems to be one 
disease which by persistent activity may be 
brought completely under control. 
PROGRESS IN CONTROL AND PREVENTION OF 
HOOKWORM INFECTION 
By far the most extensive work of the Inter- 
national Health Board has to do with this intes- 
tinal infection, which prevails in almost all 
tropical and semi-tropical lands, in the Southern 
States of America, and in the mining districts 
of several European countries. The policy of 
the Board is to work only in co-operation with
-P-A-G-E-36
38 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Governments, and to turn the undertaking over 
to public control as soon as possible after a suc- 
cessful demonstration has been made. The usual 
program of procedure includes: (1) an infection 
survey to determine the prevalence of the disease; 
(2) an intensive demonstration of treatment to 
cure the victims of the malady, together with (3) 
a campaign of popular education as to the nature, 
control, and prevention of hookworm disease; 
and (4) a persistent effort to secure the provision 
of proper sanitary facilities and regulations by 
which alone the pollution of the soil and the re- 
infection of the population can be avoided. 
Work for the relief and control of hookworm 
disease was conducted during 1918 in co-opera- 
tion with twelve states in the United States and 
with twenty-one foreign states and countries. 
Infection surveys were completed in the State 
of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in Jamaica, and in Guam. 
New work was undertaken in Queensland, Aus- 
tralia, and in Minas Geraes, Brazil. Of several 
invitations to begin new co-operative work it was 
possible to accept only one, that of the Madras 
Government of India. As a result of the demon- 
strations of the Board, a nurmber of Govern- 
ments, quite on their own account, have inaugu- 
rated hookworm control measures. In Ceylon, 
gratifying progress is reported in hookworm 
control, in sanitation, and in the training of a
-P-A-G-E-37
PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 39 
native medical staff. Siam is planning to extend 
its work and to increase appropriations. The 
survey of the United States Pacific Island of 
Guam disclosed an infection of 71 per cent, but 
of a mild type. Jamaica, after a survey, has 
undertaken appropriate measures. Distinct ad- 
vances in sanitation and the compulsory instal- 
lation of latrines were reported from Ceylon, 
Queensland, Brazil, the Seychelles Islands, Siam, 
the West Indies. The control and sanitary pro- 
gram being carried out in the Pinghsiang Col- 
liery in China is a most encouraging evidence of 
what a carefully conducted demonstration can 
accomplish. 
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN BRAZIL AND 
AUSTRALIA 
While the relief of large populations from the 
limitations and suffering which are consequent 
upon hookworm disease is in itself a highly im- 
portant aim, the International Health Board has 
always regarded its hookworm demonstrations 
as a means to an even larger end, namely, the es- 
tablishment of inclusive Public Health Services 
capable of dealing with all aspects of public 
health for a community, a state, or a nation. 
For this reason, two developments during 1918 
have been welcomed with especial satisfaction. 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
  40 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Several of the states of Brazil have taken up 
hookworm campaigns energetically in co-op- 
eration with the Board. The movement has 
gained momentum because the Federal Govern- 
ment has made large appropriations for subsidiz- 
ing the efforts of the various states. In order to 
further this nation-wide program, the Interna- 
tional Health Board has largely increased its 
contributions, and has lent a specialist to make, 
under Federal auspices, a survey of rural 
health problems for the whole of Brazil. The 
bearing of all this upon the development of 
public health administration in that country is 
obvious. 
A hookworm survey of Papua and of a region 
in Queensland has led to unexpected develop- 
ments. The authorities, both of Queensland and 
of the Federal Government of Australia, have 
shown deep interest. They have proposed a 
five-year period of co-operation in carrying out 
for Queensland and for Papua a program of 
rural sanitation in which hookworm control is to 
play a leading, but not an exclusive, rdle. The 
Board will contribute the services of an expert 
sanitarian and appropriate a fairly large an- 
nual sum at the outset. This will decrease 
by 20 per cent annually, until at the end of 
the period the entire expense will be borne by 
Australia.

PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 41 
A NEW SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND PUBLIC 
HEALTH 
In October, 1918, the School of Hygiene and 
Public Health, made possible by gifts from the 
Rockefeller Foundation for building, equipment, 
and maintenance, was opened under the auspices 
of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. A 
former physics laboratory, temporarily prepared 
for the purpose, afforded reasonably satisfactory 
quarters. The erection of a permanent building 
is contemplated in the early future. Because of 
war conditions the initial enrolment was not 
large. Seventeen students were in attendance 
during the first semester. It is expected that the 
number will rapidly increase. The demand for 
public health functionaries has been stimulated 
by the war and by the prospective needs of 
peace. The Foundation’s interest in preventive 
medicine and the conviction that a trained per- 
sonnel is an essential condition of progress have 
led to the establishment of this institution. 
The new school will not only provide thorough 
courses in the fundamental chemical, biological, 
and medical subjects in their many specialized 
phases, but will lay stress upon vital statistics, 
upon sanitary engineering, upon the sociological 
aspects of public health, upon community sur- 
veys, and upon the technique of administration.
-P-A-G-E-40
    42 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
It is significant of the new attitude of preventive 
medicine that from the outset attention is being 
given to the problems of nutrition. It is proposed 
to work out basic standards of food for human 
beings under various conditions. Prevention is 
being more and more positively interpreted into 
a better standard of living, in terms of working 
conditions, housing, food, exercise, recreation, 
sociability, and happiness. The field of indus- 
trial hygiene has great possibilities. Studies of 
fatigue, of occupational diseases, of light and 
ventilation, of medical care of employes, etc., are 
opening new vistas. 
FUTURE PLANS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND 
MEDICAL EDUCATION 
The past activities of the Foundation, includ- 
ing certain war-time experiences, have led, during 
the year, to the consideration of plans and poli- 
cies for the future. The coming of physicians and 
medical students from Brazil, from China, from 
France, on Foundation fellowships, to pursue 
courses in leading medical schools of the United 
States, and the necessity of furnishing accurate 
information to these men and women, have 
suggested the importance of gathering data with 
respect to the personnel, equipment, and re- 
sources of such American institutions.
-P-A-G-E-41
  
PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 43 
Successful demonstrations with hookworm and 
malaria have raised the question as to whether 
more comprehensive surveys and programs may 
not be carried out in co-operation with local 
officials and voluntary societies in typical urban 
and rural communities. 
Significant progress in such undertakings is 
reported from North Carolina. In nine counties, 
three-year programs have been inaugurated 
which make definite attacks upon the more im- 
portant public health problems, such as soil 
pollution and its attendant diseases, typhoid 
fever, infant diarrhea, dysentery, and hook- 
worm. The medical inspection and treatment of 
school children, the quarantine of infectious 
diseases, the prevention of tuberculosis, and 
work for infant welfare, are also included in the 
plan, which is supported by the combined con- 
tributions of the State, the counties, and the 
International Health Board. The administra- 
tion of these campaigns is unified under the 
leadership of the State Board of Health. Several 
other counties have undertaken similar programs 
on their own initiative. 
The problem of the functions and the appro- 
priate training of the public health nurse has 
been raised by a number of applications for 
Foundation aid. It was deemed wise to call a 
conference of the leading groups which are con- 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
  44 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
cerned with this question. As a result of such a 
meeting, held in December, 1918, a special com- 
mittee was appointed to study the situation and 
to make recommendations. In view of the Foun- 
dation’s special concern with the field of prevent- 
ive medicine, it has been decided systematically 
to collect information about public health organ- 
ization and procedure in the leading countries 
of the world. It is proposed gradually to extend 
the policy already begun in Brazil,—of helping 
to establish new departments or of strengthening 
existing courses in public health and medicine 
in certain universities in countries where the 
Foundation is at work. Another plan is to at- 
tach to the central staff of the International 
Health Board, one or more trained public health 
laboratory experts whose services may be put 
at the disposal of state or municipal boards of 
health which desire aid in extending and im- - 
proving their public laboratory service. 
THE “GREEN CITY” IN PEKING 
Work on the fifteen buildings of the Peking 
Union Medical College, which are being con- 
~ structed under the auspices of the China Medical 
Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, has gone 
steadily forward during 1918. There have been 
inevitable delays due to difficulty in securing
-P-A-G-E-43
PRESIDENT’ S REVIEW 45 
materials from the United States. Costs have 
increased enormously, not only because of war 
prices, but by reason of most unfavorable rates 
of exchange. Nevertheless the progress has been 
encouraging. The Chinese laborers take kindly 
to American building methods. The re-enforced 
concrete construction which was employed was a 
welcome novelty. The use of woodworking 
machinery has aroused much interest. The 
turning out of uniform sash, doors, window 
frames, etc., was a new idea to a people accus- 
tomed to hand work, whose nearest synonym for 
identical is “‘not so very different.” Because 
glazed green tiles are being used to cover the high 
Chinese-like roofs of the new buildings, the 
people have already named the group “The 
Green City.” 
The pre-medical school which opened in 1917 
with eight pupils, increased its enrolment in 1918 
to seventeen. The quality of these students is 
reported to be exceptionally promising. Addi- 
tions to the faculty of the medical school were 
made during the year, until, by the end of Decem- 
ber, thirty-four men and women were under 
appointment to the staff proper. Of these, 
twenty-three were already in Peking. In addi- 
tion, a number of lesser appointments have been 
made. Laboratory facilities will be available 
for work in the autumn of 1919, but the new 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  46 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
hospital wards probably will not be ready until 
a year later. Meantime an old hospital of lim- 
ited capacity is being operated. Before the end 
of 1920 it is hoped that the new plant will be 
finished, and that the work of the most com- 
pletely equipped and adequately manned center 
of medical research and teaching in China will 
be auspiciously under way. 
MEDICAL EDUCATION IN CHINA AND SOUTH 
AMERICA 
The program of the China Medical Board in- 
cludes, in addition to the Peking medical center, 
another at Shanghai. The building of this has 
been deferred for a time because of war condi- 
tions and high costs of construction. The Board 
during 1918 gave aid to three medical schools and 
to nineteen hospitals which are conducted in 
China under the auspices of several missionary 
boards. In this way a total sum of $181,235 was 
expended. The purpose of these appropriations 
was to strengthen teaching centers and to pro- 
vide better equipment and a larger personnel for 
hospitals. It has seemed wise, during the period 
preceding the opening of the new medical school 
at Peking, to co-operate with a considerable num- 
ber of institutions, but it is probable that in the 
future the China Medical Board-will adopt the 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 47 
policy of concentrating its subsidies upon a few 
significant and strategic centers. The best edu- 
cational opportunities can be provided only in 
places where clinical facilities are abundant and 
varied, and where a sufficiently large staff per- 
mits the requisite specialization. Facilities will 
be offered in this way not only for native students 
to secure fundamental training, but for medical 
missionaries to keep abreast of the advances in 
science and technique through frequent, even 
though brief, periods of resident study. 
It seems a long way from Peking to Sao Paulo, 
Brazil, but the commonwealth of science knows 
no national boundaries and ignores distances. 
In March, 1918, a new Department of Hygiene 
was opened in connection with the Faculdade de 
Medicine e Cirurgia at Sao Paulo. The Interna- 
tional Health Board has lent two American scien- 
tists to this school for a period of five years. It 
has also provided scholarships for two Brazilian 
physicians who, during this time, are to receive 
special training at schools of medicine and public 
health in America, with a view to their taking 
over the new department in Brazil. A somewhat 
similar arrangement made with the Oswaldo 
Cruz Institute for introducing a department of 
pathology, has been carried through successfully. 
Because of its interest in medical progress in 
South America, the Foundation has also agreed
-P-A-G-E-46
48 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
to underwrite, for a five-year period, half of a 
specified deficit which may attend the printing 
and the circulation in Central and South Amer- 
ica of a Spanish edition of the Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
INTERNATIONAL FELLOWSHIPS AND 
SCHOLARSHIPS 
Frequent allusions have been made to fellow- 
ships and scholarships which are granted to 
students from foreign countries or to American 
missionaries at home on furlough. Since 1915 
it has been the policy of the Foundation to be- 
stow study stipends of this kind. In 1918 a 
total of $55,000 was expended for this purpose. 
There were sixty-eight fellowships and scholar- 
ships distributed as follows: Brazilian physi- 
cians three, Chinese graduate physicians eleven, 
Chinese undergraduate medical students (for- 
merly students of the Harvard Medical School of 
China) ten, Chinese pharmacists three, Chinese 
nurses six, medical missionaries on furlough 
twenty-six, candidates under consideration for the 
new schools at Peking and Shanghai nine. Pro- 
vision was also made for bringing French physi- 
cians to the United States for special training in 
anti-tuberculosis measures, but no actual ap- 
pointments were made in 1918. The Interna- 
tional Health Board has adopted a system of 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 49 
“study leave,’ by which members of its staff of 
medical officers, now nearly sixty in number, may 
pursue special courses in public health at leading 
American or foreign institutions, at the expense 
of the Board and under favorable conditions of 
salary. In this way the equivalent of additional 
graduate fellowships has been created. Further- 
more, the Foundation gave assurances to the 
School of Hygiene and Public Health at Johns 
Hopkins and to the Rockefeller Institute for 
Medical Research, that additional appropria- 
tions would be considered if special fellowships 
should be needed for unusually promising men 
who, on being discharged from the army, pre- 
ferred public health careers to a return to private 
practice. A study of the public health and medi- 
cal education fields makes it clear that a largely 
augmented personnel of well-trained and experi- 
enced experts is a first requisite. The wise pro-

AID TO RESEARCH INSTITUTE, MENTAL 
HYGIENE, INFANTILE PARALYSIS 
As in previous years, the Foundation made 
appropriations to the budget of the Rockefeller 
4
-P-A-G-E-48
    50 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Institute for Medical Research to cover a mar- 
gin by which the income failed to meet all the 
current expenses. The erection of additions to 
buildings, war costs for supplies and scientific 
equipment, increases in wages and salaries, 
special compensations, etc., made it impossible 
to get through the year without supplemen- 
tary appropriations which aggregated $265,299. 
This amount is in addition to appropriations 
made to the Institute for special war-work in 
research, serum production, hospital care, and 
instruction of medical officers. 
Additional appropriations have made possi- 
ble studies in mental hygiene, the completion of 
the special after-care of infantile paralysis cases 
in New York City and State which the Founda- 
tion undertook in the summer of 1916, a study 
of dispensaries of New York City, and an expan- 
sion of the work of the National Organization 
for Public Health Nursing. 
STUDIES IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 
Permission granted Mr. W. L. Mackenzie 
King, at a meeting of the Rockefeller Founda- 
tion, to publish as his own property the re- 
sult of his inquiries into industrial relations, 
marked the conclusion of his official connec- 
tion with the Foundation and brought to an
-P-A-G-E-49
PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 51 
end that institution’s work of investigation in 
this field. 
When, in 1914, Mr. King, who had had wide 
experience in connection with labor conditions 
in their larger aspects and had served for some 
time as Minister of Labor in the Canadian Cabi- 
net, was entrusted by,the Rockefeller Founda- 
tion with a study of industrial relations, it was 
expected that he would visit the leading coun- 
tries of the world, make first hand investigations, 
and, as a result of these inquiries, offer construc- 
tive suggestions concerning industrial and social 
policies. 
The war not only prevented Mr. King from 
making these studies, but so completely changed 
the industrial situation in all countries that he 
was compelled to modify his plan. He decided, 
therefore, to prepare, on the basis of his own 
experience and the literature available, a state- 
ment of the underlying principles which are find- 
ing expression in the organization of industrial 
society. The resulting volume* has been pub- 
lished, not as an official report of the Foundation, 
but as a contribution by Mr. King personally to 
this important subject. 
The war did more than change the present. 
It forced the consideration of the future on a

scale never before attempted. England, France, 
and Germany are already formulating compre- 
hensive programs of national reconstruction 
which include transportation, industry, housing, 
health, and education. In the United States 
many reconstruction proposals are being put 
forward by both governmental and private 
agencies. In these circumstances the Rocke- 
feller Foundation deemed it fitting to discontinue 
studies of industrial relations, and to devote it- 
self primarily to the program of medical educa- 
tion, public health demonstration, and war 
work co-operation to which it had become 
increasingly committed. 
A RESUME OF WAR-WORK APPROPRIATIONS 
1914-1919 
The table on pages 54-55 gives a complete 
conspectus of all contributions made by the 
Rockefeller Foundation for war purposes from 
the beginning of hostilities in 1914 up to and 
including the appropriations voted in 1918 but 
payable in the year 1919. The total sum for the 
six years is approximately twenty-two and one- 
half millions. During the years 1914-1916 the 
Foundation maintained its own relief organiza- 
tion in Europe, but when the United States 
entered the war, this staff was withdrawn and
-P-A-G-E-51
  PRESIDENT’S REVIEW 53 
appropriations for allied countries were made 
directly to the American Red Cross. The 
policy of the Foundation has been to work so far 
as possible through a few co-ordinated agencies 
rather than to distribute relatively small sums 
to a large number of independent societies. 
Thus, in the field of Camp and Community 
Welfare, the recommendations of the govern- 
ment-appointed Commissions on Training Camp 
Activities were accepted as a guide. For exam- 
ple, the large gifts to the American Social Hy- 
giene Association were toward budgets which 
were a part of the government’s program for 
law enforcement and vice control in the areas 
tributary to army and navy camps. 
In the field of medical research and relief, 
special appropriations were concentrated upon 
the Rockefeller Institute, which maintained a 
war hospital for 363 patients, prepared about 
25,000 doses of serums, conducted special inves- 
tigations, and gave instruction to 1,540 army and 
navy officers, nurses, and others; upon the 
National Research Council, a semi-governmental 
agency manned by the leading scientific men of 
the country; and upon the National Committee 
for Mental Hygiene, which rendered important 
aid in helping the army to recruit trained psychia- 
trists whose services proved so valuable in exam- 
ining soldiers and sailors and in treating nervous

disorders among the men. The work of the 
Tuberculosis Commission in France has been 
reported as a part of the public health program 
of the International Health Board. 
It is to be noted that relief funds for Europe 
and Asia were entrusted, so far as the large 
items are concerned, to a few agencies which the 
Foundation believed were best able to use the 
money effectively. The American Red Cross, 
the Commission for Belgian Relief, the Com- 
mittee for Armenian and Syrian Relief, and the 
International Y. M. C. A. Service for Prisoners 
of War, received the bulk of the appropriations. 
It is not to be inferred that the Foundation did 
not realize that a considerable number of other 
societies were doing excellent and needed work. 
It believed, however, that one of the duties of 
the American Red Cross was to unify or at least 
to correlate American efforts, and that it was not 
the function of the Rockefeller Foundation to set 
itself up as a censor or standardizer of relief 
agencies. i

gift of one million from the Founder was credited 
to current income and not to the principal fund. 
The balance of eleven and a half millions carried 
over from 1917 was largely mortgaged by pledges 
made in that year but not payable until 1918. 
This applies also to the balance of five millions 
carried forward into the budget of 1919. The 
estimated balance available for appropriation in 
1920 falls below a half million. Only the spend- 
ing of five millions of principal and the receipt of 
six and a half millions in gifts have made possible 
the extraordinary expenditures for war purposes 
during 1917 and 1918. With the return to a 
peace basis the regular expenses for public health 
and the heavy costs of building programs in 
China will for some time to come absorb a large - 
part of the current income. ‘The table on pages 
69 to 71 gives a complete list of the expendi- 
tures made for all purposes during 1918, while 
the Treasurer’s report (see pages 281 to 355) 
contains a full statement of all details as to 
the investments, other property, income, and 
expenditures of the Foundation.

program which is dominated by a purpose to 
promote the general aim of the Foundation as 
expressed in its charter: the Welfare of Man- 
kind throughout the World. With the coming 
of peace the nations are making an effort to 
come into closer relations of understanding and 
good will. Gradually, more normal conditions 
of intercourse will be re-established. Restric- 
tions upon travel and commerce will be relaxed. 
There will be an exchange not only of commod- 
ities but of ideas. Each country will be urged 
to contribute its best achievements to a common 
fund upon which all lands may draw. In this 
commerce of culture, science, sympathy, and 
idealism, the Rockefeller Foundation desires 
to put its policies, personnel, and resources at 
the service of the world.

SECRETARY’S REPORT 
_ The review by the President outlines the 
policies by which the Rockefeller Foundation is 
being guided in its work, sketches its present 
program, and describes the results aimed at and 
accomplished during the year 1918. The fol- 
lowing report depicts the organization and the 
agencies through which these results were 
reached, and outlines the methods by which 
the programs of the several departments were 
carried out.

. Edwin R. Embree, Secretary 
Regular meetings of the Foundation were 
held in February, May, and December. Details 
of work, within general policies approved by the 
Foundation, were determined upon from time 
to time by the Executive Committee, which 
held eighteen meetings during the year. 
METHODS OF CARRYING OUT WORK 
The agencies through which the Foundation 
accomplishes its work are of two classes: 
1. Those agencies which it creates to carry out specific 
programs. 
2. Other existing organizations, unaffiliated with the 
Foundation, to which it makes appropriations in order 
to enable them to carry out specific programs. 
Agencies of the first class, that is, departmental 
organizations, have been maintained during 
the year, as follows: 
1. International Health Board. 
2. China Medical Board.

  68 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
ASSISTANCE TO OTHER AGENCIES 
In addition to the work carried out through 
the departmental organizations described above, 
the Rockefeller Foundation has contributed 
during the year to the accomplishment of work 
undertaken by other and unaffiliated organiza- 
tions. 
The work of the year, whether through its 
own agencies or by assistance to unaffiliated 
organizations, has been chiefly within the three 
fields of war work, public health, and medical 
education. 
On pages 69 to 71 will be found a sum- 
mary of payments made by the Rockefeller 
Foundation for all purposes during the year 
1918. This tabular summary outlines, in terms 
of expenditures, the work described in terms of 
aims and results in the President’s review. In 
many instances these payments involve sums 
expended on account of appropriations made 
in former years. On the other hand, they 
represent but partial payments on many of 
the appropriations made during 1918, which will 
provide for continuing work during succeeding 
years. For a full statement of the finances of 
the Foundation, see the Report of the Treas- 
urer, pages 281 to 355.

  INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD - 
The resolutions creating the International — 
Health Board dedicated it to the field of pre- 
ventive medicine. Its immediate object was to 
extend measures for the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease to countries throughout the world, 
and to follow up these measures with efforts to 
assist in the establishment of permanent agencies 
for promoting public sanitation and spreading 
the knowledge of scientific medicine. It was 
contemplated that the treatment and cure of 
hookworm disease would make a strong appeal, 
and serve as an excellent starting-point from 
which the various states and nations might 
develop and put into execution well-rounded, 
comprehensive programs for advancing the public 
health. 
THE POLICY JUSTIFYING ITSELF 
It is therefore especially gratifying that in 
submitting this, the Fifth Annual Report, it is 
possible to present much additional information 
showing that hookworm disease is a serious 
menace to many millions of people. As further 
experience is gained with measures for its control, 
the evidence becomes more and more convincing 
that these measures afford one of the best single 
means of creating a widely understood concept 
6 81 “ 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  82 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
of what modern health measures may accom- 
plish. Hookworm control demonstrations almost 
everywhere are being followed by a desire on the 
part of the people for better public health 
administration. 
INCREASED APPROPRIATIONS BY HEALTH 
DEPARTMENTS 
One of the most significant developments of 
the year’s work was the increased financial par- 
ticipation of official health agencies in demon- 
strations for the control of hookworm disease. 
Incidentally, these demonstrations resulted in 
the organization and development of permanent 
agencies for the improvement of general health 
conditions. In Brazil, in Australia, in Ceylon, 
and in the Southern United States, local agencies 
enlarged their hookworm programs and provided 
additional funds. The method of manifesting 
interest through an increase in local appropria- 
tions found expression, however, in a number of 
other countries as well. In fact, peoples and 
governments everywhere seemed actuated by 
the desire. to increase their health activities. 
The people at large are realizing more and more 
that the health of their communities is their 
responsibility, and that all work for bettering 
health conditions is their task,—theirs to sup- 
port, theirs to administer, and theirs to profit by.

' CONTROL OF YELLOW FEVER 
In 1916 a Commission was organized to locate 
the endemic foci of yellow fever and to ascertain 
the practicability of eradicating the infection 
from these centers. The Commission visited all 
regions in South America in which yellow fever 
had been reported or suspected in recent years, 
and reported its findings. War conditions made 
it necessary to suspend the operations which, 
following the Commission’s recommendations, 
had been authorized for 1917, but work under 
the direction of Major General W. C. Gorgas 
was again begun in 1918. 
INVESTIGATION OF , YELLOW FEVER AND RELATED 
INFECTIONS AT GUAYAQUIL 
Arrangements were completed in June, 1918, 
to undertake at Guayaquil, Ecuador, a study of 
yellow fever infection and related infections 
which are frequently confused with yellow fever. 
The diagnosis of this fever has been extremely 
difficult. ‘There have been no definite symptoms 
nor group of symptoms nor laboratory tests that 
could be accepted as conclusive. Even the find- 
ings of competent commissions have not in all 
cases sufficed to dispel the last honest doubt. It 
seemed advisable, therefore, before undertaking 
control measures on a large scale, to subject 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  84 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
these baffling infections to careful laboratory 
study with a view to contributing, if possible, to 
the true etiology of yellow fever. Guayaquil 
seemed to offer the material and the Government 
of Ecuador welcomed the proposal. 
Personnel of Commission to Guayaquil and Subjects 
‘Studied 
The investigation was entrusted to a Com- 
mission composed of Dr. Arthur I. Kendall, Dean 
of the Northwestern University Medical School, 
Chairman, Dr. Hideyo Noguchi, of the Rocke- 
feller Institute for Medical Research, Dr. Mario 
G. Lebredo, of Cuba, Dr. Charles A. Elliott, and 
Mr. Herman E. Redenbaugh. The Commission, 
provided with laboratory equipment, arrived in 
Guayaquil on August 2. It was extended the 
courtesy of an official reception and was given 
every facility for the conduct of its investigations. 
The results of its activities have been reported in 
the form of four separate studies, as follows: 
1. A Sanitary Survey of the Republic of Ecuador, by 
Drs. Kendall and Lebredo; 
2. A Bacteriological Study of Yellow Fever, by Dr. 
Noguchi; 
3. A Clinical Study of Yellow Fever, by Dr. Chas. A. 
Elliott, and Supplementary Report by Dr. Lebredo; 
4, A Chemical Study of Yellow Fever, by Mr, Reden- 
baugh,

INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 85 
Isolation of Yellow Fever Organism 
Dr. Noguchi succeeded in isolating an organ- 
ism, to which he has given the name of Leptospira 
icteroides, which is the apparent cause of yellow 
fever. At the end of 1918 much work was still 
required to demonstrate that the true etiologic 
agent had been discovered, but the prospect for 
success is most encouraging. If the germ of 
yellow fever has been discovered it will still fur- 
ther simplify the problem of eradicating the seed- 
beds of yellow fever; and upon the successful 
completion of that task, the disease should dis- 
appear from the earth. 
YELLOW FEVER EPIDEMIC IN GUATEMALA 
An epidemic of yellow fever made its appear- 
ance in Guatemala in June, 1918. At that time 
there were large concentrations of American sol- 
diers in the neighborhood of the southern ports 
of the United States. The Surgeons General of 
the United States Army and the United States 
Public Health Service therefore regarded the 
presence of an uncontrolled epidemic so near the 
border as a menace calling for energetic measures. 
After consultation with the Guatemalan Minister 
in Washington, the Board tendered its services 
to the President of the Republic of Guatemala, 
offering to send a competent medical officer to 
co-operate in bringing the epidemic under con-  
-P-A-G-E-84
    
86 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
trol. The offer was promptly accepted. On 
July 11, 1918; Senior Surgeon Joseph H. White, 
who had been released by the Army and granted 
leave by the Public Health Service for the detail, 
undertook this task. i 
Route Traversed by Infection in Guatemala 
On arriving in Guatemala and making an in- 
spection of the infected region, it was ascer- 
tained that the disease had spread to seventeen 
communities on or near the west coast. The in- 
fection seems to have been introduced into 
Guatemala from southwestern Mexico. Enter- 
ing Guatemala apparently from Tapachula and 
appearing first in that country in the town of 
Ayutla, it spread from that point along the 
International Railway, eventually reaching Re- 
talhuleu and Escuintla, and extending as far 
‘south as San Jose. In the seventeen commu- 
nities into which the infection was introduced, 
550 cases of yellow fever and 200 deaths were 
reported. 
Control Measures Pursued in Guatemala 
The President of Guatemala gave Dr. White 
full authority and directed the Governors of 
Guatemalan states to give all necessary aid. 
Quarantine was established and maintained, 
physicians were drafted into service, a system of 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 87 
daily house-to-house inspection was established 
in each infected community, suspected cases were 
promptly isolated, the houses from which they 
were removed were fumigated, and measures were 
inaugurated and systematically carried out for 
the destruction or control of the breeding places 
of the stegomyia mosquito. Special quarantine 
measures were employéd to prevent the spread of 
the disease to the Atlantic coast. As the only 
route by which yellow fever was likely to spread 
to the Atlantic Coast was by the railroad which 
passed over the dividing mountain at an eleva- 
tion of 5,000 feet, this was comparatively simple. 
By September 19 the disease was under com- 
plete control, and after December 2 no further 
cases occurred. Vigilance was continued, how- 
ever, up to the end of the year. The outcome 
was especially gratifying and encouraging in that 
it demonstrated that yellow fever could be con- 
trolled with the personnel and facilities available 
in Central American countries, and at a cost well 
within their financial ability. 
EFFORTS TO EXTERMINATE YELLOW FEVER AT 
GUAYAQUIL 
An arrangement has been entered into with 
the Government of Ecuador by which an effort 
is to be made to free that country and the west 
   
-P-A-G-E-86
  88 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
coast of South America of yellow fever infection. 
Operations to this end are now under way. 
Following the departure of the Yellow Fever 
Commission, Dr. M. E. Connor, a member of 
the Board’s field staff, was detailed to inaugurate 
measures for the extermination of this disease at 
Guayaquil. He arrived in Ecuador on Novem- 
ber 12 and was most courteously received. 
Plans were agreed upon, Dr. Connor was made a 
director of the work under the department of 
health, and on November 27 active operations 
began. By the end of December, 125 men had 
been engaged and twenty-five mosquito squads 
under competent direction were at work. The 
Government, the people, and the press are giving 
energetic co-operation. Yellow fever is reported 
as having been unusually prevalent this season. 
The work now in progress, however, is expected 
to result in the near future in a definite reduction 
in the number of cases, and ultimately in the 
extermination of the disease.

Provinces in India, inaugurated work for the 
control of hookworm disease entirely under 
Government auspices. The city of Rio de Ja- 
neiro, Brazil, with a population of 1,130,000 and a 
school population estimated at 275,000, arranged 
to examine and treat its school children, and the 
Government of Java began the treatment of all 
infected soldiers in its army. 
Invitations to Participate in Control Measures 
Notwithstanding the unsettled conditions pro- 
duced by the war, requests for participation in 
measures for the control of hookworm disease 
continued to arrive from various countries. 
During the year, invitations of this kind were 
received from Colombia in South America, from 
Barbados, Curacao, and Santo Domingo in the 
West Indies, from the Madras Presidency in 
India, from Kelantan in the Federated Malay 
States, and from Mauritius. 
Findings of Infection Surveys 
The three infection surveys completed during 
the year indicated that in Jamaica approxi- 
mately 60 per cent of the inhabitants have hook- 
worm disease; in Sao Paulo, approximately 60 
per cent; and in Guam approximately 70 per 
cent. The surveys of Jamaica and Sao Paulo 
are to be followed by comprehensive co-operative

attacks on the disease, and it is likely that the 
medical service of Guam will undertake similar 
measures entirely under its own auspices. | 
Mental Retardation from Hookworm Disease 
Y The examinations for hookworm disease made 
among United States soldiers confirmed in a 
striking way the Board’s experience of the past 
few years, and demonstrated that even light 
hookworm infections are of great importance. 
Judged by the Binet-Simon and other tests, 
many full-grown soldiers who harbored compar- 
atively few hookworms had the mentality of 
persons only twelve years of age. The mental- 
ity of 10,000 white men at Camp Travis who 
harbored the disease was about 33 per cent 
below normal. Negroes were infected quite as 
frequently as whites, but they appeared to be 
relatively immune to the serious effects of the 
disease and did not show the same predisposition 
to other diseases or the same reduction in men- 
tality. ‘ 
Mental tests of a similar nature among 340 
school children in Queensland, Australia, showed 
that there was an average retardation of approx- 
imately two years among heavily infected chil- 
dren. The longer the infection persisted, the 
greater was the retardation. The average retard- 
ation of lightly-infected cases was nine months.
-P-A-G-E-92
94 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Physical Improvement Following Treatment 
In Siam, the weights of ninety-nine lightly 
infected soldiers were taken upon their entrance 
to the army, and again at the expiration of a 
year. Meanwhile, sixty-nine of these soldiers 
were treated for hookworm disease, and the other 
thirty remained without treatment. ‘Those who 
were treated gained an average of 10.6 pounds 
in a period of one year; those who were not, an 
average of only 1.1 pounds. In Ceylon—where 
the infection rate among estate laborers averages 
98 per cent and many severe infections are found 
—there had been 3,694 admissions to hospital 
in one district the year before treatment for 
hookworm disease was carried out. The follow- 
ing year, with an increased population, the 
number dropped to 2,604,—a reduction in the 
morbidity rate of at least 27 per cent. Again, 
in the same colony, among a laboring population 
of 17,838 on a certain group of estates, the death 
rate from influenza was twice as high among 
those who had not been treated for hookworm 
disease as among those who had received treat- 
ment. 
Increased Wages and Greater Earning Capacity 
In Costa Rica, sixty-six laborers before be- 
ing treated for hookworm disease normally 
cultivated 563 acres of coffee monthly. After
-P-A-G-E-93
  INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 95 
being treated for hookworm disease they cul- 
tivated 750 acres, resulting in a net monthly 
increase in wages of 27 per cent after allowing 
for a 15 per cent reduction in unit pay. More- 
over, in India, Clayton Lane reports that the 
amount of work increased 20 per cent on one 
estate and 50 per cent on another, and on both 
was of better quality than before the laborers 
were treated; while reports from British Guiana 
indicate that the efficiency of the laborers em- 
ployed by one company increased from 25 to 50 
per cent after hookworm measures were put into 
operation. 
Importance of Mild Infections 
It will be apparent from the preceding para- 
graphs that mild infections require treatment. 
One mildly infected person in a short space of 
time may transmit the disease to an unlimited 
number of other persons. , The fact that in any 
locality the disease is found in only a moderate 
or mild form should not encourage that locality 
to neglect measures for its control. Not only 
may the disease be readily stamped out when 
the infection is light, but unless active control 
measures are undertaken it is almost certain to 
spread and to increase in intensity, and to 
develop into a problem of serious import to the 
community. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  96 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
| 
Soil Sanitation as a Means of Control 
The crux of the hookworm problem is to pre- 
vent the infected soil from coming into contact 
with the hands, feet, or other bare portions of hu- 
man beings. The most important undertaking in 
all efforts to stamp out the disease is therefore 
to prevent the deposit of ova-impregnated feces 
upon the surface of the ground. This may be 
accomplished by providing for the construction 
and use of properly built and adequate latrines 
to serve as receptacles for the contaminated 
human discharges. To assure the installation, 
maintenance, and use of sufficient and satisfac- 
tory latrines is, however, a formidable under- 
taking, and involves the task of inducing hun- 
dreds of millions of people in infected regions to 
abandon habits ingrained by centuries of custom. 
During recent years much of the Board’s atten- 
tion has been directed to aiding health depart- 
ments to bring about the safe disposal of human 
excrement. Many of the details in relation to 
this work are of extreme interest and will be 
found on pages 166 to 185 of the appendix. 
Latrine Construction Prerequisite to Hookworm

It is now fairly well recognized, and is becom- 
ing more so with increasing experience, that in

-P-A-G-E-95
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 97 
effective, thorough provision must be made in 
advance for the proper disposal of human 
discharges. Thus, in Nicaragua, Seychelles, 
Ceylon, Jamaica, Barbados, and other countries, 
communities desiring the Board’s participation 
in efforts to control hookworm were advised 
that assistance could not be rendered unless 
latrines or other proper methods for disposing of 
human excrement were installed and in use in 
advance of treatment being undertaken. There 
is, every reason to believe that in this way the 
number of re-infections can be greatly reduced. 
Growth of Interest in Public Health throughout Brazil 
Increased interest and support for rural 
health work have followed the hookworm dem- 
onstrations which have been conducted in Brazil 
during the past few 
years. The Federal 
Government has ap- 
propriated $250,000 
with which to co-op- 
erate with the states 
in a program of rural 
sanitation in which

  98 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
to be given foremost consideration. The several 
states of Brazil are meeting the Federal proposal 
with liberal appropriations. Up to the end of 
the year approximately $750,000 had been made 
available for the purpose. 
County Health Service in Southern United States 
Directly as a result of the interest in disease 
control created by the hookworm demonstrations 
in the Southern States, county health depart- 
ments with full-time health officers are gradually 
being organized. North Carolina was the first 
state in the South to meet its rural health prob- 
lems by effective organization ona county basis. 
Other states are rapidly introducing similar pro- 
grams. In order to stimulate rural sanitation, 
the Board assumes part of the expense involved. 
Its contribution, in the case of North Carolina, 
is on a decreasing scale for a three-year period. 
At the expiration of this time, the State and the 
counties jointly will bear the entire expense. 
Health Developments in Australia 
On invitation by the Commonwealth Govern- 
ment of Australia, a hookworm infection survey 
was conducted in Papuain 1917. The survey re- 
vealed that the concentration of laborers on plan- 
tations and the periodical return of the laborers 
to their villages intensified the hookworm infec- 
tion and assisted in spreading the disease among

the native population. Following the survey, the 
Australian Government approved a proposal for 
the organization of a health service for the colony 
and the inauguration of active measures for the 
control of hookworm 
disease, and made a 
preliminary appropri- 
ation of $5,000 for car- 
rying out the plan. If 
the proposals of the 
Peace Conference are 
carried intoeffect, Aus- 
tralia will be charged 
with the responsibility 
of administering the

The survey of Papua was followed by a demon- 
stration in hookworm control in Queensland. 
This demonstration was carried out in co-opera- 
tion with the health department of that State. 
The Commonwealth Government has now pro- 
posed a five-year period of co-operation in carry- 
ing out in Queensland and in the other states of 
Australia, a program for rural sanitation in

which hookworm control is to play a leading 
part. At the outset the Board will make a sub- 
stantial contribution toward the maintenance of 
this project. This contribution will decrease 20 
. per cent annually and at the end of five years the 
entire expense will be borne by Australia. 
TUBERCULOSIS WORK IN FRANCE 
During 1918 the work of the Commission for 
the Prevention of Tuberculosis in France was 
conducted in four departments or divisions: the 
educational division, the medical division, the 
department of nursing, and the department of 
extension. All the work was done in close co- 
operation with the governmental authorities, 
private agencies, and the American Red Cross. 
The work of the department of extension was 
carried on in common by the American Red 
Cross and the Commission in twenty-seven de- 
partments of France. Further details with re- 
gard to the work in France will be found in the 
appendix, pages 201 to 206. 
MALARIA CONTROL 
The field experiments which have .been con- 
ducted during the past three years in conjunction 
with Federal and state health agencies, have 
proceeded sufficiently far to warrant the assump-
-P-A-G-E-101
  
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 103 
tion that malaria control in the average town 
in the Southern States may be accomplished at 
a cost well within the means of the average com- 
munity. It is hoped that these demonstrations 
will stimulate health departments throughout the 
Southern States to test the malaria measures 
which have been employed, and to carry out 
state-wide campaigns for the control of this dis- 
ease if they find these methods successful. 
Malaria is recognized as one of the most serious 
of the disabling diseases of man. In India it is 
estimated that each year there are 1,130,000 
deaths and more than 100,000,000 cases of illness. 
The econdédmic loss in our Southern States is 
incalculable. The greatest incidence of the dis- 
ease occurs during October, which is the period 
of the year when labor is most in demand to 
harvest the crops. Therefore, anything which 
will tend to reduce the incidence of this disease 
will prove of enormous value in reducing human 
ills and will save vast sums in treasure. More 
detailed information with regard to the experi- 
ences with malaria during the past few years 
will be found in the appendix, pages 186 to 200.

PUBLIC HEALTH TRAINING 
In March, 1918, the Department of Hygiene 
which has been established in connection with 
the Faculdade de Medicina e Girurgia, at Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, was formally opened. This school 
is to be maintained jointly by the Medical School 
and the Board for a period of five years. If at the 
expiration of this period, the Department shall 
have justified itself, Government will assume its 
entire support. The services of two American 
scientists—Drs. Samuel T. Darling and Wilson 
G. Smillie—have been lent to the school for the 
five-year period, and fellowships have been pro- 
vided for training two Brazilian physicians at 
the Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public 
Health, with a view to their returning to Brazil 
for service in the Department. 
The school was particularly fortunate in be- 
ginning its work at a time when a new interest in 
public health was being manifested throughout 
Brazil. The Federal and state Governments 
were making liberal appropriations for rural 
sanitation, popular articles on disease prevention 
were appearing in the leading dailies, and two 
Brazilian societies of large influence were under- 
taking campaigns for acquainting their members 
and the public generally with the teachings of 
hygiene. As one result of this awakened interest,

‘ADDITIONAL INFORMATION . IN 
THE APPENDIX 
The previous annual reports of the Board 
have been confined mainly to a general discus- 
sion of outstanding results. Frequent inquiries 
have been received for more detailed informa- 
tion, particularly with regard to the problems to 
be met in the control of various diseases and to 
the working methods employed in meeting these 
problems. ‘This has seemed to justify including 
in this report a considerable amount of such 
information. The material is submitted in the 
following pages in the form of an appendix. It 
discusses somewhat at length the Board’s experi- 
ence with measures for the prevention, cure, and 
control of hookworm disease, its field experi- 
ments in malaria control, and its activities 
against tuberculosis in France.

APPENDIX 
I 
EXTENT AND SEVERITY OF HOOKWORM 
DISEASE 
Hookworm disease exists wherever the larvae of the hookworm 
find favorable conditions of shade, moisture, and temperature for 
their propagation and growth. These conditions are commonly 
found in tropical and sub-tropical countries in the zone which en- 
circles the earth between parallels 36° north and 30° south. The 
most favorable temperature for the development of the larvae is 
from 25 to 35° centigrade. Below 22° centigrade few larvae develop. 
Rainfall is an important contributing factor in the spread of the 
disease. In six adjoining settlements of Queensland, Australia, in 
which work was conducted during 1918, the percentage of hookworm 
infection ran parallel with the amount of rainfall. Thus, in two 
districts having an annual rainfall of less than 90 inches, the per- 
centage of infection was 13.8, while that in four districts having more 
than 90 inches of rainfall was 27.8. 
      
Fig. 8.—Correlation between rates of hookworm infection and 
amount of rainfall. Texas 
Hookworm Primarily a Rural Disease. Persons who live in the 
country, away from sewerage, and who work in the soil, are much 
more frequently infected with the disease than city residents (see 
Fig. 9, page 112); while those who go barefoot, or in other ways allow 
the bare skin to come into contact with polluted soil, show corres- 
pondingly higher rates of infection than those who wear shoes. 
For example, the survey of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, concluded 
during 1918, showed 41.2 per cent infection among shoe-wearers, as 
Ill
-P-A-G-E-110

compared with a rate of 62.9 per cent among persons who went 
barefoot. 
Wide-Spread Prevalence within Infected Region. An idea 
of the extensive prevalence of the disease within the infected zone 
may be gained from the following statements. In the sixteen foreign 
countries enumerated on page 91, measures for the relief and control 
of the disease were terminated during 1918 in 124 rural areas having 
an average population of 2,097. In three-fourths of these areas, 
more than sixty of every hundred persons examined were found to be 
infected. In eighteen of the areas the infection rate was between 
90 and 100 per cent; in nineteen between 80 and 90 per cent; in 
twenty-four between 70 and 80 per cent; and in twenty-nine between 
60 and 70 percent. In only one area—the canton of San Domingo, 
in Costa Rica—was a rate lower than 20 per cent recorded. Here 
only 9.2 per cent of the inhabitants were found to be infected. 
High Rate of Infection in India. Microscopic examination in 
Ceylon of more than 50,000 Tamil coolies from Southern India has 
shown more ethan 98 per cent of them to be infected. This confirms 
the investigations carried out 
by the Indian Medical Service 
at Negapatam—the great clear- 
ing port for labor leaving South 
India—which showed 99.8 per 
cent of the emigrant laborers 
to be infected. Much of In- 
dia’s population of 300,000,000 
is under the burden of a heavy 
hookworm infection and is the 
source from which the disease 
is carried to many parts of the 
world. In some of the rural 
regions of this country, from 80 
to 100 per cent of the popula- 
tion are infected.

carried out by Lieut.-Colonel 
Clayton Lane under the aus- 
watt pices of the Indian Research

Zz tea gardens in Assam, showed. Fig. 9.—Rates of hookworm

  1 This low infection rate is ascribed by the director to the fact that all of the 
people are well-to-do and have for some time had adequate medical service at hand.

the 12,570 prisoners examined. In all, twenty-six jails were visited, 
and the rates of infection recorded ranged from 47.9 in the Presi- 
dency jail at Calcutta to as high as 86 per cent in the jail at Hooghly. 
The sanitary authorities be- i 
lieve that more than 30,000,000 - 
of the 45,000,000 inhabitants of 
Bengal proper are infected, and 
are undertaking a systematic 
attack on the disease, beginning 
with a campaign in the schools. 
Prevalence of the Disease 
in Brazil. The Director of 
Rural Sanitation estimates that 
_ more than 80 per cent of the 
adults and more than 90 per 
cent of the children living 
in rural portions of the Fed- 
eral District of Brazil are 
infected with some form of 
intestinal parasite. The num- 
ber infected with hookworm 
he puts at 100,000, or two- 
thirds of the district’s rural 5 
population. Among the. first eee 3 8 2 5 5

Based on examinations from March 
12, 1914, to December 31, 1918 
with hookworm was 75, and 
only six persons were found who were free of some form of 
intestinal parasite. : 
Inthe survey of the State of Sao Paulo, two of every three persons 
examined were found to be infected with hookworm disease, and four 
of every five with some type of parasite; while in two rural areas in 
the State of Rio de Janeiro, the percentages of hookworm infection 
recorded were 67.7 and 88.5.. Among the first 450 persons examined 
in the State of Parana every one was found to be infected with hook- 
worm, thus indicating that the littoral of this State, though well 
within the temperate zone, will show an incidence of infection among 
the highest in Brazil. In this country, as elsewhere, children and 
young adults are found to bear the brunt of the disease. 
Infection Rates in Countries Newly Inaugurating Control 
Measures. An infection rate of 59 per cent among the first 3,354 
persons examined in China is reported; of 76.7 among 31,298 residents 
of Siam; and of 22.5 per cent among 11,678 persons living in six small 
settlements of Queensland, Australia. These are countries in which 
co-operative control measures were first undertaken during 1918,  
-P-A-G-E-112
    II4 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Reports from Australia had indicated that there was little or no 
infection among the aborigines, but from 60 to 100 per cent of all 
those examined to date have been found infected. Arrangements 
for their treatment are now being made through the Chief Protector 
of Aborigines. 
SEVERITY OF THE INFECTION 
The severity of the disease is now believed by many authors 
to depend primarily upon the number of worms harbored by 
infected individuals. Gener- 
ally, the higher the percent- 
age of persons infected in a 
given locality the larger is the 
average number of worms har- 
bored by infected individuals, 
the more severe are the symp- 
toms found, and the more dif- 
ficult is the disease to bring 
under control. The difficulty 
of effecting cures in localities 
with high rates of infection is 
strikingly illustrated by figures 
compiled in Brazil and in Trin- 
idad. In the former country, 
the percentage of persons cured 
by two treatments of the same 
drug, administered in the same 
a manner and under practically 
3 il a a the same conditions, was 38 in 
Reais Rio Bonito, a municipality hav-

The statistics for Trinidad (see Fig. 14, page 117) cover the exam- 
ination of 42,284 residents of that colony during the period from 
May 15, 1915, to December 31, 1918. It will be noted that in dis- 
tricts with 25 to 29 per cent of their inhabitants infected, the per- 
centage of infected persons cured by two treatments was as high as 
75. As the rate of infection rose, the difficulty of curing increased, 
until in localities with extremely high rates of infection—represent- 
ing between 95 and 99 per cent of their inhabitants—only 19 per 
cent of the infected persons could be cured by two treatments. 
The drugs used and the conditions of administration were practi- 
cally the same in all districts, g

Determining Severity by Counting the Worms. The num- 
ber of worms harbored by a group of individuals may be ascertained 
quite accurately by giving them a vermifuge and counting the worms 
expelled after the drug has acted. It is usual to count the worms for 
a period of two or three days following each treatment. Worm- 
counts are of value not only because they reveal the average degree 
of infection in different communities, as well as the type of worm 
harbored, but also because they are of much assistance as a means 
of demonstrating the presence of the disease and of enlisting popular 
support in measures for its control. They were made a feature of the 
work during 1918 in Siam, Nicaragua, China, and Brazil. 
Infection Index in Different Regions. In Siam the feces of 
fifty-nine persons were examined for seven hours after first treat- 
ment. The average number of worms expelled was forty-five. 
More than half (39) of the cases harbored less than twenty worms 
each. In Nicaragua, on the other hand, as many as 4,000 worms 
were recovered from a single patient, and in Brazil particularly 
high worm counts were obtained in the States of Sao Paulo and 
Rio de Janeiro. Here the incidence of the infection is reported to 
be high and the disease severe in form derpite the fact that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
118 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
climate is cool the year round. 
The total of 29,029 hookworms 
recovered from 280 residents of 
these States, who were treated 
for determining the degree of 
infection, gave an_ infection 
index! of 104. This is twelve 
points higher than the index 
for Java, where the disease was 
thought to be more wide-spread 
in extent and more severe in 
form than in Brazil (see Fig. 
15). 
Worms Harbored by Bra- 
zilian Vagabond Boys. Near- 
ly 11,000 worms were recovered 
from a group of eighty-one 
vagabond boys treated in the 
State of Rio de Janeiro. The 
Al counts ranged from 2 to 982;

similar experiment among forty-five vagabond boys in the State of 
Sao Paulo, an average of 233 worms was obtained after treatment 
from nineteen boys who had always lived in the country, and an 
average of 59 from twenty-six boys who had always been city 
residents.

Degree of Infection Among Agricultural Workers in Brazil. 
Townspeople are always more lightly infected than agriculturists. 
This is shown, for example, in Fig. 16, page 119, which compares the 
infection indices of town residents, mountaineers, and agricultural 
workers in.Java. The urban dwellers treated in Brazil yielded, on 
the average, less than fifty worms, while groups of farm laborers 
expelled from 55 to 233. From three adult farm workers in Guarul- 
hos, 1,390, 1,031, and 405 worms apiece, or 972 average, were obtained. 
The average number of worms harbored by all workers on coffee 
plantations in the States of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo doubtless 
reaches 160 or more; children under fourteen years of age living on 
these farms have been found to harbor as many as 365 worms. Cof- 
fee growers and employers of agricultural labor in general realize 
what this means as a cause of debilitation and inefficiency, and 
are becoming interested in efforts to promote the health and work-

Severity of Infection 
Among Southern Troops 
in U. S. Army. Knowlton, 
in his work at Camp Jackson, 
South Carolina, treated for 
hookworm disease a large num-

Carolinas and Florida. Among 
sixty-nine white and eighteen 
colored cases, the average 
number of worms obtained 
from the whites was 155.3; 
from the colored, 38.3. In a = 37 
considerable proportion of the Java Java Sumatra 
soldiers the infection was mild 
in form, but all grades were 
encountered, and in a few cases

Through the means of the laboratory car Meitchnikoff there were 
unsurpassed facilities for observing the effects of hookworm disease 
upon troops of the Southern Department of the United States Army, 
embracing recruits from the States of Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, and 
New Mexico. Marked clinical symptoms were absent in 90 per cent 
of the men who, upon microscopic examination, were found to be in- 
fected; on treatment the number of worms expelled the first day by 80 
per cent of the infected soldiers ranged only from one to five. This 
is an unusually light infection. The men dealt with, however, were 
between twenty and thirty years of age, an age period in which 
individual infections are dying out, and only a small proportion came 
from regions of heavy infection. 
CORRELATION BETWEEN NUMBER OF WORMS AND 
PERCENTAGE OF HEMOGLOBIN 
In general, there is definite relationship between the number of 
worms harbored and the amount of blood loss or anemia. This may 
perhaps be obscured by the resistance of the infected person, by 
abundant food, opportunities for rest, or by exceptionally active 
blood-forming processes, but the drain is none the less real and a 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
120 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
constant tax on the vital powers. Thus, in the State of Sao Paulo, 
Brazil, during 1918, the average hemoglobin of six boys above 
fourteen years of age who harbored more than four hundred worms 
each, was 63.7 per cent, as compared with an average of 72.7 per cent 
among forty-six boys of the same age who harbored less than seventy- 
five worms each. The normal hemoglobin of boys of this age is 84 
per cent. Knowlton found, in his work among soldiers at Camp 
Jackson, South Carolina, that no severe reduction in hemoglobin 
was caused by less than five hundred worms. The hemoglobin of 
thirty-three of his patients éach of whom had fewer than this num- 
ber of worms, was between 80 and 89 per cent. 
Importance of Other Factors Which Lower the Hemoglobin 
Index. All anemia encountered among the people in infected regions 
is not, of course, to be attributed to hookworm disease. Malaria and 
underfeeding, to say nothing of other devitalizing diseases and condi- 
tions, play important parts. The hemoglobin index of all 109 prison- 
ers in the jail at Batavia, Java, for example, was 25.8 points below 
the normal 95 per cent. Experiments indicated that a loss of 6.8 
points was due to hookworm disease, of 10.3 to malaria, and of 8.0 
to hard labor. Again, in Fiji, where there is no malaria, underfeed- 
ing resulted in a group of East Indians having 9.5 per cent lower 
hemoglobin than another well-fed group of the same race. Both 
groups harbored the same number of hookworms. 
Varying Effect of Equal Numbers of Worms Upon Men, 
Women, and Children. The Board’s Uncinariasis Commission 
to the Orient, working with large numbers of persons from whom prac- 
tically all hookworms had been expelled by vermifuge and counted, 
found that on the average, in the presence of the conditions that 
obtained in the areas dealt with, twelve hookworms caused a 
reduction of one per cent in hemoglobin. An equal number of worms 
produced more anemia among children than among women, and more 
among women than among men. Furthermore, when the types of 
infection resulting from equal numbers of Ancylostome duodenale and 
Necator americanus were compared, it was found that the former 
produced a more severe form of the disease than the latter.

II 
EFFECTS OF HOOKWORM INFECTION 
Hookworm infection works subtly through long periods of time. 
Its cumulative effects are handed down from generation to genera- 
tion. The disease destroys economic efficiency and social develop- 
ment on the one hand, the while it undermines physical and mental 
health on the other. It is a menace and an obstacle to all that 
makes for civilization. As a handmaiden of poverty, a handicap of 
youth, an associate of crime and degeneracy, a destroyer of energy 
and vitality, it stands in the very forefront of diseases. Its effects 
express themselves in stunted physical and mental growth, blighted 
health and efficiency, retarded economic progress, and general 
degeneracy and decay. Labor is impaired, home standards are 
lowered, mental development is inhibited, and there is a tendency for 
the human machine to wear out before its time. Wherever treat- 
ment is systematically carried out and followed by rigorous control 
of further infection, marked improvement in health and general 
capacity results. 
PHYSICAL RETARDATION 
Hookworm disease saps the strength by such imperceptible stages 
that usually the patient himself does not sense any change in his 
physical condition from day to day, until his powers of resistance 
eventually become so lowered that the germs of tuberculosis, of 
pneumonia, of typhoid fever, or of some other acute infectious disease 
find favorable lodgment and all too frequently a fatal outcome 
results. Statistics show that the mortality rate of hookworm is 
greatly exceeded by the rates of the more spectacular diseases. But 
by its steady sapping of the strength of millions of people, continued 
without interruption over many generations, hookworm disease 
causes human misery and suffering of a much more severe character 
than its low death rate would lead one to expect. 
Retardation as Measured by Hemoglobin Content. In 
Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, and a number of other countries, 
blood examinations have been made with a view to determining 
approximately the degree of anemia which is associated with the 
infection. Among a total of 142,881 persons whose blood has been 
examined to date, three-fifths had a hemoglobin index below 70 per 
cent. By far the largest number of cases in any single group (69,718) 
fell between 50 and 69. Sixteen thousand, five hundred and forty- 
seven (16,547) cases were between 30 and 49, 2,493 between 10 and 
29, and 201 below 10 (see Fig. 17). Of course not all this anemia is 
due to hookworm infection, as hard labor, underfeeding, malaria, and 
8 121
-P-A-G-E-120
  122 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
a number of other devitalizing 
diseases and conditions play 
their parts in impoverishing 
the blood. 
Increase in Hemoglobin 
Following Treatment. From 
a number of countries, distinct 
gains in hemoglobin have been 
reported among groups of in- 
fected persons after treatment 
for hookworm disease. In 
Porto Rico, the average hemo- 
globin as estimated for the 
total population over a large 
area where the test was made, 
was raised from 43 in 1904 to 72 
  in 1914; in Dutch Guiana the 1071 
average hemoglobin in a group a. 0 7 90

months or more afterwards; Fig, 17.—Reduction in hemoglobin in five towns of Nicaragua the associated with hookworm disease. 
hemoglobin index of infected Total of 142,881 persons examined to 
persons rose from 61 to 74 as date 
a result of treatment; in two 
areas of Panama from 59 to 68; and among a small group in Chieng- 
mai province, Siam, from 65.5 to 77.5. 
During 1917 and 1918 the director of the work in Costa Rica had 
opportunity to test the blood of 40,402 infected persons before treat- 
ment for hookworm disease, and of 13,489 of the same persons (33 
per cent) six months or more after they had been treated! The 
examinations before treatment showed an average hemoglobin of 
64.6 per cent; those after treatment, of 76.8 per cent. In different 
cantons of this country the gain ranged from as low as 3.0 per cent 
in San Marcos to as high as 25.0 in Alvarado. 
That the hemoglobin index continues to rise for a considerable 
period following the close of regular campaign measures is suggested 
by observations made on the estate of Rodeo, in the canton of Mora, 
Costa Rica. On this estate the average hemoglobin index of persons 
just cured was 63.3. In a re-survey conducted two years later, it 
was 76.8 among the persons remaining uninfected. 
Gain in Body Weight by Siamese Soldiers. It is customary for 
striking gains in body weight to follow treatment for hookworm dis- 
ease. Such improvement in individuals has often been noted, and 
1It would, of course, be preferable to confine the comparison before and after 
treatment to the same number of persons. However, since the cases examined after treatment were taken at random and large numbers were involved, the figures are 
doubtless sufficiently accurate for practical purposes,
-P-A-G-E-121
  
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 123 
large numbers of separate instances could be cited of remarkable 
increases in weight within short periods of time. During 1918, 
Hluang Boriracksha, of the Siamese Army Medical Service, made 
observations on ninety-nine soldiers of the Siamese Army. All of 
these men had hookworm disease. Sixty-nine of them were treated 
once with fifty grains of thymol. The other thirty were given no 
treatment whatever. The treated men gained an average of 10.6 
pounds in weight over a period of one year, while the untreated gained 
during the same period an average of only 1.1 pounds. 
Hookworm as a Predisposing Factor to Other Diseases. 
The 1918 influenza epidemic in Ceylon showed that on all the estates 
embraced within the Maskeliya area, with a total laboring population 
of 17,838, the death rate from influenza and its sequelae was twice as 
high among persons who ‘had 
not been treated for hook- 
worm disease as among those 
who had. The deaths num- 
bered 111, or 7.5 per thousand, 
among 14,659 persons who had 
been treated for hookworm 
infection before being attacked 
by influenza, as compared 
with 43, or- 13.8 per thou- 
sand, among 3,253 persons who 
had not been treated for 
hookworm. Similarly, Major 
Kofoid, of the United States 
Army Medical Service, reports 
that the hospital statistics and 
sickness records of 24,000 men 
at Camp Bowie during the 
period from October, 1917, to s 
May, 1918, indicated that the ha 
resistance to disease was lowest 
and the mortality rates were 
highest among the organiza- 
tions in which hookworm dis- 
ease was most prevalent. 
Reduction of Morbidity Following Hookworm Campaigns. 
That improved health follows treatment for hookworm disease is 
illustrated by the following instances: 
a, Decrease in admissions to estate and asylum hospitals in Trinidad. 
On one estate in Trinidad, as well as at the Orphanage and Industrial 
School located at Tunapuna in that colony, sanitary reform and the 
treatment of infected persons reduced by two-thirds the number of iS z a 5 c a a

patients admitted to hospital. The work in the Orphanage was 
completed in April of 1916. During the last two months of the year, 
only three patients were admitted to the hospital, as compared with a 
monthly average of forty admissions for the previous four years. In 
another institution in the same colony, the Boys’ Reformatory, the 
regular hookworm control measures were completed in March, 1918. 
Sixty or seventy ulcers had to be dressed daily before the boys were 
treated for hookworm disease, as compared with seventeen after 
they were treated. Of the latter number, only three were serious 
enough to require much attention. 
b. Diminished sickness in areas of British Guiana. From the 
Peter’s Hall and Belle Vue districts of British Guiana, where opera- 
tions against hookworm disease were in progress during 1914 and 
1915, the number of patients admitted to the public hospital at 
Georgetown during 1916 was 31.5 per cent lower than during 1914. 
In contrast with this, the reduction for rural districts in which meas- 
ures against hookworm disease were not carried out, was only 6.5 
per cent. 
On one estate in this colony the amount of sickness had increased 
to such an extent that before the laborers were treated for hookworm 
disease an addition to the estate hospital was planned. As a result 
of the hookworm campaign which intervened between the planning 
of the addition and its erection, the addition was found unnecessary. 
So great was the reduction in the sickness after hookworm disease 
had been treated, that even the original quarters were seldom filled 
to capacity. 
c. Lowered record of sickness calls on Ceylon estates. On seven 
estates of Ceylon there was a decrease of 1,132 sickness calls, or 44 
per cent, for four months of 1917, following treatment of the laborers 
for hookworm disease, as compared with the same four months of 
1916, before the laborers had been treated for the disease. The 
largest reduction occurred in the calls for second and third treat- 
ments, indicating that the improvement in health effected by treat- 
ment for hookworm disease resulted in the patients being more 
readily cured of all their maladies. The decrease in bowel com- 
plaints and in malarial fevers among the coolies on these estates was 
especially marked. 
In another area the District Medical Officer reported that only 
2,604 patients were admitted to hospital in 1918, after treatment for 
hookworm disease had been carried out in his locality, as compared 
with 3,694 in 1916, before systematic work against the disease had 
been begun. This represents a reduction of 27 per cent in the num- 
ber of hospital admissions. 
d. Lessening of sickness absenteeism on Indian tea estates. The 
investigation conducted by Lieut.-Col. Clayton Lane in the Darjeel- 
ing district in India showed that treatment resulted in noticeable 
improvement in the health and efficiency of labor. One manager 
wrote Dr. Lane that during the three months preceding the campaign 
against hookworm disease, at least forty-five men were continuously

absent from work because of sickness. During the same three 
months of the following year, after the hookworm campaign, only 
twenty-six men were laid off for this reason,—a reduction of 42 per 
cent. Another manager reported that previous to the time treat- 
ment was given his laborers, between 150 and 200 of them were 
absent from work daily during the rainy season. In 1918, after 
treatment had been’ administered, the number daily absent from 
work during the rains never exceeded sixty, and usually was con- 
siderably less than this figure. 
Effect of the Disease on the Birth Rate. It is probable that 
hookworm disease has a deterrent effect upon the birth rate. Not 
only do the sterility and impotence commonly caused by the infection 
reduce the frequency of conception, but the effects of the disease, 
falling most heavily on women of child-bearing age, cause a large 
proportion of the pregnancies that do occur to terminate in abor- 
tions or miscarriages. Wherever treatment is carried out over 
large areas, the birth rate is stimulated in marked degree. Many 
women become pregnant who have not borne children for years. 
The regularity of menstruation is restored, sterility reduced, the 
number of pregnancies correspondingly increased, and the propor- 
tion of unfavorable terminations reduced. This is a fact of vital 
economic significance in view of the present shortage of man-power 
throughout the world. 
MENTAL RETARDATION ~ 
During 1918 the Ministers of Public Instruction in Nicaragua and 
Salvador issued decrees calling for the examination of all school 
children for hookworm disease and for the treatment and cure of 
those infected; and the Prefect of the Federal District of Brazil, 
similarly, ordered the examination and treatment of the pupils in the 
public schools of the city of Rio de Janeiro. These acts were prompted 
by recognition of the fact that aside from its baneful influence in 
retarding physical development, hookworm disease causes a further 
loss to the state by impairing the intellectual character and capacity 
of its citizenship. 
Comparative Scholarship Gradings of Infected and Non- 
Infected. Lists of the children found infected usually correspond 
with those of the dullest pupils in their grades. In one women’s 
college in the Southern States, for example, the average standing of 
fifty-six students found infected was 78 per cent, whereas fifty-six 
students found free of infection averaged 89 per cent. In another 
instance, twenty-five infected boys in a Southern academy averaged 
64 per cent in their studies, as compared with the percentage of 86 
maintained by the same number of non-infected boys. Here the 
retardation was approximately 25 per cent. Teachers everywhere 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  128 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
are practically unanimous in reporting that treatment of the infected 
pupils results not only in marked gains in weight and physical appear- 
ance, but in decided improvement in zeal and intelligence as well. 
Mental Retardation from Hookworm Disease in U. S. Army. 
Major Kofoid reports, on the basis of his experience with hookworm 
disease among troops in the Southern Department of the United 
States Army, that when the findings of the hookworm survey were 
compared with those of the psychological board in the case of 10,000 
men at Camp Travis, Texas, the mentality of white men with hook- 
worm disease was found to be about 33 per cent below the mentality 
‘of those without it. 
Study of Mentality of Infected Children in Queensland. 
During 1918 a thorough investigation was made of the mental retarda- 
tion due to hookworm infection among the school children of Queens- 
land, Australia. The study was made possible by the Queensland 
Department of Public Instruction, which provided a school nurse’ 
for six months and all necessary facilities for carrying out the work. 
Three hundred forty children between the ages of six and fourteen 
years were selected for mental testing. As far as possible, effort was 
made to obtain a fair representation of the 5,000 or more school chil- 
dren residing within the areas visited, both as to strata of society and 
the sections of town or country from which they came. The children 
selected fell naturally into one of three groups, according as micro- 
scopic examination of the fecal specimens which they submitted 
showed that they were not infected, only lightly infected, or heavily 
infected with hookworm disease.

Measures of Mentality Employed in Queensland Study. 
The method of selection on the basis of stool examinations kept a 
constant factor of other causes of retardation, such as hereditary 
mental defects, syphilis transmitted from parents, parental alcohol- 
ism, tonsils and adenoids, and so forth. The tests were applied by 
the nurse, without knowledge as to what result the microscopic 
examination of the child’s feces had yielded. Goddard’s revision of 
the Binet-Simon tests, the Porteus mazes, and a special modified dot- 
counting test were employed in gauging the mentality of the children. 
In using the Binet-Simon tests, special adjustments were made to 
adapt them to Australian children. From thirty-five to forty 
minutes were taken for applying the tests to each child. 
Findings of Queensland Mental Retardation Study. Figs. 
22 and 23 exhibit graphically the principal facts disclosed by the 
survey. Lightly infected cases had, on the average, a retardation of 
9.3 months in their mental development as measured by the Binet- 
Simon tests, and of 4.9 months as measured by the Porteus; while 
heavily infected cases were retarded 23.4 months as measured by 
Binet and 16.6 months as measured by Porteus. The longer the 
infection had persisted in the child, the greater was the retardation 
found to be. Thus, in infected children eight years old the retarda- 
tion was only 6.6 months, while in those eleven years old it was 19.0 
months and in those fourteen years old, 25.9 months. In extreme 
cases accompanied by the most severe types of individual infection, 
a retardation of as much as five years was recorded.

DIAGNOSIS OF HOOKWORM INFECTION 
Work for the relief and control of hookworm disease, to be of the 
greatest value, must be conducted in such manner that its benefits 
may not only reach the more advanced and prosperous peoples, but 
also extend to the many millions of primitive folk who inhabit the 
more remote and inaccessible regions of the ‘earth. This means that 
field activities must often be carried out under conditions far from 
ideal. In all of the work the aim has been to achieve accuracy and 
simplicity. Ifthe latter requirement is to be met, the apparatus and 
equipment cannot be elaborate, nor should extensive preliminary 
training on the part of the examiners be necessary. At all times the 
cost of the work must be kept within the means of the masses. 
  Methods of Diagnosing the Infection. The disease may be 
diagnosed by administering a vermifuge and searching the stools 
for hookworms, or the vermifuge may be omitted and specimens of 
feces may be microscopically examined for ova. It has been cus- 
tomary to rely almost entirely upon several variations of the latter 
method. There are also various culture methods for demonstrating 
the infection, but these are hardly practicable for extensive use in 
the field. 
How Fecal Specimens are Received and Examined. When 
microscopic examination of the feces is the basis for demonstrating 
the disease, every person in an infected area who desires to know 
whether he has hookworm disease is invited to submit a specimen of 
his feces for examination. For this purpose small tin boxes about one 
inch in diameter, with the lid of each properly marked for identifi- 
cation, are supplied. Every effort is made to insure careful and 
accurate diagnosis of the specimens submitted. In each country 
the examiners are native young men who have been especially selected 
for their reliability and later trained in the detection of ova. The 
specimens found negative by one man are in almost all cases re-exam- 
ined by one or two others, and head examiners are usually employed 
to watch over the work and safeguard the accuracy of the results. 
MICROSCOPIC DIAGNOSIS WITH PLAIN SMEAR 
Until 1914 the plain smear method of microscopic examination 
was used almost exclusively.. This consists of the careful search of 
not less than three smears from each specimen before pronouncing 
free of infection the person who submitted it. The glass slides on 
which the smears are examined measure not less than one by three 
130 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
   INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD ror 
inches. The disadvantage of this method lies in the fact that it 
requires more time for thorough examination than can be devoted 
to each specimen. Furthermore, the specimens themselves are too 
small to yield entirely trustworthy results. Nevertheless the method 
is fairly satisfactory when large or moderate numbers of the para- 
sites are harbored. 
DIAGNOSIS WITH THE AID OF THE CENTRIFUGE 
When only a few worms are in the intestines, the number of 
eggs in the feces is, of course, correspondingly reduced. It then 
becomes necessary to employ a ready means of concentrating the 
eggs, not merely to facilitate 
the search but also to assure a 
greater degree of accuracy in 
the findings. In recent years 
a multiple-tube hand centri- 
fuge, which goes far toward 
meeting these needs, has come 
into general use. When this 
machine is employed, two or 
three slides from each specimen 
are first examined by the or- 
dinary plain smear method. 
Those specimens which seem 
to be negative by this process 
are set aside and centrifuged 
in groups of twenty; and from 
the concentrated sediment 
thus obtained, two or three 
slides are usually prepared from 
each specimen for further ex- 
amination with the microscope. 
Experiments have shown that 
the number of specimens 
found positive is about twenty 
per cent higher when the cen- . . mens. ! 
trifuge a used than when the (Top) Stewart panhead, with specimen ordinary plain smear method tubes in position i i (Bottom) Shaft, showing manner of

Accuracy of Centrifuge Method. The accuracy of the centri- 
fuge method, like that of the plain smear method, depends primarily 
upon a fecal sample that is too small to yield entirely trustworthy 
results. The Board’s Uncinariasis Commission to the Orient found, 
in the Federated Malay States and in Fiji, that when the same 
groups of persons were examined first by the centrifuge method and 
  Fig. 24.—Special type of hand 
centrifuge used in examining speci-

  132 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
later by administering a vermifuge and straining the stools for worms, 
the microscope showed only from 75 to 85 per cent of the persons 
examined to be infected, while diagnosis by vermifuge revealed from 
97 to 100 per cent. It seems well within conservative bounds to 
estimate that in examinations both before and after treatment,’ 
diagnosis by microscopic examination, aided by the centrifuge, 
yields evidence of infection varying from 4 to 25 per cent less than 
actually exists. In support of this statement the evidence afforded 
by experiments made in Brazil during 1918 may be cited. 
Summary of Experiments in Brazil during 1918. One 
hundred two among the total of 280 test cases treated in Brazil 
during 1918 were reported negative on original microscopic exam- 
ination, giving a percentage of infection of 63.9. All 102 of the 
negative cases were later treated and fifty-six of them expelled 
worms, thus indicating that the actual rate of infection was not less 
than 83.6. All of the original examinations were made by trained 
microscopists with the aid of the centrifuge, yet the result shows a 
difference of 19.7 per cent in favor of diagnosis by vermifuge. The 
fifty-six cases incorrectly diagnosed yielded 716 worms, or thirteen 
per infected case. One of the cases declared negative on microscopic 
examination expelled as many as 115 worms. 
GLYCERINE-SALT PROCESS OF EXAMINATION 
It seems that infections which escape detection by the combined 
plain smear and centrifuge methods represent cases which harbor 
comparatively few worms. Nevertheless it is of considerable im- 
portance that these mild infections should be correctly diagnosed. 
Two special techniques of examination have lately been developed 
to meet this need: the glycerine-salt and the brine flotation-loop 
methods. Both make use of specific gravity as an aid in correct 
diagnosis. The former was developed by Dr. M. A. Barber in his 
work in the Federated Malay States and was used by the medical 
officer in charge of the work in Siam in examining 31,298 specimens 
in that country up to December 31, 1918. The results obtained 
from its use are reported to be extremely satisfactory. 
Process of Examining by Glycerine-Salt Method. In using 
the glycerine-salt technique, a diluting fluid composed of equal parts 
of a saturated solution of magnesium sulphate and glycerine is pre- 
pared. This fluid is dropped from a large dropping-bottle into the 
small tin box which contains the specimen. The fecal mass is 
thoroughly stirred and broken up with a toothpick, which releases 
“the ova and causes them to rise to the surface. The upper part of 
the fluid in each container is poured upon a two-by-three-inch glass 
microscope slide which has been rimmed with paraffin or grease, and

the surface of the slide is searched for eggs. The entire contents of a 
container may be examined by preparing three or four of these 
slides. The process regularly followed is to examine two slides 
before and two after centrifuging the specimen. The glycerine-salt 
diluting fluid is used in preparing all four of the slides, including those 
made before as well as after centrifuging. 
Advantages of the Glycerine-Salt Method. The number of 
ova\brought upon the slide by the glycerine-salt method is so greatly 
increased that the eggs may be much more easily found than when 
the plain smear method is used. This reduces the number of speci- 
mens that have to be run through the more time-consuming process 
of centrifuging and results in a great saving of time. This is an 
especially important consideration in regions like Siam, where the | 
individual infection is so mild that when the plain smear method is 
used it is often necessary to prepare from ten to twelve slides from a 
single specimen and to spend from twenty to thirty minutes in order 
to make a diagnosis. 
Comparative Accuracy of Plain Smear and Glycerine-Salt 
Methods. Forty-five test specimens were examined personally by 
the director of the work in Siam, using first the plain smear and then 
the glycerine-salt method. Two slides from each specimen. were 
examined by both methods; in neither case was the centrifuge used 
asanaid. The percentage of persons found infected in examinations 
by the plain smear method was 23.3 on the first and 12.2 on the 
second slide, or 35.5 for the two slides combined. By the glycerine- 
salt method it was 84.4 on the first and 2.2 on the second, or 86.6 for 
both slides. With the plain slide technique a total of thirty-six ova 
were found on all ninety of the slides examined; with the glycerine- 
salt technique, a total of 4.48. 
A later series of forty-three specimens was examined by the two 
methods, but a second slide was prepared only when the first proved 
negative and no record was kept of the number of eggs discovered. 
In this series the percentage found positive by the plain slide method 
was 37.2, as compared with 67.4 by the glycerine-salt method. For 
both series, embracing eighty-eight specimens in all, the percentage of 
positive findings by the two methods was 27.5 and 77.2, respectively. 
Accuracy of the Plain Slide, Centrifuge, and Glycerine-Salt 
Methods Compared. Twenty-seven of the eighty-eight specimens 
just mentioned were examined in rotation by the plain slide, centri- 
fuge, and glycerine-salt methods. In this series, record of the num- 
ber of ova discovered was omitted and a second slide was not pre- 
pared if the first proved positive. The results showed that the 
glycerine-salt was the most accurate of the three methods. The 
findings were as follows: 40.7 per cent positive by the plain slide, 
55.5 by the centrifuge, and 70.2 by the glycerine-salt method,

136 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
BRINE FLOTATION-LOOP METHOD OF EXAMINATION 
During 1918 Majors Kofoid and Barber developed a special tech- 
nique known as the “brine flotation-loop method,” and employed 
it in examining for hookworm disease the soldiers in the Southern 
Department of the United States Army.!_ This method is in part an 
outgrowth of experience with the glycerine-salt method just de- 
scribed, and in this respect may be accepted as an improvement 
over that technique. In the army medical work it was used by 
about seventy-five examiners in making more than 100,000 examina- 
tions under field conditions, and was found to be rapid, efficient, 
practicable, and especially valuable in diagnosing light infections. 
Technique of Examination with Brine Flotation-Loop 
Method. The process followed in making examinations by this 
method is to mix a large fecal sample thoroughly in concentrated 
brine in a paraffin paper container of from 50 to 75 mils (two to three 
ounces) capacity. The coarse float is forced below the surface by 
means of a disk of No. 9 steel wool and the container is allowed to 
stand one hour for the ova to ascend. The surface film is then 
wiped off with wire loops one-half inch in diameter and examined on 
a slide without a cover glass. The ova of hookworm and of other 
parasites are floated up by the brine into the surface layer of the 
pool without distortion or noticeable change in appearance. 
Advantage of Flotation-Loop Process. The great advantage 
of this method is believed to lie in its easy utilization of large samples. 
With containers of sufficient size, receptacles for mixing the entire 
stool may be employed. This eliminates the element of random 
sampling except in so far as this may be due to irregular egg-laying 
by the female worms or to an unequal discharge of eggs in successive 
stools. It insures also a sufficient number of ova to make detection 
possible in light infections which may be overlooked by other meth- 
ods using smaller samples. It is for this reason a more accurate 
means of diagnosis. In addition, it is reported to be about 50 per 
cent more rapid than the centrifuge method. 
Accuracy of Flotation-Loop Process. The accuracy of this 
method depends on a number of variables, including the size and 
consistency of the specimen, the thoroughness of stirring, the amount 
of steel wool used, the care in looping, the opacity of the fluid, and 
the extent and thoroughness of the search made of the material on 
the slide. Eight lots of fifty specimens each, which had been exam- 
ined once, were set aside and subsequently re-examined for the pur- 
pose of ascertaining what proportion of light infections had escaped 
detection. The specimens were all from companies of soldiers in

which there was light and therefore presumably easily-overlooked 
infection, and all had been found negative on the first examination. 
The top float of each lot of fifty cans was drawn off into a tall cylin- 
dric liter graduate, and the surface film of this column examined. 
The cans had stood, after stirring, for not less than two or three hours. 
In order to avoid entangling any ova that might be present, no brine 
from thick or viscous stools was used. Only one specimen among all 
eight lots, or one in four hundred negatives, was found positive on 
second examination. From this it appears that the number of 
positives escaping detection by this method is practically negligible. 
IMPRACTICABILITY OF SCIENTIFICALLY EXACT 
DIAGNOSIS 
When a person is declared free of infection on microscopic examina- 
tion, the term is used in a relative sense to indicate that the number 
of worms in the intestines is so low that no ova can be discovered in 
the feces. This does not necessarily mean that there is not a single 
hookworm present. Male worms may still be harbored, as there is 
no possible way of knowing that there are none of these except by 
administering repeated treatments and washing the stools after 
each treatment. Nor is it possible to say that not a single female 
worm inhabits the intestinal tract unless specimens of stool are 
examined every day for many days. But it can be stated definitely 
that if careful examination by the methods in use fails to show the 
presence of ova, the number of worms remaining is very small. 
If patients were willing to submit two or three specimens for exami- 
nation, the removal of every parasite could be more definitely predi- 
cated, but this would entail a large amount of additional work and 
present many difficulties if attempted under field conditions.

METHODS OF TREATING HOOKWORM DISEASE 
The treatment of hookworm disease is gradually becoming stand- 
ardized. It is now generally agreed that a purgative and a vermi- 
fuge are required. The purgative is usually administered in two 
portions, the first being given before and the second after the vermi- 
fuge has been taken, though some authors do not regard the prelimi- 
nary purge as necessary. Most authorities state, however, that the 
first purgative dose is useful in eliminating the mucous and other sub- 
stances which surround the worms in the intestines and protect them 
from the action of the vermifuge. The latter is supposed to kill or 
poison the worms and cause them to release their hold on the intesti- 
nal wall. A second dose of the purgative is then administered to 
sweep the worms and the vermifuge from the intestines. 
Drugs Used in Treatment. The principal remedies used are 
chloroform, eucalyptus, beta-naphthol, thymol, and oil of cheno- 
podium. A new drug known as carvacrol was tried during 1918, 
but the results attending its use were reported as unsatisfactory. Of 
the five drugs most extensively employed, thymol and oil of chenopo- 
dium have proved themselves superior to all the others under field 
conditions. Chenopodium during recent years has been gaining 
steadily in favor as a remedy for hookworm disease. 
Properties of Chenopodium Not Fully Understood. It’ 
seems, however, that there are on the market a number of varieties 
of this drug which differ greatly in their strength and toxicity. The 
variations in different samples are especially noticeable in the 
chemical composition of the oil, and are exhibited in its appearance, 
taste, smell, specific gravity, and volatility. A better pharmaco- 
peial standard seems highly desirable. Thorough investigation of the 
cultivation of the plants from which the oil is distilled, of the phar- 
maceutical preparation of the oil, and of its properties after distilla- 
tion, is required to assure a uniform and standard product and a 
safe routine of administration. The tests should also include, among 
other things, a careful and detailed investigation of the effect of the 
drug not merely on animals but on adults and children of different 
ages and in varying states of health. Although during 1918 scarcely 
any ;untoward results were reported by the United States army 
medical service or in the Board’s work, yet it is believed desirable 
to repeat the earlier caution, that in giving the oil to children the 
dose should be made smaller than is indicated by Young’s rule, and 
that medical officers should exercise careful supervision over the 
administration of the oil in the field.

INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 139 
STANDARD TECHNIQUE OF THYMOL ADMINISTRATION 
The routine dosage of thymol recommended by Stiles, Dock, 
Howard, Bass, and others of wide experience in the treatment of 
hookworm disease, is the one most commonly employed in the 
countries where thymol is used. It is based upon sixty grains as the 
maximum for an adult, preceded and followed by an active saline 
purgative. Children from one to five years of age receive from 3 to 
5 grains of the thymol; those from six to ten, from 10 to 15 grains; 
and those from eleven to fifteen, from 15 to 30 grains. Persons 
between sixteen and twenty years of age receive from 30 to 40 
grains; those between twenty-one and fifty years, from 45 to 60 
grains; and those more than fifty years, from 30 to 45 grains. The 
drug is administered in two equally divided portions, and apparent 
(not. actual) age determines the dosage. Competent physicians 
examine all patients who are to take the drug, prescribe the 
proper dosage for each, and supervise the important phases of 
the treatment. 
Conditions Governing Administration of Thymol. Food 
is not allowed from the time of the first purgative until after the 
final dose of salts has acted. Inasmuch as alcohol and oils, and 
gravy, butter, milk, or other fatty foods, are especially dangerous, 
the patient is cautioned against taking them at any time during the 
period of treatment. Under field conditions it is also necessary to 
withhold thymol from persons suffering from acute diseases such as 
malaria in the febrile stage or fevers of any other type; those having 
chronic dysentery or diarrhea, organic cardiac or renal disease, pul- 
monary tuberculosis beyond the incipient stage, or general anasarca; 
those who are extremely weak or feeble from old age or from other 
cause; and pregnant women, or women with serious hemorrhagic 
diseases of the uterus. Thymol may be administered to persons 
suffering from any of these diseases only when the circumstances will 
permit rigid control of all features connected with the treatment. 
USE OF CHENOPODIUM AS AN ANTHELMINTIC 
Oil of chenopodium is now used more extensively than thymol in 
all countries with which the Board co-operates except Panama, 
British Guiana, Trinidad, and Saint Lucia. Its comparatively low 
cost and the relative scarcity of thymol brought about by the World 
War have doubtless been factors in some measure leading to its wide- 
spread use. Following the reduction in dosage recommended by the 
Board’s Uncinariasis Commission to the Orient, the drug was em- 
ployed in administering 437,166 treatments to 191,377 persons dur- 
ing 1918, and gave exceptionally favorable results.

STANDARD METHOD OF ADMINISTERING 
CHENOPODIUM 
The standard method of administering chenopodium as used by 
the Board during 1918 was that, recommended by Darling, Barber, 
and Hacker as a result of their experiences with various vermicidal 
drugs in the Orient and published in their article entitled “The 
Treatment of Hookworm Infection.” It consists of an adult dose 
of 13 mils (by weight),? divided into three equal parts and adminis- 
tered the first portion at 7:00 a.m., the second at 8:00 a.m., and the 
third at 9:00 a.m. A light evening meal followed by a purgative 
dose of magnesium sulphate is usually given on the evening preceding 
treatment, and a very light breakfast, consisting of milk. or thin 
rice gruel, on the morning of treatment. Two hours after the last 
portion of chenopodium is taken, a second purgative dose of mag- 
nesium sulphate is administered. Effective post-treatment purga- 
tion is thought to be essential to eliminate the dead or stunned 
worms and the unabsorbed oil. A second post-treatment purgative 
should be given if the first fails to act freely and promptly. 
Schedule of Dosage for Children and Adults. The directors 
of the work in Ceylon, who have made extensive use of the drug in 
small doses, have worked out a dosage table for children and adults. 
Children who appear to be between the ages of two and twelve 
years receive 1 minim for each year of age, minus 1 minim. This 
means that a child of seven receives 6 minims, a child of six 5 minims, 
and so on. Persons from thirteen to fourteen years of age receive 
13 minims; those from fifteen to sixteen, 16 minims; from seventeen 
to eighteen, 20 minims; and from nineteen to twenty, 24 minims. 
It will be noted that especially small doses are administered to 
children under twelve. The oil is dropped from a dropping-bottle 
into simple sugar syrup. In Ceylon this has proved the most satis- 
factory of all the vehicles in which the oil has been administered. 
The directors of the work in this country also report that in addition 
to the contraindications to thymol treatment mentioned on page 139, 
the use of chenopodium is contraindicated when the patient has 
peptic ulcers or gonorrhea. 
Efficiency of Standard Chenopodium Treatment. The 
director and the assistant director of the newly established Depart 
ment of Hygiene at the University of Sao Paulo, assisted by the staff 
engaged in hookworm control measures in Brazil, made considerable 
progress during the year toward establishing the probable average 
efficiency of the foregoing dosage under field conditions. In the 
original experiments, made in the Orient under laboratory conditions,

mately 2 drops by measure.  
-P-A-G-E-139
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 141i 
two standard chenopodium treatments, separated by an interval of 
ten days, removed 99 per cent of all the hookworms harbored by a 
group of thirty-nine adults. One hundred fifty-six cases were 
similarly treated in Brazil during 1918, except that the work was 
done largely under field conditions, and 97 per cent of the worms they 
harbored were removed. Thus the Brazilian experiments confirmed, 
in so far as the smallness of the numbers involved may be accepted 
as confirming, the tests made in the Orient. A large amount of addi- 
tional field experience will need to be gained, however, before the 
entire practicability and efficiency of the routine treatment may be 
regarded as definitely established. One of the factors remaining for 
further investigation is the apparent difference in power of resisting 
treatment between the Ancylostome and the Necator americanus, 
and between persons who harbor large numbers of worms and those 
who harbor only a few. 
a. Experiments with standard technique among Brazilian vagabonds. 
Eighty-two vagabonds more than fourteen years of age, who lived 
at an institution in Pinheiro, in the State of Rio de Janeiro, were 
treated three times with cheno- 
podium. The first two treat- 
ments consisted of 13 mils each 
and the third of 3 mils.! These 
treatments expelled a total of 
10,895 worms: Fig. 27 shows 
the efficiency of each treatment 
as based on two factors: the 
percentage of worms expelled 
and the percentage of cases 
cured. In this group there 
were only nine relative’ fail- 
ures of the treatment, or cases 
which harbored ten or more 
worms after two 1} mils treat- 
ments had been taken. The 
conditions of this experiment, 
however, permitted a rigid con- 
trol of the patients and ap- 
proached the exactness of a Theat: Teak Vsecbepat ati 
laboratory test. The results, WORMS PERSONS: 
therefore, may not be ac- ema ae

142 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
b. Tests on heavily infected farm and in lightly infected village. 
Two trials were made in Atibaia, Brazil, to determine the efficacy 
of the standard treatment as administered under field conditions by 
regular campaign dispensers. In the first test, two localities were 
chosen: a severely infected farm and a mildly infected village. 
Ten persons in each locality were selected for the test. All received 
two routine treatments of chenopodium from the dispensers. Two 
weeks after they had taken the last of these two treatments, they 
were given a large 3 mils test dose of chenopodium. In the farm 
group there still remained 134 worms, or 13 per case, after the first 
two 14 mils treatments had acted; in the city group, 7, or .7 per case. 
There were 50 per cent of relative failures among the farm residents. 
The number of worms harbored by this group before treatment was 
undoubtedly high, however, as two controls on the same farm who, 
before receiving the 3 mils dose, had been treated only once with 
14 mils, expelled as a result of the second treatment an average 
of 148 worms apiece. 
c. Experiments on typical coffee farm. In the third experiment 
fifty-six persons living on a large, typical coffee plantation in the 
State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, who had already been treated twice in the 
routine way by campaign dispensers, were given, twelve days later, 
a single large dose of chenopodium. These cases were found to 
harbor, on the average, 5.8 worms per case after they had taken the 
first two treatments, while four control cases treated for the first 
time averaged 176 worms per case. In 41 per cent of the cases every 
worm was expelled by the first two treatments; in 21 per cent there 
was relative failure of the drug. 
Interval Between Treatment with Chenopodium and 
Re-examination. Chenopodium has a distinctly inhibitory effect 
upon the egg-bearing functions of the female hookworm. A series 
of test cases conducted during 1918 by a special nurse in the city 
hospital of Sao Paulo showed that after treatment with chenopodium 
the ova disappeared from the feces and, if the cases were not cured, 
re-appeared the eighth to thirteenth day. This confirmed the 
findings of earlier investigators. All who have studied the subject 
agree that re-examination should be made in not less than fourteen 
days after the vermifuge has been taken. This is the period cus- 
tomarily allowed in the countries where chenopodium is used. 
Need of Satisfactory Purgative for Use with Oil of Cheno- 
podium. None of the purgatives which have been employed in 
connection with chenopodium treatment have given entirely satis- 
factory results. Of those which have been tried, magnesium sul- 
phate is the one which has been reported upon most favorably. 
Omission of Preliminary Purge. Better results are apparently 
obtained if the pre-treatment purgative is given; and in hospital 
practice, where the patient can rest and is under constant observa-
-P-A-G-E-141
  
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 143 
tion, it seems best to give it. But when it is given in field work, 
many of the patients, after it has acted, become weak and in some 
instances are unfit for work next day, with the result that they 
lodge complaints against the treatment. The original experiments of 
Darling, Barber, and Hacker, although dealing with a number of 
cases too small to enable trustworthy conclusions to be drawn from 
them, nevertheless showed that when this purge was omitted and the 
other factors were kept the same as in routine treatment, two stand- 
ard doses of 14 mils of chenopodium cured 80 per cent of the cases 
and removed 95 per cent of the total worms. This suggested that 
with an interval of twelve hours between eating and the adminis- 
tration of the vermifuge, the preliminary purge might be omitted. 
CHENOPODIUM-CROTON OIL TREATMENT AS 
DEVELOPED IN CEYLON 
In Ceylon a special form of treatment which omits the preliminary 
purge, has been developed and is now being extensively employed 
in estate and village work. It is unquestionably more acceptable to 
the patients. Some of its best features are that smaller doses of 
salts are required to secure effective post-treatment purgation, there 
is less exhaustion, the after-effects—consisting of rheumatoid pains, 
tinnitus, etc.—are much less in evidence, and in almost all cases the 
patients are able to work the following day. 
Routine Administration of Chenopodium-Croton Oil. 
When this method is employed, a light meal of rice gruel is allowed 
the evening before treatment. At 6:00 o’clock next morning a small 
cup of konje is taken. At 6:30 a.m. the vermifuge (a mixture of 
chenopodium 40 parts and croton oil 1 part) is given in the standard 
dosage prescribed for chenopodium (see page 140), graduated accord- 
ing to the apparent and not the stated age of each person. The dose 
is usually given in two equal parts with an interval of one hour 
between. Two hours after the whole of the vermicide has been 
taken, the patient receives a purgative dose of magnesium sulphate. 
Conditions Governing Chenopodium-Croton Oil Treatment. 
All patients are kept under observation by the dispenser from the 
time of giving the first portion of the vermicide until the medical 
officer in charge is satisfied that the post-treatment purgative has 
acted freely. Meanwhile, the patients are allowed to rest in a shel- 
tered place. Temporary sheltered latrines for men and women are 
provided near the resting-place, and an apothecary or dispenser sees 
that the latrines are properly used. Before the patients are dis- 
charged, they are strongly counselled not to eat raw fruit or vege- 
tables for a day or two after treatment, but to take chiefly rice and 
rice gruel.
-P-A-G-E-142
  144 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
ADMINISTRATION OF CHENOPODIUM IN UNDIVIDED 
DOSES 
In an experiment conducted by the Uncinariasis Commission to the 
Orient, 2 mils of chenopodium administered in two equally divided 
doses removed 96.2 per cent of the worms harbored by eight cases, 
while the same amount of the drug administered in a single massive 
dose expelled 95.8 per cent of the worms in twenty-five other cases. 
The similarity of these figures suggested that it was probably un- 
necessary to divide the dose. Experiments to determine this point 
were made by the directors of the work in several countries during 
1918. 
Experience in Seychelles Islands and in Ceylon. The 
medical officer in charge of the work in the Seychelles Islands admin- 
istered to a limited number of cases the full daily dose of chenopo- 
dium at 6:00 a.m., without preliminary purgation, but the results 
obtained were not so good as when the regular routine of chenopo- 
dium treatment was followed. In Ceylon, similarly, the entire 
amount of chenopodium in one dose was administered experimentally 
on a number of estates. The method is still under trial, but the 
directors report that it does not appear suitable for use where there 
is heavy infection. 
Experience in China. The director in China, on the other 
hand, has made extensive use of a single 2 mil dose, and in a group 
of experimental cases obtained satisfactory results, the percentage 
of cures after one treatment being approximately 87.0. The ex- 
perience in that country indicates that chenopodium in this dosage 
is seldom contraindicated. Persons with active tuberculosis, moder- 
ate heart lesions, and acute bronchitis have been treated and have 
shown no ill-effects. It should be pointed out, however, that all the 
patients dealt with are male adults between eighteen and fifty years 
of age, and that the doses of salts used are larger than are customarily 
administered in other countries. 
EFFECT OF PURGATIVE ON EFFICIENCY OF 
REMEDY 
Tests made in China during 1918 suggest that the réle played by 
the purgative in removing the worms from the intestines, and the 
full effect of chenopodium on hookworms, considered from the 
therapeutical standpoint, are two extremely important phases of 
treatment which have perhaps not been sufficiently investigated. 
It was noticed that the percentage of living worms expelled was 
increased if the salts acted quickly. This meant either that longer
-P-A-G-E-143
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD | 145 
contact with chenopodium kills a larger percentage of worms, or 
that in many cases the drug temporarily loosens the hold of the 
worm on the intestinal wall so that a strong purgative may expel 
many living worms. A series of observations was then made to 
ascertain what effect an increase in the dose of magnesium sulphate 
had on the percentage of cures. 
Increased Efficiency of Chenopodium with Free Purgation. 
The amount of chenopodium used was an undivided dose of 2 mils. 
At first 25 mils (one ounce) of magnesium sulphate was administered 
the evening before treatment, and 50 mils two hours after the 
chenopodium had been taken. Of 395 infected persons treated 
by this method, 286, or 72.4 per cent, were found negative after one 
treatment. The results were so good that the amount of salts was 
increased to 50 mils instead of 25 on the evening before treatment, 
and to 141 mils (four and two-thirds ounces) instead of fifty after the, 
taking of the chenopodium. The salts given after the vermifuge 
were divided into two portions, one-half being administered at the 
end of two hours and the other half at the end of four. Of 620 per- 
sons treated in this way, 499, or 80.5 per cent, were found negative 
after one treatment. With the increase in the amount of salts given, 
there was not one case which showed any symptoms of chenopodium 
absorption. There were nausea and vomiting at times, but there 
were no ill effects due to the action of chenopodium. 
USE OF CHENOPODIUM IN TREATMENT OF AMEBIC 
DYSENTERY 
In a number of countries oil of chenopodium is now being regularly 
employed in the treatment of dysentery. It is reported to remove 
encysted ameba, to cause the disappearance of blood and mucus from 
the feces, and to give prompt relief to the patient. 
Routine Chenopodium Treatment for Relief of Dysentery. 
In Siam the treatment is used as follows: 37 mils (one and one-half 
ounces) of magnesium sulphate are first given. T'wo hours later 1 mil 
of oil of chenopodium follows. One hour later a similar dose of the 
oil is administered, followed in another hour by 37 mils (one and one- 
half ounces) of castor oil. For more severe cases either the pre- 
liminary purgative is omitted and 2 mils of chenopodium in 37 mils 
__ of castor oil are given in a single dose, or 1 mil of oil of chenopodium, 
emulsified with gum acacia, is administered by way of the rectum. In 
the latter mode of treatment the anal mucosa is protected by petrola- 
tum and the injections are terminated with 50 mils (two ounces) of 
an inert oil. The buttocks are elevated, and the enema—the first 
dose of which does not exceed 200 mils (eight ounces) for an adult— 
is given slowly.

146 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
MANNER OF DETERMINING RELATIVE EFFICIENCY 
OF DRUGS 
The proportion of infected persons cured by two treatments does 
not always convey an adequate idea of how efficient a remedy is. 
‘Two treatments of a powerful vermicide may remove from a large 
proportion of cases all but two or three per cent of the worms they 
harbor, and still fail to effect the complete cure of any considerable 
number of the patients. Thus, in a series of experimental cases, 
two treatments of chenopodium, each consisting of 1} mils, have 
expelled more than 95 per cent of the hookworms harbored and 
yet cured only from 40 to 50 per cent of the cases. To effect the 
complete cure of all infected persons required, on the average, four 
treatments of the drug. This meant that the additional two treat- 
ments were used to expel less than 5 per cent of the worms originally 
harbored. | 
Efficiency as Estimated by Percentage of Worms Removed. 
For judging the efficacy of a drug the percentage of worms expelled 
is a better criterion than the percentage of cures obtained. It affords 
a satisfactory measure of efficiency in districts where there is mod- 
erate or severe infection distributed with a fair degree of uniformity 
among various classes of the population. But where the infection 
is mild and there are a few carriers with a disproportionately large 
number of worms to dominate the results, its value is not so great. 
One of the chief advantages of the method lies in the fact that the

worm count is a positive finding, all errors tending to decrease the 
apparent efficiency of the drug; while in estimating efficiency by 
cures, all errors of omission, due to faults inherent in the methods of 
diagnosis followed, tend to enhance the apparent value of the remedy 
by fictitiously increasing the number of cases registered as cured. 
Knowlton’s Method of Determining Efficiency. By adding 
the percentages of worms removed from each member of a group of 
infected individuals and dividing the total of these percentages by the 
number of individuals comprising the group, a fairly good index may 
be obtained. This is open to the objection, however, that the case 
with one worm counts for as much as the one with a thousand. 
Knowlton therefore recommends combining this method with the one 
whereby efficiency is determined on the basis of the percentage of 
worms removed from the group. The two percentage figures thus 
derived are averaged, and a figure obtained that is believed to give 
the most satisfactory index of efficiency of any method yet evolved. 
Fig. 28, page 146, illustrates this method of obtaining the efficiency 
index as applied to a supposititious group of eight cases.

HOOKWORM INFECTION SURVEYS 
The Board’s participation in measures against hookworm disease 
in any state or country is contingent upon official invitation from 
Government. Asa preliminary step to the arrangement of a definite 
program, it is customary for an infection survey to be made of the 
territory. This survey defines the geographical prevalence and 
distribution of the disease and the practicability of its control, makes 
available data concerning the insanitary conditions which are respon- 
sible for the presence and spread of the infection, and furnishes 
information relative to the public health or other agencies through 
which systematic efforts against the disease may be begun with 
greatest promise of success. Thus it gives to Government and to the 
Board definite information upon which a satisfactory working agree- 
ment may be based. This information is also of much assistance 
when the measures designed to reduce the incidence and severity of 
the disease are put into operation. 
Infection Surveys Completed or Authorized. During 1918, 
three complete infection surveys were concluded. One of these was 
in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, another in Jamaica, and the third 
in the United States Pacific possession, Guam. A fourth survey, 
begun in June in Minas Geraes, one of the largest states in Brazil, 
had not been completed by the end of the year. Other surveys 
were authorized but not begun during the year in the Brazilian 
States of Bahia, Parana, and Maranhao, and in the Province of 
Madras, in India. 
INFECTION SURVEY OF JAMAICA 
The infection survey of the Cayman Islands (a dependency of 
Jamaica) made during the spring of 1917, resulted in the Govern- 
ment’s appropriating approximately $12,000 for carrying out a co- 
operative campaign against the disease in Jamaica proper. As an 
initial step in the measures of control an infection survey of the Island 
was made during June and July of 1918. 
Findings of the Survey. The survey indicated that probably 
two of every three inhabitants of Jamaica have hookworm disease. 
The distribution of the infection by parishes is roughly indicated by _ 
the accompanying map. (Fig. 29). High infection rates were also 
recorded for round-worms and thread-worms, the former being found 
in 67.2 per cent of the 10,926 persons examined and the latter in 
35.9 per cent. In the larger towns and cities, which are located on

the coast, a beginning has been made toward the proper disposal of 
excrement, but in the rural districts soil contamination is practically 
universal. There are laws requiring a latrine at every home, but no 
serious attempt has been made to enforce them. 
Inauguration of Control Measures. The survey is to be fol- 
lowed by a series of demonstrations in control measures. The work- 
ing arrangement provides that Government is to share the expense 
of the initial field posts and to have suitable latrines installed in all 
areas in advance of examination and treatment. Government has 
made available approximately $7,500 as a first appropriation for 
this purpose. 
PREVALENCE OF HOOKWORM DISEASE IN GUAM 
At the request of the Surgeon General of the Navy, a hookworm 
infection survey of Guam was made in May, 1918. Microscopic 
examination of 857 natives resident in various parts of the Island, 
representing 7 per cent of its total population, showed 71 per cent to 
be infected. The disease is relatively mild in type. No cases were 
found in which the infection was severe enough to cause retardation 
of growth, edema, or ulceration. | ‘ 
Soil pollution is not prevalent throughout the Island. Where it 
exists it can be prevented through the use of a simple type of latrine 
well within the resources of the natives. The Navy has sufficient 
personnel, drugs, and other facilities available for treating parasitic 
infections and for carrying out thoroughgoing measures of control 
with practically no outlay beyond the routine expenditures now 
being incurred.

SURVEY OF SAO PAULO, BRAZIL 
An infection survey of the State of Sao Paulo was made between 
December 1, 1917, and February 28, 1918. Eleven towns and two 
coffee plantations in representative parts of the State were selected 
as centers for carrying out the survey. The number of persons 
examined was 8,751, and 58.9 per cent were found to be infected. 
Four of every five persons harbored either hookworm or another type 
of intestinal parasite. 
Relationship of. Soil to Percentage of Infection. The 
character of soil in different regions was found to have an important 
bearing on the percentage of hookworm infection: the less sandy and 
absorbent the soil, the lower was the rate of infection recorded. In 
three towns built on compact red clay, the average percentage of 
infection was only 43.7, as compared with an average of 63.8 per 
cent for four towns built on slightly sandy soil, and of 75.0 for two 
coffee plantations where the soil was the most sandy and most por- 
ous of all the areas surveyed.

Effect of Use of Latrines on Infection Rates. Classification of 
the persons examined with respect to the latrine accommodations at 
their homes showed that the highest rate of hookworm infection was 
among 6,631 persons who stated that they had no latrine accommo-

dation whatsoever. In this group the rate was 62 per cent. Com- 
pared with this, the average rate for those who had latrine accommo- 
dations, whether good or bad, was 48 per cent. The rate among 
those who used septic tanks or had sewer connections was only 
37 per cent, the lowest recorded for any of the groups. 
Inauguration of Comprehensive Program for Control. At 
the close of the survey, or on March 9, 1918, intensive operations for 
the control of the disease were begun at Guarulhos, a rural area 
located near the capital city of Sao Paulo. Meanwhile the Director 
of the Public Health Service offered, on behalf of the State, to organ- 
ize and maintain five posts for the control of the disease if the Board 
would maintain two. A second post was thereupon established at 
Atibaia on July 9, and the State opened one of its five posts in June, 
two in August, and two in September. At the close of 1918 seven 
posts, each with its own staff of physicians, dispensers, and sanitary 
inspectors, were attacking the disease simultaneously from strategic 
centers throughout the State. The five posts established by the 
State were maintained during 1918 at a cost of approximately 
$60,000. 
INFECTION SURVEY BASED ON WORM COUNTS 
A new type of infection survey, making worm counts its central 
feature, was developed by the Board’s Uncinariasis Commission to 
the Orient. This was employed in carrying out the survey of Java 
in 1916 and has since come into extensive use in Brazil. The cus- 
tomary microscopic examination of fecal specimens is dispensed with, 
and the counting of worms expelled as the result of treatment by 
representative groups of persons is substituted. 
Methods of Conducting Worm-Count Survey. The patients 
to be treated are carefully selected from the different localities to be 
included in the survey. Effort is made at all times to secure groups 
whose state of health closely approximates the average for their 
communities. Not less than twenty-five nor more than thirty per- 
sons are usually chosen for each locality, adults comprising two- 
thirds of the group. Different activities and occupations find pro- 
portionate representation, and the number of males and females— 
of boys and girls as well as of men and women—is equalized wherever 
possible. The subjects to be examined are treated with a vermifuge, 
and all stools which they pass for three days are retained, washed, 
and searched for worms. The worms passed by each person are 
then counted and identified as to species. Treatment is usually 
repeated at ten-day intervals until three treatments in all have been 
taken, 
Advantages of New Type of Survey. The principal advantage 
of this method of conducting a survey lies in the fact that it yields 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
152 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
more accurate information as to the severity of the infection than 
does the ordinary microscopic search for eggs in the feces. It is 
especially valuable for determining not only the extent but the sever- 
ity of hookworm infection in different localities, and the effects of 
occupation, age, etc., upon the number of worms harbored. By 
thus indicating more accurately the relative severity of the infection 
in different localities and among different groups, it enables control 
measures to be undertaken with greater assurance that the disease is 
being attacked first in those areas where it assumes its most serious 
aspect.

VI 
HOOKWORM CONTROL OPERATIONS 
Nothing could be simpler in theory than the few measures neces- 
sary for the control of hookworm infection. The cycle of the worm 
from the moment the egg is deposited on the ground until it has 
reached the small intestine of its human host and developed to its 
adult stage, is well understood, as are also the details of its life-story 
and environment; and there are at least two drugs which are most 
potent in freeing the human system of the parasites. It should there- 
fore be relatively simple to locate and to cure those who have the 
disease, to prevent others from contracting it, and thus to bring about, 
within limited areas at least, its complete eradication. 
Complete Control Never Accomplished. Although the prob- 
lem of complete eradication is simple when stated on paper, it is not 
so in practice. The Board has been engaged in work against hook- 
worm disease since 1910, similar work was undertaken in Porto Rico 
in 1904, and the attack on the disease in the mines of Belgium, Hol- 
land, and Germany began as early as 1902, yet it is impossible to 
point to any one mine or area from which the infection has been 
completely eradicated. In the mines of Germany it was reduced 
from 16.8 per cent in 1903 to .18 per cent in 1912; in those of the 
Netherlands, from 25 per cent in 1903 to .32 per cent in 1913; and 
in those of the Liege district of Belgium, from 22.8 per cent in 1902 
to 1.2 per cent in 1913. These are the nearest recorded approaches 
to complete control. 
‘Difficulty of Completely Eradicating the Infection. Many 
obstacles stand in the way of complete eradication, even in isolated 
areas having no immigration and with natural conditions that either 
limit or preclude intercourse with the outside world. It is seldom 
possible to examine every individual in an area or to treat until cured 
all who are found infected; when latrines of a proper type are in- 
stalled in sufficient numbers to prevent soil pollution, it is still neces- 
sary to accustom the people to the use of them—and this is a task 
that usually requires a long period of education and enlightenment; 
and even when both the foregoing conditions are fulfilled, there still 
remains for a time the danger of re-infection from hookworm larvae 
already in the soil. 
RE-INFECTION IN TREATED AREAS 
The failure to achieve complete control of the infection in any area 
is probably due in the main to three reasons: first, that in most of 
the areas of operation effective excrement disposal has not preceded 
153
-P-A-G-E-152
    
154 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
the curative work by more than ten months; secondly, that there 
has been an error of greater or less degree in microscopic diagnosis; 
and, thirdly, that there is at present a lack of data on certain points 
concerning which definite knowledge is essential for control. In six 
countries during the period under review, a large number of persons 
who had previously been treated and presumably cured were re-ex- 
amined in order to ascertain whether infection was recurring in the 
areas in which they lived, and if so to what extent. 
Low Rate of Re-Infection on Costa Rican Plantations. 
The lowest re-infection percentage recorded was in Costa Rica, 
where on Aquiares estate only 4.0 per cent infection was found on 
re-examination of 223 laborers who had been cured eighteen months 
earlier. On another estate in this country—Rodeo—a rate of 14.4 
per cent was found among 191 persons who had been cured from five 
to eighteen months earlier. On neither estate was every home 
provided with a latrine: Aquiares had but half and Rodeo but one 
fourth its homes provided with this convenience at the close of the 
curative campaign. The re-infection rates for these estates are in 
striking contrast to those reported for areas in other countries where 
similar re-examinations were made. 
Re-Infection Rates among Treated Patients in St. Vincent. 
In St. Vincent three dispensers spent their entire time during the 
period from May 13 to June 18, 1918, in collecting specimens from 
persons who had been cured in Calliaqua, Belair, and Sion Hill, 
the three first areas of this colony in which systematic measures for 
the control of hookworm infection were completed. The original 
work in the Calliaqua area ended on September 30, 1915, in Belair 
on December 31, 1915, and in Sion Hill on April 5, 1916; in each 
area, therefore, more than two years elapsed between treatment 
and re-examination. In all, 1,525 of the 2,257 persons treated and 
reported cured in the original campaigns were re-examined and 67.6 
per cent of them were found to be infected. The re-infection rates 
were 46.9 per cent in the Belair district, 64.8 per cent in Calliaqua, 
and 68.2 per cent in Sion Hill, being lowest in Belair, where the 
greatest amount of sanitary work was done. 
Re-Examination of Treated Patients in Seychelles, Nica- 
ragua, and Trinidad. In the Seychelles Islands, among 267 
persons known to have been cured six months or more previous to 
re-examination, an infection rate of approximately 30 per cent is 
reported. Here the homes are now provided with latrines and there 
is but little evidence of soil pollution. , The director for Nicaragua 
states that at the end of a year there was a re-infection rate of 65 
per cent in the town of Nandasmo, where every home had been pro- 
vided with an approved latrine during the progress of the curative 
campaign; and the director for Trinidad reports re-infection rates 
varying from 18 to 84 per cent for certain districts of that colony 
in which the people were treated more than a year ago. The extent 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 155 
of re-infection in Trinidad was found to vary with the sanitary con- 
dition of the districts. Areas with very poor sanitation invariably 
had more than 60 per cent re-infection, and those in good sanitary 
condition had relatively high rates of re-infection if poorly sanitated 
districts surrounded them. (See Fig. 33, page 157.) 
High Re-Infection Rates on Estates in Ceylon. It is from 
Ceylon, however, that the highest rates of re-infection have been 
reported. On the thirty-three estates of the Matale area whose 
laboring force was partially re-examined during 1918, after the lapse 
of at least a year, the average 
percentage of re-infection was 
88 among a total of approxi- 
mately 3,000 persons examined. 
The rate ranged from as low as 
45 on one estate to as high as 
100 on ten. Nineteen of the 
estates had re-infection per- 
centages between 91 and 100; 
six between 81 and 90; three 
between 71 and 80; and only 
five less than 70. (See Fig. 31.)

Re-Examinations on Ceylon Estates Completed during 1918. 
A limited number of re-examinations were made in the estate-areas 
of Ceylon in which operations were terminated during 1918. Three 
months after completing work on the estates in the Upper Maskeliya 
area, specimens were re-examined from 348 laborers who had been 
reported cured, and 13 per cent were found to be infected. On nine 
estates in the Elpitiya area a proportion of the inhabitants were 
re-examined from six to eight months after the close of the campaign. 
Here the infection percentages ranged from 6 to 47, the average being 
* 31. In the Koslanda-Haputale area, among seven estates a number 
of whose residents were re-examined at the end of four months, the 
rates ran from 2 to 13, the average being only 7. It should be
-P-A-G-E-154
  156 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
pointed out, however, that in the case of all three of the estate areas 
last mentioned the re-examinations were made too soon after the 
completion of the original cam- 
paign. Itis to be expected that 
other re-examinations which 
will follow at the end of twelve 
months or more will establish 
re-infection percentages more 
closely approaching those re- 
corded for Matale and Boga- 
wantalawa. (See Fig. 32.)   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Reduction of Mass Infec- 
tion First Essential to Con- 
trol. These high rates of 
re-infection should not be ac- 
cepted as indicating that no 
considerable progress has been 
made toward bringing the 
disease under control. It 
should be remembered that the 
problem of hookworm control 
is primarily one of reducing 
mass infection. The practical

basis the best criterion for 
judging the effectiveness of a curative campaign in any area is not the 
percentage of infected persons who are cured or who remain cured, 
but the proportion, expelled and destroyed, of the total worms har- 
bored by the population.   
    
    
  
  
    
  
        
  
              
  Factors Determining Percentages of Re-Infection. Even 
though in certain of the areas mentioned, from 50 to 100 per cent of 
the persons formerly cured of the disease have since become re-infected, 
there can be little doubt that as a result of treatment the average 
number of worms harbored by each infected person has been very 
materially reduced. Conditions extremely favorable for the preva- 
lence and persistence of the infection exist practically throughout all 
countries in which the work has been conducted; there is at present 
lack of definite knowledge as to how long larvae remain infective in 
the soil; the latrine accommodations provided in many areas have 
been defective or inadequate, the habits of the people grossly insani- 
tary, and in addition war conditions have interfered seriously with 
due and effective sanitary supervision and reasonable regimentation. 
Under these circumstances re-infection was bound to occur in

NEED OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ON FACTS 
ESSENTIAL FOR CONTROL 
The fact that after a series of efforts at control in different parts 
of the globe extending over a period of more than fifteen years it is 
still impossible to point to any single area from which the disease has 
been completely eradicated, suggests that perhaps the work is being 
carried out with a lack of scientific information on certain points con- 
cerning which definite knowledge is indispensable if complete con- 
trol is to be achieved. It is hoped that a series of studies may soon 
be made which will supply definite experimental proof on the phases 
of hookworm control which still require further investigation. 
Viability of Hookworm Larvae in Soil and Feces. One of the 
most important factors in need of further study is that relating to 
the viability of hookworm larvae in soil and feces. In the past it 
has been commonly supposed that after a period of from six to ten 
months the soil would become sterile and the disease would gradually 
die out, but the evidence now at hand seems to indicate that soil 
once heavily infected—particularly in tropical countries where the 
to
-P-A-G-E-156
  158 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
temperature seldom or never drops to the freezing point—must 
remain infected for a considerable time even after sanitary condi- 
tions have been improved. Thus, Kofoid has recently reported that 
in the soil of California the larvae remained alive for twelve months, 
and it is probable that in more tropical climates they persist for 
even longer periods. 
a. Life of larvae in garden soil of China. There was opportunity 
for limited investigation of this question in China during 1918. In 
this country, much of the soil is under cultivation the year round, 
assisted by intensive fertilization with human excreta. In the middle 
of August a plot of land in which no larvae could be demonstrated 
was fenced off. This plot was then divided into three sections. In 
(A) the ground was dug up in the manner that is followed in planting 
a Chinese vegetable garden, and feces that were known to contain 
hookworm eggs and larvae were mixed with the soil. In (B) infected 
feces were merely sprinkled over the top. In (C) the ground was 
left undisturbed and uncontaminated. The plot of ground selected 
for the experiment was 1000 ft. above sea level and during the period 
of five months that had elapsed up to December 31, 1918, had been 
subjected to temperatures, varying from 38° centigrade to 4° 
centigrade. The soil in the meantime had been directly exposed to 
the summer sun and to the winter ice and snow. 
For the entire five months’ period plot (C) gave negative results. 
On the other hand, until the cold weather set in in December, larvae 
could always be found in (A) and (B) on the first slide examined. 
Afterwards it was necessary to pour water on the culture to draw the 
larvae out, and the last time the test was made three slides had to be 
prepared before a larva was found. The larvae were always actively 
motile in (A) and (B) and in December were still present in enormous 
numbers. : 
In other experiments conducted during the month of September 
and again at the end of December, fifteen fields were indiscriminately 
chosen and samples of soil obtained and cultivated. All were posi- 
tive for hookworm larvae. 
b. Investigation of larvae viability in storage pits. Itis customary for 
Chinese farmers to store excreta in storage pits after purchasing it 
for use as fertilizer. An investigation was made during 1918 of the 
probable duration of life of hookworm ova and larvae in these pits. 
For economical reasons none of the farms visited had feces that had 
been in storage for more than two and one-half months, despite the 
fact that the farmers claim that the older the excreta the more valu- 
able it is for fertilizing purposes. On one occasion thirteen pits were 
visited and on another twelve, and samples of feces were obtained 
from all. The age of the feces from which the samples were taken 
ranged from three to seventy-two days. All specimens contained 
both hookworm and ascaris ova, but larvae were not numerous except 
on cultivation.
-P-A-G-E-157
  
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 159 
c. Penetration of larvae through sand. Dr. Dershimer investigated 
this question in connection with his work at the Onderneeming 
Industrial School in British Guiana. In spite of the fact that pail 
latrines had been in use in this institution for some time, an unusually 
high percentage (95.8) of the 142 boys living there were found infected. 
On investigation it was discovered that the contents of the latrines 
were buried around lime trees to fertilize them, and that a large 
proportion of the boys who worked round these trees when the 
ground was wet subsequently developed ground-itch. A pound 
or more of sand taken from the surface near the trees was examined 
microscopically and numerous larvae were discovered. All had 
worked through two feet or more of sand to gain the surface. 
Transmission of Infection by Fliesand Dust. Some data from 
Arkansas and Texas brought together by means of the laboratory 
car Meichnikoff, during the treatment of infected soldiers in the 
Southern States, suggest that there is a possibility of the infection 
being transmitted by dust. This subject is worthy of further study. 
The réle played by insects, particularly flies, in transmitting the 
infection, also remains to be thoroughly investigated. The latter 
problem was studied to a limited extent in China during 1918. On 
two occasions several hundred flies of the “blue-bottle” species 
were taken from several native latrines. Those from each latrine 
were placed in separate bottles and thoroughly washed. The water 
was then centrifuged and microscopic examinations’ made. All 
the specimens gathered from the seven latrines visited on the first 
occasion showed ascaris and one showed hookworm ova, while those 
from all five latrines visited on the second occasion again showed 
ascaris and one showed hookworm ova. The water in which the 
flies were washed was then cultured by the charcoal method, but no 
additional hookworm larvae were demonstrated. No explanation 
can be offered as to why the eggs of one parasite should be found more 
frequently than those of another, as the percentage of the population 
infected with both parasites is about the same. The end of the fly 
season prevented further investigation being made of this interesting 
subject. 
MODIFIED WORKING METHODS TO REDUCE MASS 
INFECTION 
It has long been evident that if treatment is to be extended to the 
hundreds of millions of East Indians, Egyptians, and Chinese, to say 
nothing of the dense masses of humanity inhabiting other tropical 
and subtropical lands, a means must be found of lowering the cost of 
the work without seriously impairing its efficiency. The great bulk 
of the people in these lands are agriculturists, and practically one 
hundred per cent of the adolescents-and adults among them are in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  
160 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
fected. Two means exist of making treatment more readily avail- 
able for them: (1) preliminary microscopic examination may be 
omitted in regions of heavy infection, and the time and personnel 
now engaged in this phase of activity may be utilized for actual 
curative or preventive work; and (2) since it seems neither necessary 
nor feasible to attempt the immediate removal of the very last hook- 
worm which these persons harbor, a quickly efficient and reliable 
method of treatment may be developed which can be adminis- 
tered as a routine, with the expectation that effective sanitation 
and post-campaign treatment will eliminate whatever light infec- 
tion remains. 
Impracticability of Insisting upon Absolute Cure. To 
strive for the cure of each infected person often involves a long series 
of treatments and re-examinations, and besides is in certain other 
respects an impracticable standard. In present practice by this 
plan it is not usual for all the worms to be expelled. Instead, they 
are reduced to a minimum. When microscopic examination aided 
by the centrifuge is the method of diagnosis employed, there is a 
material error in first examinations as well as in re-examinations after 
treatment has been taken,—an error which may be conservatively 
estimated as exceeding 15 per cent. Thus there is considerable 
unreliability in the very standard upon which cure is based. Then, 
too, infected cases not detected by the present method of diagnosis 
not only are given no opportunity to receive treatment for hookworm 
or for other parasites, but these, as well as the cases inaccurately 
pronounced cured after treatment, are given the impression they are 
free and as a result they continue to spread the disease. There are 
also large numbers of persons who cannot be cured because of refusal 
or for medical or other reasons. This group commonly represents 
about 20 per cent of those infected. While striving for cures in four- 
fifths of the infected population, this group escapes and continues to 
seed its environment, 
Mass Treatment Without Preliminary Diagnosis by Micro- 
scope. After all, it is not the few worms left after treatment, but 
the average of 150 or more worms harbored by the great mass of 
infected and untreated humanity in tropical and subtropical lands, 
that is the important factor in hookworm control. Communities in 
which the adults have an average of fifty or less worms obviously 
do not require treatment so urgently as more heavily infected locali- 
ties. Where there is a high rate of infection and the average number 
of worms per person exceeds fifty, it would seem that the people 
might be treated en masse without preliminary microscopic examina- 
tion, every person in the group except the very young and very old 
receiving treatment. Even though in a few instances more than 10 
per cent of the worms remained after routine treatment, this would 
be offset by the error in microscopic diagnosis under the present plan 
of work, Therefore, though the modified plan when considered

theoretically may seem to lack a certain degree of thoroughness, 
in actual operations by this plan it would seem that but little thor- 
oughness should be lost. 
Experimental Plan of Control for Ceylon Estates. Ceylon 
was the first country in which the modified intensive plan of control 
was attempted. More than 99 per cent of the Tamil laboring popu- 
lation of this country is infected with hookworm disease. Prelimi- 
nary fecal examination was therefore omitted for all except ten or 
twenty per cent of the laborers on each estate. If the specimens 
obtained showed over 80 per cent infection, the whole labor force, 
except persons less than a year old, those physically unfit for treat- 
ment, and pregnant women beyond the third month, were given one 
or two medium doses of chenopodium with an interval of one week 
between.! All were examined clinically to see if they were fit to take 
treatment and also to impress them. Ten days after the first or 
second treatment, fecal specimens were obtained from all those who 
had been treated, and as a rule it was found that about 70 per cent of 
those who had had two treatments had been cured. 
Modification of Intensive Plan Tentatively Adopted for 
Brazil. In Brazil, too, the enormous extent, high rate of infection, 
and sparseness of the population in many regions, have led to a 
similar effort to accelerate the rate of treatment by conservative modi- 
fication of the plan originally followed. In certain of the posts in 
this country it is now customary to take a census of every individual 
and to examine all once, and once only, microscopically. Every 
individual found infected with hookworm disease is treated twice 
with oil of chenopodium, with an interval of ten days between 
treatments. Individuals with hemoglobin below 50 per cent are 
treated three times without additional microscopic examination, 
unless malaria is a controlling factor in the anemia. In addition, all 
persons suffering from any form of intestinal helminthiasis whatever 
are treated once, as well as a// the members of any family which con- 
tains even one infected individual. It is believed that this plan of 
work will succeed in reaching all infected individuals and succeed in 
eliminating from them at least 95 per cent of the intestinal parasites 
they harbor. If at the same time the construction of latrines at all 
the homes is secured, the community will be permanently protected 
and the remaining worms will probably disappear. Summed up in 
few words the system means: a latrine at every house, education 
sufficient to assure its proper use, and every infected individual 
treated at least twice. 
Study of Relative Efficiency of Regular and Modified Inten- 
sive Plans. The Board is not yet prepared to commit itself definitely 
to'the new plan of work. Before doing this it will have to test experi-

ence under a wide variety of conditions and in a number of different 
fields. An initial step in this direction is under way in the State of 
Sao Paulo. In one of the two posts which the Board is maintaining 
in this State, the standard has been set of treating every infected 
individual toacure. In the other, every infected individual is being 
given one miscroscopic examination and two treatments of chenopo- 
dium. The conditions of race, infection, and laboratory efficiency 
are practically the same for both posts. All details of the work are 
to be closely observed. Worm counts will be used as a means of 
checking the findings and of verifying the conclusions reached. 
POST-CAMPAIGN MEASURES ON CEYLON ESTATES 
Arrangements by which post-campaign measures will be conducted 
on all estates on which the regular work of treatment has been com- 
pleted, were made with the Government and planters of Ceylon 
during 1917. It is planned to have these measures continue for a 
period of eighteen months following the close of the initial demonstra- 
tion in the different estate areas. , They will be under the supervision 
of Government medical officers, assisted by microscopist-dispensers 
trained in regular campaign work. At the end of the eighteen 
months’ period of organized post-campaign measures, the estate 
dispensers will be expected to handle the situation, which will con- 
sist mainly of the treatment of small groups of new laborers coming 
to the estates from time to time. 
Extent of Post-Campaign Work to End of 1918. In January, 
1918, post-campaign measures were begun on the estates in the 
Matale area, where the original treatment campaign had been 
completed during 1917. More than 3,000 laborers received post- 
campaign treatment up to the end of the year. It was hoped that 
thoroughgoing post-campaign measures might also be carried out in 
the Bogawantalawa and Dickoya areas, as the demonstration cam- 
paigns there had also been concluded during 1917, but in these areas 
the work had scarcely begun when it had to be interrupted and later 
suspended because of the influenza epidemic. 
Methods Followed in Post-Campaign Work During 1918. 
In carrying out the post-campaign work in Ceylon, the plan fol- 
lowed during 1918 was to take a complete census of each estate and 
to distribute tins to at least fifty coolies taken indiscriminately from 
men, women, and children who had been treated in the original 
demonstration campaign. This served to indicate roughly what 
percentage of re-infection had occurred. The medical officer clini- 
cally examined every person and prescribed for those who were to be 
treated. Two treatments, separated by an interval of ten days, 
were administered, and the staff vacated the estate,

Proposed Modification of Post-Campaign Methods for 1919. 
During 1919 it is proposed to modify the plan in the case of those 
estates on which the post-campaign medical officer, after careful 
survey of the latrines and of a zone within a radius of seventy-five 
yards around each of the lines or groups of lines, finds that the 
latrines are in general use and are being properly kept, and that the 
zones around the lines are free, and are being kept free, from visible 
soil pollution. On such estates a third treatment is to be given to all 
found to be still positive on microscopic examination after the second 
treatment. This will complete the work on such estates if arrange- 
ments are made for the treatment of all new coolies immediately 
upon their arrival. On all other estates, additional treatments, 
after the first series, are to be deferred until eighteen months after 
the close of the original demonstration campaign, by which time 
specific soil pollution should be controlled.

  VII 
SOIL SANITATION AS A MEANS OF CONTROL 
The crux of the hookworm problem lies largely in the contamina- 
tion of the hands and feet of the people with fecal matter. This 
occurs mostly under rural conditions. The most important under- 
taking in all efforts to stamp out the disease is therefore to prevent 
the deposit of ova-impregnated feces on the surface of the ground. 
This may be accomplished by securing the provision and use of 
properly built and adequate latrines to serve as receptacles for the 
contaminated matter. To assure the installation, maintenance, and 
use of sufficient and satisfactory latrines is, however, a formidable 
undertaking. It involves the task of inducing hundreds of millions 
of people in the infected regions to abandon habits ingrained by cen- 
turies of usage and often dictated by the religions to which they ad- 
here, and to accustom themselves to new and in some respects diffi- 
cult habits, the necessity for which they must in some manner be 
brought to appreciate. 
Defining the Problem by Sanitary Surveys. The original 
sanitary problem of each area of operations is defined by a house- 
to-house canvass during which the facilities that exist at each house 
for safely disposing of human excrement are carefully noted. This 
initial sanitary inspection is generally carried out in advance of the 
curative work. During the past year, statistics have been gathered 
as to the latrine conditions at 95,706 homes in 236 rural or semi- 
rural areas in various tropical and subtropical lands. Classing as 
satisfactory any type of latrine that effectually prevents soil pollu- 
tion and is fly-proof, only 9,381, or 9.8 per cent, of the homes in 
these areas were reported to have satisfactorye accommodations, 
while 50,749, or 53.0 per cent, had no accommodations whatever 
when the curative work was undertaken. The situation on first 
inspection in a number of widely-separated but typical rural localities 
is instanced below to show the need of thoroughgoing sanitary re- 
form if soil contamination is to be prevented and hookworm disease 
eventually controlled. The conditions in the areas mentioned 
are not unusual, but repeat themselves with greater or less fidel- 
ity in the different countries in which control measures are being 
undertaken. 
a. Lack of latrines on Sao Paulo plantations. The survey of Sao 
Paulo completed during 1918 showed that on the coffee plantations of 
this State the owners’ and managers’ houses are generally the only 
ones provided with latrines. As a result the soil around the coffee 
plants is infected with larvae and the workers constantly re-infect 
themselves. The soil is porous and is kept moist by the shade of the 
166 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 167 
coffee trees, and for the greater part of the year the temperature is 
fairly high. Conditions are therefore ideal for the eggs to hatch and 
for the larvae to develop. 
b. Sanitary situation in selected areas of Southern States. In the 
entire rural area of Hart County, Georgia, not a single sanitary 
latrine was found at the time of first inspection. In South Carolina, 
among 5,703 homes in three counties, 3,334, or 58.5 per cent, were 
found to be provided with insanitary latrines of the open-back, open- 
seat variety. An additional 1,518, or 26.6 per cent, were without 
facilities of any sort for disposing of their excrement. In Texas, 
only 13.7 per cent of 4,758 homes located in eight counties, had satis- 
factory conveniences when the work began. Two hundred eighty- 
five, or 6.0 per cent, had no conveniences at all. 
c. Facilities for fecal disposal in Queensland and Trinidad. In the 
infected regions of Queensland, Australia, the pail system, with 
burial of the contents, was in general use on first inspection, but the 
latrines were mostly of the open-back, open-seat variety, inadequate 
for preventing soil contamination. In the Caroni, Maracas, and 
Laventille areas of Trinidad, the sanitary conditions were reported 
to be very bad. In the Caroni area there were a number of heavily- 
infected villages in which not a single latrine could be found. 
Methods Followed in Securing Sanitary Improvement. 
Practically all the states and countries which are carrying on meas- 
ures against hookworm disease have adopted one or more types of , 
latrines, and have made provision for a more or less complete system 
of inspection to assure the erection and use of these latrines in 
sufficient numbers to guard against soil pollution. The staff en- 
gaged in the curative work endeavors through its educational activi- 
ties to bring all the people to appreciate the necessity of providing 
themselves with some form of latrine that will permit the safe disposal 
of excrement, and in each instance recommends the type or types of 
latrines adopted by the Board of Health of the state or country in 
which the work is being conducted. 
Types of Latrines Recommended. In general, any means of 
disposal is acceptable if it provides against dissemination of infected 
material by flies, against pollution of the ground in places accessible 
to bare feet, and against the contamination of drinking water. 
There are six main methods that do this: (1) the fly-proof pail 
latrine, where the ultimate disposal of the night soil is under care- 
ful supervision and is satisfactory; (2) the pit latrine, when fly-proof 
and so located as not to pollute the drinking-water supply; (3) 
septic tanks properly constructed; (4) sewerage; (5) treatment of the 
feces with an effective chemical; and (6) incineration plants. There 
are practical considerations touching upon the relative merits of 
each of these methods, and in many countries, where the choice lies 
between two or more forms of disposal, it is only the cheapest that  
-P-A-G-E-166
  168 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
the people in large numbers can be induced to use. This goes far 
toward explaining the present popularity of the pit privy, which, 
though not ideal, has come into use on a large scale mainly because 
it is inexpensive and requires but little effort to maintain. 
INVESTIGATION OF SEWAGE DISPOSAL IN SOUTHERN 
STATES 
The diversity of opinion among public health officials as to the 
best method of disposing of human excrement in rural communities 
with limited means, led the National Conference of State and 
Provincial Health Officers, at its meeting in Washington, D. C., on 
June 3 and 4, 1918, to urge the Surgeon General of the United States 
Public Health Service to appoint a special commission to study the 
subject and make recommendations. Prior to this, in January, 
1916, the Board, recognizing that definite information on the subject 
would be of considerable assistance to local health authorities, had 
made provision for carrying out, under the direction of the Rocke- 
feller Institute for Medical Research, a study of the types of latrines 
commonly used for disposing of feces in unsewered localities. It was 
hoped that from the facts brought to light it would be possible to 
evolve a method, or various methods, of disposal that would be safe 
and practicable under prevailing conditions. 
Method of Approaching the Problem. The work was placed 
in charge of Dr. I. J. Kligler, of the Rockefeller Institute, whose 
studies, conducted over a period of two years, have sought to test 
experience under a variety of conditions. The problem was ap- 
proached from both the field and experimental points of view. 
In the laboratory, repeated tests were made to determine the via- 
bility of typhoid and dysentery bacilli in soil and in excrement under 
different conditions, their ability to penetrate columns of soil of 
different degrees of porosity, their viability in septic fluids and 
effluents, and the nature of the antagonistic factors in soil and in 
septic material which influence their viability. In the field work, 
particular attention was paid to the extent of pollution of the soil 
surrounding privies and the relationship that privies bear to the 
pollution of wells. The pit and the septic tank were the types of 
privies mainly studied, though other varieties, including the pail 
privy and the chemical toilet, came in for a limited share of attention. 
Method of Conducting Studies in the Field. The studies of 
the septic tank centered on field investigations of thirty Kentucky 
sanitary privies, which had been in use for periods ranging from four 
months to three years. The L. R. S. type was investigated only in 
the laboratory. Practically all the Kentucky privies examined 
were of the rural type.
-P-A-G-E-167
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 169 
The pit privy was tested in five widely separated communities in 
the State of South Carolina. These communities presented prac- 
tically all soil formations common to that State. The soil in the first 
was hard, red clay; in the second and third, sand-clay; in the fourth, 
sand on a sandstone bed, with a water-table eight to ten feet below 
the surface; in the fifth, sand and sand-clay. The privies, more than 
fifty in number, had been used from one to three years, and were 
studied during both the dry and rainy seasons. 
In investigating the pit privy, specimens of soil were taken at 
different depths and at different distances from the pit, to learn the 
source and direction of any seepage that might be occurring. The 
effluent from septic tanks was also collected and examined, the soil 
samples being taken in the same manner as for pit privies. 
Results of the Investigations. The main findings of the sur- 
vey, subject to confirmation by more extended investigations, are: 
(1) that typhoid and dysentery bacilli succumb rapidly upon being 
exposed to unnatural environment, consisting either of the effluent 
from septic tanks, of solid feces, or of soil; (2) that the spread of 
pollution from a focal point is limited in scope; and (3) that pollution 
of the wells, when it occurs, is usually derived from the surface. 
The experiments indicated that the vertical distance between the 
source of pollution and the ground water level, as well as the char- 
acter of the soil, are the important factors for consideration in choos- 
ing the method to be employed in disposing of sewage. The hori- 
zontal distance between the polluted area and the well was found to 
be of relatively slight importance except where there are underground 
channels or cracks in the soil. 
In moderately compact clay, sand clay, or sandy soil, free from 
cracks, the possibility of subsoil pollution of the ground water from 
pits and septic tanks seems to be negligible if a vertical distance of at 
least ten feet is allowed between the fecal deposits and the ground 
water level. The pit privy is not considered safe in limestone regions 
or in soil where the ground water level is near the surface. For such 
localities the Kentucky sanitary privy or a privy of similar design, 
with sufficient storage capacity to allow time for the destruction of 
pathogenic bacilli, and with the drain placed from three to five feet 
above the ground water level, is thought to be best. 
Need of Additional Inquiry to Establish Preliminary Deduc- 
tions. It is recognized that thesé experiments and tests are only 
preliminary in character and that they have not yet been carried 
far enough for definite conclusions to be drawn from them. Condi- 
tions growing out of the war made it necessary to await favorable 
opportunity for a more extended study of the problem. The further 
study to be undertaken should include, among other subjects, a 
thorough investigation of the viability of the eggs of intestinal 
parasites. 3

SOIL SANITATION IN ADVANCE OF TREATMENT 
There is a growing tendency for governments to arrange for the 
proper disposal of excrement in advance of the examination and 
treatment of the people. Ceylon led the way in this movement. 
Government regulations enacted in that colony during 1916 required 
all estates to erect adequate latrines for their laborers before the 
expiration of one year. As a result, the new estate areas undertaken 
during 1917 and 1918 were provided with latrine accommodations 
before the curative work was inaugurated. This situation will hold 
true with respect to all other estate areas that are selected for work 
in this colony. A similar movement is reported from Brazil, Queens- 
land, the Seychelles Islands, China, Siam, Nicaragua, Salvador, 
and British Guiana, and the agreements entered into with Jamaica 
and Barbados, where measures against hookworm disease are shortly 
to be inaugurated, specify that effective sanitation shall precede 
examination and treatment by at least six months. The Australian 
authorities also are reported to be favorably disposed toward making 
the installation and use of latrines a prerequisite to the opening of 
work for hookworm control on the estates of Papua. 
Advance Sanitation in Brazil and Seychelles Islands. In 
Brazil, the State of Parana has already undertaken active sanitary 
operations in anticipation of the opening of curative work, and 
reports a beginning through the installation of latrines in the town of 
Jaguariahyva. Other states of that country are expected to adopt a 
similar program. Similarly, in China, no new miners have been 
examined at the Pinghsiang Colliery since August, 1918, unless the 
areas they worked in were provided with adequate latrines. In the 
Seychelles Islands, careful sanitary inspection of about half the 
area in which curative work remains to be carried out was made 
during 1918. This revealed that an excellent start toward eradi- 
cating the disease had been made through the installation of latrine 
accommodations for all the residents. Though soil pollution has not 
been entirely stopped, it has been greatly reduced, and there is every 
indication that in this area a situation has been brought about that 
will permit the fullest realization being made of the ee of the 
curative work. 
LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN LATRINE PROVISION 
During 1918 the States of Sao Paulo, Minas Geraes, Parana, and 
Bahia, in Brazil, adopted and put into execution rural sanitary codes 
which make obligatory the provision of latrine accommodations at 
every home within their jurisdictions. The State of Rio de Janeiro, 
of the same country, had already adopted such a law in 1917.

INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 173 
Shortly after the close of 1918, the General Assembly of North 
Carolina adopted a similar state-wide law, and numerous towns 
and counties in other Southern States have adopted ordinances re- 
quiring latrines at all homes within their incorporated limits. 
Latrine Ordinances Enacted in Queensland. The health 
act of Queensland, Australia, clothes the local authorities of each 
shire or township with full authority for securing effective excrement 
disposal. During 1918 an ordinance for enforcing the improvement 
of all latrines was adopted by Cooktown, Port-Douglass-Mossman, 
Cairns, and Cairns Shire,—all embraced within the territory in 
which measures against hookworm disease were being carried 
out. These ordinances gave the owners a limited time for mak- 
ing repairs, and provided that after the expiration of that period 
the alterations would be made by the local authorities at the expense 
of the owners. 
ESTATE SANITATION IN CEYLON 
Before the opening of work against hookworm disease in Ceylon, 
few estates had latrine accommodations for their labor, and the 
houses in the villages were seldom equipped with sanitary conven- 
iences. Now practically all estates have adequate latrines. This 
means that since the work was undertaken in January, 1916, ap- 
proximately 50,000 latrine compartments, sufficient to provide 
accommodations to 700,000 persons, have been installed. Now 
the great problem is to bring about the use of the latrines that have 
been built. 
Difficulty of Enforcing Use of Latrines on Estates. On all 
the estates the latrines are used to greater or less extent, but there is 
still considerable evidence that the soil is being polluted. This com- 
monly occurs about laborers’ quarters and along bridle paths. The 
efforts to improve sanitary conditions being made by the estate , 
superintendents will require time to yield results, as the laborers 
are indifferent about using latrines. Nevertheless it is encouraging 
to report that the number who do use them is steadily increasing. 
Adequate System of Latrine Inspection Needed for Estate 
Areas. The definitive recognition of soil pollution as an offense pun- 
ishable by law, and the establishment of a regular system of inspec- 
tion, may be required to guarantee that the estate latrines are prop- 
erly used. The Senior Sanitary Officer now has a competent body of 
trained sanitary inspectors, but their activities are confined in the 
main to sanitary board areas and to special districts where conditions 
are very unsatisfactory. The extension of this work to reach all of 
Ceylon is to be the next step.
-P-A-G-E-172
  174 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
VILLAGE SANITATION IN CEYLON 
Much of the infection and re-infection on estate areas is probably 
acquired in the villages and bazaars included within the boundaries 
of these areas or situated closely adjacent to them. Until recently 
no latrines had been erected in these localities, but the Government, 
recognizing the futility of treating and curing the estate laborers only 
to have them re-acquire the infection on their visits to the villages or 
to the largely-patronized bazaars, has lately issued orders to the vil- 
lage headmen and other authorities to have latrines constructed for 
village and bazaar communities. In the Matale area the sanitary 
department has had from two to four qualified inspectors at work for 
more than two years, extending the latrine and privy system through- 
out the villages. Nearly 2,500 village latrines were erected in this 
area during 1917, and, although no figures for final results are yet 
available, the work went steadily forward during 1918. In the vil- 
lage communities in or near other estate areas in which treatment 
campaigns were conducted up to December 31, 1918, many additional 
latrines have been installed, but the absence of an adequate system of 
inspection has sometimes resulted in these latrines being of an in- 
ferior type. 
Installation of Latrines in Southern and Western Provinces. 
It is estimated that in villages located in other parts of the colony, 
between 40,000 and 50,000 latrines have been built since the beginning 
of 1916, nearly all of them by the villagers themselves. Of these, 
480 were installed in 1916 and 25,215 in 1917. Exact figures for 
1918 are not yet available. In the rural parts of Weligama-Korale, 
in the Southern province, with a population of about 200,000, privies 
to the number of 21,419 have been erected during the past eighteen 
months or two years, more than 19,000 of them during the past 
seven months. These are sufficient to provide accommodations to 
at least 100,000 persons.! The villagers built all of these latrines 
without prosecution and are using them without reluctance. By 
special tax and with a Government grant and loan, 40,000 rupees 
will be available for the erection of latrines in two towns of this 
province—Matara and Weligama—during the coming year. Exten- 
sive sanitary improvements have also been made at Minuwagonda and 
surrounding villages in Western Province. Here the whole town- 
ship, with a population of about 9,000, and the villages within a two- 
-mile radius, having a combined population of 3,000 or 4,000, have 
been provided with sufficient latrines. Sanitary surveillance is to be 
maintained by qualified inspectors, who will also carry on educa- 
tional work, including lantern talks, on health subjects. 
Latrine Building as Means of Interesting Villagers in Hook- 
worm Relief Measures. Paradoxically, the installation and use 
1 These figures take no account of local board or sanitary board activities.
-P-A-G-E-173
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD I75 
of latrines affords the best entering wedge for work among the Sing- 
halese villagers who form the permanent population of Ceylon. Lan- 
tern talks by native dispensers gain the sympathy and interest of the 
villagers, lead to extensive privy building, and later to a request for 
the establishment of dispensaries to extend to the villagers the 
opportunity of being treated. If treatment is held out to them as a 
preliminary first step, they refuse; but after they have been brought 
to install latrines in large numbers and to realize the benefits attend- 
ing their use, effective curative work may readily be conducted 
among them. 
SANITATION IN THE MINES OF CHINA 
In December, 1917, a demonstration in the control of hookworm 
disease was undertaken in a large mine in China. An infection sur- 
vey of the Pinghsiang colliery and the immediate mining community, 
in Kiangsi Province, was the first step in carrying out this demon- 
stration. As a result of conditions revealed by the survey, the min- 
ing corporation set aside $20,000 (Mexican) to be expended in 
sanitating its mines, and on April 6, 1918, the systematic exam- 
ination and treatment of the employes was begun. 
Organization of Permanent Sanitary Department. Part of 
the $20,000 appropriated by the mining corporation will be used 
to establish a permanent sanitary department. This department 
will take over the work against hookworm disease as soon as 
the initial demonstration has been completed. A well-trained 
Chinese sanitary engineer is to be appointed to direct the new depart- 
ment. The company has three assistants also attending the office 
regularly to learn all details of the campaign, and has employed a 
special attendant to look after latrines. 
Provision of Sanitary Conveniences. Before the demonstra- 
tion measures are completed, there will be sufficient sanitary toilets, 
both above and below ground, to provide accommodations for all 
surface and underground workers. In the mines the pail system 
of latrine, with careful inspection and frequent emptying of the 
contents of the pails, is being employed. On the surface the open 
latrines previously used at the four boarding-houses where the 
company’s employes live, have been filled in and replaced by new 
latrines of the pit type, each costing between $800 and $1,000 
(Mexican), and other smaller latrines are under construction where 
needed. The large latrines at the boarding-houses will provide 
accommodations for approximately 2,000 persons. 
Installation of Pits for Storage of Feces. Eleven pits have 
been erected in the company’s vegetable gardens, where it is pro- 
posed to store feces for such time as may be required to render them 
innocuous. In China the commercial value and wide-spread use of
-P-A-G-E-174
176 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
feces for fertilizing purposes complicates the problem of hookworm 
control and makes it especially difficult to prevent soil contamina- 
tion. The eleven pits in the vegetable gardens will provide oppor- 
tunity for studying the viability of hookworm ova and larvae in 
feces and for determining whether storage for a sufficient length of 
time to kill the eggs and embryos will lower or destroy the commer- 
cial value of the feces. The Chinese farmers have a maxim that the 
older the feces the greater its potential fertilizing value, and it may 
be that this precept, coupled with facilities for storage, will provide 
the solution of the problem. 
Control Regulations as Part of Future Mining Concessions. 
The sanitation of working conditions and the examination and 
treatment of applicants before employment, are fundamental factors 
in permanently ridding the mines of China of their hookworm infec- 
tion. Ifthe Government should decide to insert in all future mining 
concessions granted by its central and provincial mining bureaus, a 
clause requiring proper sanitation and provision for the treatment and 
cure of infected employes before the mines are opened, such provision 
would go a long way toward the eventual control of the disease. 
One of the objects of the work at Pinghsiang is to demonstrate the 
need for such action. 
SOIL SANITATION IN BRAZIL 
The campaign on Governor’s Island, in Brazil, resulted in pro- 
viding latrine accommodations for more than 7,000 people. The 
co-operation of the Federal Health Service was all that could be 
desired. Of 1,140 homes, 911, or 80 per cent, were without any kind 
of latrines on first inspection, and only 206, or 18 per cent, had ac- 
ceptable latrines. On last inspection 99.4 per cent of the houses had 
latrines either already erected or in course of construction. This 
means that every house in the area except seven belonging to public 
departments—on which notices to install latrines could not legally 
be served—were either provided with latrines or had them under 
construction. Steps are already under way to secure the erection of 
latrines at the seven public buildings. A sanitary inspector appointed 
and paid by Government will remain permanently in this area to 
superintend completion of the work, and to see that the provisions 
of the sanitary code for the Federal District are properly observed 
_ in future. 
Erection and Use of Latrines in Rio Bonito. There was also 
considerable sanitary improvement during the year in the typical 
rural community of Rio Bonito, located in the State of Rio de 
Janeiro. In the town proper there are 2,500 inhabitants. Here, 
at the close of the year, two-chamber septic tanks with subsoil 
effluents had either been installed or were under construction at 
   
-P-A-G-E-175
  
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 177 
practically all the homes. On the larger farms the proprietors had 
built pit latrines, and similar latrines had also been installed at a 
large number of private homes throughout the remainder of the 
tural area. All this was accomplished without recourse to legal 
process and entirely at the expense of the proprietors. In this area, 
however, there are many temporary habitations which will make it 
impossible to report the erection of latrines at 100 per cent of the 
homes. 
PROVISION OF CARPENTERS TO BUILD LATRINES 
Initial inspection in the North Queensland district of Australia 
showed that 96 per cent of thé 3,023 homes were provided with unsafe 
latrines, or with no latrines at all. Corps of carpenters were em- 
ployed to undertake the task of systematically remodeling all the 
latrines in the area. For this purpose an initial expenditure of 
approximately $7,500 has been made by the householders. A 
second inspection of the same premises several months later showed 
1,310, or 45.0 per cent, of the latrines to be safe. Alterations were in 
progress on all the others. In addition, several towns have let. 
contracts for incinerators for night soil disposal, to cost approxi- 
mately $5,000 each. 
INSTALLATION OF LATRINES IN THE SEYCHELLES 
A recent survey of Mahe, Praslin, and LaDigue, the three largest 
islands of the Seychelles group, indicated that excellent progress 
was being made toward the provision of latrine accommodations 
for all the homes. Of 513 homes located on the island of Praslin, 
481, or 93.8 per cent, had unusually well-constructed latrines, and 
all thirty-two of the houses recorded as not having latrines really 
had latrine accommodation. Many of the houses are so close to- 
gether that it is unnecessary for each to have a separate latrine. 
Sanitation of the Soil in Advance of Treatment. On Praslin 
and LaDigue, where curative work had not been attempted up to 
the close of the year, 98 per cent of the homes had good pit latrines. 
The majority of these were built as a result of Government regula- 
tions enacted in 1917, requiring latrine accommodations at all the 
homes. Thus, practically complete sanitation has been provided on 
these Islands in advance of the treatment campaign. Furthermore, the 
Government of Mauritius has recently given $32,400 to the Sey- 
chelles Government, and the Governor has sanctioned the use of 
as much of this as may be necessary for the installation of public 
latrines at the most convenient locations throughout the Seychelles.

LATRINE BUILDING IN SIAMESE VILLAGES 
In Siam, up to December 31, 1918, three liquefaction tanks and 
224 protected pit latrines had been installed in the city of Chiengmai, 
and 977 pit latrines in neighboring villages. These figures include 
only the latrines that were inspected and found satisfactory; they 
take no account of large numbers of additional latrines erected in 
localities so remote from the regular headquarters of the work that it 
was not possible to arrange for their inspection. 
Outlook for Advance Sanitation in Siam. The rivalry 
between the Siamese villages to secure the benefits of examination 
and treatment for hookworm disease sometimes makes it possible to 
insist, as a prerequisite, that adequate latrine accommodation shall 
be provided before curative measures are undertaken. The Viceroy 
and the Commissioner of Chiengmai called in July a conference of 
mayors of the entire province to discuss the question of sanitation. 
This led the mayor of Muang Prao to order latrines installed at 
every home within this village, and the mayor of Payang to issue a 
similar order to the householders of an entire township. Much 
progress has been made in preparing the way for these sanitary laws 
by the work of education.

SANITARY ADVANCE IN WEST INDIAN COLONIES 
In the West Indies the Government of Dutch Guiana has enacted 
a code of sanitary laws, is organizing a sanitary force with clearly 
defined authority to control soil pollution, and has proceeded with its 
sanitary program during the period that the curative work has been 
in suspension. ‘The Government of Grenada is making satisfactory 
progress in having a uniform type of latrine installed in rural areas. 
Jamaica is organizing a sanitary department and arranging to carry 
out advance sanitation in the areas where the people are to be 
examined and treated. The Governor of Trinidad has appointed 
the Board’s director an honorary member of the Central Board of 
Health of the Island, and has also assigned to the Department of 
Ancylostomiasis an unusually competent inspector who will carry out 
advance sanitation in the areas where work is to be undertaken. 
A committee of the Central Board of Health is making a study of the 
most satisfactory types of latrines for use in rural and semi-urban 
districts, and this committee will make a special report on the sub- 
ject to the Island government. In the Santa Cruz area of this 
Island practically all the homes have been provided with latrines, 
and the majority of the people have formed the habit of using them. 
The sanitary campaign started before the curative work was under 
way, and continued actively and efficiently as long as the area was 
under treatment,

LATRINE BUILDING IN CENTRAL AMERICA 
In Central America, exceptional difficulties stand in the way of all 
privy work undertaken. Most of the people are so poor that they 
find it difficult to sustain existence, and the construction of latrines, 
when required by Government ordinance, imposes upon them a 
financial hardship that in many cases cannot be borne. Of the 
five Central American republics in which work has been conducted, 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and to a lesser extent Guatemala, are the only 
ones that have been able to report substantial accomplishments in 
sanitary improvement. In. Costa Rica, latrines were erected or im- 
proved at 5,134 homes during 1918. In the same country the 
number of public schools provided with sanitary latrines was increased 
from ninety-five in 1915 to 132 in 1917. In a few instances in 
Nicaragua, too, thoroughgoing sanitary reform has accompanied the 
curative work. On the coffee plantations of Guatemala, latrines 
sufficient to provide accommodations for moré than 80 per cent of the 
laboring population were installed, but it is doubtful if all these are 
regularly used. The Indian laborers are not accustomed to the 
sitting posture and are inclined to revert to their primitive habit of 
fouling the ground. The plantation owners, too, after going to the 
expense of erecting latrines, frequently do not bring about their use. 
Sanitary Progress Through Educational Efforts. In Sal- 
vador a few latrines have been installed as a result of urging by staff 
members and decrees issued by mayors, and the Government has 
recently provided a corps of mounted sanitary police to assist in the 
campaign for improved sanitation. In general, however, the situa- 
tion with respect to sanitation has been unsatisfactory. In Panama 
there are no laws requiring latrines, the officials sometimes appear 
to be indifferent, and the people are prejudiced against latrines. 
Effort here has centered on the construction of at least two concrete 
latrines of the pit type at each school in the Republic, and of similar 
public latrines in localities where they will serve the largest number of 
persons. For this purpose the Panamanian Government has set 
aside the sum of $4,000 and has promised to supply an additional 
appropriation of like amount during 1919. There can be little 
doubt that the installation of these public and school latrines, taken 
with the educational efforts of staff members and the benefits result- 
ing from the curative work, are sowing seed that will bear fruit in the 
future, though it may be necessary to await the rising generations 
before the full harvest can be reaped. 
SANITATION OF THE SOIL IN SOUTHERN STATES 
The outstanding features of the rural health work conducted in the 
Southern States during 1918 were (1) the demonstration that the
-P-A-G-E-180
    182 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
special plan of work being followed in North Carolina yields gratify- 
ing results in different fields of county health activity and at the 
same time makes definite progress toward the prevention of soil 
contamination throughout whole counties; and (2) the installation in 
Stone and Harrison counties, Mississippi, of an improved privy at 
every one of their 2,344 rural homes. Harrison was the first county 
in the South to achieve this enviable distinction: here the work 
afforded practical illustration of what can be accomplished in health 
protection and stood out as one of the prominent movements of the 
year in both the county and the State.

Development of Community Sentiment for Adequate 
Latrines. In ten Southern States, a total of 4,586 new privies 
were erected and 15,568 old privies improved during the year. In 
one-fifth of the areas in which work was conducted, a complete 
record of 100 per cent sanitary installation was obtained. In addi- 
tion, there was a gratifying development of privy pride in many rural 
regions of the South, which found expression in the construction not 
of the cheapest type of privy that would serve the purpose, but of a 
well-housed, durable structure to form a permanent adjunct of the 
home. In one community of Tarrant county, Texas, the residents of 
180 of the 200 homes voluntarily erected concrete privies which cost 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 183 
$35 apiece; not less than 15 per cent of the 441 improved privies 
constructed in McLennan county, Texas, were of this type; and in 
Greenwood and Orangeburg counties, South Carolina, there was a 
distinct leaning toward the septic tank and other more costly, 
but also more permanent, forms of construction. The development 
of this individual and community pride was largely fostered by pub- 
lishing lists of names in local papers or by marking homes on maps 
posted in public places to indicate that their occupants or owners had 
made the necessary sanitary improvements. This served as an 
honor roll and soon brought recalcitrants into line.

Results of County Health Work in North Carolina. In 
North Carolina the work of the past fourteen months resulted in the 
installation of 7,364 sanitary closets in the rural areas of ten counties, 
to say nothing of extensive sanitary reform in towns and other urban 
localities. The people were brought to appreciate the value of 
public health measures in general, and a sustaining public sentiment 
toward these measures was developed. One result was the enact- 
ment at the recent session of the General Assembly of a state-wide 
sanitary-privy law which -requires all privies located within 300 
yards of a neighboring home to be constructed and maintained in a
-P-A-G-E-182
    
184 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
manner satisfactory to the State Board of Health. The law applies 
to approximately 85,000 privies in the State, and places an annual 
inspection tax of forty cents on each privy. The funds thus collected 
will be used to defray the salaries and expenses of from ten to twelve 
State sanitary inspectors, whose duty it will be to inspect each privy 
in the State from two to five times a year, to see that the provisions 
of the law are enforced. 
HEALTH IMPROVEMENT FOLLOWING SOIL 
SANITATION 
Data dealing with field conditions can seldom have the scientific 
accuracy of the laboratory. Nevertheless, results following soil 
sanitation in widely separated areas are significant. 
In Georgia, an intensive campaign against soil pollution was begun 
in Troup county on January 1, 1918. Prior to this date, there had 
never been a sanitary pit privy in the entire rural area of the county. 
In the course of the year, 1,341 of these were installed, and 62 per 
cent of the people were thus protected from the dangers of soil 
* pollution. A house-to-house survey of the entire county revealed 
the fact that before the work of sanitation had been undertaken, an 
average of 496 cases of dysentery and 177 cases of typhoid fever 
occurred annually. During the year 1918, there were only fifty- 
eight cases of dysentery, or 12 per cent of the previous average annual 
incidence, and thirty-two cases of typhoid fever, or 18 per cent of the 
former yearly average of cases. 
In Wicomico county, Maryland, from January 1 to October 1, 
1916, the typhoid fever incidence totaled seventy-eight cases; for 
the same period in 1917, there is a record of seventy-six cases. In- 
vestigation indicated that the infection was fly-borne and that its 
source was the prevalent open privy. In January, 1918, a sanitary 
and educational campaign, in which special emphasis was laid upon 
the necessity for the erection of fly-proof latrines, was begun. As a 
result, one hundred homes a month, on an average, were supplied 
with sanitary privies during the course of the year. There were but 
twenty-six typhoid fever cases reported in the county for the period 
from January 1 to October 1, 1918,—a reduction of 66.2 per cent 
from the average rate for the two previous years. ‘ 
In nine counties of North Carolina, during the four-year period 
from 1914 to 1917, the total number of deaths from typhoid fever 
was 478. This was a yearly average of 119.5 deaths, or 35.3 deaths 
per hundred thousand. During 1918, as a result of a crusade against 
soil pollution in these nine counties, a total of 6,480 fly-proof privies 
were erected. Typhoid fever statistics for the year 1918 show that 
out of an aggregate population of 305,016 in these counties, there 
were only twenty-four deaths from this disease, a rate of 7.8 per 
hundred thousand.
-P-A-G-E-183
  
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 185 
Reports from these same counties indicate that the reduction in 
the number of cases of diarrheal diseases among children and in 
fatalities from these diseases, has been even greater than in the case of 
typhoid fever. In the town of Lexington, which has a population of 
about 5,000, the average number of cases of diarrhea among children 
for the years 1914 to 1917 was approximately 115 yearly. During 
1918 the health officer reported only five cases. 
A study of the birth and death rates of recent years in Costa 
Rica furnishes interesting data. During the year 1910, before the 
work of hookworm eradication and soil sanitation had been begun 
in that country, the death rate was 26.36 per thousand. Since then, 
the rate has gradually dropped to 22.52 per thousand for the year 
1917. On this basis it may be estimated that the lives saved during 
the period from 1911 to 1917 number 10,169, or two and one-half 
per cent of the existing population. In 1910, an average of 201.7 
deaths out of 1,000 births occurred among children under the age of 
one year, while the rate for 1917 was 175.9 deaths per thousand 
births. The death rate of children under five years was reduced 
from 328.6 for every thousand births in 1910 to 275 per thousand in 
1917.

MALARIA CONTROL 
Demonstrations which have been carried out in a number of dif- 
ferent localities within the last three years tend to show that in the 
average community in the heavily infected regions of the Southern 
States, malaria can be controlled for less money than it is costing the 
‘communities to have it. Thus far, the field experiments undertaken 
have been of four types, consisting of efforts at malaria control by anti- 
mosquito measures, by the screening of houses, by the administra- 
tion of immunizing quinine, and by direct attack upon the parasite in 
the blood of the human carrier. In conducting these first experi- 
ments, no attempt has been made to put into operation a full program 
of malaria control, but rather to try out the possibilities of some of 
the more important elements which would enter into such a program. 
CONTROL BY ANTI-MOSQUITO MEASURES 
The work in malaria control by anti-mosquito measures has been 
guided by two main purposes: (1) to ascertain to what degree the 
infection may be reduced in the average small town of the Southern 
States by applying the simpler measures of malaria control; and (2) 
to ascertain whether a satisfactory result may be achieved within 
limits of expenditure which these towns may well afford. In the 
experimental demonstrations the habits of the three mosquitoes—A. 
quadrimaculatus Say, A. punctipennis Say, and A. cruzians Wieder- 
mann—which are responsible for the infection, have been made the 
subject of constant study with a view to eliminating all unnecessary 
effort and thereby reducing cost. 
Experiment at Crossett, Arkansas, 1916. The first of the 
tests was undertaken at Crossett, a lumber town of 2,129 inhabitants, 
situated in Ashley County in southeastern Arkansas, about twelve 
miles north of the Louisiana line. It lies at the edge of the so-called 
“uplands,’”’ in a level, low-lying region (elevation 165 feet) with 
sufficient undulation to provide reasonably good natural drainage. 
Climatic conditions and abundant breeding places favor the propaga- 
tion of anopheles. Malaria in its severe form is widely prevalent 
as an endemic infection, and according to the estimate of local 
physicians is the cause of about 60 per cent of all illness throughout 
the region. Within the town itself the malaria rate was high and 
was recognized by the lumber corporation and the people as a serious 
menace to health and working efficiency. 
The initial step in the experiment was a survey of the community 
to determine the malaria incidence, to ascertain the species of mos- 
186
-P-A-G-E-185
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 187 
quitoes responsible for the spread of the infection, and to locate the 
breeding places of these mosquitoes. Breeding places were exhibited 
on a community map, and organized effort was centered on their 
destruction or control. The program of simple measures excluded 
all major drainage. Borrow pits and shallow ponds were filled or 
drained; streams were cleared of undergrowth where necessary to let 
the sunlight in; their margins and beds were cleared of vegetation and 
obstructions; and they were trained to a narrow channel providing 
an unobstructed off-flow. Artificial containers were removed from 
premises; water barrels on bridges were treated with nitre cake. 
All remaining breeding places were regularly treated by removing 
vegetation, opening up shallow margins to give free access to small 
fish, and spraying once a week with road oil by means of automatic 
drips or a knapsack ‘sprayer. All operations were under the super- 
vision of a trained lay inspector. Care was exercised to avoid all 
unnecessary effort, and to secure, not the elimination of the last 
mosquito, but a reasonably high degree of control at a minimum cost, 
The first conspicuous result apparent to every person living in the 
community was the practical elimination of the mosquito as a pest. 
The reduction in malaria as shown by a parasite index taken in May, 
1916, and again in December of the same year, was 72.33 per cent. 
The reduction in physicians’ calls for malaria in 1916 as compared 
with the number of calls for the previous year (company’s records) 
was 70.36 per cent. The per capita cost of the work—omitting over- 
head—was $1.24. During the year the Crossett Lumber Company 
had repeated these measures at two of its large logging camps with 
results which were convincing as to the soundness of the investment. 
At the end of 1916 the community took over the work and for two 
years has maintained it at its own expense and under its own direc- 
tion. The measures have been continued under the supervision of a 
trained native lay inspector. Figure 42, page 188, exhibits in graphic 
form the results for the three years.

Results Confirmed at Hamburg—1917. After the work at 
Crossett had been turned over to the community, operations were 
transferred to the neighboring town of Hamburg, with a view to 
putting the practicability of anti-mosquito measures to test under    
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  188 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
somewhat more difficult conditions. Hamburg was not governed 
and financed by a wealthy corporation; it had no hospital; it depended 
for medical service upon private practitioners who were deriving 
about 60 per cent of their income from malaria; the town was less 
compact, and with only 1,285 inhabitants had a higher malaria 
rate and more abundant breeding places for mosquitoes than had 
Crossett.

The measures which had stood the test of the previous year at 
Crossett, with the introduction of certain economies which experi- 
ence had suggested, were repeated here. Physicians’ calls were 
reduced from 2,312 in 1916 to 259 in 1917—a reduction of 88.8 per 
cent. For the latter half of the year—July to December inclusive— 
there were only forty-three calls for malaria in 1917 as compared 
with 1,995 calls for the same period the previous year—a reduction 
of zee per cent. The per capita cost—omitting overhead—was 
$1.45. 
1 The overhead omitted comprises, in addition to general supervision, expendi- tures for outside surveys, for blood examinations, etc., which are desirable as 
affording useful information but are not properly a part of the cost of control opera- 
tions in the given community, The costs as given include all capital expenditures 
and the complete local organization necessary to the conduct of the work.

At the end of the year again the community took over the work, 
assuming entire responsibility for its continued maintenance and 
direction. Figure 42, page 188, exhibits graphically the results for 
the two years. As a result of community effort during 1918, the 
total calls for malaria fell to fifty-nine, and the work was main-

  Demonstration in Four Communities—1918. Taking as a 
basis the plan of operation which had been tried at Crossett and 
further developed and confirmed at Hamburg, effort was made dur- 
ing 1918 to carry out a demonstration on a somewhat larger scale 
and under a variety of conditions. For this purpose four small 
Arkansas towns were selected. They are rural towns ranging in 
population from 975 to 3,023. Lake Village, county seat of Chicot

County, presented the problem of a le v el, low-lying area of buckshot 
soil with two miles of lake frontage and an extensive area of shallow 
swamp in the rear. Dermott, about twenty miles away, also in the 
flat lands of the Mississippi, presented the peculiarity of having 
abundant anopheles breeding places throughout the municipal area, 
due chiefly to the utter neglect of the most elementary principles of 
drainage in the grading of two railroads and the streets of the town. 
Monticello, county seat of Drew County, is a typical hill-town for 
which a number of clear streams, with adequate fall over a stiff 
clay soil, furnished an abundant supply of anopheles. Bauxite, a 
rambling mining community of about 2,500 inhabitants, presented 
the difficulties of a large area to be treated, a heavy sand-flow in the 
beds of its numerous small streams, and extensive hillside seepage 
areas offering ideal breeding conditions. 
A preliminary survey of each community at different seasons dur- 
ing the previous year made it possible to omit from the working plans 
much that otherwise would have been waste effort. Each com- 
munity was presented in advance with an estimate of its malaria 
* prevalence, a chart exhibiting its breeding places, a working plan 
with budget, and an estimate of what might be expected as a result 
in degree of malaria control. The community in each case provided 
the funds required save for general supervision, and agreed to assume 
entire responsibility for the work after the first year. 
The plan of operation followed at Crossett and Hamburg, with 
improvements suggested by experience and adaptations to local 
conditions, was repeated in each of these towns. For the four com- 
munities combined, physicians’ calls for malaria were reduced from 
5,065—the average for the two previous years—to 554, a reduction 
of 89.1 per cent. The per capita cost of the entire work—omitting 
general overhead—was 74¢. Results and costs by communities 
(except Bauxite) are graphically exhibited in Fig. 42, page 188.

Comparison of cost of operations with results accomplished in 
these six towns tends to show that malaria control in such com- 
munities, considered merely as a business proposition, pays. At two 
dollars per physician’s call, Crossett has been paying annually more
-P-A-G-E-191
  INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 193 
than four and one-half times as much in doctors’ bills alone, for the 
privilege of having malaria, as it expended in 1918 for the upkeep 
of the work which kept it practically free from malaria and from the 
mosquito as a pest. Hamburg’s annual doctors’ bill for malaria 
had been eight times the cost of protection in 1918. In the four new 
communities the annual payment for physicians’ calls would cover 
even the relatively heavy cost of first year operations almost one- 
and-a-half times over. And the doctors’ bill is but an insignificant 
fraction of malaria’s total cost to the community. 
CONTROL BY SCREENING 
For communities situated as those described above, there seems to 
be little need of resort to other procedures than those directed against 
mosquitoes.’ The control of malaria in towns, however,—even in 
small towns—does not reach the heart of the matter. Malaria is 
essentially a rural disease, bearing most heavily on the people and the 
industries of the farm. There are large rural areas, moreover, where 
in the light of our present knowledge the control of mosquito breed- 
ing is not practicable. Malaria in these localities, if it is to be con- 
trolled at all during the pioneer period of settlement, must be attacked 
from another angle. It has been shown by demonstration that under 
conditions which make the cost of mosquito control prohibitive, it is 
still possible to reduce the malaria rate by the screening of houses, 
by the systematic administration of immunizing quinine, and by 
detecting the human carriers and destroying the parasites in their 
blood, 
Experiment on Plantations Near Lake Village, Ark. In 
order to test the efficiency and the cost of screening as a control 
measure, a field experiment was conducted in 1916 on a group of 
cotton plantations near Lake Village, Arkansas. The community, 
which lay along the shore of Chicot Lake, had an abundant supply of 
anopheles and a high malariaincidence. The houses on these planta- 
tions were typical negro cabins, many of them loosely constructed 
and therefore difficult to protect against entrance by mosquitoes. 
All selected houses were screened with galvanized wire cloth, 16 
mesh, the work being carefully done by carpenters and without cost 
to the tenants. The people were taught by house-to-house visits 
the importance of keeping the screens in good condition and the 
dangers of exposure after dark to mosquitoes on the outside of their 
homes. Each home was inspected at regular intervals throughout 
the season. No other measure was employed. 
The estimate of result was based on parasite index. An index 
taken in May, 1916, when the work began, showed an infection of 
11.97 per cent; a second index taken in December of the same year 
showed an infection of 3.52 per cent, @ reduction of 70.6 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-192
  194. THE ROCKEFELLER ReRUaX DATION 
Unfortunately, the index for May, 1917, which would have afforded 
a more instructive comparison, is wanting. On a visit during the 
season of the following year it was found that the screens were still in 
good repair and that the people—mainly typical plantation negroes— 
were convinced of their value. The average cost of screening for the 
community was $14.59 per house. Estimating the life of the screen 
at two years, the average annual cost would be $7.29. On this 
basis the annual per capita cost of the screening alone was $1.75. 
CONTROL BY IMMUNIZING WITH QUININE 
In another plantation community, immunizing quinine as a con- 
trol measure was put to similar test. This second community lay 
along the bank of a sluggish bayou, from which it derived its supply 
of anopheles. Under the direct supervision of the physician in 
charge, quinine was administered to all persons in the community in 
doses of five grains morning and evening—making ten grains a day— 
for two successive days each week. For children under fifteen years 
of age the dosage was reckoned at one grain for each three years and 
was administered in the same way. A parasite index taken in May, 
1916, at the beginning of the work, and again i in December of the 
same year, showed a reduction of 64. 45 per cent. Again the omis- 
sion of the index for May, 1917, must be regretted. The per capita 
cost of the work, omitting the nee was fifty-seven cents. 
These tests in malaria control by screening and by the adminis- 
tration of immunizing quinine are to be regarded as preliminary and 
their results as suggestive only. Generalization may be attempted 
only when they have been carried out on a much larger scale under a 
variety of conditions and with a more reliable measure of results. 
CONTROL BY TREATING THE CARRIERS 
Since all infected mosquitoes have derived their infection from the 
blood of infected persons, it is theoretically possible to prevent the 
infection of mosquitoes and thereby prevent the spread of malaria 
in a community by destroying the parasites in the blood of the human 
carrier. Robert Koch first suggested the possibility of controlling 
malaria by the treatment of carriers during a visit to Italy in 1898, 
and in 1900 demonstrated his theory by a definite reduction of the 
malaria rate in a small community of 734 persons at Stephansort, 
German New Guinea. The measure has been rather widely employed 
in German colonies and with varying degrees of success. Malaria 
has been reduced, but in no community does the method seem to have 
been put to an adequate test and with sufficient attention to measure 
of results and to counting of costs.

Initial Experiment in Bolivar County, Mississippi, 1916- 
1917. As a preliminary study, a two-year field experiment—in 
which more than 30,000 persons were registered—was conducted 
in Bolivar County, Mississippi, during 1916 and 1917. The large 
number of blood examinations confirmed with emphasis the impor- 
tance of the malaria carrier. Persons who have had clinical attacks 
are apt to carry the parasites in the blood for months after the 
clinical symptoms have disappeared. The examinations showed 
also that the usual doctor’s treatment of malaria, although breaking 
the chill and sending the patient“back to his work, does not, in most 
cases, sterilize his blood. The results of the chill tonics upon which 
so many people depend, are still less satisfactory. A very large 
percentage of malaria cases treated by physicians or by the use of 
chill tonics continue to carry the parasites for months after apparent 
cure, and to be therefore subject to relapse and a possible source of 
infection to others. These tests furthermore established the fact 
that ten grains of quinine a day for eight weeks sterilized the blood of 
about 90 per cent of the carriers to whom it was administered.! 
With this standard course of treatment established, effort was 
made during 1918 to carry out a test demonstration in malaria control 
by treating the carriers. 
Test Demonstration in Sunflower County, Mississippi, 1918. 
For purposes of the demonstration a typical rural area was selected 
in Sunflower County, Mississippi. This area, like the delta region 
in the heart of which it lies, is level, low-lying, and covered at fre- 
quent intervals with a net-and-patchwork of sluggish streams, bayous, 
and swamps. Mosquito breeding is abundant throughout the season 
and the cost of its control under present conditions is prohibitive. 
The area contains about 100 square miles and a population of about 
9,000, about 1,000 of these living in the town of Ruleville and about 
8,000 on cotton plantations under typical delta conditions. The 
blacks outnumber the whites by about four to one. Most of the 
negroes can read, but as compared with a white population living 
under similar conditions the grade of intelligence is relatively low. 
The dominant industry of the region is the growing of cotton; and 
the life of the community centers in and revolves about the cotton 
plantation. There are relatively few small farms operated by their 
owners, the prevailing type being the large plantation operated with 
negro tenant labor under the supervision of a resident manager. 
The disabling disease of the region is malaria. At cotton culti- 
vating and picking time, when labor is in greatest demand and when 
delay means direct money loss, malaria is most severe. It is esti- 
mated that from one-third to three-fourths of the people on these 
plantations have one or more attacks of malaria each year, and that 
1 There is reason to believe that this result does not hold for all conditions. It 
seems to be much more difficult, for example, to sterilize the blood of carriers in 
certain tropical regions.
-P-A-G-E-196
198 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
70 per cent or more of all sickness disability in the community is due 
to this cause. On one plantation, for example, having a tenant 
population of about 600, the average annual doctors’ bill for the last 
ten years has been approximately $4,000. Of this sum about $3,000, 
or $5.00 per capita, is attributed by the manager to'malaria. The 
loss to the tenant and to the landlord in crop returns is much larger. 
And since the landlord must look to the tenant’s crop both for return 
on his capital investment in land and equipment and for reimburse- 
ment for his large current advances to his tenant families, he is most 
deeply concerned in any condition which impairs the health and 
éfficiency of the workers on his plantation. 
The first step in the demonstration was to map the area, locating 
roads, streams, and homes; to take a census of the population; and to 
make a survey involving a record of each person on the census roll. 
This survey showed that of the rural population 40 per cent had had 
clinical malaria within twelve months; and that of the remaining 60 
per cent who had not had a clinical attack, 22 per cent had the para- 
sites in their blood. All persons giving a history of clinical malaria 
within twelve months, and those who were found by blood examina- 
tion to be carrying the parasites, were given sterilizing treatment— 
namely, ten grains a day for eight weeks. Effort was made by per- 
sonal instruction and by repeated house-to-house visits to have the 
prescribed course of treatment followed to the end. Irregularities 
occurred and are under such conditions inevitable, but in general 
the instructions were followed. In the rural area no other measures 
were employed. 
In the town of Ruleville malaria control was based in the main on 
anti-mosquito measures. Here inspection disclosed the fact that mos- 
quito breeding, which was abundant, was due almost exclusively to 
tunning hydrants and leaking pipes supplied: by flowing artesian 
wells. The problem was extremely simple. The enactment of an 
ordinance followed by the imposition of a number of fines resulted in 
the destruction of breeding places and the consequent extermination 
of mosquitoes in the town. . 
Resulis. Unfortunately no reliable record is available of the 
number of physicians’ calls within the area before the work began, 
and the second parasite index will not be taken until next season. 
The results of the test, in so far as they may be estimated in advance 
of the final report, may be summarized as follows: 
1. There has been no transmission of malaria within the town of 
Ruleville during the year, and the town has been free from the mos- 
quito as a pest. 
2. The degree of malaria control resulting from the measures 
carried out in the rural area is estimated by the director in charge at 
approximately 80 per cent. This estimate is based on the record 
of malaria histories, intimate observation during the season, informal 
reports by tenants and plantation managers, and regular monthly 
reports submitted by physicians. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 199 
3. Physicians practicing within the area report a marked decline 
in malaria cases. 
4, Plantation owners and managers operating within the area are 
of one accord in reporting an obvious decrease in malaria as compared 
with previous years. |One manager, for example, operates a large 
plantation within the demonstration area and a smaller one outside 
the area. The plantation under control has a tenant population of 
about 600, the one not under control about 180. The doctor’s bill 
for the year on the smaller plantation has been greater than on the 
large one. This difference he attributes altogether to the malaria 
control on the larger plantation. 
5. These reports and estimates were checked by personal inspec- 
tion on a recent house-to-house visit among tenant families on the 
plantations and among families in a community of small landed 
proprietors. The following record of the first ten families visited 
typifies the result:

Neighboring counties in Mississippi have asked that the work be

funds. The demonstration, however, is only begun. It is sug- 
gestive but far from complete. No conclusion will be attempted 
until the test has been continued over a period of years within the 
same area, has been tried under a variety of conditions, and has 
been submitted to a more definite measure of results.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSION 
By way of summary it may be said: 
1: That for the average town in our Southern States having a 
thousand or more inhabitants and a reasonably high infection rate, 
malaria control by anti-mosquito measures is economically feasible; 
that it is, in fact, a sound business investment. 
2. That in heavily infected regions where the cost of mosquito con- 
trol would be prohibitive, the amount of malaria may be greatly 
reduced by resort to screening, to immunizing quinine, or to destroy- 
ing the parasites in the blood of the human carriers. The indications 
would seem, in fact, to justify the hope that by the systematic appli- 
cation of these measures the malaria in a community may be held 
within reasonable bounds and that this result may be accomplished 
within limits of cost which the average community may well afford. 
3. That the people in these communities are prepared to provide 
the funds by public taxation for malaria control when they have been 
shown by demonstration that the program proposed will accomplish 
definite results which justify the expenditure. 
4. The results thus far accomplished would seem to justify con- 
tinuing these field experiments until the principal procedures which 
have been found useful in controlling malaria have been pretty thor- 
oughly tested separately and-thus evaluated. It will then be pos- 
sible to operate intelligently a combination program in which each 
control measure will be given its place and will receive varying 
emphasis from time to time according to the local conditions which 
have to be met. This freedom in the use of our tools will in turn 
contribute toward the object which we have in view; namely, the 
highest degree of malaria control consistent with a reasonably low 
per capita cost.

IX . 
TUBERCULOSIS IN FRANCE 
During 1918 the work of the Commission for the Prevention of 
Tuberculosis in France was continued under four departments or 
divisions: the Educational Division, the Medical Division, the De- 
partment of Nursing, and the Department of Extension. The main 
activities of each of these departments are summarized below: 
EDUCATIONAL DIVISION 
The educational division carried on four types of activity during 
the year: (1) traveling exhibits; (2) the distribution of literature; 
(3) publicity in newspapers and magazines; and (4) miscellaneous. 
Traveling Exhibits. Three traveling exhibits were active dur- 
ing the year, and at the close of the year a fourth and fifth were being 
prepared for operation. The further development of this particular 
activity will depend upon the general conditions in France, and the 
feasibility of extending this work under the mechanical and other 
difficulties which now exist. 
During 1918 the traveling exhibits visited ten departments. In 
seven of these their work was completed. The plan has been to 
hold meetings and campaigns in all communities with a population 
of over 3,000. In the departments already visited 141 such towns 
have been reached, and 875 lectures with demonstrations and exhib- 
its have been given. So far as possible this work is followed up in 
each department and community with a view to the organization 
by the French people of permanent activity in the several centers. 
Literature. From time to time, posters, pamphlets, and other 
material dealing with tuberculosis, of which there is now a fairly 
comprehensive series, have been published. This printed matter 
has been distributed widely throughout the whole of France. During 
the year, 2,115,708 pieces of printed matter were distributed. 
General Publicity. The co-operation of the French press has 
been gratifying. A series of twenty-four articles on tuberculosis, 
furnished by the Commission, has been published by thirty-three 
important provincial newspapers, and a large amount of additional 
space has also been obtained in these and various other departmental 
journals. 
Miscellaneous. The Commission also co-operated with’ the 
Children’s Bureau of the American Red Cross in the large exhibits 
held by the latter organization in Lyons, Marseilles, St. Etienne, and 
Toulouse. A tuberculosis exhibit was placed in the larger exhibit 
201 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  202 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
of the Children’s Bureau and a fairly complete series of educational 
‘panels and some models thus presented. A large amount of litera- 
ture was also distributed. In the four towns mentioned there was 
an attendance of over 300,000 people. 
MEDICAL DIVISION 
Following the plans adopted in 1917, the medical activities carried 
out during 1918 were largely concentrated upon the two demonstra- 
tions, one in the 19th arrondissement of Paris and the other in the 
Department of Eure-et-Loir. In the 19th arrondissement three 
model dispensaries with full personnel were operating at the close of 
the year, and a fourth, which will be the central dispensary, was 
about to open. Four central dispensaries, one in each arrondisse- 
ment, were in active operation in the Department of Eure-et-Loir, 
and six secondary dispensaries had been established and were in 
operation. : 
Opening of Additional Branch Dispensaries. Six additional 
secondary dispensaries for the Department of Eure-et-Loir had been 
nearly completed and were to commence operations early in 1919. 
Seven other secondary dispensaries had been determined upon and 
the sites for their installation obtained, although actual construc- 
tion had not begun. When these have been established the De- 
partment of Eure-et-Loir will 
have twenty-three dispensaries 
well distributed, and with the 
addition of one or two others 
the equipment of that Depart- 
ment, in so far as dispensaries 
are concerned, will be complete. 
The cost of establishing these 
dispensaries is very slight and 
is for the most part provided 
by funds obtained from the 
French themselves, or, as was 
the case in certain instances in 
the past, from the American 
Red Cross. 
Hospital Beds and Sana- 
torium for Early Cases. 
The French have already pro- 
vided or given definite assur- 
ance of providing additional 
hospital beds in the four chief 
Fig. 49.—Tuberculosis dispensary towns of the Department. The organization in Department of Eure- Department has also taken the

lishment of a sanatorium for early cases of tuberculosis, and there is 
little doubt that this project will be brought to a successful issue. 
The general equipment of the Department of Eure-et-Loir, from the 
point of view of the tuberculosis problem, may therefore be regarded 
as approximately complete. It is particularly gratifying, too, that 
each of the communities in which dispensaries are situated has 
organized French committees to provide the necessary material 
relief that was formerly obtained through funds from the American 
Red Cross. 
DEPARTMENT OF NURSING 
Forty-five visiting nurses, or Visiteuses d’Hygiene, as they are 
technically termed, were in active service for the Commission on 
December 31, 1918. Of these, twenty-two were in Paris and one in 
Versailles; fifteen were working in connection with the dispensaries in 
the Department of Eure-et-Loir; and seven were situated in other

parts of France in dispensaries operating entirely under French 
auspices. Two Visiteuses d’Hygiene, trained in the Commission’s 
dispensaries but paid by local French organizations, were also work- 
ing in co-operating dispensaries in Paris. Similarly, two others were 
in Bordeaux, working in dispensaries operated by that municipality 
and acting as supervisors in a training center which has been organ- 
ized in that city. 
Training Schools for Nurses. At the close of the year, there 
were three training schools for Visiteuses d’Hygiene in Paris, 
attended by thirty-three pupils for whom scholarships had been 
provided. In addition, twelve pupils who had been furnished schol- 
arships were completing their training in dispensaries located in the 
19th arrondissement of Paris; seven other pupil nurses were in the 
training center at Bordeaux; and four scholarships had been granted 
to pupils in a training school at Lyons organized in co-operation with 
the Commission. An additional training center had been opened in 
Nantes, but enrolment figures were not at hand. 
DEPARTMENT OF EXTENSION 
The task of stimulating the organization of anti-tuberculosis work 
in the various departments and communities of France was met as 
far as adequate personnel was available. The response by the 
French people has indeed been gratifying. The American Red 
Cross and the Commission have carried on activities of greater or 
less extent in twenty-seven departments of France. In these 
twenty-seven departments, twenty-one dispensaries were in existence 
at the time of the first visits. During the year fifty-seven new dis- 
pensaries were organized and were functioning at the end of the 
year. There'were also twenty dispensaries definitely provided for 
and in process of installation; and forty-nine other dispensaries 
definitely planned for, the installation of which could be reasonably 
regarded as assured for the near future. Fifteen laboratories had 
been established or arranged for; thirty-eight new nurses had been 
installed; and forty-two new and active committees had been or- 
ganized. 
Organization of Dispensary System in Other Departments. 
The bulk of the expense, not only in the establishment and installa- 
tion but in the maintenance of these activities, is provided from™ 
French sources. This field activity, which is after all the main 
object of the work, is now moving with extraordinary rapidity. 
Plans are being completed for the establishment by the French of a 
complete system of dispensaries in the Region du Nord, comprising 
the five departments recently re-occupied by the Allied forces and 
restored to France. Demands from numerous departments which 
have not yet been reached are also under consideration and will be 
taken up as soon as facilities permit,

FINANCIAL STATEMENT
-P-A-G-E-212
FINANCIAL STATEMENT 
The statement on the following pages shows 
that in the work of the International Health 
Board during the year 1918, a total of $1,121,- 
585.11 was expended. This statement is based 
on expenditures actually made during the cal- 
endar year 1918, regardless of when financial 
reports wére received at the New York office. 
It will be seen that the figures differ from those 
given in the Treasurer’s statement on pages 
281 to 355. The Treasurer’s Report includes 
amounts paid in the field during the first three 
quarters of 1918, to which in many instances 
have been added amounts paid during the fourth 
quarter of 1917, but not recorded until early in 
1918. This discrepancy between the two reports 
is caused by the necessity of closing the Treas- 
urer’s books shortly after the first of the calendar 
year, before detailed financial reports can be 
received from the foreign countries in which a 
large part of the work of the Board is conducted.

CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
During the year, construction work on the 
buildings of the Peking Union Medical College 
went forward. ‘The total number of members 
of the faculty proper was increased to thirty- 
four, and a large number of other persons were 
appointed to less important positions in connec- 
tion with the school. Contributions were paid 
to nineteen hospitals, three medical schools, and 
sixty-five fellows and scholars.

I. THE PEKING UNION MEDICAL 
COLLEGE 
The attention of the China Medical Board 
during the past year has been centered on the 
construction of the Peking Union Medical Col- 
lege and the securing of a competent faculty. 
Many obstacles have been encountered in the 
construction work, including export and trans- 
portation embargoes, high cost of materials 
during war-time, and the very unfavorable rate 
of exchange. Through the mediation of Minister 
Reinsch, the building materials were exempted 
from taxation. The construction work which 
has proceeded throughout the year has involved 
more expense than was originally expected. The 
present estimate on the land, the completed 
buildings, and the equipment calls for about 
five million dollars. 
At the request of the Board, Mr. Robert H. 
Kirk, Comptroller of the Rockefeller Foundation, 
went to Peking during the summer to study and 
report on the building operations there. He and 
Mr. Greene, acting under the authorization of 
the Board, drew up new contracts with Mr. 
Harry H. Hussey, who was to act thereafter as

architect only. Mr. B. Frank Bennett, asi 4 
superintendent of construction, is now in full 
charge of the building operations, on salary from 
the Board, and Mr. Charles E. Lane, of the 
architectural firm of Murphy and Dana, has 
been engaged as adviser. 
Progress has been made towards ee a 
faculty, although Dr. McLean, the Director, has 
been serving with the U. S. Army and has there- 
fore been unable to give as much attention as 
he wished to this work. During the earlier part 
of the year Dr. McLean was in Washington and 
was able to go to Baltimore or New York occa- 
sionally for conference; during the latter part 
he was in France.

A number of the members of the faculty have

graduate study and research, preparatory to 
taking up their duties at Peking when the 
buildings are completed and the school is opened 
for students. 
An announcement of the work of the Peking 
School has been printed and sent to four or five 
thousand persons interested in medical educa- 
tion in China. 
For the sake of the members of the staff who, 
on coming to China, will wish to learn the 
Chinese language, the Board has joined the 
North China Language School Union and has 
~* Appointed since December 31, 1918.

248 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
appointed Dr. Houghton and Dr. Stifler as its 
representatives on the school’s board of manage- 
ment. 
‘Two preparatory schools, the Peking Primary 
School and Kindergarten, and the North China 
American School at Tungchow, are receiving 
small sums from the Board, for it is expected 
that members of the faculty will send their 
children to these schools. . They are supported 
by the societies whose representatives use 
them.
-P-A-G-E-247
II. SHANGHAI MEDICAL SCHOOL 
The very unfavorable rates of exchange, and 
the increased cost of building materials which 
resulted from the war, made the construction 
work at Peking so expensive that it has been 
thought best to postpone building activities at 
Shanghai pending the completion of the Peking 
School. A careful survey and study of the whole 
situation from architectural, engineering, and 
building standpoints, to cover one and a half or 
two years, has been recommended before any 
construction is begun. As the completion of the 
buildings at Peking will require at least one and 
a half years longer, and as the new survey prob- 
ably should not be begun until the work on the 
Peking buildings has been finished, it seems 
likely that building operations in Shanghai will 
not be begun for at least three or four years. 
A gift amounting to $5,500 has been received 
from the Harvard Medical School of China, to 
be used toward the endowment of the Shanghai 
Medical School.

-P-A-G-E-248
II. OTHER MEDICAL WORK AIDED 
No new appropriations have been made for 
medical or pre-medical education. Payments 
have been continued on former appropriations 
to the medical schools of Yale, St. John’s Uni- 
versity, and the Shantung Christian University 
(Tsinanfu Union Medical College). 
Fukien Christian University and St. John’s 
University have not yet found themselves in 
position to make use of the grants of the China 
Medical Board for pre-medical work, beyond a 
single fellowship for a Chinese member of their 
scientific department which St. John’s University 
has asked for and received. 
In accordance with the Board’s policy of 
reducing its expenditures for work other than 
that of the Peking Union Medical College, fewer 
appropriations have been made for missionary 
hospitals than in former years, and in general 
these were small additions to appropriations 
already made rather than new undertakings. 
The largest appropriation to a new hospital was 
that to St. James Hospital at Anking, which has 
been granted funds toward buildings, equipment, 
and salaries. ‘The only other considerable appro- 
priations were made for the Foreign Christian

which for the past year or two has been receiving 
funds for salaries from the China Medical Board, 
and has for a long time been under consideration 
for the grants which have now been made for 
buildings, equipment, and operating expenses. 
Payments have been made to missionary 
societies during the year, to reimburse them for 
losses in exchange on their expenditures for work 
supported by the Board. 
About $90,000 was also spent for medical edu- 
cation exclusive of the Peking and Shanghai 
schools, and about $100,000 for missionary 
hospitals. Table 10 and Fig. 57 (pp. 262 and 
253) show the expenditures made by the Board 
from 1915 to 1918, and the pledges for future 
years. Fig. 56 (p. 251) gives the location of the

Statistics have been prepared for the several 
years of the Board’s existence on the basis of the 
number of persons actually studying. ‘Tables 
11 and 12 and Fig. 58 (pp. 263 and 257) show 
by years the number of fellowships and scholar- 
ships that have been used, and the total pay- 
ments that have been made on these accounts, 
together with pledges for future years. 
MISCELLANEOUS 
Small grants have been made for several years 
to the Nurses’ Association of China and the 
Publication Committee of the China Medical 
Missionary Association for work in translation. 
These have not been intended to commit the 
Board to any system of translation, but merely 
to help along temporarily a worthy work. 
The appropriation this year for the Publication 
Committee amounted to $5,500 and included 
part stipend for Dr. Cousland, who is in charge 
sion. After the completion of their courses, which some of them are 
nearing, they will remain in the United States for an interneship, 
and possibly for further graduate study, and then return to China 
for service under one of the missionary societies or this Board. 
Two other men from the Harvard Medical School of China, Mr. 
Zau-yoong Zee and Mr. Mur-sung Ting, have been studying at St. 
John’s University in Shanghai under small grants from the China 
Medical Board. 
Mr. Cheuk-shang Mei, another undergraduate medical student, 
holds a small fellowship for work at Columbia University leading 
towards the degrees of Doctor of Medicine and Master of Arts.

ants. 
Three eminent Chinese educators, Mr. Fan 
Yuan-lien, recently Minister of Education, Mr. 
Yen Hsiu, a Hanlin scholar of the old regime, and 
Mr. F. 'T. Sun, President of the School of Fisher- 
ies at Tientsin, spent several months in the 
United States. The Board was able to assist 
them in getting in touch with the leading author- 
ities on education in this country. 
OFFICERS OF THE BOARD 
At the December meeting of the Board, the 
General Director, Dr. Wallace Buttrick, stated 
that owing to his many duties as President of the 
General Education Board, he was obliged to 
resign from the directorship of the China Medi- 
cal Board. His resignation was accepted and 
Dr. George E. Vincent was appointed to succeed 
him. Mr. Edwin R. Embree, Secretary of the 
Rockefeller Foundation, is Secretary of the 
China Medical Board, and also of the Boards of 
Trustees of the Peking Union Medical College 
and of the Shanghai Medical School of the

FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH 
SPECIAL WAR ACTIVITIES 
Report of the Director of Laboratories
-P-A-G-E-264

-P-A-G-E-265
  To the President of the Rockefeller Foundation: 
Sir:— 
I have the honor to submit herewith my re- 
port of the special war activities of the Rocke- 
feller Institute for Medical Research, which 
have been supported by the Rockefeller Foun- 
dation for the period January 1, 1918, to Decem- 
ber 31, 1918. 
Respectfully yours, 
SIMON FLEXNER, 
Director of Laboratories.

WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER 
' INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL 
RESEARCH 
During 1918 the Rockefeller Foundation con- 
tinued its special appropriations to the Rocke- 
feller Institute for the support of war activities 
outside the precise scope of the normal work of 
the Institute, which is to promote medical 
discovery through research. Upon the entrance 
of the United States into the war, the Institute 
adjusted its activities to a war basis and equipped 
its several laboratories so that they would sup- 
plement the various research laboratories at the 
command of Government. In scientific research 
looking toward the prevention and the curative 
treatment of disease, it had already made con- 
tributions which offered immediate application 
to the medical problems likely to arise in con- 
nection with the greatly enlarged personnel of 
the Army and Navy: among these were the 
curative serums which it had developed for 
epidemic meningitis and for one of the forms of 
pneumonia—diseases which have always ap- 
peared with great force in large military organi- 
zations,—and the method of treating infected 
surgical wounds which Doctors Carrel and Dakin 
had perfected and which had come to have wide 
16 269
-P-A-G-E-268
270 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
applicability in practice. Inasmuch as it was 
evident that other medical and allied problems 
would call for investigation, the entire resources 
of the Institute were placed freely at the disposal 
of the Surgeons General and other government 
officials. 
INSTRUCTION AT WAR DEMONSTRATION HOSPITAL 
In order to carry out on a large scale the teach- 
ing of the Carrel-Dakin treatment for infected 
wounds, the Rockefeller Foundation built on the 
grounds of the Institute a portable military base 
hospital. Completed in the summer of 1917, 
the hospital continued in active operation 
throughout 1918. Instruction was given during 
the year to medical officers and enlisted men of 
the United States Army and Navy, to civilian 
surgeons, and to nurses of the Red Cross and of 
civil hospitals. The total number of persons 
receiving instruction during the year was 998. 
The staff consists of surgeons assigned by the 
Surgeon General of the United States Army, 
of French military surgeons lent. by the French 
Sanitary Service, and of bacteriologists and 
chemists in part assigned by the Surgeon Gen- 
eral of the United States Army. Most of the 
instruction has been given to the men in classes 
conducted in the laboratories, in the wards, and 
in the operating room, and by lectures with lan-  
-P-A-G-E-269
  WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 271 
tern slides and moving pictures. Class work has 
been arranged in the following manner: 
Surgical Course: ‘Two weeks’ instruction in 
the treatment of infected wounds. ‘Twenty- 
seven courses given. 
Chemistry Course: Organized April 1, 1918. 
Three days’ instruction in the chemistry of 
antiseptics. Six courses given. 
Laboratory Course: Course organized July 
1, 1918. One week’s instruction in laboratory 
methods used in conjunction with wound treat- 
ment. ‘Three courses given. 
Special Instruction: At various times special 
instruction has been given to individual medical 
officers, doctors, nurses, and enlisted men. 
Special demonstrations have also been arranged 
or groups of doctors, nurses, etc., and for medi- 
cal officers under instruction elsewhere in New 
York or from base hospitals. 
A detailed report of the number of persons 
receiving instruction is as follows:

TREATMENT AT WAR DEMONSTRATION HOSPITAL 
During the year, 237 patients received treat- 
ment in the hospital. On August 31 the first 
returned soldier was admitted to the hospital. 
Since that time most of the patients admitted 
have been men returned from France. Volun- 
teer reconstruction aides have been working in 
the wards since August 1. ; 
With the going into effect of the armistice, the 
work of the War Demonstration Hospital did not 
cease. In the first place, the patients still under 
treatment required care until they were ready to 
be transferred to other hospitals or to be returned 
to their commands. Next, the Surgeon General 
requested the courses of instruction to be con- 
tinued for another period of three months in 
order that regular army surgeons who had not
-P-A-G-E-272
  274 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
attended the classes might receive the benefit of 
the training. The Foundation made a special 
appropriation of $55,000 to enable the hospital 
to continue in active operation until April 1, 
1919. 
COURSES IN BACTERIOLOGY, ETC. 
The classes in bacteriology, chemistry, and 
technical instruction were continued throughout 
the year except for a break during the height of 
the influenza epidemic in October and November.

The instruction in these several subjects

that the classes under way were carried to the 
completion of the courses. 
PRODUCTION OF SERUM 
The preparation of serums by the Institute, 
and the distribution of these to Government 
hospitals, have constituted another Foundation- 
supported contribution to the war. At the time
-P-A-G-E-273
WAR WORK OF THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 275 
of the signing of the armistice, the serum produc- 
tion for the treatment of meningitis, pneu- 
monia, and dysentery was at its height. The 
number of doses supplied increased from 3,000 
in 1917 to 25,000 in 1918. It is estimated that 
the output for the first three months of 1919 
will far exceed the entire output for 1918. 
The following summary shows the amounts 
of different kinds of serums which were dis- 
tributed during 1918:

In addition to the above amounts, twenty- 
eight liters of antipneumococcus serum were 
used for instruction purposes in the sixteen bac- 
teriological courses, making a total of 92.79 
liters of antipneumococcus serum supplied in 
1918. 
Of the 41.98 liters of Type I serum supplied, 
27.9 liters were for therapeutic use and the 
remaining 14.08 liters for diagnostic purposes.

The above serum was obtained from two

Attention is directed to the fact that in the 
case of the serums for pneumonia a distinction 
is drawn between what is called “therapeutic” 
and ‘“‘diagnostic” uses. While several kinds of 
serums can be produced for the purpose of deter- 
mining the particular or specific type of pneu- 
mococcus causing given cases of pneumonia, 
only one kind of serum, namely that directed 
against so-called Pneumococcus Type I, is 
practically effective in the treatment of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
278 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
disease. Hence it becomes necessary in every 
case of pneumonia to determine promptly the 
type of pneumococcus responsible for the disease. 
This is done by means of the diagnostic serum. 
If the pneumococcus discovered is a Type I 
organism, then the Type I serum should be ad- 
ministered; otherwise not, as it has no effect on 
cases of pneumonia caused by other types of 
pneumococcus, of which several are known. 
ANTIGASEOUS GANGRENE SERUM 
At the time of the cessation of hostilities the 
control of gaseous gangrene appeared near at 
hand. The investigation carried out at the 
Institute on that subject, under the appropria- 
tion from the Foundation for war research, 
opened the way for the production of an anti- 
serum not only for the gas bacillus (B. welchii) 
but also for other anaerobic bacteria occurring in | 
cultivated soils, which often accompanied the 
gas bacillus in wounds and intensified its destruc- 
tive action. Experiments to enlarge the thera- 
peutic properties of the antigaseous gangrene 
serum so as to include the other bacterial species 
mentioned are so well advanced that it is safe to 
conclude that a permanent addition has been 
made to the measures now available for pre- 
venting gaseous gangrene, or for curing it when 
 
-P-A-G-E-277

it arises in connection with the industrial and 
other accidents of civil life. 
TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS 
The new drug which has been prepared for 
the treatment of syphilis has been administered 
in the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute to 
126 patients belonging to the armed forces of 
the nation,—seventy-nine from the Army and 
forty-seven from the Navy. As one result of 
the precise tests thus carried out, the drug has 
been issued to a small number of general hos- 
pitals in which syphilis is treated. It is hoped 
soon to collate all the records based on the cases 
treated with the drug in different institutions, so 
as to arrive at a decision as to the limitations of 
its usefulness, if there are any such limitations, 
and also as to the best manner of its adminis- 
tration. Until this is done, the drug will not be 
offered for general employment. 
CONTINUATION OF WAR-TIME MEDICAL 
INVESTIGATIONS 
The investigations which were taken up under 
war circumstances can in many instances be 
continued with advantage and applied to the 
conditions arising in times of peace. The close 
of hostilities has permitted the laboratory erected 
at St. Cloud to be discontinued, and Doctor 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  280 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Carrel and his staff are now in New York, where, 
under far more favorable physical conditions, 
they can continue the investigations upon which 
they were at work. In the Hospital of the 
Rockefeller Institute the researches on strep- 
tococci, taken up during the epidemics of pneu- 
monia following measles and influenza in the 
Army camps, will be carried to a conclusion 
because of their intrinsic importance and the 
menace which streptococcic infections present in 
civil life.

The undisbursed balance carried over from 1917, after 
adding sundry refunds, was, $11,630,164.68. This, added 
to income as above, made a total of $20,239,875.36 avail- 
able for disbursement. Of this sum $15,050,202.16 was 
disbursed, leaving a balance of $5,189,673.20, applicable 
to the following uses: 
Amount due on appropriations made 
in 1918 and prior years, not yet

The pledges that become effective in 1919 amount to 
$7,934,641.70. This sum is considered a charge against. 
income for 1919. If treated as a present liability it follows 
that income as of December 31, 1918, is exceeded by 
appropriations to the extent of $4,883,492.83.

-P-A-G-E-284
  286 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Additional appropriations which become effective in 
1920 and subsequent years, amounting to $2,271,395.00, 
are considered as charges against the income for the years 
in which they become payable. 
The $1,000,000.00 given by Mr. Rockefeller, mentioned 
above, was in payment of his pledges of $500,000.00 each 
toward the Foundation’s contributions to the American 
Red Cross and United War Work Campaign. 
On January 30, 1918, the Harvard Medical School of 
China transferred to the Foundation, under a trust agree- 
ment, the sum of $25,000, which is to be known as the 
Henry Sturgis Grew Memorial Fund. 
On July 23, 1918, the Harvard Medical School of China 
gave to the Foundation the sum of $5,500. This gift is to 
be known as the Arthur Theodore Lyman Endowment, 
and the income applied to the uses of the Shanghai Medi- 
cal School. 
There have been no other changes in principal funds 
during the year, excepting a gain in the reserve fund 
amounting to $42,123.47, as shown in Exhibit P. 
Land, buildings and equipment acquired during the year, 
by the expenditure of income, cost $1,704,059.74, as shown 
in Exhibit O. The amount carried in this account as an 
asset is thus increased from last year’s figure of $809,612.80 
to $2,513,672.54.

492.83. Nor are additional appropriations and pledges, amounting to $2,: O71 ,= 
395.00, which become effective in 1920 and subsequent years, included in the balance sheet. Both of these liabilities are, for the purposes of this report, eon- 
sidered as charges against the income for the years in which they become payable.

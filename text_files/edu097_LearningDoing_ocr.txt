  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
The chief business of the child and of the youth 
in American life to-day is to master some portion 
of the knowledge and the skill which our ancestors 
have found of service in their experiences in the art 
of living; and it follows that the chief problems of 
the parent and the teacher have to do with helping 
the young to acquire this knowledge and skill in an 
economical and effective manner. No one in our 
time, who is at all familiar with the matter, can 
doubt that both the child and his instructor, whether 
he be parent or teacher, have to deal with a very 
complicated situation in the present-day home and 
school. There is a constantly increasing body of 
material to be learned, and the period for learning 
it is not being extended, so that it is becoming ever 
more imperative for those who instruct the young 
to adopt methods of procedure which will enable the 
novice to master what he must learn without waste 
of time or energy. This is, of course, an ideal 
which has not yet been attained in any of our edu- 
cational work, as every student of education and 
every intelligent parent and teacher knows very 
well. But we are certainly making progress. We 
are discovering from time to time how to guide the 
child so that he will appropriate the more readily 
and competently what we believe we ought to teach 
him. Doubtless most of those who will read these 
lines have witnessed marked changes in the teach- 
ing of practically every subject in the curriculum of 
the elementary and the high school; and probably 
these changes have all been in the direction of at- 
taining greater economy and efficiency in educa-

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
But the end is not yet; it is probable, indeed, that 
the principal work of improvement in teaching proc- 
esses is still ahead of us. Surely there has never 
been a time, in any age or place, when educational 
curricula and methods have been studied by such 
precise methods as are being employed right now, 
both at home and abroad. It is becoming clearer 
every day that the whole business of teaching is so 
complex that the practical teacher can not solve the 
problems of the schoolroom, because his time and 
energy must be expended in doing the best he can 
according to the prevailing and generally accepted 
views of instruction. The practitioner needs the 
assistance of the investigator, who will delve deeply 
into one or another of the problems arising out of 
the necessity of leading the young to master a great 
many things in such a way that they can make use 
of them in bettering their adjustment to the world 
of people and of things environing them. 
For a number of years Professor Edgar James 
Swift has been conducting experiments for the pur- 
pose of gaining some accurate data pertaining to 
the more subtle phases of the processes of acquiring 
certain kinds of knowledge, and mastering certain 
manual activities. In this work he has had a prac- 
tical end in view, so that his researches have related 
more or less directly to the problems which the 
teacher encounters in giving her pupils instruction 
in any school subject. Asa result of his investiga- 
tions, Professor Swift has apparently shown that a 
pupil does not pursue a regular, unbroken and uni- 
form course in the mastery of any study, but in- 
stead he seems to proceed rapidly at one period of 
his learning, and slowly or not at all at another 
period. In the present volume, Professor Swift 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
describes his own experiments and those of other 
investigators, and he points out how the results of 
these inquiries may explain some of the phenomena 
of the class room that are often perplexing to the 
teacher. He also makes suggestions respecting the 
teaching of the various school studies which should 
be of assistance to all who instruct the young, in 
enabling them particularly to help pupils over the 
periods of retardation in their learning,—the “pla- 
teau periods,” as they are coming to be styled in 
present-day psychological literature. 
Professor Swift’s book is wholly constructive. 
It is also appreciative. He gives evidence in every 
chapter of his volume that he is aware of the dif- 
ficulties under which the parent and teacher work, 
and his purpose is, first, to assist them to under- 
stand the child whom they must instruct, in respect 
to certain of his interests and tendencies and intel- 
lectual traits, and, second, to show what relation 
the learner must assume toward the things he is 
required to learn in order that he may gain them 
with as little resistance and as great efficiency as 
possible. All the matters treated are presented in a 
simple and direct, but lively style, and in non- 
technical language; and it may be hoped that the 
book will find its way into the hands of many par- 
ents and teachers, who can hardly fail to be inter- 
ested in and profited by reading it.

  PREFACE 
The industrial and commercial changes which 
have followed one another in rapid succession dur- 
ing the last three or four decades have brought in 
their wake new educational problems. As a direct 
outgrowth of these changes comes the insistent de- 
mand for a reorganization of our public schools 
that they may better fit children to meet the new 
conditions, 
Superintendents and boards of education have 
tried to satisfy the new requirements by enlarging 
the curriculum and, in some cases, by introducing 
vocational guidance and training. The writer is in 
hearty agreement with the spirit of these changes, 
but he also believes that the manner of conducting 
the work of the school may be improved, and it is 
with this question, together with progress and econ- 
omy in learning, that the present book is chiefly con- 
cerned. Why should the school program be sepa- 
rated into the subjects which the children learn by 
doing and those which they learn from the teacher’s 
instruction and from books? Why could not both 
methods be combined? The writer is of the opin- 
ion that the principle of “learning by doing” is 
applicable to all the studies of the school and that it 
should cease to be merely an attachment to school 
methods, to be used in certain subjects, such as man- 
ual training, and in a few others on “laboratory 
days.” The instruction from teacher and books 
should accompany or follow the achievements of the 
pupils in the things they are trying to do. In this 
way instruction assumes its proper rdle, that of 
putting meaning into the work in which the pupils
-P-A-G-E-10
PREFACE 
are engaged, and of making it more intelligible. 
The writer has tried to show by illustrations of or- 
ganized group-work how this may be done. 
Another consequence of the new industrial era is 
the attempt to shorten the educational period pre- 
ceding self-support. This early entrance into indus- 
try is likely to end by depriving children of much 
of their childhood, and the question is therefore 
pertinent whether the two aims—to conserve child- 
hood and to prepare for the serious problems of 
adult life—may not be combined in an educational 
program that preserves the advantage of each. 
The writer gratefully acknowledges his indebted- 
ness to Miss Caroline G. Soule, of Brookline, Mas- 
sachusetts, who kindly read the manuscript and 
made many valuable suggestions. E.J.S.

CHAPTER I 
THE REVOLT FROM MONOTONY 
HAT was a fine appreciation of boyhood 
dreams and thrills which Robert Louis Ste- 
venson showed in his Gossip on Romance: “Give 
The: romantic me a highwayman,” he said, “and 
spirit of youth I was full to the brim; a Jacobite 
would do, but the highwayman was my favorite 
dish. I can still hear that merry clatter of the 
hoofs along the moonlit lane; night and the com- 
ing of day are still related in my mind with the 
doings of John Rann or Jerry Abershaw; and the 
words “postchaise,’ the ‘great North road,’ ‘ostler,’ 
and ‘nag,’*still sound in my ears like poetry. One 
and. all, at least; and each with his particular fancy, 
we read story-books in childhood, not for eloquence 
or character or thought; but for some quality of 
the brute incident. . . . Certain dank gardens cry 
aloud for,a murder; certain old houses demand to

be haunted; certain coasts are set apart for ship- 
wreck.” 
One need only look into any city back yard on 
almost any fine day to realize the perennial per- 
sistence of this quest for adventure. For country 
children life is fairly aquiver with vivid experience. 
Only a few weeks ago while in the country I came 
across a group of boys and girls—the oldest, a boy, 
was just past ten—decked out with feathers and 
carrying wooden knives for scalping the long-haired 
girls, and toy guns with which they were shooting 
two innocent little puppies who indiscreetly insisted 
on coming back to life. The camp-fire was a more 
ingenious invention than I had yet seen. It was a 
pile of dry brush with red flowers for fire, because 
the children had no matches. Such is the imagina- 
tion of childhood. 
Conscience and convention, often synonymous 
terms, will have many sins to explain away on 
An error of the day of judgment, but not 
of judgment their least offense is unthinking 
condemnation of feelings and thoughts and acts 
which surge up in children from the stormy life 
of the far distant past when war and slaughter 
made up the usual daily routine, and pillage was 
but a vacation’s rest from the more strenuous ex- 
ertions of man’s customary business engagements. 
Children suffer most from this assumed austerity 
because their lives, when passed in normal sur- 
roundings, are but day-dreams of camp-fires, forays

and scouting, with occasional tomahawking and 
scalping excursions thrown in for coloring. 
Of course the conventional view does not refuse 
such sports to children’ when conditions are favor- 
Demand for early able, but games are not regarded 
self-support as an essential element of normal 
growth and so are not included in the plan of edu- 
cation. All educators agree on the importance of 
childhood’s freedom, so as to give the nerve cen- 
ters time to mature before the strains of business 
life are put upon them, but the demand is insistent 
for rapid preparation of children for self-support. 
One evidence for this demand is the loud call for 
vocational training. Since the apprentice system 
passed away in the industrial reconstruction no ad- 
equate plan for combining study and work has 
been found to take its place. The result is increas- 
ing dissatisfaction with the length of time needed 
after finishing school to prepare for profitable em- 
ployment.* It is not the present purpose of the 
writer to argue the wisdom of this view. Changed 
conditions often put requirements upon us which it 
is useless to oppose. Vain resistance to new social 
and industrial demands loses time which could bet- 
ter be used in planning to meet the change intelli- 
gently instead of drifting. Whether we believe 
the claims of industry wise or not, vocational train- 
ing is now a factor to be reckoned with. 
 ¥ The writer is, of course, aware of the combination of 
shop and school work in certain towns and cities. But the 
plan has not become general enough to quiet the clamor.

  If, therefore, the opinion still prevails that child- 
hood has its rights to freedom of thought and 
Purpose of this action, the coming of vocational 
chapter training gives us a new problem 
for solution. How may childhood be conserved in 
the shorter cut to self-support? This is a problem 
for teachers, and one of the purposes of the present 
chapter is to reexamine the claims of childhood 
to see whether a deeper knowledge of its needs 
may not enable us to secure aid for our work in 
education from the very instincts which are often 
thought to be in opposition to the school. If we 
succeed in finding such assistance we shall gain a 
double advantage through increasing the output of 
education and, at the same time, satisfying the in- 
stinctive needs of childhood. 
A certain amount of leisure is needed that play 
may have its place, but the severe industrial life

tween industry plete relaxation. Among men 
Oly who labor by the day, if their 
children’s help is not required to make ends meet 
they needs must work when school is over; and 
even with the well-to-do few plans are made beyond 
giving children the freedom of the streets. Were 
it necessary to argue the lack of interest in activ- 
ities that make for normal growth the difficulty 
of securing parks and playgrounds might be men- 
tioned. Schoolhouses, also, are built within enclo-

  THE REVOLT FROM MONOTONY 5 
sures hardly large enough in which to pack the 
children. 
Children have not yet acquired the derived inter- 
ests which in later life will dominate thought and 
i action. There are few men even Children unaf- - 4 : 
fected by derived who do not at times begin their 
adult interests = day’s work with regret. What 
keeps them at their tasks is desire for reputation 
among thinkers in their field, or standing in the 
business world, or habit, which will not loose its 
hold, if not the lower wish for money. Such de- 
rived interests as these which keep men regretfully 
at their work have not yet taken possession of chil- 
dren in school. Their thoughts and interests are 
those that give pleasure at the moment and to 
these they yield undisputed power. Their estimate 
of the things in which adults engage is pictured 
by Kenneth Grahame’s rollicking youngsters: “On 
the whole, the existence of these Olympians 
[adults] seemed to be entirely void of interests, 
even as their movements were confined and slow, 
and their habits stereotyped and senseless. ... They 
never set foot within fir-wood or hazel-copse, nor 
dreamt of the marvels hid therein. . . . They were 
unaware of Indians, nor recked they anything of 
bisons or of pirates (with pistols!), though the 
whole place swarmed with such portents. They 
cared not about exploring for robbers’ caves, nor 
digging for hidden treasure.”
-P-A-G-E-24
LEARNING AND DOING 
  Despite their sober exterior and seemingly “ster- 
eotyped and senseless habits,” most of these Olym- 
Why adults read pians are as ready to slip away 
books of ad- into the enchanted land as Ste- 
veotate venson has so entertainingly ad- 
mitted for himself. Not many adults, however, 
acknowledge as boldly as he does the absorbing 
fascination of adventures but, if one observes 
groups of men and women “off duty” for a week 
or two, books of this type, when they can be found, 
are working overhours. It has been the writer’s 
privilege to pass several summers in a company of 
over fifty, largely college graduates, among whom 
were a generous proportion of college professors 
and secondary school-teachers. The conspicuous 
fact observed concerning their reading was this pre- 
dominance of books of adventure. Their excuse 
was that these stories gave most complete rest. 
Doubtless this was true, but there were many other 
books at hand which did not put a greater strain 
on thought. Why does this class of books excel 
the others in affording rest? The popular assump- 
tion that relaxation is directly proportional to for- 
getfulness of all else except the story is probably 
not far wrong. If this is true we are again reduced 
to our original question: why do stories of ad- 
venture hold us closer than other sorts of books? 
To be specific even at the risk of seeming ungrate- 
ful to a writer who has been a solace in many 
a weary hour: why is Sherlock Holmes—who re-

peats his two or three stock phrases until they have 
become popular newspaper jokes and who is as 
innocent of originality as a desert is of grass— 
presented to us almost yearly by a new publisher? 
Why, again, did Mr. Doyle, after murdering 
Holmes, no doubt in a fit of anger at the detective’s 
lack of originality, and after writing his memoirs, 
resurrect him in a third volume? There can be 
but one answer. The public would not let him 
stay dead. It looks as though Stevenson were not 
far wrong when he continues in his Gossip on 
Romance: “Conduct is three parts of life, they say; 
but I think they put it high. There is a vast deal 
in life and letters both which is not immoral, but 
simply a-moral; . . . where the interest turns, not 
upon what a man shall choose to do, but on how 
he manages to do it; not on the passionate slips and 
hesitations of the conscience, but on the problems of 
the body and of the practical intelligence, in clean, 
open-air adventure, the shock of arms or the diplo- 
macy of life.” 
' But the case for the hold which adventures have 
on us is not closed with the books that we read. 
The perennial Why are certain games perennial ? 
zest for sports Recreation is the usual reason of- 
fered for the enjoyment of sports, but this does not 
explain the striking partiality for certain kinds of 
games. Upward of forty thousand persons regularly 
attend the Yale-Princeton, Harvard-Yale and An- 
napolis-West Point football contests, and there 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
8 LEARNING AND DOING 
  have been records of nearly twice that number. A 
writer in the Nineteenth Century,* speaking of this 
game, says: “Thrice during the last season the 
writer witnessed matches in violent snow-storms; 
and on one of these occasions, with snow and slush 
ankle deep on the ground, the downfall was so 
severe that a layer of more than an inch of snow 
accumulated on the shoulders and hats of the enthu- 
siasts, who were packed so closely together that 
they could not move to disencumber themselves.” 
Why this uninterrupted popularity for a game 
which has been played in England since the thir- 
teenth century? The exciting spectacles of the 
Roman Circus Maximus, again, drew, at times, as 
many as four hundred eighty-five thousand spec- 
tators. 
Recent investigations+ seem to help us in under- 
standing the partiality for certain types of games. 
Tis ‘acientific Practically all of those that re- 
explanation turn as inevitably as the seasons 
had their counterpart among the aborigines. Hand- 
ball, basketball, football, tennis, shinny and many 
others were played in some form by those who pre- 
ceded us on this continent. There can be but one 
explanation of these endless games. It is the call 
of the race.

prevent the occupant from falling through, without 
sheets, and covered with blankets that have been 
used, unwashed, by many an illustrious hunter; and 
with it all they must daub their faces with greasy 
tar as protection against ravenous black flies until 
the painted savage of darkest Africa would wel- 
come them as friends; and this they do that they 
may hunt. The writer, to give another instance, 
has seen men fishing in the lakes of Northern Wis- 
consin with the mosquitoes so thick and blood- 
thirsty on their faces that they could only be re- 
moved by scraping with the hand. But the sport 
of fishing was worth it. If men will go through 
such torture and call it fun there must be something 
deep down in their nature that makes it worth the 
game. And that “something” seems to be the prim- 
itive instincts which civilization has been unable 
wholly to eradicate. ‘ 
We have been speaking of men with business or 
professional interests to occupy their minds. What, 
then, is the situation with children who, as we know, 
have not yet acquired the derived interests that 
look to the future and whose thoughts and feelings 
are concerned with activities similar to those of 
early man?

The following is from an unusually successful

because, as adults, we see through the pretense that 
such acts are bad and realize that they should have 
been directed and utilized rather than suppressed ?

thoughtful of the needs of boys and their wish to 
do things. The only person who took any interest,

THE REVOLT FROM-MONOTONY 11 
in boy nature as it was, and appreciated our desire 
for adventure, was a Y. M. C. A. secretary with 
whom I spent two years. We boys would have died 
for him. All of my teachers seemed to have the 
idea that a boy was a sort of wild creature and the 
sooner he were tamed the better. And the figure 
may be applied further—they used many of the 
methods on us that are used in taming wild animals. 
- I must admit that we boys were often mischievous 
under the leadership of the secretary, but the great 
contrast is that afterward we were genuinely sorry 
for what we did, while we boasted loudly of what 
we had done at school. 
“The first and most important relation of a teach- 
er to his pupils is that of mutual respect. A pupil 
very quickly learns whether a teacher really has an 
interest in him or whether he is simply standing as 
a bulwark of the law. Hearing the racial call of 
schildren for adventure has not caused all ‘troubles’ 
to disappear from my class room, but the different 
atmosphere creates a different spirit, and the ‘rebel- 
lious’ feeling does not arise. The work of the pu- 
pils has certainly improved both in quantity and 
quality. Boys have an irresistible desire for activ- 
ity. They want to be doing something. If this 
desire is suppressed they are likely to break loose. 
Lack of sympathy for the things they want to do 
draws them within themselves for satisfaction. At 
least it was so with me, and I think that I observe 
the same tendency in school children to-day.”

  THE REVOLT FROM MONOTONY 13 
“One winter a young woman came as assistant 
in the high school. She was different from the type 
of teacher we were used to, since, as we soon 
learned, it had been her custom to take walking 
trips during the summer vacations. We boys were, 
naturally, pretty skeptical about a woman doing 
much walking and one day several of us joked her 
about it in the presence of the principal. He imme- 
diately proposed that as many of the boys and girls 
as desired should challenge her to walk to some lum~ 
ber camps, ten or fifteen miles distant, on the fol- 
lowing Saturday. He quietly told us to have my 
horse and cutter ready, with one of the smaller 
boys to drive it, so that if necessary we could give 
the teacher a ride. This pleased us so much and 
made us so excited that we hardly slept until Satur- 
day came. We started out early in the morning 
through the snow, and the teacher made good, 
walking the entire distance. Some of us boys would 
have been glad to get into the cutter had it not been 
for our pride, and I think that the principal him- 
self would not have objected to a ride. It is need- 
less to say that the teacher had us on her side from 
that time. The question of discipline never arose 
while this principal was connected with the school. 
There was no need for discipline. We did not 
know what it meant. The school simply went on 
with no trouble and we all worked. Few high-school 
boys were seen loafing on the streets and there was 
no drinking or smoking among us. The activities  
-P-A-G-E-32
14 LEARNING AND DOING 
in which we engaged under the leadership of this 
principal, with the encouragement of parents who 
understood what he was doing, took up our time so 
completely that there was little desire for mischief. 
The principal suggested many sports in which he 
could not participate, but he took part with us in 
enough of them to show that he meant what he 
said. My own experience, both as a pupil under 
him and later as teacher and principal, has taught 
me that this last is very important. Talking, alone, 
does not go very far. Boys soon get a feeling that 
it is done to ‘work’ them. That trip which the 
principal took with us to the lumber camps and his 
activity on the school grounds did more to make 
us feel that he was really one of us and interested 
in us than any amount of talking could possibly 
have done. The town was considered a hard one, 
and plenty of toughs had been produced in the 
school. The principals preceding the one of whom 
I have been speaking were complete failures in mat- 
ters of discipline and one or two had been literally 
thrown out of the building by the boys.” 
The following is from a successful teacher—now 
the principal of a grammar school—who, since his 
A different type father taught before him, 
of experience was brought close to the educa- 
tional ideal, “brought up by hand” one might al-

For these reasons his opinion of his school-days, 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE REVOLT FROM MONOTONY 15 
revised and analyzed in the light of his later experi- 
ences as a teacher, are particularly instructive. The 
contrast, in method and results, with the boys and 
principal of whom we have just read, is decidedly 
suggestive. 
“Like most of my schoolmates, I was a healthy 
vigorous boy with a persistent desire for activity 
which was not furnished by the school or home. So 
we drifted into all sorts of scrapes. Many of the 
things we did were all right, but there was no one 
to encourage and guide us. On this account even 
the valuable activities became a source of trouble 
to our teachers and ourselves. For example, one 
of our favorite midday games was ‘fox and geese,’ 
and as that, like ‘hare and hounds,’ took us quite 
a distance from the school we were frequently 
tardy, and, boylike, when caught in something 
wrong we ‘invented’ excuses. Had our teachers 
taken an interest in our game and sometimes played 
it with us, I am certain we would have been saved 
from most of our tardiness and from all of our 
falsehoods. But they condemned us and looked on 
us as bad to the core—at least this was the opinion 
which we formed—though we were just normal 
healthy boys giving vent to our youthful spirits. 
“Another game, harmless when helped along by 
a little sympathy and guidance, was ‘Indian,’ which 
was played on Saturday afternoons. We had our 
chief and we terrorized the small boys of the com-

  munity, even taking them to our den—a cave a mile 
or more out in the woods—and there making them 
dance for us. One little chap who had ‘tattled’ on 
us several times—and here is shown another bad 
method of my school—we shut up in our den for 
the night. When he did not return to supper a 
search was instituted and he was found. Of course 
that put an end to our innocent game of ‘Indian.’ 
Our parents and teachers were now more than ever 
convinced that we were ‘bad.’ 
“During the time of which I am speaking I was 
between twelve and fourteen years of age and the 
desire for activity was intense. Every pond for 
miles around was studied by us boys and the par- 
ticular qualities of each investigated, commented 
upon and compared with reference to their good 
points, and many were the whippings which I re- 
ceived for my clandestine enjoyment of them. 
“The chief cause of our ‘adventures’ was un- 
questionably, as I view it to-day, the failure of 
those over us to furnish an outlet for the desires 
created by the ponds, fields and woods. Our sports 
were generally harmless and often educative in the 
beginning, but they usually ended in trouble be- 
cause we were compelled to engage in them secretly 
on account of the disapproval of parents and teach- 
ers.” 
A teacher who grew up on a farm writes:

rTielesnerionce of This longing, which appeared 
a country-bred shortly after. ten years of age, 
Reacte was curbed only by natural timid- 
ity. Later, when one of Oliver Optic’s stories fell 
into my hands, farm and school life seemed more 
and more monotonous. This spirit of discontent 
with the slowness of life increased as I grew older. 
“Since this desire for something unusual to break 
the monotony was unappreciated by those over us, 
who, apparently, had forgot their own youth, I 
and my associates tried to find our own ways of 
relieving the depression. Sometimes these- acts 
were harmless and at other times almost criminal, 
but they were always unguided and, in fact, con- 
demned. On one occasion we nearly burned a boy 
at the stake and probably would have done so be- 
fore we were aware of the danger had not a neigh- 
bor come upon us just as we were applying the 
match toa pile of hay and dry twigs in the midst 
of which our captive was tied. 
“Drawn together by the common bond of loneli- 
ness we put into execution all of our venturesome 
plans. The worst series of acts. was incited: by.a 
book of the adventures of robbers.. We read it to- 
gether and straightway resolved to become truly 
great in that line. That winter everything went 
wrong at the school. There were many offenses, 
all directed against school property, and finally,

  when the outhouses were burned, the school di- 
rectors were in a frenzy. 
“As I look back over it all, with a wider knowl- 
edge of boys from my experience as a teacher, I am 
convinced that we could have been controlled and 
our farm and school work could have had real inter- 
est had our teachers, appreciating what was going 
on within us, furnished vigorous, healthy outlets 
for our boyish spirits and directed them by joining 
in enough of our sports to show that they were 
more interested in us personally than in school 
studies and discipline, the importance of which we 
did not, and at our age could not, understand.” 
But this desire for adventure is not limited to 
boys; the principals of a girls’ boarding school have 
Mise dokive fac Ga informed the writer that it is one 
venture among of the things which they must 
oe keep in mind. Girls, they say, are 
like boys in being depressed by unbroken routine. 
“Monotony bores children and a bored child is not 
efficient.” They add, however, that although noth- 
ing sensational is required to relieve the monotony, 
if they do not relieve it something sensational is cer- 
tain to happen. An outing in the woods, when the 
weather permits, an occasional supper at a hotel, 
and other equally simple devices meet the needs. 
“One great value of dramatic performances in 
school,” according to these teachers, “is the relief 
of the children from their own stale and limited 
habits of thought and feeling.”

of reformation writer that two of his most trou- 
blesome boys were “reformed” by a very simple 
method. One was a good musician, and it was sug-

was advised to try for the football team, which he 
succeeded in making. Both were told a little later 
that they must show themselves worthy of the re- 
sponsibility, and they did.

patients often furnish enough excitement to meet 
the needs. 
A woman who has had a varied experience with 
girls writes: “Among the grammar and high-school

woman, furnishes the explanation for the popular- 
ity of moving-picture shows, sensational novels and, 
among certain classes, the public dance-halls. “All 
of these manias come directly or indirectly from the 
instinct for action and experience. . . . There is 
a time when every girl longs for free, wild, daring 
physical action, a time when every girl wishes in 
the bitterness of her soul that she were a boy, but 
not in disloyalty to her sex. Consciously or uncon- 
sciously, it is her nature crying out for freedom 
and action. 
“The schools should include activities demanding 
action, responsibility and originality. Otherwise the

corréspondent calls “action-by-proxy.” ‘The sen- 
sational novel mania is also at bottom a desire to 
escape from the sameness of environment. If girls 
are denied opportunity to be themselves the actors 
they are bound to seek substitutes, and the more 
realistic these substitutes are the better they fill the 
vacancy. It is the law of compensation.”

could be given did space permit. They are more

  cipal who understood the function of adven- 
tures in the economy of children’s growth. It 
is no small matter to take charge of a school 
in which the large boys boast of putting the 
teacher out-of-doors and win them to one’s sup- 
port. Still more significant is it when, in addition, 
one reorganizes the community, changes the 
thoughts and feelings of the children and trans- 
forms disorder into interest in study and in the 
school. This kind of a school has been placed by 
the side of another in which the same sort of “ad- 
ventures” led to trouble because they were done se- 
cretly to escape the disapproval of parents and 
teachers who had forgot the thoughts and impulses 
of their own childhood. In the one school the na- 
tive instinct for excitement, for contest of muscle 
and brain in “the shock of arms” and in the “di- 
plomacy of life,” in short, for adventure, was util- 
ized for mental and moral growth; and in the other, 
the same impulses were left to function in the old 
anti-social way, to set up resistances to discipline 
and study which the teacher must overcome and, 
perhaps in the end, to lead to the reform school and 
prison. And here let us say in passing that there is 
no separate criminal class. As William Pinkerton 
has said, “Criminals are just like other folks.”* 
Since Mr. Pinkerton has spent more than fifty 
years in constant association with crime and crim- 
inals, he can not be accused of visionary ideas.

execute their own plans in competition with one 
another. 
Besides athletics and games of various sorts, cer- 
tain studies of the school easily lend themselves to 
x this active treatment. Geogra- 
ee phy, nature study, zoology and 
oisnatiral sci- botany are instances in point. 
These subjects have been made 
too bookish. Geography still consists largely in 
locating, bounding, describing and defining, always 
from the book, instead of using the streams and 
swamps and other outdoor sources of geographical 
knowledge which often lie at the school-yard gate. 
The report of the committee in charge of the 
survey of School District No. 1, City of Portland 
Memorizing ver- (Oregon), says, with reference to 
sus thinking geography in the schools under 
investigation: ‘No connection was made or sug- 
gested between the book statements and the pupils’ 
own immediate observations of geographic phe- 
nomena ; not the slightest stimulus was given to ob- 
serve, to think about, and to interpret the geographic 
phenomena in which Portland and vicinity surpass- 
ingly abound; even an exercise in ‘home’ geography 
was conducted entirely from the book... .” In 
Vermont much the same condition was noted by 
the investigators for the Carnegie Foundation: 
“History and geography are not made to appeal 
to the children by connecting these subjects with 
their experiences, The lessons that were observed

  in these subjects were confined largely to a repeti- 
tion of the contents of some text-book, and there 
was seldom any effort to relate the statements of 
the book with what the child might be expected 
to know about his own environment.” Unfortu- 
nately, this method is too common. The most 
recent of the many instances of which the writer 
has learned was reported to him as this book was 
going through the press. The sister of a boy in 
the fifth grade of a Missouri school was helping 
him in geography. The child defined erosion cor- 
rectly. Since there were excellent examples visible 
from the house, as it was raining hard, his sister 
asked him to point out an illustration. The boy 
looked blankly through the window for a few min- 
utes and then said, “I can’t do that, but I can tell 
you of one in Colorado.” 
For zoology and kindred subjects nature has been 
catalogued and dried, and the schoolmaster vainly 
strives to squeeze some interest from the desic- 
cated remains, though Huxley, long ago, showed 
how green scum from the nearest gutter, a handful 
of weeds from a pond, a frog and a pigeon, instead 
of books, may be made the final authority. Mean- 
while, also, the birds that have not yet reached the 
museum stage of ghostly unreality are calling the 
children to their woodland homes to study their 
lives and habits. It can not be said that material 
is lacking for this out-of-door work since, in ad- 
dition to the animals themselves, state agricultural

state conditions clearly, with emphasis on the es-

ditions, underlie thinking; and this power is not 
gained by sitting in one’s seat and reading what 
others have said about these things. Books in the 
schoolroom should be used to verify answers which 
have been obtained by observation and investigation, 
and if differences of opinion among authorities are 
found the enthusiasm of the children for personal 
investigation is greatly enhanced. Studying what 
writers say, with laboratory work to establish its 
correctness, is the imitative method. It does not 
train in thinking; and failure to learn to think is 
failure in education. An illustration of the disas- 
trous effect of imitation through slavishness to 
books has just been reported to the writer by a high- 
school teacher. The children in his first year Ger- 
man class can accurately define each tense, but they 
can neither give examples nor recognize any tense

ing to answer this fully at the present time, because 
Prerequisites to it will be discussed later, the pre- 
thinking requisite of thinking is ability to 
see a problem—to state it clearly. With this, of 
course, if results are to be obtained, there must be 
a continuously aggressive desire to grapple with the 
solution of such problems as arise in the course of 
one’s work. Both of these mental characteristics 
are largely matters of habit. Every one is capable 
of much clearer thinking than he actually dees. 
Therefore, to the extent to which the brain of indi- 
vidual children permits progress, the teacher’s prob- 
lem is to train them in habits of thought, and in 
doing this, as in the case of all habits that are in 
opposition to racial indolence, the emotional atti- 
tude of the pupils is of incalculable importance. For 
this reason desirable habits should grow out of those 
instincts which clamor for action, since they have 
the firmest hold on youth.

reached in the natural course of their efforts to ac- 
complish what they have set before themselves and 
which they have undertaken because it appealed to 
their instinct of mental or manual workmanship. 
Interest is the emotional condition that arises in an 
individual through gratification of nascent tenden- 
cies. In adults these tendencies may be of the de- 
rived sort—the outgrowth of reading or of business 
or professional needs—but in children they are of 
racial origin.

are never inert, physically or mentally. They are 
in a constant state of suppressed or expressed action, 
and when these spontaneous impulses are repressed 
explosions are imminent. No absolute value can be 
ascribed to method and means of education. Their 
worth is relative to the thoughts and feelings of the 
pupils. Interest is exasperatingly fastidious; it se- 
lects that which makes an appeal to the thoughts 
and feeling from which it springs. The hopeful 
thing about children is that they always want to do 
something, and the successful teacher ascertains 
what they want and helps them to do it in an educa- 
tive way. This is not yielding to their whims. It 
is building on the content of their minds, a method

those reported as playing were engaged in fighting, 
teasing, shooting craps, pitching pennies, or in some 
other more or less demoralizing sport. “The need

activity,” is the way in which the report of the 
New York People’s Institute diagnoses the condi- 
tion; “outlet for the adventurous interests of boys 
—other than a destructive outlet.’ “Mischief,” 
says the Milwaukee report, “which is technically 
called in the courts ‘juvenile delinquency,’ and lack 
of initiative, which is called in the schools ‘dull 
stupidity,’ are the sure results of doing nothing.” 
And, again, according to the Providence report, 
“Doing nothing almost inevitably leads to the wrong 
kind of outlet for the spirit of youth.” In speak- 
ing of crimes incidental to the games of the 
New York City children, the report of the People’s 
Institute says: “The elements the boys are striving 
for are the dramatic adventures in obtaining stolen 
goods, the excitement of gambling, which to them 
is no crime, and the physical joys of soda-water, 
cigarettes, moving-picture shows, etc., which follow 
the game. These boys start out to seek adventure, 
excitement and a ‘treat.’ ” 
When we ask how instincts may be utilized for 
education the method is plainly indicated by their 
A guide to utiliz. ceaseless employment in manip- 
ing instincts ulating the little world in which 
the children live. Knowledge of instinctive tenden- 
cies will enable a teacher to suggest situations of 
action in the course of which educative problems 
arise. After all, what is desired in teaching is that 
the pupils study and think and acquire habits of 
industry. The method that best accomplishes this 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
    30 LEARNING AND DOING 
is the one to follow. If children work vigorously 
when organized to carry out plans that appeal to 
their native instincts the result in acquisition of 
knowledge and in training is not less valuable be- 
cause the children study willingly and find pleasure 
in what they are doing. It is obvious that adven- 
tures in the real sense of the word may sometimes 
be freighted with educational problems, but all ac- 
tivities which the pupils manage, share in the spirit 
of adventure and to that extent break the monotony 
of routine work and satisfy their need for action. 
In an investigation of the truant schools of Bos- 
ton the writer found boys who had run away from 
esac ae other schools waiting at the door 
cessful truant a full half-hour before the teacher 
aauop le) came. When asked the reason, 
the teacher smiled and said she thought it was be- 
cause they were allowed to think and act instead 
of imitating the thoughts and actions of those who 
believed they knew a better way. The same ques- 
tion has recently been put by Philip Davis, director 
of the Boston Civic Service House, and he finds 
the answer to be that the ideal truant school “pays 
closer attention to the interests, activities, feelings 
and emotions of the child—because, in short, it has 
organized a school-life, the keynote of which is ac- 
tion rather than studies.”* This does not mean 
that studies are to be neglected. They are not neg- 
lected in the Boston Truant Schools. The differ-

-P-A-G-E-49
  THE REVOLT FROM MONOTONY 31 
ence lies in the way in which they are studied, 
whether in a manner that gives the children free- 
dom to think, originate, investigate and act, or in 
the imitative way of “learning lessons.” 
We have found that this same spontaneity on the 
part of children is aroused by heeding racial calls 
Transference of Of various sorts. At bottom, 
enthusiasm though, these instincts are the 
same—the tendency to contrive with mind or hand 
and then to do what one has thought. If it is the 
instincts usually associated with primitive man that 
receive attention, as in sports and handicrafts, the 
enthusiasm awakened may be transferred to other 
work, to the studies of the school, because the chil- 
dren then have fellowship with the teacher. He has 
met their needs and they respond. 
It is not in quantity of knowledge that children 
chiefly differ from adults. The stuff from which their 
iiterenc trata thoughts and feelings are made is 
content of chil- different. Widely varying expe- 
dren and adults rience cuts away the common 
ground of understanding. Men of different nation- 
alities can not get one another’s points of view. It 
is no wonder, then, that children, having had none 
of the experiences of adults, regard them as a pe- 
culiar people with strange ideas who are always 
urging conduct and habits and studies in which the 
youngsters see no value. “To them (the children) 
the inhabited world is composed of the two main 
divisions: children and upgrown people; the latter 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
    32 LEARNING AND DOING 
in no way superior to the former—only hopelessly 
different.””* 
Why should children be expected to understand 
the importance of knowledge when the need for it 
has not yet arisen? One of the problems of the 
teacher is to produce situations in which this need 
will be a recurring factor, and the conditions that 
meet this educationalrequirement are those in which 
the children are the planners and the workers. In 
short, they are situations of action. 
Before this cooperative planning can be effective, 
however, it is necessary to bridge the chasm that 
Instincts as start. S¢Patates the thoughts and feel- 
ing-point for ings of children from those of 
pacereet the teacher. When one looks over 
the field for teachers in schools and social organiza- 
tions who have won the interest of their children, 
one invariably finds that the method used took ac- 
count of racial instincts. The “adventures,” as we 
have called these activities for want of a better 
name, have supplied a motive for situations out of 
which a consciously felt need for knowledge grew. 
The children took an interest in the problems be- 
cause they arose in the progress of what they were 
trying to do; and they wanted to do the things be- 
cause they gave opportunity for action, for plan- 
ning and for managing. There is no artifice about 
this. It is simply starting from the racial heritage 
which children have in common.

prevents the feelings and emo- Importance of ac- ~, es

pressed in action. They are certain to find some 
exit, and when free action is suppressed they are 
likely to find their satisfaction in secret ways that 
develop unhealthy motives for thought and will. 
When once this frank agreement on mutual inter- 
ests has been reached, the skilful teacher may lead 
Unlimited oppor- his pupils where he wishes. The 
tunity for teachers oulf between mature and imma- 
ture thoughts and feelings has been spanned, and 
now the interests of the pupils can be broadened. 
Perhaps it was knowledge of this fact that led Pad- 
dy Byrne to regale Oliver Goldsmith with stories 
of adventures, smugglers, robbers and pirates as a 
preliminary to something else. At any rate he suc- 
ceeded after Dame Delap had called Oliver the dull-

ness man, “but the spirit to do things was so sup- 
pressed that it had to satisfy itself with visionary 
dreams rather than in those natural activities to 
which it should have been directed. My parents 
fitted up a fine workshop, which I never used ex- 
cept under protest, and bought squirrels, dogs and, 
finally, a saddle pony. These gave me pleasure, but 
they did not make up for the experiences which 
every boy craves and should have. My teachers 
were entirely unconscious of my boyish thoughts 
and enthusiasm. They gave me no encouragement 
to engage in even school athletics. Any summary 
of my boyhood experiences can only be a confes- 
sion of a life of continued monotony, and I believe 
that in consequence of this lack of adventures my 
initiative, resourcefulness, self-reliance and the abil- 
ity to be a good ‘mixer’ and judge of men have been 
permanently impaired.” Compare this last state- 
ment with that of another business man who writes: 
“Some of the things which I did in the spirit of 
adventure are of more advantage to me to-day in 
business than anything I learned in school.” 
Education is more than schooling. It calls for 
the development of all the latent powers of child- 
hood, and the primitive instincts 
are among the resources at the 
disposal of the teacher. By utilizing them they be- 
come allies for promoting growth, instead of ob- 
stacles to be overcome, and the enthusiasm created 
by their recognition as springs of action in the young Conclusion

gives a zest to work that makes it pleasant, though 
not easy. We shall endeavor to indicate some of 
the ways in which teachers have combined the spirit 
of adventure with the work of the school, but first 
it is important to consider certain characteristics of 
efficient teaching.

  CHAPTER II 
EFFICIENT TEACHING 
E have been told that the education of a 
child should begin with his grandparents. 
Yes, that is true, only it is with the grandparents of 
Difficulty of de- the future children that we must 
fining human start—with the children who are 
euiciency in school now. The difficulty in 
falling back on heredity is not our ignorance of its 
laws. Investigations are daily making those clearer. 
The trouble is in deciding what makes an efficient 
man or woman. Of course certain things are clear 
enough. We know, for example, that honesty, in- 
dustry and perseverance are essential, but many 
men possess all these and yet lack efficiency. Hu- 
man efficiency is too complex to be defined in such 
limited terms. 
Educating men is an altogether different propo- 
sition from training animals. In the case of dogs, 
Peas nh. for instance, we know exactly 
tween human and what we want. If it is a certain 
animal educability }inq of hunting dog which we are 
after, we obtain an animal whose ancestors through 
many generations have been accustomed to do what 
36
-P-A-G-E-55
  
  EFFICIENT TEACHING 87 
we want done and train him vigorously in the acts 
required for success. Police dogs are another illus- 
tration. Their new work differs only moderately 
from the things in which their ancestors were pro- 
ficient. But if this principle had been followed 
would Robert Browning have been selected in ad- 
vance for the work in which he so splendidly ex- 
celled? Browning is not an isolated case. Read 
the lives of the ancestors of men and women who 
have achieved fame, and see how many of these 
eminent persons you would have selected in their 
childhood for success in their later work. Some of 
these ancestors will not stand investigation. Then, 
too, the children of eminent men and women are 
often disappointingly inefficient. 
It is not the purpose of this chapter to oppose the 
principle of eugenics. Mutations, however, are 
First essential of probably no less common in hu- 
efficient teaching man beings than among the lower 
animals, and “‘sports,” which are only isolated cases 
of mutations, are sufficiently numerous among geni- 
uses to attract attention. Perhaps the frequency of 
sports is the cause of much which has been writ- 
ten about genius and insanity. We know now, as 
the result of Burbank’s work, that the first condi- 
tion of variability is the breaking up of specific hab- 
its. When this state of instability has been attained 
new variations may be expected and then if condi- 
tions are favorable for a definite kind of variation 
that particular change is likely to occur. Encourag-
-P-A-G-E-56
  38 LEARNING AND DOING 
ing variations and recognizing them when they occur 
is, in the opinion of the writer, the first essential of 
efficient teaching. Let us inquire a little more def- 
initely into the meaning of this. 
It is, of course, admitted that we must take chil- 
dren as they are. Complaint that they were not 
Two methods of born right avails nothing. They 
approach to task are the raw material which must 
be worked up by the schools. Now there are at 
least two widely different ways of approaching our 
task. We may decide just what sort of men and 
women we would like to make out of them and then 
regulate their “going and coming” by assignments 
of work, by rules and prohibitions with a view to 
developing our ideal type of adults. Or, again, in- 
stead of settling at the start the kind of men and 
women we will make our pupils into, we may sup- 
ply incentives for the development of various sorts 
of ability. To illustrate our point somewhat rough- 
ly, if we were to rear a strange animal with whose 
habits of eating we were unacquainted, we should 
scatter various kinds of food before it to learn 
which it would select. This, indeed, is exactly our 
method when we read aloud to children from differ- 
ent books, taking care to stop each time at some 
interesting place to see which book is sufficiently 
absorbing for them to wish to continue it by them- 
selves. 
I am aware that one rarely adopts the first meth- 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  EFFICIENT TEACHING 39 
od as consciously as did Austin Feverel for his son 
Mavlte of firet Richard. Our ideals are usually 
method acquired unconsciously and our 
actions are made to fit them with quite as little de- 
liberate intention. The instruction which we have 
received in preparation for our work, the ideas of 
discipline acquired, the pressure of the community, 
or, still more often, perhaps, the line of least resist- 
ance, draw us unconsciously to the adoption of the 
first method as a plan of action. But, besides the 
fact that there are many ways of being efficient, this 
method ignores the individual traits of children, and 
it does not draw out their abilities because it makes 
no appeal to their inherited and acquired character- 
istics. 
Children must, of course, be held to certain re- 
quirements. They should be punctual, studious and 
A paradox and orderly. There are, however, 
an explanation many ways in which these quali- 
ties may be taught. To command that they be ob- 
served, with punishment for failure, is the sim- 
plest—and the most primitive—plan of action. 
Whether its results be good or bad depends upon 
the natures of the children to whom it is applied. 
The best that can be said for this method is that it 
is successful for those who are suited to it. As far 
as this statement has any meaning at all, it repeats 
what has already been said: i. e., that the efficient 
method is the one adapted to the individual traits 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  
  40 LEARNING AND DOING 
of children. I admit that this view throws aside 
all rules of action in the schoolroom, and leaves the 
solution of the problem to the teacher’s interpreta- 
tion of the individual peculiarities of his different 
pupils. But this is as it should be. The only rule 
that can be given is to follow no rule. To be even 
more paradoxical, probably the safest way to attain 
this state of freedom is through rules. This is true 
at least for those who are versatile enough to pre- 
vent a method from becoming habitual, for it is a 
great advantage to have experienced the failure of 
the rule-of-thumb plan of “teaching school.” One 
is then prepared to appreciate the difference be- 
tween the output of mechanically directed study and 
spontaneous diligence. It is the same with the 
method of the recitation. The first thing to do is 
to get a method and the second is to discard it. A 
teacher, for example, is unfortunate not to have 
been caught by some of the many systems of teach- 
ing arithmetic, but it would be fatal to his own 
progress and that of his pupils to be held by them. 
Rules are intended for the preliminary stage 
when one is learning to judge situations. As a 
An illustration of matter of fact, no two situations 
good judgment are exactly alike and intelligence 
is displayed in distinguishing essential differences 
from the non-essential and in modifying one’s acts 
accordingly. An illustration from an actual school 
occurrence will make this clear. A teacher in a
-P-A-G-E-59
  EFFICIENT TEACHING 41 
country school was accustomed to keep her red 
sweater in the cloak-room of the building for use 
on cold days. One morning on arriving at the 
building she found that it had been hung from the 
middle of the ceiling of the schoolroom. In addi- 
tion to this ornamentation the top of the clock was 
decorated with a pair of shoes kept at the school 
by one of the girls who was obliged to travel a 
wet, muddy road. The teacher paid no attention 
to either and everything went on as usual. At 
recess the janitor asked her in the presence of sev- 
eral boys if he should take them down. “Oh, no,” 
was the reply, “the children like to have them there 
and they do no harm.” 
A classical example of this same adaptation to 
the situation is found in an anecdote of Frederick 
An example of the Great. After his exhaustive 
wise adaptability wars he felt obliged to introduce 
a severe and unpopular system of collecting taxes. 
His tax-gatherers searched private houses so dili- 
gently that the people called them cellar-rats. One 
day, while riding through Berlin, Frederick came 
upon a crowd of people looking at a picture high 
up on a wall. As he came near, he saw that it 
was a caricature of himself, as a miser, grinding 
coffee. “Hang it lower,” he cried to his groom, “so 
that the people need not break their necks looking 
at it.” Immediately a cheer burst from the crowd 
and the picture was torn into a thousand pieces.

42 LEARNING AND DOING 
  The illustrations which we have given show how 
the response may be made to fit a situation and 
a the desired result be thereby at- 
oman ce tained. The principle, however, 
we adapta- applies also to the varying ways 
in which different pupils should 
be dealt with to obtain the best of which they are 
capable. This may be shown by an instance re- 
ported to the writer—the not infrequent case of a 
solitary boy in the senior class of a high school. 
He became discouraged because the girls made bet- 
ter grades than he. By observing him, and through 
conversation, his teacher found that he had no con- 
fidence in his ability. Finally, he decided to with- 
draw from school, and then his teacher, having in- 
duced him to stay a little longer, decided to try a dif- 
ferent method with him from the one she thought 
advantageous to the other members of the class. She 
had discovered that he was fond of writing poetry, 
so she asked the entire class to write sonnets for 
the following day. As she had expected, Frank’s 
poem was much better than any of the others and 
he became quite a hero in the class. This increased 
his self-respect so much that he began to study with 
renewed vigor. He had found that he could do 
at least one thing better than his classmates. In 
a few days the other members of the class returned 
to the work which seemed more profitable for them 
and Frank became the poet. He studied the various 
kinds of verse and read about authors until finally,
-P-A-G-E-61
EFFICIENT TEACHING 43 
as usually happens under skilful guidance, his in- 
terest spread to prose literature as well and, as 
his teacher puts it in her letter, “he became a live 
wire in the literature class.” 
Another instance, illustrating the same principle 
in a different way, was shown in the treatment of 
Another illustra- 2 boy in the first year class of 
tion from a school q high school. He saw “no 
good” in any of his studies. He was going to be 
a farmer, he said, and what was the good of all 
“those things’? His teacher discovered one sub- 
ject which he did not exactly “hate” and that was 
the composition part of English grammar, and he 
also wrote fairly well. So she suggested that he 
be appointed “reporter” for the school. It was his 
duty to go around to the different rooms each week 
and gather items which he arranged and edited 
for the town paper. This constituted a part of 
his class work. He soon found that a knowledge 
of the technical parts of grammar was of advantage 
in his writing and so his narrow interest widened. 
Before long he saw that information about other 
things than grammar was needed for an “editor.” 
Interesting experiments in the laboratories, facts 
about earlier investigators and their work, and 
many other bits of knowledge came to his attention 
and aroused his curiosity beyond their use for the 
items in the village paper. As a result his interest 
spread to all the studies of the school, because, at 
last, he saw their use. To return, now, for a  
-P-A-G-E-62
  
44 LEARNING AND DOING 
moment to the paradoxical statement above that the 
best rule for the teacher to follow is to have no 
rule, the writer ventures to ask what rule could 
have been given for guidance in these instances 
beyond saying that the individual peculiarities of 
each child should determine the plan to follow? 
This, of course, makes every pupil a special “case” 
requiring a different rule of action. 
It would be a mistake, however, to assume that 
this view reduces education to the vagaries of law- 
Flexibility of less | caprice. The practice of 
method is not medicine did not become a science 
ed until physicians saw that the same 
outward manifestation might be caused by widely 
different organic or functional disorders. As long 
as fever, for example, was regarded as a specific 
disease requiring one definite sort of treatment, little 
progress in medicine could be made. To-day, when 
different prescriptions are given for “fever,” we 
do not say that the practice of medicine is governed 
by no law. The recognition of various causes for 
this symptom of internal disorders marked the be- 
ginning of law in the treatment of diseases; and 
it is the same in education. If the teacher is not 
always treating a mind diseased he is, at any rate, 
dealing with minds affected by bodily and mental 
conditions which cause the “peculiarities” that make 
the trouble. Constant suspicion of kindly acts, for 
example, may be caused by the treatment received
-P-A-G-E-63
EFFICIENT TEACHING 45 
at home or by a misunderstanding of the teacher’s 
motives, and persistent annoyance by a pupil may 
be due to either of these or many other causes. 
Indolence, again, is often traced to bodily condi- 
tion, such as eye-strain, but quite as frequently to 
interests of which the school takes no account. 
These are a few of the many examples which might 
be given to illustrate what is meant. It is obvious 
that always to apply the same treatment to “indo- 
lence” would be a professional blunder quite com- 
parable with the “criminal carelessness” which 
sometimes brings physicians before a court of jus- 
tice. 
We have been trying to show the need of dis- 
covering the causes of failure to respond to oppor- 
wor guiding (pein: tunities for learning and for do- 
ciples in efficient ing, as well as to urge the right 
peace of every child to have his type 
of mind considered in his teaching. It was the 
latter that prompted Voltaire to exclaim, with his 
characteristic vividness, “Everybody must jump 
after his own fashion.” These guiding principles 
—to find the cause of failure and to deal with 
individual personalities, instead of with the abstract 
child—are the beginning of efficient teaching. As 
for the rest, the method followed should be directed 
toward fixing habits of behavior and of clear think- 
ing; and here we come upon a significant educa- 
tional fact.   
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  46 LEARNING AND DOING 
Children are the most adaptive creatures in the 
world. They are more clever at adaptation than 
any of the lower animals because Connection be- 5 ; tween adaptation they have more intelligence. If 
ene een Orny a teacher varies his requirements 
for the same children in different 
classes, being lax in one and adhering rigorously 
to his demands in the other, the children will adapt 
themselves quite contentedly to the contradictory 
situations. It is a common experience, for example, 
to have the same pupils careful of their spelling 
in papers for the spelling class and neat as well 
as thoughtful of the English in their compositions 
but careless of all three in arithmetic and geogra- 
phy. Adaptation is fitting into requirements, and 
the “fitting” is usually done with the most econom- 
ical expenditure of energy. Economy of effort re- 
quires intelligence and that is the reason why chil- 
dren are so proficient in it. One of the advantages 
that goes with being man instead of dog is ability 
to economize effort; and we can not blame children 
for enjoying one of the prerogatives of their genus. 
Pupils do not usually make these adaptations 
consciously. It is the line of least resistance that 
is followed. For, as Rousseau 
Conne elon ibe long ago remarked, not even chil- 
adaptation and dren wish to take unnecessary bad habits 3 ° trouble. On this account, if more 
effort is needed to evade tasks than to do them
-P-A-G-E-65
  EFFICIENT TEACHING 47 
the work will be done. And so penalties are im- 
posed in the effort to increase the difficulties of 
escaping work. Unfortunately, however, by the 
time the teacher has decided to inflict the penalty 
the children have already made their adaptation 
to a lower degree of efficiency. Asa result of this 
delay the situation is greatly complicated. It is 
now not merely a question of promoting adaptation 
but of breaking up bad habits and forcing readapta- 
tions to a new requirement. And that is much 
harder to accomplish. 
The cause of much of the difficulty in securing 
good habits of work in school is that the require- 
meacher?ay roenoris ments are irregularly and inter- 
sibility in forma- mittently enforced. To-day they 
ponrot Habits are kindly but severely insisted on 
and to-morrow the demand is relaxed. So the chil- 
dren are kept in uncertainty about what is ex- 
pected. They do not know to what they should 
adapt themselves, and desiring, as we have said, 
to go to no unnecessary trouble, they do not adapt 
themselves to any definite requirement. In other 
words, they drift into indolence. The statement 
that children do not wish to go to unnecessary 
trouble seems to imply deliberate action. This fru- 
gality of effort, however, is largely physiological. 
It is economy in organic action. Nature is rarely 
extravagant in her expenditure of energy. 
Sentimentality, again, has replaced the stern dis-
-P-A-G-E-66
  48 LEARNING AND DOING 
cipline of former days and in the attempt to make 
Danger from work pleasant it is often made 
sentimentality too easy, though the two terms 
are by no means synonymous. Consequently, the 
children adapt themselves to a comfortable, effort- 
less mode of study which brings, at best, only a 
confused conglomeration of facts. But suddenly 
the teacher awakens to the fact that his pupils are 
merely committing their lessons to memory and 
doing even that indifferently. Therefore, being a 
conscientious teacher, he tries to enforce a little 
real thinking. But now the tables are turned. For 
the difficulties in the way of reversing the children’s 
habits of work are almost insurmountable and, after 
days of fruitless effort, the teacher yields to the 
inevitable and adapts himself to their requirements 
instead of making them meet his, 
The trouble lies in not starting right. Adapta- 
tion is an unvarying law of nature. It is certain 
The importance to occur. The question then is 
of beginnings to what conditions shall the 
adaptation be made? If teachers begin their year’s 
work with certain requirements, kindly but firmly 
enforced, the pupils will adapt themselves to the 
demands; but there must be no relaxation in the 
requirements until the adaptation becomes a habit. 
For this reason it is of the greatest importance 
that the program of action be carefully thought 
out. Only requirements essential to success in the 
daily work should be made. The children are in 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  EFFICIENT TEACHING 49 
school to study and to think, and certain conditions 
are necessary. Rules not vital to the work in hand 
are sometimes given. They were made in a mo- 
ment of irritation at interruption and were never 
intended for serious enforcement. An illustration 
will make this clear. A teacher is busy with a class 
and one of the children at study crosses the room 
to get a ruler. The teacher is disturbed and says 
at once that no one may leave his seat without per- 
mission. He does not mean it, or would not did 
he but think, for he does not wish pupils to sit 
idle for want of a ruler or a pencil which might 
be obtained easily and quickly, nor does he desire 
many requests for permission to do what might 
be done with less disturbance by saying nothing. 
Therefore he does not enforce the rule. 
The fewer rules laid down the better, but those

greater because they are more conscious of their

A test of habits use their knowledge to verify or 
of thinking deny new statements if they have 
been trained to do so from the beginning. Other- 
wise they will not, because selective thinking re- 
quires effort which they will not needlessly expend. 
Accepting each statement, even those contradictory 
to facts already learned or meaningless, is much 
easier. The principal of a large public school told 
the writer that he became convinced that the chil- 
dren were not paying attention to what the teacher 
said, or taking interest enough in it to understand 
the instruction. So he planned a test, first warning 
the teachers lest their faces betray him. He went 
into each room of the eight grades, except the first, 
and gave a short talk ending with: “Now I want 
each one of you to promise to sagitate your consti- 
tution every week.” 
As he expected, not a hand was raised for per- 
mission to ask a question, until he reached the sev- 
enth grade, when one boy’s hand flew up. The prin- 
cipal thought that he was caught this time, but when 
he gave permission to speak, the boy, with the air 
of consciousness that he always did the right thing, 
said: “I did mine yesterday.” When the writer 
repeated this to a class of teachers not long ago, 
one of the members doubted whether his pupils 
could be deceived so easily. They were taught to 
think, he said. He consented, however, to make 
the test, and the following week admitted with some 
chagrin that “it worked.”

Children can be trained to think provided the 
conditions to which adaptation is enforced require 
More about train- thinking. Miss Earhart* put sev- 
ing in thinking — eral classes under special training 
to test this possibility and found, as a result of 
the experiment, that “pupils in the elementary 
schools in grades including the fourth, as well 
as higher classes, are able not only to employ the 
factors of logical study but also that by means of 
systematic effort they can be made to improve in 
their employment of them.” These tests showed 
quite conclusively that children can gather data 
from outside sources and use the material intelli- 
gently. They can also “be trained to see the impor- 
tant points in a lesson and to group the related ideas 
about these centers.” 
Miss Earhart then proceeded to find out whether 
children are taught to think in school. She tested 
‘Abtest which more than a thousand pupils in 
shows children are the sixth and seventh grades, and 
Motraue otto think hie questions which she used dealt 
with geography. These tests failed to “reveal any 
power the children in these classes may possess of 
seeing discrepancies between what they read and 
what they know.” ‘They did not show any power 
in the children to doubt on the basis of known facts. 
The children were usually unable to discover what 
the lesson was about; but her experiment proved 
that they are capable of thinking and that they will

do so if daily they are held to the requirement. 
“Tf enough pupils use the various factors of proper 
study to show that it is possible for children of their 
age to employ them, the questions arise,” continues 
Miss Earhart, “why do not more of the pupils use 
them? Why are they not in common use?” 
To answer these questions she visited some seventy 
classes in various parts of the United States and 
sent a questionnaire to one hundred and sixty-five 
teachers to learn their ideas regarding study and 
to ascertain what they try to have their pupils do 
when they teach them to study. Another question- 
naire was sent to principals of schools to be filled 
out after certain recitations had been observed. 
“Careful examination of the results of the observa- 
tions and of both questionnaires compelled the con- 
clusion that, although pupils possess ability to 
employ the various factors of proper study, the 
teachers lack a clear conception of what such study 
is.’ They “tend to exact memorizing.” 
That children study words rather than thoughts 
was the conclusion of an investigation made by 
An investigation Miss Martha Baldwin.* They 
and its conclusions study in a mechanical way which 
enables them to say that they have studied the 
lesson the required length of time. ‘They read the 
words over and over, and doubtless got more con- 
fused the more they read.” The investigation shows 
loss of time, the acquisition of bad habits of study

by mind-wandering, memorizing of words without 
understanding the thought, and lack of concentra- 
tion. 
Reavis,* in his study of pupils in the grades, 
found that children do not know how to acquire 
Another efficient habits of work. They do 
investigation not know what habits are efficient. 
Well intentioned children often go blundering along, 
adopting finally, perhaps, a lazy, loose habit of 
work, or they acquire no habit except that of mind- 
wandering, catching an idea now and then during 
the lucid intervals between the flight of pleasanter 
ideas. Pupils’ habits of study, Reavis says, may 
be analyzed, the individual weaknesses discovered, 
and the teacher will then know when and how con- 
sciously to plan to strengthen or inhibit certain 
habits. But this, of course, implies that the teacher 
first learn how to study. 
This problem of producing a body of pupil work- 
ers is, of course, fundamental to good teaching. 
A gage of The reason for the emphasis on 
good teaching recognition of individual traits 
of children, in the early part of this chapter, was 
that such recognition tends to promote study. It 
matters not how well a subject may be presented, 
the result will be unimportant unless the pupils 
react, and the measure of their reaction is the 
strength of their desire to find out something more

about the matter for themselves. If this desire 
is so irresistible that it drives them to reference 
books for further information, the recitation has 
been a success. Moreover, they should be able to 
distinguish between confused and clear knowledge, 
and they do not make this distinction when they 
are satisfied with merely “learning” the lesson. Un- 
less their study starts questions that will not remain 
unanswered the success of the work with them 
may be doubted.

planations and if the demand for answers to their 
torrent of queries ends at the entrance to the 
schoolroom the teacher may well examine himself 
and his method for the cause. And yet a super- 
intendent, who has evidently given a good deal of 
attention to the conditions prevailing in the schools, 
says that “every term a great number of pupils are 
passed from the grammar schools into the high 
schools, and many of them are absolutely ignorant 
as to what it means to grapple with an intellectual 
problem. Unless some high-school teacher is wise 
and sympathetic enough to help them find out how 
to study, they flounder around helplessly for a 
few months, or at most a year or two, finally to 
drop out, disgusted with school, books, teacher and

education, because they never really learned how 
to work.”* As an illustration of how weak a 
hold questions and problems often have on children, 
this superintendent goes on to say that on one 
occasion he observed that a large proportion of the 
ptipils in his school studied three or four lessons 
during one hour. “These pupils thought they had 
prepared their lessons for the entire day in one 
study period. The rest of their time that was not 
spent in recitation was wasted in looking around, 
talking, writing notes and in other kinds of idle- 
ness... . A few tests brought out the fact that 
many of our pupils did not know how to study. 
They worked well while tasks were easy, but when 
difficulties were encountered in the work on which 
they were engaged it was dropped at once and a 
new task was sought.” Surely no one will maintain 
that this pen sketch of a schoolroom exaggerates the 
conditions.

the extent to which high-school children understand

the assigned work immediately. The experiment 
showed at once that the pupils did not appreciate 
the value of limited time, for all were slow in begin- 
ning. It took some of them the whole fifteen min- 
utes to go through the technique of getting started. 
Several evidently were not in the habit of working 
alone, for they looked about helplessly and simply 
imitated the others. However, these same pupils 
had come to the class room daily with their lessons 
well prepared. Very little was accomplished in the 
fifteen minutes, indicating that the pupils very prob- 
ably wasted much time in studying their assign- 
ments of home work. Although the class had been 
in the high school only a short time, the teacher had 
been presupposing a habit of study which did not 
exist.” The pupils who were helpless in their work 
and simply imitated the others, yet daily came with 
lessons apparently well prepared, probably. received 
injudicious help at home. 
The results of home work were investigated by 
the writer from whom we have been quoting. Two 
Repulislof an ane classes, one a little weaker than 
vestigation of the other but taking the same 
pone ore work, were selected for the ex- 
periment. The weaker class, without home work 
assignment, studied under supervision in the school 
and the stronger class was given home work accord- 
ing to the usual custom of the school. The subse- 
quent tests showed that the weaker class under su- 
pervised study excelled the stronger class without

supervised study but with daily home work. Sev- 
eral of the lowest in the weaker division brought 
their standing up to a creditable grade. “Both 
classes accomplished the same work within the reg- 
ulation time although the weaker section did no 
home work and the stronger spent (or was sup- 
posed to spend) an hour and fifteen minutes daily 
on the assigned lesson.” 
Under the usual system of instruction the teacher 
is likely to use most of the time in testing the pupils’ 
Meed of more knowledge and in imparting new 
pupil initiative knowledge. The pupils follow his 
questions and explanations and, having good mem- 
ories, they are able to give back in a more or less 
disjointed, if not distorted, form much of what they 
hear and learn; but all observations of the ways in 
which children study seem to indicate that there is 
little personal reaction. They do not learn by do- 
ing. Frank McMurry found that they have little, 
if any, initiative. “It was their custom (in the 
classes under observation) to wait for assistance 
and direction—even to sit down—and it was a cus- 
tom so well established that five weeks of daily 
work with them in history and geography, with the 
avowed object of breaking it up, only barely began

of initiative is natural?”’* Adaptation to the school

to the report on the East Orange (New Jersey)

tigators of the Carnegie Foundation noticed that 
the responses were “slow and furtive’; answers 
had to be “pumped or suggested.” There was no 
spontaneous reaction to the content of the lesson; 
and, again, in Ohio, the State School Survey Com- 
mission says that “insufficient attention is paid in 
all types of schools to developing the pupil’s power 
of initiative, the capacity for team work, and of 
habits of study and cooperation.’”’ In summarizing, 
the report adds that “the most common fault of 
teaching observed in thirteen hundred eighty-five 
complete exercises were, teaching from the book 
exclusively, leading questions, and unnecessary tell- 
ing” by the teacher, all of which, of course, pre- 
vents the growth of initiative because the method 
offers no stimulation to original effort.

investigations indicates that pupils do not know how

day of school when the teacher is new and, for that 
reason, an object of some anxiety. With the appear- 
ance of “the new teacher” the children are in a state 
of what may be called expectant equilibrium. They 
anticipate changes and are more or less prepared to 
adapt themselves to them. Their habits are in solu- 
tion, as it were, ready to crystallize into new forms. 
This is the time when a vigorous personality molds 
new types of thought and action. 
We have been considering efficiency in teaching 
from the point of view of the work the pupils do 
when at their studies. There is, 
Another view of + however, another vantage-ground teacher efficiency ’ 8e-g' 
pepo ols from which this same subject may 
be observed, and that is the kind 
and number of questions which teachers ask. Obvi- 
ously, the sort of questions which experience leads 
children to expect will largely determine their meth- 
od of study. It is another case of adaptation. As 
far as possible children fit their study to the ques- 
tions they expect. If the running-fire method is 
used, answers of a single word or two will be given 
and thinking will yield to memory.

seventh grammar through the last year of the high 
school. Twenty lessons were stenographically re- 
ported. These reports were afterward submitted 
to the teachers of the several classes for correction. 
In addition to this set of shorthand reports, in each 
of which everything said by the teacher and pupils 
was taken down, two different studies in observa- 
tion were made. First, a series of one hundred 
random observations in various subjects of the cur- 
riculum was made for the purpose of counting and 
noting the number and nature of the questions 
asked; and second, a series of observations of ten 
selected classes, each class being followed through 
an entire school-day to study the “question-and- 
answer stimulus in the aggregate as it is adminis- 
tered to school children daily.” On going to a 
school for the purpose of observing and obtaining 
stenographic reports the classes of the best teachers 
were always selected. This detailed statement is 
given to show that the conclusions are drawn from 
teaching far above the average of even our best city 
schools. 
The most profitable questions are, of course, those 
that come as the result of reflection and which are 
put to obtain information needed 
in thinking out some problem. 
Naturally, the greater part of these must come from 
the pupils, and one of the tests of good teaching is 
the number of such questions. If they are not asked, The resulting data

it is pretty good evidence that there is no think- 
ing. Now Miss Stevens’ stenographic reports show 
thirty questions of this sort out of a total of two 
thousand, and some of these thirty were asked by 
the teachers to ascertain whether note-books were 
ready. Further, Miss Stevens estimates that among 
these same two thousand questions there were at 
most only two or three hundred which might be 
said to stimulate reflection, But a large proportion 
of even these questions, she adds, were of the kind 
represented by “What do you think?” and others 
of a similar nature. 
Almost total lack of natural questions—questions 
asked because of desire for information needed in 
Recclonquertions thinking—was a common fault 
from pupils found observed by the Ohio State School 
Dynschooleurvey# Survey Commission. The Port- 
land (Oregon) School Survey Committee also found 
entire absence of originality. “Except in one ex- 
ercise, in all my visits to grammar-grade rooms,” 
says the investigator, “I heard not a single ques- 
tion asked by a pupil, not a single remark or com- 
ment made to indicate that the pupil had any really 
vital interest in the subject-matter of the exercise; 
on not a single occasion was there interested dis- 
agreement and active discussion over any point to 
show that the pupils were thinking independently.” 
Closely connected with the small number of 
thought-provoking questions which these investiga- 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
62 LEARNING AND DOING 
The danger of tions reveal is the rapidity with 
rapid questioning which Miss Stevens heard ques- 
tions asked. From two to four a minute was the av- 
erage during the forty minute periods. Obviously, 
children will not learn to think when questions are 
shot at them by this rapid-fire process. There is no 
inducement to think because the method appeals to 
verbal memory—even associative memory plays lit- 
tle part—and children are very quick to adapt their 
mode of study to the plan that brings the best im- 
mediate results. When under fire of questions the 
best protection is to have the bit of information on 
the end of the tongue ready to be dropped out, pref- 
erably in a single word, without the delay of a mo- 
ment’s reflection. 
Even with history, especially suited for training 
in discriminative judgment, “in the hundreds of 
Concerning the class rooms where I have made 
form of questions observations of the questioning,” 
says Miss Stevens, “I have found very few ques- 
tions so framed by the teachers that they called for 
any individual judgments. . . . Analysis of the 
six stenographic reports on history reveals the fact 
that by classifying as a judgment question every 
one that could possibly involve the element of judg- 
ment the highest attainment is twenty-eight in a 
total of one hundred and twenty-five, and twenty- 
nine in a total of one hundred and five, while the 
lowest record was three in sixty.” But Miss Ste- 
vens further observes, in this connection, “that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  EFFICIENT TEACHING 63 
judgments were largely upon choice of words with 
reference to historical interpretation. Removing 
many of the quoted questions from their history 
setting, one might as easily believe that they were 
taken from an English lesson.” The Ohio State 
Survey Commission also found that in the teaching 
of history “there was little sign of real activity on 
the part of the pupils, questions of any kind by 
pupils being extremely rare.” 
The amount of time monopolized by teachers was 
another striking defect in teaching revealed by Miss

measured by the number of words spoken, was six-

A city superintendent, stirred by the report, in- 
spected his own schools to see whether it could 
be possible that his teachers were doing so 
much of the class work and he estimated the teach- 
er activity in his schools at from eighty-five to 
ninety-five per cent. when the teachers were not 
lecturing. Even in classes in which the number 
of questions was reduced from four to two or less 
per minute, the collective pupil activity was only 
about thirty-seven per cent. The children’s part in 
the recitation consisted chiefly in occasionally punc- 
tuating the teacher’s answers and remarks with a 
word or two. Evidently teachers “carry the ball” 
too much as a boy once said. Thinking does not

differ greatly from football in the manner of acquir- 
ing the art. There is but one way of learning 
either, and that is by “playing the game” and “play- 
ing hard.” In neither case is skill acquired by sit- 
ting in the bleachers and watching others. What- 
ever the occupation the only way to gain proficiency 
is by actually doing it. Children rarely work harder 
than the conditions require and if teachers prefer to 
do the work for them the pupils will not deprive 
them of the pleasure. 
The problem of efficient teaching is how to force 
children to think. Work will then take care of it-

children to think jnowledge and experience and 
which will not down until the apparent contradiction 
has been removed, is what is wanted in the school. 
When this attitude is produced and responsibility 
put upon the pupils they develop the power to start 
things and carry them through. Following a leader, 
even though that leader be the teacher, tends to take 
from children whatever latent ability for initiative 
they may have. This effect has often been observed 
on adults. A man kept for a number of years in a 
subordinate position with all his work laid out loses 
the power to think and act independently. Though 
pupils adapt themselves to predigested mental nutri- 
ment yet, in their more serious moments, they rebel. 
“We don’t need to think,” said a boy of fourteen, 
recently, to the writer. “We just follow the book.”
-P-A-G-E-83
  EFFICIENT TEACHING 65 
Miss Stevens found this criticism true. “It is the 
book first and always,” she says. Knowledge and 
experience are not necessarily used just because one 
has them. Their use must be learned like the han- 
dling of any other tool; and skill can be gained only 
by those who do the things themselves. 
When responsibility is put upon the pupils, when 
their own thoughts and investigations at home and 
in the library rank above the text-book and even 
above the teacher’s statements, they will adapt them- 
selves to thinking, which after all is a pleasant pas- 
time, and so many questions will arise that the hour 
will be too short. Then teaching will be efficient, 
for children will be taught to do their own work 
“as if you taught them not.”

sights she met the Cheshire cat. 
“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought 
to go from here?’ said Alice. 
“*That depends a good deal on where you want

““T don’t much care where—’ said Alice. 
“*Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said 
the Cat. 
“*_so long as I get somewhere,’ Alice added 
as an explanation. 
“Oh, you're sure to do that,’ said the Cat, ‘if 
you only walk long enough.’ ” 
The Cheshire cat understood the philosophy of 
good teaching as well as of walking. Fear is often

ee ee GETTING RESULTS 67 
is followed day after day. The teacher who tries 
new ways may make mistakes, but trial and error 
are the method of progress. They are also the 
method of good teaching. 
A few days ago the writer attended a teachers’ 
meeting in which new plans of work were being 
discussed. 
“T have gone through the whole series of fads,” 
one teacher said. “I tried them all as fast as they 
Successful experi Came out, and they all failed. We

on mental attitude 112 test of time.” Suppose Ehr- 
lich had said that after trying six hundred and five 
experiments. He would have missed by a single 
experiment one of the greatest medical discoveries 
of the age. After all, success is relative. Were 
Ehrlich’s six hundred and five experiments failures? 
If they were he would never have attained his goal. 
For it were folly to think that his discovery was an 
accident. He learned something from each experi- 
ment, gradually eliminating one error after another, 
always mindful of his purpose. And right here we 
see the reason for the failure of the experiments that 
the teacher tried. He went through the list as many 
travelers to Europe “study” art. They visit the 
galleries, view the paintings starred in Baedecker 
and pass on. The dividends of experience are al- 
ways in proportion to what we ourselves invest in 
the enterprise. Experiments are planned experi- 
ence and their success requires confidence in the

  68 LEARNING AND DOING 
method and enthusiasm for results. One rarely 
succeeds in doing what one believes will fail. In 
such cases the mental attitude is in opposition to 
success. 
Experience that counts is not gained by merely 
living. Rousseau was right when he said that a man 
Experience that | May be buried at the age of a 
counts hundred years, who really had 
been dead from the hour of his birth. Experience 
involves interpretation of conditions and situations. 
Data gathered for the purpose of discovering new 
meaning becomes, for the thoughtful, data with 
meaning. But events may come and go and leave 
no impress. This was the case with a teacher of 
fifteen years’ “experience” who recently said to a 
beginner, “You will not be so enthusiastic about 
your work when you have taught longer.” . 
The life of an infant is a “big, blooming, buzzing 
confusion,” William James once remarked. That 
Education as in- is what life always is, and educa- 
terpretation of life tion, in the highest sense, is only 
an attempt to bring a little order into this confusion 
and to clarify it as far as available knowledge per- 
mits. This involves interpretation, and interpreta- 
tion requires the accumulation of data for compari- 
son in order that the essential may be separated from 
the accidental. Only through the elimination of the 
unessential factors can we discover cause and effect, 
and if we do not do this we are only living through 
the events which would give us experience if rightly

interpreted. We are not getting experience. Inter- 
pretation necessitates thinking, which has never 
been popular because of its difficulty. “I am in- 
clined to hold that man really thinks very little and 
very seldom,” said Wundt, not long ago, when com- 
paring man with the lower animals, and Josh Bill- 
ings expressed the same conviction in his quaint 
way when he said, ‘“’Tain’t what men don’t know 
that makes trouble in the world, it’s what they know 
for certain that ain’t so.” 
Teaching is much the same as other occupations. 
We shall find in a later chapter that business men 
who are satisfied with the old 
ways of doing things inevitably 
give way to the more progressive. In science no 
one lasts long who does not seek to add to knowl- 
edge by investigation and experiments. Content- 
ment is'death. “It is a signe his wits grow short, 
when he is pleased; or a signe of wearinesse,” said 
that keen critic of human nature, Montaigne. 
I know that teachers are overworked. They are 
burdened with classes and teachers’ meetings and 
Metilarationiol reports which are of no use ex- 
real experiments cept to fill the superintendent’s 
annual report with figures that are never read. A 
real experiment, however, gives zest to class work 
and the teacher who is enthusiastic over the results 
is amazed to find his “wearinesse” gone. Fatigue 
is quite as often the effect of monotony as of ex- 
cessive work. In an experiment the children catch Contentment fatal

the enthusiasm of the teacher. Besides, a well 
planned experiment grows out of the needs of the 
pupils. Each child then becomes a problem for 
study instead of a disturbance to be suppressed ; and 
the solution of every child-problem contributes to 
the interpretation of the experiment. New plans 
of conducting classes—plans arranged to circum- 
vent school indolence—keep the teacher and pupils 
active because of the unexpected situations which 
continually arise under the experimental method. 
Constant effort to fit the plan to the instinct of 
children to work out their present salvation—their 
tendency to construct, to direct, to manage, and 
in their management to reconstruct and improve 
—keeps the teacher alert and the appeal to their 
native impulses stirs the enthusiasm of the pupils. 
“The attitude of the teacher as she teaches, of the 
pupil as he learns,” says the Portland report, “is 
unquestionably of far more importance than is the 
subject with which they deal; when passive, neither 
teachers nor pupils are putting themselves into their 
work.” 
The experiments which follow are not theoretical. 
They are real. They have been actually tried in 
estat schools. In most instances the earning to know i :

first requirement for success in repeating an experi- 
ment is like conditions, and adults are not alike. 
Personality must always enter into the reckoning 
in computing the reaction of children. J mean the 
personality of teachers. For the response of groups 
of children under the same conditions may be fore- 
told. The unknown quantities, whose values are to 
be determined, are adults. And, in this human equa- 
tion these values must be computed in terms of the 
known quantities— children. Such experiments, 
therefore, perform the further service of helping 
teachers to know themselves, since one success is 
all that is needed to justify an experiment. Inabil- 
ity to repeat what others have done successfully 
gives occasion to study one’s own personality in the 
light of the facts which the experiment and failure 
disclose. As an illustration of this method of check- 
ing up one’s idiosyncrasies, the following may be 
quoted from a letter of a teacher who had tried the 
same experiment with two classes of about one hun- 
dred each: 
“What puzzled me was that the two classes re- 
acted in quite different ways. I am inclined to 
think, however, that the cause lay 
in myself; because I think that in 
the second year I unintentionally assumed more au- 
thority than when trying the plan for the first time. 
Perhaps, too, the fact that I was quite evidently 
feeling my way the first year caused the children to 
take more responsibility on themselves so as to help Illustration

the work along. I shall certainly try it another 
year.” 
Let us now pass to the first of our series of ex- 
periments. The following is a plan tried in teach- 
An experiment in ing first year composition in the 
composition high school.* The early part of 
the work was given to practice in sentence structure, 
variety of expression, punctuation, capitalization, 
paragraphing, etc. The material was always taken 
from the every-day life of the children. In this way 
straightforward narrative without plot was taught. 
The experiment itself began with the second term. 
“In beginning this subject,” the teacher continues, 
“T usually take some narrative of a simple incident, 
a buggy-ride, for instance. I ask the pupils to in- 
troduce ‘something’ that will interfere with the ride. 
Immediately various obstacles are suggested—a 
piece of paper or an automobile, at which the horse 
is frightened—and before we know it a simple plot 
is formed of the resulting runaway.” 
The teacher then announced to the class that they 
might write a book on “The Adventures of John- 
Response of ny,” “Johnny to be a mischievous 
children small boy and the adventures to be 
taken from various stages of his career. Each 
composition—one a week—that we wrote in this 
term was to constitute a chapter of the story. 
There were a few dubious, some superior and many

apathetic members, but before we reached the end 
of the ‘Johnny’ series, out of a class of over a hun- 
dred there were not more than four or five who 
were unresponsive. Their delight in creating some- 
thing—in the thought that they were ‘authors’-— 
removed the idea of drudgery which the word com- 
position is wont to suggest, and gave them an acute 
interest in the proceedings. 
“In the first of the series, ‘Johnny’s First Battle,’ 
I gave the circumstances of the story, introduc- 
Gems details ing Johnny as a boy of four 
of plan years who had been given a 
soldier’s suit and equipment with which he goes 
forth to conquer. The ‘something’ that occasions 
the plot presents itself in the shape of a turkey gob- 
bler. A battle ensues. Its issue, and the consequent 
story, the pupils were to recount according to their 
own ideas.” The following is one of the chapters 
which was written by a pupil: 
JOHN NY’s FIRST BATTLE 
There was never a happier little boy than Johnny, 
on his fourth birthday, for Uncle Harry sent 
him a soldier suit and his papa 
gave him a gun which would 
really shoot a rubber ball. The tenth of May, 
Johnny’s birthday, was rainy and cool, so Johnny 
was made to stay in the house. Before the 
day was over he had broken two panes of glass 
and hurt every one in the house from grandma 
down to Baby Ruth, with “the horrid gun,” as 
grandma called it. A result

  74, LEARNING AND DOING 
That evening, Johnny’s big brother was reading 
a book which had on the cover a picture of a 
soldier. Johnny asked what the man was doing, 
and when he was told that the man had started out 
to conquer the world, it set his little mind to think- 
ing. When his mamma tucked him into bed, he 
said, “Mamma, how big is the world?” On being 
told it was many, many miles around he gave a 
little sigh—but soon fell asleep. 
When Johnny awoke, he asked his mamma to 
dress him in his soldier’s suit. After having his 
breakfast, he started out to conquer the world. He 
succeeded in subduing the world as far as the barn- 
yard gate, when he met an old turkey gobbler who 
refused to be subdued. Discovering that he had 
left the rubber ball at home, Johnny hit the turkey 
with his gun. At this the turkey commenced peck- 
ing and flapping his wings in Johnny’s face. Johnny 
fought bravely, but a great turkey gobbler was too 
much for a four-year-old boy. Mamma heard the 
screams, ran to the door, and seeing what was hap- 
pening ran to Johnny’s assistance with a broom. 
Johnny was brought into the house, a very much 
bruised, but very happy, little boy, for he thought 
he had conquered at least half the world and could 
do the rest to-morrow. 
After titles and suggestions for the plots of chap- 
ters, “Johnny Runs Away” and “Johnny’s First 
Day at School,” had been given, the children asked 
permission to choose their own subjects and to be 
allowed to work them up as each desired without 
suggestions from the teacher. The following is one 
of these chapters:
-P-A-G-E-93

JOHNNY’S PIGEON-BOXES 
At the age of ten Johnny had a great deal of 
work to do, at least he thought so, and often 
» grew very angry because his 
plans were destroyed by his be- 
ing called into the house to do some work. One 
day Johnny was sent out to watch his small brother 
while his mother ran to one of the neighbors. 
The carpenters had been reshingling the summer 
kitchen and had left their ladder leaning against 
the house. Johnny saw a fine opportunity to put 
in operation a long-cherished plan. After fastening 
the baby into the chair, he went to the wood-shed 
after some pigeon-boxes that he had built long be- 
fore. He mounted the ladder for the purpose of 
putting these boxes on the roof and as he was 
drawing his knife from his pocket, it slipped from 
his fingers and landed with a loud whack on the 
head of the baby, who at once set up a howl that 
brought his mother in double-quick order. Johnny 
crawled down the ladder a very frightened boy. 
His fear increased as his mother appeared with 
a large switch and he was led into the house. What 
happened in the house is known only to Johnny, 
his mother and the switch. Another “chapter’

pleasant surprises. The effect upon the children 
was no less striking. While some papers were very 
faulty and many needed revision and rewriting, an 
exceptionally large number of the class, according 
to the teacher, learned to write in a free, easy and 
natural manner. The reason for their success is 
that the children felt that the work was theirs. They 
were authors. Young adolescents are always inter- 
ested in doing things when responsibility accom- 
panies the work. The source of this enthusiasm is 
the desire to control, to manage, to create, and when 
the work is done, to feel that it is their production. 
This is the spirit of youth. 
Another experiment was called to the writer’s at-

a physics class following item, which appeared in 
one of the New York papers :* 
Every boy of the twenty-five hundred who at- 
tended the public school at Broome and Willett 
Streets was fired with admiration and interest when 
two diminutive Edisons from their ranks set up a 
telegraphic system, operated by wet batteries of their 
own construction and stretching four hundred feet 
through the school building from one room to 
another. For weeks the two boys had been reading 
the life of Morse and studying the scientific prin- 
ciple behind this use of electricity.

and the principal stood beside the transmitter and

dictated the first message sent to the receiving oper- 
ator in the distant room, 
Since a recent report* of the United States Com- 
missioner of Education has shown that physics and 
other high-school sciences have been rapidly losing 
pupils, the writer thought the evidence of enthusi- 
asm indicated by this newspaper item worth a letter 
of inquiry. The following explanation of the cause 
of the interest has been taken from letters received 
from the principal of the school and the teacher of 
physics. 
“The problem of arousing and maintaining inter- 
est in the study of elementary science is largely 
Cause of their solved when boys can be induced 
enthusiasm to make something of their own. 
The home work is often crudely executed, but it 
delights the boys because it works. They become 
very enthusiastic when they fashion something use- 
ful. The study of pitch, for example, is not essen- 
tially interesting of itself, but it acquires an interest 
when boys can play melodies on violins of their own 
making.” A number of boys in this school con- 
structed violins out of cigar boxes upon which sim- 
ple tunes could be played. Indeed, a “Cigar Box 
Orchestra” was organized. Equilibrium toys, pith 
ball electroscopes, various kinds of batteries, a 
model of a steam-engine, induction coils and parts 
of wireless outfits were also made. Four boys in-

stalled home-made wireless apparatus in their homes. 
“In a word, boys make things for the fun of mak- 
ing them.” 
The writer has elsewhere* described the “town- 
meeting method” of teaching history. The class 
‘Toyn-meeting was organized into a New Eng- 
method of teach- land town-meeting, with chair- 
ae HetOry man and secretary, and the reci- 
tations were conducted and the lessons assigned by 
the chairman. The following experiment, which 
was suggested by the success of this town-meeting 
plan, has been carried on in the English classes of 
the Somerville (Massachusetts) high school. The 
writer is indebted to the teacher, Miss Elizabeth H. 
Hunt, for the interesting description: 
“First of all,” she says, “I let my classes decide 
whether they wish to be governed by a chairman. 
Similar plan of If they do not, I continue to act 
organization as their head.” The correspond- 
ence shows that they usually decide to elect their own 
chairman. They also have a sort of Supreme Court, 
or legislative body, selected by ballot from their 
numbers, This court decides questions which con- 
cern the success of the class work and has the power 
to initiate “legislation.” Miss Hunt then con- 
tinues: “I am always the referee to decide all cases 
which the judiciary can not settle. In other words, 
I am the Court of Appeals. When the pupils find 
a lazy boy or girl they bring him up standing by

means of a law which they pass in their executive 
board meetings or sometimes in the class, but usual- 
ly in the former to save time. The board meets at 
the close of the recitation. JI attend when they re- 
quest my presence, but they usually meet by them- 
selves and report their decisions to the class at the 
next meeting. We have the ‘recall’ in operation. 
If they do not like the decision of the board, they 
do not accept it, but a two-thirds vote is needed to 
overrule. Then a pupil has the right to appeal to 
me from any decision, and if I think the decision 
unjust I do not sustain it, but give another penalty. 
I rarely fail, however, to sustain the decision of the 
lower court, for I find, as a rule, that those whom 
the class elect to act as the judiciary branch of their 
organization are wise enough to meet conditions 
which arise. They usually lean a bit toward sever- 
ity and sometimes I feel it necessary to ask for 
clemency. 
“As an instance of how the class manages a situ- 
ation, a few weeks ago my class of boys was study- 
How the plan was ing Quentin Durward. We often 
carried out have parts of a chapter read in 
dialogue form, leaving out the explanatory matter. 
Suddenly the lesson began to drop into just the 
readings, no one saying anything on any subject 
which he had looked up outside to throw light on 
the lesson. The chairman of the judiciary board 
arose and said very energetically: ‘I think that we 
are just giving our members a chance to bluff

through the lessons. Many give no proof that they 
have done any preparatory work ahead. Any fel- 
low can get up here and do what we are doing 
without any preparation and we don’t get any vari- 
ety out of it. The judiciary committee suggests 
that in the future only two scenes be allowed at a 
meeting and those by fellows who have offered oth- 
er work.’ This was at once put to a vote and car- 
ried, a good-natured grin being noticeable on the 
faces of some of the boys. I had been waiting to 
see how they would meet this without my saying 
anything. Had this been a class where all depends 
on the teacher for support no one would have said 
a word. The chairman of that week had gone to 
the judiciary board and asked it to act. He felt 
the responsibility. I had said nothing. 
“The other day the same class took up another 
matter that I knew must be handled. The debates 
Absentees dealt Come once a week, four boys at 
with by the class 4 time, Twice lately members of 
the team had been absent on that day, thus throw- 
ing out the others. As the class was expected to 
study the question there was no other lesson ready. 
The second time this happened the boys were indig- 
nant and the class passed a law that unless those 
having parts could prove to the satisfaction of the 
judiciary board that the absence was unavoidable, 
‘and that means that you can’t get up,’ those failing 
should prepare two debates, and in any case where 
it is possible they should let the others know in time

GETTING RESULTS 81 
to notify the class to prepare a lesson from the 
book. ‘We can’t afford, fellows,’ said the mover of 
the motion, ‘to waste lessons like this.’ No one 
laughs at the others for such zeal. It is their work 
and they know that we have just so much to do each 
day to cover the work in eight weeks. 
“The chairman plans the work for the following 
day, then calls for volunteers, those who have pre- 
Work directed pared related topics outside the 
by pupils lesson. After this he asks ques- 
tions, selects passages to be read or takes up words 
needing explanation. At the close of the hour I 
may comment on topics, correct the mistakes in pro- 
nunciation which they have overlooked and, in fact, 
act as guide or helper. But it often happens that 
there is no need for me to speak a word during the 
entire recitation. 
“Tf there is disorder they handle it themselves, 
either at once or by calling the offending member 
Concerning before the judiciary board. I 
discipline always tell them that, like any gov- 
ernor, I must step in and declare martial law if they 
can’t keep order, for I am the responsible head of 
the school. Once I stepped in too soon, and, at the 
close of school, the chairman said very politely, 
‘Miss Hunt, I think I ought to have had a little 
more time to meet that. I could have done it.’ I 
apologized to him and admitted that I had made a 
mistake. It is hard to down the old pedagogical 
training, but I have found that it pays. It requires
-P-A-G-E-100
  82 LEARNING AND DOING 
tact, infinite self-control and wisdom to hold in 
abeyance the instinct of a teacher to jump in and 
rob the children of the experience of untangling 
their own snares, but if the teacher can only learn 
to let them work out their problems, even if they 
get into very complicated ones, it is a great gain for 
these young citizens and they always profit from it. 
“When they waste time in unprofitable discussion 
some one will suddenly say, ‘Let’s get down to 
work.’ If the work which must be done each day 
is not finished they know that it means an extra 
hour somewhere, so they take their medicine with- 
out a murmur and come together at the close of 
school. I do not compel them to come. They know 
that it is necessary and the chairman calls them to- 
gether. Had I been to blame, they would have 
grumbled. But they feel the responsibility and act 
accordingly. I purposely let them learn the price 
of time. 
“As to the work accomplished, I know that we 
never did so much outside reading in the old way. 
For example, one of my _ best 
classes, a college division, wished 
to dramatize A Tale of Two Cities. I left the plan- 
ning of the entire work to them. We went into a 
committee of the whole, broke up into groups and 
I passed from one group to another as they beck- 
oned tome. We finally evolved the plan of appoint- 
ing four leaders who should choose those who were 
to divide the story into acts, those who were to.write Results of plan

the scenes, select the actors, stage managers, etc. 
We had eight weeks in which to do it and they kept 
their forces at work ‘day and night.’ When they 
found a lazy boy who refused to take the work 
assigned, or who did not keep at it, they dealt sum- 
marily with him, and before it was necessary for 
me to take a hand he was at work. Had I given 
them such an ambitious task the groans would have 
been deep and loud. I was, in part, responsible for 
the suggestion, because I wanted them to have that 
practice, but I should never have required it of them. 
They did it wonderfully well. Each day a scene 
was ready. The writers read their parts and the 
class, viewing it as a play, detected faults, gave ad- 
vice, told where it was not clear, where it dragged, 
where it must be given more situation, etc. All of 
the principles upon which we had drilled in the 
study of the drama during the early part of the 
year were hunted up and brought forward with a 
great display of wisdom. A year of study in the 
usual way would not have accomplished what they 
did in that short time. 
“They also gained a much better appreciation of 
the whole work than has ever been the case in any 
Growth in power Of my classes conducted on the 
to think traditional plan. One boy said to 
me: ‘Miss Hunt, I never knew before the differ- 
ence between the work of a novelist and that of a 
dramatist. I did not understand the drama when 
we studied it the first part of the year, but now I
-P-A-G-E-102
  84 LEARNING AND DOING 
do.’ This is only one of many instances which 
might be cited. 
“The other day in a debate one of the boys criti- 
cized a speaker for having his hands in his pockets 
Improvement while speaking. ‘There are no 
in manners girls present,’ said another. ‘The 
fellows at college are easy, why can’t we be?’ One 
of the others reminded the speaker that Miss Hunt 
was present and might object. I at once said that 
I wished them to act in the matter independently of 
the question of sex. I then suggested that they 
take it to the higher standard of what the best 
speakers do in public. They observed for a week 
and then unanimously decided to keep their hands 
out of their pockets while speaking. 
“The following is another instance of the way 
in which a social attitude develops through their 
Avtesuid of feeling of responsibility. One of 
responsibility the boys was below in English. 
He was very popular and was one of the candidates 
for the chairman of the following week. We had 
made no rule about grades. The boy, however, 
rose and said, seriously: ‘I am down in English 
and until I get square I don’t want to be your 
leader.’ This established a good precedent and 
brought forward another question which I was hop- 
ing would come up. Why should not the honor of 
being elected chairman be a spur to better work? 
They discussed the question and decided that the 
chairman should so conduct the lesson as to show 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  GETTING RESULTS 85 
that he was studying and thus get his credits. This 
point having been settled they then decided to leave 
it to a member’s choice whether he would accept the 
honor, if down.” 
Another experiment—this time in American his- 
tory and government—which has come to the writ- 
aches tae er’s attention, differs somewhat 
ment in pupil- from the one just described be- 
Cerone cause it was not intended to give 
the children any unusual authority and control. 
After the work had started, however, the teacher, 
on account of alarming symptoms, was suddenly 
forbidden to use her eyes. Since a substitute in the 
middle of the year was undesirable, she was given 
permission to follow any plan that seemed wise. 
Her helplessness necessitated giving the children 
much more authority than had originally been 
planned, and the children responded with the frank- 
ness that they always show when responsibility is 
put upon them. It makes an interesting comment 
on the efficiency of pupil-government that in the 
following year, when the teacher recovered ‘her 
health and again assumed the authority which, dur- 
ing the previous year, she had been obliged to dele- 
gate to her pupils, the plan failed. With loss of 
responsibility in managing their work the interest 
of the children dropped to the level of that in the 
ordinary recitation.* 
*The writer is indebted to Miss Nellie Hammond, of 
Woburn, Massachusetts, for the following description of the 
experiment,
-P-A-G-E-104
  86 LEARNING AND DOING 
Having spoken of the trouble with her eyes 
which threatened to force her temporary withdrawal 
from the school, Miss Hammond pays: “After 
thinking the matter over carefully, I decided to take 
the children into my confidence. I explained the 
situation to them and told them that they must de- 
cide whether I should put in a substitute. All the 
classes voted that if I would stay they would carry 
on the work as well as they could for themselves. 
“The recently elected school chniddiiee of Wo- 
burnia, our school city, took charge of the senior 
Plan of work for Class.”” This school committee of 
senior class eight pupils had he elected some 
weeks before by the senior class from its members 
for the purpose of assisting the teacher in promot- 
ing the interests of the class. The divisions were 
large and one of the problems was to have each pu- 
pil take part in the discussion often enough to as- 
sure daily preparation. This committee had already 
responded with zeal to requests for assistance. It 
had made many suggestions and had relieved the 
teacher of much of the routine work. Now, of 
course, Miss Hammond being unable to use her 
eyes, the responsibility increased. “I gave the com- 
mittee outlines, reading lists and plans of work 
used in previous years from which they assigned 
lessons, topics and readings. On the whole I think 
the work went on much as if I had planned it. They 
showed considerable originality in the study of local 
government, ‘The seriousness with which they dis-
-P-A-G-E-105
GETTING RESULTS 87 
cussed existing evils and the weight of responsibil- 
ity which they seemed to feel was surprising. I 
think that each boy felt that the salvation of Wo- 
burn rested upon his shoulders.” 
The mayor of Woburnia, the school city, pre- 
pared an inaugural address which he delivered be- 
fore the school. His address, which the writer has 
before him, is a very creditable discussion of the 
financial condition of Woburn, the assessment of 
property, insurance, the fire department, water de- 
partment and schools. 
“The junior class,” Miss Hammond continues, 
“had no organization with which to begin their 
Pian of organt- work of self-instruction, so they 
zation of junior drafted a constitution.” As this 
Cee class was studying modern and 
current history, the constitution, after stating the 
object, which was to increase the interest and effi- 
ciency in the work, made provision for various com- 
mittees. Among others there were the Topic Com- 
mittee, to prepare outlines, the Library Committee, 
to find references for outside reading, the Far East 
Committee, the Near East Committee, the Commit- 
tee on European Affairs, the Committee on United 
States Affairs, the Committee on State Affairs and 
the Committee on Woburn Affairs. These com- 
mittees were to report on historical and current 
topics within their jurisdiction.

Spirit of pressed with the business spirit 
their work manifested. There seemed to be 
no supersensitiveness or affectation. The work had 
to be done and they were to do it, so each did his 
share to the best of his or her ability. 
“One incident showed the moral feeling that de- 
velops under pupil-government. The pupils had 
Moral effect of voted to take a secret ballot at 
pupil-government the recitation following an ex- 
amination, A ballot marked ‘yes’ indicated that 
the one who cast it neither knew nor suspected any 
one of cheating while a ballot marked ‘no’ meant 
that the voter did know or suspect some irregu- 
larity that should be cleared up. At the first ballot 
there were twenty ‘yeses’ and ten ‘noes.’ A dis- 
cussion of the duty of the ten voters followed. 
There was a strong disinclination to tell on any 
one, but at the same time they felt that the public 
welfare should be protected. Finally, it was de- 
cided that each one of the ten should come to me 
privately and explain the reason for his or her 
vote, and I was instructed to use my discretion 
about accepting or rejecting the examination. I 
took no part in the discussion, telling them that 
they should work out a line of action for them- 
selves. At the close of school, a boy came and 
confessed that he had cheated. He said that he 
wanted to make sure of getting on the football 
team. When I asked him why he confessed he

“the offices of keryx (herald) and toxotes (ser- 
geant-at-arms) were bestowed, in at least two in- 
stances, upon students who were better known for 
their pleasing address than for their intellectuality.” 
A committee of the boulé (council) acting with 
the teacher submitted a set of resolutions to the 
agora (assembly, i. e., the class) each day. These 
resolutions were so worded as to include, in their 
discussion, the most important facts of the day’s 
lesson.

may be made to include statements and inquiries 
involving cause and effect to an extent that rarely 
enters into the study of high-school pupils. This 
is a distinct intellectual gain, since children in the 
school are prone to confine themselves to learning 
facts. How far such resolutions actually do pro- 
mote thought will depend upon the committee in 
charge and the tactful suggestions of the teacher.

An experiment in Roman State” of the classical de- 
teaching Latin —_ partment of the East High School 
in Rochester, New York. The organization as de- 
scribed below is altogether too complex to be under- 
taken at once in high-school classes. The “State” 
to which we are referring was of three years’
-P-A-G-E-109
    GETTING RESULTS 91 
growth; “consequently, since it was not all put 
into operation at once it did not require so much 
work and explanation as would appear. Each year 
the pupils were given the additional instruction 
needed for understanding what was to be developed 
during the year.’* 
The Roman State of the school was organized 
with the creation of collegia opificum (trade guilds) 
Pi: of each with its princeps (president), 
organization magistri (master-workmen) and 
discentes (apprentices). The pupils now learn much 
to their amazement—in view of the fact that, next 
to forms and declensions, war and speeches are the 
chief subjects of study during the first two years 
—that laboring men organized into trades unions 
were an important part of the Roman population. 
“And when they learn that the fabri (guild of 
carpenters) and the cornicines (musicians’ guild) 
and others outdate the Roman Republic and even 
history, they gain a new idea of the antiquity of 
these institutions and their accompanying problems,” 
as well as of the Roman Republic itself. 
After the formation of the collegia each pupil 
receives a Latin name and is enrolled in the curia, 
tribus, classis and centuria on the basis, respectively, 
of birth, geography, wealth and age. “Birth is 
represented by scholarship and on that basis each 
pupil is made a patrician or plebeian.”

92 LEARNING AND DOING 
Naturally, the campaigns, elections and the 
activities of the “State” and its officials aroused 
great interest in the school. As it was desirable 
to build the “State” on the interests of the pupils, 
the ambitio (quiet canvassing) and the professio 
(public declaration of candidacy) came early in the 
organization. The youngsters learned that the can- 
didates never took the initiative, at least in theory. 
They never announced their own candidacy, never 
spoke in their own behalf. This was done by their 
neighbors, friends and relatives. These facts the 
pupils find have been learned from inscriptions— 
the Roman newspaper. In imitation of the inscrip- 
tions found on the walls of houses and shops in 
Pompeii, the pupils painted some excellent inscrip- 
tions and the “variety of Latin employed would 
rival some of our prose books. A favorite mode 
of advertising (candidates) was to parody well- 
known passages of Cesar, Cicero and Vergil.” 
The following is a portion of a Popularis adapta- 
tion.

una Populares, alia Equestres, tertia Optimates ap- 
pellatur. Hae omnes sensu, animo, opinione inter

feeling for the language. The question of Latin 
prose is always with us.” 
Meanwhile the parties had been preparing their 
platforms and the following are those of the Popu-

“Even if the most important period in the life

Effect on campaigns and elections, did for 
regular work a month cause a marked loss in

the teacher, “I should maintain that the exchange

amount of text read, if that be made a criterion 
of progress, would ultimately be greatly increased 
by the greater interest, and, consequently, more 
rapid advance. As a matter of fact, the work of 
my own classes was not interrupted at all, while 
the other Latin instructors estimated the cost at 
from one to three chapters of Cesar, one or two 
chapters of Cicero and two lessons in the beginning 
class.” As an offset to this the pupils had the 
deeper knowledge of the life and times of the Ro- 
man people which they gleaned from the activity 
of the “State.”

time forming an integral part of their classical 
studies.

That anything in their study of Latin should so 
arouse their interest that such a proportion should 
voluntarily remain after school hours to further its 
success” is a striking fact in school life. 
The article from which these quotations were 
made was written in 1906. A short time ago I 
pee i wrote to Mr. Gray to inquire 
experiment eight Whether the “Roman State” had 
years later survived the eight-year interval. 
In a certain way, its power to survive would meas- 
ure its educational value. What follows is taken 
from his letter: 
“To give you an idea of the activities of the 
‘Roman State’ at the present time, I will mention 
a few of the things that are now in progress. 
“1, The regular monthly issue of the Vox Pop- 
uli, the organ of the ‘State.’ The contents are 
wholly the work of the pupils. No instructor cor- 
rects or supervises it.* 
“2. The presentation of a little Latin play called 
Troia Capta, About five hundred pupils attended. 
So interested were they in trying to follow the Latin 
that they asked that it be repeated immediately, 
which was done. The actors were chosen from a 
number of volunteer sight-reading clubs, conducted 
under the auspices of the ‘State,’ to which only

pages of Latin prose and poetry written by the pupils.

those of superior scholarship are eligible. Two 
other clubs are preparing similar plays. 
“3. Initiation of freshmen. This ceremony was 
conducted a few months ago. The pontifex mavi- 
mus and one of the censores went to the classes, 
accepted each pupil as a member of the ‘State,’ 
gave him his Latin name and tied his bulla around 
his neck. Everything is said in Latin, at first with 
translation and then without. 
“4. The monthly meeting of the consilium. This 
is a governing body in the ‘State’ and consists 
of the Consules, Censores, Pontifex Maximus, 
Praetor urbanus, Tribunus plebis, the three party 
campaign managers and others chosen by the con- 
suls. At the last meeting, besides the routine busi- 
ness incident to the regular activities, a plan to 
start a Latin museum was presented by the chair- 
man of a committee to which that duty had been 
assigned at a previous meeting. The Praetor ur- 
banus was directed to present for discussion at the 
next meeting a revision of the laws and statutes 
and to prepare them for presentation to the Comitia 
tributa, a general Latin assembly. All of the form- 
alities of the meeting are conducted in Latin, but 
no attempt has been made to use the language in 
the general discussion. I have, however, thought 
of making the experiment. 
“5. The patrician pins. In two or three weeks 
all of the pupils and instructors will vote for the

pupils who, in each class, are deserving of the 
patrician pin, the emblem of scholarship in Latin. 
If the pin is held continuously it is given perma- 
nently at graduation. 
“As to the effect of the ‘Roman State’ on the 
interest of the pupils there is no question. That 
this interest secures a longer pursuit of the sub- 
ject is equally undeniable. I am also strongly of 
the opinion that this interest produces greater ap- 
plication or I should not continue the ‘State’ another 
year. Last winter several members of the class 
got into a discussion in the Clarion, the school paper, 
as to the relative merits of Cicero and Catiline. 
The charges, answers and counter-charges, involving 
the whole history of the populares party and the 
reforms of the Gracchi, continued for several weeks, 
indicating clearly that real independent thought had 
resulted. One pupil wrote a most interesting and 
unexpected comparison of the political proposals of 
63 B. C. and 1912 A. D., comparing the parties 
and platforms.” 
These are a few of the experiments that are 
being tried for the purpose of applying in the 
schools the much advocated but 
The common fac- ,. 4 . 
tor of success in little practised pedagogical max-

several plans which have been described differ 
somewhat in details but they agree in the principle

the work. The success of the projects is due to

  GETTING RESULTS 99 
the motives to which appeal is made—to the racial 
impulse to contrive, to plan, in short to the instinct 
of workmanship in its broadest sense. 
These plans of organization for doing the work 
of the school serve several purposes; they furnish 
Their construct- activities that satisfy the desire 
ive importance for adventure of which we spoke 
in the first chapter. It will be remembered that 
one of them successfully competed even with foot- 
ball for enthusiastic support of the pupils. While 
meeting this need they also further the purposes 
of the school. The children work harder in their 
studies and, in their simple way, they originate and 
investigate by reading more widely so as to make 
their personal contribution to the knowledge of the 
group. The pupils cease to imitate books and teacher. 
They move under their own power. Finally, these 
experiments keep the teachers alive at the growing 
point. They can not settle down into the ruts of 
monotony because each day presents new problems 
which the activity of the children has stirred up.

  CHAPTER IV 
PROGRESS IN LEARNING 
ANY books have been written on methods 
of teaching, but comparatively little has been 
said about methods of learning. While this was 
Lot quite natural in view of our scant ogical arrange- 1 J 
ment not always knowledge of child psychology, it 
the pedagogical = has had the unfortunate effect of 
overemphasizing the arrangement and form of les- 
son plans. The method of lesson-presentation has 
been settled chiefly by reference to the subject-mat- 
ter, and too often with inadequate comprehension 
by the teacher of the wider meaning of the facts 
which it contained. The logical arrangement of 
the parts of the topic for study and the importance 
from the teacher’s view-point, of each portion of 
the whole, have determined the lesson’s plan. But 
in acquiring knowledge, the logical arrangement is 
not always the pedagogical. The mind often ap- 
prehends ideas and things as wholes and analysis 
comes later. The discovery that children acquire 
words and sentences without the preliminary logical 
step of learning letters illustrates this principle. No 
amount of logical analysis would have ever planned 
a lesson in that way. 
English grammar is another case in point. Prob- 
ably there is no subject in the curriculum about

  PROGRESS IN LEARNING TOI 
: which there is more confusion and Failure of logical . 
method in teach- less agreement. It is doubtful, 
inggecarmmay also, whether any subject receives 
more time with worse results. The reason is that 
the logical method has been used. Grammar con- 
tains the syntax, conjugations and principles of the 
language; therefore it is a prerequisite of the writ- 
ten use of that language. Those who reason in this 
way, however, forget that language was spoken and 
written long before its grammar was put down in 
books. Some day an enterprising schoolmaster will 
teach children to write stories before they have 
studied grammar and then we shall find that young- 
sters can use forms of expression without prelimi- 
nary rules just as we now know they read words and 
sentences before they have studied the letters which 
compose them. 
We have been illustrating the two points of view 
in determining the method of the recitation. In 
Laws of learning teaching reading, the child him- 
a recent discovery self—the way in which he apper- 
ceives and assimilates knowledge—is the test of 
method, while in English grammar the logical anal- 
ysis of the language continues to determine the prac- 
tice of the schools. But belief that the value of 
a method is measured by the results obtained has 
been spreading among teachers lately and with its 
growth have arisen the related questions: How is 
knowledge acquired? Are there laws of learning? 
If there are they must surely enter into the dis- 
cussion of method, since in rules for imparting 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  102 LEARNING AND DOING 
knowledge we can not ignore the ways in which 
the mind of the learner acts when receiving it. 
These questions have been answered by recent in- 
vestigations. There are laws of learning. Thus 
far only a few of the more evident ones have been 
discovered, but these few when understood and ap- 
plied must work great changes in schoolroom prac- 
tice. 
First of all there are general laws—laws which 
are true of all learning whatever may be the sub- 
General laws of  Ject studied or the age of the 
learning and learner—and, second, investiga- 
eres tions show variations within these 
general laws. An illustration will make this clear. 
The progress of learning is always irregular. At 
times the learner advances steadily for several days, 
TidktratiGnh lof perhaps even for a week, Then 
irregularity of the quality of his work drops 
learning process suddenly, but it may rise again 
quite as unexpectedly as it fell. This irregularity 
of progress—advance alternating with inability to 
do the work—is one of the general laws of learn- 
ing. It is true of every person and of every sub- 
ject of study. But the length of the period of 
advance and the level to which the learner may 
drop, as well as the length of time during which 
he stays at the lower stage of efficiency, are all 
variations within the general law. In other words, 
if one hundred per cent. is perfect work, the be- 
ginner may make fifty per cent. for the first three 
days and then drop to thirty-five per cent. After
-P-A-G-E-121
  PROGRESS IN LEARNING 1T03 
showing grades to the value of thirty-five per cent. 
for three days he suddenly rises to seventy-five per 
cent. and then drops again to fifty. Again, another 
child in the same class may receive the following 
grades in the tests which we have supposed were 
taken by the first boy: seventy-five per cent., ninety, 
ninety, fifty, fifty, forty, seventy-five and sixty. 
Let us now represent the progress of these two boys 
during the eight days by curves, as the lines which 
show the daily progress are called. If we connect 
the points that represent each day’s grades by 
straight lines, we have the following graphic repre- 
sentation of the progress of the two boys during 
the eight days.

The grades for the boys on each of the eight 
days are given at the left of the curves and the 
Plateaus in learn- days beneath. It will be observed 
ing process that both curves, though they have 
their individual characteristics, agree in being ir- 
regular, i. €., progress is never continuous, and they 
agree also in showing short periods when the learner 
remains stationary. These stationary periods—con- 
secutive days during which the learner neither ad- 
vances nor retrogrades noticeably—are called pla- 
teaus in the curve of learning.
-P-A-G-E-123
  PROGRESS IN LEARNING 105 
So far, of course, we have said nothing that is 
new to teachers. Every one knows that the prog- 
These plateaus tess of children in their studies 
inevitable is not continuous. They do bet- 
ter on some days than on others. But the inter- 
esting fact in this connection is that these boys 
may have worked just as hard during each of the 
days on which they made such different grades and 
the lessons may have been equally difficult. The 
significance of these plateaus for the teacher, and 
the work that should be assigned while the learner 
is on them, will be discussed in the following chap- 
ter. Here we are concerned chiefly with the fact 
that plateaus inevitably occur in studying subjects 
in which the earlier work is essential for under- 
standing what comes later. This is the case with 
such subjects as English grammar, arithmetic and 
all foreign languages. 
Let us now examine the curves of progress which 
have been traced from the daily record of persons 
actually engaged in pursuing a Description of By 848 P 8

The curve shows that during the first ten days 
—namely, for the first five or six recitations—prog- 
ress is pretty continuous and rapid. The reason 
for this is that the work consists in learning a 
few terms and definitions and in applying them. This 
is easy to do because at the beginning the complex- 
ities of the subject are carefully avoided. After about 
ten days, however, the work becomes more involved. 
It is now necessary to exercise nice discrimination 
in the use of terms and those students who have 
not thoroughly mastered the preliminary work be- 
come more or less confused. For this reason their 
marks go down quite steadily. The level that they 
reach will depend upon the accuracy of their knowl- 
edge of the preliminary statements of the book and 
lectures. Some do not go so low as the line in 
this curve while others continue their descent until 
they find themselves submerged and unable to re- 
main in the class. A few drop hardly at all. Their 
progress is irregular, they go up and down accord- 
ing to their physical condition and the amount of 
study given to a day’s assignment, but at no time 
do they go very low.

are not easily organized and appreciated. The stu- 
dent can not see the woods for the trees. Further, 
in his microscopic work the pupil must usually 
acquire a new mental habit—that of thinking things 
in three dimensions while seeing them in two di- 
mensions under the microscope. Consequently, for 
several weeks everything is confused and this con- 
fusion is likely to continue until repetition renders 
certain phenomena familiar. After a period of 
mental digestion, which can not be hurried, the 
student who works persistently succeeds in detach- 
ing himself from his subject and in viewing it at 
arm’s length, so to speak. Then ideas that pre- 
viously were difficult to correlate fall into place 
and difficulties disappear. This is the time when

preparation for this experiment consisted in two

  PROGRESS IN LEARNING III 
A part of the amazing irregularity of this curve 
is probably due to the fact that, since the work 
was done without a teacher, there was no one to 
assist the learner to find a puzzling word or to 
straighten out a perplexing construction. The oc- 
currence of difficulties of this sort caused the curve 
to drop suddenly and it rose quite as quickly when 
the solution was found. Evidently we have here 
an explanation of the startling variation in scholar- 
ship of individual pupils which so often puzzles 
teachers. Assistance was not at hand when it was 
needed and an unnecessary drop occurred in the 
curve of progress. We shall discuss profitable and 
unprofitable help in the following chapter. It is 
sufficient here to observe the effect on progress of 
groping one’s way through a maze of unfamiliar 
facts and statements. This is a condition not un- 
known in the schools. 
Aside from the striking daily variation in the 
curve for Russian, these three curves have the same 
Similarity in re- general peculiarities as the imag- 
sults of two ex- ined cases shown on an earlier 
pepmen page. Progress is never continu- 
ous, but always by jumps. There are days when the 
learner seems to make no gain and then, perhaps, he 
leaps forward. He may now hold his own or he may 
drop back again. But if he loses his hold it is 
not long before he regains it and then he makes 
this higher level the starting-point for further ad- 
vance. This irregularity of the learning process, 
plateaus — stationary periods— alternating with  
-P-A-G-E-130
  112 LEARNING AND DOING 
progress or retrogression, has been found by all 
investigators. 
What is the relation of the highest and lowest 
mark attained on a given day to the actual ability of 
Relation of high the learner in the subject at which 
score to learner’s he is working? Clearly neither 
rate of progress one represents his stage of prog- 
ress. Nor, again, is the pupil’s grade half-way be- 
tween the two “scores.” If we bar out chance, 
which, of course, occasionally influences grades, the 
highest score or grade, while always above the 
learner’s ability at the moment, shows the di- 
rection in which he is moving and bears some 
relation to his rate of progress. The learner may 
not permanently reach the level of his best grade 
on the following day, but, if he works persistently, 
he will shortly approximate it and make it his own 
very soon, 
Ability to maintain a grade once attained is, of 
course, closely connected with the power to sustain 
‘uristions in a maximum degree of effort, and 
maximum effort the writer’s investigations have 
shown that this is impossible. The work may go 
so easily as to cause the learner to drop, perhaps 
unconsciously, into a state of relaxation and, again, 
the difftculty or monotony of the task may have the 
same effect.* Maximum effort, indeed, is a variable 
quantity in a given individual. The writer’s ex-

Swift, Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 1, p. 299.

PROGRESS IN LEARNING 113 
periments show frequent variation in “fitness” for 
the work in hand. Fatigue from any cause, bad 
air or high temperature in the room and emotional 
disturbance, such as excitement, lower the result 
of maximum effort if not the effort itself. Indeed, 
one’s “feelings” regarding one’s fitness are not al- 
ways reliable. The writer, to his great surprise, 
made an exceptionally low score in typewriting on 
a day when he felt unusually fit. A most interest- 
ing illustration of this was the case of one of the 
participants in the feat of tossing three balls into 
the air, catching each in turn as it descended, and 
tossing it up again before the others reached the 
hands. He had made seven hundred thirty catches 
on his fifth day and on the sixth he felt confident 
that he would reach his thousand mark. But, after 
starting, he was unable to control his muscles and, 
instead of gaining he fell to four hundred thirty- 
one. ‘What had been easy the day before was 
now done only with the greatest effort, and at the 
conclusion of the afternoon’s work, he was in an 
uncontrollable tremble.”* 
The effect of physical condition on progress was 
also observed by Miss Munn.t She found in her 
Bonin insane investigation that “one little girl 
of variations with a hard cold required as long 
to finish three trials as she had previously required

  114 LEARNING AND DOING 
to complete ten.” The most noticeable disturbance 
caused by the physical condition, she says, was in 
the nervousness which followed inability to do the 
work in quick time. Then, too, if the room was 
warm progress was much slower than usual; if too 
cold the same effect was observed. Fatigue, Miss 
Munn adds, had the same result. “After an after- 
noon spent almost entirely in drawing, the tests 
were taken and the weariness of the children in- 
fluenced the rate of progress greatly. Their interest 
in the doing of the tests was much less than it 
previously had been and the gains they made inter- 
ested them little. It was only with much coaxing 
and encouragement that they were able to be kept 
long enough to finish the tests.” In addition to 
times of more or less serious physical disability, 
there are also “off days” when one is not at his 
best. Without doubt this condition has its physio- 
logical basis but the causes can not always be de- 
tected. 
A “warming up” period is frequently necessary. 
A little introspection will convince adults of this 
“Warming up” in their own physical exercise and 
period mental work. A tennis player 
rarely does his best at the beginning of the game. It 
is true, the first ball may be well placed, but the rec- 
ord is not maintained until he has been playing a 
short time. A writer of much experience once said 
that he always “lost time” in beginning his work. 
This “warming up” when once accomplished may

sometimes be carried over at least a brief period of: 
inactivity. Indeed, an intermission is sometimes 
of assistance, though, as we shall find in the follow- 
ing chapter, intervening mental work of a different 
sort may be a disturbance. 
The question may be raised, however, whether 
the peculiarities in the learning curve, which we 
Alstudy of the have found, characterize all learn- 
learning process in ing. Perhaps school learning is 
ai business Houses 4m) ai class by itself. Indeed, one 
sometimes hears remarks to that effect. In order, 
therefore, to ascertain whether learners under other 
conditions exhibit the same irregularity the writer 
obtained the records of a price clerk and a copy 
clerk from a large wholesale hardware company. 
These records were taken at random and represent 
the rate of progress when the work was being 
learned. <A brief description of the nature of this 
work is, perhaps, desirable. 
The price clerk receives an order sheet, checks 
the selling price which the salesman has put down 
Description’ oF for the articles sold, looks up the 
methods of cost and enters the extension of 
pe sare the cost price. As an example of 
the number of a single article he may be obliged 
to look through before he becomes familiar with 
the price list, this hardware company lists over four 
hundred fifty hinges. Then, again, the customer 
may ask for a brass hinge which, with this company, 
is listed under “butts.” A beginner must, also, do

considerable mental or written reckoning. For ex- 
ample, one-twelfth of a dozen at nine dollars is sev- 
enty-five cents. As the clerk gains proficiency these 
fractional prices gradually become matters of mem- 
ory. Skill in finding the items in the price book is 
also to be acquired and the difficulty of this may be 
appreciated from the fact that the price book of 
the company from which the records were secured

The copy clerks copy invoices from order sheets

must gain sufficient familiarity with the items to 
be able to recognize them in all sorts of handwriting 
and abbreviations. 
It will be noticed at once that these curves have

the same general characteristics as the curves which 
Characteristics of Wete shown before. Irregularity 
curves of learning and one or more plateaus mark

oor whom these records were taken 
had all of the incentives to acquire skill rapidly 
which desire for success in a new position can 
bring to bear. Increase of salary and promotion 
are effective spurs to effort. 
Besides the causes of irregularity and retardation, 
to which reference has been made, monotony is 
Monotony a fac- always one of the resistances to 
tor in retardation be overcome in learning. In be- 
ginning a new study or new work of any sort the 
novelty awakens interest. At this stage, also, prog- 
ress is relatively rapid because the learner begins 
at the zero stage of knowledge in the subject and 
the preliminary information accumulates quickly. 
Very soon, however, this mass of loosely organized 
facts becomes a source of confusion and discour- 
agement and then the feeling of monotony is likely 
to dominate. All investigators of the learning proc- 
ess agree that sticcess and pleasure accompany each 
other. It is improbable that one of these two 
always precedes and causes the other. Either one 
may come first; but there is always interaction be- 
tween them, each tending to increase the other. The 
writer found in his experiments on adults that the 
desire to excel one’s own record as well as that 
of one’s coworkers, was often an incentive to betten
-P-A-G-E-137
  PROGRESS IN LEARNING 119 
work and that monotony was relieved at the same 
time. Similar observations have been made by 
Thorndike and Miss Munn in experiments with 
children. “The children were very anxious to know 
the progress they were making and how it com- 
pared with that of their friends.” “Encouragement,” 
Miss Munn says, “did much in raising the record 
and the trying to outdo their friends held the inter- 
est of the children and proved the best incentive 
to doing the work.’* Thorndike, in speaking of 
this, says that “the amount of improvement in this 
experiment” (which he had just made) “may also 
add to our confidence that the method of the prac- 
tice experiment wherein one works at one’s limit - 
and competes with one’s own past record, may well 
be made a feature in many school drills.” + 
The factors which enter into the learning process 
do not keep pace with one another. Progress is 
U by sections. In all of the experi- neven progress : y 
of the mental ments which the writer has made, 
Dee errors of one sort persisted after 
those of another kind had been largely eliminated. 
In other words, certain factors essential to success 
became fairly automatic in advance of others. 
Then, perhaps, no progress would be noticed in the 
first for a time and the backward ones would de- 
velop. Evidently, children should not be expected 
to make even progress in all of the mental processes

that make for proficiency in a given school sub- 
ject. In grammar, for example, the pupils may gain 
considerable skill in the use of adjective phrases 
and clauses while making no apparent progress in 
the more complex adverbial expressions. 
In all of the investigations which the writer has 
made the learners improved by coming upon better 
Unconscious ele. Ways of working without any 
ment in learning further conscious selection, at 
first, than the general effort to succeed. “The proc- 
ess is subconscious. The learner suddenly finds 
himself doing something of which he has not be- 
fore been aware. The new acquisition is well along, 
. however, before it is discovered.”* This uncon- 
scious improvement has since been verified by sev- 
eral investigators. On account of the importance 
of this factor in the learning process it may be 
well to quote from some of the later investigations. 
“A second significant fact about learning is that 
all adaptations and short-cuts in method were un- 
consciously made, that is, fallen into by the learners 
quite unconsciously on the good days while prac- 
tising under strain. The learners suddenly noticed 
that they were doing certain parts of the work in 
a new and better way, then purposely adopted it 
in the future.”+ Again, “a large percentage of the

fortunate variations came altogether unpremedi- 
tatedly,” is the way in which Ruger phrases it in 
his Psychology of Efficiency.* Finally, Louise Elli- 
son Ordahl found, in her study of Consciousness 
in Relation to Learning,} that methods changed and 
improvement appeared without conscious control. 
Unconscious modifications were continually crop- 
ping out. As consciousness was more and more 
freed from details these modifications were noticed. 
practised and improved upon. “Practice results in 
a standing out of the common features of the proc- 
ess; these are focalized and generalized into rules 
for new and better procedure, which immediately 
takes place.” 
Learning always involves the acquisition of cer- 
tain habits which vary’ with the nature of the thing 
farseresnucnrouchs that is being learned. In manual 
elimination of the feats of skill, for example, the 
yecrcss habits are muscular, chiefly arm 
and finger movements, while in such work as short- 
hand writing and typewriting, both muscular and 
mental habits are involved. In the latter instances 
the mental habits vary from the simple ones of be- 
ginners of focalizing the parts of each symbol, in 
the one case, and each letter, in the other, to the 
more economical habits of the expert who writes 
each symbol or letter automatically without focal- 
izing the elemental parts that enter into the sign.

  ee) LEARNING AND DOING 
The learning process at the beginning includes 
much that is useless and its gradual growth toward 
economy of effort consists in eliminating these acces- 
sories. In learning to write, for example, nervous 
currents go out through many muscles which have 
no place in writing. The child thrusts out his 
tongue, jerks his head and legs and, indeed, squirms 
with his whole body. This is not only uneconom- 
ical from the standpoint of securing results, it is 
also fatiguing. Learning aims at economy of effort. 
This is the explanation of the unconscious adoption 
of new and better ways of doing the thing one 
is practising, to which we have just referred. There 
is always a tendency to shorten the process—to 
eliminate what is unnecessary. The boy who is 
learning to write finally reaches the stage where he 
is not conscious of letters or even words. These 
have been cut out in the short-cut process, and the 
idea expressed by the sentence is sufficient to pro- 
duce all of the movements necessary to write the 
letters. 
In learning a new language the declensions and 
conjugations are finally cut out from the act of 
Higher and lower translating and the learner comes 
orders of habits to use nouns and verbs correctly 
without thinking of their endings or forms. Bryan 
and Harter have introduced the terms higher and 
lower orders of habits to describe these elemental 
and perfected ways of working, and the distinction
-P-A-G-E-141
  PROGRESS IN LEARNING 123 
is a good one. The lower-order habits are those 
of attention to details and these must become auto- 
matic before the attention is free to deal with the 
higher-order which efficiency requires. As long as 
a learner is obliged to give attention to the form and 
endings of words he will find it difficult to remem- 
ber what he has read or even to understand its 
meaning. This is the reason why we read a for- 
eign language slowly. Until we have become as 
proficient in the language as we are in our own 
we are obliged to give attention to forms of words 
and construction of sentences. 
Investigations have shown that there is always 
a tendency in beginners to drop back into the lower- 
order habits even after some Tendency to re- e 5 i 
turn to lower facility has been gained in the use 
order of habits = Gf the higher habits. The value 
of speed in preventing this and placing the learner 
permanently on the higher level is in some dispute. 
Book believes in pushing one’s self to the limit but 
Miss Munn* and Bairt found more errors with 
great effort at speed. There is no question, of 
course, that the learner should work vigorously, but 
this is quite different from straining to attain the 
greatest possible speed. With children, at any rate, 
it is doubtful whether continuous strain is wise on 
account of the nervousness that accompanies it.

  124 LEARNING AND DOING 
Nervousness is not usually attended with accuracy, 
and accuracy is vital to the attainment of efficient 
higher-order habits. 
Let us now pass to another phase of the psychol- 
ogy of learning. In commencing a new subject, 
Plateaus as peri: aS English grammar or Latin, be- 
ods of assimilation sinners, during the first few 
weeks, acquire a mass of information which must be 
so completely assimilated that its use becomes as 
automatic as the movements of balancing the body 
in walking. Now this requires time and, as a 
matter of fact, the information accumulates faster 
than it can be assimilated. During the time when - 
this information is being organized into usable 
knowledge and when definitions, rules, principles 
and, in languages, declensions and conjugations are 
becoming automatic, the learner seems to make no 
advance. The cause of these stationary periods in 
visible progress, which are called plateaus, in the 
opinion of the writer, is the need of time for assimi- 
lation and automatization.* They are periods when 
marks tell only a part of the truth. Though there 
is no visible advance, real progress, nevertheless, is 
going on in organizing the chaotic mass of facts 
and bits of disconnected information which the

-P-A-G-E-143
  PROGRESS IN LEARNING 125 
learner has acquired so that they may be used quickly 
and accurately. 
Miss Munn,* in her study of the learning proc- 
ess, came to this same conclusion. “But this period 
Views of other Of standstill is not truly one 
experimenters of no gain,” she says in sum- 
ming up, “for after these resting periods, as 
we may call them, great gains are frequently 
made and also kept. It seems as though we might 
call them periods of assimilation, for the accelera- 
tion which follows shows that some learning must 
have been going on or otherwise the sudden gains 
would not have ensued.” Cleveland, also, seems to 
have the same thought in mind when he says, in 
his study of the Psychology of Chess and of Learn- 
ing to Play It, that “the most important psychologi- 
cal feature in the learning of chess (and it seems 
equally true of all learning), is the progressive or- 
ganization of knowledge, making possible the direc- 
tion of the player’s attention to the relations of 
larger and more complex units. The organization 
involves generalization . . . and the multiplica- 
tion of associations; it insures prompter recall 
and increased potential meaning in the general 
concepts; it releases attention from details and 
favors consequent mental automatisms and _short- 
circuit processes. Thus alone is progress possible. 
Mental automatisms are usually perfected, one may

| 
conjecture, after advance to the next higher stage 
of learning.”* 
Book, on the other hand, believes that plateaus 
in the learning process “represent either a failure 
A different in attention and effort ... or 
explanation a period during which attention 
and effort are wrongly applied, where mistakes are 
multiplied and where subsequently the evil effects 
of practice in error are slowly overcome and right 
habits of attention and execution regained.” 
Miss Munn has proved the inadequacy of this 
explanation by showing that after these periods of 
no apparent progress “great gains are frequently 
made and also kept.” Why should the attention 
almost invariably select the moment for lapsing 
when the learner is on the point of making de- 
cided improvement? And, again, why should the 
attention on suddenly returning to its duty impart 
a skill greater than it gave during its former period 
of full activity before the cessation of progress? 
The improvement that follows the retardation must 
be accounted for, and the rapid rise of the curves 
after these plateaus indicates that some sort of 
mental organization and automatization has been 
going on during the interval of retardation in visi- 
ble progress. 
Finally, time is an important factor in the learn-

ing process. This is only another phase of the peri- 
: * ods of retardation which we have Time necessary 3 a ° 
for fixing just considered. Plateaus in 
serocauons learning are the mind’s protest 
against further cramming. Time is needed for the 
associations—and the nervous currents underlying 
them—to become fixed. We have the same fact 
illustrated in another way. Miiller and Pilzecker 
found* that if those who had learned a given as- 
signment turned their attention to something else 
immediately after committing the assignment to 
memory, the result was by no means so good as 
when they rested quietly for five or six minutes 
without thinking of anything in particular. It 
should be emphasized, however, that, during this 
brief intermission, the learners did not think about 
what they had just studied. Further, the closer 
one applies one’s self to a new task immediately 
after finishing a piece of work, the less of what 
one has learned will be remembered. The explan- 
ation, these investigators believe, may he something 
like the following. After studying a given assign- 
ment certain nervous processes which tend to 
strengthen the associations started by the act of 
learning, continue in force for a time, but with 
decreasing strength. In the opinion of the present 
writer, turning immediately to new work disturbs 
these nervous processes both by starting interfering 
currents and by draining off those which, if given

time, would establish the associations produced in 
learning the assignment. 
That nervous processes once associated througt 
an act of learning do actually become “set” during 
A memory cessation of practice has been 
experiment demonstrated by experiments of 
the writer on memory.* These memory tests were 
made in typewriting and ball-tossing. The first 
occurred two years and thirty-five days after the 
regular practice on the typewriter had ended. Dur- 
ing the interval the writer had not touched any 
style of typewriter until one week before the test 
of which we are now speaking, when he wrote a 
letter of about fifty words. The memory test in 
ball-tossing was taken six years and seventeen days 
after the conclusion of a series of experiments by 
which the skill was first acquired. 
In order that the significance of the memory 
curves may be clearer the original curves showing

ten in the latter. 
In ball-tossing, eleven days were needed to re- 
gain the skill which, in the earlier work, had re- 
quired forty-two days of practice. At the conclu- 
sion of this memory test the experimenter had 
attained a skill of sixteen hundred catches in ten 
misses, against ten hundred and fifty-one in the 
earlier work. That he actually had more skill than 
at the end of the practice of the first investigation 
was also indicated by the feeling of greater ease 
in making the score.* 
The facts in the psychology of learning which 
we have been considering have pedagogical signifi- 
cance to which we now turn.

NE of the advantages of studying the learn- 
ing process we have found to be the shifting 
of the teacher’s attention from the subjects of study 
AGtanedch ito to the pupils. For example, the 
teacher of study of ustial method of determining the 
learning process amount of work to be taken each 
day is to divide, as equitably as possible, what must 
be finished in the term. Studies in learning have 
shown, however, that there are days when children 
can accomplish many times as much as on other 
days. Sometimes this is caused by the physical 
condition of the children, but, again, it may be 
the result of the excitement of the day. So the 
teacher now makes the children his starting-point 
in determining the amount to be taken in the lesson 
and frequently, indeed, in deciding whether any 
studying at all may profitably be attempted. An 
illustration of the latter case is seen on days of 
football matches or when some other great excite- 
ment stirs the school. The children may, of course, 
be compelled to mark time in their books but it is 
often a question whether more progress would not 
ultimately be made if, at such a time, some other.

sort of work were done with sufficient interest in 
it to hold the pupils. 
This does not mean to change the order of the 
day for every childish whim, but economy in learn- 
; ing—which means securing the 
Relations of pupil best results in the course of the 
in economy of year—can not ignore the attitude learning aaa 5 i 
of hostility or friendliness of pu- 
pils toward their teachers and their work; and this 
attitude is determined by the feeling of the teacher 
toward the things which the children prize so highly, 
or, rather, by the feeling which the children think 
their teachers have. The latter is quite different 
from the former, as every teacher knows from his 
efforts to be understood. How, then, are the chil- 
dren to be convinced of the teacher’s friendliness? 
By giving the things which children take so seri- 
ously a place among the valued activities of the 
school, 
Standing in the court of educational method is 
granted rather grudgingly to children. A writer 
i Cunccmnineiaees in a recent number of the Af- 
ideas in education lantic Monthly* has said that 
“The firm old belief that the task is a valu- 
able asset in education, that the making of a 
good job out of a given piece of work is about 
the highest thing on earth, has lost its hold upon 
the world. . . . All knowledge, we are told, can 
be made so attractive—if only we have a very up-

134 LEARNING AND DOING 
to-date teacher—that children will absorb it with 
delight.” This way of arguing is strikingly sug- 
gestive of the Indian device for frightening an 
enemy. Before going on the war-path, they painted 
themselves in hideous colors so as to look as fierce 
as possible. To-day, those who would oppose a 
new idea paint it in gloomy tints and do not hesi- 
tate to distort its meaning if by so doing they can 
create alarm and produce a literary effect. 
There are only two possible courses according 
to the tacit assumption of writers such as we have 
Two methods of quoted. If children are to make 
getting results a good job out of a given piece 
of work they must be told to do it and then be 
held at the task until it is done. The other alter- 
native is to cajole the youthful tyrants into doing 
as much as possible and, when beguilement fails, 
to give them other work in the hope of finding 
something that will satisfy their royal pleasure. 
The latter plan, as we are led to think, is the 
method of the “very up-to-date teacher” and with 
it comes “our loss of nerve.” 
Now the present writer ventures to assert that 
a third way is open. First of all it should be re- 
membered that work may be pleas- 
ant without being easy. It is, of 
course, supremely important in educating children 
to train them to keep at a task until it is finished. 
There is no disagreement about this, but the prob- 
lem is how to accomplish it, The primitive way A third method
-P-A-G-E-153
  ECONOMY IN LEARNING 135 
was to order things done and to punish failure and 
disobedience. Teachers early adopted this method 
because it was approved by tradition and because 
at that time knowledge of child psychology was 
lacking. Now, however, we have learned that chil- 
dren can be made to want to do what we wish 
provided we know their ways of responding to given 
conditions. There is no special virtue in creating 
unnecessary friction merely to make children work 
against it. Habits of ethical, social conduct and of 
industry are what are wanted and when once these 
habits are established children are better prepared 
than before to resist temptations and to overcome 
obstacles. In practice we accept this principle by 
establishing public playgrounds to shield children 
from the temptations of the streets. If, however, 
we apply here the criticism of such writers as we 
have quoted we are causing “loss of nerve” by 
shielding these children from these moral perils 
instead of compelling them to conquer the dangers. 
The purpose in establishing public playgrounds 
is to create situations which shall save children from 
Tete temptations for which they are 
tween teacher not ready and, meanwhile, to 
sadicuud train them in habits of self-con- 
trol. Now if we interpret this for the schools it 
means that we ought to plan situations which shall 
protect pupils from the allurements of things and 
actions more seductive to them than study, while 
at the same time we are training them in habits 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  136 LEARNING AND DOING 
of attention and industry. In this way they are gain- 
ing the self-control that, later, will enable them to 
hold their own against persuasive attractions. This 
is done by applying the psychology of the group 
—the gang—and by utilizing the willingness of 
children to accept responsibility when it is put upon 
them. To get children into the habit of doing a 
given piece of work is what is wanted and if 
this habit can be produced by creating in them a 
feeling of friendliness to the school through recog- 
nition of their own activities and by helping them 
organize into groups to bring the spirit of the gang 
to the teacher’s side, the training in self-control and 
in industry has been well started. There is infinitely 
more moral and industrial value to the child in 
eagerness to undertake a difficult piece of work 
than in “unwilling study,” and the teacher who can 
produce this eagerness has succeeded far ahead of 
him who commands and drives. Would any one 
maintain that the school in which the teacher holds 
the children to their tasks by fear of penalties is 
superior to the one in which the pupils study from 
the joy of contributing something to a common 
cause, or that the habits gained in unwilling study 
are a more valuable asset than those acquired 
through joy in work? Is not one of the problems 
of the school to teach children to want to study, 
to enjoy history, literature and science so that they 
may wish to pursue each further when they have 
left the school?
-P-A-G-E-155
  
ECONOMY IN LEARNING 137 
We have been trying to show that the coopera- 
tion of children in furthering their education should 
be the aim and that the value of their training 
is greatly enhanced and its permanency better se- 
cured by entering into an alliance with their racial 
instincts and native interests. This includes not 
merely the instinct of workmanship, powerfully en- 
trenched as it is in the life of the race, but also 
the instinct of play, the moments of intense enthusi- 
asm for the free, wild life of action in other things 
than studies. Recognition of these interests on the 
occasional days when events of temporarily supreme 
importance bring them to the front unites the in- 
terests of teachers and pupils and, in the course 
of the year, greatly increases the efficiency of the 
work. 
Undivided attention to the work in hand is what 
counts and there are days when children can not 
Piece of mental give it. To attempt at such a4 
attitude time to hold them to their books 
is but to break the incipient habits of study which 
have been weeks in starting. One of the rules for 
breaking bad habits is not to permit a single fall 
from grace. This is, of course, impossible with 
children, and teachers, in their enthusiasm, may 
place the pupils in such conditions that failure is 
practically certain. By recognizing these facts and 
studying the needs of the pupils one may, on the 
other hand, not only promote habits of study but 
also create the feeling of good will which is essential

to. progress in the work. For all investigations 
have shown that the attitude of the learner toward 
his task is vital to success. This attitude influences 
the height of the curve. Children who are not 
well disposed toward their teacher and the school 
will never do their best. They will have their ups 
and downs, just as do the others, but the highest 
point attained will not be commensurate with their 
abilities, 
The experiments given in the third chapter are

group sentiment Their success was due to their 
appeal to the children’s point of view. They offered 
new ‘activities which the children themselves could 
manage and so this organized pupil-work set 
up rival interests, interests quite as absorbing in 
certain respects as the outdoor sports and which, 
at the same time, stimulated progress in the studies. 
In addition, these methods of enlisting the help of 
the pupils appeal to the instinct of group action

lalways easier to guide the interests of groups of 
‘children than to manage individuals. This is an 
important fact in school management. The teacher 
should plan to produce a group sentiment of indus- 
try and loyalty and mutual helpfulness. But the 
less he uses these words the better. Boys abom- 
inate cant and sentimentality, and the repetition of 
platitudes is more likely to cause mirth than serious

thought. Whether they do or do not will depend 
on whether the feeling, of which we have been 
speaking, pervades the school; and so, at all events, 
the development of a feeling of good will through 
action instead of words is the first requirement. 
Everything that various writers have said about 
the “gang” applies here.* The leader of the boys 
is, of course, to be discovered and Importance of 
winning leader of won. He is the one through 
theigang whom suggestions may be spread 
quickly among the pupils. He is proud of his 
position of influence among his fellows and this 
feeling of superiority is his vulnerable point. What 
method is to be employed in winning him? Human 
nature is too variable for specific rules, but such 
boys always like to have their opinion asked, and 
if the teacher can get them to do him a favor 
they are usually his allies in the future. It is 
difficult for any one who has helped you once to 
turn against you. But the teacher must always 
be frank and open in dealing with the leader, as 
indeed with all of his pupils. Everything “on the 
square’ is essential to success in the schoolroom 
as everywhere else. It is amazing how the leader, 
and through him the others, respond to friendly 
criticism when once the “gang spirit” has been run 
into channels for turning the wheels of the school 
activities. The feeling of group solidarity is per- 
haps the strongest force in boys, and its utilization

in creating the good feeling which promotes work 
is proof of teaching ability. 
We have been speaking of boys because the prob- 
lems of discipline and efficient work usually center 
Comparison of in them. Girls are less aggressive 
boys and girls = and more imitative. If the boys 
are won the girls quite readily adapt themselves to 
the situation. The only exception is a girl who 
stands out conspicuously as a leader. In such a 
case her support must, of course, be gained. The 
motives put before her will frequently differ from 
those which are effective with boys. Probably the 
incentives to action should be more personal. With 
both boys and girls recognition of the racial crav- 
ing for activities which the children themselves con- 
trol, observance of their desire to participate at 
times in something tinged with the zest of adven- 
ture, and thoughtfulness of the danger of monoto- 
ny, will do much toward diffusing a stimulating 
emotional atmosphere throughout the room. 
This general attitude is disclosed in what may 
be called the spirit of the school and the thought- 
The spirit of ful teacher now studies his chil- 
the school dren to discover the effect of 
each environmental factor, and this includes con- 
ditions of the home as well as circumstances and 
events in school. The progress of learners in their 
studies has been found unexpectedly sensitive to 
external conditions as well as to the physiological 
and mental condition of the children. Every teacher
-P-A-G-E-159
  ECONOMY IN LEARNING 141 
is trying, of course, to get results—to produce such 
conditions as will help his pupils to make the best 
progress—and the study of the learning process, 
together with all of the conditions which affect it, 
aids him in this endeavor. 
We have been speaking of the general attitude 
of pupils, which affects the learning curve of the 
entire school. It remains to show the influence of 
temporary states of mind or body on individuals. 
The writer, throughout his experiments, found 
the feelings and physical condition of the learners 
to be essential to progress. They 
Eee ia were the fundamental require- 
and mental condi- ment of efficiency. Book* says, tion of learner y ; ; aoe 
concerning this, that in his inves- 
tigations the “correlation between the learner’s gen- 
eral affective tone or attitude and the fluctuations 
in attention and effort was so close that if one had 
a complete and accurate record of the changes that 
occurred in the former, one would have an accurate 
criterion of (the learner’s) progress and efficiency. 
The learner’s mental attitude and general tone of 
feeling was a true index of his progress and ability 
to do.” “The feelings and the failure of attention,” 
again, “were clearly joint effects of certain health 
conditions” and “the influence of the learner’s gen- 
eral physiological condition on (feeling and suc- 
cess) can hardly be overemphasized.” When in 
good physical condition and working vigorously, 
* Loc. cit. p. 149
-P-A-G-E-160
  142 LEARNING AND DOING 
the writer’s experiments, as we have seen, show 
that the learner adopts new ways and modifies his 
mode of procedure without knowing that he is 
doing it. After the change is made he finds that 
he is following a better method and then he con- 
sciously approves and continues it. But this un- 
conscious utilization of better ways occurs only 
when the learner has zeal for his work; and zeal, 
though it may not always accompany emotional 
and physical good feeling, rarely exists without it. 
These observations about adults apply equally 
well to the schoolroom. If a child is not physi- 
cally “fit,’ keeping him at his work does little 
more than strengthen habits of inattention and 
nullify previous training by multiplying errors. 
The child actually loses ground on account of the 
occurrence of numberless errors which, as incipient 
habits, start interfering movements or ideas on fol- 
lowing days. These errors are so many new re- 
sistances to be overcome when the child is in better 
trim. Every wrong association sets up an inter- 
ference with the one that is right, and the more 
numerous the errors the greater the odds against 
the right ideas being brought into the mind through ~ 
associative processes. The working of association 
is, after all, not very different from that of mechan- 
ical forces. Like the latter the various nervous cur- 
rents which underlie the association of ideas follow 
paths of least resistance and it frequently requires
-P-A-G-E-161
  ECONOMY IN LEARNING 143 
but little to divert the course of a gently flowing 
stream. To be more specific, we know how difficult 
it often is for even adults to spell a word correctly 
after hearing several incorrect suggestions. 
But there is still another way in which emo- 
tional and physical unfitness make execution bad. 
f If the beginner has acquired 
physical unfitness some facility in habits of a higher 
sion to lower or- order he now drops back into ele- der of habits mental modes of work. Suppose, 
for example, a pupil in Latin has acquired some 
little skill in sight translation. This, of course, 
involves the beginnings of complex habits which, 
at their best, give evidence of a high degree of 
efficiency. The learner now sees the meaning of 
entire sentences without analyzing their parts or 
thinking in terms of case endings. On days of 
physical indisposition he will be reduced to the word 
method of the earlier stage. Or, again, if a child 
has learned to work in mental arithmetic he will 
be compelled at such a time to write out the solu- 
tion of his problems because he can not hold the 
figures in his mind; and with it all mistakes will 
be common. 
Economy in learning, as in all production, in- 
volves the quality, quantity and cost of the output, 
Economy in and physical or mental unfitness 
learning gives a limited quantity of infe- 
rior goods at a high cost. The increased expense 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  144 LEARNING AND DOING 
of production is caused by the bad condition of the 
machinery that does the work. The problem of 
the teacher here is much the same as that of a 
manager of a business house. When a leakage is 
discovered find the cause and stop it. In the pres- 
ent instance the state of the body and mind pro- 
duces inattention, multiplies errors and reduces the 
pupils to elemental stages of learning. This reduces 
the output for the day. In addition, it injures the 
mental machinery by strengthening habits of inat- 
tention, by starting interfering nervous currents, on 
account of the errors made, and by perpetuating the 
lower-order habits of work. Recognition of chil- 
dren’s mental and physical ailments avoids this 
waste and, besides, creates the general feeling of 
good will of which we spoke in the beginning. In 
other words, it produces the condition which experi- 
ments have shown to be necessary for mental effici- 
ency. It were better to be deceived sometimes than 
give the impression of unconcern for those in trou- 
ble. When, however, the feeling of good will pre- 
vails, deception is in less favor. The children are 
likely to take care of that as we have found them 
resentful of other sorts of indolence. Successful 
shirkers are popular only in schools made up of 
two camps—the pupils and teacher—each in a 
state of armed truce and both watchful of each 
other. 
This is not a plea for less work but for more 
efficient use of time. Greater advantage should be
-P-A-G-E-163
  ECONOMY IN LEARNING 145 
AU plesion more taken of the periods following the 
efficient use of “warming up.” This delay in 
piyeiological getting started is an unavoidable 
explanation factor in beginning the day’s 
work in any subject. It probably consists, in part, 
in connecting the thoughts of the previous day 
as far as they enter into the task of the moment, 
and in part, in switching nervous currents into new 
channels. There is a complete break between geog- 
raphy and arithmetic. The learner must, so to 
speak, stop mental action and make a new start, 
and starting always requires overcoming resistance. 
Tashiro* has shown that “a resting nerve gives off 
a definite quantity of carbon dioxide,” that “stimu- 
lation increases CO2 production” and that “COz2 
production from the resting nerve proportionately 
decreases as irritability diminishes. These facts 
prove directly that the nerve continuously under- 
goes chemical changes and that nervous irritability 
is directly connected with a chemical phenomenon.” 
Since carbon dioxide is the result of oxidation, 
a series of these oxidation phenomena would cause 
an explosion wave. We may suppose the available 
energy to depend upon the number of these ex- 
plosion waves per second. Reasoning then by anal- 
ogy from the results of chemical action with which 
we are familiar, a certain number of explosion 
waves must appear per second to make voluntary 
attention possible, and the closer the concentration

-P-A-G-E-164
  146 LEARNING AND DOING 
the greater the number within a given time. A 
high degree of efficiency in study and thought will 
be accompanied then by a correspondingly rapid 
succession of explosion waves. By analogy, again, 
we may venture to say that the delay required in 
similar cases, with which we are better acquainted, 
is also needed here to produce the requisite rapidity 
in successive explosions. 
Efficiency, then, would seem to require that the 
number of these delays be as few as possible. Why 
A suggestion for should not the daily program be 
getting results varied when the interest of the 
class suggests the wisdom of the change? Results 
are wanted and the time to mold the mind and 
impress ideas is when the enthusiasm of the chil- 
dren is at white heat. Stopping the recitation at 
a vital point when the pupils are keen to follow the 
thought to the end is a common experience with 
all teachers; and the next day the alertness is gone 
and half of the period must be used in working 
up the interest again, only to leave it unsatisfied 
at another critical moment. 
I am aware that continuing the work at times 
beyond the hour would disturb the regularity of 
Utilization of the classes but, again, I venture 
enthusiasm to say that we are after results. 
The irregularity would even up because the cir- 
cumstances would not always require extending the 
period with the same class. Besides, this plan would 
stimulate the pupils to inquiry and reading outside
-P-A-G-E-165
  
ECONOMY IN LEARNING 147 
the school. A certain point in the development of 
a topic must be reached before the children are 
anxious to investigate a little for themselves, and 
dismissing classes by the clock ignores the growth 
of the subject under discussion and the enthusiasm 
aroused. Critical moments, when the mental tem- 
perature is high, are not the times to dismiss classes 
if efficiency is the aim. When, on the other hand, 
the interest has waned or the children begin to 
show signs of fatigue, class work is unprofitable. 
The pupils should then be given different work or 
progress is delayed and dislike for the study en- 
gendered. This plan would also help to conserve 
the feeling of good will to which we have referred, 
because it would tend to foster the feeling of pleas- 
ure which we have found invariably associated with 
effective work. Taking enthusiasms into account 
always promotes pleasure and good will. 
But the influence of the emotions on the learn- 
ing process does not end here. Ruger found* two 
Other hindrances forms of personal attitude—both 
to learning emotional—inimical to success in 
a problem presented for solution. These are the 
attitude of feeling that one knows the answer and 
that of self-attention. Both of these emotional 
states, as Ruger’s investigations show, prevent the 
attention from attacking the problem directly and 
without prejudice. Those who have not acquired 
the scientific habit of examining a problem before

  148 LEARNING AND DOING 
drawing conclusions, and of holding these conclu- 
sions tentatively even after examination has sug- 
gested them, have yet to learn the first principle 
of investigation. Freedom of mind is essential to 
productive study, it matters not how elementary the 
problem. Take, for example, the question, Why 
is St. Louis a large city? The children may have 
learned that a large navigable river tends to build 
up a large city. If, however, they attack the ques- 
tion on that supposition they will go far astray, be- 
cause at present the Mississippi is a comparatively 
unimportant factor in the growth of St. Louis. 
Ruger observed that those with whom he worked 
immediately made assumptions about the nature of 
the problem and that they held 
them more or less in mind dur- 
ing the work, to the serious detriment of their 
progress. These assumptions, often accidentally 
established in the mind, became thoroughly en- 
trenched, Ruger says, without being subjected to 
criticism. His iearners watched for a cue or the 
first glance suggested a particular way of stating 
the problem or of defining the plan of solution 
without any active search for other ways of looking 
at the matter or any criticism of the method ac- 
cepted. “In general, the solutions were not the 
result of mere straightaway thinking and the con- 
sequent formulation of a thoroughgoing plan of 
action, but were the outcome of an extremely com- An experiment

plex interrelation of more or less random impulses 
and ideas.” 
Children are prone to jump at conclusions. They 
seize as the answer to the question the first idea 
niiporancerce that comes to them from their 
encouraging past work. The teacher’s plan of 
dicen on education should demand exami- 
nation of the problem before any conclusions are 
drawn and the children should be taught to think 
of possible solutions as questions for further ex- 
amination in the light of the conditions and sug- 
gestions of the problem, rather than as answers 
immediately to be accepted. This is the method 
of elimination by which the possible solutions are 
gradually reduced in number as one after another 
is eliminated from consideration until, finally, 
only one or two remain. This is thinking. 
It requires more time at the beginning but 
in the end it saves time because the pupils 
learn self-reliance by gaining power to study out 
solutions for themselves. Besides, the recitation 
advances beyond the guessing game which chil- 
dren are prone to make it until they find that such 
answers will not be accepted. A class is what the 
teacher makes it. The children adapt themselves 
to the conditions with which he surrounds them and 
they will do just as loose or accurate thinking as 
these conditions demand. But the method must 
be used daily and relentlessly. This continued, se-

vere insistence upon the scientific method of thought 
in simple as well as in complex problems is what 
Rousseau seems to have meant when he said: “May 
I venture to state here the greatest, the most im- 
portant, the most useful rule in all education? It 
is not to gain time, but to lose it.” 
Some of the assumptions which interfered with 
the solution of his puzzle-problems Ruger has said 
The unconscious 270Se in the minds of the learners 
factor in the without their knowledge and be- 
learning process came established before they were 
subjected to criticism. This is an observation in 
a particular instance of what is probably a general 
fact in learning. Many of our methods of secur- 
ing results in any field are unconsciously acquired 
even when we are under guidance, and if untutored 
practically all are gained in this way. Our study 
of the psychology of learning has shown agreement 
among investigators on the unconscious adoption 
of short-cuts and other devices for hastening re- 
sults. Let us now examine the pedagogical signi- 
ficance of this. 
First of all, it is clear that, if left to themselves, 
children are liable to acquire uneconomical habits 
The right mo- of work. Again, there is grave 
ment to help danger of over-help. Indeed, 
Goya many are convinced that to-day 
cliildren receive too much assistance. What then 
is the solution of our problem? When should help 
be given? The investigations in learning have
-P-A-G-E-169
  ECONOMY IN LEARNING 151 
answered the question. Suggestions are most valu- 
able at the moment when the learner has hit on 
a new way of meeting a difficulty. If he is not 
yet aware of it, i. e., if the new method is still 
in the unconscious stage, it may be pointed out and 
its advantages or disadvantages made clear. A 
learner is not interested in solving a difficulty be- 
fore he meets it. Why should he be when he does 
not know that he will ever encounter it? This 
is human nature, especially child nature. We are 
not interested in what we are wholly ignorant of; 
and a difficulty of the future is of this sort. But 
if children care to gain some skill in what they are 
engaged on, the moment that they become conscious 
of an obstacle in their way they are alert to any 
successful plan of overcoming it. If help is given 
too soon, the child goes on his way only partially ac- 
quainted with the difficulty. Indeed, he may hardly 
know that it is in his way. He has not yet met 
it or tried to meet it, either successfully or unsuc- 
cessfully. If, on the other hand, he actually strug- 
gles with the situation, for at least a brief time, 
he has learned to know it. He then appreciates 
the better way suggested because he has tried his 
hand and only partially succeeded and he knows 
what the new method does and why it does it. 
His partial failure was really of advantage because 
he now learns to be critical of plans of work. The 
trial and error method, as used here, is valuable 
up to a certain point because partial success or com-
-P-A-G-E-170
  152 LEARNING AND DOING 
plete failure confronts the learner with the diffi- 
culty. But he should be shown the better way be- 
fore he has acquired uneconomical habits of ex- 
ecution. 
One need not look far for illustrations of what 
we have been saying. In learning to write, chil- 
dren unconsciously assume posi- 
tions of body, arm and fingers 
which, to a certain degree, meet the needs of the 
situation. They do not consciously select these po- 
sitions and they do not subject them to criticism 
before their defects are called to their attention. 
In this particular case it is probably of little im- 
portance whether they are started right or whether 
they are allowed to try their own varied ways of 
doing the work long enough to become conscious 
of their awkwardness before the disadvantage of 
these positions is pointed out. In arithmetic, how- 
ever, the wisdom of a little delay in suggesting 
methods becomes apparent. Some of the children 
at the beginning will write everything down and 
use their fingers in adding. Others will do some 
of the simpler processes mentally, putting only the 
results on paper. The latter will, of course, finish 
long before the others. No one wishes to do un- 
necessary work, and besides, children are anxious 
to equal or excel their associates. After the slower 
ones have discovered that their methods do not get 
results is, therefore, the psychological moment to 
show them the better way. In foreign languages, Illustrations
-P-A-G-E-171
  ECONOMY IN LEARNING 153 
again, the application of the principle is evident. 
Learners try to meet the same situation in different 
ways. Some thumb their vocabulary for each word 
in the order in which it comes. A few look up all 
of the words in a paragraph and write the mean- 
ings down, regardless of the sense. A day or two 
is enough to prepare these children to appreciate 
suggestions for a better plan of work. Those who 
take the words in succession find that the author 
of their book did not think in the English order 
and the others discover to their surprise that only 
one of the many English words fits the context or 
even that the vocabulary contains no equivalent for 
the thought. Now they see the problem and their 
desire to hasten the preparation of their lesson, if 
no higher motive operates, makes them receptive 
to suggestions. Then, when they are told that by 
reading a paragraph thoughtfully, half a dozen 
times in the original language, they will “feel” the 
meaning of certain words as well as their relation 
to one another, and that soon they will find it un- 
necessary to look up all the words in their vocabu- 
lary, they do not resist the suggestion because no 
one wishes to take unnecessary trouble. 
Elemental habits must be mastered first of all. 
Declensions, conjugations, rules in grammar and 
F tables in arithmetic must become Overlapping of 3 ; 
higher and lower automatic. But before this hap- 
orderstol Rabie pens the observant teacher will 
see that habits of a higher order are making their   
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  154 LEARNING AND DOING 
appearance. Some of the children will “feel” the 
meaning and construction without certainty of the 
reasons. But there is always a tendency to drop 
back into more elemental ways of working. Chil- 
dren who have acquired a little facility in reading - 
sentences in a foreign language without consulting 
the vocabulary are prone to reduce their work to 
translating words instead of thoughts. Care is 
needed here to keep the pupils up to the higher 
order of habits while continuing the drill for mas- 
tery of the lower. There is a kind of struggle for 
existence, for self-assertion, among habits and the 
economical ones should be helped to prevail. Ele- 
mental habits must finally be replaced by habits of 
a higher order or the child continues on a low level 
of efficiency. In English grammar the pupil must 
learn to “feel” the relation of parts of a thought 
to one another without picturing words and dia- 
grams. For this reason the use of diagrams should 
not be too persistent or too long continued. In 
Latin and German, again, a “good form” of exe- 
cution has not been attained until the pupil can 
translate simple sentences, after reading them in 
the original, without a dictionary. 
There are interfering associations among ideas 
just as there are interfering movements in muscu- 
Encouragement of lar activity but these are grad- 
individuality ually eliminated as efficient asso- 
ciations become automatized. The elimination of 
associations unprofitable from the point of view of

present need is usually an unconscious process un- 
less an instructor is at hand to suggest a better 
way. Teachers should always be watchful for 
short-cuts. The learner naturally adopts them and 
they should be encouraged. They represent the 
pupil’s personal reaction to the problems. This is 
economy of method; and beyond this, the writer 
has already called attention to the fact that there 
is no one universally efficient way of approaching 
and solving a problem.* Each child has his own 
point of view and his manner of approach expresses 
his thought just as our own represent ours. As 
long as a pupil is logical his method is as cor- 
rect as any other and if he finds a shorter process 
so much the better. He should be praised for his 
clearer vision. Adults are too prone to force their 
methods on the young and in so doing they stifle 
originality and crush interest. The importance of 
taking into account individual differences in ways 
of thinking has also been emphasized by Meyer- 
hardt.t Compelling children to adopt another 
method than their own before they have thoroughly 
mastered the latter starts interfering associations 
of which we were speaking.

children, that “ideas previously in the mind and 
Cause of interfer- association forms of ideas are 
ing associations = factors in causing the confusion 
of the memory image and its final loss.” Berg- 
strom established the same fact in another way.* 
He tested students in sorting cards, first according 
to one order and then according to another. The 
second sorting, in a different order, required more 
time than the first and a greater number of errors 
was made. Evidently the associations formed the 
first time interfered with the rapidity and accuracy 
of the second series. “It is a mechanical struggle 
of habits,” is the way in which Bergstrom puts 
it. Interference of associations was also observed 
by the writer in his experiments, and by Book in 
typewriting.t The importance of this for teachers 
is obvious. Incorrect answers establish interfering 
associations. Sometimes, in the effort to show why 
an answer is wrong it is emphasized to such an 
extent that its associative recurrence is a practical 
certainty. Then memory surrounds it with such 
semblance of truthfulness that its validity to the 
child is assured. Incorrect English, false syn- 
tax intended for correction, also violate the prin- 
ciple that when children are getting their bearings 
in the various subjects of study, as in the ele-

mentary school, it is of the utmost importance that, 
as far as possible, only true statements be made. 
When wrong answers are given they should not 
be stressed. 
In our study of progress in learning we found 
that beginners advance by sections. Certain habits 
Importance of of execution improve for a time 
nascent habits more rapidly than others. Per- 
haps, indeed, some habits will not seem to make 
any progress at all toward automatization. The 
inclination of the teacher is to ignore temporarily 
the habits which are gaining and to spend all of 
the time in trying to bring the others up so that 
the pupil may present an even front. This is an 
uneconomical procedure. Following nature is an 
old phrase which has never had the same meaning 
for different advocates, but if this vague expression 
has any intelligible meaning it is that the momen- 
tary bent of the child should be utilized and pushed 
to the limit. Probably the correct method is to 
urge the forward habits to complete automatization 
but, at the same time, not wholly to neglect the 
others. The reason for the latter action is that 
otherwise the teacher does not know when another 
habit is beginning to grip the pupil and he must 
be ready to aid its growth the moment it appears. 
Besides, moderate drill in a habit not yet nascent 
is the incentive for its start. Without any stimulus 
it would have no reason for beginning. A child
-P-A-G-E-176
  
158 LEARNING AND DOING 
should not be expected, however, to present an even 
front as he advances. This same psychological 
principle of unevenness in development is seen in 
the so-called nascent periods for reading, drawing, 
debating, and the scientific interests of various 
kinds. They come at different times, and each, 
for the moment, fills the child’s whole mind. Of 
course an interest does not always reveal itself in 
the same way in different children. Its particular 
form or, indeed, whether it shall appear at all, de- 
pends on the environment. Interests require stim- 
uli to draw them out. Next to supplying these 
incentives, then, the important thing is to utilize 
nascent interests to the full for growth when they do 
appear. And it is the same with the habits of execu- 
tion of which we were speaking. Stress to the ut- 
most those that are in growth and, meanwhile, coax 
the others out with enticing stimuli. The subtle in- 
fluence of the school environment here as elsewhere 
is the guiding, if not controlling, force. 
Plateaus in the learning curve are but another 
instance of the unevenness of progress. The differ-

Serr cit or marks indicate. As has been 
said, however, it is a case where marks do not 
show the facts. The rapid rise that follows pla- 
teaus makes it clear that the periods of apparent 
cessation of progress are very active moments. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  ECONOMY IN LEARNING 159 
The pupil has been gathering information and ap- 
plying it as best he could, but now he is overloaded 
and the mind is in danger of being clogged. Pla- 
teaus are the mind’s protest against being over- 
loaded. Much of the pupil’s information must be 
so thoroughly assimilated that its application be- 
comes automatic, if the confusion is to be clarified. 
One need only think of the rules of English gram- 
mar with so many exceptions and variations that 
the rules almost cease to exist, and of the puzzling 
complexities of foreign constructions and idioms, 
to realize the exasperating disorder that fills the 
minds of young children.

the usual run of school children. There were sev- 
eral better pupils in the class whose curve of prog- 
ress did not go so low as did this girl’s, and there 
were two who reached a lower level but did not 
rise. They are the ones who must repeat the work.

The curve shows that this pupil, beginning with 
a grade of sixty, advanced during the first three 
Description days to seventy and then dropped, 
of curve with only one intervening rise, 
to a grade of twenty. At that time steady work 
began to show results and her marks improved, 
with occasional recessions, until her standing was 
ninety-eight. Her teacher says that the child now 
seems to be permanently somewhere between eighty-
-P-A-G-E-179
  ECONOMY IN LEARNING 161 
five and one hundred. The curve differs in details, 
as those of individuals always do, but in its es- 
sential characteristics it is the same as the others 
we have shown. In this, as in the other curves, 
progress is discontinuous and there are days when 
no marked advance or recession is made. The elev- 
enth and twelfth days and all after the seventeenth 
illustrate these plateau periods, 
The time finally comes when the nervous cur- 
rents, drawn one way and another by conflicting 
Confusion associated ideas and blocked by 
of ideas interferences set up by the unor- 
ganized mass of thoughts, refuse to run true. The 
conflicting ideas and confused thoughts include 
what the children have learned and have been told 
about the innumerable exceptions, variations and 
modifications of declensions, conjugations, rules, 
and idioms that come under no rule. All of them 
have their associations, some in agreement and some 
in apparent disagreement with one another. And 
this tangle of disagreement must be straightened 
out and everything brought into order. The long 
drop of the curve of progress of the grammar- 
school girl, given before, represents just such a 
condition of mental confusion. Work and time, 
the latter no less than the former, are needed to 
bring order out of the chaotic accumulation of 
facts. 
Clearly this is no time for tests or examinations. 
Marks have no grading-value, Their use just now
-P-A-G-E-180
    
162 LEARNING AND DOING 
The use of tests is to guide the teacher in her se- 
at this time lection of topics for drill and for 
further explanation, and to show the progress of 
the automatization of forms and rules and prin- 
ciples. Tests may be given but they should be re- 
garded as merely written exercises and after the 
papers have been corrected and returned the marks 
should be discarded. The reason for returning the 
papers to the class is that competition with one’s 
own record and with one’s fellows is an incentive 
for better work. Several writers, as we have seen, 
have observed this in their investigations. 
Plateaus in the learning process, of which we 
have been speaking, are like the block signals on 
Plateaus a signal @ tailroad. They give warning 
for special drill of the danger of going ahead. 
Now is the time for renewed drill on everything 
that relates to the work. In arithmetic, the teacher 
should return to the place at which the clear ac- 
curate knowledge of the children ends and make 
that the starting-point for vigorous and intelligent 
drill. In English grammar, the rules should be 
reviewed, exceptions and modifications made clear, 
but always with endless drill, and with innumerable 
examples, each pointed at a principle. And, again, 
in Latin, declensions, conjugations, rules with illus- 
trative examples, and idiomatic sentences committed 
to memory, all must be revived with ceaseless drill. 
Naturally, with such continuous, relentless drill 
there is grave danger of monotony, and monotony
-P-A-G-E-181
ECONOMY IN LEARNING 163 
Effect of monotony has been found a potent influence 
on plateaus in prolonging plateaus. But as 
long as delay in progress is caused chiefly by dis- 
order in the mind, the treatment is clearly indi- 
cated. The disorderly ideas must be brought into 
subordination. Economic habits of execution which 
constitute “good form” must be perfected. Declen- 
sions, conjugations, rules and principles in mathe- 
matics, languages and sciences must be so com- 
pletely assimilated that their appearance at the right 
moment is as automatic as the boy’s jump at sight 
of an object falling toward him through the air. 
This leaves the attention free for larger questions, 
for the higher order of habits to which reference 
was made in the chapter on progress in learning. 
The situation is wholly altered if monotony ob- 
tains a hold. The delay in progress may then be ab- 
Stuecestionsito normally prolonged. The teacher 
offset monotony should prevent this at all hazard. 
It is the opportunity to use her ingenuity. While 
there should be no advance, the work should be 
entirely new. Fresh problems in arithmetic should 
be gathered from many books and, after being 
solved, they may be compared with others with 
which the children are familiar to “set” the prin- 
ciple; and so with English grammar. In German 
and Latin new stories should be read but always 
with the drill upon the facts and principles con- 
cerning which the pupils are confused. This va- 
riety of material, besides driving away monotony, 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  164 LEARNING AND DOING 
makes the children flexible in thought. They see 
the same principle applied in cases that are alike, 
yet different, and so they learn to compare and 
judge and think, instead of forming mechanical 
habits of thought which permit no variation. This 
mental flexibility is what I understand Rousseau 
to have meant when he said in his paradoxical way, 
“The only habit a child should be allowed to form 
is to contract no habits whatever.” 
Finally, time is needed in the learning process. 
This is but another point of view of the subcon- 
t scious utilization of experience Time a factor 3 5 in growth of and of plateaus. Learning is a 
(aes gradual growth toward economy 
of effort in accomplishing that upon which one is 
engaged. Let us see how this growth proceeds, 
Every task, whether mental or manual, is a com. 
plex of lesser achievements which contribute to thi 
whole. And it is these contributory factors—the 
problems or situations which must be met at each 
moment in the progress of the work—that serve 
as stimuli for appropriate muscular movements or 
thoughts, according as manual dexterity or mental 
skill is required. At first the learner inadequately 
meets the situation. As we have seen, the method 
is that of trial and error. By degrees the useless 
and less effective reactions are eliminated and some 
measure of success is achieved. Many of the bet- 
ter methods are acquired unconsciously, as we have 
found, and are well along in use before the learner  
-P-A-G-E-183
    
ECONOMY IN LEARNING 105 
notes them. Now all this growth in economy of 
effort requires time because the associative recur- 
rence of a definite order of nervous discharges must 
be established. Hastening progress by showing the 
learner how to do the work ignores the laws of 
growth and reduces him to the stage of imitation. 
It stifles the desire to initiate action which is the 
beginning of originality. Learning by imitation 
subverts learning by doing. Suggestions too long 
deferred, on the other hand, give time for bad 
habits of execution to become fixed. The success- 
ful teacher watches for the moment when the pupil, 
conscious that his method is not securing the best 
results, looks for help. Ability to know the eco- 
nomic moment distinguishes superior teaching.

CHAPTER VI 
HABIT IN LEARNING AND ACHIEVEMENT 
T was Walter Pater, I think, who said that form- 
ing habits is failure in life; “for, after all,” he 
continued, “habit is relative to a stereotyped world, 
and meantime it is only the roughness of the eye that 
makes any two persons, things, or situations, seem 
alike.” 
Habits of thought start in our environment. Men 
are born into certain classifications of ideas. They 
Our inherited are orthodox or unorthodox, con- 
view-point servative or radical from birth. 
Of course, I do not mean that these ideas are innate, 
though they might almost as well be, for the very 
atmosphere which the child breathes is surcharged 
with them. Naturally, these points of view become 
the customary ones and the ideas within the field 
of the observer’s vision come to have definite, fixed 
relations to one another. It is as if a series of moun- 
tain peaks were always seen from a river seat, with 
no alteration in the relative positions which they 
hold. Take those who have had only this view out 
into a meadow with all the peaks in sight and they 
can not discover an intelligible arrangement in the 
166
-P-A-G-E-185
  HABIT IN ACHIEVEMENT 1167 
panorama. They do not even recognize the moun- 
tains so often seen from the river seat because the 
new view-point alters the relative arrangement in 
the picture. 
Ideas which have been classified and tied up in 
bundles properly labeled give one a comfortable feel- 
Futility of ing of mental security. All that is 
classification necessary then in judging an act 
is to test it by the classification; and when once it 
can be brought under one of the categories of the 
system the whole matter seems quite clear. This 
method is convenient and easy. Its only fault is that 
it does not lead one anywhere. A conspicuous illus- 
tration of its failure was the comment on General 
Nogi’s suicide. Obviously, knowledge of the reli- 
gion and the philosophy of Bushido was needed to 
understand the act. Anglo-Saxon classification of 
ideas is inadequate for its interpretation. 
Ideas are like planets in being deflected from a 
straight course by all others within their range of 
Inadequacy of influence. The difference is that 
settled ideas with ideas the amount of deflec- 
tion is not easy to calculate. The significance of 
thoughts can not be determined with mathematical 
accuracy and it is just this difficulty that makes a 
mobile state of mind unpleasant. Constant rear- 
rangement of opinions and beliefs to meet the re- 
quirements of new facts would keep one thinking, 
and thinking is an effort. At any rate, one likes to 
feel at times that certain questions are answered.
-P-A-G-E-186
    
168 LEARNING AND DOING 
To finish one thing after another and pack them 
away seems to measure progress. “He settles ques- 
tions and you can put it down in your note-book,” 
said a college student not long ago in praise of an 
instructor. When one wishes to use these “settled’’ 
opinions one pulls out a package of ideas as incon- 
gruous at the moment as were those of Rip Van 
Winkle when he awoke. _ It is like tying up a bundle 
of clothes for future use only to find later when they 
are undone that everything is out of date. 
A great deal has been written about the impor- 
tance of conserving ideas. Conservatism is society’s 
Conssevaiian safeguard, we are told. Were it 
and habit not for habit the classes would be 
in endless strife, but men grow accustomed to their 
lot and find things quite endurable. All this, of 
course, is true. Conservatism, however, which is 
only another name for certain kinds of habits, is so 
firmly “set” in man as to require no effort to keep it 
going. The difficulty is to break away from habits 
of thought and action, and it is time to spread the 
gospel of variation to encourage independent think- 
ing. 
“The peculiarity of arrested civilization,” says 
Walter Bagehot, “‘is to kill out varieties at birth, that 
is, in early childhood, and before they can develop.” 
Altering even one belief requires a reorganization of 
many ideas because of their dependence, one upon 
another. This would disturb the system of thoughts 
which has been brought, largely unconsciously, it is
-P-A-G-E-187

true, into such pleasant harmony. For this reason 
it is so hard for man to change his party—he rarely 
does unless convinced that his system of ideas 
will be less disturbed by changing than by remain- 
ing—or for anti-vivisectionists to believe that it is 
better for surgeons to experiment on animals than 
on man. “Hardly any of us,” said William James, 
“can make new heads (for ideas) easily when fresh 
experiences come. Most of us grow more and more 
enslaved to the stock conceptions with which we 
have once become familiar, and less and less capable 
of assimilating impressions in any but the old ways. 
Old-fogyism, in short, is the inevitable terminus to 
which life sweeps us on.””* 
The persistence of the argument for conservatism 
is due to the desire for self-justification of those 
Conservatism illus- Who do not wish to change; and 
trated by history there is just enough truth in what 
is said to make the argument sound plausible. As 
long as discussion deals with the outcome of condi- 
tions not yet realized, the conservatives have the 
advantage in the argument because no one can dem- 
onstrate what the future will bring forth. But when 
we look back over history we have a clear view of 
what it means. The pathway of progress has been 
blocked by the neglect of men who made the sciences 
upon which our comfort, health and lives depend, 
and their crime consisted in resisting the conserv- 
atism of their day. Before Harvey published his

book on the Motion and Uses of the Heart and 
Arteries, in which he demonstrated the circulation 
of the blood, he enjoyed a large practice, for he was 
a skilful surgeon of reputation. But after the appear- 
‘ance of the book “he fell mightily in his practice; 
*twas believed by the vulgar that he was crackbrained 
and all the physicians were against him.” Harvey 
himself says regarding the reception of his dis- 
covery, “These views as usual pleased some more, 
some less; some chid and calumniated me, and laid 
it to me as a crime that I had dared to depart from 
the precepts and opinions of all anatomists. I trem- 
ble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so 
much doth wont and custom become a second 
nature.’’* 
Conservatism, however, is suited to a fixed rather 
than a changing condition of society. It suggests

dren, perhaps the chief purpose, 
is to train them to act appropriately—to fit their 
reactions to events and situations. The aim of 
the education of young animals is the same, but 
their limitations are much narrower. Primarily, 
the nervous system consists of paths joining 
sense organs with muscles. The connection be- 
tween sensory and motor nerves is made through

switching stations, and the adaptability of reactions 
to events in the external world depends upon what 
transpires in the nervous centers between the arri- 
val of the incoming impulse at these switching 
stations and the departure of the outgoing cur- 
rent that produces the reaction. In the lower ani- 
mals little is likely to intervene because their reac- 
tions are largely determined at birth by the organi- 
zation of their nervous system. A dog never refrains 
from eating what is put before him because it caused 
indigestion a few days earlier. Indeed, it is doubt- 
ful whether he even recalls a single occurrence of 
that sort when once the discomfort has passed. To 
be sure, animals learn to avoid what causes pain 
but the new reaction must be forced into the nervous 
system by repeated experiences. 
We see here the differences between man’s reac- 
tions and those of the lower animals. Man’s nervous 
system permits a longer delay between the arrival 
of the incoming impulse and the departure of the 
outgoing and with this delay comes an increase in 
the number of possible reactions. Many motor 
paths connect with the switching station and the 
intervening time gives opportunity for inhibitory 
and reenforcing currents to become effective. Ideas 
recalling the unfortunate outcome of a former act 
may be associated with one movement and so inhibit 
it. Or, again, thoughts of the value of time for de- 
liberation, the better to judge the situation, may pre- 
vent immediate action.

measures his approach to the condition of the lower 
animals. The same mischievous act of children, for 
example, with its great variety of possible causes, as 
stern or even cruel treatment at home, time to waste 
after learning the lesson, desire for fun, revenge, 
etc., may always bring the same punishment. In 
this sort of action little or nothing occurs in the 
teacher’s mind between the arrival of the incoming 
and the departure of the outgoing impulse. The in- 
coming nerve current on its arrival at the switching 
station immediately runs out to a muscle through 
the nerve path which it has always taken. This is 
habit. The difference between man’s habits and 
those of the lower animals is that the latter, except 
as they have been changed by rigorous training, are 
the habits of the species, while man’s are acquired 
individually. 
Human evolution, whatever else it may be, is evi- 
dently growth away from fixed reactions; it is

learning to alter responses to fit 
the niceties of situations to which 
the individual is reacting. But this requires greater 
delicacy in interpreting situations. Conditions which 
the unintelligent would group together in their class- 
ification, with one reaction for each and all, are now 
distinguished from one another because their differ- 
ences are recognized. An illustrative incident was 
recently reported to the writer. A boy came to 
school “armed to the teeth” with wooden knives and 
pistols. The teacher waited to see what would 
happen and soon found out. A girl in front of him 
was shot and those who passed his seat were 
stabbed. Of course there was a good deal of excite- 
ment, a part of which was natural and another part 
added by the children to show their appreciation. 
Now the conventional reaction was punishment, but 
the teacher had learned the wisdom of distinguish- 
ing between situations. She had escaped from ped- 
agogical habits. So she asked the boy why he did it. 
The answer was immediate and frank. He had 
been reading about cowboys and wanted to become 
one. 
“But do you know,” continued the teacher, “that 
real cowboys would have nothing to do with you 
except to drive you away from their ranches?” 
This amazed the boy and he asked why. 
“Because you are not courteous to girls,” replied 
the teacher. An illustration

This unexpected bit of information gave a new 
point of view and the aspiring hero dropped several 
points in the estimation of his fellows. The teacher 
then spent two or three minutes in telling the chil- 
dren something about the good qualities of cowboys. 
After that the subject and the knives were laid aside 
until close of school. When, at dismissal, the boy 
passed her desk the teacher asked him whether he 
would like to read about cowboys. He was eager 
for the books and so, on the following day, she 
brought him several of the better sort. This marked 
the beginning of his interest in reading and in his 
teacher. 
Skill in the interpretation of situations is largely 
a matter of experience; but experience is not gained 
Rispeuiariee ae by merely living through a series 
interpretation of events. The question is, what 
cher enta meaning has been found in them? 
Things occur in apparent isolation or in a setting of 
other things and happenings, some of which are im- 
_ portant for their meaning and others are without 
significance. Interpretation consists in finding the 
relation of these things or occurrences to larger, 
more comprehensive groups of events or ideas. 
When fossils were first discovered they were just so 
many strange objects to be wondered at or ac- 
counted for. They were explained in several ways, 
as patterns of animals which God had made and 
then, dissatisfied, had thrown away. But Darwin’s
-P-A-G-E-193
HABIT IN ACHIEVEMENT 175 
principle of descent with variation brought them un- 
der a general law. It revealed their meaning. Gain- 
ing experience implies, among other things, break- 
ing habits of thought, getting away from traditional 
or environmental classifications of ideas. As long, 
however, as the nerve current runs out through 
habitual paths the customary associations arise, and 
new relations—the basis of meaning—are not dis- 
covered. The explanation of fossils as God’s un- 
used models of animals followed the conventional 
classification of causes of things and events. If, as 
we have seen, getting experience involves finding 
new meaning in objects or situations, then following 
habits of thought and action fails to give experience 
because repetition affords no opportunity for a crit- 
ical estimate of the comparative worth of responses. 
Change is indispensable to critical, productive think- 
ing. 
The lower animals are prevented from discover- 
ing meaning by the limitations of their nervous 
TAtalliseaeeumenns system. The less intelligent an 
variability in animal the more fixed must be its 
eos habits of response. This is nec- 
essary for survival. The habits—instincts—of ani- 
mals low in the scale are so nearly uniform that for 
many years they were thought to be invariable. 
Those of higher animals have long been known to 
be variable and it is because of this variability in 
habits that the question of the intelligence and rea- 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  176 LEARNING AND DOING 
soning of animals has arisen. In other words, in- 
telligence and variability in habits progress together. 
When we try to judge intelligence we at once ask 
how well adapted are actions to novel situations and 
how much meaning seems to be found in the events? 
But this inquiry involves the further question, to 
what extent does the animal group objects or events 
under one or a few classifications? For, obviously, 
if many dissimilar objects or events are grouped 
together little or no meaning can be found in them, 
since meaning begets contrasts and differences, from 
which—but only after differences have been seen— 
similarities appear, followed, again, by a deeper and 
more comprehensive meaning. The final question, 
then, in estimating intelligence, and one which in- 
cludes all the others, is, to what extent does the 
animal profit from experience? Clearly, there is 
little profit if dissimilar objects or events are classed 
together with the same reaction for each. Fishes, 
for example, have a very limited range of classifica- 
tion. If the day is right they snap at almost any- 
thing that is thrown into the water. 
Let us see the effect on human actions of a limited 
classification of causes and effects. Obviously, the 
result of shaping conduct by conventional rules— 
which are only environmental habits operating on 
individuals—can best be understood by observing 
their cumulative effect on adults. 
When one reads about the childhood of eminent 
men and women one is amazed at the number who

of conventional teachers. An investigation of this 
judement subject by the writer easily re- 
vealed more than fifty such cases.* A study of the 
way in which these children passed their time 
showed, in many instances, that they were not idle 
but were absorbed in things of which the school 
took no account. Newton’s idleness, for example, 
was caused by thoughts about mechanical inventions. 
During his play hours he was constantly engaged in 
constructing models of machines. He made, among 
other things, a water-clock, a windmill and a car- 
riage to be moved by the occupant. Yet this busy 
thinking child was rated lazy by the conventional 
classification, 
John Ruskin, who was engaged in original com- 
position from seven years of age and who at ten 
presented his father with an original play of no 
little merit, at sixteen was characterized by his 
teachers as “shaky” in scholarship and a little later 
entered Oxford as a “gentleman-commoner” be- 
cause it was thought doubtful whether he could 
pass the examinations. t 
Doctor Ehrlich, in the laboratory of his teacher, 
was pointed out to visitors, with a smile, as of not 
much good but a clever tissue stainer. Yet, at this 
very time he was showing the ability and dogged 
perseverance that later kept him at the same in-

vestigation until he had made six hundred and five 
combinations, all “failures” according to the usual 
acceptance of the word, but all really successes, 
since in each experiment he saw new meaning and, 
finally, at the six hundred and sixth attempt, suc- 
ceeded. 
It would be a rash conclusion to say that these 
children were not appreciated because of lack of 
ability in the teachers themselves. 
The cases are too numerous for 
that explanation. Besides, some of the teachers 
are known to have been exceptionally able men. 
The reason for their failure to understand these 
pupils and appreciate their ability is that they had 
adopted the conventional pedagogical habits. They 
judged their pupils by the inadequate standard 
classification. Another reason for accepting this 
explanation is that some of the fifty “stupid” chil- 
dren, who became men of eminence, had occasional 
teachers who appreciated their ability, and, as far 
as the writer has been able to learn, all of these 
teachers were men who had freed themselves from 
the conventional habits of the schoolroom. They 
were like Joseph A. Allen, of whom Andrew D. 
White says, he was “the best teacher of English 
branches I have ever known. He had no rules 
and no system; or rather, his rule was to have 
no rules, and his system was to have no system.

ment, this belief would quickly vanish. Onet of

large printing house personally answering all tele-

his time in office boy’s work, he admitted his in- 
ability to let subordinates attend to details for which 
they were quite competent. ( 
Another speaker{ quoted a conversation with the 
proprietor of a large establishment: “I am con-

do, but I can’t seem to get away from them,” was 
the way in which this man confessed his slavery 
to a pernicious habit.

We have been discussing a phase of human psy- 
chology, the tendency to settle into fixed habits of 
The difficulty of | thought or of action. It is one 
changing habits manifestation of the physiological 
law of parsimony. Certain conditions of life must 
be met and the organism makes the necessary 
adaptations in the most economical way. Modes 
of behavior which resist adjustment are gradually 
eliminated and new ways of acting adopted until 
the adaptation meets, at any rate, the minimum 
requirement of effectiveness. The process is com- 
monly gone through unconsciously. We see here 
the difference between the usual reaction to con- 
ditions and that of reformers. The latter resist 
adaptation. But this costs energy and we have 
seen that man is physiologically inclined to be eco- 
nomical in this expenditure. For this reason re- 
forms come in waves. Continued resistance to 
adaptation is impossible except with rare individ- 
uals. The conventional reaction is easier and the 
conventional is always conservative—it repeats past 
modes of reaction with just enough modification 
to satisfy the minimum requirements of changed 
conditions. This is the explanation of the anti- 
quated cost systems urged by the National Cost 
Congress, the reason why business men are so often 
unable to break the habits acquired as subordinates 
and the cause of the continual use of conventional 
systems of classification and of traditional methods 
in the schools.

Acquiring a habit is easy. It usually gets us 
while we drift. Breaking one, on the other hand, 
is exceedingly difficult because nerve currents per- 
sist in running through the old paths which are 
more easily traversed on account of constant use. 
“The great difficulty which history records,” says 
Walter Bagehot,* “is not that of the first step, 
but that of the second step. What is most evident 
is not the difficulty of getting a fixed law, but of 
getting out of a fixed law; not of cementing a 
cake of custom, but of breaking the cake of cus- 
tom; not of making the first preservative habit, 
but of breaking through it and reaching something 
better.” 
Bagehot has also pointed out the part uncon- 
sciously played in history by conventional ideas. 
Walter Bagehot In the formation of national char- 
on conservatism acter, “at first a sort of chance 
predominance made a model, and then invincible 
attraction, the necessity which rules all but the 
strongest men to imitate what is before their eyes, 
and to be what they are expected to be, molded 
men by that model.”{ But adopting fixed habits 
of thought and action, and adaptation by imitation 
are methods suited to a static condition of society. 
They offer no program for change. “Our habitual 
instructors, our ordinary conversation, our inevita- 
ble and ineradicable prejudices,” continues Bage-

hot, “tend to make us think that ‘Progress’ is 
the normal fact in human society, the fact which 
we should expect to see, the fact which we should 
be surprised if we did not see. But history refutes 
this.”* 
William Jamest has called attention to the re- 
lease of energy which sometimes follows a com- 
The release of plete break with habits. The 
mental forces sudden burst of energy and rise 
of ability that accompany new plans and a change 
of occupations has often been observed. Men un- 
expectedly become adequate to the responsibilities 
of much more important and difficult positions than 
they have previously held. “I did not know it 
was in him,” is a common remark. It was in him 
but could not be drawn on as long as he held his 
old position with its associated habits, to which he 
had grown so accustomed that the work ran along 
with the regularity with which one foot is placed 
before the other in walking, and with scarcely more 
attention. Habits of occupation reduce ability to 
the lowest level that the work will stand. Man 
does no more thinking than is necessary and habit 
eliminates the need of thought. This is true even 
in acts commonly felt to involve volition. 
In speaking of the growth toward automatism 
in choice-processes revealed in his investigations,

Warning against Barrett says* “regularity was 
automatic habits manifested in every phase of the 
choice-process, in the manner of reading the card 
(to which the subjects reacted), in the manner of 
reacting, and of realizing the choice. Automatism 
entered into every detail of the experiment. Even 
the experimenter came to perform the various func- 
tions in a perfectly automatic way, so much so, 
that the salient note of the whole experiment 
toward the end of the series was its mechanical 
regularity.” ‘‘We see,” also, “that the natural tend- 
ency is toward automatic choosing. The times 
grow shorter, the number of phenomena (admitted 
within the field of choice by the subject) grows 
less, only one alternative is considered; there is 
economy in every sense, and finally, the motiva- 
tion reaches such a point that it never, or practi- 
cally never, deviates from a certain curve or mo- 
tivation-track.”” In Barrett’s earlier experiments 
those who were being tested made many remarks 
about motives, feelings and judgments which influ- 
enced action, but toward the end they had little 
to say. “There was nothing to remark. There 
were no feelings, hesitations or motives to describe. 
The mental act had become direct and simple. . . . 
The will had gradually ceased to expend useless 
effort. Volitional force was economized. . . . Au- 
tomatism held sway, and there was nothing to

record.” That is a pretty good description of 
death as far as mental activity is concerned; yet 
it seems to be the final outcome of being possessed 
by habits. Evidently, if one is to have living 
thoughts, if, indeed, one is to think at all, it is 
necessary to resist the encroachment of occupation- 
habits by vigorous, determined change in methods 
of work. 
A new position sometimes forces change because 
the old habits do not fit the new occupation, but 
H with teachers even a new school ow teachers may

Reson thouene realignment. Clearly, then, a 
definite policy must be followed if teachers would 
avoid the mental sclerosis that always accompanies 
a “setting” of thought and action. As to the 
methods, that has already been indicated. If 
teachers follow the thoughts and feelings and pur- 
poses of their pupils, and build their method upon 
these thoughts and feelings, fossilization may be 
indefinitely postponed because the children will fur- 
nish enough variety to make things both interesting 
and fertile. 
It is becoming possessed by a method and sys- 
tem to which all children are trimmed that arrests 
growth in pupils and teachers alike. Most of us 
are like Montaigne, “besotted unto liberty” and we 
resent being tailored to order. If the school is 
made into a workshop instead of a task shop,

them, suggesting and guiding rather than command- 
ing and forbidding, proposing problems and reveal- 
ing just enough of their wonders to awaken 
curiosity, he will be driven to the library to find 
answers to questions and his own study there will 
keep his mind fresh and alert. The resistless force 
of suggestion has never been appreciated by those 
engaged in training children. Doctor Adams, the 
first teacher who understood Walter Scott and al- 
most the only one of whom Scott speaks with affec- 
tion, was accustomed to invite his pupils to attempt 
poetical versions of passages from Horace and Ver- 
gil, but never made them tasks; and Scott, called 
“stupid” by his other teachers, was made to feel 
by Doctor Adams that he had “a character for learn- 
ing to maintain.” 
There is, however, another class of habits which 
may be designated habits of behavior. These habits 
are the slyest imps of conduct 
with which man has to deal. 
They are always taking an unfair advantage, run- 
ning their own course while we are off our guard. 
When Benjamin Franklin conceived “the bold and 
arduous project of arriving at moral perfection” 
he found that while he was guarding against one 
fault, he was often surprised by another. “Habit 
took advantage of attention; inclination was some- 
times too strong for reason.’’*

wise, when perplexed, to look beyond our own

phenomena which will aid us in analyzing and in-

assistance in the Boy Scouts. The writer happened, 
recently, to be on a crowded street-car with two 
Boy Scouts in front of him, one seated and the 
other standing. A gray-haired but vigorous man 
entered and pushed his way up to the seat of the 
Scout. Both boys saw him, but for a minute nothing 
happened. Then the Scout who was standing took 
his companion by the collar and pulled him out of 
his seat, at the same time touching his hat to the 
stranger and asking him to sit down. After the 
man had thanked them and seated himself the boy 
who had taken the active part whispered to his 
comrade, “Don’t you know that Scouts must be 
polite?”

it creates is carried over to behavior in other situa- 
tions. Conduct then becomes an integral part of 
their thoughts about scouting. The emotions of the 
boys become allies in establishing habits of behavior. 
But it goes farther than this. 
In a school with which the writer is acquainted, a

power here waiting to be utilized in training boys. 
It has been found, however, that the scouting

Use of pupil- the racial instincts of children. 
Soverenient Experiments in pupil-government 
show that the instinct to do things, to manage their 
own affairs—in short the instinct for workmanship 
—is quite as strong as that for scouting. Indeed, 
the indications are that a large part of the power 
which is utilized by the Scout Masters comes from 
just this instinct to manage things. Joined with this, 
of course, is the instinct to show off, to exercise au- 
thority and, strangely paradoxical as it may seem, 
the instinct to obey. Children do not object to obey- 
ing when they are organized for obedience.

about pupil- He acts through the children by 
Boveri ene suggestion, conferring with the 
leaders or letting them work out their difficulties 
themselves, as his judgment may dictate; and acting 
through the children is much easier when there is 
some organization. That pupil-government may be 
understood it may be said to be in every way analo- 
gous to an exhibition in which pupils and teacher 
join. The children feel that this exhibition is theirs, 
as indeed it is, and they organize for its success. 
The fact that the teacher does not assert himself and 
give directions does not mean that he is an unimpor- 
tant factor in the preparations. If he is wise he re- 
mains in the background, letting the children plan 
and work, helping them, of course, by suggestions to 
the leaders at the right moment, but always working 
as one of them and emphasizing their ability, rather 
than his own, to meet the difficulties. And every 
teacher knows that his influence, though unaggres- 
sive, is not less potent here than in the schoolroom. 
Children like to work the machinery of an organ-

Fascination of sentiment of the school behind

may take. The “Roman State,” the “Athenian As-

the idea seems not to have been emphasized in any 
of them. They all, however, represent organiza- 
tions of the pupils to accomplish the things for 
which they were attending school. These activities 
appealed to the racial instincts to join together for a 
definite purpose, to manage things, and they brought 
to the support of the teachers that tremendously 
powerful racial force which demands employment 
and which will find it in escapades and trouble if it is 
not given other outlets. When these instincts are uti- 
lized and the teacher acts with them instead of 
against them, the influence for behavior that makes 
for success in the school and the larger world out- 
side extends beyond the building because the work 
that the pupils are doing is then their own. They 
are doing it for themselves and not for the teacher, 
and the habits which are urged take on a personal 
interest. The children then move under their own 
steam and the power comes from the inexhaustible 
store of racial energy; and the teacher assumes his 
proper function at the wheel instead of pushing 
from behind. “The school i is, in fact, given to the 
care of the pupils,” says Demolins of the famous

any more efficient means to build up men.”* 
We have been trying to show the importance of 
the environment in the school for acquiring effi- 
Habit and school Cient habits. It is commonly 
environment thought that firm discipline and 
good teaching are all that is required to make a 
good school; but after all, these requisites are only 
prerequisites. The teacher may do his part ad- 
mirably and yet the result be nullified by the at- 
mosphere of resistance pervading the school; and 
just now we are inquiring how this resistance may 
be overcome. As in other matters which we have 
discussed, this problem of habit-formation, when 
reduced to its lowest terms, means making situa- 
tions to which the children will adapt themselves; 
and the conditions should be so planned that in 
making the adaptation the desirable habits will be- 
come “set.” This, as we have seen, involves cre- 
ating a school sentiment favorable to the employ- 
ment of these habits.

conditions of the battle. Nothing in the configura- 
tion of the ground and no obstructions to the move- 
ment of troops are overlooked. He tries to plan 
a situation, by means of the contour of the field 
and through obstacles to the movement of the op- 
posing forces, that shall compel the enemy to do 
the things he wants them to do. In other words 
he forces adaptation to the situation which he has 
planned; and he does it against the will of his 
opponents by utilizing conditions at his disposal and 
by creating others. Skill in this makes up his gen- 
eralship. 
The “setting” of the situation is as essential to 
success in school as on the field of battle. At best 
Tinporkance’of there are conditions, such as those 
right school of the home, which can not be 
etmipepiere fully controlled; and this makes 
those at the disposal of the teacher the more im- 
portant. As long as there is no feeling of approval 
among the pupils for the formation of desirable 
habits it will be difficult, if not impossible, to make 
them take a firm hold on the children. If, how- 
ever, there is a feeling that those who do not adapt 
themselves are obstructing progress and interfering 
with the rights of their fellows, adaptation is cer- 
tain to be forced; and that feeling prevails very 
strongly when the pupils are organized among them- 
selves to do the work of the school. Teachers 
must certainly insist rigorously on the method of 
work that leads to the formation of desirable  
-P-A-G-E-210
  192 LEARNING AND DOING 
habits. We are speaking, however, of the way in 
which this insistence shall be made and of the man- 
ner of winning the pupils’ support. Teachers may 
point out the value of certain habits and may in- 
flict penalties upon those who fail to respond, only 
to be discouraged by the results at the end of. the 
year. When, however, influence is applied through 
the organized body of pupils the result of the com- 
bined action is often amazing. 
In the reaction against severity of discipline 
a certain laxness has arisen. The effort to make 
Lardesa of studies pleasant has ended in mak- 
discipline ing them easy. There has been 
too much sentimentality and too little frank inter- 
action between teacher and pupils as coworkers for 
the same purpose, with firm and ceaseless insistence 
on exactness in the habits which are essential to 
success. The scrub-woman of a friend of the 
writer, in a city famous for its schools, recently 
put it in this way to her mistress: “Annie, my 
girl, goes to school and she does a little of this and 
a little of that, and when the children are tired or 
don’t want to do the lesson they’re on, the teacher 
she changes them off to something easier, and you 
know that’s no way to train girls. All their lives 
they’ll have to do things when they’re tired and 
don’t want to. Now, when I tell Annie to do any- 
thing she says, ‘Oh, I’m tired.’ They don’t teach 
’em thorough, either. Last night Annie was doin’ 
the dishes an’ her father he seen that she wasn’t

half cleanin’ ’em and he made her do ’em over, 
and she says to him, ‘You’re awful hard on me, 
a sight harder’n teacher. She says I work real 
good’; and that’s just it, Miss , with the 
teachers. Pretty well’s good enough.” 
The view regarding habits of behavior toward 
work which this scrub-woman expressed so crudely 
The basis of good is good psychology. As we have 
school habits seen, man expends just energy 
enough to satisfy the demands of the situation in 
which he is placed. If he can find ways of em- 
ploying less energy by evading certain demands he 
is likely to accommodate himself to this lower level 
of requirement unless he has been trained to habits 
of application in his youth. With adults, social 
and business exigencies exert an influence entirely 
unknown to children. Obviously, the effort should 
be made to reproduce these efficient motives for 
behavior in the school. This reproduction of busi- 
ness incentives is one of the benefits of combining 
school work with work in shops and trades, under 
the regular conditions of these occupations; and 
the organization of children into pupil-government 
has the same effect, because the school then be- 
comes a community with certain purposes and aims 
which the children have banded together to pro- 
mote. 
Such organizations also furnish reasons which 
the children can appreciate for the insistence of 
the teacher upon industry and accuracy and other  
-P-A-G-E-212
  
194 LEARNING AND DOING 
habits of behavior in the school. These require- 
ments no longer seem to be arbitrary demands of 
the teacher. They have their justification in the 
work which the children are organized to do, and 
which they wish to do successfully because it is 
their own. The failure of any one to do his share 
meets the same disapproval from associates that is 
accorded “soldiering” on the football field. A child 
who has passed the age of ten or twelve does what 
he thinks his fellows will applaud; and when the 
school is organized into an industrial and social 
community with pupils for its officers, the motives 
of the larger society outside the school prevail. 
The children then applaud achievements, and in 
doing things successfully the habits which are es- 
sential to success in work are fixed. All of this 
is only the application of the psychology of be- 
havior to the school.

CHAPTER VII 
NEW DEMANDS ON THE SCHOOLS 
HAT was an epoch-making book that Her- 
bert Spencer wrote on education. It fell like 
a thunder-bolt out of a clear sky, and, like the 
neo tipes storm, it cleared the atmosphere. 
of books on Some books are perennial because 
educa om they touch human chords and set 
them vibrating with music that quickens a respon- 
sive mood in each. The strains they play are not 
the same with different persons because the respon- 
siveness of the nervous system varies with experi- 
ence. Such a book is Rousseau’s Emile. I rarely 
find two persons who get the same meaning from 
it; but all—except those obsessed by the spirit of 
exactness—get something. 
Spencer’s Education, on the other hand, did its 
work and passed. It appeared when the authority 
of the ancients rested heavily upon the schools, and 
it released theni from the weight of tradition by 
revealing a new body of knowledge and new prob- 
lems—modern problems—which we had with us 
all the time but had not discovered. 
The change was made slowly. Indeed, it is not 
T95 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  196 LEARNING AND DOING 
yet fully completed, for man rarely, if ever, breaks 
suddenly and completely from his 
traditional moorings. Fear of 
the uncertainty beyond drives him back to familiar 
waters where he feels acquainted with the sound- 
ings. Unless, like Spencer, he be a pioneer in think- 
ing, and they are few, he charts the sea of new 
ideas by paddling round the edges, going out a 
little way at times but hastily returning when things 
become too strange. Who has not had the experi- 
ence of convincing a friend of a new belief only 
to find him back in his old ideas the next day? 
So, in spite of the revolution that Spencer started 
there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty 
The utilitarian and bout the purpose of education. 
the philosophic Writers on this subject fall into ideals of education two general groups. For the first, 
ability to make a living is what teachers should 
keep in mind, while the others emphasize what may 
be called the philosophical attitude toward life. 
Our thoughts and aspirations, all that we include 
under ideals, these philosophical educators insist 
are the important things to seek. The former took 
up Spencer’s work where he stopped, and to-day 
they are the advocates of industrial and vocational 
training. They have secured a strategic advantage 
in having a definite program to offer. The other 
group is not so well organized because there is less 
agreement among its members regarding the essen- 
tials of education. Timorous thinking 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
  
NEW DEMANDS ON SCHOOLS _ 197 
These two opinions seem to imply opposition if 
not contradiction. Thinking is put over against do- 
Harmonizing the ing and the implication is always 
two views in evidence that if children are 
trained to the one the other must of necessity be ex- 
cluded. But we have found that the two are only 
parts of the response of mind to situations that con- 
front us. Ideas of one sort or another are gained 
through sense impressions, and the nervous current 
thus started requires an outlet, and that is action. 
We call the results—when the mind has done its 
share—experience. The trouble is that with too 
many the nervous paths from sense-organs lead only 
to blind alleys. No action follows. The emotions, 
started by thoughts or sense impressions, 00ze away. 
These are the inefficient people. They mean well 
but do nothing. Every one knows them among 
acquaintances and no teacher is without them in 
the school. They are the children who lament their 
failures and are always making promises that are 
never kept. Among adults this state of mind af- 
fords joy to some who revel in unintelligent op- 
timism, and pain to others who bewail their fate. 
Now this emotional debauchery is a habit that 
has been acquired through the separation of thought 
from action. 
We are trying to find the meaning of education 
and we may be helped by reducing it to its lowest 
terms. We can then see what changes are needed 
as it becomes more complex,
-P-A-G-E-216
  198 LEARNING AND DOING 
Among the lower animals education is fully de- 
fined in terms of adaptation. No animal can live 
Animal education that is not adapted to its environ- 
. defined by ment, and fitness to survive is all 
gcepieuce there is to animal education. But 
adaptation alone does not go far. If the food 
upon which a group of animals depends suddenly 
fails, the animals perish. Evidently, even among 
the lowest forms, ability to change, to readjust one’s 
self to new conditions, is advantageous and, as 
we ascend the animal séries, it becomes essential 
to the survival of the species. Among the lower 
animals, where adaptation is all there is to educa- 
tion, nature provides for it through instinct. These 
animals are endowed at birth with an almost un- 
erring tendency to do the same thing under appar- 
ently similar circumstances. In the great majority 
of cases, this serves its purpose, which is preserva- 
tion. It were better that fishes bite at everything 
offered and occasionally be caught than that they 
risk the loss of a meal by hesitation. Nature pro- 
vides for the comparatively few fatal mistakes by 
making animals prolific. Twenty thousand eggs are 
laid by a herring and upward of sixteen million 
by an oyster, while the conger-eel must lay fifteen 
million annually to escape annihilation.* “Certain 
bacteria multiply so rapidly that the descendants 
of a single individual, if allowed to multiply un-

hindered for three days, would be represented by 
the figures 47,000,000,000,000.”* 
Adaptation meets the needs of a static environ- 
ment, but for sudden change nature has made no 
Vifesitatienn of provision. Her penalty for fail- 
animal adaptation yre to meet the unexpected is re- 
lentless destruction, until by the slow process of 
bodily reorganization new organisms are produced 
suited to the conditions that destroyed their prede- 
cessors. This is an expensive method. It costs 
time and life. Now one of the aims of human 
education, as distinguished from animal training, 
should be to eliminate this waste by producing be- 
ings capable of interpreting situations and of rapid 
readjustment. But rapid adjustment requires abil- 
ity to look at least a little way into the future, 
else the change is here before one is prepared. 
As I write, a despatch in one of the daily paperst 
reports that a western county has been invaded by 
millions of rabbits, 
“Already a district of over two hundred eighty- 
eight square miles has been swept clean by the pests, 
and the rabbits are widening out, the main army 
apparently dividing into two forces, one of which 
is invading the lands farther north, while the other 
is attacking the country farther west. 
“The farmers of that region have been opening 
up a practically new country, and the loss of their 
grain crops leaves them facing starvation. The

200 LEARNING AND DOING 
rabbits came in hordes from the region to the west, 
toward the Columbia River, when the tender feed 
began to dry up, and the young grain fields have 
been a luscious find for them. They cut down the 
stalks of grain just below the head, leaving the 
stubble standing. 
“Authorities say that only the abolition of the 
coyote bounty will avail in wiping out the rabbits 
in that region.” 
This illustrates the adaptation to the static con- 
dition of which we have been speaking. The legis- 
lators and other inhabitants of that state seem to 
have assumed that when the coyotes were killed 
nature would freeze up, as it were, and changes 
cease. The one thing on which these people fixed 
their attention was that coyotes are the enemy of 
sheep and stock. The related and, as it appears, 
equally important facts—that coyotes destroy vast 
numbers of rabbits and so keep these little plagues 
in their proper place of subordination—were not 
considered. Yet these facts are primer knowledge 
to every westerner. 
Of course, these people did not expect changes 
to end after the coyotes were gone. Put in the 
common vernacular, they “didn’t think.” If we 
express it somewhat more scientifically, they used 
the animal method, of which we have been speak- 
ing, to meet the situation. Finding that coyotes 
were killing sheep and stock, they took the first 
and easiest means of self-protection. They offered 
a prize in the form of a bounty for every coyote   
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  
NEW DEMANDS ON SCHOOLS 201 
killed. Since coyotes were numerous this bounty 
gave an easy livelihood to many. As a result the 
coyotes have passed, and with their passing has 
come the change that should have been foreseen. 
Adaptation clearly acquires a new and wider

with a different arrangement and, 
perhaps, with some omissions. . This is thinking 
things in new relations. The people, for example, of 
whom we spoke above, should have pictured a situ- 
ation from which coyotes were missing. Then it 
would not have been difficult to foresee the count- 
less increase of smaller animals that they destroy. 
Imagining new arrangements of materials and ac- 
tions with which we are already familiar is the 
basis of all invention whether in thoughts or things. 
The aeroplane is only a new application of materi- 
als and forces which had already been used in 
other ways. 
The trial and error method is used by man and 
the lower animals alike. The difference is in its 
The advantage application. The imagination of 
of human the lower animals is probably 
eee limited to mental reproduction of 
what their senses give. It is doubtful whether, in 
their memory image, they can add or subtract much 
from the original presentation. This power to

  202 LEARNING AND DOING 
change the picture, to see it altered by one omission 
after another, to imagine new situations with some 
of the factors in the old omitted—the ability to 
reduce the number of possible causes by the proc- 
ess of elimination—enables man to discover causes. 
But it is necessary to train him in its use. 
A drove of sheep were being driven from one 
pasture to another. The foremost jumped a rail 
Imitation and so high that it required consider- 
inefficiency able effort to make the leap. 
Soon, accidentally, one struck the rail and knocked 
it down. But the rest of the sheep, even to the 
last, gave the same leap that had been a part of the 
successful series of actions of those who went be- 
fore. Man, also, tends to repeat the program which 
he has seen or learned. This is one of the factors 
in his inefficiency and it is with the elimination 
of these useless movements that the principle of 
scientific management is concerned. Here, again, 
it is a matter of trial and error joined with im- 
proved capacity to recognize success and understand 
its cause. | 
We have found that education reduced to its low- 
est terms is adaptation to environment. As ani- 
Adaptation di- mals become more complex ability 
rected by to foresee changes and to plan for intelligence them is added. Adaptation is 
then directed by intelligence and the old primitive 
trial and error method acquires new significance. 
Training for this higher mode of adaptation, and
-P-A-G-E-221
  NEW DEMANDS ON SCHOOLS 203 
practice in it, are essential parts of the education 
of children. It was for this that man’s longer pe- 
riod of infancy was given. 
The committee in charge of the Portland school 
urvey laid down three fundamental working prin- 
The school and ciples which are as true for 
community schools in other sections of the 
country, and for small and large towns alike, as 
they are for Portland. “First, the children’ and 
youth of the community must be constantly and 
sympathetically studied by teachers and principals, 
in order that these may understand at all times the 
condition, the capacity, the interests, and the edu- 
cational needs of each child or youth. 
“Second, the various present and prospective op- 
portunities and needs of the community for worthy 
service must also be studied, constantly and appre- 
ciatively, particularly by those immediately respon- 
sible for the education of youth soon to be called 
upon to take effective part in the occupations and 
life of the community.” 
It is interesting, in this connection to read in 
the Carnegie Foundation’s report on Vermont that 
“Something is radically wrong with a school in 
an agricultural community that develops motormen, 
stenographers, and typewriters, and fails to develop 
farmers, dairymen, and gardeners.” 
“Third, the instruction of each child and youth 
-—the content, method, and the immediate purpose 
of that instruction—must be constantly adapted to 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  204 LEARNING AND DOING 
the needs of that child or youth, in the light of 
the needs of the community.” 
Change characterizes the present. Inventions are 
so frequent that manufacturers find difficulty in 
Change, a charac- Meeting the expense of introduc-

are continually obliged to reconstruct or discard 
cars and make over their road beds. A battle-ship, 
with its tremendous cost of five million dollars or 
more, is obsolete in about ten years and practically 
worthless for its purpose a little later. The auto- 
mobile has made necessary an entirely new science 
of road building, and the farmer who a few years 
ago was able to make a good living by merely hard 
work is no longer able to compete with those who 
foresaw the change and availed themselves of sci- 
entific methods. Even the rotation of crops which 
not long ago was regarded as the acme of the 
science of farming is now compared by one ex- 
pert to the effect on a bank-account of rotating a 
check book among different members of the family. 
The changes that are going on with such amaz- 
ing rapidity call for correspondingly rapid readapta- 
Suctesa depend: tion of those who wish to suc- 
ent on rapid ceed. But the period of acceler- readaptation ated progress came upon us so 
unexpectedly that we have not yet succeeded in 
adjusting ourselves to it. How sudden has been

were comparatively stable. A son expected to fol- 
low in his father’s business, or, if not, he learned 
a trade or selected some other occupation suited 
to his taste. Permanency and stability were always 
counted on. But how quickly was he undeceived. 
Perhaps, with meager ability, little schooling and 
parental demand for financial aid, he learned the 
trade of making shoes. We know the disappoint- 
ment of those who did. It was not long before 
machinery drove them out of business. To-day, 
they cobble and find it difficult to live. Resoling 
shoes with the electric hammer has greatly reduced 
their income. 
Some time ago the writer made the acquaintance 
of a machine and implement maker who learned 
his trade when skilled hand work- 
men were in demand. To-day 
the university laboratory is the only place where 
he can find employment. But laboratories large 
enough to employ a skilled mechanic are not numer- 
ous, so most of those who learned this trade have 
been forced into other occupations. 
We are all familiar with the change which the 
mail-order houses and trolley lines have brought 
on the general country stores. 
These are a few of the instances which might 
be cited to show the trend. Apparently the only 
certainty to-day in trades or business is their un- 
certainty. And those who are to succeed must be 
prepared for change, since there is abundant ground Instances

for the belief that industrial reconstruction has only 
begun. 
The significance of this for the schools is evi- 
dent; for the changes of which we are speaking 
Signi have brought with them altera- ignificance for a : i 
schools of social tions in the home that have pro- 
oe foundly affected education. When 
two interdependent institutions 
grow up together their points of contact adjust 
themselves to each other. For this reason the 
home and school of fifty years ago fitted nicely into 
the industrial conditions of the period. This is 
one phase of nature’s law of adaptation. She is 
not concerned with the final outcome. One result 
satisfies her as well as another. But things must 
work. If they do not the system is unstable and 
alterations of one sort or another will occur until 
a workable relationship is found. Public school 
systems, for example, owe their origin to the in- 
sistent demand for industrial equality, because de- 
mocracy and the education of a selected few could 
not come to a working agreement. As long as 
a change is slow, adjustment keeps pace, but when 
one part of the social organization outstrips another, 
confusion arises and continues until a new state 
of equilibrium is finally established. After that 
adjustment must begin anew. To-day we are pass- 
ing through such a period of readjustment on ac- 
count of the revolutionary social and industrial

changes of the last few decades. Home life has 
undergone a transformation with which the school 
has not kept pace.

not conducive to training for successful manhood 
and womanhood. Of course it can be done, but 
constant effort to overcome obstructions is difficult

belief that duty ends with the instruction in the

the schoolmaster was second only to the preacher 
as guide and friend. To-day there is more reason 
for the teacher to assume this function than in 
earlier times, because the home has lost much of

its machinery for the training of children. But 
let us see the sort of development which parents un- 
consciously gave their children fifty years ago.* 
“T begin with winter, when men’s industries were 
most diversified, and largely in wood,” says G. 
The home in Stanley Hall, speaking of his boy- 
education fifty hood days. “Lumber—or tim- 
ohn ber—trees were chopped down 
and cut by two men working a cross-cut saw, which 
was always getting stuck fast, in a pinch which 
took the set out of it, unless the whole trunk was 
pried up by skids. Sometimes the fallen trees were 
cut into logs, snaked together and piled with the 
aid of cant-hooks, to be drawn across the frozen 
pond to the saw-mill for some contemplated build- 
ing, or, if of spruce, of straight grain and few 
knots, or of good rift, they were cut into bolts, 
or cross-sections fifteen inches long, which was the 
legal length for shingles. These were taken home 
in a pung, split with beetle and wedge, and then 
with a frow, and finished off with a drawshave 
on a shaving-horse, itself home-made. ... Ax- 
helves, too, were sawn, split, hewn, whittled, and 
scraped into shape with broken glass, and the form 
peculiar to each local maker was as characteristic as 
the style of painter or poet, and was widely known, 
compared and criticized. Butter-paddles were com- 
monly made of red cherry, while sugar lap paddles

were made by merely barking whistle wood or bass 
and whittling down one end fora handle. Mauls and 
beetles were made of ash-knots, ox-bows of walnut, 
held in shape till seasoned by withes of yellow birch, 
from which also birch brushes and brooms were 
manufactured on winter evenings by stripping down 
seams of wood in the green. There were salt mor- 
tars and pig-troughs made from solid logs, with 
tools hardly more effective than those the Indian 
uses for his dug-out. Flails for next year’s thresh- 
ing, cheese-hoops and cheese-ladders ; bread-troughs 
and yokes for hogs and sheep, and pokes for jump- 
ing cattle, horses and unruly geese, and stanchions 
for cows. . . . Repairs were made during this sea- 
son, and a new cat-hole beside the door with a 
lateral working drop-lid, which the cat operated 
with ease, was made one winter.” 
All of these activities the boys saw and helped 
in according to their age and strength. The work 
Education presented obstacles to be over- 
through action come and problems to be solved 
which called for thinking. It was training to do 
things by doing them; and one of the duties of 
educators to-day is to find an adequate substitute 
for the home training of this earlier period. 
Closely connected with the life of the boys of 
that day were the “hemlock bows and arrows, or 
cross-bows, with arrow-heads run on with melted

tique pewter dish was in great demand) often fatal

for small game; box and figure 4 traps for rats 
and squirrels; wind-mills; weather-vanes in the 
form of fish, roosters or even ships; an actual saw- 
mill that went in the brook, and cut planks with 
marino and black and white Carter potatoes for 
logs; and many whittled tools, toys and ornamental 
forms and puppits.... How much all this has saved 
me since, in the laboratory, in daily life and even 
in the study,” continues Doctor Hall, “it would be 
hard to estimate. 
“I must not forget the rage for trapping and 
hunting, by which we learned much of the habits 
of crows, hawks, muskrats, woodchucks, squirrels, 
partridges and even foxes, and which made us ac- 
quainted with wide areas of territory. ... We 
(the younger boys of about ten) made collections 
for the whole season, of wood, leaves, flowers, 
stones, bugs, butterflies, etc.” 
Broom making, with its preliminary planting, 
breaking, tabling and hatcheling, watching the local 
tanner, gunsmiths and basket makers, visiting the 
cooper-shops, carding mills, hovering around the 
turning shops to see how they made wooden spoons, 
bowls, etc., not to mention the blacksmith shops, 
harness makers and shops in which shoes were made 
and not merely cobbled, all of these places and many 
more helped along the education of the New Eng- 
land boys fifty years ago. “I know,” says Doctor 
Hall, that “I could make soap, maple sugar, a pair of
-P-A-G-E-229
  NEW DEMANDS ON SCHOOLS 211 
shoes, braid a palm leaf hat, spin, put in and weave 
a piece of frocking or a rag carpet. 
“The dull days in haying time brought another 
sort of education. The men of the vicinity strolled 
together in a shed, and, sitting on a tool bench, 
grindstone, manger, wagons, chopping blocks, and 
hog spouts, discussed crop prices, ditching, walling, 
salting cattle, finding springs with witch hazel, taxes, 
the preaching,” etc., all of which afforded training 
in common-sense philosophy, economics and citizen- 
ship. 
In the evening, as the family gathered around 
the stove, or the old fireplace, stories were told and 
books were read. “A pair of skates was earned 
by a boy friend one winter by reading the entire 
Bible through, and another boy bought an accordion 
with money earned by braiding the plain sides of 
palm-leaf hats where no splicing was needed, for 
women at a cent per side.” 
The farm in those days was a great workshop 
and laboratory surrounded by a limitless range of 
pit eee fields and woods peopled with 
workshop and innumerable wild animals waiting 
laboratory to be watched or caught. It was 
admirable training for the life of the period and 
not so bad for present needs could we but imitate 
its spontaneity.

be sure we have been trying lately to supply the 
need, but our efforts have been hardly more suc- 
cessful than the “jungle” in the New York Zoologi-

We have said that the present age is character-

in a continual state of alteration. The great major-

find their livelihood in some of the modest occu- 
pations from which we have drawn examples. But

his greatest difficulty consists in finding among the

the various grades of subordinate executive respon-

jority of men, from the standpoint of availability 
for promotion, consists,” he said, “in lack of ca- 
pacitv to adjust themselves to new requirements.

“Modern business,” he continued, “no longer 
waits for men to qualify after promotion. Through 
Imagination anticipation and prior preparation 
and business every growing man must be 
largely ready for his new job when it comes to 
him. I find very few individuals making any effort 
to think out better ways of doing things. They 
do not anticipate needs, do not keep themselves 
fresh at the growing point. If they ever had any 
imagination they seem to have lost it and imagina- 
tion is needed in a growing business, for it is 
through the imagination that one anticipates future 
changes and so prepares for them before they come. 
Accordingly, as a general proposition, the selection 
of a man for a vacancy within the organization is 
more or less a matter of guesswork. Now and 
then an ambitious, wide-awake young man works 
into the organization and in a very short time is 
spotted by various department managers for future 
promotion, but the number of such individuals is 
discouragingly small. The difficulty with which we 
are always confronted is that our business grows 
faster than do those within it. The men do not 
keep up with our changes. The business grows 
away from them and quite reluctantly the manage- 
ment is frequently compelled to go outside for the 
necessary material. We need, at the present time, 
four or five subordinate chiefs in various parts of 
the factory and I can fill none of them satisfactorily 
from material in hand.”

When questioned further, this same man said, 
“Capacity to vary and rapidly to readjust one’s self 
Rapid adjustment to new and changing conditions 
essential is not only essential to the busi- 
ness success of individuals but it is quite as nec- 
essary with respect to the business itself.” He then 
instanced several companies which ten years ago 
were the leaders in their lines but which have fal- 
len far behind because of the inability of the man- 
agement to anticipate the future and to make the 
necessary readjustment. One of these companies 
did not see the significance of the revolutionary 
advent of the steam turbine. “The management 
sat by while other companies brought it to a suc- 
cessful commercial basis. There is no standing- 
still in the business world to-day. Methods, devices 
and social tendencies in general, demand a constant 
evolution upward in human capacity all along the 
line.” 
The manager of a company that sells heaters 
through a large part of the United States writes 
Other types that when he assumed control he 
of failure secured as agents men who had 
been successful in selling other lines of goods. He 
reasoned that selling goods was much the same 
whatever the commodity. In any line of salesman- 
ship the agents must learn to meet and deal with 
men and the readaptation necessary with the change 
of article would be comparatively easy. So he 
thought it out. But to his amazement he found
-P-A-G-E-233
  NEW DEMANDS ON SCHOOLS) 215 
that the men whom he employed could not make 
even this slight readjustment. An entire year was 
lost by the company in getting started. 
This manager mentioned an instance of incapac- 
ity for readaptation of a different sort from those 
to which we have referred. “A man who had for- 
merly held a railroad position in which he had been 
obliged to deal with men and convince them of 
the value of his propositions undertook to sell 
heaters to school boards. He was an unusually 
‘good mixer.’ He made friends easily and kept 
them; but he could not handle school boards. This 
man, after trying all summer, with a wide experi- 
ence in dealing with men, was wholly unable to 
meet a situation and adjust himself to it. At the 
end of the season he gave it up. 
“There is no question in my mind,” continues 
this manager, “that mental flexibility is absolutely 
Mental flexibility  ¢ssential to a young man who ex- 
and success pects to become active in the busi- 
ness world. Business is made up of constantly 
changing conditions and unexpected situations. One 
who can not see ahead and have a plan for a new 
situation before it comes had better stay out. Every 
business day is apt to bring the unexpected, and 
the man who is not ready, who has not the re- 
sourcefulness to adjust himself to new conditions, 
is eventually a failure. The man who is mentally 
flexible and who studies the situations and looks 
into the future is a success.”
-P-A-G-E-234
  216 LEARNING AND DOING 
The assistant manager of the system of street 
railways in one of the three or four of our 
Problems of big largest cities writes as follows: 
business concerns “Aj] Jarge employers of labor 
need foremen and, in factories or other industries, 
departmental heads. It is desirable that these fore- 
men be not only well grounded in the particular 
work which they supervise, but they should, in ad- 
dition, have some executive ability. Since few men 
are versatile enough or sufficiently equipped for the 
work many large companies have training schools 
in which instruction is freely given to the employees 
who desire to avail themselves of the opportunity. 
The hope is that from among the many who take the 
instruction a sufficient number will develop the ver- 
satility necessary for some of the executive posi- 
tions. 
“Another problem which employers of large num- 
bers of men must meet is to keep good men. An 
employer can not afford to be continually breaking 
in a wholly new outfit of men. There must be 
some permanency to his organization. This is one 
of the cases in which the manager must be versa- 
tile. To meet this need the following plans have 
been put into effect by many of the large employ- 
ers of labor. (1) A purchasing system; (2) an 
employees’ relief association which furnishes medi- 
cal and hospital attention to sick employees; (3) 
a cooperative purchasing system by means of which 
employees have the benefit of the purchasing
-P-A-G-E-235

power of a large corporation; (4) a loan depart- 
ment; (5) a legal department; (6) entertainments, 
such as baseball teams, basket-ball teams, dances, am- 
ateur vaudeville, bands, orchestras, glee clubs, pic- 
nics, etc. The company which I represent has in oper- 
ation all of these except the relief association and 
the purchasing department. These matters have been 
under consideration for some time and it is prob- 
able that in the near future the plans will be put 
into effect. We have built a large entertainment 
hall which is free for the use of our employees. 
“A street railway system, like all other modern 
business, is constantly changing. New problems 
are continually arising and the old ones never die. 
Among those with which we are always confronted 
are problems in car construction, with improvement 
in electric motors and railway trucks, changes in 
track construction, which involve improvement in 
paving material and new kinds of road beds to- 
gether with a complete revolution in the method 
of track laying. These are only illustrations of 
the changes that are always going on. Many more 
might be named.” 
One of the partners in a large wholesale grocery 
house also writes that changes and readjustment of 
Changes in whole- ON sort or another are continu- 
sale grocery ally forced on his firm. A large 
business number of commodities which 
formerly were among their “best sellers” have been 
taken from them and are now sold directly to the
-P-A-G-E-236
  
218 LEARNING AND DOING 
consumer by the importers or manufacturers. To 
offset this loss the wholesale grocer has been obliged 
to add articles which, a few years ago, were handled 
exclusively by wholesale dry-goods houses and by 
drug and hardware firms. “To name only a few 
items, cotton gloves, hosiery, spool cotton, stable 
drugs, patent medicines, ammunition, nails, wire 
and even sewing-machines are sold by the whole- 
sale grocer.” The fact that the coffee, tea and 
spice business has in a large measure been. taken 
away from the wholesale grocer, that sugar refi- 
neries and tobacco companies are selling their goods 
directly to the retailer, and that manufacturers are 
more and more eliminating the wholesaler “has 
brought about the curious result that the wholesale 
grocer now carries a greater variety of other goods 
than he does of groceries.” All of these changes 
naturally deprived wholesale grocers of commod- 
ities with the details of which they were familiar, 
and compelled them to investigate and find a mar- 
ket for other articles to take their place. 
Again, in earlier years, the purchaser sought the 
seller, now the seller must seek the purchaser. As 
a result of this the jobber “no longer owns his 
trade. This is in a real sense the personal property 
of the salesmen who take their customers with them 
when they change from one wholesale house to 
another.” In this way a jobber may lose an en- 
tire territory in a day and then he is confronted 
with the problem of regaining it or of finding a  
-P-A-G-E-237
  
NEW DEMANDS ON SCHOOLS = 219 
new territory to take its place. “The difficulties 
of winning back the customers who have been taken 
to another house are usually insurmountable because, 
while formerly the relation between the jobber and 
retailer was a close and personal one, to-day they 
are unacquainted.” 
The changes in the woodenware business are 
startling in their explosive swiftness. The follow- 
Changes in wood- ing letter from the senior mem- 
enware business ber of one of the largest com- 
panies shows how truly “eternal vigilance is the 
price of profits.” 
“Thirty years ago,” the writer says, “when I 
entered the woodenware business it was strictly a 
jobbing proposition, selling to both wholesalers and 
retailers. Our trade was largely in items of wood 
together with many small articles known as 
‘Yankee notions,’ and brooms, the last of which was 
one of our most important articles. This continued 
for about twenty years, when a merry run of busi- 
ness changes began. First, the wholesalers through- 
out the country took the position that if we sold 
to them we must not sell to the retail trade. After 
five years of struggle we yielded. Then five years 
later the wholesalers cut us out of their business 
entirely and began to buy directly from the factory. 
“Although we had never engaged in manufac- 
turing we now saw that we must make that change 
or be left behind. Now, starting factories for many 
articles is expensive business. So we tried to look  
-P-A-G-E-238
  220 LEARNING AND DOING 
into the future and see which of our articles had 
the best prospects. Finally we selected several, 
among which were paper bags and galvanized iron 
tubs and pails that were then just beginning to 
replace the wooden articles. As a result of manu- 
facturing paper bags our sales in this item alone 
increased more than twelve times. 
“School slates, a large item in our business, gave 
way to paper tablets which we were forced to man- 
ufacture. Our sales of this one article now amount 
to about $200,000 annually. 
“These are only a few of the many changes that 
are in continual progress. Business is never sta- 
tionary. When it is the end is near. We must 
constantly watch the market and try to discover 
a little of what the future is sending us. If we 
fail in our interpretation more versatile men get 
the business.” 
These illustrations are probably enough to estab- 
lish the truth of the statements, a few pages back, 
that change is the order of the day and that the 
only certainty in business is its uncertainty. 
“Efficiency” and “scientific management,” so 
much talked of to-day, originated in the need for 
lol industrial readjustment of which How scientific ; management we have been speaking. The 
RicrEs sour simplest plan, when a manufac- 
turer finds it necessary to reduce the cost of making 
his product, is to lower wages. This requires no 
intelligence and for that reason is the common

NEW DEMANDS ON SCHOOLS 221 
method. ‘Taylor, however, has found* that effi- 
ciency, which is synonymous with low labor cost, 
pays higher wages, and the investigations of N. 
I. Stone, formerly Chief Statistician of the Tariff 
Board, support this view. “Almost invariably the 
(woolen) mills paying higher wages per hour 
showed lower costs than their competitors with 
lower wages. Thus, in wool scouring the lowest 
average wages paid to machine operatives in the 
thirty mills examined was found to be 12.16 cents 
per hour, and the highest 17.79. Yet the low wage 
mill showed a labor cost of twenty-one cents per 
hundred pounds of wool, while the higher wage 
mill had a cost of only fifteen cents per hundred.” 
Again, “in the carding departments of seventeen 
worsted mills, the mill paying its machine-opera- 
tives an average wage of 13.18 cents per hour had 
a machine labor cost of four cents per hundred 
pounds, while the mill paying its machine-opera- 
tives only 11.86 cents per hour, had a cost of 
twenty-five cents per hundred pounds.” 
Even more astounding was the inefficiency 
found in the carding departments of twenty-six 
woolen mills. “The mill with the 
highest machine output per man 
per hour, namely 57.7 pounds, had a machine-labor 
cost of twenty-three cents per hundred pounds, 
while the mill with a machine output of only six

pounds per operative per hour had a cost of $1.64 
per hundred pounds. Yet this mill, with a cost 
seventeen times higher than the other, paid its op- 
eratives only 9.86 cents per hour, as against 13.09 
cents per hour paid by its more successful com- 
petitor.” 
Taylor found on investigating the unscientific 
act of shoveling that the same shovel was used 
Aresult of inefi- for iron ore as for rice coal. In

shoveled a load of thirty pounds and in the latter 
four pounds, an absurdity on the face of it. Yet 
this inefficient method had been employed for years 
without attracting the attention of the foremen or 
of the educated managers in the office.

months following, “the saving was at the rate of 
between $75,000 and $80,000 per year”; and the 
workmen were earning higher wages. 
Whatever else may be included in the meaning 
of efficiency it is evident from the concrete evi- 
Education for dence on every side that versa- 
efficiency tility—capacity for new adapta- 
tions and the ability to see a little way ahead and 
to employ one’s knowledge in solving problems that 
arise—must not be omitted. The really needful 
thing is to train children to be efficient rather than 
   
-P-A-G-E-241
  NEW DEMANDS ON SCHOOLS 223 
to find jobs for them for which they are not fitted. 
This is the way in which the Commissioner sum- 
marizes a recent report on vocational training* pub- 
lished by the United States Bureau of Education. 
As to the method of training for efficiency, the 
way is not so uncertain if we may judge from the 
Successful human documents, given in the 
methods first chapter, of the men who 
have tried to analyze their boyhood feelings, and 
from the experimental organizations for group- 
work which have been cited. The motive power is 
given in the racial impulses which drive children 
with irresistible force to action. The problem is 
then simplified. The teacher does not need to cre- 
ate interest in the work. Enough enthusiasm is 
present in every school to furnish power to run 
a hundred educational plants. The teacher’s func- 
tion is to divert this flow of racial energy into 
social and industrial channels. How this may be 
done has been indicated by the experiments of ear- 
lier chapters. We have seen that children want to 
do things for themselves. What they do and what 
they manage does not matter much as far as the 
available energy is concerned. They must feel, 
however, that the work is theirs, that they are re- 
sponsible for it and that the glory of its success 
is theirs. 
In striving to produce versatility, however, it is

Bureau of Education, 1913.

224 LEARNING AND DOING 
important that children engage in activities which 
have not been mechanized with rules. This is pio- 
neering and pioneers work their way through un- 
known obstacles overcoming difficulties as they 
arise. Under these conditions real problems exist 
—problems that relish because no one, not even 
the teacher, knows the solution. The uncertainty 
of such problems or situations gives the flavor of 
adventure which answers a call of youth and 
awakens zeal for achievement. The problems of 
the school are usually artificial constructions. The 
children are aware that the teacher knows their 
solution and this deprives them of the impelling 
force that incites to action in the real difficulties 
of the outside world. In earlier chapters we have 
shown how some teachers have tried to produce 
living problems in their school. 
This gives the cue for making children intelli- 
gent, constructive workers instead of submissive 
Originality and followers. Versatility and _ effi- 
efficiency ciency are not the offspring of 
imitation. Originality is needed and this quality 
of mind is acquired only in an environment that 
encourages its growth. The crude matrix from 
which initiative may develop we have found in the 
instincts for group-action, workmanship and plan- 
ning, but their application to social ends must be 
learned by the individual through acts stimulated 
by his desire to work out definite social projects. 
Contriving conditions which shall inevitably arouse  
-P-A-G-E-243
NEW. DEMANDS ON SCHOOLS 225 
in children the impulse to meet difficulties by plans 
which they themselves originate raises teachers to 
their proper sphere of action, that of guide and 
helper instead of driver. 
Children, in managing situations thus created, 
are learning to interpret conditions that arise and 
are developing a versatility that 
prepares them to meet similar 
problems in the larger outside world where ex- 
perience is dearer and failure more disastrous. In 
a school thus organized the pupils are dealing with 
situations of actual life instead of with the arti- 
ficial conditions fabricated by traditional peda- 
gogy. They learn to devise ways and means of 
overcoming obstacles and they profit from their 
mistakes. This is training in versatility, and it is 
quite different from having the school life laid out 
in assignments, rules and prohibitions. According 
to the usual method the teacher plans the work and 
the pupils regulate the amount of energy they put 
into it with marvelous nicety by the “passing mark.” 
This is the most prominent standard of excellence 
and so the children adapt their attainments to it. 
The stimulus for a high grade of efficiency, which 
we have found in organized group-work, is absent. 
There is no incentive to versatility because con- 
formity to the common type is popular. Whatever 
intellectual competition there may be is on a low 
level and mediocrity is not a stimulating environ- 
ment for the production of versatile minds. Conclusion
-P-A-G-E-244
    
226 LEARNING AND DOING 
When, on the other hand, schools are organized 
into groups of pupils banded together for purposes 
which the children themselves have conceived, with 
the aid of tactful suggestions from their teachers, 
they are alert to excel, to produce something new, 
to be different from their fellows. This is a fertile 
environment for versatility and efficiency. Each 
one has a plan to offer to meet the difficulties that 
arise in achieving what they have set themselves 
to do. The enthusiasm of the many stirs the few 
laggards. Laziness is at a discount and work at 
a premium. The children learn by doing because 
those who accomplish things are held in high es- 
teem among their companions. The standard. to 
which the pupils make their adaptation is achieve- 
ment which never lets them rest satisfied. The 
customary method seeks to train children for adult 
life. The plan here urged trains them in living 
while they are yet in school.

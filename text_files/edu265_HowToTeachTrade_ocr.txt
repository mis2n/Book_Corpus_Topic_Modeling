  PREFACE 
a. THE preparation of this plan for teaching 
a trade the aim has been to avoid obscure and 
indefinite pedagogical terms and to present in 
plain language a simple and effective plan 
without elaborate or complicated machinery. 
In that portion of the book devoted to the 
preparation of the material for instruction in the 
trade a very simple and direct plan is proposed. 
It consists of an analysis or examination of the 
trade in order to secure a list of the things one 
must be able to do and a list of the things one 
must know in order to be proficient in the trade. 
These are kept as separate lists because one rep- 
resents skill and the other information. 
In addition to the things one must be able 
to do and the information he must have, there 
are certain problems in science, mathematics, 
drawing, and in the business side of the trade 
which the proficient worker must be able to solve. 
These three phases of trade training are con- 
sidered separately because they require different 
methods for effective teaching. For example, 
skill is best acquired by following closely the laws 
3

of habit formation, while information is best 
acquired by a direct statement of fact in connec- 
tion with its application in a real problem. 
These three phases of the training, however, in 
a broad sense, constitute only the “tools of the 
trade.” The ability to use skill and information 
effectively on a real job is the test of the 
mechanic. Skill of hand may be acquired by prac- 
tice on exercises, information may be acquired 
from the printed page or word of mouth, but the 
practical application of these things on a real 
job is the only way to develop the resourceful- 
ness, self-reliance and the planning ability which 
distinguishes the real mechanic. We, therefore, 
recognize four distinct phases of training. 
1. The things one must be able to do, which 
represent skill. 
2. The things one must know, which repre- 
sent information. 
3. The problems one must solve, which rep- 
represent the calculations one must make. 
4. The practical application of these on real 
jobs. 
The ability to use skill and information effec- 
tively on a real job represents a development of 
a vastly higher order than the mere acquisition 
of skill or the accumulation of facts, and an ade- 
quate provision must be made for such training.
-P-A-G-E-5
  
PREFACE 5 
The latter portion of the book discusses 
methods of presentation. It shows how instruc- 
tion may be given on practical jobs without 
encountering what hitherto has been regarded as 
almost insurmountable difficulties, such as waste 
of material, damage to equipment, accident, etc. 
A plan of instruction is presented which, if 
followed, places an inescapable responsibility 
where it belongs and gives a number of points 
where the teacher may check accurately the prog- 
ress of the student. 
The book is intended for the use of teachers 
and men in industry who are interested in a 
simple and direct method of instruction free from 
mysticism and make-believe. 
The author desires to make special acknowl- 
edgment to the group of distinguished men who 
assisted him in developing this plan of trade 
instruction for the United States army.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
— plan here outlined was developed in 
connection with the vocational training of 
soldiers in the United States army. So persist- 
ent has been the demand for more information 
concerning the principles upon which this work 
was organized that this brief outline of the plan 
is submitted to those interested in trade educa- 
tion. 
It is to be regretted that conditions made it 
impossible to continue the work of the able corps 
of men employed to prepare the trade manuals 
under this plan. Manuals for twenty-two trades 
were partially completed, but this work has not 
been available to the general public. 
1. Operations of a Trade.—The plan is a 
very simple one. It seems perfectly obvious that 
the first step in teaching a trade is to make a 
list of the things a man must know and must be 
able to do in order to be proficient in his trade. 
This is a list of the things we must teach him 
and it constitutes an analysis of the trade. 
u
-P-A-G-E-12
12 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
2. Performing Operations.—Having listed 
these operations of the trade, specific and con- 
cise directions are given for performing the oper- 
ations. These directions are followed by ques- 
tions designed to direct the attention of the 
student to the reasons for performing the opera- 
tions in the way indicated and to the important 
points covered in the references. 
3. Related Trade Information.—Informa- 
tion on certain topics is necessary for the suc- 
cessful worker. Therefore, a list of information 
topics is prepared. Under each of these topics 
is set down definitely, briefly, and without dis- 
cussion, the important facts under that head. 
These are followed by a series of questions 
intended to arouse interest and serve as a guide 
in reading. 
Another phase of the training dealt with is 
that involving problems in science and mathe- 
matics which arise frequently in the trade. These 
problems the proficient worker must be able to 
solve. He must be given sufficient practice to 
enable him to proceed with confidence to their 
solution when they arise. 
4. Organizing Materials of Instruction.— 
The organization of the material of instruction 
along the lines indicated permits the handling 
of any kind of practical jobs with the same
-P-A-G-E-13
    
INTRODUCTION 13 
degree of ease and the same efficient and syste- 
matic instruction that can be given on exercises 
or standard projects. At the same time, it solves 
the serious difficulties which always have con- 
fronted the teacher who wished to have his stu- 
dents engage in practical work. 
The student can be given his job, or problem, 
and all necessary data, and be required to analyze, 
plan and execute his job. He is given more, and 
more is required of him than in any other plan 
of instruction. 
5. Virtues of This Plan.—The plan does not 
provide a royal road to learning. The chief 
virtues claimed for it are that: 
1. It states the problem definitely. 
2. It distinguishes between, and deals sep- 
arately with, those phases of instruction 
involving habit formation and those 
involving information and thought. 
3. It supplies to the student, in accessible 
form, the information and directions 
necessary for doing the work. 
4. The analysis of the trade gives the basis 
and method for analyzing and planning 
any job within the trade. . 
5. It requires the student to analyze and 
definitely plan his job before he begins 
work on it. 
6. It enables the class, or the individuals 
of the class, to handle any kind of a  
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
practical job, within the range of their 
ability, and at the same time to get the 
utmost of educational value from it. 
7. It reveals to the student his own capaci- 
ties and offers an excellent method of 
developing in him the habit of carefully 
analyzing and planning any piece of 
work before beginning to do it. 
8. It puts the material of instruction in 
such form that it greatly reduces the 
time required for daily preparation and 
demonstration by the instructor. 
9. It preserves all the advantages of both 
individual and class instruction and pro- 
vides for individual progress. 
10. It enables a new student to enter a class 
at any time without waiting for a new 
class to be formed. 
6. Specific Field Covered.—The plan was 
devised for trade training and not for the man- 
ual training, technical, or industrial high schools. 
While the general plan of organizing the material 
and the method of giving instruction apply with 
equal force, the point of emphasis is somewhat 
different. In trade training a high degree of 
skill in all of the operations of the trade is a 
fundamental aim. The aim in high school work 
is the ability to analyze and plan a job and to 
acquire a sufficient skill to enable one to perform 
the most frequently used operations of the trade
-P-A-G-E-15
  INTRODUCTION 15 
in a way that will suffice in an emergency, but 
which may fall short of the standard of the 
skilled mechanic in both quality and finish. In 
one case information, thought, and a high degree 
of skill are the requisites; in the other informa- 
tion, thought, and a relatively low degree of skill 
meet all requirements. The essential thing in 
either case is that we know definitely and specific- 
ally what we are trying to do.
-P-A-G-E-16
  CHAPTER II 
THE SKILLED WoRKER AND THE SKILLED 
MECHANIC 
7. The Skilled Worker.—The worker in the 
modern manufacturing plant may be called, very 
properly, a skilled workman, or specialist, but 
he is not a skilled mechanic. He possesses a high 
degree of skill within the range of his task, but 
the range is only a fraction of the range of the 
work of the mechanic. His skill is intensive but 
not extensive. His responsibilities are small as 
compared with the responsibilities of the skilled 
mechanic. In the more highly organized plants 
his jobs are analyzed and planned for him and 
every detail listed in the order in which it is to 
be performed. In so far as possible every 
thought process is eliminated and, ideally, he 
becomes the embodiment of manipulative skill in 
the one small unit of production. The range of 
the operations is so limited, the order in which 
they come so fixed, and the repetition so frequent, 
that the process tends to become automatic. Day 
after day, year after year, he performs over and 
16
-P-A-G-E-17
  SKILLED WORKER, SKILLED MECHANIC 17 
over again the same small operation, which is but 
one step in the production of an article. To him 
this minute step is the beginning and the end. It 
may be the trimming of a shoe heel or the grind- 
ing of the wrist pin of an engine, but the doing of 
this one small job becomes his vocation. He may 
be transferred to other tasks at times, and he may 
be taught another of the multitude of steps in 
the production of the article, but, whatever the 
step, it is a unit in itself and, in the very nature 
of the organization, this new process becomes his 
vocation. His responsibility is limited to the 
particular operation or job and the work is so 
arranged as to call for the least possible initia- 
tive, resourcefulness, judgment, or thought on 
his part. Definite instructions are given as to 
tolerance, finish, etc., and he proceeds with the 
production of his small fragment of the finished 
article without thought of, or concern for, the 
larger constructive problems involved in the pro- 
duction of the article as a whole. 
Rarely do the jobs or operations of a factory 
involve the entire range of any skilled trade. 
Since they do = obvious that a worker 
might be able to perform all of the operations 
or jobs in a given factory and not be a skilled 
mechanic. |This is the basis for the statement 
we so often hear that “There is no such thing 
2 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  
18 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
as a skilled trade any more.” Men who say this 
are thinking only of factory production. 
8. Difference Between Skilled Worker and 
Skilled Tradesman.—As a result of our methods 
of factory production, and the effort on the part 
of organized labor to establish the closed shop, 
the tendency is to regard the more important and 
highly skilled factory operations as constituting 
a skilled trade. The line of demarkation may 
be somewhat obscure in certain instances, but in 
general a man should not be regarded as a skilled 
mechanic who performs only a few of the opera- 
tions of a trade, however great the skill required 
for those operations.’ The lathe operator is not 
a machinist nor should he be regarded as a skilled 
mechanic, although he undoubtedly is a skilled 
worker. | He may possess even a greater skill on 
the lathe than the skilled mechanic, but his range 
is limited to the one machine. The man who 
has learned to lay hardwood floors only, can not 
by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as 
a carpenter, or a skilled mechanic, although he 
may be able to do this particular work with 
greater dispatch and a higher degree of skill 
than the carpenter would do it. The tendency 
to break up the skilled trades into small units in 
which beginners may engage before having a 
general training in the trade produces the skilled  
-P-A-G-E-19
  SKILLED WORKER, SKILLED MECHANIC 19 
worker of narrow range and has been the most 
important factor in reducing the number of thor- 
oughly skilled mechanics. 
9. The Skilled Worker a Product of Fac- 
tory System.—The skilled worker, that is, the 
worker highly skilled in a few operations, is the 
result of the division of labor and of our factory 
system. One of the most fundamental elements 
of factory production is the division of labor 
which, in effect, means that the production of an 
article is separated into a number of operations, 
each assigned to separate workers. Thus the 
production of one small unit of an article becomes 
the job of the worker and the factory product 
is the result of the completion of a series of 
jobs. Such an organization gives the enormous 
quantity production of the American factory, but 
for the worker it means the narrowing of his 
vocation to a single specialized operation and 
gives him no place in industry save his one task. 
A compensating factor for the worker, however, 
is that usually only a short period of training is 
required for a job, and if a change is necessary, 
he can learn a new operation in a relatively short 
time. This gives a very flexible labor supply 
and enables us to survive our large labor turn- 
over. 
10. Who Is a Skilled Mechanic?—“Skilled
-P-A-G-E-20
    
20 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
Mechanic” is a royal title in the world of labor. 
To be worthy of such a title a man must be 
master of all of the processes of his trade. How- 
ever intricate the job he must be able to analyze 
it and plan a method of procedure in doing it. 
He must be able to read the drawings and speci- 
fications for jobs connected with his trade and 
be able to perform all of the manipulative opera- 
tions in-a_skillful manner,/ He must be able to 
make the necessary calculations required in the 
practice of his trade, and he must know the 
scientific facts which underly it. He must be a 
thoughtful, resourceful, and self-reliant man—a 
master in the broad field of his trade. 
11. Training the Skilled Worker.—It should 
be recognized at the beginning that the training 
of these two types of workers constitutes two 
distinct problems. In one case we are training 
a man for a specific job and in the other we 
are training him for any job that falls within 
the range of his trade. In the first case we must 
analyze the job into its processes or steps and 
arrange the steps in the order in which they are 
to be performed. This is necessary if we would 
teach quickly and effectively the performance of 
the job. This analysis and plan for doing the 
job constitutes the subject-matter of instruction 
for the skilled worker. It covers his vocation,   
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  SKILLED WORKER, SKILLED MECHANIC 21 
and, instructed in this, he is ready to proceed in 
the endless repetition of his task. 
Such is the vocational training required of the 
skilled worker by modern industry, and it is the 
kind of training it gives. Such training is nar- 
row and meager. It is directed entirely toward 
production and is adequate from that standpoint. 
From the standpoint of the citizen of a republic 
who has a voice in determining the policy of the 
nation and whose conduct affects other mem- 
bers of society, it is entirely inadequate. 
The manufacturer should not be condemned 
because he emphasizes production. Production 
is his business. Training for citizenship is the 
business of society, and while effective produc- 
tion, within the ability of the individual, is an 
essential element of good citizenship, the prob- 
lems of training are quite distinct. 
12. Training the Skilled Mechanic.—The 
problem of training the skilled mechanic is one 
of much greater magnitude than that of training 
the skilled worker. It is important that we 
analyze the job and list the operations involved 
in order that we may train quickly and efficiently 
the skilled worker. It is vastly more important 
that we analyze the trade and list the operations 
and information involved in order that we may 
train quickly the skilled mechanic. His work
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
covers much greater range. He must be able 
to perform in a skillful manner all of the opera- 
tions of his trade in whatever combinations they 
occur. He also must have the information and 
scientific facts necessary in planning and carrying 
out successfully any job that falls within his 
trade. A list of these things constitutes the 
subject-matter of instruction—the things he must 
know and must be able to do. 
13. Preliminary Qualifications.—It is under- 
stood, of course, that there are certain minimum 
requirements for entrance into training for a 
trade. These requirements are sometimes educa- 
tional, sometimes physical, frequently both. 
They do not properly constitute a part of the 
trade training, but represent the starting point. 
Since the requirements differ for the different 
trades it is necessary to have a statement of the 
requirements for each trade in order that we may 
know just where to start with our instruction. 
For example, would one entering training for the 
millinery trade be expected to know how to do 
plain hand sewing? Would one entering training 
for the carpentry trade be expected to know the 
multiplication table or to be able to read the 
graduations on the framing square to 16ths? It 
is obvious that we must know definitely where 
we are to start in order that we may know what
-P-A-G-E-23
  SKILLED WORKER, SKILLED MECHANIC 23 
to include in the instruction for the trade. There 
are many factors, such as age and experience, that 
might modify these requirements, but there should 
be some well-defined starting point.- 
   
-P-A-G-E-24
  CHAPTER III 
Tue ANALYSIS OF THE TRADE 
14. Need for Analysis.—In order to teach a 
trade successfully, we must have a clear notion 
of what is required of the mechanic whose trade 
we would teach. Every important item in the 
trade must be known and listed. The teacher 
who does not have such a list is likely to go far 
astray and waste much valuable time even though 
he be highly skilled in the trade. 
Such a list is called “fhe Analysis of the 
pee) It consists of the things one must know 
and must be able to do in order to be proficient 
in the trade. One part of this,analysis is a list 
of the distinct processes involved in doing the 
work of the trade. Every operation of the trade 
involving skill or requiring instruction should be 
listed. The unskilled or low skilled operations 
need not be listed, as these may be performed by 
any person of ordinary intelligence with little 
or no instruction or practice. 
15. Unit Operations.—The items of such a 
list constitute the units, or unit operations of the 
trade. These unit operations usually correspond 
24  
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE ANALYSIS OF THE TRADE 25 
to the successive aims of the worker while doing 
the job. An accurate definition is not necessary, 
but for the sake of those who like definitions the 
following is submitted: “A unit operation of a 
trade is an operation which requires some degree 
of skill in its performance. It occurs with more 
or less frequency in the practice of the trade and 
involves practically the same steps in its per- 
formance wherever it is found. Any group of 
steps occurring frequently, as a group, in the 
work of any trade may be regarded as a unit 
operation. All jobs are made up of one or more 
of these operations.” 
In construction work there are unit operations 
involving more than tool operations. These 
operations require skill in putting material 
together in such a way that the desired result is 
obtained. They occur frequently in some trades 
and usually involve one or more of the minor 
manipulative operations of the trade. These 
units are, in reality, standardized jobs, occurring 
so frequently, and with such uniformity of pro- 
cesses involved, that they should be treated as 
operations. 
16. Analysis of Trade, Not Jobs.—Very few 
trades can be analyzed on the basis of jobs. It 
is not practicable to list all the jobs that may 
occur in a skilled trade. Even if it were possible
-P-A-G-E-26
26 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
to do so it would be necessary to analyze each 
job into the processes involved in doing it, in 
order to teach the job. Since every conceivable 
job is made up of the operations of the trade, in 
various combinations, the simplest method of 
procedure is to analyze the trade for the opera- 
tions involved and use this analysis as the basis 
of analyzing and teaching any job that may 
arise. This trade analysis is in reality the basis 
of all job analysis. No job can be analyzed 
except in terms of the operations of the trade 
or vocation. 
17. Who Can Analyze a Trade?—Analyzing 
a trade is best done by a man with a well-trained, 
analytical mind. This man should work with a 
skilled mechanic. One will furnish the informa- 
tion, the other will aid in classifying it. The 
work must be of the simplest and most straight- 
forward character, and entirely informal. Any 
attempt to appear learned or scientific is fatal. 
It is a plain, prosaic job of writing down a list 
of the things one must be able to do in order to 
be proficient in the trade. 
The start is difficult. Write down a few of 
the operations and examine them closely. As 
these are studied they will be revised and supple- 
mented. Finally, when the list is fairly complete, 
examine a number of jobs in the trade to see if
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE ANALYSIS OF THE TRADE 2 
they contain any operations not listed. At any 
time an unlisted operation is discovered it should 
be added to the list. 
18. Analysis without Reference to Order.— 
The purpose in analyzing a trade is to discover 
and list the things to be taught, but neither rela~ 
tive difficulty nor teaching order need be con- 
sidered in making the list. It is safe to say that 
in case of more than half the operations of a 
trade, it is impossible to determine which opera- 
tion is the most difficult to perform. It is also 
true that an operation might be difficult for one 
person and easy for another. In practice the easy 
and the difficult come together. 
The list of operations cannot be arranged in 
the order in which the operations are to be taught 
unless we wish to teach them entirely on the basis 
of a series of exercises. This is precisely what we 
should not wish to do. If the list were arranged 
to fit a series of exercises it would be 
found out of order for the first practical job. 
For example, one job might involve operations 
1, 4, 5 and 6, and another job might involve the 
same operations but in a different order as 1, 6, 
4 and 5. Another job might involve all of these 
and a number of additional operations. It will 
be seen, therefore, that the jobs of the trade will
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
involve a vast number of combinations of opera- 
tions as well as a great variety in the order in 
which they come. 
We have an accepted order for the letters of 
the alphabet, but the arrangement was not made 
because of the “teaching order” nor because of 
the order in which the letters appear in words. 
That would be quite impossible. The list of oper- 
ations is the alphabet of the trade. Jobs are made 
up of a combination of these operations just as 
words are made up of the combinations of the 
letters of the alphabet and with the same lack of 
consideration for the order in which they appear 
in the list. 
19. Operations in Plumbing Trade.—The 
following is a fairly complete list of the opera- 
tions involved in the plumbing trade: 
Unit OPERATIONS 
. Making plan and layout sketch. 
. Making bill of material and tools needed 
for the job. 
Digging trench. 
. Laying tile sewers.

On an examination of the list it will be seen 
that a number of these operations require very 
little skill and may be quickly learned. The fail- 
ure to appreciate this fact leads to a large waste 
of time in trade training. Apprentices are kept 
on jobs involving only a low degree of skill long 
after they have become proficient in these simple 
operations. 
20. Topics of Information.—The ability of a 
man to perform, in a skillful manner, the opera- 
tions of the trade is not a sufficient basis for 
classifying him as a skilled mechanic. There are 
things he must know, and he must be able to 
think and plan. He must know the reasons for 
doing things in certain ways. etm have the 
information and facts of science that affect or 
underly the practice of his trade. It is the kind 
of information necessary in planning. These con- 
stitute the Topics of Information and are the 
things the worker must know. T! He unit opera- 
tions are the things he must be able to do.  
-P-A-G-E-31
THE ANALYSIS OF THE TRADE 31 
The “Unit Operations” and the “Topics of 
Information” should be listed and treated sep- 
arately. This is desirable because it only con- 
fuses a learner to impose upon him a theoretical 
discussion when he should be giving his undi- 
vided attention to the establishment of fixed 
habits of doing a thing economically and effec- 
tively. Skill is only a thoroughly established 
habit of doing a thing in the most economical 
way. To establish a habit, attention and repeti- 
tion are necessary. Anything that distracts the 
attention from the manipulative process or inter- 
feres with its repetition, until the point is reached 
where fatigue affects muscular control, is delay- 
ing the development of skill. When a boy is 
doing something in which he is establishing good 
‘habits of work, he should not be interrupted in 
order to give him some uninteresting and often 
valueless fact. It may be a good way to teach 
the fact, but it is a poor way to form the habit. 
The practice of trying to tack theory onto a 
manipulative process is so pernicious when applied 
to the development of skill, or the formation of 
habit, that it should be strongly condemned, 
When learning to drive an automobile no one 
would care to have the instructor sit by him and 
give him a lecture on the principles of the lever 
and the worm gear. There is a time for theory,
-P-A-G-E-32
32 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
but it is not when you are trying to establish a 
habit. 
There is another reason for separating the unit 
operations from the topics of information. The 
principles, or information, belong with jobs and 
not with operations. For example, friction as 
involved in the flow of water through pipes is 
important in connection with a jo of installing a 
water supply, but it has no relation whatever to a 
job of putting up a pipe hand rail, although the 
pipe fitting in both jobs involves the same opera- 
tions. The topics of information are therefore 
listed separately to be used and taught at any 
time a job is to be done that requires any of this 
information. 
The following is a fairly comp lete list of the 
topics of information in the plumbing trade. The 
list becomes an index which enables one to refer 
readily to the desired topic:

-P-A-G-E-37
  CHAPTER IV 
THE UNIT OPERATION 
The analysis of the trade, as we have seen 
in the preceding chapter, gives us the definite 
and specific subject matter to be taught. Our 
problem now is to develop the most effective 
method of teaching it. 
23. Unit Operation a Unit of Instruction.— 
It should be remembered throughout this dis- 
cussion that the unit operation is not to be 
regarded as an isolated process or operation to 
be taught only as an exercise. Exercises are val- 
uable for preliminary practice, but the operations 
should be taught also as they occur in the jobs 
of the trade, because in that way the student 
sees their practical application and limitation, and 
has all the advantages that come from practical 
work plus the advantage of systematic instruc- 
tion. The operation is simply a convenient unit 
of instruction in any job in which it occurs. 
Under the old exercise method of teaching, 
the exercises were selected because they involved 
certain processes or principles. When a series 
37
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
of jobs is selected with the same purpose in view, 
the difference is greater in name than in fact. 
Listing a series of jobs a man must do in order 
to become a skilled mechanic has little advantage 
over the old list of exercises. Under such a plan, 
the tendency is for the job to become as formal 
and as isolated from the real spirit and setting 
of a production job as the old exercises were. 
Our purpose is not to teach how to do a series 
of exercises or a series of jobs, but rather to 
teach a man the things that will enable him to do 
any job that falls within the scope of the trade. 
He must be able to perform any of the operations 
of the trade in a skillful manner, in a great 
variety of jobs, and wherever they occur. 
Neither a set series of exercises nor a set series 
of jobs can give the variety of circumstances 
and conditions necessary for an adequate training 
in the trade. We must, therefore, devise a 
scheme that is flexible enough to apply to any 
job, and one which will enable us to recognize 
quickly the teaching units or operations involved. 
24. Value of Practice Work.—Much time 
and material may be saved by giving the beginner 
practice work on exercises involving the more 
difficult operations of the trade until he has 
acquired sufficient skill and understanding of the 
operation to enable him to perform it in a way
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE UNIT OPERATION 39 
that will be acceptable on a real job. Further 
practice on the job will add to his skill and 
speed and give him a broader understanding of 
his work. Where all work is on exercises little 
progress in real trade training can be made, but 
where the exercise is used for preliminary instruc- 
tion it will result in an economy of time and an 
increase of skill, provided the student fully real- 
izes the purpose of such practice. He must 
understand that he is trying to Jearn something, 
not trying to make something. He must regard 
the exercises only as means of practice in the 
control of his tools just as the baseball pitcher 
regards his practice as the preparation for a 
real game and not as an end in itself. The 
pitcher repeats his throw thousands of times in 
order that he may have “control” at the critical 
moment. Likewise, the man who aspires to be 
a good mechanic must practice in order that he 
may gain quickly, and at a minimum cost, the 
“control” which will enable him to perform the 
difficult tasks of the trade. There is no good 
reason why preliminary practice for a real job 
should be regarded as highly important for the 
baseball pitcher and as a pedagogical blunder 
when required of the man who would learn a 
trade. 
“Making exercises” is inexcusable. Prelimi-
-P-A-G-E-40
    40 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
nary practice work to develop control of tools 
and a familiarity with materials is highly desir- 
able. Speed, freedom of movement, good form 
and accuracy must be insisted upon. This is of 
utmost importance. They are the essential ele- 
ments in the habits we wish to form. Accuracy 
is no less important than speed, but speed (not 
haste) is the road to accuracy and pride in work- 
manship. Accuracy is the ideal which must ever 
be held in mind. Speed is one of the elements 
in its attainment. Speed is a matter of habit. 
Accuracy is an ideal. It is not a matter of choos- 
ing between them. We should have both, and 
the surest way of getting them is to insist upon 
form, speed and freedom of movement first. In 
order that they may be emphasized we are justi- 
fied in doing practice work where they are the 
only considerations and where failure does not 
mean waste. The student whose hand is 
restrained by fear that he will spoil a valuable 
piece of material, injure himself, or damage a 
tool or a machine will not quickly acquire skill 
in the operations of a trade. No man with fear 
in his heart can be a master. 
We should not make a fetish of either the 
“job” or of the “practice work” in teaching a 
trade. Each has its place and neither, alone, is 
entirely satisfactory. Practice on the job is
-P-A-G-E-41
    THE UNIT OPERATION 41 
necessary in order that the student may see the 
various operations in their relations to each other, 
understand the working requirements, learn how 
to look at a job and see what is to be done, and 
learn how to plan his work. The practice work 
is to develop speed, freedom of movement and 
accuracy with a minimum waste of time and 
material. Where the work is on a very small unit 
as in some manufacturing, and the waste from 
error would not be large, work on practice pieces 
may be dispensed with. Practice work should 
not be continued beyond the point where the 
student can proceed to a practical job with con- 
fidence and a reasonable assurance of success. 
When the purpose of the practice work is kept in 
mind the extent of it may be determined readily. 
25. Production and Instruction.—The ques- 
tion of production should not be confused with 
the problem of instruction. The production of 
a marketable article may afford the best means 
of giving instruction, but it should be borne in 
mind that the characteristics of the final product 
do not always determine the effectiveness of 
instruction. 
In preparing the instructions for the unit oper- 
ations, definite and positive directions should be 
written out for each step. These steps should 
be arranged in the order in which they would
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
ordinarily come in performing the operation. 
Be exact. Leave no room for doubt. Do not 
debate the matter. If there are two or more 
accepted ways of performing the operation, select 
what is regarded as the best practice and describe 
each step so simply and so clearly that anyone 
who can read can understand. Drawings and 
illustrations may be necessary; if so, use them 
freely. 
26. Two Ways of Approach.—We have but 
two methods of making clear to the student what 
is required—telling and showing. One is some- 
times dignified by the term “lecture method” and 
the other “demonstration method.” Many of 
the skilled operations of the trade are so intri- 
cate that language alone is inadequate to describe 
them. In such cases it is necessary to resort to 
the drawing or the demonstration, or both, in 
order to make the instructions clear to the 
beginner. The real purpose of the “lecture and 
demonstration” is to state the problem to the 
learner—to tell him what he is to do and how 
he is to do it. This should be done as plainly, 
as briefly, as directly, and as systematically as 
possible. 
27. Assignment of References—At the 
beginning of the instruction sheet should be 
listed one or two of the best available references
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE UNIT OPERATION 43 
on how to perform this operation. The page and 
section should be given. Make the reference as 
exact and as brief as possible in order that the 
student may find it readily when he needs it. 
This is not the time to develop the “research 
habit.” We do well if we get the worker to 
read a specific reference. 
If he is in immediate need of information in 
order to finish a job, and we tell him the informa- 
tion can be found in a certain book, but do not 
tell him where, he rightly resents it. He is intent 
on a specific problem and does not wish to be 
interrupted by being forced to solve a new one. 
There is a time to teach a man how to find infor- 
mation in books, but it is not when he is intent 
on performing a manipulative operation. It is 
very exasperating to have someone ask us ques- 
tions when we are engaged in performing an 
intricate or difficult task. 
28. Questions Covering Assignment.—Fol- 
lowing the list of explicit directions for perform- 
ing the operation should be a list of questions 
dealing with the operation. These questions 
should not deal with how the operation 
is performed, for that has been told; they 
should deal with why the operation is performed 
in that way rather than in some other way. Such 
questions help to fix the ideal in the mind of
-P-A-G-E-44
44 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
the worker, and help him to meet a situation 
where new conditions require a modification of 
the method of procedure. These questions 
should not be raised while the worker is engaged 
in his efforts to acquire skill, but after he has 
had some experience in following the directions, 
and then at a period of rest when he can give 
the questions his entire attention. 
If there is any special danger or hazard con- 
nected with an operation it should be particularly 
mentioned on the operation sheet. 
The following examples should serve to make 
clear the character of the operation sheet, and 
to act as a guide in the preparation of others. 
The first is an operation involved in many trades.

. Unclamp the tailstock and with the 
tailstock-adjusting screws, (See Fig. 4) 
move upper part of the tailstock until 
the zero lines on its end are exactly in 
line. This alignment usually is suf- 
ficiently accurate for roughing cuts or 
where the work is to be finished by 
grinding.

5. Place a piece of paper between the end 
of the tool holder and the test bar and 
adjust the cross feed until the tool 
holder presses the paper enough that it 
resists slightly a light pull. Move the 
tool holder to the other end of the bar 
without changing the cross feed, and see 
if the pull on the paper is the same. 
. If pull is not the same, adjust the tail- 
stock to what you judge is the proper 
amount and test again. Do this until 
the pull on the paper is the same at 
both ends of the bar. 
. Another accurate method is to mount a 
test bar between centers.

the tailstock and trying indicator until 
it does not vary appreciably throughout 
the length of the test bar. 
Questions: 
1, What advantage, if any, has a bar ten 
or twelve inches long over one one-half

in the diameter of the ends of the piece 
of work, how much is the tailstock out 
of line? 
6. Would a steel scale do as well as paper 
for testing center? Why? 
33. Value of Operation Sheet.—There are 
certain obvious advantages in having all of the 
operations of a trade written up in this manner. 
It does not replace entirely oral instructions and 
demonstrations to a class, but it greatly reduces 
the necessity for such instruction. As a matter 
of fact, in trade instruction, we rarely have an 
entire class engaged on the same operations at 
the same time. This is especially true where 
practical work is being done. These sheets, if 
well prepared, will prove adequate for most of 
the workers and this gives the teacher more time 
for individual instructions and demonstration. 
The sheets also form a ready reference in case 
some difficulties are encountered in the perform- 
ance of the task. 
A group of these sheets, representing the 
operations involved in the job, gives complete 
instruction for performing the job.

for preparing an operation sheet the following 
may be pointed out: 
1. Give two of the best available references. 
Give page and section. 
2. Give definite and brief directions for 
each step in performing the operation. 
These should be listed in the order of 
procedure. 
3. Ask questions with a view of producing 
a thinking mechanic. Let questions deal 
with why operations are performed in a 
certain way. Do not mix questions of 
theory with questions of operations.

CHAPTER V 
Topics oF INFORMATION 
The skilled mechanic must be more than a 
mere operator. Skill in manipulation is an essen- 
tial part of his training, but it is by no means 
the whole of it. The distinction between the 
high-grade mechanic and the low-grade workman 
does not lie entirely in the difference in the ability 
of the two men to perform the manipulative 
processes of the trade. A low-grade carpenter 
may be able to saw quite as well as the foreman. 
The difference lies in the fact that the high-grade 
man is able to analyze and plan his job. He can 
look ahead and predict, with reasonable certainty, 
the effect of his acts. He does not find it neces- 
sary to explain errors by saying, “I did not think 
of that.” He knows ina practical way the impor- 
tant laws of chemistry and physics as they affect 
the success of his work, although he is not able 
to state these laws in the exact language of the 
scientist. He knows why things are done in cer- 
tain ways and this enables him to meet a new 
situation where conditions make it necessary to 
do the thing in a different way. 
55
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
The man who possesses only manipulative skill 
is little better than a machine even though his 
skill is very great. He can do only what he is 
told todo. He wastes his time because he cannot 
plan his work and cannot foresee the effect of 
his acts. He lacks the ability to meet a new situa- 
tion. 
35. Too Little Information Furnished.— 
While dictation is the best method for the teacher 
to pursue when attempting to establish exact 
habits, it is the least satisfactory when attempt- 
ing to develop the thinking side of the training. 
One does not learn to think by being told to 
think. He learns by having a problem and 
the necessary data and being under the necessity 
of solving the problem. For the beginner it is 
highly important that the data be adequate and 
available. It comprises the information, experi- 
ences, observations, and, in fact, the entire com- 
plex of the life of the individual as well as the 
physical situation in which he finds himself. If 
he lacks information, give it to him rather than 
force him to a waste of time in a profitless search. 
There is no particular development in acquiring 
facts. The development comes in using them. It 
is far better to give the necessary facts and let 
the student spend his time in finding how to use 
them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  TOPICS OF INFORMATION 57 
Nothing can be more discouraging to the 
beginner than to be assigned a problem for which 
he does not have adequate data or the proper 
background of experience. In order to under- 
stand the significance of this, place yourself in 
the position of the student. You are given this 
problem: “Draw a design for a hickey.” Can 
you do it without additional information? Could 
you secure the desired information in a reason- 
able length of time? Would you consider the 
time necessary to secure the data well spent? If 
your experience has fallen in certain lines, the 
problem is simple; if it has not fallen in these 
lines, you will appreciate to some degree how 
the student feels who is given a problem without 
adequate data. 
36. Purpose of Topics of Information.—The 
purpose of the “Information Topics’ is to give 
the facts of science that underlie the practice of 
the trade. It is the kind of information neces- 
sary in planning a job in order that it may work 
out successfully. It is to supply the background 
of information which will make the worker 
resourceful and self-reliant, and enable him to 
meet successfully new situations. It is the kind 
of information that is important in connection 
with jobs rather than with operations. For 
example, the capacity of wires for carrying elec-
-P-A-G-E-58
    58 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
tric current is of no importance in making a 
Western Union splice, but it is highly important 
in wiring a building. 
A direct statement is the best method of pre- 
senting information, but information alone is of 
little value. We must understand its significance, 
its relation to other facts, and we must be able 
to use it before it is of any great importance to 
us. The function of the question is to present 
problems and to direct thought and observation, 
not to supply information. The question presents 
the problem, information supplies the data, 
thought, based upon the data, supplies the solu- 
tion. 
37. Method Used in Teaching Topics of 
Information.—In the preparation of the infor- 
mation topics, it is assumed that the student will 
need certain information. It is not sufficient to 
give it to him by word of mouth. He will for- 
get it or get it inaccurately, if we depend upon 
that method. It is better to write it out in clear 
and concise form, stating briefly the facts he will 
need to know. Give the information he is likely 
to need in the practice of his trade. Make no 
effort to state it in scientific terms, even though 
such terms are more accurate; the worker wants 
information he can use. When it is necessary 
to use scientific terms, explain them so they will
-P-A-G-E-59
TOPICS OF INFORMATION 59 
be understood wherever found in the literature of 
the trade. 
Two or three specific references should be given 
at the beginning of the treatment of every infor- 
mation topic. These references should contain 
the best available discussion of the topic. They 
should not be chosen for their exhaustive treat- 
ment of the subject, but for the clear and prac- 
tical manner in which the subject is handled. 
Following the simple and_ straightforward 
statement of facts, should be a series of ques- 
tions. The questions are to create discussion of 
the briefly stated facts, and to serve as a means 
of expanding them in the direction most profit- 
able. The questions will direct the thought of 
the student to the real significance of the facts. 
They will serve also to direct his reading. 
Preparing the information on a topic is a rela- 
tively simple matter. It consists largely in con- 
densing pages of loosely stated facts and discus- 
sions into a few sentences so clearly and directly 
stated that a workman can understand them. 
Leave: the discussion to be created by the ques- 
tions. The questions must be carefully studied 
in order to avoid leading into fields of doubtful 
value.

the treatment of information topics will give a 
fair idea of the method. The first topic is 
“Solder.” It is one of special interest to 
plumbers or to cable splicers. 
SOLDER 
References: 
Starbuck, Standard Practical Plumbing, 
Chapter II. 
Dibble, Elements of Plumbing, Chapter III. 
Information: 
Solder used by plumbers is of two kinds: 
“bright solder” or “fine solder,” and “wiping 
solder.” 
The first is used with the soldering iron and 
is composed of equal parts of lead and tin. 
It is often referred to as “half and half” 
solder. 
Wiping solder usually is composed of about 
two parts tin and three parts lead. The 
metals should be pure and clean. 
Lead melts at about 620 degrees and tin at 
about 445 degrees Fahrenheit. The mixture 
of the two metals as in solder melts at a 
temperature considerably below that required 
to melt either metal alone. 
To test wiping solder pour a small quantity 
on a brick. If the mixture is correct it will
-P-A-G-E-61
TOPICS OF INFORMATION 61 
have a mottled appearance. If it has too 
much tin it will be bright. 
To purify solder heat until it shows a low 
red in a dark place and add a small lump of 
sulphur, stir well and skim off impurities. 
Solder should be stirred occasionally while 
being used. 
Questions: 
. What is solder used for? 
. What metals can we solder? 
. What is the action which causes the 
solder to adhere or stick? 
. Why should wiping solder be stirred? 
. What conditions are necessary in order 
to have solder stick? 
. What precautions should we take in order 
to prevent impurities getting into the 
solder? 
. What are the common sources of impuri- 
ties and how may you detect them? 
8. Is it an advantage to have solder melt at 
a lower temperature than the other 
metals? Why?

  HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
Information: 
Voltage is required to transmit electrical 
energy through a resistance. All conductors 
have resistance, some more than others. The 
smaller the conductor for a given material 
the higher the resistance. When electrical 
energy is transmitted the pressure (voltage) 
at the receiving end of the line is always less 
than at the sending or power end. The dif- 
ference or loss in voltage as a result of this 
resistance is called the “voltage drop,” or 
“ine drop.” 
Drop is proportional to resistance. When 
several lines are connected, end to end, and 
electrical energy transmitted, the voltage loss 
over each line varies with the resistance of 
each line. The lines of high resistance have 
heavy drops, and the lines of low resistance 
have small drops. 
For example, suppose three lines were con- 
nected, end to end, and the first line has five 
ohms of resistance, the second, fifteen ohms, 
and the third line has thirty ohms. Suppose 
the total drop over the three lines is 200 
volts. What would the loss be over each 
line? The rule is very simple—the drop is 
in proportion to the resistance of each line. 
Therefore, adding up all the line resistances 
a total resistance of fifty ohms is found. 
Over the fifty ohms is a total drop of 200 
volts. Therefore, over the first line is a 
drop of 5/50 of 200 or 20 volts. Over
-P-A-G-E-63
TOPICS OF INFORMATION 63 
the second line is a drop of 15/50 of 200 
or 60 volts. Over the third line is a drop 
of 30/50 of 200 or 120 volts. Adding all 
the drops 20 and 60 and 120 makes 200, 
which proves the figures to be correct. 
The circular mil-foot line is the basis for 
all calculations of line drop. It would not 
be practical to use such a small line, but it is 
practical for purposes of calculation. 
Imagine a line one foot long, consisting of 
one wire, made of copper, and measuring 
one mil (1/1000 of an inch) in diameter. 
Such a line is a circular mil-foot line, and 
at ordinary room temperatures, around 70 
degrees Fahrenheit, the resistance of such a 
line would be about 10.7 ohms. 
A two-wire line of the size outlined above 
would consist of two wires, each having 
a resistance of 10.7 ohms. Hence the total 
resistance of a line one foot long, but con- 
sisting of two wires each one mil in diameter, 
would be two times 10.7 or 21.4 ohms. 
Since electricians always measure lines “one 
way,” the number 21.4 is used when figur- 
ing line drop, because the current must flow 
to the lead and back again. 
The length of line determines the resistance 
of the line. A line twice as long as another 
line of the same wire has twice the resist- 
ance, and so on. A 200-foot line has 200 
times the resistance of a one-foot line.
-P-A-G-E-64
64 
  HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
The circular mil area of the wire also affects 
the line resistance. The greater the area of 
the wire in circular mils, the lower the resist- 
ance. A wire having 10,000 circular mils 
has only one-half as much resistance as a 
wire having only 5,000 circular mils, and it 
has twice as much resistance as a wire hav- 
ing 20,000 circular mils. 
The effect of current on line drop is such 
that if the current flowing is doubled, the 
line drop is doubled. If the current is cut 
to one-third of the original value, the line 
drop will be reduced to one-third of the 
original drop. 
Ohm’s law on line drop states that 
Voltage drop=Line resistance X Line cur- 
rent. 
Therefore, if the line resistance can be fig- 
ured, and the line current is known, the drop 
is figured according to the above rule. 
Calculating line drop over two-wire line. 
The resistance of any copper line of two 
wires can be found as follows: 
Resistance= 
21.4 X Length of line one way in feet   
Circular mils in one wire 
Therefore, the line drop in volts is found by 
multiplying the line resistance by the line 
current, and the following well known elec- 
trician’s rule is:

Questions: 
1. What is the connection between the volt- 
age drop and the resistance of a circuit? 
2. If the amount of drop in the line must 
be reduced, what must be done to the 
line? 
3. Does line drop occur in all transmission 
lines ? 
4. Would the voltage drop be the same on a 
2300-volt line as on a similar line with 
110 volts? 
5. Can the number 21.4, used in the line 
drop rule, be used for iron wire? Why? 
There are three topics of information that 
require special attention. They are essentially 
introductory matter that a beginner must know 
before he can make any progress in his work. 
These topics are: “Tools of the Trade,” “Mate- 
rials of the Trade,” and “Trade Terms.” 
40. The Tools of the Trade.—It is essential 
that the beginner know the principal tools of the 
trade and the purposes for which they are used. 
This information can be given by the use of a 
cut or drawing of the tool, with a description and 
a statement of its use underneath. With this as 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
a basis, the student should have an opportunity 
to handle and examine the tool. It is by no 
means necessary that he wait until he needs to 
use the tool to examine it and to become familiar 
with its use. 
On the other hand, it is not necessary that 
the beginner be familiar with all of the uses of 
the rarely used tools of the trade. It is impor- 
tant, however, for him to know the names and 
uses of the principal tools, in order that he may 
understand the directions given for performing 
the operations he is likely to be engaged in. He 
should know, also, that special tools exist for 
special work. He must know what is meant 
when we speak of such things as a dog or a 
chuck, in the machine shop, or a stick in the 
print shop. 
41. Materials of the Trade.—The materials 
of the trade are ordinarily of sufficient impor- 
tance to be treated in separate topics, as: “Paper,” 
“Ink,” etc., in the printing trade, or “Cast Iron 
Pipe,” “Fittings,” “Oakum,” etc., in the plumber’s 
trade. It is essential that the beginner know the 
names, sizes, methods of identification and work- 
ing qualities of the principal materials to be 
used. 
42. Trade Terms.—The other item to be 
considered at the beginning, is “Trade Terms.”
-P-A-G-E-67
  TOPICS OF INFORMATION 67 
This will be in the nature of a glossary explaining 
the meaning of trade terms. Its use should be 
made clear to the student at the beginning. 
Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon 
the necessity for properly introducing the student 
to his trade and giving the necessary informa- 
tion to make him feel that he has a starting 
point. It is not necessary to enter into long 
theoretical discussions before he begins his work, 
but he should have all necessary facts.
-P-A-G-E-68
  CHAPTER VI 
PROBLEMS OF THE TRADE 
Under the head of problems of the trade are 
treated those phases of trade training not falling 
under the heads of “Operations” or “Informa- 
tion.” These problems have to do largely with 
computations and with the business side of the 
trade. 
43. Too Much Stress Laid on Arithmetic.— 
The amount of knowledge of arithmetic required 
in the practice of a trade is greatly over-esti- 
mated. In many trades only the most meager 
knowledge is actually required. The require- 
ments vary greatly for the different trades. A 
man may be a good welder and be entirely inno- 
cent of any knowledge of arithmetic. The 
machinist finds a certain amount of arithmetic 
necessary in his trade. It is therefore neces- 
sary to take the trade to be taught and list the 
types of calculations to be made in doing the 
work of the trade and then through a series of 
problems of each type give sufficient practice to 
secure facility in the solution of such problems. 
68
-P-A-G-E-69
PROBLEMS OF THE TRADE 69 
44. Problems in Machinist’s Trade—In the 
machinist’s trade the following represents some 
of the principal types of problems: See BROWNE 
SOMNDA 
maw 
NE . How to use formulae. 
. Mensuration problems involving circle, 
square, hexagon, etc. 
. Speeds of pulleys and gears. 
Length and driving power of belts. 
. Measuring tools—Micrometer and Ver- 
nier. 
. Cutting speed and feed. 
. Calculations for gears and spirals. 
. Calculations for threads. 
. Calculations for drills and tap sizes. 
. Calculations for tapers. 
. Indexing. 
. Solution of right triangles. 
. Use of tables. 
. Graphic solution of problems. 
No attempt is here made to place these topics 
in the order they should be taught. It is simply 
a list of topics under which the mathematical 
problems peculiar to the machinist’s trade might 
fall. 
The mathematics required in the work of the 
printer would be of a different type, and for the 
sheet-metal worker still a different type, and so 
on, for most of the trades. These differences 
exist, however, only as the computation applies 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
    
70 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
to the very narrow range of problems peculiar 
to the trade. The graphic solution of problems 
by means of drawings, special tools, tables, and 
various mechanical devices, constitute special fea- 
tures of each trade. Such kinks are very impor- 
tant and are the means by which mechanics solve 
most of their problems. 
45. Mathematical Knowledge Which Ap- 
plies to All Trades.—There is a phase of 
mathematical knowledge that is desirable for the 
skilled mechanics of all trades. It consists of 
facility in the fundamental operations of arithme- 
tic, some knowledge of common and decimal frac- 
tions, keeping accounts of time and materials, 
supplies, estimating costs and reading drawings. 
Facility in handling the fundamental opera- 
tions of arithmetic is the foundation of all other 
figuring. If the student does not possess it, he 
should be drilled in these operations until he 
can perform them readily. There are certain 
fixed relations to be learned and the quickest and 
easiest way to learn them is by drill. Mistakes 
come more often through mistakes in these oper- 
ations than through errors in their application. 
It is a mistake to leave training in mathematics 
to the problems that arise in jobs of the trade. 
The average mechanic does not meet with enough 
problems in the ordinary course of his trade to
-P-A-G-E-71
PROBLEMS OF THE TRADE 71 
give him enough practiec to enable him to solve 
his problems readily. If he does not get the 
fundamental operations outside of his trade, he 
is not likely to get them. We should not depend 
upon incidental learning. The man who cannot 
solve his problems readily usually resorts to some 
makeshift way of approximating results and soon 
loses what knowledge he had of ordinary com- 
putations. 
Training in common and decimal fractions is 
less important as applied to all trades, but is very 
desirable. Again, a little systematic training will 
give valuable returns. 
46. Keeping Accounts——Every mechanic 
should be able to keep an accurate account of 
time and material. From these he should be 
able to determine the cost of the job. The stu- 
dent’s practice in this work may come in con- 
nection with a job he is working on and on the 
forms used in that trade. He should be familiar 
enough with this line of work to be able to keep 
the accounts of a small shop. 
47. Making Out Orders.—Every skilled 
mechanic should know how to make out orders 
for materials and supplies in his trade. He 
should know how to determine costs when dis- 
counts are given, and be able to transact the 
business of a small shop. This is not absolutely 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  72 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
essential in the training of all mechanics, but it 
is highly desirable. 
48. Estimating. — The skilled mechanic 
should be able to estimate with a fair degree of 
accuracy the cost of a job in time and material. 
In order to develop this ability, the student 
should be required to make such an estimate 
before the job is begun and report the actual 
time and material when the job is finished. Such 
a plan helps him to see how the employer will 
look at his work. 
49. Reading Drawings——In most of the 
skilled trades, men are called upon to read draw- 
ings. That is, their instructions come to them 
in the form of drawings, and from these draw- 
ings they must get all the information they 
require to do the work. They must be able to 
read the drawings accurately and readily, and 
should be able to take off the material required 
for the job. They must know the relation of the 
views and the standard conventions used for their 
trade, and understand every detail of construc- 
tion shown in the drawing. The drawing is the 
language of the mechanic, and he must be able 
to use and understand it.  
-P-A-G-E-73
  CHAPTER VII 
ANALYZING AND PLANNING THE JoB 
50. Analyzing the Job.—The ability to 
analyze and plan a job is the mark of a high- 
grade mechanic. The man who can examine a 
job and see just what there is to do and can 
outline the order of procedure in doing it, has 
learned a most important part of the trade. In 
order to do this, he must know the operations of 
the trade and have a pretty clear idea of how 
they are performed. He may lack the subtle 
skill of hand necessary to perform the operations 
efficiently, or even at all, but he has the qualities 
that will make him a leader or foreman in his 
trade when he does acquire the skill of hand. 
51. Analyzing the Trade is a job far beyond 
the beginner, and it would be an unnecessary task 
even if he were capable of it. If the work of 
analysis has been done thoroughly, this analysis 
becomes, in a measure, standard, and, like the 
key in botany, it forms a guide for the worker 
in that trade. The analysis of the trade serves 
the young worker in the same way that the key 
serves the beginning otanist. 
73 
   
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  74 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
The list of unit operations should mean to the 
worker a list of the things he must be able to 
do, and thus it gives him a pretty clear idea of 
the extent of his trade in so far as skill is con- 
cerned. It should also mean to him a list of all 
the operations involved in any job of the trade, 
just as the alphabet is a list of all the letters 
involved in any word of the language. When 
he sees that even the most complicated jobs are 
made up of relatively simple manipulative pro- 
cesses, the learning difficulty is greatly reduced. 
52. Teaching the Beginner to Analyze.— 
The student should be supplied with the “trade 
analysis” and he should become familiar with the 
unit operations. The beginner who has never 
heard of the unit operations and who is not 
familiar with the terms of the trade, is just as 
helpless as the young botanist would be in the 
use of his key if he had never heard of such 
terms as calyx or stamen. 
Such ignorance, if it exists, is the beginning of 
learning. It gives a starting point in a felt need. 
There is no getting around the point that the 
student must know something of what is involved 
in the trade and what he is expected to learn. 
If he does not know these things at the beginning 
we must either teach him or dismiss him. If he 
does not understand the list, it should be ex-  
-P-A-G-E-75
ANALYZING AND PLANNING THE JOB 75 
plained to him. He must know what it is about 
and must have a clear idea of what is involved in 
each operation. He will have no difficulty in get- 
ting this information if he turns to the operation 
sheet and reads it. 
It is by no means necessary that a student be 
set to work on some job involving manipulative 
processes as soon as he reports. Time spent in 
getting a thorough understanding of the situation 
and in making definite plans is not wasted. In 
fact, it is the best way of preventing a waste of 
time. It is well to impress upon the student at 
the very beginning the necessity for a thorough 
understanding of the requirements, and for a 
definite plan of procedure before the task is 
begun. 
When the student is familiar with the princi- 
pal terms of the trade, and knows the meaning 
of the operations, he should be given some very 
simple job and asked to check on the analysis 
sheet the operations involved in doing it. He 
may fail to check all of them or he may fail to 
check correctly. If he fails the teacher should, by 
use of questions as to how certain things are 
done, bring out the desired analysis. This should 
be repeated on a number of simple jobs until the 
students know how to use the analysis. It is not 
necessary that the student do the jobs at this
-P-A-G-E-76
76 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
time. The thing sought is to make him familiar 
with the process of analysis. 
53. Listing Operations in Order.—When 
the student has become fairly familiar with this 
process of analysis he should be required to list 
the operations of the jobs he has analyzed in the 
order in which they occur in doing the job. 
Often it will be found that different orders of 
procedure are equally good. The instructor 
should therefore question the man concerning his 
reasons for proceeding in the way he has indi- 
cated, and, if he gives good reasons, he should 
be permitted to follow his own plan even though 
it is not the usual order. 
Care must be taken to assign jobs within the 
capacity of the student. It gives him confidence 
and enables him to see how the plan works. It 
is not difficult to develop a good deal of pride 
in the ability to analyze and plan a job quickly 
when it is understood that this is one of the dis- 
tinguishing marks of the good mechanic. 
The following examples illustrate the method 
of procedure; the first example is taken from 
the printing trade. 
We will assume that the job assigned the stu- 
dent is to set this paragraph in the type and form 
here used. He is given the copy and a sheet on 
which the trade analysis is printed. He is
-P-A-G-E-77
  ANALYZING AND PLANNING THE JOB 77 
requested to check the operations involved in the 
job. If he omits any, a well directed question 
probably will be sufficient to call his attention to 
the omission. When the operations are checked, 
he is requested to list the operations in the order 
in which he would do them and estimate the time 
required for the job. The following is about 
what we should expect to get:

When the analysis and plan of the job are con- 
pleted the student should turn to the directions 
for performing the operations.   He will find 
there, carefully prepared and exact, directions for 
performing the work. These directions should be 
read carefully by him before he begins the work, 
and should be at hand for reference, if needed, 
at any time during the progress of the job.

  CHAPTER VIII 
INTEREST, Hapit, AND SKILL 
54. Errors in Applying Doctrine of Inter- 
est.—The doctrine of interest has contributed 
much to the success of modern methods in educa- 
tion, but the lack of wisdom in its application is 
largely responsible for superficial work, restless- 
ness, shiftlessness, and finally a lack of interest 
in anything but the highly sensational. Interest 
is necessary in teaching, but it is not necessary 
that it be spontaneous, nor is it necessary that 
we depend upon the previous experience or the 
feverish imagination of youth to supply it. 
Unless the broader training, wider experience, 
and more mature judgment of those who have 
studied the demands of society are to have 
greater weight than the whimsical interest of a 
youth, we should abandon attempts at instruction. 
It is very well to remember that “The child of 
today is the ruler of tomorrow,” but we must not 
forget that the child of yesterday is the ruler of 
today. It is the business of the teaching pro- 
fession to determine the fundamental demands of 
; 81
-P-A-G-E-82
  82 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
society and to see to it that an adequate interest 
is developed in these demands. It is a mistake 
to pet and pamper and coddle in the school. It 
gives the youth the wrong impression of the 
world outside. When he goes out to earn a 
living, his tasks are not assigned on the basis of 
his interest. In most of life’s problems, the inter- 
est is not voluntary, it comes from grim necessity. 
The idea the youth gets while in school, that he 
need do only the things he is interested in, or 
the things he wishes to do, is largely responsible 
for shifting employment, idleness, and the lack 
of proper spirit in his work when he enters indus- 
try. The notion that students are interested only 
in articles they can use, is not justified. They 
may be interested quite as deeply, if with some- 
what greater difficulty, in acquiring an ability 
which will enable them to satisfy more remote 
wants. There is not the least doubt that students 
may be deeply interested in acquiring skill if it 
is made clear to them that skill is necessary to 
their success. They will even take great pride 
in their skill when skill is held up to them as 
a worthy ideal. Pride in workmanship should 
be cultivated not only because of the satisfaction 
it gives the worker, but because there is no surer 
foundation of good citizenship.
-P-A-G-E-83
  ¢NTEREST, HABIT, AND SKILL 83 
55. Learner Must Have Definite Aim.—If 
we are to teach successfully, we must let the stu- 
dent know what we expect of him. If we expect 
him to develop skill, we should let him know it, 
and let him know, also, what particular skill we 
expect him to develop. No advantage can be 
gained by concealing our purpose and secretly 
trying to teach a student something while his 
efforts are directed to an entirely different pur- 
pose. The aim of the student and the teacher 
should be the same, that is, the student should 
aim to learn what the teacher aims to teach. 
When a student aims to make a chicken coop 
while the teacher aims to teach him to saw, the 
aim of the student is much more likely to be 
realized than the aim of the teacher. Such a 
divergence of aim may give the person a super- 
ficial knowledge of tools so that he will be able 
to do a certain amount of rough and inaccurate 
work at a considerable expenditure of time and 
energy, but he will never become a skilled 
mechanic until he directs his attention to the spe- 
cific problem of the best method of using the 
tools. It is much wiser to let the student know 
definitely what we are aiming at, and then pro- 
ceed with a well-organized plan to teach him 
these things. We should not try to conceal the 
real aim even though it may not present an allur-
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
ing prospect to the learner. If we would develop 
our youth into capable, self-reliant men, ready 
to face their duties, we must give them definite 
tasks, within their capacity, and hold them to a 
fair performance of these tasks. 
56. Relation of Skill and Habit—The 
theory of incidental learning works well where 
only superficial knowledge is required. Where 
accuracy and exactness is required, it fails entirely 
or succeeds only at a tremendous cost in time and 
energy. To learn to do a thing well, in a reason- 
able length of time, requires a definite aim and 
a conscious effort. A large amount of general 
information may be acquired incidentally, but for 
the fundamental and exact requirements of 
society we must depend upon a more direct 
method. We should never leave to chance the 
formation of exact habits. 
Since skill is only a thoroughly established 
habit of doing a thing in the most economical 
way, we should follow closely the laws of habit 
formation in teaching the operations of a trade. 
Our problem is to establish correct habits. 
57. Four Steps in Habit Formation.—In 
order to establish quickly a habitual method of 
performing an operation, it is essential: 
1, That the individual have a clear notion 
of what he is trying to do.
-P-A-G-E-85
  INTEREST, HABIT, AND SKILL 85 
2. That he perform the operation correctly 
the first time. 
3. That he give close and critical attention. 
4. That he repeat the operation with the 
least possible variation until the habit is 
thoroughly established, 
In order that he may be sure to start correctly, 
it is necessary to give specific directions in terms 
easily understood. To leave to the student the 
discovery of the best method of performing the 
operation, or to undertake to direct his discovery 
by questions, is not only a waste of time but it 
violates every law of habit formation. 
The learner must give close and critical atten- 
tion in order to avoid any deviation from the 
prescribed form and in order to get the “feel” 
of the process when correctly done. It is highly 
desirable that he have the detailed instructions 
before him, or that he have them very definitely 
in mind, in order that he may avoid deviation. 
The process must be repeated with the least 
possible variation until it is easier to conform 
than it is to vary. James says, “Never permit 
an exception to occur until the new habit is 
securely rooted in your life.” If the student is 
permitted to experiment before the habit is 
established, exceptions will occur and he will 
waste his time and establish bad habits. By fol-  
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
lowing exactly specific directions, and with a 
large amount of practice, he will secure the 
desired combination of habits and no other. 
Since these habits must function frequently in 
the life of the mechanic, they should be repeated 
until they are reduced to an automatic basis. 
Skill can come only through repetition of the 
same process over and over again. 
58. Difference Between Development of 
Skill and Use of Skill—The development of 
skill and the development of the ability to use 
that skill advantageously represent two very dis- 
tinct phases of trade training and require a differ- 
ent method. One represents the development of 
habit, the other represents the development of 
organizing and planning ability. One is a physi- 
cal development, the other a mental development. 
Practice on exercises may develop skillful 
manipulation, but work on a practical job is 
necessary to develop organizing and planning 
ability. The failure to recognize these two phases 
of the training has led to much confusion and 
controversy concerning method.
-P-A-G-E-87
  CHAPTER IX 
Some DIFFICULTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THE 
PLAN 
Unquestionably there are certain difficulties in 
the way of carrying out this plan. Some are real, 
some are imaginary. It is often easier to over- 
come real difficulties than fancied ones. The real 
difficulties here are not widely different from 
those of any other plan. They are inherent in 
any new plan of organization. It is not easy to 
work out new relations and put into practice a 
plan quite different from the conventional one. 
59. Difficulties in Analyzing Trade.—The 
difficulty of developing a complete analysis of a 
trade is great. It requires a thorough knowledge 
of the trade and a well-developed power of 
analysis. It requires, also, a discriminating judg- 
ment to determine whether a given process shall 
be regarded as a unit operation or as a step in a 
unit operation. Great care must be taken to avoid 
breaking up the trade into units that are too 
small. The training of the professional teacher 
is likely to lead him into too much detail. It must 
be remembered that the analysis of a trade has 
87 
   
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
no virtue in itself. It is made for the purpose 
of giving us satisfactory teaching units. This 
last must be the final test. When the job is well 
done and the analysis made available to the public 
it need not be repeated for that trade. 
The topics of information present little diffi- 
culty for those who can state a fact without dis- 
cussing it. The formulation of the questions so 
as to bring out the significance and application of 
the facts requires considerable thought. 
60. Difficulty in Preparing Instructions.— 
Perhaps the most difficult phase of the work so 
far as preparation is concerned is writing the 
instructions for performing the operations. 
Unquestionably it is very difficult to describe a 
manipulative operation in either written or spoken 
language. We must be careful to say all that is 
necessary and not a word too much. Any 
unnecessary statement confuses. We must avoid 
giving elaborate instruction for performing an 
unskilled operation which anyone of ordinary 
intelligence can perform by a simple direction. 
It is often necessary to resort to the drawing 
to supplement the language. This is as far as 
we can go on paper, but in order to make clear 
the method of performing an intricate manipula- 
tive operation, it is often necessary to supplement 
this with a demonstration. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  DIFFICULTIES, ADVANTAGES OF PLAN 89 
Such an organization and preparation of the 
subject matter of the trade calls for our very 
best efforts. To do it well requires a great deal 
of time, but when done, we have a complete 
teaching plan for any job that may arise. It will 
be necessary to revise and supplement this work 
from time to time, but the work of the teacher 
is greatly simplified when he can place such 
material in the hands of the student. 
There is no very good reason for organizing 
and arranging the material unless it can be used 
to advantage. To use it effectively means some 
change in the ordinary method of procedure. 
61. Class Instruction vs. Individual Instruc- 
tion.—Class instruction always has been re- 
garded as necessary in American schools. The 
teachers of sloyd are about the only people who 
have advocated individual instruction as opposed 
to class instruction. Class instruction and indi- 
vidual instruction each have certain distinct 
advantages. Our effort, in the use of this 
material, is to get all of the good and none of 
the bad of both systems. 
62. Both Class and Individual Instruction 
Desirable in Trade Teaching.—The advan- 
tages of class instruction lie chiefly in the saving 
of time when the entire group need the same 
information or instruction at the same time. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  
  90 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
teaching a trade this situation rarely exists except 
in cases where exercises alone are used as the 
basis of instruction. Even under such conditions 
it is extremely difficult to keep the class near 
enough together to warrant giving class demon- 
strations and instructions to the entire group at 
the same time. It almost inevitably means retard- 
ing the more capable or requiring them to spend 
relatively much more time on a given kind of 
work than the less capable do, and the need of 
the less capable is much greater. Supplementary 
exercises or projects have been employed to keep 
all the students at work on the same operations in 
order that instructions may be given to the entire 
group at one time; but this does not alter the 
fact that the one who needs the training most 
is getting the least. Such a situation is unavoid- 
able unless we have a plan flexible enough to per- 
mit class instruction in matters of interest to the 
entire group, and individual instruction where 
the problem is individual. This must be done 
without increasing the cost of instruction in either 
the time or the energy of the teacher. 
The organization of the material as indicated 
in previous chapters makes such a plan possible. 
With the analysis of the trade, and with the 
instructions for performing the operations writ- 
ten out, and the required information summarized
-P-A-G-E-91
DIFFICULTIES, ADVANTAGES OF PLAN 91 
in the topics of information, the necessity for 
class demonstration and instruction is reduced to 
the minimum. This gives additional time for 
individual instruction where needed, and does 
not take up the time of the student who does not 
need the instruction. 
63. Difficulties of Class Instruction.—One 
of the difficulties of class instruction is that the 
teacher must take up enough time to get the idea 
over to the dullest of the group. This means a 
loss of time to the brighter students. Then, too, 
even an excellent teacher sometimes talks too 
much. Another difficulty connected with class 
instruction is that the student does not feel in 
any immediate need of the demonstration and 
does not follow it eagerly. Further, he is likely 
to remember only the most spectacular parts of 
the demonstration, or the last part of it. With 
written instructions before him he can refer to 
them at any time he is in doubt. If these are not 
sufficiently clear to him, the teacher has time to 
give individual instructions, and this at a time 
when there is a felt need for it. At such a time 
it is far more effective. Where such a plan has 
been tried, the students unhesitatingly say that 
they prefer it to the class demonstration and lec- 
ture plan, and it has been observed that they do 
better work and more of it than under the class
-P-A-G-E-92
  92 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
demonstration plan. It is also noted that there is 
a wider variation in the amount of work done 
by individuals. 
It is not urged that class demonstrations be dis- 
pensed with, but that they be used only when 
they deal with problems in which the entire class 
is interested, and that no artificial means be intro- 
duced to keep the entire class on the same kind 
of work. 
The questions following the information topics 
constitute a phase of the work where a meet- 
ing of the class is highly desirable. The discus- 
sion of the problems presented by these ques- 
tions will prove enlightening to the entire group, 
and it gives all members of the class a chance 
to contribute. The value of such discussion is 
very great, and it gives an opportunity to develop 
a feeling of unity in the group which is highly 
desirable. 
64. Difficulty of Students to Understand 
Printed Directions.—It will be found that stu- 
dents are sometimes unable to understand the 
instructions. This may be the fault of the one 
who has written the instructions, or it may be 
that the student is unable to get information from 
the printed page. 
The first can be corrected by more careful 
preparation of the instructions. The second pre-
-P-A-G-E-93
  DIFFICULTIES, ADVANTAGES OF PLAN 93 
sents a more difficult problem. In practice it has 
been found that students will say that they are 
unable to understand the printed instructions. If 
the teacher takes the instructions and reads them 
to the students without adding a single word they 
will readily understand. This apparently pre- 
sents a serious objection to written instruction; 
but as a matter of fact it reveals a serious defect 
in the previous training of the individual. He 
has not been taught to get information from the 
printed page. This plan requires him to do it and 
is one of the valuable phases of his training. 
65. Value of Student’s Plan of Procedure.— 
In order to make effective use of the material 
it is necessary that the student be required to 
make a careful preliminary study of the job 
and have a well thought-out plan of procedure. 
This is quite as much a part of his training as 
performing the manipulative operations. If the 
student has a definite plan and a clear under- 
standing of each detail of the job he can pro- 
ceed with dispatch and decision in performing 
the manipulative operations involved. It saves 
time and enables him to give undivided attention 
to developing skill in the manipulative processes, 
and he does not have to stop and debate as to 
what will be done next. Every teacher realizes 
the difficulty of getting students to make adequate 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
    94 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
preliminary plans and to have a clearly thought- 
out method of procedure. Probably every teacher 
realizes also the advantage of such a plan. With 
the material organized as indicated, the student 
has the information necessary to make the plans 
and he should be required to do it. 
66. Student's Progress Measured by 
Achievement.—Unfortunately the traditions 
of our schools place a great deal of emphasis on 
the time element; not on the speed with which 
a thing may be done, but upon the “length of the 
course” in terms, semesters, or years. 
In this plan we ignore the element of time. 
The student’s progress is measured by achieve- 
ment, not by time. We have listed the things 
of the trade it is necessary for a man to learn. 
He may learn them in six months, ten months, 
or it may take him five years. Some men may 
never learn them. The goal is set, however, the 
mileposts are marked, and the traveler may 
readily determine how far he has gone. Time 
is not a measure of the content of a trade nor 
of the abilities of individuals. In ordinary school 
practice time is made the measure, and at the 
end of the period a few may be well trained in 
all the phases of the trade, others will have a 
fair knowledge of the trade, and still others will 
have a smattering of its various phases without
-P-A-G-E-95
  DIFFICULTIES, ADVANTAGES OF PLAN 95 
a thorough training in any part of it. We are 
under the necessity, however, of saying that these 
men “failed” or “passed” and neither student nor 
teacher can tell just what the student knows or 
does not know about the trade. To place before 
him his goal and permit him to reach it as 
quickly as he can is a wiser plan. 
When the record of a student’s work is based 
upon the list of things he must know and must 
be able to do in order to be a journeyman in 
the trade, he may leave at any time with a definite 
and accurate statement of his progress. The 
average employer is not much impressed by the 
statement of a youth that he has spent two or 
three years in a trade school. The employer asks, 
“Well, what can you do?” If the youth replies, 
“T can do these things in a workmanlike manner,” 
he has won an opportunity for a “try out.” 
No analysis of a trade can be complete; because 
the content of the trade is ever changing. New 
materials, new tools, and new constructions are 
being introduced constantly and new skills 
required. If at any time it is found that instruc- 
tion is needed in something that is not listed, we 
simply list it and prepare the instructions. It 
is no fault of the plan if the list is incomplete. 
It is our fault for not completing it.
-P-A-G-E-96
  
  CHAPTER X 
MAKING THE PLAN WorK 
In carrying out any plan it is necessary for 
the teacher to direct his attention to the things 
that can be done rather than to those that can- 
not be done. It is not necessary that a plan be 
followed in every detail and under all conditions 
in order to derive a benefit from it. A plan 
whose mechanism is so intricate that it fails, if 
some part is modified, is not flexible enough for 
the complex needs of modern life. 
67. Plan Must Be Adapted to Specific 
Trade.—In undertaking to show how this plan 
may be made to work, we indicate only one of 
the ways in which material so organized may be 
used. A plan of procedure which brings good 
results in one trade might not be satisfactory for 
another, or physical conditions may require a 
modification of the plan. Flexibility and adapta- 
bility are essential. When variation from a plan 
stamps one as unorthodox, the plan is either 
wrong or is being wrongly interpreted. We 
must always be free to take and use what we 
can of any plan. 
96
-P-A-G-E-97
MAKING THE PLAN WORK 97 
  68. The Problem of Large Classes.—The 
problem of handling a class of any considerable 
size in trade work is a very difficult one. The 
method of class instruction where the entire class 
is called together for demonstration and direc- 
tions is not well suited to groups where the abili- 
ties and the rate of progress of the students 
vary. In school shop work, we have tried to 
overcome this variation in ability or in rate of 
progress by supplementary exercises or projects, 
or by repeating exercises, thus keeping all mem- 
bers of the class on the same kind of work. In 
other classes in school we ignore the difference 
because it is not so obvious that some members 
of the class are receiving instruction they do not 
need, and others need instruction they do not get. 
If the material has been organized as indicated 
in the preceding chapters, much of this difficulty 
is obviated. Every student has his problem, and 
the necessary material for working it out given 
to him. Little class instruction will be necessary. 
The teacher will find time to give individual 
attention to those who need it and the problems 
or questions that arise during the progress of 
the work will form the basis of class discussion 
and it will be found that most questions raised 
by members of the class can be answered by the 
class. 
7
-P-A-G-E-98
  98 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
  For many years the standard number of stu- 
dents for school shop classes was 24, and many 
school officers cannot now see why it should be 
less. Perhaps a number of minor factors like 
size of room or the fact that tools are quoted by 
the dozen started the practice of equipping shops 
for classes of 24, Certainly no very profound 
educational reasons existed for this number. 
These schools were not trade schools, but they 
had a very great influence on our early efforts at 
establishing trade schools. 
69. Maximum and Minimum Number of 
Students in a Trade Class.—The number of 
students that can be satisfactorily instructed in 
one class will vary in the different trades and will 
vary with conditions and character of the work 
in the same trade. In general, however, it will 
be found that a group of more than fifteen or six- 
teen is rather large for the most satisfactory 
work and that a group of less than eight or nine 
is rather small. The group must be small enough 
for the teacher to give aid when needed and to 
keep the men engaged at all times, and it must 
be large enough to develop a sort of group spirit 
and keep the teacher busy at his proper tasks and 
not give him the leisure that will tempt him to 
give help where no help is needed.

70. Dividing Class Into Groups.—In most 
trades it is well to divide the class into small 
groups with not more than four or five men in a 
group. One of the group should be designated 
as leader and placed in charge of the job as fore- 
man. All general instructions concerning the job 
should be given to this leader and he should be 
held responsible for tools and materials used by 
the men. It should be the leader’s duty also to 
keep the men at work. His duties are very 
largely those of a foreman. Such a plan reduces 
largely the number of men with whom the teacher 
must deal directly in handling a job, and at the 
same time it gives an opportunity to develop lead- 
ership and self-confidence. The men learn how 
to receive orders and to work together. The 
group membership should be changed frequently, 
but neither the membership nor the leader should 
be changed until the leader has had his men 
with him long enough to establish unity and 
understanding in the group. The size of the 
groups will vary as well as the personnel and 
leadership, but care must be taken that these 
changes are methodical, and for good reason. 
71, Selecting Group Leaders.—In the first” 
grouping of the class it probably will be neces- 
sary to choose as leaders of the groups men who 
know no more about the trade than the other  
-P-A-G-E-100
  100 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
  members of the group. They are selected because 
the teacher believes them to have higher qualities 
of leadership than the others. It is done just 
as the captain of a company of raw recruits must 
select his non-commissioned officers from those 
who have had no military training. The teacher 
will make mistakes just as the captain does, but 
it gives him a chance to try out his men and gives 
them a chance to learn. In a short time it is 
possible to place the men in groups according to 
their ability. 
The teacher must confer often with the group 
leaders concerning plans, progress of the work, 
and of the men, and give helpful suggestions. 
72. Practice Work Permissible.-—The ideal 
method of giving instruction would be on prac- 
tical jobs, provided a sufficient number of prac- 
tical jobs could be found sufficiently simple for 
the beginner. We may just as well face the fact, 
however, that such a condition does not always 
exist nor can it always be created. We should 
then keep our ideal in mind and do practical 
‘work whenever possible, but we need not con- 
‘demn those who find it necessary to resort to 
‘exercises in those phases of the training where 
skill is the dominant aim. 
73. Practical Work Necessary.x—We must 
recognize that it is impossible to teach a trade
-P-A-G-E-101
  MAKING THE PLAN WORK 101 
thoroughly without doing a great deal of prac- 
tical work on actual jobs. In many trades the 
unavoidable limitations of most schools are such 
that they cannot give the practical work required. 
The best of these schools recognize these facts 
and do not pretend to send out thoroughly trained 
mechanics; but they do send out men who have 
the foundation which, with the addition of prac- 
tical experience, will make of them high-grade 
mechanics. 
With the present organization of our schools 
a certain amount of exercise work is perhaps 
necessary, but it should be recognized for what 
it is—practice work to develop skill. Changing 
its name to a job or a project does not change 
its character. The value of the real job lies in the 
fact that it is done under the real conditions and 
requirements of the trade. The schoolroom 
projects or jobs do not permit the repetition of 
the operations often enough to develop skill. We 
are all familiar with the notion of many school 
men that a job or project loses its “educational 
value” to a boy when he has done it once and 
he must not be permitted to repeat it. We might 
say with equal propriety that there is no “educa- 
tional value” in playing again a piece he has once 
falteringly played on the piano under the direc- 
tion of a teacher. The fact is we are trying to  
-P-A-G-E-102
102 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
  teach these men something—trying to develop 
skill, and we should not let the fog of pedagogical 
terms obscure our purpose. Skill can be 
developed only through persistent and continuous 
repetition. 
74. Plan Applies to Both Practice Work and 
Practical Work.—While the plan outlined will 
work as well where exercises or school projects 
are used as on practical jobs, its greatest value 
will be found on practical work. The analysis 
and careful planning of the job as well as the 
definite written instructions make it possible to 
handle practical work with as little difficulty as 
the standardized exercises. 
The careful planning practically eliminates 
losses resulting from poor judgment and greatly 
reduces the loss from lack of skill. This removes 
one of the serious difficulties in the way of doing 
practical work, and makes it possible for men to 
engage in practical jobs under actual conditions 
of the trade where actual difficulties will arise 
and where the inspiration of the work will be 
felt. 
75. Teacher Should List Every Job.—The 
teacher should have a list of the jobs most fre- 
quently met with in the trade and those in 
which his students probably will have an oppor- 
tunity to engage. He should analyze these jobs
-P-A-G-E-103
MAKING THE PLAN WORK 103 
and plan the procedure in doing them. This is 
a part of his preparation in order that he may 
know just what is in a job before he assigns it. 
His list will be limited at first, but as new jobs 
arise they will be added to the list. He should 
never assign a job until he has analyzed it and 
knows what operations are involved and what 
information is needed in doing it. 
76. The Lesson Plan.—It is necessary to 
have some definite plan of procedure in giving 
instruction, whether the instruction is to be given 
to an individual, to a small group, or to an entire 
class. Such a plan is commonly called a lesson 
plan. It is not necessary that it conform to an 
orthodox plan, such as the “Five Formal Steps,” 
but it must be a definite plan of procedure. 
The following arrangement appears to offer a 
very satisfactory outline for the teacher in the 
preparation of his plan: 
1. A Definite Statement of the Problem or Job. 
This means that all drawings, specifications 
or instructions necessary for the completion of 
the job should be given the student. He then 
should be required to repeat and ‘explain the 
instructions to the teacher until the teacher is sure 
that he understands every detail. 
In school as well as in industry, more failures
-P-A-G-E-104
  104 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
result from a want of a thorough understanding 
of what is required than from all other causes 
combined. Be absolutely sure that every detail 
of the requirement is understood. 
2. Analyze the Job for the Operations Involved. 
The student is given the list of unit operations 
of the trade and is required to check the opera- 
tions involved in the job. This is a further veri- 
fication of step one and assures the teacher that 
the student knows what is to be done. A few 
well-directed questions will lead the student to 
discover any errors in his analysis. The stu- 
dent should enter on the sheet his estimate of 
the time required for the job and at the comple- 
tion of the job the actual time required should 
be entered. 
3. List the Operations in the Order in Which 
They Will Be Performed. 
This will be the student’s plan of procedure in 
doing the job. Different orders of procedure 
often are equally good. The student should be 
questioned as to his method and if he can give 
good reasons for it he should be permitted to fol- 
low his plan, although it may not be the usual 
order.
-P-A-G-E-105
  MAKING THE PLAN WORK 105 
4. Presentation of Information, Directions, or the 
Demoustration of Any New Operations Involved. 
At this point the teacher should see that the 
student has in available form all necessary infor- 
mation and directions, and that he is thoroughly 
familiar with these. He should be required to 
read carefully the instructions on the operation 
sheets and have them at hand for ready reference 
during the progress of the job. 
The teacher should demonstrate any difficult 
manipulative operation not made perfectly clear 
by the instructions on the operation sheet. The 
student should read the directions on the opera- 
tion sheets as the teacher demonstrates. 
The teacher should be sure that the student is 
familiar with the topics of information that may 
affect the success of the work. 
5. Doing the Work According to the Plan. 
Having a definite and clearly understood plan 
with complete directions, the student should pro- 
ceed with speed and decision to the doing of the 
job. Loitering, indecision, or careless and 
slovenly habits should never be permitted. The 
teacher should observe the work carefully and 
render assistance only where it is actually needed. 
The necessary material has been placed in the 
hands of the student and he should solve his prob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  
  106 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
lem unaided unless there is danger of his falling 
into bad habits. 
6. Check Results. 
The teacher should observe the work carefully 
in order to determine the effectiveness of the 
instruction and whether additional practice is 
necessary in order to attain the required skill. 
7. Report on the Job. 
Students should report to the group: 
a. Time and material used on the job. 
b. Any special difficulties and how they were 
overcome. 
c. Whether some other plan of procedure 
might have been better. 
77. Assigning the Job.—It need hardly be 
said that the teacher should assign jobs which he 
believes to be within the capacity of the student. 
It is not possible to list the jobs of a trade or the 
operations of a trade in the order of their diffi- 
culty, but, by an analysis of the job, a teacher 
can readily determine whether the operations 
involved are too difficult for a given individual. 
Although this plan will enable the beginner to 
handle surprisingly difficult jobs, the teacher must 
use the same good judgment he would use in 
assigning jobs to an apprentice.
-P-A-G-E-107
MAKING THE PLAN WORK 107 
78. Checking Up on Student’s Work.—The 
instructions should be in such a form that they 
will be readily available for reference on the job. 
In case of most of the simpler operations it is 
not necessary for the student to refer to the 
directions after he has performed the operation a 
few times. He will know how to do it, but may 
lack the skill to do it acceptably. At this point 
it is necessary to give careful attention in order 
to prevent the student from falling into bad 
habits. When he is seen to be departing from 
the accepted method of procedure he should be 
referred to his instructions. 
Some individual instruction will be necessary; 
but with all the material at hand for analyzing 
and planning the job, and with instructions for 
doing it, very little assistance will be necessary. 
The effort should be to develop self-reliance on 
the part of the student. 
The development of the ability to analyze and 
plan a job is so important that it is well to give 
considerable time to this, even when the jobs are 
not to be done by the students. A very keen 
interest is readily aroused in this work, and sur- 
prising results will be obtained in a short time. 
One of the serious defects of the apprentice 
system is that the apprentice spends too much 
time on the low-skilled, or semi-skilled, opera-
-P-A-G-E-108
108 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
tions of the trade and often is kept on operations 
long after he has become skilled in performing 
them. This prevents training on the more highly 
skilled operations and delays the completion of 
his training. With the “Trade Analysis Sheet” 
it is an easy matter to keep track of the progress 
of the student and put him on jobs involving new 
operations as soon as he is ready for them. 
79. Record Chart.—The following form is 
suggested for a record chart to be placed on the 
wall of the shop. (Only a sufficient number of 
the operations of the trade are listed here to 
show the form.)

80. How to Use the Chart.—When the 
instructor believes the student thoroughly under- 
stands how to perform an operation he will place 
1 in the student’s column opposite the operation. 
When the student has attained a skill which 
will enable him to perform the operation with a 
fair degree of certainty and in a reasonable time, 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  
  110 HOW TO TEACH A TRADE 
2 will be placed in the column opposite the opera- 
tion. 
When the student can perform the operation 
with approximately the same degree of skill and 
in the same time as the average skilled mechanic, 
3 is placed in the column and this indicates a pro- 
ficiency in that operation. 
This chart shows that not all students have 
been engaged in jobs involving the same opera- 
tions or that they have not made equal progress. 
It also shows what each student has been doing 
and what he can do. 
The “Topics of Information” may be handled 
in the same manner. 
81. Values of the Chart.—Such a chart 
offers a very powerful stimulus for students. It 
shows them that their progress depends upon 
their own individual efforts rather than upon the 
success or failure of their associates. It tells 
them definitely what they are expected to do; and 
a clear and definite statement of what is expected 
of one is a challenge and an inspiration. It also 
keeps before them a record of their accomplish- 
ments and a public record of accomplishment is 
the greatest foe of indolence. 
The topics of information must be handled 
with great care. There should be no long and 
tedious discussions of obscure elements and
-P-A-G-E-111
  MAKING THE PLAN WORK 111 
factors which have little or no importance in the 
actual work of the trade. Stick to those things 
which you can show to have a direct and prac- 
tical application. Give enough of the theory of 
the work to make the men understand the prac- 
tical side, but not enough to cloud and confuse 
them. Check your theoretical work often by this 
standard.

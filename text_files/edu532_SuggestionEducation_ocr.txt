  PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 
I CAN scarcely allow this book to go into a second 
edition without making some allusion to the criticism of 
its doctrines which has been reiterated by Dr. F. H. 
Hayward on every second page of his recently published 
volumes, Education and the Heredity Spectre (1908) and 
Day and Evening Schools (1910). It is difficult to be 
angry with Dr. Hayward even with the greatest wish to 
indulge one’s passions. Indeed, when he refers to the 
state of English opinion upon education in the follow- 
ing words, “There is not even a single healthy and 
honest controversy being fought out at the present day. 
In any country that was educationally awake, Mr. 
Keatinge’s important and arrestive doctrine of ‘con- 
trariance’ would, during the past two years, have 
awakened animated discussion,”! it is impossible for me 
not to feel that he is a sympathetic critic, and that a 
reply to his criticism almost smacks of discourtesy. 
His remarks, however, embody such a misapprehension 
of the proper use of terms, that in the interest of educa- 
tional theory I cannot let them pass unchallenged. 
Dr. Hayward brings two charges against me: 
(1) lama Herbartian without admitting it, and yet 
cross swords with the professed followers of 
Herbart.

(2) I talk of contrariant ideas without making it clear 
what their origin is. “I admit,” he says, “that a 
youth may derive wrong ideas from companions 
or from books ; but this is not what Mr. Keatinge 
means. He does not trace contrariant ideas 
to any definite source, but imagines that they 
spring up inevitably in the soul. This I doubt, 
this I am very strongly inclined even to deny.” ! 
(1) Nothing is more futile than a dispute which never 
would have arisen if the combatants had been at pains 
to define their terms at the outset, and Dr. Hayward’s 
attitude towards me results, I believe, from the lack of 
such definition, or at least of a correct definition. 
What is Herbartianism, and who is a Herbartian? 
Dr. Hayward defines the term for us. 
“What, essentially, is Herbartianism? It is a system of 
thought which regards the ‘idea’ or ‘presentation’ as the 
best starting-point for educational exposition ; which believes 
that much mental life can be interpreted in terms of ideas 
—their emergence, coalescence, rivalry, and so forth; that 
factors like feeling and will, soul and heredity, though as 
primitive and fundamental as any others, are best dealt with 
educationally in relation to ideas or presentations; that 
certain categories—notably ‘apperception’ and ‘interest,’ or 
these in union, ‘apperceptive interest ’—are more helpful than 
the categories of the faculty psychology ; that education must 
have a definite and ideal aim; that this aim is ‘character’; 
that character is linked with insight and interest ; that insight 
and interest are linked with apperception; that these things 
are under educational control, and so forth.” ® 
And again: 
“ Herbartians do not for a moment believe that ideas are 
self-existent entities, or that feeling and will are not implicit 
1 Op. cit. p. 489. 
2 Education and the Heredity Spectre, p. 142,

PREFACE vii 
at first in the soul, or that heredity and instinct are impotent. 
They do but believe that the best starting-point for the 
educational thinker is the idea; the most illuminating 
psychological formula, ‘apperception’; the best aim to be set 
before the teacher, ‘many-sided interest’; the best ultimate 
aim, ‘character-forming.’”? 
With this attitude towards mental process, in spite 
of the excessive and needless array of technical terms 
in which it is expressed, little fault can be found, but 
there is no element in it that can properly be described 
as Herbartian. We have here a sketch of a very 
common, indeed of the only possible attitude in educa- 
tional psychology, the attitude which recognizes that 
mental processes must be considered from two stand- 
points: (1) from that which looks on mental content, 
and to some extent on mental existence, as built up by 
experience, the result of this experience in the mind 
being meanings or ideas which are associated and 
linked together, in other words, ‘which believes that 
much mental life can be interpreted in terms of ideas’; 
(2) from that which regards mind as a unified entity, 
conscious of itself as struggling and striving in a certain 
direction, in other words, ‘which believes that factors 
like feeling and will are primitive and fundamental.’ 
The first standpoint is necessary in dealing with all 
phases of education that involve the imparting or 
acquisition of knowledge, the second must in part be 
adopted when ‘will’ and ‘character’ are in question. 
Modern writers on psychology adopt both these stand- 
points, though they do not always seem clearly to 
realize this, and pass from one to the other as it suits 
their purpose to do so, Further, when working from 
1 Op. cit., Preface, p. x. 
   
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
the associationist standpoint they frequently use terms 
which were introduced into the language of association- 
ism by Herbart. Generally these terms are not used in 
their strict Herbartian sense, but it must be recognized 
that Herbartian terminology has exercised a powerful 
influence on the modes of expression adopted by 
prominent psychologists such as Dr. G. F. Stout in 
England and Dr. Th. Lipps in Germany. These 
writers are, however, no more Herbartians than the 
persons who in speaking use the ‘quotations’ to be 
found in Shakespeare are to be called Shakespeareans. 
For the Herbartian doctrine of the mind and its 
constitution is something definite which is not shared by 
modern writers on psychology. 
For Herbart the mind is primarily intellectual, that is 
to say, it consists of presentations, or, to adopt the usual 
English terminology, ideas. Herbart recognized, it is 
true, that the mind is not purely intellectual, that we 
are conscious of feelings, and that, when in a certain 
mental state, we talk of ourselves as ‘willing’; but 
for him feeling and will are derivative. Feeling arises 
out of the interplay and mutual inhibition and further- 
ance of ideas, while will similarly arises out of the 
interplay of feelings. The Herbartian position is not 
that feeling and will are influenced by ideas, but that 
feeling and will arise out of presentations or ideas, which 
is a vastly different matter. 
The result of a rigorous application of the true 
Herbartian doctrine to problems of education is easily 
seen, Character-forming in some sense or other is 
admitted to be an important aim in education; in one 
aspect character is identical with will, will arises out of 
the interplay of ideas, and therefore character is the
-P-A-G-E-9
  PREFACE ix 
result of ideas properly presented to the mind, in other 
words, of a good instruction. It is but a step from this 
position to lay excessive stress on the value of direct 
moral instruction and to believe that the best way to 
make a child moral is to talk to him about morality. In 
addition, the thorough-paced Herbartian must deny and 
ridicule the notion that any kind of formal training can 
be given to the mind or to the feelings ; for instance, he 
must find it absurd to imagine that self-control grows 
easier in proportion to its exercise. 
The psychological position outlined above is that 
which Dr. Hayward must adopt if he is with any sense 
to call himself a Herbartian, and these are the educational 
corollaries of that position. Now it happens that these 
corollaries are in fact the educational views which he 
advocates, and it is therefore legitimate to suppose that 
Dr. Hayward is in error when he maintains that the 
attitude described in his own words on page vi, which 
he calls Herbartianism, is in reality the basis of his 
educational position. Indeed, a number of expressions 
in his books show that as soon as he begins to apply 
his psychology he is applying not the modern position 
which he chooses to term Herbartianism, but Herbart’s 
psychology in its purity. Two instances must suffice. 
“The ‘will’ is not a separate faculty, but is rooted in 
the circle of thought.”! “The case (for moral instruc- 
tion) . . . seems stronger yet when we look at moral 
ideas in the Herbartian way—not as mere knowledge 
acting distantly upon the desires, the motives and the 
will, but as the roots of these.”? Neither of these state- 
ments is in accordance with what Dr. Hayward calls 
‘Herbartianism’; but they are both undiluted Herébart. 
1 Education and the Heredity Spectre, p. 98. 2 bid. p. 103. 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
  = SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
I have, I trust, made it clear that this controversy is 
merely a question of terms. Dr. Hayward has of course 
a right to call any position that he pleases Herbartian- 
ism, as long as he makes it evident that by this term he 
does not mean an application of Herbart’s psychology 
to education. The term would still be a mischievous 
and a misleading one, but if it were used consistently 
it might be allowed. Dr. Hayward, as I have shown 
above, is not consistent, for when he deals with moral 
instruction he forgets all about his definition of 
‘Herbartianism,’ and becomes a true Herbartian. 
(2) Dr. Hayward’s other charge is easily disposed of. 
He complains that I have not explained “where con- 
trariant ideas come from.” In so far as they do not 
enter the mind from without, they arise out of the 
instinct of combativeness, and the term ‘contrariant 
idea’ may be looked upon as the associationist mode of 
expressing the working of this instinct in the boy’s 
mental system. During the period of adolescence the 
instinct of combativeness is especially strong, and it is at 
this stage that contrariant ideas are most to be en- 
countered and render moral education most difficult.

SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
CHAPTER I 
1IYPNOTIC SUGGESTION 
A SUGGESTIVE teacher, a suggestive book, a suggestive 
picture, a suggestive situation—these are the terms in 
which we speak of the people, the books, the pictures, and 
the situations that have made a deep impression on us, 
that have set going a train of thought which refuses to be 
quieted until it has worked itself out to a satisfactory 
conclusion, and which gives us no rest until we have 
altered our aims, our circumstances, and even our 
characters, so that the idea suggested may the more 
easily become realised. These are the teachers and the 
books that count. Other teachers are hired like waiters 
and perform their duties like hirelings ; other books are 
bought and sold like pounds of tea and serve to 
foster the modern habit of idly looking at print. But 
the real teacher and the real book! We come across 
them but seldom, we treasure them, if we have any 
insight, while occasion permits, and we part from 
them reluctantly, not knowing when we may find them 
again. For the same person and even the same book 
may not always be suggestive. The subtle quality is

there on one occasion; we seek it on another and it 
is gone. The quintessence has evaporated ; the con- 
tribution that we ourselves made towards the blend is 
not forthcoming; whatever the reason, may be, the 
magic is no longer to be found. The book seems 
duller, the teacher seems more commonplace. As we 
look back upon our teachers and our books we recognise 
with gratitude a few that lived. But how few they are, 
and how many are the others! 
Can any instrument be discovered that will give us 
control over these situations? Is there any process of 
analysis or of observation that will disclose to us the 
conditions of suggestion, the method of presenting ideas 
in such a way that they live in the minds of our hearers ? 
Is there no apprenticeship that insures a mastery over 
the master-art? Or is the very word “method” an 
absurdity in such a connexion? Are the processes 
that we are considering so personal, so dependent on 
rare combinations of individuality and circumstance, 
so elusive and so volatile, that the attempt to objectify 
them and to publish their secrets is like the endeavour to 
catch on canvas the opaline tint of the Atlantic breaker 
as it rears and falls; like the impudent effort to re- 
produce a violin performance by Kreisler on the 
gramophone or a passionate nocturne of Chopin on 
the pianola? 
The present essay, while it does not pretend to give 
a complete answer to these questions, has as its aim the 
investigation of the meaning that underlies the term 
“suggestion,” the analysis of its conditions, and the 
consideration of its importance for education. 
The nature of suggestion, as of all mental processes,
-P-A-G-E-17
     HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION 3 
is most easily discovered by the examination of extreme 
cases. It is in the pathology of mind that we see 
written large the traits that elude us in the normal state. 
Our starting-point will therefore be a brief description 
of hypnotic suggestion. 
The general characteristic of suggestion in the 
hypnotic state is that an idea when introduced into the 
mind tends to realise itself immediately in movement, 
sensation, emotion, or belief. The simplest form of 
suggestion is perhaps exemplified by the imitation of 
movements. The hypnotised subject will remain motion- 
less with open eyes. When questioned he says that 
he is thinking of nothing, and makes no movement 
spontaneously. In this condition he imitates auto- 
matically every movement that is made before him.1 
A variety of this phenomenon is speech-imitation, some- 
times called ¢holalie, when the subject ceases to reply to 
questions that are put to him and simply repeats them.” 
1 “] place myself in front of him and move my head gently from side to 
side. After a few seconds’ hesitation he performs the same movement. I raise 
my arms, he raises his arms; I move as if I were nursing a baby, he makes 
the same movements. I scratch my nose, I place my hands behind my back, 
I walk, I pull my handkerchief from my pocket, I blow my nose, I sneeze, 
The patient imitates all my movements servilely and copies all my attitudes” 
(Pitres, Lecons cliniques sur I’ Hystérie et ' Hypnotisme, 1891). 
2 This phenomenon is produced, says Berger of Breslau, ‘‘ by placing one 
hand on the head of the somnambulistic patient, selecting either the forehead 
or the back of the neck. Immediately the subject, who has hitherto replied 
at once to questions that were asked, ceases to reply, but repeats the questions, 
He is, as it were, converted into a phonograph. He can be made sing, cry, 
cough, and sneeze. He will repeat words spoken in foreign languages, and 
will do this with a fidelity which is often surprising” (Grasset, Hypnotisme et 
Suggestion, 1903, p. 183). 
According to Moll, this imitation is conscious and not unconscious. 
«<The notion that only certain tracts of the bodily surface must be stimulated 
in order to produce this repetition may be considered a mistake on the part 
of the Breslau investigators. I believe that the hypnotic echoes what he 
believes he is intended to echo. It is certain that some persons are able to 
perform great feats in this way, imitating a hitherto unknown language 
quickly and correctly, particularly after the necessary practice” (Moll, 
Hypnotism, p. 99).
-P-A-G-E-18
  4 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
Similarly negative suggestions of movement can be 
made. The experimenter says to the subject, “You 
cannot advance.” He immediately stands still and 
makes fruitless efforts to move. He rests glued to the 
spot. If the experimenter continues, “ Your legs cannot 
carry you,” he falls as if paralysed. If he says, “ Your 
right leg is paralysed,” he drags along his right leg 
as though it were powerless. Even the involuntary 
muscular system can be affected by suggestion. The 
effect of a dose of castor oil can be prevented or 
postponed, and pure water can be made to act as an 
emetic. Organic changes also, such as blisters, can be 
produced.? 
No less remarkable are the manifestations of sugges- 
tion in the domains of sensation and perception. The 
subject can be made to see an object as red or blue 
according to the will of the experimenter. A good 
example of a visual illusion is the well-known one of 
the portrait. It is suggested to the subject that there 
is a portrait on one of a number of blank cards. Not 
only will he see the portrait, but he will always see it 
on the same side of the card and pointing in the same 
direction. In the same way the sense of taste can be 
affected. “I make my subject drink water or vinegar 
instead of wine. I make him breathe ammonia instead 
of eau de Cologne. A pencil in his mouth does in- 
stead of a cigar, of which he sucks up the aroma 
1 Forel, at Zurich, made experiments on a nurse twenty-three years of age 
and not at all hysterical. ‘‘ A gummed label was fixed on her chest above 
each breast: the paper was square. In no case was an irritating gum used. 
At midday Forel suggested that a blister had been put on the left side; and 
at six o’clock in the evening a moist spot had appeared in this place ; the 
skin was swollen and reddened around it, and a little inflammation had 
appeared also on the right side, but much less. Forel then did away with 
the suggestion. On the next day there was a scab on the left side” (Moll, 
op. cit. P. 135).
-P-A-G-E-19
  HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION 5 
with delight, blowing into the air clouds of imaginary 
smoke.” ! 
It would be easy to multiply instances of sense 
illusions, but as the object in view is merely to set 
forth the general characteristics of hypnotic suggestion, 
a few examples must serve as types. Of special interest 
are suggestions of sense anesthesia, or, as they are 
sometimes called, negative sense suggestions. Here 
anesthesia, generally connected with a certain degree 
of motor paralysis, can be suggested for any portion of 
the body, and a negative suggestion, often of a very 
partial kind, can be made for any sense organ. In this 
condition the subject is unable to see an object or a 
portion of an object that is placed before his eyes, or to 
hear a person who is talking to him. A development 
of the suggestion of sense illusion is the introduction of 
an idea which of itself produces a system of ideas 
embodying a complete situation. In this case it is 
merely necessary to start the subject off. His 
imagination will then supply the rest.2 A striking 
instance of this is afforded when the subject is told 
that he is taking part in some scene of his previous 
experience. A volunteer, for example, when told 
that he is at the drill hall, will act an imaginary 
1 Bernheim, Suggestion, 3rd ed. 1891, p. 44. 
2 Richet said to a subject, ‘‘ ‘Come with me, we shall go out and travel.’ 
Then the patient described in order the places that they passed—the corridors 
of the hospital and the roads which she traversed to reach the station. As 
she was familiar with all these places, she described with accuracy the spots 
that her imagination and her memory, both equally excited, presented to her 
in the guise of reality. Then suddenly it was possible to transport her to a 
distant spot that she did not know—to Como, for example, or to the Arctic 
regions. Her imagination, left to itself, gave itself up to ideas that did not 
lack charm, and that were interesting from their apparent precision. We 
were always surprised by the vivacity with which she took in these imaginary 
perceptions” (Richet, Z'’Homme et I' Intelligence, p. 178).

scene and talk of the officers and friends whom he sees 
present.! 
Most striking of all are the cases in which it is 
suggested to the subject that he is another personality, 
a peasant, a general, or an archbishop. He will readily

on :—

. Chaps waiting to drill. (He laughs suddenly. )

. Two chaps wrestling there. (I find that he is analgesic and anesthetic ; 
evidently he is in a state of passive somnambulism. ) 
£. A. Did you feel anybody touch you? 
&. No. There’s no one near me. (He continues laughing and talking. 
He says, ‘‘ You can’t wrestle in jiujutsu style—you don’t know what to do, 
do you? No, I won't have to go to-night.” ) 
£. A. Who are you talking to? 
&. Talking to this chap ‘ere, Brown. He thinks he can wrestle. (Laughs. 
Suddenly stands up and moves as if taking off his hat. ) 
£, A. What are you doing? 
X. That's an officer ; didn’t you see him? 
£, A. No, I wasn't looking. 
&. Well, you ought to have been. You'll get into trouble if you don't 
take off your hat when you see an officer. (He goes on talking to imaginary 
people who are apparently trying to persuade him to wrestle. . . . He is at 
last persuaded. ) 
£, A. Now then, stand up. 
. Well, we won't hurt one another ; just a friendly. (Wrestles with an 
imaginary opponent. ) 
&. A. Now you've got him, Hit him hard ; hurt him. 
. No, I don’t want to hurt him. 
£. A. Do you see that chap over there? He's making faces at you. Go 
and punch his head. 
. (Refuses this idea, laughs a good deal; he is a good-natured chap, 
and refuses all suggestions that he should hurt the other man in any way. 
Says I’m Steve Barton.) 
£. A. Come and have a drink. 
K. No; I don't feel like drinking to-night, Steve ; besides, you know I 
never drink. 
£. A. Never mind. Here's a glass of whisky and water. (I put an 
empty glass into his hand.)

the sergeant, he'll drink it. _What—won't he? (And so on; no persuasion 
will make him drink it. I offer him five pounds to drink it.) 
K. Well, of course, anybody will do it for a fiver. Some fellows would 
for a shilling. (After being given an imaginary fiver and some argument, he 
drinks it, and then mocks at whisky as an unpleasant drink.) (E. Ash,

take up the suggestion, and will speak and act the part 
with great accuracy. His own personality is for the 
moment completely obscured.! 
We are now in a position to consider some of the 
respects in which the mind in hypnosis is different from 
the mind in the waking state. In all these cases an 
idea is suggested and in each instance it is accepted 
uncritically. There is a complete inhibition of the 
natural tendency to ask if the suggested idea is true or 
reasonable. The results of past experience appear to 
be present in the mind only so far as they tend to 
further the development of the suggested idea; so far 
as they might counteract it they are inoperative. All 
the contrariant ideas to which the mind owes its power 
to persist and to hold its own against the impressions 
made upon it by the environment are for the time being 
non-existent. If in the waking state I feel an inclination 
1 Richet gives the following example. The subject, the mother of a 
family, and of a religious turn of mind, is hypnotised, and is told that she 
is a peasant. 
‘She rubs her eyes and stretches herself. ‘What o'clock is it? Four 
o'clock.’ She walks as if she were dragging along her sabots, ‘Well, I 
must get up. Let’s go to the stable. There's the red cow. Turn round. 
(She pretends to milk a cow.) Leave me alone, Gros-Jean, I tell you. Wait 
till I've finished my work, You know that I’ve not finished my work.’ 
“She is told she is a general. ‘Hand me the field-glass. That's right. 
Where is the captain of the first Zouaves? ‘There are the Kroumirs, I see 
them coming up the ravine. Commandant, take a company and charge 
them. They are fine fellows those Zouaves. How well they climb! What 
do you want, you? What, no orders? (Aside) He is a poor officer, he can 
do nothing. You on the left, look sharp. (Aside) He's better. . . . Fetch 
me my horse, my sword . . . Ah, I’m wounded.’ 
«She is told that she is a priest, and thinks she is the Archbishop of 
Paris. Her face becomes serious. Her voice grows sweet and honied, and 
is in great contrast to the rough voice of the last personification. ‘ Ah, it’s 
you, Monsieur le Grand Vicaire. What do you want? I don’t want to be 
disturbed. . . . Yes, this is the rst of January, and we must go to the 
Cathedral. The crowd is very respectful, isn’t it, Monsieur le Grand 
Vicaire? There is much religion in the masses, whatever people may say. 
Ah, there is a child. Let him come up and I'll bless him.’ She gives him 
her ring (imaginary) to kiss. During the whole scene with her right hand 
she makes signs of benediction” (Richet, of. ci#. p. 237).

to imitate a movement that will not in any way aid the 
train of thought or of action on which I am engaged, 
my tendency is to inhibit it. If I find that I am 
beginning to swing my leg because some one else is 
swinging his leg, I stop the motion under the influence 
of some such train of thought, which may be only half 
formulated, as “ How stupid of me. I really must not 
let myself go like this.” If I suddenly find that I am 
beginning to stammer or to yawn because I am in the 
society of some one who stammers or yawns, I immedi- 
ately take pains either to inhibit the tendency or to 
remove myself from the companionship. If I find that I 
am growing careless about my dress and ‘my personal 
appearance because I am constantly in the society of 
slovenly people, I take pains to prevent the habit from 
growing upon me. It is only when the imitation is 
confessedly of advantage to the immediate aims of the 
imitator that it is consciously allowed to persist; in all 
other cases there is an effort on the part of contrariant 
ideas to counteract the tendency and check it. 
The more striking cases of hypnotic suggestion make 
it evident that these contrariant ideas are necessary for 
the very existence of an individual mind. If I am told 
that a certain colour is red, when my senses tell me that 
it is blue, I repel the suggestion with vigour. In order 
to convince me that the suggestion is worthy of credence, 
it would be necessary to prove to me that I was colour- 
blind, and that the consensus of the opinion of people 
otherwise worthy of belief was against me. Even then, 
though I might think it worth while to consider the 
suggestion, it is by no means certain that I should 
adopt it. Still less should I be inclined to listen to the 
suggestion that a blank card had a portrait on it, or that

suggestions would only be laughed at. 
It is comparatively easy to induce a friend to transport 
himself back into a previous experience, and in reply 
to a few questions he will give you an account of a 
remembered situation; or again, if he had a lively 
imagination he would, at your request, imagine himself 
to be a priest or a general, and would act the part ; but 
in neither of these cases, either through your statement 
or through his own partial acceptance of the situation, 
would he for a moment be led to think that he was in 
any place or time but the present, or that his personality 
had really undergone a change. In hypnosis each of 
these suggestions is accepted uncritically, and, once 
accepted, it takes possession of the mind and allows 
association to go on only within the limits that suit the 
controlling idea. 
It is necessary to lay stress on this inhibition of the 
contrariant ideas that would otherwise reject the sugges- 
tion as being the principal element in the state that we 
call hypnosis. It will be seen later that the processes 
of suggestion in hypnosis have their counterpart in the 
waking state, and it is desirable to isolate the precise 
element whose absence or whose presence in a greater or 
a less degree constitutes the essential difference between 
the abnormal and the normal condition. This is not 
done by some of the current definitions of suggestion. 
Moll, for example, describes it as follows: ‘“ The different 
commands which are given to the subject in the experi- 
ments described, the prompting and persuasion, are 
called suggestion.”1 Here the expressions used are 
singularly unhappy. It is quite true that the suggestions 
1 Moll, of. cit. p. 36.
-P-A-G-E-24
  10 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
given in many cases take the form of commands, but the 
essential difference between a command given in the 
waking state and a suggestion given in hypnosis is that 
the first may or may not be obeyed, while the second is 
automatically acted upon. “ Persuasion” again is an un- 
fortunate term. It may occasionally be necessary to use 
persuasion with a hypnotised subject, but this is not the 
essential element in the process of suggestion. Moll 
improves upon this description later on. “We may 
then consider hypnosis as a state in which the normal 
course of the ideas is inhibited. It matters not whether 
the ideas have to do with movements or with sense 
impressions. We have seen that their normal course is 
always inhibited. In particular, the subject is unable 
to control the external ideas or to put forward his 
own; the external ones dominate his consciousness.” 1 
Undoubtedly the normal course is inhibited, but in a 
peculiar way, and the word “inhibition” alone does not 
differentiate the inhibition peculiar to hypnosis from the 
inhibition that takes place when I am unable to attend 
to a train of thought on account of toothache, or from 
that which is found when my attention to an interesting 
novel distracts my mind from my Christmas bills. In 
one direction the normal course of ideas in hypnosis is 
not inhibited at all. Within the closed system which is 
excited by the initial suggestion association goes on in a 
manner which is wholly normal in kind and abnormal 
only in degree. When it is suggested to a subject that he 
is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the train of associa- 
tion through which he marshals figures and imposes or 
lightens taxation is a perfectly normal one ; the peculiar 
element is the inhibition of all the trains of association 
1 Moll, of. cit. p. 279.
-P-A-G-E-25
HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION II 
that would lead him to repel the suggestion and would 
bring up into his mind the conviction that the statement 
is an absurd one. The normal course of the ideas is 
inhibited, but in a very limited manner. 
Similarly the definition given by Dr. O. Stoll does 
not bring out the essential nature of the phenomenon. 
“The expression ‘suggestion’ in the beginning betokens 
nothing more than an idea which is called up in us in 
various manners by the organic and inorganic world 
without us, and which forms for us the initial point of 
further processes of thought, although we may not be 
fully conscious of the original connexion. Our daily life 
affords countless examples of such suggestive influences.”? 
This definition of suggestion differentiates it in no 
way from redintegration and the action of the sub- 
conscious, which are the common bases of mental life. 
By “suggestion” Wundt understands “ association accom- 
panied by a narrowing of consciousness upon the ideas 
brought up by association, so that antagonistic psychic 
combinations do not come into play.” This definition 
gives the general conditions more accurately than the 
preceding one, but fails to bring out that the essential 
element is the absence of the contrariant ideas to a quite 
abnormal degree. Association is common to all states of 
mind, and the limits of consciousness are often much 
narrower in the waking state than in hypnosis, so that it 
does not help matters to bring them in as differentiating 
marks of suggestion. 
Fuller and better is the definition of suggestion 
given by Dr. von Schrenk-Notzing.2 “Suggestion is 
the narrowing of the association-activity to definite

12 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
contents of consciousness, solely through the employ- 
ment of memory and imagination in such a way that 
the influence of combinations of contrariant ideas is 
weakened or removed, as a result of which the intensity 
of the suggested content of consciousness rises above 
the normal.” Here again the “narrowing of the 
association-activity to definite contents of consciousness” 
is common to all states of the waking mind, and should, 
therefore, not be given as in itself an explanation of 
hypnosis ; but the aloofness from sensory experience, the 
absence of contrariant systems, and the resulting in- 
tensity of the idea in consciousness, are well brought out.! 
1 The importance of limiting the meaning of the term suggestion ‘‘at the 
outset” is shown by its employment in a misleading sense by so eminent a 
writer as Dr. G. F. Stout. To the general position that ideas brought into 
combination tend to modify one another, and that if of a previously experienced 
train of ideas, one of them be brought up by an idea which is similar to but 
not exactly like it, the remainder of the ideas will be redintegrated in a 
relatively altered form, he gives the name of ‘‘relative suggestion.” ‘‘ If the 
presented content 4 has formed part of a presented whole dc, then the pre- 
sented content 8 when it recurs, will tend to call up a whole By formally 
corresponding to éc.'’ As examples of this he gives the variation in the 
meaning of a word according to the context. ‘‘ Consider the variations in 
the meaning of the word ‘home’ in the following sentence: ‘I am going 
home.’ This may mean something different according as I say it on my 
death-bed or to a friend in the street.’’ Or the term is applied to the guidance 
given to the mind by a series of ideas standing to one another in some uniform 
and progressive relation. A subject is shown a series of shades of colour in a 
scale ascending gradually from the deepest to the lightest, but in which one shade 
is omitted, and is asked to supply the missing colour. If he succeeds, ‘‘ it must 
be noted that, for our purpose, the question whether the person has had experi- 
ence of this particular shade of colour before is irrelevant. By hypothesis it 
is not the associations which it has acquired in our previous experience of it 
which now recall it. What is really operative is the form of the series. 
Represent the series by B,BoB3B,B, ; B, and B, suggest B,, not because they 
have been previously associated with B,, but because B,:B,::B,:B,; and 
B,: By: :B,:B;” (Analytical Psychology, ii. p. 55). 
Again, ‘‘A very clear instance of relative suggestion is supplied by the 
singing or mental repetition of a tune in a different key from that in which it 
has been previously heard. The absolute is not given by the key-note, which 
may vary. The identity of the tune is preserved by correspondence in the 
transition between the notes” (/ééd. ii. p. 57). 
All these cases illustrate the law of psychological relativity. My previous 
experiences, though now forgotten, the present content of my consciousness,

We may now consider some of the other characteristics 
of the flow of ideas in hypnosis. It must not be sup- 
posed that all suggestions are adopted with equal facility. 
If the proposition made to the subject is greatly opposed 
to his habits or his convictions it may be rejected. A 
subject will refuse to pummel the man whom he has 
worsted in a wrestling-match, because this is inconsistent 
with his kindly disposition. He may need persuasion 
before he will drink whisky, since this is contrary to his 
habits. Even in hypnosis, therefore, the inhibition of 
resistance and the destruction of personality is only 
partial. This is borne out by abundant testimony.* 
my subconscious feelings, and my conscious aim, all modify profoundly the 
manner in which I grasp or apperceive a newly-presented idea, and determine 
the nature and direction of the association train set up by it. The term 
“relative” used in this connexion is legitimate; to employ the word 
“*suggestion” is merely misleading. The idea or the series of ideas tends to 
exclude contrariant ideas only in the sense that all ideas or series of ideas 
which occupy the mind, by this very occupation exclude competing ideas that 
tend to dislodge them. In the instances given above, ‘‘ suggestion” is simply 
the introduction of ideas, and if the term be used as loosely as this, all 
initiation of thought is suggestion, and every idea that is attended to in a 
train of association is a suggestive idea, in that it tends to call up some other 
idea in a manner or with an aspect that suits the context. This use, as we 
have seen, obscures the salient features of suggestion, and, as will be evident 
later, leads to a misapprehension of their real nature. It is only fair to say 
that farther on in the same work Dr. Stout, in his description of suggestibility, 
uses the term in its proper sense. ‘‘In the mind of a suggestible person 
apperceptive systems are excited almost wholly by the commands, words, 
gestures, etc., of another person, and not by their own mutual competition 
and co-operation. It follows that conflict is almost absent except in so far 
as conflicting groups are simultaneously excited by suggestion” (Analytical 
Psychology, ii. 154). 
1 «It is generally very difficult successfully to suggest anything that is 
opposed to the confirmed habits of the subject. For instance, suggestions 
are made to a devout Catholic, but directly the suggestion conflicts with his 
creed it will not be accepted. The surroundings play a part also. A subject 
frequently declines a suggestion that will make him appear ridiculous. A 
woman whom I easily put into cataleptic postures, and who made suggested 
movements, could not be induced to put out her tongue at the spectators. 
In another such case I succeeded, but only after repeated suggestions” 
(Moll, of. cit. p. 188). 
“The somnambulist might, I believe, be made by frequent induction of 
hypnosis to do foolish and even criminal acts, but no suggestion made to an
-P-A-G-E-28
    
14 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
A consideration of memory in hypnosis brings out 
some further characteristics of abnormal suggestibility. 
In the waking state that succeeds all except the lighter 
hypnoses, there is a complete loss of memory for the 
contents of the mind during hypnosis. The subject, 
however, while in this hypnotic dream remembers all 
the events of previous hypnoses, so that if he is 
frequently hypnotised during a term of years, there 
come into being two distinct memory series each 
independent of the other. If the waking memory 
be represented by W and the hypnotic memory by 
H, then if the succession of states is symbolised by 
W,H,W,H,W,H,W,H,W,H,, there is one continuous 
memory seriesW,W,W,W,W,and another H,H,H,H,H,. 
The series H, . . . H; displays some special features that 
distinguish it from the series W,...W,. If care be 
taken to avoid the suggestion of improved memory, 
which, if effective, would vitiate the experiment, the 
hypnotic memory is weaker than the waking memory. 
According to Max Dessoir, who put a subject through 
some of the ordinary tests for immediate memory, the 
hypnotised person remembers fewer syllables than does 
he when awake.! On the other hand, under the influence 
of suggestion, the power of remembering bygone events 
seems to be greatly increased, and the subject, if told 
that he is at some previous date in his existence, will 
reproduce details with extraordinary facility. 
ordinary subject will be executed unless it be in accordance with his wish. 
For instance, it would be useless to suggest to a staunch teetotaller in any 
stage of hypnosis short of somnambulism that he should drink brandy. The 
suggestion would defeat its own end by arousing indignation and disgust. 
Such a suggestion made to a somnambulist might be obeyed the first time, 
but it would probably require frequent repetition to break down resistance 
and overcome his individuality” (C. Lloyd-Tuckey, M.D., Treatment by 
Hypnotism and Suggestion, 4th ed, 1900). 
1 Moll, of. cit, p. 140.
-P-A-G-E-29
HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION 15 
To what extent these details are really accurate has 
not yet been clearly shown, but undoubtedly events 
which have been completely forgotten in the waking 
state recur in the hypnotic state with some degree of 
accuracy, and there are cases in which the command of 
a language completely forgotten by the normal memory 
has been partially recovered by the hypnotic memory. 
Apart from these differences, the two memories function 
in the same way according to the ordinary laws of asso- 
ciation and redintegration. 
The hypnotic memory brings into prominence a 
peculiar feature of hypnosis. The mental system tends 
to split up into a number of independent series, each 
working in a relatively water-tight compartment. This 
tendency is further illustrated by the rapid change of 
personality that can be produced within one state of 
hypnosis. The subject is first told that he is the 
Emperor of Germany, adopts this suggestion, and speaks 
and acts in the manner that seems to him suitable. 
Within the limits of this personality he will be con- 
sistent, his memory will be continuous, and he will reject 
suggestions that are not in keeping with the part. The 
suggestion of a fresh personality is, however, readily 
taken up: the next minute he will become the President 
of the United States, and a few minutes later he may be 
a Red Indian or a Japanese general, and for each of 
these states his imagination, aided by a memory which 
is continuous for the character, will suggest a suitable 
system of ideas and of actions, 
This dissociation of the whole psychical system and 
disintegration of the unity which characterises the 
normal waking state is the great characteristic of 
hypnosis. The inability of the contrariant or critical
-P-A-G-E-30
16 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
idea to function when a suggestion is made or a com- 
mand is given is only one instance of it. Just as various 
' systems of memory series are split off from one another 
and have a relatively independent existence, so the 
whole system of ideas that represents the results of 
definite experience as well as general notions of what 
is probable or of what is fitting is put on one side, the 
painter is slipped, and a small idea-system is left to float, 
a frail bark, on the waves of imagination, guided first in 
one direction then in another by every fresh suggestion 
that takes the helm. 
The close connexion of dissociation with suggesti- 
bility and the symptoms of hypnosis is strikingly 
illustrated by the cases of plural personality that have 
been under investigation of recent years. In both 
France and the United States psychologists have had 
under observation patients who seem to combine two, 
three, or even more personalities, and who shift from 
one to the other in an unaccountable manner and after 
varying intervals of time. Of the different personalities 
united in the same individual one has sometimes a full 
knowledge of the others, but more often their memory 
systems are entirely or almost entirely independent of 
one another. These subjects, even when not in the state 
of hypnosis, present many of the curious phenomena 
often associated with it. Their powers of sense-percep- 
tion are unusually keen, and negative suggestions pro- 
ducing sense-anzesthesia can be made.! 
There still remains to be considered an important 
characteristic of suggestion, and this perhaps the one of 
most interest to the educator. If a suggestion is made 
1 See Appendix, p. 195. 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION 17 
in hypnosis, in spite of the discontinuity of memory, 
there is always a tendency when the waking state is 
resumed for fragments of the suggested ideas to remain 
on the fringe of consciousness, unless they are removed 
by express suggestion or command before the subject 
is awakened. Further, if during hypnosis it is suggested 
that a certain act shall be performed, the suggestion 
very frequently takes effect in the waking state which 
follows.! The subject, however, when he feels an impulse 
to perform some strange action does not ascribe it to 
the influence of the hypnotiser, but looks upon it as 
originating with himself, and tries to justify it. 
1 T hypnotise the subject F. when she is in bed, and tell her to dress 
herself when she awakes, to go to the end of the room, to come back, and to 
get into bed again. I rouse her out of the hypnotic state. She begins to 
dress, ‘Why do you dress?’ I ask. ‘I have something to do,’ she replies, 
and adds that it is unpleasant to dress with people in the room. When 
dressed she goes to the end of the room, comes back, and returns to bed. On 
waking she is much surprised to find herself in bed with her clothes on. On 
another occasion I said to her when hypnotised that on awakening she would 
not see Brousse (who was really there), but that she would see Mossé, who 
was not. On waking she began to speak to Mossé, whom she thought she 
saw, and when Brousse (whom she did. not see) answered, ‘ How is it,’ she 
said, ‘that I hear M. Brousse, but that I do not see him, and that M. Mossé, 
who is in front of me, does not speak?’ The hallucination, both positive and 
negative, was but visual" (Grasset, of. cit, p. 301). 
It is interesting to note that the subject feels an impulse to dress, looks on 
it as originating with herself, and tries to excuse it. 
2 An example given by Moll illustrates this well. ‘‘I say to a hypnotised 
woman, ‘After you wake you will take a book from the table and put it on 
the book-shelf.’ She wakes and does what I told her. When I ask her 
what she has been doing, she answers that she has moved the book from the 
table to the shelf. When asked for her reason, she says, ‘I do not like to 
see things so untidy ; the shelf is the place for the book, and that is why I 
put it there.’ In this case I suggested an action to the subject ; she does not 
remember my order, but believes that she has so acted of her own accord 
from love of neatness.”’” 
Again, ‘‘I tell a hynotised subject that when he wakes he is to take a 
flower-pot from the window, wrap it in a cloth, put it on the sofa, and bow 
to it three times. All which he does. When he is asked for his reasons, he 
answers, ‘You know, when I woke and saw the flower-pot there, I thought 
that, as it was rather cold, the flower-pot had better be warmed a little, or 
else the plant would die. So I wrapped it in the cloth, and then I thought 
that as the sofa was near the fire, I would put the flower-pot on it; and I

The suggestion often works after a considerable lapse 
of time. A case with a duration of 63 days is given by 
Bernheim, of 172 days by Beaunis, and of one year by 
Liégois.!_ In some cases, in addition to the retention of 
the suggestion, a kind of subconscious calculation seems 
to be carried on at the same time. A young woman 
was told to address an envelope to Dr. Bramwell 12,500 
minutes from the moment of awakening, and carried out 
the instruction accurately. 
The principle of post-hypnotic suggestion is the basis 
of all therapeutic hypnotism, and while it is no part of 
the aim of this essay to advise or to discuss the use of 
hypnotism in moral training, the whole subject of sug- 
gestive medicine is so closely allied to that of suggestive 
education that no apology need be offered for giving a 
few cases. 
Dr. Lloyd-Tuckey gives a table of cures of alcoholism 
by hypnotism, showing that out of 22 cases which were 
strongly inherited, and where several members of the 
same family suffered from chronic alcoholism, 5 were 
completely cured ; while out of 43 cases where there was 
no such hereditary disposition, 10 were completely 
cured.? 
Liébault cured a man of the symptoms of nicotine 
poisoning and of the desire to smoke in a week. At the 
Nancy Congress on Hypnotism he gave an account of a 
child, seven years old, who was so obtuse as to be almost 
an idiot. This child was subjected to hypnotic treatment, 
and so benefited by suggestion that in three months he 
bowed because I was pleased with myself for having such a bright idea.’ He 
added that he did not consider the proceeding foolish ; he had told me his 
reason for so acting” (Moll, of. cif. p. 170). 1 Grasset, Hypnotisme et Suggestion, p. 314.

could read, write, and understand the four rules of 
arithmetic. 
Lloyd-Tuckey has tried hypnotism in twelve cases of 
stammering, and in half of them has found it useful. 
In two cases, those of schoolboys, complete cure re- 
sulted, and in three cases there was so much general 
improvement that little inconvenience remained.1 
A remarkable case of moral treatment was reported 
from the Salpétritre. In 1884 a young woman of a 
deplorable type was admitted. She was a criminal 
lunatic, filthy in habits and violent in demeanour, with 
a lifelong history of impurity and theft. She was 
treated by hypnotism, and afterwards became a nurse 
in a Parisian hospital. At the second international 
Congress of Experimental Psychology, Dr. Bérillon, 
in a paper on the application of hypnotic suggestion 
to education, stated that he had treated with success 
such matters as cowardice and moral perversity. Dr. 
Osgood Mason also gives some interesting cases. 
1. A girl, fifteen years old, ina New York Grammar 
School. She was a good reader of history and biography 
and the better class of novels, but had no aptitude for 
class studies. She could not concentrate her mind on 
details that did not specially interest her, and could not 
remember her lessons. Teachers were engaged to give 
her special lessons to prepare her for the entrance 
examination to a Normal College, but they reported 
that she was hopeless. Hypnotic suggestion was tried. 
It was suggested that she would be able to concentrate 
her mind on her studies, that her memory would be 
improved, and that she would lose her excessive self- 
consciousness and timidity. After six treatments 
1 Lloyd-Tuckey, of. cit. p. 182.
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
she improved wonderfully, and passed an excellent 
examination. 
2. A little boy, seven years old. He was a terrible 
cry-baby, afraid of the slightest pain, and considered a 
coward by his playfellows. It was suggested that he 
would no longer be a crying, whimpering coward, but a 
strong, brave boy, and that he would stand up sturdily 
for his rights among his playfellows. After these 
suggestions there was an immense improvement. 
3. A tall, pale, flabby boy, aged sixteen. His habits 
were immoral, he smoked cigarettes to excess, his 
memory was impaired, he was dejected, dull, and 
unmanly. He was under hypnotic treatment for two 
and a half months. As result the immoral habits were 
cured in one month, the cigarettes were reduced to one 
a week, his memory and his interest in his work were 
greatly improved. 
4. A lady, an excellent pianist and teacher. She 
was unable to perform efficiently in public because of 
excessive nervousness and self-consciousness. Under 
suggestion her self-confidence was restored to her.! 
Dr. Mason asserts that the cures by hypnotic sug- 
gestion are just as lasting and become just as mucha 
part of character as those made by ordinary education 
and persuasion. Of this it would be well to have more 
detailed evidence than as yet has been forthcoming. 
The surgeon who enters a case in his books as a success 
because the patient has not died under treatment, or

mental dissociation produced by a strong emotional 
state, have many analogies with suggestion, are by no 
means always productive of a stable disposition. Making 
all allowances, however, these cases call for serious 
consideration, and cannot be overlooked by those who 
are responsible for the education of the young. 
There are many stages of the hypnotic trance.t 
In the lighter ones the patient never loses consciousness, 
while in the deeper ones he ceases to be in relation with 
the outer world and hears only what is said to him by 
the operator. For some of the experiments quoted 
above, such as those on sensory anesthesia, an advanced 
stage of hypnosis is necessary; but for many of the 
simpler phenomena the earlier stages are sufficient, and 
for therapeutic suggestion it is found that the earlier 
stages are as effective as the later ones. The increased 
force of suggestion, says Lloyd-Tuckey, “does not 
1 Liébault gives the following classification :— 
1st Degree.—The patient feels a heaviness of the eyelids and a general 
drowsiness. He is conscious of what goes on around him. 
2nd Degree.—This is characterised by suggestive catalepsy. When the 
operator places the arm in a certain position, and says that it is to remain 
there, it is impossible for the patient to put it down. It remains rigid and 
fixed for a much longer time than would be possible in the natural state. In 
this stage there is almost complete consciousness, and often the patient denies 
having been in the hypnotic state because he has heard and remembers every 
word that has been said tohim. A very large number of people never get 
beyond this stage. 
3rd Degree.—In this also the patient is to a certain extent conscious of 
everything around him; but he is oppressed by great sleepiness. A move- 
ment communicated to a limb is automatically continued. 
4th Degree.—In the fourth degree the patient ceases to be in relation with 
the outer world. He hears only what is said to him by the operator. 
sth and 6th Degrees.—These stages, according to Liebault, constitute 
somnambulism. After the former, recollection of what occurred during sleep 
is indistinct ; after the latter, the patient is unable to recall anything spontane- 
ously. All the phenomena of post-hypnotic suggestion can be induced in 
this condition. 
Bernheim finds nine stages, but his classification is merely a development 
of Liebault’s, and similarly traces the development of hypnosis from the stage 
of torpor to the somnambulistic stage.

depend so much as one might suppose on the profound- 
ness of the sleep. . . . My own experience, like that of 
all observers whom I have known, is that good results 
are effected when there has been no loss of consciousness, 
and even when the patient denies having felt any 
hypnotic influence.”! With this Dr. Osgood Mason is 
in agreement. “More good is accomplished by the 
slower process of repeated suggestion upon cases in 
which the hypnotic condition is only partially secured, 
and in which neither unconsciousness nor absolute 
anesthesia accompanies the processes employed ; and 
this is the use of suggestion to which I would especially 
apply the term educational.” ? 
It is evident, therefore, that a mental state which is 
very little different from that of ordinary waking 
consciousness is included by the authorities among 
hypnotic states, and for therapeutic purposes is considered 
to be as good as, if not better than, the profounder 
hypnoses. In what respects ordinary consciousness is 
unlike the earlier stages of hypnosis must be our next 
consideration.

CHAPTER II 
SUGGESTION IN THE WAKING STATE 
Most of the features that are to be found in hypnotic 
suggestion have their counterpart in the normal waking 
state. While the idea of a blister on the right arm will 
not originate one, the idea of a pain or of irritation in 
any part of the body is often quite sufficient to produce 
it. If a subject is made to believe that a vein in his 
arm has been opened, and if this belief is intensified by 
the sound of trickling water, he will show all the 
symptoms of bleeding to death. To brood over an 
ailment is the surest way of combating all efforts to 
cure it. 
With many people the mere statement that they are 
blushing is enough to produce a flow of blood to the 
face ; the repeated assurance that they are warm or cold 
will tend to make them feel warmer or colder. In the 
same way, if you assure an unsuspicious friend that 
there are cattle on the side of a distant hill, he will be 
ready to agree that he sees them; or when told that 
a church bell can just be heard in the distance, he will 
imagine that he hears it. Still more is imitation common 
in ordinary life. Few of us can for long be with people 
who have peculiar habits of movement without feeling a 
23 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
24 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
tendency to imitate them. As is well known, stammer- 
ing is frequently communicated from one child to 
another. In matters that are not of vital importance 
to the conduct of life, such as fashions in clothes and in 
foods, we slavishly imitate our neighbours; and even in 
weightier matters, such as systems of belief or moral 
standards, we tend to adopt without question those that 
we find around us. 
When conversing with a cheerful, amusing, and 
witty man, we instinctively feel cheerful ourselves, cap 
his jokes with our own, and come away feeling that we 
are, really, not such dull dogs as we thought, though in 
this case we generally take the credit to ourselves. 
Similarly, intercourse with a lugubrious friend makes us 
melancholy and dull, and in this case we are accus- 
tomed to blame the friend. In both instances the cause 
is probably motor imitation. The man whose spirits are 
contagious frequently has a mobile face. His feelings 
are reflected in the play of his features; we naturally 
tend to imitate this, and the state of feeling that corre- 
sponds with the imitated expression is produced in our 
minds. Closely connected with imitation is the influence 
exerted on social life by the idea-situations to be found 
in novels, Whole systems of ideas that deal with social 
situations or with ideals find their way into our minds, 
and quite unconsciously exert a profound influence 
upon our lives. Many men who pride themselves 
on their power of resisting external influences go 
through life as the most servile imitators in every depart- 
ment except that in which they resolutely determine 
to be unlike other people. Indeed, it may be argued 
that, just as mechanical habits are necessary in order 
to give leisure for the acquisition of fresh powers, so a
-P-A-G-E-39
SUGGESTION IN THE WAKING STATE 25 
complete acceptance of the recognised social institu- 
tions, of the fashion in hats, foods, and drinks, leaves the 
total energy of reaction undivided to break a fresh 
channel for itself through some one barrier of con- 
solidated custom. 
Neither is dissociation peculiar to abnormal states. 
Although the mind is an organic whole, and although 
in the healthy state relations of unity exist between 
the dispositions left by past experiences and the 
present content, it is none the less true that unless 
within this dominating unity the total mental system 
admitted of cleavage in every direction, split itself up 
vertically and longitudinally, refused the right of way 
between adjoining sub-systems, and left important groups 
to function of themselves, ready to come into the central 
conscious life whenever their presence is needed, the 
conduct of thought would be impossible. At the very 
beginning of mental life dissociation comes into play, 
when through selective attention ideas are detached 
from the background of contiguous association and 
enter into fresh combinations under the direction of a 
guiding idea. Forgetfulness, which to most people is a 
habit to be combated, is a kind of dissociation, and is 
essential if memory is to perform its function. Unless 
the great mass of percepts and ideas that find their way 
into the mind sank rapidly below the margin of con- 
sciousness, the stage would become too crowded. 
The fundamental division of mind into consciousness 
and subconsciousness, and the varying degrees of relation- 
ship in which subconscious ideas stand to consciousness 
and colour the ideas in it, are instances of the natural 
tendency of the mind to manifoldness. Education to 
a great extent consists in organising in the mind large 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
26 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
tracts that can function independently and can switch 
themselves off from the influence of conscious or sub- 
conscious processes. Each fresh interest that is 
organised represents a relatively detached system, 
each fresh subject that is taught is coextensive with a 
grouping of ideas to which the learner is made to con- 
fine his attention to the exclusion of all others. A 
language when acquired is an admirable example of a 
closely related group within which association will be 
strictly confined. If I have switched on my system of 
ideas for German and am hunting for a suitable word to 
complete a sentence, my subconsciousness is too well 
trained to bring me up a French word or a Greek word. 
Even if I cannot find the word, and have nothing in con- 
sciousness but the blank of interrogation, words from 
other languages are inhibited, or if by chance they 
present themselves, are immediately rejected as being 
illegitimate intruders, 
Many men bring to the front a totally different 
system of ideas, and with it different manners and 
sympathies, according as they are dealing with inferiors, 
equals, or superiors. I stay in one house where the 
interests of my friends are purely philosophical, and go 
on to another in which golf or horse-racing is the pre- 
vailing influence. Relative dissociation takes place in 
each case and unsuitable interests are repressed. If a 
versatile man, I may combine the life of letters with that 
of a practical farmer, but the two systems fall sharply 
apart, and may have the smallest possible influence on 
one another. 
More striking is the process when I will to dissociate 
my ideas. The determination to put a phase of mind 
resolutely on one side is illustrated when I withdraw my   
-P-A-G-E-41
  SUGGESTION IN THE WAKING STATE 27 
attention from an interesting novel and concentrate my- 
self on a distasteful task, or when a business man whose 
affairs are in a shaky condition, and who needs for their 
conduct all the strength and coolness that he can 
muster, resolves to leave his worries behind him 
when he quits his office and to keep his home life and 
interests entirely separate, in order that he may preserve 
his health and his sanity. In the beginning such a pro- 
cess of abstraction needs a considerable effort; in the 
long run it may become second nature. 
It is evident, therefore, that the relative independence 
of great sections of mind is not only not unusual, but is 
essential to mental development. If we take the last of 
the processes which stand out as peculiar in hypnosis, 
namely, post-hypnotic suggestion, we shall find that this, 
too, has its analogue in ordinary life. Its essential 
nature consists in this, that an idea introduced into the 
mind when dominated by a certain set of ideas or a 
certain aim, comes into operation later after a period 
during which the original set of ideas has passed into 
obliviscence. This is, however, one of the commonest 
features of the waking state. Our minds are full of 
latent ideas which from time to time surprise us by 
coming to the front and taking up a commanding 
position. We have probably forgotten when or how 
we first experienced or originated them, though we may 
have our suspicions, but of their presence and their 
power there is no doubt. Many people can train them- 
selves to wake up at a certain hour, or can make up 
their minds to perform some action in a week’s time. 
The idea is then dismissed from the mind; but if the 
subconsciousness has been properly trained, the sleeper 
will awake and the action will be performed, although 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
28 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
neither the thought of waking nor the idea of performing 
the action may have been in the mind from the moment 
that the resolution was taken and then put on one side 
to make room for sleep or for other ideas. 
In the waking state, then, we find the very same 
phenomena that are so noticeable in the state of 
hypnosis. Ideas tend to produce vaso-motor changes 
or to actualise themselves as sensations or perceptions, 
there is a strong tendency to imitate movements and to 
accept ideas that are in the air, the dissociation of 
psychical states seems to be an essential for sound 
mental processes, and, finally, when once it has been 
introduced into a mental system, an idea tends to persist 
and to overflow into action or belief after a considerable 
period of inertness. 
The difference between the two states is largely one 
of degree. Psychic processes are in their origin sensori- 
motor or ideo-motor ; that is to say, in the primitive mind 
a feeling or an idea tends to express itself in action at 
once. Feelings of pleasure and pain express themselves 
in motion towards and motion from the object which 
gives rise to them. For the dog the idea of rat-which- 
can-be-pursued resolves itself immediately into the 
action of pursuit; for the small child the perception of 
his mother whom he has not seen for a few hours is 
enough to make him run towards her; for the boy the 
notion of a game of cricket translates itself into “cutting” 
a school hour. At a higher stage of development 
this original tendency of the feeling or idea may be 
obstructed. The moth flies into the candle automatic- 
ally, while the man may inhibit the idea-impulse 
that he should enter the public-house ; the dog rushes 
after the rat, while the man checks his tendency to strike 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  SUGGESTION IN THE WAKING STATE 29 
his enemy or to run after his friend. The older boy 
would like to cut a school hour and play cricket, but the 
tendency of the idea to develop is blocked by other 
more powerful ideas and impulses. At the extreme end 
of the scale the impotence of the idea as an initiator 
of movement becomes clearly marked and is well illus- 
trated by the man who lies in bed in the morning and 
resolves to get up. He may place the idea in the focus 
of consciousness, and attempt to strengthen it by heaping 
round it ideas of the advantages to be derived from 
early rising, but none the less may remain in bed for 
another hour. The abnormal state of aboulia shows 
how complete may be the separation between the idea 
and the movement with which it is naturally connected. 
In this condition a man may be unable to perform any 
of the actions which he has it in his mind to do, 
although he may cognise them and will them. 
In fact, the energy of any idea is determined less by 
its intrinsic nature than by its relative strength as 
compared with the ideas which impinge upon it ; indeed, 
apart from the original tendency of an idea to be 
accepted or to be realised, which may be looked on 
as its energy, it is probably misleading to talk of one 
idea as having more force than another. Its actual 
influence on the psychic complex will depend entirely 
on circumstances. 
A certain portion of the mental content is attended to 
and becomes the idea which fills the focus of conscious- 
ness. ‘Suppose it to be the idea of giving the whole of 
one’s property for charitable purposes. As an idea this 
possesses the constant energy of all ideas in the tendency 
to realise itself. But the field is not clear for it. It is 
obstructed (a) by the inherited impulses and tendencies 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  30 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
of self-protection, which incline one to make certain 
that one’s own welfare is assured; (4) by the impulses 
arising from habit, which look askance at the tendency 
to give more than the small portion of income which is 
usually assigned to charity ; (c) by’a number of family 
prudential ideas, such as the duties of educating one’s 
children or of assisting poor relatives ; (d) by the fear 
that indiscriminate charity may do harm. As a result 
the incipient tendency to the renunciation of worldly 
goods is strangled at birth, and its only contribution 
towards the mental system in which it occurs is that of 
initiating a train of association. On the other hand (a) 
I may be the possessor of professional skill which 
enables me to earn my livelihood with ease, and may 
therefore be in no fear of indigence; (6) I may have 
inherited the fortune suddenly, and therefore may have 
no established habits of dealing with money on a large 
scale ; (c) I may dislike my children and my relatives ; (d) 
I may be ignorant of the economics of social life. In 
this case the idea will be operative, and yet it is ex 
hypothest the same idea as in the former case ; the same 
impulse to give combined with the same conception 
of suffering, and the same anticipation of the pleasure 
to be derived from munificence to others. Stated 
schematically, an idea A introduced into a mental system 
has a tendency by association to call up other ideas and 
impulses B, C, D, which may be (1) contrariant, critical, 
and inhibitory ; (2) sympathetic and furthering. This is 
its total association value, and it works equally in all 
directions; it calls up ideas that are friendly to it 
and also ideas that are hostile. This enumeration does 
not exhaust its latent powers. It possesses also a 
suggestive energy which. may be converted into
-P-A-G-E-45
  
SUGGESTION IN THE WAKING STATE 31 
suggestive force, and which overcomes or avoids the 
resistance offered to it so that action results. 
These two qualities of an idea must be clearly 
distinguished. The associative tendency is not neces- 
sarily a tendency to action or belief. I may mass 
together a number of ideas that deal with a certain line 
of conduct, but the result may be no more than a clear 
understanding of the positions; for increased insight 
by no means leads to action if there is in existence 
a system of opposed ideas and impulses, and such a 
system is often called into existence in proportion to 
the size of the favouring system; while, on the other 
hand, an idea in so far as it is suggestive tends to realise 
itself quite apart from insight or understanding. If the 
resulting train of association is abnormal so that adverse 
ideas and impulses seem to be non-existent, this is due 
to the suggestive force of the idea, and an idea is 
suggestive in so far as the train of association which it 
initiates is partial, or, in other words, in so far as it 
realises itself notwithstanding the existence within the 
total mental system of possible inhibitory ideas. 
In a fully developed mind, therefore, the suggestive 
force of an idea or idea complex is conditioned by a 
tendency to dissociation or compartment working, and 
this, as we have seen, is an essential feature of healthy 
mental life. It is, however, necessary to draw a sharp 
distinction between the dissociation of the hypnotic 
state and that of the waking active life. The waking 
life of the mind, in so far as it is efficient, is a continual 
struggle. My mental existence, my personality as a 
conscious being, consists of a complex of aims or ends 
on the attainment of which my efforts are concentrated. 
In the adolescent these aims are relatively few and 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
    32 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
simple ; in the adult they are numerous and form a kind 
of hierarchy. Dominating my entire life of thought and 
impulse is some far distant goal: it may be the desire 
to attain religious peace of mind, or to succeed as a 
social reformer or as a constructive thinker ; or it may 
be merely the wish to succeed in a profession or to 
amass a large fortune. Ranked beneath this final aim 
are a number of subsidiary ends. As a means towards 
success in professional life it may be necessary for me 
first to cultivate my mental powers and my faculty of 
self-control, then to acquire a body of professional know- 
ledge, and then to develop whatever power I may 
possess of getting on with my fellow-men, and of 
imposing my wishes upon them. The pursuit of each 
of these aims is relatively distinct. When a doctor is 
learning anatomy or physic, he is not at the same time 
wondering if his bedside manner will be good enough to 
contribute towards his success; when a merchant is 
trying to organise a fresh market for his goods, he is 
not with the same system of ideas working out a scheme 
for raising more capital. But though the aims may be 
thus relatively distinct, they are all subordinated to one 
final goal; the unity of the mind is paramount. The 
more the mind is pervaded by the desire to attain the 
final end, the more resolutely it will apply itself to each 
single end in turn to the exclusion of others, and the 
less it will allow itself to be called away from the 
business in hand by the other matters that are of equal 
importance for the fulfilment of the whole train of 
conation. The fully completed system will in respect 
of its discrete parts resemble a large business organisa- 
tion, in which each department has its own function and 
concentrates its whole energy upon it, while all work
-P-A-G-E-47
SUGGESTION IN THE WAKING STATE 33 
steadily towards a common goal. The more efficient 
the mind, the more complete is the dissociation of its 
parts, while at the same time the firmer are the bonds 
by which relations of unity knit it together. For its 
wholesome growth each fresh stage in organisation, 
each tendency to split up the total complex, must be 
accompanied by an equally strong tendency to unifica- 
tion. The maximum of discreteness must coexist with 
the maximum of homogeneity. 
It is true that in certain cases it may seem question- 
able if the unity of the mind is furthered by discreteness, 
' In the instance given above of the merchant who for 
the sake of his health and peace of mind has to put on 
one side all his business worries when he leaves his 
office, and to cultivate a different set of interests in his 
home, there appears to be certain loss of power; and in 
one sense this is true. It is impossible not to believe 
that his efficiency would be greater if his business were 
in a sound condition, and if his waking thoughts could 
always, without any danger to mental health, be con- 
cerned with its maintenance and development. But the 
value of dissociation is relative. In this instance the 
cleavage of mental life is essential, and is certainly 
dominated by relations of unity. To say that a mental 
system that is not under the necessity of thus dividing 
itself is more efficient, such a system as was to be 
found in John Wesley, whose entire energies, with 
the exception of the four hours’ sleep that he allowed 
himself nightly, were concentrated on one purpose, is 
merely to say that some minds are situated more suitably 
than others for the development of their maximum force. 
Mind must develop as circumstances permit, and what 
is the best course for one mind may be only second best 
3
-P-A-G-E-48
    34 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
for another. In all mental development that persists 
it will be found that dissociation, except in so far as 
it is necessary for the complete rest of one mental 
system that another system with relatively distinct aims 
should occasionally take its place, brings with it an 
increased consolidation of aims and a more intense unity 
of consciousness, 
We have seen that suggestibility is impossible with- 
out dissociation, and that dissociation is of two kinds— 
the abnormal dissociation that we find in the hypnotic 
state, and the more normal type that accompanies self- 
control. Which of these two kinds is to be the con- 
ditioning influence of suggestion in the waking state 
must be discussed later.
-P-A-G-E-49
  CHAPTER III 
EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF SUGGESTION IN THE 
WAKING STATE 
A NUMBER of observations have been made both in 
schools and in laboratories on suggestion in the waking 
state, and a consideration of these will throw light on 
its true nature. Of especial interest are some experi- 
ments conducted by M. Binet in Parisian schools,! 
1. The headmaster of the school, following M. Binet’s 
instructions, announced to a class that he was going to 
make an experiment on their memory of the length of 
lines. A line 5 centimetres long ruled on white card- 
board was shown to each boy, who after looking at it 
had to draw it as accurately as he could on a sheet of 
paper. The class were then informed that they would 
be asked to draw another line, a little onger than the first, 
and were accordingly given a second line to copy. In 
reality, however, it was shorter, being only 4 centimetres 
in length. 
Only 9 of the 86 children experimented upon resisted 
the suggestion, and believed their eyes and their 
memories rather than the statement made by their 
master ; the remainder all made the second line larger 
than the first. 
1 A, Binet, La Suggestibilité, 1900. 
35 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
   36 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
2. In this experiment, as in the first, the boys were 
asked to draw lines from memory on squared paper, 
but the suggestion instead of being given by word of 
mouth was given by the lines themselves. The boys, as 
before, were told that the object of the experiment was to 
test their memories. “We are going to make an 
experiment on the accuracy of your eye. We are going 
to see if you are able to reproduce the length of a line. 
I shall show you a line which is, say, 5 centimetres long, 
and you will reproduce it from memory. We shall thus 
see if your eye is accurate. Some people are so inac- 
curate that when they reproduce a line which is 5 centi- 
metres long they make it 10 centimetres; that is a 
great error. Others make it only 2 centimetres long. 
You must try to be as accurate as you can.” 
After this exhortation the boys were shown 12 lines 
in succession. These lines, with the exception of 4, 
increased in arithmetical progression thus :— 
Order of Lines. Length. Order of Lines. Length. 
I 12 mm, 7 72mm. 
2 24 mm. 8 72 mm, 
3 36 mm. 9 84 mm, 
4 48 mm. 10 84 mm. 
5 60 mm. II 96 mm. 
6 60 mm, 12 96 mm. 
It will be seen that numbers 6, 8, 10, and 12 were 
traps laid for the unwary boy, to see if the directing idea 
of uniform increase given by numbers 1 to 5 of the 
series was sufficient to counterbalance his perception of 
the line presented. 
Of 45 boys who were the subjects of this experiment 
none avoided all four traps; 3 succeeded in avoiding 
two, and 7 others avoided one, The directing idea of
-P-A-G-E-51
  
EXPERIMENTAL STUDY $7 
uniformly increasing length thus affected 35 boys, or 
77.7 per cent of the total number. 
This experiment was repeated in a slightly different 
manner. The following series of 36 lines was presented 
to the boys :— 
Order of Lines, Length. 
1 12 mm, 
2 24 mm, 
3 36 mm, 
4 48 mm. 
5-36 60 mm. 
Of 42 boys subjected to this experiment, only 2 
reached their maximum length by the 7th line, 13 
reached their maximum between the 7th and 17th, 13 
between the 20th and 26th, 10 between the 28th and 
34th, while 9 manfully went on making their lines 
longer up to the last line shown them. (Not all were 
shown the total number of 36 lines.) Thus the directing 
idea given by the first five lines seems to have been 
effective, and in the case of 9 boys to have been 
absolute. 
After the completion of the experiment, the boys 
were asked a number of questions, of which the fol- 
lowing will serve as illustrations :— 
INTERROGATION OF JEAN GouGé 
. Are you satisfied with the lines you have drawn ? 
Yes, sir. 
. Do you think you have made no mistakes ? 
No, I have made some. 
What kind of mistakes ? 
My lines are not of the same length as those you 
showed me. AOROKO 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  38 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
What mistakes have you made? 
My lines are longer. 
How much? 
I don’t know. 
. If I were to tell you that you might correct them, what 
peace would you make? 
A. I don’t know. As I looked at them I said, ‘‘ They are a 
little longer than those shown me.” 
Q. Show me how far you would go in correcting. 
A, About so far. (He shortens the lines.) 
Q. Why did you make them too long if you knew that you 
were doing so? 
A. I don’t know. SAOAD 
INTERROGATION OF DIEM 
Q. Did you see your mistake when you were drawing the 
lines or after you had finished them ? 
A. I saw it while drawing them; I said to myself, “I have 
made them too long.” 
Q. Why did you go on making them too long? 
A. Because I was afraid you would make me begin all over 
again. 
Most of the boys when asked stated that they knew 
that the lines were too long, and M. Binet suggests! 
that they were half aware of the illusion that the 
suggestion produced. Two-thirds of the boys when 
asked why they continued to make the lines too long, 
answered that they did not know. The remainder gave 
some reason which in most cases was obviously unreal. 
M. Binet points out? that the questions put to the boy 
rouse him out of a state of mind which is analogous to 
hypnotic sleep, and awake the critical sense which has 
been drowsing. It is, at any rate, striking that the 
1 Op. cit. p. 142. 2 Op. cit. p. 143.
-P-A-G-E-53
  EXPERIMENTAL STUDY 390 
attempt to give some reason, even though a foolish one, 
for what he has done resembles the tendency of the 
subject of post-hypnotic suggestion to account for and 
justify his action. 
Of mistakes produced by a guiding idea of this kind, 
M. Binet says: “As the error arises in the subject 
himself, and is the result of an auto-suggestion, the 
responsibility rests with him alone; the experimenter 
does not contribute towards it.”? 
3. The subjects, 23 in number, aged seven to fourteen, 
were shown the following series of coloured wools, each 
placed on a white card :—(1) Blue, (2) greyish blue, (3) 
greenish blue, (4) bluish green, (5) green, (6) yellowish 
green, (7) moss green, (8) olive green, (9) yellow. 
Each boy separately was shown the colours in order, 
and was told that he was to be examined to see if he knew 
the names of the colours; that he was to look at each 
colour, to say its name aloud, and then to write it on 
the paper placed before him. As a rule, the subject 
when shown the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th colours called them 
green, upon which the experimenter said, “No, blue.” 
The great majority took up the suggestion at once and 
wrote “blue” on their papers. The attitude of the children 
when the suggestion was given is worth considering. 
Three types of attitude can be distinguished. (1) The 
boy takes it calmly and passively, expresses no surprise, 
and writes what is suggested to him. (2) The boy is 
perplexed by the statement, grows red, and looks at the 
experimenter with astonishment, frowning to conceal 
his embarrassment. (3) The boy’s attitude is one of 
revolt, and he expresses his scepticism in familiar 
language, saying, “Oh, that’s what you call blue is it?”

4. Eighteen lines, each 60 mm. in length, were shown 
in succession to 25 boys. The boys had to mark off on 
squared paper a certain distance from a vertical line 
equal to the line shown them. 
The first line is shown in silence. With the second 
the suggestion is made, “ Here is one which is longer” ; 
with the third, “Here is one which is shorter,” and so 
on alternately. 
Only 9 boys resisted the suggestion more than four 
times, 3 resisted only once, while 8 succumbed to all 
the suggestions. 
The same experiment was made on 10 boys in an 
Ecole Primaire Supérieure. 
Only 2 made as many as ten resistances, 1 made 
three, 3 made one, and 4 made none. 
Here is the interrogation of a boy who made three 
resistances :— 
What do you think of the lines? 
I think they are all about equal. 
When did you think this? 
When the eighth line was shown. 
. What made you think this? 
. When you said “A little longer,” the line was at the

Here it is to be noted that the subject continued to 
follow the suggestion even after the eighth line, when, 
according to his own statement, he realised that the 
lines were equal, and the reasons alleged in his last 
answer were wholly incorrect. 
5. The group of objects given in Fig. 1 was shown to

24 boys for ten seconds. They were first asked to 
enumerate the objects in the picture.

each object was omitted :—

The portrait and the picture attracted attention 
because of their size. The stamp is badly placed as it 
is in the right-hand top corner, and thus neither in the 
place where one begins nor where one ends when read- 
ing. The extent to which the ticket is forgotten is not 
easy to explain. It may be because the picture at the 
other side attracted attention away from it; but in that 
case why was the sou better remembered ? 
Detailed questions were then asked about each of the 
objects in the group. Those on the button may be 
taken as typical.

What is its colour? 
. Is its colour simple or mixed with another colour ? 
. Of what substance is the button made?

25 subjects. Question 7 gave rise to many mistakes. 
21 out of 25 subjects maintained that the button was 
attached by thread or fastened bya pin. Their answers 
were most precise, and when asked the colour of the 
threads, each of them stated that they were white, or 
black, or blue. When asked point-blank if they had 
seen the threads, 5 maintained that they had.

Another group of boys was then asked to write out 
from memory a description of the same objects shown in 
the same way. On this occasion very few of the incorrect 
details were given. No boy, for example, said that the 
button was fastened by threads. It is evident, therefore, 
that these detailed questions acted as suggestions. In 
part the boy when asked a question about some detail 
that he did not remember used his imagination in his

anxiety to oblige; in part the nature of the question 
actually suggested the answer to be given. The sugges- 
tive force of such questions varies very much according 
to the manner in which they are put. M. Binet tried 
three further experiments with three different sets of 
boys, to each of whom a special set of questions was 
given. We reproduce the questions relating to the button. 
Ist set:— 
1. How is the button fastened to the cardboard ? 
2. Is it broken, or is it whole? Draw it. 
2nd set :— 
1. Is not the button fastened on to the cardboard with 
thread ? 
2. Is it not broken? Draw it.

1. There are four holes. What is the colour of the thread 
which passes through these holes and which fixes 
the button to the cardboard ? 
2. Draw the button, showing the place where it is broken. 
The results of these three sets of questions were as 
follows :—

The number of specific errors here rises strongly as the 
questions are put in a more suggestive manner. 
We have given these experiments at some length, 
because, besides illustrating the working of suggestion in 
the waking state, they give an opportunity of again con- 
sidering the exact nature of the suggestive process. In 
examples I, 3, 4, and 5, the suggestions were given from 
outside, and by the experimenter ; in 2 it was the result 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
of a perception on the part of the subject uninfluenced by 
the experimenter. M. Binet classes all five experiments 
under the heading “suggestion,” but there is a radical 
difference between 2 and the others. If every complex 
of ideas that is produced by a series of experiences, and 
which subsequently takes up a commanding position in 
the mind, is to be called “suggestive,” every general 
state of the waking mind, every apperception, every 
prejudice will be a suggestion, and the term ceases to 
have any useful meaning. Or, if we consider the sug- 
gestive element as residing in the peculiar arrangement 
and presentation of lines made by the experimenter, 
we must then class as suggestions all the peculiar 
modifications of one perceptual element by another 
that are commonly called illusions. In that case, 
when in the well-known illusive arrangement given 
in Fig. 2, two equal lines appear to differ in length, 
<4<_—__>

After L. Witmer (Analytical Psychology, Ginn and Co.). 
or when a shade of grey varies considerably according 
to the background on which it is placed, the length of 
line and the colour actually perceived are “ suggested” to 
me ; or when water at 40° Fahr. feels cold after boiling 
water and warm after freezing water; or when tea with 
milk in it tastes sweet after an acid and bitter after a 
solution of sugar, all these are suggestions. Indeed,
-P-A-G-E-59
  EXPERIMENTAL STUDY 45 
every complex perception which is a composite of percepts 
and sensations that modify one another, must come under 
this heading, and the term is thus wholly discredited. 
Nor does it improve matters to say with M. Binet, 
“The directing ideas that we have previously described 
are the work of the subject, and constitute auto-sugges- 
tions.” In this sense every state of mind influenced by 
previous experiences is an “auto-suggestion,” a word 
which we shall have to define more strictly later on. 
M. Binet analyses the situation as follows :'—“I take 
the opportunity of describing as well as I can the 
psychology of these very complex experiments on 
suggestion produced by a guiding idea. In these experi- 
ments we find a conflict between two different tendencies : 
(1) The tendency to perceive the equality of lines; (2) 
The tendency to consider them as forming a series of 
increasing lengths. It is this second tendency that con- 
stitutes the guiding idea, and the illusion of the experi- 
ments is produced by the perception of the first five lines 
which really are a series of increasing lines. The subject, 
if he attends, cannot fail to notice this order, and prob- 
ably notes it in his subconscious language; in any case 
he sees it materially realised before his eyes by the posi- 
tion of the points which he marks on the paper. This 
guiding idea has made a strong impression on him, and 
he allows himself to consider that the order of increase 
must hold good for the whole series of lines. The 
supposition would appear absurd if stated as a formal 
judgment, as, indeed, would a number of other supposi- 
tions which guide our lives, and which are founded on 
arguments whose value is small. . . . The effect of this 
guiding idea is to prevent the exact perception of the lines. 
1 Op. cit. p. 199.
-P-A-G-E-60
  46 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
. . . Why does this idea . . . in the beginning a purely 
intellectual one, possess this force of obsession? Through 
inertia. If the subject enters the path shown by the 
guiding idea, it is because it is the line of least effort ; it 
is easier to allow one’s estimation of the length of lines 
to increase uniformly than to make a careful estimate 
of each line on its own merits. . . . Without entering 
into details, it seems to me reasonable to admit that the 
suggestion which influences the subject cannot fulfil itself 
except through the intermediary of phenomena of the 
unconscious or rather of mental disaggregation. The 
subject is ignorant of the idea that directs him, he does 
not know why he submits to it, although he finds it 
incorrect, and he invents reasons by which he explains 
his conduct to himself.” 
Thus the main characteristics, according to M. Binet, 
are three :— 
1. The induction that lies at the basis of the guiding 
idea would seem absurd if stated in logical form. 
2. The subject is unaware of the real basis, and 
invents false reasons. 
3. The obsessing force is due to inertia. 
No one of these is in any way more characteristic of 
suggestion than of any of the states of mind that guide 
our ordinary conduct. (1) The basis of few of our guid- 
ing ideas will bear much logical analysis. (2) Asa rule 
we are ignorant, and refuse to be other than ignorant of 
the real motives of our conduct, and as habitually, we 
invent motives that suit our self-esteem. (3) If, because 
I have been swindled by one solicitor, I henceforth per- 
ceive all solicitors as swindlers ; or if, because my experi- 
ence as a doctor has frequently brought me into contact 
with one form of disease, I diagnose all my patients as
-P-A-G-E-61
  EXPERIMENTAL STUDY 47 
suffering from the same malady, I am taking the line of 
least resistance ; the state of my mind is one of “inertia.” 
This phenomenon is as common in mental life as it is 
deplorable, and to call it auto-suggestion perverts the 
meaning of a useful word, and throws no further light 
upon the situation. The real problem of suggestion is 
rather this: If when the state of mind is neutral, or if 
when the guiding idea derived from past experience leads 
in a certain direction, a fresh idea leads me in a direction 
that apparently is not indicated by the neutral complex 
or is in actual opposition to the guiding idea, how is this 
to be explained, and how are such suggestive ideas to be 
introduced ? 
Some light is thrown on the problem by the series of 
interesting experiments made by Dr. Boris Sidis on 
suggestion in the normal or waking state He dis- 
tinguishes in the hypnotic state between direct and 
indirect suggestion. In direct suggestion the experi- 
menter gives his orders as directly and definitely as 
possible. But this is only one method. “Suggestions 
may also be given in quite a different way. Instead of 
openly telling the subject what he should do, the experi- 
menter produces some object, or makes a movement, or a 
gesture which in their own silent fashion tell the subject 
what to do. To illustrate it by a few examples so as to 
make my meaning clearer. I stretch out the hand of 
the hypnotic subject and make it rigid, and while doing 
this I press his arm with an iron rod. In the next 
séance, as soon as the iron rod touches the arm he 
becomes rigid. I tell the subject to spell the word 
‘Napoleon,’ and when he comes to ‘p’ I stretch out my 
hand and make it stiff; the subject begins to stammer, 
1 Dr. Boris Sidis, The Psychology of Suggestion, New York, 1898,
-P-A-G-E-62
  48 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
the muscles of his lips spasmodically contract and stiffen.” 
This kind of suggestion, in which only a hint is given, is 
indirect suggestion. 
Dr. Sidis draws a further distinction between imme- 
diate and mediate suggestion. When a person does or 
thinks exactly what is suggested to him, this is immediate 
suggestion ; when he does something slightly different, 
for example, if he is told that on awakening he will see 
a tiger, but actually maintains that he sees a large cat, 
this is mediate suggestion. 
Before proceeding to discuss the conditions of these 
several kinds of suggestion, Sidis gives some experiments 
designed to prove that man is suggestible. These 
experiments aimed at bringing out the relative values 
for suggestion of Repetition, Frequency, Coexistence, 
and Last Impression. 
A series of nine letters was shown, one at a time, 
through a slit on a white screen. Each slip was 
shown for three seconds. At the end of the series the 
subject had to write down immediately the letter that 
first came into his mind. 
The methods used and the effects of the various 
arrangements were as follows :— 
1. Repetition—In the middle of the series a letter was 
shown three times in succession, thus: 
BEKMMMNOP. In 53 out of 300 trials the subject 
wrote down the letter suggested. 17.6 per cent. 
2. Frequency.—A letter was shown three times in the series 
with interruption, thus: 
BKEKMKCRD. In 128 out of 300 trials the subject 
wrote down the letter suggested. 42 per cent.

The experiments are interesting, and it is worth 
while to ask what they really prove. Mr. Sidis says: 
“These experiments unquestionably prove the reality 
of normal suggestibility; they prove the presence of 
suggestibility in the average normal individual.” But 
do they really prove anything of the sort? They show 
what combination of factors best leaves an idea in the 
mind; but the idea need not be a suggestive idea. In 
this case the idea of the letter that fills consciousness 
is not believedin any sense of the word. Neither is it 
really acted upon. The subject wrote down the letter 
4
-P-A-G-E-64
  50 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
that was uppermost in his mind because he had been 
asked to do so, and not because of il suggestive force 
of the letter. If of two perfectly neutral courses of 
action, we will say those of ordering poached eggs or 
boiled eggs for breakfast, I promise to take whichever 
happens first to come into my mind at a certain moment, 
the idea of conduct involved is not suggestive. My 
action is conditioned by my promise; the presence only 
of one idea instead of another is conditioned by the 
previous history of the idea in my mind. 
That frequency and last impression far more than 
other factors insure the presence of an idea in con- 
sciousness is a valuable piece of knowledge, and one 
which can be made use of in the processes that lead 
up to suggestion ; but the only point in connexion with 
suggestion that is directly illustrated by these experi- 
ments is the existence of contrariant ideas. In the case 
of both repetition and coexistence the subject evidently 
detects the arrangement that is intended to impress him, 
and unconsciously deciding that he'll have none of it, 
clears his mind of the idea at once. 
Dr. Sidis performed a further series of experiments on 
the elements that condition, or, as he would put it, that 
suggest, choice. Six squares (30 x 30 mm.) were placed 
on a white background. This with the squares upon 
it was again covered by a sheet of black cardboard. 
The subject was told to fix his attention on the black 
covering for five seconds. At the end of this period 
the black cover was removed and the subject had 
immediately to take one of the coloured squares, which- 
ever he liked. 
The following six factors in the suggestion of choice 
were studied ;— 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  EXPERIMENTAL STUDY 5I 
1. Abnormal Position—One of the coloured squares was 
placed in an abnormal position. 
2. Coloured Cover.—Instead of the usual black cover a 
coloured cover was used, the colour being that of one of the 
squares concealed. 
3. Strange Shape.—One of the coloured squares was here of 
peculiar shape. 
4. Colour verbally suggested—Before the experiment one of 
the coloured squares was shown to the subject, who had to 
give it its precise name. If he did not succeed he was told 
the name of the colour. The square was then replaced and 
the experiment began. 
5. Place verbally suggested.—As the cover was being removed 
the place of one of the coloured squares was suggested by 
calling out a number, as, for instance, “three,” meaning the 
third place from the left hand. 
6. Environment.—One of the six coloured squares was 
placed on a larger square of differently coloured paper. 
If the subject selected the square that was forced upon 
him in one of these ways, this was called, according to 
Dr. Sidis’s terminology, “immediate suggestion.” If he 
chose the square on either side of the one intended this 
was considered to come under the heading “mediate 
suggestion.” 
After subtracting the number of choices due merely 
to chance, and combining the mediate and the immediate 
suggestions, the number of times that the forced square 
was selected is given in the following table :—

  52 “SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
It is noticeable here that the first four arrangements 
are much more effective than the last two, and it is 
at once evident that the former represent indirect 
suggestions and the latter direct suggestions ; while of 
the latter the last is far more direct than the preceding 
one. It looks, therefore, from these observations as if in 
the normal or waking state direct suggestion was far 
less effective than indirect suggestion. 
Dr. Sidis points out that in the previous study with 
letters the same truth is indicated, since the factors of 
frequency and last impression that head the list are far 
more indirect than those of repetition and coexistence, 
and from these experiments he derives what he calls the 
law of normal suggestibility:— Normal suggestibility 
varies as indirect suggestion and inversely as direct 
suggestion. 
We have described these observations at some length 
on account of their intrinsic interest. To the second 
group, however, the same criticism applies as to the 
first. We have throughout used the word “suggestion” 
because it is the term chosen by Dr. Sidis, but it is 
doubtful if the “lead” here given should be called sug- 
gestion except in the case of the last two arrangements. 
The selecting of the card was carried out not because 
of the influence of the suggested idea, but because the 
subject knew that he was expected to choose one, and 
voluntarily agreed to do so. Here, again, the subject 
matter of choice being neutral, or indifferent to the 
subject’s interests, the idea that possessed the energy 
given by contrast naturally determined the direction 
taken. But when we come to place verbally suggested 
we have a real suggestion, and in the waking state it 
is remarkable for its inefficiency. The experiment 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  EXPERIMENTAL STUDY 53 
really does show that direct suggestions which are 
obvious and which, therefore, arouse contrariant ideas 
are useless in the waking state, but Dr. Sidis fails to 
bring out the truth that the indirect suggestions given 
in this way are effective, not because of any positive 
suggestive quality that they may possess (though they 
might, of course, be given in such a way as to possess 
positive qualities), but solely because they satisfy the 
conditions of an energetic idea, and avoid the arousing 
of contrariant ideas. The legitimate inference from the 
experiments is that direct suggestion which arouses 
contrariant ideas is the very worst form of suggestion 
in the waking state, unless the presentation arouses so 
much emotion that the contrariant ideas are inhibited 
and rendered inoperative. 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  CHAPTER IV 
OPERATIONS PRELIMINARY TO SUGGESTION 
A SUGGESTIVE idea is one which exercises a disintegrat- 
ing influence on the mind in such a way that critical 
and inhibitory ideas are rendered ineffective. It differs 
from a guiding idea derived from experience in that it 
has the power of determining the mind in a direction 
which is not the natural resolution of the ideas in 
consciousness, or of the dispositions which immediately 
condition these conscious ideas, The non-suggestive 
idea inhibits other ideas only in the sense that it ousts 
them from consciousness in order that for the time 
being the process of conation that is to the fore may be 
furthered, and initiates an associative system in which 
every direction of resolution is possible, which is there- 
fore critical and which leads to knowledge. The 
suggestive idea, on the other hand, while it need not 
be independent of knowledge, leads straight to action 
or belief. Such ideas may be introduced from without 
by a person or a situation, and may at once exert their 
influence, or they may lie latent for a considerable 
period. In the latter case they will be brought to the 
front by the ordinary processes of association, and will 
54
-P-A-G-E-69
PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS 55 
then exercise their peculiar inhibitory qualities; here 
we have the phenomenon of auto-suggestion.1 
Before we consider the manner in which suggestive 
ideas should be introduced, if their peculiar properties 
are to be fully developed, some preliminaries claim our 
attention. It is, in the first place, desirable that 
such ideas, in addition to their special power of sug- 
gestion, should possess at least the qualities that 
condition the energy of ordinary non-suggestive ideas. 
These qualities, often confused with those which give 
a suggestive idea its peculiar significance for mental 
life, must be clearly distinguished from them. They 
give an idea its liveliness, they make it the starting- 
point of trains of association, and they insure the 
presence of a system of ideas that is easily affected by a 
suggestive idea when it makes its appearance. They 
can, therefore, never be neglected by the teacher who 
wishes to be suggestive, and this chapter will be devoted 
to considering them as the preliminaries of suggestion. 
The liveliness and the energy of an idea, the extent 
to which it captures the attention and influences the rest 
of the mental content, depends upon several well- 
marked conditions. 
1. It must be massive. A massive idea is one which 
is produced by the perception of a large object, as, for 
example, by the sight of a mountain or of a large river, 
or by the sound of thunder or of a large orchestra. Or 
it may be produced by the repetition of a mental 
experience over a long period of time. Ideas of this 
1 The term ‘‘ auto-suggestion”’ is here employed because it is the one in 
common use. It is, however, misleading. The idea is really suggested from 
without, and appears to be ‘‘self-suggested " only to the person in whose mind 
ithas been latent. ‘‘ Pseudo-auto-suggestion"’ would be a more correct, though 
impossibly cumbrous term. 
   
-P-A-G-E-70
  56 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
kind have a quality peculiar to themselves and take 
possession of the mind with great force, even though 
they may have no bearing upon its content or aims. 
They may, of course, be neglected. I may, for instance, 
refuse to listen to the thunder or the orchestra, and may 
concentrate my mind on something else. But if the 
direction of attention is neutral, massiveness is an 
important factor. 
If subjects are introduced to the mind in minute 
snippets, if the dose is made homeeopathically small, this 
quality is not to be found, and no matter how good the 
presentation may be, the feeling tone of the ideas will 
never be that of real experience. If we analyse any 
portion of our mental content, we shall find that this 
tone of massiveness attaches to the subjects that we have 
read over and over again because we liked them, that 
we have read slowly, lingering over episodes or details 
that pleased us because there was no need to hurry ; we 
seem to have lived through the ideas rather than to have 
acquired them on stated occasions, and as a result they 
are heirlooms rather than purchases, old friends rather 
than travelling acquaintances. The lessons for the 
teacher are those of leisure and quantity. It may seem 
like irony to talk of leisure in these days of examina- 
tions and inspections ; but examinations are not laws of 
nature, nor do they exist by divine right; and even 
when an examination is in the distance it is possible 
during some portion of the school year to give an 
appearance of leisure, while it is also possible to be 
uniformly hurried and worried when there is no examina- 
tion demanding its tale of bricks at a given date. 
The habit (fostered by examinations) of making boys 
get up with great accuracy one short portion of an
-P-A-G-E-71
  PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS 57 
author tends more than anything else to prevent this 
feeling tone of massiveness. If I read one play of 
Shakespeare through with a thorough understanding of 
the plot, the characters, and the philological notes, I am, 
it is true, to some extent a gainer; but I lose the sense 
of intimacy with the author, the tone of “ massiveness” 
for Shakespeare that a moderate familiarity with, say, 
one of the historical plays combined with a bowing 
acquaintanceship with all the others would have given 
me. To illustrate for examination purposes the debt 
of Vergil to Homer a few quotations and parallel 
passages are sufficient (they are probably given in the 
school edition) ; but to give the feeling tone of massive- 
ness it may be necessary to read to the class in a transla- 
tion (if they are but beginners in Greek) large portions 
of Homer, as well as to see that before they leave school 
they shall have read enough of Vergil to have acquired _ 
a grip of the whole story. The tone of the ancient 
history derived from reading the classic authors, or of 
the European history acquired through the medium 
of French and German writers, is essentially massive. 
The ideas have trickled in slowly, drop by drop, as 
chapter after chapter, with its linguistic difficulties, was 
mastered. Let any one compare his knowledge ot 
Greek history derived from the reading of Herodotus 
and Thucydides with his knowledge of, say, Egyptian 
history derived from a manual. He may have a 
considerable acquaintance with the dynasties and the 
Shepherd kings, but the feeling tone will not be 
massive, and unless his reading has been the intensive 
and extensive study of the expert, he will not seem 
to have lived through the period. 
In studies like geography the need of massiveness
-P-A-G-E-72
    
58 ena IN EDUCATION 
makes itself especially felt. The distance between New 
York and San Francisco is easily measured on the map, 
it is still more easily learned by heart out of a manual, 
but the realisation of it with the proper feeling tone is a 
different matter. It can to some extent be given by 
reading aloud such a narrative as R. L. Stevenson’s 
Across the Plains, and some other travellers’ records that 
give the details of the long voyage with all its dis- 
comforts. This takes time, but the result is real know- 
ledge, ideas with the qualities of experience instead of 
the sham knowledge that schools produce in such abund- 
ance. A couple of experiments may be sufficient to 
illustrate the logical side of a process in chemistry; a 
larger number worked by the pupils themselves must be 
provided if the “massive” feeling of having lived 
through the laborious discovery of truth is to be given. 
2. It must stand in a certain opposition to other 
ideas. It is a general law of mind that if any mental 
process is suddenly interrupted, broken off, or blocked 
(excluding the cases in which a shifting of interest 
brings into prominence a new set of ideas), attention is 
at once directed to the point of interruption, and its 
psychic energy is thus heightened. If I am pursuing 
a train of thought and find it impossible to get beyond 
a certain point, the idea at which the development 
ceased attracts more attention than its predecessors. 
If the natural course of my ideas leads me to pursue a 
train of thought on a certain subject, the denial of my 
views. by some one else makes me reconsider them 
carefully. If I am accustomed to hear a certain noise, 
say, a ticking clock, but normally pay no attention to 
it, the last tick gains a heightened energy when the 
clock stops. If I habitually derive enjoyment from the
-P-A-G-E-73
PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS 59 
possession of a certain object, the consciousness of the 
enjoyment becomes more vivid as soon as I am deprived 
of it. 
Special instances of this are—(a) All cases of contrast. 
(4) Unusual occurrences including the sight of something 
that is familiar under strange conditions. (c) The case 
of first impressions, ideas derived from which often 
possess an energy which is remarkable. This indeed 
is a condition which frequently leads to suggestiveness. 
The first two classes may be taken together. The 
teacher more than any other person who is engaged 
in placing ideas before an audience needs to avoid 
monotony and to insure the continual presence of 
contrast and of freshness. The actor, it is true, con- 
tinually repeats the same part, but never twice to the 
same audience; the clergyman addresses the same 
listeners every week, but has considerable scope for 
variety in the subject-matter of his discourses ; while 
the teacher with a very restricted syllabus for the term 
or for the year has to present the same facts over and 
over again to the same boys. Here is to be found the 
necessity for that best of all methods, the method of 
seeming to have none; the method that insures the 
greatest possible variety of presentation and continually 
presents old friends in new garments. History teaching 
affords a good illustration of this. The facts may be 
presented for the first time in the order of the text-book ; 
at the first revision they may be given from the 
biographical standpoint ; at the next from that of naval 
activity ; and, finally, they may be treated in connexion 
with the political history of the period. Such a method 
needs much ingenuity and much toil, but it is justified 
by its results; for the energy of all the ideas presented 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  60 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
is largely increased owing to the ideas of contrast 
involved. Thrice happy is the master who can be 
methodical, in the sense of working out a systematised 
and logical scheme, and at the same time contrive to 
be ever fresh; who can combine a little eccentricity 
with his daily routine. When he is inscrutable, when 
the class never know what he is going to do next, when 
they realise that in attacking new matter or revising old 
he will have some fresh device in reserve, and that they 
will have to be well on the alert to follow his moves, the 
principle of contrast is operating under the happiest 
conditions. 
The third case, that of first impressions, is of great 
importance, as the energy of the resulting idea is often 
intense, and it frequently develops into an auto- 
suggestion. In this way arose Ranke’s attitude towards 
history. ‘‘ His course had been determined, in early life, 
by Quentin Durward. The shock of the discovery that 
Scott’s Lewis the Eleventh was inconsistent with the 
original in Commynes made him resolve that his object 
thenceforth would be above all things to follow, without 
swerving, and in stern subordination and surrender, the 
lead of his authorities. He decided effectually to 
repress the poet, the patriot, the religious or political 
partisan, to sustain no cause, to banish himself from his 
books, and to write nothing that would gratify his own 
feelings or disclose his private convictions.”1 It is in 
childhood and in youth that these impressions are most 
effective, as is well shown by episodes in the childhood 
of the late Frederick Myers and in the youth of J. J. 
Rousseau. “The first grief that I remember,” writes 
Myers, “came from the sight of a dead mole which had 
1 Lord Acton, Lectures on Modern History, 1906, p. 19.
-P-A-G-E-75
    
PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS 61 
been crushed by a cart-wheel in the Borrowdale Road. 
Deeply moved, I hurried back to my mother and asked 
her whether the little mole had gone to heaven. Gently 
and lovingly, but without doubt, she told me that the 
little mole had no soul and would not live again. To 
this day I remember my rush of tears at the thought of 
that furry, innocent creature, crushed by a danger which 
I fancied it too blind to see, and losing all joy for ever by 
that unmerited stroke. The pity of it, the pity of it, 
and the first horror of a death without resurrection rose 
in my bursting heart.”! The other episode is recounted 
by Rousseau in his Confessions. On the road to Lyons 
he entered the house of a small proprietor and called for 
food. Only skim milk and barley bread were forth- 
coming, coupled with the assurance that there was 
nothing more in the house. By the end of the frugal 
meal, however, the peasant had taken Jean Jacques’s 
measure, saw that he was not a spy, and produced a 
ham, a bottle of wine, and an omelette, explaining that 
he would be a lost man and the prey of the tax- 
collector unless every one thought that he was dying of 
hunger. “All that he said to me on this subject, of 
which I was wholly ignorant,” says Rousseau, “made 
an impression that will never leave me. This was the 
germ of the inextinguishable loathing for the oppressors 
of the unfortunate working classes that has since filled 
my heart.”? In this case the energy of the ideas pro- 
duced by the first impressions was so great that they 
developed into auto-suggestions and coloured the whole 
of Myers’s and Rousseau’s lives. 
The responsibility of the teacher who introduces a 
1 F, Myers, Fragments of Prose and Poetry, p. 6. 
2 Confessions, Part I, Book iv, 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
    62 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
new subject to his pupils is very great. Frequently it 
is upon the first presentation that the future attitude of 
a boy to the subject depends. His pride in beginning a 
new language like Latin is great, and if, as in Greek, 
there is a new alphabet to learn as well, this only makes 
the interest greater ; but often the pride and the interest 
do not last long. When the teaching is mediocre the 
Latin lesson and the Greek lesson soon become part of 
the daily routine, the meaningless grind that has to be 
got through in the intervals of athletic exercise. A 
little care will avoid this. A vivid introduction to the 
Latin people, an interesting exposition of its importance 
to civilisation in general and to that of the Anglo-Saxon 
race in particular, the treatment of the language in 
close connexion with the history and customs of the 
people who spoke it, the use from the beginning of an 
easy continuous narrative as reading material, and the 
restriction of grammar to what is essential for sound 
translating, may make the boy feel from the first that 
he has been introduced to a new sphere of thought, that 
he has, so to say, got hold of a big thing, and he will 
value his early classical teaching accordingly. Some- 
times with susceptible minds and with favouring con- 
ditions these first presentations work out happily 
without any premeditation on the teacher’s part. 
Another episode in Mr. Myers’s life, his first introduction 
to Vergil, may be quoted. 
“On my sixth birthday my father began to teach 
me Latin, and a few days later he gave me the first 
Aeneid of Vergil, with an interlineal translation. The 
scene is stamped upon my mind: the ante-room at the 
Parsonage, with its floor of bright matting and its glass 
door into the garden, through which the flooding sunlight
-P-A-G-E-77
PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS 63 
     
   
      
   
    
                                      came while I pored over the new revelation with awe- 
struck joy : 
Musa mihi causas memora quo numine laeso. 
I remember the reverent emotion with which I hung 
on the rhythm of that majestic line. The invocation of 
the Muse came to me as absolutely real and new; and 
the ‘quo numine laeso’ suggested mysteries of divinity 
on which I dimly feared to dwell.” 
This is the kind of impression that can be made, but 
as a rule a skilful presentation is required to insure it. 
When the teacher under whom the subject is 
commenced refuses to take his opportunity the damage 
is often irretrievable. Half-way up the school, a couple 
of years later, perhaps, the boy may come under a good 
teacher with an eye for essentials and an instinct for 
boyish interests, but it is too late. The subject has 
already been labelled and put away as dull and 
meaningless. The lesson, though freshly presented, 
seems to be the same old thing; the master is assured 
that “we have done all this before.” Any one who has 
taught a class of fifteen-year old boys, with a sprinkling 
of older stagers who have stuck fast, knows how hope- 
less is the task of convincing some of them that there 
is any reality in the subject that they are studying. 
Yet in the beginning this might have been done. If 
Mulcaster’s advice were taken, and if the best and the 
highest-paid teachers were given to the lowest forms, it 
might always be done. As it is, the listless attitude 
towards literature, history, and language that is so 
baffling at a later stage can easily be accounted for. 
The value of first presentation has not been realised, and 
the ideas lack the energy that might have been derived 
from this source.  
-P-A-G-E-78
    64 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
3. It must be expected or desired. If I have been 
looking forward to an event, say, to the return of a 
relative from abroad, the ideas produced by his home- 
coming are peculiarly energetic; so also if I have been 
hunting for an idea, of which I know the general 
characteristics that it must possess in order to fit into 
my scheme of thought, it brings with it when found a 
new stock of energy to the system which it completes 
and tends to dominate. How far can a pupil be made 
to expect or desire the ideas that are to be presented 
to him? To demand that he shall desire know- 
ledge is perhaps to ask too much. We shall confine 
ourselves to expectation: if that can be produced, 
desire often follows. 
Expectation arises naturally when the mind is 
working along a well-devised scheme. When I am 
reading a novel that is skilfully constructed, certain 
expectancies arise in my mind and help to fetter my 
attention. I expect that the, hero, who is floating on a 
hen-coop in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, will be 
rescued by a passing ship, even though he has lost 
consciousness and is surrounded by sharks, and turn 
with a feeling of confidence to the next chapter to see 
how it came about. Were it not for this expectation, 
or if I thought it possible that he might not survive, I 
should probably skip the page, and turn on to see who, 
in fact, the real hero was, or how the story could get 
on without this personage. The ideas concerned with 
him would cease to have any energy for my mind. If, 
however, the story has been well written up to this point, 
I have a feeling of confidence that my natural expecta- 
tion will be justified. In the same way, when I receive 
a letter addressed in a certain handwriting and bearing
-P-A-G-E-79
    PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS 65 
a certain postmark, and recognise it as one which I 
receive periodically on business matters, I expect that 
the contents will be of a certain kind, though I may 
prove to be mistaken as to the details, and again, owing 
to my confident expectancy, the idea of the letter and its 
import are energetic. When a discord appears in a 
musical composition, I expect to find it resolved in the 
next bar, and attentively await the completion of this 
phase of thought. 
In school work it is necessary that this feeling of 
confident expectation should exist. In spite of the 
apparent eccentricities of method alluded to in the last 
section, in spite of the apparent want of sequence, of the 
reversal of the order of the day, the pupil should feel 
that each portion of the work on which he is engaged is 
the natural preliminary to something which is to follow, 
and leads surely to a further stage that would be 
unintelligible without it. If there is a preperception of 
what is to follow, so much the better, but if there is 
none, the certainty that the school work is not split up 
into disconnected tracts, but is an organic whole in 
which each part is the natural complement of the other, 
will suffice. This certainty is a function not of the 
presentation at the moment, but of the total organisation 
of school studies. When the geography of Europe in 
one school hour is followed by the reading of C@sar’s 
Gallic War in another, the pupil should expect to find 
that the first throws light on the second; when he is 
learning one branch of mathematics, he should expect 
to find that it stands in a close relation to the other 
branches that are taught him; when in classics or in 
English he is asked to acquire a certain technique of 
syntax or composition, or a certain method of comparison 
5
-P-A-G-E-80
  66 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
and inference, he should take it for granted that these 
things are not ends in themselves, but that they pave 
the way for something that is to follow; that though 
their meaning may not be wholly clear, they will help to 
make clearer what is yet to come; he should, in short, 
expect to find a rational sequel to everything that he 
does or learns. This confidence is for the learner what 
belief in the uniformity of Nature is for the man of 
science. 
4. It must convey a meaning. This is implied by 
the subject-matter of the last section, but the meaning 
there intended is of a restricted nature. It may be 
purely schematic, and have no connexion with any of 
the deeper meanings that sway human _ tendencies, 
Neither is the meaning that is supplied by apperception 
in the sense of the new ideas being grasped and under- 
stood by a suitable mental content here sufficient. With 
adult nature the meaning that the greater part of our 
experiences has for us is closely connected with their 
utilitarian properties. In passing a judgment on any 
of the conditions that affect our daily lives, we ask the 
question, “Of what use is it?” The meaning of the 
term “use” depends on our aims and on our interests, 
but knowledge that has no issue, processes that do not 
in some way forward the attainment of ideals, are tacitly 
put on one side, except in some cases of mental 
perversion. 
The older theory of a liberal education based itself 
on the exclusion of utility in any sense of the word, 
and is well expressed by Newman in his Jdea of a 
University. ‘That alone is liberal knowledge which 
stands on its own pretensions, which is independent of 
sequel, expects no complement, refuses to be informed
-P-A-G-E-81
  PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS 67 
(as it is called) by any end, or absorbed by any art, in 
order to present itself duly to our contemplation. The 
most ordinary pursuits have this specific character if 
they are self-sufficient and complete; the highest lose 
it when they minister to something beyond them.” ! 
This view interpreted in practice resolved itself into 
the teaching of grammar and syntax for their formal 
value, and is thus identified with the somewhat obsolete 
doctrine of formal training ; while considered theoretic- 
ally it failed effectively to separate the esthetic from 
the more logical elements involved in a literary training. 
It is probably true only of a certain kind of zsthetic 
perception that it carries the mind on to nothing beyond 
itself, and demands no issue or complement. When I 
am absorbed in the sight of a majestic cathedral or of 
a great pictorial masterpiece, my mental content is self- 
contained and static. The experience satisfies my 
zesthetic needs for the time being, and no further 
meaning or issue is asked for. This is a desirable 
experience, and one that may deepen and enlarge 
personality, but it is only one of many elements in 
experience, and does not even cover the whole field of 
esthetic. In its pure state it is to be found in the 
contemplation of single examples of plastic art; in 
literary or in musical compositions it is mingled with 
the expectation that each stage of presentation shall 
develop into the next, and the belief that every fragment 
has its use and its meaning within the whole structure. 
Modern tendencies in philosophy as found in the new 
school of Humanism are helping to make the issue 
clearer. “It is probably,” says Dr. Schiller, “by this 
senseless policy of insisting (falsely) on the uselessness of 
1 J, H. Newman, The /dea of a University, Discourse V,
-P-A-G-E-82
68 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
knowledge in order to arouse intellectual interests in the 
young, that these same sages have fostered the ‘deficient 
interest in the things of the mind’ which they are wont to 
deplore. Human indolence does indeed naturally shrink 
from the labour of learning, but there would probably 
be far less ground for complaint if the victims of their 
intellectual prejudices were allowed to learn how know- 
ledge is the most useful and salutary of all things, and 
shown the uses even of the staple methods. Nay, if the 
pedagogical value of interest were more extensively 
exploited, even the optimistic dictum of Aristotle, that 
‘all men by nature desire knowledge,’ might cease to seem 
a pathetic paradox. Such a policy, moreover, would 
afford far less nutrition to the ‘sordid utilitarianism’ 
which it is so customary and so hypocritical to denounce, 
than the working of our actual institutions. For inas- 
much as it is not considered legitimate to lay stress on 
the intrinsic usefulness of knowledge, on the value of 
language as our means of communicating with each 
other, on the value of science as our means of controlling 
the world, on the value of philosophy as our means of 
controlling ourselves, extraneous motives of a far baser 
kind have to be supplied to arouse the interest which 
sets in motion the wheels of our educational machinery. 
All the talk about the nobility of a disinterested pursuit 
of learning is almost wholly cant. In point of fact 
‘liberal education’ in England at the present day rests, 
not on the legendary ‘love of knowledge for its own 
sake,’ but on the twin pillars of Commercialism and 
Competition, buttressed, perhaps, in some few cases by 
the additional support of snobbishness. These two 
major motives have been combined in the crafty device 
of ‘scholarships’ awarded on the results of competitive
-P-A-G-E-83
PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS 69 
     
   
                                              
   
   examination, and their operation on the minds alike of 
parents and of children is practically irresistible.” + 
It is indeed mere cant to expect the minds of children 
to work from motives that do not appeal to’an adult, and 
therefore stress must be laid on the meaning of every 
idea that the school provides. Our pupils must realise 
that in history, whether of the classical period or of 
medizval and modern Europe, they are learning about 
the origins of their own social surroundings, and that 
without this knowledge a sound judgment on the matters 
that most concern a citizen is impossible; they must 
realise that language, in addition to being a means of 
communication, enables them to understand the character 
of the nation that uses it; that literature is read to give 
an insight into the deeper and more subtle elements of 
mental and spiritual life, and that a properly diffused 
understanding of these is essential for social welfare ; 
that science, in addition to its purely theoretic interest, 
has revolutionised the means of communication and 
transport, the diffusion of luxury and of learning, the 
advance of hygiene and longevity ; that mathematics is 
the basis of physical science, and that the discoveries 
most useful to mankind have often originated in pursuits 
whose motive was scientific curiosity only; in every 
portion of the curriculum the boy must be taught to see 
a bearing on his future activity in the world, and in this 
way the reality of life as a whole will be impressed upon 
him, and the energy of his ideas will be maintained. 
5. It must bring with it pleasure or pain. Other 
things being equal, an idea that is accompanied by 
noticeably pleasurable or painful feelings is more likely 
to possess energy and to attract attention than one 
1 F.C, Schiller, M.A., D.Sc., Studies in Humanism, 1907, p. 23.
-P-A-G-E-84
70 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
which is neutral in this respect ; while for the energy to 
be continued or developing, the affective state must 
be pleasurable rather than painful. It is true that 
the memory of a painful experience may possess a 
durable energy, but its nature is inhibitory rather than 
developing. 
This position is too commonplace to need develop- 
ment except in its particular application to the adolescent 
mind. Boys have not got the self-control of adults, 
neither have they the well-stored minds for which new 
ideas easily become interesting ; yet it is a mistake to 
suppose that on that account the interest must be 
supplied by the teacher if a pleasure-tone is to accompany 
the learning. A healthy boy is brimming over with 
energy, and it is possible that passive interest, especially 
if it is of long duration, appeals more to an adult than 
it does to him. Boys like to be managed ; they like to 
be given difficult tasks to perform, they like to have 
problems to solve, they do not in the least object if 
they are even driven to do a piece of work so long as 
two conditions are forthcoming: (a) It must involve a 
process of reasoning which they can just compass if 
they really exert themselves; (0) It must reach a 
definite conclusion at the end of the sitting, and the boy 
must realise pretty distinctly what he has got through 
and completed. 
Given these conditions, the harder the work is and 
the greater the activity involved, the keener will be the 
pleasure-tone for the average healthy boy. Soft options 
do not really please schoolboys, and they certainly form 
the worst possible preparation for suggestion. 
In discussing these preliminaries we have often been 
near the boundary-wall of suggestion; we have treated
-P-A-G-E-85
PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS A 
the conditions of interest, and interest is often able to 
lead to suggestive teaching, though it is not synonymous 
with it. It is now time to cross the boundary, and 
consider in what the essential factors of suggestion 
consist. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
CHAPTER ¥V 
THE PROCESS OF SUGGESTION ' 
THE conditions treated in the last chapter are those 
on which depend the energy of ordinary ideas, their 
capacity to attract attention, to initiate trains of associa- 
tion, and to form centre points for idea systems. A 
suggestive idea must possess energy ; it has indeed more 
energy than any other idea. These conditions, therefore, 
apply to it as well as to other ideas. Further, for a 
suggestive idea to be effective it must find as material to 
work upon groups of ideas that have arisen under these 
conditions. In all preliminary work, therefore, they 
must be strictly observed if suggestions are to produce 
their full result. Live teaching depends on this, and 
lifeless teaching can never lead to suggestion. 
But the suggested idea, with the peculiar energy 
which characterises it, arises under certain definite con- 
ditions of its own. 
1. It must be introduced by a person who is trusted, 
loved, or feared; or under circumstances that inspire 
these sentiments; or in a tone of voice or with a 
manner that the subject has always associated with 
ideas that are to be acted on or believed. One or other 
of these qualities, or more often a combination of them, 
is an invariable characteristic of the person who is 
72
-P-A-G-E-87
  
THE PROCESS OF SUGGESTION 73 
suggestive. In other words, a suggestive person may 
be one who can set up in another a state of emotion 
sufficient to produce an unstable and easily dissociated 
condition of mind, and thus to inhibit the rise or the 
development of contrariant systems. 
2. It must be introduced so that reaction is not set 
up. It is characteristic of the general law of interruption 
already mentioned that the point blocked in a train of 
thought has attention drawn to it, but the ideas on both 
sides of the blocked point are equally illuminated ; the 
idea of not paying my bills, and the reasons why I 
should not do so, are realised as vividly as the idea that 
I ought to settle them at once, the development of which 
they tend to arrest. A suggestive idea, however, must 
possess more energy than the ideas with which it is 
competing ; an idea, therefore, that initiates a strong 
critical reaction will not be suggestive. 
Reaction can be set up in two ways. (a) When an 
idea is presented to me that is wholly incompatible with 
my mental content, my sentiments, and my aims, it 
is immediately rejected. If I am bent on making a 
fortune on the Stock Exchange, a suggestion that I 
shall enter the Church will not be favourably received , 
similarly, when I am engaged in writing a theological 
treatise the jargon of the stockbroker will fall on deaf 
ears. If the reaction is sufficiently strong and immediate 
it does not reach the critical stage ; it is when the state 
of mind is sufficiently neutral for the new idea to obtain 
a slight footing that the critical reaction of ideas that 
are summoned up from the subconsciousness begins. It 
must be borne in mind that the understanding of an 
idea or of a position does not make me any the more 
inclined to act upon it; apperceived ideas are not
-P-A-G-E-88
  74 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
necessarily suggestive. The theologian may have a 
very clear conception of the advantages to be gained by 
making a successful coup on the Stock Exchange; but 
he prefers to act otherwise. 
(0) If the idea, though not very antagonistic or 
possibly neutral, is introduced in too great a quantity or 
too persistently, this may defeat its ends. In all mental 
process that is not guided by a strong element of 
conation, reaction is sooner or later certain to occur, and 
this all the more surely if the ideas involved have a 
strong feeling-tone. Association by contrast, or the 
passing from one idea to its opposite, is for ideas viewed 
on their cognitive side a questionable law, but it is 
certain that feelings readily pass over into their opposites, 
and to this truth no doubt is due the original acceptance 
of “contrast” as a primary law of association. The 
nervous centres which are excited by feelings of elation 
easily become fatigued, and the succeeding state is one 
of mental depression. With an emotional person love 
is often succeeded by hate, joy by grief, confidence by 
distrust. The changes of fashion in clothes and in social 
observances afford abundant illustration. It is always 
possible that the feeling-tone of an idea may by reaction 
tend to inhibit the idea that gave it birth. When, for 
example, it is first suggested to me by a circular that 
I should purchase Jenkins’s soap or hair-restorer, my 
state of mind is indifferent. I may need soap or hair- 
restorer, and the advertisement sways me slightly in 
the direction of these particular articles. If after an 
interval, during which the idea is absent from my mind, 
I occasionally hear praise of these commodities, or learn 
that my old friend So-and-so is using both with good 
results, the tendency to buy may grow stronger and 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
THE PROCESS OF SUGGESTION 75 
stronger. If, on the other hand, the first circular is 
immediately followed by a second, and the second by a 
third ; if I am unable to take up the newspaper without 
seeing the advertisement; if I cannot raise my eyes 
without finding it on a poster, a feeling of reaction arises 
and develops within me, until, finally, 1 make up my mind 
that were there no alternative I would willingly go bald 
and unwashed rather than patronise Jenkins’s specifics. 
The too direct or persistent introduction of an idea 
may thus result in a reaction against it and in the 
complete destruction of its suggestive energy. Or the 
reaction may be of a more general kind, Boredom and 
listlessness may set in, or a moody state of antagonism 
that will attach itself indifferently to the particular set 
of ideas that gave rise to it, or to any ideas that are 
unfamiliar, or to the person or situation that introduced 
‘them. 
This may be avoided by bringing forward the idea 
very gradually. If possible it should be introduced so 
that its very insufficiency makes the mind ask for more. 
The most suggestive teacher is he who makes his pupils 
feel that he is keeping back from them something of 
value that they can have if they ask for it and are 
worthy of it. The suggestive book is often one that 
just glances at a certain topic, then deals with other 
matters, and then returns skilfully to it again. The 
suggestive idea may thus derive some of its energy from 
being introduced marginally, and in this respect is 
unlike the ordinary idea whose energy depends on its 
filling the centre of consciousness. 
Reaction, while not necessarily contrariance, affords 
the conditions under which contrariance arises, and it 
must therefore be (a) repressed, or (4) avoided. 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
76 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
(a) The suggestive person does not always prevent 
the contrariant idea from coming into consciousness, 
but he inhibits it at an early stage by the emotional 
tone which he induces. The mind is first conscious of 
the feeling of antagonism, and then of its gradual 
subsidence. Such an emotional tone produced by a 
good speaker or teacher gives rise in the pupil to an 
unstable condition of mind which is, therefore, easily 
dissociated and influenced by suggestion. The draw- 
back of this state of mind is that it is weaker than a 
more unified condition, and is liable to be influenced by 
every suggestion. It cannot always be relied on. One 
teacher may dissociate it and influence it in a certain 
way at one time, and may flatter himself that he has 
produced a permanent disposition. But the pupil 
escapes from his influence, is dissociated by the society 
of some companion, and finally succumbs to a different 
suggestion. Much suggestion of this kind could scarcely 
strengthen the mind. It is a process that can be justi- 
fied only when it takes place seldom, when the mind is 
at a certain stage of growth, and for the sake of intro- 
ducing ideas of a specific kind which will, from their 
intrinsic value, tend to concentration, and thus will 
counterbalance the dissociation which preceded their 
introduction. It is, moreover, not a bow for every man 
to shoot with, since, if it is not absolutely successful, it is 
a complete failure. There is no middle way. 
(4) Thus, while it is certain that suggestion can often 
be carried out in this direct manner, it is not so certain 
that the process is a desirable one. Fortunately there 
is a method that does not involve these drawbacks. It 
has already been shown that new ideas can be introduced - 
so discreetly that no reaction is aroused, that sleeping
-P-A-G-E-91
     
THE PROCESS OF SUGGESTION he 
dogs can be let lie, and the subject remain sublimely un- 
conscious that he is being “got at.” The indirectness is 
increased when dissociation takes place under the in- 
fluence of a strong conative process, when the mind by 
sheer concentration on a certain system of ideas ousts and 
inhibits other systems, including those of criticism and 
contrariance. If when striving with all the energy of 
which I am capable to bring to completion an important 
piece of work I am daily brought into contact with a man 
for whose religion, nationality, or manners I have a pro- 
found dislike, this feeling of antipathy may be dissociated 
and prevented from coming to the front by my concen- 
tration on the matter in hand. While I am planning 
out methods of getting round obstacles, of doing good 
work with bad tools, and of keeping sulky workmen in 
a good humour, it is possible that my colleague, on 
repeated occasions, may have shown me a side of his 
religious views or of his national characteristics that I 
did not suspect before. In ordinary circumstances any 
tendency to approve would at once be held in check by 
my fixed antipathy ; but my set purpose gives my mind 
no leisure to dwell upon this antipathy, the new ideas 
fall on neutral ground, and by the end of our collabora- 
tion may themselves have become strong enough to 
inhibit my old tendency to reaction. 
Stated schematically : if an idea A be introduced in 
company with a conative series of ideas X, Y, Z, of which 
it does not form an essential element, though it may 
stand in some relation to it, the concentration of the 
mind on X, Y, Z will render impotent the system that 
might criticise and inhibit A, and A thus obtains a sug- 
gestive value. 
In such a state of mind the feeling tone is that
-P-A-G-E-92
  78 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
strenuous one which accompanies all effort, and the idea 
suggested in connexion with it will, even as a latent 
disposition, possess that feeling tone which tends to 
conation and therefore to unification of mind, It will 
silently take its place and dimly be realised as an idea 
which has an active value, it will tend to come to the 
fore again when any process of conation that involves it 
is at work, and when brought to the front by the 
ordinary processes of association, it will by its very tone 
tend to induce conation and the unity in diversity that 
is characteristic of the sane mind. This gives the ideas 
introduced by the indirect an immense advantage over 
those introduced by the direct method. 
In the latter case the ideas introduced when the 
mind is dissociated through emotion and is in a purely 
passive state will, it is true, have a suggestive value for 
the moment, and in some cases may possibly have a 
permanent value; but their feeling tone will be one of 
sentiment, and they will not be so certain to link them- 
selves naturally to states of strenuous effort or to draw 
them into operation in the future. 
There is yet another advantage inherent in the 
indirect method. If the new idea can be introduced 
almost unnoticed so as to lie latent for a period and 
then to assert itself, there is every chance that the pupil 
will look upon it as originating with himself. In this 
case he is little likely to bring contrariant ideas to the 
front, as they will be inhibited by his own feeling of 
self-esteem. When auto-suggestion of this kind can be 
secured, it is probably the most effective form of 
suggestion that there is. 
In direct suggestion, on the other hand, the process of 
communication has been as follows:—The subject has
-P-A-G-E-93
  
THE PROCESS OF SUGGESTION 79 
been aware of contrariant ideas in his mind, and has 
also been conscious of a desire on the part of the 
speaker to counteract them. The effort of the speaker 
has been successful through the emotional tone produced, 
but if the subject is candid with himself, he can be under 
no delusion as to the origin of the ideas which he feels 
to be operative in his mind. In other words, such ideas 
are far less likely to be received as auto-suggestions, 
and are far nearer the danger of diminishing the subject’s 
belief in his own personality (though here a proviso 
must once more be made in favour of the intrinsic 
virility of certain ideas), than are the ideas which are 
introduced indirectly, in connexion with effort, and 
without consciousness on the part of the subject that 
his views are being modified. 
There is yet another condition that furthers the 
suggestiveness of an idea. This is the suddenness with 
which it is presented. If when sitting in a drawing- 
room I say to an acquaintance suddenly, “There is a 
rat crawling up your leg!” his mind will at once be 
filled with the notion rat-leg to the exclusion of every- 
thing else, and he will immediately jump up, or at least 
look down, to see the supposed rat. His attitude of 
mind will not be, “I shall look down at my leg to see 
if what Jones says is true”; he has not time to consider 
the matter; the idea through its very suddenness over- 
flows into action at once before critical ideas are able to 
arise. In addition, the idea, a repellent one, by its 
suddenness gives a shock to the mental system and 
tends to render dissociation easy. In this case, there- 
fore, the conditions are (1) rapidity of presentation, 
which does not give the contrariant ideas time to arise, 
combined with (2) the shock of presentation, which helps 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
to hinder them from making a protest. If, on the other 
hand, I say to my friend slowly, “Are you aware that 
there is a rat crawling up your leg?” his mind has 
plenty of time to tackle the statement. Critical ideas 
immediately point out to him (@) that it is extremely 
unlikely that there should be a rat in the drawing- 
room; (4) that a rat is not a small object, and that 
he does not feel it; (¢) that if a rat were really there, 
my tone of address and my manner would be more 
agitated. As a result of this deliberation, instead of 
jumping up or looking down at his leg, he either 
takes no notice, or expresses his disbelief in well-chosen 
terms. 
The conditions of rapidity and of surprise are often 
to be found in the “ first impressions” mentioned in the 
last chapter. A new idea, presented to a mind which is 
unprepared for it, by virtue of the slight shock that it 
administers, develops a high degree of energy if it is 
sufficiently vivid, and either immediately or later on, 
after a period of existence as a latent idea, becomes 
suggestive and dominating. 
The personal qualities that tend to give suggestive 
force and to inspire confidence when dealing with 
adolescents must now be considered. They are neces- 
sary for indirect no less than for direct suggestion, 
though in the former their operation is not so immediate. 
Their possession is essential to the teacher in his relations 
with younger and with older boys, though with small 
children who are not very critical, and can be imposed 
upon with comparative ease, they may be simulated 
with good effect. With boys who are past the age of 
puberty, who are critical with that severity which marks
-P-A-G-E-95
THE PROCESS OF SUGGESTION 81 
the immature mind, and who habitually discuss their 
masters, a superficial veneer is easily detected. r 
1, The first of these qualities is self-control and 
reserve. Unless a man can first control his own ideas 
and impulses, he will be unable to influence those of 
others. Signs of weakness or self-indulgence of any 
kind are easily discerned by the thirty pairs of eyes that 
daily scrutinise a master’s movements. This self-control 
must extend to his personal relations with his pupils. 
It is not good that a master should be too familiar with 
his class. They should feel that he is a friend, but 
should not forget that he is a superior. A constant 
attitude of reserve will give great weight to his views 
and sentiments when he discloses them. 
2. Closely connected with reserve is the quality of 
inscrutability. A master about whom boys are never 
able to make up their minds, who remains always to 
some extent a sealed book to them, will keep them on 
their mettle and in an impressionable state by the slight 
element of uncertainty involved 
3. Inscrutability is often to be found in close relation 
with the quality of masterfulness, to the composition of 
which a variety of causes may contribute. For the 
modern schoolboy, as for the Hebrews whom Solomon 
had in mind, fear is the beginning of wisdom, and the 
affection that is based upon a wholesome awe is that 
which the master should seek to inspire. 
4. No device of teaching or of manner, no reserve of 
information or of sympathy, will promote suggestion 
unless the idea that is to be suggested is first vividly 
imagined and keenly felt by the teacher. It is, of course, 
possible for an unimaginative and unsympathetic man 
to introduce a boy to an inspiring book; but it takes a 
6  
-P-A-G-E-96
  82 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
very suggestive and a very interesting book to withstand 
the chilling dreariness of a dull teacher. Imagination 
and feeling are both contagious. This contagion makes 
itself felt through manner and play of features, but 
most of all through good verbal expression. It is, 
therefore, above all things necessary that a teacher 
should speak well. He may address his class in 
narrative form very seldom, but when he does so for 
the sake of conveying any impression, care should be 
taken that the exposition is really good. His manner 
and mode of speech may, perhaps should, be easy and 
colloquial in the ordinary course of nature, but when he 
reads a piece of literature to his class, the performance 
should be an artistic one, It is useless for him to feel 
the idea that he wishes to convey unless he is able to 
express it; while unless the idea be there, the power of 
expression is of no avail. Both are needed in com- 
bination, and both must be assiduously cultivated. 
The following description refers to a university pro- 
fessor, but school no less than university teaching needs 
just such a fusion of conviction and of utterance :— 
“There was a magnetic quality in the tones of his 
voice,” writes a hearer of Lord Acton, “and a light in 
his eye, that compelled obedience from the mind. 
Never before had a young man come into the presence 
of such intensity of conviction as was shown by every 
word Lord Acton spoke. It took possession of the 
whole being, and seemed to enfold it in its own burning 
flame. And the fires below on which it fed were, at 
least for those present, immeasurable. More than all 
else, it was perhaps this conviction that gave to Lord 
Acton’s Lectures their amazing force and vivacity. He 
pronounced each sentence as if he were feeling it,
-P-A-G-E-97
   THE PROCESS OF SUGGESTION 83     poising it lightly, and uttering it with measured delibera- 
tion. His feeling passed to the audience, which sat 
enthralled. It was in truth an emotional performance 
of the highest order—a wonderful work of art such as, 
in all likelihood, will never again be witnessed.” + 
5. After a description of Lord Acton’s eloquence, the 
statement that the teacher must possess both sufficient 
knowledge of his subject and sufficient general culture 
sounds absurdly commonplace. Life, however, largely 
consists of the commonplace, and education is not a 
collection of purple patches. The able teacher supplies 
the silver threads that bind together the fustian tissue, 
and one of these threads is the efficiency that comes 
from knowledge. Of this among the teachers of higher 
forms there is usually no great lack, but the present 
economic conditions of education, and the tradition 
that the staff of a school consists of a headmaster and 
of ushers, a tradition that in England we are very slow 
to shake off, give us a copious supply of ignorance 
among the teachers of smaller boys; while the ludi- 
crously excessive hours of work, again a traditional 
survival, deprive the larger number of assistant masters 
both of the energy and the leisure for adding to what 
knowledge they possess. 
And yet for the teaching of most English subjects or 
of the classics to junior forms, a very considerable back- 
ground of knowledge is required, and this knowledge, if 
present, soon makes itself felt and wins the respect of a 
class. Boys appreciate knowledge in a teacher more 
than is generally recognised ; indeed, if once they take 
it into their heads that he is exceptionally well informed, 
1 Quoted in the Introduction to Lord Acton’s Lectures on Modern 
History, 1906, p. xi.   
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
they are quite ready to have an exaggerated notion of 
his ability, and under these conditions listen with respect 
to what he has to say. They are also insensibly affected 
by his acquaintance with men and things, and for this 
reason it is to be regretted that schoolmasters do not 
occasionally pursue some other calling that brings them 
more into contact with their fellow-men before they 
finally devote themselves to teaching as a career. 
6. It need scarcely be added, however, that all the 
erudition in the world will be useless unless the other 
qualities of a teacher are there, and in particular, the 
general technique that for want of a better name may 
be called business-like habits in the class-room. The 
performance of routine work in a quiet professional 
manner is not showy; punctuality of appearance, regu- 
larity with lists of marks, rigidity in setting and 
demanding impositions, definiteness in the demand for 
home work—these things are but the drab-coloured 
background of efficiency. If absent they are missed ; if 
present they are taken for granted; but none the less 
they work in with the other elements which command 
respect, and it may be doubted if a teacher who neglects 
them will in the long run be suggestive, no matter what 
his gifts may be. f 
7. It remains to mention one personal characteristic 
on which great stress is often laid, namely, athletic 
qualifications. A teacher should, no doubt, be able to 
interest himself in the pursuits of his pupils; but the 
athletic habit of mind is no substitute for any of the 
above-mentioned qualities. It does not necessarily 
imply self-control or even business-like habits, and if it 
be accompanied by a lack of interest in ideas, the 
authority that it gives may be far too dearly purchased.
-P-A-G-E-99
THE PROCESS OF SUGGESTION 85 
Is it to be supposed that these qualities are to be 
found in all suggestive teachers, or that the lack of 
them renders suggestion impossible? Probably not. 
No foot-rule has yet been discovered that will measure 
the things of mind with absolute certainty, no analysis 
that does not involve a cross-division or allow some 
element to escape through its meshes; but for ordinary 
mortals these are the permanent conditions. Let the 
exceptional man, the born teacher, of whom we hear so 
much and see so little, remember that his gifts bring 
with them responsibility as well as freedom.

  CHAPTER VI 
SUGGESTION AND IMITATION 
IF an action is suggested by one person, it may be 
imitated by another, and the words “suggestion” and 
“imitation” are often used as if they were correlative. 
This use is a loose one. “Imitation” is a term generally 
applied to movements. I imitate some one’s manner of 
walking, or of eating, or his habits of speech, or of facial 
expression. I do not talk of imitating his feelings or 
his wishes. Here the term “sympathy” seems more 
appropriate. For general purposes, however, the 
meaning of imitation may be extended to a com- 
munity of ideas and wishes, and in this case it is 
possible to say that imitation and suggestion appear 
to be the same process viewed from the standpoint of 
the active and the passive agent respectively. 
This correlation of terms, though habitual and useful, 
needs modification in detail. As we rise from instinctive 
to conscious processes imitation goes through several 
distinct stages. It is customary to distinguish between 
(1) the instinctive stage. Here the agent is wholly 
unconscious that he is imitating. I rush into a hat- 
shop and select a certain hat from among a number that 
are shown me, and am quite unaware that my selection 
is influenced by the style of hats worn by my friends, or 
86
-P-A-G-E-101
   SUGGESTION AND IMITATION 87 
that the hat has been forced upon me by a skilful sales- 
man, in which latter case my choice has been imitative 
in the wider sense of the word. 
(2) The conscious stage. Here it seems natural to do 
what those like us are doing, and though we have a full 
consciousness of our action, very little attention is given 
to it. When I buy a hat of a certain kind because I see 
that my friends have similar hats, I am fully aware that 
in doing so I resemble them; but I do not necessarily 
act thus in order that I may resemble them. Out of 
this state of mind there easily develops (3) the 
purposive stage I actually desire to imitate. 
This desire may be actuated by one of three motives. 
(a) For the sake of imitation itself. I wish to have a 
hat like Jones’s that I may not appear unusual. (6) For 
practical ends. I want a hat like Jones’s because it 
appears to be a very serviceable one. (c¢) For reasons 
of self-esteem. If the process of imitation has been 
difficult, or if I may dread its impossibility, a feeling of 
emulation arises. I want to get a hat like Jones’s that I 
may not seem to be left behind in the race for hats; 
and this leads to a desire not merely to imitate Jones, 
but actually to outdo him. When women are selecting 
hats this element of emulation is prominent ; imitation 
has led to competition. 
How far is it legitimate to use the term “ suggestion ” 
as the correlative of all three stages of imitation ? 
At the lowest stage unconscious imitation is very like 
the correlative of indirect suggestion ; but this likeness is 
only partial. For in indirect suggestion the boy’s un- 
consciousness is not of the idea that is thus presented to 
him, but rather of the thought that his teacher wishes 
him to adopt it. Stages two and three in the same way 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
388 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
are to some extent the counterparts of direct suggestion, 
in so far as the agent feels a desire to act in a certain 
way, and realises to some extent whence it arises. But 
if suggestion be considered in connexion with the in- 
fluence of adults upon adolescents, it will be evident 
that the correlation is not absolute. For imitation takes 
place essentially among beings who resemble one 
another. 
If I see a number of people streaming through a gate, 
I feel a natural tendency to follow, and the more the 
individuals of which the crowd is composed resemble 
me, the greater is this tendency. Unconsciously I infer 
that what interests people whose mental constitution is 
like my own, will also interest me. In the same way, I 
experience a tendency to wear the same hats as my 
fellow-countrymen, and in particular, as those whose con- 
ditions of life and whose incomes are similar to my own ; 
but I have not the least wish to adopt a Chinese or 
Mexican head-gear. Similarly, a number of sheep will 
follow one another into a field, but will not follow 
horses, cows, or men. Imitation is between similars 
rather than between dissimilars,

It must be confessed that the teacher is different from 
the boys whom he teaches. Upon the common basis of 
1 R. Browning, ‘‘ Bishop Blougram's Apology.”
-P-A-G-E-103
  
SUGGESTION AND IMITATION 89 
humanity have been superimposed too many different 
layers of interests and tastes for the resemblance to be 
very great. Imitation will therefore be restricted in its 
operation. It may be objected that inferior beings often 
imitate those who are superior to them; that the 
manners and customs of conquerors become fashionable 
and set the tone for the conquered. But the analogy is 
not acomplete one. The members of a conquered nation 
are slow to confess that the conqueror is really superior 
to themselves, and are always ready to attribute his 
victory to chance or to circumstances that have no 
connexion with their own bodily or mental inferiority. 
While, therefore, their imitation of him is partially due 
to his social superiority, it is equally, if not to a greater 
extent, due to their belief that they are imitating equals. 
Between the schoolmaster and his pupils the relations 
are different. If he is too familiar with them, and is by 
nature an inferior man, the boys, far from considering 
that relations of equality exist between him and them, 
rapidly class him as being a person who is worthy of no 
consideration, and who certainly ought not to be 
imitated. If he is a sturdy and able personage, the 
feeling of affection that his pupils have for him is largely 
tinged with fear, and we are not always inclined to 
imitate those of whom we are afraid. It is not denied 
that boys are to a great extent affected by a master’s 
habits and mode of thought, but the imitation is in- 
stinctive; the boy does not deliberately determine to 
imitate. He may by suggestion and teaching be 
induced consciously to act in a given manner, but this 
suggestion is not the correlative of imitation. 
Still less does the relationship of instinctive imitation 
that exists between the master and the boy lead to
-P-A-G-E-104
  90 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
emulation. The gulf between them is too great. We 
emulate not those who are greatly our superiors, but 
those who are only slightly in advance of us—whose 
superiority may, we think, be apparent rather than real, 
and may be disproved by a little effort on our part. 
Neither in the class-room nor elsewhere do boys imitate 
masters with that imitation which leads to emulation. 
M. Tarde, in an interesting passage,! states that (1) 
the imitation of ideas precedes that of their expression ; 
(2) the imitation of ends precedes that of means. In 
proof of his assertion he points out that Spanish litera- 
ture had already been imposed on France with the 
Spanish power before fashions in dress in the sixteenth 
century came to France from Spain ; that in the seven- 
teenth century French literature had already reigned in 
Europe before French art and dress followed ; that the 
Italians of the Renaissance, when they imitated the 
Greco-Roman civilisation, did not begin by reflecting 
its externals in statues, in frescoes, and in Ciceronian 
periods, finally to be penetrated by its spirit, but that 
their model began by affecting their heart. That 
imitation, in short, begins with what is internal and 
essential, and proceeds to the external.? 
It is difficult to accept either of these statements with- 
out modification. The first may represent one order of 
sequence in the development of social imitation between 
nations; but as between individuals who are in close 
contact with one another, the internal, the guiding idea 
or aim, first makes itself felt through its external 
expression, and for educational purposes M. Tarde’s 
order must be reversed. If it is desired to produce a 
1G, Tarde, Les Lois de ? Imitation, 1895, p. 225. 
2 Ibid. p. 217.
-P-A-G-E-105
  SUGGESTION AND IMITATION gl 
sentiment in a pupil, the attempt to make him accept it 
or imitate it directly will in most cases be fruitless. 
One method, as already stated, is to introduce it to him 
gradually, and this largely through imitation of the 
processes in which it has been expressed. For instance, 
though this example must not be taken as expressing 
any undue preference for linguistic instruction of a 
certain kind, when a pupil translates from another 
language into his own the words and phrases in which 
a thought has been crystallised, by making the form of 
expression his own he is forced to place himself in the 
mental attitude of the writer ; the adoption of the form 
of expression brings with it to some extent the senti- 
ment which produced the expression; and when once 
the sentiment is there it is a comparatively easy matter 
to intellectualise it, and to emphasise the idea in con- 
nexion with which it originally came into existence. 
The second statement is more in accordance with 
fact, although its truth largely depends on the grade of 
imitation. I may unconsciously and _ instinctively 
imitate means to an end which I do not realise, though 
they will have no import for my mind. I may imitate 
them consciously, because I admire the person in whom 
I see them embodied, though the end to which his 
actions are tending is unknown or indifferent to me. 
But, if I adopt the end at which I see a person to be 
aiming, my imitation has reached the stage of conscious- 
ness where a full realisation of the end and of its 
meaning for the general purposes of my existence is 
present. For educational purposes it is often impossible 
to begin here. It is necessary rather that the pupil 
shall be induced by suggestion to accept the earlier 
stages in a progressive series of ideas long before the
-P-A-G-E-106
  92 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
true meaning of the progress dawns upon him, as it 
does at last when he reaches the end which illumines 
the pathway that he has traversed. 
The imitator thus plays the sedulous ape to the 
expression of ideas and feelings which he is frequently 
not in a position to understand. In the case of the 
schoolboy the society in which he lives is an ideal one 
for the propagation of such imitation. It represents, 
indeed, the essentials of society according to M. Tarde. 
Society is not primarily an economic combination in 
which masters and servants, workers and exploiters 
exist side by side, and in which the division of labour, 
the differentiation of professions, and the inequality of 
incomes produce a caste system. “It is rather a mutual 
determination of claims and acknowledgments of rights 
and duties than a system of mutual assistance. This is 
why it exists among beings either similar to or little 
different one from the other. ... If beings that are 
very different from one another can collaborate at some 
common work . . . it is because they have a common 
basis of ideas and traditions, a common language 
or translator, all narrow likenesses formed by education, 
which is one of the forms of imitative transmission. 
. . . One is, I repeat, in far closer relations with those 
whom one most resembles by identity of calling or 
education, even if they are rivals, than with those of 
whom one has the greatest need.” + 
In the artificial society of the school as nowhere else 
these conditions: are found in their purity. The boys 
are largely on the same plane of interests and ideas, and 
there are no economic divisions. If imitation is of 
similars by similars, and if emulation is of those who 
1G, Tarde, of. cit. pp. 66, 67, 70. 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
SUGGESTION AND IMITATION 93 
are superior, but separated by no great gulf of ability 
or of income, they should exist in schools as nowhere 
else. 
In school education there are thus two distinct factors : 
the influence of the master upon his pupils working 
through suggestion and imitation, and the influence of 
the pupils on one another working through imitation 
and emulation. Every word that the master speaks is 
spoken, not to one boy, but to a number, and its sug- 
gestive force will be intensified by the link of imitation 
among similars; every process that he initiates will be 
developed under the influence both of imitation and of 
emulation. 
The contagion of ideas is well, if somewhat fanci- 
fully, brought out by Espinas in his work Des Sociétés 
Animales. He points out that the buzzing of one wasp 
in anger induces the other wasps first to buzz in unison, 
and then to evolve the feeling of anger that originated 
the first buzz. He continues :— 
“T add that this anger will increase with their number. 
The effect of number on living creatures is very curious. 
We now know that man in isolation neither feels nor 
thinks like the same man transported into the middle of 
a crowd, and there is an observation often made by a 
celebrated critic that at the theatre the presence of the 
spectators alone makes them quite different from what 
they would have been separately. Let us examine 
what takes place in an audience to whom an orator is 
speaking. I suppose that the emotion felt by him may 
be represented by the figure 10, and that by his first 
words, at the very commencement of his eloquence, he 
communicates at least half of it to his hearers, who are, 
say, 300 in number. Each one will react by applause or 
   
-P-A-G-E-108
  94 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
by a redoubling of attention; there will be in the attitude 
of each a certain tension, and the combination of these 
attitudes suddenly assumed will produce what the news- 
papers call a ‘sensation.’ But this movement will be 
felt by all at once, for the listener is quite as much 
taken up with the audience as with the orator, and his 
imagination is suddenly assailed by the sight of these 
300 persons struck with emotion—a sight which cannot 
fail to produce in him a real emotion according to the 
law just enunciated. Let us admit that he feels only 
the half of this emotion, and let us consider the result. 
The shock felt by him will be represented no longer by 
5, but by half 5 multiplied by 300, that is to say, by 
750. If the same law is applied to the man who is 
standing up and speaking in the middle of this silent 
assembly, it is not the figure 750 that will represent his 
internal agitation, but 300 times 73°, since he is the 
focus to which all this crowd profoundly moved sends 
back the impressions that he communicates to them. 
This is why so many orators who are as yet inex- 
perienced are struck silent after their first vivid 
sentence by the very success of their words; the effect 
which they produce comes back to them so much 
increased that they are, so to say, overwhelmed by it. 
But when the orator succeeds in conquering his emotion 
and reacts on the crowd, one can see what repercussion 
of electric shocks must be established between him and 
his hearers—how both one and the other are in a few 
minutes carried far beyond their ordinary moral 
intensity. 
“The same phenomena are to be observed in any 
gathering of sentient beings, of whatever kind they are ; 
not only is the emotion of one of them communicated

SUGGESTION AND IMITATION 95 
to them all, but the larger the society the more intense 
becomes the common emotion,” ! 
Unfortunately, it is impossible numerically to work 
out the dynamics of suggestion or of imitation on these 
lines, but in any gathering the phenomenon described is 
undoubtedly to be found. If we put on one side the 
hypothesis of telepathy, the intensification of feeling that 
is found under these conditions can be explained only by 
motor imitation. ven before the speaker has opened 
his mouth the audience adopts an attitude of attention. 
All looks are directed towards him, unnecessary move- 
ments are inhibited, and the whole assembly is physically 
as well as mentally concentrated upon the one man who 
is to address them. My own attitude, as a unit in the 
mass, is intensified by and continues to draw support 
from those of the persons on each side of me. I cannot 
see the remainder of the audience, so that their posture 
cannot act on me by direct imitation, but I know that they 
also are in the same state of expectancy. This know- 
ledge increases the confidence of my own anticipation, 
and again tends to intensify my physical attitude, which 
again reacts upon my mental state. The presence of 
my fellow-auditors thus acts as a continual stimulus, and 
prevents my original mental attitude from dying away. 
It is the same when the orator is speaking. He makes 
a point and I cannot refrain from a slight motion of 
approbation; neither can my neighbours. I am con- 
fident that the hearers whom I cannot see are affected 
in the same way, and presently, when at the climax of a 
series of clever hits they break into a roar of applause and 
my confidence is justified, my nervous system is worked 
up to a high pitch of irritability which is prevented 
1 Espinas, Des Sociétés Animales, 1877, p. 200.
-P-A-G-E-110
    96 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
from subsiding by the expression of the same condition 
on the faces and in the persons of those around me. 
The orator by his art allows me to anticipate what he 
is going to say; I experience a slight feeling of satis- 
faction at my own perspicacity, and feel myself in direct 
rapport with him. The same feeling has been experienced 
by my neighbours (for the orator has accurately gauged 
the temper and intelligence of his audience), and there is 
the same motor expression and the same motor imitation 
followed by the reduplication of the feeling already 
there. And so the process continues indefinitely, limited 
in scope only by the weakness of the nervous system, 
which will not for long support such a strain without 
fatigue. 
In this condition the feeling that I am in immediate 
mental connexion with my fellow-listeners is a common 
one, and is easily accounted for by the hyperesthesia 
from which I am suffering. Under these circumstances 
I lose my power of judgment, and am carried away by 
arguments that would have no effect whatever upon me 
in cold blood. At the beginning of the speech the 
speaker will make only guarded allusions to the doctrine 
that he wishes to bring home to his hearers, but at the 
end, when motor expression and imitation have done 
their work, he will pour it forth like molten lava, direct 
suggestion will do its work, and I shall promise my 
subscription, or undertake to further the cause with 
alacrity. Half an hour later, when the audience has dis- 
persed and the stimulus of imitation is removed, how 
weak, when I go through them, do the arguments seem ! 
I knew them already, but they never affected me 
thus. This one is not an argument at all, but a gross 
non sequitur; this is a mere appeal to personal feeling,

and has no connexion with the matter in hand—yet I 
never noticed it at the time. 
Even among cool-blooded northern peoples imitative 
contagion carries an idea through a community like 
wild-fire. ‘“ Quiet, moderate-minded citizens in times 
of political excitement become blind fanatics without 
judgment. The suggestive element which in a single 
citizen displays itself in its smallest and least observable 
dimensions, in times of political excitement accumulates 
in the common political life of a people until it pro- 
duces mighty mass-effects.” 1 
The history of finance and of religion affords numerous 
examples of the manner in which these excitements and 
enthusiasms suddenly take possession of a large number 
of people at once. The persons affected may be of the 
most diverse kinds; all differences are levelled under 
the influence of some one strong and overwhelming 
passion which actuates all alike. Such a passion was 
the tulip mania in Holland in the years 1634-1637. The 
desire to possess bulbs came gradually into existence, 
and as it increased, the price of the better varieties 
naturally went up. Dealers then began to speculate in 
them, and did everything in their power to promote the 
fashion. They did this with such success, and the 
epidemic of tulip-buying spread so rapidly, that in 1637 
one parcel of 120 tulip bulbs was sold for 90,000 florins. 
The tide turned, some of the holders of bulbs grew 
nervous, and, finally, the factor of collective suggestibility 
which had brought this senseless mob-excitement into 
existence destroyed it with equal rapidity. In a couple 
of weeks the same tulip bulbs that had been worth their 
weight in gold lost their value. A “Semper Augustus” 
1 Stoll, Suggestion und Hypnotismus, 1904, p. 577.

98 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
which had changed hands for 13,000 florins, sold for 
50 only, and later on for 5. In spite of all the efforts 
of the tulip dealers to stop the panic, prices fell to 
nothing, and the speculators in tulips were ruined. Of 
a similar nature was the investing craze caused by the 
schemes of the financier John Law, in France, in 1719. 
Law promised vast fortunes to the shareholders from 
gold mines in the Mississippi valley, and from trading 
ventures in the East Indies, China, Africa, and elsewhere. 
The whole of France went mad with the desire to buy 
shares, although they possessed no information about 
the countries concerned, the nature of the trade, or the 
manner in which these vast profits were to be obtained. 
The prices of shares rose to fabulous sums until, as in 
the last-mentioned case, the whole thing suddenly 
collapsed, and in ten months the shares of the Company 
fell from 1800 to 40 livres. 
Illustrations of the same tendency in human nature 
are afforded by the South Sea Bubble in England, by 
the lottery craze in England and in the Southern United 
States, and by the numerous runs on banks and financial 
panics, of which every community has its tale. 
The history of religious enthusiasms is still richer 
in instances of the contagion of sentiment and of idea. 
The fervoured meetings that lead to sudden conversions 
and states of ecstasy, the manner in which an idea that 
may be abhorrent to other countries or ages takes sudden 
possession of a whole community, the acquiescence in 
the brutalities of the Inquisition, the widespread belief 
in witches,—all bear witness to the deep-seated tendency 
in man to motor imitation. Of the countless examples 
of this we will cite one only, which shows that children 
as well as adults are subject to such infection. The
-P-A-G-E-113
  
SUGGESTION AND IMITATION 99 
most remarkable episode of the fourth crusade, in 1212- 
1213, was the piece of fanaticism known as The 
Children’s Crusade. The idea that children as well as 
adults should play their part in the attempt to rescue 
the Holy Sepulchre from the Turks took hold of a 
number of boys and girls in France and in Germany, 
and, fostered by the usual concomitants of visions and 
revelations, spread like wildfire. Children of all ages 
—many were not more than twelve—and of all classes 
assembled together to the number, as is estimated, of 
50,000. They started on their journey with the greatest 
confidence, but without any adequate preparation, and 
their friends and relatives tried in vain to hold them 
back. In many cases the enthusiasm was communicated 
even to adults, who helped the young pilgrims with 
money and provisions. 
The end of this misguided expedition is well known. 
The German contingent made its way across the Alps 
to Italy, where they were robbed by the peasants. Seven 
thousand of them reached Genoa after suffering every 
kind of hardship, and it was with difficulty that a 
certain number struggled back to Germany again. The 
French division fared worse. Assembling at Paris, they 
proceeded as far as Marseilles, where two benevolent 
firms in trade with the East offered them a free passage 
and embarked them on seven ships. Two of the ships 
were lost at sea; the other five reached Alexandria, 
where the children were sold to Mohammedans as 
slaves, 
It is the presence in schools of this factor of contagion 
that makes school education so immensely powerful for

good or for evil. A large class certainly increases the 
work of the teacher out of school, but an observant 
teacher knows well how much more interesting it is to . 
teach a large class than a small one, and how much 
stronger the suggestive element can be.1 When Locke 
and Spencer decide against the boarding-school as a 
medium of instruction they omit all consideration of 
the contagion of numbers. Had either of them been 
a schoolmaster he could scarcely have failed to notice 
the phenomenon, and probably would have arrived at 
a different conclusion. Indeed, Spencer’s argument 
against the boarding-school, that it places the pupil 
back into a state of society far less advanced than that 
in which he was born, is in itself, for those who 
believe in suggestion and realise how much imitation 
may increase its power, a plea in favour of such in- 
stitutions, since in this way it is insured that children 
shall be placed in an environment suited to their stage 
of development, and therefore likely to be suggestive, 
and that they shall live under conditions of equality, 
and therefore be likely to imitate one another. Comenius, 
who as a schoolmaster had that experience of boys 
and of schools without which it is illegitimate to treat of 
the process of education, was wiser when he wrote: “ It is 
better that the young should be taught together and in 
large classes, since better results and more pleasure are 
to be obtained when one pupil serves as an example and 
a stimulus for another. For to do what we see others 
do, to go where others go, to follow those who are ahead 
of us, and to keep in front of those who are behind us, is 
the course of action to which we are all most naturally 
1 It is assumed that the number of pupils in a class should in no case 
exceed 30,
-P-A-G-E-115
  SUGGESTION AND IMITATION 101 
inclined. Young children, especially, are always more 
easily led and ruled by example than by precept. If 
you give them a precept it makes but little impression ; 
if you point out that others are doing something, they 
imitate without being told to do so.”} 
The master’s suggestive influence is thus rendered far 
more powerful by the tendency of boys to imitate one 
another. He is like one who speaks below his breath in 
a labyrinthine cave, to find that his words are bandied 
from rock to rock and return to him with added volume. 
With boys this contagion is imitative in the narrower 
sense of the word. Among adults when a book or an 
idea obtains a sudden vogue this is largely the result of 
definite commendation by word of mouth. True, the 
idea is, as we say, in the air, but the cause is the 
whispered praise or the casual word. In school the 
process is different. Outside the pages of the late Dean 
Farrar’s stories of school-life, boys, with rare exceptions, 
confine their conversations to the social interests of the 
daily routine in and out of school, and when an idea, let 
us say, of good form, or the unwritten law that we call 
good tone, becomes thoroughly diffused, the process has 
been a far subtler one that depends upon a mixture of 
contagion of feeling, operating in the manner described 
above, with only the very smallest portion of verbally 
expressed views on the matter. 
But while much of the master’s influence may depend 
on the fact that he is dealing with a class, and while he 
should never forget this, the effect of such human 
association will be lost unless on every occasion the boy 
believes that his teacher is interested in him personally 
and separately. Most men begin their teaching careers 
1 The Great Didactic, chap. viii.
-P-A-G-E-116
  102 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
by taking charge of a fairly large class, and, before they 
are aware of it, acquire the habit of handling a class as 
a whole without much reference to the units of which 
it is composed. Such a teacher, judged by a certain 
standard, is often an extremely good one. To teach a 
class as a whole is one of the tests of schoolcraft. A 
considerable amount of formalism and mechanism is 
necessary to promote discipline and insure impartiality, 
and these are the bases of good teaching ; but discipline 
may degenerate into the repression of the drill-sergeant, 
and the drill-sergeant may teach a class for a year with 
little trouble to himself and with results that are good on 
paper, yet without ever realising that his pupils differ very 
much in character. Indeed, in his class-room and as far 
as he gives himself the opportunity of judging, it is 
quite possible that they do not. In such a case he will 
not get into touch with the individual, he will not make 
each boy feel that he is a friend as well as a teacher, 
he will miss the countless opportunities of putting heart 
into a despondent boy and administering judicious snubs 
to a conceited one; individually and collectively he will 
not get the best work out of his class, and if the units 
are not affected, contagious imitation between them is 
impossible. It is said of Arnold that his success in 
dealing with boys was due to his modest beginning with 
a few pupils at Laleham. He thus acquired the habit of 
realising that each boy had an individuality, and that 
his business was to get into touch with it. Without this 
personal contact there will not be the reverberation of 
influence that class teaching promotes, and the scope of 
suggestion will be correspondingly limited.
-P-A-G-E-117
CHAPTER VII 
CHARACTER, METHOD, AND SUGGESTION 
To all teachers worthy of the name there comes at a 
certain period an awakening of the educational conscience, 
This awakening cannot be prematurely hastened ; it 
must be a spontaneous growth. It demands a know- 
ledge of educational conditions, but does not necessarily 
arise out of it. It implies a sympathy with boy life, 
yet frequently does not accompany it. Its essence is a 
conviction that the idea environment supplied in the 
curriculum is effective in building an ideal construction 
in boys’ minds, and that this ideal construction in the 
last resort exercises a control on conduct. It involves a 
belief that ideas ultimately tend to form character, and 
the result of this conviction is a deepening of the interest 
taken in school work. 
The word “deepening” is advisedly used ; for it must 
not be supposed that a teacher can take no interest in 
teaching before the awakening comes. Far from it. 
Some teachers, no doubt, cordially dislike their work at 
first, though they come to take an absorbing interest in 
it later on; but it is none the less true that the majority 
find enjoyment in it from the beginning. To many the 
mere society of boys is pleasant ; to others of an organ- 
ising nature it is congenial to possess authority and to 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  104. SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
exert it; to others deeply interested in their subjects it 
is at first sufficiently agreeable to expound them. But 
these interests are often transient. The time comes 
when the question is asked: “Can the subject I am 
teaching have any effect on my pupils’ character and 
conduct?” The educational conscience is awakened, 
and, unless some satisfactory answer can be given to the 
question, enthusiasm may die away and nothing but a 
sense of futility remain. 
That this is not an imaginary situation is sufficiently 
shown by the statements of experienced teachers, who 
question not only the moral, but even the intellectual 
value of the work in which they have been engaged. 
Mr. Leighton, a headmaster of many years’ standing, 
writes: “The great boarding-schools turn out too high 
a percentage of failures—young men who seem to be 
useless for any forthcoming piece of this world’s work. 
. .. Only a minority of boys—about one in four—is 
capable of profiting very much either by books or by 
laboratories. Education as distinct from instruction 
requires that the environment shall contribute more than 
the schooling.”+ And again: “There are groundless 
expectations, followed by disillusionment and scepticism. 
. .. This scepticism which I contend to be almost 
universal.”? Another writer, also a schoolmaster, is 
even more outspoken: “A generation is growing up in 
which the clever boys are apt to be prematurely d/ases 
with artificial learning, and the rest contemptuous of the 
enemy who laid so blighting a hand on the golden days 
of boyhood, and is now seen by the grown-up man to be 
a mere toothless, mumbling giant... . A few genera- 
1 RL, Leighton, Zhe Boy and his School, 
2 Op. cit, p. gt.   
-P-A-G-E-119
  
CHARACTER, METHOD, SUGGESTION 105 
tions more, and the nation will feel towards education as 
the French before the Revolution felt towards their 
religion—no longer able to believe in the one particular 
form whose hollowness is at last too patently visible, and 
yet incapable of grasping any other.” + 
If views like these are common, still more if they are 
justified, it seems scarcely worth while to consider the 
whole business of teaching with any seriousness. If, on 
the other hand, the conviction is strong that ideas 
properly introduced take possession of the whole mind 
and affect the springs of conduct, the further question 
arises: “What is the proper mode of introduction?” 
In other words, the problem of method becomes of para- 
mount importance. The teacher of to-day is not the first 
person who has asked for a method. Many wanderers 
through life have felt the need of a method to guide their 
conduct: Descartes was induced to seek a method to 
guide his reasoning ; from Comenius to Rosmini writers 
on education have sought a method by which clearness 
in exposition may be secured. Our teacher differs from 
these in that the possibility: of attaining his end is vigor- 
ously denied. No one doubts that the conduct of life 
can be improved by a system, or that logical rules can 
aid the reasoning powers, or that the principles of grada- 
tion and arrangement can facilitate clear exposition ; but 
it is frequently asserted that ideas have no power to 
modify conduct, to control emotion, or to form character, 
and the position is a plausible one, for we are all familiar 
with well-informed men who have no force of character, 
and with narrow-minded and ignorant ones who are self- 
controlled and energetic, and who bring their surroundings 
into harmony with their wishes in the most surprising way.

  106 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
Writers who base their arguments on a superficial 
psychological analysis or on none at all are ready to 
maintain that character is innate and inalterable. “It is 
easier for a blonde to convert herself into a brunette,” 
says Rousseau in his Nouvelle Heloise, “than for a man 
to change his character.” “Cana man change his char- 
acter?” asks Voltaire, replying, ‘Yes, if he changes his 
body.” From another standpoint writers like Newman 
deny that the idea environment given by a liberal educa- 
tion can affect the springs of action. It is worth while 
to quote 2” extenso a passage from Discourse V. in his 
Idea of a University: “Liberal education makes not the 
Christian, but the gentleman. It is well to be a gentle- 
man ; it is well to have a cultivated intellect, a delicate 
taste, a candid, equitable, dispassionate mind, a noble and 
courteous bearing on the conduct of life; but, I repeat, 
they are no guarantee for sanctity or even for conscien- 
tiousness. Taken by themselves they do but seem to be 
what they are not: they look like virtue at a distance ; 
but they are detected by close observers and in the long 
run... . Quarry the granite rock with razors, or moor 
the vessel with a thread of silk: then may you hope 
with such keen and delicate instruments as human know- 
ledge and human reason to contend against those giants, 
the passion and the pride of man.” 
Here Newman is speaking in the name of the Catholic 
Church. He is decrying the influence of the intellectual 
environment and the effective value of ideas as motive 
power that he may extol the influence of religion, But 
his standpoint, although it suits his religious convictions, 
is not necessarily derived from them. His psychological 
presupposition of a fully developed mind which will 
function to its full extent if given the proper material to
-P-A-G-E-121
CHARACTER, METHOD, SUGGESTION 107 
work upon, the implicit doctrine of faculties, and the com- 
plete absence of the conception that mind is in a con- 
stant condition of becoming, make it extremely difficult 
for him to justify the position that in the long run it is 
ideas that are vitally important ; that, though they may 
not constitute the whole mechanism, they set it in motion; 
that, without themselves being the trains of powder, 
they are the sparks that fire the magazine. For New- 
man the mind works in closed compartments. Liberal 
education gives a justly proportioned outlook and a 
capacity to enjoy intellectual pleasures ; over the passions 
and the sentiments it exercises no control, and is there- 
fore valueless for purposes of guidance in the more 
difficult and dangerous situations of life. 
Now this view, if accepted, must lead to educational 
pessimism, and of this, as we have seen, there is no lack. 
If ideas are powerless as controls, the value of class-work, 
which to a great extent consists in placing ideas before 
the young, appears on examination to be very small, 
except in so far as these ideas represent knowledge of 
conventional, professional, or commercial value. That 
it gives exercise to the common factors of all mental 
process, attention and observation, and that it involves 
a wholesome compulsion to do what is distasteful, will 
readily be admitted. But it may be urged that similar 
opportunities are given by the situations of professional 
and commercial life, and that it is therefore scarcely 
worth while to expend much energy in considering 
problems of method or of curriculum. Yet the greater 
part of the energy and the time of the teacher is spent 
in the class-room and in teaching definite subjects, 
and it is therefore not surprising that men who are 
interested in their profession readily embrace any theory 
   
-P-A-G-E-122
  108 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
that appears to lend validity to the business of their 
lives, 
Such a theory is afforded by the Herbartian psy- 
chology, and the insidious flattery that it supplies to the 
teaching profession has insured its popularity among 
those whose enthusiasm is greater than their critical 
powers. For Herbartians feeling and will arise out of 
the interplay of ideas; and, as the introduction of ideas 
in one form or another is a comparatively easy task, the 
formation of character through curriculum and method 
seems easy too. Alas! investigation shows that the 
Herbartian system is hopelessly one-sided. It leaves 
out of consideration all the stubborn elements of inherited 
instinct ; it fails to convince us that feeling and will are 
not forms of mind as ultimate as intellect. It is, no 
doubt, possible to interpret Herbartianism in such a 
manner as to read into it the positions of modern psy- 
chology ; but this method of dealing with a system which 
has its definite place in the history of psychology is dis- 
credited. The problem of the relation between knowledge 
and conduct is one for which it is not likely that a final 
solution will ever be found. Each age must conduct the 
investigation from its own standpoint, and for educational 
theory to coquet with worn-out psychologies is undigni- 
fied, for it is a confession of weakness, and unconvincing, 
for it brings an exploded psychology to support positions 
that need whatever aid modern philosophy can supply. 
It is from a modern standpoint, then, that the attempt 
to show the influence of ideas on character must be 
made, and a preliminary inquiry into the nature of 
character is necessary. No term is more often used by 
those who write on education, and to few terms can so 
many different meanings be assigned. Yet when, with
-P-A-G-E-123
  CHARACTER, METHOD, SUGGESTION 109 
a practical end in view, we seek for enlightenment as to 
the elements of which it is composed, we find that the 
lanswer is not so satisfactory as the claims of modern 
psychology would lead us to suppose. Neither the 
analysis of character nor the modes of influencing it, 
which might be derived from such an analysis, have 
ladvanced as far as was anticipated in the latter half of 
the last century. It was J. S. Mill who, in England, 
rst drew attention to the great importance of the 
ubject in connexion with educational theory, and who 
uggested the name Ethology for the science of which the 
tudy of character would form the subject-matter. “A 
cience is thus formed to which I would propose to give 
he name of Ethology, or the Science of Character, from 
os, a word more nearly corresponding to the term 
character,’ as I use it here, than any other word in 
he same language. The name is perhaps etymologic- 
lly applicable to the entire science of our mental and 
oral nature; but if, as is usual and convenient, we 
mploy the name Psychology for the science of the 
lementary laws of mind, Ethology will serve for the 
Iterior science which determines the kind of ‘character 
roduced in conformity to those general laws by any 
et of circumstances, physical and moral. According 
o this definition, Ethology is the science which corre- 
ponds to the act of education, in the widest sense of 
he term, including the formation of national or 
collective character as well as individual.” ! 
The science of Ethology, thus confidently adum- 
rated, has made comparatively little progress, but this 
is not because the subject has been wholly neglected by 
sychologists. Although in Germany and in England 
1 J. S. Mill, Logic, Book VI. chap. v. sec. 4. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  110 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
little that is systematic has been done, a series of works 
bearing the names of such distinguished writers of the 
French school as Paulhan, Ribot, Fouillée, and Mala- 
pert, testifies to the natural interest of the Latin mind in 
character-analysis.1 If the reader arises from a perusal 
of these works with a feeling of disappointment, this is 
probably because their aims have been too ambitious ; 
starting from the analogy of a zoological classification, 
they have been in too great a haste to formulate genera, 
species, and subspecies of character to which any given 
individual instance could be referred for explanation, 
while all the time the analysis of the general basis o' 
character and the terminology of the subject have been 
in a very imperfect condition. 
Two clearly defined standpoints from which to treat} 
the subject have been adopted. That which refer. 
character to physical conditions, and attempts to giv 
a medicinal or physiological explanation of its varieties, 
and the confessedly psychological mode of treating th 
subject which considers character as a complex o 
psychical elements and aims at tracing the laws o 
their combination. 
The physiological explanation takes us back t 
Hippocrates, who systematised the scattered views o: 
Anaxagoras and Democritus into the theory of the fou 
humours—blood, phlegm, bile, and black bile ; which ar 
in turn related to the four fundamental elements i 
nature—moisture, dryness, heat, and cold, with fou 
temperaments depending on them. This classification 
slightly modified, was adopted by Galen, who dis

CHARACTER, METHOD, SUGGESTION rir 
tinguished nine temperaments, of which the four 
composite ones were produced by the predominance 
of heat and dryness, of heat and moisture, of cold and 
dryness, and of cold and moisture, with the names of the 
choleric, the sanguine, the melancholic, and the phleg- 
matic temperaments. 
This theory is of especial interest because, although 
the physical and physiological ideas underlying it have 
long been discarded, the terms still remain in use and 
are commonly employed when discussing character. 
We still refer to a friend as choleric or phlegmatic or 
sanguine, and the terms, though not very well defined 
in our minds, do nevertheless cover certain groups of 
characteristics. We do not, however, imply that the 
qualities in question are produced or even accompanied 
by an excess of bile or of blood. 
The explanation is that the classification of tempera- 
ments was really a psychological rather than a physical 
one ; it represented certain groupings of psychic qualities 
which are commonly found together. Modern descrip- 
tive psychology is content with a classification based 
on observation, and with an attempt to trace the origin 
and growth of complexes that seem to hang together. 
It recognises the desirability of showing the connexion 
between psychic process and nervous or organic con- 
ditions; but it deprecates any too hasty attempt to 
establish this connexion, and is content to pursue 
psychical analysis on the one side, and research into 
the physiology of the nervous system on the other, and 
to look upon the establishing of the psychical conditions 
of a mental state as a sufficient explanation for the 
time being. 
It was not so with the earlier adventurers in the
-P-A-G-E-126
  112 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
field. For them the psychical explanation would have 
been as good as none, and they were therefore driven to 
account for mental qualities by attributing them to the 
agency of the bodily organs with which they were familiar. 
How correct the classification of the temperaments was 
on the psychical side is shown by the adoption of a 
very similar arrangement by Wundt. 
Starting with a distinction between the strength and 
the speed of psychic movements, he points out that some 
persons are inclined to have strong emotions, and others 
to have weak emotions, which gives the distinction be- 
tween the strong and the weak temperament ; that some 
again vary their emotions rapidly, and others slowly, 
which gives the distinction between the quick and the 
slow temperament. Combining these qualities in pairs 
we get a classification very similar to the old one of the 
temperaments. The strong and quick temperament, the 
choleric; the strong and slow temperament, the melan- 
cholic ; the weak and quick temperament, the sanguine ; 
the feeble and slow temperament, the phlegmatic.t 
The tendency to supply an organic basis for mental 
states, which is so well illustrated by the theory of 
the temperaments, is as strong now as it was in the 
time of Galen. In the first half of the nineteenth 
century Descurets traced the passion of love to chronic 
disease of the heart and lungs, ambition to acute or 
chronic inflammation of the digestive organs, and envy 
and jealousy to the dilatation of the blood-vessels or to 
hypertrophy of the liver.? 
A still more remarkable illustration is found in a 
recent attempt by Mr. Jordan to establish a connexion

between anatomical and physiological structure and 
mental disposition.1 He noticed that the women who 
came into hospital suffering from injuries inflicted by 
their husbands had something peculiar about their 
personal appearance. “I came slowly to see that the 
skin of the assaulted women was often clear, their hair- 
growth was never heavy or long, and the eyebrows 
were spare and refined. Their upper spinal curves were 
so formed as to give a somewhat convex appearance to 
the back and shoulders, and a more or less forward pose 
to the head.” 
These women, he ascertained, were those with sharp 
tongues who had been assaulted because they nagged 
at their husbands continually. As distinguished from 
them he observed a small number of women who were 
brought in seriously injured or dead. They differed from 
the others in skin and hair and skeleton. The spine was 
straighter, the head and neck and shoulders were held 
upwards and backwards, the hair-growth was abundant, 
and the eyebrows marked. These, he discovered, were 
the women who had been assaulted by husbands acting 
under the influence of well-founded jealousy, and with 
clearly murderous intent. On this basis he attempts to 
distinguish between two temperaments existing in close 
connexion with anatomical structure—the active or 
tending to be active, and the reflective or tending to be 
reflective. 
“The less impassioned individuals are not merely 
active, quick, practical; they tend also to be changeable 
and fond of approbation. When the mental endowment 
is high and the surroundings favourable, the active and 
less-impassioned temperament furnishes many of our

-P-A-G-E-128
  114 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
finest characters. Sometimes, especially when the 
mental gifts are slight, the character is less pleasing: 
love of change may become mere fitfulness; activity 
may become bustle; sparing approval may turn to 
actual censoriousness ; love of approbation may de- 
generate into a mania for notoriety. 
“In the impassioned temperament, on the other hand, 
we find quite another group of elements: repose or even 
gentleness, quiet reflection, noiseless methods, tenacity 
of purpose. The emotions, good or evil, are deep and 
enduring. In this class also, especially when the 
intellect is powerful and the training refined, lofty 
characters are found. In it too are found probably the 
worst and most degraded characters.” 
Mr. Jordan’s theory is of especial interest, and has 
been quoted at some length because he is sufficiently 
consistent to carry the physiological - temperament 
position to its proper conclusion. “If character is for 
the most part a product of organisation and parentage, 
it follows that education is mainly a physiological art. 
It is an art which should aim at strengthening feeble, 
repressing exuberant, and correcting perverted nerve. 
“The first duty of the physiological educational artist 
who accepts the teachings of physiology, and who will 
in future come to be the one supreme, confidential 
‘Father Confessor,’ is to study the character, that is, the 
endowments, proclivities, conduct, the gifts, defects, and 
eccentricities of the parents,” 2

that the less impassioned temperament is illustrated by the skeletal poise of 
Newman, Napoleon, Wesley, and Spurgeon; and the more impassioned 
temperament by that of Burns, Dante, Hawthorne, and Byron.

If indeed the basis of character is entirely physio- 
logical, it is difficult to see what influence the teacher 
can have upon it. Our only course will be to dismiss 
the existing staff in all our schools and fill the vacant 
places with qualified medical men. Before taking this 
extreme step, the statement of the case from the other 
standpoint, that of psychological analysis, must be 
considered. 
In summing up a man’s character, says M. Paulhan,! 
we may call him (1) equilibrated and serious, or 
capricious, contrariant, and incoherent; or (2) calm or 
passionate and vivacious ; or (3) a glutton or abstemious. 
These judgments are on different planes. The first 
depends on the nature or general form of the association 
processes that control mental activity. The second 
depends on the different manners in which the elements 
can realise these general forms. The third depends on 
the preponderance of certain tendencies. For purposes 
of simplicity the classification may be reduced to a 
twofold one: (1) The classes of qualities that depend on 
the manner in which tendencies exist ; on their coherence, 
their vivacity, and their tenacity ; that is to say, on the 
forms of essential activity. (2) The classes constituted by 
the tendencies themselves ; that is to say, by the concrete 
tendencies which direct that activity. It may, of course, 
be urged that the particular forms of association are the 
effects of strong tendencies, and not their causes, and 
in that case if the tendency is referred to an organic 
basis, the matter remains much where it was under the 
auspices of the temperaments. At the mention of 
association, however, the teacher may regain his courage. 
Association is a process over which instruction can 
1 Paulhan, Les Caractéres. 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  116 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
exercise some influence. I cannot alter the poise of my 
pupil’s skeletal disposition, but I can affect his modes 
of association ; I can at least to some extent control the 
nature of the ideas that are associated, Still further 
encouragement is given by M. Ribot. In his earlier 
work he certainly lays more stress on the organic basis, 
“The affective states are the deepest seated in the 
constitution of character. They are the bed-rock; the 
intellectual dispositions are superimposed, Intelligence 
is never a fundamental element in character. Intel- 
lectual dispositions can operate only indirectly on its 
constitution.” ! 
From this standpoint desire appears to be supreme, 
while intelligence is merely superficial, and character 
is the preponderance of an instinct or of a group of 
instincts. But the maturer analysis to be found in his 
Essai sur les Passions indicates an avenue of escape. 
Emotional life still constitutes the basis of action, but 
it is to be found at different grades of organisation. 
There are (1) affective states of psychic life, the raw 
material ; tendencies and desires inherent in the psycho- 
physical organism. (2) The emotions, which are nothing 
but sudden reactions, The egoistic—fear and anger ; the 
altruistic—pity, etc. (3) The passions, which are among 
the important constituents of character. These are 
opposed to the emotions by the predominance of an intel- 
lectual state, by their stability and their relative duration. 
Emotion is thus a primitive state, passion is a secondary 
and more complex form. In the beginning the passion 
is instinctive and impulsive.? ‘“ More often the passion is 
already formed before the consciousness is aware of it.

CHARACTER, METHOD, SUGGESTION 117 
Without talking of the subterranean labour—unconscious 
or subconscious—which is a very probable if not certain 
hypothesis, there are produced in the consciousness first 
fragmentary tendencies, scattered, momentary, all leading 
in the same direction of attraction or repulsion for the 
same person, the same thing, the same idea. This 
movement of advance and recoil follows the law of 
nervous excitation—it advances like an avalanche, it rolls 
up like a snowball, or, to use scientific language, it works 
by summation.” Finally, it is intellectualised. “It is 
a positive and precise fact which marks the moment 
when the passion is constituted and which serves as its 
criterion: zt zs the apparition of the ruling, guiding idea, 
recognised as such.” ! 
In this description of the development and organisa- 
tion of the deep-seated, stable, and intellectualised impulse 
which he calls a passion M. Ribot gives us the distinctive 
marks of character as the term is used by the educationist. 
The word may be and often is employed in a more 
general sense. It may imply simply the characteristics 
that distinguish one personality from another. It need 
not even involve the conception of strength. “A very 
colourless character,” says La Bruyére, “is that of 
having none.” It is certainly a characteristic, like many 
other peculiarities of disposition to which we should 
shrink from applying the word character, though we 
could not neglect them when passing judgment on their 
possessor. At the next stage the term may be used to 
denote the possession of strongly marked tendencies, 
which though they may lack duration, and may manifest 
themselves in a fragmentary and unaccountable manner, 
still give an appearance of strength when compared with 
1 Ribot, of ci#, p. 139.
-P-A-G-E-132
  118 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
the attributes of the colourless man, At the next and 
last stage we find the original impulse so intellectualised 
as to be stable and durable. The idea which is now the 
conscious guide may develop into a whole system of 
ideas, the greater or less complexity of which will 
determine the fixity of purpose. Further, the idea which 
in the beginning, as grafted on the organic tendency 
had an almost parasitic existence, now tends rapidly to 
modify and in some cases to destroy the parent stem, 
and may even substitute for it another though cognate 
impulse more suited to its matured form. We then 
have a developed character the basis of which is less an 
organic tendency than a system of ideas which embodies 
a principle. When we talk of character in this sense 
we have in mind not characteristics, but will ; we think 
of a habit of reasoned action which is so stable that it 
can be conceived of as functioning uniformly under vary- 
ing conditions. The basis may have been organic, but 
the finished product is psychic, and the means by which 
it is reached are concerned with mental rather than with 
physiological factors. By temperament a man may be 
a weak phlegmatic, but this natural disposition may by 
some intellectual passion be converted into a strong 
phlegmatic, or electrified into vivacity. He may be of 
an explosive disposition; but the pursuit of an ideal 
may necessitate constant control and equability, the 
explosive tendency may find itself pent up behind a 
triple wall of constraint and later of habit, until finally 
it grows weak and perishes from lack of function. 
For the educator to make good his claim as a moulder 
of character, it is, in the first place, necessary for him to 
show that ideas affect the direction of will; that the 
line taken by a certain quantity of mental energy is
-P-A-G-E-133
CHARACTER, METHOD, SUGGESTION 119 
determined by impulses, and that these in turn are partly 
conditioned by ideas. 
Acommon and a useful treatment of the will process is 
to distinguish between the two elements impulse and idea 
of end. When I act from impulse I tend to act blindly 
and instinctively ; there is no preperception of the finished 
act. In instinctive action the idea may be wholly 
wanting. The young bird swims automatically when 
placed in water for the first time: there has been no idea 
of end in his consciousness ; he simply reacts upon his 
conditions. Higher up in the scale it is difficult to 
isolate the impulsive element and consider it apart from 
the idea of end, because the two are usually found in 
close connexion; but it is easy to find an instance in 
which the idea of end is very little illuminated in the 
field of consciousness. The confirmed drinker whose 
hand finds its way automatically to a tumbler is little 
conscious of a guiding idea: his impulses have been 
developed by habit, until the smallest possible idea 
stimulus will excite them to action. At the next 
stage we have a well-marked fusion of impulse and idea, 
as when a lady’s charitable impulses are quickened by 
the sight of a poor man, almsgiving being the result ; 
while at the other end of the scale we may find the idea 
developed, but the impulse weak. Here the idea of 
almsgiving may be present to the mind, and the distress 
of the beggar may be thoroughly understood, but there 
is no charitable instinct, there is no impulse that can be 
galvanised into action, and the result is that no action 
follows. 
We have here three cases: the impulse that works 
almost instinctively as soon as the necessary situation 
and the smallest possible amount of idea stimulus are 
   
-P-A-G-E-134
120 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
present, the impulse that works normally when it fuses 
with a clearly realised idea, and the well-developed idea 
that fails altogether to issue in action because no 
impulse is there to make it an efficient motive. Unless 
the spontaneous tendency to action which we have 
called “impulse” be there, the idea is powerless, no 
matter how far it be developed or how vividly it may be 
present in consciousness. No matter how skilfully the 
evil effects of drink are demonstrated to a confirmed 
drunkard, his conduct is not in the least affected thereby. 
He understands the ideas presented to him ; he probably 
recognises their logical validity; but on his conduct 
they make no impression. There is no impulse for 
them to coalesce with, and thus they remain dead and 
inert. And yet not more dead or more inert than most 
of the ideas with which the mind of the average man 
is filled at the end of a period of average education. By 
far the greater part of the ideas that have been so 
carefully worked into his mental system find no echo 
in his prevailing impulses, and stand in scarcely any 
relation to his actions, 
From a certain standpoint a pupil may be looked 
upon as a parcel of impulses. Without this element, 
action of any kind, whether momentary or continuous, 
is not found; and the object of the educator is to 
introduce ideas in such a manner that they stimulate 
these impulses and bring them into action, Over the 
impulses themselves his control, if less direct and less 
easy, can still be effective. Undesirable impulses may 
be given no chance of functioning, and will therefore 
atrophy ; desirable impulses may be fostered, and the 
ideas that encourage them may be kept to the front. 
In cases where the exact nature of the impulses present   
-P-A-G-E-135
CHARACTER, METHOD, SUGGESTION 121 
is uncertain, a variety of stimulating ideas may be 
introduced, in the hope that one of them will meet with 
a response from among the spontaneous tendencies 
present. These impulses may be compared to a 
number of rifles lying loaded: they are silent and 
ineffective until the right idea is introduced and pulls 
the trigger. In the man who seems to know, but who 
is unaffected by his knowledge, some one of the 
conditions is lacking. Either the rifles are not loaded 
or the trigger mechanism is faulty, in other words, the 
impulses are absent or lacking in strength, or the right 
idea is not there to pull the trigger; or, even if there 
be an idea, and, viewed objectively, it seem to be the 
right one, there is something that renders it ineffective : 
for some reason or other it does not work, and dead 
knowledge is the result. The impulse is there, and the 
idea is right enough; but nothing happens, and we are 
driven to believe that the method of presenting has been 
faulty. 
Given these premisses, our problem is how to present 
ideas so that they really do vitalise impulses, and we are 
again brought back to the question of method. 
To the older writers on method the problem was a 
simple one. ‘There is in the world no rock or tower 
of such a height,” says Comenius, “that it cannot be 
scaled by any man (provided he lack not feet), if ladders 
are placed in the proper position or steps cut in the 
rock, made in the right place, and furnished with 
railings against the danger of falling over. It is true 
that very few scale the heights of wisdom, though many 
start gaily on the journey, and that those who get any 
distance do so at the cost of toil, loss of breath, 
weariness, and giddiness ; this, however, does not prove
-P-A-G-E-136
  122 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
that there is anything inaccessible to the human 
intellect, but only that the steps are not well disposed, 
or are insufficient, dangerous, and in bad repair—in 
other words, that the method is complicated. It is an 
undoubted fact that any man can attain any height 
that he may desire by means of steps that are properly 
disposed, sufficient in number, solid, and safe.” 1 
This is the method of grading and demonstration. 
It is one of the triad of essential methods. It is the 
first that every teacher must master. To demonstrate 
well, if not the whole of good teaching, is an absolutely 
necessary foundation. This is an art that cannot be 
acquired in a few months. To realise into what sections 
a subject is naturally divided, how many distinct stages 
or processes of thought are involved in mastering each 
of them, what are the difficulties involved, and for which 
types of mind they are particularly formidable; to un- 
fold a subject, chapter by chapter, during the term, 
avoiding unnecessary repetitions, and repeating the 
essential elements in a form that is ever fresh, so that 
tedium is avoided ; to show how a conclusion is reached 
from particular instances, and to illustrate a general 
position by concrete examples; to work over one’s 
subject from the teaching standpoint till the vital parts 
stand out in clear relief; to have in reserve a storehouse 
of illustrations and associations; to use this apparatus 
without any appearance of artificiality ; to develop the 
course of work genially, whimsically, humorously, so 
that at the end, brought together out of an apparently 
spontaneous and heterogeneous mass of detail, each 
part lies in its proper place, and the whole, properly 
arranged and understood, is in the pupil’s mind—all 
1 J. A. Comenius, Zhe Great Didactic, chap. xii. 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  
CHARACTER, METHOD, SUGGESTION 123 
this takes labour and time, the labour and the time that 
no teacher by conviction is likely to grudge. 
For conviction, however, some assurance is needed 
that the labour is fruitful, and it is not easy to be con- 
vinced that the very best demonstration of a system of 
ideas will insure that the hearer’s conduct shall be 
modified by it. Experience teaches that the reverse 
is often the case. The most painstaking and logical 
exposition of vegetarianism, of abstinence from alcohol, 
of a new social system, of a new or of an old religion, 
may compel our attention, may excite our admiration 
and convince our reason, but as far as action is con- 
cerned may leave us cold. We agree that alcohol is 
harmful, and order a fresh supply from the wine 
merchant ; the advantages of vegetarianism are evident, 
but as long as we have cash or credit we purchase meat. 
The method of demonstration has not solved our 
problem. 
The second method in the triad is heurism. Rousseau 
discovered it; so, apparently, did Prof. Armstrong. 
It is a simple method—as stated by its advocates. 
“Heuristic methods of teaching are methods which 
involve our placing students, as far as possible, in the 
attitude of the discoverer—methods which involve their 
finding out, instead of being merely told about things. 
It should not be necessary to justify such a policy in 
education. Unfortunately, however, our conceptions 
are blunted by early training—or, rather, by want of 
training. Few realise that neither is discovery limited 
to those who explore dark continents or Polar regions, 
nor to those who seek to unravel the wonders of Nature ; 
that invention is not confined to those who take out 
patents for new devices; but that, on the contrary,
-P-A-G-E-138
124 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
discovery and invention are divine prerogatives, in some 
degree granted to all—meet for daily usage; and that 
it is consequently of importance that we be taught the 
rules of the game of discovery and learn to play it 
skilfully. The value of mere knowledge is immensely 
overrated, and its possession overpraised and over- 
rewarded ; action, although appreciated when its effects 
are noted, is treated as the outcome of innate faculties, 
and the extent to which it can be developed by teaching 
scarcely considered.” ! 
This is the new policy, and it is forced upon us as 
a cure for all educational evils, and, in particular, ‘for 
the canker of dead knowledge, the knowledge that is 
never applied and that is not convincing enough to 
influence conduct. Armed with this new instrument, we 
are told, the teacher can insure that his pupils’ ideas 
are living and effective, a stimulus to action and an 
ever-present guide to conduct. So great is the 
enthusiasm of the modern heurist for his new play- 
thing, and so firm his conviction that the new method 
is absolute and of universal application, and, it must 
be confessed, so much good has already been done 
by the elements of virtue that it possesses, that it is 
legitimate to shrink from criticising it. We must, 
however, ask how far the method is possible, how 
far it can be used alone, and whether ideas gained 
through its means are necessarily living. For its 
validity as an exclusive method two conditions are 
necessary. The first is an inexhaustible fund of 
curiosity in children, and the second is infinite time. 
Many children are inquisitive, but they are particularly 
inquisitive about matters that are not pressed upon 
1 Armstrong, Teaching of Scientific Method, p. 236.
-P-A-G-E-139
CHARACTER, METHOD, SUGGESTION 125 
them as class work. The suggestion that the in- 
vestigational process shall be continued longer than 
is quite pleasant has been known to destroy the whole 
of that eager thirst for knowledge of which the heurist 
tells us. The fund of curiosity is limited, and not to be 
relied on: it may fail us at any moment. Neither is 
our second condition forthcoming, and, without it, the 
portion of material treated will be too small for any 
effective appreciation of the subject to result. As a 
matter of fact, all application of heuristic methods is 
carried out by means of a large admixture of demonstra- 
tion, and this alters the whole situation. Instead of a new 
method which can effectively be applied by any one, we 
have a new element which is useful in combination with 
other elements, but which needs in its user insight, 
experience, and many other qualities. 
That ideas which have been arrived at by our own 
efforts are more likely than others to take possession of 
us, that the impulse that leads us to discovery is likely 
in turn to be powerfully stimulated by the ideas which 
discovery gives, may at once be conceded ; but unaided 
heurism is impossible, and when we find it fused with 
demonstration we find also a third element present. 
Indeed, a critical examination of heurism is justified, 
because its supporters, by exalting it to be the leading 
principle in method, have completely overlooked a more 
important element, that of suggestion, while a sympa- 
thetic treatment of the arrogant claims put forward by 
the wild heurist is demanded by the great value for the 
promotion of suggestion of this element in the method 
complex. 
Method, then, as a whole comprises these three 
factors : demonstration, heurism, and suggestion, Their
-P-A-G-E-140
  126 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
proportions may vary, sometimes one, sometimes another, 
taking the lead; but in all teaching which is to be 
effective, and especially for the guidance of conduct, 
suggestion must be given its due place. The subjects 
that we teach are ethical, logical, or esthetic; their 
domain is the good, the true, or the beautiful, or they 
contain these elements in varying proportions. When 
we are dealing with a train of reasoning heurism is our 
surest method. In the elementary theory of arithmetic, 
for example, the pupil with a minimum of guidance can 
be made to do his own reasoning, and this holds good 
of experimental science, though to a smaller extent. In 
literary subjects, while heurism is by no means ruled out, 
demonstration and suggestion play a large part, and in 
all ethical teaching suggestion must be supreme. The 
whole art of the teacher consists in finding the exact 
blend of the three ingredients that will just suit his 
subject, his pupils, and himself. The conditions vary so 
much that the accuracy of the physician’s prescription is 
impossible: even the vague directions of the seventeenth- 
century cookery-book are forbidden. Each teacher 
must mix his colours on the spot. We can say only 
this, that in every case all the elements are needed. In 
the laboratory, where heurism is supposed to reign 
supreme, it is nevertheless necessary to demonstrate to 
the pupil how the apparatus is to be used, and to suggest 
to him that the experiment is interesting, and in every 
way a desirable one to carry out. 
What light does the method of suggestion throw on 
the problem of conduct and character? If the nature 
of the suggestive idea is as it has been represented, if an 
idea can be introduced in such a way as completely to} 
avoid the arousing of contrariant and critical ideas, and i
-P-A-G-E-141
  CHARACTER, METHOD, SUGGESTION 127 
it finds a system of living ideas in conjunction with 
selected impulses to work upon, its power to affect the 
direction of conduct can scarcely be denied; and if, 
further, the suggestive idea has been introduced when 
the mind is dominated by a strong effort of attention 
or conation, and remaining in a latent state is after- 
wards accepted as an auto-suggestion, we have here a 
constant source of guidance, a lever that turns the flood 
of mental energy into one channel, and by so doing 
inhibits activity in other directions ; we insure a constant 
depression of all the impulses that might oppose, and by 
degrees deprive them of their faculty of being vitalised 
by a suitable idea. Examples of such suggestive ideas 
have been already given in the cases of Frederick Myers 
and J. J. Rousseau.! 
It might be urged that this is not to affect character 
viewed as the small habits and tendencies, often of 
no great importance in themselves, that make up the 
sum of personality ; that the direction of energy may 
be altered, but that characteristics remain unchanged. 
We answer that this is indeed the case, and that the 
possibility of affecting outlook on serious matters, of 
inculcating principles and giving ideals of life, without at 
the same time interfering with the mass of peculiarities 
that make one person unlike another, is the very element 
that renders education desirable instead of the reverse. 
If it were true that character could be affected only by 
running all boys into the same mould, by rubbing off 
corners and eccentricities, by doing away with that differ- 
ence of potential which leads to progress, it might then 
safely be maintained that education would be desirable 
in inverse proportion to its influence on those subjected 
1 Vid. sup. p. 60. 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  128 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
to it, and that when it gripped it could produce nothing 
but dull mediocrities, creatures of habit brought up to 
walk along the straight path of a cramping social code, 
virtuous because possessed of too little initiative to kick 
over the traces, supplied with a moderately good taste 
because too inert to question the literary standard im- 
posed upon them. 
Such mediocrities might easily, would almost certainly, 
be produced by a course of interesting demonstrations 
given to a certain type of docile boys by a teacher 
sufficiently energetic to make them attend and submit 
to a rigid school-routine, and their production might not 
be avoided by such heuristic work as can be attained in 
school ; but they could scarcely be the result of a skilful 
combination of the three elements of method, with stress 
laid on the suggestion that produces auto-suggestion at 
a later date. Such teaching would not tend to rub off 
corners or to diminish eccentricities, but would turn a 
given character with the peculiarities and roughnesses 
characteristic of it to exploit its ruggedness in a desirable 
channel rather than in an undesirable one. 
Can education do more than this? Is it possible not 
merely to direct but actually in some sense to increase 
the disposable mental energy of an individual? This is 
a problem that must be attacked in the following chapter. 
For the present one thing may be considered as certain. | 
At any cost of trouble or of time the proper guiding 
ideas, the ideas that will produce interests, enthusiasms, 
and noble passions must be introduced, and in the right 
way. The phlegmatic boy who sits two-thirds of the 
way down the form, and who seems to oppose a passive 
resistance to all efforts to interest or arouse him, is the 
very boy who must on no account be neglected, If an

idea grips it will grip him surely ; its development may 
be slow, but it will be very certain, and once it has 
guided him into a certain path of conduct nothing will 
turn him from it. Sooner or later this boy of tardy 
development will be goaded into activity by the economic 
stress of life. A lower motive than those to which he 
has been exposed at school, the crudely utilitarian aim 
of the merchant or the stockbroker, will convert him into 
a strenuous and active man. He will be a person of 
substance when the clever, talkative, and suggestible 
boy at the top of the form is struggling to keep his head 
above water in a learned profession. It will be the 
fault of his teachers if he does not use the influence that 
wealth confers in the promotion of the intellectual and 
moral welfare of society.

  CHAPTER VIII 
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 
WE have seen that an idea by its suggestive force can 
determine the direction in which any mental powers 
shall be applied. Can education by the presenting of 
ideas or by any other means do more than this? Is it 
possible for it actually to increase the mental powers of 
the individual or of the community? The question has 
been answered with various degrees of optimism and of 
pessimism. ‘The importance of the law,” wrote Robert 
Owen in 1849, “that to educate man is to manufacture 
a character for him has never yet been fully appreciated 
by any nation, people, or individual in any period of 
man’s history except Lycurgus; and according to the 
machinery used for the purpose the character will be 
well or ill manufactured, and the individual will of 
necessity become inferior, mixed, or superior in his 
qualities. This principle being known, it becomes as 
easy to manufacture the Spartan character to-day as 
when Lycurgus lived, if there could now be utility in 
forming a character of high military spirit, and with 
great personal prowess and self-denial. But the time 
is now passing to require any mere sectional character 
which has now or previously been manufactured in any 
latitude or longitude. The period has arrived when the 
130
-P-A-G-E-145
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 131 
progress of knowledge demands a character, physical, 
mental, and moral, of full-formed rational men and 
women; and the machinery is now required to manu- 
facture from human nature this superior fabric, for the 
benefit of all who live and for future generations. . . . In 
short, to know scientifically how to manufacture the 
material of human nature—the most ductile of all 
materials—in its endless capacity for varied knowledge, 
goodness, and happiness, is to know how to change the 
present universal disorder, vice, crime, and misery into 
a terrestrial paradise ; in which the onward spirit of each 
inhabitant will be to prevent the existence of any form 
of evil.”? 
Could any proposal be more confident or rose- 
coloured? Character is to be manufactured to order— 
inferior, mixed, or superior, whichever you happen to 
want at the time. The Bengali peasant can be infused 
with the military spirit, and the Pathan can be imbued 
with a love for husbandry, according to the demand for 
soldiers or for farmers. It is true that the language in 
which the promises are made is very loose, and that 
there is no actual undertaking that the amount of 
mental energy will be increased ; but the writer evidently 
does not anticipate any limitations, and is prepared to 
guarantee anything to those who will help his educa- 
tional schemes, 
In matters of education we seem in this century to 
be less sanguine than in the last. ‘We talk of forming 
a character,” writes the President of Magdalen College, 
“or again, in somewhat ambiguous language, of licking 
a boy into shape, as though the teacher had absolute

Race ; or, the Coming Change from Irrationality to Rationality, 1849, p. 74.

control over an inert and plastic material. The metaphor 
of the shower and the flower is more apt than that of 
the potter and his clay, or of the she-bear of legend and 
her cubs. . . . The educator has not as much liberty as 
the gardener. . . . He must deal with his human seeds 
as he finds them. Taking them thus, education cannot 
produce any faculty that is not in the human being 
already. It may appear to do so, but this is only 
because of the marvellous complexity of human nature. 
The more simple, to use scientific terms, is its relation 
to the environment, the less possibility is there for 
education. But the human being is not a simple 
organism, but one infinitely complex, and the interacting 
play of its faculties is infinitely various.” ! 
This brings us down to earth with a thud. We can 
only teed the Pathan, drill him, and give him a gun; and 
in the same way we can only supply the peasant with 
food, drink, and a spade. There is no escape from the 
onslaught of the argument. While the enthusiastic (and 
probably inexperienced) schoolmaster is extracting the 
President of Magdalen’s bullet from his leg, Mr. Leighton 
gives him his quietus with a well-aimed shot. “No 
subject, no teaching, no plant or apparatus, however 
lavishly supplied, can create brain power, we can only 
save it from running to waste.” 2 
Now character can certainly be modified to some 
extent in its development, and brain power can certainly 
be saved from running to waste; the exact problem is 
to ascertain whether it is possible for education to

-P-A-G-E-147
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 133 
produce what is not already there potentially—whether 
“brain power,” or preferably “mental energy,” can in 
any sense be created. 
It is well to begin by realising that in one sense it 
is a truism to say that nothing can be produced which is 
not already present. Without materials construction is 
impossible. The clay vessel, the steam engine, the new 
chemical compound, the new flower formed by cross 
fertilisation, the variety of hound produced by careful 
breeding, all of these depend on the previous existence 
of raw clay, pig-iron, simple salts, and common varieties 
of flowers and of dogs. Even in the case of Mozart’s 
musical compositions the materials were there and only 
needed working up. Without the existing European 
scale and system of counterpoint Mozart’s peculiar 
temperament might have produced Chinese melodies or 
early Church music, but not the particular compositions 
that made him famous. The intervals and the keys 
that he used were the same as those employed by the 
contemporary composers of popular songs, just as the 
colours employed by Titian were the same as those 
used by the local sign-painter. But when we speak of 
creation, and the use of the word in connexion with 
esthetic production points to the real meaning of the 
term, we imply something more than the mere piling 
together of pre-existing elements ; we assume that some* 
meaning has been given to matter that previously 
possessed none, or that additional meaning has been 
given where comparatively little was to be found. To 
the engineer, to the merchant, to civilisation, the steam 
engine means more than do brute heaps of iron and of 
coal; to the housewife the earthen vessel means more 
than an unformed mass of clay ; to the musician one of 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
    134 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
Mozart’s symphonies means more than the same notes 
arranged in the scale of C major or as a music-hall ditty. 
If, therefore, it is true to say that each act of produc- 
tion is merely the rearrangement of existing materials, 
or even that each act of discovery is nothing but the 
combination and application of previous discoveries in 
the same field, it is equally true to say that each 
arrangement, if it has any end in view, if it is more than 
an idle destruction of previous combinations, is at the 
same time an act of creation in so far as it gives fresh 
meaning to the raw material used, and it may be that 
the teacher in manipulating and reorganising the mental 
elements and possibilities that he finds in his pupils is a 
creator in the truest sense. 
Before we consider more closely the nature of the 
mental elements that he finds to hand, it will be well to 
deal with one other standpoint from which the enemy can 
decry the teacher’s work. ‘There is now,” he will say, 
“no greater a supply of Shakespeares or of Newtons 
than before the dawn of modern education with its 
elementary schools and its provincial universities ; yet, 
if education had fulfilled the hopes of its promoters, 
men of surpassing talent ought to abound, whereas 
actually we find an increase among mediocrities of a 
certain standard and a relatively smaller number of 
outstanding personages.” Stated thus, the argument is 
not wholly true, nor, if it were true, is it in place here. 
The question at issue is whether or not the amount 
of mental energy in a nation or in an individual can be 
increased. The minds of Shakespeares and of Newtons 
are no doubt extremely energetic, but the appearance 
of such men on the scene implies a great deal more 
than energy. It involves a particular combination of
-P-A-G-E-149
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 135 
great energy of mind, of peculiarities of temperament, of 
accidents of upbringing, and of social conditions. The 
genius arises much as freaks arise in nature. Out of the 
greatest possible variety of combinations one particular 
combination is produced which just happens to fit the 
surroundings or the present needs, and the greater the 
number of the elements to be combined, the greater is 
the number of combinations and the greater the chances 
that the particular combination that we call genius may 
arise. The two essential factors are energy in the 
individual and in the community, and the varieties of 
temperament and of circumstance that may give it its 
peculiar productive quality. All that we can ask from 
or expect of education is that it shall increase the first 
factor and that it shall not diminish the second. If it can 
satisfy both these demands its claims on the community 
are absolute ; but these considerations must be postponed 
till later while we review the teacher’s materials. 
The ideas that occupy the field of consciousness form 
but a small part of our mental life, and any conception 
of mind that restricts it to the connexion of ideas and 
feelings that can be immediately observed is wholly 
inadequate. In psychology nothing is more baffling to 
the introspector than to find that most of the processes 
which he is anxious to observe and to explain, in terms 
of their connexion with one another, go on as it were 
behind the scenes, while only the finished product 
emerges on to the stage. All the details of stage 
management, all the manipulation and coaching of the 
actors, all the busy details of preparation are hidden 
from view, and have to be either dimly felt or laboriously 
inferred ; the doors of the workshop are tightly barred, 
and we are allowed to have first-hand acquaintance only 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  
  136 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
with the finished goods in the shop window. This is 
true of every department of psychic process. We 
commit to memory and store the ideas in the cellars of 
our mind, hoping that they will be preserved intact. 
While they are there we are debarred from following 
their fate, yet when we recall them they are seldom or 
never the same. Sometimes they have shrunk, some- 
times they have grown ; corners have been clipped, fresh 
elements have been added; we notice the result, of the 
process we can observe no part. 
I am in need of an idea; I know exactly the kind of 
idea that I want, I realise its empty form, the part that 
it must play in the completed structure, but I cannot 
hit upon it. What can I do? In one respect I am 
helpless. I cannot operate on the hidden springs; the 
mechanism and the levers that control it are concealed 
and unknown. But I know by experience that if I get 
into a certain attitude of mind, if I keep firmly before 
me my mental needs and group together what ideas I 
have, the required mental content may suddenly be shot 
up into my consciousness. Of the immediate conditions 
of its production we know nothing, and though we may 
conceal our ignorance by terminology, though we may 
say that the idea has been evolved by imagination or 
by association, these terms are merely convenient modes 
of stating our conviction that there is some mechanism 
—that ideas, like meteors, though they come out of the 
unknown, must have started from some given spot and 
under definite conditions. When our ideas are largely 
controlled by logical considerations, the influence of the 
subconscious is often obscured. If I solve a problem in 
geometry, and write the solution out at length, the 
whole idea sequence seems to have been present to
-P-A-G-E-151
     
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 137 
consciousness. Each element seems to be sufficiently 
conditioned by that which precedes it and by the goal 
of proof that is before me. But when the mind wanders 
unguided except by chance association, when in a 
daydream I pass from one idea to another, suddenly 
awakening to discover that I have travelled far from 
my starting-point, the subconsciousness generally has to 
be invoked somewhere to account for the links in the 
journey. In many cases, no doubt, I can say of the 
sequence of ideas that it is due to associations of con- 
tiguity which are easily accounted for: a was suggested 
by 4, & by ¢, ¢ by d, and so on; but then we reach an 
idea x which seems to have no connexion whatever with 
that which preceded it; the wires are hidden, they are 
below the threshold. I am looking at the sea when 
suddenly I find in consciousness the idea of a friend 
with whom I was once at school, and there seems to be 
no connexion between this and the idea of breakers 
which preceded. Yet I am driven to suppose that there 
was some connexion. I may once have been to the 
seaside with this friend, though I have now forgotten the 
fact; or there may be some subtle connexion between 
my feelings as I look at the sea and those that I once 
experienced in his society. Whatever the hypothetical 
connexion that I imagine may be, it is hidden from 
me, it is the work of my subconsciousness. 
Though the operations of the subconscious are always 
present, they do not force themselves upon the notice 
of those who lead a routine life, whose mental transac- 
tions consist in piecing together the percepts drawn from 
daily observation in order to reach a result that is 
already known, much as a child fits together the frag- 
ments of the picture puzzle that lie before him on the
-P-A-G-E-152
  138 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
table, and whose stock of ideas is so limited that no one 
of them is below consciousness for long at a time. It is 
with men of original and creative minds that its working 
is chiefly felt, often with startling force. “What, you 
ask,” writes Mozart to a friend, “is my method in writing 
and elaborating my large and lumbering things? I can, 
in fact, say nothing more about it than this: I do not 
myself know and can never find out. When I am in 
particularly good condition, perhaps riding in a carriage 
or on a walk after a good meal, and in a sleepless night, 
then the thoughts come to me with a rush and best of all. 
Whence and how-—that I do not know and cannot tell. 
Those which please me I retain in my head, and hum 
them perhaps also to myself—at least so others have 
told me. If I stick to it there soon come one after the 
other useful crumbs for the pie, according to counter- 
point, harmony of the different instruments, etc. That 
now inflames my soul, namely, if I am not disturbed. 
Then it goes on growing, and I keep on expanding and 
making it more distinct, and the thing, however long it 
be, becomes indeed almost finished in my head, so that I 
afterwards survey it at a glance like a goodly picture or 
a handsome man, and in my imagination do not hear it 
all in succession as it afterwards must be heard, but as a 
simultaneous whole. That indeed is a feast. All the 
finding and making goes on in me as in a very vivid 
dream.” ! 
The conception of the subconscious is necessary for 
the explanation of mental process; it is still more 
necessary for the explanation of conduct. I am con- 
scious that I have just acted in a manner which was 
1 Quoted by von Hartmann, Philosophy of the Unconscious, Eng. trans., 
vol, i. p. 279.
-P-A-G-E-153
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 139 
wholly opposed to my ultimate interests. I analyse the 
situation. Let us suppose that I played golf instead of 
attending to my business. When making up my mind 
I realised clearly that my presence was needed at my 
office. I knew that my health was excellent and that I 
could not plead this as an excuse; all the motives for 
playing golf when weighed proved insufficient, and I 
resigned myself reluctantly to the decision that I must 
work as usual. Yet shortly, without any further delibera- 
tion, I started for the golf-links. My conduct has been 
determined by something outside or just on the margin 
of consciousness, by the complex of ideas, feelings, and 
impulses that forms the background of all conscious life, 
and that are themselves but dimly realised, occasionally 
rising out of the depths where in some form or other 
they lie concealed, only to baffle us by disappearing 
when we try to scrutinise them and discover their true 
nature. These subconscious elements are the basis of 
character and condition conduct to a far greater extent 
than the view of life that we express and by which we 
believe that we are actuated. When we see the better 
but follow the worse the blame must be laid at the door 
of the subconsciousness. 
This subconsciousness, then, that plays such a part in 
conduct, must be organised or formed by the teacher who 
wishes ultimately to affect his pupil’s conduct, and we 
have to ask what exactly the subconsciousness is. The 
term is a convenient one, and has been used as a rag-bag 
into which to stuff everything that proves difficult of 
explanation. In what state is an idea preserved when 
it passes out of my consciousness? As I am able sub- 
sequently to recover it again, either it or the conditions 
that produce it must exist somewhere. For an answer 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  140 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
we naturally turn to those who first started us on the 
way of ideas, to the founders of the associationist school 
in England and in Germany; but Locke, though he 
realises that the ideas which through the medium of 
sense-perception find their way into the empty cabinet 
of our minds must exist somewhere, when through lack of 
room they have to make way for other ideas that crowd 
them out, is not very explicit as to the nature of the 
limbo in which they await the time for their reappearance. 
He hints, indeed, that the brain is concerned, or animal 
humours, but goes no further than a hint. Herbart, it is 
true, goes into much greater detail about the mechanism 
through which he supposed the expulsion and the re- 
instatement of ideas to take place. ‘“ We must,” he says, 
“explain the expression ‘threshold of consciousness,’ 
which we shall often have occasion to use. An idea is 
in consciousness in so far as it is not arrested, but is a 
true idea. It enters into consciousness when it just 
raises itself out of a condition of complete inhibition. 
In this case it is on the margin of consciousness,” ! 
When it is completely inhibited it is below this threshold, 
but like Locke, Herbart gives us no information about 
its exact nature when it is, so to say, an idea but yet not 
a presentation. 
A brief discussion of the relation of the mind 
to the nervous system may help towards a clear 
position. Although of recent years there has been 
forthcoming overwhelming evidence that mental life is 
conditioned by neural process, there has at the same 
time arisen a disposition even among physiological 
psychologists to look upon mind as essentially different 
from the nervous system that conditions it, and to 
1 J. F. Herbart, Lehrbuch der Psychologie, Sechste Auflage, 1900, p. 18. 
  
-P-A-G-E-155
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 141 
confess that the meaning of an idea and the physiological 
process that accompanies it are wholly disparate. The 
crude materialism of the middle of the nineteenth century, 
typically represented by a book like Biichner’s Kraft und 
Stoff, which was ready to maintain that consciousness 
is produced by the nervous system, is no longer in 
favour. Wundt, it is true, states that “wherever we 
observe the mental functions, they are accompanied by 
the processes of nutrition and reproduction”; and adds 
that, “on the other hand, the general phenomena of life 
may be manifested in cases where we have no reason for 
supposing the presence of a mind.”! He is, however, far 
from adopting the position that mind can be produced 
by the processes of nutrition and reproduction. 
If we puton one side the definitely materialistic 
position, and if it be granted that we find the mind and 
the nervous system existing together, two theories are 
possible as to their connexion. The first is the theory 
of psycho-physical parallelism. This simply states the 
fact that mental processes are accompanied by neural 
processes. It supposes a physical train of causation 
accompanied by a series of mental states each of which 
is sufficiently conditioned or explained by its pre- 
decessors. The latent idea is alluded to as a “dis- 
position,” a term which is intended to be a guarded one 
and to avoid the imputation of materialism. This view 
has powerful supporters, but its weak point is that it is 
too guarded and explains nothing. It is not denied that 
the mind and the nervous system are found in close con- 
nexion, and psycho-physical parallelism merely restates 
the position. 
The other and more intelligible view is the theory 
1 W. Wundt, Principles of Physiological Psychology, Eng. trans., vol. i. p. 27.
-P-A-G-E-156
    
142 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
of interaction. This assumes that mind and the nervous 
system are found in juxtaposition, that the nervous 
system can influence mind, and that mind in turn can 
influence the nervous system. It is claimed that this 
is on the whole a description of the facts as far as we 
can observe them; while to the objection that it is 
impossible to conceive how two such disparate entities 
as mind and matter can influence one another it is 
retorted (1) that though the concept of causation is 
borrowed from natural science, and though in natural 
science we find interaction of this kind only between 
fragments of matter, the concept was in the first place 
originated through the consciousness that by an exercise 
of the will we can ourselves move matter, and that 
therefore we are but making the full use of a concept 
whose extent for the purposes of convenience has been 
erroneously limited by physics. (2) That the causation 
of physical science is itself, like the causation of the 
interaction theory, unintelligible without a further 
metaphysical treatment. 
If we adopt the theory of interaction, how do we 
stand as regards the subconsciousness in which the 
remembered idea has in some form been stored? 
Unless we are careful we shall find that we return to 
the older and cruder materialistic position. A strong 
advocate of the interactionist view, Mr. M‘Dougall, 
maintains that the latent idea remains only as a trace in 
the nervous system. “If the ideas themselves,” he says, 
‘do not continue to exist in the interval between per- 
ception and representation, then those links which we 
call the association of ideas, and which are the essential 
conditions of the reproduction of the ideas of objects in 
an order determined by the order of their perception,
-P-A-G-E-157
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 143 
cannot be links between ideas, but must be links 
between the nervous dispositions that are the necessary 
conditions of the revival of ideas, and must themselves 
be nervous dispositions.” 
It is not easy to see how this differs from the 
materialistic position that is satisfied with regarding 
consciousness, or at any rate the content of conscious- 
ness, as produced by the nervous system. The whole 
basis of personality, in so far as this consists in the 
memory of past experiences and the reference of these 
to the same experiencing subject, is placed in the 
nervous system, and no loophole is left for the perma- 
nence of the person as an organised mind. The most 
obvious position to which the view leads is that of von 
Hartmann’s Unconscious Mind, which is impersonal, 
and uses as its instrument any neural system into 
contact with which it is brought, the results of experi- 
ence and latent ideas being deposited in the brain, and 
the mind itself being unable to remember and thus 
to become organised. 
This objection might not in itself be sufficient if 
logical consistency demanded that the subconsciousness 
should be solely physical. This, however, is not the 
case. If we start with ideas in consciousness and 
onditioned by brain, we have no right to assume that 
he idea when in the subconsciousness is detached 
ither from mind or from the nervous’ system. We are 
riven to suppose that the latent idea is present in a 
ubconscious mind, and that in this state it is conditioned 
y or connected with a physical disposition, as is the 
dea inconsciousness. The term “subconscious,” and not 
‘ unconscious,” has been used because it is necessary to

  144 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
suppose some consciousness remaining as a correlative 
to the neural trace, which we must conceive of as 
possessing the characteristics of neural life though not 
of full neural function. 
In what sense can we conceive of the latent idea as 
in consciousness? To do so it is necessary to realise 
that all consciousness is not self-consciousness. We are 
conscious of self when we definitely set ourselves to 
consider our own personalities, when we actually com- 
pare present with past experiences, and when we find it 
necessary to adjust our attention, as when we are 
attending to a percept on the margin of consciousness, 
or find our minds wandering during the process of 
attending, or when we reach the end of a process of 
conation and are switching our energies on to another 
track with another aim in view. In all these cases, 
except the actual attending to the concept of self, 
there are processes of adjustment involved, and it is 
on these occasions that the feeling of personality is most 
prominent. 
From this state of mind the consciousness that is 
not self-consciousness must be distinguished. When, 
in working out a problem or developing a conception, 
I become absolutely absorbed in the process—when 
ideas come readily—when there is no hitch, and the 
stream of thought flows steadily on,—on these occa- 
sions, which for most people come but seldom, I am 
oblivious of all around me, of my organic feelings, o: 
- my personality. My mind is, it is true, retentive, other- 
wise each link in the train of thought would not be| 
conditioned by what precedes, but I do not remembe 
in the narrower sense of the word. It is not until th 
end of the train of thought is reached that a sense of m    
       
                      
     
        
        
-P-A-G-E-159
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 148 
personality returns to me. Then, as I look back on the 
state of mind that is over, I am conscious that the 
ideas passed before me as if they were wholly out of 
my control. I seem to have been present at an act of 
thinking in which as a person I took no part, and 
of which at the moment I was but half-conscious. It 
is only when the train of conation comes to an end that 
I am fully conscious of what has been in my mind, and 
realise that, as the process was originated by me, it is 
mine and can be referred to my personality. 
Now imagine this state of absorption indefinitely 
prolonged. In that case the train of thought which 
is developing will not be realised, there will be no pause 
during which the self will rapidly review it and recognise 
it as its own before proceeding to the next stage. 
Imagine, further, that the train of thought is never 
brought to an end. In that case it will develop con- 
tinuously, unremembered, unrealised, unreferred to the 
self. It is in consciousness, but not in self-conscious- 
ness. If this state of consciousness is imagined as less 
intense, at a very low stage of activity and accompany- 
ing, not a developing train of thought, but a simple 
content of meaning which is thought and retained 
continuously, but is not remembered or realised, it is 
possible to have some idea of the condition of mind in 
which the latent idea is retained as a subconscious state, 
ready to be called up whenever it is needed, and to be 
linked on to the self-consciousness that is performing 
the work of readjustment to the environment of new 
impressions that ever crowd in from the outside world, 
even ready in conjunction with other latent ideas to split 
off as a separate system, and to emerge with a special 
pathological self-consciousness of its own, as in the

distressing cases of plural personality which have 
recently occupied the attention of psychologists. 
It is in this mind, at least, as much as in the modifi- 
cations of nervous tissue that we must believe experi- 
ences and meanings that have passed from consciousness 
to persist. Its presence allows us to believe in the 
development of personality as a psychic growth and 
organisation, and does not exclude the supposition that 
while the subconsciousness is normally to be found in 
connexion with a nervous system that has grown up 
with it, it may, in virtue of its organisation, as meaning 
continue to function and preserve the elements of its 
personal growth under other conditions or in connexion 
with a different system of suitable matter. From this 
standpoint every process of thought and every reasoned 
act helps to knit the self closer to the psychic system 
that it has itself organised, and those who attempt to 
train mental processes may thus hope to deepen the 
sense of personality at the same time that they widen 
the content of mind. 
We have, then, a series of mental states which, while 
they are generally found in combination, can each be 
imagined as existing separately. Self-consciousness, in 
which the mind is throughout aware of its existence as 
an entity which possesses permanence, and which assigns 
wishes and desires to itself, and not to other minds; 
consciousness, embodying retention and a continuous 
train of thought, which is not aware of itself, but which 
can be recalled and referred to the self; higher sub- 
consciousness, when ideas that have been on the margin 
of consciousness cannot directly be recalled, but have to 
be inferred from their effect upon our mental content 
or our feelings; and lower subconsciousness, which, in
-P-A-G-E-161
  EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 147 
spite of its remoteness, may yet influence the conscious 
mind, although until recalled to further some train of 
thought, that is to say, until it is wanted, it forms no 
part of our conscious life. 
Correlated with these states we are bound to imagine 
a neural system in different stages of activity. The 
neural system and the mind mutually condition one 
another. In the mind is stored the meanings that have 
been in our consciousness; in the nervous system is 
stored the neural dispositions that these meanings have 
produced when coming into existence in our minds, 
There are two avenues through which the educator 
can influence this combination of nervous tissue and of 
mind: he can drill the nervous system by habit, and he 
can change and enrich the mind content by introducing 
new meanings. The methods must often be employed 
together, but in their essence they are separate. One 
mark of a habit in nervous process is that it does not 
develop. You may train a dog to perform certain 
operations ; once they are learned they are invariable, 
they do not initiate a train of other processes. An 
animal will not combine two processes that he has 
learned to make a third. Lack of plasticity is the mark 
of nervous habit. It is through this very rigidity that 
complicated mental process is rendered possible, since it 
presupposes a number of subsidiary processes that have 
become automatic. A large portion of early education 
consists in giving habits. Boys must be taught to read, 
to write, to be punctual, to have a stock of traditional 
knowledge, and to use the conventional symbols.of daily 
social life; and of these acquisitions even those that 
imply knowledge are little removed from the plane of 
habit. It may be asked whether these latter should be
-P-A-G-E-162
148 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
  called habits of mind or habits of nervous structure. In 
so far as their rigidity is mechanical, and can be altered 
only by continued practice, they are habits of nerve; in 
so far as it depends on meaning and logical structure, 
and can be altered by the addition of fresh meaning, 
they are habits of mind. In many cases the term “ habit” 
is used loosely to cover both aspects. When I talk of a 
habit of attention, I mean in part that the neural system 
connected with the mind adjusts itself readily to stimuli, 
but I also imply that the mind possesses a large stock of 
meaning which is imposed upon the new ideas that are 
presented to it. This is a habit, and possesses rigidity 
only in the sense that the stock of meaning is always 
present. Otherwise its essential mark is that it is vari- 
able, that is to say, that the right meaning to suit circum- 
stances is continually brought to the front. 
The second method, then, of building up the subcon- 
sciousness is by introducing meaning. The essence of 
ideas or of systems of ideas is that they develop, that 
they are in a constant process of being fused and separ- 
ated, and that under the influence of purpose the ideas 
that are used to attain the end are constantly reformed 
and given fresh meaning by the new contexts in which 
they appear. Weare driven to believe that these con- 
tents of meaning have some connexion with the nervous 
system, but it is extremely difficult to imagine any com- 
bination of neurones and synapses that could be the 
physiological counterpart of a meaning, and we must 
content ourselves with saying that mental process at a 
low level, when its connexion with nervous process is 
intelligible, comes under the law of nervous habit, and 
that mental process at a higher level, whatever may be 
the nature of its physical counterpart, does not.
-P-A-G-E-163
  EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 149 
For the educator this distinction is of far-reaching 
importance. ‘Teaching of the conventional kind that 
trains nervous habit beyond the necessary degree of 
rigidity is to be dreaded in all educational development. 
The law of habit is so strong that it may well be believed 
that if the necessary steps were taken, and if education 
were carried out with the thoroughness that modern 
organisation will in the future provide, the educational 
mechanism might prove a powerful instrument for reduc- 
ing all minds to the same level of conventional knowledge 
and process ; that tradition and reverence for established 
custom of any kind, quite apart from its meaning for 
social or mental development, might become paramount, 
that initiative might be wholly checked, and the exam- 
ination-bred youth be turned out well groomed and 
drilled, but without the mental energy that is so essential 
for breaking new ground. We have an example of this 
in China, and other instances are not wanting nearer 
home. Under such conditions the only hope of progress 
would be in those boys, and, fortunately, there would 
always be a few who are too sturdy to submit to the 
habituation process, or who, coming of wealthy parents, 
are enabled to escape the close-grinding mill and grow 
up under freer conditions, who inherit dispositions to 
command rather than to obey, to reform what is given 
to them rather than to accept it blindly, and who at the 
same time do not succumb to the enervating influence 
of luxury in the home and the prospect of economic 
security in the future. 
The manner in which the premature ingraining of 
habits may stunt mental growth is well brought out by 
Mrs. Boole. “ Parents should form a clear idea what 
is the scientific condition of mind, ... they should
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
know in what consists the preparation for it. The 
typically scientific mind may be described as one which 
stands in a definite relation to As-Yet-Unknown— 
Truth, and especially to that portion of the As-Yet- 
Unknown which is just below the horizon of knowledge. 
In proportion as a mind is non-scientific the occurrence 
of an unfamiliar phenomenon stimulates it to form some 
immediate classification or judgment. A new statement 
is hailed at once as true or false ; a new fact is classified 
as good or bad, nice or nasty; an unfamiliar action as 
right or wrong, etc. In proportion as a mind is 
scientific, the occurrence of a new phenomenon tends to 
set it vibrating with a consciousness of coming revela- 
tion, and to start a certain cycle of mental attitudes, a 
cycle of the following kind: Homage, Attention, Observa- 
tion, Analysis, Antithesis, Synthesis, Contemplation, 
Effacement, Repose, Judgment, or Classification. The 
cycle varies in duration; each phase may occupy a 
few seconds, or many months or even years. But the 
tendency to fall into some such sequence as that above 
described at the touch of a new fact is what constitutes 
the essentially scientific condition.” + 
The training, on the other hand, in which habit has 
played too great a part leads to the hasty reference of 
new facts to conventional categories, whether they really 
fit them or not, and the automatism of the process by 
its rapidity prevents that suspension of judgment, that 
gradual feeling of the way, that readiness to adopt fresh 
modes of attack which are signs of the really active 
mind. ; 
This situation of mediocrity and stagnation, while 
quite possible as the product of a certain kind of training, 
1M. E. Boole, Preparation of the Child for Science, 1904, p. 15.
-P-A-G-E-165
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 151 
is none the less wholly unnecessary. Education need 
not be mechanical ; habit need not be unduly enforced ; 
convention need not be our guide ; the teacher can intro- 
duce meaning at every step; and when he introduces it 
by the suggestive method, especially when he can pro- 
duce auto-suggestion, he may feel assured that one 
suggestive idea, the result, perhaps, of a few moments’ 
labour on his part, may develop and produce a rich 
_ crop of conceptions which will systematise themselves, 
and slowly give rise to a habit of mind which is a habit 
only in name, because the relation of each part to the 
others is determined by meaning. 
In teaching of this kind lies safety for the future. 
How little this is realised may be seen in another quota- 
tion from Mr. Leighton. In making an estimate of the 
effect that schooling is likely to have on the pupil, he 
says: “If you reckon that a boy sleeps 63 hours of the 
week, spends 30 hours in school, and 12 more in pre- 
paration, these 42 hours of schooling only come to 40 
per cent of his waking hours in a week of full work; 
taking the whole year and allowing for vacations, the 40 
per cent sinks to 30, and every one knows that even the 
30 per cent is subject to enormous deductions under the 
heads of absence, and still more of inattention; but the 
70 per cent assigned to the forces other than schooling 
is liable to no deductions, unless it be for longer hours of 
sleep.” 
In other words, he would say, the influence of teaching 
is directly proportional to the percentage of the boy’s 
life that is subject to it. For that portion of education 
which consists of the drilling in mechanical habits this is 
probably true; indeed, it may be doubted whether, at 
1R. L. Leighton, The Boy and his School, p. 2. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
152 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
day schools at all events, the school routine can ever 
in this respect counterbalance the home surroundings if 
these exercise an adverse influence. But from the stand- 
point of suggestion nothing could be further from the 
truth. The length of school hours is largely a tradition 
from the days when boys were sent to school chiefly to 
keep them out of the way, and a little suggestive teach- 
ing may do far more to induce the pupil to give himself 
habits of a certain kind than the excessive drill which is 
cast off as irksome at the first opportunity. 
We may now return to our original question, and once 
more ask if the amount of mental energy can be 
increased, or if our efforts must be restricted to guidance. 
On the side of the schoolmaster’s work that is connected 
with drill and habit the physical law of the conservation 
of energy holds good. You cannot get more power out 
of any piece of mechanism than is either there to start 
with or is put into it from without. Drilling the young 
in habits consists largely in repression; one process is 
selected and is repeated until it becomes ingrained, to 
the exclusion of other processes. In the process of 
repression and selection there can be no increase of 
what was originally present. If I block up three water 
channels and divert all the water into a fourth, I do 
not increase the total volume of water; if in the same 
way I direct a number of streams of nervous energy 
into one channel, and allow them to wear a broad 
groove for themselves, the volume of nervous energy 
remains unchanged; its direction only is altered. In 
each case, however, an addition has been made: the 
arrangement may for certain purposes be more effective ; 
it has, in other words, been given additional meaning. 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
EDUCATION AS CREATIVE 153 
On the side of education that deals with meaning 
the law of conservation of energy does not apply. In 
matter energy is limited, in mind it is not. The 
conception of energy was first derived, like that of 
causation, from the feeling of energy within us, and it 
received its limitation in the field of physical science 
because such limitation proved desirable. Not that 
physical science can ever prove that no energy has been 
added to the total complex, it can only demand that 
the energy on one side of the equation shall equal that 
on the other; if energy were added to both sides in 
equal amounts it would be unnoticed. In mental 
processes the two sides of the equation cannot be equal, 
for the simple reason that the concept of equality does 
not apply. Mind cannot be measured, it can only be 
valued. A content of meaning has no quantity, but it 
has a value, and this value may be increased without 
limit by the proper development of the meaning. 
Meaning may be added to meaning, the fusion may be 
quite unlike its component parts and may have 
additional meaning, and consequently, for mental life 
may be of far greater value, and possess far more mental 
energy. When dealing with this side of the teaching 
process the schoolmaster has theoretically an unlimited 
scope. When he introduces meaning to his pupils he is 
building up within each of them a world of meaning, 
and in doing so he is not diminishing his own stock. 
Each new insight on the part of those taught is wholly 
to the good. Further, it is the nature of meaning that 
it may develop from within as well as from without, 
that by analysis of its own content fresh meaning is 
produced. Suggestive and auto-suggestive ideas have 
this power, and when they are present mental vitality
-P-A-G-E-168
  154 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
will be great. Consequently, if the teacher makes it his 
first aim to see that the subconsciousness of his pupils is 
a mind of meanings not always fully realised, but felt as 
desirable and ready at any moment to develop into 
auto-suggestions, he will be not only a director, but a 
creator of mind, a true producer of mental energy. 
Meanings of this kind, when they develop, do so on 
the lines of the personality to which they are attached, 
and tend to accentuate it. The developmentyof the 
suggestive idea can never be conventional ; its mode of 
operation defies analysis; it frequently disappoints 
expectation, and as often it astonishes by its rate of 
growth. With an increase in mental energy comes a 
differentiation between the personalities in whom it is 
manifested, whereas with a drilling of personalities to 
sameness is found a lessening of mental energy. Given 
a sufficient number of suggestive teachers, and a con- 
sequent differentiation of one personality from another 
among their pupils, the play of circumstances will see 
to it that the freaks whom we call men of genius are 
produced in increasing numbers. ‘

CHAPTER Ix 
SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 
IN previous chapters the relation between suggestion 
and the other great principles of method has been 
discussed, as well as the general conditions of the 
teaching, which, while not suggestive in the narrower 
sense of the word, is yet necessary as furnishing the 
mind with living ideas for suggestion to work upon. 
It remains to ask what are the school subjects that 
most readily lend themselves to be the medium of 
suggestion, and what are the methods of teaching that 
the principles of suggestion demand. 
In the early years of the last century, when the only 
subjects taught in our secondary schools were the 
Latin and Greek classics, with very occasionally a little 
mathematics, the question that has just been asked 
would have seemed meaningless to most schoolmasters. 
Even Arnold’s curriculum at Rugby in 1835, though 
in many respects far in advance of the school practice 
of the time, since it included French, geography, and 
some mathematics, in addition to the ordinary classical 
grind, omitted altogether such subjects as English 
literature and natural science. As the century 
progressed, under the influence of external pressure 
exercised by men of science like Huxley and of money 
155
-P-A-G-E-170
  156 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
grants from the Science and Art Department at South 
Kensington, and given additional force by the natural 
tendency of the struggling professional man to demand 
for his son an education that possibly might cultivate 
the income-earning capacity, natural science and an 
increased dose of mathematics found their way into the 
curriculum. The tendency towards encylopedism has 
steadily grown, and many headmasters who at first were 
hostile to the newer subjects, have ended by acquiescing 
in the existence of modern sides, though they seldom 
express much confidence in the cultural value of the 
instruction given in them. As result, in many schools 
the educational sack is filled to bursting, the solution is 
saturated, subject is piled upon subject with a complete 
disregard of the doctrine of diminishing returns, which 
comes into operation in education as in every other 
process, and at a much earlier stage than would be the 
case if only a few of the simpler maxims for the 
compounding of a curriculum were attended to. As 
soon as a boy has opened his books at the right places 
or got his instruments into working order, and is 
beginning to get interested in the subject, the end of 
the period of work is on him, a bell rings, there is a 
shuffling of feet, books and apparatus have to be thrust 
away, and five minutes later a different lesson in a 
different subject, which for the boy often has no con- 
nexion with the last, is under way. 
Most teachers and headmasters feel the congested 
state of the curriculum acutely. The tension becomes 
greater, and it is realised that something has to be given 
up. In many cases it is suggested that to clear out 
of the way the subject which has hitherto occupied 
most of the time, the Latin and Greek classics, is the
-P-A-G-E-171
  SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 157 
best means of giving room for expansion to the subjects 
that remain ; that if this Jonah be thrown overboard the 
pedagogic bark will be guided straight to its appointed 
haven with fair winds and an even keel, and all will be 
for the best in the best of all scholastic worlds. The 
distinguished author of From a College Window deplores 
that at the end of the school training in which he took 
an active part for twenty years, there used to depart 
“a slow river of cheerful and conventional boys, well 
dressed, well mannered, thoroughly nice, reasonable, 
sensible, and good-humoured creatures, but knowing 
next to nothing, without intellectual interests and, 
indeed, honestly despising them,” the result being that 
“intellectual cynicism was the note of the place”; and 
he thinks “that the solution is a very obvious one: it 
is at all costs to simplify and to relieve pressure. The 
staple of education should be French, easy mathematics, 
history, geography, and popular science. I would not 
even begin Latin or Greek at first.”1 Nothing is said 
about the methods of teaching these subjects, and we 
are asked to believe that in the hands of the same men, 
or of the same type of man, under whom “a great 
quantity of pedantic grammar was taught, and time 
was wasted in trying to make the boys compose in 
both Latin and Greek when they had no vocabulary 
and no knowledge of the languages,” and who thus 
seemed to have lacked the educator’s flazr for the 
elements that really matter, as well as the knowledge 
of method that is no substitute for insight and 
does not necessarily produce it, but which may 
develop it when it exists in germ, the newer curriculum 
would produce intellectual interests and intellectual 
1A, C. Benson, From a College Window, 1906, pp. 155, 156. 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
158 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
enthusiasm. It may be permitted to doubt this, and to 
believe that the newer subjects handled with the same 
lack of system and the same stupidity in selection that 
has sometimes characterised the teaching of the older 
ones, would produce just the same dreary tone and 
distaste for knowledge that is deplored in the finished 
products of such instruction. Are there no historical, 
geographical, and French pedants? Or is it likely that 
they will not be produced if they have to prepare their 
pupils for the numerous examinations that spread their 
nets for the middle class, and even for the upper class 
schools, examinations which appear to take but scant 
notice of the newer and more fruitful methods that 
are daily being suggested and demanded, and which 
wind their paralysing tentacles round the young 
enthusiast who wishes to work out his own methods 
on scientific principles ? 
Whatever may have been the faults of the older type 
of teacher (and, it may be added, of the rigid examina- 
tion), he had one good quality that must be placed to 
his credit. He made his pupils work hard at subjects 
that they did not like. No one now believes that the 
chief object of sending children to school is to teach 
them to suffer injustice and to endure ennui; but we 
may from every point of view question the value of 
an education that does not habituate those subjected to 
it to bring to completion tasks which they dislike, 
and to concentrate themselves on subjects that do not 
appeal to them. From the newer subjects, apparently, 
the salt of drudgery which would season the boy for the 
drearier situations that life presents may be altogether 
omitted. “Why,” says Professor Armstrong in an 
address to the British Association, “ should there be any 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  
SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 159 
set lessons in subjects such as history and geography? 
Nothing is worse, more stereotyped, more cramping to 
the intellect, than the set lesson of so many lines or 
pages of a sort of Liebig’s Essence of information, with 
attendant obligation of committing the facts recorded 
in them to memory. The child, like the restive, high- 
mettled young steed, wants to be off and away—not to 
be held severely in hand. Why should not the method 
by which we get up a subject in later life be followed in 
schools? At least it should be properly tried. Let us 
give freedom to children, and at least during early years 
lead them to read hard and wisely ; they will do so 
gladly.”! If they do so gladly, there is at least some 
result, if there is no discipline ; but what if they do not? 
Concurrently with the tendency towards encyclo- 
pedism, a tendency towards classification has marked 
the intellectual progress of recent years. 
When scientific studies first came into prominence in 
the latter half of the nineteenth century, they found the 
field occupied, it is true, by the humanities, but not 
mapped out as in the possession of a number of 
organised subjects, well equipped with rigorous methods, 
which could claim to be real training-schools of reason 
and perseverance. The classics undoubtedly afforded 
abundant opportunities for diligence and thought, but the 
methods employed in teaching them were often faulty, 
while the other subjects usually classed as humanities— 
history, English literature, and geography—were either 
not taught at all or were taught on no method. There 
was, therefore, some validity in the claims of natural 
science that through its means for the first time the 
1H. E. Armstrong, Ph.D., F.R.S., The Teaching of Scientific Method, 
1903, p. 85. 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
    160 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
principles of observation, classification, and inductive 
reasoning would be taught in schools, The situation 
did not long remain unchanged. Partly owing to the 
increased interest taken in the humanities, partly to the 
stimulus that natural science had given to the concep- 
tion of method, and partly to the rise of scientific 
psychology, the view rapidly gained ground that human 
life and thought give as much scope as physical nature 
for accurate investigation and rigorous method, while as 
a result of this tendency we have to-day on the one 
hand the physical sciences and mathematics with their 
paraphernalia of methods and techniques, and on the 
other the sciences of human nature: sociology, economics, 
geography, and history, with their new apparatus for the 
investigation and establishing of fact. 
On each side, therefore, we have subjects of instruc- 
tion which admit of organisation, and in which a 
technique could be devised which might be compared with 
that of the classics when well taught, and which would be 
far more rigorous than that of the classics when badly 
taught. Natural science can no longer claim to be 
the only subject that teaches observation, hypothetical 
reasoning, inductive working, and the manipulation of 
experimental problems ; it can certainly claim to provide 
these advantages, but not toa greater extent than the 
humanities, and, it must be added, in a subject-matter 
which deals with a side of life far more remote from the 
daily experience of the ordinary citizen than are the 
conceptions of conduct and motive that the humanistic 
teaching can supply. 
It is not denied that some moral ideas can be intro- 
duced through the medium of natural science. The 
conceptions of exactitude and truth can be given by
-P-A-G-E-175
  
SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 161 
. 
mathematics and science, and these subjects, quite apart 
from all questions of practical utility, could never be 
omitted from the curriculum, because they illustrate a 
particular kind of exactitude and a particular aspect of 
truth. It is because they involve the elements of truth 
and exactitude that the humanistic subjects can be 
made as profitable as the scientific ones, and it is because 
their subject-matter is of greater importance to the life 
of conduct and of action that greater prominence must 
be given to them. For the subjects through which 
moral ideas can be introduced are primarily the 
humanistic: history, literature, and geography. It 
is in connexion with these that ideals of conduct and 
suggestive human situations are to be found, and if 
suggestion is to be indirect, the first necessity in such 
humanistic subjects is that they shall possess a strong 
technique of their own, that they shall lend themselves 
to problem work, that in the process of instruction the 
pupil shall have his work to do as well as the teacher, 
and that the pupil’s part shall, if anything, be harder 
and involve more reasoning than the teacher's. All 
these elements are necessary, and all these history, at 
any rate, supplies, if taught in the right way. 
If, however, it is used, as the followers of Herbart 
would use it, solely for the sake of giving examples of 
conduct, it may fail lamentably in this direction. The 
too constant pressing upon a boy of examples of con- 
duct, or the sententious handling of episodes, is certain 
to arouse suspicion in his mind. In fact, the whole 
doctrine of influence by suggestion is wholly at variance 
with the principles that underlie what the school of 
Herbart calls character-forming instruction (Gesinnungs- 
Unterricht). “Character-forming instruction is that 
al 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  162 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
instruction which has as its aim the production of 
character in the young ; the awaking, grounding, training 
of the religious and moral will, at least in its beginnings ; 
the inducement to recognise and imitate examples of 
religion and morality, and the furthering of the first 
developments of faith and morality. These aims are 
the essential, necessary signs of character-forming in- 
struction. They are to be found above all in religious 
and historical instruction. Both of these are, above all, 
character-forming subjects. No other subject has like 
them the professed aim of promoting a religious and 
good character.” ! 
The aim “to recognise and imitate examples of 
religion and morality ” is not peculiar to the Herbartians, 
and is not objected to by other schools of educational 
thought. Neither can exception be taken to the state- 
ment that historical instruction is the medium through 
which examples of morality and ideas that deal with 
conduct and with society can most readily be presented 
to the young. It is the method that seems inadequate, 
and indeed mischievous. “Character-forming instruc- 
tion arises out of deep-seated, immediate experiences 
of feeling.”? It is true that the feeling must not 
be too strong. The emotional dissociation that has 
been objected to in direct suggestion is deprecated. 
“ Character-forming instruction rejects all religious and 
ethical instruction through the emotions. It sees in 
violent shocks to the feelings, in agitation, in excess of 
feeling, nothing but hindrances to a firm and sincere 
religious and ethical direction of the will.” The 
“immediate experience of feeling” is thus to be a mild 
1 Rein's Encyclopaedisches Handbuch der Paedagogik, Art. ‘‘ Gesinnungs- 
Unterricht,” 2 [bid, 3 (bid,
-P-A-G-E-177
  SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS _ 163 
one; and we may ask the question whether this mild 
feeling will be sufficient to counteract the very consider- 
able feeling of contrariance that the average boy ex- 
periences when assaults are made upon his moral 
standards. There may perhaps be something peculiar 
in the method by which this gentle feeling that will 
repel contrariance is brought about, and we might 
reasonably expect, in conformity with the Herbartian 
intellectualistic position, according to which feeling arises 
out of the interplay of ideas, that stress might be laid 
on intellectual effort in this connexion. Unfortunately 
the modern Herbartian has not got the educational 
insight of his master, and hampers himself with an 
obsolete psychology. To our surprise we find that 
“The method of character-forming instruction is wholly 
different from the method of the natural sciences, as 
different as the ethical from the theoretical mode of 
treatment, as different as knowledge is from faith, as 
ethical insight is from the concepts of the understanding. 
It is therefore an error to place character-forming in- 
struction under the yoke of the inductive method.”! 
To the question what the exact method is to be, 
if it is not to be inductive (and presumably a deductive 
method is equally excluded), the answer is given by a 
recent writer, Dr. F. H. Hayward. It apparently con- 
sists in simply placing before the young examples of 
conduct, and it seems to be taken for granted that the 
gentle “experience of feeling” will result. “How 
immensely important, then, is the work of presenting to 
mankind—and especially to the scholars of our schools 
—the inspiring biographies which history has to offer.

  Such biographies, presented in an historical setting and 
preceded by fairy tales, constitute the ‘Gesinnungs- 
Stoff’ of the Zillerians, the materials for ‘Gesinnungs- 
Unterricht’—character-forming instruction. In such 
material must be included, of course, the priceless 
biographies with which the Bible can suitably provide 
the school; unless such material, biblical, national, and 
cosmopolitan, is presented in rich abundance to the 
youth of England, we must expect well-nigh with 
astronomical certainty that the youth of England will 
grow up barbarous, uncultured, and immoral.”! That 
concrete examples of conduct should be “ presented” to 
the young, few will be found to deny; but neither will 
any candid teacher of experience deny that in the great 
majority of cases the presentation is without any effect 
on character. 
The method of presentation is the important matter, 
and for the Herbartian this is briefly to see that the 
receiving mind has in it the ideas necessary for an 
understanding of what is to come, and then to display 
the new conception to its admiring gaze. “ Education 
. can give moral instruction, arraying in its service 
historical and biblical examples, and pointing to their 
moral import; this at present it does imperfectly.” ? 
The method, apparently, is to bring together examples of 
moral conduct, and to “point out” their import. It is 
easy enough to do this; to give moral instruction on 
these terms is child’s play ; but if there is any validity 
in the doctrine of reaction and contrariance, such in- 
struction may be as futile as it is easy. Dr. Hayward 
is probably correct when he says: “ It is doubtful whether 
any idea or maxim or exhortation, however abstract, is

SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS | 165 
entirely ineffective in building up the structure of 
morality”; but only on the condition that the term 
“morality” is interpreted as meaning the attitude 
towards conduct as conditioned by the whole after 
effects of such exhortations, including all the reactions 
set up by the moral truths to which the finger of 
Education “ points,” reactions which may well hurry off 
the learner in a direction widely different from that 
intended by the Herbartian. It is scarcely an exaggera- 
tion to say that the missionary cause could have found 
no surer method of alienating schoolboy sympathy than 
the countless sermons and addresses in school chapels 
that it has organised. Even if the Herbartian premisses 
were granted, and if this presentation of instances 
produced a gentle feeling of sympathy (and it is not for 
a moment admitted that feelings spring from intellectual 
ideas, though they may, of course, accompany them), a 
gentle feeling is not enough to stem contrariance ; for 
this the deeper emotions that stir human nature to its 
depths are necessary, but their production is not always 
desirable, and indeed with most teachers is not possible. 
As concrete examples two extracts may be given 
from F. J. Gould’s The Children’s Book of Moral Lessons, 
those illustrating Temperance and Courage:—“In ancient 
times there dwelt in Greece a famous people called the 
Spartans. They were a very temperate nation, though, 
like John. Howard, they were more strict than most 
people need to be. The boys were taught to labour, to 
drill, to fight, and to endure hardships; and they slept 
on beds made of reeds which they had cut with knives 
on the banks of the river; but in winter they were 
allowed to strew thistledown on the beds, to make them 
softer and warmer. The houses of the Spartans were 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
    166 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
built of plain logs of wood, hewn only by the axe; and 
the doors were simply cut by the saw, and had no 
ornament; the beds, tables, and other furniture were of 
the simplest character. The money they used was but 
iron coins. Lest they should become idle by resting on 
couches at home, or feasting too richly, it was ordered that 
all men should eat their meals . . . at the public tables, 
about fifteen persons sitting at each board. In these 
ways, and by sports and long exercises, the Spartans 
were prepared for war, and they advanced to battle 
without flinching, and would die rather than yield toa 
foe. . . . Thus you see the temperate Spartans were very 
BRAVE. And you boys and girls also wish to be brave, 
though not with that bravery which aims only at 
shedding.blood. They are brave men who face the fire 
of burning houses, who toil on the sea, who labour in 
mines and quarries and docks—ah, yes, all men and 
women can be brave in bearing pain, in doing the daily 
work, in saying right words, in resisting what is unjust. 
And to be brave we need the noble temper: we must 
be TEMPERATE.” ! 
Or again on Courage. “Let us look closely at the 
word ‘courage.’ Some of you perhaps learn French, If 
I take away the syllable age, what will remain? The 
syllable cour. Suppose, now, I write on the blackboard 
this syllable, with the addition of the letter ¢. Here 
we have the word caur, and cwur means heart. You 
remember the famous English king who wielded the 
heavy battle-axe against the Saracens in the Holy Land. 
His very name made the people fear; and when a 
Saracen’s horse started nervously, his rider would say : 
‘What, dost thou think thou seest King Richard behind 
1 Op. cit. p. 55.
-P-A-G-E-181
SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 167 
that bush?’ This brave Richard was known as Coeur 
de Lion, or Lion Heart, for he had the heart or courage 
of a lion. You know the African mothers have a 
curious idea about the wonderful power of the lion’s 
heart ; and when the father has slain a lion in the chase 
he brings the heart of the fierce beast to the mother, and 
she cooks it and gives some to her boys to eat. As 
they eat she thinks the courage of the king of the desert 
enters into the breast of her sons.” Various stories 
follow giving examples of different kinds of courage. 
To the subject-matter of this teaching no ex- 
ception need be taken. It is good to give boys 
examples of conduct, it is good to teach them the 
meanings of words denoting modes of action, it is right 
to make them discriminate between cognate virtues ; 
but it is necessary to realise that these are ideas about 
morality and not moral ideas, not the ideas that will 
of necessity themselves take concrete form as moral 
actions. Mr. Gould in his preface states that the book 
is intended for children aged from ten to fourteen years, 
and hints that for older children different language, but 
not a different method, is needed. Yet for many boys 
who fall far short of fourteen years the very title, Book of 
Moral Lessons, would be sufficient to bring up the resolve 
that under no circumstances would any of the moral 
apophthegms therein contained be permitted to touch 
the springs of action. The anecdotes, however, apart 
from the moral exhortation that accompanies them, 
are attractive, and with very young children might find 
favour. 
For the treatment of similar topics in a purely didactic 
and abstract manner there is, pace Dr. Hayward, nothing 
to be said. Witness the teaching of temperate habits 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  168 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
in a French manual of moral instruction :—“I told you 
yesterday what hygiene recommends. To-day I want 
to tell you what it forbids. Hygiene forbids several 
things: the abuse of drink, the abuse of tobacco, 
excesses at table and elsewhere. _ Wine, and even 
spirits, taken in moderate doses are a useful stimulant 
for men who work hard. As soon as they are abused 
they injure the mind. Further, as bad habits grow 
quickly, it does not take long to produce a drunkard, 
that is to say, a wretch who is no longer his own 
master, enfeebled in body and mind, liable to attacks 
of madness, dangerous to himself and to others, 
and often destined to end by succumbing to a terrible 
malady, delirium tremens. Those who have it suffer 
from delirium, during which dreadful visions pass before 
their eyes, their whole body trembles and degenerates ; 
finally, when they are saturated with alcohol, it sometimes 
happens that they catch fire, when smoking a pipe, for 
instance. Then the whole body burns in a few hours, 
and the suffering is great. This is called spontaneous 
combustion. All excess is unworthy of aman. Manas 
a reasonable being must hold himself above it; and 
reason is the faculty of controlling and moderating one’s 
conduct.” ! 
The writer does not believe that this exposition 
of drunkenness would have awakened in him as a boy 
the zeal of the temperance reformer; in fact, he has a 
distinct recollection that the phenomenon of spon- 
taneous combustion, as. depicted in one of Captain 
Marryat’s novels, inspired him with no disgust, but 
struck him rather as being an attractive incident. If 
there is any real tendency to drink, or if the boy’s

surroundings are likely to lead him astray, it is not 
likely that this treatment of the drink question will 
act as a deterrent; and the pictorial illustration which 
accompanies it, and which is here reproduced, does not 
help matters. Systematic lessons in hygiene or in elemen- 
tary physiology may or may not be desirable ; but it can 
be productive of no good to place before boys moral

apophthegms thinly disguised by an anecdotal or hygienic 
dress. If the lessons in hygiene are made hard or 
systematic enough, if the physiology is taught on sound 
and investigational lines, suggestions as to conduct may be 
made in this connexion ; but the one thing necessary is 
that there shall be a rigorous method, and that the boys’ 
attention shall be diverted from the moral undercurrent.
-P-A-G-E-184
  170 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
For suggestion, let it once more be repeated, it is not 
sufficient to have a sympathetic manner, an enthusiasm 
for the subject taught, and a happy knack of hitting upon 
the aspects of it that are likely to interest boys. The 
teacher who has these qualities is thrice fortunate. He 
possesses naturally what cannot be bought for gold or 
acquired by taking thought. But if in the confidence 
arising from his own gifts he pays no attention to the 
systematic handling of his subject, and hopes to be 
suggestive by habitual geniality or occasional fervour, 
he may easily miss the mark altogether. If the subject 
be history, it must, first and foremost, be taught in 
accordance with its own scientific technique. The pupil 
must be made to trace the connexion between cause 
and effect ; to interpret, abstract, and compare extracts 
from contemporary authorities; to contrast character 
with character, and to make up his mind to what extent 
circumstances produced one character, while another 
practically decided the sequence of events and is the 
key to the whole political situation ; to draw inferences 
from data and to estimate the value of evidence ; and to 
realise that there are certain simple criteria by means 
of which the accuracy of a statement in history may be 
tested. He must be so much occupied with these 
matters that the moral and social teaching discreetly 
given by a reticent master will produce no contrariance. 
He must be lectured to very little, but questioned a 
great deal ; he must never be allowed to take the short 
cut to a premature conclusion, when the longer way 
with its obstacles and pitfalls of conflicting opinion is 
possible. He must be enticed, urged, or even driven, 
if need be, to wring out of a document every atom of 
pertinent information that it may contain. The subject
-P-A-G-E-185
  SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 171 
must be mapped out for him in problem form suited to 
his years, and through this systematic series of exercises 
he must cut his path, ever feeling from day to day that 
his control over his subject-matter and over the instru- 
ments that are placed in his hands is increasing. 
Against such a background of strenuous and thought- 
compelling routine suggestions may be given, and given 
with success; and in connexion with a well-organised 
subject that commands the boy’s respect owing to its 
difficulty they are likely to be far more effective than 
are those given when the subject is a soft option. It is 
their strong and definite technique that gives the Latin 
and Greek classics, when properly taught, their pre- 
eminent value as suggestive subjects, and renders 
peculiarly effective the history taught through their 
medium. It is because their strength in this respect 
is not realised that the movement to oust them from 
our schools has gained support. The boy has plenty 
of work to do: he has to know his paradigms, his lists 
of words; he has to apply his syntactical rules, and to 
see that his translation passes muster in class. All 
this leaves no room for suspicion that an attack can 
be made on his code of morals, his sentiments, or his 
ideals. Yet how fruitful classical teaching can be in 
this direction only the experienced classical teacher 
can know. The secret is that the contrariant ideas 
are quite dormant—even sententious disquisitions are 
hailed as a godsend by a boy whose one dread is that 
his turn may come and his ignorance be exposed. 
“There is hardly any prose in Latin fit for boys to 
read,” says Mr. Benson. “Cicero is diffuse, and often 
affords little more than small-talk on abstract topics ; 
Tacitus a brilliant but affected prosateur ; Caesar a dull 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  172 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION | | 
and uninspiring author.” The last statement, at any 
rate, may be contradicted with safety. Given the 
proper conditions and methods, Cesar can be made 
as interesting and as inspiring as any other author that 
' is likely to be prescribed for class-room work. (For it 
is useless to disguise the fact that the boy, if left to 
make his own choice unrestrained, would probably 
prefer Henty.) Let all the school editions of special 
books of the Gallic War be burned by the common 
hangman, they exist only to swell publishers’ profits 
and advertise their editors. Let the boys have in their 
hands the complete unannotated text of the Gallic War, 
and let them at some time read the translation of 
Plutarch’s Life of Cesar ; \et the class-room be provided 
with an efficient wall map of modern Europe, and let 
there be also a few sections of the Ordnance Survey map 
to illustrate strategic points, such as Casar’s march 
through the Burgundian gate to repulse Ariovistus, so 
that the campaign may not take place in a No Man’s 
Land. Further, let the teacher be provided with a 
first-rate book of reference, such as Holmes’s Cesar’s 
Conquest of Gaul, with a proper knowledge of his 
business as a teacher, and with an adequate stock of 
common-sense, and let the work be read as a whole, 
not inaccurately, but with a right selection of the 
important episodes, and an understanding of the parts 
omitted, so that the campaign and its importance may 
be realised. 
Under these conditions there is no difficulty in 
interesting the class, in giving them abundance of hard 
and problematic work of every kind, and of making 
moral suggestions upon this basis of effort.

If Temperance be in question the teacher has the 
following opportunities :—Book ii. ch. 15: “The Nervii 
touched their borders ; on inquiring about their character 
and customs, Cesar ascertained the following facts: that 
merchants had no access to them; they suffered nothing 
in the way of wine or of other things tending to luxury 
to be imported, because they considered that by these 
means their spirits were unmanned and courage relaxed; 
they were savages and very brave; they railed at and 
upbraided the rest of the Belgz for having surrendered 
themselves to the Roman people and cast aside their 
hereditary valour; they positively declared they would 
neither send ambassadors nor accept terms of peace.” 
Book iv. chs. 1-2: “The Suebi do not live much on corn, 
but for the most part on milk and cattle, and are much 
engaged in hunting; this fact, owing to their kind of 
food and their daily exercise and the freedom of their 
life . . . not only fosters their strength, but also makes 
them men of huge bodily stature. . . . They do not 
allow wine to be imported to themselves at all, because 
they think that thereby the minds of men are softened 
and effeminated for enduring labour.” Book vi. ch. 21: 
“ The whole life of the Germans consists in hunting and 
in the pursuits of war ; from their childhood they devote 
themselves to toil and hardihood. Those who are 
slowest to outgrow their boyhood receive the greatest 
praise among their friends ; they think that this fosters 
growth and fosters strength and sinews. To indulge 
in sensuous pleasure below twenty years of age they 
regard as the deepest disgrace.” Ch. 24: “There was 
a time in former days when the Gauls surpassed the 
Germans in valour, invaded them unprovoked, and, 
owing to pressure of population and want of land, sent
-P-A-G-E-188
  174 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
colonies across the Rhine. . . . Now also the Germans 
continue in the same state of need and endurance, living 
and dressing as of old; whereas the Gauls, owing to the 
neighbourhood of the Province and their knowledge of 
transmarine products, have ample additions to their 
wealth and conveniences; having been gradually ac- 
customed to be overcome, and having been vanquished 
in many battles, they do not even put themselves on a 
level with them in valour.” | 
He would be a stupid teacher who could not make 
suggestions of a valuable character when reading these 
passages, who could not give his pupils others of a like 
kind in classical literature, and, what is more, suggest 
some exercise or problem to be worked out in connexion 
with them. If courage be the virtue to be illustrated, 
instances are to hand in numbers. There are, firstly, 
the cases of envoys sent at the risk of their lives, 
Book i. ch. 47: “Caesar considered that it would be 
very dangerous to send one of his own officers as 
ambassador, and expose him to savages. The best 
course seemed to be to send to him Gaius Valerius 
Procillus, a young man of great merit and of the 
highest culture, both on account of his fidelity and 
his knowledge of the Gallic language.” The danger 
incurred by this envoy is given in his report after his 
rescue. Ch. 53: “He said that they had drawn lots 
three times in his presence as to whether he should be 
burned to death on the spot or reserved for another 
occasion.” Book iv. ch. 12: The bravery of Piso, who 
rescued his brother in battle at the cost of his own 
life. Ch. 25: The bravery of the standard-bearer of 
the tenth legion, who jumped overboard at the landing 
in Britain, and led on the hesitating soldiers, The
-P-A-G-E-189
SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 175 
bravery of the two centurions mentioned in Book v. 
ch. 44, who “kept up an incessant dispute with one 
another as to precedence, and every year contended in 
rivalry for the first places,” and who, under stress of 
this competition, performed remarkable feats of valour. 
All these instances can be compared, the attention of 
the class being largely given to the linguistic involved, 
and in addition the boys can be asked to analyse the 
motives for bravery in each case, to compare them and 
appraise them. 
If truth be the virtue to be inculcated, there is 
abundance of opportunity for estimating Czesar’s veracity 
as a historian and accuracy as a geographer. The 
various episodes which he might naturally be suspected 
of wishing to conceal or to misrepresent may be taken, 
and it may be shown that on some occasions, at any rate, 
when he has an opportunity of glozing over a disgraceful 
defeat, he seems to go out of his way to give the 
exact details. Witness Book iv. ch. 12, where he has 
no hesitation in relating how the Germans with only 800 
horsemen inflicted a crushing defeat on 5000 of the 
Roman cavalry. His accuracy as a geographer can 
easily be considered while reading his account of the 
Meuse and the Vosges in ch. 10 of the same book. 
Caesars Gallic War has been taken as an illustration 
for the very reason that it is not the book which first 
enters into the mind of one who has had a classical 
education when he attempts to sum up either the interest 
or the moral training that he gleaned from the classics. 
If these elements are to be found in the author whom 
most of us look back to as supplying some of the 
dreariest experiences of our youth, how much more 
abundant are they in, say, Plato’s Phaedo or Apology.  
-P-A-G-E-190
176 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
It is difficult to think of any literature that gives similar 
opportunities for introducing a boy to serious thought 
on great subjects, and that enables this to be done 
incidentally, without an atmosphere of prigzishness, 
and in company with the feeling-tone that results 
from strenuous effort and rigid intellectual discipline. 
Consider the chances offered to a live teacher by such 
plays as the Alcestis and the Prometheus Vinctus, by 
many episodes in Homer and in Virgil’s Aenezd, by 
passages in Livy and in Tacitus, by portions even of 
Xenophon’s Azadasis, a work which when taught by 
dull people has been responsible for an appalling number 
of dull school-hours; in every case the conditions are 
the same, the pupil has plenty of work to do, and is 
not on the look-out for assaults upon his moral code. 
The classical languages, then, give exceptional oppor- 
tunities for suggestion, because in addition to a human 
content they present at the same time linguistic matter 
to which a rigid method can be applied. The mode of 
treating them too often adopted, by which they are 
used as a formal training only while the subject-matter is 
virtually ignored, is, it need scarcely be added, in itself 
not suggestive, and has done more than anything else 
to discredit classical studies as a school subject.? 
In suggestion through the medium of English 
literature the same general position holds good. The 
harder the technique of the subject, and the more it is 
1 The same danger threatens the teaching of modern languages. It is 
impossible to read the Modern Language Monthly, an organ conducted by 
experts for experts, and not to be struck by the small amount of reference to the 
subject-matter that should be read in schools. Apparently there is a failure 
to realise that the labour spent in perfecting the technique of linguistic in- 
struction is justified only if the ideas introduced through the medium of the 
language are worth introducing. If they are not, or if the attention paid to 
this element is not fully equal to that given to linguistic, the subject has com- 
paratively little claim upon our already overcrowded time-table,
-P-A-G-E-191

studied for itself, the more will the conditions for indirect 
moral suggestion be present. Take, for example, the 
following passage from Tennyson’s Ode on the Death of 
the Duke of Wellington :— 
Not once or twice in our rough island-story, 
The path of duty was the way to glory: 
He that walks it, only thirsting 
For the right, and learns to deaden 
Love of self, before his journey closes, 
He shall find the stubborn thistle bursting 
Into glossy purples, which outredden 
All voluptuous garden-roses. 
Not once or twice in our fair island-story, 
The path of duty was the way to glory: 
He, that ever following her commands, 
On with toil of heart and knees and hands, 
Thro’ the long gorge to the far light has won 
His path upward, and prevail’d, 
Shall find the toppling crags of Duty scaled 
Are close upon the shining table-lands 
To which our God Himself is moon and sun. 
Such was he; his work is done. 
But while the races of mankind endure, 
Let his great example stand 
Colossal, seen of every land, 
And keep the soldier firm, the statesman pure : 
Till in all lands and thro’ all human story 
The path of duty be the way to glory: 
And let the land whose hearths he saved from shame 
For many and many an age proclaim 
At civic revel and pomp and game, 
And when the long-illumined cities flame 
Their ever-loyal iron leader’s fame, 
With honour, honour, honour, honour to him, 
Eternal honour to his name.

In this passage the teaching is not concealed; it is 
definite and emphatic, and both the choice of words and 
the devices of metre combine to bring the lesson home. 
To expound the conception sententiously might easily 
be fatal, and in many a boy’s mind would engender a 
dislike for the Duke of Wellington similar to that often 
felt for the excessive virtue of the Pius /Eneas. The 
sermon has its place, but it is not in the class-room, or 
at any rate only on very rare occasions. The passage 
should, of course, be read with solemnity, and it should 
be read well. It is one of those passages that should 
never be entrusted to a bungler. The class should feel 
that the teacher appreciates it, and if they also feel that 
his appreciation makes him shrink from expounding it, 
so much the better. It is, however, necessary to dwell 
on the subject-matter, and this can be done from the 
analytical if not from the mandatory standpoint. If the 
class be asked as an exercise to analyse Tennyson’s 
conception and treatment of Duty, and to compare it 
with the treatment of the same subject in Wordsworth’s 
Ode to Duty, they will, from a purely intellectual 
standpoint, be busied with the subject-matter, and the 
moral teaching will be far more suggestive and far less 
likely to set up a tone of reaction than if thrust down 
the boys’ throats by a fervid address, 
To a younger class an easier exercise might be 
given. They might, for example, be asked to compare 
the virtues which were characteristic of the Duke of 
Wellington with those demanded from the knights of 
romance, and might be directed to re-read the Morte 
@’ Arthur and Str Galahad, if they were already 
acquainted with these poems, and to pick out the 
references to knightly duties that are to be found there,
-P-A-G-E-193
SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 179 
The object is the same, to keep the subject-matter 
before them and to avoid sententiousness by judiciously 
directed activity. It is scarcely necessary to add that, 
although in the process of indirect suggestion the teacher 
should to some extent keep himself in the background, 
the stronger is his personality the more effective will the 
indirect suggestion be. The nearer he approaches to 
the dividing line that separates indirect from direct 
suggestion, the more does the need of personality make 
itself felt, while without considerable force of character 
it is almost useless to make suggestions of the more 
violent kind, to tear off the whole covering of reserve, 
to force boys, whether they wish it or not, to view in 
their nakedness questions of conduct and morality that 
are generally evaded by them, or shrouded as rapidly 
as possible in schoolboy sophism and excuse. Without 
personality the effort is useless or even harmful ; with it 
almost anything may be done. A man who is obviously 
sincere in what he says, who evidently feels for his pupils 
a disinterested and in some cases a personal affection, 
in whom there is the element of sternness which com- 
mands respect, and who has in addition some instinct 
for a dramatic opportunity, may with effect speak to 
boys about matters otherwise better left untouched. It 
is, for example, not desirable to discuss with boys the 
importance and the nature of the suggestive influence that 
the school surroundings and society should have upon 
them. To do so under ordinary circumstances would 
be as unwise as to talk over the methods of teaching 
that you adopted and to dilate upon their excellence. 
And yet as they come from Arnold’s mouth the words 
carry with them their own justification.

  180 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
It seems to me that the advantage of great places of 
education are very considerable, and the benefits of such 
foundations as ours, of which the day has naturally reminded 
me, impose’ a great responsibility on all of us. I said the 
advantages of great places of education; and I meant to lay 
a stress upon the epithet. It seems to me that there is or 
ought to be something very ennobling in being connected 
with any establishment at once ancient and magnificent, where 
all about us and all the associations belonging to the objects 
around us should be great, splendid, and elevating. What an 
individual ought and often does derive from the feeling that 
he is born of an old and illustrious race, from being familiar 
from his childhood with the walls and with the trees that 
speak of the past no less than of the present, and make both 
full of images of greatness ; this, in an inferior degree, belongs 
to any member of an ancient and celebrated place of education. 
In this respect every one has a responsibility imposed upon 
him which I wish that we more considered. We know how 
school traditions are handed down from one school generation 
to another, and what is it if in all these there shall be nothing 
great, nothing distinguished, nothing but a record, to say the 
best of it, of mere boyish amusements, when it is not a record 
of childish follies? Every generation in which a low and 
foolish spirit prevails does its best to pollute the local influences 
of the place—to degrade its associations, to deprive the thought 
of belonging to it of anything that may enkindle and ennoble 
the minds of those who come after it. And if these foolish 
or tame associations continue they make the evil worse. . . . 
So the spirit gets lower and lower ; and instead of finding a 
help and an encouragement in its place of education, the 
ingenuous mind feels them all no more than a weight upon its 
efforts ; they only tend to thwart it and to keep it down. This 
is the tendency not only of a vicious tone prevailing in a great 
place of education, but even of a foolish and childish one; of 
a tone that tolerates ignorance and an indifference about all 
save the amusements of the day. On the other hand, what- 
ever is done here well and honourably outlives its own

generation. In smaller schools one cannot look forward to 
posterity; when our children are of an age to commence 
their education, a total change may have taken place in the 
spot, and all its associations may have vanished for ever. 
But here it is not so; the size, the scale, the wealth of a great 
institution like this insure its permanency so far as anything 
on earth is permanent. The good and evil, the nobleness or 
the vileness, which may exist on this ground now, will live and 
breathe here in the days of our children; they will form the 
atmosphere in which they will live hereafter, either wholesome 
and invigorating or numbing and deadly. This roof under 
which we are now assembled will hold, it is probable, our 
children and our children’s children ; may they be enabled to 
think when they kneel, perhaps over the bones of some of us 
now here assembled, that they are praying where their fathers 
prayed; and let them not, if they mock in their day the 
means of grace here offered, encourage themselves with the 
thought that the place had long ago been profaned with 
equal guilt; that they are but infected with the spirit of our 
ungodliness.? 
Neither would the straight hitting of the following 
passage produce the desired effect with the boys who 
need it most, unless the hitting were very straight and 
the words delivered with the immense force of fearless 
simplicity :— 
“€ Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in Me, it were 
better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he 
were drowned in the depth of the sea.”—Martr. xviii. 6. 
Now, then, you see what the text means and you feel how it 
applies to you. You know that there are amongst you many 
boys who remember and wish to keep the lessons that they 
have received at home, and you know also how much it is the 
fashion of schools to teach just the contrary. And I will take 
the two instances which will have come, I fear, often within

  182 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
the experience of you all. I mean the case of idleness and 
the case of extravagance, 
First for idleness. There are boys who have either never 
learnt or have quite forgotten all that may have been told them 
at home of the duty of attending to their school lessons. We 
know that there are boys who think all their lessons merely 
tedious, and who are resolved never to take any more trouble 
about them than what they cannot possibly avoid. But being 
thus idle themselves they cannot bear that others should be 
more attentive. We all know the terms of reproach and 
ridicule which are thrown out against a boy who works in 
earnest and upon principle. He is laughed at for taking 
unnecessary trouble, for being afraid of punishment, or for 
wishing to gain favour with the masters and be thought by 
them to be better than other boys. Either of these reproaches 
is one which a boy finds it very hard to bear; he does not 
like to be thought mean or as plodding or as wishing to 
court favour. He has not age or sense or firmness enough to 
know and to answer that the only fear of which he need be 
ashamed is the fear of his equals, the fear of those who are in 
no respect better than himself, and have therefore no sort of 
right to direct him. To be afraid, then, of other boys is in 
a boy the same sort of weakness as it is in a man to be 
afraid of other men; and as a man ought to be equally afraid 
of fearing men and of not fearing God, soa boy ought to be 
ashamed of fearing boys and of not fearing his parents and 
instructors. And as in after life the fear of God makes no 
man do anything mean or dishonourable, but the fear of man 
does lead to all sorts of wickedness and baseness ; so amongst 
boys this fear of their parents and teachers will only make 
them manly and noble and high-spirited, but the fear of their 
companions leads them to everything low and childish and 
contemptible. Those boys, then, who try to make others idle, 
and laugh at them for trying to please their masters, are 
exactly like the men who laugh at their neighbours for being 
religious and for living in the fear of God; and both are like 
the more hardened ruffians in a gang of thieves or other
-P-A-G-E-197
SOME PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 183 
criminals whose amusement it is to laugh at the fear of justice 
which beginners in crime have not yet quite got over. In all 
these instances there is not only the guilt of our own sin, but 
the far worse sin of encouraging sin in others ; and as I showed 
you last Sunday how your school faults, although very trifling 
in their worldly consequences, were yet as serious in the sight 
of God as the faults of grown-up men, because they showed 
that you were not serving or loving Him, but serving and 
loving evil; so it may be said, without the least going beyond 
the truth, that a boy who, being idle himself, tries to make 
others idle also, is exactly “offending one of these little ones 
who believe in Christ,” and is in the daily habit of that sin 
which Christ says it were better for him to die directly than 
to be guilty of. 
For utterances like these to have the full magnetic 
value that they must possess, unless they are to be 
regarded as the conventional discourse of the school 
pulpit, which is listened to with interest, perhaps, at 
the time of utterance, but leaves no later echo in the 
moral fibre, there should be behind them a single- 
minded self-sacrifice to the rising generation pervading 
all the routine of school duties, and making each 
individual who comes into contact with the speaker 
feel that his moral welfare is of interest to at least one 
other person besides himself. Then and not otherwise 
will the preacher’s voice 
Like a trumpet . . . rouse 
Those who with half-open eyes 
Tread the border-land dim 
’Twixt vice and virtue.?

CHAPTER X 
THE SANCTION OF SUGGESTION 
In hypnotic suggestion the personality of the subject is 
entirely obscured ; he becomes a mere puppet dependent 
on the person who pulls the strings. With direct sug- 
gestion in the waking state, though the personality is not 
obscured, the subject tends to become a reflection of some 
one else; his sentiments are echoes, and the develop- 
ment of his original self is so far hindered. Even with 
indirect suggestion and the auto-suggestion that arises 
out of it, although the suggestion developes along the 
lines prompted by natural characteristics, and although 
the development of these in many cases may be fostered 
rather than repressed, the thoughts and feelings of the 
subject become different from what they would have 
been without the conscious effort on the part of others 
to lead them in a certain direction. Although the char- 
acter may have developed, the mode of development has 
none the less been affected, and we have to ask by what 
right one person may take it upon himself to implant in 
another ideas and sentiments which will ultimately lead 
to action, which cannot fail to determine personality, 
and for which the subject himself in the beginning 
expressed no desire. The rights even of a father over 
his children are now restricted. He no longer, as in 
184   
-P-A-G-E-199
THE SANCTION OF SUGGESTION 185 
primitive times, is allowed to deprive them of life. Are 
we going to refuse him this right and yet give him full 
control over the personality which may be more durable 
than life? Or are we prepared to go farther, and allow 
him to delegate the right to any casual person? What 
_ are the rights of the child in the matter? It is on 
account of the widespread and often justifiable scepticism 
about education, to which reference has already been 
made, that these questions do not receive their proper 
share of attention. Once it is established that ideas 
properly suggested in connexion with the right habits 
of mind have indeed the powers ascribed to them, this 
scepticism must disappear. As long as education is 
ineffective, as long as it is a mere fashion, gratifying to 
the instinct that prompts us to make others like our- 
selves, but really unable to do more than impose a thin 
veneer of knowledge and of social convention, it is of 
comparative indifference what views on social matters 
are inculcated during the period of school life. In pro- 
portion as education becomes a real factor in determining 
the conduct and beliefs of the younger generation, the 
question as to sanction becomes increasingly insistent 
and refuses to be placed on one side. 
It is, in the first place, impossible to withdraw a child 
from all suggestive influences, unless he is brought up in 
air-tight isolation. He will receive suggestions from 
servants, from companions, from shop-windows, from 
the life that he sees in the streets. The efforts that are 
sometimes made to bring up a child with an impartial 
mind on matters of religion, morality, or politics, in 
order that he may be free to take his own line when he 
is of a fit age to judge, are bound to end in failure. 
From birth he is exposed to contagion on every side, 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  186 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
and long before he reaches maturity will be tinged with 
prejudices which render true impartiality of judgment 
difficult if not impossible. Impartiality is a state of 
mind that arises out of mature knowledge, and after a 
long process of examination and rejection of prejudices 
or preconceived opinions. With immaturity and igno- 
rance it cannot exist. The child, therefore, while he has 
a right to his characteristics, has no claim to be left 
wholly unaffected by suggestions consciously made, for 
this claim is meaningless. A sick man is not turned into 
a chemist’s shop and asked to make his own choice of 
drugs, and similarly a child must not be exposed to 
the countless suggestions that press in upon him with- 
out some effort to select and sift them, or to provide 
him with a guiding idea that may help to protect him 
from the more harmful of them. 
All suggestions do not present equal difficulty. 
Arranged in order of legitimacy they are: (1) Suggestions 
in connexion with accepted elements of moral conduct 
or the habits which promote such conduct; (2) Aésthetic 
suggestions ; (3) Social and political suggestions; (4) 
Religious suggestions. 
1. The first kind are not likely to be called in question 
either by the future adult or by the parent. No one can 
regret that as a child suggestions were made to him of 
temperance, of self-control, of self-sacrifice, of courage, 
of kindliness. To make such suggestions is the first 
duty of the teacher. Indeed, it is upon the inculcation of 
truth, the basis of all morality, that a great part of school 
training is concentrated. The training in accuracy, 
in habits of neatness, and in logical reasoning, which 
is given by the formal element in rigid school studies 
such as classics, mathematics, and science, while not in
-P-A-G-E-201
  
   THE SANCTION OF SUGGESTION 187 
itself a suggestion of truth, produces the right temper of 
mind to receive it. With this training as a basis, sug- 
gestions of the beauty of scholarship, of the moral value 
of taking into consideration all the facts before attempting 
to form a conclusion, of the deplorable moral results of 
slipshod work, slipshod reasoning, and half-conscious 
concealment of data, may effectively be given. If sug- 
gestions of this kind raise any problem, it is that of the 
teacher’s responsibility rather than of his right to suggest. 
2. Neither do esthetic suggestions present much 
difficulty. It is true that standards of taste in literature 
and in art differ widely, and that therefore for those 
who believe in a close connexion between esthetic and 
moral insight the selection of the proper standards will 
be of great importance ; but the adult who looks back 
on his school-days is likely to be grateful if any sugges- 
tion has been made that has opened up for him a field 
of esthetic enjoyment, even though he recognises that 
with juster appreciation or greater knowledge on the 
part of the teacher his esthetic insight and interest 
might have been deeper or of more rapid development. 
3. With social and political matters the case is 
different, and the remodelling of the school curriculum 
adds to the difficulty. As long as the basis of school 
studies was the classics taught from the standpoint of 
grammar and syntax, and supplemented by a mainly 
formal study, such as mathematics, it was not necessary 
to consider the effect of school training on social views 
and political standpoints. It is now recognised that in 
school studies the humanities are paramount, that neces- 
sary though a knowledge of science may be as giving an 
interest in a powerful factor of social development, and 
training the mind to accurate thought in a well-defined
-P-A-G-E-202
  188 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
class of subject-matter, it must be preceded by an insight 
into human aspirations and character. For the first time 
in the course of education since the Renaissance a fair 
amount of attention is given to modern history, literature, 
and geography, and the suggestion is made that they 
shall be properly taught. But let there be no hesitation 
in facing the situation. Either these subjects will remain 
sham subjects, always prone to degenerate into conven- 
tional knowledge, in which case it is sheer waste to spend 
either public or private money upon them ; or they will 
be taught as serious branches of human life and expres- 
sion, and in this case it is almost impossible to avoid 
innumerable questions of the gravest kind which few 
adults can discuss without some difference of opinion. 
In the history lesson it is impossible to avoid a treatment 
of the religious questions under the Tudors and of the 
political questions under the Stuarts. Bain realised this, 
and though he is astute enough to see the difficulty, his 
lack of insight into educational practice led him to 
conclude that in the interests of peace history must be 
excluded from the class-room.! In the literature lesson, 
if properly conceived as an introduction to the serious 
study of human sentiment and ideals, debatable questions 
of some kind are seldom absent ; in the geography lesson 
such topics as empire, the rights and the treatment of 
inferior races, the duties and the dangers of colonisation, 
1 A. Bain, Education as a Science, 8th ed., 1892, p. 287. ‘‘A very searching 
inquiry into modern events brings out such a variety of opinions on practical 
politics, and still more in religion, as to make an obstacle to the introduction 
of the subject into the higher schools and colleges. This difficulty is felt in 
Germany, where professors are more outspoken than in England; it also 
occurs in connexion with the Irish Roman Catholics in the Queen’s Colleges. 
A history of the Reformation could hardly be thorough if it offended neither 
Protestants nor Roman Catholics ; a history of the first centuries of the Chris- 
tian era, if it dissatisfied nobody, would be worthless to everybody.”   
-P-A-G-E-203
  
THE SANCTION OF SUGGESTION 189 
can be avoided only at the risk of sterilising the 
subject. 
The solution which most readily rises to the mind is 
that of an impartial treatment. In the handling of all 
controversial questions the teacher might refrain from 
taking one side or the other, might content himself with 
indicating in a clear-cut fashion the oppositions of view 
and of standpoint involved, leaving the pupil free to 
bestow his sympathies as he wishes, and guided by them 
to draw his own conclusions as to motive and character. 
As a result of this, it might be hoped that the pupil 
would acquire the habit of impartial and detached judg- 
ment. Stated in general terms, this solution is a specious 
one; when examined in detail it is seen to make an 
impossible demand. There are subjects about which it 
is impossible for a serious man to be impartial. Every 
one who has studied history with any attention has his _ 
views upon the various religious controversies, upon the 
rights of the people and of the crown, and on the claims 
and dangers of democratic development ; and in expound- 
ing his subject, such a man cannot fail to indicate what 
these views are. In fact, his very efforts to be impartial 
may give to his own views, when they happen to filter 
through, even greater suggestive force. If he were to 
display a violent partisanship, it is not at all improbable 
that a reaction would be set up, and that his pupils would 
deliberately range themselves on the other side; while 
the evident anxiety not to obtrude a genuine enthusiasm 
will disarm opposition. Doubtless there are men who 
take no interest in religious, political, and social ques- 
tions, but these are not the men who should be selected 
to give instruction in humanistic subjects. If such men 
attempt to give a carefully-balanced statement of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
    190 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
merits and demerits of any position or of any personality, 
they are, as result, far more likely to produce in their 
pupils a spirit of scepticism than one of impartiality, a 
dreary attitude of indifferentism rather than a burning 
enthusiasm for the subject combined with a resolution in 
the interests of fairness to check the tendency to favour 
one side rather than the other. Interest and enthusiasm 
should be the outcome of all lessons in the humanities ; 
a sense of impartiality is desirable in conjunction with 
these, but is no substitute for them. 
It seems, therefore, as if in dealing with the humanistic 
subjects the teacher must either suggest his own opinions 
or be wholly ineffective. There are, however, two 
palliatives of this position :—(a) He may confess that he 
has certain views, and while he makes no concealment 
of them may keep them in the background and state 
the opposite views with force. In this case, by not 
exciting curiosity as to his opinions, he will diminish the 
suggestive force of his own ideas, while yet allowing the 
class to see that to him the subject is a serious one. 
(6) Ina large school it is improbable that all teachers 
will hold the same opinions, and thus the pupils in passing 
from one class to another will hear conflicting views. 
These to some extent will neutralise one another, and 
the view that ultimately becomes suggestive may be that 
which is in sympathy with the boys’ natural inclinations 
or home up-bringing. 
But when all is said, if the curriculum is good it will 
contain debatable matter, and if the teacher is good he 
will be suggestive in one direction or another, and we 
have once more to ask by what right he suggests his 
own convictions in matters where varied opinions are 
possible,
-P-A-G-E-205
ae 
THE SANCTION OF SUGGESTION tor 
Two situations are conceivable. (1) He may be 
teaching in a school of private or semi-private character. 
In this case it may be assumed that he has been selected 
by a school in which views of a certain kind are held on 
the more important features of religion and politics, and 
thus that his line of thought has been settled for him 
and acquiesced in by him. If the parent chooses his own 
school, and has a sufficient choice of schools, the problem 
is largely solved ; although even here the State may have 
a right to intervene and to demand that its future citizens 
shall not be brought up in too narrow a spirit. 
(2) When the teacher is paid either wholly or in part 
by the State, and when his pupils are drawn from 
families representing every variety of opinion, the 
position is not so simple. If many parents are of a 
democratic way of thinking, is he justified in suggesting 
to his class that the execution of Charles I. was a crime? 
When the pupils are drawn from families whose views 
are conservative, is he to be debarred from pressing upon 
them the virtues of the Commonwealth ? 
The desire to secure freedom of view for the teacher 
has led to a demand that definitely religious instruction 
shall be excluded from the curriculum of State-aided 
schools; but if this method were extended to all the 
subjects in which variety of opinion is possible, little 
that is worth teaching would be left, and therefore this 
solution cannot be entertained. Neither can it be 
admitted that the State as paymaster has the right to 
draw up a syllabus of the views that may be suggested 
and of those that may not. Such a syllabus would 
represent the views of the dominant party for the time 
being, but might be wholly opposed to those of a large 
minority. In German secondary schools teachers of 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
192 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
history are instructed to use the history lesson as an 
instrument for inculcating respect for the Hohenzollerns 
and distrust of social-democratic principles; and 
similarly an ultra-democratic party when in power 
might demand the teaching of social-democratic views, 
and the stern repression of any tendency towards con- 
servative or monarchical sentiment on the part of the 
younger generation. If under such a regimen the 
subjects that we have in mind were taught at all, the 
new tyranny would effectively repress in the teacher all 
enthusiasm and all human feeling; he would become a 
dull mechanism, competent to place before his pupils 
formal antitheses, but unable to excite in them real 
enthusiasm or to communicate to them real insight. 
With such conditions, suggestion would be impossible 
and education a mockery. For a teacher to be effective 
he must be untrammelled by any direct external coercion, 
he must be free to take the line in which his instincts 
lead him, and when deep-seated feeling compels him to 
adopt a certain position he must be under no constraint 
to conceal his views. Whence is the sanction of this 
freedom to be derived ? 
From two sources : the principle of averages and the 
professional position and spirit of the teacher. It is 
unlikely that in the long run views of a one-sided nature 
will be predominant among teachers taken as a class, 
Teachers are drawn from the whole society, and the 
relative proportions of opinions in the community will 
be faithfully represented in the limited section to whom 
, education is confided. In any one school, as we have 
seen, it is probable that a variety of opinions will be 
represented by the staff, and it is as necessary that a 
pupil should be brought into contact with conflicting 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  
THE SANCTION OF SUGGESTION 193 
views as that, through the subjects taught in a varied 
curriculum, he should become acquainted with the 
particular mode of reasoning embodied in the technique 
of each separate branch of study. 
But it is from the professional spirit of the teacher that 
the main sanction must be derived. To the teacher as a 
professional man the community confides the upbring- 
ing of its children; the more effective his intellectual 
and professional training has been, and the more he 
realises his responsibility, the greater the extent to which 
he can be trusted. He must be free from external 
coercion, from internal constraint he can never be re- 
lieved. His whole teaching life must be permeated by 
a sense of the grave duties of his position and of the 
trust reposed in him. This spirit, if it be present, will 
lead to a severe pruning of crude views and unruly 
enthusiasms. Under its guidance he will give his 
pupils the most moderate expression of the opinions 
which he finds himself driven to uphold, and he will 
refrain from communicating to them those which arise 
from passing moods or temporary irritation. He will 
be an example to them of reticence and of balanced 
judgment, and will give them only of his best, the fruits 
of all the self-criticism of which he is capable. More 
than all other professional men he must be mindful of 
his responsibility. If suggestion is indeed a force in 
education, if the passing remark of a gifted teacher 
may set in motion a train of ideas that ever grows from 
within until ultimately it forms a dominating system 
and a constant guide of conduct, the schoolmaster’s craft 
demands from those who enter upon it continual watch- 
fulness and continual self-control, and needs as inspiration 
a single-hearted devotion to the welfare of the young.

APPENDIX 
THE RELATION BETWEEN MENTAL DISSOCIATION AND THE 
SYMPTOMS OF HYPNOSIS AND SUGGESTIBILITY 
Mite. R. L., twenty-eight years of age, had been a somnam- 
bulist from infancy. Her childhood was spent in the country 
with her parents; later she was governess and companion in 
rich families. In a state of somnambulism she jumped into a 
pond and afterwards had a severe fever. Later on her attacks 
of somnambulism increased. “She dreams of her mother. 
Wishes to go into the country; packs in great haste, ‘for the 
carriage is waiting,’ runs to say good-bye to the people in the 
house, not without shedding a good many tears. She rapidly 
descends the staircase, does not stop till she reaches the street 
door, the key of which she has taken the precaution to hide, 
and sinks down in distress near it. For a long time she resists 
any one who persuades her to rise and go back to bed, com- 
plaining bitterly of the tyranny of which she is a victim. She 
ends, but not always, by returning to bed, usually without 
entirely undressing, and it is this which tells her on awakening 
that she has not slept quietly; for she has no memory of 
anything that has happened during the attack.” 
Some of her attacks are of a different nature. “It is eight 
o’clock in the evening: several women are working round a 
table on which is placed a lamp. Mlle. R. L. directs the work, 
and herself takes an active part, chatting gaily. Suddenly a 
noise is heard as her forehead falls sharply on the edge of the 
table: her shoulders are bowed. This is the beginning of the 
attack. She straightens herself after a few seconds, tears off 
195
-P-A-G-E-210
196 SUGGESTION IN EDUCATION 
her eyeglasses spitefully, and continues the work which she 
had commenced. She no longer needs the glasses which 
considerable short-sightedness render necessary in her normal 
state, even though she places herself so that her work is less 
exposed to the lamplight. If she needs to thread her needle 
she throws both hands under the table, feeling in the dark, 
and in less than a second succeeds in putting the silk through 
the eye—a thing which she does with difficulty in the normal 
state, even when she is aided by eyeglasses and a bright light.” + 
More remarkable still is the case of Miss Beauchamp, 
observed and admirably described by Dr. Morton Prince of 
Boston.? Miss Beauchamp while attending to her duties as a 
hospital nurse suffered a mental shock. “She returned to her 
duties much agitated. For several days she was in an excited 
state. She walked the wards by night, and in the daytime, 
when off duty and supposed_to be asleep, slipped out of the 
hospital and wandered about on the fields. Then she began 
. . . gradually to change in character.” It was in this condition 
that she first came under Dr. Prince’s care. As the con- 
ventional modes of treatment did not benefit her, it was 
decided to try hypnotic suggestion. She fell readily into a 
state of deep hypnosis and various suggestions were made to 
her which considerably benefited her mental health. This 
treatment was continued. Her personality under hypnosis 
was not noticeably different from that of the waking state 
except that she was more submissive and amenable to 
suggestion. On several occasions, however, Dr. Prince was 
surprised to find that her character in hypnosis was completely 
altered, that she denied facts which she had previously 
admitted, and talked of Miss Beauchamp as She, whereas 
when hypnotised she had always alluded to herself in the first 
person. This proved to be the birth of a fresh personality, 
which later on chose for itself the name of Sally. At a later 
date a third personality developed unlike either of the others, 
and the final state of disaggregation which this unfortunate

lady’s mental system displayed may be schematised as 
follows :— 
B. I—The personality which came to Dr. Prince for treat- 
ment, and which he imagined to be the real Miss Beauchamp. 
Her characteristics were saintliness, meekness, reserve, great 
depression about herself, and aboulia or inability to do or 
to say what she wanted. She could read and understand 
French. 
B. II.—B. I. hypnotised. In many respects she was like 
B. I. but in some ways more normal. 
B. III.—A totally different personality, Mischievous and 
apparently quite devoid of any moral sense. When she got 
the upper hand, her great delight was to play pranks and do 
things calculated to irritate B, I. She was wholly ignorant of 
French, and presented some curious symptoms of anesthesia. 
B. IV.—A different personality again, more like B. I. than 
B. III., but with totally different likes and dislikes. She was 
more normal than Miss Beauchamp, did not suffer from 
aboulia, had more self-control and more courage, but was 
quick-tempered when restrained or placed in circumstances 
which she did not enjoy. 
B. V.—This was B. III. hypnotised. 
B. VI.—This was B. IV. hypnotised. 
These personalities alternated with alarming rapidity. On 
the occasion of a visit to Dr. Prince, who had been perplexed 
by the inconsequence of his visitor, it was elicited “that it 
was B. I. who started to make the call, and on the way had 
changed several times back and forth with Sally and B. IV. 
B. IV. walked on in a mechanical way without any particular 
knowledge of what she was going to do. It was B. I. who 
had rung the door bell, changing on entering the house to 
B. IV., then back again to B. I. on the staircase, finally enter- 
ing the room as B. IV.” 
The knowledge that each had of the others differed greatly. 
Both B. I. and B. II. were for a long time in ignorance of the

existence of B. III., and never knew anything about her except 
what they were told. 
B. I. knew nothing about B. II., but her memory was good 
for the whole of her previous life. 
B. III. knew everything about herself (¢.e. her memory was 
continuous) as well as about B. I. and B. II. She knew B. I.’s 
inmost soul. She knew what B. IV. did, but was ignorant of 
her thoughts. 
B. IV. when she first came into existence had no know- 
ledge of anything. Later on she knew of her own experiences 
and developed a fragmentary knowledge of B. I. 
The following episode illustrates well the relations between 
Sally and B. I. “On one occasion Sally smoked cigarettes, a 
thing that B. I, would never have done. Miss Beauchamp, 
when awakened, entirely ignorant of what she had been doing, 
complained of a bitter taste in her mouth, but could not 
identify it, At the next interview I remarked to Sally, 
‘Wasn't it fun to see Miss Beauchamp when she tasted the 
tobacco in her mouth and did not know what it was.’ Sally 
laughed and thought it a great joke. ‘Yes, she thought you 
had been putting quinine in her mouth, but did not dare ask 
you.’ This remark, later verified by Miss Beauchamp, was 
one of many which showed that Sally had knowledge of Miss 
Beauchamp’s thoughts.” ? 
Miss Beauchamp was finally restored to health. The basis 
of the real Miss Beauchamp turned out to be B. IL. or the 
hypnotic state of B. I. With this by suggestion were combined 
B. I. and B. IV., and the result was a stable personality whose 
memory covered all the other personalities except that of Sally. 
On the fusion of I., II., and IV., Sally disappeared. 
This case brings out very forcibly the close relation between 
dissociation and suggestibility. As we have seen, suggestions 
of anaesthesia or negative suggestions are easy to produce in 
the hypnotic state. With Miss Beauchamp they could be 
produced in the waking state. “I say to Miss Beauchamp, 
1 Of. ett .p. 55. 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
APPENDIX 199 
‘Sensation will disappear from the forefinger of your right 
hand,’ at the same time stroking the finger with light touches. 
The finger becomes profoundly anesthetic, so that a pin may 
be thrust into the skin and the joints bent without anything 
being felt. All forms of sensation are included in the 
anesthesia, which is profound for all objects and stimuli.” 
In the following experiment the anesthesia is of a some- 
what different character :—“I hold up a metal rod (an electrode 
for an electrical machine) before her eyes and say, ‘Close your 
eyes fora moment. When you open them this electrode will 
have disappeared.’ She closes her eyes, and on opening them 
cannot see the metal rod, though it is held directly before 
her. She sees my hand as if holding something, but she sees 
nothing else. I tell her to feel the rod. She puts her hand 
upon it and says that she can feel it ; in fact, she fingers it and 
follows the outline of the metal rod and the ball at the top. 
She feels something that she cannot see. I now say, ‘I shall 
pass the electrode from one hand to the other. When it is in 
the left hand you will see it, but when in the right it will dis- 
appear.’ I pass the rod back and forth from one hand to the 
other, and the moment it is grasped by the left hand it 
becomes visible, but disappears as soon as seized by the 
right.” 
Here the normal state of disaggregation evidently brings 
with it as a concomitant extreme suggestibility,! and this is to 
be noticed also in the case of Mr. Hanna, observed by 
Messrs. Sidis and Goodhart.? 
Mr. Hanna fell from his horse and injured his spine. The 
shock deprived him of his memory. He became as one newly 
born and was aware of experiences previous to the accident 
only as information derived from others. His personal identity 
thus went back no farther than the accident. He could not 
be hypnotised, so that this method of cure was not available. 
By degrees, however, his primary personality came back for 
1 The case of Lucie reported by M. Janet, L’Automatisme Psychologigque, 
p. 87, illustrates the same curious relationship between the various personalities.

short spells, these spells became longer, and finally the two 
personalities were fused together with one continuous memory. 
His secondary state presents some remarkable features 
analogous to those which we have already observed in Miss 
Beauchamp. His emotions changed rapidly and were readily 
influenced by passing events; they were unstable and less 
persistent than in his other state. His sensitiveness in the 
secondary state was very acute, and he was extremely susceptible 
to external stimuli. This delicate sensitiveness manifested 
itself in a form which to his family appeared as clairvoyance. 
Thus he was able to find objects hidden from him, and was 
uniformly correct in guessing in which hand a small coin was 
held, both hands being concealed from view. His knowledge 
seemed to be a kind of intuition, or, as he said, instinct, which 
he could not explain or understand. This condition was 
absent both in the primary state and in the final condition of 
restored health. This clairvoyance greatly awed Mr. Hanna’s 
family, who attempted to conceal it even from the doctors who 
attended the case.

‘<From the point of view of the professional teacher it is impossible to 
speak too highly of Mr. Keatinge’s work. . . . Mr. Keatinge has given us 
a book that should rejoice the heart of every one but a pedant.”—JOHN 
ADAMS, Professor of Education, University of London, in Zhe Bookman. 
“Mr. Keatinge is a master of felicitous expression. . . . Wisdom was 
never more pleasantly communicated.”—Guardian. 
“A most original and suggestive work, and one that deals in a masterly 
style, and, in our opinion, most successfully, with many difficult problems 
with which teachers of history find themselves at times confronted. . . . 
Teachers of history will find much that is helpful, stimulating, and sugges- 
tive in these practical, scholarly, and sympathetic pages.” Zhe Teacher. 
“*Mr. Keatinge has again made teachers his debtors by giving them a 
book full of stimulus and help. . . . Space does not permit of more than a 
reference to the chapters on the organisation of history teaching, the effect 
of external examinations, the correlation of history and literature, some 
problems and devices of class-room practice. They all deserve to be care- 
fully read by every teacher who wishes to see how history can be made 
instructive, interesting, and disciplinary.” —7he Glasgow Herald. 
‘*A book of much suggestion and value.”—Zimes, 
‘Very happy . . . very skilful . . . admirable exposition .. . 
intensely interesting as well as practically useful . . . full of suggestion for 
the practical teacher. . . . Mr. Keatinge has got to the heart of the 
matter.” —Journal of Education. 
“We cannot question the value of the methods of teaching history so 
ably set out by Mr. Keatinge. . . . Mr. Keatinge has been very clear in 
setting out his methods. We can recommend the study of his work.”— 
Westminster Gazette. 
‘©We may say at once that Mr. Keatinge has produced a book of very 
high quality. His theoretical exposition shows the same mastery of 
psychology which made his earlier work on suggestion so serviceable, but 
while giving due place to theory he devotes a large part of his space to 
detailed illustrations of class-room method. . . . He brings the whole 
problem into clear relief in a fashion that cannot be ignored by those who 
control the curricula of secondary schools.” —Manchester Guardian, 
“« Experienced, thoughtful, and well reasoned, the work cannot but prove 
profitable reading to educationalists wishing to specialise in this direction.”

Speaker.—‘ The volume before us does more than present 
the ‘Great Didactic’ of Comenius for the first time in English. 
It supplies several important ‘ Introductions, biographical and his- 
torical,’ bearing upon the state of education in Comenius’s time, 
and the works, character, and career of the greatest educationalist 
of that remarkable century. These Introductions are based on 
original research, and on the best German authorities. They 
embody a fuller account of the great educationalist’s life and works 
than has been hitherto accessible to the English reader.”

NOTE 
This book distinguishes between hypnotic sugges- 
tion and suggestion in the waking state, analyses 
and describes the conditions upon which suggestion 
in the waking state depends, and discusses the 
proper place of suggestion among the other methods 
used by teachers. In the, development of the 
analysis are treated such topics as “ Operations 
Preliminary to Suggestion,” ‘Education as 
Creative,” and “The Sanction of Suggestion.”

Education.— We regard Mr. Keatinge’s work as one of the 
most valuable contributions to educational science which have 
been published during recent years. . . . It is a fascinating work, 
calculated to interest the thoughtful parent as well as the pro- 
fessional reader.” 
Bookman.—* The book is one of the most refreshing and stimu- 
lating that has appeared for a long time.” 
Glasgow Herald—* This is one of the freshest books on 
education that have appeared in recent times.” 
Aberdeen Free Press.— The whole book is ‘suggestive’ in 
the true sense. . . . It is one of the best books on education that 
we have seen for a long time.” 
Manchester Guardian.— A very successful attempt to show how 
the fruits of psychological inquiry . . . can be employed to 
elucidate the practice of education. A work of real importance 
which will challenge careful attention from students of education.” 
Tribune.— Most stimulating. ... Presents the art of teaching 
in a fascinating light.” 
Western Morning News.—‘ Very interesting and extremely 
thoughtful. . . . This undoubtedly clever production.” 
Educational News.—“ We strongly recommend teachers who 
wish a new light on many of the problems they are tackling every

mathematics and science, and these subjects, quite apart 
from all questions of practical utility, could never be 
omitted from the curriculum, because they illustrate a 
particular kind of exactitude and a particular aspect of 
truth. It is because they involve the elements of truth 
and exactitude that the humanistic subjects can be 
made as profitable as the scientific ones, and it is because 
their subject-matter is of greater importance to the life 
of conduct and of action that greater prominence must 
be given to them. For the subjects through which 
moral ideas can be introduced are primarily the 
humanistic: history, literature, and geography. It 
is in connexion with these that ideals of conduct and 
suggestive human situations are to be found, and if 
suggestion is to be indirect, the first necessity in such 
humanistic subjects is that they shall possess a strong 
technique of their own, that they shall lend themselves 
to problem work, that in the process of instruction the 
pupil shall have his work to do as well as the teacher, 
and that the pupil’s part shall, if anything, be harder 
and involve more reasoning than the teacher’s. All 
these elements are necessary, and all these history, at 
any rate, supplies, if taught in the right way. 
If, however, it is used, as the followers of Herbart 
would use it, solely for the sake of giving examples of 
conduct, it may fail lamentably in this direction. The 
too constant pressing upon a boy of examples of con- 
duct, or the sententious handling of episodes, is certain 
to arouse suspicion in his mind. In fact, the whole 
doctrine of influence by suggestion is wholly at variance 
with the principles that underlie what the school of 
Herbart calls character-forming instruction (Gesinnungs- 
Unterricht). ‘“Character-forming instruction is that

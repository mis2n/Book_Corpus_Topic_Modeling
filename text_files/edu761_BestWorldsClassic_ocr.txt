If the work does not seem satisfactory and the 
steward should excuse himself by declaring that 
he has done his best, that the slaves were good 
for nothing, that the weather was bad, that some

also be told that when slaves were sick their ra- 
tions should be cut down. 
When the matters have been settled to the 
master’s satisfaction, he should take measures to 
see that what has not been done be at once ac- 
complished. He should then proceed to consider 
the account of the farm, and a consideration of 
the amount of grain which has been prepared for 
fodder. He should have returns made of wine

and olive-oil, and learn how much: has been con- 
sumed, how much sold, how much is left over and 
may be put on sale. If thereiig a deficit any 
year, he should order it to be made up from the 
outside, and whatever is above theneeds of the 
farm sold. If there is anything: to:Jet out’ on 
contract, he should order this to be:done, and con- 
cerning the work which he wishes to’ be thus ac- 
complished he should give his order: in: writing. 
As regards the cattle he should order them to be 
sold by auction, and in the same way should sell. - 
the oil, if the price of oil has. risen; likewise the 
superfluous wine and corn of the estate. He should 
also order to be sold worn-out bulls, blemished 
eattle, blemished sheep, wool, hides, any plow * 
that is old, old tools,. old slaves, slaves who are 
diseased, or anything else which is useless, for the 
owner of a farm must be a seller and not a pur- 
chaser. . 
The owner of a farm and of: slaves must begin 
to study in early manhood the cultivation and 
sowing of the land. He should, however, think 
a long time before building his villa, but not 
about farming his property, which he should set 
about at once. Let him wait until his thirty-sixth 
year and then build, provided his whole property 
is under cultivation. So build that neither. the 
villa be disproportionately small in comparison 
with the farm nor the farm in comparison with 
the villa. It behooves a slave-owner’ to have a 
well-built country house, containing a wine-cellar, 
a place for storing olive-oil, and.¢asks in. such 
numbers that he may look forward with delight 
to a time of searcity and high prices, and this 
will add not only to his wealth, but to his in- 
5

fluence and reputation. He must have wine- 
presses of the first order, that his wine may be 
well made. When the olives have been picked, 
let oil be at once made or it will turn out rancid. 
Recollect that every year the olives are shaken 
from the trees in great number by violent storms. 
If you gather them up quickly and have vessels 
ready to receive them, the storm will have done 
them no harm and the oil will be ali the greener 
and better. If the olives be on the ground or 
even on the barn floor too iong, the oil made from 
them will be fetid. Olive-oil will be always good 
and sweet if it be promptly made. 
The following are the duties of a steward: He 
must maintain strict discipline, and see that the 
festivals are observed. While he keeps his hands 
off the property of a neighbor, let him look. well 
to his own. The slaves are to be kept from quar- 
reling. If any of them commits a fault, he should 
be punished in a kindly manner. The steward 
must see that the slaves are comfortable and suf- 
fer neither from cold nor hunger. By keeping 
them busy he will prevent them from running 
into mischief or stealing. If the steward sets his 
face against evil doing, evil will not be done by 
them. His master must call him to task if he let 
evil doing go unpunished. If one slave do him 
any service, he should show gratitude that the 
others may ‘be encouraged to do right. The steward 
must not be a gadder or a diner-out, but must 
give all his attention to working the slaves, and 
considering how best to carry out his master’s 
instructions. «

condemned to restore double; a:ugurer quadruple. 
‘We thus see how mach worse they, thought it for 
a citizen to be a money-lender than a. thief. 
Again, when they praised a gdod.man, they 
praised him as a good farmer or a good husband- 
man. Men so praised were held to have received 
the highest praise. For myself, I think well of a 
merchant as a man of energy and studious of 
gain; but it is a career, as I have said, that leads 
to danger and ruin. However, farming makes the 
bravest men and the sturdiest- soldiers, and of all 
sources of gain is the surest, the most natural, 
and the least invidious, and those who are busy 
with it have the fewest bad thoughts.

THE BLESSINGS OF OLD AGE' 
Nor even now do I feel the want of the strength 
of a young man, no more than when a young 
man I felt the want of the strength of the bull 
or of the elephant. What one has, that one ought. 
to use; and whatever you do, you should do it 
with all your strength. For what expression ean 
be more contemptible than that of Milo* of Cro- 
tona, who, when he was now an old man, and was 
looking at the prize-fighters exercising themselves 
on the course, is reported to have looked at his 
1¥rom the “Cate Major, an Essay on Old Age.” Trans- 
lated by Cyrus R, Edmonds. This work is composed in the 
formi of a dialog, in which, in the person ef Cato the Censor 
_a8 speaker, the benefits of old age are pointed out,

  arms, and, weeping over them,:to-have said, “But 
these, indeed, are now dead.” «Nay, foolish man, 
not these arms so much as yourself; for you never 
derived your nobility from yourself; ‘but from. 
your chest and your arms. Nothing of the kind 
did Sextus ABlius ever say, nothing of the kind 
many years before did Titus Corancanius, nothing 
lately did Publius Crassus; by whom instructions 
in jurisprudence were given. to their fellow citi- 
zens, and whose wisdom was progressive even to _ 
their latest breath. For the orator, I fear lest: 
he be enfeebled by old age; for eloquence isa 
gift not of mind only, but also of lungs and 
strength. On the whole, that melodiousness in the 
voice is graceful, I know not how, even in old 
age; which, indeed, I have not lost, and you see 
my years. . 
‘Yet there is a graceful style of eloquence in an 
old man, unimpassioned and subdued, and very 
often the elegant and gentle discourse of an elo- 
quent old man wins for itself a hearing; and if 
you have not yourself the power to produce this’ 
effect, yet you may be able to teach it to Scipio. 
and Lalius. For what is more delightful than old 
age surrounded with the studious attention of 
youth? Shall we not leave even. such a resouree 
to old. age, as to teach young men, instruct them, 
train them to every department of duty? an: em- 
ployment, indeed, than which what can be more- 
noble? But, for my part, I thought the Cueius

L, 4imilius and P. Africanus, quite happy in the 
attendance of noble youths; nor are any precep- 
tors of liberal accomplishments to be deemed 
otherwise’ than happy, tho their strength hath 
"fallen into old age and failed; altho that very 
failure of strength is more frequently caused by 
the follies of youth than by those of old age; for 
a lustful and intemperate youth transmits to old 
age an exhausted body. Cyrus too, in Xenophon, 
in that discourse which he delivered on his death- 
bed when he was a. very old man, said that he 
never felt that his old age had become feebler than 
his youth had been. I recollect, when a boy, that 
Lucius Metellus,* who, when four years after his 
second consulship he had been made “pontifex 
maximus,” and for twenty-two years held that 
sacerdotal office, enjoyed such good strength: at 
the latter period of his life, that he felt no want 
of youth. There is no need for me to speak 
about myself, and yet that is the privilege of old 
age, and conceded to my time of life. 
Do you see how, in Homer, Nestor very often 
proclaims his own virtues? for he was now living 
in the third generation of men; nor had he occa- 
sion to fear lest, when stating the truth about 
himself, he should appear either too arrogant or 
too talkative; for, as Homer says, from his tongue 
speech flowed sweeter than honey; for which 
eharm. he stood in need of no strength of body; 
and yet the famous chief of Greece nowhere 
wishes to have ten men like Ajax, but like Nestor; 
and he does not doubt if that should happen, Troy 
would in a short time perish.

But I return to myself. Ivar in my eighty- 
fourth year. In truth I shotld:like to be able 
to make the same boast that ‘did; but one 
thing I can say, that altho T hav it, to be sure, 
that strength which I had eith ‘a soldier in 
the Punie war or as questor in’ thé:game war, or 
as Consul in Spain, or, four ‘yearsafterward, 
when as military tribune I fought. battle at 
Thermopyle, in the consulship of Marens. Acilius 
Glabrio; yet, as you see, old age has not quite 
enfeebled me or broken me down: the senate- 
house does not miss my strength, nor the rostra,).’" 
nor my friends, nor my clients, nor my guests; 
for I have never agreed to that old and much- 
praised proverb which advises you to become an 
old-man early if you wish to be an old man long. 
I for my part would rather be an old man for a 
shorter length of time than be an old man before 
I was one. And, therefore, no.one.as yet has 
wished to have an interview with me to whom I 
have been denied as engaged. : . 
But I have less strength than either of you 
two. Neither even do you possess the strength of 
Titus Pontius the centurion; is he, therefore, the. . 
more excellent man? Only let there be a moderate. 
degree of strength, and let every man exert him- 
self as much as he can; and in truth that man will 
not be absorbed in regretting the want of 
strength. Milo, at Olympia, is said to have gone 
over the course while supporting on his shoulders 
a live ox. Whether, then, would you rather have 
this strength of body, or Pythagoras’ strength of 
intellect, bestowed upon you? In.a.word, enjoy 
that blessing while you have it; when it is gone, 
do not lament it, onless, indeed, young men ought 
11    
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  
THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  to lament the loss of boyhood, and ‘those a litile 
advaneed in age the loss of adolescence. There 
is a definite career in life, and one way of nature, 
and that a simple one; and to every part of life 
its own peculiar period has been assigned; so that 
both the feebleness of boys, and the high spirit 
of young men, and the steadiness of now fixt man- 
hood, and the maturity of old age, have some- 
thing natural which ought to be enjoyed in their 
own time. I suppose that you hear, Scipio, what 
~your grandfather’s host, Masinissa,” is doing at 
this day, at the age of ninety. When he has com- 
menced a journey on foot, he never mounts at all; 
when on horseback, he never dismounts; by no 
rain, by no cold, is he prevailed upon to have 
his head covered; that there is in him the greatest 
hardiness of frame; and therefore he performs 
all the duties and functions of a king. Exercise, 
therefore, and temperance, even in old age, can 
preserve some remnant of our pristine vigor. 
Is there no strength in old age? neither is 
strength exacted from old age. Therefore, by our 
laws and institutions, our time of life is relieved 
from those. tasks which ean not be supported 
without strength. Accordingly, so far are we 
from being compelled to do what we can not do 
that we are not even,compelled to do as much as 
we can. But so feeble are many old men that 
they can not execute. any task of duty or any 
function of life whatever; but that in truth is 
not the peculiar fault of old age, but belongs in 
eommon to bad health. How feeble was the son 
5 Masinissa, king of a small territory in northern Africa, 
was at first an ally of Oarthage against Rome, but afterward 
‘became en ally of Rome against Carthage.

and had that not been-so, he would have been the 
second luminary of the. state; for'to his paternal

if they are sometimes weak when even’ young men 
ean not escape that. one 
We must make a stand, Scipio and Lelius, 
against old age, and its faults must be atoned for. 
by activity; we must fight, as it were, against dis- - 
ease, and in like manner against old age. Regard 
must be paid to health; moderate exercises must 
be adopted; so much of meat and drink must be ~ 
taken that the strength may be recruited, not op- 
prest. Nor, indeed, must the:body alone be sup- 
ported, but the mind and.the soul much more; 
for these also, unless you drop oil on them as on 
a lamp, are extinguished by old age. And our 
bodies, indeed, by weariness and exercise, become 
opprest; but our minds are rendered buoyant by 
exercise. For as to those of whom Cacilius speaks, 
“foolish old men,” fit characters for comedy, by ~ 
these he denotes the credulous, the forgetful, the. 
dissolute, which are the faults not of old age, but, 
of inactive, indolent, drowsy old age. As petu-., 
lance and lust belong to the young more than to ' 
the old, yet not to all young men, but to those who 
are not virtuous; so that senile folly, which is 
commonly called dotage, belongs to weak old men, 
and not to all. Four stout sons, five daughters, 
so great a family, and such numerous dependents, 
did Appius manage, altho both old. and blind; for 
he kept his mind intent like a bow, nor did he 
languidly sink under the weight of old age. He.

  retained not only authority, but also command, 
over his family; the slaves feared him; the chil- 
dren respected him; all held him dear; there pre- 
vailed in that house the manners and good dis- 
cipline of our fathers. For on this condition is 
old age honored if it maintains itself, if it keeps 
up its own right, if it is subservient to no one, if 
even to its last breath it exercises control over its 
dependents, For, as I like a young man in whom 
there is something of the old, so I like an old man 
in whoni there is something of the young; and he 
who follows this maxim, in body will possibly be 
an old man, but he will never be an old man in 
mind, ,

me when I, a young man, was at Tarentum with 
Quintus Maximus. He said that no more deadly 
plague than the pleasure of the body was inflicted 
on men by nature; for the passions, greedy of 
that pleasure, were in a rash and unbridled: man- 
ner incited to possess it; that hence arose treasons: —

his influence with Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse. He 
was seven times general of the army of Tarentym: and suc- 
cessful in all bis campaigns; eminent also for domestic vir- 
tues. He is pronounced by a writer in Smith's “Dictionary” 
to have been “among the very greatest men: of antiquity.” -

  the undertaking of which the lust. of pleasure 
did not impel; but that fornications and adul- 
teries and every such crime were provoked by no 
other allurements than those of pleasure. ‘And 
whereas either nature or some god had given to 
man nothing more excellent than his mind, that to 
this divine function and gift, nothing was so hos- 
tile as pleasure; since where Inst bore sway, there 
‘was no room for self-restraint; and in the realm 
of pleasure, virtue could by no possibility exist. 
And that this might be the better understood, he 
begged you to imagine in your mind any one 
actuated by the greatest pleasure of the body that 
eould be enjoyed; he believed no one would doubt 
but that'so long as the person was in that state 
of delight, he would be able to consider nothing 
in his mind, to attain nothing by reason, nothing 
by reflection; wherefore that there was nothing so 
detestable and so destructive as pleasure, inas- 
much as that when it was excessive and very 
prolonged, it extinguished all the light of the 
soul. - 
Nearchus of Tarentum, our host, who had re- 
mained throughout in friendship with the Roman 
people, said he had heard from older men that 
Archytas held this conversation with Caius Pon- 
tius the Samnite, the father of him by whom, in 
the Caudian * battle, Spurius Postumius and Titus 
Veturius, the consuls, were overcome, on which 
occasion Plato the Athenian had been present at that discourse; and I find that he came to Taren-

pass that that should not be a Matter of pleasure 
which is not a matter of duty.'For pleasure is 
hostile to reason, hinders deliberation, and, so to 
speak, closes the eyes of the mind, nor does it hold 
any intercourse with virtue. I indeed acted reluc- 
tantly in expelling from the senate Lucius Flami- 
nius, brother of that very brave man Titus Fla- 
minius,” seven years after he had been Consul}..: 
       
but I thought that his licentiousness should be a 
stigmatized. For that man, when he was Consul

courtezan to behead one of those who were in

  lian that there was a certain person at Athens 
who profest himself a wise man,.and that he was 
aceustomed to say that all things which we did 
were to be referred to pleasure; and that hearing 
him say so, Manius Curius and Titus Coruncanius 
were ‘accustomed to wish that that might be the 
persuasion of the Samnites and Pyrrhus him- 
self, that they might the more easily be conquered 
when they had given themselves up to pleasure. 
Manius Curius had lived with Publius Decius, 
who, five years before the consulship of the for- 
mer, had devoted himself for the commonwealth 
in his fourth consulship. Fabricius had been ac- 
quainted with him, and Coruncanius had also 
known him, who, as well from his own conduct in 
life, as from the great action.of him whom I 
mention, Publius Decins, judged that there was 
doubtless something in its own nature excellent 
and glorious, which should be followed for its own 
sake, and which, scorning and despising pleasure, 
all the worthiest men pursued. . . . 
But why do I refer to others? Let me now 
return to myself. First of all, I always had asso- 
ciates in clubs; and clubs were established when I 
was questor, on the Idwan worship of the great 
mother being adopted. Therefore I feasted with 
my associates altogether in a moderate way, but 
there was a kind of fervor peculiar to that time 
of life, and as that advances, all things will. be- 
come every day more subdued. For I did not 
calculate the gratification of those banquets by 
the pleasures of the body so much as by the meet- *

value that they appear most to approve-df, . 
For my part, on account of the pleasure of 
conversation, I am delighted also with seasonable 
entertainments, not only with those of my own’ 
age, of whom very few survive, but with those of    
      
your age, and with you; and I give great thanks ~ 
to old age, which has increased my. desire for con- 
versation, and taken away: that of eating and 
drinking. But even if such things delight any 
person (that I may not appear altogether to have 
declared war against pleasure, of which perhaps 
a certain limited degree is even natural), IT am 
not aware that even in these pleasures themselves 
old age is without enjoyment. For my part, the 
presidencies established by our ancestors delight - : 
me; and that conversation, which after the man- 
ner of our ancestors, is kept up over our cups 
from the top of the table; and the cups, as in the 
Symposium of Xenophon, small and dewy, and 
the cooling of the wine in summer, and in turn ° 
either the sun, or the fire in winter—practises 
whith I am accustomed to follow among the Sa- 
pines also—and I daily join a party of neighbors, 
which we prolong with various conversation till 
late at night, as far as we can. But there.is not, 
‘as it were, so ticklish a sensibility. of pleasures 
in old men. ‘I believe it; but then neither is there 
the desire. However, nothing is itksome unless

you long for it. Well did Sophocles, when a cer- 
tain ‘man inquired of him advanced in age. whether 
he enjoyed venereal pleasures, reply, “The gods 
give me something better; nay, I have run away 
from them with gladness, as from a wild and fu- 
rious tyrant.” For to men fond of sneh things, 
it is Petbaps disagreeable and irksome to be with- 
out them; but to the contented and satisfied it is 
more delightful to want them than to enjoy them; 
and yet he does not want who feels no desire; 
therefore I say that this freedom from desire is 
more delightful than enjoyment. \ 
But if the prime of life has more eheerful en- 
joyment of those very pleasures, in the first place 
they are but petty objects which it enjoys, as I 
‘have said before; then they are those of which old 
age, if it. does not. abundantly possess them, is 
“not altogether destitute. As he is more delighted 
with Turpio Ambivius, who is spectator on the 
foremost bench, yet he also is delighted who is 
in the hindmost; so youth having a close view of 
pleasures is perhaps more gratified; but old age 
is as much delighted as is necessary in viewing 
them at @ distance. However, of what high value 
are the following circumstances, that the soul, 
after it has ‘served out, as it were, its time under 
lust, ambition, contention, enmities, and all the 
‘passions, shall retire within itself, and, as the 
“phrase is, live with itself? But if it has, as it 
_were, food for study and learning, nothing is 
more delightful than an old age of leisure. I saw 
Gas Gallus, the intimate friend of your father,

    mind to make the nearest approach to the life of 
a wise man. For they have relation to the earth, 
which never refuses command, and never returns 
without interest that which it hath received; but 
sometimes with less, generally with very great in-

and subdued bosom it has received the scattered 
seed, first of all confines what is hidden within it, 
from which harrowing, which produces that effect, 
derives its name (occatéo) ; then, when it is warmed 
by heat and its own compression, it spreads it 
out, and elicits from it the verdant blade, which, 
supported by the fibers of the roots, gradually 
ws up, and, rising on a jointed stalk, is now 
enclosed in a sheath, as if it were of tender age, 
out of which, when it hath shot up, it then pours

is guarded by a rampart of beards against the

of corn-fields only and meadows‘and vineyards

also for the feeding of cattle, the swarms of bees, 
and the variety of all kinds of flowers.. Nor do

duty, because to the whole race of mankind the 
cultivation of the land is beneficial; but also from 
' the amusement, which I have mentioned, and that 
fplness and abundance. of all things which are 
connected with the food of men, and also with 
the worship of the gods; so that, since some have 
a desire for these things, we may again put our-

And yet, good gods! what is there in man’s life 
that can be called long? For allow. the latest pe- 
riod; let us anticipate the age of the kings of 
Tartessii. For there dwelt, as I find it recorded, 
a man named Arganthonius at Gades;* who 
reigned for eighty years, and lived 120. But to 
my mind, nothing whatever seems of long dura- 
tion to which there is any end. For when that 
arrives, then the time which has passed has flown 
away; that only remains which you have secured 
by virtue and right conduct. Hours indeed depart 
from us, and days and months and years; nor 
does past time ever return, nor can it be diseov- 
ered what is to follow. Whatever time is assigned 
to each to live, with that he ought to be content; 
for neither need the drama be performed entire 
by the actor in order to give satisfaction, provided 
he be approved in whatever act he may be; nor 
need the wise man live till the plaudite. For the 
short period of life is long enough for living well 
and honorably; and if you should advance fur- 
ther, you need no more grieve than farmers do

it is that that short remnant of life should be

wishes, I suppose, that he should be dear to his

not say with more propriety,

He conceives that a death ought not to be lament-

man may have some degree of consciousness, but 
that for a short time, especially in the case of an

  iar to boyhood; do therefore young men regret 
the loss of them? There are also some of early 
youth; does settled age, which is called middle 
life, seek after these? There are also some of 
this period; neither are they looked for by old 
age. There are some final pursuits of old age; ac- 
cordingly, as the pursuits of the earlier parts of 
life fall into disuse, so also do those of old age; 
and when this has taken place, satiety of life 
brings on the seasonable period of death. 
Indeed, I do not see why I should not venture 
to tell you what I myself think concerning death; 
because I faney I see it.so much the more clearly 
in proportion as I am less distant from it. I am 
persuaded that your fathers, Publius Scipio and 
Caius Lelius, men of the greatest eminence and 
very dear friends of mine, are living, and that 
life too which alone deserves the name of life. 
For while we are shut up in this prison of the 
body, we are fulfilling, as it were, the function 
and painful task of destiny; for the heaven-born 
soul has been degraded from its dwelling-place 
above, and, as it were, buried. in the earth, a situ- 
ation uncongenial to its divine and immortal na- 
ture. But I believe that the immortal gods have 
shed souls into human bodies, that beings might 
exist who might tend the earth, and by contem- 
plating the order of the heavenly bodies might 
imitate it in the manner and regularity of their 
lives. Nor have reason and argument alone in- 
fiuenced me thus to believe, but likewise the high 
name and authority of the greatest philosophers. 
I used to hear that Pythagoras and the Pytha- 
goreans, who were all but our neighbors, who 
were formerly called the Italian philosophers, had 
30
-P-A-G-E-42
  CICERO 
  no doubt that we possess souls derived from the 
universal divine mind. Moreoy@r,. tne arguments 
were conclusive to me which Soerates delivered on 
the last day of his life concerning:the immortality 
of the soul—he who was pronoun the oracle 
of Apollo the wisest of all men:;\But why say 
more? I have thus persuaded mypelf, such is my 
belief; that since such is the activity of our souls, 
so tenacious their memory of things. past and 
their sagacity regarding things future, so many 
arts, so many sciences, so many discoveries, that 
  the nature which comprizes these qualities ean 
not be mortal; and since the mind is ever in action " 
and has no source of motion, because it moves 
itself, I believe that it never will find any end of 
motion, because it never will. part from itself; 
and that. since the nature of the soul is uncom- 
pounded, and bas not in itself any admixture 
heterogeneous and dissimilar to itself, I maintain 
that it can not undergo dissolution; and if. this be 
  not possible, it ean not perish; and it. is a ~ 
strong argument that men know very many things 
before they are born, since when mere boys, while, 
they are learning difficult subjects, they so quickly: 
cateh up numberless ideas, that they seem not to 4     
be learning them then for the first time, but to 
remember them, and to be calling them to reeol 
lection. Thus did our Plato argue. 
Let me, if you please, revert to my own views. — . 
No one will ever persuade me that either your 
father, Paulus, or two grandfathers, Paulus and 
Africanus, or the father of Africanus, or his un- 
cle, or the many distinguished men whom it is 
unnecessary to recount, aimed at such great ex: 
ploits as might reach to the recollection of pos-

  terity had they not perceived in ‘their. mind that 
posterity belonged to them. Do you suppose, to 
boast a little of myself, after the manner of old 
men, that I should have undergone such great 
toils, by day and night, at home and in service, 
had I thought to limit my glory by the same 
bounds as my life? Would it not have been far 
better to pass an easy and quiet life without any 
toil or struggle? But I know not how my soul, 
stretching upward, has ever looked forward to 
posterity, as if, when it had departed from life, 
then at last it wonld begin to live, And, indeed, 
unless this were the case, that souls were im- 
mortal, the souls of the noblest of men would not 
aspire above all things to an immortality of glory. 
“Why need I adduce that the wisest man ever dies 
with the greatest equanimity, the most foolish 
with the least? Does it-not seem to you that the 
soul, which sees more and further, sees that it is 
passing to a better state, while that body whose 
vision is duller, does not see it? I, indeed, am 
i with eagerness to see your fathers, 
whom I have respected and loved; nor in truth 
is it those only I desire to meet whom I myself 
have known; but those also of whom I have heard 
or read, and have myself written. Whither, in- 
deed, as I proceed, no one assuredly should easily 
foree me back, nor, as they did with Pelias, cook 
me again to youth. For if any god should grant 
me that from this period of life I should become 
a child again and cry in the eradle, I should ear- 
nesily refuse it; nor in truth should I like, after 
having run, as it were, my course, to be called 
back to the starting-place from the For

to expire at his fit time. For, as nature prescribes 
a boundary to all other things, so does she also 
to life. Now old age is the consummation of life, 
just as of a play, from the fatigue of which we 
ought to escape, especially when satiety is super- 
added. This is what I had to say on the subject

- as “one of the most profligate men of a profligate age.” She 
was divorced from Dolabella in 44 B.0., gave birth to a son 
soon afterward, and died in the same year. Cicero's letter 
‘was written in reply to one which he had received from Ser- 
vius Sulpicius, a celebrated Roman jurist. Cicero intended to erect @ temple aga memorial to Tullia, but the death of Cesar and the unsettled state of public affairs that ensued, and in 
which Cicero was concerned, prevented him from doing so.

my grief, I readily perceive from the fact that 
after reading your letter I now feel myself eon- 
siderably more composed; for. not’ only was all 
that you wrote just what is. hest! calculated to soothe affliction, but you comforting 
me showed that you too had no littlépain at heart. 
Your son Servius, however, has made it‘clear, by 
every kindly attention which such ‘an. occasion 
would permit of, both how great his respect. was 
for myself and also how much pleasure his kind 
feeling for me was likely to give you; and you 
may be sure that, while such attentions from bim

never made me more grateful,

your equal share—I may almost call it—in this 
affliction which comforts me, but-also your au- 
thority; becanse I hold it shame in me not to be

used to earn from their country, -.

For me, however, after being stript of all those 
distinctions which you yourself recall to.me, and 
which I had won for myself by ung leled ex- 
ertions, only that one solace ined. which has 
been torn away. My thoughts were not diverted 
by work for my friends, or by the administration of 
affairs of state; there was no pleasure in pleading 
in the courts; I could not bear the very sight of 
the Senate House; I felt, as was indeed too true, 
that I had lost all the harvest of both my industry 
and my suecess. But whenever I wanted to recol- 
lect that all this was shared with you and other 
friends I could name, and whenever I was break- 
ing myself in and forcing my spirit to bear these 
things with patience, I always had a refuge to go 
to where I might find peace, and in whose words 
of comfort and sweet society I could rid we of all 
my pains and griefs. Whereas now, under this 
terrible blow, even those old wounds which seemed 
to have healed up are bleeding afresh; for it is 
impossible for me now to find such a refuge from 
my sorrows at home in the business of the state 
as in those days I did in that consolation of home, 
which was always in store whenever I eame away 
sad from thoughts of state to seek for peace in her 
happiness. And so I stay away both from home 
and from: publie life; because home now is no 
more able to make up for the sorrow I feel when 
I think of our country than our country is for 
my.sorrow at home. I am therefore looking for- 
ward all the more eagerly to your coming, and Tong to see you as early as may possibly be; no greater alleviation can be offered me than a meet- ing between us for friendly. intercourse and con- versation. I hope, however, that your return is to

TH 
OF BRAVE AND ELEVATED SPIRITS” 
‘A sprarr altogether brave and elevated is chiefly 
discernible by two characters. The first consists 
in a low estimate of mere outward circumstances, 
since it is convinced that a man ought to admire, 
desire, or court nothing but what is virtuous . : 
becoming; and that he ought to suceumb to no 
man, nor to any perturbation either of spirit or 
fortune. The other thing is that, possest of such 
a spirit as I have just mentioned, you should per- 
form actions which are great and of the greatest . 
utility, bat extremely arduous, full of difficulties

Edmonds. .

  and danger both to life and the many things which 
pertain to life. ‘ 
In the latter of those two characters consist 
all the glory, the-majesty, and, I add, the utility; 
but the causes and the efficient means. that form 
great men is in the former, which contains the 
prineiples that elevate the soul, and gives it a 
contempt for temporary considerations. Now, 
this very excellence consists in two particulars: 
you are to deem that only to be good is to be 
virtuous, and that you be free from all mental 
irregularity. For we are to look upon it as the 
character of a noble and an elevated soul, to slight 
all those considerations that the generality of 
mankind account great and glorious, and to de- 
spise them, upon firm and durable principles; 
while streigth of mind and greatness of resolu- 
tion are discerned in bearing those calamities 
which, in the course of man’s life, are many and 
various, so as not to be driven from your natural 
disposition, nor from the dignity of a wise man; 
for it is not consistent that he who is not subdued 
by fear should be subjugated by passion, nor that 
he who.has shown himself invincible by toil 
should be conquered by pleasure. Wherefore, we 
ought to watch and avoid the love of money; for 
nothing so truly characterizes a narrow, groveling 
disposition as to love riches; and nothing is more 
noble and more exalted than to despise riches if 
you have them not, and if you have them, to em- 
ploy them in beneficence and liberality. 
“An inordinate passion for glory, as I have al- 
ready observed, is likewise to be guarded against ; 
for it deprives us of liberty, the only prize for 
which men of elevated sentiments ought to con-

free from all disorders of the mind): 
lent passion and fear, as well ad: 
jousness, and anger, that we may. possess 
tranquillity and security which “canter slike eon- 
sistency and dignity. Now, many there are, and 
have been, who, courting that tranquillity which 
I have mentioned here,- have withdrawn them- 
selves from publie affairs and taken refuge in 
retirement. Among: these, some of the noblest 
and most prominent of our philosophers; and. 
some persons, of strict and grave dispositions, were . 
unable to bear with the manners either of. the 
people or their rulers; and-some have lived in the 
country, amusing themselves with the manage- 
ment of their private affairs. Their aim was the 
same as that of the powerful, that they might — | 
enjoy their liberty, without wanting anything or — 
obeying any person; for the essence of liberty is _ 
to live just as you please. . . : 
But, since most persons are of opinion that the © 
achievements of war are more glorious than civil: 
affairs, this judgment needs to be restricted; for. . 
many, as generally is the case with high minds.” — 
and enterprising spirits, especially if they are 
adapted to military life and are fond of warlike. 
achievements, have often sought opportunities of 
war from their fondness for glory; but if we are 
willing to judge truly, many are the civil employ- 
ments of greater importance, and of more renown, 
than the military. : 
For tho Themistocles is justly praised — his 
name is now more illustrious than that of Solon,

and his glorious victory at Salamis.is mentioned 
preferably to the policy of Solon, by which he 
first confirmed the power of the Axeopagnus—the 
one should not be considered more illustrious than 
the other; for the one availed his country only 
for once—the other is lastingly advantageous; 
because by it the laws of the Athenians, and the 
institutions of their ancestors, are preserved. 
Now, Themistocles could not have stated any re- 
spect in which he benefited the Areopagus, but 
Solon might with truth declare that Themistocles 
had been advantaged by him; for the war was 
earried' on by the counsels of that senate which 
was: constituted hy Solon. : 
We may make the same observation with regard 
to Pausanias ™ and Lysander among the Lacede- 
‘ monidns; for all the addition of empire which 
their ‘conquests are supposed to have brought to 
their country is not to be compared to the laws 
and economy of Lyecurgus; for indeed, owing to 
these very causes they had armies more subor- 
dinate and courageous. In my eyes, Marcus Seau- 
rus'(who flourished when I was but a boy) was not 
inferior to Caius Marius;.” nor, after I came to 
have a concern in the government, Quintus Catu-

Now all that excellence which springs from a’ 
lofty and noble nature is altogether produced by 
the mental and not by the corporeal powers. 
Meanwhile, the body ought to be kept in such 
action and order as that it may be always ready 
to obey the dictates of reason and wisdom, in 
earrying them into execution, and in persevering 
under hardships. But with regard to that hones- 
tas we are treating of, it. consists wholly in the 
thoughtful application of the mind, by which the 
civilians who preside over public affairs are equal-    
ly serviceable to their country as they who wage” 
wars. For it often happens that by such coun-) » 
sels wars are either not entered into or they are, 
brought to a termination; sometimes they are even... 
undertaken, as the third Punie war was by the 
advice of Marcus Cato, whose authority was 
powerful, even after he was dead. 
% Nasica, “a fierce and stiff-necked aristocrat,” was of the 
family of Scipios. When the consuls refused to resort to - 
violence against Tiberius Gracchus, it was. he who led tho, 
senators forth from their meeting-place againat the popular 
assembly outside, with whom ensued a fight, in which Grec- 
ehus was killed by a blow from a club. Nasica left Rome 
soon after, seeking sefety. After spending some time as a 
wandering exile, he died at Pergamua.

  Wisdom in determining is therefore preferable 
to courage in fighting; but: in this we are to take 
eare that we are not swayed by an aversion to 
fighting rather than by a consideration of ex- 
pediency. Now in engaging in war we ought to 
make it appear that we have no other view than 
peace. But the character of a brave and resolute 
man is not to be raffled with adversity, and not to 
be in such confusion as to quit his post, as we 
say, but to preserve a-presence of mind, and the 
exercise of reason, without departing from his 
purpose. And while this is the characteristic of 
a lofty spirit, so this also is that of a powerful 
intellect; namely, to anticipate futurity in 
thought, and to conelude beforehand what may 
happen on either side, and, upon that, what meas- 
tures to pursue, and never be surprized so as to 
say, “I had not thought of that.” Such are the 
operations of a genius, capacious and elevated; of 
-such a one as relies on its own prudence and 
- counsel; but to rush preeipitately into the field, 
and to encounter an enemy with mere physical 
force. has somewhat in it that is barbarous and 
brutal.. When the occasion, however, and its ne- 
cessity compel it, we should resist with force, and 
prefer death to slavery or dishonor.

degree almost as remarkable as his father had been with the 
elder. The younger, immortalized by Cicero's treatise on 
Friendship, was born about 186 B.c., and was a man of fine 
culture noted as an orator. His personal worth was so gen-

he had chosen to wish for immortality, of which 
he had not the slightest thought, what did he fail 
to obtain which it was lawful for a man to wish 
for? A man who, as soon as he grew up, by his 
transcendent merit far surpassed those sanguine 
hopes of his countrymen which they had con- 
ceived regarding him when a mere boy, who never 
stood for the consulship, yet was made Consul 
twice; on the first occasion, before his time; on 
the second, at the proper age as regarded himself, 
tho for the commonwealth almost too late; who, 
by overthrowing two cities,” most hostile to our

be the fact, that the spirit of the best man miost

as the hope that the recollection of our friendship 
will last forever. And it is the more gratifying to 
me beeause scarcely in the history of the world are 
. three or four pairs of friends mentioned by name; 
. and I indulge in the hope that the friendship of 
Scipio and Lelius will be remembered. : 
TI can only urge you to prefer friendship to 
all. human possessions; for there is nothing so 
suited to our nature, so well adapted to prosperity 
or adversity. But first of all, I am of opinion 
that except among the virtuous friendship can 
not’ exist; I do not analyze this principle too close- 
ly, as they do who inquire with too great nicety 
into those things, perhaps with truth on their side, 
but with little general advantage; for they main- 
tain that there is no good man but the wise man. 
Be: it so, yet they define wisdom to be such as no 
mortal has ever attained to; whereas we ought to 
contemplate those things which exist in practise 
and in common life, and not the subjects of fic- 
tions or of our own wishes. I would never pre- 
tend to say that Caius Fabricius, Marius Curius, 
and Titus Coruncanius, whom our ancestors es- 
teemed wise, were wise according to the standard 
of. these moralists. Wherefore let them keep to 
themselves the name of wisdom, hoth invidious 
and unintelligible, and let: them allow that these 
were good men—nay, they will not even do that; 
they will declare that this can not be granted ex- 
‘cept to a wise man.

  Let us therefore proceed with our dull genius, 
as they say. Those who so conduct themselves 
and so live that their. honor; théix integrity, their 
justice, and liberality are apprové 
is not in them any covetousness, .or:licentiousness, 
or boldness; and that they are of: 
sistency, as those men whom I-hav 
above—let us consider these worthy, 
pellation of good men, as they have been accounted 
such, because they follow. (as far as men are 
able) nature, which is the best guide of a good 
life. For I seem to myself to have this view, that 
we are so formed by nature that there should be 
a certain social tie among all; stronger, however, 
as each approaches nearer us.. Accordingly, citi- 
zens are preferable to foreigners, and relatives 
to strangers; for with the last-named, Nature 
herself has created a friendly feeling, tho: this 
has not sufficient strength. For in: this respect, 
friendship is superior to relationship, because 
from relationship benevolence can be withdrawn 
and from friendship it ean not; for with the with-.- 
drawal of benevolence the very name of friend- - 
ship is done away, while that of relationship re- 
mains. Now how great the power of friendship’ 
is may be best gathered from this consideration, - 
that out of the boundless society of the human 
race, which Nature herself has joined together, 
friendship is a matter so contracted, and brought 
into so narrow a compass, that the whole of affec- 
tion is confined to two, or at any rate to’ very few. 
Now friendship is nothing else than a complete 
union of feeling on all subjects, divine and hu- 
man, accompanied by kindly. feeling and attach- 
ment, than which, indeed, I am not aware whether,

  with the exception of wisdom, anything better has 
been bestowed on man by the immortal gods. Some 
men prefer riches, others good health, others in- 
fluence, others again honors, many prefer even 
pleasures; the last, indeed, is the characteristic of 
beasts; while the former are fleeting and uncer- 
tain, depending not so muck on our own purpose 
as on the fickleness of fortune. Whereas those 
who place the supreme good in virtue, therein do 
admirably; but this very virtue itself both begets 
and constitutes friendship; nor without this virtue 
can friendship exist at all. Now let us define this 
virtue according to the usage of life and of our 
common language; and let us not measure it, as 
certain learned persons do, by pomp of language; 
and Jet us include among the good those who are 
sé accounted—the Paulli, the Catos, the Galli, 
the Seipios, and the Phili; with these men or- 
dinary life is content; and let us pass over those 
who are nowhere found to exist. Among men of 
this kind, therefore, friendship finds facilities so 
great that I can scarcely describe them. 
In the first place—to whom can life be “worth 
living,” as Ennius says, who does not repose on 
the mutial. kind feeling of some friend? What 
can be more delightful than to have one to whom 
you ean speak on all subjects just as to yourself? 
‘Where ‘would be the great enjoyment in pros- 
perity if you had not one to rejoice in it equally 
with yourself? And adversity would indeed be 
difficult to endure without some one who would 
bear it even with greater regret than yourself. 
In short, all other objects.that are sought after 
are ‘severally suited to some one single purpose—

friendship. And I am not now speaking of com-~, 
monplace or ordinary friendship (tho even. that 
brings delight and benefit), but of real and true | 
friendship, such as belonged to .those. of whom . 
very few are recorded; for prosperity, friendship 
renders more brilliant, and. adversity more sup- 
portable, by dividing and communicating it. 
And while friendship embraces very many and 
great advantages, she undoubtedly surpasses all in 
this, that she shines with a brilliant hope over the 
future, and never suffers the spirit to be weakened 
or to sink. Besides, he who looks on a true friend 
looks, as it were, upon.a kindof image of him- 
self; wherefore friends, tho absent, are still pres-_ 
ent; tho in poverty, they are rich; tho weak, ° 
yet in the enjoyment of health;. and, what is still; 
more difficult to assert, tho dead they are alive; so 
entirely does the honor, the memory, the regret of 
friends attend them; from which. circumstance 
the death of the one seems to be happy, and the 
life of the other. praiseworthy; nay, should you 
remove from. nature the, cement of kind feelings, 
neither a house nor a. city: will be able to stand; 
even the cultivation of the land will not continue.

for what house is there so established, or what 
state so firmly settled, that may not utterly be 
overthrown by hatred and dissension? From 
which it may be determined how much advantage 
there is in friendship. They relate, indeed, that 
a eertain learned man of Agrigentum™ promul- 
gated in Greek verses the doctrine that all things 
which cohere throughout the whole world, and 
all things that are the subjects of motion, are 
brought together by friendship, and are dis- 
pelled by discord; and this principle all men 
understand, and illustrate by their conduct. 
Therefore, if at any time any act of a friend has 
been exhibited, either in undergoing or in shar- 
ing dangers, who is there that does not extol 
soch' an act with the highest praise? . . . 
- Now if such be the influence of integrity, that 
we- love it even in those whom we have never 
seen, and, what is much more, even in an enemy, 
what wonder if men’s feelings are affected when 
they seem to discover the goodness and virtue 
of those with whom they may beeome connected 
by intercourse? altho love is confirmed by the 
reception ‘of kindness, and by the discovery of 
an earnest sympathy, and by close familiarity, 
which things being added to the first emotion of 
‘the mind and the affections, there is kindled a 
large amount of kindly feeling. And if any

tho many and great advantages ensued, yet it’. 
was not from any hope of these that the causes" 
of our attachment sprang; for as we are benef- ¢ 
icent and liberal not to exact favor in return 
(for we are not usurers in kind actions), but: by 
nature are inclined to liberality, thus I think 
that friendship is to be desired, not attracted 
by the hope of reward, but because the whole of 
its profit consists in love only, From such opin- 
ions, they who, after the fashion of beasts, refer 
everything to pleasure, widely differ, and no

. Therefore let us exclude such persons alto- 
gether from our discourse; and let us ourselves 
hold this opinion, that the sentiment of loving 
and the attachment of kind feelings are pro- 
duced by nature when the evidence of virtue has 
been established; and they who have eagerly 
sought the last-named draw nigh and attach 
themselves to it, that they may enjoy the friend- 
ship and character of the individual they have 
begun to love, and that they may be commen- 
surate and equal in affection, and more inclined 
to eonfer.a favor than to claim any return. And 
_ let. this honorable struggle be maintained be- 
-. tween them; so not only will the greatest ad- 
vantages be derived from friendship, but its 
origin from nature rather than from a sense of 
weakness will be at once more impressive and 
more true. For if it were expediency that 
cemented friendships, the same when changed 
would dissolve them; but because nature can 
never change, therefore true friendships are 
eternal. . . . 
Listen, then, my excellent friends, to the dis- 
cussion which was very frequently held by me 
and Scipio on the subject of friendship; altho he 
indeed used to say that nothing was more dif- 
ficult than that friendship should continue to the

that they held different views-of politics; he re-

  “Let this, therefore, be established asa primary 
law concerning friendship, that we from 
our friends only what is honorable,'and for our 
. friends’ sake do what is honorable; that we 
should not wait till we are asked; that zeal be 
ever ready, and reluctance far from us; but that 
we take pleasure in freely giving our advice; 
that in our friendship, the influence of our 
friends, when they give good advice, should have ~ 
great weight; and that this be employed to ad- 
monish not only candidly, but even severely, if 
the case shall require, and that we give heed to 
it when so employed; for, as to certain persons 
whom I understand to have been esteemed wise 
‘men in Greece, I am of opinion that some 
strange notions were entertained by them; but 
there is nothing which they do not. follow up 
with ‘too great subtlety; among the rest, that 
excessive friendships should be avoided, lest it 
should be necessary for one to feel anxiety for 
many; that every one has enough, and more than 
enough, of his own affairs; that to be needlessly

that it was most convenient to hold the reins of

tighten or slacken them when you please; for

not enjoy if one man be, as it were, in travail

  feeling or affection; and theréfore the less a 
man possesses of independence:tind of strength, 
jn the same degree he most#arnestly desires 
friendships; that thence it arises: that women 
seek the support of friendship, more: than men, 
and the poor more’than the rich,‘and persons in 
distress rather than those who -are- considered 
prosperous. Admirable philosophy!. for, they 
seem to take away the sun from the' world who 
withdraw friendship from life; for we receive 
nothing better from the immortal gods, nothing 
more delightful; for what is this freedom from 
care?—in appearances, indeed, flattering; but, 
in many eases, in reality to be disdained. Nor 
is it reasonable to undertake any honorable mat- 
ter or action lest you should be’ anxious, or to 
lay it aside when undertaken; for if we fly from 
care, we must fly from virtue also; for it is im- 
possible that she can, without some degree of 
distress, feel contempt and detestation for quali- 
ties opposed to herself; just as kind-heartedness 
for malice, temperance for profligacy, and bra-. 
very for cowardice. Accordingly, you see that . 
upright men are most distrest by unjust actions; 
the brave with the cowardly; the virtuous with, 
the profligate; and, therefore, this is the charag- 
teristic of a well-regulated mind, both to be well 
pleased with what is excellent and to be distrest 
with what is contrary. Wherefore, if trouble 
of mind befall a wise man (and assuredly it will, 
unless we suppose that all humanity is extir- 
pated from his mind), what reason is there why 
we should altogether remove friendship from 
life, lest because of it we should take upon our- 
selves some troubles? for what difference is

there: (setting the emotions of the mind aside), 
I-do not say between a*man and a beast, but 
between a man and a stone, or log, or anything 
of- that kind? For they do not: deserve to be 
listened to who would have virtue to be callous 
and made of iron, as it were, which indeed is, 
as in other matters, so in friendship also, tender 
and susceptible; so that friends are loosened, as 
it were, by happy events, and drawn together by 
distresses. 
Wherefore the anxiety which has often to be 
felt for a friend is not of such foree that it 
should remove friendship from the world, any 
more than that the virtues, because they bring 
with them certain cares and . troubles, should 
therefore be discarded. For when it produces 
friendship {as I said above), should any indica- 
tion of virtue shine forth, to which a congenial 
mind may attach and unite itself—when this 
happens, affection must necessarily arise. For 
what is ‘so unmeaning as to take delight in many 
vain things, such as preferments, glory, mag- 
nificent buildings, clothing and adornment of the 
body, and not to take an extreme delight in a 
soul endued with virtue, in such a soul as can 
either. love or (80 to speak) love in return? for 
there ‘is. nothing more delightful than the re- 
payment of kindness and the interchange of 
devotedness and good offices. Now if we add 
this, which may with propriety be added, that 
nothing so allures and draws any object to itself 
as congeniality does friendship, it will of course 
be admitted as true that the good must love the 
good, and unite them to themselves, just as if 
connected by relationship and nature; for noth-

nature. Wherefore this certaiilyis clear, Fan- 
ning and Servola (in my ‘opinion), that among 
the good a liking for the good.’ it wete,.in- 
evitable; and this indeed is apyokited: by Nature 
herself as the very fountain. of: friendship.- 
But the same kind disposition’ belongs also ‘to 
the multitude; for virtue is not inhuman, or 
eruel, or haughty, since she is accustomed. to 
protect even whole nations, and to adopt the best : 
measures for their welfare, which assuredly she | 
would not do did she shrink from the affection 
of the vulgar, And to myself, indeed, those who-   
          form friendships with a view to advantage seem =~ 
to do away with its most endearing bond; for it 
is not so much the advantage obtained through 
a friend as the mere love of that friend which 
delights; and then only what has proceeded from 
a friend becomes delightful if it has proceeded 
from zealous affection; and that friendship 
should be cultivated from a sense of necessity 
is so far from being the ease that those who, . 
being endowed with power and wealth, ahd: 
especially with virtue (in which is the strongest 
support ‘of friendship), have least need of an- 
other, are most liberal and generous. Yet J am 
not sure whether it is requisite that friends, 
should never stand in any need; for wherein 
would any devotedness of mine to him have been 
exerted if Scipio had never stood in need of my 
advice or assistance at home or abroad? Where-

that his army ought not otherwise to-be led over. 
He devised this plan of a bridge: ‘he joined to- 
gether, at the distance of two feet, two piles, 
each.a foot and half thick, sharpened a little at 
the lower end, and proportioned in length to the 
depth of the river. : 
After he had, by means of engines, sunk these 
into the river, and fixt them at the bottom, and 
then driven them in with rammers, not quite per- 
pendicularly, like a-stake, but bending forward 
and sloping, so as to incline in the direction of 
the current of thé river; he also placed two 
[other. piles] opposite to these, at the distance 
of forty feet lower down, fastened together in 
the same manner, but directed against the force 
and current of the river. Both these, moreover, 
were kept firmly apart by beams two feet thick 
(the space which the binding of the piles oc- 
eupied), laid in at their extremities between 
two braces on each side; and in consequence 
_of these being in different directions and fast- 
ed‘on sides the one opposite to the other, so 
reat was the strength of the work, and such the 
arrangement of the materials, that in proportion 
as the greater body of water dashed against the 
bridge, so much the closer were its parts held 
fastened together. These beams were bound to- 
gether by timber laid over them in the direction 
- of the length of the bridge, and “were [then]> 
. Govered with laths and hurdles; and, in addition 
to this, piles were driven into the water ob-

Within ten days after the timber began to. be 
collected, the whole work was completed; and 
the whole army led over. Caesar, leaving & 
strong guard at each end of the bridge, hastens . 
into the territories of the Sigambri. In the mean 
time, ambassadors from several nations come 
to him, whom, on their suing for peace'and al- 
liance, he answers in a courteous manner, and 
orders hostages to be brought to him. But the 
Sigambri, at the very time the bridge was begun 
to be built, made preparations for a flight (by 
the advice of such of the Tenchtheri and Usi- 
pétes as they had among them), and quitted 
their territories and conveyed away all their 
possessions, and concealed themselves in deserts 
and woods. 
Cesar, having remained in their territories a 
few days, and burned all their villages and 
houses, and eut down their corn, proceeded into 
the territories of the Ubii; and having promised , 
them his assistance, if they were ever harassed 
by the Suevi,’ he learned from them these par- 
ticulars: that the Suevi, after they had by means 
of their scouts found that the bridge ‘Was 
being built, had called a council, according to

state to remove from the towns and convey their 
ehildren, wives, and all their possessions into the 
woods, and that all who could bear arms should 
assemble in one place; that the place thus chosen 
was nearly the center of those regions which the 
Suevi possest; that in this spot they had re- 
solved to await the arrival of the Romans, and 
give them battle there. When Cawsar discovered 
this, having already. accomplished all these 
things on account of which he had resolved to 
lead his army. over—namely, to strike fear into 
the- Germans, take vengeance on the Sigambri, 
and free the Ubii from the invasion of the Suevi, 
having «spent altogether. eighteen days beyond 
the Rhine, and thinking he had. advanced far 
enough to serve both honor and interest—he re- 
turned into Gaul, and. cut down the bridge.

all of whom are called by’ the ‘names of those 
states from which being sprithg. they went 
thither, and having waged war,’ continued there 
and began to cultivate the lands,’ The number 
of the people is countless, and’ their: buildings 
exceedingly numerous, for the most part very ~ 
like those of the Gauls; the number of cattle is 
great. They use either brass or iron rings, de-.. 
termined at a certain weight, as their money. 
Tin is produced in the midland regions; in the 
maritime, iron; but the quantity of it is small; 
they employ brass, which is imported. There, 
as in Gaul, is timber of every description, except 
beech and fir. They do not. regard it lawful to 
eat the hare and the cock and the goose; they, 
however, breed them for amusement and pleas- 
ure. The climate is more temperate than in 
Gaul, the cold being less severe. . 
The island is triangular in its form, and one 
of its sides is opposite to Gaul. One angle of 
this side, which is in Kent, whither almost all 
ships from Gaul are directed, [looks] to the east 
the lower looks to the south. This side extends 
about 500 miles, Another side lies toward Spain, 
and the west, on which part is Ireland, less, as 
is reckoned, than Britain, by one half; but ‘the 
passage [from it] into Britain is of equal dis- 
tance with that from Gaul. In the middle of |

lie [there], of which islands some have written

inquiries about that matter, ascertained nothing, 
‘except that, by accurate measurements with 
water, we perceived the nights to be shorter 
there than on the continent. The length of this 
side, as their account states, is 700 miles. The 
third side is toward the north, to which portion 
of the island no land is opposite; but an angle 
of that side looks principally toward Germany. 
This side is considered to be 800 miles in length. 
Thus the whole island is [about] 2,000 miles in 
circumference. 
The most. civilized of all these nations are 
they who inhabit Kent, which is entirely a mari- 
time district, nor do their customs differ much 
from Gallic. Most of the inland inhabitants 
do. not sow corn, but live.on milk and flesh, 
and. are clad with skins. All the Britains, 
indeed, dye themselves with wood, which occa- 
sions a bluish color, and thereby have a more 
terrible appearance in fight. They wear their 
hair long, and have every part of their body 
shaved: except their head and upper lip. Ten 
and even twelve have wives common. to them, 
and particularly brothers among brothers, and 
parents, among their children; but if there be 
any issue by these wives, they are reputed to be 
the children of those by whom respectively each

    men. However, the erlemy, aftersome time had 
elapsed, when our men were off their guard, and 
occupied in the fortification’ “of the camp, 
rushed out of the woods, and making an attack 
upon those who were placed on duty before the 
camp, fought in a determined manner; and two 
cohorts being sent by Cwsar to their relief, and 
these severally the first of two legions, when - 
these had taken up their position at @ very 6 
distance from each other, as our men were dis- 
concerted by the unusual mode of battle, ‘the. 
enemy broke through the middle of them most.. 
courageously, and retreated -thence: in safety. 
That day, Q. Laberius Durus, a tribune of the 
soldiers, was slain. The enemy, since more ¢o- 
horts were sent against them, were repulsed. 
In the whole of this method of fighting since 
the engagement took place under the eyes of all 
and before the camp, it was perceived that our 
men, on account of the weight of their arms, .. 
inasmuch as they could neither pursne [the er- — 
emy when] retreating, nor dare quit their stand- . 
ards, were little suited to this kind of enemy; 
that the horse also fought with great danger, .— 
because they [the Britons] generally retreated 
even designedly, and, when they had drawn ‘off 
our men a short distance from the legions, leapt’ ° 
from their chariots and fought on foot in un-: 
equal [and to-them advantageous] battle. But’ 
the system of cavalry engagement is wont to 
. produce equal danger, and indeed the same, both 
to those who retreat and those who pursue. To 
this was added, that they never fought in close 
order, but in small parties and at great dis- 
tances, and had detachments placed [in different

    parts], and then the one relieved the other, and 
the vigorous and fresh succeeded the wearied. 
The following day the enemy halted on the 
hills, a distance from our camp, and presented 
_ themselves in small parties, and began to chal- 
lenge our horse to battle with less spirit than 
the day before. But at noon, when Cesar had 
sent three legions, and all the cavalry with C. 
Trebonius, the lieutenant, for the purpose of 
foraging, they flew upon the foragers suddenly 
from all quarters, so that they did not keep off 
[even] from the standards and the legions. Our 
men, making an attack on them vigorously, re- 
pulsed. them; nor did they cease to pursue them 
until the horse, relying on relief, as they saw 
the legions behind them, drove the enemy pre- 
cipitately before them, and, slaying a great num- 
ber of them, did not give them the opportunity 
either of rallying, or halting, or leaping from 
their chariots. After this retreat the auxiliaries 
‘departed; nor after that time did the enemy 
ever engage with us in very large numbers. 
Caisar, discovering their design, leads his army 
into the territories of Cassivelaunus * to the river 
Thames, which river can be forded in one place 
only, and that with difficulty. When he had 
arrived there, he perceives that numerous forces 
of the enemy were marshaled on the other bank 
of the river;.the bank also was defended by

the river. These things being, discovered from 
[some] prisoners and deserters;Casar, sending 
forward the cavalry, ordered. the legions to fol- 
low them immediately.. But.the soldiers ad- 
vanced with such. speed and such ardor, tho they 
stood above the water by their heads only, that 
the enemy could not sustain the attack of :the 
legions and of the horse, and quitted the banks, 
and committed themselves to flight. oe, 
Cassivelaunus, as we have stated above, all 
hope [rising out] of battle being laid aside, the. 
greater part of his forces being dismissed, and 
about 4,000 charioteers only being left, used to 
observe our marches and retire a little from the 
road, and conceal himself in intricate and woody 
places, and in those neighborhoods in which he 
had discovered we were about to march, he used 
to drive the cattle and the inhabitants from the 
fields into the woods; and, when our cavalry, for 
the sake of plundering and ravaging the more 
freely, scattered themselves among the fields, 
he used to send out charioteers from the woods 
by all the well-known roads and paths, and, to — 
the great danger of our horse, engaged with 
them; and this source of fear hindered them 
from straggling very extensively. The result was 
that Cesar did not allow excursions to be. made 
to a great distance from the main body of. the. 
legions, and ordered that damage should be done 
to the enemy in ravaging their lands and kin- 
dling fires only so far as the legionary soldiers 
could, by their own exertion and marching, ac- 
eomplish it.

. In, the mean time the Trinobantes,’ almost 
the. most powerful state of those parts, from 
whieh the young man Mandubratius, embracing 
the protection of Casar, had come to the con- 
tinent of Gaul to [meet] him (whose father, 
Imanuentius, had possest the sovereignty in 
that state, and had been killed by Cassivelau- .

send. ambassadors to Cesar, and promise that 
they will surrender themselves to him and per-

Mandubratius from the violence of Cassivelau- 
nus, and send to their state some one to preside 
over it, and possess the government. Cesar de- 
mands forty hostages from them, and corn for 
his. army, and sends- Mandubratius to them. - 
They speedily performed the things demanded, 
and sent hostages to the number appointed, and 
the corn. 
The Trinobantes, being protected and seeured 
from any violence of the soldiers, the Cenimagni,

of cattle had been collected in‘it. (Now the 
Britons, when they have fortified’ the intricate 
woods, in which they are wont to: assemble for 
the purpose of avoiding the incursion of an en- 
emy with an entrenchment and a rampart, call

legions; he finds the place admirably fortified 
by nature and art; he, however, undertakes to 
attack it in two directions. The enemy, having 
remained only a short time, did not sustain the 
attack of our soldiers, and hurried away on the 
other side of the town. A great amount of cattle 
was found there, and many of the enemy were 
taken and slain in their flight. . . .

OVERCOMING THE NERVII* 
Cassar, having sent his cavalry on before, fol- 
lowed closely after them with all his forces; but 
the plan and order of the march were different 
from that which the Belgw had reported to. the

Cesar, according to his custom, led on [as the 
van] six legions unencumbered by baggage; be- 
hind them he had placed the baggage-trains of

been last raised closed the rear, and were a 
guard for the baggage-train. Our horse, with 
the slingers and archers, having passed the river, 
_@ommenced action with the cavalry of the en-

themselves into the woods to their. companions, 
and again made an assault out of the wood upon 
our men, who did not dare to follow them in 
their retreat further than the limit to which the 
plain and open parts extended; in the mean time 
the six legioris which had arrived first, having 
measured .out the work, began to fortify the 
camp. When the first part of the baggage-train 
of our army was seen by those who lay hidden 
in the woods, which had been agreed on among 
them as the time for commencing action, as soon 
‘as they had arranged their line of battle and 
formed their ranks within the woods, and had 
encouraged one another, they rushed out suddenly 
with all their forces and made an attack upon our 
horse. The latter being easily routed and thrown into 
eonfusion, the Nervii ran down to the river with 
such ineredible speed that they seemed to be in 
the woods, the river, and close upon us almost 
at the same time. And with the same speed 
‘they hastened up the hill to our camp and to

             order of battle to be formed; 
encouraged; the watchword ta iven. A great 
part of these arrangements ‘was. prevented by 
the shortness of time and the sudden approach — 
and charge of the enemy. Under these difficul- 
ties two things proved of advantage: [first] the 
skill and experience of the soldiers, because, ' 
having been trained by former engagements, 
they eould suggest to themselves what ought to 
be done as conveniently as receive information . 
from others; and [secondly] that Cesar had’ 
forbidden his several lieutenants to depart from’ 
the works and their respective legions before 
the eamp was fortified. These, on account of the 
near approach and the speed of the enemy, did 
not then wait for any command from Casar, 
but of themselves executed whatever appeared 
proper, Cesar, having given the necessary orders, 
hastened to and fro into, whatéver quarter for- 
tune earried him, to animate the troops, and 
came to the tenth legion. Having encouraged 
the soldiers with no further speech than that 
‘“they should keep up the remembrance of their , 
wonted valor, and not be confused in mind, but.’ 
valiantly sustain the assault of the enemy’’; as © 
the latter were not farther from them than the 
distance to which a dart could be cast, he gave 
the signal for commencing battle. And having 
gone to another quarter for the purpose of en- 
couraging [the soldiers], he finds them fighting. 
Such was the shortness of the time, and so de- 
termined was the mind of the enemy on fighting, 
that time was wanting not only for affixing the 
military insignia, but even for putting on the 
3 ‘soldiers to be

  helmets and drawing off the covers from the 
shields. To whatever part any one by chance 
came from the works (in which he had been em- 
ployed), and whatever standards he -saw first, 
at these he stood, lest in seeking his own com- 
pany he should lose the time for fighting. ~ 
The army having been marshaled, rather as 
the nature of the ground and the declivity of 
the hill and the exigency of the time than as the 
method-and order of military matters required, 
while the legions in the different places were 
withstanding the enemy, some in one quarter, 
some in another, and the view was obstrueted 
by the very thick hedges intervening, as we have 
before remarked, neither could proper reserves 
be posted, ‘nor could the necessary measures be 
taken in each part, nor could all the commands 
be issued by one person. Therefore, in such an 
unfavorable state of affairs, various events of 
fortune followed. . : 
At the same time, our horsemen, and light- 
armed infantry, who had been with those who, 
as I have related, were routed by the first as- 
sault.of the enemy, as they were betaking them- 
selves:into the camp, met the enemy face to face, 
-and again sought flight into another quarter; 
and the camp-followers, who from the Decuman 
Gate, and from the highest ridge of the hill had 
seen our men pass the river as victors, when, 
after going out for the purposes of plundering, 
they looked back and saw the enemy parading in 
our camp, committed themselves precipitately to 
flight; at the same time there arose the ery and 
shout of those who came with the baggagetrain,

  way, some another, By all these: circumstances 
the cavalry of the Treviri were tauch- alarmed 
(whose reputation for courage is extraprdinary 
among the Gauls, and who had-come:.to Cesar, 
being sent by- their state as. auxiliaries), and, 
when they saw our camp filled with a large. num- 
ber of the enemy, the legions hard prest and 
almost held surrounded, the camp-retainers, 
horsemen, slingers, and Numidians fleeing on all 
sides divided and seattered, they, despairing of 
our affairs, hastened home, and related to their 
state that the Romans were routed and con- - 
quered, [and] that the enemy were in possession 
of their camp and baggage-train. 
Cwxsar proceeded, after encouraging the tenth 
legion, to the right wing, where he perceivcu 
that his men were hard prest, and that in con- 
sequence of the standards of the twelfth legion 
being collected together in one place, the erowd- 
ed soldiers were a hindrance to themselves in 
the fight; that all the centurions of the fourth 
cohort were slain, and the standard-bearer kill- 
ed, the standard itself Icst, almost all the cen- 
turions of the other cohorts eithcr wounded or 
slain, and among them the chief centurion of 
the legion, P, Sextius Baculus, 2 very valiant 
man, who was so exhausted by many snd severe 
wounds that he was already. unable to support 
himself; he likewise pereeived that the rest were 
slackening their efforts, and that some, deserted 
by those in the rear, were retiring from the 
battle and avoiding the weapons; that the enemy 
[on the other hand], tho advancing from the 
lower ground, were not relaxing in front, and 
were [at the same time] pressing hard on both

flanks; he perceived also that the affair was at a 
crisis, and that there was not any reserve which 
eould be brought up; having therefore snatched 
a shield from one of the soldiers in the rear 
(for he himself had come without a shield), he 
advanced to the front of the line, and addressing 
the centurions -by name, and encouraging the 
rest of the soldiers, he ordered them to carry 
forward the standards, and extend the com- 
panies, that they might the more easily use their 
swords. On his arrival, as hope was brought to 
the ‘soldiers and their courage restored, while 
every one for his own part, in the sight of his 
general, desired to exert his utmost energy, the 
impetuosity of the enemy was a little checked. 
Cesar, when he perceived that the seventh 
legion, which stood close by him, was also hard 
prest by the enemy, directed the tribunes of the 
soldiers to effect a junction of the legions gradu- 
ally, and make their charge upon the enemy with 
a double front, which having been donc since 
they brought assistance the one to the other, 
nor feared lest their rear should be surrounded 
by the enemy, they began to stand their ground 
more boldly, and to fight more courageously. In 
the mean time, the soldiers of the two legions 
which had been‘in the rear of the army, as a 
guard for the baggage-train, upon the battle be- 
ing reported to them, quickened their pace, and 
were seen by the enemy on the top of the hill;- 
and Titus Labienus, having gained possession of 
the camp of the enemy, and observed from the 
higher ground what was going on in our camp, 
sent the tenth legion as a rolicf to our men, 
who, when they had learned from the flight of

the horse and the sutlers'in what position the 
affair was, and in how great danger the camp 
and the legion and the commander were involved, 
left undone nothing [which tended] to: despatch. 
By their arrival, so great a change of matters 
was made that our men, even those. who had 
fallen down exhausted with wounds, leaned on 
their shields, and renewed the fight; then the _ 
camp-retainers, tho unarmed, seeing the enemy’ 
completely dismayed, attacked [them tho] arm- 
ed; the horsemen too, that they might by their 
valor blot out the disgrace of their flight, thrust 
themselves before the legionary soldiers in all 
parts of the battle. But the enemy, even in the 
last hope of safety, displayed such great courage 
that when the foremost of them had fallen, the 
next stood upon them prostrate, and fought from 
their bodies; when these were overthrown, and 
their corpses heaped up together, those who sur- 
vived east their weapons against our men 
{thence] as from a mound, and returned our 
darts which had fallen short between [the 
armies]; so that it ought not to be concluded 
that men of such great courage had injudiciously 
dared to pass a very broad river, ascend very 
high banks, and come up to a very disadvantage- 
ous place; since their greatness of spirit had 
rendered these actions easy, altho in themselves 
very difficult. 
This battle being ended, and the nation and 
name of the Nervii being almost reduced to an- 
nihilation, their old men, who together with the 
boys and women we have stated to have 
been collected together in the fenny places and 
marshes, on this battle having been reported to

‘Pompey, because he was encamped on a hill, 
drew up his army at the very foot of it, ever in 
expectation, as may be conjectured, that Cesar 
would expose himself to this disadvantageous 
situation. Cesar, seeing no likelihood of being 
able to bring Pompey to an action, judged it the

to decamp from that post, and to be always in 
motion; with this hope, that by shifting his camp 
and removing from place to. place, he might be 
more conveniently supplied with cort,.and. also 
that by- being in motion he might get some op- 
portunity of forcing them to battle, and might

which was not accustomed to fatigue.” - ‘These. 
matters being settled, when the signal for march-

observed that shortly before, contrary to his 
daily practise, Pompey’s army had advanced. 
farther than usual from his entrenchments, so 
that it appeared possible to come to an action 
on equal ground. Then Cesar addrest himself 
to his soldiers, when they were at the gates of 
the camp, ready to march out. ‘‘We must de- 
fer,’’ says he, ‘‘our march at present, and. set 
our thoughts on battle, which has been our con- 
stant wish; let us then meet the foe with resolute

Pompey also, as was afterward known, at the 
unanimous. solicitation of his friends, had de- 
termined to try the fate of a battle. For he had 
even declared in council a few days. before that, 
before the battalions came to battle, Cxsar’s 
army would be put to the rout. When most 
people exprest their surprize at it, ‘‘I know,’’

as soon as the two armies have met, to attack 
Cwesar’s right wing on the flank, and enclosing 
their army on the rear throw them into disorder, 
and put them to the rout, before we shall throw 
a weapon against the enemy. By this means 
we shall put an end to the war, without endan- 
gering the legions, and almost without a blow. 
Nor is this a difficult matter, as we far out- 
number them in cavalry.’’ At the same time, 
he gave them notice to be ready for battle on 
the day following, and since the opportunity 
which they had so often wished for was now 
arrived, not to disappoint the opimion generally 
entertained of their experience and valor. . . . 
Cesar, observing his former custom, had 
placed the tenth legion on the right, the ninth 
on the left, altho it was very mueh weakened 
by the battles at Dyrrachium.” He placed the 
eighth legion so close to the ninth as almost to 
make one of the two, and ordered them to 
support each other. He drew up on the field 
eighty cohorts, making a total of twenty-two 
thousand men. He left two cohorts to guard the 
eamp. He gave the command of the left wing 
to Antonius, of the right to P. Sulla, and of the

fearing, from the disposition of, the enemy which’. 
we have previously mentioned, lest. his right 
wing might be surrounded by their. numerous 
cavalry, he rapidly drafted a single cohort from: 
each of the legions composing the third line, 
formed of them a fourth line, and opposed them 
to Pompey’s cavalry, and, acquainting them with 
his wishes, admonished them that the suceess of 
that day depended on their courage. At the

that he would give the signal whenever he wished 
them todoso. . . - 
But our men, when the signal was given, 
rushed forward with their javelins ready to be 
launched, but perceiving that Pompey’s men did 
not run to meet their charge, having acquired 
experience by custom, and being practised in 
former battles, they of their own accord re- 
pressed their speed, and halted almost midway, 
that they might not come up with the enemy 
when their strength was exhausted, and after 
a short respite they again renewed their course, 
and threw their javelins, and instantly drew 
their swords, as Cesar had ordered them. Nor. 
did Pompey’s men fail in this erisis, for they 
received our javelins, stood our charge, and main- 
tained their ranks; and, having laurched their 
javelins, had recourse to their swords. At the 
same time, Pompey’s horse, according to their 
orders, rushed out at once from his left wing, 
and his whole host of-archers poured after them.

perceived this, he gave the signal to his fourth

They instantly rushed forward and charged

quitted their post, but galloped forward to seek 
a refuge in the highest mountains. By their 
retreat the archers and slingers, being left desti- 
tute and defenseless, were all cut to pieces. The 
cohorts, pursuing their success, wheeled about 
upon Pompey’s left wing, while his infantry still 
continued to make battle, and attacked them in 
the rear. 
At the same time, Cesar ordered.his third line to ‘advance, which till then had not been en-

the fatigued, and others having made an attack 
on their rear, Pompey’s men were not able to

routed, and that part of his armyon which he 
yeposed his greatest hopes thrown.into  confu-

and retreated straightway on horseback to his 
camp, and ealling to the centurions, whom he 
had placed to guard the pretorian gate, with a 
loud voice, that the soldiers might hear: ‘‘Se-. 
eure the camp,’’ says he, ‘‘defend it with dili- 
gence, if any danger should threaten it; I will ; 
visit the other gates, and encourage the guards 
of the camp.’’? Having thus said, he retired 
into his tent in utter despair, yet anxiously 
waiting the issue. 
Cesar having foreed the Pompeians to flee 
into their entrenchment, and thinking that he 
‘ought not to allow them any respite to recover 
from their fright, exhorted his soldiers to take 
advantage of fortune’s kindness, and to attack 
the camp. Tho they were fatigued by the in- 
tense heat, for the battle had continued.till mid- 
day, yet, being prepared to undergo any labor, 
they cheerfully obeyed his command. The camp " 
was bravely defended by the cohorts which had 
been left to guard it, but with much more spirit 
by the Thracians and. foreign auxiliaries. For 
the soldiers who had fled for refuge to it from 
the field of battle, affrighted and exhausted by 
fatigue, having thrown away their arms and mil- 
itary standards, had their thoughts more en- 
gaged on their further escape than on the de- 
fense of the eamp. Nor could the troops who

was finished, they sent ambassadors to treat 
about a capitulation. A few senators who had 
espoused that party made their eseape by night. .

army, there fell about fifteen thousand; but up-

easé in human affairs, was. the consequence of 
its prosperity. The neighboring. kings’ and peo- 
ple, accordingly, began to assail them in war, 
while a few only of their friends came to their 
support; for the rest, struck with alarm, shrunk 
from sharing their dangers. But the Romans, 
active.at home and in the field, prepared with 
alaerity for their defense. They encouraged one 
another, and hurried to meet the enemy. They 
‘protected, with their arms, their liberty, their 
country, and their homes. And when they had 
at length repelled danger by valor, they lent 
assistance to their allies and supporters, and 
procured friendships rather by bestowing favors 
than by receiving them. 
They had a government regulated by laws. 
The denomination of their government was mon-

the similarity of their duty, were called Fathers.

the human mind would be least likely to grow

At this period ev citizen began to seek 
distinction, and to display his talents with’ great- 
er freedom; for, with princes, the ‘meritorious 
are greater objects of suspicion than’ the un- 
deserving, and to them the worth of others is a - 
source of alarm. But when liberty was secured, 
it is almost ineredible- how much the state’ 
strengthened itself in a short space of time, so. 
strong a passion for distinction had pervaded 
it. Now, for the first time, the youth, as soon 
as they were able to bear the toils of war, ac- 
quired military skill by actual service in the 
eamp, and took pleasure rather in splendid arms 
and military steeds than in the society of mis- 
tresses and convivial indulgence. To such men 
no toil was unusual, no place was difficult or 
imaceessible, no armed enemy was formidable; 
their valor had overcome everything. But among 
themselves the grand rivalry was for glory; each 
sought to be first to wound an enemy, to scale 
a wall, and to be noticed while performing such 
an exploit. Distinction such as this they re- 
garded as wealth, honor, and true nobility. They 
were covetous of praise, but liberal of money; 
they desired competent riches, but boundless 
glory. I could mention, but that the ‘account 
would draw me too far from my subject, places 
in which the Roman people, with a small body 
of men, routed vast armies of the enemy; and 
cities which, tho fortified by nature, they carried

those who attacked an enemy contrary to orders,

slowly from the contest, than on those who bad

in peace, they governed more by conferring

reeéived an injury, chose rather to pardon than 
to revenge it.

republic had increased its power; when mighty

* duced. to subjection; when Carthage, the rival 
of Rome’s dominion, had been utterly destroyed, 
and sea and land lay everywhere open to her

anny, and to introduce universal innovation. To 
those who had easily endured toils, dangers, and 
doubtful and difficult cireumstances, ease and 
wealth, the. objects of desire to others, became 
a burden and a trouble. At first the love of 
money, and then that of power, began to prevail, 
and these became, as it were, the sources of 
every evil. For avarice subverted honesty, in- 
tegrity, and other honorable principles, and in

tempt of religion, and general venality. Ambi-

enmities, not by their worth, but aceording tu 
interest; and to carry rather a specious coun- 
tenance than an honest heart. These vices at 
first advanced but slowly, and were sometimes 
restrained by correction; but afterward, when 
their infection had spread like a pestilence, the 
state was entirely changed, and the government, 
from being the most equitable and praiseworthy, 
became rapacious and insupportable. 
At first, however, it was ambition, rather than 
avarice, that influenced the minds of men—a 
vice which approaches nearer to virtue than the 
other. For of glory, honor, and power, the 
worthy is as desirous as the worthless; but the 
one pursues them by just methods; the other, 
being destitute of honorable qualities, works 
with fraud and deceit. But avarice bas merely 
money for its object, which no wise man has 
ever immoderately desired. It is a vice which, 
as if imbued with deadly poison, enervates what- 
ever is manly in body or mind. It is always un- 
pounded and insatiable, and is abated neither 
by abundance nor by want. |

and knowing that the load of debt was every-

having spent their money too liberally, and re- 
membering their spoils and former vietory, were 
longing for a civil war, Catiline formed the de- 
sign of overthrowing the government. There 
was no army in Italy; Pompey was fighting in 
a distant part of the world;* he himself had: 
great hopes of obtaining the ¢onsulship; the 
Senate was wholly off its guard; everything was 
quiet and tranquil, and all these circumstances, 
were exceedingly favorable for Catiline. .°.

THE FATE OF THE CONSPIRATORS: 
Wuew the Senate, as I have stated, had gone 
over to the opinion of Cato, the Consul, thinking 
‘it best not to wait till night, whieh was coming 
on, lest any new attempts should be made during 
the interval, ordered the triumvirs to make such 
preparations as the execution of the conspira- 
tors required. He himself, having posted the 
necessary guards, conducted Lentulus*. to the 
prison; and the same office was “performed for 
the rest by the pretors. 
“There is a place in the prison, which is called 
the Tullian dungeon,’ and which, after a slight 
ascent to the left, is sunk about twelve feet 
under: ground. Walls seeure it on every side, 
and over it is a vaulted reof connected with 
stone arches; but its appearance is disgusting 
and horrible, by reason of the filth, darkness, 
and stench, When Lentulus had been let down 
into. this place, certain men, to whom orders had

‘Watgon, 
*Lentulus, whe came of the ancient and noble Cornelian 
‘family, was one of the chiefs of the Catiline conspiracy. In 
71 B.o. he was Consul, but in the next year, was ejected from 
the Senate for “infamous life and manners.” 
The Tullian dungeon at Rome was built by King Ancus 
Martius and enlarged by Servius Tullius, from whom it 
derived its name. It still exists as a subterranean chapel 
. ‘beneath the small church of San Pietro in Carcere. The 
church tradition is that St. Peter was imprisoned in this

When he had spoken, he ordered, after a short 
delay, the signal for battle to be sounded, and 
led down his troops, in regular order, to the ° 
level ground. Having then sent away the horses 
of all the cavalry, in order to inerease the men’s 
courage by making their danger equal, he him- 
self, on foot, drew up his troops suitably to 
their numbers and the nature of the ground. As 
a plain stretched between the mountains on the 
left, with a rugged rock on the right, he placed 
eight cohorts in front, and stationed the rest of ~' 
his force, in close order, in the rear. From 
among these he removed all the ablest centu- 
rions, the veterans, and the stoutest of the com-

to take the command on the right, and a certain 
officer of Fesule on the left; while he himself, 
with his freedmen and the colonists, took his 
station by the eagle, which Caius Marius was 
said to have had in his army in the Cimbrian 
war. 
On the other side, Caius Antonius, who, being 
lame, was unable to be present in the engage- 
ment, gave the command of the army to Marcus -

Petreius, his lieutenant-general. Petreius ranged 
the cohorts of veterans, which he had raised to 
meet the present insurrection, in front, and be- 
hind them the rest of his foree in ‘lines. Then, 
riding round among his -troops, and addressing 
his men by name, he encouraged them, and bade 
them remember that they were to fight against 
unarmed marauders, in defense of their eountry, their children, their temples, and their homes. 
Being a military man, and having served with 
great reputation for more than thirty years, as 
tribune, prefect, lieutenant, or praetor, he knew 
most of the soldiers and their honorable actions, 
and, by ealling these to their remembrance, 
roused the spirits of the men. 
When he had made a complete ‘survey, he gave 
the signal with the trumpet, and ordered the 
cohorts to advance slowly. The army of the en- 
emy followed his example; and when they had 
approached so near that the action could be 
commenced by the light-armed troops, both sides, 
with ‘a loud shout, rushed together in a furious 
charge. ‘They threw aside’ their missiles, and 
fought. only with their swords. The veterans, 
calling to mind their deeds of old, engaged 
fiercely inthe closest combat. The enemy made 
sn. obstinate resistance; and both sides con- .. tended with the utmost fury. Catiline, during 
this time, was exerting himself with his light “troops in the front, sustaining such as were prest, substituting fresh men for the wounded,

thrown into confusion, and offering..but partial

emy, where he was slain, fighting to the last. 
When the battle was over, it was plainly seen 
what boldness and what energy of spirit had 
prevailed throughout the army of Catiline; for, 
almost everywhere, every soldier, after yielding 
up his breath, covered with his corpse the spot 
which he had oceupied when alive. A few, in- 
deed, whom the prxtorian cohort had dispersed, 
had fallen somewhat differently, but all with’ 
wounds in front. Catiline himself was found, 
far in advance of his men, among the dead 
bodies of the enemy; he still breathed, and — 
exprest in his countenance the fierceness of 
spirit which he had shown during his life. 
Of his whole army, neither in the battle, nor 
in flight, was any free-born citizen made pris- 
oner, for they had spared their own lives no 
more than those of the enemy. 
Nor did the army of the Roman people obtain

‘avail them nothing if they deserted their post; 
‘if they passed the bridge and left it behind them,

bridge ealled upon them to retire, he obliged 
them also to withdraw to a place of ‘safety on a

HANNIBAL’S. CROSSING OF THE ALPS‘ . (218 B.C.) 
From: the Druentia, by a road that lay prin- 
cipally through plains, Hannibal arrived at the 
Alps without molestation from the Gauls who 
inhabit ‘those regions. Then, tho the scene had 
‘been previously anticipated from report (by 
which uncertainties are wont to be exaggerated), 
yet the. height of the mountains when viewed 
80 near, and the snows almost mingling with the 
sky, the shapeless huts situated on the cliffs, the 
eattle and beasts of burden withered by the cold, 
the men unshorn and wildly drést, all things, 
animate and inanimate, stiffened with frost, and 
other objects more terrible to be seen than de- 
seribed, renewed their alarm. 
To them, marching up the first acclivities, the 
mountaineers appeared occupying the heights 
From Book XXI of the “History of Rome.” Translated 
by D. Spillan and. Cyrus. Edmonds: The identity of the 
pass through which Hannibal crossed bas been the subject 
2. of much controversy. A writer in Smith’s “Dictionary” 
  ) says the account in Polybius “will be found, on the whole,

denly to the attack, have occasibned great flight 
and havoe. Hannibal orders them to halt, and 
having sent forward Gauls to view'the ground, 
when he found there was no passage that way, 
he pitches his-camp in the widest valley he 
could find, among places all rugged and pre- 
cipitous. ‘Then, having learned from the same 
  Gauls, when they had mixed in conversation : 
with the mountaineers, from whom they differed ' me 
little in language and manners, that the pass 
was only beset during the day, and that at night’ 
each withdrew to his own dwelling, he advanced 
at the dawn to the heights, as if designing 
openly and by day to foree his way through the 
defile. The day then being passed in feigning 
a different attempt from that which was in prep- 
aration, when they had fortified the camp in the 
same place where they had halted, as soon as he ' 
perceived that the mountaineers had deseended — 
from the heights, and that the guards were with- 
drawn, having lighted for show a greater num 
ber of fires than was proportioned to the number 
that remained, and having left the baggage in 
the camp, with the cavalry and the principal 
part of the infantry, he himself with a party 
of light-armed soldiers, consisting of all the most 
courageous of his troops, rapidly cleared the de- 
file, and took posts on those very heights which 
the enemy had occupied. . . 
At dawn of light the next day the camp broke 
up, and the rest of the army began to. move 
forward. The mountaineers, on a signal being 
given, were now assembling from their forts to

which itself created, principally from the horses 
being - terrified, thinking that whatever terror

rocks, as. being accustomed alike to pathless and 
cireuitous ways. Then indeed the Carthaginians 
were: opposed at once by the enemy and by the 
difficulties. of the ground; and each striving to 
eseape first from the danger, there was more 
fighting among themselves than, with their op- 
ponents. The horses, in particular, created dan- 
ger in the lines, which being terrified by the 
discordant clamors that the groves and reechoing 
valleys ‘augmented, fell into confusion; and if 
by chance struck or wounded, they were so dis- 
mayed that they occasioned a great loss both 
of. men and baggage of every description; and 
as the pass on both sides was broken and pre- 
eipitous, this tumult threw. many down to an 
» immense depth, some even of the armed men; 
~ but the beasts of burden, with their loads, were 
«rolled down like the fall of some vast fabric.

    when he saw the line broken, and that there was 
danger that he should bring, over:his army pre- 
served to no purpose if deprived of their bag- 
gage, he hastened down from the higher ground ; 
and tho he had routed the énemy.by the first 
onset alone, he at the same time increased the 
disorder in his own army; but that tumult was 
composed in a moment, after the roads were 
cleared by the flight of the mountaineers, and. 
presently the whole army was conducted through, 
not only without being disturbed, but almost in 
silence. He then took a fortified place, which ° 
was the capital of that district, and the little 
villages that lay around it, and fed -his army 
for three days with the corn and cattle he had. 
taken; and during these three days, as the sol- 
diers were neither obstructed by the moun- 
taineers, who had been daunted by the first en- 
gagement, nor yet much by the ground, he made 
considerable way. 
WY He then came to another state, abounding, for 
a mountainous country, with inhabitants, where 
he was nearly overcome, not by open war,. but. |: 
by his own arts of treachery and ambuscade. ': 
Some old men, governors of forts, came as 
deputies to the Carthaginian, professing, ‘‘that 
having been warned by the useful example of the 
calamities of others, they wished rather to experi- 
ence the friendship than the hostilities of the Car- 
thaginians; they would, therefore, obediently. 
execute his commands, and begged that he would 
accept of a supply of provisions, guides of his 
march, and hostages for the sincerity of their 
promises.’? Hannibal, when he had answered

they ¢ame into a narrower pass, lying on one

and almost to destruction; for while Hannibal

that after one, or, at most, a second battle, they’ 
would have the citadel and capital of Italy in 
their power and possession,’’. The army then - 
began to advance, the enemy now makiig no 
attempts beyond petty thefts, as opportunity 
offered. But the journey proved much more dif- 
ficult than it had been in the ascent, as the 
declivity of the Alps, being generally shorter

halted, as if at the end of their:journey, it was 
announced to Hannibal, wondering what ob- 
structed. the march, that the rock was impassable. 
Having then gone himself to view the place, 
it seemed clear to him that he must lead his 
army, by however great a circuit, through 
the pathless and untrodden regions around 
it. But this route also proved impracticable; 
for while the new snow of @ moderate depth 
remained on the old, which had not been re- 
moved, their footsteps were planted with ease 
as they. walked upon the new snow, which was 
soft. and not too deep; but when it was dissolved 
by the trampling of so many men and beasts of 
burdén, they. then walked on the.bare ice below, 
and through the dirty fiuid formed by the 
melting snow. Here there was a wretched strug- 
gle, both on account of: the slippery ice not 
affording any hold to. the step,.and giving way 
beneath the foot more readily by reason of the 
slope; and whether they assisted themselves in 
rising by their hands or their knees, their sup- 
ports themselves giving way, they would tumble 
again; nor were there any stumps or roots near 
by pressing against which one might with hand 
or foot support oneself; so that they only floun- 
dered on the smooth ice and amidst the melted 
snow. The beasts of burden sometimes also cut 
into this lower ice by merely treading upon it, 
at others they broke it completely through, by 
the violence with which they struck in their 
hoofs in their struggling, so that most of them, 
as if taken in a trap, stuck in-the hardened and 
. deeply frozen ice.

At length, after the men and beasts of burden 
had been fatigued to no purpose, the: camp was 
pitehed on the summit, the ground being cleared 
for that purpose with great difficulty, ‘so: much 
snow was there to be dug out and earried away. 
The soldiers being then set to make a way down 
the cliff, by which alone a. passage could be 
effected, and it being necessary that they should 
eut through the rocks, having felled and lopped 
a number of large trees which grew around, 
they make a huge pile of timber; and as soon 
as a strong wind fit for exciting the flames arose, 
they set fire to it, and, pouring vinegar on the ~ 
heated stones, they render them soft and crum- , 
bling. They then open a way with iron in- 
struments through the rock thus heated by the 
fire, and soften its declivities by gentle windings, 
so that not only the beasts of burden, but. also 
the elephants, could be led down it. Four days 
were spent about this rock, the beasts nearly 
perishing through hunger; for the summits of 
the mountains are for the most part bare, and 
if there is any pasture the snows bury it. The 
lower parts contain valleys, and some sunny 
hills, and rivulets flowing beside woods, and 
scenes more worthy of the abode of man. There , 
the beasts of burden were sent out to pasture, 
and rest given for three days to the men, 
fatigued with forming the passage; they then 
descended inte the plains, the country and the 
dispositions of the inhabitants being now less 
rugged. £: : 
Tn this manner chiefly they came to Italy, in

leaving New Carthage, having erossed the Alps

nibal had when he had passed into Italy is by 
no means agreed upon by authors. Those who 
state them at the highest make mention of a 
hundred thousand. foot and twenty thousand 
horse; those who state them at the lowest, of 
twenty thousand foot and six thousand horse.

ten thousand horse were brought into Italy; and 
that: hé had heard from Hannibal himself that, 
after crossing the Rhone, he had lost thirty-six 
thousand men, and an immense number of horses 
and other beasts of burden among the Taurini,*

  HANNIBAL AND SCIPIO AT ZAMA (202 8.0.) . * 
Hannipau had by this time arrived at Adru- 
metum,’ from which place, after employing. a 
few days there in refreshing his soldiers, who | 
had suffered from the motion by sea, he pro- 
ceeded by forced marches to Zama, roused by the 
alarming statements of messengers, who brought 
word that all the country round Carthage was 
filled with armed troops, Zama is distant from 
Carthage a five days’ journey. Some spies, 
whom he had sent out from this place, being 
intercepted by the Roman guard, and brought 
before Seipio, he directed that they should be 
handed over to the military tribunes, and, after 
having been desired fearlessly to survey every- 
thing, he condueted them through the eamp wher- 
ever they chose; then, asking them whether they 
had examined everything to their satisfaction, he 
assigned them an escort, and sent them back to 
Hannibal. Hannibal received none of the eir- 
cumstances which were reported to him with 
feelings of joy; for they brought word that, as 
it happened, Masinissa had joined the enemy 
that very day, with six thousand infantry and

dispirited by the confidence of his enemy, which, 
doubtless, was not conceived without some 
ground. Accordingly, tho he himself was the 
originator of the war, and by his eoming had 
upset the truce which had been entered into, and 
eut off all hopes of a treaty, yet, concluding that 
more favorable terms might be obtained if he 
solicited peace while his strength was unim- 
paired than when vanquished, he sent a message 
to Seipio requesting permission to confer with 
him. 
Their armed attendants having retired to an 
equal distance, they met, each attended by one 
interpreter, being the greatest generals not only 
of their own times, but of any to be found in the 
records of the times preceding them, and equal 
to any of the kings or generals of any nation 
whatever. When they came within sight of each 
other they remained silent for a short time, 
thunderstruck, as it were, with mutual admira- 
tion. At length Hannibal thus began: . 
* “Sinee fate hath so ordained it, that I, who 
was the first to wage war upon the Romans, and 
who have so.often had victory almost within 
my reach, should voluntarily come to sue for 
~ peace, I rejoice that it is you, above all others, 
from whom it is my lot to solicit it. To you, 
also, amidst the many distinguished events of 
your life, it will not be esteemed one of the 
least glorious that Hannibal, to whom the gods 
had so often granted victory over the Roman 
generals, should have yielded to you; and that 
you should have put an end to this war, which 
has been rendered remarkable by your calamities

before it was by ours. In this; also, fortune 
would seem to have exhibited a disposition to 
sport with events, for it was when, your father 
was Consul that I first took up ‘arms;.he was 
the first Roman general with whom I, engaged in 
a pitched battle; and it is to his: son’ that I now 
come unarmed to solicit peace. ‘It. were, in- 
deed, most to have been desired that the gods 
should have put such dispositions into the minds 
of our. fathers, that you should have been’ eon- 
tent with the empire of Italy, and we with that 
of Afriea; nor, indeed, even to you, are Sicily 
and Sardinia of sufficient value to compensate 
you for the loss of so many fleets, so many 
armies, so many and such distinguished gen- 
erals. 
“But what is. past may be more easily cen- 
sured than retrieved. In our attempts to acquire 
the possessions of others, we have been com- 
pelled to fight for our own; and not only have 
you had a war in Italy, and we also in Africa, 
but you have beheld the standards and arms of 
your enemies almost in your gates and on your 
walls, and we now, from the walls of Carthage, 
distinetly hear the din of a Roman camp. What, 
therefore, we should most earnestly deprecate, 
and you should most devoutly wish for, is now 
the case: peace is proposed at a time when you 
have the advantage. We who negotiate it are the 
persons whom it most concerns to obtain it, and 
we are persons whose arrangements, be they what 
they will, our states will ratify. All we want 
is a disposition not averse from peaceful. coun- 
sels. So far as relates to myself, time (for I 
am returning to that country an old man: which

have so schooled me that I am more inclined to 
follow reason than fortune.. But I fear your 
youth and uninterrupted good fortune, both of 
whieh are apt to inspire a degree of confidence 
ill comporting with pacifie counsels. Rarely 
does that man consider the uncertainty of events 
’ whom fortune hath never deceived. What I was 
at Trasimenus and at Cann that you are this 
day. Invested with command when you had 
searcely yet attained the military age, tho all 
your enterprises were of the boldest description, 
in no instance has fortune deserted you. Aven- 
ging the death of your father and unele, you 
- have derived from the calamity of your house 
the high honor of distinguished valor and filial 
duty. You have recovered Spain, which had been 
lost, after driving thence four Carthaginian 
armies. When elected Consul, tho all others 
wanted courage to defend Italy, you erossed 
over into Africa, where, having eut to pieces two 
armies, having at once captured and burned two 
camps in the same hour, having made prisoner 
Syphax,.a most powerful king, and seized so 
many towns of his dominions and so many of 
ours, you have dragged me from Italy, the pos- 
session of which I had firmly held for now six- 
teen years... . 
“Formerly, in this same country, Marcus Ati- 
lins would have formed one among the few in- 
stances of good fortune and valor, if, when vic-

Spain with his father, Hamilear Barca, at that time took an 
oath upon an altar declaring eternal hostility to Rome. In the 
year of Zama he was forty-five years old.

    torious, he had granted a peaee to our fathers 
when they requested it;. but by’ not setting any 
bounds to his success, and not.¢hecking good 
fortune, which was elating him, he fell with a 
degree of ignominy proportioned to: his elevation. 
It is, indeed, the right of him who! grants, and 
not of him who solicits it, to dictate: the terms 
of peace; but perhaps we may not be uaworthy 
to impose upon ourselves the fine. We do not 
refuse that all those possessions on account of 
which the war was begun should be yours— 
Sicily, Sardinia, Spain, with all the islands lying. . 
in any part of the sea, between Africa and Italy. 
Let us Carthaginians, confined within the shores 
of Africa, behold you, since such is the pleasure 
of the gods, extending your empire over foreign 
nations, both by sea and land. I ean not deny 
that you have reason to suspect the Cartha- 
ginian faith, in consequence of their insincerity _ 
lately in soliciting a peace and while awaiting — 
the decision. The sincerity with which a peace 
will be observed depends much, Scipio, on the ° 
person by whom it is sought. Your Senate, as 
I hear, refused to grant a peace, in some meas- 
ure, because the deputies were deficient in 
respectability. It is I, Hannibal, who now solicit 
peace, who would neither ask for it unless I: 
believed it expedient, nor will I fail to observe 
it for the same reason of expedience on account 
of which I have solicited it. And in the same 
manner as I, because the war was commenced 
by me, brought it to pass that no one regretted 
jt till the gods began to regard me with dis- 
pleasure, so will I also exert myself that no one 
may regret the peace procured by my means.’”

In answer to these things the Roman general 
spoke nearly to the following effects. 
“J was aware that it was in consequence of 
the expectation of your arrival that. the Car- 
thaginians violated the existing faith.of the truce 
and broke off all hope of a peace. Nor, indeed, 
do you conceal the fact; inasmuch ag you art- 
fully withdraw from the former conditions of 
peace every concession except what. relates to 
those things which have for a long time been in 
our own power. But as it is-your object that 
your countrymen should be sensible how great 
a burden they are relieved from by your means, 
s0.it is incumbent upon me to endeavor.that they 
may not receive, as the reward of their perfidy, 
the. concessions which they formerly stipulated, 
by. expunging them now from the conditions of 
the peace. .Tho you do not deserve to be allowed 
the same conditions as before, you now request 
even to be benefited by your treachery. . Neither 
did our fathers first make war respecting Sicily, 
nor did we respecting Spain. In the former ease, 
the danger which threatened our allies, the Ma- 
mertines, and in the present the destruction of 
Saguntum, girded us with just and pious arms. 
That you were the aggressors, both you your- 
Selves confess and the gods are witnesses, who 
determined the issue of the former war, and who 
are now determining, and will determine, the is- 
sue of the present according to right and justice. 
As to myself, I am not forgetful of the instability 
of human affairs, but consider the influence of 
. fortune, and am well aware that all our measures 
are liable to a thousand casualties, But as I 
should acknowledge that my conduct would savor 
122  
-P-A-G-E-134

  of insolence and oppression if I: rejected you on 
your coming in person to solicit: peace, before I 
crossed over into Africa, you voluntarily retiring 
from Italy, and after you had embarked your 
troops, so now, when I have dragged “you into 
Africa almost by manual force, notwithstanding 
your resistance and evasions, I am not ‘bound .to 
treat you with any respect. Wherefore, if in 
addition to those stipulations on which it .was 
considered that a peace would at that time have 
been agreed upon, and what they are you are. 
informed, a compensation is proposed for having 
seized our ships, together with their stores, dur- 
ing a truce, and for the violence offered to our 
ambassadors, I shall then have matter to lay 
before my council. But if these things also ap- 
pear oppressive, prepare for war, since you could 
not brook the conditions of peace.’’ 
Thus, without effecting an accommodation, 
when they had returned from the conference ‘to 
their armies, they informed them that words had 
been bandied to no purpose, that the question 
must be decided by arnis, and that they must 
accept that fortune which the gods assigned them... 
* When they had arrived at their camps, they 
poth issued orders that their soldiers should get 
their arms in readiness and prepare their minds 
for the final contest; in which, if fortune should 
favor them, they would continue victorious, not 
for a single day, but forever. ‘‘Before to- 
morrow night,’’ they said, ‘‘they would know 
whether Rome or Carthage should give laws to 
the world; and that neither Africa nor Italy, but 
the whole world, would be the prize of victory; 
that the dangers which threatened those who had 
123

    the-misfortune to be defeated were proportioned 
tothe rewards of the vietors.’? For the Romans 
had not any place of refuge in an unknown and 
foreign land, and immediate destruction seemed 
to await Carthage if the troops whieh formed 
her last reliance were defeated. To this im- 
portant contest, the day following, two generals, 
by far the most renowned of any, and belonging 
to two of the most powerful nations in the world, 
advanced either to crown or overthrow, on that 
day, the many honors they had previously ac- 
quired. . we . 
While the general was busily employed among 
the Carthaginians, and the captains of the 
respective nations among their countrymen, 
most of them employing interpreters among 
troops intermixed with those of different nations, 
the trumpets and cornets of the Romans sounded; 
and such a clamor arose that the elephants, 
especially those in the left wing, turned round 
upon their own party, the Moors and Numidians. 
Masinissa had no difficulty in increasing the 
alarm of the terrified enemy, and deprived them 
of the aid of their cavalry in that wing. A few, 
however, of the beasts which were driven against 
the enemy, and were not turned back through 
fear, made great havoe among the ranks of the 
velites, tho not without receiving many wounds 
themselves; for when the velites, retiring to the 
companies, had made way for the elephants, that 
they might not be trampled down, they dis- 
eharged their darts at the beasts, exposed as they 
were to wounds on both sides, those in the van 
also keeping up a continual discharge of javelins; 
until, driven out of the Roman line by the 
124 \

  weapons which fell upon them from all quarters, 
these elephants also put to flight'even the cav- 
alry of the Carthaginians posted. in their right 
wing. Lelius, when he saw the enemy in dis- 
order, struck additional terror into.them in their 
confusion. : 
The Carthaginian line was deprived of the 
eavalry on both sides, when the infantry, who 
were now not a mateh for the Romans in eon- 
fidence or strength, engaged. In addition to this 
there was one circumstance, trifling in itself, but 
at the same time producing important conse- — 
quences in the action. On the part of the Ro- 
mans the shout was uniform, and on that aecount 
louder and more terrific; while the voices of the 
enemy, consisting as they did of many nations 
of different languages, were dissonant. The Ro- 
mans used the stationary kind of fight, pressing 
upon the enemy with their own weight and that 
of their arms; but on the other side there was 
more of skirmishing and rapid movement than 
force. 
Accordingly, on the first charge, the Romans 
immediately drove back the line of their op- 
ponents; then pushing them with their elbows 
and the bosses of their shields, and pressing for- 
ward into the places from which they had pushed 
them, they advanced a considerable space, as tho 
there had been no one to resist them, those who 
formed the rear urging forward those in front 
when they perceived the line of the enemy giving 
way, which circumstance itself gave great addi- 
tional force in repelling them. On the side of 
the enemy, the second line, consisting of the 
Africans and Carthaginians, were so far from

_ ‘supporting the first line when giving ground, that, 
on the contrary, they ‘even. retired, lest their 
enemy, by slaying those who made a firm re- 
sistance, should penetrate to themselves also. Ac- 
cordingly, the auxiliaries suddenly turned their 
backs, and facing about upon their own party, 
fled some of them into the seeond line, while 
others slew those who did not receive them into 
their ranks, since before they did not support 
them, and now refused to receive them. 
_And now there were, in a manner, two contests 
going.on together, the Carthaginians being com- 
pelled to fight at once. with the enemy and with 
their own party. Not even then, however, did 
they receive into their line the terrified and ex- 
asperated: troops; but, closing their ranks, drove 
them out of the scene of action to the wings and 
the surrounding plain, lest they should mingle these 
soldiers, terrified with defeat and wounds, with 
that part of their line which was firm and fresh. 
But such a heap of men and arms had filled the 
space ixf which the auxiliaries a little while ago 
had stood that it was almost more difficult to pass 
through it than through a close line of troops. 
The -spearmen, therefore, who formed the front 
line, pursuing the enemy as each could find a way 
through the heap of arms and men, and streams 
of blood, threw into complete disorder the bat- 
talions and companies. .The standards, also, of 
the principes had begun to waver when they saw 
the line before them driven from their ground. 
Scipio, perceiving this, promptly ordered the 
. Signal to. be given for the'spearmen to retreat, 
and, having taken his wounded into the rear, 
brought the principes and ‘triarii to the wings, in

But the Romans were superior both in numbers 
and courage, for they had now routed both ‘the 
cavalry and the elephants, and, having already 
defeated the front line, were fighting against the 
second. . . « : : 
Hannibal, after performing this, as it were, his

having been summoned to Carthage, he returned 
thither in the six and thirtieth year after he had 
left it when a boy, and confest in the senate ~

OF THE WISE MAN? 
I micur truly say, Serenus, that there is as 
wide a difference between the Stoies and the 
other sects of philosophers as there is between 
men and women, since each class contributes an 
equal share to human society, but the one is 
born to command, the other to obey. The other 
1 Seneca’s influence on writers in his own day was notable. 
‘He seems almost to have superseded Cicero as a model. 
Critics of our day, while recognizing sll this and the charm 
of his style, have found in his philosophy a lack of sincere 
qualities. An old question is that of his relations te Chris- 
tianity. So much in his writings partakes of the spirit 
of the Apostles that he has been credited with having been 
influenced by them. It is known that his brother Gallio met St. Paul im Corinth and that Burrus, the colleague 
and intimate friend of Seneca, was the captain. of the Pre- torian guards before whom St. Paul was brought in Rome. 
Cruttwell dismisses the claim, believing that Seneca's pbilos-

  philosophers deal with us gently and coaxingly, 
just as our accustomed family ‘physicians usually 
do with our bodies, treating them not by the best 
and shortest method, but by that which we allow 
them to employ; whereas the Stoies adopt a 
manly course, and do not care about its appearing” 
attractive to those who are entering upon it, but 
that it should as quickly as possible take us out 
of the world, and lead us to that lofty eminence 
which is so far beyond the scope of any missile 
weapon that it is above the reach of Fortune her- 
self. ‘‘But the way by which we are asked to 
climb is steep and uneven.’’ What then? Can 
heights be reached by a level path? Yet they 
are not so sheer and precipitous as some think. 
It is only the first part that has rocks and cliffs 
and no apparent outlet, just as many hills seen 
from a long way off appear abruptly steep and 
joined together, because the distance deceives our 
sight, and then, as we draw nearer, those very 
hills whieh our mistaken eyes had made into one 
gradually unfold themselves, those parts which 
seemed precipitous from afar assume a gently 
sloping outline. When just now mention was 
made of Mareus Cato, you whose mind revolts 
at injustice were indignant at Cato’s own age 
having so little understood him, at its having 
allotted a place below. Vatinius to one who tow- 
ophy was “the natural development of the thoughts of his 
predecessors in a mind st once capacious and smitten with 
the love of virtue.” ‘Philosophy to Seneca was ‘altogether

the people could do any wrong to such a man 
when they tore away his pretorship or his toga? 
when they bespattered his sacred head with the 
rinsings of their mouths? The wise man is safe, 
and no injury or insult can touch ‘him. . . . 
Consider now, whether any thief, or false ac- 
euser, or headstrong neighbor, or rich man en- 
joying the power conferred by a childless old age, 
could do any injury to this man, from whom 
neither war nor an enemy whose profession was 
the noble art of battering city walls could take 
away anything. Amid the flash of swords on all 
sides, and the riot of the plundering soldiery, 
amid the flames and blood and ruin of the fallen 
city, amid the crash of temples falling upon their 
gods, one man was at peace. You need not there- 
fore account that a reckless boast, for which I 
will give you a surety, if my word goes for noth- 
ing. Indeed, you would hardly believe so much 
constancy or such greatness of mind to belong 
to any man; but here a man comes forward to 
prove that you have no reason for doubting that 
one who is but of human birth can raise himself

pains, losses, diseases, wounds, and great natural 
‘convulsions roaring around him, ¢an bear ad- 
versity with calm and prosperity with modera- 
tion, neither yielding to the former nor trusting 
to the latter, that he can remain the same amid 
all varieties of fortune, and think nothing to be 
his own save himself, and himself too only as 
regards his better part. . . . 
You have no cause for saying, as you are wont 
to do, that this wise man of ours is nowhere to 
be found; we do not invent him as an unreal 
glory of the human race, or conceive a mighty 
shadow of an ‘untruth, but we have displayed and 
will display him just as we sketch him, tho he 
may perhaps be uncommon, and only one appears 
at long intervals; for what is great and tran- 
_geends the common ordinary type is not often 
produced; but this very Marcus Cato himself, 
the mention of whom started this discussion, was 
a man who I fancy even surpassed our model. 
Moreover, that which hurts must be stronger 
than that which is hurt. Now wickedness is not 
stronger than virtue; therefore the wise man can 
not be 4urt. Only the bad attempt to injure the 
good. Good men are at peace among themselves; 
bad ones are equally mischievous to the good and 
to one another. If a man can not be hurt by 
one weaker than himself, and a bad man be 
weaker than a good one, and the good have no 
injury to dread, except from one unlike them- 
selves; then, no injury takes effect upon the wise 
man ;.for by this time I need not remind you that 
-no one save the wise man is good. . . -

  or by inheritance, the more bravely he should 
bear himself, remembering that the tallest men 
stand in the front rank in battle. As for insults, 
offensive language, marks of disgrace, and such 
like disfigurements, he ought to bear them as he 
would bear the shouts of the enemy, and darts or 
stones flung from a distance, which rattle upon 
his helmet without causing a wound; while he 
should look upon injuries as wounds, some re- 
ceived on his armor and others on his body, which 
he endures without falling or even leaving his 
place in the ranks. Even tho you be hard prest 
and violently attacked by the enemy, still it is 
base to give way; hold the post assigned to you 
by nature. You ask, what this post is? it is that 
of being a man. The wise man has another help, 
of the opposite kind to this; you are hard at 
work, while he has already won the victory. Do 
not quarrel with your own good advantage, and, 
until you shall have made your way to the truth, 
keep alive this hope in your minds, be willing to 
receive the news of a better life, and encourage 
it by your admiration and your prayers; it is 
to the interest of the commonwealth of mankind 
that there should be some one who is uneon- 
quered, some one against whom fortune has no

yet their fortunes agreed. Lucius Bibulus, a man 
more remarkable for goodness than for strength 
of character, had both his sons murdered at the 
same time, and even insulted by the Egyptian 
soldiery, so that the agent of his bereavement 
was as much a subject for tears as the bereave-

day to mourning for two sons? Thus.soon did he 
end his mourning for his children, altho he had 
mourned a whole year for his consulship. Gaius 
Cesar, after having traversed Britain, and not al- 
lowed even the ocean to set bounds to his successes, 
heard of the death of his daughter, which hurried 
on the crisis of affairs. Already Cn@us Pompey 
stood before his eyes, a man who would'ill endure 
that any one besides himself should become a 
great power in the state, and one who was likely 
to place a cheek upon his advancement, which 
he had regarded as onerous even when each 
gained by the other’s rise: yet within three days’ - 
time he resumed his duties as general, and con- 
quered his grief as quickly as he was wont to 
conquer everything else. 
Why need I remind you of the deaths of the 
other Cesars, whom fortune appears to me some- 
times to have outraged in order that even by their 
deaths they might be useful to mankind, by 
proving that not even théy, altho they were 
styled ‘sons of gods,’’ and ‘‘fathers of gods to - 
come,’ could exercise the same power over their 
own fortunes which they did over those of oth- 
ers? The Emperor Augustus lost his children 
and his grandchildren, and after all the family 
of Cesar had perished was obliged to prop his 
empty house by adopting a son: yet he bore his 
losses as bravely as tho he were already personal- 
ly concerned in the honor of the gods, and as 
tho it were especially to his interest that no one 
should complain of the injustice of Heaven. Ti-

had fallen at the time when he avoided those 
dangers which Catiline aimed equally at him and 
at his country, he might have died as. the savior 
of the commonwealth which he had set free: if 
his death had even followed upon that of his 
daughter, he might have died happy. He would 
not then have seen swords drawn for the slaugh- 
ter of Roman citizens, the goods of the murdered 
divided among the murderers, that men might 
pay from their own purse the price of their own 
blood, the publie auction of the Consul’s spoil in 
the civil war, the publie letting out of murder 
to be done, brigandage, war, pillage, hosts of 
Catilines. Would it not have been a good thing 
for Mareus Cato if the sea had swallowed him 
up when he was returning from Cyprus after 
sequestrating the king’s hereditary possessions, 
even if that very money which he was bringing 
to pay the soldiers in the civil war had been lost 
with him? He certainly would have been able 
to boast that no one would dare to do wrong in 
the presence of Cato: as it was, the extension 
of his life for a very few more years forced one 
who was born for personal-and political freedom 
to flee from Cxsar and to become Pompey’s fol-

evil: indeed, it put an end to the power of any 
evil to hurt him. . . .

oftheir antiquity have not existed for long. All 
human works are brief and fleeting: they take up 
no part whatever of infinite time. Tried by the 
standard of the universe, we regard this earth 
of ‘ours, with all its cities, nations, rivers, and

indeed the world is contained many times in it.

that which, however much you add to it, will

make our lives long by one expedient, that is, 
by being satisfied with their length: you may

You, Cesar, can boldly say that everything 
which has come into your charge has been kept 
safe, and that the state has neither openly nor 
secretly suffered any loss at your hands. You 
have coveted a glory which is most rare, and ~ 
which has been obtained by no emperor before 
you, that of innocence. Your remarkable good- 
ness is not thrown away, nor is it ungratefully 
or spitefully undervalued. Men feel gratitude 
toward you: no one person ever was so dear to 
another as you are to the people of Rome, whose 
great and enduring benefit you are. You have, 
however, taken upon yourself a mighty burden: 
no one any longer speaks of the good times of 
the late Emperor Augustus, or the first years of 
the reign of Tiberius, or proposes for your imita- 
tion any model outside yourself: yours is a pat- 
tern reign. This would have been diffieult had 
your goodness of heart. not been innate, but 
merely adopted for a time; for no one ean wear 
a mask for long, and fictitious qualities soon give 
place to true ones. Those which are founded 
upon truth, become greater and better as time 
goes on.

  The Roman people were in a state of great 
hazard as long as it was uncertain how your 
generous disposition would turn out: now, how- 
ever, the prayers of the community are sure of 
an answer, for there is no fear that you should 
suddenly forget your own character. Indeed, 
excess of happiness makes men greedy, and our 
desires are never so moderate as to be bounded 
by what they have obtained: great successes be- 
come the stepping-stones to greater ones, and 
those who have obtained more than they hoped, 
entertain even more extravagant hopes than be- 
fore; yet by all your countrymen we hear it ad- 
mitted-that they are now happy, and moreover, 
that nothing can be added to the blessings that 
they enjoy, except that they should be eternal. 
Many. ‘circumstances force this admission from 
them, altho it is the one which men are least 
willing to make: we enjoy a profound and pros- 
perous peace, the power of the law has been open- 
ly asserted in the sight of all men, and raised be- 
yond the reach of any violent interference: the 
form of our government is so happy, as to con- 
tain’ all the essentials of liberty except the power 
of. destroying itself. It is nevertheless your 
elemeney which. is most especially admired by 
the high and low alike: every man enjoys or 
hopes to enjoy the other blessings of your rule 
according to the measure of his own personal 
good fortune, whereas from your elemency all 
hope alike: no one has so much confidence in his 
innocence, 4s not to feel glad that in your pres- 
ence stands a clemency which is ready to make 
allowance for human errors. . . . 
Since I have made mention of the gods, I shall 
142
-P-A-G-E-154

  state the best model on which @ prince may mold 
his life to be, that he deal with his countrymen 
as he would that the gods may deal with himself. 
Is it then desirable that the gods should show 
no mercy upon sins and mistakes, and that they 
should harshly pursue us to our ruin? In that 
case what king will be safe? Whose limbs will 
not be torn asunder and collected by the sooth- 
sayers? If, on the other hand, the gods are 
placable and kind, and do not at once avenge 
the crimes of the powerful with thunderbolts, is 
it not far more just that a man set in authority 
over. other men should exercise his power in a 
spirit of clemency and should consider whether 
the condition of the world is more beauteous and 
pleasant to the eyes on a fine calm day, or when 
everything is shaken with frequent thunder-claps 
and when lightning flashes on all sides! Yet the 
appearance of a peaceful and constitutional reign 
is the same as that of the ealm and brilliant sky. 
A cruel reign is disordered and hidden in dark- 
ness, and while all shake with terror at the sud- 
den explosions, not even he who caused all this 
disturbance escapes unharmed. It is easier to 
find exenses for private. men who obstinately 
claim their rights; possibly they may have been : 
injured and their rage may spring from their 
wrongs; besides this, they fear to be despised, 
and not to return the injuries which they have 
received looks like weakness rather than clem- 
ency; but one who ean easily avenge himself, if 
he neglects to do so, is certain to gain praise for 
goodness of heart. Those who are born in a 
humble station may with greater freedom exer- 
cise violence, go to law, engage in quarrels, and

indulge their angry passions; even’ blows count 
for little between two. equals; but. in ease of 
a ‘king, even loud clamor and unmeasured talk 
‘are unbecoming. . . . 
Such was Augustus when an old man, or when 
growing old: in his youth he was hasty and pas- 
sionate, and did many things upon which he 
looked back with regret. No one will venture 
to compare the rule of the blest Augustus to 
the mildness of your own, even if your youth be 
compared with his more than ripe old age: he 
was gentle and placable, but it was after he had 
dyed the sea at Actium with Roman blood; after 
he had wrecked both the enemy’s fleet and his 
own at Sicily; after the holocaust of Perusia and 
the proseriptions. But I do not eall it clemency 
to be wearied of cruelty; true clemency, Casar, 
is that which you display, which has not begun 
from remorse at its past ferocity, on which there 
is no stain, which has never shed the blood of 
your countrymen: this, when combined with un- 
limited power, shows the truest self-control and 
all-embraecing love of the human race as of one’s 
self, not corrupted by any low desires, any ex- 
travagant ideas, or any of the bad examples of 
former emperors into trying, by actual experi- 
ment, how great a tyranny you would be allowed 
to exercise. over his countrymen, but inclining 
father to blunting your sword of empire. 
“You, Cesar, have granted us the boon of keep- 
dng our state free from bloodshed, and that of 
which you boast, that you have not caused one

-velous because no one ever had the power of the

sword placed in his hands at au. earlier age. 
Clemency, then, makes empires besides being 
their most trustworthy means: of preservation. 
Why have legitimate sovereigns grown old on the 
throne, and bequeathed their power to their chil- 
dren and grandchildren, while the sway.of des- 
potie usurpers is both hateful and short-lived? 
What is the difference between the tyrant. and 
the king—for their outward symbols of authority 
and their powers are the same—except it be that 
tyrants take delight in cruelty, whereas kings 
are only eruel for good reasons and because they 
ean not help it. . . . : 
Nothing can be imagined which is more be- 
coming to a sovereign than clemency, by what- 
ever title and right he may be set over-his fellow 
citizens. The greater his power, the more beau- 
tiful and admirable he will confess his clemency 
to be: for there is no reason why power should 
do any harm, if only it be wielded in accordance 
with the laws of nature. Nature herself has con- 
ceived the idea of a king, as you may learn from 
various animals, and especially from bees, among 
whom the king’s cell is the roomiest, and is 
placed in the most central and safest part of 
the hive; moreover, he does no work, but employs. 
himself in keeping the others up to their work.. 
If the king be lost, the entire swarm disperses: 
they never endure to have more than one king at 
a time, and find out which is the better by making 
them fight with one another: morecver the king 
ig distinguished by his statelier appearance, being 
both larger and more brilliantly colored than the, 
other bees. . | 
The most remarkable distinction, however, is 
TI~10 145
-P-A-G-E-157

the following: bees are very fierce; and for their 
size are the most pugnacious of ‘creatures, and 
leave their stings in the wounds which they make, 
but the king himself has no sting: nature does 
not wish him to be savage or to seek revenge at 
so dear a rate, and so has deprived him of his 
weapon and disarmed’ his rage. She has offered 
him as a pattern to great sovereigns; for she is 
wont to practise herself in smali matters, and 
to scatter abroad tiny models of the hugest struc- 
tures. We ought to be ashamed of not learning 
a lesson in behavior from these small creatures, 
for a man, who has so much more power of doing 
harm than they, ought to show a correspondingly 
greater amount of self-control. Would that hu- 
‘man beings were subject to the same Jaw, and 
that. their anger destroyed itself together with 
its,instruments, so that they could’ only inflict a_ 
wound once, and would not make use of the 
strength of others to carry out their hatreds; 
for their fury would soon grow faint if it earried 
its own punishment with it, and could only give 
rein to its violence at the risk of death. Even 
as it is, however, no one can exercise it with 
safety, for he must needs feel as much fear as 
he hopes to’ cause, he. must watch every one’s 
movements, and even when his enemies are not 
laying violent hands upon him he must bear in 
mind that they are plotting to do so, and he ean 
not have a single moment free from alarm. Would 
any one endure to live such a‘life as this, when 
he might enjoy all the privileges of his high sta- 
tion ‘to: the general joy of all'‘men, without fear?

for himself by guaranteeing the same for his sub- 
jects. He need not pile up lofty citadels, escarp 
steep hills, cut away the sides of mountains, and 
fence himself about with many lines of walls and 
towers: clemency will render a king safe. even 
upon an open plain. The one fortification which 
can not be stormed is the love of his country- 
men... 
The reason why cruelty is the most hateful of 
all vices is that it goes first beyond ordinary 
limits, and then beyond those of humanity; that. 
it devises new kinds of, punishments, calls in- 
genuity to aid it in inventing devices for varying 
and lengthening men’s torture, and takes delight 
in their sufferings: this accursed disease of the 
mind reaches its highest pitch of madness when 
eruelty itself turns into pleasure and the act of 
killing a man becomes enjoyment. Such a ruler 
is soon east down from his throne; his life is 
attempted by. poison one day and by the sword 
the next; he is exposed to as many dangers as 
there are men to whom he is dangerous, and he 
is sometimes destroyed by the plots of individu- 
als, and at others by a general insurrection. 
Whole communities are not roused to action by 
unimportant outrages on private persons; but 
cruelty which takes a wider range, and from 
which no one is safe, becomes a mark for all 
men’s weapons. Very small snakes escape our

THE PILOT” 
A tempest and storme hurt a Pilot, but ‘not-

is made worse by a tempest and by a storme, 
because that thing which he had purposed he

he made, not in his skill, but in 
whom the Aristotelian: therefore, 
tie and dolour, and what soeuer s 
there shall be, shall not take vertu 
but shall hinder his working theréof.'’ 
This were rightly said, except the’ condition of 
a Pilot and of a wise-man were unlike. For the 
purpose of him is in leading his life, not without 
faile to effect that which he assayeth to doe, but 
to doe all things aright. It is the’ purpose of 
the Pilot, without faile to bring a ship into a 
haven. They be seruile arts, they ought to per- 
forme that which they promise. Wisedome is 
mistresse and gouernesse. The arts -doe serve to, 
wisedome commandeth our life. I judge that we 
must answere after another sort, namely that 
neyther the skill of the gouernour is made worse 
by any tempest, nor yet the very administration 
of art. The gouernour hath not promised pros- 
perous suceesse unto thee, but his profitable en- 
devour, and skill to gouerne the ship. This ap- 
peareth the more, by how much the more some 
force of fortune hath hindered him. He that 
hath beene able to say this, O Neptune, this ship 
was neuer but right, hath satisfied skill. A tem- 
pest hindereth not the work of a pilot, but the 
suecesse, 
What therefore sayeth thou? Doth not that 
thing hurt a Pilot, which hindereth him from 
exitring the Port? Which causeth his endeuours 
"tobe vaine?’ Which eyther beareth him back, or 
detaineth and disarmeth him? It hurteth him not 
as Pilot, but as one that doth saile. Otherwise 
‘it doth not so much hinder, as shew the Pilot’s 
150
-P-A-G-E-162

skill. For euery one ean, as they say, be a pilot 
in the calme. These things hinder the ship; not 
a pilot as he is a pilot. Two persons a pilot 
hath; the one common with all who haue gone 
aboard the same ship, wherein he himselfe also 
is a passenger; the other proper as he is gouer- 
nour. The tempest hurteth him as he is 4 pas- 
senger not as a Pilot. Furthermore the art. of 
a Pilot is another good, it appertaineth to those 
whom he earrieth: as the art of a Physitian ap-. 
pertaineth to those whom he doth cure. Wise- 
dome is a common good; and is proper to ownes 
selfe, for those with whom he doth liue. There- 
fore peraduenture a Pilot is hurt, whose prom- 
ised sernice to others is let by a tempest. 
A wise man is not hurt by pouertie, nor by 
doulour, nor by other tempests of life. For not 
all workes of him be hindered, but only those that 
pertain to other men; alwayes is he himself in- 
deed, the greatest of all, when fortune hath op- 
posed herselfe unto him, then manageth he the 
businesse of wisdome itselfe: which wisdome we 
haue said to be both anothers and his owne good. 
Furthermore not then indeed is he hindered to 
profite other men, when some necessities do presse 
him. Through pouertie he is hindred to teach, 
how a Commonwealth may be managed: but he 
teacheth that thing, how pouertie is. to be man- 
aged. His worke is extended all his life long. 
Thus no fortune, no thing excludeth the acts of 
a wise-man. For he doth not that verie thing, 
whereby he is forbidden to do other things. He 
is fit for both chances: a gouernour of the bad, 
an ouercommer of the good. So I say hath he 
exercised himselfe, that he sheweth vertue as well

in prosperous as in aduerse ‘affitires; neyther 
looketh he upon the matter thereof, put upon it- 
selfe. Therefore neither poverty’ nor doulour, 
nor any other thing which turneth ‘back the un- 
skilfull, and driuest them headlong,  hindereth 
them. Hast thou rather he should be pressed? 
He maketh use of it: Not only of inorie did Phi- 
dias know how to make images: he made them of 
brasse. If marble were unto him, if thou hadst 
offered baser matter, he would haue. made such 
a one thereof, as. could be made of that which 
was the best. : 
So a wise-man will show uertue, if he may, 
in wealth, if not in pouertie: if he shall be able, 
_ in his eountrie; if not in banishment: if he ean, 
being a eommander; if not, being a souldier: if 
he. can being sound; if not, being weake: what 
fortune soeuer he shall ent2rtaine, he will per- 
forme some memorable thing thereby. Certain 
tamers there be of wild beasts, who teach the 
fiercest creatures, and which terrifie a man when 
they meet him, to suffer the yoake: and not 
wanted to have shaken fiercenesse off, do tame 
them, euer to keep them companie. The master 
useth often’ to thrust out his hand to Lions; they 
kisse it.) The keeper commandeth his tyger; the 
ZEthiopian: Player commandeth his elephants to 
fall upon their knees, and to walke upon a rope: 
“so a Wise-man is skilfull to subdue euil things.

OF A HAPPY LIFE" 
Ai, men, brother Gallio, wish to live happily, 
but are dull at perceiving exactly what it is that 
makes life happy: and so far is it from being 
easy to attain to happiness that the more eagerly 
a man struggles to reach it the further he de- 
parts from it, if he takes the wrong road; for, 
since this leads in the opposite direction, his very 
swiftness earries him all the further away. We 
must therefore first define ¢learly what it is at 
which we aim: next we must consider by what 
path we may most speedily reach it, for on our 
journey itself, provided it be made in the right 
direction, we shall learn how much progress we 
have made each day, and how much nearer we 
are to the goal toward which our natural desires 
urge us. But as long as we wander at random, 
not following any guide except the shouts and 
discordant elamors of those who invite us to 
proceed in different directions, our short life will 
be wasted in useless roamings, even if we labor 
both day and night to get a good understanding. 
Let us not therefore decide whither we must 
tend, and by what path, without the advice of 
some experienced person who has explored: the 
region which we are about to enter, because this

others; for in them some distinctly understood 
track and inquiries made of the natives make it 
“impossible for us to go wrong, but here the most 
beaten and frequented tracks are those which 
lead us astray. Nothing, therefore, is more im- 
portant than that we should not, like sheep, fol- 
low the flock that has gone before us, and thus 
proceed not whither wé ought, but whither the 
rest are going. . . . 
True wisdom consists in not departing from 
nature and in molding our conduct according 
to her laws and model. A happy life, therefore, 
is one which is in accordance with its own nature, 
and can not be brought about unless in the first 
place the mind be sound and vigorous, enduring 
all things with most admirable courage suited to 
the times in which it lives, careful of the body 
and its appurtenances, yet not troublesomely 
careful. It must also set due value upon all the 
things which adorn our lives, without over- 
estimating any one of them, and must be able 
to enjoy the bounty of Fortune without becoming 
her slave. . . - : 
-A happy life consists in a mind which is free, 
upright, undaunted, and stedfast beyond the in- 
fluence of fear or desire, which thinks nothing 
good except honor, and nothing bad except shame, 
and regards everything else as a mass of mean 
details which can neither add anything to nor 
take anything away from the happiness of life, 
. but which come and go without either increasing 
or diminishing the highest good? A man of these 
principles, whether he will or no, must be ac- 
‘eompanied by a continual cheerfulness, a high

  happiness, which comes indeed from on high be- 
cause he delights in what he has, and desires no 
greater pleasures than those which his home af- 
fords. Is he not right in allowing these to turn 
the scale against petty, ridiculous, and _short- 
lived movements of his wretched body? on. the 
day on which he becomes proof against pleasure 
he also becomes proof against pain. See, on the 
other hand, how evil and guilty a slavery a man 
is forced to serve who is dominated in turn by 
pleasures and pains, those most untrustworthy 
and passionate of masters. We must, therefore, 
escape from them into freedom. This nothing 
will bestow upon us save contempt of Fortune; 
but if we attain to this, then there will dawn 
upon us those invaluable blessings, the repose of 
a mind that is at rest in a safe haven, its lofty 
imaginings, its great and steady delight at cast- 
ing out errors and learning to know the truth, 
its courtesy and its cheerfulness, in all of which 
we shall take delight, not regarding them as good 
things, but as proceeding from the proper good 
of man... « 
Why do you put together two things which 
are unlike and even incompatible one with an- 
other? virtue is a lofty quality, sublime, royal, 
uneonquerable, untiring: pleasure is low, slavish, 
weakly, perishable; its haunts and homes are the 
brothel and the tavern. You will meet virtue in 
the temple, the market-place, the senate-house, 
manning the walls, covered with dust, sunburnt, 
horny-handed: you will find pleasure skulking out 
of sight, seeking for shady nooks at the public 
baths, hot chambers, and places which dread the 
visits of the edile, soft, effeminate, reeking of

wine ‘and perfumes, pale or perhaps painted and 
made up with cosmetics. The highest good is 
‘immortal: it knows no ending, and does not d- 
- mit of either satiety or regret: for a right-think- 
ing mind never alters or becomes hateful to itself, 
‘nor do the best things ever undergo any change: 
but pleasure dies. at the very moment when it 
charms us most: it has no great scope, and there- 
fore it soon cloys and wearies us, and fades away 
as soon as its first impulse is over: indeed, we 
can not depend upon anything whose nature is 
to change, Consequently, it is not even possible 
that there should be any solid substance in that 
which comes and goes so swiftly and which 
perishes by the very exercise of its own fune- 
tions, for it arrives at a point at which it ceases 
to be, and even while it is beginning always keeps 
“its end in view. . . . 
“A man should be unbiassed and not to be con- 
quered by external things: he ought to admire 
himself alone, fo feel confidence in his own spirit, 
and so to order his life as to be ready alike for 
good or bad fortune. Let not his confidence be 
without knowledge, nor his knowledge without 
stedfastness: let him always abide by what he has 
once determined, and let there. be no erasure in 
his doctrine. It. will be. understood, even tho 
I append it not, that such a man will be tranquil 
“and composed in his demeanor, high-minded and 
courteous in his actions. Let reason be encour-

forth into outward things, and yet altogether 
returns from all sides back to Himself, Let our 
mind do the same thing: when, following its 
bodily senses, it has by means of them sent, itself 
forth into the things of the outward world, let 
it remain still their master and its own. “By this 
means we shall obtain a strength and an ability 
which are united and allied together; we shall 
derive from it that reason which never halts. 
between two opinions, nor is dull in forming its 
perceptions, beliefs, or convictions. Such a mind, 
when it has ranged itself in order, made its 
various parts agree together, and, if I may so 
express myself, harmonized them, has attained 
to the highest good: for it has nothing evil or 
hazardous remaining, nothing to shake it or make 
it stumble: it will do everything under the guid- 
ance of its own will, and nothing unexpected will 
befall it, but whatever may be done by it will 
turn out well, and that, too, readily and easily, 
without the doer having recourse to any under- 
hand devices: for slow and hesitating purpose. 
You may, then, boldly declare that the highest 
good is singleness of mind: for where agreement 
and unity are, there must the virtues be: it is the 
vices that are at war with one another. . . . 
It is the act-of the generous spirit to pro- 
portion its efforts not to its own strength, but to 
that of human nature, to entertain lofty aims, 
and to coneeive plans which are too vast to be 
carried into execution even by those ‘who ‘are

“despise riches when I have them as much as 
when I have them not; if they be elsewhere I 
will not be more gloomy, if they sparkle around 
me I will not be more lively than I should other- 
wise be: whether Fortune comes or goes I will 
take no notice of her: I will view all lands as 
tho they belonged to me, and my own as tho they 
belonged to all mankind: I will so live as to 
remember that I was born for others, and will 
thank Nature on this account: for in what fash- 
ion could she have done better for me? she has 
given:me alone to all, and all to me alone. What- 
evér I may possess, I will neither hoard it greedi- 
ly nor squander it recklessly. I will think that 
I have no possessions so real as those which I 
have given away to deserving people: I will not 
reckon benefits by their magnitude or number, 
or by anything except the value set upon them 
by the receiver: T never will consider a gift to 
be a large one if it be bestowed upon a worthy 
object. I will do nothing because of public 
opinion, but everything because of conscience: 
whenever I do anything alone by myself I will 
believe that the eyes of the Roman people are 
upon me while I do it. In eating and drinking 
my object shall be to quench the desires of Na- 
ture, not to fill and empty my belly. I will be 
agreeable with my friends, gentle and mild to 
my foes: I will grant pardon before I am asked 
for it, and will meet the wishes of honorable men 
half-way. I will bear in mind that the world 
is my native eity, that its governors are the gods, 
158

  and that they stand above and around me, crit- 
ieizing’ whatever I do or say. Whenever either 
Nature demands my breath again, or reason bids 
me dismiss it, I will quit this life, calling all 
to witness that I have loved a good conscience, 
and good pursuits; that no one’s freedom, my 
own least of all, has been impaired through me.’” 
He who sets up these as the rules of his life will 
soar aloft and strive to make his way to the 
gods: of a truth, even tho he fails, yet he 
“Fails in a high emprise.”

Where, indeed, can fortune invest riches more 
securely than in a place from whence they can 
always be recovered without any squabble with 
their trustee? Marcus Cato, when he was praising 
Curius and Coruneanius and that century in 
which the possession of a few small silver coins 
were an offense which was punished by the Cen- 
sor, himself owned four million sesterces; a: less: 
fortune, no doubt, than that of Crassus, but 
larger than’ of Cato the Censor. If the amounts 
be compared, he had outstript his great-grand-

Crassus, and if still greater riches had fallen 
to his lot, he would not have-spurned them, for 
the wise man does not think himsélf unworthy 
of any chance presents: he does not love riches, 
but he prefers to have them; he does not receive 
- them into his spirit, but only into his house: nor 
does he cast away from him what he already 
possesses, but keeps them, and is willing that his 
virtue should receive a larger subject-matter for 
its exercise. . .,.

  his accounts to the serutiny of the people, and 
no one can find in them any item upon which he 
ean lay hands, such a man may boldly, and un- 
coneealedly enjoy his riches. The wise man will 
not allow a single ill-won penny to cross. his 
threshold; yet he will not refuse or close his 
door against great riches, if they are the gift of 
fortune and the product of virtue: what reason 
has he for grudging them good quarters: let them 
come and be his guests: he will neither brag of 
them nor hide them away: the one is the part of 
a silly, the other of a cowardly and paltry spirit, 
which, as it were, muffles up a good thing in its 
lap. As he is capable of performing a journey 
upon his own feet, but yet would prefer to mount 
a carriage, just so he will be capable of being 
poor, yet will wish to be rich; he will own wealth, 
but will view it as an uncertain possession which 
will some day fly away from him. He will not 
allow it to be a burden either to himself or to 
any one else: he will give it—why do you prick 
up your ears? why do you open your pockets ?— 
he will give it either to good men or to those 
whom it may make into good men. He will give 
it after having taken the utmost pains to choose 
those who are fittest to receive it, as becomes one 
who bears in mind that he ought to give an 
account of what he spends as well as of what 
he receives. He will give for good and com- 
mendable reasons, for a gift ill bestowed counts 
as a shameful loss: he will have an easily opened 
pocket, but not one with a hole in it, so that 
much may be taken ont of it, yet nothing may 
fall out of it.

great point of merit; admiring picture by 
Protogenes, which bore evident’ marks of un- 
pounded laboriousness and the most minute finish, 
he remarked that in every respect Protogenes 
was fully his equal, or perhaps his superior, ex- 
cept in this, that he himself knew when to take 
his hand off a picture—a memorable lesson, which 
teaches us that over-carefulness may be produc- 
tive of bad results. His candor, too, was equal 
to his. talent; he acknowledged the superiority of 
Melanthius * in his grouping, and of Asclepio- 
dorus in the niceness of his measurements, or in 
other ‘words, the distances that ought to be left 
between the objects represented. 
aA. eireumstanee that happened to him in con- 
‘nection with Protogenes™ is worthy of notice. The 
latter was living at Rhodes, when Apelles dis- 
embarked there, desirous of seeing the works 
of.a man whom he had hitherto only known by 
reputation. Accordingly, he repaired at once to 
the studio; Protogenes was not at home, but there 
happened to be a large panel: upon the easel 
ready for painting, with an old woman who was 
- left in charge. To his inquiries she made answer 
that “Protogenes' was not at home; and: then 
asked whom she should name as the visitor. 
“‘Here he is,” was the reply of Apelles; and 
seizing a brush, he traced with color upon the 
2A painter of the Sicyonian school who flourished in 
. the third century B.c. 
1 Protogenes, a netive of Caria, in Asta Minor, was 
‘eélebrated as a painter at Rhodes in the second half of the fearth centary B.¢.

  panel an outline of.a singularly minute fineness. 
Upon his return the old woman mentioned to 
Protogenes what had happened. The. artist, it 
is said, upon remarking the delicacy: of. the touch, 
instantly exclaimed that Apelles must have been 
the visitor, for that no other person was capable 
of executing anything so exquisitely perfect.. So 
saying, he traced within the same outline astill 
finer outline, but with another color; and then 
took his departure, with instructions to the 
woman to show it to the stranger if he returned, 
and to let him know that this was the person 
whom he had come to see. 
It happened as he anticipated—Apelles re- 
turned; and vexed at finding himself thus sur- 
passed, he took up another color and split both 
of the outlines, leaving no possibility of any- 
thing finer being executed. Upon seeing this, 
Protogenes admitted that he was defeated, and 
at once flew to the harbor to look for his guest. 
He thought proper, too, to transmit the panel 
to posterity, just as it was; and it always con- 
tinued to be held in the highest admiration by 
all—artists in particular. I am told that it was 
burned in the first fire which took place at Ca~ 
sar’s palace on the Palatine Hill; but in former 
times I have often stopt to admire it. Upon 
its vast surface it contained nothing whatever 
except the three outlines, so remarkably fine as 
to escape the sight: among the most elaborate 
works of numerous other artists it had all the 
appearance of a blank space; and yet by that 
very fact it attracted the notice of every one, 
and was held in higher estimation than any other 
painting there.

Tt: was a custom with Apelles, to which he 
most: tenaciously adhered, never to let any day 
pass, however busy he might be, without exer- 
cising himself by tracing some-outline or other; 
a practise which has now passed into g proverb. 
It was also a practise with him, when he had 
completed a work, to exhibit it to tht view of 
the passers-by in some exposed place; while he 
himself, concealed. behind the picture, would 
listen to the criticisms that were passed upon it: 
it being his opinion that the judgment of the 
public was preferable to his own, as being the 
more discerning of the two. It was under these 
circumstances, they say, that he was censured 
bya. shoemaker for having represented the shoes 
with’ one shoe-string too little. The next day, 
‘the shoemaker, quite proud at seeing the former 
error corrected, thanks to his advice, began to 
eriticize the leg; upon which Apelles, full of 
indignation, popped his head out, and reminded 
him that a shoemaker should give no opinion 
beyond the shoes—a piece of advice which has 
equally passed into a proverbial saying. In fact, 
Apelles was a person of great amenity of man- 
ners—a@ circumstance which rendered him par- 
ticularly agreeable to Alexander the Great, who 
would often come to his studio. He had for- 
bidden himself by public edict, as already stated, 
to be represented by any other artist. On one 
occasion, however, when the prince was in his 
studio, talking a great deal about painting with- 
out knowing anything about it, Apelles quietly 
begged that he would quit the subject, telling 
him that he would get laughed at by the boys 
who were there grinding the colors; so great was

  the influence which he rightfully possest over a

the high estimation in which he beld: him: for 
having, in his admiration ‘of her extraordinary 
beauty, engaged Apelles to paint Pancaste un-

her; upon which, Alexander, perceiving this. to be

for sale: one of them was represented with 
drapery, and for this reason was preferred by 
the people of Cos, who had the choice; the second. 
was offered them atthe same price, but on the 
grounds of propriety and modesty they thought 
fit to choose the other. Upon this, the Cnidians

upon,’ beyond all doubt, as the most famous of 
artists; but to let those who have never seen 
his' works know how deservedly he is esteemed, 
we will take this opportunity of adducing a few 
slight proofs of the genius which he displayed. 
In ‘doing this we shall not appeal to the beauty 
of his Olympian Jupiter, nor yet to the vast 
proportions of his Athenian Minerva, six-and- 
twenty cubits in height, and composed of ivory 
and gold: but it is to the shield of this last 
statue that we shall draw attention; upon the 
convex face of which he has ehased a combat of 
the Amazons, while upon the coneave side of it 
he has represented the battle between the gods 
and the giants. Upon the sandals, again, we 
see the wars of the Lapithe and Centaurs; so 
careful has he been to fill every smallest portion 
of his work with some proof or other of his 
artistic skill.

THE ORATOR MUST BE A GOOD MAN‘ 
Lzr the orator, then, whom I propose to form, 
be such a one as is characterized by the definition 
of Mareus Cato, a good man skilled in speaking. 
But the requisite which Cato has placed first 
in this definition, that an orator should be 
a good man, is naturally of more estimation and 
importance than the other. It is of importance 
that an orator should be good, because, should 
the power of speaking be a support to evil, notl- 
ing would be more pernicious than eloquence 
alike to public concerns and private, and [ my- 
self, who, as far as is in my power, strive to 
contribute something to the faeulty of the orator, 
should ‘deserve very ill of the world, since I 
should furnish arms, not for soldiers, but for... 
robbers. May I not draw an argument from 
the condition of mankind? Nature herself, in

    bestowing on man that which she seems to have 
granted him preeminently, and by which she ap- 
pears to have distinguished us from all other 
animals, would have acted, not as a parent, but 
> as a stepmother, if she had designed the faculty 
of speech to be the promoter of erime, the op- 
pressor of innocence, and the enemy of truth; 
for it would have been better for us to have 
been born dumb, and to have been left destitute 
of reasoning powers, than to have received en- 
dowments from providence only to turn them to 
the destruction of one another. 
My judgment carries me still further; for I 
not only say that he who would answer my idea 
of an orator must be a good man, but that no 
man, unless he be good, can ever be an orator. 
To an orator discernment and prudence are nec- 
essary; but we can certainly not allow discern- 
ment to those, who when the ways of virtue and 
vice are set, before them, prefer to follow that of 
vice; nor can we allow them prudenee, since they 
subject themselves, by the unforeseen conse- 
quences of their actions, often to the heaviest 
penalty of the law, and always to that of an 
evil conseience. But if it be not only truly said 
by the wise, but always justly believed by the 
‘vulgar, that no man is vicious who is not also 
foolish, a fool, assuredly, will never become an 
orator. 
It is to be further considered that the mind 
ean not be in a condition for pursuing the most 
noble of studies, unless it be entirely free from 
vice} ‘not only because there can be no communion 
“of 'good and evil in the same breast, and to 
meditate at once on the best things and the worst

is no more in the power of the same mind than 
it is possible for the same man .to be at once 
virtuous and vicious; but also. bécayse a mind 
intent on so arduous a study should. be exempt 
from all other cares, even such as are uncon- 
nected with vice; for then, and then only, when 
it is free and master of itself, and when no other 
object harasses and distracts its attention, will 
it be able to keep in view the end to which it 
is devoted. But if an inordinate attention to an 
estate, a too anxious pursuit of wealth, indul- 
gence in the pleasures of the chase, and the de- 
votion of our days to publie spectacles, rob our 
studies of much of our time (for whatever time 
is given to one thing is lost to another), what 
effect must we suppose that ambition, avarice, and 
“envy will produce, whose excitements are so vio- 
lent as even to disturb our sleep and our dreams? 
Nothing indeed is so preoccupied, so unsettled, 
so torn and lacerated with such numerous and 
various passions, as a bad mind; for when it in- 
tends evil, it is agitated with hope, care, and 
anxiety, and when it has attained the object of 
its wickedness, it is tormented with uneasiness, 
and the dread of every kind of punishment. 
No man, certainly, will doubt, that it is the 
object of all oratory, that what is stated to the 
judge may appear to him to be true and. just; 
and which of the two, let me ask, will produce 
such a conviction with the greater ease, the good 
man or the bad? A good man, doubtless, will 
speak of what is true and honest with greater 
frequency; but even if, from being influenced 
by some call of duty, he endeavors to. support 
what is fallacious (a case which, as I shall show,

knowledge that Cicero stood at the head of elo- 
quence, and that I can searcely find a passage 
in'his speeches to which anything can be added, 
however many I might find which I may imagine 
that he would have pruned (for the learned have 
in general been of opinion that he had numerous 
excellences and some faults, and he himself says 
that he had eut off most of his juvenile exuber- 
ance),. yet, since he did not claim to himself, tho 
he had no mean opinion of his merits, the praise 
of perfection, and since he might certainly have 
spoken better if a longer life had been granted 
him, and a more tranquil season for composition, 
I may not unreasonably believe that the summit 
of excellence was not attained by him, to which, 
notwithstanding, no man made nearer ap- 
proaches. If I had thought otherwise, I might 
have maintained my opinion with still greater 
determination and freedom. Did Marcus Antonius 
declare that he had seen no man truly eloquent, 
tho to be eloquent. is. much less than to be a 
perfect orator; does Cicero himself say that he is 
still seeking for an orator, and merely conceives 
and imagines one; and shall I fear to say that in 
that. portion of eternity which is yet to come 
something may arise still more excellent than 
what has: yet been seen? I take no advantage 
of the opinion of those who refuse to allow great 
merit to Cicero and Demosthenes even in elo- 
quence; tho Demosthenes, indeed, does not ap- 
pear sufficiently near perfection even to Cicero 
himself, who says that he sometimes nods; nor 
does Cicero appear so to Brutus and Calvus, who 
certainly find fault with his language.

  prince, took under his command the common- 
wealth, exhausted with civil dissensions. But the 
affairs of the ancient Roman people, whether pros- 
perous or adverse, have been recorded by writers 
of renown. Nor were there wanting authors of 
distinguished genius to have composed the his- 
tory of the times of Augustus, till by the spirit 
of flattery, which became prevalent, they were 
deterred. As to Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and 
Nero, whilst they yet reigned the histories of 
their times were falsified through fear; and after 
they had fallen, they were written under the in- 
fluence of recent detestation. Thence my own 
design of recounting a few incidents respecting 
Augustus, and those toward the latter part of 
his life; and, after that, of giving a history of 
the reign of Tiberius and the rest; uninfluenced 
by resentment and partiality, as I stand aloof 
from the causes of them. 
When, after the fall of Brutus and Cassius, 
there remained none: to fight for the common- 
wealth; when Sextus Pompeius was utterly de- 
feated at Sicily; and Lepidus being deprived of 
his command, and Mark Antony slain, there re- 
mained no leader even to the Julian party but 
Octavius; having put off the name of triumvir, 
styling himself Consul, and pretending that all 
he aimed at was the jurisdiction attached to the 
tribuneship for the protection of the commons; 
when he had eajoled the soldiery by donations, 
the ‘people by distribution of corn, and men in 
general by the charms of peace, he (Octavius) 
began by gradations to exalt himself over them; 
to. draw to himself the functions of the senate 
and of the magistrate, and the framing of. the 
178

laws; in which he was thwarted by no man: the 
boldest spirits having fallen in some or other of 
the regular battles, or by proscription; and the 
surviving nobility being distinguished by wealth 
and public honors, according to the measure of 
their promptness to bondage; and as these in- 
novations had been the cause of aggrandizement 
to them, preferring the present state of things 
with safety to the revival of ancient. liberty with 
personal peril. Neither were the provinces averse 
to that condition of affairs; since they mistrusted 
the government of the senate and people, on 
account of the contentions among the great and 
the avarice of the magistrates: while the pro- 
tection of the laws was enfeebled and borne 
down by violence, intrigue, and bribery. 
Moreover, Augustus, as supports to his dom- 
ination, raised his sister’s son, Claudius Mar- 
cellus? a mere youth, to the dignity of pontiff 
and curule edile; aggrandized by two successive 
consulships Mareus Agrippa,’ a man meanly born,

honge,. For into the family of the Cesars he 
had ‘already. adopted Lucius and ‘Cains, the sons 
of Agrippa; and tho they had not yet laid aside 
the puerile garment, vehement had. been his am- 
bition to see them declared princes of the Roman 
youth, and even designed to the consulship; while 
he affected to decline the honors for them. Upon 
the decease of Agrippa, they were cut off, either 
by a death premature but natural, or by the arts 
of their stepmother Livia; Lucius on his journey 
to the armies in’ Spain, Caius on his return from 
Armenia, ill of a wound: and as Drusus had been 
long since dead, Tiberius Nero was the only 
survivor, of his stepsons. On him every honor 
was accumulated (to that quarter all things in- 
elined); he was by Augustus adopted for his 
son, assumed colleague in the empire, partner in 
the tribunitian authority, and presented to the 
déveral armies; not from the secret machinations 
of his mother, as heretofore, but at her open 
suit, For over Augustus, now very aged, she had 
obtained such absolute sway, that he banished 
into the isle of Planasia his only surviving grand- 
son, Agrippa Posthumus; a person destitute in- 
deed of liberal accomplishments, and a man of 
elownish brutality with great hodily strength, 
but convicted of no heinous offense. The em- 
peror, strange to say, set Germanicus, the son 
‘of Drusus, over eight legions quartered upon the 
Rhine, and ordered: that he should be engrafted 
into his family by Tiberius by adoption, tho Ti-

-of manhood; but the object was that he might 
-.stand firm by having many to support and pro-

greatest part were occupied in circulating various 
surmises reflecting upon those who seemed likely 
to be their masters: ‘‘That Agrippa was nat-

  and inherent pride of the Claudian family; and 
many indications of cruel nature escaped him, 
in spite of all his arts to disguise it; that even 
from his early infancy he had been ‘trained up 
in’an imperial house} that consulships and tri- 
umphs had been aceunulated upon him while but 
a youth. Not even during the years of his abode 
at Rhodes, where under the plausible name of 
retirement, he was in fact an exile, did he employ 
himself otherwise than in meditating future 
vengeance, studying the arts of simulation, and 
practising secret and abominable sensualities. 
That to these considerations was added that of 
his mother, a woman with the ungovernable spirit 
peculiar to her sex; that the Romans must be 
under bondage toa woman, and moreover to two 
youths, who would meanwhile oppress the state, 
and, at one time or other, rend it piecemeal.’’ 
“ While the public mind was agitated by these 
and. similar discussions, the illness of Augustus 
grew daily more serious, and some suspected 
nefarious practises on the part of his wife. For 
some months before, a rumor had gone abroad 
that Augustus, having singled out a few to whom 
he communicated his purpose, had taken Fabius 
Maximus for his only companion, had sailed over 
to the island of Planasia, to visit Agrippa; that 
many tears were shed on both sides, many tokens 
of mutual tenderness shown, and hopes from 
thence conceived. that the youth would be re- 
stored to the household gods of his grandfather. 
That Maximus had disclosed this to Martia, his 
wife—she to Livia; and that the emperor was 
informed of it: and that Maximus, not long

neighboring municipal towns, some thinking it 
due as a mark of respect to the prince, but the 
greater part carried along with the current, 
rushed to the city of Brundusium, the readiest 
port in her way, and the safest landing. As soon 
as the fleet appeared in the deep, instantly were 
filled, ‘not, the port alone and adjacent parts of

the most distant prospect could be obtained, with

course would be most suitable to the oceasion, 
when’ the fleet came slowly in, not as nsual in 
sprightly trim, but all wearing ‘the impress of 
sadness. When she descended from the ship,

There were those who missed the pomp of, a

observing, ‘‘that he, himself had traveled, in the

city; around his bier were crowded the images 
of the Claudii and Julii; he was mourned in the 
forum; his encomium pronounced on the rostra; 
all the honors invented by our ancestors, er added 
by their posterity, were heaped upon him, But to 
Germanieus were denied the ordinary solemnities, 
and such as were due to every distinguished 
Roman. Certainly his corpse was burned ‘in a

things which became private families and small 
states, became not princes and ‘an imperial peo- 
ple; that it was not unseemly to lament in the 
first transport of sorrow, nay, relief was afforded 
by weeping, but it was now time to recover and

upon the loss of an only daughter; thus the 
deified Augustus, upon. the premature death of 
his grandsons, had both concealed their sorrow. 
More ancient examples were unnecessary; how

tered. In his death he maintained’ the most.iin-

suffered. The destruction of Seneca followed,

    Seneca, then indisposed, to complain that he was 
refused admittance; and to represent, that it 
would be better if they maintained their friend- 
ship by intercourse: that to. this Seneca replied, 
that talking to each other and frequent inter- 
views were to the service of neither; but upon 
the safety of Piso his own security rested.’’? Gra- 
nius Silvanus, tribune of a pretorian cohort, 
was ordered to represent this to Seneca, and to 
demand of him, ‘‘ whether he admitted the words 
of Natalis, and his own answers.’’ Seneca had 
that very day, either from chance or design, re- 
turned from Campania, and rested at a villa of 
his, four miles from Rome: thither arrived the 
tribune toward evening, and beset the villa with 
his: men; and then, as he sat at table with Paul- 
line his wife, and two friends, delivered his 
orders from the emperor. 
Seneca replied, ‘‘that Natalis had in truth been 
sent to him, and in the name of Piso complained, 
that he was debarred from visiting him; and that 
he had excused himself on. the score of illness 
and his love of retirement; but he had no motive 
to declare that he preferred the safety of a pri- 
vate man to his own security; nor was his dis- 
position prone to flattery; as no man better knew 
than Nero, who had experienced more frequent 
proofs of the freedom than the servility of 
Seneca.’? .

to Nero, in presence of Poppea™ and Tigellinus,

mistress of Nero. She was afterward divorced from Otho

who composed the cabinet couneil,.the raging 
tyrant asked, whether Seneca meditated a volun-

manifested no symptoms of fear; and‘ neither in 
his words nor looks did he detect any indication 
of regret.’? He was therefore commanded. to 
return, and tell him he was doomed ‘to: die. 
Fabius Rusticus writes, ‘‘that the tribune’ did. 
not return by the road he went, but. turning off 
went to Fenius, captain of the guards, and stating 
to him the emperor’s orders, asked whether he - 
should obey him; and was by him admonished 
to execute them’’; thus displaying that want of’ 
spirit which by some fatality prevailed univer- - 
sally; for Silvanus too was one of the conspira-'.. 
tors, and yet was contributing to multiply the 
atrocities he had conspired to avenge. He avoided, 
however, seeing and speaking to Seneca; but 
sent in a centurion to apprize him of his final 
doom. 
Seneca -undismayed, called for tables to make 
his will; and, as this was prohibited by the cen-. « 
turion, turning to his friends, he told them, ‘‘that; 
since he was debarred from requiting their serv-. 
ices, he bequeathed them that which alone was 
now left. him, but which yet was the fairest, 
legacy he had to leave them—the example of ‘his 
life: and if they kept it in view, they would’ 
reap the fame due to honorable aequirements and 
inviolable friendship.”? At the same time he 
endeavored to repress their tears and restore 
their fortitude, now by soothing language, and 
now in a more animated strain and in a tone of 
rebuke, asking them, ‘‘ where were the. precepts 
of philosophy? where the rules of conduct. under

-who'was unapprized of the ferocious disposition 
of Nero? Nor could anything else be expected 
‘after he had murdered his mother ‘and. brother, 
., than that he should proceed to destroy his 
‘Bursing father and preceptor.’’ 
After these and similar reasonings addrest to 
the company in general, he embraced his wife; 
and after a brief but vigorous effort to get the 
better of the apprehensions that prest upon him 
at that moment, he besought and implored her 
‘‘to refrain from surrendering herself to end- 
Jess grief; but endeavor to mitigate her regret 
for. ‘her husband by means of those honorable 
eonsolations which she would experience in the 
edntemplation of his virtuous life’? Paulina, 
on, the contrary, urged her purpose to die with 
him, and ealled for the hand of the executioner. 
. "When Seneca, unwilling to impede her glory, and 
also from affection, as he was anxious not to 
leave ‘one who was dear to him above everything, 
exposed to the hard usage of the world, thus 
addrest her: ‘‘I had pointed out to you how to 
soften ‘the ills of life; but you prefer the re- 
nown of dying: I will not’ envy you the honor 
of the example. Tho both display the same 
unflinching fortitude in encountering death; still 
the glory of your exit will be superior to mine.’? 
. After ‘this, both had the veins of their arms 
-opened with the same stroke. As the blood 
flowed slowly from the aged body of Seneca,

was stayed at the foot of Esquillix, by pulling 
down an immense quantity of buildings, so that 
an open space, and, as it were, void air, might 
check the raging element by breaking the con-

gold and precious stones, were not so much the.

we --ROME* ! - (69 AD.) - 
Marrtatis had scareely reentered the Capitol, 
when the furious soldiers appeared: before it, 
without a general, and each man acting on his 
own ‘suggestions. ° Having rapidly passed the 
forum, and the temples. that overlook it, they 
marched up the opposite: hill, as far-as the first 
gates of the citadel. On the right side of the 
‘ageent, a-range of porticoes had been built in 
avicient times. Going out upon the roof of those, 
‘the besieged threw a shower of stones and tiles. 
The assailants had no weapons but their swords, 
and to fetch engines and missiles seemed a te- 
dious delay. They threw brands into the portico 
that jutted near them. They followed up the 
fire, and would have foreed their way through 
the gate of the Capitol, which the fire had laid 
hold of; if Sabinus had not placed as a barrier 
in the very approach, in lieu of a wall, the 
statues, those honérable monuments of our an- 
cestors, which were pulled down wherever they 
could ‘be found. They then assaulted the Capitol 
in two different quarters; near the grove of the 
' asylum, and where the Tarpeian rock is ascended 
“by a hundred steps. Both attacks were unfore-

thence to the porticoes adjoining the temples: 
      soon the eagles that supported the cupola caught oS 
fire, and as the timber was old they fed the flame. - 
Thus the Capitol, with its gates shut, neither : 
stormed, nor defended, was burned to the ground. 
From the foundation of the city to that. hour, 
the Roman republic had felt no calamity so 
deplorable, so shocking, as that, unassailed by 
a foreign enemy, and, were it not for the vices 
of the age, with the deities propitious, the temple 
of Jupiter supremely good and great, built by.

over his. opponents, undertook to build it, but 
nevertheless did not dedicate it; the only thing 
wanting to crown his felicity. That honor was

undecided what orders to give. With troops 
harassed by exertions through the night and day, 
to carry the place by storm was diffieult, and, 
without succors at hand, might be dangerous; 
but if they marched to Bedriacum, the fatigue 
would be insupportable, and the victory would 
end in nothing. To throw up intrenchments was 
dangerous, in the face of an enemy, who might 
suddenly sally forth and put them. to the rout, 
while employed on the work in detached parties.

delay: inasmuch as a state of security afforded

“attack began at a distance with a volley of 
“stones and darts, with the greater loss to the 
‘ Flavians, on whom the enemy’s weapons were 
thrown with advantage from above. Antonius 
presently assigned portions of the rampart and 
the gates to the legions that by this mode of at- 
tack in. different quarters, valor and ¢owardice 
might be ‘distinguished, and a spirit of emula- 
tion in honor animate the army. The third and

supplied themselves from the neighboring villages

shell with their shields raised above their heads,

of a wedge, endeavored to force their way, while 
the third hewed down the gate with axes. and

The latter was regarded by the garrison as an 
aid, from the increase of numbers; but: inflamed 
| the ardor of the besiegers on the seore of booty. 
Antonius ordered his men to take-combustibles, 
“and set fire to the most elegant edifices without 
the city; if, peradventure, the inhabitants, seeing 
their mansions destroyed, would be induced to 
abandon the adverse cause, In the houses that 
stood near the walls, of a height.to overlook the 
works, he placed the bravest of his troops; and 
from those stations beams, tiles and_firebrands 
were thrown down to drive the defenders of the 
walls from their posts. - 
’ The legions under Antonius now formed a mil- 
itary shell, while the rest poured in a volley of 
‘stones and darts; when the spirit of the besieged 
gradually gave way. The men highest in rank 
were willing to make terms for themselves, lest, 
if Cremona was taken by storm, they should re- 
ceive no quarter, and the conquerors, disdaining 
vulgar lives, should fall ‘on the tribunes and 
centurions, from whom the largest’ booty was to 
be expected: The common men, as usual, careless 
about future events, and safe in their obscurity, 
still held out. Roaming about the streets, or 
lurking in private houses, they did not sue for 
peace even when they had given up the contest. 
The principal officers took. down the name and 
images of Vitellius. Ceeina, for he was still in 
eonfinement, they released from his fetters, and 
desired his. aid in pleading their cause with the 
onqueror. He heard their petition with disdain,

when so many brave and gallant: men were ob- . 
liged to sue to a traitor for ‘protection! They. 
then hung out from the walls the: fillets and 
badges of supplicants. When Antonius:ordered 
a cessation of hostilities, the garrison ‘brought 
out their eagles and standards; a mournful train 
of soldiers without their arms, their eyes riveted 
to the ground, followed them. The conquerors 
gathered round them, and first heaped reproaches 
upon them, and threatened violence to their per- 
sons; but afterward, when they saw the passive- 
ness with which they received the insults, and 
that the vanquished, abandoning all their former 
pride, submitted to every indignity, the thought 
occurred that these very men lately conquered 
at Bedriacum, and used their victory with mod- 
eration. But when Cecina came forth, decorated 
with his robes, and preceded by his lietors, who 
opened a way for him through the crowd, the 
indignation of the victors burst into a fiame. 
They reproached him for his pride, his cruelty, 
and even for his treachery: so detested is vil- 
lay. Antonius opposed the fury of his men, 
and sent him under escort to Vespasian. 
Meanwhile, the common people of Cremona, 
in the midst of so many soldiers, were subjected 
to grievous oppressions, and were in danger of 
being all put to the sword, if the rage of the 
soldiery had not been assuaged by the entreat™ 
of their leaders: Antonius called them to 
assembly, when he spoke of the conquerors 
lofty terms, and of the vanquished with huma

the' extirpation of the inhabitants. In the war 
‘Othe they were deemed the abettors of 
ius; and afterward, when the thirteenth 
“ nm was left among. them to build an amphi- 
“theater, with the usual insolence of the lower 
orders in towns, they had assailed them with 
offensive ribaldry. The spectacle of gladiators 
exhibited there by Cacina inflamed the animosity 
against the people. Their city, too, was now 
for the second time the seat of war; and, in the 
heat of the last engagement, the Vitellians were 
thence supplied with refreshments; and some of 
their women, led into the field of battle by their 
zeal for the cause, were slain. The period, too, 
of the fair had given to a colony otherwise afflu- 
‘ént an imposing appearance of accumulated 
wealth. Antonius, by his fame and brilliant sue- 
. eess, eclipsed all the other commanders: the at- 
. tention of all was fixt on him alone. He hastened 
tothe baths to wash off the blood; and on ob- 
serving that the water was not hot enough, he 
said that they would soon grow hotter. The 
expression was caught up: a casual word among 
slaves had the effect of throwing upon him the 
whole odium of having given a signal for setting 
fire to Cremona, which was already in flames. 
Forty thousand armed men had poured into 
it. The number of drudges and eamp-followers 
was still greater, and more abandoned to lust 
and cruelty. Neither age nor dignity served as 
a protection; deeds of lust were perpetrated 
amidst scenes of carnage, and murder was added 
to rape. Aged men and women that had passed 
their prime, and who were useless as booty, were 
made the objects of brutal sport. If.a mature

in their way, after being torn piecemeal by the 
rude hands of contending ruffians, they at last 
were the oceasion of their turning their swords 
against each other. While eagerly catrying off 
money or massy gold from the temples, they were 
butchered by others stronger than themselves. 
Not content with the treasures that lay open totheir 
view, some forced the owsers to discover: their 
hidden wealth, and dig up their buried riches, 
Numbers carried flaming torches, and, as soon ag 
they had brought forth their booty, in their wan- 
ton sport set the gutted houses and plundered 
temples on fire. In an army differing in language 
and manners, composed of Roman citizens, allies, 
and foreign auxiliaries, all the diversities of 
passions were exhibited. Hach had his separate 
notions of right and wrong; nor was anything un- ~ 
lawful. Four days did Cremona minister to their 
rapacity. When everything else, sacred ‘and 
profane, was leveled in the conflagration, the 
temple of Memphitis alone remained standing, 
outside of the walls; saved either by its situa- 
tion, or the influence of the deity. 
Such was the fate of Cremona, two hundred 
and eighty-six years from its foundation. It was: 
built during the consulship of Tiberius Sempro- 
nius and Publius Cornelius, at the time when 
Hannibal threatened an irruption into Italy, as 
a bulwark against the Gauls inhabiting beyond 
the Po, or any other power that might break in 
over the Alps. The colony, as might be expeete

ofthis horrible transaction (for the detestation 
- it-exeited was inereasing), issned an edict for- 
“bidding all manner of persons to detain the citi- 
zens of Cremona as prisoners of war. At the 
same time the booty was rendered valueless by

purehase the captives taken on that occasion.

position that military men, habituated to the 
unscrupulous and summary processes of camps, 
where things are carried with a strong hand, are 
deficient in the address and subtlety of genius 
requisite in civil jurisdiction. Agricola, however, 
by his natural prudence, was enabled to act-with 
facility and precision even among civilians... He 
distinguished the hours of business from those 
of relaxation. When the court or tribunal de- 
manded his presence, he was grave, intent, awful, 
yet generally inclined to lenity. When the duties 
of his office were over, the man of power was in- 
stantly laid aside. Nothing of sternness, ar- 
yoganee, or rapaciousness appeared; and, what 
was a singular felicity, his affability did not — 
impair his authority, ner his severity render him 
less beloved. To mention integrity and free- 
dom from corruption in such a man, would be an 
affront to his virtues. He did not even court 
reputation, an object to which men of worth

mersed in thick darkness, and a heavy shower of 
ashes rained upon us, which we were obliged 
every now and then to stand up to shake off, 
otherwise we should have been érusht and buried 
in the heap.

degrees, like a cloud or smoke; the real day re-

divers manifest prodigies. As he was finishing

him several times, and then directed its course to 
a neighboring temple, where it settled upon the 
name of Agrippa, and at the first letter. Upon 
observing this, he ordered his colleague Tiberius 
to put up the vows, which it is usual to make on 
such oecasions, for the succeeding Lustrum. For 
he declared he would not meddle with what it . 
was probable he should never accomplish, tho 
the tables were ready drawn for it. About the

his journey, he went as far as Astura, whence, 
contrary to his custom, he put to sea in the 
night-time, as there was a favorable wind. 
His ‘malady ‘proceeded from diarrhea; not-

  any other way than the purchaséiof Alexandrian 
merchandise. And during several days after- 
ward, he distributed Togs and Pallia, among 
other gifts, on condition thatthe Romans should 
use the Greek and the Greeks the Rotman dress 
and language. He likewise constantly ‘attended 
to see the boys perform their exercises, according 
to an ancient custom still continued at Capri. 
He gave them likewise an entertainment in’ his 
presence, and not only permitted, but required 
from them the utmost freedom in jesting, and 
scrambling for fruit, victuals, and other things 
which he threw.among them. In a word, he in- 
dulged himself in all the ways of amusement he 
could contrive. . . . . 
Upon the day of his death, he now and then 
inquired if there was any disturbance in the town 
on his account; and calling for a mirror, he ~ 
ordered his hair to ‘be combed, and his shrunk 
cheeks to be adjusted. Then asking his friends 
who were admitted into the room, ‘‘Do ye think 
that I have acted my part on the stage of life 
well?’ he immediately subjoined, 
“Tf all be right, with joy your voices raise, 
In loud applauses to the actor’s praise.’” 
After which, having dismissed them all, whilst 
he was inquiring of some persons who were just 
arrived from Rome, concerning Drusus’s dangh- 
ter, who was in a bad state of health, he ex- 
pired suddenly, amidst the kisses of Livia, and 
with these words: ‘‘Livia! live mindful of our 
union; and now, farewell!’’ dying a very easy 
death, and such as he himself had always wished 
for. For as often as he heard that any person

had. died. quickly and without pain,,he wished 
for ‘himself and his friends the like euthanasia 
(an easy death), for that was the word he made 
uge.of. He betrayed but one symptom, before he 
breathed his last, of being delirious, which was 
this: he was all on a sudden much frightened, 
and complained that he was carried away by 
forty men. But this was rather a presage, than 
any delirium: for precisely that number of sol- 
diers, belonging to the pretorian cohort, carried 
out his corpse, 
He expired in the same room in which his 
father Octavius had died, when the two Sextus’s, 
Pompey and Apuleius, were Consuls, upon the 
fourteenth of the calends of September [the 19th 
August], at the ninth hour of the day, being sev- 
enty-six years of age, wanting only thirty-five days. 
His remains were carried by the magistrates of 
the municipal towns and colonies, from Nola to 
Boville; and in the night-time because of the 
season of the year. During the intervals, the 
_body lay in some basilica, or great temple, of 
each town. At Boville it was met by the Eques- 
trian Order, who carried it to the city, and de- 
posited it in the vestibule of his own house. The 
senate proceeded with so much zeal in the ar- 
rangement of his funeral, and paying honor to 
his memory, that, among several other proposals, 
some were for having the funeral procession 
made through the triumphal gate, preceded by 
the image of Victory which is in the senate- 
house, and the children of ‘highest rank and of 
both sexes. singing the funeral dirge. Others

proposed, that on the day of the funeral, they 
should lay aside their gold rings, ‘and wear rings 
of iron; and others, that his bones should be col- 
lected by the priests of the principal’ ¢olleges. 
One likewise proposed to transfer the. mame of 
August to September, because he was born.in 
the latter, but died in the former. Another © 
moved, that the whole period of time, from his 
birth to his death, should be called the Augustan 
age, and be inserted in the ealendar under. that 
title. But at last it was judged proper to be 
moderate in the honors paid to his memory. Two’ 
funeral orations were pronounced in his praise, 
one before the temple of Julius, by Tiberius; 
and.the other before the rostra, under the old. 
shops, by Drusus, Tiberius’s son. The body was 
then carried upon the shoulders of senators into - 
the Campus Martius, and there burned. A man 
of pretorian rank affirmed upon oath, that he . 
saw his spirit ascend from the funeral pile to 
heaven. The most distinguished persons of the: 
equestrian order, barefooted, and. with their 
tunies loose, gathered up his relics, and deposited — 
them in the mausoleum‘ which had been built 
jn his sixth consulship between the Flaminian 
Way and the bank of the Tiber; at which time 
likewise he gave the groves and walks about it 
for the use of the people. , 
«This mausoleum was of white marble rising in terraces 
to a great height, and was crowned by a dome on which 
stood a statue of Augustus. Marcellus waa the first .person

prayers were appointed to be put up.to the gods 
upon that account; and the verses which had 
‘been publicly read, were, after being written in 
gold letters, consecrated to Jupiter Capitolinus. 
-. He presented the people with a great number 
“and variety of spectacles, as the Juvenal and 
Circensian games, stage-plays, and an exhibition 
of gladiators. In the Juvenal, he even admitted 
senators and aged matrons to perform parts. In 
the Circensian games, he assigned the equestrian 
order seats apart from the rest of the people, 
and had races performed by chariots drawn each 
by‘four camels. In the games which he instituted 
for the eternal duration of the empire, and there- 
fore ordered to be called Maxim, many of the 
senatorian and equestrian order, of both’ sexes, 
performed. A distinguished Roman knight de- 
scended on the stage by a rope, mounted on an 
elephant. A Roman play, likewise, composed by 
Afranius, was brought upon the stage. It was 
entitled, ‘‘The Fire’’; and in it the performers 
were allowed to carry off, and to keep to them- 
selves, the furniture of the house, which as the 
plot of the play required, was burned down in 
the theater. Every day during the solemnity, 
many thousand articles of all descriptions were 
thrown among the people to seramble for; such 
as fowls of different kinds, tickets for corn, 
clothes, gold, silver, gems, pearls, pictures, slaves, 
beasts of burden, wild beasts that had been 
tamed; at last, ships, lots of houses, and lands, 
were offered as prizes in a lottery.

exhibited in a wooden amphitheater,,built within 
a year in the district of the Campus: Martius, he . 
ordered that none should be slain, not even the 
condemned criminals employed in the‘ combats. 
He secured four hundred senators, and six hun- 
‘dred Roman knights, among whom were some 
of unbroken fortunes and unblemished reputa- 
tion, to act as gladiators. From the same orders, 
lhe engaged persons to encounter wild beasts, and 
for various other services in the theater. He’ 
presented the public with the representation of 
a naval fight, upon sea-water, with huge fishes 
swimming in it; as also with the Pyrrhie dance, 
performed by certain youths, to each of whom, 
after the performance was over, he granted the 
freedom of Rome. During this. diversion, a bull 
covered Pasiphaé, concealed within a wooden :° 
statue of a cow, as many of the spectators be- 
lieved. Icarus, upon his first attempt to fiy, fell 
on the stage close to the emperor’s pavilion, and 
bespattered him with blood. For he very seldom 
presided in the games, but used to view them 
reclining on a couch, at first through some narrow 
apertures, but afterward with the Podium quite 
open. He was the first who instituted, in imita- 
tion of the Greeks, a trial of skill in the three

racing, to be performed at Rome every five years,

He was terrified with manifest warnings, both 
old and new, arising from dreams, auspices, and: 
omens. He had never been used to dream before 
the murder of his mother. After that event, he 
fancied in his sleep that he was steering a ship, 
and that the rudder was forced from. him: that 
he was dragged by his wife Octavia into a pro- 
digiously dark place; and was at one time cov-

  Spanish jennet he was fond of, had his hinder 
parts so changed as to resemble those:of an ape; 
and that having his head only left unaltered, he 
neighed very harmoniously. The doors of the 
mausoleum of Augustus flying open of them- 
selves, there issued from it a voice, calling on 
him by name. The Lares. being adorned with 
” fresh garlands on the calends (the first) of Janu- 
ary, fell down during the preparations for sac- 
rificing to them. While he was taking the omens, 
Sporus presented him with a ring, the stone of 
which had carved upon it the Rape of Proserpine. 
When a great multitude of several orders was 
assembled, to attend at the solemnity of making 
vows to the gods, it was a long time before the 
keys of the Capitol could be found. And when, 
ina speech of his to the senate against Vindex, 
these words: were read, ‘‘that the miscreants 
should be punished and soon make the end they 
merited,’’ ‘they all cried out, ‘‘You will do it, 
Augustus.’? It was likewise remarked, that the 
last tragie piece which he sung, was Cidipus in 
Exile, and that he fell as he was repeating this 
verse: . 
‘<Wife, mother, father, force me to my end.’” 
Meanwhile, on the arrival of the news that 
the rest of the armies had declared against him, 
he tore to piece the letters which were delivered 
to him at dinner, overthrew the table, and dashed 
with violence against the ground two favorite 
eups, which he called Homer’s, because some of 
‘that poet’s verses were cut upon them. Then 
taking from Locusta a dose of poison, which he 
put up in a golden box, he. went into the Ser-

unes and centurions of the pretorian guards to 
attend him in his flight; but part of them show- 
ing no great inclination to comply, others ab- 
solutely refusing, and one of them erying out 
aloud, : . 
‘Say, is it then so sad a thing to die?’’ 
he was in great perplexity whether he should 
submit himself to Galba,” or apply to the Par- 
thians for protection, or else appear before the 
people drest in mourning, and, upon the rostra, 
in the most piteous manner, beg pardon for his 
past misdemeanors, and, if he could not prevail, 
request of them to grant him at least. the gov- 
ernment of Egypt. A speech to this purpose 
was afterward found in his writing-ease. But 
it is conjectured that he durst not venture upon 
this project, for fear of being torn to pieces, 
before he could get to the forum. 
Deferring, therefore, his resolution until the 
next day, he awoke about midnight, and finding 
the guards withdrawn, he leapt out of bed, and 
sent round for his friends. But none of them 
vouchsafing any message in reply, he went with - 
a few attendants to their houses.. The doors 
being everywhere shut, and no one giving him 
any answer, he returned to his bed-chamber; 
whence those who had the charge of it had all 
now eloped; some having gone one way, and 
some another, carrying off with them his bedding

  and box of poison. He then endeavored to find 
Spicillus, the gladiator, or some one to kill him; 
but:not being able to procure any one, ‘‘What!?? 
said’ he, ‘‘have I then neither friend nor foe?’’ 
and immediately ran out, as if he would throw 
himself into the Tiber. : . 
But this furious impulse subsiding, he wished 
for some place of privacy, where he might collect 
his thoughts; and his freedman Phaon offering him 
his country-house, between the Salarian and No- 
mentan roads, about four miles from the city, he 
mounted a horse, barefoot as he was, and in 
his tunie, only slipping over it an old soiled 
cloak; with bis head muffled up, and a hand- 
kerchief before his face, and four persons only 
to attend him, of whom Sporus was one. He 
was suddenly struck with horror by an earth- 
quake, and by a flash of lightning which darted 
fall in his face, and heard from the neighboring 
camp the shouts of the soldiers, wishing his de- 
struction, and prosperity to Galba. He also 
heard a traveler they met on the road, say, 
‘They are in pursuit of Nero’’: and another ask, 
_ “Tg there any news in the city about Nero?’’ 
Uneovering his face when his horse was started 
by the scent of a careass which lay in the road, 
he was recognized and saluted by an old soldier 
who had been discharged from the guards. When 
they eame to the lane which turned up to the 
house, they quitted their horses, and with much 
difficulty he wound.among bushes and briars, and 
_ along. a track through a bed of rushes, over 
‘which they spread their cloaks for him to walk 
on. Having reached a wall at the back of the 
villa, Phaon advised him to hide himself a while

  in a sand-pit; when he replied, ‘I will not go 
underground alive.’? Staying there some little 
time, while preparations were made ‘for bringing 
him privately into the villa, he took up some 
water out of a neighboring tank in his hand, to 
drink, saying, ‘‘This is Nero’s distilled. water.’’ 
Then his cloak having been torn by the brambles, 
he pulled out the thorns which stuck in it. At 
last, being admitted, ereeping upon his hands and 
knees, through a hole made for him in the wall, 
he lay down in the first closet he came to, upon 
a miserable pallet, with an old coverlet thrown 
over it; and being both hungry and thirsty, tho 
he refused some coarse bread that was brought 
him, he drank a little warm water. . 
All who surrounded him now pressing him to 
save himself from the indignities whieh were 
ready to befall him, he ordered a pit to be sunk 
before his eyes, of the size of his body, and the 
bottom to be covered with pieces of marble put 
together, if any could be found about the house; 
and water and wood to be got ready for im- 
mediate use about his corpse; weeping at every- 
thing that was done, and frequently saying, 
‘*What an artist is now about to perish!’’? Mean- 
while, letters being brought in by a servant be- 
longing to Phaon, he snatched them out of his 
hand, and there read, ‘‘That he had been de- 
clared an enemy by the senate, and that search 
was making for him, that he might be punished 
according to the ancient custom of the Romans.”’ 
He then inquired what kind of punishment that 
was; and being told, that the practise was to 
strip the criminal naked, and scourge him to 
death while his neck was fastened within a

  forked’ stake,‘ he was so terrified that he took 
up two daggers which he had brought with him, 
and after feeling the points of both, put them 
up again, saying, ‘‘The fatal hour is not yet 
come.’’ One while, he begged of Sporus to begin 
to wail and lament; another while, he entreated 
that one of them would set him ‘an example by 
Killing himself; and then again, he condemned 
his own want of resolution in these words: ‘‘T 
yet live to my shame and disgrace: this is not 
becoming for Nero: it is not becoming. Thou 
oughtest in such circumstances to have a good 
heart: Come then: courage, man!’’ The horse- 
men who had received orders to bring him away 
alive, were now approaching the house. As soon 
as he heard them coming, he uttered with a 
trembling voice the following verse, , 
‘The noise of swift-heel’d steeds assails my ears’’: '

his neck was thick, his belly prominent, his legs 
very slender, his constitution sound! For, tho 
excessively luxurious in his mode of living, he 
had, in the course of fourteen years, only three 
fits of sickness; which were so slight, that he 
neither forbore the use of wine, nor made any 
alteration in his usual diet. In his dress, and 
the care of his person, he was so careless, that 
he had his hair cut in rings, one above another; 
and when in Achaia, he let it grow long bebind; 
and he generally appeared in public in the loose 
dress which he used at table, with a handkerchief 
about his neck and without either a girdle or 
shoes.

HIS DEBT TO OTHERS*

good. morals and the government of my temper. 
2. From the reputation and remembrance of 
my father, modesty and a manly character. 
3. From my mother,’ piety and_beneficence, 
and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but 
even from evil thoughts; and, further, simplicity 
in my way of living, far removed from the habits 
of the rich.” 
4, From my great-grandfather, not to have fre- 
quented publie schools, and to have had good 
teachers at home, and to know that on such 
things a man should spend liberally.

green nor of the blue party at the games in the eireus, nor a partizan either of the Parmularius 
or the Scutarius at the gladiators’ fights; from 
him too I learned endurance of labor and to 
want little, and to work with my own hands, and 
not to meddle with other people’s affairs, and 
not to be ready to listen to slander. 
6. From Diognetus, not to busy myself about 
trifling things, and not to give credit to what was 
said by miracle-workers and jugglers about in- 
eantations and the driving away of demons and 
such things; and not to breed quails {for 
fighting], not to give myself up passionately to 
such things; and to endure freedom of speech; 
and to have become intimate with philosophy; 
and to have been a hearer, first of Baecchius, then 
of Tandasis and Marcianus; and to have written 
dialogs in my youth; and to have desired a plank 
bed and skin, and whatever else of the kind be- 
longs to the Grecian discipline. 
7. From Rusticus’ I received the impreasion 
that my character required improvement and dis- 
eipline; and from him I learned not to be led 
astray to sophistic emulation, nor to writing on 
speculative matters, nor to delivering little horta- 
tory orations, nor to showing myself off as a man 
who practises much discipline, or does benevolent

very much to know what the religion of the Christians was,

  acts in order to make a display; and:to abstain 
from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine writing; and 
not ‘to walk about in the house in my.outdoor 
dress, nor to do other things of the kind; and 
to write my letters with simplicity, like the letter 
which Rusticus wrote from Sinuessa to my moth- 
er; and with respect to those who bave offended 
me by words, or done me wrong, to be easily 
disposed to be pacified and reconciled, as. soon 
as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled; 
and to read carefully, and not to be satisfied 
with a superficial understanding of a book; not 
_ hastily to give my assent to those who talk over- 
much} and I am indebted to him for being ac- 
quainted with the discourses of Epictetus. 
8. From Apollonius * I learned freedom of will 
and undeviating steadiness of purpose; and to 
Jook to nothing’ else, not even for a moment, ex- 
cept to reason; and to be always the same, in 
sharp pains, on the occasion. of the loss of a 
child, and in long illness; and to see clearly in 
a living example that the same man can be both 
most resolute and yielding, and not -peevish in 
giving his instruction; and to have had before 
my eyes a man who clearly considered his ex- 
perience and his skill in expounding philosophical 
- principles as: the smallest of his merits; and from 
him I learned how to receive from friends what 
are esteemed favors, without being either hum- 
bled by them or letting them pass unnoticed.

manner, and the idea of living coifformably to 
nature; end gravity without affectation, and to 
look carefully after the interests of friends, and 
to tolerate ignorant persons and those who form 
opinions without consideration: he had the:power 
of readily accommodating himself to all, so that 
intercourse with him was more agreeable. than 
any flattery; and at the same time he was most 
highly venerated by those who associated with 
him; and he had the faculty both of discovering 
and ordering, in an intelligent methodical way, 
the principles necessary for life; and he never 
showed anger or any other passion, but was en- 
tirely free from passion, and also most aftec- 
tionate; and he could express approbation with- 
out noisy display, and he possessed much knowl- 
edge without ostentation. 
10. From Alexander” the gramuiarian, to re- 
frain from fault-finding, and not in a reproach- 
ful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous 
or solecistie or strange-sounding expression; but 
dexterously to introduce the very expression 
which ought to have been used, and in the way 
of answer or giving confirmation, or joining in 
an inguiry about the thing itself, not about the 
word, or by some other fit suggestion. = 9°

envy, and duplicity, and hypocrisy are in a 
tyrant, and that generally those among us who 
are called Patricians are rather deficient in pater- 
nal affection. m

  12. From Alexander the Platonie, not frequent- 
ly nor without necessity to say to any one, or to 
write in a letter, that I have no leisure; nor con- 
tinually to excuse the neglect of duties required 
by our relation to those with whom we live, by 
alleging urgent oveupations. 
13. From Catulus,* not to be indifferent when 
a friend finds fault, even if he should find. fault 
without reason, but to try to restore him to his 
usual disposition; and to be ready to speak well 
of teachers, ag it is reported of Domitius and 
Athenodotus; and to love my children truly. 
14, From my brother Severus, to love my kin, 
and to love truth, and to love justice; and 
through him I learned to know Thrasea, Helvi- 
dius, Cato, Dion, Brutus; and from him. I re- 
eeived the idea of a polity in which there is 
the same law for all, a polity administered with 
regard to equal rights and equal freedom of 
speech, and the idea of a kingly government 
which respects most of all the freedom of the 
governed; I learned from him also consistency 
and undeviating steadiness jn my regard for 
philosophy; and a disposition to do good, and to 
~ give to others readily, and to cherish good hopes, 
and to believe that I am loved by my friends; 
and in him I observed no concealment of his 
opinions with respect to those whom he con- 
demned, and that his friends had no need to 
conjecture what he wished or did not wish, but 
it was quite plain. 
15. From Maximus” I learned self-government, 
Cinna Catulus, a Stoic. 
“Claudius Maximus, 8 Stoic, whom the author's pre- 
‘decessor, Antoninus Pius, also valued highly.

  and not to be led aside by anything; and cheer- 
fulness in all circumstances as well ‘as in illness 5 
and a just admixture in the moral character of 
sweetness and dignity, and to do what: was set 
before me without complaining. I observed that 
everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, 
and that in all that he did he never had any 
bad intention; and he never showed amazement 
‘and surprize, and was never in a hurry, and- 
never put off doing a thing, nor was perplexed 
nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise 
his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever 
passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to 
do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, 
and was free from all falsehood; and he’ pre- 
sented the appearance of a man who could not 
be diverted from right rather than of a man 
who had been improved. I observed, too that 
no man could ever think that he was despised. by 
Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a 
better man. He had also the art of being hu- 
Mmorous in an agreeable way. 
16. In my father‘ I observed mildness of tem- 
per, and unchangeable resolution in the things 
which he had determined after due deliberation; 
and no vainglory in those things which men call 
honors; and a love of labor and perseverance; 
and a readiness to listen to those who had any- 
thing to propose for the common weal; and un-' 
deviating firmness in giving to every man. ac- 
cording to his deserts; and a knowledge derived 
from experience of the occasions for vigorous 
action and for remission. And I observed that

he. had overcome all passion: for boys; and he 
considered himself no more than anyother citi- 
zeu; aud he released his friends from all obliga- 
tion to sup with him or to attend him’ of neces- 
‘sity when he went. abroad, and those who had 
failed to accompany him, by reason of any urgent 
circumstances, always found him the same, ¥ 
observed too his habit of careful inquiry in all 
matters of deliberation, and his persistency, and 
that he never stopt his investigation through 
being satisfied with appearances which first pre- 
sent themselves; and that his disposition was to 
keep his friends, and not.to be soon tired of 
them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; 
and to be satisfied on all occasions, and cheer- 
ful; and to foresee things a long way off, and 
to provide for. the smallest without display; and 
to cheek immediately popular applause and all 
flattery; and to be ever watchful over the things 
which were necessary for the administration of 
the empire, and to be a good manager of the ex- 
penditure, and patiently. to endure the blame 
which he got for such conduet; and he was nei- 
ther superstitious with respect to the gods, nor 
did he court men by gifts or by trying to please 
them, or by flattering the populace; but he 
showed sobriety. in all things and firmness, and 
never any mean thoughts or action, nor love of 
novelty. 2. < :

grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good 
teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and

it to the gods that I was not hurried into any offense against any of them, tho I had a dis-

  position which, if opportunity bad offered, might 
have led me to do something of this kind; but, 
through their favor, there never was such a con- 
currence of circumstances as put me to the. trial. 
Further, I am thankful to the gods that. I was 
not longer brought up with my grandfather’s 
eoneubine, and that I preserved the flower of 
my youth, and that I did not make proof of 
my virility before the proper seaso, but even 
deferred the time; that I was subjected to a 
ruler and a father who was able to take away 
all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowl- 
edge that it is possible for a man to live in a 
palace without wanting either guards or em- 
broidered dresses, or torches and statues, and 
such-like show; but that it is in such a man’s 
power to bring himself very near to the fashion 
of a private person, without being for this reason 
either meaner in thought, or more remiss in ac- 
tion, with respect to the things which must be 
done for the public interest in a manner that 
befits a ruler. I thank the gods for giving me 
such a brother? who was able by his moral 
character to rouse me to vigilance over myself, 
and who, at the same time, pleased me by his 
respect and affection; that. my children have not 
been stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not 
make more proficiency in rhetoric, poetry, and 
the other studies, in which I should perhaps hava 
been completely engaged, if I had seen that I 
was making progress in them; that I made haste 
to place those who brought me up in the station . 
of honor, which they seemed to desire, without .

    putting them off with hope of -my doing it some 
time after, because they were then still young; 
that I knew Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus; that 
I received clear and frequent impressions about 
living according to nature, and what kind of a 
life that is, so that, so far as depended on the 
gods, and their gifts, and help, and inspirations, 
nothing hindered me from forthwith living ac- 
cording to nature, tho I still fall short of it 
through my own fault, and through not observing 
_ the admonitions of the gods, and I may almost 
say, their direct instructions; that my body has 
held out so long in such a kind of life; that I 
never touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and 
that, after having fallen into amatory passions, 
I was cured; and, tho I was often out of humor 
with Rusticus, I never did anything of which I 
had -oceasion to repent; that, tho it was my 
mother’s fate to die young, she spent the last 
years of her life with me; that, whenever I 
wished to help any man in his need, or on any 
other occasion, I was never told that I had not 
the means of doing it; and that to myself the 
same necessity never happened, to receive any- 
thing from another; that I have such a wife, so 
obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple; that 
I: had abundance of good masters for my chil- 
dren; and that remedies have been shown to me

and giddiness; and that, when J had an inclina- 
tion to philosophy, I did not fall into the hands 
of any sophist. : :

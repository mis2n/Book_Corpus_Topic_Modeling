PREFACE 
In the two preceding books of A Study Course in Music 
Understanding the student has first been enlightened regard- 
ing the basic elements of music, for without a knowledge of 
these fundamentals his after study would be hampered and 
hazy; and, in the second book, he has been led step by step 
in a graphic survey from the most primitive types of mu- 
sical art to the more complex modern forms. 
In this, the third book, the author’s pleasant task has 
been to describe the various instruments through which mu- 
sic has found its ever growing richness of expression, and to 
sketch the gradual development of these instruments from 
the primitive tom-tom to the splendor of the modern organ 
and the many-voiced symphonic orchestra. 
The author is happy indeed to contribute a volume to 
this Study Course, the first planned series of correlated text- 
books on the understanding of the subtlest of all the arts— 
Music, and. as a tribute to the woman into whose mind first 
flashed the idea of such a series of books he has gladly ded- 
icated this work. He wishes, furthermore to express his 
appreciation of the helpful collaboration of the Editor of 
this Course of Study.

INTRODUCTION 
“Look how the floor of heaven 
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold. 
There’s not the smallest orb which thou beholdst 
But in his motion like an angel sings, 
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins. 
Such harmony is in immortal souls; 
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay 
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.” 
Shakespeare | 
When the layman, assisted by a modern telescope, con- 
  templates the almost inconceivably vast flames radiating 
from the sun, or obtains a view of the whirling rings of 
Saturn, he is not only awed by the spectacle, but apprehends 
the existence of celestial vibrations of incalculable mag- 
nitude and intensity. 
During the past century, scientists have come to the con- 
clusion that the elements found upon our planet exist in all 
the heavenly bodies, and believe that this Unity of the Uni- 
verse is further emphasized by the manifestations of the 
laws of gravity, heat, light, etc. in the various members of 
our solar system. If this unity be granted, it seems as 
though we might safely assume that the laws of acoustics 
that obtain upon our globe hold good in other worlds than 
ours and that sound is as eternal as vibrant matter. 
This view seems to have been entertained by the ancient 
Hindus, who believed that before the creation of the world, 
an all-pervading sound ‘Om’ rang through space. Again 
in the Book of Job, we read that “the Morning Stars sang 
together,” while the Greek philosophers cherished a theory 
1
-P-A-G-E-12
  2 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
that the tones engendered by the revolutions of the various 
planets, resulted in the Music of the Spheres.* 
Tue BeEcINNINGS OF TERRESTRIAL Music 
From the earliest emotional consciousness of primitive 
man, there was doubtless (as is the case with birds and ani- 
mals), some sort of vocal expression. As the range of 
emotions increased, there would arise a corresponding need 
for a wider range of expression, probably shown in greater 
vocal flexibility and compass. 
In order to further extend his powers of expression, man 
was led to the invention of apparatus producing noise, and 
later to such devices as created definite tones. When, sub- 
sequently, he had succeeded in fashioning instruments yield- 
ing a series of tones similar in quality but varying in pitch, 
he found himself in the domain of art. 
Mystic Oricin or Musica INstRUMENTS 
So unusual was the music evolved from these instruments 
and so far did it exceed all known sounds in nature in its 
power to awaken the subtler emotions of man, that a reason 
for its strange influence was sought. 
When certain phenomena are ascribed to inadequate or 
unrelated causes, we have what is termed superstition. 
But when superstition is idealized or expressed in terms 
of poetry, we have what is known as myth. No wonder 
therefore that various peoples, on emerging from primitive 
conditions, forgetting the slow and painful evolution of 
their tone-producing devices, should believe them to be of 
supernatural origin. Indeed an interesting treatise might 
*The recent marvellous achievements in the realm of radio suggest 
the possibility that in course of time, man may devise some means 
of gathering certain vibrations of these heavenly bodies, rendering 
them audible to earth’s inhabitants despite their “muddy vestures of 
decay.” (See an article entitled “Listening to the Stars” in the 
Scientific American for November, 1924.)

/ INTRODUCTION 3 
be written on the Mythology of Music. Thus in India, 
their most ancient stringed instrument, the Vina,” is regarded 
as the gift of the Goddess Siva. The Chinese are in like 
manner indebted to the phoenix-like bird Foung-hoang for 
| their five-tone scale, while the tones of the King} so ravished 
| the ears of Confucius that for three weeks he lay in a trance. 
In Greece the precocious Hermes, when only a few hours 
old, formed a Lyre from the back of a turtle and three 
sinews, and presented it to Apollo, to appease the wrath of 
the Sun-God, whose oxen he had stolen. The nymph, Syrinx, 
on being chased by the God, Pan, escaped only by being 
transformed into a group of reeds. Pan seized her in that 
form and showed his lasting devotion to her by breathing 
beautiful airs upon the instrument that bears her name, 
Syrinx, although perhaps more often termed Pandian Pipes. 
The power of instrumental music is nowhere more intensely 
suggested than in the story of Orpheus, who, with the Lyre 
presented by Apollo, moved not only beasts, but the trees, 
rocks and the inhabitants of Hades. 
In the New World, similar conceptions of the divine 
source and character of musical instruments are in evi- 
dence. Robotham says that a century ago, the Drum was 
the only object of worship from the Orinoco to La Plata, 
while Alexander von Humboldt tells of certain tribes near 
the Orinoco, who have no idols but the Botuto, the Sacred 
Trumpet. In North America, the religious character of 
certain musical functions, is familiar, the Zufis, in fact, pos- 
sessing a special god of music, Paryatamu. 
ConTROL OF SONOROUS VIBRATIONS 
By means of instruments it became possible to produce 
sounds quite distinct from those abounding in Nature. In 
*See Page 73, 74. 
{See Page 21, 22. 
  ) 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
    4 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
/ the later development of such instruments, tones were gen- 
erated far beyond the range of the human voice. Thus 
“did man acquire the control of sonorous vibrations, In 
other words, the number and character of such vibrations 
as produce sound, were gradually so regulated by means 
of suitable instruments that they gave forth any given 
pitch, intensity or tone color (clang-tint or timbre).* The 
chapters that follow tell the story of this interesting develop- 
ment and mastery. 
~~TuHe Uttimate Import or Musicat INSTRUMENTS 
For a long period these inventions served merely to ac- 
company the voice. Even in choral works, the instruments 
doubled the various parts (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), 
simply reinforcing them and supplying interludes. But, 
at length, the psychic moment arrived when these accom- 
panying factors were able to perform independently. 
Then, and then only, was it possible for Music to rank with 
the sister arts—Poetry, Painting, Dancing, Sculpture and 
Architecture.} Obviously Music could only be termed 
“absolute” or “abstract” when it was sufficiently developed 
to exist entirely dissociated from the text employed in song 
and chorus, where the composer aims to intensify through 
the agency of tones the meaning of the words. 
Richard Wagner once said, “God denied the Germans the 
voices of the Italians, but granted the former the power of 
expression through the medium of instrumental music.” 
This beautiful aphorism indicates why the opera was born 
in Italy, while the symphony is a native of Germany. 
*See Gehrkens’ Fundamentals of Music, Chapter VII. 
{It would be more informing if, instead of the term “fine arts” we 
should substitute “the beautiful arts” after the manner of the French 
(les beaux arts) and the Germans (die schénen Kiinste.)

“A talent for Art is rare, but to nearly everyone is 
given the ability to appreciate the masterpieces.” 
—Plato. 
An EvoLuTIonaRy PARALLEL 
NTHROPOLOGISTS have called attention to 
the parallel existing between the development 
of the individual man and the evolution of the human 
race. Thus the infant affords a type of the prehis- 
toric ancestor moving about on all fours. The boy 
with his tendency to gratify every need and whim, 
even when it involves cruelty, resembles the savage 
state. The youth with his fondness for finery, may 
be compared to the barbarian, while the cultured 
man represents the people of high civilization. A 
corresponding analogy may be traced between the 
growth of musical taste in the individual and that of 
the species. 
OurTLInE oF INSTRUMENTAL EVOLUTION 
Accordingly, we note that the delight of the infant 
in sheer noise (produced by rattles, drums, etc.) cor- 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
responds to the taste of the savages, who first fashion 
instruments of just this type. As a boy rejoices in 
whistles, fifes, etc., which produce definite tones, so 
we find the barbarous tribes taking pleasure in the 
music afforded by instruments of similar nature— 
Pan-pipes (groups of whistles), rudimentary flutes, 
horns, etc. In the youth, as his discernment for 
pleasing succession of tones (melody)* is developed, 
he cultivates the Banjo, Guitar, Mandolin, Cornet, 
Flute, etc. In like manner, the semi-civilized peoples 
devote themselves to the tone-producing media of 
similar kinds—harps, lutes, dulcimers, horns and 
viols. Finally, on reaching maturity, the man appre- 
hends the finer qualities of musical art and learns to 
appreciate combinations of melodies or voice parts 
(counterpoint in its broader sense), combinations of 
tone-groups (harmonies and modulation) and com- 
binations of instruments (orchestration). Here the 
individual has reached the stage representing a 
people who employ instruments of the highest degree 
of perfection, capable of expressing the ideas of the 
great masters. 
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 
One of the features of modern biology most fascin- 
ating to the layman, is that relating to the influence 
of environment upon a given type of plant or ani-

mal.* Not only do our zoological and botanical 
gardens afford excellent illustrations of this law, but 
all nature abounds in interesting specimens. This 
same principle is seen to hold good in the realm of 
art. Hence the lover of architecture, as he inspects 
the Gothic structures in different regions, finds his 
enjoyment enhanced by noting the modifications of 
the forms of various edifices to suit the needs of the 
respective localities. It is also interesting to observe 
the employment of such building material as the sit- 
uation affords. Sometimes these variations are quite 
marked. Thus the cathedral at Milan is constructed 
of white marble, that at Cologne of gray granite, 
while those at Wells and Chester are built respectively 
of yellow and red sandstone. In like manner,/the 
student, in contemplating a collection of musical in- 
struments will experience an additional pleasure if 
he learn to appreciate the influence of the environ- 
ment upon all characteristic specimens. For ex- | 
ample, the department devoted to trumpets and horns 
will show that, in their efforts to create instruments 
with greater carrying qualities than the human voice 
for the purpose of signalling on the hunt or in battle, 
those peoples dwelling near the seacoast naturally 
*An experience of the author may possibly be worthy of mention. 
While travelling in England, he visited the ruins of King Edgar’s 
palace at Chester, and was permitted to gather as relics a few sun- 
flower seeds, sending some to friends in Wisconsin, others to Florida. 
The former grew to the usual size, while the latter, owing to some 
dwarfing influence of the soil, attained a height of only twelve 
inches, but matured and went to seed.

|enlisted the services of sea shells, while inland tribes 
were led to employ the horns of goats, rams, oxen, 
antelopes, etc. 
In such repositories, the variations of a given type, 
such as flute, trumpet, or viol, are as striking as the 
characteristic features of the different species of 
rose, orchid, pine or maple exhibited in our botanical 
| gardens.* 
SURVIVALS 
Scientific authorities show how Australia, in the 
far remote past, was connected with the mainland of 
Asia, and since the severance of this unique island 
from the continent, its flora and fauna have failed to 
keep pace with the evolution of kindred types in other 
parts of the globe. Hence the aborigines correspond 
to the Paleolithic man of Europe, while the duck-bill, 
kangaroo, snake-turtle, etc., found only in Australia, 
are survivals from former periods. 
Due to their isolation from the progressive western 
nations the peoples of the Orient have maintained 
their ancient culture in many respects in the same 
condition as it existed thousands of years ago. For 
this reason it has been considered advisable in out- 
lining the history of the development of musical in- 
*A careful inspection of such collections is earnestly recommended. 
The most notable collections in this country are the Crosby Brown

struments, to group the inventions of the Orientals 
with those of the more primitive peoples, the Asiatic 
survivals taking their place midway between those of 
man’s infancy and his mature methods of “controlling 
vibrations.” 
In surveying the vast field open to a writer on 
musical instruments, it is obvious that in order to 
bring it into line with the other volumes of this series, 
it will be necessary to exclude all discussions of tone- 
producing devices that are not of vital interest at the 
present day. The effort has been made to confine 
this treatise chiefly to such instruments as are em- 
ployed in our concert and operatic orchestras, in the 
church and home circle. The opening chapters deal 
with the primitive experiments while the subsequent 
sections treat of the highly developed modern instru- 
ments, which are but the realizations of the vague 
visions cherished by the primeval devotees of music. 
CuassiricaTion oF MusicaL INsTRUMENTS 
Following the probable order of their appearance 
in history, we may place all instruments—devices for 
throwing the air into vibration—under three general 
heads: 
A. Percussion instruments — including not 
only those that are struck (Lat. percus- ° 
sio), but also such as are rubbed or 
shaken to produce vibrations,
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
B. Wind instruments. 
C- Stringed instruments.* 
Obviously this grouping simply indicates in the 
broadest possible manner the general periods of 
musical culture, inasmuch as they overlap in differ- 
ent ways in different countries. Some writers be- 
lieve that stringed instruments were invented before 
the wind, but there seems to be no reasonable doubt 
concerning the precedence of the instruments of per- 
cussion. 
INSTRUMENTS OF PERCUSSION 
This class is divided into two distinct groups: 
a. Instruments with indefinite pitch 
b. Instruments with definite pitch 
Group a comprises by far the great majority of 
instruments used by savage and primitive peoples, 
for not only does the indefinite pitch most readily 
and completely satisfy the infantile appetite for 
noise, but the various species are relatively easy of 
construction. 
To attempt in a compact treatise like this, to give 
all the sub-divisions of each species, would but lead 
us through a labyrinth of weird-sounding names, 
showing a multitude of methods and materials em- 
ployed in the creation of devices, the ultimate object

of which has been to produce the same or kindred 
results. It will suffice to touch on the most significant 
representatives of the leading groups. 
INSTRUMENTS OF PERCUSSION WITH INDEFINITE

The most important under this heading are such 
specimens as are more or less related to the twelve 
_ types with which we ourselves are familiar: 
1. Rattles 6. Hand Drums 
2. Notched Sticks 7. Tambourines 
3. Crickets (Schnarren) 8. Bass drum 
4. Castagnets (Bones, 9. Gong (Tam-tam)

5. Drums beaten with 11. Turkish Crescent

1. The general structure of the Rattle requires no 
elaborate explanation, as it sifiply implies some form 
of receptacle in which certain hard substances are so 
placed that they can be shaken against the sides to 
produce noise. But a very long list of the varieties 
to be seen in our museums, afford us numerous strik- 
ing specimens. In Africa we find them made of 
gourds in which are placed pebbles or gravel, In 
Mexico they sometimes consist of a string of large 
amoth cocoons, containing bits of gravel, sometimes 
of pottery, red, gray, light brown, etc. A curious 
feature of these ancient Rattles and whistles of the 
Aztecs is that they often take the forms of the various 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
: 
12 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
deities of ancient Mexico, each householder being 
allowed a certain number of idols according to his 
rank. Certain lighter forms of Rattles were worn 
about the calves of the legs; others were arranged to 
be worn as anklets. In British Guiana, one form is 
made from a large bamboo tube in which are placed 
nut shells or fruit pits. The North American Indians 
in addition to the numerous devices mentioned above 
employ others of quite a different type, such as, 
wooden rods to which are attached bits of black horn, 
so that the rattling is produced on the outside instead 
of from within the instrument; a circular frame of 
wood with skin stretched over it; bracelet Rattles worn 
on the wrist; Rattles of deer’s toes, Rattles of rattle- 
snakes, etc.* 
2. The boy running along the sidewalk, holding 
a stick so that it shall strike successively all the 
pickets in the fence, has unconsciously hit upon the 
principle of the Notched Stick with Scraper, classed 
sometimes with the Rattles. During the past two 
thousand years or more, quite a variety of this kind 
of noise-maker has been produced in many countries. 
In ancient China a large Notched Stick in the form 
of a recumbent tiger with many saw-like teeth on its 
back, was employed in the Confucian ceremonies. 
*Wm. Strachey in his Historie of Travaile in the Virginia Brittania, 
(1610-1612), speaking of the music of the Indians of Virginia says: 
“Their chief instruments are rattles made of small gourdes or pom- 
pion shells, of these they have base, tenor, counter-tenor, meane and 
treble; these myngled with their voyces, sometymes twenty or thirty 
togither, make such a terrible howling as would affright rather than 
give pleasure to any man.”    
-P-A-G-E-23
  PRIMITIVE AND ORIENTAL 13 
INSTRUMENTS OF PERCUSSION 
Tt was called the Yu, and at certain points in the 
service, the tiger was struck three times on the head 
with a bamboo beater, which was then rapidly passed 
over the back. A similar instrument called the Gyo 
is used in Japan.* 
3. In order that man might revel in a continuous 
rattling, the principle of the Notched Stick was ap- 
plied to a wheel about which the stick could be re- 
volved ad libitum. This apparatus is what we call 
a Cricket (German Schnarre), which Sachs suggests 
may have originated in India where it has long 
existed as a toy. 
4, Another probable heritage from Asia is the 
pair of Castagnets which we instinctively associate 
with Spain. But when we recall the great influence 
of the Moors since the seventh century upon Spanish 
architecture, music and customs, it is easy to see that 
this popular instrument of the Moors early found a 
home in the Iberian Peninsulat where the art of 
performing with them reached such a high degree of 
perfection that instruction books have been published 
which reveal astonishing possibilities of the Castag- 
nets. It is usual to hold a pair in each hand, the 
larger (the male) in the left to give the heavy accents 
at the beginning of each measure; the smaller (the 
*Sachs even suggests an earlier introduction by the Phoenicians. 
+The name, Latin Castania, Spanish Castaneta, was suggested by 
their resemblance to a pair of chestnuts or to the material of which 
they are made.

female) in the right to execute the more rapid 
rhythm, as may be noted in the following Fandango 
or Malaguefia, given by Gevaert, who says that after 
the close there is a verse sung and with its last note 
the dance movement begins anew and this formula 
is repeated several times.

Many will recall the Intermezzo between Acts III and

5. An entire volume might be filled with repre- 
sentations of the multitude cf different specimens of 
Drums. Probably the first effort to produce noise 
by means of beating with a stick was upon another 
piece of wood, which is the case with the Chinese 
Sack-wo or wood-drum. The next step is the cover- 
ing of a gourd or tube of bamboo or other hollow 
resonator with skin of some sort, then we have the 
Ti boatt of the Chinese. This was a great advance in 
the art of drum making. Throughout the more cul- 
tured countries of Asia as well as among the savage — 
tribes of Africa, America and the Isles of the Pacific, —    Guitar

the Drum is employed as a powerful stimulant to the 
warrior in battle, and in many forms of religious ex- 
ercises where the object is to drive away the evil 
spirits; it is a feature not only in the dances and in- 
cantations of the priests and medicine man, but the 
smaller Hand Drums and Tambourines accompany 
the dances of houris and nautch girls—adding poig- 
nant rhythms to purely vocal numbers. The Saracens 
utilized the noise of their Drums to frighten the 
horses of the enemy. 
As a boy the author was deeply impressed by the 
singing of a long procession of Winnebago Indians 
as they entered his native town to take part in a 
Fourth of July celebration. The phrase was sung 
twice by the men, then twice by the squaws and 
children, then again by the men and so on, the drum

a skin covering a round hoop of wood, looking like 
a modern kettledrum without the kettle. 
But the monotonous tapping that blends well

i with these peaceful measures would in the course of 
/ time become tiresome to the crudest mentalities. As 
the Drum possesses only one available tone (or noise- 
quality) the only escape from this oppressive monot- 
ony is to vary the intervals between the strokes, thus 
producing rhythm. This is exactly what is done by 
these simple people, who sometimes develop their 
percussive art to such a fantastic extent that to the 
uninitiated it is as difficult to comprehend as is a 
fugue to many amateurs.

able address on “The Beginnings of Music.” Among 
the illustrations was a song by a native of West 
Africa, which he accompanied on a hand Drum. 
The cross rhythms and apparent total discrepancy be- 
tween the vocal and the instrumental parts were baf- 
fling indeed. Saint-Saéns in his Suite Algérienne 
has happily imitated this African rhythmic complex. 
(See No. 3). The student on playing it will find it

development he will observe the relationship of mo-

in our Tambourine, which by virtue of its jingles, 
combines the features of both Drum and Rattle. This 
type of instrument was known in ancient times and is

throughout the Orient but also in Europe during the 
Middle Ages accompanying songs and dances and 
were used in connection with the tricks of Mounte- 
banks and Jugglers.* They also amused the folk 
with all sorts of tricks with their Tambourines, throw- 
ing them up in the air and catching them again, as 
was the wont of the end men in our old time negro 
minstrels. In this connection, it might be mentioned 
that the fascinating rhythms of the Bones (clappers 
or castagnets) of the “other” end men, as well as of 
the double clog-dancers was closely akin to the 
achievements of the hand-drummers from West 
Africa above referred to. 
8. The Bass Drum (9). Gong (Tam Tam) and 
(10) Cymbals are all of them familiar instruments 
and are to be discussed under appropriate headings, 
but are mentioned here for the sake of completeness 
as they are all peculiarly Oriental instruments. The 
Bass or Great Drum we have borrowed from the 
Turks; the Gong from the Chinese; the Cymbals from 
the Turks again, although very remarkable ones 
*A feature of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show was a group of Arabian

jHerbert Spencer states that “our pleasure in a picnic consists in a 
temporary return to the savage stage.” He would doubtless have 
demonstrated that the fondness for what is termed “jazz” is but a 
casual reversion to musical savagery.

enough, Pavillon chinois) is a long staff, which pene-

INSTRUMENTS OF PERCUSSION WITH DEFINITE PircH 
Hector Berlioz in his epoch-making treatise on 
Orchestration, refers to the “occult harmonies’’ re- 
sulting from the simultaneous clicking of the muskets 
of an entire regiment when at drill. This idea seems 
fanciful to many, and yet it has a germ of scientific 
truth, for the pitch of the many muskets must vary in 
some minute degree. Akin to this is the perform- 
ance of the Sioux Indians with wooden tappers as 
described by Mr. Robert O. Sweeny who says, “I have 
heard the tappers on a large number of tomahawks 
make wonderful music. By moving the fingers along 
the under side of the blade of a tomahawk, the note 
is-changed.” The pleasure derived from “changing 
the note” indicates a desire to extend the tonal range 
even with this crude apparatus. * 
The moment we come to the inspection of instru- 
ments with definite pitch, we find evidence of a 
higher grade of intelligence than that required to 
*Noise, as the student will remember, is the result of irregular vibra- 
tions; sound is produced by regular vibrations. This fact should be 
borne in mind when listening to vocal as well as instrumental pro- 
ductions. It will be noticed that a well “placed” tone always carries 
better than one indifferently uttered, even when forcibly emitted. 
As the train from Indianapolis to Cincinnati arrives at Hamilton, a

produce those of the preceding class, for not only does 
the pleasure derived from a series of tones denote a 
finer esthetic sense, but a certain degree of mathe- 
matical intuition is implied. Gevaert, the distin- 
guished authority on the music of the ancients, says, 
“The perception of the relationship of a tone to its 
octave indicates the beginning of the art of music.” 
Probably one of the earliest attempts to co-ordinate 
a series of tones more or less related, was the Pien- 
King or Pien-ch’ing (stone chime) of the Chinese 
(4500 or 5000 years ago) which consisted of a series of 
sonorous stone plates (usually sixteen) suspended by 
tendons or strings from a couple of horizontal bars, 
the performer striking these plates with a hammer. 
The stone plates which gave the tones of the Chinese 
scale were afterwards superseded by plates of metal 
as shown in the illustration. These plates of metal in 
turn made way for a series of bells (without tongues) 
also struck with a hammer. ' 
certain official calls out with measured resonance:

BELLS 
In other countries of the Orient, a similar series 
of experiments preceded the casting of copper bronze 
and other metallic bells with tongues or clappers 
similar to those that have been in vogue throughout 
Europe for several centuries. Among the most re- 
markable proofs of ancient accomplishment in this 
field of activity is a finely modeled Assyrian bronze 
bell, which was made eight or more centuries before 
the Christian era. 
The universal employment of bells of all sizes in 
connection with religious services, from those small 
golden bells worn on the robe of Aaron to the heavy 
chimes of the great cathedrals, betokens their peculiar 
spiritual nature.

Prehistoric hexagonal bells have been excavated in 
Iceland, that curious repository of legendary lore and 
linguistic traditions. During the Middle Ages the 
bells were regarded almost as personalities and were 
believed to possess the power of averting calamities 
caused by the elements, and in a more practical way 
were rung to frighten away the Turks who regarded 
them as their most dangerous foes. Whoever ascends 
the tower of Notre Dame in Paris, or the spire of the 
Freiburg Minster and reads the inscriptions cast in 
the bells, many of them dedicated to individual pa- 
tron saints, cannot fail to appreciate the power they 
have long exerted over the imaginative masses. 
In China bells of enormous size hang in the‘towers 
and doubtless are still used to drive away demons. 
In Peking alone there are seven, each weighing 
120,000 pounds. But it is in Russia that the en- 
thusiasm for bell-building reached its greatest height. 
The most remarkable, of course, being the “great 
bell” which was cracked during a conflagration in the 
Kremlin, and was long used as a chapel—the interior 
being 22 feet in diameter and over 21 feet in height. 
Long before the discovery of America the Aztecs 
employed bells of pottery in their religious services. 
Those made of metal now found in Mexicg are of 
Spanish origin. 
Although these gigantic tone generators mentioned 
do not come under the heading of orchestral instru-

ments, their assistance is sometimes invoked by com- 
posers of the first rank, rarely however, with success. 
(The bells in Parsifal are still something of a prob- 
lem.) But the theme is a fascinating one, and a pro- 
gram might well be devoted to a rehearsal of the 
influence of bells on history, mythology, poetry and 
music, illustrated by excerpts from Schiller, Poe, 
Longfellow, Tennyson, Wagner, etc. 
Of smaller specimens, such as were used by the 
once celebrated Swiss Bell Ringers there are numer- 
ous instances of successful charming achievement. 
XYLOPHONE 
That it is possible to evoke definite tones from 
substances other than stone or metal, sometimes of 
true clarity, was demonstrated long since in regions 
widely remote. As the predominant material has 
been wood, they are classed under the general caption 
Xylophone (Greek Xylophonon), literally “wood 
sounder”—implying a row of parallel bars of wood, 
varying in length so as to produce a scale when played 
upon with small mallets. In the Crosby Brown col- 
lection at the Metropolitan Museum, New York, one 
sees a rich variety of types with the sounding bars not 
only of wood but of bones, turtle-shells and metal.

each slab is a tube of bamboo which serves as a reso- 
nator or tone amplifier, and this feature has been 
adopted by our most modern American Xylophone 
makers. : 
KetrLe Drums 
That Kettle Drums—something like those to be 
found in any orchestra—have long been used in 
Oriental countries is not strange, seeing that our 
American Indians and other primitive tribes possess 
drums somewhat similar. But the fact that the Ori- 
entals employ them in pairs, so that they are definitely

tuned to the tones of the tonic and dominant—that is 
something remarkable and worth remembering. It 
shows that whatever the scale, whether it contain five, 
seven, thirteen, seventeen, or twenty-two tones, there 
will be, as Helmholtz has shown us, two tones common 
to all—the tonic and the dominant “whose relationship 
is so strong that it makes itself felt in all known sys- 
tems of all peoples:”*. In the light of this statement 
it is significant that it does not hold true of the whole- 
tone or hexatonic scale where the fundamental chords 
of tonic and dominant are impossible.

the mouth of an empty bottle, throwing the air

principles that were employed by the 
ancient Greeks when they hollowed 
out a piece of reed and blew across

added other reeds of different ~

gether, produced the Syrinx or Pan- 
pipes.* A legend of the Chinese

of varying length; and the Chinese today use Pandean 
pipes of bamboo tubes. 
This precursor of the Organ is found today among 
the Peruvian Indians of the Andes, the Indians of 
Bolivia, and those of the New Hebrides who have 
Pan-pipes of from eight to sixteen tubes of bamboo 
bound together with strips of cane; while the natives 
of the Solomon Islands bind together forty to fifty 
tubes of bamboo graduated in length from one and 
one-half inches to two feet four inches. 
The Egyptians and Arabs simplified matters by 
taking a single reed pipe and perforating it at the 
proper distances, rendered it capable of giving a 
series of tones corresponding to an equal number of 
separate pipes. In other words, with all the holes 
closed by the fingers of the player, the tone produced 
would be the same as though the pipe were the longest 
of a group. Then beginning with the lowest hole and 
raising successively one finger after another, thus 
virtually shortening by degrees the length of the pipe, 
a constantly ascending series of tones is obtained.

WHISTLES AND FLUTES 
The art of producing tones by blowing into a 
hollow piece of wood, reed or bamboo after the man- 
ner of the boy with his willow whistle was cultivated 
by Paleolithic man, who made his instruments of 
bone. Specimens of bone whistles of that order are 
to be seen in our museums from various districts of 
North and ‘South America from Oceanica, as well as 
from the old world. In fashioning these crude in- 
struments the bones of man as well as of birds and 
beasts have been utilized, and in order to extend the 
compass, holes have been provided.

with great reverence, employing them in, their relig- 
ious ceremonies. Prescott relates how the victim

respect and was attended by 
a train’of royal pages. As 
he halted in the streets to 
play some favorite melody, 
the: crowd did him homage

their good deity. When the 
hour arrived in which he 
was to be sacrificed, he ob- 
served the established sym-

he ascended the temple.

Flute type with a simple aperture; B, those with 
either a single or double reed, as the Clarinet and 
Oboe; C, those of the Horn and Trumpet type with 
a cup mouthpiece; D, those of the Organ type, blown 
by mechanism except in their primitive form. 
INSTRUMENTS WITH REEDS 
Whoever has amused himself by taking a leaf or 
blade of grass between the thumb knuckles of. both 
hands and, blowing forcibly, produced a squawk if 
not a tone, will have applied the principle of the 
reed, and his improvised noise-maker will be related 
to the Oboe, Clarinet and Bassoon.* Instruments of 
this type, being more complex than anything hitherto 
mentioned, we can only expect to meet them among 
peoples of a higher degree of culture. We accord- 
ingly encounter few specimens among the aboriginal 
Americans, excepting in the tribes of the Northwest 
Coast where, according to Mr. F. W. Galpin, there 
are Indians of a superior order of intelligence. In 
the absence of true reeds, they have ingeniously intro- 
duced two vibrating tongues of wood. 
*Possibly the reader may have heard in the general tuning of the 
orchestra before a concert an odd little “squeek-eek-eek.” That was 
the oboist preparing his reed. 
tIn the meantime let us not forget that the familiar expression “reed 
instruments,” means literally what we say, for the true instruments 
of that class have always been provided with carefully polished bits 
of reeds that grow in Southern Europe, the best coming from the 
Mediterranean shores.

One of the chief charms of old San Francisco was 
its Oriental character, and among my earliest im- 
pressions were the weird strains of music to be heard 
in Chinatown. One day I entered a very picturesque 
and impressive temple, where as part of the service 
a Chinaman stood before the altar blowing an instru- 
ment that appeared like a Trumpet and was not lack- 
ing in brazen blare, but the motive, which I afterward 
incorporated in my Aladdin Suite, was not of a trum- 
pet-like character.

This phrase no natural Trumpet could play, while 
the tone quality was more like that of an Oboe. On 
inquiry I was told it was the Dee Dah, the Chinese 
type of Oboe. It has reeds, but is made with a brass 
bell, which accounts for its harshness. 
Sometime later, while living in New York, making 
preliminary Oriental studies for the music to Ben 
Hur, I visited the Arabian musicians who played in 
the Midway Pleasance at Brighton Beach. Aside 
from the cross rhythms of their Drums (as already 
noted in No. 3) I was interested in their peculiar 
melodic progressions and especially attracted to the 
performer on the Zamir, an Oboe-like instrument 
with a less violent tone than the Chinese Dee Dah.
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
While watching the Zamir player, I was forcibly 
reminded of the fact that the ancient Greeks per- 
mitted none but slaves to play wind instruments on 
account of the facial contortions of the performers. 
The reason for this was, that the Aulos, a Greek in- 
strument of the reed family, demanded such pressure 
of air through a small aperture, that the cheeks were 
unduly swollen and performers were obliged to wear 
bandages to preserve them from injury.* I observed 
that the Arab had the remarkable faculty of making 
an air chamber of his cheeks, pressing the wind 
through the instrument by controlling his facial 
muscles, in the meanwhile breathing through his nose, 
so that he was thus enabled to execute long passages 
without interruption or breaking a phrase. 
THE SHAWM AND Its RELATIVES 
In the absence of definite data concerning early 
European music and knowing as we do how greatly 
indebted we are to the peoples of the East, it is not 
strange that many authorities are inclined to attribute 
pretty much everything of value to the Orient, Greece 
and Rome. But, deep as are our obligations to those 
seee illustration showing cheek-band on the Cypriote Flute player, 
p. 32. : 
7A friend once heard Tristan and Isolde in Manchester, England, 
and was astonished to hear the long sad melody of the shepherd boy 
(English Horn) in Act III, ten measures or more, played in a single 
phrase. On inquiring of the conductor, Mr. Hans Richter, he learned 
that the performer had once been a glass blower and, like the Arab, 
had learned to breathe as he blew.

countries, this does not imply that our Northern ances- 
tors contributed nothing to the world’s orchestra. 
We'have already seen (p. 31) that the inhabitants 
of regions as widely remote as Bolivia and the Islands 
of Oceanica had hit upon the principle of the Pan- 
pipes with no knowledge whatever of its Greek or 
Chinese prototypes. These and kindred specimens 
from different countries decorate the walls of our 
museums, showing that, given the desire to express 
certain feelings through the medium of music, man 
will invent the necessary apparatus, using the mater- 
ial nearest at hand. 
The word Shawm is familiar to most of us as an 
instrument mentioned in the King James translation 
of the Psalms of David, and in medieval Europe was 
used to denote the predeces- 
sor of the Oboe, (Fr. Chalu- 
meau — Ger. Schalmei). 
Its essential characteristics 
may be seen in the latter 
instrument, where the sound 
is generated by setting in vi- 
  SHAWM—lth Cent. bration the two flat pieces of 
thin cane or reed by the breath of the player. The 
chief difficulty in performing on these double reed 
instruments consists in the great pressure of air that 
must be forced through a small aperture. Unless 
   
-P-A-G-E-50

the player possess a strong physique, this strain may 
prove injurious. 
The reader who may have listened to music from 
any Asiatic or African source will doubtless have 
noticed, first, that it was melodic, had no sort of 
harmony, and second, that there were no adequate 
bass tones even were the performers inclined thus to 
accompany their melodies. 
At this point it will be well to call attention to our 
indebtedness to the Medieval Europeans. While the 
ia Shawm was in use in the

tenth century, and even 
earlier, it was not until 
the fourteenth century 
that it had taken a defi- 
nite place in the wind- 
bands of that period. It 
was then that an effort 
was made to extend the 
scale of the instrument 
and makers began to      furnish them in groups 
so that they could per- 
form music in four-part 
harmony. The lowest 
*\ one, the bass, called 
treble, Tenor and bas (Bonberd) Bombard (German 
Pommer or Bombort) is mentioned as early as 1393 
by the poet Gower.   
 
-P-A-G-E-51

WIND INSTRUMENTS 
There was also a double-bass Shawm or Bombard 
that gave the tones an octave below great F. 
This taste for harmony shows the influence of the 
church with its choir and organ and the continually 
growing richness of the service. 
We are all familiar with the term Double-Bass in 
our orchestras, the lowest of the string group which 
does indeed often double ‘the bass of ’Cello, etc., in 
the lower octave, but the real meaning of the expres- 
sion as applied to instruments of the Shawm, Re- 
corder, Viol, Trombone and Tuba groups consists in 
the fact that its compass lies largely in that register 
designated by double capitals, CC, DD, EE or C’, D’, 
F’, etc.* 
Tue RECORDER 
The Recorders or Fipple-flutes formed a pleasing 
contrast to the sharp-toned Shawms and for that 
reason were also called the Flutes douces, forming 
as a group the dulcet woodwind in contrast to the reed 
group of Shawms and Bombards. Whereas the 
Shawm was an instrument resembling the kindred 
Oboe by whom it was later superseded, the Recorder 
was a kind of Whistle-flute (see p. 33) to which was 
added a fipple or crooked mouthpiece like that of a 
Bassoon, but the tone-color was flute-like. Although 
much in vogue throughout Western Europe, it en-

joyed its greatest popularity in England where we 
find it mentioned by Chaucer (1384), Shakespeare 
(Hamlet), Bacon, Evelyn, and Pepys, the last named 
being an enthusiastic performer on the instrument. 
Like the Shawms, the Recorders were made in vari- 
  
  ous sizes for the similar purpose of playing music in 
several parts. (See cut).

tone. Indeed the ideal Bass-Flute for which com- 
posers have long sighed in vain, is yet to be invented, 
and when it appears it will doubtless be blown by 
machinery.* The specimens shown in museums and 
those prepared for recent orchestral experiments 
seem to have led to no practical results. 
MEDIEVAL ORCHESTRATION 
In Wagner’s score of Lohengrin (1848) we see for 
the first time in history a grouping of three Flutes, 
three Oboes, three Clarinets and three Bassoons (the 
third Oboe playing also the English Horn and the 
third Clarinet the Bass Clarinet). There are also three 
Trumpets. The object of employing groups of three 
instead of two of a kind, as was the custom of the 
classical masters, was to make it possible to play a 
complete chord (triad) in a given tone-color. Like 
all the wonderful innovations of Wagner, this ex- 
travagance was greeted with derision by his enemies. 
But, had they stopped to think, they would have real- 
ized that this novelty was a revival of the medieval 
precedent of presenting a theme or melody by a uni- 
form group of instruments. In the sixteenth century 
. great pains were taken to preserve each section by 
itself. A large orchestra of 1561 was divided into 
five groups—first, Violins; second, Cornets; third, 
Flutes; fourth, Hautboys; fifth, Drums and Fifes; 
*See Chapter VII, p. 169.

each section performing separately. Indeed a marked 
effort was made to have the tone-color fit the scene. 
Thus songs were accompanied by Lutes, Viols and 
Virginals and other stringed instruments. The vari- 
ous wind groups were used in appropriate scenes. 
But Wagner did not remain in one color during an 
entire scene. On the contrary, when the situation 
demanded it, the transitions were quick and numer- 
ous, as were his modulations which he justified by the 
necessity of expressing the sudden change of mood of 
the different characters. 
The medieval musicians were very cautious in 
making changes in their methods. Each group (Re- 
corders, Shawms, Viols, etc.) was called a Consort 
and when one or more instruments of one grou 
played with another Consort, the result was anid 
broken music, an ‘expression frequently used by 
Shakespeare and others of that day. 
Horns AND TRUMPETS 
So accustomed are we to employ a certain word to 
designate a given object that we rarely stop to think 
whether or not the term is correct or whence it origi- 
nated. Thus in speaking of the Horns in an orches- 
tra, so filled are our minds with the countless, 
beautiful, stirring and again terrific themes, to ee 
these modern instruments give utterance, that few o 
us are mindful of the fact that the ancestral type was 
the horn of some animal—ox, ram, antelope, or ele-

phant—cut in such manner at the small end that the 
air could be thrown into vibration. We accordingly 
find in our museums, specimens showing an infinite 
variety of shapes, sizes and materials, indicating, as 
in the case of the Rattles, Drums, etc., their Asiatic, 
African, American or European origin. Indeed the 
eminent authority, Professor Sachs,* expresses the 
conviction that the Luren or Horns from the Bronze 
Age, unearthed in the Baltic region, were modeled 
after the tusks of the Mammoth. When that creature 
became extinct, the instruments were necessarily 
fashioned from metal as a substitute.

indeed we hear them still so employed by the care- 
less or the-uninformed:—Roman writers relate that 
__-the ancient Britons employed Horns and Trumpets to 
| frighten their enemies and succeeded in terrifying 
even thé Roman legionaries. We read that the War 
ae Horns of the ancient Scots were in size about a man’s 
height and could sound an alarm audible six miles 
distant. This statement would seem incredible did 
we not find in Wallaschek’s Primitive Music that “the 
Maoris with their seven-foot tubes blow with such 
vigor as to be heard several English miles away.” 
Like those politicians and debaters whose system of 
logic consists in talking louder than their opponents, 
so too did the medieval warriors seek to outdo the 
enemy in respect to noise. It is not strange therefore 
to find that the simple Steer-horns of the Crusaders 
cut a poor figure in the Holy Wars and were out- 
classed by the brazen Trumpets of the Saracens. 
Hence the introduction of instruments of this type in 
Western Europe. 
( There is ever something awe-inspiring in the voice 
of the Trumpet. Sublime indeed is the description 
of the trumpet-sounding of the seven angels in the 
/ Book of Revelations, and hardly less inspiring is the 
~ Koranic account of the Day of Judgment, when the 
\ archangels Gabriel and Israfel are to awaken with 
‘their trumpet-calls the souls of the departed from their

as well as secular history and yet nowhere from 
Genesis to the Apocalypse nor in other ancient writ- 
ings is there a hint of its use in connection with the 
art of music. This musically isolated position of 
these noble instruments was maintained long after the 
Christian era. Roland, surrounded by the Paynim 
hosts at Roncevalles, seized his horn and blew that 
long, despairing blast that has resounded through the 
ages. The elf-king Oberon wrought wonders with 
his magic horn at the court of Charlemagne and yet 
in spite of such achievements, no trumpeter or horn- 
player of that age was ever known to take part ir 
concerted music. There were several reasons for 
this. To begin with, the use of these instruments was 
regarded as the prerogative of royalty and the nobil- 
ity. In the next place, the tones produced were too 
loud and harsh to blend with lyric instruments like 
the Lute, Rebec, Viol, etc. Then again, the paucity 
of tone material at their command rendered them 
hardly desirable comrades in a band or orchestra. 
By looking at the harmonic series or nature scale, we 
shall get a better idea of this condition. (See No. 8).

It has been demonstrated in discussing the Wood- 
wind how, by means of what is termed “overblowing” 
tones higher than the fundamental (or tone 1 of the 
Natural Scale) may be produced. In performing 
upon the primitive brass instruments, this system of 
overblowing is of great importance for there are no 
keys that enable one to vary the pitch, and while the 
extreme low and high tones are seldom available, the 
tones 3 to 10 are usually to be relied upon. It should 
be remarked that long tubes or horns are obviously 
better adapted to generating the lower tones while 
shorter ones favor the production of the higher. 
Therefore, short instruments like the Bugle and 
Trumpet feel more at ease in the upper registers 
and utter quite glibly motives or calls like the fol- 
lowing :*

doubtless occurred to the Trumpet and Horn players 
fairly early in the Middle Ages. As the instruments 
became more perfect, the series of available tones 
was naturally increased. A glance at the table given 
in No. 8B will show that two chords could be pro- 
duced by these brass instruments and these chords 
are the most vital in all music—the tonic and domi- 
nant. 
Attention should be called to the fact that those 
tones indicated by black notes do not correspond with 
the tempered scales which we employ, and would 
consequently sound out of tune when played in unison 
with Oboes, Shawms or Trombones. Hence, when 
the time arrived for the experiment of combining two 
or more Horns in harmony it was found that only 
such passages as the following were possible: 
Now

At the present day when we are so accustomed to 
harmonic richness, these passages do not seem es- 
pecially attractive, but in spite of this, they represent 
the foundations of our art of music and themes of 
this sort were the stock in trade of early and late 
medieval composers. 
As was the case with percussion instruments, va- 
riety was obtained by Trumpets and Horns through

   As neither Trumpet nor Horn was capable of 
rendering a major or minor scale, they could not play 
duets with Viols or Flutes involving passages in thirds 
or sixths even if they could have modified their tone 
to make them blend well. 
Their natural range, however, was utilized to such 
good purpose that quite a code of signals was estab- 
lished. Even at the present day the military still 
employ a large number of calls, several of them 
being quite familiar, as shown in Professor Gehrkens’ the employment of notes of different lengths, so that

chapter already mentioned. Louis XIII of France, 
like many of his rank, was fond of hunting and in- 
vented a call to denote the fox, while Louis XV com- 
posed a number of calls designating different phases 
of the hunt that are still in use. 
In this manner, as more and more attention was 
paid to the hunting or forest horn (French cor de 
chasse, German Waldhorn), its melodic possibilities 
were cultivated and its size and shape modified until 
it became much the sort of an instrument we now see
-P-A-G-E-61

WIND INSTRUMENTS 
in our orchestras. The short horns of animals hav- 
ing been replaced by those of metal, it was easy to 
lengthen them to produce more tone. Then becoming 
too heavy, they were curved once or twice for con- 
venience in carrying on horseback. 
There are types of brass instruments whose tonal 
range is even more limited. This is especially true 
of the Russian Horn, which can yield but two tones— 
the fundamental and its octave, so that in order to 
play a scale in C-major, for instance, eight men are 
required, one for each note. Mr. John Parrott, who 
for many years made possible the San Francisco sym- 
phony concerts, himself a thorough music student, 
once told me that to him the most remarkable feature 
of the Paris Exhibition of 1889 was a performance of 
the William Tell overture by the band of Russian 
Horns. The terrible difficulty of this feat may be 
realized if two students will try to produce a trill on 
the Piano, one playing the lower, the other taking the 
upper note. Then compare that achievement with 
the passage referred to. (No. 13.)

When one thinks of two pairs of alternate men ex- 
ecuting trills in double sixths, and that thirteen men 
- are required to produce a chromatic scale, it is ob- 
vious that the executants must be very musical and 
the drillmaster a type of that despotism long domi- 
nant in Russia. 
SACKBUTS AND TROMBONES 
Here again is an instrument which like the Shawm 
is rarely mentioned except in the Old Testament and 
like many words of vague or inaccessible meaning 
the translators of the King James version employed 
the word Sackbut as the nearest approach to the 
Hebrew. 
As remarked in a preceding paragraph, the art of 
music, while under obligations to the Orient for the 
types of the majority of instruments which were later 
so wonderfully developed, is indebted to European 
builders for the development of a homogeneous bass 
in the various groups or consorts. As in the case of 
the Shawms and Recorders, the players of brass in- 
struments succeeded in extending the range of their 
groups by means of a large Trumpet, called by the 
Italians Trombone (the augmentation of Tromba or 
Tromp) which was supplied with a slide enabling the 
E player to vary the pitch at will, as he shortened or 
lengthened the tube.* The Spanish, noticing this 
*This method of tone production is bewildering to the uninformed. 
An Oriental guest at the Paris opera gazing long at the trombonists, 
remarked that he “was amazed to see a Christian swallow so, much 
brass.”

WIND INSTRUMENTS 
peculiar motion, called the instrument a Sacabuch (a 
kind of pump), modified in England to Sackbut. 
But in spite of this homely name, which appeared 
as early as the fourteenth century, it was greatly 
valued because of its perfect simplicity combined 
with the capacity of producing two and a half octaves 
of chromatic scale, every tone of which was of excel- 
lent quality. In fact, the Trombone (the name by 
which it was known in England from 1783 on) had 
the peculiar advantage of furnishing a range more 
comprehensive than any of the high-pitch brass, 
which instruments for another fifty years were meagre 
in tone variety and clumsy to manipulate. The Trum- 
pets.and Horns preserved their medieval qualities 
until 1831. 
The efforts to extend the bass of the brass had been 
crowned with such success that it surpassed in variety 
and richness the brass in the upper registers, as above 
noted. To balance this, experiments were made with 
the latter. High Trombones were tried, but their 
tone was not so satisfactory, so they were by degrees 
abandoned, although in England a Slide-trumpet was 
long popular. 
THE ZINCKE AND SERPENT 
Among the trials to obtain a soprano with a com- 
plete scale to balance the Trombones, the Zincke or 
Cornetto was produced and much used in the wind  
-P-A-G-E-64
    54 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
bands of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It 
was made of wood, covered with leather. The tone 
was produced with a cup mouthpiece like that of a 
Trumpet and was provided with holes enabling it to 
produce a chromatic scale of more than two octaves. 
Inasmuch as its powerful tone blended well with that 
of the Trombones, we can imagine how delighted were 
the composers of that day, thus to possess the equiva- 
lent of a complete brass group with a compass of 
four octaves. 
One sees mention of 
the Zincke in the Bach 
scores here and there. 
Gluck was the last great 
composer to employ it, 
but it fell into disuse, 
doubtless owing to the 
severe strain involved 
on the lungs of the 
player. Of the same 
family is the Serpent, a 
bass instrument that ow- 
ing to the length of tube 
required to give the low 
Se tones, had to be doubled 
Gaatcaitieseny back and forth like a      Serpent, hence the name. This weird and unwieldy 
member of the Zincke family lingered until the mid-

dle of the nineteenth century but is now obsolete,* its 
place being taken by the Ophicleide which has also 
fallen into disuse. 
Tue CHENG 
When Edward MacDowell went to Columbia Uni- 
versity to found the Music Department, he invited 
ten of us to give a series of lectures on topics relative 
to the evolution of music. Probably the most pictur- 
esque was that of Dr. William Adams Brown, who 
exhibited and performed upon some of the rarer in- 
struments in the remarkable collection 
donated by his mother, Mrs. Crosby 
Brown, to the Metropolitan Museum. 
Among them was a curiosity from 
China known as the Chéng or Shéng 
(pronounced shung), which consists 
of a group of bamboo pipes bound 
around a central one and fastened in a 
gourd which amplifies the sound and 
through the mouthpiece the performer 
sucks in the air (the reverse of blow- 
ing). The sound results from the 
vibrations of free reeds, one of which

practically a set of Pandian Pipes plus reeds, is used

in St. Paul, and by Wagner in Rienzi.

only on important occasions and the players, whose 
lungs are put to such a peculiar strain, often be- 
come weakened in consequence. In the latter part 
of the eighteenth century, an instrument of this kind 
was on exhibition in St. Petersburg and attracted the 
attention of an organ builder who thought of applying 
the principle of the free reed (a reed that moves 
both ways—out and in) to the Organ. The ultimate 
result of this investigation was the invention of in- 
struments like the Harmonium, Melodeon, Reed 
Organ, together with their humbler sisters, the Con- 
certina, Accordion and Harmonica (Mouth-Organ). 
Few realize when attending services in a rural church 
or a prayer-meeting in a city chapel, where serious 
thoughts blend with the tones of the Reed Organ, how 
much of the mood of the moment they owe to their 
spiritually and culturally remo‘e brethren of pagan 
China.

Tue Lyre 
The ancient Lyre (Greek Lyra) consisted of a 
hollow wooden body or resonator, from which arose 
two arms (sometimes also hollow) curved outward 
and forward. 
A crossbar or yoke connected these arms. Another 
crossbar was on the sound-chest which thus received 
the vibrations of the strings which were stretched be- 
tween the two crossbars. The Lyre had fewer strings

Harpists at Indianapolis in May, 1924, will not forget the impression

four harpists in white with their gilded Harps. It was a little difficult 
to breathe, and the heart throbs of many were quickened. 
+Performers on instruments whose tones were created by plucking 
the strings and thus throwing them into vibration often found it 
painful when the strings were of metal or were strung at a high ten- 
sion. To obviate this evil a bit of bone or metal was substituted, 
known as a Plectrum (from Gr. Plektron).

a singer to accompany himself, a feat which of course 
no Aulos player could accomplish, while as men- 
tioned in a preceding paragraph the blowing upon 
the wind instruments so distorted the features that the 
performances upon all such were confined to slaves. 
Songs accompanied by the Lyre were called lyric, a 
term which has been perpetuated in the European 
languages to this day. 
  GREEK CITHARA GREEK LYRE (Each of seven strings) 
A larger form of Lyre, the Cithera (Gr. Kithara) 
was also much in vogue. Indeed these two names 
were so frequently used indiscriminately as to puzzle 
the authorities. Nevertheless, they agree that in some 
form or other the Lyre exerted its influence on the 
peoples of Northern and Western Europe. As it is 
known, however, that the inhabitants of the British
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
Isles possessed a lyre-like instrument before the 
Christian era, some believed that they derived it from 
the plains of Western Asia, the same source from 
whence the Greeks derived theirs. Be this as it may, 
the Crot or Croit of the Kelts, called on the continent 
the Hrotta, Rotta or Rotte, was employed in its lyre- 
like form until the Welsh developed it into the Crwth 
and played it with a bow, as will be seen presently. 
Music AND MATHEMATICS 
Attention was called in a previous paragraph 
(p. 31) to the progress implied when Man discovered 
that it was not necessary to construct an entire set of 
pipes to obtain all the notes of a scale: for one pipe 
with a series of holes could with greater ease and 
certainty produce the same tones. As in the case of 
wind instruments, so also a similar treatment of 
strings proved successful. We accordingly find that 
as early as 3000 B. C. the principle of dividing a 
string into different lengths to obtain as many sounds 
was applied by musicians. The mathematicians Py- 
thagoras and Euclid (in the sixth and fourth cen- 
turies B. C.) employed an instrument known as the 
Monochord, consisting of a long box of thin wood 
with a firm bridge at either end, over which was 
stretched a wire or catgut string. A movable bridge 
being placed on the box rendered it possible to meas-
-P-A-G-E-75
    PRIMITIVE, ORIENTAL AND MEDIEVAL 65 
STRING INSTRUMENTS 
ure accurately the lengths of the string required to 
produce certain given sounds. The mathematicians 
not only in Egypt and Greece but also in Arabia, 
China and other ancient countries, early observed that 
if a string of a given length produced a certain tone 
(the fundamental) a string of half that length will 
yield a tone an octave higher, while a string one-third 
the original length will produce a twelfth above the 
fundamental.* In this co-operation of the mathema- 
ticians with the practical musicians the science of 
acoustics was developed and an intellectual quality, 
so essential to all worthy phases of Art, was imparted 
even to so preéminently an emotional expression as 
Music. 
It was the discovery of this principle that led to the 
construction of all those instruments where the tones 
are directly formed or modified by the performer 
himself and are not, as it were, “built into” the in- 
strument as is the case with the Harp, Lyre, Dulcimer 
or Pianoforte. 
Tue RELATIVES OF THE LUTE 
Those who have listened to the natives of Arabia 
strumming on their stringed instruments may find it 
- difficult to feel much enthusiasm for their art. How- 
ever, lest we think too lightly of their music, let us 
*See Gehrkens’ Fundamentals of Music, Chap. VII. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
    66 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
take to heart the import of the ancient Arab proverb, 
“He who hunts not, who loves not, who trembles not 
_ with the tones of music . . . . he isno man!” The 
angel Israfel “whose heart-strings are a Lute” is a 
peculiarly Arabian conception. But we know that 
the children of Ishmael were not merely men of fiery 
temperament, for there were among them many able 
mathematicians and that the essential combination of 
great emotional with high intellectual powers finds 
expression in the claim of the Arabs that Pythagoras 
was the inventor of the Lute, “the crown of all instru- 
ments.” The name passed through a curious series 
of metamorphoses: Arabian Al’oud (“the wood,” es- 
pecially the aloes wood of which it was constructed) 
then Portuguese Alaud, Spanish Laut, German Laute, 
French Luth, English Lute. This series of changes 
of the name may possibly indicate its gradual prog- 
ress northwards through Europe. 
But there were many kindred instruments in use 
during the Middle Ages, some with names variously 
spelled, such as the Gittern, Getern, Gyttren, Gythorn 
and later a Cithren or Cittern, then the Sytholle, 
Sitole, Cythol or Cytol. A fine representation of a 
Gittern is seen in the hands of an angel carved in the 
choir-arches at Lincoln Cathedral. . Other angels hold 
the Citole. The Gittern had a bridge as in our 
Violin, while in the Citole the strings ran straight 
across. These curious names were often confused

Tue LUTE 
The Lute is a very graceful instrument consisting 
of a large pear-shaped body with a long neck and a 
finger-board provided with frets The pear-like 
form of the Lute, Mandolin and kindred types is a 
survival of those Oriental resonators or sound ampli- 
fiers made of gourds covered with skin. The frets, 
metal transverse bars like those in our modern 
Guitars, were stationary, but served the purpose of 
dividing the strings into various lengths as effectively 
as did the movable bridge of the Monochord. They 
are-virtualtyguides_to the fingers_in_forming the

various tones and their value may be easily tested 
by the beginner who tries pro- . 
ducing a scale on the smooth 
undivided finger-board of a 
Violin and then attempts the 
same passage on a Guitar whose 
frets will greatly simplify the 
experiment. 
The Lute which flourished in 
the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries, was originally pro- 
vided with four strings (as at a) 
then two others were added 
(usually tuned as at b). Then 
as the instrument grew in popu- 
larity still others were added 
with various tunings. Finally

a worthy bass resulted in complete sets 
of Recorders and Shawms, while Sack- 
buts were made to supplement the 
Trumpets and Horns, so too were Lutes 
devised that gave the lower registers of

the Lute family became more elabor- 
ate. The larger types were known as 
Archlute, Chitarrone (or large Chitar)

of these aristocratic instruments, that

_ would be welcome.* Royal amateurs such as Henry 
VIII and his children as well as men of note like 
Martin Luther were performers on the Lute while 
J. S. Bach, wrote several pieces for it, among them 
the Fugue in G- 
  minor, later rewrit- 
ten for violin solo in D-minor and then again recast 
for the organ. 
MANDOLINE AND MANDOLA 
The only instruments in use at the present day that 
are akin to the Lute are the Mandoline and its tenor 
brother the Mandola or Mandora. The latter is ex- 
tremely rare. They may be regarded as first cousins 
to the Lute for they too have the pear-shaped back in 
common and are played with a plectrum or pick of 
ivory, horn or tortoise shell. But unlike the Lute 
they possess four unison pairs of wire strings, tuned 
respectively like the Violin and Viola.

MANDOLINE MANDOLA 
The tone of the Mandoline is fine and wiry but 
singularly penetrating, so that its presence in the or-

Mozart gives it to Don Juan in the celebrated Sere- 
nade in the opera of that name, while Verdi has 
employed it with beautiful results in Otello. In the 
Feast of Lanterns from my Aladdin Suite I have 
combined Mandoline and Harp to suggest the Chinese 
Yong Kim in a treatment of the theme given in No. 14. 
In spite of the spirit of levity usually associated 
with this instrument, I believe it capable of truly 
serious treatment. In the orchestral version of my 
setting of Poe’s Israfel I have employed the tremo- 
lando of the low strings, as I fancy they faintly re- 
semble the “wires” of which the poet writes. 
The low register of the Mandola possesses a rich 
warmth which might prove of value to the composer. 
TuHeE GuITAR 
Like the Scotsman who refers to another as “a 
cousin only seven times removed” the familiar Guitar 
may claim a certain relationship to the Lute. True, 
its_back is flat, but it has frets d>~al- 
though with fingers and thi i d of a plectrum. 
Again its tuning is somewhat lute-like—a series of 
fourths with one-third between.

but during the last few decades has been outclassed © 
by the Piano, as a household music provider. 
THE Bango 
  Another humbler and still more remote relative of 
the Lute is the Banjo, so dear to the colored people in 
the Sunny South. a am 
Although it was generally considered to be an in- 
vention of this very musical people, authorities are of 
the opinion that it is descended from the Senegambian 
Bania, or that the name is derived from Bandora. 
The Banjo has a long neck with a body like a drum- 
head of parchment, but with no back or sounding- 
board consequently the tone produced is of a humor- 
ous character, sometimes almost percussive. It has 
no frets, and the number of strings and the methods of 
tuning vary. The most gen-  FreeString 
eral tuning of the simple five ae

Curiously enough the free string is the highest of 
all instead of being in the lowest register as in all of 
the Lute tribe. 
*Dr. Burney, the English musical author relates an amusing story 
showing the absurd influence of temporary fits of fashion. He writes 
that the later 18th century in England witnessed such a craze for the 
Guitar that even ladies of fashion sold their harpsichords at a third 
of their value. To save his business a Harpsichord maker hit upon 
the device of presenting cheap Guitars to culinary maids and street 
ballad-singers “which soon made the ladies ashamed of their frivol- 
ous and vulgar taste, and return to the Harpsichord.”

Outside of Negro Minstrelsy it is not used with the 
orchestra. In The Girl of the Golden West Puccini 
forces the Harp to suggest the Banjo in certain scenes. 
Of late, performers have developed the resources 
of the improved instrument to such an extent that they 
execute bravura passages from Liszt’s Hungarian 
Rhapsodies and the like. 
THE Sam YIN AND VINA 
The peoples of the Orient with their traditions ex- 
tending backwards into the depths of time often 
present conflicting claims regarding the age of an 
invention.- Two types of Lute are to be found in var- 
ious parts of Asia, which may have been indigenous 
to their respective homes or they may have been sug- 
gested by foreigners and then modified and adopted. 
Perhaps the most striking illustrations of this principle 
are the Sam Yin of the Chinese and the Vina from 
India. As the former is the more primitive it is first 
mentioned. The Sam Yin is an instrument with three 
strings, tuned as follows: 
a) b)       
It will be seen that they give the fundamental, fifth 
and octave of the key of G (see a), which shows that 
their music has a solid basis in common with ours 
and in the melodies played upon the Sam Yin certain
-P-A-G-E-84
    74 _ MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
phrases in the tonic are repeated in the dominant. 
The only harmonies they employ result from placing 
the finger straight across the upper two strings, giving 
always parallel fourths (see 6). A complete triad 
they never use. Indeed in all Oriental countries any 
harmonies such as we enjoy are regarded as an intru- 
sion.

VINA from INDIA 
The Vina (or Veena) considered the most ancient 
instrument possessed by the Hindus, consists of a long 
hollow wooden tube supported on two empty gourds 
which add to its resonance. Beneath its seven strings 
are movable frets that can be arranged to fit the 
“mode” of the music. When the strings lying above 
them are pressed, they can give a series of quarter- 
tones. This would seem to be difficult for us to 
apprehend, accustomed as we are to whole-steps and 
half-steps. But on carefully listening to the recital in 
New York of a certain Hindu artist, Mr. Khan, who 
played and sang these quarter-steps with great clarity, 
they were indeed readily distinguished, but the long 
winding melodies were difficult to follow. However,
-P-A-G-E-85
  PRIMITIVE, ORIENTAL AND MEDIEVAL 75 
STRING INSTRUMENTS 
the Hindus also employ seven-tone scales, similar to 
ours and even the pentatonic, or five-tone, like that of 
the Chinese. One of these five-tone melodies was 
brought to our country many years ago by a mission- 
ary and is sung to the familiar words, There is a 
Happy Land, which can be played on the black keys 
of the Piano. 
PsALTERY AND DULCIMER 
In the Mohammedan countries during the early 
Middle Ages, there existed two harp-like instruments 
similar in appearance but played in quite different 
ways. One was called by the Arabs Qanon (Gr. 
Psalterion, Old. Eng. Sautry, Ger. Psalter) and the 
tones were produced by plucking the strings with 
plectrums. Its sister, the Santir, was played with two 
light wooden hammers. Both types became known 
‘throughout Europe where the latter received the name 
of Cembalo in Italy (from its brilliant brazen tone). 
The Hungarians at the present day employ a similar 
type with a similar name, Zimbalon. In Germany 
the mode of performance gave rise to the name Hack- 
brett (chopping-board) while its sweet tones led to its 
being christened Dulcimer in England. 
The Psaltery is so long obsolete that specimens are 
rare. The Dulcimer is still to be seen in museums 
but to obtain an idea of its music, we must refer to 
those types still employed by the Chinese and the

Hungarian Gypsies, namely the Yong Kim and the 
Cymbalom. The music performed on the former is

The Hungarians, although likewise limited to two 
hammers in playing the Cymbalom, obtain far more 
florid effects than are possible upon the Yong Kim. 
*The Chinese musician who played the above theme was very anxious 
for me to realize the relation of various lower tones to their upper 
octaves. Playing the lower G then the upper one, he remarked 
“Allee same,” thus proving (what some are inclined to deny) that 
the Chinese do possess a sense of the fundamentals of music. (See 
page 21.)

NO15 : Hungarian Cymbalom fragment ‘Adagio pS 
  The Arabian instruments the Qanon and Santir 
after being much modified in different lands, were 
each of them provided with keyboards, a valuable 
feature borrowed from the European Organ. 
The Psaltery with keys to govern the plectrums be- 
came the Spinet (from Lat. spina—a thorn) while the 
Germans called it a Kielfliigel or quill-clavier.. This 
system of tone production was also used in the Vir- 
ginal and Harpsichord. 
The keyed Dulcimer or Clavi-Cembalum became 
the ancestor of the Clavichord and Pianoforte. This 
group will be more fully discussed in Chapter V and 
is mentioned here merely to complete: the historical 
outline of musical instruments. 
Tue VALUE OF THE Bow 
The chief defect in all stringed instruments, 
plucked or struck, is the evanescent character of their 
tones, for no matter how lovely their quality they die 
away soon after their birth. In order to remedy this 
defect, some unknown genius (presumably a Persian
-P-A-G-E-88
” MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
or Hindu) resorted to friction. This friction was 
produced by rubbing a bow string with hair across 
one or more strings, generating a steady, continuous 
tone, that could be increased or lessened according to 
the amount of pressure brought to bear on the bow. 
Thus did the implement of the hunt, associated with 
- Apollo and Diana, which had led to the invention of 
Lyre and Harp, aid the Art of Music a second time by 
lending its service in evoking tones of greater inten- 
sity and expressiveness. 
Primitive BowEep INSTRUMENTS 
The Monochord described above when played with 
a bow was doubtless the first move toward the inven- 
tion of the Viol. Although the Monochord is more 
frequently mentioned in connection with acoustics, 
still it is worth noting that the first Lyre or Rebec 
introduced in Europe (as early as the eighth century) 
had but one string. 
We find in China two specimens of bowed instru- 
ments, each with two strings. The Yee Yin or Ur 
Heen is the smaller and is tuned in g and d. Its strings 
run into a little block of wood instead of a sounding- 
box. The bow which is lodged between the strings can 
never leave them, and produces a tone plaintive and 
shrill in the upper register and slightly absurd in the 
lower. The Voo Kam is a larger specimen and has 
the advantage of a fairly effective resonator and a 
free bow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  PRIMITIVE, ORIENTAL AND MEDIEVAL 79 
STRING INSTRUMENTS 
If a bow be applied to a group of three or more 
strings lying parallel, they will produce a jumble of 
tones unless tuned to a given chord. For this reason 
the high number of strings in the later Lutes would be 
a disadvantage, so that whether we see the bowed 
Monochord, the Yee Yin and Voo Kam of the Chinese, 
the kindred two-stringed Ravanastron or the three- 
stringed Serinda of the Hindus, there is an obvious 
effort to so place the strings that the bow can reach 
one atatime. For this reason the bridge over which 
they are strung is always convex in shape. 
THE REBEC 
Whether in imitation of instruments imported from 
the East or the result of individual experiment, the 
bow was applied to the Crwth, Crowd or Rote of the 
British Isles as early as the eleventh century. But 
it must be remembered that, while a greater and more 
sustained tone was obtained by stroking with the bow 
than by plucking the strings, these lyre-like instru- 
ments could yield but one tone ‘to a string. Hence 
the Arabian Rebec was a great improvement, for it 
not only demanded a bow but it had a fingerboard per- 
mitting a variation of pitch on each of its three 
strings. Its shrill tone enabled it to hold its own in 
the medieval orchestras. Henry VIII, the great 
royal amateur, employed three in his band.

THE ORGAN 
“The storied windows richly dight, 
Casting a dim religious light. 
There let the pealing organ blow 
To the full-voiced choir below!” 
—Milton. 
“The Organ is in truth the most daring, the most 
magnificent of all instruments invented by human 
PENIS... here Surely it is in some sort a pedestal 
on which the soul poises for a flight forth into 
space .... to cross the Infinite that separates 
heaven from earth.” —Balzac. 
S° completely has the Organ been identified with 
religious services, so interwoven are its strains 
with sacred, historical and personal memories, so in- 
dissolubly united with the saddest, as well as the 
happiest events of life, the accompaniment of deepest 
despondency and the greatest spiritual exaltation, that 
the thought of employing this noble servant of the 
church for the production of operatic or even orches- 
tral transcriptions is distasteful to many. Indeed 
these spiritual associations lead some to regard the 
83
-P-A-G-E-94
  84 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
building of municipal and extra-ecclesiastical organs 
as a secularization of the most majestic of all tone- 
producing mediums. 
But associations are sometimes misleading and en- 
gender false impressions concerning a given object. 
It was this very element of association that was re- 
sponsible for the long delayed introduction of the 
Organ in the Christian Church, for we are told that 
its employment in connection with the gladiatorial 
combats and the licentious orgies of pagan Rome en- 
gendered such an abhorrence in the minds of the 
early Christians, that not until the fifth or sixth cen- 
tury did it become a factor in divine worship. 
According to St. Augustine (354-430 A. D.), the 
term Organ was applied to all instruments “‘on which 
_ the musician performs a melody” and was “not con- 
fined to those of large dimensions in which the air 
is furnished by bellows,” thus explaining how Jubal 
is mentioned in Genesis IV: 21 as “‘the father of all 
such as handle the Harp and Organ.” But the first 
Organ to merit the name as we now use it was that 
of Ctesibius of Alexandria (circa 200 B. C.) who, 
after the manner of inventors, incorporated in his in- 
strument all the features of importance in similar 
devices. The ultimate germ from which our modern 
Pipe Organ has developed was doubtless the Pandean 
Pipe or Syrinx.* The first step in advance was taken

  HYDRAULUS 
1st century PNEUMATIC ORGAN—4th century

Frequent allusions to the Water Organ or Hydraulus 
(literally Water-Aulos) were made by Cicero, Pliny 
and other writers. But concerning its real nature 
there was for many centuries much doubt, some
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
authorities believing that the 
water ran through the pipes 
producing the tone. Finally 
in 1885, among the ruins of 
an ancient temple at Carth- 
age, there was unearthed a 
model of a typical Water 
Organ. 
A working model of this 
archeological treasure was 
prepared by the English au- 
thority, Rev..F. W. Galpin, 
who proved that the water did 
not enter the pipes, but was 
pumped up into a metal re- 
    HYDRAULIC ORGAN 
tainer and merely served to (Carthage eft. 150 A. D.) 
regulate the pressure of air in the wind chest, thus 
ensuring a steady, clear tone. This Water Organ* 
possessed nineteen keys, each about eight inches in 
length and two in width, arranged according to the 
six Greek scales and had metal springs for bringing 
the keys back to their normal position when the 
fingers were lifted. 
THe OrcANn CHRISTIANIZED 
After the Organ had received ecclesiastical sanc- 
tion it made its way through Greece, Italy and Spain

to Northern Europe. In the meantime instruments of 
one type or another were made and employed in such 
a manner as to exert a pronounced influence upon the 
progress of the art of Music itself. It was no less a 
personage than Charlemagne who introduced the first 
Organ in Germany, constructed at Aix la Chapelle 
about 811 A. D. after the model of the one in Com- 
peigne that had been presented to his father, King 
Pepin, a few years previous, by the Greek Emperor 
Constantine Copronymus. 
The visitor to Winchester Cathedral who is inter- 
ested in historical relics should not fail to descend 
into the crypt, where he will be shown certain columns 
and other fragments of the ancient Saxon Cathedral, 
the forerunner of the present one, and whose rafters 
once rang with the tones of an epoch-making Organ. 
This instrument, erected in the tenth century, pro- 
duced a remarkable impression. It possessed 400 
pipes and a contemporary writer informs us that it 
had “twice six bellows above ranged in a row and 
fourteen below,” which indicates that there were two 
series of pipes or an arrangement that would corre- 
spond to two manuals. These bellows were worked 
“by seventy strong men” who “supplied an immense 
quantity of wind.” Allusion is made to the “seven 
differences of joyous sounds adding the lyric semi- 
tone,” which has been interpreted to imply the dia- 
tonic scale with a Bb as well as B4 for the purpose of  
-P-A-G-E-98

modulation, so that a passage in C-major could also 
be sung or played in F. 
As there were no keys at this period, the wind 
being admitted to the pipes by means of “slides” 
which alternately covered and exposed the underside 
of the holes leading up to its pipes, it was impossible 
for one person to produce more than one or at most 
two tones at a time. This formidable Organ re- 
quired three performers. The slides were lettered 
according to the tones of the scale, and each octave 
was termed an “alphabet.” But in spite of the 400 
pipes there could not have been more than two or 
three octaves, as each slider opened ten pipes which 
gave such a powerful tone “that everyone stopped — 
with his hand his gaping ears,” being unable “‘to bear 
the sound,” which must have resembled that of the 
Calliopes which accompany our circus parades. The

It has been suggested that the three performers on 
this formidable Winchester Organ may have played 
those curious progressions known as the “Organum” 
introduced about this time by Hucbald, and that this 
name was derived from the instrument. (See No. 16).

Keys. The keys in use 500 years ago were three 
to five or more inches in width, one inch and a half 
thick and from eight inches to a yard or more in 
length, and it was necessary to depress them about a 
foot in order to produce a tone. The action was 
therefore slow and heavy and adapied: only to music 
in moderato or lento movement. Although a key- 
board was a feature of the Carthage Organ, this 
valuable factor was lost sight of during the Dark 
Ages, until it reappeared in the Organ of the Magde- 
burg Cathedral towards the end of the eleventh cen- 
tury, the first of which there is any authentic record. 
Tue Compass. The Compass of this Organ was 
sixteen notes, apparently about two and a half octaves 
r “alphabets,” for the Bb was as yet the only acci- 
dental in use. In the seventh century Pope John 
VIII, having abolished congregational singing and
-P-A-G-E-100
90 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
delegated this part of the service to canonicals, there 
would be no need of a greater range, for the Organ 
was used chiefly to double the vocal parts. Indeed, 
as late as the middle of the thirteenth century the 
compass did not exceed three octaves, usually from 
G to c’ or from C to c’, this representing the extent of 
men’s voices plus the falsetto tones. 
Curomatic Keys. Early in the fourteenth cen- 
tury F# was introduced in the Organ. An idea of the 
type of music rendered possible by the improvements 
in the Halberstadt Organ may be gained from the 
fragment of Dufay’s “Missa ’homme armé.”

  Note that Dufay (died 1432) was able to use an F¢ 
as well as a Bb. 
Later on the keyboard was enriched by a C# and in 
the excerpt from Palestrina’s Stabat Mater we note 
that C# as well as Bb and B4 were freely used and 
we feel the approach of modern harmony.*

By degrees Eb and finally G# were added, render- 
ing our chromatic scale complete. We who daily 
have the keyboard of Piano

can scarcely conceive the sig- 
nificance of this remarkable 
medieval achievement. It was 
in the fourteenth century that 
Organs were more generally

Keysoarps. The principle of the Keyboard seems 
to have been revived about the twelfth century in 
small movable organs called portatives in contradis- 
tinction to those which were stationary, and therefore 
called positive.

which had four keyboards, the upper clavier acting 
on all the pipes to each key, the middle one on a 
single row of pipes for a quieter effect. Their com- 
pass was about two octaves. The third keyboard of 
fourteen chromatic keys from B to A’ was played by 
the hand or by the knee, and the fourih consisted of 
an octave of pedals. 
Stops. In the fifteenth century large iron levers 
were introduced to “stop” or cut off the wind supply 
from any given row of pipes, and this invention was 
> which is drawn the prototype of our modern “stop,” 
out to alter the tone-quality or volume by setting dif- 
ferent groups of pipes in action. 
Pepats. Another fruitful innovation consisted in 
the introduction of keys for the feet. Although they 
were merely attached or “coupled” to the keys of the 
upper clavier or keyboard, the performer was enabled 
to hold down a tone in the bass with his foot while 
the upper parts were played with his hands. This 
invention gave rise to certain new terms. The key- 
board played by the hands was called a manual (Lat. 
manus—a hand) to distinguish it from the pedals 
(from Lat. pedis—the foot) played by the feet. 
When the foot sustained a long note (or “point’”)* 
it was termed a “pedalpoint” or “organpoint,” an 
expression still employed by theorists.

  THE ORGAN 93 
INDEPENDENT PEDALS 
About 1468 the Sebalduskirche of Nuremberg was 
fitted out with a set of pedals with independent pedal- 
pipes, thus virtually increasing the compass of the 
instrument. Up to this time the size of the keys for 
the hand and those for the feet was the same. But 
with independent pedal-pipes it became possible to di- 
minish the size of the keys in the manual, until about 
1500 a large hand could span an octave and not long 
after they were reduced to the present proportions. 
  THIRTEENTH CENTURY ORGAN 
The great Danish organist Buxtehude* was the first 
composer to write pieces for the Organ wholly disso- 
ciated from vocal text, thus creating for the first time 
“absolute” music. J. 5S. Bach when a youth walked 
fifty miles to Liibeck to hear him play and was so 
*Dietrich Buxtehude was born in Helsingér, Denmark, 1637, and died 
in Liibeck, 1707. He was famed far and wide as an organist and 
composer.
-P-A-G-E-104

stimulated that he developed still farther this prin- 
ciple of pure instrumental music, leaving the world a 
great literature as the result. An extract from one 
of his most characteristic works, the Organ Toccata in 
F, will give an idea of his style. 
NoO19 
Toccata in F 
  Note the canon in the octave between the soprano and

Pircu DEsIGNATION 
The lowest tone of the manual was “great C”* and 
was produced by a pipe eight feet in length and the 
entire series of pipes from that one up to the highest 
was known as a series or register of an “eight-foot 
_ pitch.” The pedal pipes sounded an octave lower 
(the low C requiring a pipe sixteen feet in length), 
so this series was termed sixteen-foot pitch. Those 
registers of the manual, on the other hand, that 
sounded an octave higher than normal, or eight-foot 
pitch, were termed four-foot pitch, the registers sound- 
ing two octaves higher, two-foot pitch. The compass 
of the manual was gradually enlarged until in the

THE ORGAN 95 
eighteenth century Bach had four and one half octaves 
at his command, while the pedals had a range of two 
octaves and a fourth with all the chromatic notes, 
enabling him to produce passages like the following 
from the above quoted Toccata in F:

Singularly enough, pedals did not make their way 
into England till 1790, three hundred years after their 
appearance in Germany, otherwise Handel’s organ 
music doubtless would have borne a stronger re- 
semblance to that of J. S. Bach. 
Woop Pires 
The early Organs, as already stated, had pipes of 
metal, but in the sixteenth century a variety of tone 
color was obtained by introducing pipes of wood. 
Experiments were made in constructing pipes of clay 
and paper and, taking a hint from the Chinese, of 
bamboo.* Another interesting and valuable revival 
of a lost art was the reintroduction of reeds, that is, 
metal pipes with tongues that vibrated after the man- 
ner of those in the Shawm or Oboe. 
*Mr. Joseph Lasser, a Russian organist who has travelled in the 
Orient extensively, tells of a large Organ in Manila with bamboo 
pipes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106

Tue MIxTuREs 
Inasmuch as it was found that the pipes of the 
Organ generated few or no appreciable overtones that 
give vitality and character to the tones of the voice 
and instruments of the orchestra, efforts were made 
to supply this lack by artificial means, so groups of 
pipes were arranged to sound with the fundamental 
responding to every key pressed. The stops or 
registers of this class are known as mixtures. They 
have been differently combined, but usually consist 
of a fundamental, with octave, twelfth, and sometimes 
the third above the double octave (tierce) so that

This effect is like some of the early organ music in 
the time of Hucbald. (See p. 89.) 
THE SWELL 
In 1712 the English organ builder Jordan invented 
another effect which proved very popular and con- 
sisted of a series of pipes placed in a box (swell-box) 
the front of which, like a Venetian Blind, could be 
opened or closed by a pressure of the foot, creating 
a crescendo and diminuendo. This was the first 
Swell Organ. Other experiments were made; pos- 
sibly the most valuable was the Progressionschweller
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE ORGAN 97 
of Abt Vogler* (1784-1796) which enabled one, by 
pressing a pedal, to draw out by degrees a few addi- 
tional stops. This device was elaborated into the 
Kollektionschweller a century later, which introduces 
gradually all the stops of the Organ. In Organs of 
today this is a rocking lever played by the organist’s 
foot and termed Crescendo Pedal. 
THE CouPpLeR 
In the seventeenth century a draw-stop was intro- 
duced in the Organ, called a coupler, by means of 
which the keys of a given manual were connected with 
those of another above or below. Thus the main key- 
board or Great Organ could be connected with the 
Swell or Choir Organ, or the pedals could be coupled 
with Great, Swell or Choir Organ. The Combination- 
Stop, an elaboration of the preceding invention, is a 
draw-stop which enables the performer to simultane- 
ously draw out several registers. A similar device 
regulated by the feet is termed a Combination Pedal. 
PNEuMATIC AND ELEcTRO-PNEUMATIC ACTION 
It is evident that the greater the number of pipes 
called into use, the greater will be the muscular force 
required to make them sound satisfactorily. So 
severe was the tension on some of the larger instru- 
ments that it was impossible for the performer to use 
*Abt Vogler, chiefly known to us through Browning’s poem of the 
name, was an able organist, inventor, composer and teacher. Among 
his pupils were Von Weber and Re rgnerr
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
the full Organ with the desired effect. To obviate 
this difficulty the Pneumatic Action was devised. 
This consists of a counter air pressure which is 
brought to bear equalizing that required to depress 
the key. The result is that the manual of an Organ 
with all its registers open, is as easy to manipulate 
as the keyboard of the Pianoforte. Even this invalu- 
able invention has been improved upon in the Electro- 
Pneumatic Action, first used in Philadelphia about 
1880. With the application of electricity the compli- 
cated mechanism of the great modern Organ with its 
thousands of pipes is under perfect control, and the 
“King of Instruments” has entered upon a new and 
richer life. 
Winp Suppiy 
The ancient Hydraulus and those built in imitation 
of it were furnished with air by means of bellows 
trodden by a number of men, ranging from four to 
seventy according to the size of the Organ. Such 
bellows seem to have been in service from the fourth 
to the fourteenth centuries. Early in the nineteenth 
century pumping mechanisms were introduced to take 
the place of manual or pedal exertion and various 
devices were tried, such as clockwork, steam, water, 
hot air, gas engines, and finally electric motors which 
have proven to be the most effective.

REsUME 
We have followed the development of the Organ 
from the grouping of a cluster of pipes or reeds, 
blown by the performer himself, to the mighty instru- 
ment with many series of pipes, supplied with wind 
by many bellows. We have seen how in the ancient 
European Organs, owing to the great size of the keys 
and the stiffness of the action, it required two or more 
players to force them down with their fists, but that, 
little by little, the keys were made smaller and 
smaller until it was possible for the performer to span 
an octave with one hand. ‘The action too became 
more plastic so that with the aid of the pneumatic 
system (since replaced frequently by electric action) 
the organist can render upon the full Organ the most 
rapid passages with great facility. 
It is possible therefore, to give a brief description 
of the Organ, as it has existed for the past century or 
more, and as the composers of organ music conceive 
it when penning their creations. 
Mopern ORGANS 
A unique feature of the Organ is its extraordinary 
adaptability to the environment even under widely di- 
verse conditions. Like Gothic architecture which 
lends its character to the modest porter’s lodge as well 
as to the most magnificent cathedral, the Organ can 
be so devised as to suit the requirements of a simple
-P-A-G-E-111
THE ORGAN 101 
  chapel or it can be expanded to such dimensions as to 
satisfy the demands of a great exposition building. 
It is sometimes found in small churches in Europe ° 
with but one manual and no pedals, but in our country 
there are usually pedals to the extent of an octave and 
a fifth, with four to eight registers (sets of pipes) in 
the manual (Great Organ) of the smallest specimens. 
The moment we have two manuals at our disposal 
a great advantage is obviously derived, as it is then 
possible to play a melody on one, while the accom- 
paniment is played on the other, more softly, or in 
contrasting tone-color. This lends a variety impossi- 
ble to acquire on a one-manual Organ. 
In Organs planned for private residences or 
churches of moderate size the organ-builder of taste 
sees to it that the “voicing” of the various registers 
is homogeneous so that all blend well together and 
no one stop is unpleasantly prominent. Sometimes 
the builder is overruled by the church committee, who 
honestly wish the worth of their money in tone vol- 
ume. Consequently certain pipes, usually the Open 
Diapason, aré so adjusted as to do double duty age 
  the blatant register drowns all the 
others. The average compass of the == 
manual keyboard is: 
while the pedal range is generally the 2 
same as in Bach’s time: —— 
Two Manual Organs are usually divided as fol- 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
lows: Great Organ, Swell Organ, and Pedal Organ. 
Three Manual Organs: Great, Swell, Choir, and 
Pedal. 
Four Manual Organs: Great, Swell, Choir, Solo, 
and Pedal. | 
In five Manual Organs the fifth is the Echo Organ, 
though this is usually played from the Solo manual 
or from the Choir. The pipes of this Organ are 
usually concealed high in the vaulted roof of the © 
church where its delicate registers yield an ethereal | 
effect like an echo, hence its name. The electric | 
connection between the keyboard and the pipes makes , 
this possible, and also.the playing of Organs at op- 
posite ends of a large church-from a single console.* , 
In concert halls the Organ console is detachable from 
its electric connection and can be moved out of sight 
when not in use. 
A word should be said regarding the principal 
groups or tone families into which the various stops 
are divided. The four main divisions are 1. Diapa- 
son, or Organ foundation tone, 2. Flute tone, 3. 
String tone, and 4. Reed tone. In a properly con- 
structed Organ, whether large or small, these differ- 
ent tone qualities are present and properly balanced. 
*The combined keyboards, pedals, draw-stops, couplers, etc. by which 
the performer controls the entire organ mechanism is termed the 
console,

In closing, attention should be called to the fact 
that, as in the case of all other creations of mortal 
man, the Organ has its positive and negative qual-
-P-A-G-E-114
    104 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
ities. The skilled organist with a typical instrument 
of the present day, has a greater variety of dynamic 
effects at his command than a performer on any other 
tone-producing medium. He can pass by degrees 
from ppp to fff, or he can make the transition at once. 
Inasmuch as the modern concert Organ is practically 
a combination of instruments, the player has a great 
number of tone colors with which to decorate the out- 
lines of the musical composition he renders. Hav- 
ing, moreover, a keyboard for the feet, he can 
produce two more tones in the lower portion of the 
harmonic structure and by means of various couplers 
can add not only octave after octave above and below 
the tones represented by the keys pressed by his 
fingers, but by employing the “mixtures” he can 
throw into the sound-mass a great number of arti- 
ficial overtones above each fundamental. 
On the other hand there are certain limitations in 
respect to musical expressiveness which the greatest 
artists endeavor to conceal, some succeeding to such 
an extent that the existence of these disadvantages is 
overlooked or forgotten, thus giving that emphasis 
which the composer would demand from the Piano 
or orchestra. The very virtue of the evenly sustained 
tone which is possible to the Organ as upon no other 
instrument has its complementary difficulty, for this 
equable dynamic quality renders it impossible to 
accent the important notes in a phrase. To minimize 
this drawback, builders have, within the past few

but the other manuals, Great, Choir, Solo and Echo,

the question upon the Pianoforte and with a homo- 
geneity of tone quality rarely heard in the orchestra.

ages up to the present time, have spent decades of 
thought and labor in evolving the many features of 
the Pianoforte* and bringing it to its present degree 
of perfection. Without their efforts we should be 
unable to enter into communication with the com- 
poser, while he on the other hand, deprived of the 
inspiration afforded by the instrument, and a 1ealiza- 
tion of its capabilities, would never be able to ex- 
press his thoughts and feelings, which on being re- 
produced, awaken in us similar emotions. 
From the “twanging and the clanging of the heavy, _ \ 
brazen bells” to the delicate upper tones of the Piano, 
there is a vast difference in quality and volume, and 
yet these sound-producing media are related, al- 
though distantly, for in each the principles of per- 
cussion are involved and all such may trace their 
ancestry back to the Pien-King one of the oldest, if, 
not the most ancient of instruments known, the / 
Chinese claiming that it was invented from 4,000 to 
4,500 years ago. (See page 21). 
THE PREDECESSORS OF THE PIANOFORTE

awakened by the vibration of a string, to the present 
day, countless inventions have appeared, many of

Although the more important of these devices have

VIRGINAL, OR SPINET, BY ANDREAS RUCKERS, 1610 
(Leslie Mason Collection, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) 
By glancing at the table of Stringed Instruments on 
page 60 it will be seen that section a is devoted to 
those that are plucked, while section c comprises 
such as are struck. Of all these instruments those 
that were most closely related to the modern Piano-

forte were the Psaltery and the Dulcimer. As was 
shown on page 76 these instruments were very sim- 
ilar, the chief difference consisting in the manner of 
playing them; the strings of the Psaltery being 
plucked with a plectrum of ivory, metal or quill, 
while those of the Dulcimer were struck with small 
hammers held, one in each hand. 
It was shown in Chapter III that the Psaltery was 
the forerunner of the Spinet, the tones of which were 
produced by a series of jacks controlled by keys, 
while the Dulcimer was the immediate ancester of 
the Pianoforte, the tone-compelling hammers being set~ 
in motion also by keys.

of the Psaltery were adjusted to the keys. These 
jacks were usually made of pear-tree and rested on 
the back end of the key lever, which was of the most 
primitive form, and had movable tongues of holly, 
working on a center which was kept in place by a 
brittle spring. A thorn or spike of crow-quill pro- 
jected at right angles from the tongue.* 
On the key being depressed, the jack was of course 
forced upward, and the quill brought in contact with 
the string, which was thus thrown into vibration. 
When the key returned to its level the jack followed 
it and descended; and the quill then passed the string 
without resistance or sound. It is not known when 
the jack was introduced, but the supposition is that 
it was during the fourteenth century The oldest 
Spinets were without covers, and resembled Dulci- 
mers. In many instances the terms Spinet, Harpsi- 
chord and Virginal were used interchangeably. 
There seems, however, to have been this distinction, 
that a Spinet had but one wire to each key, whereas 
the Harpsichord had two unisons.

William Byrd* (1542-1623). It will be noticed that 
whereas in music for Psaltery or Dulcimer only two 
parts were available (one being played with each 
hand) in these measures for Spinet, controlled as it 
was by a keyboard played with several fingers,t there 
are three and four voice parts. The extract also 
shows the influence of the ecclesiastical style of which 
Byrd was also a master, he being an organist as well 
as a Spinet player.

The possibilities of virtuoso passages on the Spinet 
may be realized from the selection (No. 23) from The 
King’s Hunting Jigg, by Dr. John Bull, organist and 
Virginal player to Queen Elizabeth and King James I. 
So great was his mastery of the Spinet that he has been 
referred to as “the Liszt of his day.” The closing 
measures doubtless were suggestions of the hunts- 
men’s horns.

THE HarPsICHORD 
The strings of the Harpsichord were arranged in 
__a manner similar to those of the modern Grand Piano. 
‘In front, immediately over the keys, was the wrest- 
plank with the tuning pins inserted, round which were 
wound the nearer ends of the strings, the further ends 
being attached to hitch pins driven into the sounding 
board itself. It is obvious therefore, that the tension 
applied could not be very great, otherwise the sound- 
' ing board would be ruined. / 
  
  
      
HANDEL’S HARPSICHORD, MADE BY ANDREAS RUCKERS, 1651 
(Victoria and Albert Museum, London) 
The Ruckers family, who lived in Antwerp between 
the years 1579 and 1650, achieved a great reputation 
as Harpsichord manufacturers, and owing to their
-P-A-G-E-125

many improvements, ac the instrument to a high 
degree of perfection. “Hans, the eldest, added to the 
two unison strings of each note a third of shorter 
length and finer wire, tuned an octave higher, thus 
increasing the power and brilliancy of tone. To em- 
ploy this extra series of strings at will, alone or with 
one or both the unison strings, a draw stop, similar 
to those of an Organ, was introduced. Shudi, a Lon- 
don manufacturer (1769) patented a Venetian swell, 
an adaption from the Organ to the Harpsichord. 
Kirkman, another London man, added a pedal to 
raise a portion of the top or cover, also for the pur- 
pose of increasing the sound. Both used two pedals; 
the one for the swell, the other to shut off the octave 
and one of the unison registers, leaving both hands 
free. We see then the germs of the modern damper 
pedal, as well as a foreshadowing of the Pianoforte 
itself. 
THE CLAVICHORD 
The Clavichord differed from the Spinet in that 
the wires were struck by tangents, thus introducing 
the principle of percussion in place of the plectrum. 
In shape the Clavichord has been followed by the 
square Pianoforte, of which it was the prototype. 
The case was oblong, and was placed upon a stand 
or legs. The length, according to the compass and 
period of construction, was from four to five feet; 
the breadth, of less than two feet; the vertical depth 
 
-P-A-G-E-126

of case, five to seven inches. The keys were in front, 
and extended beneath the sound board to the back of 
the case, each being balanced upon a wire pin, and 
prevented from rattling against its neighbor by a 
small piece of whalebone projecting from the key and

sheathed ina groove behind. The lower, or natural, 
keys were usually black, and the upper, or chromatic, 
white. In Italy and the Netherlands the practice was 
the reverse. The strings of finely drawn brass wire 
were stretched nearly in the direction of the length 
of the case, but with a bias toward the back. Nearly 
at the back of each key, in an upright position, was 
placed a small brass wedge, or “tangent,” about an 
inch high and an eighth of an inch broad at the top. 
The tangent, when the key was put down, rose to the 
string and pressing it upward, set it in vibration. 
With a good touch the player could feel the elasticity
-P-A-G-E-127
. THE PIANO AND ITS PREDECESSORS 117 
of the string, and the more this was felt the better the 
instrument was considered to be. By the pressure of 
the tangent the string was divided into two unequal 
lengths, each of which would have vibrated, but the 
shorter was instantly damped by a narrow band of 
cloth interlaced with the strings, which also damped 
the longer section directly the player allowed the key 
to rise and the tangent to fall. The tangents thus not 
     
                                                only produced the tones, but served as a second 
bridge to measure off the vibrating lengths as the 
frets of the Lute required for the pitch of the notes. 
Thus a delicate tone was obtained that had something 
in it charmingly hesitating or tremulous; a tone, al- 
though very weak, yet capable, unlike the Harpsichord 
or Spinet, of increase or decrease, reflecting the finest 
and most tender gradations of the touch of the 
player, and was in this power of expression without 
a rival until the invention of the Pianoforte. An ad- 
mired effect of the Clavichord was a change of 
intonation caused by a strong pressure of the key, 
which displacing a little the point of contact of the 
tangent, tightened the vibrating part of the string, thus 
making the note very slightly sharper in pitch. An- 
other feature which Beethoven endeavored to imitate 
on the Pianoforte, was a repetition of a note without 
quitting the key, an effect which could not be pro- 
duced upon the Harpsichord. 
It may be seen, therefore, that both the Harpsi- 
chord and Clavichord had their characteristic excel-

lences and also their weak points. It was but na- 
tural that the mechanical musicians sought to invent 
an instrument which would combine the salient fea- 
tures of both with the defects of neither. 
EquaL TEMPERAMENT 
       
                            The title Well-tempered Clavichord is familiar to 
all, and some of us realize that this unapproachable 
group of forty-eight Preludes and Fugues was written 
by Bach to enforce the employment of the equal tem- 
perament and to utilize all the known major and 
minor scales. But not everyone has stopped to notice 
that each number was written within the compass of 
four octaves. “By working within limitations the 
Master shows his powers.” (Jn der Beschrankung 
zeigt sich erst der Meister). Thus said Goethe and if 
anyone ever demonstrated the truth of this aphorism 
it was Bach. The opening measures of the C-minor 
Fantasie (a) exhausts this range at one sweep, and 
the fragment from the great Chromatic Fantasie and 
Fugue (b) shows that this too was written within the 
same confines, inasmuch as the modern editor apolo- 
gizes for bringing the fugue theme in octaves “in 
imitation of the Organ pedals.”

That there were many attempts to produce a Harp- 
sichord with hammers is very evident, not alone from — 
the conflicting claims of various nations, but it is in 
the nature of things that whenever a universal want 
is felt, more than one man thinks he alone has the 
first solution to the problem. 
The chief difficulty to surmount in introducing 
hammers into the Harpsichord was the great increase 
of tension (which would endanger the sounding 
board), owing to the heavier wires and greater force 
of the blow than that needed in the Harpsichord or 
Spinet, and the greater distance through which the 
hammer must pass, thus necessitating a stronger 
frame than was possessed either by the Clavichord or 
Harpsichord.

Tue Piano E ForTE 
These obstacles were at length successfully over- 
come by Bartolomeo Cristofori, a Florentine Harpsi- 
chord maker, who in 1720 made the Piano e Forte 
shown here. It has a range of fifty-four notes while 
the Piano of today has eighty-eight. 
  
      
  PIANO E FORTE BY CRISTOFORI, 1720 
(Crosby Brown Collection, Metropolitan Museum) 
As stated before, other artisans had been experi- 
menting about the same time in the endeavor to 
construct a satisfactory Harpsichord with hammers. 
A French Harpsichord manufacturer, Marius, de- 
signed as early as 1716 four models for hammer-harp- 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
    THE PIANO AND ITS PREDECESSORS 121 
sichords. Schroeter, a native of Saxony was also 
interested—in_ combining the characteristics of the 
Harpsichord_and Clavichord about _this” time, and in 
1721 deposited _at the Saxon Court the models o: of two 
hammer_actions,_one overstriking, the other under- 
striking... Owing to the position of the damper, no ° 
sustained tone was possible. It was owing to defects 
of this kind that we find the works of writers of that 
period so full of mordents, turns and pralltrillers, the 
object being to prolong the tone. 
It seems that owing to the opposition from the per- 
formers on the Clavichord in Italy, an opposition that 
every new invention is liable to awaken, the manu- 
facture of Pianofortes began to decline some time 
after the death of Cristofori, although he had a num- 
ber of followers. That his system, however, took 
root in other soil may be seen from the action of the 
Piano made by the celebrated Germ2n manufacturer, 
Silberman, in which the funaamental principles of 
the Cristofori mechanism were applied. 
The Pianofortes heretofore mentioned were all in 
shape like the Harpsichord, triangular or wing 
shaped (hence the German name Fliigel). 
THE Square Piano 
In_the Se In_ the _

-P-A-G-E-132
    122 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
and made to look like tables, and are still called in 
Germany Tafelklaviere—Table-pianos. 
Although the Fliigel, or wing-shaped Piano, had 
been the original form employed, the action of the 
Grand Piano was not known until about 1776. Its 
invention is attributed to a Dutchman, Americus 
Bachers. It is an improvement of Cristofori’s first 
idea and was ultimately known as the “English 
- action,” as it was called on the Continent. 
ENGLISH AND GERMAN PIANO ACTIONS + 
Mr. John Broadwood, of the celebrated house of 
John Broadwood & Sons, together with an apprentice, 
Robert Stodart, assisted Bachers to perfect this action, 
which has held its own up to the present time, having 
been endorsed by Chopin and other leading pianists. 
In Germany, one Stein employed an action in which 
the escapement differs from both Cristofori’s and the 
English action. From the resulting difference a rad- 
ical change of touch took place, and an extreme light- 
ness became the characteristic of the Viennese action 
as developed by Andreas Streicher, Stein’s son-in-law. 
This lightmess of touch in such contradiction to the 
heavy action of the English makers was very em- 
phatically commented upon by Carl Maria von Weber 
while in England. The fragments from Mozart’s 
Sonata in A-minor show the delicacy of action and 
light tone of the Vienna Piano, but passages like that

  In all probability there never was a period in the 
history of the Piano marked by such vital changes as 
that which was coincident with Beethoven’s career. 
By taking distinctive features of his Sonatas from 
Op. 2 to Op. 111 we can form an idea of the remark- 
able growth of the instrument with respect to compass 
and sonority.

Beethoven utilized all available tone-producing in- 
struments to the utmost, and we see that in his very 
first Sonatas for the Piano he exhausted its five-octave 
range (see No. 26a). In Op. 10, No. 3, the composer 
suggests in a small note a high F# (see 6) as much as 
to say, “In case it exists in your instrument.” Pos- 
sibly the suggestion was a prophecy or the key may 
_ have been introduced in a few specimens. Not till 
Op. 57 do we see higher tones, when the c above high 
cis demanded. (See c). In Op. 81 we find the f 
above this (see d) giving a range of six octaves while 
in the last page of Op. 111 may be seen the note an 
octave below low C in the bass-(see e). 
In the year 1816 when Op. 90 appeared, the tone 
of the Piano had evidently grown materially, for we 
notice an effort to distribute the chords somewhat 
after the manner of later writers. Compare f with 
Nos. 27 to 30. Nevertheless, at g a group of thick, 
heavy chords appear in the bass again, due to two 
causes: first, it was a survival of earlier methods; 
second, the hearing of the composer was so impaired 
that he resorted to an ear trumpet and frequently 
gave voice to regrets at the loss of his fine powers of 
discrimination. These passages looked well on 
paper, and he doubtless hoped they sounded as well, 
Ss although he could not hear the muddy effects on the 
more modern Piano,

DaMPER PEDAL 
The damper-pedal (patented by Broadwood in 
1783) was a great factor in magnifying the tone. It 
was no longer necessary to keep up a constant repeti- 
tion of chords as in No, 26g or broken up after the 
manner of the older writers (called by the French 
     
  Z Z 
  batteries) but new figures and phrases were invented 
and applied. Beethoven received a gift of an im- 
proved Grand Pianoforte from Mr. Broadwood while 
he was writing the great Sonata Op. 106, and we feel 
the effects of his influence at once. Observe the wide 
leaps of the bass with the pedal sustained through the 
opening four measures.

Helmholtz calls especial attention to the harmonics 
generated by the lower tones of the Piano, while in 
the upper registers they are few in number. “In the 
lower octaves the second and third harmonics are 
often as strong, the second in fact even stronger, as 
the fundamental itself,” This being the case it is ob-

vious that when the damper pedal is raised the gene- 
ration of overtones is greatly increased. (See p. 47.)

Succestions From NATURE 
Whoever inspects an illustrated history of costumes 
is amused at some of the weird methods employed by . 
human beings to clothe and decorate themselves. It 
seems strange that apparel grotesque in the extreme 
could have been worn by serious-minded beings; 
strange that people were attracted to that which was 
ugly because it was new, and how those who disliked 
it at first became inured to it through habit. But 
granting the gratification of the love for the novel to 
be truly justifiable, it is significant that the classic 
garments of the Greeks and Romans always present 
a pleasing, appearance, and that every now and again 
fashion makers revert to them as a safe resort. And 
why are these habiliments so refreshing to the eye? 
Because they more than any others permit the human 
figure to serve as the main theme of the composition, 
while the draperies delicately furnish the subordinate 
motives—the flowing lines idealizing or obviating any 
angularities due to the motion of the limbs. 
Thus too is it with the distribution of the tonal 
masses. The nearer we approach the suggestions of 
Nature, the more nearly do we approach ideal chord- 
construction. Compare the harmonies from the 
fourth Nachtstiick (Night Vision) by Schumann and 
see how remarkably they suggest the tone series given 
on p. 47.

See how carefully Schumann avoids putting the 
third of the chord in the lowest register, and if we 
play (applying the pedal) each chord slowly, the 
order of the Nature series is felt to be the guiding 
power. 
CHOPIN’S USE OF THE PEDAL 
Again, observe the wide oar-like sweep of the bass 
(at a and c in No. 28) in the excerpt from Chopin’s 
Barcarolle (a pedal with each beat). Watch espec- 
ially the remarkable building up of the rich har- 
monies at b. The melcdic outline is a simple scale of 
Ft-major, while the inner parts form a chord of the 
dominant 11th (with a slight hint at a 13th). Notice 
that instead of a crescendo, as the voices ascend, there 
is a diminuendo, a suggestion of hazy overtones—and 
yet, Chopin never indulges in smears, blurs or 
smudges. You can always play his works. slowly 
and enjoy their wonderful harmonic evolutions.*

Among the more recent writers, Edward MacDowell 
may be cited as one who possessed a special gift for 
sonorous tone combinations. The student may easily 
verify ‘this by taking at random almost any piece 
wrought by this composer. 
Reactionary Mreruops 
In the light of these revelations, that show a few 
- points in which the so-called Romantic School had 
made genuine advances on the achievement of the 
Classical, it seems singular that so scholarly a com- 
poser as Brahms, who had such intimate relations 
with Robert and Clara Schumann, should not have 
shown more sympathy with the Romantic movement.* 
But if we glance at certain typical chord forma- 
tions such as we find in this excerpt from his Trio, 
*Richard Wagner was present when Schumann’s epoch-making 
Quintet was first given in Dresden. In an enthusiastic letter to the 
composer he exclaimed, “The first two movements are continually 
running through my mind. I see in what direction you are going 
and I assure you that thither too will I go; it is the only artistic 
salvation—Beauty!”

Op. 101, we are forced to believe that he either had 
little sense of sonority or his resistance of the Wagner- 
Liszt tendencies was so intense as to drive him into 
ultra-classical methods.

by the low F. The student may construct for him- 
self the series of overtones arising from the chords 
at d, e and f. 
Brahms is at his pianistic best when, abandoning 
his parallel thirds and sixths, he expresses himself 
in those Schumann-like arabesques which we find in 
some of his later pieces for Piano and the accompani- 
ments to his more atmospheric songs. 
In closing, the attention of the student is called to 
the influence which the development of the Piano has 
exerted on the literature of music. This influence 
has by no means been confined to works written for 
the Piano, but has extended to a multitude of compo- 
sitions for chorus and orchestra, as well as to those 
written for performance in connection with the stage. 
AMERICAN IMPROVEMENTS 
The extremes of heat and cold characteristic of 
the American climate, which proved so detrimental to 
the European Piano when transferred to this country 
suggested the idea of strengihening the instrument. 
Accordingly Jonas Chickering of Boston produced, in 
1837, a Square Piano with an iron frame, a device 
which he afterwards introduced in his Grand Pianos. 
In 1855 the firm of Steinway and Sons of New York 
combined the iron frame with an’ overstrung bass, 
a system that has since been employed by makers 
here and abroad. The Steinways among other im-

provements added two important inventions,—the 
agraffe (or metal stud) bridge and the sustaining 
pedal. The latter enables the performer to hold 
down a tone in the bass while various harmonies 
are produced in the upper register.

THE VIOLIN FAMILY 
“The instrument on which he played 
Was in Cremona’s workshops made.” 
—Longfellow, Tales of a Wayside Inn. 
; be tracing the development of those sound-produc- _ 
ing media which have made possible our modern 
orchestras, and rendered the art of music worthy of 
a place beside its sisters—poetry, acting, painting, 
sculpture and architecture—there is probably no one 
locality that has played so important a role in this 
evolution as Cremona in Northern Italy. This dis- 
tinction was earned for that city by a long line of 
artistic inventors to whom we owe what is considered 
the most expressive of our musical instruments, the 
Violin. 
When we discuss the Violin, we naturally in- 
clude its kindred—the Viola, Violoncello, and Double 
Bass—for this family has served as the foundation-of 
the orchestra from the time of their introduction to 
the present day. Furthermore, the Violin was the 
first instrument of our modern-orchestra to attain 
perfection, and in describing its characteristic fea-

tures and musical possibilities, it will be noted that 
these details will—in a general way—correspond to 
those of the other members of the group. 
HistoricaL Notes 
The name of Gaspar da Salo is associated with the 
primitive Violin, but the first maker of the instrument 
as we now know it was Andreas Amati, concerning 
whom littl is known save that he died about 1577. 
Not only his brother Nicola, but his sons, Antonio 
and Geronimo, as well as his grandson Nicolo (1596- 
1684) were master builders of the celebrated “‘Cre- 
monas,” while the last named numbered among his 
pupils Guarnerius and Stradivarius, who carried the 
art to its ultimate perfection. 
Details such as quality of the wood, character of 
the varnish, shape of the back, belly, and sounding- 
board; position of the bridge and sound-post, the 
curve of the f holes—all these demanded and re- 
ceived the most careful consideration. Some seventy 
pieces of wood were required in the construction of 
the Violin, and the manner of disposing of them was 
subjected to mathematical calculation, due attention 
being paid to the laws of acoustics. Statisticians are 
fond of showing that while the raw materials of which 
a Violin is composed might be purchased for about 
five dollars, they become, after being fashioned by 
genius and seasoned with age, instruments of beauty
-P-A-G-E-148
    138 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
that are valued from $1,000 to $2,500 while fancy 
prices of $20,000 and upward are paid by connois- 
seurs. 
TUNING 
«The Violin has four strings of gut, the lowest being 
wound with metal, usually silver. Of late metal 
strings have been tried. The traditional tuning is-in 
fifths, and the strings are e numbered from 
above downwards. i     ie 
Paganini and other great virtuosi have varied this 
tuning somewhat, usually by raising the pitch to 
secure greater brilliancy of tone. Saint-Saéns, on 
the contrary, in the score of his Danse Macabre re- 
quests the leading first violinist or concert-master to 
lower the upper string to Eb in order to suggest the 
grotesque fiddling of the Grim Reaper seated on a 
tombstone. (See No. 32).

In Chapter III mention was made of the fact that 
one of the chief differences between the Viol and 
Violin families consisted in the fact that whereas the 
former were provided with frets, or finger guides, the 
latter had none. This, as will be seen, exerted a sig- 
nificant influence upon the technique of the Violin,
-P-A-G-E-149
THE VIOLIN FAMILY 139 
  for the performer is obliged to make his own scales, 
which involves a keener perception of pitch than is 
required where the tones are already at hand, as is 
the case with the Piano and Organ. 
Coincident with the training of the ear is the culti- 
vation of the sense of touch. We read of certain 
dealers in textiles who acquire such acuteness of this 
faculty that by feeling a piece of silk or linen they 
can estimate the number of threads to the inch. A 
similar accuracy of space measurement is required 
of the violinist to enable him to calculate the smaller 
intervals upon the fingerboard, especially in the 
higher registers where they are quite minute. f 
Taking the open strings as a starting point, the 
\ various scales are produced by shortening or stopping 
the strings with the tips of the fingers at various dis- 
tances from the bridge. At a in the subjoined table 
we have the series of the first position; at b we have 
that of the second position. It will be seen that a 
“position” implies the series of consecutive tones that 
can be played by the fingers 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the left 
hand on the G, D, A and EF strings, without shifting 
the place (position) of the left hand. :

(The notes indicate the highest tones in the various positions) 
The fourth and fifth positions enable the player to 
reach the e and f above, while the sixth, seventh, 
eighth and ninth positions make it possible for him to 
attain the still higher g, a, b, and c. Beethoven was 
evidently the first to demand this c in his Egmont 
Overture. The culminating chord in the Tannhduser 
Overture required the e above (eleventh position) and 
since the appearance of that work Wagner and later 
writers have. demanded still higher tones. 
DousLe Stops 
Combinations of two tones are of course easier 
when one of them is produced on an “open” string, 
but all major and minor sixths are quite feasible. 
Chords of three and four tones, or triple and quad- 
ruple stops are also valuable tone combinations at 
*the disposal of the composer. Owing to the convex- 
ity of the bridge it is obvious that the bow can come 
in contact with only two strings at once, but when the 
performer gives a firm sweeping movement across the 
strings, the bow can arpeggiate, so to speak, chords 
of three or four tones. An orchestral group, playing 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  
THE VIOLIN FAMILY 141 
in this manner, can evolve a fortissimo of terrific in- 
tensity. 
It sometimes occurs that in a passage difficult or 
impracticable for one player to perform, it is simpli- 
fied by dividing it, so that (there being two players at 
each desk) one plays the upper part while the other 
takes the lower. Such passages are marked divisi. 
This method is applied not only to the Violins but to 
Violas, "Cellos, and even the Double Basses. 
Harmonics 
According to the principle elucidated in Volume I 
of this series—Chapter VII—a string divided into two 
parts yields the octave above, divided into three the 
twelfth above, into four parts the double octave, etc.* 
A similar series of tones is obtained if, instead of 
pressing the string down éo the fingerboard, the fingers 
lightly touch the string at the point that divides it 
into 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 parts. The difference in the 
result consists in the quality of tone, which is of a 
flute-like character; indeed, these tones are called in 
Germany flageolet tones, and in English they are 
termed 4armonics, and are indicated by a zero sign 
(0) placed above the note that is to be thus rendered. 
A remarkable instance of the employment of these

  While the Orientals employ the bow in an indis- 
criminate see-sawing upon the strings, our European 
composers and performers take great pains to mark 
‘the downward and upward stroke, the former by the 
mark m or w, and the latter by the sign VY or A 
True, one concert-master carefully indicates these 
movements in the string parts in what he considers 
the most effective manner; while another takes the 
same parts and marks them quite otherwise, in some 
cases exactly the reverse of the former. A striking 
difference between these two methods of producing 
the tone in respect to quality and volume is sometimes 
manifest. I once had occasion to observe this while 
rehearsing the Finale of the Tchaikovsky E Minor 
Symphony. On first reading the Allegro theme the 
string group played it with alternate strokes as at a.

the sonority, so much stronger was the down-stroke 
than the up-stroke. 
By carefully utilizing the various bow strokes, ob- 
serving the interchange of legato and staccato, an in- 
finite variety of phrasing is possible, 
TREMOLO 
A valuable feature of the Violin technique consists 
in the rapid repetition of one, two or more tones, pro- 
ducing a trembling, appropriate to intensely agitated 
moods, or again in pianissimo passages in the upper 
registers it is suggestive of exaltation. We thus find 
the tremolo employed by the great masters to inten- 
sify moods varying from the contemplation of the 
Holy Grail, to Hagen’s murder of Siegfried. 
Beside the measured tremolo, where a definite num- 
ber of tones are produced, as in the Introduction to 
Act III of Lohengrin (No. 35 a and b), there is the 
indefinite tremolo, where we often find the word 
tremolo above the notes in order that the quality of 
agitation may not be missing (No. 35 c).

Pizzicato 
An old-time actor once told me of reciting a poem 
accompanied by the “picked staccato” of the Violins. 
This expression, although technically inaccurate, is 
strikingly suggestive, for when the strings of any 
instrument of the Violin family are played pizzicato, 
they are picked, and the result is staccato.* What is 
this picking or plucking but a going back to first 
principles, and setting the strings into vibration with- 
out the aid of the bow? (See Chapter IT, page 62.) 
The usual simple process is so familiar to all that 
illustration is unnecessary, however, in the works 
of Rimsky-Korsakoff, the brilliant orchestrator, we 
find certain remarkable experiments. In his Capric- 
°*The abbreviation pizz. is used when the strings are to be plucked, 
after which the word arco indicates a resumption of the bow.
-P-A-G-E-155

cio Espagnol, the composer obtains a startling effect 
by causing all the Violins and ’Cellos to strike the 
strings back-and-forth, and to be sure that his inten- 
tions are carried out he takes pains to mark them with 
the down and up marks used in bowing. (See No. 37).

            BP            
A further elaboration of the process we find in this 
great Russian’s symphonic poem Scheherazade, where 
he virtually calls for a pizzicato tremolo, but the 
climax of all pizzicato achievement is to be found 
in the Scherzo of Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony 
where the entire string group from the Violins to 
Double Basses play throughout the movement with 
never a touch of the bow. 
Cot Lecno 
Sometimes in order to produce a certain weird and 
unusual effect the composer demands that the strings 
be struck “with the wood” (col legno) of the bow. 
So the players apply the back of the bow instead of 
the hair. This procedure was one of the many orig- 
inal devices employed by Saint-Saéns in his Danse
-P-A-G-E-156
  146 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
Macabre, one of the most picturesque symphonic 
poems ever conceived. Wagner calls for the same 
effect in Act II of Siegfried, where Mime is brewing 
the poison with which he hopes to destroy Siegfried, 
and again he requests its aid in a more cheerful scene 
in Act III of Die Meistersinger, at the entry of the 
various Guilds. Here all the strings col legno fur- 
nish the harmonies, while stopped Trumpets (de- 
scribed in the next chapter) suggest the little toys, 
the manufacture of which have helped make Nurem- 
berg famous for centuries.

Here attention should be called to the very sparing 
use by truly great masters of this and kindred highly 
spiced effects. In the above excerpt the col legno is 
employed for only four measures. Its appearance in 
the Danse Macabre is just as restricted. On the other 
hand, in the works of the mediocrities, where 
laboured external effects must take the place of ideas, 
piquant passages are prolonged till satiety ensues.
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE VIOLIN FAMILY 147 
THE SoRDINE oR MuTE 
In order to deaden the tone in passages where a 
pianissimo is desired, a little three-pronged comb- 
shaped device, usually of metal, is applied to the 
bridge of a Violin, Viola, "Cello, and, rarely, to the 
Double Bass. The effect is often most poetic, and 
may be regarded as an orchestral whisper. 
VioLtIn PAssaGEs AND FIGURES 
As we proceed in our investigation of tone-produc- 
ing media, we are impressed more and more with 
the fact that each instrument has its mode of expres- 
sion, and a musical phrase that is characteristic of 
one, and easy to play, on being transferred to another 
often sounds out of place, and is clumsy or difficult 
to execute. 
When given melodic phrases, scale, arpeggio or 
other passages are especially adapted to the needs or 
possibilities of the Violin or Piano, they are called 
in German violinmdssig and -klaviermdssig, a com- 
pact, comprehensive expression for which, unfor- 
tunately there is no English equivalent. 
Forces move in the line of least resistance, hence 
the most effective passages for any instrument, are 
those which are most readily rendered. In the case 
of the Violin, where the tones must be prepared by 
the fingers of the left hand, it is but natural that the 
composer desires to obtain the greatest number of 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
tones possible without “shifting” the hand. This 
can be effected by repeating a given tone by means of 
the bow, or by playing tones that surround it. (See 
No. 39 at k).

The chords of four tones at a can readily be broken 
up into figures like those at b and c. The simple 
arpeggio at d becomes intensifiéd by the reiteration 
of its constituent tones as at e. When the Tannhduser 
Overture first appeared, many performers complained 
of the difficulty of the Violin figures that accompany 
the final appearance of the Pilgrims’ Chorus. But 
when they realized that the measures at f were only 
the scale passages at g amplified, and were strictly in 
the spirit of the instrument (violinméssig) this finale 
seemed less appalling.
-P-A-G-E-159
    THE VIOLIN FAMILY 149 
In this connection, attention may be called to the 
fact that these brilliant Violin figures are ineffective 
upon the Piano; therefore, Von Biilow, in his four 
hand Piano transcription frankly substitutes purely 
pianistic figures such as we see at h, with most satis- 
factory results. These pianistic arpeggios, it is 
needless to say, would be much more difficult if 
played on the Violin, while passages in “flat keys,” as 
at i, having no open strings, would be very clumsy, 
not to say impossible, for the violinist. 
VIOLA 
A convenient way of remembering the Viola and 
its character is to regard it as an instrument like the 
Violin, but with a compass a fifth lower (See cut on 
page 138) (hence its first and second 
strings are A and D while the third and 
fourth are G and C. The former two are = 
of plain gut, but the latter are wound with 
silver wire. As the mission of the Viola is to render       
the tenor part in a string quartet or a symphony, it 
is often called upon to play passages with a wide 
range. Compare the two notations of this passage 
from Elgar’s Variations. The first (a) jumps from 
clef to clef, the second (6) avoids this by the use of 
the alto clef.

Such jumping back and forth from one clef to the

other is very trying to the performer, so the alto clef, 
with middle C on the middle (3rd) line is employed 
when writing for the Viola, except in the very highest 
register when the composer resorts to the treble clef.

ral. f= 
  From this it is evident that the C clef is not used 
to make things more difficult. On the contrary, it is 
akindly aid. One clef is as easy to read as another, 
and if the student will but bear in mind that the 
sign on the C clef always indicates middle C, and not 
the C of the treble or bass clef, the matter will soon 
become clear. The alto clef must be thought of as 
middle C, with the two lower lines of é 
the G or treble clef, combined with the p= 
two upper lines of the F or bass clef. aa 
One of the chief functions of the Viola is providing 
a rich filling in of the middle parts. Between the 
upper and lower registers of the orchestra when the 
Viola moved in octaves with the Cello, there was 
often, in former times an unpleasant gap, but thanks 
to the efforts of Beethoven and Wagner, more atten- 
tion has been paid to this valuable orchestral factor. 
Although the tones of its upper strings are often 
lost among those of the Violins, the C string has such 
a penetrating quality that it is occasionally employed 
in passages where the melody is played upon the   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-161

resonant A string of the Cello. (See No. 41). But 
the upper string of the Viola can be made of service 
rendering a lyric theme with much expression, such 
as the Oriental cantabile in the Allegretto of the Suite 
Algérienne by Saint-Saéns, who at this point gives the 
middle parts to the Violins.

The technique of the Viola is in most respects like 
that of the Violin, and is frequently played by violin- 
ists. The chief difference results from the fact that 
the Viola being larger, the double stops require 
greater extension of the fingers and some of them are 
thus rendered rather troublesome. 
VIOLONCELLO 
The ’Cello is a much larger instrument than the 
Viola although its tuning is only an octave lower.

  The ’Cello possesses far greater individuality than 
the Viola; has a wider range, and the character of its’ 
registers are more highly differentiated. The A 
string has a passionate penetrating quality adapted to 
the expression of intense emotion. It is sometimes 
used for the soprano part, while the Viola takes the 
middle voice. See the well known passage from 
Tristan and Isolde, where the Violas are divided, be- 
ing reinforced by the Bassoons. The tones of the 
Double Basses as they sustain the Bb are clarified and 
strengthened by the fourth horn. The passage is a 
masterpiece of tonal color and balance of the voice 
parts.

All that has been said in reference to double stops, 
harmonics, tremolo, pizzicato, etc. in connection with 
the Violin holds true of the ’Cello, only it should be 
borne in mind that, owing to its greater size, certain 
intervals are more difficult to grasp. 
The pizzicato, especially in the middle register, is 
of great value. Without being obtrusive, it “carries” 
wonderfully well. (See also the pizzicato passage in 
No. 37). 
Dovste Bass 
The Double Bass (Contra Bass) is the largest and 
deepest toned instrument of the Violin family. Its 
general contour resembles that of the other members 
of this ‘group with the exception of its back which, 
instead of being arched, is flat, and is therefore re- 
garded by some as a survival of the Viol family.*

  It is tuned at the present day as» 
at a: and the no%es writen sound Zee 
an octave lower and are therefore of sixteen-foot 
pitch (see Chapter IV, p. 94). 
The upper limit is shown at 6, .but Wagner in 
Lohengrin (Finale Act I) takes them to the Bb above, 
and in later works still higher tones are demanded. 
The remarks on bowing, pizzicato, etc., in connec-

tion with the other members of the Violin family 
apply here also, excepting in respect to double notes 
which are rarely ever used, and then only when the 
lower one is an open string. 
The tone quality of the Double Bass is less clear 
cut and distinct than that of the "Cello, the very lowest 
tones being somewhat vague and indeterminate, but 
when the two are combined, playing either in unison 
or octaves, the result is a glorious sonority. 
Harmonics are also practicable upon the Double 
Bass although rarely applied. One of the most ex- 
tensive illustrations of the use of these Double Bass 
harmonics occurs in the Nile scene in Aida where 
Verdi calls for the tone two octaves above the open 
G string. 
This instrument, so valuable in ensemble and or- 
chestral music, is rarely employed in solos. “T recall 
a concert given by the Italian Bassist Botessini, whose 
execution was indeed extraordinary, but as he used a 
small specimen, and cultivated the higher registers, 
the tones suggested a Cello rather than a Contra-bass. 
The best known contra-bassist of today is doubtless 
Kussevitsky, whose great virtuosity has however been 
overshadowed by his achievements as a conductor. 
Less Known RELATIVES OF THE VIOLIN

Meyerbeer’s Huguenots. Its peculiarity consists in 
the series of parallel strings beneath the fingerboard 
that vibrate in sympathy when the outer strings are 
played. Its seven strings are tuned to produce the 
following tones: 
It is obvious that the composer can- 
  not stray far from the D-major triad 
if he hopes for sympathetic vibrations. 
In my student days I attended a concert of the 
celebrated Professor Hermann Ritter, who demon- 
strated the characteristics of his improved Viola, 
which was specially designed for use at the Bayreuth 
Festival of 1876. This Viola, tuned like that in our 
orchestras, was intended to remedy the weakness of 
this instrument. The Ritter Viola possessed indeed 
a strong tone, stronger than that of the old design, 
but its size was so increased that only men with long 
arms could master it, and it soon fell into disuse. 
In the collection of musical instruments in the for- 
mer Royal High School of Music in Berlin, was to be 
seen the Baryton that once belonged to Haydn. This 
instrument was one of the Violin family, and its 
range was between that of the Viola and the ’Cello, but 
in spite of its popularity in the eighteenth century, it 
is now practically unknown. 
Dynamics

family, a great command of all shadings from pp to 
ff is possible, which implies great emotional expres- 
siveness. This dynamic range and the facility of 
transition from one extreme to the other is scarcely 
equalled by any other type of instrument. When the 
entire string group give voice to an appealing theme, 
the effect is sometimes overwhelming. 
In referring to the Violin of Cremona as a perfect 
instrument, the term is not employed casually, but 
with a full realization of its import, for although 
many later instrument makers have labored conscien- 
tiously, and have sought to improve upon the old 
models, no vital betterments have been introduced, 
and the greatest claim that can be made in behalf 
of a given modern Violin is that it equals one of those 
fashioned by the old masters, which are ever in de- 
mand. 
The high valuation placed upon these ancient in- 
struments serves to emphasize the significance of the 
word “perfect,” which we know is an adjective ad- 
mitting of no comparison. When any feature or 
detail of a perfect work is altered or over-accented, 
a lack of proportion ensues, and it is no longer per- 
fect. This is true not only of a work of art, but also 
of a style of architecture, poetry or music. 
THE STRING QUARTET 
Seeing that the Violin family possess the gift of 
portamento, employing the delicate transitions from
-P-A-G-E-169
  THE VIOLIN FAMILY 159 
tone to tone which is possible to the human voice, 
many music lovers regard the string quartet as the 
ideal phase of abstract music. A discussion of this 
form belongs to the departments of Appreciation and 
History, but a word should be added at this point 
concerning the instrumental combination. There are 
two Violins, known as “First”” and “Second” playing 
respectively the soprano and alto parts. The Viola 
furnishes the tenor and the ’Cello provides the bass. 
The spirit of the ideal quartet is through and through 
democratic. True, at times the melody is given to a 
Violin, the Viola or the "Cello, while the others play 
subordinate parts, but the real essence of this type 
of work demands that each one shall have the right 
to discuss the various themes of the work. Note this 
- attractive theme of Beethoven at the opening of his 
F-major Quartet, Op. 18. At first all take it up in 
unison for four measures (No. 45, A) then the First 
Violin elaborates it while the others add the harmony.

“Will you play upon this pipe? .... Govern 
these ventiges with your fingers and thumb, give it 
breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most 
excellent music.”-—Shakespeare. 
N treating of the types under the above heading 
it may be said that they are, broadly speaking, 
divided into two general classes, the Wood-wind and 
the Brass-wind. Seeing that the primitive forms of 
the various families have been touched upon in 
Chapter II, we shall confine ourselves to those more 
highly developed specimens that have found a per- 
manent abiding place in the modern orchestra. 
Tt should be stated, however, at this point, that 
while the distinctive expressions “wood” ang ‘brass”” 
obviously referred originally to the material 66 which 
the various instruments were constructed, these terms 
became generic in the course of time, so that, at the 
present day we find members of the wood group 
(Flute, Piccolo, etc.) occasionally fashioned from 
silver and even gold. But this affects neither their 
tone quality not classification.

Tone CoLor IN THE ORCHESTRA 
Whereas the Orientals employ their Wind and Per- 
cussion instruments chiefly as a means of increasing 
the quantity of sound in their bands, we of the Oc- 
cident value such auxiliaries for more refined and 
aesthetic reasons. In listening to a conversation, ad- 
ditional interest is derived by observing the voices 
of the various speakers, each of which has an in- 
dividual character. In like manner the significance 
of a symphonic theme is enhanced when we hear 
it uttered now by the Violins, then by the Oboe, and 
again by Clarinet, Flute, Horn, etc., each factor being 
recognized not by the quantity but by the quality of 
its tones. 
The reason for the different tone qualities or 
tone colors which distinguish these instruments was 
vaguely apprehended over two centuries ago, but 
not until Helmholtz announced his theories was it 
known that they were due to the different combin- 
ations of the overtones accompanying the funda- 
mental.* Especially pronounced are the tone colors 
of the wind group. Hence when it is entrusted with 
a long movement, it is less enjoyable than a similar 
passage for strings, for the latter can be more readily , 
modified, not only in regard to dynamic shading 
but in tone quality.

THE Woop WInp 
In order to obtain an idea of the distinctive char- 
acteristics to be discussed, it will be necessary for 
the student to refer to the table of Wind Instruments 
given in Chapter II, p. 35. 
In group A “pipes with simple aperture,” in sub- 
division b, will be found those that are “blown trans- 
versely.” Among these will be observed the Euro- > 
pean representatives, Flauto traverso or Flute blown 
“cross wise” instead of straight out like the ancient 
Whistle Flute and Flageolet. 
In group B “Pipes with reeds,” the European type 
is the. Oboe. 
Since the Medieval Period a very valuable and 
distinguished family has been added to the orches- 
tral aristocracy. This consists of the Clarinet and 
its kindred which produce their tones by means of 
a single “beating”’ reed. 
THE FUNCTION Or THE Keys 
The Flute in common with all other members of 
the modern wood-wind group shows its kinship with 
the prototypical instruments of antiquity, inasmuch 
as it possesses the traditional series of holes that en- 
ables the performer # produce the diatonic scale. 
In order to obtain the sharps and flats (the tones 
that fill out the complete chromatic scale) other 
holes have been bored that are covered with pads 
controlled by keys.
-P-A-G-E-177
    WIND INSTRUMENTS 167 
oe 
The original Flute, Oboe, and English Horn gave 
the series of the D-major scale. Later other holes 
and keys were added giving lower tones. From the 
preceding we gain a general idea of how the scales 
are produced upon the modern wood-wind instru- 
ments and it will be well to bear in mind the follow- 
ing general principles: 
A. The holes stopped by the fingers give the 
diatonic scale. 
B. The keys are employed: (1) for the pro- 
duction of chromatic tones; (2) for the 
extension of the compass. 
2 Tue FLUTE Famity 
. (It. Flauto; Fr. Flute; Ger. Fléte.) 
By means of the keys just mentioned the Flute’s 
compass has been extended downward by the ad- 
dition of c#, and c and (rarely) 6. Then by means 
of the system of overblowing described previously 
(see p. 33) the performer has at command a range of 
some three octaves. (See No. 6, p. 33.) 
( Whereas the old Flutes in common with other wood- 
wind instruments suffered from the disadvantage 
arising from boring the holes to fit the fingers re- 
gardless of faulty intonation which this precedure 
implied, at present, thanks to the new system intro- 
duced by Theobald Boehm (1832), purity of tone 
and greater flexibility of execution have resulted.) 
The student will doubtless recall many Flute pas-

sages containing rapidly reiterated tones, scales, ar- 
peggios and wide leaps such as we find in Beethoven’s 
Overture to Leonore No. 3, Rossini’s William Tell 
Overture, etc.

    If we listen carefully to a performer slowly play- 
ing a scale throughout the entire compass of the 
Flute, we note that the tones of the lowest octave 
” those of the next octave are lyric sound “hollow, 
and clear, while the upper register is sharper, the 
highest tones being quite shrill. 
A pair of Flutes are often used with charming 
effect, as in the idyllic Danse Grecque quoted in the 
next chapter (p. 198). 
The possibilities of a Flute trio in a light and airy 
measure are shown in the Danse des Mirlitons from 
Tchaikovsky’s well known Nutcracker Suite.

THE Bass FLUTE 
(It. Flautone; Fr. Flute Alto; Ger. Alifléte.) 
For two centuries and more attempts have been 
made to extend the compass of the Flute family and 
bring it into line with the other wind groups, but the 
so-called Bass Flutes employed sporadically by Rim- 
sky-Korsakoff and others descends only to small g, f, . 
or possibly to c (below middle c), hence they have 
only the Alto or at most a Tenor register. Even 
these instruments require so much air that they fa- 
tigue the performer. The only bass tones with true 
Flute quality are those produced by the Organ, where 
the bellows supplies the air with ease. In this 
connection I venture to suggest, that, seeing the per- 
former upon wind instruments in certain European 
orchestras have been furnished with bellows to ease 
their labors in the long or fortissimo passages, it 
seems as though true Bass Flutes with a compass 
of the Bassoon might be made with such bellows 
attached. This would complete the Flute family in- 
deed,* although the low tones thus produced could 
never be as expressive as those of the Bass Clarinet 
or Horn. Efforts to extend the upper range of the

(lower) register it cannot be called a ‘family.’ ”

Flute were more successful and resulted in the Little 
Flute (Flauto Piccolo). 
( Tue PiccoLo 
(It. Flauto Piccolo or Ottavino; Fr. Petite Flute;

While the music written for this, the highest orches- 
tral instrument, looks like that for the Flute, it sounds 
an octave higher. Its_chi lue_is_ that_it-serves 
to supplement the Flute _and lends the penetrating 
tones of its highest register to the orchestral mass 
in ff. In such cases its aid is invaluable, witness 
the numerous dramatic scenes in Wagner’s works, 
Ride of the Valkyries, Magic Fire Scene, Overture to 
the Flying Dutchman, also the first movement in 
Tchaikovsky’s Symphonie Pathétique. Occasion- 
ally the soft tones of the Piccolo are fittingly ap- 
plied as in the third movement of the Symphony just 
mentioned, and in the curious bit from Rimsky-Kor- 
sakoff’s Coq d’Or given in the next chapter, p~:206. 
But valuable eae its upper tones, the lower ones are 
weak and often absurd, so are usually avoided.

THE OBOE FaMILy 
(Old Eng. Hautboy; It. Oboe; Fr. Hautbois; 
Ger. Oboe.) 
It will be remembered that the Oboe is an instru- 
ment with double reeds and is a lineal descendent of 
the Shawm (see p. 39). The compass of the modern 
Oboe for the average player is something over two 
octaves. The tones sound as written, always on the 
treble clef (see No. 48), but the instruments vary 
somewhat. Some years ago while I was in charge 
of the Yale Symphony Orchestra we gave one of 
' Dvorak’s Slavic Dances where three-lined a was de- 
manded,* and had to be transferred to the Flute. 
Visiting the composer in Prague not long after, I 
asked him about this high a. He replied that his 
oboist produced it with ease. With this in mind, I 
was surprised not long after, on rehearsing a number 
from my Ben Hur music in London to find that the 1st 
oboist, a good player, told me his instrument would 
yield nothing above three-lined c. 
The Oboe has an appealing tone in lyric minor 
strains, such as we hear in the slow movement of 
Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony. (See No. 48.)

(It. Corno Inglese; Fr. Cor Anglais;

Why the contralto of the Oboe family should 
be called “English Horn” is a question that no one 
can definitely answer. It is specifically a melodial 
instrument of a pastoral character tinged with tender- 
ness, we might say timidity. Its compass is practi- 
cally that of the Oboe and is often played by the znd 
oboist who, however, while playing the notes (on the

THE Bassoon 
(It. Fagotto; Fr. Basson; Ger. Fagott.) 
The Bassoon serves as_the-bass_of the Oboe family. 
Its tube, being so long that it has to be doubled on 
itself, makes it look something like a fagot, hence 
the name given it in Italy and Germany. It is the 
descendent of the old Pommer Bass, the masculine 
member of the Shawm family (see p. 40). It has 
a compass of three octaves from contra Bb to the 
one-lined bb. Its part is written usually on the bass 
clef though the upper octave is often placed on the 
tenor clef (middle c on the 4th line) and the tones 
sound as written. In other words, it is called a non- 
transposing instrument. 
There is a marked difference in the character of 
its various registers; the lowest is clumsy of enun- 
ciation and grotesque in tone, as in the opening meas- 
ures of the last number of Grieg’s Peer Gynt Suite.

  THE DouBLE Bassoon 
(It. Contrafagotto; Fr. Contre-Basson; | 
Ger. Kontrafagott.) 
This valuable instrument possesses a compass 
similar to that of the Bassoon, minus the lower tones. 
Music for it is written on the bass clef, and like the
-P-A-G-E-187
  WIND INSTRUMENTS 177 
Double Bass sounds an octave lower than written. 
Its upper octaves are rarely used, for its mission 
is to supply those deep organ-like tones which, for 
example, give such resonance to the theme of Haydn 
in the Variations, Op. 56, by Brahms, and also in 
the final movements of the latter’s C minor Sym- 
phony, Op. 68. Rapid passages are difficult to ex- 
ecute and I have been told by good players that 
“with all due respect to Beethoven, the runs he gives 
the Double Bassoon in his Ninth Symphony never 
come out well.” Its solemn tones seemed fitted to 
express the bewilderment of the Dodo in Alice’s Ad- 
ventures so I hazarded the experiment of giving this 
instrument a solo part. Henry Hadley in his Salomé, 
has derived some wind effects from a combination 
of Bass Clarinet with Double Bassoon. 
THE CLARINET FAMILY 
(It. Clarino or Clarinetto; Fr. Clarinette; 
Ger. Klarinette.) 
The ancestor of the Clarinet was of French origin 
and called the Chalumeau. It consisted of a cy- 
lindrical pipe with nine sound-holes, the tone being 
produced by means of a free-beating single reed. It 
will be remembered that the Oboe family all have 
double reeds. But this primitive pipe (the Chalu- 
meaw) could only produce those nine tones in addition
-P-A-G-E-188

to the fundamenial (sounded with all holes closed) 
for none could be produced by over-blowing, as in 
the case of Flute, Oboe, etc. At length, about 1700, 
a Nuremberg inventor devised what the English call 
a “speaker key’ which enabled one to produce a 
similar series to the row of fundamentals by over- 
blowing. He also added a bell which improved the 
tone. But singularly enough the resulting tones were 
not an octave above the fundamental but a 12th. The 
reason for this is because conical tubes (Flutes, 
Oboes, etc.) overblow most readily in the octave or 
2nd tone of the Harmonic series while instruments 
with cylindrical tubes never can give any but the 
uneven tones of the series (the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th). 
It will be seen from the above, that there was still a 
gap of a minor third between the upper tone of the 
original series and the lowest of the second series. 
To fill this space, holes with keys were added. The 
compass was also extended below in the same manner, 
which explains why the Clarinet requires more keys 
than the Oboe and is much longer, 
The newly acquired register resembled the sound 
of the Trumpet (It. Clarino) and was called Clarinetto 
(small Trumpet) which name it still retains while the 
ancestral title is also perpetuated in the designation 
of its lowest register, Chalumeau (Ger. Schalmei). 
The Clarinet has two other registers, the middle 
and the highest. The middle lies in the “break” (as
-P-A-G-E-189
    WIND INSTRUMENTS 179 
in some voices) between the lowest and the highest 
and is weak and dull: The highest is rarely called 
upon except in forte passages. That the middle reg- 
ister may be touched softly without injuring a phrase, 
may be seen in the lovely theme of Briinnhilde’s 
wifely devotion from the first act of the Gétterdém- 
merung (No. 55).

TRANSPOSITION 
  It is obvious that where the mechanism is so com-— 
plex, the nearer one keeps to the typical key C-major 
(A-minor) the easier is the execution. For this 
reason the Clarinets have been constructed in a var- 
iety of keys. Thus a Clarinet in Bb will give the 
tones of that scale, while the performer applies the 
fingering of the C scale. A Clarinet in A will give 
the A series when the C scale is played. This in- 
volves transposition again, therefore when employing 
the Bb instrument which puts all written notes a tone 
lower we have to write a given passage a tone higher 
to balance matters. For an A Clarinet which throws 
everything a minor third lower we write a minor third 
higher. These are the types most in ‘use; especially 
favored is that in Bb. 
Doubtless this may seem complex to the uninitiated 
but the reading of any orchestral score is impossible 
without mastering this problem of transposition. The 
following cut (No. 54a) illustrates the subject and 
shows that the Clarinet in A is far better adapted to 
the rendering of the opening phrase of the Tann-
-P-A-G-E-191
  WIND INSTRUMENTS 181 
hduser Overture than the Clarinet in Bb, which must 
employ so many tones foreign to C, the typical key. 
It also shows that the 64 for the Piano must be written 
as g for the E Horn, d for the A Clarinet, and c# for 
the Bb Clarinet.*

Clarinets in D and Eb sounding respectively a

whole tone or a minor third lower to create the bal- 
ance.

*A California friend told of a mountaineer whose clock was a riddle 
to the neighbors. He said, however, that it kept good time for he was 
certain that when the hands pointed to half-past three and the clock 
struck five, it was a quarter to six. In like manner the note C 
sounded on the A Clarinet is the same as F on the E Horn; and Gt 
on the Piano is the same as A# on the Bb Clarinet and B on the 
Clarinet in A. (No. 54a shows this.)

deep wood-wind instruments, is like that of the Clar- 
inet in Bb or A with its upper register shortened. Its 
notation is the same as for the ordinary Clarinet, 
sounding an octave lower than that instrument. Wag- 
ner, it is true, when writing for it employed the bass 
clef, the notes sounding a whole tone, or a minor third 
lower, according to the instrument employed, Bb or A. 
It is capable of great dramatic expression and can 
utter its lowest tones with such delicacy as to be al- 
most inaudible. For the reason that it is difficult for 
the Bassoon to give a Piano in this register, the pian- 
issimo cadenza assigned it in the first movement of 
Tchaikovsky’s Symphonie Pathétique is always trans- 
ferred to the Bass Clarinet. Note its employment 
in No. 55. 
THE Brass-WinD 
The student is asked to refer once more to the table 
given in Chapter II under division C and among the 
instruments with cup mouthpieces he will find the 
Horns and Trumpets described as “simple tubes with- 
out apertures.” Such tones as these instruments 
could yield, were found to be the series of the Nature 
Scale or Harmonic Series only (see p. 47).

When the Horns were first employed in the oper-

atic orchestra, they were regarded doubtless as justi- 
fiable “local color,” as are. the Trumpets, Harps, 
Bells, etc. on the stage at the present day, adding a 
touch of realism. One is led to this belief when he 
reads that the following “Hallali” or hunting signal 
N258. Hunting Signal, from Tom Jones (1764) F.A.D. PHILIDOR sin D a

was introduced by the French composer Philidor in 
his opera Tom Jones in 1764 (a few years after the 
appearance of the novel of that name) and that the 
same motive was later used by Grétry and by Haydn 
in The Seasons. Although some of the auditors re- 
garded these noisy factors as barbarous, the public 
gradually became reconciled and they obtained a 
regular position in the orchestra of the opera, sym-   phony and oratorio. 
But stereotyped Horn formulas with but two 
chords, tonic and dominant, were found to be mo- 
notonous when unenriched by other rhythmic and 
harmonic devices. So performers and inventors 
sought to increase the tone vocabulary of the Horn 
and Trumpet group. 
Horn Crooks 
The limited number of tones producible upon 
the ancient and medieval Horns necessitated some 
means of varying the pitch when the key of a piece 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  184 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
was changed. This was effected by inserting in the 
main tube of the Horn, smaller tubes called Crooks. 
These crooks so lengthened or shortened the main 
tube that the pitch was lowered or raised to any 
desired key. Hence we find constant allusions to 
Horns in C, Horns in F, Horns in Bb, Eb, G, etc. As 
the only means of producing the various tones of the 
Nature series was by overblowing or by modifying 
the pitch with the hand, the performer always played 
the same notes although they sounded in different 
tonalities. Here again we come upon the necessity 
of transposition. But players and conductors soon 
became accustomed to a given routine.* 
Sroprep Tones 
It has been shown on page 47 that the 7th, 11th, 
13th and 14th tones of the harmonic series did not 
coincide with any in the tempered scale. In order 
to make these unruly members of the series bearable, 
a means of modifying them was applied called “stop- 
ping.” This consisted in thrusting the player’s hand 
into the bell of his instrument lowering the pitch so 
that in the scale on page 47 the 7th (just too low for Bb) 
became a very good A, the 11th (too low for an F2) 
became a good F4, etc. However, these stopped tones 
were never so bright and brilliant as the natural open 
*Some years ago I saw the score of Max von Schillings’ Moloch 
wherein every instrument was written as it sounded but instead of 
being easier to read, such is habit, the effort was quite puzzling.

tones, but by blowing forte, while generating these 
stopped tones, a new and strikingly dramatic effect 
was obtained. 
When in the third act of Tannhduser the hero is 
seen returning from his fruitless pilgrimage to Rome, 
the motive of the Pope’s curse is heard given by 
stopped Horns with insistent vehemence.

This device has been applied to other instruments. 
Wagner employs a stopped Trumpet in the third act 
of Die Meistersinger to imitate the little trumpets of 
the toy makers. In this case the stopping is not pro- 
duced through the agency of the hand, but by insert- 
ing in the bell of the Trumpet a pear-shaped mute. 
When planning the music to Macbeth, 1 sought 
some legitimate means of suggesting the blare of the 
ancient Scottish War Horns, and tried the experiment 
of thus stopping or muting the Trombones, which 
were played ff. Since then I have noticed that 
Strauss, and others place mutes on all brass instru- 
ments. At the present day this device is much 
abused. In a conversation with Reginald DeKoven 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  186 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
on the subject he remarked that “Many composers 
seem to apply the rule ‘When in doubt, use stopped 
horns.’ ” 
Tue Mystery oF THE CHRomatic Horns 
(It. Corno Ventile; Fr. Cor-a-pistons ; 
Ger. Ventilhorn.) 
The thoughful amateur after listening to the 
flourishes of a modern cornetist takes up the instru- 
ment and contemplates it with a certain amount of 
awe, and wonders how all the diatonic and chromatic 
passages can be produced with the aid of only three 
keys. 
It was shown in a former chapter how upon the 
simple natural Trumpet or Horn by means of the 
systems known as overblowing, the tones of the Na- 
ture series could be elicited (see page 48). Many 
were the attempts to extend the range and widen the 
scope of these instruments, in order to furnish the 
upper octaves of the brass group, for, which the 
Trombones had already provided so rich a vocab- 
ulary. The most successful of these experiments 
culminated in the Zincke family. But these instru- 
ments proved too severe a strain upon the lungs of 
the performers and were gradually abandoned. It 
was not until early in the nineteenth century that the 
much desired chromatic Trumpet and Horn were 
perfected.  
-P-A-G-E-197
  
  WIND INSTRUMENTS 187 
One of the earliest attempts in this direction con- 
sisted in a cluster of tubes, so grouped that they 
could be blown through a single mouthpiece and, 
by means of keys, the wind could be directed through 
any given tube at pleasure. As each tube repre- 
sented a Horn in a different tonality, the various tones 
of the chromatic scale were produced.* 
But a great improvement was soon afterwards de- 
vised. This consisted in connecting the tube of a 
Horn with three smaller lengthening tubes, each cf 
which was controlled by a valve and key and by this 
means the performer obtained over three octaves of 
chromatic tones.

Thus although many improvements to insure 
purity of intonation were necessary, this remarkable 
achievement not only revolutionized Horn playing, 
but the principles of the valve were applied to the 
Trumpet and even to the bass brass instrument known 
as the Tuba. 
It is interesting to observe how even with all the 
chromatic series at command Wagner and other mod- 
ern writers give the Horns new and beautiful themes, 
which, however, follow the outlines of the old for- 
mula. Such a theme is that which accompanies the 
re-entrance of the Love Goddess Freia in Rheingold, 
Scene IV.

THE VALVE TRUMPET 
(It. Tromba ventile; Fr. Trompette-d-pistons,

An easy way of visualizing the compass of the 
Valve Trumpet, is to think of it as being an octave 
higher than the Valve Horn in F. It produces, like 
that instrument, all the tones of the chromatic scale. 
Here, too, the influence of the old formula may be 
seen even in the original and striking themes of Wag- 
ner’s Nibelungen Trilogy.

  Tue CorneEt-A-PIston 
As the tube of the Cornet is half the length re- 
quired by the Trumpet, its tones are an octave higher. 
For this reason the higher tones of the harmonic 
series are more easily produced upon the Cornet 
than by means of the Trumpet. The tones of the 
former are far less noble than those of the latter but 
its flexibility has made it popular and it is of great 
value in the military bands. While it should not be 
used to replace the Trumpet in the symphony and 
opera, the Cornet is sometimes used simultaneously  
-P-A-G-E-200

with Trumpets in serious works of the French and 
Russian composers, see Berlioz, Harold in Italy and 
Tchaikovsky’s Overture, 1812. 
Tue TROMBONE 
(It. Trombone; Fr. Trombone; Ger. Posaune) 
This noble instrument whose relationship to the 
Sackbut has been shown in Chapter II was the only 
brass instrument capable of producing all the tones 
of the chromatic scale. But the classical composers 
‘rarely took advantage of this fact, and not until Schu- 
bert’s time were its manifold possibilities exploited. 
In the traditional employment of the Trombone in 
a group of three (two tenor and one bass), the former 
are written on the tenor, the latter on the bass clef, 
though for convenience they are sometimes combined 
on one or the other, according to the register re- 
quired. 
The Trombone has a vast dynamic range from the 
pianissimo in the scene where Siegfried climbs the 
rocks to find Briinnhilde to the glorious fortissimo 
outburst (combined with Trumpets) when Tann- 
hauser tells of the pardoning of sinners by the Pope.

The soft wood-wind includes the Flute and Clarinet

legislators ought to give the greatest encourage-

“Music was regarded by the ancients as a refined 
art, although it has since become a commerce.” 
—Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy. 
HE performer upon his chosen instrument finds 
his pleasure increased when he can share it with 
others, and if competent companions join in the mu- 
sic-making this delight is still further enhanced. The 
social element is ever a strong factor in promoting 
the joys of feasting and dancing. It also intensi- 
fies the solemnity of funeral and other religious 
rites. If then the tones of Pipe and Tabor, Harp 
and Psaltery be added, the participants experience 
an exhilaration transporting them far beyond the 
affairs of everyday life. In this exalted realm we 
find the fountainhead of Art.

ORCHESTRAL HOMOGENEITY 
The bands one hears in the Chinese theatres are 
chiefly noted for the din they create, the soft tones 
of Flutes and strings being drowned by the brass and 
percussion. This predominance of the noisier mem- 
bers was also noticeable in European orchestras when 
Trumpets and Horns were first introduced. In order \ 
to create a balance of power between the orchestral 
groups it was found necessary to resort to “doubling” 
or rather multiplying the number of performers i 
the string group. The proper proportion of strings 
to wind instruments according to Gevaert is three of 
the former to one of the latter. Thus in an orchestra 
adapted to the Mozart symphonies there should be
-P-A-G-E-210
200 : MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
  thirty strings, divided thus: 8 First Violins, 8 Second 
Violins, 5 Violas, 5 ’Cellos, 4 Basses. This should 
balance 2 Flutes, 2 Oboes, 2 Bassoons, 2 Horns, 2 
Trumpets. A Beethoven symphony would require 
an addition of 2 clarinets, 2 extra Horns and Kettle 
Drums with 12 more strings, 57 to 60 in all. 
Since the time of Meyerbeer, Berlioz and Wagner, 
the brass group has so grown in importance that to 
give their works with well proportioned forces an 
orchestra of from 90 to 110 is requisite.* 
This general average is sought even in the “Mon- 
ster Concerts” where orchestras of two or more hun- 
dred are involved. Even in the great International 
Peace Jubilee at Boston in June 1872, when there were 
2,000 in the orchestra and 20,000 in the chorus, the 
above mentioned proportions were approximately at- 
tained by Mr. P. S. Gilmore, the conductor. 
PosITION OF THE PERFORMERS 
In seating the musicians of the orchestra the ideal 
sought to give those with the lesser tone an oppor- 
tunity to be heard to the best advantage. Thus it is 
that the Violins are placed in the front, the Violas 
and "Cellos immediately back of them, then the 
~.*This doubling of the strings is not always thoroughly grasped by the 
layman. The writer was once told by an ardent patron of a Western 
symphony society, that their conductor performed on all the instru- 
ments in the orchestra. “Think of that” said the enthusiast, “he plays 
seventy-five instruments—seventy-five instruments!”

THE ConpUCTOR 
To enable a group of singers or performers to 
keep together, it was early found necessary to indi- 
cate the accented notes. This usually took the form 
‘of beating time, a practice known among savage 
tribes as well as among more cultured people of an- 
tiquity. 
At the present day this function is entrusted to the 
conductor who usually stands in front of the per- 
formers with his back to the audience holding in his 
hand the all important baton with which he gives 
his signals. Upon his shoulders rests the responsi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-212

bility, not only of enforcing a unanimity of execution 
but it is also his duty to carry out the intentions of 
the composer. Sometimes he is obliged to make cer- 
tain alterations in order that the effect desired by the 
composer may be obtained. 
Since the invention of Valve-Horns and Trumpets 
it has become possible to render upon those instru- 
ments passages which earlier composers would have 
most earnestly wished performed on Horns or Trum- 
pets, but because of the limitations of the old instru- 
ments they were forced to use the less effective wood- 
wind. In such cases both composer and the listener 
are benefited. On the other hand, the conductor can 
do much damage not only through unjustified alter- 
ations of the score, but by means of exaggerating the 
tempo or the dynamics so that the composer’s inten- 
tions are wholly distorted. ? 
As mentioned in the first volume of this Course 
of Study,* the interpretation lies chiefly with the 
conductor who can make or break the work in ques- 
tion. In listening to the Tchaikovsky Symphonie 
Pathétique (referred to in this passage) conducted 
by a rival composer, it was obvious that he was not 
interested, neither was his audience, as he rendered 
it; whereas later under a sympathetic leader it pro- 
duced a marvelous impression. 
Again, the impressive opening measures of

 Brahms’s C Minor Symphony, where the steady 
strokes of the Kettle Drums given in the proper tempo 
seem like the strides of a giant after a given goal, are 
sometimes performed in such increased speed that 
they suggest the mincing gait of an affected spinster. 
Some composers dread listening to their own 
works, anticipating unpleasant alterations. Mac- 
Dowell once told us that he never went to hear any 
of his compositions for they were rarely done in the 
way he conceived them.

INSTRUMENTS OUTSIDE THE SYMPHONIC GrouP 
While the two preceding chapters have been chiefly 
devoted to the instruments peculiar to the syniphony 
orchestra with brief mention of those heard in certain 
operas, we must not ignore altogether that class oc- 
casionally introduced for special efforts and desig- 
nated by Rimsky-Korsakoff as the “ornamental in- 
struments.” 
In this category we must place those stringed in- 
struments described in Chapter III, the Harp, Lute, 
Mandolin and Guitar. To these must be added the 
non-symphonic percussion (a) with definite pitch, 
Glockenspiel and other bell imitating devices, then 
the Celesta and Xylophone and finally (6) those 
agents producing indefinite pitch, the various Drums, 
Cymbals, Triangles, etc.
-P-A-G-E-214

Tue Harp 
This ancient instrument now has a compass of ov 
octaves (See Chapter III). During the last century 
and more it has received very material improvements, 
the most vital being 
the system of pedals 
introduced by Erard, 
the Parisian Piano- 
forte and Harp man- 
ufacturer, about 1802. 
By means of this 
system the  instru- 
ment may be ad- 
justed so that it gives 
the tones of any scale. 
Thus, when in_ its 
normal position, its 
strings yield the 
series of the diatonic 
scale of Cb major. 
There is a pedal for 
each of the seven 
tones, and each pedal 
is provided with two 
notches enabling the 
performer to raise   
        Modern Pedal Harp 
any given tone a half or a whole tone. For instance, 
the C pedal raised to the first notch changes all of the 
,
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE MODERN ORCHESTRA 205 
C flats to C naturals. If it be raised to the second 
notch all these C naturals are transformed into C 
sharps. The typical Harp figures are such as we term 
in Piano music arpeggios (It. arpa—Harp). 
In spite of these modernizations it has lost nothing 
of its superterrestrial character which is nowhere 
more significantly shown than by Wagner in Lohen- 
grin. One of the many familiar instances that might 
be cited is where Elsa in the opening scene relates her 
vision of the Knight who shall come to prove her in- 
nocent in the impending trial.

  Not only is the Harp a valuable accessory when 
used as above, and in kindred arpeggio figures, but - 
when treated as one of a tone group it assists in pro- 
ducing special efforts. Its prickly upper tones com- 
bine with the delicate staccato of Piccolo and Celesta 
are employed by Rimsky-Korsakoff to suggest the an- 
gular gestures of the quaint old Astrologer passing 
across the stage in front of the curtain in the Prelude 
to Cog d Or.

THE LUTE 
Like the Mandolin and Guitar which lend local 
color to scenes in the Operas of Italian and other 
composers the Lute has been introduced by Wagner 
with marvelous effect in Die Meistersinger. Not 
merely because of its peculiar tones that accompany 
the Serenade of the self-satisfied Beckmesser (which 
sometimes degenerates into burlesque), but the un- 
promising formula afforded by the tuning of the Lute 
with its parallel 4ths, was elaborated by Wagner 
into one of the most remarkable fugues ever con- 
ceived.* The workmanship is all the more note- 
worthy as it grows along with the action on the stage. 
BELLS 
Bells, too, at their best as already suggested pos- 
*The technical term for this number is Fugue with Chorale, the 
Serenade of Beckmesser being used line by line after Bach’s manner 
in his choral fugues.

sess a rare spiritual nature. “Tis the semblance of 
dimly remembered bell tones calling a prayer that 
first invites the. erring Tannhauser to return from a 
voluptuous existence to a life of devotion to high 
ideals. 
Observe the beautiful downward progression of 
every changing harmony that give variety to the 
otherwise monotonous repetition of the tone FE and B. 
Those familiar with the Opera will realize the artis- 
tic refinement shown by Wagner in merely suggesting 
these bells with the delicate Flute and Oboe tones, 
instead of using the Glockenspiel or some similar 
device. Again how valuable is this restraint when 
we hear in the very next scene the tinkling of genuine 
sheepbells emphasizing the reality of the world to 
which Tannhauser has returned. 
Small bells have been used with excellent success 
in Fra Diavolo, Lakmé and other operas. But when 
it comes to imitating the thunderous peals of the bells 
of church or monastery—that is a problem. As an 
instance, the deep bass-tones demanded by Wagner 
for Parsifal have long troubled stage managers, and 
various experiments have been tried in order to ob- 
tain the desired results. 
THE GLOCKENSPIEL 
The Glockenspiel or “Bell-play” is a series of steel 
bars arranged like the keyboard of the Pianoforte  
-P-A-G-E-218
  208 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
and struck with metallic hammers, one held in each 
hand of the performer. The tone is piquant and 
when employed at the proper moment is charming 
and even exhilarating. Wagner has introduced it 
with a skill as refined as it is reserved. It gives em- 
phasis to the tones of the Toy Trumpet effect in ex- 
cerpt No. 38, p. 146, while in the Magic Fire Scene 
No. 74, p. 223, it mingles finely with the flickering of 
the flames simulated by Violins and Wood-wind. 
THE XYLOPHONE 
  This factor described in Chapter I, page 24, al- 
though long known in European as well as in uncivi- 
lized countries, first came into prominence in 1876, 
through its introduction by Saint-Saéns in his re- 
markably vivid symphonic poem Danse Macabre. 
The startling suggestion of the rattling of skeleton 
bones shocked many, but the work has held its own, 
not because of its bizarre effect but by virtue of the 
originality of its themes, harmonies, contrapuntal de- 
vices and orchestration.

  Tue Non-syMPHONIC PERCUSSION 
It is indeed deplorable that the instruments falling 
under the caption “Percussion” should be regarded 
by the unthinking as the rag-tag and bobtail of our 
orchestral forces. True, the sensationalism of our 
vaudeville and theatrical bands with their Pop-guns, 
Sleigh Bells, Crickets, Kazoos, Sandpaper, Glissando- 
Whistles and other noise generators may lead the lay- 
man to regard musical art as a joke and orchestra-  
-P-A-G-E-220

tion a farce. Unfortunately composers of high rank 
have sometimes paid little attention to the expression 
marks in the parts for the worthy Kettle Drums. 
This scant courtesy has led to a carelessness on the 
part of many conductors who permit these classical 
percussionists to drown with their fortissimos the 
tones of the strings, the wood, the brass, indeed the 
entire orchestra, leaving the audience in doubt as 
to the composer’s intentions. But, on the other hand, 
some of the wittiest, most delicate and refined effects 
have been produced by an unusual application of 
this much abused class of instruments, not only in 
such lovely bits as (No. 66) but in scenes from 
Fidelio and Der Freischiitz. 
Drums Wit INDEFINITE TONE 
These instruments having been touched upon in 
Chapter II, a few words may be added to their pres- 
ent day employment. The great or Bass Drum, as 
it is popularly termed, is not always used for its 
noise, as in the storm in the William Tell Overture 
or for heavy accents in marches and the like, but 
when used pianissimo it suggests the mystery of the 
Orient,—as in the entrance of the Mikado in Sulli- 
van’s Opera of that name. 
The side or Snare Drum is so inevitably connected 
with the Fife or with Brass and Military Bands
-P-A-G-E-221
  THE MODERN ORCHESTRA 211 
that one rarely thinks of its finer possibilities. And 
yet Wagner has used it with thrilling effect in the 
great Chorus of Nobles in Act II of Die Gétterdém- 
merung, where its roll from pp to ff accompanies the 
cries of devotion to King Gunther. 
  
      
1. Kettle Drum 2. Snare Drum 3. Bass Drum (Showing their relative sizes) 
The smaller Hand Drum, Tambourine or the sim- 
ilar Tambour de Basque, is used in three different 
ways (1) struck with the knuckles on the parchment, 
(2) shaken so that the little jingles rattle, (3) rubbed 
across the parchment with the moistened finger or 
thumb, producing a delicate trilling of the jingles. 
The last method is that employed in the lovely Danse 
Arabe in Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite. 
THE CYMBALS 
These also have been mentioned in Chapter II. 
They are in the minds of many, perhaps most of us,
-P-A-G-E-222
  212 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
linked in partnership with the Bass Drum in Circus 
and some Military Bands. However, when treated 
independently they are capable of a variety of dy- 
namic effects; (1) by clashing them together,* (2) 
by striking one of them with a Kettle Drum stick 
(see the Ride of the Valkyries), (3) by performing 
a roll on a suspended Cymbal with two*of these 
drumsticks. This is the means adopted by Wagner 
in Scene III of Das Rheingold swelling from pp to 
ff suggesting Alberich’s lust for gold. Be it remarked 
in this connection that without the rich harmonies in 
the Brass, etc. this effect would be nothing but brutal 
noise, whereas the combination is gorgeous. 
Tue Gonc 
The Gong has been so long associated, with the call 
to dinner in American country hotels or on steamers 
at sea, that it is difficult for some readers to consider 
it seriously. And yet it is worthy of respect, for in 
_ the Orient it has for many centuries been used in re- 
ligious services and state ceremonies. It is called 
by the French Tam Tam7 and was first introduced as 
*The old English name for them was Clash-Pans—Ger. Becken or 
Basins, Gr. Kymbelon or Kymbalos. 
jAuthorities differ concerning the derivation of Tam Tam. Some will 
have it from the Sanskrit tum-tum; others from the Malayalem Tam- 
mittam, but it would seem from the very sound to explain itself, being 
as essentially onometapoetic as the child’s choo-choo for locomotive. 
In this connection, attention may be called to other sound-simulating 
words which suggest certain instruments, such as Gong, Drum, Rattle, 
Cricket and Schnarre, or Snare.

an orchestral’ instrument by the Parisian composer 
Gossec in a funeral march played at the obsequies 
of Mirabeau, April 1791, when it made a deep im- 
pression. A few years later it was heard in the 
operas of Spontini, Meyerbeer and others, while more 
recently, even in a symphony its sombre tones have 
deepened the gloom of a tragic mood as in Tchai- 
kovsky’s Pathétique.* 
TRIANGLE, CASTAGNETS AND CRICKET 
These too have been adequately described in Chap- 
ter I, where the incessant beating of the Triangle 
was cited as peculiar to Turkish Military Music. 
But this monotonous use of any percussion instru- 
ment is not in keeping with the ideals of the great 
composers who have found it wise to employ these 
high lights of musical emphasis with cautious econ- 
omy. Wagner even in such exuberant outbursts as 
we hear in the Magic Fire Music (See No. 74) added 
the metallic tints of Triangle and Glockenspiel to his 
tone painting, but each only in a very few measures. 
In keeping with this economy is the sparing employ- 
*The Xylophone is fittingly described by the French clacque bois, 
while the German Dudel-sack aptly hit off the idiom of the Bagpipe. 
Some of the words invented by the more primitive peoples are 
quaintly effective. Thus the sacred Trumpet of the Orinocos is 
naively figured in Bo-tu-tu, while the Aztecs suggested their little 
Bells in the delicate Tzillinils. This last reminds one of the tintin- 
nabulum of the Romans, whence came Edgar Poe’s “tintinnabulation 
that so musically wells,” in the poem that tellingly demonstrates the 
resounding qualities of the vocable “bell.”

ment (20 odd measures) of Xylophone which im- 
part its weird coloring to the entire Danse Macabre 
by Saint-Saéns. 
The Castagnets are naturally of special value in 
Spanish scenes and among such nothing is more strik- 
ing than the song and dance of Carmen in Act II of 
the opera of that name. This number shows also 
what a genius can do with meagre material. The 
second verse of her song is accompanied by the notes | 
of the approaching buglers in search of Don Jose. — 
Nothing but these natural Bugle tones, the Castagnets 
and Strings figure in this number and yet how ro- 
mantic and complete. 
The employment of the Cricket in Haydn’s Chil- 
dren’s Symphony like his use of the Bass Drum in 
his Military Symphony commands a certain degree 
of respect as local color. * 
THE ORCHESTRAL SCORE 
In order that the conductor might definitely know 
what was required of each instrument at any given 
moment, it was found necessary to place the various 
parts in regular order, one above the other, so that 
the notes at each beat of the measure should appear 
in perfect “alignment.” This arrangement of the 
parts (called partition by the French, de’s Partitur by 
‘the Germans) was known in the 16th century, a cele-

brated instance being Monteverde’s Orfeo 1608.* But 
it was a long time before there was any definite sys- 
tem followed in the arrangement of the instruments 
in a score. Indeed, at the present day scoring is 
not absolutely stabilized, but in the main the models 
afforded by the works of Wagner and Tchaikovsky 
are followed, and the various instrumental parts are 
usually arranged in the order shown in the quota- 
tion from the score of the Prelude to Die Meister- 
singer, page 215. You will notice that the Wood-wind 
is placed on the top of the score. Immediately below 
is the Brass section, beneath them the Percussion in- 
struments, and the Harp or Piano if these are em- 
ployed, while the String choir or section is at the foot 
of the score. 
To give an idea of what chaos reigned prior to 
Beethoven’s later period a series of the first six of 
Mozart’s symphonies as given in Breitkopf and Haer- 
tel’s edition is shown in the following table, which 
lists the instruments as they appear in the scores, 
reading from top to bottom. 
*A curious feature of the ancient scores was the staff with figures 
denoting the harmonies to be filled in by the performer on the Harpsi- 
chord or Organ. Often this was the duty of the director himself and 
it may well be believed that the elaborations (improvisations) of Bach 
and Handel were wonderful to hear. These figured basses inasmuch 
as they continue or go through the entire piece show the origin of the 
terms basso continuo or thorough bass.

Obviously Mozart wrote for such instruments as 
were at his disposal. Sometimes he had but one 
Flute and again he had two. He was so pleased with 
the recently introduced Clarine!s that he sometimes 
substituted them for the Oboes in his symphonies, 
their softer tones blending more readily with the 
small body of strings in his orchestra. In his operas 
Magic Flute and Don Juan Mozart employed both

Clarinets and Flutes but not until Beethoven’s régime 
did each type find a regular place in the symphony. 
OrcHEsTRAL ANTIPHONY 
The singing of the ancients was chiefly in unison 
or in octaves. Variety was imparted to the music 
of the Hebrews, Greeks and Romans by dividing 
the mass of singers into two groups which sang al- 
ternately, one group answering the other. ‘This 
form of antiphonal singing is known to have been em- 
ployed in rendering the Psalms of David and was 
later continued in the Christian Church.” Herbert 
Spencer suggests that one of the choirs may by acci- 
dent have begun before the other had finished and 
this may have led to experiments in polyphonic sing- 
ing and ultimately developed in the fugue. 
After the wind division of the orchestra had 
evolved sufficiently to hold its own against the 
strings this antiphonal method was applied. Nota- 
ble instances are to be found in the symphonies of 
Beethoven, as in the first movement of the 5th and 
8th, the Scherzo of the 7th, etc. 
Especially since the finer expressiveness of the 
modern Wood-wind has developed, this group, aided 
by the Horns, is made to answer the statement of the 
Strings and vice versa. Siriking illustrations are to 
be found in the Prelude to Tristan and Isolde also in 
the later symphonies by Tchaikovsky. Perhaps no
-P-A-G-E-229

THE MODERN ORCHESTRA 219 
one has applied this antiphony in so remarkable a 
manner as in the Scherzo of his F minor Symphony, 
where the strings, all in pizzicato, play the entire 
main theme, the brass alone have the second theme 
alternating with the wood, followed by the repetition 
of the principal theme by the strings—while at the 
close all the motives are charmingly intermingled. 
It seemed appropriate to the author in suggesting 
the bewilderment of Alice, on entering the “Forest 
of Forgetfulness” to give each successive chord of 
the two-measure phrase to the Flutes, Oboes, Clar- 
inets and Bassoons respectively.

It was shown in Chapter II how Wagner in Lohen- 
grin and all his later operas, excepting Die Meister- 
singer, employed threefold groups of wind instru- 
ments instead of the customary pairs in order to 
obtain complete triads in each tone color. The in- 
creased richness of tone volume and the new combin- 
ations in tone color this innovation made possible 
has led to the general adoption of the threefold sys- 
tem by modern composers, who frequently use 3 
Flutes, 3 Oboes, 3 Clarinets, 3 Bassoons, 3 Trumpets 
and 3 Trombones. 
INFLUENCE OF THE IMPROVED INSTRUMENTS 
We have seen how both Trumpets and Horns were 
introduced, cautiously in the opera, merely as local 
color, and how, through the steady improvements 
in those instruments, they became orchestral voices 
of inestimable value. Wagner, above all, was in-

nified participation in the orchestral conversation. 
Witness how eloquently the Horns emphasize ‘the 
pathetic theme of the Love Potion in the Prelude to 
Tristan and Isolde and how the climax is reached 
when the same theme like a cry of despair, is uttered 
by Trumpets and Trombones. Such harmonies and 
such orchestration would have been impossible fifty 
years previous when, as before mentioned, both 
Trumpets and Horns were in their medieval cultural 
condition. And yet, singular as it may seem, many 
noted composers such as Mendelssohn and Brahms, 
still continued to use Trumpets and Horns without 
valves, in spite of the significant precedents of Schu- 
mann and Wagner which led to such ideal results.* 
Thus Brahms, in his C Minor Symphony written some 
ten years after Tristan and Isolde, employs medieval 
Horns and in the last movement arranges a pause of 
35 measures to enable the 3rd and 4th Horn (in E) to 
change their crooks so as to play in the key of Fb, 
and later on they are given another pause of 21 meas- 
ures to help them change to the key of F, after the 
manner of Beethoven in his Eroica Symphony writ- 
ten in 1803-4. Not only did these later writers cramp 
themselves harmonically by clinging to the old for- 
*The scholarly Gevaert in his Traite d’Orchestration aptly comments 
on this procedure as follows: “When a composer disregards the im- 
provements in the instruments which characterize his epoch, he 
resembles the general who persists in employing the cannon and 
other weapons of war belonging to a former period.”  
-P-A-G-E-232

mulas, but many of their themes bear the ear-marks 
of ultra-classicism.* 
ImpROVED INSTRUMENTS 
The Chromatic Brass also, revolutionized many 
other phases of orchestration, whereas in the time 
of Bach, Haydn and Mozart, composers writing mel- 
odic passages for Horn were confined to the strident 
upper tones which usually protrude rather painfully 
beyond the remainder of the orchestra. Now simi- 
lar phrases are possible in the softer middle register 
of the Horn, the tones of which blend well with 
strings, woodwind or brass. The rough low bass- 
notes of the Bassoon which can scarcely utter a piano 
without difficulty can now be replaced by the Horn 
capable of the most delicate shading. 
The greater flexibility of Trumpets and the Bass 
Tuba, which has wholly displaced the old Ophicleide, 
has been previously discussed. Chromatic passages 
for Trumpet are often found in the works of Strauss 
(Don Juan) while rapid runs for the Tuba are not 
infrequent as in Mascagni’s Cavalleria Rusticana. 
*The lyric theme from Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony has already 
been twice quoted in this series—Gehrkens’ p. 68, Mason p. 217, the 
former in appreciation, the latter in depreciation. Apart from all 
matters of taste, the excerpt affords a fine illustration of what the 
Valve-Horns enabled the composer to express. If the student will 
but refer to this quotation and number the complete measures it will 
be seen that the harmonies occuring on the third quarter-beats of 
measures 1, 3, 6 and 7, could never have been scored for the old 
Horns by Brahms or any other person even had they occurred to him. 
Later in the symphony these harmonic effects are elaborated in a 
manner as masterly as they are impressive.

Uritizinc ORCHESTRAL VIRTUOSITY 
After the improvement and apparent perfection of 
the various orchestral instruments the performers 
naturally revelled in the new technical possibilities 
and a proficiency on all was ultimately acquired such 
as would have dazzled the artists of the preceding 
century. But the new achievements were displayed 
chiefly in solo work* until Wagner had the temerity

to demand the application of this orchestral virtu- 
osity to his music dramas. At the great Bayreuth 
Festival of 1876, Wilhelmj who was the concert 
master on this occasion told a friend of mine that he sat

up nights practising passages that seemed impossible 
and told Wagner that they could not be played. The 
composer replied “What I want is the general effect. 
The notes one player misses another will play.” One 
of the places Wilhelmj referred to was in the Magic 
Fire Scene at the close of Die Walkiire where the 
Violins are given unheard-of figures suggesting the 
flickering of the flames. 
ORCHESTRA AND ORGAN 
Many have been the efforts to combine the Organ 
with the Orchestra in oratorios, concertos, etc. with 
varied success. Berlioz in his work on Orchestra- 
tion expresses his opinion that their natures are too 
conflicting like those of Emperor and Pope for them 
to coalesce. Possibly the proper means of blending 
them had not been sufficiently studied in that day. 
In recent years Pierné has achieved some charming 
results in his oratorio St. Francis by letting one voice- 
part in certain delicate registers of the Organ join 
the orchestral forces as an accessory instrument. 
Among modern compositions in which the Organ 
is employed as an instrument of the orchestra are: 
Saint-Saéns Symphony No. 3, in C minor, Liszt’s 
Dante, Tchaikovsky’s Manfred, Widor’s Sinfonia 
Sacra, and Loeffler’s Villanelle du diable. 
A beautiful illustration of what may be accom- 
plished by permitting the Organ to retain its eccle-
-P-A-G-E-235

siastical character while the Orchestra remains a live 
emotional creature, may be found in the opening 
measures of Die Meistersinger. Here the organ ac- 
companies the Choral sung by the congregation and 
the Orchestra during the interludes gives voice to the 
charming love motive of the Knight Walther.

Allusion was made in the Introduction to the pain- 
fully slow and very gradual growth of all these 
means of controlling sonorous vibrations, which we 
term Musical Instruments. The time involved in 
the evolution of these mechanical devices is, we may 
say, paralleled or coexistant with the period de- 
manded for the growth of man’s aural intelligence, 
the capacity of the human ear to discern and appre- 
ciate the finer distinctions in the shades of sound and 
the apprehension of the subtler tone combinations.
-P-A-G-E-236
226 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
Specialists tell us that eighty per cent of our know]- 
edge of the phenomena of the universe is derived 
through the medium of the eye, while but twenty per 
cent is acquired through the agency of the ear. The 
eye can enjoy the contemplation of a given object by 
the hour if desirable, in order to obtain the necessary 
impression upon the memory. The ear, on the other 
hand, can take cognizance of but one detail or 
grasp a combination of details produced at a given 
instant of time, which obviously involves a much 
greater effort of the memory. 
A striking illustration throwing light on this 
growth of tone-perception is afforded by a passage 
quoted by Helmholtz from the Problem XIX (de 
Audibilus) of Aristotle (B. C. 384-332) who, like so 
many other ancients and Orientals of all periods pre- 
ferred homophony or one voice-part music to the 
singing or playing of two or more, even when they 
produced consonant intervals. Says the learned 
philosopher, “On this account we understand better 
when we hear but one person speak than when sev- 
eral say the same thing. Thus too is it in regard 
to stringed instruments, and still worse is it if the 
Kithara is played while the Flute is performed, be- 
cause the voice-parts then flow in together. Espec- 
ially is this true of consonances, for the tones then 
mutually conceal each other.”
-P-A-G-E-237
  THE MODERN ORCHESTRA 227 
Since the days-when man could but feebly follow 
a slow succession of single tones, to the present time 
when the musical layman not only appreciates but 
demands a harmonic complex which would have mys- 
tified even his more recent ancestors, the growth of 
music and the kindred arts gives clear indication of 
the progress of mankind and his ever increasing sen- 
sitiveness to beauty in form, color and sound. —~— 
The art of beauty in sound—music—‘he most im- 
material of the arts, has been the last to develop, and 
it will be the function of the fourth book in this 
Course of Study to fully trace that development which 
in the present volume has been merely indicated as 
a gradual growth in aural sensitiveness accompanied 
by a similar growth in the means of expression 
through sound-producing instruments. 
The’'Greek masters of the Golden Age, architects, 
sculptors, poets and dramatists, gave to the world 
works that have served as models for the artists of all 
subsequent periods. But in the domain of music 
there have been found only a few straggling frag- 
ments, consisting chiefly of monotonous chantings 
that testify to the limitations of Hellenic musical 
achievement. 
Even in Rome when the Pantheon and Colosseum 
were erected, the psalmody of the Jewish and Chris- 
tian communities was characterized by simple unhar- 
monized melodies and chants.
-P-A-G-E-238
228 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
Not until nearly a thousand years had elapsed, and 
St. Mark’s Church at Venice appeared as the climax 
of Byzantine art, did it occur to musicians that it was 
possible to have two independent voice-parts. The 
result was the Organum of Hucbald with its crude 
successions of parallel fourths, fifths and octaves.* 
Some two centuries thereafter, when the glorious 
cathedrals of Strasburg and Cologne were well under 
way, and the poet Dante was writing his Divine Com- 
edy, musical authorities were beginning to concede 
that progressions of parallel thirds might be per- 
mitted. 
During the wonderful activity of Leonardo da 
Vinci, Raphael and Michael Angelo, the German 
chorale began to make itself felt. It was simple in- 
deed, but its four-part harmony and lyric structure 
was pregnant with potentiality. 
Shakespeare and Milton who soon followed were 
both of them keenly susceptible to the power of music 
and doubtless divined its latent possibilities, but 
there appeared in their day no tone creations com- 
parable to their transcendent poetry. 
Not until another century and a half had elapsed 
did music of parallel value with other arts appear 
when we find Bach, Handel, Haydn and Mozart tak- 
ing rank along with Goethe, Schiller, Reynolds, 
*See p. 89. 
   
-P-A-G-E-239
THE MODERN ORCHESTRA 229. 
Gainsborough and other poets and painters of that 
day. 
Finally in the nineteenth century, after the kin- 
dred arts had held their sway over mankind for some 
two thousand years, Music became prominent and for 
a time in certain respects surpassed the achievements 
of her sisters. Where, for instance, do we find con- 
temporaneous works in the other fields of art that in 
regard to absolute novelty of design and unusualness 
of emotional power are to be classed with the sym- 
phonies of Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, the songs of 
Schubert and Schumann, the piano poetry of Chopin, 
and the music dramas of Wagner? 
The attentive reader of this book must before this 
have recognized the parallel development of music 
and the instruments through which it found its utter- 
ance. The two are inseparable and it is interesting 
to note that the three great innovators, Bach, Beetho- 
ven and Wagner, enlarged the boundaries of musical 
expression through the employment of newly invented 
instruments, and promoted the improvement of these 
already in use. 
In one of the galleries of the Metropolitan Museum 
in New York may be seen portraits of Washington 
and Franklin painted by a Chinese artist. We in- 
stantly recognize the persons intended but we like- 
wise realize that these pictures are a vizualization of 
the great Americans through Mongolian eyes. For
-P-A-G-E-240
230 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
similar reasons the Italian and Spanish cartoonists 
inevitably depict Uncle Sam as an Italian or a Span- 
iard. As Prof. Stumpf says, “the hand of the artist 
is guided by the brain with its local traditions rather 
than by the eye.” 
We of Occidental tastes and traditions have learned 
to value the pictorial and architectural art of Asiatic, 
African and other peoples, even when their concep- 
tions of the beautiful do not correspond with our 
own, for we take pleasure in seeing how the world 
looks to them. 
If we devote a reasonable share of our time to the 
sympathetic study of their music, no matter how for- 
eign to our predilections, we shall find that they too 
have ardently sought to express in tones the emotions 
and spiritual longings of humanity. We thus ob- 
tain an idea of how—in a certain sense—the uni- 
verse sounds to them. 
‘Any effort that can bring us to a more clarified 
comprehension of the manifold conceptions of man- 
kind will be a needed and welcome step in the 
direction of international good-will and universal 
friendship.

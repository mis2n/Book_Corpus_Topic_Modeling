REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT 
To the Chairman and the Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching: 
N accordance with the by-laws, I present herewith the Twentieth Annual Report of 
the President of the Foundation, for the year ending June 30, 1925. 
ENDOWMENT, RESERVES, INCOME, AND EXPENDITURE 
Tue trustees held in trust on June 30 the following securities, given at their face 
value: 
(a) General Endowment 
United States Steel Corporation 50 year 5 per cent Gold 
Bonds $6,500,000 
Other securities 9,160,000 
Total $15,660,000 
(0) Division of Educational Enquiry 1,346,000 
(c) Reserve Fund Number One’ 11,032,000 
(d) Reserve Fund Number Two? 793,000 
(e) Emergency Reserve* 525,000 
Grand Total $29,356,000 
During the year the trustees received a total income of $1,349,289.58 for general 
purposes, —in addition to $56,731.93 from the endowment of the Division of Edu- 
- cational Enquiry,—$749,289.58 from the general endowment, and from the Carnegie 
Corporation of New York its appropriation of $600,000 a year, which is payable for 
ten years, and specific appropriations of $15,000 that are discussed elsewhere. The 
details of the employment and investment of all these receipts and of the sale of sun- 
dry securities and the investment of their proceeds in equally sound but more remu- 
nerative securities with more convenient maturities will be found in the report of the 
treasurer. 
Current expenditures have been as follows: 
1“ For the liquidation of pension obligations accruing subsequent to January 1, 1928.” 
2“ To provide assistance in institutions hereafter admitted to association with the Foundation, either in the form 
of retiring allowances to old and distinguished teachers or in assisting such colleges to inaugurate the contribu- 
tory plan.” 
®“ For such purposes as the trustees and the executive committee may direct.”

Total 52,371.10 
Grand Total $1,325,953.94 
Attention is called especially to the facts that Reserve Fund Number One now 
exceeds eleven million dollars, that Reserve Fund Number Two exceeds three-quar- 
ters of a million, and that the Emergency Reserve Fund exceeds half a million dollars. 
The sale of securities during the year amounted to more than six million dollars, the 
purchases to more than seven millions. 
The United States Steel Corporation having made proposals for the redemption 
of some of its bonds held by Mr. Carnegie’s several philanthropies, the executive 
committee empowered the president to act for the Carnegie Foundation, together with 
representatives of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Carnegie 
Institution of Washington, in negotiations for such redemption. In accordance with 
this action there was delivered to the United States Steel Corporation $5,500,000 
par value of its fifty-year five per cent bonds. In exchange the Foundation received 
$616,290.94 in cash, and bonds of subsidiaries of the United States Steel Corpora- 
tion, bearing the guarantee of that corporation, to the value of $5,620,520. Thus 
the Foundation received approximately 115 for its Steel Bonds, and so increased its 
holdings by a par value of approximately $500,000 and its income by approximately 
$50,000. 
‘Including $13,608.16 from Reserve Fund Number Two. * Including $660 from Reserve Fund Number Two. 
5 Including $600 from Reserve Fund Number Two. * Including $770 from Emergency Reserve Fund.

  PROCEEDINGS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 5 
MEETING OF THE TRUSTEES 
Tue nineteenth annual meeting of the trustees was held on November 19, 1924, fif- 
teen of the twenty-five members being present. 
In the annual election of officers President Vinson was chosen chairman; President 
Suzzallo, vice-chairman; and President Aydelotte, secretary. President Butler and 
President Humphreys were elected to succeed themselves as members of the execu- 
tive committee. 
The vacancies on the board created by the death of President Samuel Plantz and 
the resignation of Mr. T. Morrison Carnegie were filled by the election of Provost 
Josiah Penniman of the University of Pennsylvania and President John Hanson 
Thomas Main of Grinnell College. 
The work of the year, as recorded in the report of the president, the report of the 
executive committee, and the minutes of the committee, was reviewed and approved. 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
Tur executive committee met four times during the year, in November, January, 
May, and June. Full records of these meetings, the one hundred and first to the one 
hundred and fourth, inclusive, with detailed reports of the financial operations ap- 
proved by the committee, were mailed to the trustees after each meeting. The retir- 
ing allowances and pensions voted by the committee during the year are given in full 
on later pages of this report. 
The list of institutions associated with the Foundation was increased during the 
year by the addition of Pomona College on November 7, 1924. A description of this 
institution will be found on later pages of this report. 
Desiring from time to time to assist certain educational projects through the Car- 
negie Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation voted and the Foundation accepted and 
transmitted, during the year, appropriations of $5000 for the expenses of a committee 
of the Department of Superintendence of the National Education Association on uni- 
form standards and curricula in the public schools, $5000 for the work of the Codp- 
erative Bureau for Women Teachers, and $5000 to the University of the State of New 
York for experiments in applying a new type of examination in science. 
Recalling the procedure which had secured the exemption of retiring allowances 
and pensions paid by the Foundation from Federal and New York State income taxes, 
the president was authorized to make similar application for the exemption of such 
allowances and pensions from the income taxes now imposed upon them by the State 
of Massachusetts. 
In administering the rules for retirement, the committee reaffirmed its judgments 
that professors devoted to the applied rather than to the academic aspects of physical 
education have no expectations from the Foundation, and that the withdrawal of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  
  6 TRUSTEES AND ee COMMITTEE 
teacher from the list of associated institutions terminates his expectations from the 
Foundation, except in such special cases as appointment to the Harmsworth Profes- 
sorship of American History at Oxford. 
After careful consideration of various applications from non-associated institutions, 
the committee did not grant any such allowances during the present year. Having 
expended for such allowances approximately one million dollars before the end of 
1917, the committee reaffirmed its judgment as to the necessity of continuing some 
grants of this kind. It was convinced, however, that the most urgent needs had been 
met by voting since January 1, 1918, not more than twenty-seven such allowances and 
pensions, with an approximate total expenditure of $158,000. The average of these 
grants was $914. One was in Canada, one in Newfoundland, nine were in the South, 
including five institutions for negroes, and the remainder in parts of the United States 
where there are no associated institutions. Thirteen were pensions to widows of teach- 
ers who were in receipt of retiring allowances before 1918, and were therefore con- 
sequent upon earlier grants. The wholly new grants of this kind during the seven 
years have been only fourteen in number.

THE WORK OF THE YEAR 
THE ADMISSION OF POMONA COLLEGE TO 
THE ASSOCIATED LIST 
N November 7, 1924, the executive committee admitted Pomona College to the 
list of institutions that are associated with the Foundation. 
Pomona College, founded in 1887 and subsequently located at Claremont, Cali- 
fornia, has shared the swift development of Southern California. The College was 
originally a project of the Congregational Church but, in accord with the general 
practice of churches of this communion, was soon set free from all denominational 
control. The board of trustees is self-perpetuating and there is no limitation of any 
kind concerning creed or sect. 
Soon after its incorporation Pomona College began work in a small private house 
in the city of Pomona. In January, 1888, the College was moved to what was con- 
sidered a temporary site in the then undeveloped town of Claremont. Although it 
was intended shortly to move the institution back to Pomona, the College continued 
in its new location until the purpose of returning to Pomona was abandoned. Mean- 
while the original name became fixed. 
The College graduated its first class in 1894, and from that time the growth in 
numbers has been such as to tax the resources of a very generous constituency. In 
1915 it was found necessary to limit the size of the undergraduate student body to 
750, the present limitation, although applications for admission several times exceed 
the number that can be received. The limiting of numbers has made possible so care- 
ful a selection that the number of graduates in each class year by year nearly equals 
the number admitted as freshmen. 
The original campus of twelve acres has now grown to four hundred and fifty acres 
and the buildings of the College have developed in like proportion. The College has 
been fortunate in being able to build according to a somewhat definite plan, and 
its campus, located at the foot of the Sierra Madre Mountains, is extremely pictur- 
esque. 
From the beginning the institution sought to maintain high standards and was for- 
tunate in the devotion and quality of a body of instructors who have remained through 
the subsequent years. Recently more abundant resources have made it possible to se- 
cure excellent additions to the faculty. The phenomenal growth in population of the 
surrounding country, and the proportion in this population of men and women deeply 
interested in education, promise for the College a history of large importance.

RETIRING ALLOWANCES OF THE FOUNDATION 21 
The addition of Pomona College enlarges the number of institutions that are asso- 
ciated with the Foundation to eighty-eight. Of these sixty-one, or approximately 
three-fourths, have adopted the contractual plan of retiring allowances. 
Of the twenty-seven other institutions, Harvard University and the University of 
California have adopted an independent plan of accumulation, with the possibility 
of later purchasing annuities from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. 
The University of Wisconsin has been included in the system of retiring allowances 
for the public school teachers of the state, although this system does not permit of 
allowances that bear an adequate relation to the salaries of university teachers. 
The remaining twenty-four institutions have as yet made no provisions looking 
toward retiring allowances for the teachers who have entered their service since 1915, 
and hence have no expectations from the original free pension plan of the Foundation. 
This failure for a decade to make such proyision will in all probability reduce the 
allowances that may later be provided for these teachers by approximately one-fourth 
of the amount they would have received had provision been begun promptly. Each 
month of further delay makes the discrepancy greater. This increases proportionately 
the ultimate distress of retiring on an inadequate allowance or remaining in service 
after the time for retirement has obviously arrived. It increases also the present dis- 
tress of anticipating either of these conclusions instead of the adequate allowance at 
an appropriate time that is now the certain prospect of teachers in most of our repre- 
sentative institutions. An increasing number of able and progressive teachers are 
indicating their anxiety that these institutions should ignore so essential a condition 
of academic well-being. 
THE RETIRING ALLOWANCES OF THE FOUNDATION 
Tue number of retiring allowances for teachers and pensions for widows becoming 
operative during the years which ended on June 30, 1924 and 1925, respectively, indi- 
cate the variability to which any system of retiring allowances is subject. During the 
former year an unusually large number of allowances and pensions, 77, became opera- 
tive, and an unusually small number, 27, were terminated by death, leaving a net 
increase of 50. During the latter, present, year, a smaller number of allowances and 
pensions, 72, became operative, and an unusually large number, 47, were terminated, 
leaving a net increase of only 25. There is no change whatever in the number of allow- 
ances on the basis of age that are being paid through associated institutions. 
The age at which teachers have chosen to retire, during 1924-25, has been pre- 
cisely that of the average for the past five years, namely, 67.14 years. 
The average retiring allowance in force, however, has increased during these years 
from $2126 to $2188. Because of this increase in the average allowance and of the 
ordinary increase in the number of retiring allowances, the annual expenditure of 
the Foundation for teachers in the associated institutions and their widows has grown  
-P-A-G-E-32
22 THE WORK OF THE YEAR 
during the past five years from $844,000 to $1,106,697. This increase has been closely 
in accord with the estimates of its entire prospective expenditure which the Founda- 
tion causes to be made every second year. These estimates indicate that, on the basis 
of recent salaries, this annual expenditure for retiring allowances and pensions 
will increase to approximately $2,241,000, about the year 1944, and then begin to 
decrease, until all of the approximately four thousand teachers who have expectations 
from the Foundation, and their widows, have received allowances and pensions, termi- 
nating about 1985. 
During the several years when the expected expenditures exceed the ordinary in- 
come of the Foundation, that income will be supplemented from Reserve Fund Num- 
ber One, which was set up in 1918 for that purpose, and now contains eleven million 
dollars. 
SUPPLEMENTARY ALLOWANCES 
Attowances from the Foundation have steadily increased in size. The Foundation 
is now distributing more than a million dollars a year in retiring allowances and 
pensions, and will distribute considerably more than that amount annually before it 
has cared for all of those who have expectations from its funds. The high cost of 
living and the depreciation of the dollar have, however, reduced the purchasing power 
of these allowances and pensions until numbers of them are not only small but, from 
the point of view of the prospective recipients and their colleges, inadequate. 
A number of institutions have planned to supplement the allowances from the 
Foundation by contributing toward contracts with the Teachers Insurance and An- 
nuity Association for their older as well as their younger teachers. Some of these 
have agreed to make up out of their own funds the difference between the original 
and the present expectations of their teachers from the Foundation. Others duplicate 
contributions from the teachers to make up the difference. Yet others duplicate such 
contributions up to five per cent of the teacher’s salary, that is, make for the older 
teachers who have expectations from the Foundation the same payments that they 
make for their younger teachers, who have contractual annuities alone. 
Eleven associated institutions report that they supplement retiring allowances from 
the Foundation, as follows: 
Dickinson College pays two-thirds and the teacher one-third of the cost of con- 
tractual annuities, which represent the difference between the original and the 
present expectations from the Foundation. 
Harvard University may, by a vote of the President and Fellows, supplement al- 
lowances from the Foundation. 
McGill University will pay the difference between a retiring allowance from the 
Foundation at sixty-five and the amount the teacher would have received had he 
continued in service to the age entitling him to his maximum retiring allowance 
under the present rules of the Foundation.
-P-A-G-E-33
SUPPLEMENTARY ALLOWANCES (a) 
Oberlin College will supplement the contractual annuities of its teachers, whether 
eligible for allowances from the Foundation or not, until the resulting annuities, 
or allowances and annuities, amount to $1800 a year for the teacher at age sixty- 
eight and $900 for his widow. 
Princeton University will supplement retiring allowances from the Foundation 
until they equal one-half of the salary received by the teachers at retirement, at 
from sixty-five to sixty-eight, with a maximum of $3250. 
Ripon College pays, up to five per cent of its salary budget, toward annuities for 
teachers who were under fifty-one in 1919, whether they have expectations from 
the Foundation or not. 
The University of Toronto will make a the difference between the original and 
the present expectations from the Foundation. 
Wells College pays the difference between the original and the present allowances 
from the Foundation. 
Wesleyan University adds $400 a year to retiring allowances from the Foundation. 
Williams College guarantees its teachers who were appointed prior to March, 1919, 
a retiring allowance of $1500, independently of the Foundation. 
Yale University makes good to retiring teachers any reduction in retiring allow- 
ances due to changes in the rules of the Foundation. 
Seven institutions whose officers and teachers have no expectations of free allow- 
ances from the Foundation make somewhat similar arrangements: 
The University of British Columbia pays toward the contractual annuities of its 
older teachers an amount equal to six, seven, or eight per cent of their salaries. 
The Carnegie Institution guarantees a minimum allowance. 
The University of Chicago supplements contractual annuities for those who were 
eligible for its own original free pensions, until the annuities equal what the pen- 
sions would have been. 
The General Education Board, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, and the 
Rockefeller Foundation pay toward annuity contracts the premiums that would 
have been paid by the annuitant and the employing institution and the interest 
that would have accumulated had the system been in effect at the time of the 
employee’s entrance into the service. 
The University of South Carolina, after duplicating all payments made by its 
teachers toward annuity contracts, distributes among the annuity contracts of its 
older men such sums as may remain in its annual legislative appropriation for 
annuity purposes. 
The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association has received from several hundred 
teachers single premiums, in addition to the accumulation toward annuities that is 
based upon the regular contributions made by these teachers and by their institutions 
for them. The satisfying results of such action are indicated by the following concrete 
instances of specific payments and the resulting annuities:

Women 30 250 96.24 
49 4000 734.40 
56 2000 276.00 
In addition to these amounts, which are guaranteed by the annuity contracts, the 
trustees have, in each year, been able to set aside for all annuity contracts interest 
at the rate of one-half of one pér cent in addition to the contractual rate of four per 
cent, the highest allowed by law. 
The contracts provide that in case of the death of the annuitant before the pay- 
ment of his or her annuity has begun, all premiums, with their interest accumula- 
tions, will be paid to the wife or other beneficiary or to the estate of the annuitant. 
Options in the contract allow the choice at any time of annuities beginning at 
ages earlier or later than the customary age of sixty-five— these for such amounts 
as the premiums provide at the age of retirement chosen. For earlier retirement the 
accumulation will have covered a shorter period and the annuity must extend over 
a longer period. Both of these factors reduce the size of an annuity as compared with 
one beginning at a later age, when the contributions have accumulated over a longer 
period and the annuity needs to cover a shorter period. The contract provides further, 
at the time of retirement, an option alternative to the contractual annuity during the 
life of the annuitant only, in the form of an annuity to the annuitant as long as he may 
live, to continue after the death of the annuitant to his wife or other beneficiary as 
long as she may live. A third option provides an annuity to the annuitant as long as he 
may live, followed by payments to his estate until the total payments equal the total 
amount of all of the premiums paid, with their accumulated interest, up to the time of 
retirement. 
THRIFT FOR TEACHERS 
Tue suggestion that college teachers might well put aside considerable savings will 
be approved or rejected according to individual temperament, circumstances, and ex- 
perience. 'The time has scarcely arrived when it is possible to secure widespread con- 
firmation or trustworthy contradiction of the statement that most teachers earn much 
less than they could in some other calling. It is, however, becoming demonstrable 
that the tenure of teachers is more secure than that of most other salaried workers 
and is followed by better provisions for retirement, that teachers have unparalleled 
leisure for outside earning, and that they enjoy unusual privileges with respect to 
inexpensive housing and recreation, reduced cost of education for their children, and 
discounts on many of their purchases.
-P-A-G-E-35
  THRIFT FOR TEACHERS 25 
The recognition of these factors and the advantage that may be taken of them de- 
pend upon the nature and interests of the individual and his family and the traditional 
and customary standard of living of the faculty circle in which they are included. 
An attitude toward the problem which will seem satisfying to few college teachers 
is illustrated by the following letter from a scholar of international distinction who 
is also so genial that he will pardon the use of his situation to point a moral. In con- 
nection with his transfer from an institution that has a contractual system of retiring 
allowances to one that has none, he writes: “We are blessed with the most charming 
surroundings and the weather has been wonderful. The children enjoy themselves and 
are quite satisfied. The subject of the children brings me to the serious matter of this 
letter —we have no means of transporting them out into the country. I have accu- 
mulated a sum of somewhat over $800 toward an annuity. The price of a delightful 
little four seater car (new) is $850 or $900. The implication is obvious, in view of the 
fact that there is no retirement here due to superannuation. Do you think I could 
get the money? I had thought of putting it into extra insurance but my wife thinks 
that the car would be a wiser expenditure. My life is already insured for $5000.” 
The experiences that are mentioned in the following quotations from a considerable 
number of letters of similar tenor from university teachers are more encouraging: 
“TI have saved enough to invest in two annuities which give me nearly eight hun- 
dred dollars a year, Also I built a house on the College grounds, for which I receive 
rent.” 
“We have always lived with economy and saved enough to make our income after 
retirement about equal to my old salary.” 
“T have alwayssaved something. My income is chiefly furnished from investments.” 
“T have made it a rule since the beginning of my teaching to save something every 
year. Interest on this fund and the gains from casual lecturing now bring me entire 
ease.” 
The National Conference on Thrift Education, held in Washington in June, 1924, 
under the auspices of the National Council on Education and the National Education 
Association, gave special attention to these matters. 
On this occasion the United States Commissioner of Education said: “None of us by 
the broadest possible conceit could think of ourselves as a thrifty people. ... We have 
never been compelled to be a careful or thrifty people. We have found it possible to 
waste much of our wealth and still maintain a higher standard of living and enjoy 
more luxury than most other peoples. . . . Nearly thirty per cent of the annual expend- 
itures of the American people goes for things which are not only unnecessary, but 
some of which are known to be positively harmful and injurious. Only about twenty- 
five per cent of our expenditures are for food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities of 
living. . . . Common sense, common reason, and common prudence must compel us to 
recognize that our present wasteful methods cannot be indefinitely prolonged.” 
The President of the National Education Association added: “A good many
-P-A-G-E-36
    26 THE WORK OF THE YEAR 
of us had to take the lesson to heart ourselves, because when we made an investiga- 
tion into the subject and got together some statistics and inquired as to the budget 
making of family incomes, we found that many of us were far exceeding the propor- 
tion of income that should go to rent. . . . If both income and saving are considered 
from the point of view of relative value and ultimate value, the habit of self-control 
results.” 
The Chairman of the special section of the Conference which dealt with savings 
and investments concluded : ‘‘ Many teachers do not have a definite plan of saving. 
They do not save for a specific purpose or work on a sound budget plan. If teachers 
were required, through the course of study, to present to their pupils the principles of 
thrift and the need for budgeting income and expenditures, they would themselves 
acquire the habit of budgeting income and expenditures and develop well thought out 
plans of investment. People whose salaries or financial income is small, may make in- 
vestments fully as sound as those that can be made by people of larger means.” 
Sundry correspondents of the Carnegie Foundation suggest one further considera- 
tion. A considerable number of college teachers are unfortunate in their investments. 
The following quotations are not unrepresentative: 
“T invested some money many years ago in seashore lands, but the property has 
but slowly appreciated in value and has brought us but scanty returns, barely enough 
to pay taxes.” 
“T incurred a very heavy debt, and later lost, through the treachery of those I had 
trusted, all my means, except my library.” 
Lack of information, untrustworthy advice, the inability to follow investments 
closely, and various unforeseen contingencies, have cost a considerable number of col- 
lege teachers such savings as they have been able to make. 
This was one of the reasons for the organization of the Teachers Insurance and 
Annuity Association and its secure establishment from philanthropic funds. It is per- 
haps the chief reason why eminent men of affairs so generously give their time and 
wisdom to its guidance. No financial organization in the country, of whatever char- 
acter, enjoys greater security or more competent direction. College teachers cannot 
do better than accept the statement of the examiners of the New York State Insur- 
ance Department that “no other organization doing an insurance business can be 
compared with it,” and follow their advice: “Those who are eligible to its benefits 
may well avail themselves of the opportunity to thus provide at a minimum cost for 
the protection of dependents and for a competence in old age.”

28 THE WORK OF THE YEAR 
ApopTion of THE ConrractuaL PLAN or Retirinc ALLOWANCES 
During the year July 1, 1924, to June 30, 1925, ten universities, colleges, research 
institutions, and endowed schools adopted the contractual plan of retiring allowances, 
namely : the University of Saskatchewan, Trinity College (Connecticut), the Principia; 
the American Council on Education, the American University Union, the Chautauqua 
Institution, the Russell Sage Foundation; the Clarke School for the Deaf, Potomac 
School, and the Spence School. 
The annuity contracts of the Association have therefore now been adopted by 
ninety-eight universities and colleges, sixteen research institutions, and eighteen en- 
dowed schools, a total of one hundred and thirty-two. Teachers in more than three 
hundred other institutions have taken contracts without the assistance of the insti- 
tutions with which they are connected. 
It is interesting to note the number of officers and teachers in various represen- 
tative institutions that have taken annuity contracts with the Association with the 
codperation of their institutions, and life insurance policies independently of their 
institutions.

Sevxction or 'TrustEEs By Poticy—HoLDERS 
The plan of having one-fourth of the trustees of the Association elected upon direct 
nomination by the policy-holders is now in full operation. In this way in 1921 Samuel 
McCune Lindsay, Professor of Social Legislation, Columbia University, was elected 
a trustee for the term 1921-25. In 1922 Thomas Sewall Adams, Professor of Politi- 
cal Economy at Yale University, was elected a trustee for the term 1922-26. In 1923 
Frank Aydelotte, President of Swarthmore College, was elected a trustee for the term
-P-A-G-E-39
THE TEACHERS INSURANCE AND ANNUITY ASSOCIATION 29 
1923-27. In 1924 James W. Glover, Professor of Mathematics and Insurance in the 
University of Michigan, and a trustee of the Association since 1919, was reélected 
a trustee for the term 1924-28. 
So far as its officers can learn, the Association is the only life insurance company 
whose policy-holders actually nominate directors or trustees. The increasing num- 
ber of policy-holders taking part in these nominations, from 452 in 1921 to 1297 in 
1924, the admirable discrimination exercised in their recommendations, and the nu- 
merous valuable suggestions for the work of the Association that have accompanied 
their ballots, all indicate a deep interest in their company and a growing satisfaction 
in its operations. 
Expenses oF MANAGEMENT 
It will beremembered that at the organization of the Association in 1918 the Carne- 
gie Corporation provided $500,000 capital and $500,000 paid-in surplus, these sums 
representing, respectively, five and ten times the legal requirement. Besides giving 
security additional to that furnished by the full legal policy reserves, the paid-in capi- 
tal and surplus furnish an income for the expenses of management, thus enabling 
the Association to offer annuities and insurance to college teachers at cost, without 
the customary loading for expenses, and to assure the teacher that the whole of every 
premium that he pays or that is paid by his college for him, with accumulated inter- 
est, will be used only for his benefit or that of his designated beneficiaries. 
Anticipating the time when the work of the Association would demand adminis- 
tration which could not be provided from the income of one million dollars, the trus- 
tees of the Carnegie Foundation passed, on April 22, 1918, the following resolution: 
That it is the intention of the trustees of the Foundation to see that proper 
provision is made for meeting all reasonable overhead charges of the Teachers 
Insurance and Annuity Association, in case sufficient means are not available 
for that purpose from the funds given by the Carnegie Corporation. 
Supplementing this action, the trustees of the Carnegie Corporation voted, on 
October 23, 1924: 
Wuereas, The business of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association 
is increasing so rapidly that it is evident that the expenses of management may 
come to exceed 
(a) the income of one million dollars contributed by the Carnegie Corporation 
to meet the overhead charges of the Association, and 
(6) such sums as are within the financial ability of the Carnegie Foundation to 
devote to such expenses: 
Resoivep, That it is the sense of this Board that in such cases the Carnegie 
Foundation should apply to the Carnegie Corporation for such further grants as 
may be necessary from time to time to give effect to the purpose for which the 
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association was established, which included 
payment of the entire expense of management without any diminution of re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
30 THE WORK OF THE YEAR 
turns to the policy-holders, and that such grants as may be necessary to supply 
any deficit after the application of the funds above specified shall be made by 
the Corporation as the occasion may arise. 
By these resolutions the Association is put in position to carry out adequately 
and permanently its benevolent intention to conduct its operations without cost to 
the teachers who hold its contracts, and to see that all of the funds entrusted to it 
by them and their colleges are used for their benefit. 
DivipEnps 
It has been the fortune of the Association from the beginning not only to write its 
contracts at their net statistical cost, but also to credit or pay an annual dividend 
on each contract. Dividends on annuity contracts are credited as part of the accumu- 
lation, those on insurance contracts are paid by check annually. The annual reports 
of the Association contain a section indicating the way in which these arrangements 
make the cost of contract with the Association from eighteen to forty-five per cent 
smaller than the cost of similar contracts with insurance companies which must use a 
portion of the policy-holders’ premiums for the expenses of administration, manage- 
ment, and operation. 
Aynuities Bete Pap 
The statement is occasionally made that it will be some time before the Associa- 
tion begins to make payments on account of its annuity contracts. A reference to 
the comparative financial statement that is printed above will indicate that, on the 
contrary, annuity payments were begun during the Association’s first year and have 
increased until they now represent a considerable sum annually. 
Monthly payments are now being made on some thirty annuity contracts, one-third 
being in the form of regular settlements according to the provisions of the contracts, 
the remainder having been purchased outright. Since the period of accumulation has 
been short, as yet no one of these payments is for a large sum. Four of the regular set- 
tlements, however, are for $50, $53, $55, and $83 a month for the remainder of the 
life of the annuitant. One of the annuities purchased outright is for $50, another for 
$132 a month. One annuitant, familiar with the long European experience in such 
matters, has from time to time, as opportunity came, purchased six such contracts 
with a resulting total payment of one hundred dollars a month for life. 
Lire Insurance PayMEnts 
During the year July 1, 1924, to June 30, 1925, seven insurance contracts were termi- 
nated by death. These were held by Thomas H. Black, Professor of Political Science 
at the University of Toronto; Samuel C. Parker, Professor of Education at the Uni- 
versity of Chicago; Samuel C. Thompson, Assistant Superintendent of the Depart-

New Pottcy Form 
While seeking always security as a first and fundamental consideration, the Asso- 
ciation desires also to provide for its policy-holders such increasing advantages as may 
be possible from the newer, sound developments in the field of annuities and insur- 
ance. With this in mind the trustees in November approved for use among the other 
offerings of the Association a form of life insurance policy, long used in Europe but 
only recently introduced into the United States, known as A Modified Life Policy with 
Change of Premium Rate at End of Five Years. Its characteristics are described as 
follows: 
With rates for the first five years somewhat more than the rates for term insur- 
ance, and for the years after five somewhat less than the ordinary life rate for the 
insured’s attained age, this being made possible by the increased rate for the first 
five years. 
Without reéxamination at the end of the first five years. 
With the usual waiver of premium in case of disability. 
A maximum of $15,000 on one life, or an amount over term policies to make 
$15,000 in all. 
Not written for ages over 45. 
MODIFIED LIFE RATE

11.73 45 17.05 33.57 50 35.75 
This form of policy with its exceedingly low rate for the first five years is especially 
attractive to those who desire permanent insurance protection at the smallest initial 
premium outlay. While the premium automatically increases to a higher figure at the 
end of five years, it is felt that the policy will be welcomed by all those who may 
reasonably expect a substantial advance of income within that time. The policy con- 
tains the usual provision for waiver of premium in case of disability, and provides for 
loan and non-forfeiture values beginning at the end of three years. 
Sratr SuPERVISION 
The Association profits greatly from the guidance and supervision of the Super- 
intendent of Insurance of the State of New York. His advice and the large experience
-P-A-G-E-42
32 THE WORK OF THE YEAR 
of his office aided each step in the organization of the Association and many proced- 
ures, especially with regard to annuities, which were then, through his codperation, 
worked out and established for the first time in the United States, have since been 
enacted into law and adopted in the contracts of other companies. 
Each form of contract offered by the Association and the form of every important 
document required in its work are approved by the Superintendent before they are 
used. All important details of organization and management are similarly the results 
of correspondence, conference, or other forms of codperation with his office. 
At the end of each year, along with every other life insurance company organized 
under the laws of the state, the Association files with the Superintendent approxi- 
mately one square rod of statistical statements, answering some five thousand ques- 
tions. A summary of these statements is printed annually in the report of the Super- 
intendent. Similar, although briefer, statements are filed at the end of each quarter. 
At least once every three years an inspector of the State Insurance Department, 
with competent assistants, makes a careful, detailed examination of every significant 
aspect of the work of the Association. The Association has just received the report 
of an examination of its operations for the fiscal years 1923 and 1924. 
This document outlines the history of the Association in some detail, emphasizes 
its special resources for meeting the expenses of administration, describes the charter 
and organization, the designation of trustees by the policy-holders, the freedom of the 
Association from Federal taxation, and its operation without agents. 
Following numerous pages of detailed financial statements, the report commends 
the character of the investments that have been made, especially the increase in their 
net income from 4.96 per cent in 1919 to 5.7 per cent in 1924. 
There are numerous discussions concerning the collection of premiums, the credit- 
ing of interest, the adequacy of the legal reserves, and the setting up of reserves in 
addition to those required by law, the payment of death claims and dividends, and 
the particular advantages of the Association’s annuity and insurance contracts. 
The concluding section of the report, in its generous appreciation, will be grati- 
fying to every friend of the Association. It is here quoted, by permission, in full: 
“In view of the unique character of this organization and the distinctive methods 
it employs, your examiner has made it the subject of a special study and as a 
result feels warranted in the statement that the Association is an institution 
educational in an economic sense and benevolent rather than charitable, issuing 
to its policy-holders, insurance and annuity contracts at net rates and less cost 
and doing business on scientific and conservative principles without intent or 
expectation of profit to any individual or group of individuals other than its 
policy-holders. Its risks are taken from a class usually regarded as above the aver- 
age from an insurance standpoint, though for that reason less desirable as an- 
nuitants. It discharges its policy obligations with justice and dispatch and car- 
ries reserves equal at least to legal requirements. Its distribution of surplus is 
solely to policy-holders by methods which seem to your examiner to be equitable.

“Those who are eligible to its benefits may well avail themselves of the oppor- 
tunity to thus provide at a minimum cost for the protection of dependents and 
for a competence in old age.” 
DistnTER ESTED ADVICE 
It can scarcely be repeated too often that one of the outstanding services of the 
Association, in increasing measure, is the provision of full and disinterested infor- 
mation and guidance concerning the adjustment of annuity and insurance protection 
to the needs of the individual university and college teacher. An increasing number 
of officers and agents of life insurance companies, realizing that their companies can- 
not compete with the special advantages and the low cost of the Association’s con- 
tracts for college teachers, are advising their clients to take advantage of the maxi- 
mum offerings of the Association before making other arrangements.

SOME CONTRASTS BETWEEN AMERICAN AND CANADIAN 
LEGAL EDUCATION 
UCCESSIVE Annual Reports of the Foundation, beginning with the Eighth 
(1913), have included brief discussions of legal education and cognate matters, 
similar to the following pages. The same material is published annually as a sepa- 
rate pamphlet for distribution to lawyers, law teachers, and students. Three special 
extended Bulletins of interest to the legal profession have also been issued: 
Number Eight: The Common Law and the Case Method in American University 
Law Schools, by Josef Redlich, 1915. 
Number Thirteen: Justice and the Poor, by Reginald Heber Smith, 1919; Third 
Edition, 1924. 
Number Fifteen: T'raining: for the Public Profession of the Law, by Alfred Z. Reed, 
1921. 
A fourth Bulletin, bearing the title Present-Day Law Schools, is now being 
printed. Confidential proofs will be sent to the law schools before publication. 
BAR ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS 
Durine the autumn of 1924 the writer took a trip through Canada, primarily for 
the purpose of collecting material for the Bulletin now passing through the press. 
Pending the appearance of this, readers on both sides of the international boundary 
may be interested in a general comparison between the bar admission systems of 
Canada and of the United States. 
One of the most obvious differences between the two countries appears in the or- 
ganization of the admitting authority. In Canada, to a much greater extent than in 
the United States, the organized legal profession participates in the making of rules 
and in the conduct of examinations. The extent of the control which Canadian Law 
Societies actually exercise over the admission of lawyers into practice must not, how- 
ever, be exaggerated. As in the United States, at least the main lines of the require- 
ments are usually laid down by the legislatures; and in Ontario and the prairie 
provinces the law schools have gone much further than in any American state in 
securing administrative control of the examinations. In this respect, the real con- 
trast between the two countries is not that Canadian practitioners have somewhat 
greater influence over the process of admission, but that Canadian judges have much 
less. The ceremonial “call to the bar” lingers as a traditional survival, but there is 
not a trace of the all but universal American system of judicial rules affecting ad- 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
mission to the bar, and examination of applicants by the judges or by boards ap- 
pointed by them. 
It is significant in this connection that for some years there has been a movement, 
fostered by the American Judicature Society and by the Conference of Bar Associa- 
tion Delegates of the American Bar Association, to establish in the several states of 
the Union inclusive “ self-governing” associations of lawyers, modeled in a general 
way upon the incorporated Canadian Law Societies. Up to the present time four states 
— North Dakota, Alabama, Idaho, and New Mexico—have enacted the requisite 
legislation. The four enactments differ from one another in detail, but in one way 
or another all preserve the characteristic American principle that the courts should as 
a matter of policy, if not of law, exercise a certain amount of control over the admis- 
sion of lawyers into practice. 
A difference of more serious moment is the greater severity of the Canadian re- 
quirements. The applicant must pay higher fees; he must usually undergo a more 
complex system of examinations; above all, he is required to devote more time to 
his preparation than in the United States. Inspection of the information printed on 
succeeding pages will reveal the fact that in only three American jurisdictions — 
Kansas, West Virginia, and Illinois — is the minimum interval between leaving the 
high school and admission to practice (the sum, that is to say, of the preliminary 
college years and the years devoted to technical law) now, or soon to be, so long as 
five years; and in only two more — New York and Colorado — is the corresponding 
figure four years. Four out of nine Canadian provinces require as many as five years, 
and four others require no less than six years after leaving the high school. In the 
Province of New Brunswick and in Newfoundland the requirements are slightly lower, 
because less is demanded in the way of general education, yet even here these general 
qualifications, such as they are, must be satisfied before the period of law study be- 
gins. There is no Canadian counterpart for the fifteen states where the applicant can 
secure the requisite amount of general education, so-called, by intensive preparation 
pursued at the same time that he is studying law. Still less can a Canadian lawyer 
understand how there can be seventeen American jurisdictions which require no 
specific amount of general education; or how, among these, there can be seven which 
do not require even a period of law study. 
There is a marked contrast also in the type or location of law study that will be 
accepted. In the United States, the rules, even when they define the period of study, 
are often very vague in regard to its character. Sometimes they require merely study 
under the general supervision of a lawyer, or “under proper direction”; under this 
system almost any sort of preparation can be offered. The prevailing rule is a trifle 
more stringent in that it limits the applicant to study either in a law school or in 
a law office, or partly in one and partly in the other, in such proportions as he may 
himself decide. The few states that go into greater detail are actuated by conflicting 
ideals. Some— as, for instance, New Jersey, and for most applicants New York—
-P-A-G-E-49
LEGAL EDUCATION 39 
insist that the applicant during his period of preparation shall spend at least a certain 
specified amount of time in a law office, with the privilege of spending his entire 
period there if he so desire. Others —as, for instance, Illinois— discourage office work 
by lengthening the period of preparation in the case of students who do not secure 
their entire preparation in a law school; West Virginia has gone so far as to announce 
that it will refuse credit for any training secured in a law office. 
On the other hand, all the Canadian provinces agree that the ideal preparation 
would consist of a suitable combination of school and office work. For this reason, 
in every province the student must include in his preparation a certain amount of 
office training. But also in every province except Prince Edward Island the successful 
completion of a three-year law school course is either likewise obligatory, or is en- 
couraged by a provision that in such cases the total period of preparation may be 
reduced. It is true that east of the prairie provinces, as in the United States, there 
are not wanting those who doubt whether the modern law office and the law student 
have much to offer one another. This attitude finds no reflection, however, in the 
actual bar admission rules. The question that now particularly agitates those respon- 
sible for the development of these rules is not whether law school and law office work 
ought to be combined, but how this can be done most effectively: by having the stu- 
dent divide each working day between school and office; or by interpolating the office 
work into the long summer vacations of the school; or by postponing the office service 
until after the law school course is completed. 
Other significant differences are the division of the legal profession, in the Province 
of Quebec, into the two mutually exclusive groups of Notaries and of Advocates (or 
the “Bar”); the operation of law schools by the legal profession itself in Ontario and 
British Columbia, and by the legal profession jointly with the provincial university 
in Manitoba; the far greater readiness of Canadian professional authorities to shorten 
the required period of law study in the case of college graduates; and the greater 
extent and more varied forms of codperation between practitioners and university 
law faculties in the conduct of examinations. Of less practical importance, though of 
considerable interest to the student of legal education, are the technical survivals 
found in some of the printed rules, such as the occasional appearance of the original 
title of “attorney ” (universally preserved in the United States) in place of the modern 
English “solicitor”; the circumstance that in Prince Edward Island, as in Delaware, 
“solicitor” is still used in its earlier sense of practitioner in the Court of Chancery ; 
the reference in several provinces to “the degree” of barrister-at-law. In spite of these 
survivals, one and the same person may everywhere, except in the Province of Quebec, 
enjoy all the privileges of legal practice; the integrated title of “barrister and 
solicitor” is in common usage, and corresponds closely to the American “attorney and 
counselor.” 
All these matters are discussed at greater length in the Bulletin Present-Day Law 
Schools.

Recent CHancEs IN Bar Apmission REQUIREMENTS 
At the beginning of the academic year 1925-26, Kansas was still the only state that 
required the equivalent of two years of college work prior to the period of law study. 
A year ago, West Virginia announced a new rule establishing a similar preliminary 
requirement and also refusing credit for office study; this was not in force, however, 
for all applicants beginning their law studies at the date named. The two-year college 
requirement of Illinois, announced even earlier, had likewise not yet taken effect. 
The only changes during the past twelve months, in matters falling within the 
scope of the American Bar Association recommendations, were the following six: 
Arizona has abolished the privilege, hitherto enjoyed by graduates of the local 
law school, of admission to practice without passing the bar examinations. Idaho has 
instituted for the first time a requirement of a definite period of law study, modeled 
upon that of Massachusetts. Maine and Connecticut have also followed Massachusetts 
in lengthening their three-year requirements to four years if the work is done in an 
evening law school. Minnesota has joined the group which require four years for 
work done either in an evening school or in an office; this state has also begun to 
demand a preliminary high school education or its equivalent. New Mexico has 
lengthened its period of law study from two years to three, and requires the appli- 
cant to have secured (though not necessarily before he begins his law studies) the 
equivalent of a high school education. 
A half-dozen other jurisdictions have made some progress. Florida has established 
a State Board of Law Examiners, the members of which, curiously enough, are ap- 
pointed by the governor instead of, as in all other states, by the highest court; this 
Board has taken steps to tighten up the process of admission. Louisiana has dropped 
the registration provision introduced last year, but has strengthened and made more 
precise its requirements in several other particulars. The District of Columbia still 
requires no specific amount of general education; applicants must, however, at least 
state in their verified application blanks what educational advantages they have 
enjoyed, and the quality of their English expression is taken into account in grading 
the papers. Kansas has strengthened its requirements for office students by directing 
such students to follow the State University law course and by calling for semi-annual 
reports from them and their preceptors. Ohio follows the example of several states in 
giving no credit for office work that is pursued concurrently with law school study or 
that is interpolated into law school vacations. Oklahoma has strengthened the admin- 
istration of its requirements. An effort is being made to improve and extend the sys- 
tem of optional bar examinations already in force in certain counties of Indiana. 
During the same twelve months four changes have occurred in Canada: 
In Ontario a temporary rule, permitting deficiencies in general education to be made 
up after the beginning of the period of law study, has lapsed. Beginning with the 
autumn of 1925, the full requirement of not quite one year of college work, first de- 
manded in 1922, must be satisfied before the applicant begins his law studies.
-P-A-G-E-51
  LEGAL EDUCATION 41 
Alberta announces a preliminary requirement of two college years. 
Since the War there has been a rapid development of legal education in the prairie 
provinces. In Saskatchewan, the bar admission system, as the result of improvements 
adopted in December, 1924, has now been perfected to a point beyond which it is 
not likely to proceed for several years, except possibly by an increase in preliminary 
college work above the present figure of one college year or its equivalent. All appli- 
cants must now be graduates of a Canadian law school or of some other law school 
approved by the provincial university; subsequent to graduation, they must serve one 
year in a law office if they are college graduates, and two years if they are not; the 
single bar admission examination is conducted jointly by the university and the Law 
Society, and covers only statutes and court procedure. 
For admission to the Quebec Bar, the statute for some time has called for a pre- 
paratory period of four years, reduced to three years in the case of students who 
complete the course at one of the three local law schools while serving concurrently 
an office clerkship. At the instigation of the McGill University Law Faculty, legis- 
lation has been adopted which permits a third alternative: three years during which 
the student devotes all his energies to securing his law school degree, followed by one 
year devoted entirely to office service. 
EpucationaL RequirREMENTs For ApMission To LecaL Practice 
IN EFFECT FOR THOSE BEGINNING To stupy Law in THE AuTuMN oF 1925 
An attempt to summarize the salient educational features in the bar admission rules 
of the several states first appeared in the Annual Report for 1922. The form that this 
now takes, in the pages that follow, is the result of a process of gradual development. 
This year, for the first time, the survey has been extended to include Canada eer New- 
foundland. Partly for this reason, and partly in response to a suggestion from an 
American examining board, two other innovations have been made. 
Hitherto, in the case of states that prescribe a definite period of law study, the ques- 
tion whether this training must or may be secured in a day law school, or in an even- 
ing law school, or in a law office, or elsewhere, has been answered only when (as, for 
instance, in California) the location of the study affects the length of the period pre- 
scribed, or when (as, for instance, in New Jersey) even applicants who secure the major 
part of their preparation in a law school are required to spend a certain minimum 
period in an office. A separate column has now been added, in which this information 
is given for every state and province. Very commonly in the United States applicants 
are required to secure their legal preparation either entirely in a law school, or partly 
in a law school and partly in a law office, or entirely in an office. For reasons of brevity 
this system is here indicated by the expression “Law school or office,” which is to be 
read as equivalent to “ All law school, or law school and office, or all office.” It will be 
noted that while in many American states the location of the law study is more laxly 
defined, in a few states, and universally in Canada, the requirement is more severe. 
When law school and law office work are combined, the manner in which the student’s 
time must be distributed between the two is then often carefully prescribed. In this
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
digest, however, in order not to confuse the reader with too much detail, this interest- 
ing point is omitted, and only the aggregate length of the period is given. 
The other change has been in the last column, where the original caption, “ Number 
of Law Schools Graduates of which are exempted from Educational Tests,” has been 
changed to read “ Number of Law Schools whose Graduates need be Examined only by 
their own Faculty.” So far as concerns the United States, these two expressions mean 
the same thing. For applicants in general there is always a professional examination, 
in the conduct of which the school faculty does not participate; outside of Indiana 
the only distinction is between states where every applicant (not already admitted 
to practice elsewhere) must submit to this examination, and states where graduates 
of certain law schools are exempted from further educational tests; schools thus fa- 
vored are commonly said to “possess the diploma privilege.” New Brunswick is the 
only Canadian province which has this precise system; it is modified in Alberta by 
participation of the University in the examinations held for other applicants, and 
in Nova Scotia by participation of the Law Society in the University’s own exami- 
nations. Moreover, in Saskatchewan, University and Law Society coéperate in a sin- 
gle examination, for all applicants, that covers only statutes and court procedure; 
and in Ontario and Manitoba, the local law school conducts, for all applicants, the 
more usual uniform set of comprehensive examinations. The changed caption — which 
has the effect of grouping these last two provinces with New Brunswick and Alberta, 
to the exclusion of Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan —is intended to reveal the under- 
lying evil that the Washington Conference on Legal Education had in mind when it 
phrased its condemnation of the diploma privilege in the following terms: 
We agree with the American Bar Association that graduation from a law school 
should not confer the right of admission to the Bar, and that every candidate 
should be subjected to examination by public authority other than the authority 
of the law school of which he is a graduate. 
In so brief a digest it is not possible to include every shade of variation. Every effort 
is made to ensure accuracy of statement within the limits imposed by desirable con- 
ciseness. Suggestions will be welcomed as to how the survey may be made more helpful 
both to prospective law students and to those interested in the administration and 
improvement of the rules.

STANDARDIZING AGENCIES 
Tue American Bar Association, with its “Council on Legal Education and Admis- 
sions to the Bar,” acts as a standardizing agency for the state admitting authori- 
ties, in the sense that it recommends certain standards to their consideration. Stand- 
ardization in the sense of uniformity probably ought not to be sought, and cer- 
tainly is not being achieved. We are not securing even that partial uniformity which 
would spring from a general adoption of these particular standards combined with 
a healthy variation in other respects. The general failure of the states to follow the 
recommendations may be due to the fact that no vigorous campaign has been waged 
in their behalf; or it may be due to the fact that the recommendations themselves 
are not beyond criticism, at least as a goal that can be presently attained. On the 
other hand, it cannot be questioned that the interest displayed by the American Bar 
Association in this subject is resulting in a general improvement in the bar admis- 
sion systems of the country. 
As an agency for exerting moral pressure directly upon law schools, this organi- 
zation shares the field with the Association of American Law Schools. The two As- 
sociations have, however, so far influenced one another that there is now little dis- 
tinction between them, as to matters covered by both. A comparison in parallel 
columns between the standards of the two Associations was first published in the 
Carnegie Foundation Annual Report for 1922, and again in that for 1924. As now 
revised, it includes changes made by the Law School Association at its annual meet- 
ing held in December of that year, and omits matter which became obsolete Septem- 
ber 1, 1925.

A school does not comply with the standards 
unless it complies with all of them and as to all 
its departments or courses. For example, an in- 
stitution maintaining both a day and a night 
school, one of which complies and the other does 
not, cannot be considered as complying. 
A part-time course of at least 160 weeks, cov- 
ering four school years, is the equivalent of a 
three-year, full-time course. This action is the A school whose curriculum and schedule of 
work are so arranged that in the opinion of the 
Executive Committee substantially the full work- 
ing time of its students is not required for the 
work of the school shall be considered a part- 
time school. A part-time school must maintain a 
curriculum which, in the opinion of the Execu- 
tive Committee, is the equivalent of that of a 
full-time school. The action of the Executive 
Committee under this paragraph shall in each 
instance be reported to the Association at its next 
annual meeting and shall stand as the action of 
the Association until set aside by a vote of a ma- 
jority of all the members of the Association.

ceding paragraphs.

to the Bar or for Bar examinations, save in con-

agraphs.

for the use of the students. It shall own a law library of not less than five 
thousand volumes well selected and properly 
housed and administered for the use of its stu- 
dents. 
Faculty 
(d) It shall have among its teachers a sufficient 
number giving their entire time to the school to 
ensure actual personal acquaintance and influ- 
ence with the whole student body. Its faculty shall consist of at least three in- 
structors who devote substantially all of their 
time to the work of the school; and in no case 
shall the number of such full-time instructors be 
fewer than one for each one hundred students or 
major fraction thereof. In determining what is such a sufficient num- 
ber, the Council will ordinarily not approve a 
school where the number of full-time instructors 
is fewer than one for each one hundred students 
or major fraction thereof. 
These standards differ from those recommended to the state admitting authorities 
in that they are already realized in many institutions. Indeed, several law schools have 
advanced far beyond them. There can be no doubt that in the minds of many, at least, 
of those who subscribe to them they constitute a set of minimum qualifications, which 
ought to be found in any law school worthy of the name. The following table shows 
how many law schools are now officially recognized by either (or in most cases by both) 
the Association of American Law Schools or the Council on Legal Education, as 
complying with their standards, and how many schools operate without the approval 
of these organizations.

LEGAL EDUCATION 53 
The Canadian Bar Association was not organized until 1914, and has not been sup- 
plemented by an independent association of law schools. Upon the initiative of school- 
men, the Association adopted resolutions with respect to legal education in 1919, 
1920, and 1923. The resolutions that have had the greatest influence were one 
adopted in 1919, advocating at least one year of preliminary college work (the recom- 
mendation was increased to two years in 1923); and one adopted in 1920 establishing 
a standard curriculum. On the other hand, long discussion in regard to the period of 
law study and its distribution between office and school culminated in 1919 in a reso- 
lution that has been properly ignored in the subsequent development of Canadian 
admission systems. 
LAW SCHOOLS 
As long ago as 1908 the Association of American Law Schools expressed its “earnest 
hope” that ultimately all of its members would require at least two years of prelimi- 
nary college work. Ten years later the American Bar Association registered its “* con- 
viction that this should be the minimum requirement recognized by law schools of the 
first class.” Between 1908 and 1921 the number of full-time law schools meeting this 
standard increased from seven to thirty-one. In the summer of 1921 the American 
Bar Association recommended that admission to the bar be restricted to graduates of 
law schools requiring as a condition of admission at least two years of study in a col- 
lege; and at the close of the same year the Association of American Law Schools voted 
that after September 1, 1925, all of its members must comply with this requirement. 
Sixteen of its members postponed compliance until this date; their action, together 
with that of some six or eight other schools influenced by the same movement, ac- 
counts for the fact that this autumn the number of full-time law schools in the United 
States which require at least two years of college for admission is no less than sixty- 
five. Including part-time and mixed schools, eighty-one out of a total of one hundred 
and sixty-seven law schools now comply, at least nominally, with this standard; 
though, as has been repeatedly stated in these Reports, it is not clear that in all cases 
the equivalent of genuine college work is demanded. 
Stanford and Cornell, in accordance with announcements made last year, require 
this autumn a college degree in the case of applicants from another university. After 
the beginning of the current academic year, Michigan and Southern California re- 
quire three years of college, and Cornell requires a college degree subject to the opera- 
tion of the combined course; Michigan will eventually require the college degree 
subject to a similar qualification, and Stanford will join the group that require a 
college degree from all applicants. A few schools have begun to require a single college 
year, or have lengthened an evening law course from three years to four. New full-time 
law schools have been opened by old William and Mary College and by the Southern 
Methodist University of Dallas, Texas, with entrance requirements respectively of
-P-A-G-E-64
54 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
three and of two college years, and there is a net increase of five in the number of 
part-time or mixed law schools that are listed.’ 
This year, for the first time, the routine tables and lists published in these Re- 
ports include the ten Canadian law schools. Having regard only to those features of 
the schools which are there briefly covered, the principal differences between the two 
countries are these: 
Except in the Province of Quebec, the Law Society requirements as to general 
education are so definite and so high that the schools conform strictly. Elsewhere, 
schoolmen who are interested in improving the system of legal education frequently 
exert themselves to secure an increase that will be applicable to all students prepar- 
ing for admission to practice; they do not, as so often in the United States, demand, 
for admission into their own school, qualifications substantially higher than those 
laid down by the bar admission authorities. 
Evening law schools are not found inthe Dominion. Furthermore, in those schools 
which are here classified as part-time because their sessions are held during other 
than the best working hours of the day, the reason for this classroom schedule is 
usually because under the bar admission rules the student is required to serve a con- 
current clerkship in a law office. Canadian law schools of this description resemble, 
accordingly, our own large-city schools of about a generation ago. Ultimately, fol- 
lowing the collapse of the concurrent office clerkship as a useful educational vehicle, 
these American schools had to choose between the policy of demanding the entire 
time of their students and that of continuing to offer part-time work, not now in 
order to facilitate office training, but for the benefit of self-supporting students. It 
is apparent that in Canada this same problem will soon have to be faced. Even to- 
day some of the students in Canadian part-time schools are not actually in the law 
offices where they are supposed to be; they take advantage of the classroom schedule 
and of the slight requirements in the way of outside preparation to secure employ- 
ment in more lucrative situations. 
For both the United States and Canada the tables immediately following show, 
over a period of years, the number of schools, actual and relative, within each of the 
six broad groups into which they may be conveniently divided, from the point of 
view of the time required to complete the course; and likewise the attendance in each 
of these groups. After this will be found a list of schools in operation during the year 
1925-26, with symbols attached showing the variations in this respect in greater 
detail. Finally, a concluding Summary shows the manner in which these symbols are 
combined to produce the groups as constituted for this year.

Resrpentrat Law Scuoots 1s Operation, 1925-26 
The following list of law schools appears in form similar to that employed in suc- 
cessive Annual Reports, beginning with that published in 1920. The conventional 
symbols attached to each school measure roughly the extent of its prima facie com- 
pliance with the three standards, affecting the amount of time devoted by students 
to their work, that have been formulated by the American Bar Association. That is 
to say, the roman numerals show the minimum number of college years that are re- 
quired for admission to regular standing as candidate for a degree, without regard 
to the important complications produced by the admission of special students, etc., 
or of regular students with entrance conditions. An asterisk means that a college 
degree is required for admission; in the case of the two French-speaking Canadian 
schools, this symbol is included in parentheses to indicate that an examination may 
be substituted. The letter M (morning) denotes that classroom sessions preémpt the 
best working hours of the day, and that therefore students are, or may be, required 
to devote to their studies all of their time not needed for necessary recreation; while 
the letters A (afternoon, including early morning) and E (evening) denote that class- 
room sessions are held at other hours, more generally convenient for self-supporting 
students, or (in Canada) for those who serve a concurrent office clerkship. The arabic 
numerals show the minimum duration of the law school course, in academic years or 
their equivalent. When separate divisions are conducted at different hours of the day, 
the requirements for each are stated in full, separated by commas. In all cases the 
oe denote the requirements in force for those who entered the regular first-year 
class at the beginning of the autumn term of 1925. Announcements of subsequent 
changes, or courses continued for the benefit of students already enrolled, are not 
included. 
In parentheses, schools members of the Association of American Law Schools at 
the beginning of this academic year are marked (s); schools fully approved by the 
Council on Legal Education of the American Bar Association at the same date are 
marked (c). 
In the United States the list is restricted to schools that confer first degrees in 
law, because of the practical impossibility of drawing any other objective line be- 
tween a “law school” and a fleeting “law class” conducted by one or more attorneys.

THE AMERICAN LAW INSTITUTE 
Tue American Law Institute, organized in the spring of 1928 primarily for the pur- 
pose of making a comprehensive restatement of substantive law,’ assumed, at its last 
meeting, the additional responsibility of preparing a model code of criminal pro- 
cedure, for submission to the state legislatures. This undertaking is of the greater 
interest because of the subsequent organization, outside the legal profession, of an 
ambitiously conceived National Crime Commission, having for its object the decreas- 
ing of crimes of violence. Doubtless some effort will be made to secure codperation be- 
tween the two organizations. Should this not be attained, there is little doubt that 
the lawyers will be criticised by the laymen as betraying characteristic inability to 
deal vigorously even with an evil of acknowledged magnitude. Such an outcome would 
not be undesirable. The fact that the legal profession, through one of its representative 
organs, does not specifically endorse a proposed measure of reform, need not check 
discussion of the merits of the proposal by the public at large. On the other hand, 
if any suggested changes in our traditional methods of administering justice win the 
endorsement of so conservative a body as the American Law Institute, a strong pre- 
sumption as to their wisdom will have been established. 
The preparation of this model code is financed out of an independent endowment, 
and is an enterprise of an entirely different character from that which engages the main 
energies of the Institute. It involves not merely details that must be left to techni- 
cians, but also broader questions of social policy, in which the public at large may 
or may not regard lawyers as trustworthy guides. On the other hand, the restatement 
of substantive law is a purely technical task, the responsibility for which rests squarely 
upon the legal profession. Our system of forty-nine mutually independent courts of last 
resort has produced a morass of conflicting precedents from which judges and lawyers 
are now trying to extricate themselves. The function of the public can only be to wel- 
come and to support a plan to accomplish this end that has been intelligently con- 
ceived and is now being conscientiously executed. 
One of the wise decisions that was made, after some hesitation, at the organiza- 
tion meeting of the Institute, was that the membership at large should not exhaust 
its powers in the selection of a relatively small and stable Council. Although the 
restatements are to be prepared, in the first instance, by legal experts who work under 
the supervision of the Council, the entire Institute is to be given an opportunity to 
express its judgment as to their value. In spite of the paramount advantages of this 
policy as a means for stimulating and maintaining general interest in the work, 
there are obvious drawbacks in a scheme of organization that makes it possible for 
large bodies to discuss small details. The third annual meeting of the Institute, held 
in Washington May 1 and 2, 1925, was therefore of special interest, in that for the 
first time drafts of portions of three restatements were submitted to the members for 
118 Annual Report, Carnegie Foundation, 1928, 62 (Pamphlet reprint, p. 22). 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
66 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
criticism. It should be a source of great encouragement that this meeting was largely 
attended, and that the criticism was abundant but not captious nor intemperate. 
Most of the queries were answered to the satisfaction of their proponents. There 
was, moreover, a healthy residuum of suggestions which the scholars responsible for 
the respective restatements took under advisement. If they are as successful in pre- 
serving open minds as the rank and file of the membership were modest in present- 
ing their views, the policy of general discussion will do more than stimulate and 
maintain interest in the work of the Institute. It will make the restatements approach 
even more nearly than in their present form to that degree of superlative excellence 
that all would like to see attained. It is of course recognized that there is a point 
beyond which any individual scholar is incapable of considering a multiplicity of 
suggestions without growing stale, and that in order to complete an undertaking of 
this magnitude he must ultimately close his mind somewhere this side of theoretic 
perfection. 
To one layman, whose happy ignorance of the technical law administered by the 
courts has never deterred him from writing around and about law and the legal pro- 
fession, two points of general interest emerged from the detailed discussion. 
First, that while it is perfectly well understood that the object of the restatements 
is not to suggest new law where considerations of social expediency are in any way 
involved, but simply to declare the preferable rule among conflicting precedents that 
already exist, it is not entirely clear whether the Institute should regard itself as 
debarred from filling in purely casual or accidental gaps in the network of legal 
relations. Its work will not be authoritative if it endorses a novel, or even a highly 
debatable, principle of social control. Where, however, a principle is already definitely 
established as applicable to one set of facts or relationships, and every consideration 
of logic or analogy suggests that it be extended to another set, should the Institute 
decline to extend it simply because this precise point has not arisen in any decided 
case? To judge by the tenor of the discussion, no authoritative and generally accepted 
decision seems yet to have been made in regard to this question. 
The other point involves the arrangement of the separate propositions or rules of 
law after they have been ascertained. Much thought is being given to other impor- 
tant considerations of form — to classification, in the sense of a blocking out of the 
law into a few main divisions, each of sufficient inner coherence to constitute separate 
units in the final scheme—and to the extremely vexatious subject of precise and uni- 
form terminology. A quite different problem is the proper sequence or ordering of 
the subject matter within each of its main divisions. In no one of the three partial 
drafts submitted to the last meeting does the interior organization of the material 
justify itself on its face as unquestionably the best that could be made from the point 
of view either of logical analysis or of convenience of reference. 
These two points represent really only different aspects of one and the same dif- 
ficulty, inherent in the very nature of the project. This fundamental difficulty is that
-P-A-G-E-77
LEGAL EDUCATION 67 
the common law, which is now being restated, has not itself developed symmetrically 
on the lines of any schematic arrangement, but has budded and sprouted like an organ- 
ism. A forest of judicial decisions, for the very reason that it is a forest, cannot be con- 
verted into a legal web of satisfactorily systematic design. A restatement that shall 
be perfect as regards either completeness or logical sequence is impossible, even as an 
ideal ; only experiment can decide which of two or more concededly imperfect presen- 
tations of the law is on the whole preferable. These observations are accordingly made, 
not for the purpose of questioning the value of the undertaking or the care with which 
it is being prosecuted, but as a warning against extravagant expectations and de- 
mands, If the individual propositions are accurately stated, the work will be success- 
ful. It will be a matter of relatively little moment if some system-mad critic finds that 
its arrangement is bad. Indeed, it would probably be well that legal scholars should 
confine their energies, so far as possible, to that portion of the task for which alone 
their training specially qualifies them. The more saturated they are in the traditions 
of the common law, the less importance are they likely to attach to its presentation 
in systematic form. To the extent that some degree of system is desirable, any literary 
tinker can subsequently provide this quality better than they can. 
In conclusion, a word as to the interest that the work of the American Law In- 
stitute may have for Canadian practitioners and scholars. As a model for them to 
follow it has no significance. Our American Bar Association has been paralleled by 
their Canadian Bar Association, and our Conference of Commissioners on Uniform 
State Laws by their Conference of Commissioners on Uniformity of Legislation in 
Canada. But for the purpose of promoting uniformity of judicial decisions, they stand 
in need of no such cumbersome palliative as the American Law Institute is under- 
taking to provide. Their system of general judicial appeal from the provincial courts 
to the Supreme Court of Canada accomplishes for them all that the Institute can ever 
hope to accomplish for us, and accomplishes it a great deal more simply and directly. 
On the other hand, the actual output of the Institute may have almost as much 
value to Canadian judges and practitioners as to our own in that it will make our 
law accessible to them. Theoretically, of course, American decisions can be appropri- 
ately cited in Canadian courts in the same manner that theirs have persuasive au- 
thority in our own. Actually, the multiplicity of our decisions discourages Canadians 
from paying much attention to them. Only a single one of their ten law schools makes 
any serious effort to carry on its shelves the Reports of the United States Supreme 
Court and of a few important states. Publication, in convenient form, of what may 
appropriately be characterized as “standard” American law, will tend to add to our 
list of exportable commodities.

THE STUDY OF DENTAL EDUCATION 
A. Recent DevELopMENTS 
N furtherance of the plan of procedure outlined in previous Annual Reports, den- 
tal schools were revisited during the year, and forecasts of the general findings 
presented and discussed at meetings of various educational associations and societies 
of dental practitioners. The study is about to be concluded, but improvements that it 
has stimulated continue to develop. Chief of these during the year was the conversion 
of additional independent dental schools into integral parts of universities, the Indi- 
ana Dental College, the New York College of Dentistry, and the School of Dentistry 
of the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario having become the Dental Schools 
of Indiana University, New York University, and the University of Toronto, respec- 
tively. The important question whether independent dental schools will continue to 
interfere with the development of dental education has been answered in the nega- 
tive. In Canada all of the dental schools now are integral parts of universities. Of 
the forty-three dental schools in the United States, only six remain independent, of 
which three are proprietary. 
During the past four years the number of dental schools in the United States 
decreased in number from forty-six to forty-three, by union of two independent 
schools with university schools and the discontinuance of a Class C school, but the 
Dental School of the University of Rochester, about to begin its first year, will raise 
the existing number to forty-four. The requirement for admission to the Rochester 
School will be three years of approved work in an accredited academic college, as 
for medicine. This is the highest entrance requirement for dentistry in the United 
States and in respect of time equals that at the University of Montreal, beginning in 
1925-26, which is the highest in Canada. Since 1918 the University of Alberta has 
conducted a pre-clinical Department of Dentistry, but next fall its curriculum will be 
extended to include all of the clinical requirements for the degree of D.D.S., which 
will probably be conferred for the first time in 1927. This development will increase 
from four to five the number of complete undergraduate dental schools in Canada. 
A gift of $4,233,000, by Mrs. Montgomery Ward, has enabled Northwestern Uni- 
versity to begin the construction of an exceptional building for its Medical and Den- 
tal Schools, which, now widely separated, will become closely codrdinated. The Dental 
School will occupy about two-fifths of the total floor area.

  THE STUDY OF DENTAL EDUCATION 69 
a. Vital relationships of the teeth 
The traditional indifference of physicians to the preservation of the teeth, and to 
the prevention or cure of dental diseases, has long been an anomaly of the practice 
of medicine. If normal teeth were merely inert masses ot stone, like pieces of marble 
which they outwardly resemble, or if they were devoid of vital codrdinations with the 
tissues that hold them in place, their neglect by medicine might not be difficult to 
understand; but they are living parts of an animate human body, perform various im- 
portant functions, and, from infancy to senility, by becoming deficient or undergoing 
deterioration, may occasion distress, disability, or death. Normal teeth take their 
positions in the jaws, in the temporary set and then in the superseding permanent 
series, through long periods of intermittent discomfort and pain, as if Nature herself, 
by slow and insistent procedures of construction and alignment, were according them 
unusual attention and care, and giving to each tooth exceptional preparation for the 
performance of special duties. 
That this figurative allusion is not misleading is shown by the variety of the func- 
tions of the teeth. The broadest physiological aspects of the processes of dentition are 
not indicated by the normal outcome, but are fully revealed by the consequences of 
abnormal production or disposition of individual teeth, or of groups or sets of teeth, 
which include such serious local derangements or general disorders as malformation 
of the skull, disfigurement of the face, disturbance of the senses, impairment of the 
functions of the nervous system, and maladjustment of various systemic balances. As 
initial mechanical factors in normal nutrition, the teeth are useful preliminary agents 
for its promotion in every part of the body. Mastication prepares solid masses of food 
for thorough mixture with saliva, for comfortable swallowing, and for ready diges- 
tion, and also facilitates ample production and timely delivery of digestive juices. 
Comeliness of countenance is enhanced or impaired by the processes that develop the 
dentition or by the condition of the teeth, and speech or song may be seriously af- 
fected by loss or imperfection of individual teeth or by irregularity in their positions 
and adjustments. The tissues in immediate contact with the teeth may become defi- 
cient or be destroyed, and the teeth detached; and fatal diseases may arise in various 
parts of the body from infections originating in the teeth or in the closely surround- 
ing structures. Measured by the diversity and import of these vital relationships, it 
would seem to be obvious that a policy of health service that does not include preven- 
tion of the developmental abnormalities of the teeth and jaws, or which ignores oral 
hygiene, or disregards dental maladies, and then indifferently extracts teeth when they 
become deficient, cannot be expected to commend itself to enlightened public opinion. 
6b. Prevalence of dental and oral disorders 
Dental deficiencies and oral abnormalities have never been more prevalent among 
civilized peoples than they are to-day, and the consequent need for effectual oral 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  70 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
health service never was more urgent. Malformations of the jaws and ailments of the 
oral tissues are common. The boy or girl whose teeth are entirely free from decay is 
unusual ; and the young man or woman without decayed teeth, or from whom teeth 
have not been extracted, or who has not had teeth filled, crowned, or replaced, is very 
hard to find. At middle age, disease of the tissues that surround the teeth is a usual 
experience; in old age, sound natural teeth are uncommon; and at all ages many per- 
sons suffer from infectious disorders that follow admission of germs through defective 
dental tissues. The teeth are more frequently affected injuriously, more apt to be- 
come defective beyond the possibility of successful curative treatment, and more com- 
monly eliminated by surgical intervention, than any other portions of the organism. 
The occurrence of dental disorders would be distressingly evident everywhere were 
it not for the achievements of dentistry in retarding the progress of disintegration 
of individual teeth or in disguising the effects of their loss. No other part of the 
body can be so effectually repaired or so satisfactorily restored by artificial means, 
both mechanically and functionally, as a tooth or the teeth collectively. Because the 
normal enamel is practically lifeless and the adjacent dentine very nearly inanimate, 
these exterior portions of a tooth may be removed and replaced without damage to 
the rest of its structure and without impairment of the vitality or utility of the tooth 
as repaired. These conditions enable dentistry to achieve its distinctive successes in 
arresting processes of decay, in artistically replacing the dental structure that may 
be thus destroyed, and in preserving the remainders. Fully formed teeth do not ap- 
pear to produce anything that, passing from them, is useful in any other part of the 
body, and they do not improve their physiological qualities with age or acquire any 
vicarious responsibilities. Therefore, since the uses of the teeth are essentially physical, 
and their masses and relationships comparatively stable, artificial substitutes for lost 
teeth may be fitted comfortably and safely, and made not only functionally adequate 
but also esthetically superior. Such substitutes now hide dental deficiencies in an 
increasing proportion of the population. 
The most common of the important bodily defects among civilized peoples is dental 
decay, which, besides causing disintegration of the affected part of a tooth, may, if 
it proceeds far enough, also occasion serious or fatal systemic infection. Dentistry 
has become remarkably proficient in arresting the progress of decay, when practi- 
tioners are visited early enough to enable them to intervene in time, but, despite the 
great importance of precluding the initiation of decay and the passage of microérgan- 
isms through the dental enamel, neither dentistry nor medicine has learned how to 
prevent the general incidence of decay, or to halt the advance lines of infection through 
adecayed tooth, or with certainty todestroy all the organismsat the apex of an infected 
root, or to restore the health of the tissues about an apex where an infection has oc- 
curred. Dentistry and medicine are also unable to obviate the general occurrence of 
disease in the tissues that surround the root of a tooth and which, after their de- 
generation, permit bacteria to pass along the surface toward the apical region, and
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE STUDY OF DENTAL EDUCATION 71 
cause loosening and possibly loss of the tooth. In each of these types of pathological 
change, the vitality of the pulp is ultimately destroyed, and the tooth fails to receive 
the physical, chemical, and nervous influences that maintain its health. 
c. Serious deficiencies of oral health service 
1. Uncertainty regarding adequate treatment of dental infections 
The proper treatment of a tooth having an infected pulp and apex presents a series 
of very perplexing problems. The practice of dentistry and the practice of medicine 
meet on this common ground, but with conflicting views and contrary procedures. It is 
believed by physicians generally, and by some dentists also, that a tooth thus affected 
in any degree is powerless to destroy the invading germs, and cannot, by any thera- 
peutic method, be reliably freed therefrom; that the organisms about the apex of a 
root of such a tooth cannot be destroyed by treatment applied through the root 
canals; that the unremoved bacteria may or probably will continue to be or become a 
focus of secondary infection of other parts of the body; and that the only sure way to 
prevent the development of an impending serious systemic disturbance is to extract 
the tooth and by suitable supplementary measures to eliminate all the threatening 
microédrganisms. On the other side of the disagreement, it is believed by dentists 
generally, and by some physicians also, that infections of a tooth, and of the tissues 
about its roots, when these tissues have not been destroyed beyond their powers of 
recuperation, can usually be completely removed or isolated by suitable operative and 
therapeutic measures; that as a rule such a tooth, if properly treated, can be rendered 
non-septic for the rest of the body and restored to usefulness; that its retention after 
successful treatment does not constitute a menace to the patient’s health; and that 
under these conditions, extraction of the affected tooth is not necessary to saféguard 
the health of the patient. 
From every humanitarian point of view it is to be hoped that the more conservative 
position of the dentists is wholly correct, but unhappily this important disagreement is 
based upon a number of premises on either side that have not been established conclu- 
sively by investigation and are rendered more or less dubious by contradictory clinical 
evidence. Meanwhile the triumphs of partisanships often sacrifice the welfare of pa- 
tients. The removal of the ignorance on which this difference of opinion is founded is 
a task that is worthy of the united efforts of able representatives of dentistry and of 
medicine; and basic research in this field, through cordial codperation of qualified in- 
vestigators in universities having medical and dental schools, with intent solely to as- 
certain the whole truth, is one of the most urgent needs of clinical dentistry and of oral 
medicine. Pending the establishment of solid foundations for the treatment of dental 
infections that will enable dentistry and medicine to agree on both facts and proced- 
ures, it will be impossible for dentistry to render scientific service in this important 
aspect of its duty, and dental teachers will continue to flounder in their instruction  
-P-A-G-E-82
  
  72 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
in this field, In this situation, tragic in its possibilities for many individuals, the 
serious predicament of the laity should appeal strongly to those who are able and in- 
clined to endow research for the promotion of health service. Thorough study of this 
problem under favorable conditions, while humanity awaits the discovery of means 
of preventing dental infections, promises to yield results of immediate importance 
for the relief of thousands in whom pulpless teeth are objects of present uncertainty 
or concern, or are possible causes of progressive or impending systemic disease. 
2. Failure in prevention of dental disorders 
Heretofore the practice of dentistry, exclusive of cleaning and extraction, has con- 
sisted chiefly of the realignment of teeth, arrest of processes of dental decay and 
repair of the damages, treatment of dental and periodontal infections, replacement 
of the main parts of lost teeth, and surgical operations on the jaws and oral tissues. 
All of these procedures are effectual for the maintenance of the dental functions, and 
each is an important phase of grateful service for the protection, comfort, and content- 
ment of the patient. Although dentistry has been endeavoring, also, to devise ways 
and means to prevent dental and oral abnormalities, little has been accomplished 
beyond improvements of time-honored methods of cleaning teeth and additions to 
the common knowledge that teeth and jaws cannot grow normally in embryo or in 
childhood, and the surrounding tissues cannot be kept healthy after maturity, on a 
diet that is insufficient to maintain normal general nutrition. The new information 
on these aspects of oral hygiene has increased dentistry’s ability to postpone the oc- 
currence or to retard the progress of various dental and oral deficiencies, but the goal 
of true prevention has not been attained, for these disorders frequently occur in 
mouths that receive special hygienic attention and in persons whose diet keeps them 
well nourished. 
Overemphasis on these two phases of preventive control of dental and oral abnor- 
malities has been tending lately to develop illusory views on the nature of the main 
problems awaiting solution. When a tooth is inherently defective at a given point 
or abnormally disposed in a manner or to a degree that favors the local action of the 
ubiquitous microérganisms, and the tooth is thoroughly scrubbed at that place sev- 
eral times a day with dentifrice and brush in the customary manner, requiring even 
for the most fastidious less than a total of five minutes for any one location, then, 
however thorough the cleansing operation may be, closure of the mouth and adjust- 
ment of the oral parts to their usual contacts ensure immediate return of myriads 
of active organisms to that surface. Under such conditions, thorough washing of that 
particular spot could hardly do more than intermittently retard a process that would 
be bound to continue there to some extent during the remaining twenty-three hours 
and fifty-five minutes of the day. After microérganisms pass slightly beneath the sur- 
face of the enamel ata given position into the channels open to their advance, cleansing 
of the tooth on that area with brush and dentifrice, or with other devices in the usual 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE STUDY OF DENTAL EDUCATION 73 
way, might not even dislodge the most dangerously situated individual organisms, 
however smooth the surface over them might feel, or however clean and polished it 
might appear; and the process of decay would continue with little or no interruption. 
There is no known hygienic way of destroying all of the microérganisms in the oral 
cavity at any time or of preventing the immediate return of bacteria from the out- 
side; and in the mouth, where such organisms grow rapidly in the presence of residues 
of food, they promptly induce destructive fermentation. Under these conditions, 
brushing the teeth is analogous in its sanitary effect to that of bathing the body. 
Desirable as both these cleansing processes are for a variety of important hygienic 
reasons, neither can prevent the development of disorders caused by microdrganisms 
that cannot thus be removed or that readily regain access to favorable positions dur- 
ing the intervals between the cleansing operations. 
To some it appears that ingestion of sufficient amounts of a balanced diet auto- 
matically brings about the production and maintenance of perfect teeth and thereby 
the prevention of oral abnormality, although there is no evidence to show that a per- 
fect tooth will not decay, for example, under oral conditions that may favor special 
bacterial attack, or even that ingestion of good food in proper kinds and amounts 
throughout the whole of the period of growth ensures normal formation of anything. 
Supplies of food, when eaten, are merely subservient units of construction in coérdi- 
nated processes of building and repair. It is a matter of common observation, to illus- 
trate familiar anomalies, that of two children in a family subsisting on practically the 
same adequate diet, and eating sufficient amounts of the kinds of food required for 
normal development, one child may grow rapidly and have a large skeleton and excel- 
lent teeth, while the other may grow slowly and have a small frame and poor teeth. If 
good food in ample amounts were the only physiological desideratum, such differences 
among well-fed children would not occur. No one would assume that the way to erect a 
building is to dig a basement and then unload into it, helter-skelter, all of the mortar, 
stone, brick, steel, and other materials that are needed, in the expectation that these 
things will put themselves in order. The building rises when it is erected by workers 
laboring, more or less faithfully, under directions for the consummation of a plan. 
When at least the minimum amount of each kind of required material is available, 
the building acquires a size, shape, and stability that are dependent upon the coér- 
dinating influences and upon the responses of the workers. In the search for the secrets 
of prevention of dental diseases the facts pertaining to methods of cleaning the teeth, 
and to dietetics from the dental standpoint, cannot be too fully elaborated and clari- 
fied; but, in the quest for additional details in these obvious phases of the problem, 
more profound relationships and more elusive facts should not lack the attention that 
their paramount importance suggests. Thus, physiological coérdinations between 
glandular activities or nervous influences and dentition, which are involved in the 
development of the teeth and jaws and in the secretion of oral fluids, on variable plans 
in different individuals, constitute a field where future discovery awaits research by
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
intimate application of the medical sciences to the needs of dental practice. Here 
again itis accordingly probable that results of fundamental importance will be forth- 
coming as soon as effectual collaboration between able investigators in associated 
medical and dental schools can be instituted. 
d. Main requirements for the improvement of oral health service 
1. Practice 
The keys to progress in dentistry arethe practitioner who serves the patient directly, 
the teacher who instructs and trains the practitioner, and the investigator who ex- 
tends the knowledge on which most of the improvements in practice and teaching 
depend. 
The practice of dentistry has been progressive in the mechanical procedures of re- 
pair, restoration, and replacement, but has been backward in its attention to the 
biological aspects of prevention and therapeutics. These added requirements cannot 
be met by dentistry until its practice becomes the full service equivalent of an oral 
specialty of the practice of medicine at its best. In attaining its remarkable mechani- 
cal successes, dentistry developed aptitudes and interests which, by focusing attention 
upon procedures of reparation, also induced disregard for its greatest opportunities 
in health service. The average dental practitioner has had a poor education in the 
medical sciences, and finds it difficult either to apply them in his practice or to keep 
himself informed as to the main features of their growth. Few dentists have had the 
type of education that develops capacity and inclination for the serious and continual 
study of scientific literature which the progressive practice of a profession requires. As 
a consequence many use antiquated methods of practice, or uncritically or casually 
adopt new procedures that appeal empirically, or have nothing to commend them 
beyond persuasive demonstration by salesmen or plausible advertisement by manu- 
facturers. In accordance with these evidences of lack of professional spirit or of the 
understanding that education affords, a large number of practitioners use various 
patented therapeutic products regarding the true nature and properties of which 
they know little or nothing, and to this extent practise superficially and unprofes- 
sionally. The Journal of the American Dental Association, which represents the or- 
ganized dental profession in the United States, helps to maintain these conditions 
by publishing advertisements of such products. 
In discussing the prevailing critical attitude of medicine toward dentistry, physi- 
cians whose judgment is accorded universal respect often justify their want of con- 
fidence in individual dentists, and in certain relationships of organized dentistry, by 
pointing out that dental practitioners freely use patented therapeutic products of 
doubtful value; permit manufacturers to finance many professional projects; make 
important regular meetings of practitioners adjuncts to commercial exhibits; encour-
-P-A-G-E-85
THE STUDY OF DENTAL EDUCATION 5 
age the continuance of a system of supply-house journalism that is so obviously 
mercenary that sometimes its issues cannot be distributed in the mails at the reduced 
postal rates accorded to professional literature; elect to positions of honor, in profes- 
sional organizations, beneficiaries of the sale of patented therapeutic products, stock- 
holders of proprietary dental schools, and other industrial emissaries; and in sundry 
ways seem to proclaim unabashed that they regard dentistry as a trade and a business 
rather than as a profession. So long as dental practitioners as a body continue to show 
such partialities or indifference to commercialism in their professional affairs, it will be 
impossible for medicine and dentistry to attain that accord which the highest develop- 
ment of oral health service requires, and which must be based on the mutual respect of 
its practitioners. Fortunately, discontent with commercial domination of the affairs of 
dental practitioners is growing apace; and the prospective elevation of dental educa- 
tion to a plane of equality with that of medicine, with its collateral tendencies to reduce 
the proportion of the professionally unfit, to raise the degree of self-respect of practi- 
tioners, and to stimulate the growth of ideals of service, promises an end of the com- 
mercial régime in organized dentistry. 
2. Education 
The proper training of the practitioner is a matter of prime importance. That he 
should be an educated man, with a background of culture and refinement, is as essen- 
tial for the dentist as for the physician; and that his professional training should give 
him a true medical comprehension of his duties, as well as mechanical facility and 
esthetic felicity in their execution, is equally obvious. In educational quality and influ- 
ence, dental schools should equal medical schools, for their responsibilities are similar 
and their tasks are analogous, and the dental graduate should be the peer of the medi- 
cal graduate in character, self-respect, and professional ability. Elevation of the qual- 
ity of dental education is an obligation of those universities in which dental schools 
are now situated, and new dental schools should be created in some of the universities 
that contain medical schools but in which dentistry has not hitherto been taught. 
Dental faculties should be able to show the need in medical schools for integrated 
instruction in the general principles of clinical dentistry and in its correlation with 
clinical medicine, and should codperate in teaching stomatology to medical students. 
Proprietary dental schools no longer command public confidence or respect, and non- 
proprietary independent dental schools will soon be unable to meet the most impor- 
tant educational obligations resting upon them. The early union of these schools with 
universities, or their discontinuance, is clearly foreshadowed. 
Everywhere education is chiefly what the teacher makes it. The most important 
immediate need in allof the dental schools is a much larger proportion of able, devoted, 
and inspiring teachers. All desirable early improvements in dental education would 
follow their advent. Funds sufficient to enable the schools to pay adequate salaries
-P-A-G-E-86
  
  716 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
must be provided, and suitable means devised for the selection and training of the 
most competent prospective teachers, to strengthen dental education at the point of 
its greatest weakness. 
3. Research 
In the mechanical aspects of dentistry, including the refinement of materials and 
methods, and the invention of useful devices, research has been productive of very 
great advancement, but in the discovery of essentials for the prevention of dental 
and oral maladies or for the cure of infectious disorders, dental research has been de- 
ficient. Most of the research in dentistry has been conducted under commercial influ- 
ences, and relatively little has been attempted in dental schools or universities. Com- 
pared with the activity in original investigation in medical schools, research in dental 
schools is weak and uninspired. This is a natural concomitant of a system of instruc- 
tion that is dependent chiefly upon the casual work of part-time practitioners whose 
main interests are not in teaching and research, The secrets of the means for the pre- 
vention of dental and oral abnormalities may remain hidden indefinitely unless dental 
schools actively institute a search for them, and find the minds and obtain the resources 
with which to promote adequate enquiry. Most of the universities have been indiffer- 
ent to this situation because dental faculties have failed to show the urgency of bio- 
logical research for the promotion of dentistry. 
e. Public responsibility for further development of dentistry 
As an important mode of health service dentistry is regulated everywhere by law. 
The public, appreciating the value of the learned and skilful practice of oral health 
service, seeks by statutory means to prevent incompetent individuals from engaging 
in it, and employs suitable agencies to protect itself against the consequences of mal- 
practice. In some states and provinces in North America public resources are used to 
provide dental service and to promote the education of practitioners, but most com- 
munities leave to individuals or institutions the opportunity and the obligation to ad- 
vance dentistry, which heretofore has been promoted mainly from funds supplied by 
dentists themselves or from profits derived from dental enterprises. Although the pub- 
lic, the main beneficiary, has given little attention to the possibilities of improved 
oral health service, it should realize that the universities are greatly in need of per- 
manent funds for the furtherance of dental research. It is absolutely essential that 
the development of dentistry be projected through enquiry in the field of prevention, 
yet important progress will be impossible without adequate financial support. The 
opportunities for disinterested service in this relation, for the betterment of the 
health of individuals and communities, are exceptional.

J. General conclusions 
The present study appears to have justified the foregoing views and the following 
general conclusions: 
Dentistry is an important mode of health service that is related directly to the 
teeth and closely adjacent oral tissues, and indirectly to other parts of the body and to 
the organism in general. 
Dentistry should be made the full equivalent of an oral specialty of the practice of 
medicine in the quality and efficiency of its service to the patient. 
The unusual mechanical and esthetic demands upon dentistry have, however, fully 
justified and continue to require its active development as a separately organized pro- 
fession. 
The long continued indifference of medicine to the abnormalities and diseases of 
the teeth and oral tissues suggests that, if dentistry were called stomatology and 
added to medicine, oral health service would continue to be neglected by the medical 
profession. 
The success with which dentists have brought dentistry to its present state of use- 
fulness and opportunity, in the face of social disparagement and professional belittle- 
ment, and the strength of the evolution plainly in progress, indicate unmistakably 
that the leadership of the dental profession will develop dentistry to its full possi- 
bilities in health service. 
Dentistry can be effectually and economically developed to the full service equiv- 
alence of an oral specialty of the practice of medicine through extension and im- 
provement, in universities, of that system of dental education which, though separate 
from medical education, is closely related to it and should be more intimately asso- 
ciated with it. 
This extension and improvement could be accomplished without requiring the 
prospective general practitioner of dentistry to become a doctor of medicine before 
beginning his dental training, and could best be brought about by pursuit of the 
following three main objectives : (a) the preliminary education and the instruction 
in the medical sciences should be the same in general scope and quality as for medi- 
cine; (0) the technical training, the applications of the medical sciences, and the cor- 
relations with clinical medicine should be sufficient to assure both ability to initiate 
safely a dependable general practice of dentistry and capacity to grow in proficiency; 
and (c) the most difficult phases of dental practice should be reserved for systematic 
graduate study. 
These three objectives could be attained through the requirement of (a) at least two 
years of approved work in an accredited academic college, including several courses 
that would stimulate interest and develop ability in the prospective practice of den- 
tistry, or reveal ineptitude, (b) and three years of intensive and well-integrated effort 
in an undergraduate dental curriculum for the training of general practitioners only,
-P-A-G-E-88
78 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
some or all of the years to be suitably lengthened wherever desirable to meet special 
local requirements; followed by (c) optional supplementary full-year graduate cur- 
ricula for advanced training in all types of dental and oral specialization. 
Such a reorganization would place physicians and dentists on the same plane of 
intellectual quality, and would give them analogous types of health-service education. 
It would develop similar degrees of medical comprehension, ensure mutual respect 
and understanding, and facilitate intimate coperation in the promotion of the wel- 
fare of their patients. 
This general improvement in dental education would require reconstruction of the 
dental curriculum, with special reference to important betterment of the teaching in 
all of its phases, economy of time without impairment of the efficiency of instruction 
in dental technology, more useful application of the medical sciences, and more ad- 
vantageous correlation of clinical dentistry with clinical medicine. 
The proposed regeneration of dental education would necessitate, in practically 
all of the dental schools, prompt increase in the number of teachers of the best type, 
great improvement of the libraries, and active advancement of research. 
Lacking endowments, and in most cases being obliged to keep the quality of their 
work to the level of their income from fees, the dental schools in this country and 
in Canada will be unable to proceed with the suggested improvements unless, individ- 
ually, they receive large gifts of funds for this purpose. 
C. Action TAKEN ON THE ProposEp Pian For THE REORGANIZATION OF 
Denrat Epucation 
In October, 1924, at a conference of representatives of twenty-three of the thirty- 
three university dental schools in the United States, a majority formally endorsed 
the “two-three-graduate plan” — the phrase currently used to designate the coér- 
dination of a two-year academic curriculum, a three-year undergraduate sien 
curriculum, and elective full-year graduate curricula. 
In its Annual Report for 1924, issued last November, the Dental Educational 
Council of America recommended that “hearty support should be given to a trial of 
the two-three-graduate plan.” At a meeting in May, 1925, the Council adopted the 
following related resolution: 
“The Council cordially endorses the Carnegie Foundation’s formal conclusion 
(Annual Report, 1924) that dentistry is an independent division of health service 
which is attaining the full equivalence of an oral specialty of medicine, and 
commends these views of the Foundation to the attention of the public and of 
the medical and dental professions.” 
The Faculties of the Dental Schools of Marquette University and of the Univer- 
sities of Michigan, Minnesota, and Pittsburgh have voted to reorganize their cur- 
ricula in conformity with the two-three-graduate plan. Marquette and Pittsburgh
-P-A-G-E-89
THE STUDY OF DENTAL EDUCATION 79 
will inaugurate the plan in 1925-26, and Michigan and Minnesota in 1926-27. The 
Michigan dental statute was amended recently to facilitate this change at the State 
University. 
D. Tue Enp or rue Proprierary Ricme in Dentat Epucation 
Commercial influences long controlled the progress of dental education. In recent 
years the conversion of independent dental schools into integral parts of universi- 
ties, including several affiliations that are steps toward organic union, has been one 
of the most striking as well as beneficent developments in dentistry. This evolution has 
been brought about by a general change in dental public opinion and by the attitude 
of the Dental Educational Council in enforcing with increasing sincerity its standing 
regulation to give the Class C rating to schools that are conducted for profit to indi- 
viduals or to corporations. 
Of the six remaining independent schools, in a total of forty-three dental schools 
in the United States, four have endeavored to enter organic union with universities, 
but local difficulties thus far have been insurmountable. Of the six independent 
schools, three are proprietary, but of the latter, the school in Atlanta is about to 
become non-proprietary. The remaining two, the Cincinnati College of Dental Sur- 
gery and the Texas (Houston) Dental College, are Class C schools. Despite their 
educational and professional inferiority, these two schools continue under the pro- 
tection of the respective state boards, the members of which do not seem to realize 
that the maintenance of such schools threatens the welfare of the citizens that the 
boards officially represent. The support given to these commercial schools by the 
state boards not only is inimical to the public interest but also is devoid of plausi- 
ble excuse, because the schools at Ohio State, Western Reserve, and Baylor Universi- 
ties merit the confidence of the state boards of Ohio and ‘Texas, and are capable of 
meeting the needs of their respective states for an increasing number of practitioners. 
The public objection to a continuance of independent dental schools is steadily 
becoming so strong that their extinction is impending. The most important problem 
immediately ahead, on this route of progress in professional education, is the radical 
improvement in universities of inferior dental schools that have been given indifferent 
attention and which have been conducted, like proprietary schools, as agencies for 
financial profit.

THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS IN 
THE UNITED STATES AND IN EUROPE 
ITH participation in the recent international conflict, the American nation 
may be said to have attained its majority in an international sense. After 
struggling for three hundred years in the conquest of a great continent, it appeared 
as an important factor among the nations that have created western civilization — 
nations which it has long regarded as the source of its learning and the inspiration of 
its art, its music, and its letters. 
What does this relation signify in a future concerned with a slow and painful re- 
covery of Europe while our resources rapidly multiply in a country almost untouched 
by the war? Are we to assume our full responsibility for maintaining and advancing 
the achievements of the mind and the duty to promote in the interest of the whole 
world those causes that are the chief glory of mankind? 
The answer to this question depends chiefly on what we do in the education of our 
people. As a pioneer the American was a skirmisher at the outposts of European civili- 
zation. His problem has been to consolidate and advance his own position. His theory 
of education has never been to select and train the most capable minds in order to ad- 
vance the national welfare by intellectual achievement, as has been in general the plan 
in European countries. On the contrary, his democratic slogans impel him to devise, 
so far as possible, a common platform on which all may be brought up together, and he 
does not ask whether any particular individual so treated has either the brain power 
to rise, or the will to use it. 
That both American theory and American practice have furnished a powerful anti- 
dote to the class discrimination long characteristic of European procedure is beyond 
dispute, but it is probable that neither method, taken alone, is a suitable permanent 
answer to the problem of education. So extraordinary has become the faith of Ameri- 
can parents in a single institution which we have all conspired to praise, that well over 
half of all the boys and girls leaving the elementary school are at least entered in 
the secondary school — many times the proportion to be found in any other great 
country. This involves a momentous responsibility on the part of those who are 
trusted to make these precious years bring a full return for every child concerned, 
and to secure like advantages in those cases where it is not yet permitted. The vast 
question needs frank analysis and critical study, particularly a sympathetic study of 
foreign procedure and experiment, before we shall dare to believe that we are on firm 
ground. The following hasty survey can do little but suggest where our most obvious 
problems lie. The facts are already familiar to students of comparative education, 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
84 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
but never have they appeared with greater force than at this moment, when our system 
of training seems on the point of breaking down with the impossible load that it has 
so cheerfully and perhaps thoughtlessly assumed. 
What are the weaknesses of our situation ? An education is normally, and we be- 
lieve rightfully, conceived to be for those who can learn and who desire to learn. Such 
a function is in the highest degree selective. What has brought it to pass that our 
schools and colleges to-day are literally overwhelmed with persons who neither can 
learn nor desire to learn? Undoubtedly it has been the very estimable wish to confer 
on as many as possible the advantages of learning —spiritual, social, and commercial 
—and the belief that that end can be attained by luring them into and through such 
schools and colleges as we now have. What, however, has been the result? As attend- 
ance has relatively increased, the average of ability has sensibly diminished, and the 
will to learn has weakened still faster. Instead of keeping our best notions of education 
virile and of inventing new forms of training appropriate to the ideals and capacities 
of the newcomers, we have clung to a unity that has long since betrayed us and have 
thereby sunk to obvious mediocrity. Released from genuine intellectual demands, an 
abounding student energy has raised a crop of general activities that have not only 
subordinated the main task, but to a very great extent, both in student and in public 
opinion, have assumed the crown of sanction for the whole process. We bewail the 
fact and seek to “regulate” student activities, without perceiving that if what we 
still believe to be the major operations were convincingly carried out, the others would 
of themselves fall into the proper perspective. 
I. SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Since secondary education is the key to the school situation, let us for the present 
confine our attention to this phase of the general problem. 
A capable and ambitious youth seeking appropriate education in American public 
schools is the victim of at least three, and often four, conditions that react to his 
disadvantage—in some respects almost neutralizing the intellectual effort which he 
actually makes: 
1. The schools are enormous, especially in cities, where the best trained teachers 
are available, teachers who under favorable conditions could do excellent work. In a 
city like New York the enrolment in a single school may run to over seven thou- 
sand pupils. These are not split into coherent groups of pupils and teachers, inti- 
mately associated on a homogeneous basis: they operate on a strictly standardized 
factory plan, even to the punching of a teacher’s time-clock. With each half-year, 
class units and teachers are mechanically shifted in an ingenious checkerboard dis- 
tribution to fit the “program” that will most nearly permit each pupil to take the 
fragments of subjects that he in his wisdom has selected. A teacher may have a pupil 
for a single half-year and never see him again, and a pupil may have eight different
-P-A-G-E-95
  QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 85 
teachers in doing four years’ work in one subject, if indeed he give so much time to one 
subject. The mechanics of the whole operation fill the eye and mind, and what a 
pupil or a teacher really is — the essential initial discovery in genuine education— 
is as completely masked as the personality of a guest in a mammoth hotel. In the 
small schools the teachers are correspondingly younger, not well trained, and less 
experienced, so that here also, though for different reasons, the opportunities for 
educative contacts are slight. 
2. The schools are non-selective and undifferentiated with respect to the quality 
of the pupil. A low average level of operation is the result. Any pupil far below the 
average of ability may graduate from the elementary school and be received automati- 
cally into the next higher institution, where he stands on equal footing with all 
others — possibly with a poor neighbor’s son who may be the most brilliant lad his 
school ever sent up. Intellectual prince and intellectual pauper make their selections 
and are grouped promiscuously side by side. They keep step together from four to 
six years, one doing his poor maximum and the other his fair minimum on material 
suited to neither but determined by the weaker pupil. Each doubtless “ gets some- 
thing,” as the phrase goes, but the capable mind is bored and contracts lazy and 
wasteful habits, while the other is depressed by continual failure with things too hard 
instead of encouraged by clear success at his own level. 
Some help comes from the fact that good pupils choose the harder subjects in 
order to prepare for college. Elimination, too, in the early years often as high as fifty 
per cent, tones up the surviving group. But this is no credit to the school. Quite the 
contrary. The pains taken to guard the borderline, not to keep the unfit out, but to 
keep the tottering pupil in, is one of the anomalies of American education. 
3. The curriculum is a rope of sand, without texture or organization. Effective 
education through related ideas is thereby sacrificed to the mere registering of infor- 
mation. This fact will be made clearer later by comparison with genuine curricula. 
Convinced that knowledge is power, we have assumed that presenting information 
is identical with conferring knowledge, and have hastened to make broad this easy 
and royal road to an educated democracy. Information on almost any subject can 
easily be formulated into convenient units. And it is possible for a mind even of 
very limited powers, if socially docile, and inspired by filial duty, personal pride, 
commercial advantage, or any one of a dozen other extraneous motives, to take in and 
give out this information in recognizable word or paraphrase without seriously know- 
ing or caring what itis all about. This is positively all that the school, and usually 
the college, requires, and of this it asks but a fraction— sixty per cent. For fear of 
evaporation the process is checked up at once—daily recitation, written review, 
monthly test, and term examination. These concluded, responsibility ceases, and 
“credit” is recorded, of which no future misstep, even though it discloses total igno- 
rance, can ever deprive the pupil. 
Zeal for our broad, trunk-line school, where every child of democracy may come and
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
choose the information that most attracts him, has blinded us to the fact that “power” 
disappears under such a régime. The knowledge that is power presupposes a mind 
actively at work and bent on the process of self-education. Such a mind requires the 
meanings and relations of its information, and finds little advancement in minute 
and disconnected masses of fact that must, from the nature of our system, stand 
neatly alone. Instead of developing an agency to attend, supply, and encourage a 
pupil who is using his own mind, we have done our best to devise a vehicle that will 
carry the minds of as many as choose to get on board. To graduate from either high 
school or college to-day may hardly be rated as, of itself, an intellectual achievement. 
It is at best a moderately worthy exhibition of certain moral qualities. 
4. The teaching staff, while usually composed of admirable men and women, is not 
a staff of scholars. Good pupils are thus deprived of the one essential aid from without 
that might contribute to direct, accelerate, and economize an education that should 
be already proceeding vigorously from within. Excepting many scholarly and fully 
competent teachers, usually to be found working under impossible conditions in our 
larger cities, the staffs of our public high schools are amateurish and superficial in 
their knowledge. Mediocrity reigns, and the case of these teachers is the more pitiable 
because for the most part they have excellent ability and have spent considerable 
time on their education. But they are the product, in school and college, of the con- 
ditions already described. Instead of living, year after year, with steadily growing 
conceptions in a few great fields, where competent teachers have explored with them, 
through many facts, the large and significant connections that give meaning to each 
field, and that bind one field of knowledge to another, these instructors have been 
hurried through a series of disconnected samples of knowledge, each considered, 
weighed, and checked off for itself alone, many of them “worked up” out of conven- 
ient textbooks and “passed off” outside of school, most of them selected on the prin- 
ciple that a curriculum should reflect the universe with a dab of information out of 
each quarter. They have been given no responsible, independent experience in educat- 
ing themselves, nor have they been selected on a basis of well-tested intellectual 
capacity and achievement. Such teachers abound in fine ideals, they love American life 
and are devoted to American youth, but they do not know enough of the inner values 
of the subjects they try to teach to convince even themselves that a thorough dealing 
with these ideas should constitute the main business of school and of college life. 
These four aspects of secondary school life in America require, we believe, fun- 
damental revision before we shall be fitted to undertake seriously the task which the 
logic of circumstances presses upon us more and more. It is a revision that must, of 
course, rise coherently out of our past and present, and must suit the conditions 
of our life as we find them. The present situation is explicable and to a great extent 
justifiable in view of the path by which we have come. It would be foolish, however, 
on that account to fail to note the valid lessons that we can learn from the experi- 
ence of older nations. They have long faced conditions of population that are just
-P-A-G-E-97
    QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 87 
beginning to be felt here, and have much to teach. They for their part have studied 
us with close attention. Gradually they are adopting what in our practices they find 
admirable, and avoiding what they consider weak or temporary. The standards by 
which they thus discriminate should be of significance to us. 
II. SECONDARY EDUCATION IN EUROPE 
The mainspring of education in Europe is an immemorial reverence for learning. 
The whole body of human knowledge and of scholarly achievement is conceived as 
constituting the supreme achievement of the race, to be preserved, increased, and 
handed on to posterity as its most precious possession. 
Higher education, therefore, is planned, not with a view primarily to securing the 
satisfaction of the individual, but with the purpose of selecting, first, those who are 
competent and worthy to cherish the human heritage in learning and to add to it; 
and, second, those who may be made skilful in appreciating and applying it in the 
guidance of human affairs. 
This attitude has important consequences. Higher education in England, and to 
a still greater degree in France and Germany, is rigidly selective, instead of, as with 
us, sentimentally inclusive. The university systems of all three countries are designed 
for the purpose of winnowing out the man of fickle and merely imitative purpose, 
the weak and unsteady thinker. They are calculated to develop and select the in- 
dependent, resourceful mind that is certain of a matured intellectual purpose and 
practised in sustained intellectual performance. 
The higher secondary schools in these countries being a part of this scheme con- 
tribute directly to it. The product eventually desired is foreshadowed in them with 
great distinctness. They serve other purposes as well, to be sure, in their early grades, 
but they fix and maintain the standards by which the selection of brains and per- 
sonality for the finest uses of the nation goes constantly forward. 
The contrast at this point with the American theory and practice is striking. The 
European secondary school fixes a high mark toward which each aspirant rises just 
in proportion to the force and quality of his individual capacity, which is abun- 
dantly tested in the process. The American in his single, all-embracing, low-stand- 
ard school invites every one to come in and enjoy an experience that will distin- 
guish as little as may be between those of high and low mental qualities. In one case 
graduation is a standard held above the mass to which a few may attain by reason of 
pronounced ability and keen effort. In the other case, it is a standard placed below 
the mass to exclude the few who are notably incapable. Whether or not a graduate 
of the high school has power really to think must be determined by other means; 
its sanctions lie elsewhere. 
We turn now to seek such pertinent suggestions as the institutions of the three 
leading European nations offer. The schools of England and Germany have always
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
been rather better understood by us than those of France because of racial kinship. 
Of these two the German have been developed with greater consistency and faith in 
the significance of education. Furthermore, the latter have survived economic col- 
lapse together with social and political revolution in favor of democratic ideas; their 
condition to-day should consequently be doubly instructive, as indicating whither 
rejuvenation of such institutions tends. 
We purpose, therefore, looking into the general European practice as exemplified 
chiefly by Prussia, a state numerically comparable with France (omitting Alsace Lor- 
raine) and with England (including Wales). Thereafter the varying procedure in 
France and England will be briefly reviewed. 
A. Seconpary Epucation iy Prussta 
Until the close of the war, the higher secondary school in Prussia was a three- 
type institution. Since then a fourth has been added. These several types differ much 
less from one another, than would four random curricula in an American high school. 
Greek and Latin; Latin and modern languages; modern languages, science, and 
mathematics; and, more recently, German civilization and modern languages— these 
represent the four distinguishing combinations of emphasis, though a large portion 
of the work done is identical in all four schools. 
In the American school, the variation thus exhibited would seem trivial; it would 
be accounted merely a different pattern, an individual election as to the manner of 
securing sufficient “credits” to graduate or to go to college. To take Latin or to 
omit it, is of importance chiefly in the school records; it has little significance in 
distinguishing the actual mental horizon and spirit of one student from those of 
another, and none at all in impairing the solidarity of the school’s social life as 
shown in the common activities — social, athletic, dramatic, musical, etc. 
To the German, on the contrary, such a difference in curriculum is all important. 
To study Latin in the Gymnasium involves 56 year-hours’ per week, spread over 
nine years, as compared with a maximum of 20 year-hours spread over four shorter 
years in our high school. The Latin boy has nutriment of a different kind and from 
a totally different source than that which serves the non-Latin boy. It is of a different 
stuff, and with German teachers it results in a different boy from one who has spent, 
say, 78 year-hours in science and mathematics without Latin. The time element is 
of great significance. For example, the pupil of the classical Gymnasium spends more 
time solely on Latin and Greek than the American high school pupil would if he 
were to study nothing else throughout his entire high school course. 
So far-reaching are these differences, so intensively is each branch followed and 
emphasized, and so keenly is the ultimate goal of each carefully planned combina- 
tion visualized that the schools themselves tend to remain physically distinct. They

usually occupy buildings in different locations, each bent solely on its particular 
task. While a four-year American high school may enroll thousands of pupils and, 
like the telephone service, looks forward complacently to indefinite extension of its 
mechanical activities, an Oberrealschule—modern languages, science, and mathe- 
matics chiefly —with 700 pupils distributed over nine years is considered unwieldy; 
its average size in 1922 was less than 400 pupils, its maximum, 805. The average 
size of the Gymnasium, which is the most frequent type, was less than 300 pupils, 
its maximum 685. Only eight per cent of all types of higher secondary schools had 
more than 600 pupils in 1922. The average size of the 108 schools in Berlin was 
473. This condition makes possible long and intimate acquaintance between master 
and pupil, does away with administrative formalities and clerical machinery, opens 
the way to complete revelation of the pupil’s powers and to an education in ideas that 
actually shapes a boy’s mind. 
1. The Curriculum 
In addition to the favorable size of these school units, two other factors differen- 
tiate them from any educational process known in America—the teacher and the cur- 
riculum. We will consider the latter first. 
It is a nine-year progress, wherein nothing is ever dropped. Once a subject is 
started, it gvows from its point of departure to the end of the course. Hence no study 
is begun that is not profitable for a steady and progressive development, or that is 
not itself a chapter in the organic process of such a development. Since education 
consists essentially in being conscious of significant relationships, and in being able to 
perceive them, no pains are spared to maintain the integrity of all possible connec- 
tions, between subjects as far as practicable, but at all events in the related concep- 
tions of a single subject as it unfolds. 
Necessarily, therefore, the formal curriculum is one of great apparent simplicity: 
religion, German, three (or two) out of four foreign languages, history (with civics), 
geography, mathematics, natural science, and drawing, constitute the unbroken 
threads on which each pupil weaves the pattern of his school experience with ideas. 
This continuity of the warp of education is a matter of singular importance; in- 
deed, it is the essential fact of European schooling: it makes possible that background 
of mastered ideas that is the necessary basis of all clear and individual thinking. 
When a subject, conceived and organized in unitary fashion, is disclosed as a growth 
through successive years, all thought and effort spent thereon has place and purpose. 
Itis the relating of each new aspect not only to that learned yesterday but also to 
that of last year or of the year before, that has worth and stimulus for the active 
mind, and it is in the building up of such relationships that a skilful teacher finds 
and trains in his pupils capacities for insight that induce the habit of reflection. The 
pupil who knows from experience that a new fact or a principle will reappear year 
after year in modified forms or with enlarged applications confronts it in an atti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  90 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
tude unlike his who believes it will be shelved forever after the next term examina- 
tions. It is to his obvious interest to understand it. There are no tests or examina- 
tions in the American sense from one end of the curriculum to the other. The object 
is not to see how many facts can be forced through a pupil’s superficial mental pro- 
cesses and deposited on an examination paper, but to ensure a permanent increase in 
his mental resources. Attention is focused solely, therefore, on a clear understanding 
and a power of adequate expression. The pupil becomes conscious gradually that the 
subject is organized about certain large and stable conceptions. Through successive 
terms and years these are reinforced and refined by continual association with fresh 
facts, and eventually they become his own possession. It is the gradual creation of 
such clear fundamental ideas through constant comparison and assimilation over a 
long period, and the use of these ideas in further fruitful combinations that, in Eu- 
ropean opinion, constitutes serious education for minds capable of such pursuit. It is 
exercise in significant thinking. 
The simplicity of these stout longitudinal threads of the curriculum is supple- 
mented by an extraordinary richness in the development of each subject itself. Eu- 
ropean schools have not fallen prey to the utter disorganization that has overtaken 
the American secondary curriculum, yet the Prussian provisions allow abundant lati- 
tude for genuine differences in the aptitudes of capable minds by pronounced shift 
in emphasis. One boy may devote 90 year-hours to Latin and Greek, while another 
spends 80 on science and mathematics, and takes no classics, yet the first will also 
have 50 hours of science and mathematics in a nine-year course that progressively 
knits up the important features of these fields into a significant whole, and relates 
them in every possible way to the outcome of his classical study. The effective use of 
separate institutions comes here to light; such a course is not the series of isolated, 
interchangeable units in mathematics and science characteristic of the American 
school with its myriad aims; it is deliberately organized throughout with sole refer- 
ence to the needs of the classical student. 
The degree of profitable “enrichment” attainable in any given curriculum of study 
depends upon the number of valuable ideas that can be brought into a coherent re- 
lationship and, thereby, given a significant and lasting place in the pupil’s mental 
scheme of things. The American high school presents a long list of subjects that may 
be chosen in yearly or half-yearly fragments, each tending to be self-contained owing 
to the fact that under a system of free election it is impossible to count on any two 
pupils having had the same previous work. Beginning after an abrupt break with 
the eighth grade, a pupil may start out with English, Latin, algebra, and general 
science, After the first year mathematics may be avoided if algebra grows distaste- 
ful, and Latin may later be discarded for French. English must usually be retained, 
and detachable units of history, botany, physics, Spanish, civics, etc., eke out the 
curious medley of stipulated “credits.” Under such a system nominal “enrichment” 
becomes actual impoverishment, for the simple reason that the more elective subjects
-P-A-G-E-101
QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 91 
are thus mechanically added to the bill of fare, each tied up by itself with a final ex- 
amination and sealed with the inescapable “credit,” the more completely do we cut 
off the essential and vitalizing connections of one body of ideas with another, whether 
in the same or different fields. No period of history may presuppose or seek to rein- 
force a knowledge of any other; physics itself may be divided and presented in two 
isolated chapters; and a study of biology must dispense with an indispensable fore- 
going chemistry. Even where there is apparent sequence, as in English, or in small 
schools where offerings are limited, the individual term courses tend nevertheless to 
be organized and conducted without reference to what precedes or follows; except 
where it isunavoidable(e.g. Latin, French, etc.), such sequence as exists is not essential 
or utilized. The really significant ideas on which thought depends are thus cropped 
and clipped until there remain just what the American secondary curriculum is to-day 
— detached bundles of information, that cannot be digested and retained because they 
are not properly related. It would be difficult to find a better illustration of Henry 
Adams’ shrewd remark that “nothing in education is so astonishing as the amount 
of ignorance it accumulates in the form of inert facts.” 
The only way to remedy the evils just described is to simplify the curriculum and 
enrich the teacher, which is precisely what the European schools do. In Prussia a 
briefly sketched plan of general objectives is set up by the government to keep the 
schools approximately together. Within this loose frame the masters of the individ- 
ual schools have become in recent years wholly free to formulate the curriculum and 
choose the material, topic by topic, taking care that the inner cross-connections be- 
tween subject and subject from point to point are duly brought out. The study of 
German in the classical Gymnasium, for example, emphasizes constantly the influence 
of classical ideas on German literature and spirit, and in turn the reaction of the Ger- 
man mind in assimilating it. When teachers in other subjects can supplement the in- 
struction, they are freely utilized. Topics common to two subjects, such as literature 
and history, are carefully assigned, or else divided as to point of view. Thus through 
unremitting deliberation and frequent conference of a small group of competent mas- 
ters the whole curriculum represents an intelligent coéperative meshing of instruc- 
tion, whereby each master is fully aware of what his colleagues are doing, and knows 
what general resources in the pupil will be available to meet his particular demands. 
Within the subject itself, when handled as a unit, the opportunity is used to fix 
clearly the main ideas by foreshadowing and preparing for them in early years, by 
developing them in as wide relations as possible, and by fixing and reinforcing them 
with constant restatement and fresh application. A frame of this sort can hold suc- 
cessfully a wealth of detail that is out of the question when it is supplied merely as in- 
formation from detached sources to pupils who can be held responsible only for what 
is in hand at the moment. The first process builds an orderly mental structure that 
gives permanent satisfaction ; the second leads to cramming, confusion, and the effort 
to escape.

92 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
The German course in the mother tongue, for example, is thus set to ensure “a cer- 
tain mastery of the language and a lively comprehension of the cultural values spring- 
ing from the language, the literature, the art, and the living forces of the people.”! 
Specified are: training in the pure language of the school, which is that of the stage; 
training in speaking, in reading, in committing to memory, in oral expression, and 
composition; instruction in grammar and rhetoric; reading and discussion of litera- 
ture in all of its forms, together with its historical development; mythology, folklore, 
social life, customs, dress, and other expressions of national character; music, archi- 
tecture, and graphic arts as products of the national genius; philosophy both as the 
outgrowth of problems of language and literature and as the highest expression of the 
national thought; good citizenship on the basis of appreciation of national achieve- 
ment and pride in it. 
In the study of natural science, “the task set for each branch compels the inti- 
mate interlocking of them all into a single course in Science. The individual institu- 
tion must determine the separate ends to be sought . . . but the interrelations of all 
branches with the entire curriculum will condition the formulation of the course.” 
The main divisions are physics, chemistry, and biology, but they are interwoven 
throughout, both in time and in cross reference, bringing with them geology, miner- 
alogy, and paleontology, much of the history and philosophy of science, together 
with its social and economic applications. The purpose is, “without attempting an 
exhaustive treatment, to bring the various fields into systematic arrangement with 
one another in order that the pupil may gradually become conscious of the intimate 
interdependence of all natural processes.” It may properly be inferred that such a 
course is designed primarily to promote careful and accurate thinking. Laboratory 
work, while always in evidence, recedes before the task of understanding thoroughly 
the main ideas and their interrelations. Nothing but admiration is expressed for the 
luxurious laboratory equipment to be found in the United States, but frank observ- 
ers from England, France, and Germany alike declare that we greatly exaggerate the 
merely manipulative opportunities in science study and mistake the superficial interest. 
thereby aroused for a real educational result, while we neglect, or ignore, the hard 
thinking which gives to scientific conceptions their remarkable value in education. 
Any one who follows courses like these as they progress, will soon be convinced 
that the real enrichment and the inner inspiration of both pupil and master spring 
| from a certain intellectual clarity and grandeur inherent in great orderly conceptions, 
slow of growth, long lived with, and studied and restudied in different lights. Not only 
do good minds so trained develop power from their habitually lucid dealing with im- 
portant ideas, but their mental connections are enormously increased, as on a switch- 
board, giving them access to a multitude of meanings that are concealed from those 
who deal chiefly with primary facts. This is education.   1 This and the following quotations are from Richtlinien fiir die Lehrpléine der héheren schulen Preussens, 1925, the official manual of the higher secondary schools.
-P-A-G-E-103
  QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 93 
2. The Teachers 
If continuity and relationship of ideas constitute the characteristic basis of excel- 
lence in German instruction, it is because of the teachers who administer it. Just as 
such instruction requires and exercises in the pupil a higher form of intellect than 
the mere rehearsal of information, so it exacts from the teacher a far more difficult 
and searching performance than that of one who checks off recitations from a text- 
book, or discharges similar passive duties. 
As in the case of the American teacher already cited, the conspicuous fact in the 
make-up of the German higher secondary instructor is that he is the selected product 
of the process over which he presides. To understand him it is necessary to under- 
stand still more minutely what that process is. 
German instruction has been said to be too rigid—too much learning and too 
little free discussion, independent use of books, and pupil initiative. Although this 
criticism has been in part well founded, it is often superficial; the real defects are 
recognized, and are gradually being corrected without disturbing the fundamental 
advantage that can be secured in no other way. German instruction has placed its 
main emphasis on building up a body of valuable and accurate ideas in the belief 
that a capable young mind may more profitably deal with these than with mediocre 
and inaccurate notions laboriously if not painfully arrived at through what is called 
“self-discovery.” It escapes some critics that with good teachers a maximum of men- 
tal activity and stimulus may result from skilful presentation of ideas. The German, 
seeking to arouse activity to the utmost at just this point, is in great measure suc- 
cessful. The following instructions from the official manual hardly misrepresent pres- 
ent practice: 
“All instruction is fundamentally ‘activity-instruction’ (Arbeitsunterricht). It 
requires that in choice of materials the teacher shall always consider, not the 
learning merely, but rather what powers in the pupil—particularly, independence 
of judgment, of feeling, of imagination and of will—can be developed and 
heightened. The necessary principle of such instruction is that the class exer- 
cises consist in codperative give-and-take under the leadership of the teacher. 
The important thing is to give this activity acharacter that befits both the nature 
of the pupils and the educative purpose of the school. Its great and serious aim 
is to bridge the natural gap between the certain acquisition of knowledge, with- 
out which higher mental activity is impossible, and the acquisition of the power 
for independent work, without which mere knowledge is unfruitful.” 
Whereas in America the textbook is the focus of class attention, and the teacher 
functions as an aid and witness to its assimilation (a “fellow student,” as some of 
them like to be called, and most of them are), in German classes the teacher completely 
fills the stage. He presents all new material directly as though it were original withhim. 
He is not expected to lecture. His problem is to lay bare in every pupil a bit of living 
tissue into which he can graft his new idea, and he does it by questioning that rivets  
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
attention. Notebooks may not obtrude: the pupil must think, understand, and re- 
member. Aside from meagre outlines, there are no textbooks to fall back on; for thirty 
periods per week (recently reduced for economy from thirty-six) the pupil faces his 
masters, the first and most important source of his knowledge; and concentration dur- 
ing those hours is intense. Whereas American children “think,” both for recitation and 
examination, in terms of words as they remember their appearance on a page, these 
boys and girls think in terms of ideas caught from lips, and a direct conversational 
attention is characteristic; mind-wandering penalizes itself. Part of each hour goes for 
review and practice, where everything is fair that is from one day to nine years old, 
and that too not only in the subject concerned but in all others. Here the master 
stands before a veritable loom of youth, weaving in as many earlier threads from his 
own and other subjects as will hold the new material with firm texture in a clear de- 
sign. Home work is reduced; what there is grows out of the class work, and is espe- 
cially intended to develop imagination, inventiveness, and independent reflection. Be 
it repeated, examinations do not exist; attention is on the ideas as such, and not 
on any mode or hope of circumventing them whatsoever. Profitable by-products of 
examinations, such as the review and organization of material that they presumably 
necessitate, are secured vigorously day by day. The business of the classroom is nor- 
mally just that constructive type of thinking, and examinations as we know them 
would be superfluous. 
Out of this process, applied to the curriculum already described, comes a youth who 
in each subject from beginning to end has been dealing with a growing mental struc- 
ture as a sculptor deals with a clay figure, and who has been dealt with in the same 
fashion by his little group of masters—the same teachers with whom he started. After 
a thorough scrutiny, not primarily as to what he knows but as to whether he is “ ripe,” 
he passes to the university, at the age of nineteen. Tell him that he is educated, and 
he would probably smile, although to some extent he could honestly agree; he does 
carry with him a comprehensive equipment on which he can consciously rely. 
Whether or not the freedom of university life in Europe is too abrupt a change 
after the close supervision of the school, may be open to discussion. It is, however, 
often overlooked that the student comes up thoroughly practised in the orderly hand- 
ling of ideas, and, whether at Cambridge, Lyons, or Halle, is presumably competent 
to lay out his own curriculum and think his way through to relative mastery of the 
subjects he proposes to teach. In Prussia the candidate for a teacher’s career studies, 
as a rule, two major subjects and a minor subject, besides philosophy including educa- 
tion. After devoting a minimum of four years of wholly self-regulated study to this 
task, he is judged by a thesis and comprehensive state examination at the close, ex- 
actly as a candidate for law or medicine. 
No American university would dream of setting before its students such an intel- 
lectual task as this. The fact is that for good minds the extended German practice 
of hard thinking on well-organized material is a fruitful preparation for intellectual 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 95 
command; while a large share of the “free” activities in the American schools have no 
hard thinking behind them, and are too often a wasteful substitute for good teaching. 
The candidate who is successful in the state examination has the privilege of regis- 
tering at some one of the secondary schools for two years of practical preparation. 
With six or eight others he studies, in weekly seminar, the pedagogy of his subjects, 
school psychology and ethics, school organization and discipline, and whatever else 
his personal adviser may think he needs. He visits classes and is gradually introduced 
to instruction, under the constant criticism of the teachers in the school and of his 
fellow candidates. His practical examination takes place at the end of the second year; 
if successful, he is placed on a waiting list. This occurs normally at the age of 26 or 
27; present conditions in Prussia have brought the age of actual appointment to well 
over 35. 
Thus the instructor in these secondary schools acquires a thoroughly trained mind ; 
he is a scholar, and he is well versed in the technic of his profession. The tendency 
of the last twenty-five years has been to recognize his initiative, to give him great 
freedom in the classroom, and to make him fully responsible for the interior organi- 
zation of the curriculum in his institution. In contrast to French practice, though he 
has the initial training of the university professor, he rarely becomes one. His peda- 
gogical preparation, lacking in France, commits him to the specific problems of his 
profession. The university professor is to discover and formulate knowledge; the 
secondary school teacher is to keep abreast of it and assimilate it to the needs of 
those who in their turn will discover, use, or pass it on. He is not intended to be 
the purveyor of useful information to the democracy, but the guide and adviser 
of those whose capacities justify society in qualifying them to spend their lives in 
intellectual pursuits. 
3. Differentiation of Ability 
Clearly, secondary education in Prussia rests on a philosophy quite different from 
that which sustains it in the United States. The situation in France and England is 
similar, as will appear later. These countries believe in a school as good as it can be 
made for the scientific training of such minds as can profit by it — minds that give 
promise of making large return in their contributions to the common welfare. This 
is the doctrine of the intellectual élite or “chosen” bearers of scholarship and learning 
—a doctrine that represents the typical and traditional European approach to the 
problem of education. 
To American observers this is but a part, and by no means the all-important part, 
of the whole problem. Before inferences helpful to us can be drawn, we must know 
how a differentiated system of this sort relates itself to the population as a whole. 
We refer again to Prussia, where statistics give precise information, while in France 
such data are not available, and in England do not exist. In the United States, second-  
-P-A-G-E-106
    96 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
ary school attendance can be given with such accuracy as the figures of the United 
States Bureau of Education permit. 
In 1922, the pupils attending public and private higher secondary schools in Prus- 
sia, in the four grades corresponding to the ages 15 to 18 inclusive, numbered 5.4 
per cent of the boys and 3.4 per cent of the girls in that age group of the population, 
as compared with 32.6 per cent of the boys and 37.4 per cent of the girls in the case 
of pupils in public and private four-year secondary schools in the United States. 
Pupils registered in the first year of American secondary schools constituted, boys 
58 per cent, girls 57 per cent, of the fifteen year census age-group to which that year 
roughly corresponds. In Prussia the proportion in the higher secondary schools at 
this point was, boys 8.1 per cent, girls 4.9 per cent, though many of this age were 
doubtless in the middle schools. ‘ 
In the United States the normal age for graduation from high school is eighteen, 
and in 1922 the graduates from secondary schools constituted 14.9 per cent of the 
eighteen-year-old boys and 20 per cent of the eighteen-year-old girls. If we reduce the 
attendance in Prussian higher schools at the corresponding point by 11 per cent, 
which is about the amount of loss in the final examination of the following year, it 
appears that those qualified for promotion numbered 2.5 per cent of the eighteen- 
year-old boys and $ per cent of the eighteen-year-old girls.1 Such a wide discrepancy 
in attendance suggests at once the intensive and the selective character of the Euro- 
pean training. 
As for the remainder, it appears that more than 92 per cent? of all children in 
Prussia attend only the elementary school until they are fourteen years of age. Ac- 
cording to the new republican constitution, trade or continuation schools are then 
compulsory until the age of eighteen. Laws giving this provision binding force have 
not yet been set up, largely because of the great expense involved. But even on the 
present voluntary basis, about 27 per cent of the eligible youth from 14 to 18 years of 
age were attending such schools in 1921*—usually day schools in session nine hours 
per week for forty weeks in the year. The absentees were chiefly girls and those em- 
ployed temporarily in minor positions or in agriculture. Of the regular apprentices in 
industry, 60 per cent were going to school; and of those in commerce, 70 per cent. 
Between the higher secondary schools and the continuation schools lies a parallel 
group of “ middle schools,” inaugurated in 1872. Because they carried no military 
privileges, these were not popular before the war. Since 1918, however, they have 
rapidly increased both in size and number; in 1922 they had 316,000 pupils as com- 
pared. with 467,000 in the higher schools of all types. In March, 1925, thirteen of 
1 The proportions quoted in this passage are based, for Prussia on the census of 1919, and for the United States on 
the census of 1920. Technically we have, of course, no means of knowing what precise proportion of the population 
of any given age were in school or graduated, since the school figures include many above and below that age. With 
a negligible error, however, which may be assumed to be constant for all countries, every pupil who is above or 
below the characteristic age for that grade is counterbalanced by a pupil of the same age who is in a higher ora 
lower grade. Colored youth in the United States were omitted from the calculations.

these institutions were approved in one city alone (Magdeburg). They usually have 
a six-year course above the four-year Grundschule, and carry the pupil to the age 
of sixteen. Many of them are private, and prepare for the higher schools; the major- 
ity of the pupils are girls; the teachers come both from the normal schools and the 
university ; the tuition fee is one-half that at the higher schools. The real function of 
this school in the future appears to consist in giving a practical education, with one 
or two foreign languages, to such pupils as, in their early years, show special ability, 
but do not seek to become scholars. Many, for example, who formerly filled the lower 
classes of the higher schools because of military privileges thus obtainable, will here- 
after attend the middle schools. 
The threefold differentiation in Prussian secondary education is thus before us: 
First. A good, fundamental schooling up to 14 years of age in the Volksschule for all 
those not withdrawn for the special schools mentioned below. Thereafter a four-year 
vocational, civic, and mother-tongue training interwoven with a wage-earning occu- 
pation. Second. A special school, the Mittelschie, from ages 10 to 16 for pupils of 
good ability, with a product fairly comparable to that of the American high school. 
Thereafter follow the business, trade, and technical schools. Third. The Héhere Schule 
(including Gymnasium, etc.), from ages 10 to 19 for pupils of superior ability —an 
institution that has no counterpart in the United States. It prepares for the university 
and for the teacher-training institutes which it is proposed to establish. 
4. Effect of the German Revolution 
In outline this has been the Prussian system for the past fifty years; in its spirit 
and management, however, it is a novelty dating from the German Revolution, and 
possesses a significance that can scarcely be compressed within a descriptive para- 
graph. 
The Conference of 1920, in which, after war and revolution, Germany took stock 
of her educational situation, was dominated by one idea, the so-called Einheitsschule 
or unitary school plan, a notion long fostered by socialist reformers and powerfully 
supported in their minds by the fact that the United States was supposed to be giving, 
in a single progressive series of institutions, the same education for all. When this 
glamorous idea was actually confronted with a school system that had sought, though 
not without injustice to some, to educate its most capable minds in surpassing fash- 
ion, proponents of the new plan themselves discerned the truth: the defect of the old 
was not that an exacting scientific education was at the disposal of a few who could 
earn it, but that access to that education rested on inequitable economic advantage 
and was inflexible. 
The reorganization resulting from this conference, both in Prussia and elsewhere, 
modestly announces a scheme of education that in pure fitness for the best interests 
of a democratic people leaves little to be added. It sets forth a well-differentiated 
   
-P-A-G-E-108
    98 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
system of secondary instruction based solely on a skilfully determined capacity to 
profit by the things that schools can teach, without regard to social or economic 
considerations. Certain English cities had earlier inaugurated precisely such a prin- 
ciple, even supplementing free tuition with parental subsidies ; and recent legislation 
shows that it is the policy which the British central authority has definitely in view. 
Actually to develop a school system on this basis in a period of great political and 
economic uncertainty such as now prevails in Prussia will require both patience and 
courage. The steps already taken are noteworthy: First. The old preparatory classes of 
the higher schools patronized by the well-to-do families have been abolished ; the com- 
mon school now receives all children for the first four years, and private schools are dis- 
couraged. Second. At the age of ten, and in exceptional cases a year earlier, all prom- 
ising pupils both in the common and private schools are examined for admission to 
middle and higher schools. If successful, their tuition charge is scaled to the income 
of the parent or remitted entirely. Some communities add free textbooks, transporta- 
tion, dental services, etc. The tendency everywhere is to increase these opportunities 
for good pupils as conditions improve. Third. A new type of higher secondary cur- 
riculum has been organized coédrdinate with three others, but focused chiefly on a 
thorough treatment of modern civilization in Germany, with the addition of one or 
two modern foreign languages. Fourth. Certain higher secondary schools of all types, 
but particularly the last mentioned, are organizing classes to receive pupils entering 
at the age of thirteen from the common schools. Thus pupils late in maturing or lo- 
cated at a distance can still enjoy such training if they are fit for it. Fifth. The old 
normal schools have been abolished. Hereafter teachers in common and higher schools 
will receive an equivalent basic training preparing for the university, the former pre- 
sumably in the new type of higher school mentioned above. Spécial technical prepa- 
ration for their profession will be provided for common school teachers, probably in 
“academies” at the general university level. 
Whether or not Prussia can ever give full and sincere effect to her new democratic 
theory of education, the proposal is one of profound significance to a commonwealth 
like our own. That feature of it which, for social and historical reasons, is least com- 
prehended in Prussia finds immediate approval with every intelligent American: a 
democratic government should ensure each individual the opportunity of making the 
most of himself up to the limit of his capacity and without economic handicap beyond 
his control. Furthermore, the American has to-day what Europe sadly lacks; namely, 
ample resources wherewith to put the principle into practice. On the other hand, those 
features of the program that are taken fully for granted, and are as clear as day to the 
Prussian, are those to which the eyes of the American must as yet be opened : educa- 
tion is a substantial and not a sentimental process; its higher opportunities are for 
those, and for those only, who have the intellectual initiative and the intellectual 
vitality to educate themselves; for such as these the best that can be had is well worth 
whatever it may cost the community to provide it.

QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 99 
B. Sxconpary Epucation 1n Encuanp 
England differs from Prussia in almost every superficial particular of educational 
procedure, but agrees with it in the essential features of its educational philosophy. 
Secondary education, as understood by us, rests in England on two main pillars. 
There is first a group of endowed schools, among which may be reckoned a few sup- 
ported by ancient companies or by religious denominations. Among the endowed 
schools are many venerable foundations that have endured for centuries, often ante- 
dating the Reformation, and that as “Grammar Schools” or “ Public Schools” have 
until very recently constituted the backbone of English adolescent education. Each 
of these schools is outwardly a law unto itself, yet collectively they are the bearers 
of a common tradition that through the refining process of generations has come to 
represent the typically English ideal of education, an ideal that probably was never 
more powerful than it is to-day. A spirited sense of honor and loyalty, physical fit- 
ness, and the manners of a gentleman are the accepted ingredients of this ideal; 
scholarship is not often mentioned. Nevertheless, scholars do emerge, if not in great 
numbers; until within a dozen years these schools carried off 90 per cent of the open 
scholarship prizes at the older universities. Perhaps a hundred such institutions are of 
reasonably high grade. 
The second group of schools consists of somewhat more than a thousand institu- 
tions for which the national Board of Education is sponsor through its assignment of 
annual subsidies. Of these about 300 have courses for pupils over 16 years of age. 
This aided-school movement had its inception with the reorganization of the Eng- 
lish Board of Education so recently as 1900. It is the result of the efforts of half a 
century to create a national system of schools that would coérdinate and simplify 
a chaos of voluntary undertakings. Although the poorer endowed institutions also 
receive aid from the Board, the majority of its schools are tax-supported local day 
schools that provide well-supervised secondary school facilities for boys and girls to 
whom the expensive endowed schools are not accessible. They charge tuition, but a 
considerable proportion of their entering pupils (40 per cent at present, recently in- 
creased from 25 per cent) are transferred from the elementary schools on free scholar- 
ships as the result of examination at the age of eleven. Since these “‘free-place” pupils 
are better selected than the others, they stay longer in school ; hence they often con- 
stitute one-half or more of the total attendance. The pupil material is thus of high 
grade, and the rapid invasion by these pupils of the prize lists at the universities has 
been a leading factor in stimulating reform in both curriculum and staff of the old 
endowed institutions. Such, however, is the prestige of the endowed schools that much 
of their organization and nomenclature has been copied outright by the newer schools: 
thus the division of the school by “houses” (though none exist at these day schools), 
the prefect system, game programs, even the “tuck-shops,” all help to give the “day- 
boy” asense of his heritage in an ancient tradition, and tend more and more to draw 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
| together in one strong system two elements originally, and even to-day, rather widely 
sundered in respect of financial status and social connections. 
1. Size of the Schools 
As in Prussia, the secondary schools in England are invariably small. It would seem 
to English masters a contradiction in terms for a teacher to profess to educate who 
was physically unable to reach the boy or girl in order to apply the process. The 
average attendance at the old endowed institutions is from 600 to 800, with a cus- 
tomary age range of from 13 to 19 years; Eton, the largest school, numbered about 
1100 in 1925. The 1143 schools aided by the Board of Education in 1924 averaged 
267 pupils ranging from 10 to 18 years of age; the larger schools in this group had 
about 700 pupils. Manchester Grammar School with 1200 pupils was exceptional. 
Such numbers admit of informal family relationships between masters and pupils of a 
high educational quality, and the pupil of ability has both every opportunity and 
every inducement to develop himself to his full capacity. Moreover, five hundred pupils 
thus distributed constitute a body corporate that holds well together, and draws each 
member into active relations with its main purposes to an extent that is not usually 
achieved where thousands are concerned and many may be untouched by any corpo- 
rate responsibility whatever. 
2. The Curriculum 
The curriculum in the schools aided by the Board may be taken as representative 
of matured English judgment as to what should be the substance of a secondary edu- 
cation. These institutions are mostly new and flexible, they are unhampered by tra- 
dition, and their development has enlisted the best thought of the nation. 
The program of studies falls into two parts, the second of which, the two years from 
16 to 18, is as yet a sort of common zone, cared for both by the universities and 
by the larger schools. Both parts are, however, controlled and determined almost 
exclusively by university requirements. The first or “school leaving” examination 
at 16 is the old matriculation examination, and the second at 18 is the old “interme- 
diate” examination of higher education. Both are given solely by outside university 
authorities, and mark the schooling as definitely “preparatory” in its nature. From 
ages 12 to 16, nevertheless, the curriculum is in theory a group of general studies in- 
tended to provide a liberal training regardless of subsequent careers. English, history 
and geography, mathematics, science, and foreign languages continue unbroken 
throughout this period with no variations within the individual school except as to 
the languages or sciences taken. As a vocational concession, certain commercial sub- 
jects are approved in some schools at the ages 15 and 16, but they are not permitted 
to occupy more than one-fifth of the whole time. Agriculture and domestic science 
find similar treatment where they seem appropriate. |

QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 101 
The noteworthy feature of this program of studies is the principle of sequence and 
continuity on which it rests. Although details vary from school to school, in any 
given institution one finds a general course required of all, and on the tendencies 
shown in its performance rests the choice of subjects for the two succeeding years. 
Asin the German program, each year’s instruction grows out of that of the year pre- 
ceding, and gradually forms with it a permanent structure of clear and significant 
ideas that are related to one another, and that convey the lesson and example of delib- 
erate, well-articulated thought. The coherence of subject with subject is marked. 
Latin, if taken, carries Roman history with it; botany may count upon an antecedent 
chemistry with which to explain the physiology of plants; optics, as a section of 
physics, is deferred until geometry has made the pupil familiar with the properties 
of triangles. It is easy to bring about such interrelations because the schools are small, 
and the masters are intimately associated. It would of course be out of the question 
without a fixed curriculum. 
At the age of 16 the pupil chooses as to the bulk of his time between certain di- 
vergent groups of studies. These are usually either classics, or science and mathemat- 
ics, or modern languages and history, each with one or two minor subjects selected 
from fields not so chosen. For two years he does intensive university preparatory work, 
and finally takes an examination that determines his fate as to the scholarships on 
which, in the case of pupils in the aided schools, his future career usually depends. 
In the university the student will almost invariably devote his three years for the 
B.A. degree to the further mastery of this field of specialization already chosen. His 
scholastic career from his twelfth year on presents, therefore, a four-year general 
course for liberal culture, followed by a two-year period of semi-specialization, and 
brought finally to a focus in a three-year period of complete concentration on a 
relatively limited, though even then not a narrow field of knowledge. Such a course 
of training has the merits of consistency and of the utmost economy of mental 
energy ; in the case of students receiving upper class honors it results in a thorough 
and confident scholarship. The American should note first that specialization of this 
type deals with a much more liberal group of related subjects than the term usually 
implies with us, and should, second, compare attentively the state of mind in which 
the American college graduate may conclude the mixture of elementary studies that 
he calls his curriculum. 
Men and women so trained go back into the schools as teachers. Although a 
teacher’s preparation is standardized in no such manner as prevails in Germany and 
France, and strictly pedagogical training is rare and of uncertain effect, the stipula- 
tions of the Board of Education ensure that secondary teachers be genuine scholars in 
their respective fields.

3. Differentiation of Ability | 
Differentiation in the instruction of pupils on the basis of intellectual ability as- 
sumes in England an importance apparent nowhere else in Europe, although its begin- 
nings in Germany have already been pointed out. The matter has a two-fold aspect: 
first, as applied within the schools, and second, as affecting the general provisions for 
secondary instruction. 
One has the impression that, scholastically, the English are a much “examined” 
folk. Admission to an institution or rank or privilege of any sort by “certificate,” 
as understood in this country, does not exist, except it be a certificate earned in 
some sort of examination. A special feature of this situation inheres in the fact that 
instead of placing secondary and higher instruction upon a gratuitous basis as in 
America, England has retained the system of fees and has greatly extended the prac- 
tice of giving scholarships for merit. Thus examination becomes for very many not 
only the basis of admission, but the indispensable means to academic survival. 
The result of this examination tradition is that intellectual activities everywhere 
in England are carried on with an attitude and in an atmosphere of open competi- 
tion that makes them nearly as objective as are athletic sports and games. A pupil 
expects to have his intellectual measure taken as frankly and definitely as his weight 
or his skill in cricket, and sentimentalism in the matter finds scant foothold. 
The operation of this principle within the school — within even these small schools 
having a relatively select attendance—may be illustrated by the organization of a 
typical London institution — Westminster City School. New boys entering at the 
age of 11 are distributed promiscuously among three divisions, while a fourth contains 
those who have taken the preparatory classes of the school itself. All begin French 
at this point. After one year these four groups are completely reshuffled on the basis 
of their achievement. The best group begins Latin, the next two add German to 
French, and the lowest takes extra French and English. Otherwise the subjects are 
identical as indicated above, but the treatment varies according to the ability of the 
class. After two years, at the age of 14, the four divisions are once more reorganized 
into three, again on the basis of achievement, except in the language courses, where 
the original four divisions are retained. The lowest of the three new divisions com- 
prises those who probably will not take the leaving examination at 16. Those in the 
next will take the examination, but usually will not proceed to another institution. 
The top form will be examined at 16 and will then be divided between the advanced 
two-year scientific and modern courses to prepare for the university or other higher 
institutions. 
In comparison with this discriminating procedure, which is fairly representative 
of the majority of English schools, the American High School with its repetition of 
divisions, all at one commonplace level, seems to lack definite purpose. One fears that 
our tendency to blanket intellectual differences under the same general formula is
-P-A-G-E-113
  QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 103 
costing us dearly. We seem to be throwing away the one great opportunity of en- 
forcing with young minds a clear feeling for the reality of intellectual accomplish- 
ment and for a sense of ultimate thoroughness that comes only when a mind is en- 
couraged to test its limits. It is probable that the chief lesson we have to draw from 
England is on the appropriate proving and recognition of true capacity ; this is surely 
not an un-American trait in certain other distinctive aspects of our national life, and 
cannot long be omitted from our education. 
The external differentiation of the new secondary instruction in England likewise 
merits careful consideration, less because of what it has thus far achieved than be- 
cause of the apparent soundness of the principles now being applied, and the promise 
of an eventful structure that will not have to be rebuilt. 
The proportion of persons 15 to 18 years of age who are enjoying full time edu- 
cational advantages in England is probably very small. The odd lack of trustworthy 
school statistics compels one to resort to the census reports for 1921. These place 
the proportion at 6.9 per cent for males and 7.5 per cent for females. Adding the 
proportion reported as doing part-time work, these figures are increased to 8.5 per 
cent and 8.8 per cent, and may be compared with the United States returns from a 
similar source which are 43.8 per cent and 46.9 per cent respectively for school attend- 
ance of any sort. Of fifteen-year-old boys and girls 14 per cent attended a school of 
some sort in England as compared with 74 per cent in the United States. 
But the above figures do not represent the final British verdict on the treatment 
of adolescents. The ideal which has animated the national Board of Education since 
secondary training was provided for in 1902 has been to open the way for each child 
to that form of education which is suited to his capacity. In the words of the Edu- 
cation Act of 1918, “adequate provision shall be made in order to secure that chil- 
dren and young persons shall not be debarred from receiving the benefits of any 
form of education by which they are capable of profiting through inability to pay 
fees.” For a war-weakened people the realization of such an inherently expensive 
policy is necessarily slow, but the manner in which it is being undertaken in practice 
is significant. It may perhaps be best understood by a brief description of the pro- 
cedure, say, in London, where the terms of the problem are largest. It may be added 
also that education in London is fully typical of the best English practice, and is 
not, as in our largest cities, at the mercy of politics. 
In addition to its secondary schools the county of London, like many other Eng- 
lish communities, has developed during the past fifteen years a new type of school 
known as the central school. The institution originated in the “higher elementary 
schools” that grew up after 1871 before secondary schooling at public expense was 
authorized. The upper classes of such schools became “central” classes, drawing 
pupils from several elementary schools, and were eventually given an independent 
organization. Central schools admit at the age of eleven, and have a four-year cur- 
riculum, of which the three upper years divide into an industrial, a commercial, and  
-P-A-G-E-114
104 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
sometimes a general branch of studies. One foreign language is taught. The teachers 
are especially selected, usually from the elementary staff, and the total cost per pupil 
is about one-half that of the secondary schools. 
For the pupil who does not attend the central schools numerous trade schools and 
institutes are available at the school-leaving age. A few voluntary day continuation 
schools have been opened in partial fulfilment of the Fisher program of 1918, and a 
certain number of pupils remain in the elementary schools after the age of compul- 
sory attendance has been passed. 
With the facilities thus broadly described London proceeds as follows : About 
74,000 children in the elementary school annually reach the age of 11. On the basis 
of a general examination in arithmetic and English, and with the codperative judg- 
ment of teachers and principals, these pupils are arranged as nearly as possible in 
the order of merit. The 1500 nearest the top are then provided with scholarships in 
the secondary schools of their choice, and in case of need maintenance allowances are 
granted to the family up to a value of about $100. Doing well here, the boy or girl 
of 16 readily secures an intermediate scholarship with a higher maintenance allow- 
ance, and at 18 is in line for a large number of university, technical, art, or profes- 
sional scholarships with maintenance up to $950 as required. 
While competitive in a sense, the number of these scholarships is never definitely 
fixed, and it is necessary rather to qualify than to compete for them. 
After the ablest pupils have thus been removed to the secondary schools, a further 
draft is made numbering about 5000 for appointment to the central schools. Here 
also maintenance grants are given, and, as in the secondary school, a promise is ex- 
acted from the parent that the pupil will be kept at school and thus allowed to profit 
by the full course. At the age of 13 this age-group in the elementary school is care- 
fully studied again for able pupils who may have been overlooked or who have 
matured late, and such cases are transferred to the higher schools. 
The total selection of pupils so made constitutes less than 10 per cent of the age- 
group involved. There is nothing arbitrary in this proportion; it represents but the 
beginning of London’s provision for an education, the minimum terms of which were 
courageously faced in the Fisher bill. In Manchester, where a similar differentiation 
is well developed, it is hoped that ten years’ growth will find 20 per cent of a given 
age in secondary schools, 40 per cent in central schools, and the remaining 40 per 
cent well looked after in day continuation schools closely affiliated with industry. 
The principle underlying this whole procedure deserves to be thoughtfully noted. 
One may feel that an old, conservative, highly stratified society has moved with des- 
perate slowness in making genuine education available to its “masses” and still find 
that the method pursued is in itself sound and admirable. Not even with ample funds 
for any program would the most enthusiastic English students of the problem copy 
the American method and attempt to crowd all boys and girls through the same 
mediocre and, for many, purely formal process simply to realize a certain conception
-P-A-G-E-115
QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 105 
of democracy. However explicable for America, they see, just as the Germans see, that 
such a course sacrifices for an empty formula the substance of true education, namely 
to place before every individual the opportunities best suited to that individual’s 
capacities, and then to clear the road of obstacles for the mind that will work. 
C. Seconpary Epucation 1n France 
Although in school organization Germany and France are superficially akin, the 
racial and temperamental background of secondary education in France differs widely 
from that which prevails in either Germany or England. Some of these differences 
illuminate the American problem considerably, but can hardly be discussed within 
the limits of this report. In those features of educational procedure that have been 
selected for emphasis here the practice in France is plainly defined, and agrees wholly 
with that of her neighbors. A brief description will make this clear. 
1. Size of the Schools 
The boys dycées in Paris and in the larger cities of France average about 1000 
pupils each, while those elsewhere have less than half that number. The normal age 
range of these pupils covers eleven years, so that possibly half of them would consti- 
tute an administrative unit comparable with our four-year high schools. The collége, 
while in some respects inferior to the lycée, is of cobrdinate rank; it is found usually 
in the smaller towns, and is locally supported under state supervision. Its average 
attendance is less than 200 pupils, distributed as in the lycée. 
Thus secondary education in France is kept physically manageable—a fact which 
is perhaps somewhat surprising inasmuch as French secondary schooling is a system of 
highly developed instruction, rather than education in the English or American sense. 
Its cardinal features are first a lucid and interesting exposition of material by a group 
of accomplished scholar-specialists; and, second, an assimilation on the part of the 
pupil secured through an enormous amount of painstaking written work and memo- 
rization with great emphasis on precision of thought, refinement of detail, and deli- 
cacy of discrimination. There is scarcely a trace of that stimulating classroom inter- 
change between masters and pupils which is consciously fostered and considered 
indispensable in German, English, and American schools. Such a system could con- 
ceivably be extended indefinitely by the multiplication of its units without seriously 
endangering its results, yet such has not been the course of its development. 
2. The Curriculum 
In a completely centralized school system like the French, the curriculum is the 
frame and pattern of the whole enterprise and is put together by the central authority 
with infinite care and deliberation. Options exist, such as permit emphasis on ancient 
or on modern languages, on a Latin or on a scientific training; but such fundamental  
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
choices once determined, the curriculum is built up in a consistent and balanced 
fashion for purposes that the French hold precious—a mind thoroughly disciplined, 
broadly informed, and finely sensitive to intellectual distinctions. The quality of the 
product is the sole consideration, and ruthless elimination in the final tests encounters 
no sentimental obstacles. 
Aside from its careful architecture, special devices bind certain parts of the curricu- 
lum still more closely together. Instruction in Greek, Latin, and the mother tongue 
is regularly given to one group of pupils by the same person; history and geography 
are likewise assigned to one instructor. In the elementary sciences and in modern for- 
eign languages, as well as in the minor subjects of a given curriculum, the master is 
likely to follow his pupils through more than one grade. The internal unity and con- 
tinuity of the instruction is thus considerably enhanced by continued interchange of 
reference where information is dealt with, not as a temporary asset to be bartered 
for so much credit, but as the raw material in a progressive building of ideas. 
3. The Teachers 
The unrivaled crown and glory of French education at any stage is to be found in 
its body of secondary instructors. No country in the world can show so powerful and 
so highly selected a group of scholars dedicated to a great public service. The reason 
for this is simple; in some respects almost cruel. Those who, at 18 years of age, have 
completed the secondary curriculum, must then usually spend from five to seven years 
in severe study at the university in order to have even a chance of success in the con- 
cours de Vagrégation whereby the secondary masters are chosen. Success means gov- 
ernment support for life in a position of marked distinction and prestige as professeur 
in a lycée. Failure means at best a repetition of the attempt and perhaps the far less 
desirable appointment to a collége. From a large throng of candidates, including many 
repeaters from past years, an annual series of oral and written tests brings to the 
top those who possess the indubitable genius of French scholarship and the power 
of presenting material in a skilful, even artistic, manner. Of these only so many are 
chosen as suffice to fill the very limited number of places vacant at the moment, usu- 
ally less than ten per cent of the candidates; all others must try again. 
Under such instructors pass the youth of the lycées from their eleventh to their 
eighteenth years. Caring little for “pedagogy” and therefore largely indifferent to 
the psychology of their pupils in the learning process, they do nevertheless serve con- 
stantly as brilliant examples of intellectual force and refinement. For pupils with 
minds awake and a disposition to work this is an incomparable advantage and oppor- 
tunity. Even for the less gifted it is impossible in the daily presence of such men to 
have other than profound respect for the intellectual interests that they represent— 
a respect that becomes a lifelong attitude toward fine things of the mind. Nowhere 
in the dycées does trivial and absurd “ instruction” turn education into a sickly joke, 
and beget in the pupil permanent scorn. If the French agrégés would as frankly rec-  
-P-A-G-E-117
QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 107 
ognize and deal with their problems of technique as they have with those of knowl- 
edge, they would be not only great scholars but the finest teachers in the world. 
The /ycées, though half as numerous as the colléges, teach twice the number of 
pupils; their influence in the secondary field is therefore preponderant and serves as 
a standard and tonic throughout the entire system. 
4, Differentiation of Ability 
Within the French secondary schools themselves selection or classification on the 
basis of ability is not conspicuous. There is no examination for admission, and owing 
to peculiar conditions the tests for promotion from year to year are extremely, in- 
deed notoriously, lenient. The authorities prefer to stake everything on the examina- 
tion for the Baccalauréat at the end of the course. This deadening procedure consti- 
tutes the chief academic grievance of the instructors, and apparently with reason. 
Competitive scholarships, though few in number— perhaps six per cent of the total 
—form as in England an admirable and stimulating factor in the system. A pupil who 
can prove his merit may rise from school to school at state expense. The program 
of the French Ministry of Education contemplates a large increase in facilities of 
this nature. 
In the provision made for more than one type of training above the elementary 
school France corresponds closely to the nations already cited. The counterpart of 
the Mittelschule in Germany and of the central school in England is the école primaire 
supérieure, which is the nearest approach to the American high school to be found in 
the French system. In the provinces this is normally a three or four year institution, 
admitting at the age of 13 to an identical first year and then usually dividing into 
three vocational groups: one industrial, one commercial, and one preparatory for the 
normal school. In Paris these schools are of a quality but little inferior to the lycées 
themselves. There are many agrégés among the instructors, and they successfully 
prepare large numbers for the same school-leaving examinations. Even outside of 
Paris there is a tendency to extend the course by adding two or three years of work 
for small classes in preparation for higher schools. The initial selection of pupils from 
the elementary school by special examination gives a grade of mind that compares 
favorably with that in lycée and collége where the selection is, without examination, 
by wealth and family tradition. Moreover, its teachers are selected elementary school 
teachers with special preparation, and in technique admittedly outclass the secondary 
school instructors. The schools being free are becoming increasingly popular, in some 
cases. at the expense of the lycées above them. In 1923 they enrolled 73,000 pupils, 
or about two-fifths as many as attended the lycées and colleges. 
The development of continuation and vocational schools in France is under way, 
but the facilities are as yet limited.

    108 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
IV. SALIENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN PROCEDURE 
The principles underlying European school procedure with which we have been 
concerned in the foregoing discussion may be summarized under two heads: Differ- 
entiation of minds according to their ability; The curriculum to which these minds 
are subjected. With the clear defects of European education from the American point 
of view—and they are many—vwe are not here concerned. 
A. DirrrerEntTIATION oF ABILITY 
Alike in Germany, England, or France European practice in secondary education 
is pivoted on the conception that there must be one type of school representative of 
the best that is known in respect to curriculum, instruction, and general discipline. 
This notion is derived, as has been noted, from the long-standing conviction that the 
greatest duty and glory of one generation with reference to the next is to advance and 
refine its spiritual possessions. Standing at the head of the educational system, such a 
school not only provides facilities whereby active minds may reach their full develop- 
ment, but also shapes the perspective of the entire people. It insists as a standard, not 
on the average or medium, but on the best practice that can be set forth. A nation ac- 
customed to a scale of values in which the best is thus frankly sought and acknowl- 
edged may still have to deal largely in the commonplace, but it will never mistake 
mediocrity for a god nor turn its own crudeness into a cult. 
In addition to the institution that embodies for each of these three peoples an 
ideal of instruction preparatory to its finest intellectual opportunities, there has 
gradually developed a more practical training, balanced in each case by important 
liberal elements. In the Mittelschule of Germany, or the central school of England, or the 
école primaire supérieure of France, a vast number to whom both content and method 
of the severer discipline is unattractive or unattainable will eventually find oppor- 
tunities suited to their ideals and stimulating to their ambitions. Beyond these, in 
turn, there will certainly be, for many years, a body of youth to whom any serious 
intellectual exercise, as at present organized, is difficult or repugnant, to whom the 
conformity and routine of the daily wage-earning employment are alike a comfort 
and a protection. For these the European nations have devised, in varying degree, 
advanced courses, or continuation schools, for the purpose of holding the pupil, while 
at work, in close touch with a helpful and steadying mental control until transition 
to full maturity shall have been accomplished. 
The mere differentiation above described is less significant than the fact that it is 
everywhere gradually being placed upon a merit basis. Wealth and social prestige 
have dominated these opportunities until the recent past. To-day in Germany and 
England this is no longer the case. In France the école primaire supérieure selects its 
pupils by examination, and the same principle is discussed for the lycée. The exam- 
ple of America has not been without its effect in inducing Europe to let brains from
-P-A-G-E-119
QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 109 
all classes go to the top. Yet although American high schools vary widely in details 
and quality, the usual practice is to give free access to a nondescript, unorganized 
mass of courses at a single level and that a low one. Europe prefers to offer care- 
fully organized groups of curricula suited expressly to at least three varying types of 
ability; to the most expensive of these it attaches a fee, but proposes to select its pupils 
on the basis of indicated promise and proved achievement, and in the case of Eng- 
land particularly, stands behind such selections when necessary not only with tuition, 
but with full support continued throughout the highest schools. 
Finally, it is obvious even from the inexact statistics available, that numerically 
Europe has moved far more slowly than the United States in attempting to provide 
formal training for its adolescents. This has been due in part, of course, to the in- 
ertia of an older, more stable and conservative society; and in part surely to the 
deadly weight of material loss and spiritual depression that have made it impossible 
to take advantage of the social release and revaluations brought about by the war. 
Another factor, however, has been continually present, namely, the habit of mind 
which considers education to be a thoroughgoing process that actually does some- 
thing to the pupil in exchange for sincere effort, and that consequently regards it as 
incapable of extension except as satisfactory conditions affecting pupil, teacher, and 
curriculum can be set up. This is the feeling that is behind the remark of one of the 
severest yet most enthusiastic critics of English secondary education. After quoting 
American statistics, he observes: “All will agree that our ideal for the time being, 
at least, must rather be Germany than America, the levelling up of the standard of 
existing schools rather than the spread of new institutions, to give a thorough educa- 
tion to the boys we have rather than a pretentious smattering to twice their number.”! 
In contrast with the European perspective wherein all education receives its tone 
from the habitual focus on excellence at the top, secondary education in the United 
States is to-day pivoted unmistakably at a point about midway toward the bottom. 
The cult of the average determines not only the spread but also the quality of our 
education. Our ideals exhaust themselves freely in the brick, mortar, and equipment 
of our school buildings, but are not permitted effectually to invade educational pro- 
cesses or to modify their product. Indeed, the attention that the European has lay- 
ished upon his most gifted pupils we have largely focused at the other end in endeay- 
oring to bestow the blessings of the average on the feeble-minded. 
In America the high school was originally dominated by the college, as is the case 
in England to-day. Definitely required curricula with a considerable choice of sub- 
jects — “classical,” “Latin-scientific,” “scientific,” “English,”— once reigned and col- 
lege entrance examinations formed the natural conclusion of a more or less consecu- 
tive and coherent course of study. The duller pupils gravitated to the “English” 
course, while the ablest took Latin and Greek. 
From an institution for a selected 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the population, our 
1 Norwood and Hope, Higher Education of Boys in England, 1909, p. 67.
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
high school has expanded to admit variously 50 per cent, 80 per cent, or even 100 
per cent of the fifteen-year-old youth. The urgent invitation of an eager and ambi- 
tious people has here and there been translated into legislation practically making 
the earlier high school years compulsory. 
The prevailing principle at work throughout this expansion has been a certain 
popular interpretation of democracy: “The same courses and teachers for all, and 
for each pupil a chance to get what he can.” Instead of requiring before admission 
that a pupil be fitted to profit by a given course of instruction, kept as nearly as 
possible at a fixed standard of excellence, it has been the practice to admit an unfit 
pupil and “let him try,” regardless of the fact that thereby the actual standard of 
the course has steadily been lowered to a level of mediocrity that will “pass” all but 
the notably indifferent or defective. 
Being thus under the bane of the average, we have invented a pedagogy to suit. 
Not only have earlier notions of formal transfer of discipline acquired in the study 
of the grammars of ancient languages been discarded ; the obvious mental discipline 
and tonic of profitable consecutive thinking in any subject, no matter how “useful,” 
has been sacrificed. The average pupil could not be held to strenuous intellectual 
effort, and our attention has been concentrated on making education interesting to 
the average pupil. Instruction in English has been reduced to a struggle with bad 
spelling and grammar together with a glimpse at such literature as will make imme- 
diate appeal to minds largely or wholly without literary background. The French 
boy after a painstaking study of difficult models prepares a carefully planned com- 
position on Moliére; the American child at the same point, as the alleged beneficiary 
of the newer psychology but really as the victim of the “average pupil,” is asked to 
tell informally what he saw on his way to school. Then we are puzzled as to why the 
French lad of ability comes through with a love and fine feeling for his national lit- 
erature while the American, whether able or not, is still concerned only with the 
passing show. Modern language teachers are far from exacting the accurate, pains- 
taking performance that characterized the earlier instruction in Latin and Greek 
which theirs displaced. Mathematics has become voluntary to a great extent; “ori- 
ginals” wholly so. In spite of the introduction of a great amount of new material and 
remarkable theoretical development, science instruction has nevertheless become more 
and more “ popular,” descriptive and applied; formulas and basic concepts requiring 
clear definition are accepted ready made because they cannot be handled otherwise 
except by capable minds; manipulative procedure in laboratories intended to illus- 
trate or to furnish the basis for inductive thinking has supplied an “interesting ” and 
tangible substitute for a decreasing body of clearly reasoned concepts; selections of 
scientific applications such as the “chemistry of the household arts,” “the physics 
of automobile construction,” bear further witness to the impossibility of dealing with 
the average pupil in high school to-day in terms of fundamentals that compel thought. 
Any teacher or principal can make clear to himself what has happened by fancying
-P-A-G-E-121
  
QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS lil 
for a moment how he would reorganize his material if he had only the top ten or 
fifteen per cent of the present school population to deal with. 
But the demands of the situation have far outrun our success in softening the old 
subjects to accommodate the incoming flood of pupils. A wholly nondescript crop 
of “electives” has appeared that may usually be taken anywhere, in any order, for 
full credit in amassing the necessary number of “ points” required to graduate. Thus 
one school of high standing requires the pupil in the junior year to study English, 
and directs him to choose any three subjects from the following: Latin, German, 
French, Spanish, physics, medieval and modern history, art, band, manual training, 
music, printing, stenography and typewriting, and home economics. The senior year 
brings political economy, chemistry, physiology, and botany, journalism, and Red 
Cross, to swell the list from which he again makes free choice. A four-year random 
sampling through these lists and a low pass mark in examinations that cover in each 
case solely the few weeks work in that subject for that term bring any youth to 
graduation on a par with the best. It must indeed be a sad specimen that cannot be 
accommodated on these conditions. 
Of the old college entrance examinations little remains except for a small group 
of private institutions accounting for from five to ten per cent of the annual collegi- 
ate admissions. The high school pleaded better knowledge than the college of what 
education is most appropriate to adolescence — a claim that should have been true ; 
thus far, however, it has paltered with its curriculum always on the line of least resis- 
tance, and has refused to substitute for the external examination any decent internal 
guarantee that its graduates were of a mind and had capacity really to profit by a col- 
lege education. With a very few significant exceptions the state university to-day 
stands open “on certificate” to youth prepared as abovedescribed, trusting to eliminate 
large numbers of them as soon as possible, but actually being choked in the process. 
The breakdown of the high school in its attempt to educate the whole people has 
been due to failure to keep clearly in mind wherein genuine education consists. The 
gradual but far-reaching changes just described have been inevitable, and desirable 
for some but not for all. We have been unwilling to admit that the old organization 
is unsuited to cope with its new task. Instead has come the inevitable attempt to 
justify ineffective procedure on social grounds: it is discovered that after all the in- 
tellectual aspect is unimportant, the real object is in some way to make good citi- 
zens by means of a great variety of extra-curricular activities that shall interest the 
youth and keep him happy. Education thus becomes anything that a pupil does in 
school in this mood and therewith reaches its nadir of abject sentimentalism.

Having brought together a presumably fit and homogeneous body of pupils, the 
European organizes them compactly into small groups for aneventful journey together

through the most profitable experiences of which they are capable. They are placed 
in charge of really accomplished scholars who will see them through from beginning 
to end, who will facilitate and enrich their development, and, through the intimate 
relations of several years, will come to stand to them in loco parentis for matters 
intellectual. In other words, the conditions of education are actually met: competent 
personalities are in intimate daily contact with growing minds over a prolonged 
period, and are helping them to assimilate a comprehensive body of knowledge suited 
to their abilities, with a definite purpose in view. 
The principle of selection and arrangement of material is in every case the same: 
a body of organized subject-matter, chosen not by the pupils but by the trained 
masters of their education with intelligent reference to their preferences and abilities, 
and presented as an ever-expanding structure of thought and experience, having its 
respective parts fused and interrelated to represent an orderly, coherent, and signifi- 
cant world. This body of knowledge is not dismembered, checked off haphazard for 
credit, and then dropped piecemeal into oblivion; it is kept, from year to year, a 
living and growing thing in all its parts, and by skilful review and cross relation- 
ships is finally presented to the pupil as part of himself with continuous roots reaching 
far back in his consciousness. It signifies to him, not a lot of discarded beginnings, 
but a veritable organic achievement with recognizable features into which he has 
wrought his convictions, his tastes, his insight. 
Toward such a curriculum the European boy feels a degree of respect that may 
hardly be imputed to the American youth who is asked to decide, in the plenitude 
of his wisdom, whether he will complete his education with a year of botany or “band” 
and “journalism.” Efforts increasingly wise and strenuous are made to see that the 
European pupil is placed in a curriculum that accords with his proved abilities, 
and in Germany particularly the individual instructor is trained unremittingly to 
adapt his material with the pupil’s psychology always in view. This done, however, 
nothing is permitted to weaken the sense of obligation with which a pupil faces his 
work, or to admit for a moment the validity of his temporary likes and dislikes. The 
carefully planned program of studiesis for him a sacred thing; itis there to be mastered 
and not to be referred step by step to his personal taste. On this point the whole tradi- 
tion of reverence and loyalty to learning, the attitude of instructors, and the sanction 
of public opinion are uniformly so relentless, that a problem in the matter simply 
does not arise. 
American practice presents a curious contrast to that just described. The children 
of all the people appear at the high school in one great undifferentiated mass. There 
are no fixed curricula and very few required courses, except in certain technical schools 
where the absurdity of the elective procedure is too apparent to be ignored. From 
a long list, all apparently of equal value, pupils choose, not curricula in keeping with 
a definite object they may have in view, but three or four subjects for immediate 
consumption, shifting their choices year by year. Parents, whose secondary training,
-P-A-G-E-123
    QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 118 
if any, was under different conditions, contribute little. School advisers wield an 
appreciable influence, especially at the outset before the opportunities of the system 
have dawned upon the pupil. Continuity, class unity and background, the sense of 
a clear road behind and ahead, of commitment to a serious intellectual undertaking, 
all disappear in this mincing of knowledge into the small, equal, and independent 
credit units which serve as counters in the game of going through school. One hears 
the cry of the shops: “Save your coupons and get a diploma!” 
From an administrative point of view the plan is admirable. The convenience, in 
a mobile population, of a common currency for use in transfer from school to school 
seems to have been a large factor in its development. The familiar “units” of a subject 
were crystallized into presumably equivalent fragments on an annual or semi-annual 
basis, largely as an administrative device. Once this scheme of interchangeable parts 
was well fixed, it facilitated the addition of new electives for reasons of local pride 
or convenience — an alternative in case of unpopular teachers, a resource with pupils 
that were hard to please, a concession to popular demand that the high school should 
teach something to “interest” everybody in the hope that more students would attend, 
if only for a few months. English school authorities require an assurance from the 
parents, often under penalty of money forfeit, that the pupil will finish the curricu- 
lum; we on the contrary urge that any fragment of a curriculum is proportionately 
desirable. The English school takes care lest a symmetrical educational structure be 
left without a roof; the American school offers a selection of portable, one-room cabins 
of uniform size and shape, and urges the pupil to try as many of these as he pleases. 
Such a system, similar to a factory system of multiple unit manufacture, can be 
extended indefinitely in point of size, and in fact is being so extended in large cities. 
Efficiency methods in the mass production of cheap articles seem to have been carried 
over instinctively from commerce to education. The reason why so little educational 
loss is felt with increase in size is that all schools, large or small, are operated on the 
same plan, the small ones not taking advantage of their smallness to emphasize the 
educational opportunities sacrificed by the large ones. Nevertheless, any enquiry among 
the directors of large institutions shows at once that, although helpless, they are fully 
conscious of the great disadvantage under which they are placed. 
The demoralization of a curriculum of this type is reflected clearly in both teachers 
and pupils. European secondary teachers may have shortcomings as instructors, but it 
is safe to say that none in France and Germany and few in England are deficient in 
their preparation as scholars. With us, on the contrary, the typical reaction to analysis 
of his own preparation on the part of the average high school teacher is one of humor- 
ous depreciation. The things one has studied but never teaches, and the things one 
teaches but has never formally studied make one of the breeziest chapters of our 
easygoing educational history. Indeed, one is never quite sure what one has studied: 
if required for credit, the course in question takes on good proportions; if sought for 
in residual knowledge or ability, it collapses into an apologetic “snap.” Even when
-P-A-G-E-124
  114 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
the work of school and college has been well chosen and concentrated, the disarticu- 
late conditions under which it is performed preclude the full measure of success. 
Teachers with such mental experience are likely to prove much more successful in 
dealing with a pupil’s personal and social problems than in achieving intellectual 
inspiration. A college education has been to them a challenge of personal worth and 
ambition rather than an absorbing intellectual adventure; its merits are a little diffi- 
cult to demonstrate, but it is emphatically “ the thing to do.” This is the torch that 
they pass on to their pupils. 
In relation to the pupil the modern curriculum is obviously the embodiment of 
the sugared doctrine of “interest” without obligation — a doctrine which he comes 
thoroughly to understand. For if immature “ interest” is to bethe criterion of election, 
it is plain that obligation ceases when for any reason “interest” disappears. Where 
native stuff is strong or home conditions are very favorable, the pupil supplies his 
own moral stamina, but the school’s contribution of moral pressure and example as 
regards the essential core of his intellectual activities is usually a blank. In its efforts 
to carry out a one-sided theory it has surrounded itself with a series of annoying and 
useless problems. A large class of these problems is illuminated by the astute and ex- 
perienced pupil who presented himself for further solicitous treatment with the chal- 
lenge: “I’ll bet you can’t educate me!” 
V. CONCLUSION 
There can be no question that suitable education during the adolescent yearsshould 
devolve as a right and obligation on every child that comes to maturity within our 
borders. The requirements of modern civilization have become exceedingly involved 
and exacting. It is becoming quite clear that the years between twelve and eighteen, 
or thereabouts, constitute the period during which proper education, combined with 
the development of sound health and normal habits, are of the utmost importance 
for the subsequent happiness of the individual and for the welfare of the nation. 
This doctrine is now so generally accepted that already the grouping for educa- 
tional purposes of the years around this period of life is far advanced with us. In this 
respect our development is parallel with the English or French model. Especially in 
cities, the completion of elementary education at 11 or 12 years of age and the re- 
planning of the next six years as a fresh epoch represent an improvement that must 
ultimately be widely adopted. 
The future of education in America depends on what we do with these six years. 
A concrete episode in the recent history of a large western high school may furnish 
a suggestive text. 
1 It should be obvious that this is said with no desire to impugn the validity of a rational interpretation of “ inter- est” in education. This principle has transformed the attitude of the successful teacher completely and with great effect. As a stimulus to the pupil’s effort it is invaluable; but it is not the final or sole appeal or justification. When 
“interest” and “ personality” have done their utmost, effort must still be made by the pupil.
-P-A-G-E-125
  QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 115 
Said the superintendent: “I got along with our present curriculum, or rather lack 
of curriculum, as best I could until my own son was ready for high school; then I 
went for it with an axe. Here was a boy that I knew had ability, a certain background 
of family training, and was willing to work. I was determined that he should have 
the best the school could give him. Out of our various courses I planned a four-year 
curriculum that would hold together. Then I selected from the entering class, on their 
tests and previous record, enough of the best pupils I could find to form a full di- 
vision, and assigned to that group the ablest teachers,we had in the school. With a 
little pressure these pupils were kept together throughout the four years. The morale 
of the group gained steadily from the start, and the institution got more brilliant 
graduates and later notable successes out of that class than it had had for a genera- 
tion. The reaction on the school as a whole was excellent, and I have tried from time 
to time since then to do the same thing, but administrative difficulties usually make 
it impossible.” 
What an intelligent father desires for his own son, an intelligent democracy de- 
sires and should provide for its children — an education for each according to his capa- 
city. The conception of a democratic education as one leveled to a colorless mediocrity 
is as grotesque an interpretation of democratic principles as a state of health in which 
abounding vitality in those who can acquire it is deprecated on the ground that only 
average health is fair to the community. No one believes this nor considers it a sac- 
rifice of democratic principles to applaud supreme ability, whether it be in highly 
trained artists, in race-horses, or in baseball players. The time can hardly fail to come 
when, at the expense of the whole people, maturing human ability of whatever grade 
may readily attain its native level. It is the recognition and attention bestowed upon 
such ability that fixes the measure of its subsequent obligation to its supporters. 
The foremost need of American secondary education is the frank establishment at 
the top of each considerable school system, of a school or a division that shall em- 
body, for those capable of profiting by it, the best we know in the process of educa- 
tion for this period of life. It should copy no other known institution, but taking 
advantage of the principles to which other great schools have owed their success, it 
should produce under our conditions a type of intellectual discipline that will be 
fully worthy to rank with these. 
The main object of this departure from our customary practice is not to satisfy 
a few bright minds, still less to compete with European schools; it is chiefly to set 
up a scale of values in education that will bring order into our confused ideas as to 
what clear and serious thinking is and can do. Although we deplore the second and 
third rate intellectual performance, that passes all about us for adequate education, 
we have as yet failed to create the conditions that will make anything else possible. 
The European has earned his reputation for thoroughness and a sincere national 
appreciation for a fine mental or spiritual product largely because at the top of his 
school system stands a workshop where such things are produced and insisted upon
-P-A-G-E-126
    116 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
for their own sake, and lesser education has thus true standards and a true perspec- 
tive by which to orient itself. 
Within our educational system the inauguration of a standard of high excellence 
at the top would serve as a welcome draught of clean, fresh air. Rightful intellectual 
interests are now smothered by athletics and other “student activities” because they 
possess little reality; and they possess little reality because they are not first class 
ideas suitably dealt with by pupils with first class minds. Old-fashioned honors and 
prize systems rewarding those who come out with the highest “marks,” whether in 
school or college, leave the situation untouched; they make almost no impression on 
pupil or student opinion. Were the best fifth or the best fourth of these same pupils 
to be drawn off into a separate group and given a sincere curriculum administered by 
genuine masters in such manner as to nourish and develop the intellectual morale 
always latent in such minds, the attitude not only of the top fourth but of the en- 
tire body of pupils would be completely transformed. 
There would then arise the problem of organizing suitable curricula for pupils of 
average ability whose right to an appropriate education now suffers from the con- 
fusion of such pupils both with the very able and with the very weak. With refer- 
ence to the latter it should be carefully considered whether a full-time school has at 
present anything to offer that is comparable with the education afforded by regular 
employment when this is supplemented by efficient schooling of a simple sort either 
on the continuation school plan or preferably on the “codperative” scheme of peri- 
odic alternation. 
Sentimentalism in education, as elsewhere, involves the emotion that would con- 
fer rewards, advantages, or distinctions where they have not been earned ; that would 
label the shadow for the substance. It is the polite name for educational “graft.” 
Sentimentalism is the chief stock in trade of many politicians who regard the pub- 
lic schools as an easy fountain of honor and of some educational philosophers who 
fail to see that honest dealing with a child’s intelligence is the basic and indispensable 
requisite in its education. } 
The European, if he were frank, could justly charge that a heavy mist of senti- 
mentalism envelops the intellectual operations of our American secondary education, 
and could point out how widely it differs from the wholesome atmosphere that sur- 
rounds our school sports and games. These are perhaps the most genuinely educative 
features that our schools at present possess ; they are honest, competitive, and thor- 
oughly objective. The boy who can jump over a bar five feet and six inches high 
bears an obvious relation to him who can jump but five feet four. The sports pro- 
gram involves throughout the selection and pitting of merit against merit in open, 
interesting struggle. Manage sports as we do our studies: minimize exact achieve- 
ment, and measure a contestant by his “effort” not by his success; invite a pupil to 
compete chiefly “with himself”; make up teams alphabetically instead of by rigor- 
ous selection ; keep chronic failures always on the squad; finally, to every one who
-P-A-G-E-127
QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 117 
can jump the bar at two feet give the same medal as mark of the finished athlete, 
and the significance and exhilaration that now attach to these exercises would rap- 
idly ooze away. The frank objectivity that we put into sport, the European puts 
into head work, and makes it engage the best powers of each pupil; we sentimental- 
ize our education, and the youth properly finds his own inventions more important. 
We need a new scale of values not only for the sake of intellectual reality in the 
school but also for the sake of the community at large. If the whole nation is to 
attend the high school, there is the place to give each citizen a true vision of hon- 
est, objective human relationships. It is complained of our communities that they 
despise the expert adviser, that their ideas of civic welfare are often blurred by su- 
perficial prejudice and prepossessions. Yet it is difficult to understand how any other 
condition can obtain if our citizens pass through a school where excellence is not dis- 
tinguished, where the stupid discovers no clear reason to respect the wise. It is noth- 
ing but the demoralizing theory and practice of a uniform, restricted output of labor 
applied to education. 
The organization of top sections, whether in separate buildings or as separate 
schools under one roof with the great school-communities that we already possess, 
will present difficulties, of course. But what business corporation would consider 
“administrative difficulties” when its dividends were rapidly leaking away? The 
indispensable features of the proposed organization appear to be as follows: 
1. A unit so organized that a small group of teachers may accompany their pu- 
pils from beginning to end, becoming intimately familiar with their needs and both 
collectively and individually serving them as their best interests require. 
2. A curriculum covering six years consisting of a few constant main-line subjects, 
varied in ultimate emphasis according to certain major distinctions in type of pupil, 
but with detailed selection and arrangement left wholly to the instructor in con- 
ference with his colleagues. 
8. A body of instructors whose scholarship is unquestioned and to whom success- 
ful teaching is both habitual and agreeable. To be competent secondary instructors 
these teachers must think in terms of curricula instead of courses, and they must 
be competent to integrate their respective subjects with the complete curriculum 
that confronts each pupil. We have done little to train such teachers in this coun- 
try, but the problem is one of great professional interest and with due selection and 
effort can be solved. 
It is an unwelcome task to suggest weakness and inadequacy in institutions that 
have endeared themselves, and have engaged our pride for what they appeared to 
représent. If defects exist, however, it is desirable for the native to outstrip the for- 
eigner in their candid appraisal. No nation on earth prizes genuineness and detests 
humbug more heartily than our own. We are a people of high ideals, but we desire 
reality in our approach to them. If quality in education is a real advantage and that 
fact can be made clear, there can be no doubt about the outcome.

THE STUDY OF ENGLISH 
EW educational agencies in the United States have been so consistently helpful 
as the College Entrance Examination Board, which this year celebrates its twenty- 
fifth anniversary. It has more than fulfilled the prophecy with which its first secretary, 
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, then Professor of Philosophy and Education and Dean 
of the Faculty of Philosophy at Columbia University, concluded his first report, in 
September, 1901: “The work of the Board will promptly elevate secondary school 
work in English, in history, and in the natural sciences to a new plane of importance 
and of effectiveness. It will control the examination system in the interest of educa- 
tion, and resist the tendency to make it a mere machinelike performance. It will de- 
clare and enforce standards of attainment which represent, not the labors of a zealous 
individual, however wise, but the mature judgment of a group of mature scholars of 
different training and points of view.” 
In 1901 the Board gave 7889 examinations to 973 candidates from 237 different 
schools; in June, 1925, 72,418 examinations to 19,776 candidates from 1700 schools. 
The influence of the Board may be said to have increased in an even greater degree. 
By no means the smallest part of its service has been its recognition and solution of 
the new problems that constantly arise in the preparation and selection of young 
people for entrance to college. 
The Carnegie Foundation has recently endeavored to aid in answering two of the 
most difficult and urgent of these questions, — What training and ability in the use 
of the vernacular may be expected from those who have passed through our secondary 
schools? What is an appropriate requirement for college entrance in the general sub- 
ject of English? 
Through the codperation of the Board and President Aydelotte of Swarthmore 
College, American Secretary of the Rhodes Scholarship Trust, the Foundation has 
secured critical comment on sixteen of the Board’s recent examinations in the subject 
of English —four given in 1919, five in 1920, two in 1921, three in 1922, and two 
in 1923 — from eleven teachers of English at Oxford and nine American Rhodes 
Scholars who have studied English at Oxford and are now engaged in teaching that 
subject in the United States.

The Board’s examinations in English are based upon the recommendations of the 
National Conference on Uniform Entrance Requirements in English, are formulated 
by the Board’s Examiners in English, and are approved or amended by the Board’s 
Committee of Revision, all in the light of the experience of the Board’s Readers in 
English. 
The National Conference on Uniform Entrance Requirements in English was estab- 
lished in 1893 to formulate specific aims in the study of English, recommend books for
-P-A-G-E-129
THE STUDY OF ENGLISH 119 
reading and study, and suggest desirable methods of examination. Composed of from a 
dozen to a score of university and college deans and professors and secondary school 
principals and teachers, representing organizations of colleges and secondary schools, 
chiefly in the Atlantic States, the Conference has met every third or fourth year since 
its inauguration. Its recommendations have been adopted by many universities andcol- 
leges,— particularly its suggestions that some books should be prescribed for careful 
study, others for general reading; that each book should be reasonably representative 
of some specific period, tendency, or type of literature; that all should be master- 
pieces ; and that both the school course in English and the final examination in that 
subject should fairly cover the range of English literature. 
The recommendations of the Conference on Uniform Entrance Requirements have 
been followed closely by the Examiners in English of the College Entrance Exami- 
nation Board, from 1901 to 1916 a group of three persons, including two representa- 
tives of colleges and one representative of the secondary schools. More recently there 
have been two committees entrusted with the preparation of the papers in English, 
each committee consisting of five members, three representatives of the colleges and 
two representatives of the secondary schools. In view of the increase in the number of 
candidates for admission to colleges for women, one of the college and one of the sec- 
ondary school representatives are now women. So far as possible the representation 
from the New England and from the Middle Atlantic States has been kept even. 
There have been several representatives from the North Central States. All of the ex- 
aminers have been successful teachers, some have become distinguished editors, essay- 
ists, novelists, and poets. 
After the question papers have been drawn up by the committees of examiners they 
are submitted to a Committee of Revision. Originally the representatives of the sec- 
ondary schools, who were experienced principals and headmasters appointed by the 
associations of colleges and secondary schools of the Middle States and of New Eng- 
land, formed this Committee. Since 1917, however, the Committee has met in six 
divisions or subcommittees. The size of the subcommittee to which the English papers 
have been submitted has varied from eight to thirteen, the average number of mem- 
bers being between nine and ten. The members of the committee are selected because 
of their experience in teaching English either in secondary schools or in colleges. An 
effort is made to represent the geographical divisions of the country and the schools 
and colleges for boys and for girls. Since 1917 the secondary schools have been repre- 
sented by twenty different teachers, eighteen men and two women, the colleges by nine 
different teachers, seven men and two women. The average term of service has been be- 
tween two and three years, although four members have served six or more years each. 
In this way one hundred and twenty-five persons from forty institutions have served 
the Committee, usually for terms of four or five years. 
The examinations thus prepared are given, now in 316 different centres, under the 
direction of trained and experienced supervisors.

The readers who have read and marked 130,000 examination papers in English for 
the Board, at its headquarters in New York City, have been more than three hundred 
in number, about two-thirds of them men and one-third women, half from forty dif- 
ferent colleges, half from one hundred and twenty different schools, half from the 
Middle States, nearly half from New England, a score from other parts of the country. 
The average length of service as a reader has been four years. The process of reading 
has included sundry conferences of groups and the whole body of readers. Various sug- 
gestions from these conferences and from individual readers have been communicated 
to the Board, the Committee of Revision, and the Examiners, for use in later papers. 
All of the questions set by the Board are published in annual volumes, and all of 
the questions in some sixty papers in English, from 1901 to 1923, have been issued 
in a single volume. Study of these publications has resulted in further suggestions, 
which have been used by the Examiners, who have used also, throughout the quarter 
century, many suggestions from the teachers of the one hundred and thirty thousand 
students who have taken the examinations in English. 
It is scarcely possible to imagine a more representative, impartial, and adequate 
method of preparing, giving, and marking written examinations. Both those who 
believe in such examinations and those who do not are agreed that the work of the 
College Entrance Examination Board may be taken as an epitome of the merits and 
limitations inherent in the nature of written examinations. It must be remembered 
that written examinations for entrance to college are taken by scarcely more than 
five per cent of the whole body of college students in the United States. Such examina- 
tions are required by only a limited number of universities and colleges, chiefly those 
of the greatest distinction.

The Oxford teachers, who have been so good as to study and comment upon the 
examination papers in English of the College Entrance Examination Board, com- 
prise both men and women, most of them holding more than one post, two deans, a v7 i ; i : chaplain, a librarian, half a dozen fellows, tutors, and lecturers, and two examiners,

almost every possible opinion, —from “The papers are radically unsound,” “they re- 
flect little credit on the teaching of English,” and “they are based upon a complete 
misconception of what an examination in English should be,” to “The questions are 
fresh and interesting,” they show “a fine quality of life and enterprise,” they are 
“evidently based on spirited and suggestive teaching, which has in view the right 
ends of literary education.” 
The chief objections of the most severe of the Oxford critics, who disapproves of 
the American examinations in every respect, are, briefly, the following: ‘The ques- 
tions are elementary or call for answers which must be either inadequate or vague... 
an essay should not be necessary . . . if such questions are to be set. . . it is ridicu- 
lous to ask a schoolboy to write... on some trite subject ... or a subject about 
which he cannot possibly know anything. . . . Power of composition . . . can be fully 
tested by questions on literature; ... papers on grammar . . . are quiteout of place. ... 
It is hardly credible that candidates should be asked, in an entrance examination to 
the University, to frame sentences which will bring out the difference of meaning 
between pairs of words. . .. The worst features of the papers are the questions on 
periods of literature and on books. . . . Nowhere is there a question which would test 
a candidate’s knowledge and appreciation; everywhere vagueness, slipshod methods 
and inadequate preparation are encouraged.” 
These are serious charges, deserving thoughtful consideration. Happily they are 
disagreed with, in every particular, by one or more of the critic’s colleagues. 
It is to be noted that wherever there are differences between the English and the 
American examinations this most severe of the English critics is apt to recommend 
the adoption of the methods used at Oxford. Such “transference of device” is com- 
mon in education, and reasoning by analogy is not uncharacteristic of those who 
deal with language and literature everywhere, but the weakness and the frequently 
disastrous results of these procedures, when the circumstances are not truly analo- 
gous, are equally well known. The forces of tradition and imitation are so strong 
that it is always difficult to establish the more scientific method which studies prob- 
lems in themselves and their relations, formulates appropriate convictions and aims, 
definitely adopts suitable procedure, and observes and experiments and adapts until

ford critics approach their undertaking in this spirit, recognizing that “each method 
has certain obvious advantages . . . and disadvantages.” Their comments, therefore, 
are penetrative and suggestive, and will be gratefully welcomed by American exam- 
iners and teachers. 
As to whether the American examinations are in general of an appropriate diffi- 
culty there is difference of opinion. Three of the Oxford critics feel that the exam- 
inations are “easier than would be expected,” “do not demand enough,” and “ lack 
the stimulus of a high demand.” Four find the opposite, that the questions are “too 
hard,” “on the whole too exacting,” that they demand “powers of selection and 
criticism which pupils are unlikely to possess,” and are “by no means beneath the 
dignity of a Final Honours Examination.” Two critics object specifically that the 
American papers are too long, “the mere reading . . . would take up alarge portion 
of the candidate’s time.” A third, however, points out that, whereas, “the English 
candidate . . . shows his mental quality partly by the skill with which he allots his 
time between the various sections of the paper . . . for the American candidate nearly 
all of the allotting is done.” Two critics find some questions “too elementary,” 
but think that “the first and compulsory question in each paper is of a type calcu- 
lated to exhaust the candidate’s energies”; “some are too simple . . . many are quite 
suitable for an Honours School of Literature at a University or for grown people.” 
In general, however, a good majority of the critics agree that the American ques- 
tions are “on the whole good,” “to be approved,” “very satisfactory,” “admirable,” 
“excellent,” “exceedingly well adapted,” and that they “might well serve as models.” 
In actual experience, of the 130,000 young people who took these examinations from 
1919 to 1925, from 50 per cent in 1921 to 58 per cent in 1922 received marks ranging 
from 60 to 100, 60 being generally accepted by colleges as passing. The general pro- 
portion of those who received 60 or over in all of these years taken together was 53 
per cent. 
The charge of “ vagueness” may refer to the manner in which questions are stated, 
to the general character of the answers that appear to be expected, or to the aim and 
scope of the preparation possessed by the candidates; to matters of expression, idea, 
or fact ; to the examiners, the preparatory schools, or the candidates. 
Half a dozen of the Oxford teachers agree that the American examinations are 
not vague in expression, but are “more direct and personal than English papers,” 
giving much detailed direction, so much, indeed, that it may waste the candidate’s 
time and hamper his initiative. Two believe that the papers give “too much help,” 
“too many hints”; two others that “questions should do a little to shape the answers 
. .. this seems to have been borne in mind in all the papers” and “I consider this 
advantageous; the English candidate often suffers from entire lack of instruction.” 
Two Oxford teachers find the American examinations lacking in broad general 
questions and too much given to questions that are specific and subdivided. Usually, 
however, they note “a tendency to give a large number of broad general questions”
-P-A-G-E-133
THE STUDY OF ENGLISH 123 
that “‘demand less detail than the English.” Two think such questions too general; 
another considers that “general information questions are anathema”; a fourth im- 
plies approval of them by saying “a general knowledge paper is required by some 
Oxford colleges.” One commends “questions of a broad type,” and three commend 
certain American papers as tests of “general intelligence” or “general intellectual 
capacity.” 
Several critics observe that some of the papers appear to give the candidates every 
chance of using any knowledge and power that they may possess, and doubt whether 
this is a sufficient test of thoroughness of preparation. This is a vital consideration, 
of which the American examiners are thoroughly aware. These examiners seek, among 
other things, to penetrate through training, which may be merely superficial, and 
through the effects of circumstance and environment, which may be equally incidental, ° 
to the genuine and fundamental nature of the youth who presents himself, and to 
evaluate the suitability of this nature for further opportunity. It may be impossible 
by these or any other means to distinguish ability from acquisition, but this is one 
of the serious endeavors of the American examiners. If Sir Francis Galton’s aphorism 
that “Nature is stronger than nurture” be true, excessive preoccupation with spe- 
cific acquirements is in danger of valuing the already cultivated branches more highly 
than the possibilities of further cultivation in the vine itself. 
There is little confirmation of the objections that essays are unnecessary, that the 
subjects given are trite or too ambitious, and that power of composition can be fully 
tested by questions on literature. The American papers give the candidate an oppor- 
tunity to choose a subject for a composition from a list of nine, twelve, or even fifteen. 
The critics who think this number excessive give opposing reasons which appear to 
balance : “the liberality of choice is apt to make things too simple”; “the weighing 
of alternatives is bewildering” and “takes too much time.” American examiners agree 
rather with the critic who considers these numerous alternatives “advantageous; the 
English candidate is frequently offered so small a choice of composition subjects that 
he is unable to do himself justice.” The objections of triteness or difficulty are not 
likely to apply to all of the subjects in such extensive lists,— actually other critics 
find the subjects given “mostly excellent,” “fresh and ingenious,” “any one would be 
anxious to write well on such subjects,” “they demand thought, imagination, and 
real constructive ability.” As to subjects drawn exclusively from books, one of the 
English critics states the American view, “questions within the range of the pupil’s 
own experience are better.” This is the explanation of the “bias in favor of subjects 
connected with politics or civics” which puzzles one reader. 
The critic who opposes questions on grammar for prospective university students 
does not agree with several of his colleagues. They approve such questions and consider 
them essential, not only because of their relation to composition but also as “ excel- 
lent tests of intelligence.” The recent widespread neglect of grammar in American 
schools, which is being corrected gradually, justifies the view that the questions given
-P-A-G-E-134
124 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
in this subject are elementary. Common sense not unnaturally doubts the usefulness 
of asking students to distinguish between the meanings of somewhat similar words. 
Tests of several million soldiers and students in schools and colleges, however, have 
confirmed the opinion of psychologists that there are few better methods of judging 
general intelligence. 
Concerning the questions on literature, the number of opinions is limited only by 
the number of critics. “ Nowhere is there a question which would test a candidate’s 
knowledge” is contradicted by “I appreciate the stress laid on knowledge of facts,” 
“this is a good test of literary knowledge,” and this “demands exact knowledge.” 
Three opinions that “some of the questions call for little but an accurate memory,” 
“one with a good memory could do well on most of them,” and “certain of the ques- 
tions testing memory invite cramming,” are balanced by four others, “I appreciate 
the stress laid on careful reading,” “these questions are exceedingly well adapted to 
test the ability to read intelligently,” “ the candidates’ answers must spring from their 
own knowledge,” and “mechanically absorbed teaching or reading cannot answer these 
questions.” There may well be difference of opinion as to asking candidates for lists of 
books that they have read: the answer may represent either knowledge or pretense. 
No one doubts the difficulty of testing the quality of a student’s observation, per- 
ception, and general literary awareness. Three of the critics commend condensations, 
paraphrases, summaries, and préces. One thinks that “Potting plays” and “summariz- 
ing sonnets” have nothing to do with the study of literature and that précis writing 
is a purely mechanical art, — “The ‘meaning’ which Milton gave can be given only 
in Milton’s words.” It is even more difficult to test appreciation. Four critics com- 
mend American questions that ask for estimates of characters, structure, or style as 
exceedingly well adapted to test literary intelligence and taste. Some like discussions 
of the differences between types of literature, others warn that such distinctions may 
become mechanical. Some write, “questions which suggest that poetry is to be taken 
to pieces or pigeonholed are unsuitable”; others point out that literature cannot be 
studied without analysis, and believe that the American questions avoid the obvious 
dangers of this method,—“'The method of treatment required for the passages of 
poetry is in accordance with modern ideas.” Certain questions on diction are objected 
to as “ highly technical,” “to point out the effects of choice of words and figures would 
require a great critic.” In general, however, various questions are considered “valuable 
tests of clear thinking,” because the answers “ require a great deal of intelligence,” 
‘must spring from the candidate’s own thought,” “his mind is not in leading strings 
but explores by itself,” they “demand critical judgment,” and there is “scope for 
originality.” 
The characteristic opinions that have been quoted quite obviously represent the 
varying views of individuals and small coteries,such as the College Entrance Exam- 
ination Board was established a quarter of a century ago to replace by the cumula- 
tive experience and judgment of widely representative groups. It is, indeed, somewhat
-P-A-G-E-135
  
THE STUDY OF ENGLISH 195 
disconcerting to find that a score of questions are pronounced good by one or more 
critics, but superficial, mechanical, unprofitable, or bad by one or more others; that the 
same question may appear “very good” and “almost worthless,” “excellent” and “a tra- 
gedy,” causing the critic to exclaim: “It would not test the candidates almost at all.” 
In two respects, however, the English critics are in substantial agreement,— as to 
the desirability of concentrated rather than comprehensive curricula, and as to the 
desirability of following such curricula closely both in teaching and in examining. 
Most of the Oxford critics would prescribe for study definite periods of literature, 
particular authors, and specific books, all in much smaller numbers than do American 
curricula. Undoubtedly, restricted requirements make possible greater precision and 
thoroughness in curricula, teaching, study, and resulting mental habit; undoubtedly, 
also, such requirements run the risk of being too narrow, unsuited to many students, 
and of stimulating undue pride of accomplishment in those to whom they happen 
to be adapted. Unquestionably, broader, more general requirements run the risk of 
allowing or encouraging only fragmentary, inaccurate, and superficial information, 
and the unfortunate mental habits that are associated with such information; unques- 
tionably, also, such elasticity may be exceedingly intelligent, humane, and fruitful. 
More than one of the Oxford critics expresses the view that, “ the only way to make 
the study of literature of value is to cause the student to read books and help him 
form his own judgment on them.” In any case, flexibility is unavoidable in dealing 
with “many men of many minds.” Whatever may be the situation in England, cir- 
cumstances appear to make the existing practice in the United States inevitable, at 
least for the present, — so many more candidates of much more varied training and far 
more diverse backgrounds press toward our colleges here. Each institution desires to 
hold its standards high, but each also desires no less to welcome gifted and promising 
students even though they may come from unpromising sources and through indiffer- 
ent training. 
There is now, furthermore, whether for good or ill, astrong tendency among Amer- 
ican schools to drop the old and fairly general educational purpose implied by the 
title “preparatory” and to regard as their chief obligation and privilege the fur- 
nishing to young people whatever education may appear to be most suitable for their 
nature and development, without reference to any training that may come later. 
Should such education in the schools happen to provide also a suitable preparation 
for further study, the schools would like to consider this merely a fortunate accident. 
This change of attitude shifts the emphasis from preparing students for examinations 
to preparing examinations to judge students, irrespective of the way in which their 
attainments may have been secured. American examiners must face the task of eval- 
uating whatever it may seem good to the schools to do; some of them hope even to 
apprehend ability in candidates who may never have been to school. Hence one Oxford 
critic notes: “The examination is therefore really comprehensive and I do not think 
there is anything to criticize in its purpose and plan.” One objection to the means 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  126 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
used in carrying out the plan might indeed be considered commendation: “This is 
a type of question which might bring out very good work from a rather able and ori- 
ginal pupil, but would produce a very feeble answer from an ordinary boy or girl.” 
In the matter of teaching, the Oxford critics appear to emphasize subjects of study, 
the American examiners to be interested primarily in students. In the phrase of one 
of the critics, English examinations are “addressed by a scholar to his equal in intel- 
lect if not in information . . . the American questions are obviously set by a teacher 
for his pupil.” English teachers may expect to develop “observant and impressionable 
readers, with the power to define their impressions, to enjoy the art of the writer, and 
to use their own language skilfully.” American teachers of English may and do hope 
to attain these ends with some students, but they can scarcely expect from others 
more than a small improvement in their ordinary use of language. The difference in 
possibilities is as wide as that between literature and literacy. It may be held that 
students who are merely literate have no place in college. Present American theory 
and practice receive them, provided they are promising in other fields. It may be held 
further that this situation invites only perfunctory teaching; the contrary is true. 
A further objection to the American examinations, voiced by one of the Oxford 
teachers, — “It would be very difficult indeed for a teacher to prepare a pupil ade- 
quately for questions of this sort,”— is answered by another,— “questions which 
demand a particular kind of skill learned by practice are no test of the most valuable 
kind of intellectual ability.” Half of the Oxford critics, however, appear to expect 
only this latter kind of preparation for examinations. The American examinations, 
on the other hand, are so adaptable that, in the words of one of the critics, “there 
can be little fear of injustice to individual candidates; in this respect many English 
examiners would do well to approximate more closely to American methods.” 
I 
The nine former American Rhodes Scholars who have furnished comments on these 
same examination papers all studied English at Oxford and all are now teaching that 
subject, —in seven universities, colleges, and institutes of technology,in New England, 
the Middle Atlantic States, and on the Western Coast. Two who have been associated 
with the work of the Board express “much faith in the beneficent effect of its influence.” 
Obe, who has taught both in institutions that use examinations for entrance and in 
those that do not, expresses strong preference for the examination system and adds : 
“Anything that any agency may do to induce colleges to admit on examination in- 
stead of on certificate will raise standards.” 
' These American scholars of European training, who are also skilled American 
teachers, all reflect in their comments their personal experience of the conflict of solid 
wisdom and sound cultivation, based upon the ordered heritage of tradition, with the 
contemporary despotism of irresponsible impulse which claims spontaneity and free-  
-P-A-G-E-137
THE STUDY OF ENGLISH 127 
dom but too often displays chiefly merely caprice and extravagance. It is impossible to 
commend too strongly the devotion and valor of these teachers in the cause of that dis- 
ciplined freedom which is the hope of the future. 
In general they find the examinations “fair and adequate. Their average is neither 
too difficult nor too easy, too subtle nor too unimaginative. They avoid pedantry on 
the one hand and require specific results on the other.” 
These teachers note, also, with appreciation, the recent tendency on the part of lead- 
ing colleges and schools to increase their use of the comprehensive examination, which 
offers greater latitude with regard to specific knowledge, and lays especial emphasis 
upon broad tests of mental power. “A college or university wishes to know what de- 
velopment, or probability lies ahead for the student.” This demands “a nice balance be- 
tween the factual and the suggestive,” “evidence of intelligence as much as indications 
of knowledge,” perhaps emphasis on “thought and organization rather than familiar- 
ity with texts,” because “able minds can easily supply themselves with information, 
whereas the merely informed must frequently be counted among the lost.” All of this 
has been so fully recognized that, in the examinations, “Questions concerning liter- 
ature tend increasingly to avoid any suggestion of dogmatism or any demand for 
provable fact. They allow of an infinite variety of answers rather than mastery of 
assigned school tasks.” “Since colleges cannot assume that their entering freshmen 
have mastered any one classic or undergone any standard course of discipline they 
virtually ignore specific school work and apply tests of mental efficiency.” 
Questions that make it “ possible to recognize easily the boy or girl of exceptional 
precocity or special cultural advantages” do not so easily distinguish between actually 
superior qualities and mere sophistication, or the accidental and perhaps superficial 
results of a bookish environment. Even those who agree that “Past accomplishment 
under the strict guidance of mature teachers is only a slight measure of capacity, 
ability, and will to develop,” may yet doubt whether genuinely solid school work finds 
in the newer examinations the recognition that it deserves. Few will disagree with the 
critic who writes : “I would not permit a student to enter college entirely ignorant, no 
matter how great his power.” 
The claims of sound preparation are thus stated: “The years of the student up to 
the time of entrance into college should be spent largely in the acquisition of exact 
knowledge, and examinations should test knowledge of what students have studied, 
their exactness, and power of clear and concise expression.” “More emphasis upon 
real knowledge and essential principles would make a more effective bond between 
school and college and save a great deal of wasted effort.” “Simpler and less experi- 
mental school curricula would assure the college that certain fundamental subjects 
had been mastered at school and could be used as bases for the work of the freshman 
year.” For such purposes these American Rhodes Scholars feel that “ these examinations 
are eminently just, not too exacting, marvelously uniform in difficulty, fair in range, 
allowing for large variety of interest.”
-P-A-G-E-138
  128 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
On the other hand, these critics are confident that the examinations should “appeal 
not only to average students but also to those who have read and studied outside of 
the classroom.” “I would rather have a boy or girl who had browsed, independently 
and widely, even though he had never anatomized one play or one poem.” Certain of 
the present questions are felt to be intended for such students. Some of them are 
“quite as hard as my Oxford tutor used to assign me after I had studied Shakespeare 
for four or five years,” but this isnot considered inappropriate. For similar reasons 
there is welcome for “the growing prominence of essay subjects concerning which 
candidates can scarcely be supposed to have thought previously.” “I believe that I 
can come nearer to judging a student’s mental capacity and likelihood to do well in 
college from an essay written under the freest possible conditions than from any 
other evidence.” 
In order that the examinations may both test acquirement and discover ability, 
these critics, with considerable unanimity, suggest or imply the desirability of a rather 
sharp separation of the questions that deal with language from those that deal with 
literature. They hold that emphasis on vocabulary, usage, grammar, and composition 
could do full justice to the student’s need of adequate expression in every activity of 
daily life, and that the breadth and thoroughness of secondary schooling in English 
might be tested by questions concerning these matters alone. After thus making sure 
of the minimum competence and accomplishment in English that are indispensable 
for any further progress, questions concerning literature might be made sufficiently 
comprehensive and discriminating to reveal almost any grade of special ability. 
IV 
The whole problem of the teaching of English has been discussed recently in mas- 
terly fashion by a committee of fifteen distinguished educational administrators, 
scholars, and teachers, appointed by the Right Honorable Herbert Fisher as Presi- 
dent of the British Board of Education in 1919. Their report, completed in 1921, has 
fortunately been reprinted for wide circulation in the United States (in 1924). The 
following summary can indicate only a part of its significance. 
The committee followed its problem wherever it led, and repeatedly arrived at 
the conclusion that “the present inadequate conception of the teaching of English 
is not a separate defect which can be separately remedied. It is due to the failure to 
conceive the full meaning and possibilities of national education as a whole. We are 
compelled to indicate certain principles which must form the basis of a complete 
scheme of national education as an indispensable condition of success in providing 
for the best use of English.” Although, according to the committee, it is generally 
understood to be the duty of the state to see that every child shall receive an educa- 
tion, the meaning of education is generally misunderstood. The great majority con- 
sider it to be the reception of information, — an activity which provides suitable
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE STUDY OF ENGLISH 129 
occupation for the young, and is also expected to aid them, somehow, in the struggle 
for material existence. As a matter of fact, contemporary education is remote from 
every-day life, having long proceeded upon the false theory that the compulsory per- 
formance of hard labor gives the mind a general strengthening. Recent efforts toward 
replacing compulsion and obedience by purpose and interest show far better results. 
Education, of course, is not the storing up of information but the development and 
training of faculties, not by the presentation of facts but by guidance in the acquisi- 
tion of experience. Such experience of both nature and human relations may come 
through home, playground, or classroom, or in the thought and feeling stimulated by 
the power of an author or the appreciation of a teacher. 
English is often regarded as an inferior study which has little claim on the cur- 
riculum and may be taught by anybody. Actually, English is a matter of such vital 
concern that it should take precedence of all other studies as their one indispensable 
preliminary and foundation. Until a child has acquired a certain command of the 
vernacular, little other development is possible. Speech constitutes his earliest and 
most direct relation with his complicated environment, and later his chief means of 
self-realization and communication. We cannot state clearly what we do not know, we 
cannot know clearly what we cannot state. Adequate utterance is essential not only 
for clarity, but for further thought. Language is not only our medium of thought, 
but its material and process as well. No one of these statements can be questioned 
successfully, and yet, since expression is an art, they mean that mind and character 
cannot be developed without art. This should alarm no one, but lead to a better 
understanding of the function of art in every-day life. 
Asa channel of formative culture and a medium of creative art English literature 
is more important than the classics. Greek literature is a main source of science, his- 
tory, philosophy, art, and poetry, as Latin is of language, law, and social studies. 
Both are indispensable to broad culture, but no one can hope to make both or either 
a fundamental part of a national system of education. English literature, on the 
other hand, is a similar and sufficient channel of culture and art, it mingles the in- 
fluence of many ages and many countries, it has more direct and more diverse rela- 
tions with contemporary life, its language is native and necessarily familiar to great 
masses of people for whom there is no other access to great literature. For national 
education as a universal, reasonable, and liberal process of development no other 
means can take precedence, no other means is available for English-speaking people. 
To provide the common discipline and enjoyment of such an education is by 
no means impossible. Its results would form a new element of national unity. Un- 
educated utterance would no longer embarrass or retard. Language would come to 
be regarded, and properly, as the chief symbol of nationality, a source of affection 
and pride. Great literature would not be considered too good for any or all, but a 
common possession, interest, and experience. This is the situation to-day in France. 
As the essential basis of liberal education for all, the English language and liter-
-P-A-G-E-140
  
130 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
ature must accordingly be the chief concern of the earlier stages of education in all 
schools. Clear articulation and correct pronunciation, clear and correct oral and writ- 
ten expression, reading aloud with understanding and emphasis, silent reading for 
information and study, the enjoyment of literature as personal experience, pleasure, 
and profit—these are the stages. 
Reading and writing do not, however, as Dogberry and many others think, “come 
by nature.” They can be made a means of personal experience and expression, of 
pleasant and profitable contact with great natures, great minds, and great experi- 
ences only if they are taught by teachers of competence, insight, and enthusiasm. The 
pedantic, conventional, meticulous, and dull will only repeat the failure of the past— 
and of the present. There must be sound knowledge, illumined feeling, and genuine 
personality. Every teacher who uses English in dealing with any subject must be an 
example and a teacher of spoken and written English. No teacher can be too highly, 
trained, no teaching too good; improvement is possible through this means alone. 
More training, higher pay, better libraries, and more generous intellectual opportu- 
nities of all kinds are essential. Not only all officials, but all university teachers, suc- 
cessful authors, and generous citizens might well codperate to advance these desira- 
ble, these necessary ends. 
Almost every one of the English committee’s one hundred and five specific con- 
clusions and recommendations would be helpful in overcoming the many and serious 
limitations of the contemporary teaching of English in the United States. 
Among the chief suggestions of the committee are the following : 
National education needs to be reorganized as a universal, reasonable, and lib- 
eral process of development. For this the only possible basis is English. 
In general, the whole of the educational process is available for the teaching 
of English. It should never be subordinated to any other subject, at any time, 
or at any stage of advancement. Every teacher who uses English in any way is, 
inevitably, a teacher of English. No examination paper or written exercise in any 
subject should be passed unless its expression is at least respectable. 
Training in speech must begin with the beginning of schooling and should 
continue until its end. Development of the power to make lucid statements is 
essential in itself and as the foundation of proficiency in writing. Reading aloud, 
recitation, debate, and dramatic performances are valuable, for both language 
and literature, at every stage. 
English grammar, as well as that of the modern and ancient languages, needs 
anew, uniform, and simplified terminology. Emphasis should always be on func- 
tion rather than form. Mature students may well follow courses in the life and 
growth of language. 
The general and invariable aim of English composition should be the develop- 
ment of at least a minimum adequacy for every-day use. “Business English,” for 
example, should be merely good English. Composition may be used also as a 
means for discovering the possession of literary ability. 
The relation of English literature with environment and vocation, with every 
other subject in the curriculum, and, especially, with the other creative arts, 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE STUDY OF ENGLISH 181 
should be made clear and constantly emphasized. For most students there will be 
no other introduction to the humanities. For the fortunate few, acquaintance 
with English literature should precede any study of foreign or classic literature. 
Wide reading, especially in good contemporary literature, is to be encouraged. 
Appropriate library facilities must be available. 
Scholarships, prizes, and all similar encouragements should not continue to 
favor other departments at the expense of English. More and larger endowments 
for English should be secured. 
Every teacher of every subject should have adequate training in English. All 
teachers who have any special aptitude for English should be enabled to devote 
themselves to it completely. Only those who love it can teach it well; they should 
enjoy every desirable freedom of method. Every possible improvement of train- 
ing, tenure, salary, and pension should be secured for them. Lectures by special- 
ists and well-known authors should be encouraged. 
7 
Good teaching is of course the conclusion of the whole matter. The Carnegie Foun- 
dation has devoted many publications to the purpose of its incorporation: “to do and 
perform all things necessary to encourage, uphold, and dignify the profession of the 
teacher.” The following sentences from one of its bulletins ' may not inappropriately 
conclude the present discussion : “Universal compulsory education, though far from 
achieved, is a familiar slogan; but to the content of this education, and to the means 
used in providing it, we have paid little attention. . . . Genuine education, in a sense 
consistent with any honest vision of its meaning, can proceed only through immediate 
contact with keen minds fully informed and persuaded of what the rising generation 
may become and dedicated to such achievement. Persons so equipped will not be had 
unless the distinguished opportunities and rewards of life are attainable through 
teaching careers. Convince the American public that the alleged product of a fine 
teacher is real, and the cost will speedily become a wholly secondary consideration.”

COLLEGE ATHLETICS 
QUARTER of a century ago, a writer on student life and customs selected the 
years about 1890 as the period in which abuses in athletics reached a climax and 
from which an improvement could be traced. At the turn of the century he wrote, 
“the two problems which confront college athletics to-day are, (1) the realization of a 
higher ideal of sport which involves the relegation of the all-important factor of in- 
tercollegiate competition to a secondary position, and the substitution therefor of an 
adequate conception of physical culture, and (2) the extension of the benefits of or- 
ganized games to a much larger number of undergraduates.” ' His words anticipate by 
some twenty-five years the burden of recent reports on certain phases of present-day 
college athletics. If the implied strictures apply as well to the conditions of 1925 as 
to those of 1901, wherein lies the progress in American college sport that has so often 
been attributed to the past twenty-five years? 
It may perhaps lie, first, in the recognition, which is gaining currency to-day, that the 
abuse of intercollegiate rivalry and the desirability of extending the benefits of organ- 
ized games to as many students as practicable, are phases of a single matter, and, sec- 
ondly, in the conviction, which perhaps may as yet be only a hope, that athletic sport, 
freed from the tendencies that at present overlay it, can be made to have value as a part 
of the process of education. 
Mass ATHLETICS 
For all of the problems involved the solution is held by many to be mass athlet- 
ics. The purpose of mass athletics, by whatever name it is called, is to secure the par- 
ticipation of as many physically fit students as possible in games and sports. Athletic 
contests between classes and other units in the common life of the university, indi- 
vidual play at tennis, squash, handball, golf, boxing, fencing, sculling, running, and 
other pursuits are to provide recreation and wholesome exercise according to the stu- 
dent’s capacity. Physical examinations are given with the intention of preventing his 
entering games for which his bodily condition does not qualify him, to open the way to 
sports best suited to his powers and needs, and to measure his progressive physical de- 
velopment. In the degree to which these ends are secured, and in proportion as the stu- 
dent body is induced to play games out-of-doors, mass athletics is commonly regarded 
as successful. 
Somze Dancers 1n Mass ATHLETICS 
Other factors, however, both physical and moral, must be considered in any at- 
tempt to evaluate the results of mass athletics. To a growing number of physicians 
it is a grave question whether hard athletic indulgence during adolescence is worth 
the price the athlete often must pay when he reaches full maturity. “In colleges, the 
oversized boy, tall and overweight, is excellent football material. If not overtrained

and heart-hurt at the time of the athletic tests, he acquires a hypertrophied heart 
and hence an increased systolic blood pressure, which makes him uncomfortable and 
mentally and physically ‘foul’ (as he terms it) as soon as his athletic life ceases. He 
is from this time on an impaired insurance risk; as a rule, he does not live to his expec- 
tancy. In practically all colleges and in some schools, physical medical examinations 
aremade of each boy or youth before he is accepted and trained for any special 
branch of athletics, and the diseased or damaged hearts are eliminated. But what medi- 
cal examination of a boy or youth can exactly determine his reserve heart strength?”* 
Acute heart strain may occur not only in the competitive contest, but even in the 
period of training that supposedly fits the participants for the final struggle. The oars- 
man-hero who topples over in the shell at the finish of the university race is not the 
only victim of utter heart exhaustion. 
The non-physical factors must concern the physician less than those who are re- 
sponsible for other phases of the education of youth. Even some undergraduates have 
expressed apprehension lest the careful supervision that mass athletics implies may 
deprive sport of some of its spontaneity, and lest too formal or too complicated a 
system of intramural contests may shortly leave no place for the “ duffer” or the 
“dub.” The practice of “scouting for ‘varsity material” among the participants in 
intramural games is likely to prove a deleterious influence, for, once discovered, the 
“promising” if reluctant sportsman can scarcely be expected to resist the calls of duty 
to Alma Mater, on the one hand, and of personal fame, on the other. At some institu- 
tions a determined attempt is made to engage as many men as possible in prepara- 
tion for intercollegiate contests, to benefit these individuals by a regular and rather 
rigid course of training under competent direction, and to secure a large reserve of 
recruits to be drawn upon in the development of various teams. Squads from which 
members of teams representing the university are selected are kept large at all times 
during the playing season and cuts in them are postponed. 
Some phases of such an athletic program are undoubtedly beneficial. But late squad 
cuts encourage rather than diminish the idea of intercollegiate competition and mass 
rivalry, and in so far as this idea is baneful it must affect any activity that it per- 
meates. On this ground the endeavor to engage as many men as possible in inter- 
collegiate competition must be sharply distinguished from mass athletics in its best 
phases. A more wholesome future for college and university sport rests not so much 
upon further disseminating the idea of athletic rivalry between institutions as upon 
modifying it and perhaps curtailing it.

Mass athletics is costly. Its success depends upon extensive playing fields, compe- 
tent and tactful promoters, and almost unlimited supplies of athletic equipment. All

-P-A-G-E-144
    184 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
of these requirements entail large current and capital outlays. Even the best endowed 
university could scarcely afford the expenditures from present college funds neces- 
sary for one autumn’s mass athletics. Many administrators have already committed 
themselves to the view that mass athletics is a most beneficial element in the educa- 
tion of youth, and projects involving it are being enthusiastically promulgated at 
more than one institution. 
Yet, on the other hand, few branches of college athletics are self-supporting, even 
with the help of student fees. Of college sports, three are occasionally prosperous: 
basketball, baseball, and football. The success of mass athletics is almost everywhere 
dependent upon the financial prosperity of football alone. 
Mass athletics offers only one of the reasons why football at a great university 
must be made a paying venture, Every chance that may lead to commercial success 
must be availed of—even the gate receipts may be insured. The compensation paid 
to coaches, trainers, graduate advisers, side-line and other physicians, rubbers, the 
equipment often used a few times by “first-string” players and then passed on to 
less pampered or less important contestants, the straw or sawdust for the field in 
case of rain, some of the expenses of training tables, to say nothing of the sums repre- 
sented by the erection and maintenance of stadia that could accommodate the entire 
population of a good-sized city —the cost of all these items, as well as the support 
of other forms of intercollegiate athletics, must be borne by football. When to that 
cost is added the burden of financing mass athletics, in whatever guise, the impor- 
tance of winning teams is seen in its real perspective, for winning teams bring pub- 
licity and publicity brings large gate receipts. 
Tue Desire to Win 
At the root of the Anglo-Saxon tradition of athletic sport, to whatever remote 
corners of the earth it has penetrated, lies the desire for victory. Games, even the 
mildest, are nothing without the element of contest, which is the very core of sport. 
The notion of the game for the game’s sake may be held up as an ideal, but that 
ideal gains whatever reality it may possess from the fact that a man who can play 
a game well can excel his competitors. The player who does not play to win is intol- 
erable to friends and opponents alike, whether in one hemisphere or the other. The 
crowd that follows the boats along the Iffley towpath is as noisy and tense as the 
throngs on the observation trains that trail the shells at New London, and even more 
gay with color. Boat-race night in London is as strident as in New Haven, nor is the 
tumult confined to the natural partisans of the universities. The English public fol- 
lows sport, amateur or professional, with a seriousness unknown to the general run 
of American newspaper readers. The fundamental differences between English and 
American college games lie not in the presence of the desire to win in one country 
and its absence in the other, but in the values that are set upon the victory, in the 
means that are felt to be justifiable to secure it, and in the number of spectators.

  COLLEGE ATHLETICS 185 
If our college athletics and especially mass athletics do possess the wholesome ele- 
ments that their apologists and promoters have claimed for them, and if our colleges 
are to train the habits and powers of youth, and predominantly its mental habits and 
powers, we should recognize that athletic sports and games must be made to serve this 
end and primarily this end, if our higher institutions are to be intellectual agencies. 
Grant this much, and we are faced by the fact that all the benefits that may de- 
rive from games and sports for the student depend for their existence upon the finan- 
cial prosperity of football. Abolish—assuming for the moment that the step were 
possible— admission charges to football games, and not only will intercollegiate 
competition go, but mass athletics will be rendered impossible before its ideals have 
begun to become realities; the good will perish with the bad. 
Tue Savine or Cot.ecE Sport 
Athletic sports and games can be made a beneficent force in American education, 
but not by continuing their commercialization or by permitting them longer to re- 
tain their preéminence in our distorted scale of academic values. They will never be 
abolished, and he would lack judgment who advocated that they should be. Their 
more valuable qualities can be enhanced and bent to secure some of our educational 
needs that enable men to live as men should among their fellows. Their undesirable 
elements can be diminished. 
If, then, educational virtue does inhere in athletic sports from which the taint of 
commercialism and mass rivalry has been eliminated, and if this taint may endanger 
even mass athletics, only one course seems open to those institutions which desire to 
render intramural games serviceable to education. Some form of financial support is 
required, sufficient to make resort to the methods of the showman and the professional 
sport-promoter unnecessary. Hitherto, athletics has absorbed the college; it is time 
for the college to absorb athletics. 
Tue Rarionarizine or CotLEcE ATHLETICS 
At present, three groups, perhaps four, unite to direct our college athletic policies: 
students, faculty, alumni, certainly, and in some instances the townsmen, who are be- 
ginning to make their influence felt. That students of college age should acquire a 
predominance in the annual disbursement of sums running from a half to three quar- 
ters of a million dollars, which to-day represent the gross income from athletics at 
certain larger universities, is not to be maintained for a moment. Faculties are sup- 
posed to consist of specialists in scholarship and education, not in the financing of 
athletics. The amount of time and responsibility that faculty advisers even now are 
forced to devote to undergraduate sports is not always to the best scholastic interest 
of universities and colleges. The panacea of “ faculty control of athletics” is not the 
universal remedy that some have supposed it to be. Until alumni justify by good
-P-A-G-E-146
136 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION 
works their present powers, the wisdom of giving them still further voice in the mat- 
ter is dubious. Of late years, the townsman, with his demands that large stadia be built 
in order to fill his pockets, whether from construction contracts or from seasonal sales 
to visitors, his over-valuing of winning teams, and his insistence upon being admitted 
to the big games at the state university which he as a taxpayer helps to support, is 
becoming a sinister figure. Clearly, neither students, faculties, nor alumni are in posi- 
tion to assume further duties or demands connected with the control of college ath- 
letics as it exists to-day. 
It should, however, be possible to secure a reapportionment of responsibilities and 
a quickening of judgment respecting athletics in alumni, faculty, and students. Once 
let these groups be awakened, and whatever is demoralizing in the townsman’s influ- 
ence is minimized. For such a change the initiative must rest with the American col- 
lege or university president. 
The American system of control in higher education, for good or for ill, has vested 
in the college president powers that are, or have been, almost absolute, yet the presi- 
dent is the servant of all masters. Winning athletic teams and the huge crowds that 
witness games have had a powerful effect upon the publicity that makes for increased 
registration. Perhaps, after all, our fundamental error has consisted in an inability to 
distinguish between undue expansion and wholesome requisite growth. Be that as it 
may, at a time when the college president might have curbed his alumni in their hue 
and ery after numbers, he often ran with their noisiest. When he might in respect of 
athletics have molded the academic conscience and re-formed the opinion of under- 
graduates, he has often left the task to others. University funds have been loaned — 
at good interest, to be sure — for the erection of stadia to accommodate spectators 
at football games. Gate receipts, schedules, salaries of coaches and attendants, the re- 
payment of loans and the meeting of interest charges, disciplinary administration, the 
taxation of playing fields, the scholastic standing of players, eligibility, and all the 
practices that are darkened by what we call commercialism without knowing precisely 
what we mean, have been permitted to corrupt a form of activity that might have been 
made of great value in training the powers of youth. Now that the current is flowing 
with its full force, the college president must consume years of persuasion to accom- 
plish in athletics results that thirty or even ten years ago he might have achieved in 
months. In this respect, he has been a leader who has not led. 
Any institution whose alumni, undergraduates, and faculty desire wholesome and 
rational athletics can have it both within its own walls and in modified competition 
with rivals. A college that sets about securing such athletics to itself may suffer defeat 
on the playing field, its registration may diminish, and its constituency may clamor; 
but its faculty will in time discover a change in the scholastic temper of its student 
body, and its undergraduates will learn the distinction between true athletic sport and 
noisy and scruple-diminishing competition.

PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
HOSE who are concerned with the effectiveness of our public education will 
observe with satisfaction the growing practical interest in teachers retirement, 
which has manifested itself in the United States, during the year ended June 30, 1925. 
Perhaps the most hopeful of signs is the fact that both legislators and teachers are 
approaching retirement problems more deliberately now than in the past. Few, if any, 
leading representatives of either group have seemed to be satisfied with the enact- 
ment of teachers retirement laws without detailed study, and in some instances this 
hesitancy and the resulting discussion appear to have opened the way tomutual under- 
standing and codéperation. It is likely that the increasing cost of public education the 
country over will lead to the realization that in the long run one of the most eco- 
nomical means of improving the quality of our education is a sound state-wide teach- 
ers retirement system. 
Tracuers RetirEMENT: THEORY AND ExpeRIENCE 
Local, State, or National System? 
Not infrequently the question confronts a local body of teachers whether they shall 
establish or continue their own retirement system, or join a state system. The ques- 
tion has recently arisen in Indiana, and the current discussion of proposed legislation 
in Nebraska, Tennessee, and West Virginia has approached it. An attempt to answer 
it can be phrased only in general terms; conditions vary in each state and its compo- 
nent counties or municipalities, and an answer adequate for any given locality can be 
framed only from a detailed knowledge of its conditions. 
In general it may be said that the state, as distinct from the municipal or federal 
unit, seems to be the agency that can most economically administer a public retire- 
ment fund, just as it is regarded as the political division most readily responsible for 
the conduct of the broader educational system. The federal unit provides, and rightly, 
for the retirement of its own servants, but any attempt to make it responsible for the 
retirement of teachers not employed directly by it must place upon it a burden intol- 
erably unwieldy, expensive, and complicated. In the existing social order such a trans- 
fer of the duties of the state could be regarded only as anomalous. On the other hand, 
except in the largest cities, where the number of teachers might conceivably over- 
burden a state retirement system, the administration of a county or municipal system 
is likely to cost a sum out of due proportion to the end it is designed to serve and 
the funds involved. The collection of contributions from participants is properly a 
function of the employing unit, but the question whether such a unit can economically
-P-A-G-E-150
  140 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
invest and keep active the funds so accumulated, is open to the closest scrutiny. Given 
the adequate safeguards of financial operations that appropriate state legislation pro- 
vides, it seems both good theory and well-founded practice to regard the state as in 
general the unit responsible for teachers retirement within its borders. 
The advantages to the teacher of a state retirement system as contrasted with a 
local system, are many. A state provides a by of men and women working in a 
given occupation under comparable conditions of climate, health, salary, advance- 
ment, and scale of living. At the same time it offers an opportunity for migration 
and yet for the retention of the benefits of the system, which is highly desirable. Its 
teachers are usually already organized into a professional body for mutual personal 
and vocational advancement, and the meetings of such a body provide convenient 
opportunities for discussing any features of the educational system which may arise, 
and of which teachers retirement is really a part. Furthermore, the financial burdens 
assumable by a state for its teachers retirement system can result in a direct saving 
to individuals in the expenses for operation, inasmuch as appropriations from the 
state treasury can be made to cover such a unit economically and satisfactorily. The 
expense entailed in actuarial supervision might prove a burden for a political sub- 
division smaller than a state. The only exceptions to these general statements lie in 
large cities, or in localities where public spirit or individual philanthropy makes pro- 
vision for operation or for accrued liabilities whieh eases the burden. Within this 
limitation, it would seem that for public school teachers, the state is the unit which 
can most economically and effectually administer a system of retirement. 
Inaugurating a State-Wide Teachers Retirement System 
Usually the process of setting up a sound teachers retirement system for a state is 
long and somewhat arduous. During the past year the problem has confronted teachers 
in Colorado, Delaware, Missouri, Oklahoma, Oregon,South Dakota, and Virginia, and 
because it has been difficult for those interested in such a movement to know how to 
launch it, a brief exposition of some of the steps involved may be of assistance. 
The movement looking to the establishment of a state-wide teachers retirement 
system originates sometimes in sympathy for individual distress among former teach- 
ers who, having lost employment, are without sources of support, sometimes with 
teachers who have the prudence to look forward to their own old age, sometimes in 
local or state pride, and sometimes in the discovery that pension provisions in force 
are inadequate. Usually the few individuals who are concerned with the effort from 
its inception, become its sponsors. These may enlist the interest and services of other 
persons, some teachers, some public-spirited citizens, and in time a group nucleates 
about a common purpose. The movement perhaps gains impetus from the state teach- 
ers association, and before long obtains its official support. At this stage it often seems 
as if the next step should be legislation. This, however, is not advisable, nor, if the 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 141 
legislating body is adequately informed, should it be possible. The amount of harm 
that has been inflicted upon the cause of teachers retirement by the hasty enactment 
of unsound measures is really incalculable. 
The state is fortunate in which at this juncture the state teachers association 
constitutes a committee to study the whole retirement situation and appropriates a 
modest sum for the preliminary expenses of the investigation. If the committee con- 
sists of men and women accustomed to such research as this public service involves, 
the results will in the long run be valuable. 
The first duty of the committee is to become as familiar as possible with the whole 
problem of retirement. A successful chairman may even organize the members into 
a study-group, assigning to each a particular phase of the subject for investigation 
and report. Meetings need not be so frequent as to be burdensome, but they should 
be well organized and definite as to program. At some point in the investigation two 
important preliminary steps must be taken: the interest and good offices of the state 
department of education must be secured; and it must be determined whether or not 
the constitution and laws of the state-permit the establishment of a retirement 
system. In case legal or other provisions stand in the way of its inauguration, the 
only course lies in securing the passage of permissive amendments or legislation, a 
process which usually proves long and difficult. At any rate, it is certain that small 
if any progress toward the framing of a retirement system will be made without close 
study and hard work on some one’s part. From this labor will emerge sooner or later 
a conception of the kind of retirement system best suited to the needs of the political 
unit to be served, and when the main provisions begin to take form, it is time for 
a tentative draft to be undertaken, discussed, reworked, and amended. 
Although the members of the committee may by this time have gained a special 
knowledge of the principles upon which sound retirement rests, they will profit if 
they now submit their amended draft to one of the two technical advisers who should 
invariably be consulted in such cases, the pension expert. It is the function of the 
pension expert to examine the social, economic, and professional aspects of the plan, 
and to report concerning its possible bearings upon all of these points. After his 
report has been acted upon, the committee will have before it two possible courses: 
it may report progress to the association and request information whether the money 
for the actuarial study is to be advanced by the association; or it may recommend 
that the plan be considered by the legislative body that is to pass the enactment. In 
the second case, it should be understood that the expenses of the actuarial investi- 
gation are to be borne by the citizens through legislative appropriation. 
Usually it will be possible to obtain from the pension expert, the state insurance 
department, or some other sources, the names of responsible and competent actua- 
ries who will undertake the necessary computations on fair terms. But the least ex- 
pensive actuarial advice is not always the most economical. A conclusive test of 
competence in an actuary is the work he has already done and the quality and char-
-P-A-G-E-152
  142 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
acter of the retirement systems with which he is or has been connected. In selecting the 
actuary-his duties and functions should be borne clearly in mind. An actuary makes 
the “calculations as to the probabilities of human life on which the practice of life 
insurance and the value of reversionary interests, deferred annuities, etc., are based”; 
by the use of suitable tables of mortality grounded upon past experience and applica- 
ble to the particular professional group concerned, he determines the costs of the pro- 
posed system; and he elaborates rates of mortality and of withdrawal, and estimates 
the sums necessary to meet the accrued liabilities. In all of these computations and 
in the use of their results, the actuary must be governed by a thorough realization of 
the limitations imposed upon his calculations by the variations of economic factors. 
For example, he will know that calculations of average salaries over a future period of 
years are never dependable, and that rates of withdrawal, which in teachers retire- 
ment systems depend much upon marriage, are dangerous items upon which to count 
in predicting costs. Thus the competent and trustworthy actuary recognizes the limi- 
tations of his profession, and this very fact renders his services of the highest value. 
The technical experts must codperate one with the other and with the members of the 
committee, if the whole project is to succeed. 
The actuarial calculations depend for their effectiveness upon securing from each 
teacher to be included in the system full and accurate information concerning age, 
sex, color, training, and educational experience. The cards upon which these data are 
gathered must be carefully devised with a view not only to making the meaning of 
the entries unmistakable, but also to rendering the facts easily accessible. The blank 
cards may well be distributed and when filled out collected by the state department 
of education or under its auspices ; official recognition of the study is important. It 
must be remembered that actuarial material, to have value, must be complete, or 
practically complete. When all teachers have reported, the cards may be turned over to 
the actuary for study. : 
At this stage of progress, and even before, the state teachers association should 
undertake to inform as fully and as exactly as possible all of the teachers of the 
state concerning its activities. Perhaps even more important is the task of informing 
the citizens, who as taxpayers are directly concerned with the uses to which public 
moneys are put, and the legislators who, as the servants and representatives of the 
citizens, must enact the laws necessary to effectuate their will. Once intelligent citi- 
zens and statesmanlike legislators are brought to understand the advantages to pub- 
lic education and the general good inherent in a sound teachers retirement system, 
the enactment of the necessary measures speedily follows. 'The bill which embodies 
the provisions of the plan should be couched in simple and unmistakable language, 
and it should be drawn by some one, preferably a legislator, who is thoroughly fa- 
miliar with the laws of the state governing education, banks, and fiduciaries, and 
any retirement system that may exist or have existed, either local or state-wide. 
From all that has been said, it will readily be seen that securing sound provisions
-P-A-G-E-153
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 143 
for the retirement of public school teachers in any state is not an easy process, nor is 
it a task to be undertaken hastily or lightly. Not infrequently it isa matter of years, 
not of months. But although the duties it entails may be arduous, it is worth all the 
effort which it involves, as many states have already discovered to their advantage. 
Disability in Teachers Retirement Systems 
At the second meeting of the National Council of Teachers Retirement Systems, 
held on February 25, 1925, at Cincinnati, Mr. Donald Du Shane, of the Indiana 
Teachers Retirement Board, discussed “The Administration of Teachers Disability 
Benefits.” After pointing out that provisions for disability retirement of teachers 
vary greatly from state to state, and noting that the aggregate of experience in the 
field is as yet small, Mr. Du Shane emphasized again the important principle that 
“The justification for expenditure of public money for disability benefits for teachers 
must be the improvement of public service and not the relieving of individuals from 
hardship or financial distress. Benefits to individuals are incidentals or secondary ob- 
jectives of any rightly constituted plan of disability relief.” He inclines “to favor an 
equal payment to beneficiaries because of the resultant feeling of justice and fair play 
among the active teachers, and because of the ease of administration of such a plan.” 
“The disability rate of any system,” Mr. Du Shane proceeds, “is determined pri- 
marily by the provisions of the law, and secondarily, by the efficiency of the board 
in dealing with disability applicants and annuitants. Any shift in the annual disa- 
bility rate or total disability rate of the system should be carefully investigated. It 
would be interesting to show the disability rates of various state systems. Indiana’s 
present rate is approximately two per thousand annually with a probable total load 
of between twenty and twenty-five per thousand members when the system has be- 
come mature. This rate is probably higher than most states because Indiana gives 
benefits for temporary disability lasting more than one half a school term.” He finds 
that “the cost of disability may be somewhat lowered by establishing a procedure 
which will protect against fraud and mistakes in granting benefits.” Among the mea- 
sures which he believes would tend to prevent the unjustifiable granting of disability 
benefits he lists initial and periodic reports from physicians of the board and of the 
teacher, confidential reports from agencies ordinarily used by insurance companies 
in investigating applicants for disability retirement, certificates of membership and 
of service from the auditor or accountant of the board, a statement from the employ- 
ing official concerning disability from the point of view of the school administrator, 
and a rule to the effect that disability should be preceded “by the withdrawal of the 
applicant from active teaching for a reasonable period before the application could 
be considered by the board. This device will meet with theoretical objections but it 
is being used with success in Indiana, and possibly other states.” 
The Council constituted a committee to study the legal steps necessary to provide 
for reciprocal relations between various state teachers retirement funds.

Teachers Retirement in the Several States 
The situation the country over has been little altered during the past year by legis- 
lation affecting retirement of teachers in the public schools. 
In California the controversy over the condition of the Public School Teachers 
Retirement Salary Fund has continued. Governor Friend W. Richardson stated in 
a special message to the legislature his substantial agreement with the conclusions 
of the actuary, Mr. S. Gundelfinger, who had valued the fund, that it is, “from an 
actuarial standpoint insolvent to the extent of more than thirty million dollars.” 
In January the moneys in hand amounted to about $2,300,000, and the liabilities 
to some $32,800,000. Partisans of the system still insist that the fund is solvent 
since it can meet the current cost of pensions by cash disbursement, and that on 
account of withdrawals from teaching the retirement situation in California differs 
from that in other states. Such attempts to number defects among the virtues may 
well make the judicious grieve. The fact that a joint committee of the California 
Teachers Association and City and County Superintendents stated in March that it 
would approve an unbiased investigation by a competent actuary and that it would 
oppose precipitate legislation, may show the way to progress through the maze of 
amateur pension theory and professional politics that has beset the fund. In San 
Francisco retired city teachers are to receive, besides the benefits afforded by the 
state teachers retirement system, the income from the Virginia Scatena Memorial 
Fund for San Francisco School Teachers, amounting to twenty-five thousand dol- 
lars, given in January by Mr. A. P. Giannini. Thus pensions are to be increased by 
private benevolence. 
Some of the other states have attempted or effected changes in their teacher re- 
tirement laws. The Connecticut State Retirement Law was amended to increase the 
minimum allowance from $300 to $350 for teachers retired now or in the future, 
after September, 1917; to raise the minimum allowance from $300 to $500 for teach- 
ers who qualified for retirement and ceased to teach before that date; and to alter 
the qualifications for retirement for those who ceased to teach before 1917 from the 
age of sixty-five years with forty years of service, of which twenty-five were in the 
state, by striking out the age retirement altogether and basing their retirement upon 
thirty-five years of service in the State of Connecticut. A bill with provisions for 
annual legislative appropriations of $15,000, which did not become law, was intro- 
duced into the Florida legislature to pay a flat pension of $360 a year to teachers 
who have taught for three hundred months, or about thirty-seven years, in the state. 
In Idaho a proposal for an essentially unsound system was defeated. The Maryland 
Retired Teachers List will not be increased from two hundred to two hundred and 
thirty-two names because, as Mr. Albert S. Cook, State Superintendent of Public

a bill to retire teachers on allowances equal to one-half the average annual salary 
during the last five instead of the last ten years of service became a state law. The 
post-dating of applications for retirement to fall within this provision, the bearing 
of sabbatical leaves of absence on retirement, and “death-bed retirements” have all 
been brought forcibly to the attention of the New York City Retirement Board. 
In Pennsylvania the legislature extended retirement privileges to former classroom 
teachers sixty-two years of age or over with twenty years of service before July 1, 
1919, and to those with fifteen years of |service who, having withdrawn because of 
disability before that date, are still unable to teach, and to county superintendents 
by including them in the provisions of the retirement law. The limit of $2000 on 
retiring annuities was removed. War service is to be counted toward retirement and 
certain problems connected with temporary withdrawal from teaching for more than 
five years have been adjusted by legislative acts, 
Finally, the retirement system of the Philippine Islands, discussed in the Eigh- 
teenth Annual Report of this Foundation, has been studied by a commission that 
has been investigating public education in the islands. 
Massacuuserts Pension Commission: PartiaL Rerorr 
In thoroughness, clearness, and foresight the Partial Report of the Commission 
on Pensions, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 1923-25, presented as Senate Docu- 
ment 340 in February, 1925, deserves to rank with the best American studies of a 
similar nature in recent years. The first Massachusetts pension law for public em- 
ployees, which established pensions for certain members of the Boston police force, 
was enacted in 1878. Two years later a pension law for Boston firemen was passed. 
In 1885 came the first law relating to pensions for judges. Since that time pensions 
and retiring allowances have been provided for laborers, state and county employees, 
teachers, court officers, and other public servants. These enactments have been studied 
by various state commissions; for example, in 1907-10 by the Commission on Old- 
Age Pensions, Annuities, and Insurance, by the Commission on Pensions of 1913-14, 
and by a Joint Special Committee of 1920-21. When, therefore, the Commission of 
1923-24 began its work, it had to consider not only a large body of legislation but 
also the careful and voluminous studies of the various commissions that had pre- 
ceded it. 
To the Commission on Pensions, established by legislative act in the spring of 
1923, Governor Channing H. Cox appointed Mr. Frank H. Hardison, of Wellesley 
Hills, Mrs. William G. Dwight, of Holyoke, Mr. Charles J. Mahoney, of Boston, Mr. 
Royal Robbins, of Brookline, and Mr. Allen A. Young, of Harvard University. At 
the second meeting, held September 27, 1923, the Commission named Mr. Edmund 8.

  146 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
Cogswell, former secretary of the Massachusetts Teachers Retirement System, as Sec- 
retary and Actuary. 
Among the duties of the Commission, as prescribed in the enactments of 1923, 
may be enumerated the consideration of the entire problem of pensions, retiring 
allowances, and payments in the nature of pensions, whether to officers or employees 
retiring from the public service or to persons in private life; the study of the whole 
problem of old-age pensions; the consideration of taxation to finance any system of 
pensions that the Commission might recommend; the investigation of the workings 
of the present system of retirements for public employees; and various estimates of 
costs. These duties, except those pertaining to old-age pensions, were discharged in 
the Partial Report. Owing to the fact that the problem of old-age pensions is one 
of the most important ever referred to any Massachusetts pension enquiry, the Com- 
mission was forced to postpone recommendation upon the subject. 
The inclusiveness of the act creating the Commission left that body particularly 
free to shape its own methods of study and investigation. The Commission not only 
maintained offices in the State House but held public hearings in Boston and various 
other parts of the state, some general, some designed for consideration of specific 
phases of the investigation. When in 1924 the General Court of Massachusetts di- 
rected the Commission to undertake, in addition to its other duties, the investiga- 
tion of retiring allowances for certain former public school teachers retired before 
the adoption of the Teachers Retirement Act in 1914, and to consider pensions for 
war veterans in the public service, the field of investigation was materially widened. 
The Commission decided that the best method of securing data affecting old-age 
pensions and those teachers who had retired before 1914 was by separate study. Ac- 
cordingly, through public hearings and questionnaires, the cases of the fifty-five 
teachers living in 1924 who had retired before attaining age 60 and who were not 
in receipt of pensions from cities and towns were investigated with unusual care. In 
order to obtain definite information about the condition of the 225,000 residents of 
Massachusetts sixty-five years of age and over, the Commission interviewed through 
field agents over 21,000 aged persons, or nearly ten per cent of the persons compris- 
ing this age group. Interviews held in every county except Nantucket, and covering 
ten cities and twenty-three towns, yielded information representative of the entire 
aged population of the state. In addition card schedules were secured for about four 
thousand inmates of almshouses, four thousand persons aided by public outdoor re- 
lief, three thousand residents of private benevolent homes for the aged, and twenty- 
five hundred persons aided in other ways by private organized charity. The methods 
of the Commission have resulted in one of the most thorough surveys ever attempted 
in this or any other country. 
Moreover, the problems of studying and digesting the present Massachusetts pen- 
sion laws proved of no small difficulty. The thirty-nine retirement systems now in 
operation in Massachusetts embrace not only employees of the commonwealth, coun-  
-P-A-G-E-157
ee er rn ee tT ae 
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 147 
ties, the cities of Boston and Worcester, and various fire and water districts, but also 
the public school teachers of the state, officers and employees of prisons, policemen, 
and judges of the district, land, superior, and supreme courts. This enumeration offers 
some basis for estimating the magnitude of the Commission’s task. 
The principal conclusions and recommendations of the Commission, as set forth 
in the Partial Report, are concerned with judges pensions, pensions for veterans, the 
status of teachers who retired before July 1, 1914, and the creation of a uniform re- 
tirement system for all public employees in the commonwealth. Of these four fields of 
study the first three may be dismissedsomewhat summarily. In brief, then, with respect 
to judges pensions the Commission recommended that all judges of district courts, 
as well as of the municipal court of Boston, be permitted to join a proposed uniform 
retirement system. Furthermore, it recommended, Mr. Mahoney dissenting, that jus- 
tices of the supreme, judicial, and superior courts, and judges of the land court, or 
of probate and insolvency, who had reached the age of seventy be permitted to re- 
tire from active service at half pay, subject, however, to call for special duty. The same 
provision was urged for judges or justices retiring at not less than sixty years of age 
because of disability. 
As regards war veterans, who are now given preferment in obtaining employment 
in the public service, the Commission recommended that the present policy of not 
discriminating in their favor in respect to pensions be continued. Their exemption 
from the operation of contributory retirement systems was not approved. The Com- 
mission recommended that the laws establishing non-contributory pensions for vet- 
erans of the Spanish War and World War in public service be repealed. 
The Commission was unable to recommend that pensions be granted to teachers 
who retired before the present Teachers Retirement System went into effect. After 
noting that the teachers retirement system was established in the interests of the pub- 
lic service, not in the interests of individual employees, and that making pension 
legislation retroactive would present similar appearances of discrimination no matter 
what date were fixed upon as a terminus, the Commission stated that it was “aware 
of no sound reason why retired teachers should be granted privileges that would con- 
stitute, in effect, discrimination against other public employees who retired before 
retiring allowances were established in the branches of the public service in which 
they were employed.” 
The most far-reaching recommendation of the Commission concerns the inaugura- 
tion of a contributory retirement system for all public employees in the common- 
wealth, to include present and future members of the contributory systems. In gen- 
eral the recommendation follows the principles of the Boston and Worcester retire- 
ment acts in that it does not require membership for present policemen, firemen, and 
others, if they are covered by laws providing non-contributory pensions. The man- 
agement of the system is to be vested in a state board of three members, of whom 
one is chosen from among the employees. The board is to prescribe mortality tables 
   
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
and rates of interest. The treasurer of the commonwealth and treasurers of counties, 
cities, and towns are to deduct contributions of five per cent from the salaries of 
members of the system up to $2500 a year. Except in the case of teachers, each 
employing city or town will maintain the custody of the deductions from salaries. 
Most of the provisions of the present Massachusetts Teachers Retirement System are 
to remain intact. Funds are to be invested in such securities, except personal securi- 
ties, as are allowed to savings banks, with four per cent compound interest guaran- 
teed by the commonwealth. Retirement for age, permitted at age 60, is compulsory 
at age 70. “The accumulated deductions of a member are used to purchase an an- 
nuity at the time of retirement.” The employer is to pay pensions equal to annuities, 
and if the member has service prior to the establishment of the system, an additional 
pension based on the prior service; but no pension is to exceed the actuarial equiva- 
lent to a payment of $600 at age 60 or one-third salary for a new member or one- 
half salary for a member with prior service. The maximum is $900 per year at age 
70. Provision is made for voluntary additional contributions from employees who 
desire to increase their annuities. As in the case of certain European pension systems, 
disability permits retirement in both ordinary and extraordinary cases. “A member 
who is retired on account of ordinary disability shall receive an annuity which shall 
be the actuarial equivalent of his accumulated deductions, and a pension which shall 
be equal to eighty per cent of the pension he would have received if he retired at the 
age of sixty with the same service and salary.” In the case of extraordinary disability 
incurred during the performance of duty, the member is to be entitled to an annuity 
based upon his own contributions, and in addition a pension which, together with 
the annuity and pension, will be equal to three-fourths of the annual compensation 
received by him during the year immediately preceding the date of an accident. Em- 
ployees who leave the service are entitled to have their contributions refunded to 
them with interest. In case of death, if a member has not designated a beneficiary, 
contributions and interest are paid to his legal representative. The usual optional 
retirement benefits are permitted. “Provision is made to prevent the rapid accumu- 
lation of deferred liabilities by providing that each year the employer shall set aside 
in the pension fund the present value of all pension payments of persons who are re- 
tired during the year.” The proposed retirement act is somewhat more liberal than 
the Massachusetts Teachers Retirement Law, and the annual pensions under its pro- 
visions during the first few years for teachers and state employees would be some ten 
to fifteen per cent greater than at present. The chief argument for the proposed law, 
as stated by the Commission, is that “the aggregate expense of pensions eventually 
for systems now in operation will be no greater than under present laws and pensions 
will be provided on a uniform basis.” 
Certain provisions in the system as proposed call for special comment. In effect the 
Commission turns from the present practice of the Massachusetts Teachers Retire-
-P-A-G-E-159
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 149 
ment System toward that of Connecticut when it states its belief that each year should 
assume its own retirement burdens and that “whenever an employee is placed on the 
retirement list, the state place in the pension fund an amount equal to the present 
value of his pension, thus providing a fund at that time sufficient actuarially to meet 
the payments of pensions to be made in his behalf.” “'The Boston and Worcester sys- 
tems do not shift this liability, but provide that the accruing liability shall be met 
practically concurrently by increase in the reserve sufficient to meet the liability. This 
is the actuarial method and is ideally correct.” Both the Boston and the Worcester 
systems are free from the fallacy of the final average salary. It is to be noted that the 
recommendations of the Commission with respect to age allowances do not depend 
upon this fallacy, except that no pension is to exceed one-third of the average annual 
compensation during the five years immediately preceding retirement, and even here 
an actuarial equivalent in dollars provides an added safeguard. 
The provision that teachers, judges, firemen, policemen, janitors, and other public 
employees shall be grouped together in one retirement system is somewhat unusual. 
The success or failure of a system so constituted must depend upon the quality of the 
risks which it includes. A “ good” risk for life insurance implies a low death rate at 
all ages, but such a risk may be regarded as unsafe for a retirement system. For occu- 
pations in which risks are “ bad” before age 60 death benefits should not be large. In 
such a group must be included firemen, policemen, warders and other employees of 
prisons, janitors of public buildings, and others of like employment. All of these occu- 
pational risks are “good,” however, after age 60; that is, firemen, policemen, warders, 
or janitors who have survived the hazards of employment up to the time of their re- 
tirement have a long expectation of life. On the other hand, teachers, supervisors, su- 
perintendents of schools, judgesand justices, court officers, and laborers, unless exposed. 
to the hazards of accident, are “ good” insurance risks at all ages. The effect upon the 
mortality rate in a retirement system which includes in its membership such varying 
occupations cannot be forecast, especially since the risks are from the compulsory 
nature of the plan essentially non-selected. It is possible that the hazards of occu- 
pation for firemen, policemen, and other public servants before the age of sixty may 
operate to balance and correct the eventualities inherent in the longer expectation 
of life which teachers enjoy. If the recommendation of the Commission is finally 
adopted and the uniform plan is put in operation, it is not unlikely that the experi- 
ence of the thirty-nine retirement systems, especially the Boston Retirement System, 
which uses separate tables for male teachers, female teachers, policemen, firemen, 
laborers, clerks, and others, may provide the basis for the four or more tables that 
the Commission is said to contemplate for the different classes of employees. 
The Massachusetts legislature, having received the Partial Report of the Commis- 
sion, and acting on the recommendation of its Committee on Social Welfare, voted 
on April 8 to permit the whole matter to run over into its next session. The recom-
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
mendations of the Commission concerning the retirement of judges, after a hearing 
before the Committee on Joint Judiciary, had been rejected some time previously. 
But although the retirement situation in Massachusetts remains for the present as it 
was, the Partial Report of the Commission is among the first in the United States to 
recommend a uniform retirement system for all public employees of a state. In this 
the Commission follows somewhat the theory underlying the retirement of public offi- 
cials in France and the Netherlands, discussed in other pages of this annual report, 
and the Proposed Standard Plan of the Illinois Pension Laws Commission of 1918-19. 
TracHers Retirement IN Oruer Countries 
France 
The fundamental difference in theory underlying teachers retirement in France and 
in the United States is to be found in the idea that, whereas in the United States the 
component state of the Union is the political subdivision held by common consent 
under the Constitution to be responsible for education and therefore for teachers re- 
tirement within its borders, in France education and, therefore, teachers retirement 
are a function of the Republic. For this reason French teachers are regarded as ser- 
vants of the government, and a pension law which applies to certain judges, postal 
employees, clerks in government bureaus, and all other civil employees applies also 
to teachers in universities, lycées, and colléges. To all these classes of government 
functionaries, as well as to members of the military and naval forces, the new French 
pension law of April 14, 1924, applies. 
The whole history of teachers pensions in France is almost inconceivably compli- 
cated by the Great War and its aftermath of reconstruction, reparations, the national 
budget, the declining birth rate, rehabilitation of veterans, the care of their widows 
and orphans, the value of the franc, the cost of living, taxation, and a thousand other 
related matters which swarm like desert flies about a wounded traveler. It avails little 
to note that in, say, 1914, French teachers fifty-five years of age, with twenty-five 
years of service, were retired upon one-half of the average of the six highest yearly 
salaries and one-fiftieth of the average for each year after twenty-five years of service 
up to a maximum of three-fourths of the average salary, and that active teachers con- 
tributed five per cent of their salaries with additions upon increases in compensation, 
while the government appropriated its share of the expense for their pensions out of 
current funds. To compare these provisions with those of the law of April 14, 1924, 
and to attempt to discover and weigh the changes in the system during the past ten 
years would involve examination of most of the eddies in the current of French life 
and public opinion during that period. 
In seeking to estimate the value of a retirement law on the basis of the protection 
which it will afford to the individual, the French teacher differs from the American 
perhaps only in degree, but whereas the Great War passed rather lightly over pub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 151 
lic school teachers in the United States, it decimated the ranks of teachers in France. 
When to a conception of the troubled economic and social condition of that coun- 
try is added an understanding of the fact that the last three years have seen a very 
far-reaching change in some of the ideals of French education, it will perhaps be 
recognized that the lot of the proféesseur has been not only complicated but exceed- 
ingly heavy. French intellectuals have never been known as “chercheurs de dots,” and 
teachers have as a rule married young women of their own social status. Although 
salaries in some portions of the French educational system have increased about four 
hundred per cent since the War, they are not yet of a sufficient size to permit teach- 
ers to save much against the exigencies of old age. 
The law of April 14, 1924, and the instruction of the Minister of Finance pub- 
lished September 2, 1924, to effectuate it, are too detailed for full discussion. It will 
perhaps be sufficient to note some of the more general of their provisions, and in pass- 
ing to contrast a few of them with the content of some of the previous regulations. 
The age pension fixed by the new law is calculated upon the basis of three-fifths 
of the average compensation, including salary and other items, received during the 
last three years of service, with a minimum of 4000 francs, provided the average 
compensation or pay does not exceed 8000 francs. Where the average salary exceeds 
8000 francs, the pension is half the salary. The maximum pension is three-quarters 
of the average salary, with a maximum of 18,000 francs. Pensions are supplemented 
by certain other benefits, among which may be mentioned one-fiftieth of the aver- 
age compensation for each year of active teaching or of service with the colors, ten 
per cent additional for each teacher who has supported three children until they are 
sixteen years of age, and a small provision for their support if they have not reached 
that age at the time of the pensioner’s retirement, with corresponding grants for 
children in excess of three. The absolute right to full pension benefits is acquired at 
sixty years of age on the completion of thirty years’ service, although retirement may 
take place after age fifty-five with twenty-five years of service. The earlier retirement 
reduces the pension to about half of the final salary. 
The age of eighteen years is set as the beginning of service, and supernumerary ser- 
vice and periods of study for qualification as a teacher may be counted as active ser- 
vice. For example, a maximum of three years may be counted when spent in study 
at an école normale or in preparation for the teacher’s license. In reckoning years of 
service, employment in a governmental capacity outside of Europe is counted as 
double time. The age for compulsory retirement is to be fixed by the Department 
of Education, as in the case of other government departments for their employees. 
A retirement application must be filed six months in advance of the date upon which 
it is to be effective. 
Although the provisions for early retirement will care for many of the caseswhich 
among teachers are usually regarded as involving disability, the law makes it pos- 
sible for any civil servant to retire at any time for exceptional disability contracted 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
in the public interest, in saving life, or in accidents connected with his calling. A 
board consisting of one physician, three agents designated by the Minister of 
Finance, and two colleagues of the employee will pass upon such cases. This pension 
may range from a minimum of 1500 francs to three-quarters of the final salary. Com- 
pared with the number of railway and other governmental employees who will ben- 
efit from this provision, the number of teachers will probably be small. 
The widow of a pensioner retired for age or disability will receive an allowance 
equal to one-half of the husband’s pension, provided that marriage took place before 
retirement for disability or two years before retirement for age. Each surviving child 
of a deceased pensioner will receive until the age of twenty-one years a temporary 
allowance equal to one-tenth of the father’s pension. If the widow remarries, she may, 
at the expiration of the year which follows the new marriage, resign her pension and 
receive instead a round sum equivalent to three annual pension payments, the pension 
of the deceased pensioner being thereupon transferred to the surviving minor children, 
if any, until they reach the age of twenty-one years. 
All pensions are non-assignable and non-attachable, except in case of debt to the 
state and except that they may be suspended for a variety of causes, including loss 
of citizenship, and, once granted under the present law, they are irrevocable. The 
rates for future pensions may, however, be altered according to specified conditions. 
There are no withdrawal or death benefits as such. 
To provide the funds for the payment of teachers pensions, each teacher contrib- 
utes six per cent of his salary from the date of appointment. Under the previous 
laws the government withheld the first month’s salary and thereafter deducted five 
per cent of each year’s salary. The effect of the present arrangement is therefore to 
increase the burden of contributions upon the older professors, but to lighten appre- 
ciably the financial load of the beginning teacher. The government’s contribution is 
written into the annual national budget and paid from the treasury. In this way the 
accrued liabilities over and above such sums as have been provided under previous 
laws constitute a direct charge against revenue. A board of twenty-four persons, of 
whom eight are elected by the civil servants, including the teachers, will administer 
the fund, which is to begin operations on January 1, 1928. 
The law of April 14, 1924, contains a provision which represents an attempt to 
equalize the amounts of pensions already in force and to equate them to the new 
rates and the present cost of living in France. 
Although the new law has been opposed in some quarters, and although many of 
its provisions have been subject to much adverse criticism, it is becoming pretty 
generally recognized that it embodies at least an attempt to solve the whole question 
of teachers pensions as well as pensions for all governmental and civil employees in 
the Republic. What the cost to the government and the country will be over a period 
of years still remains to be adequately demonstrated.

  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 153 
Teachers Retirement and Practical Politics in England 
When, in the spring of 1925, Lord Eustace Percy, as President of the Board of 
Education, introduced in Parliament the Teachers Superannuation Bill, he presum- 
ably brought forward the best proposals of which the new government was capable. 
The history of teachers retirement in England up to and including the Report of 
Lord Emmott’s Committee was reviewed in the Nineteenth Annual Report of this 
Foundation, and the difficulties that faced the Board of Education were there out- 
lined. Despite all obstacles, it is surprising that so unsound a bill should have been 
brought forth in the face of the illuminating Emmott Report and the conclusions 
that are inescapable from past experience not only in England but in other parts of 
the world. American teachers who are interested in the problem of securing retire- 
ment legislation will observe with interest the conflict and compromise between the 
facts and principles of sound teachers retirement on the one hand, and the demands 
of practical politics on the other. 
The provisions of the bill embody some of the recommendations of the Emmott 
Report. For example, the benefits of the Act of 1918 remain unaltered except for 
the addition of a supplementary death benefit in case of long contributory service. 
No devaluation of back service is proposed. Teachers are to contribute at the yearly 
rate of five per cent of salary; after 1928 their employers are to duplicate this con- 
tribution. For Local Education Authorities receiving grants from the government 
this duplicate contribution will represent a payment of two and one-half per cent 
from the employing authority and the same percentage from the Treasury. The state 
is to bear the cost of administration and of septennial actuarial enquiries which will 
be reported to Parliament. Service as inspector and organizer is pensionable. Certain 
other provisions are designed to assist migration of teachers. Some of the features 
of the Acts of 1918 and 1922 are to be continued without change. The refund of 
contributions with interest in case of withdrawal, “recognized” and “qualifying” 
service, the former retirement age of sixty years with thirty years service, and the 
lack of a contractual right to pensions all remain. Even from this brief summary it 
is apparent that the bill presents a compromise between the pressing conditions that 
exist in the teaching profession in England and soundness of principle. 
This compromise becomes the clearer when two provisions of the bill are examined 
more closely, In the first place, no statutory advisory council is provided, although 
the President of the Board of Education has indicated his intention of naming such 
a body in case the bill is passed, and the teachers have therefore no guarantee of repre- 
sentation on the administrative board of the system. Secondly, all retirement benefits 
are to be based on average salary, which by definition is final average salary of the 
last five years of service. This provision is lifted bodily from the Act of 1918 in the 
face of a Parliamentary memorandum: Inasmuch as the benefits “depend upon the 
average salary of the teacher for the last five years of his service, it is impossible to
-P-A-G-E-164
154 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
calculate with certainty the sums which may fall due for payment over a series of 
years in the future, nor is it possible to foretell how many teachers may in the future 
be taken into employment and in due course qualify for pension.” That the contin- 
uation of such an unsound provision should be contemplated is disappointing, but 
that the teachers of England should as a body be so little concerned with its impli- 
cations is not less than astounding. 
Two other provisions are if possible even more prejudicial to the best interests of 
both teachers and the state. The first concerns the funds of the system. As regards 
the employer’s contributions it is not proposed to set them aside “to form a separate 
fund, but to keep an account of all the contributions and of all benefits, distinguish- 
ing the payments according as they relate to service rendered before or after con- 
tributions began to be paid.” The proposal therefore is, that while the teachers are 
to pay their contributions of five per cent of salary into the fund concurrently with 
their service, the contributions of the employer are not to be paid in; instead, only 
an account is to be kept of them. As Lord Eustace Percy stated in the House of Com- 
mons at the second reading of the bill, “whereas under Lord Emmott’s fund, it 
would have been the fund that was responsible for finding the benefits, and not the 
Treasury, under our proposal the Treasury is solely responsible for finding the cash 
to pay the benefits. . . . I think Lord Emmott has called this act a bogus fund. It 
does not pretend to be a fund, but it does pretend to be, and it is, a valid account 
of liability as between the Treasury and the contributors. The account will continue 
to show a favourable balance for at least as long as, if not longer, than a fund would 
show a balance, and so long as that is the case, the Treasury bears the whole extra 
liability.” In short, the President of the Board of Education has devised a means of 
so postponing contributions from the employer that the burden of teachers super- 
annuation will fall not upon the generation to whom service is rendered, nor upon 
the present government, but upon the taxpayers of the future. This, of course, Lord 
Eustace Percy denies. In receiving on March 26, 1925, a deputation from the Na- 
tional Union of Teachers he said: ‘‘Nor does our proposal mean that we are throwing 
on the next generation a burden which should properly be borne by the present 
generation. The burden of taxation and expenditure must be considered as a whole, 
and clearly the burden on the next generation is lightened just as much by the allo- 
cation of money to general purposes, such as the redemption of war debt, as by the 
creation of separate funds for separate purposes. Indeed, as a general principle of 
finance, the first method is calculated to lighten the burden more rapidly than the 
second. In this matter the interest of the taxpayer coincides with the interest of the 
teacher, and it is by considering the taxpayer’s interest that the teacher will find his 
greatest security.” It is to be hoped that Lord Eustace Percy’s confidence that the 
golden age of taxation lies in the future is not in error. In the present political out- 
look such trust can be described only as naive. One opposing member of the House 
puts the case thus: “This fund is a paper fund. It creates no capital tangible assets.
-P-A-G-E-165
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 155 
The money paid in will be immediately paid out in relief of the Exchequer at this 
state. I can imagine a future Chancellor of the Exchequer — say 30 or 40 years hence 
— declaring ‘This paper fund was introduced by the Government of 1925, because 
of the then existing burdens of War pensions, unemployment, and so forth, and it 
was forecasted then that those burdens would be less now, but the burdens are not 
less, they are more.’ If the burdens turn out to be equal to or more than the present 
burdens then certainly that future Chancellor will have the right to say that the 
prophecy of the right honourable Gentleman has been falsified, and that under such 
conditions the financial arrangements must be changed.” 
With such a Barmecidal financial proposal it is not surprising that the bill makes 
no provision for a contractual right to a retiring allowance. As one economist Mem- 
ber of Parliament said, in any case, the Government cannot bind succeeding Parlia- 
ments, but “in the matter of superannuation they ought to be able to give the benefi- 
ciary a firm guarantee as to what is to happen under a fund whose actuarial basis can 
be properly ascertained and to which we are perfectly sure the contributing elements 
are making such contributions as will safeguard the benefits in every shape and form.” 
American teachers and legislators who are studying problems of retirement and 
pension finance in the light of practical politics will find in the bill little to imitate 
and much to avoid. 
The Retirement of Teachers and Other Civil Servants in the Netherlands* 
The retirement system for Dutch civil servants, created by the Pension Act of 
May 5, 1922, and amended on June 80, 1923, anticipated in principle, and to some 
extent in provisions, the French Pension Law of April 14, 1924. The Dutch system in- 
cludes not only all provincial and municipal employees, but also teachers of all grades 
and even certain categories of private schools. Headmasters of private schools oper- 
ated for profit are, however, excluded, although teachers in such schools may share 
in the benefits of the system. The act does not provide for military pensions. 
The benefits of the plan may be grouped in two main divisions: first, pensions for 
civil servants, including teachers, and secondly, provision for their widows and orphans. 
For civil servants the age of retirement is sixty-five, which may, however, be antici- 
pated by ten years under certain conditions. Disability pensions are also available and 
special provision is made for retirement due to illness contracted in line of duty and 
to abolition of office. For retirement at age 65 oron account of disability at least seven 
years of service are in most cases required. 
A retiring civil servant receives a pension amounting to two per cent of the “aver- 
age pensionable salary” for each year of pensionable service, with a minimum of thirty 
per cent and a maximum of seventy. Average pensionable salary may be the compen- 
sation for the last three years of service, for the last ten years of service, or for the 
whole period of service, according to which basis gives the highest figure. Except for

ministers of state, whose maximum pension is six thousand guilders, no pension ex- 
ceeds four thousand guilders (about $1600) per year. In calculating length of service, 
ecclesiastical and military service may be included, and service in the Dutch colonies 
is reckoned as double time. ; 
Widows of active, as well as of retired, civil servants, unless marriage took place 
after age 65, are eligible to benefits based upon final pensionable salary, the allowance 
being equivalent to fifty per cent of the first two thousand guilders, and forty per cent 
of the remaining, with a maximum of fourteen hundred guilders. Minor orphans or | 
children of a deceased female civil servant may be paid ten per cent of the widow’s 
pension, or as much as twenty per cent if the mother-widow’s pension is not granted. 
Opportunity is provided to increase widows and orphans benefits through supple- 
mentary voluntary contributions from the civil servant to an insurance fund managed 
by the pension board. In such contributions the state assumes no share. 
Contributions, which are receivable from all civil servants holding written employ- 
ment contracts, are based on annual salary rounded off to the nearest guilder. Re- 
sponsibility for collection rests upon the state, provinces, municipalities, water boards, 
and other employing agencies, which are required to pay to the pension fund annually 
on the thirty-first of December, ten per cent of the civil servant’s salary toward his 
own retiring allowance, or five and one-half per cent toward the widows and orphans 
pensions, subject to the following limitations: of the contribution of ten per cent for 
the personal pension not more than three per cent may be collected from the civil ser- 
vant, whereas the contribution of five and one-half per cent toward dependents’ bene- 
fits may be entirely paid by him; that is, no civil servant may be called upon to pay 
more than eight and one-half per cent of his salary for his own and his dependents’ 
pensions. This provision leaves a contribution of seven per cent toward the annuity | 
to be paid by the employing agency. All pensions payable under the act are inalien- 
able, except that they are forfeited upon naturalization in a foreign country, enlist- 
ment in a foreign armed service, or alienation of the pension by the pensioner himself. 
The application of the act and the management of the pension funds are vested in 
a board of three members appointed by the Crown, who are assisted by a permanent 
secretary and a medical adviser, also appointed by the Crown on recommendation of 
the board, together with an official staff. The board is responsible to the Minister 
of Finance. Five commissioners, appointed by the Crown, supervise the management 
of the pension fund, and of these at least three must be civil servants, active or re- 
tired. Associations of civil servants may submit names in nomination of the three com- 
missioners who represent their interest. Expenses of the board are charged to the 
pension funds, and receipts and expenditures of the fund are regulated by budget. The 
law closely specifies the kind of securities permitted for investment, in which for the 
most part the government must be concerned. At the end of every five-year period 
an actuarial survey is to take place. 
The great difference between the present Dutch pension law and those which it is   
 
-P-A-G-E-167
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 157 
intended to supersede is to be found in the fact that, whereas the present enactment 
makes a large proportion of the cost of retirement, and all of the provision for de- 
pendents, charges upon the civil servant, the previous acts for the most part required 
in fact, if not in intent, contributions only from the employing agency. Such a com- 
plete departure from former practice has been the cause of much indignation and 
adverse criticism of the new plan on the part of government employees in the Nether- 
lands. 
Civin ServicE RETIREMENT IN OrHER CounTRIES 
Canadian Civil Service Superannuation Act, 1924 
On July 19, 1924, assent was given to an Act to provide for the Superannuation 
of Civil Servants (14-15 George V, 69) in the Dominion of Canada, and its provi- 
sions went into effect on November 1, 1924. It seems unfortunate that in this legis- 
lation the Canadian Parliament was not guided by the experience and foresight 
which actuated some of the other parts of the British Empire. Although it is true 
that the Act seems to preclude the controversies that have beset some of the funded 
governmental superannuation acts by not funding at all the amounts contributed by 
the employer, it is likely that its operation will be much more costly than would ap- 
pear at first glance. 
The Act provides in effect for a superannuation system to articulate with the 
Civil Service Superannuation and Retirement Act and to supersede the Public Ser- 
vice Retirement Act of 1920 as enacted in 1923, and ultimately the Superannuation 
and Retirement Act itself. In view of the fact that the measure of 1924 seems in- 
tended to become in time the only provision of this sort in Canada, it merits study. 
The new law applies to every civil servant appointed after November 1, 1924, and 
to all others subject to previous acts who may elect to become contributors under it. 
Such persons will contribute by deductions of five per cent of their annual salaries for 
thirty-five years of service, but no more. Benefits, granted by the Governor in Council 
after service of ten years, include an annual superannuation allowance for life with 
retirement optional at age 65, and ‘compulsory under special conditions as late as 
75; a withdrawal allowance consisting of all contributions paid in without interest 
in one lump sum; an allowance to widows until remarriage in the amount of one-half 
of the allowance which the contributor was receiving or would have received if he had 
been superannuated or retired, and allowances to surviving children of each deceased 
contributor up to the age of eighteen, not to exceed $300. Furthermore, gratuities 
are authorized in the form of disability benefits to contributors and death benefits to 
widows of contributors for less than ten years in the amount of one month’s salary for 
each year of service. The Dominion seems again to have committed itself to an old- 
fashioned, unfunded, so-called “straight” pension scheme, slightly modified by lim- 
ited contributions from the employees. 
The high cost of such a scheme may be exemplified by a supposititious but very
-P-A-G-E-168
  158 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
possible case. Suppose a married Canadian enters the civil service at age 30, and re- 
ceives for the first ten years of service a salary of $1500, for fifteen years more $2000, 
and for the last ten years of his service $2500. His contributions of five per cent of 
salary will total $3500. When he retires at age 65, his allowance is computed on the 
basis of one-fiftieth of the average salary received during the last ten service years 
(here $50) multiplied by the number of years of service (here the maximum allowed, 
thirty-five years) or $1750. The ratio of the retiring allowance to salary tends to ex- 
ceed the generally accepted half-pay, and this results in making retirement relatively 
profitable to the beneficiary. A superannuation annuity of $1750 a year is, then, to 
be paid at the rate of $145.83 per month. According to McClintock’s Table of Mor- 
tality Among Annuitants, compound interest at four per cent, the actuarial equiv- 
alent of this allowance at cost for the lifetime of the man alone is over $15,300, if 
his wife, who is assumed to be of the same age, dies during his lifetime. Of this sum, 
the civil servant has contributed not quite twenty-three per cent; the government 
is, from the actuarial point of view, thus liable for nearly $12,000 for the man’s an- 
nuity alone. If, however, the wife of this retired contributor is to receive after his 
death an annual allowance equal to one-half of her husband’s, the actuarial value of 
both annuities will be $18,383, and the contributions of the civil servant will have 
paid only about seventeen per cent of this sum. 
The effect of the new act is to increase the amount of the contributions of civil 
servants from the two per cent required of those appointed before April 1, 1893, 
whose annual salaries exceed $600, and the three and one-half per cent required of 
later appointees of the same salary-group—the percentages are one and one-quarter 
and three per cent respectively for those in the salary-group below $600—to a flat 
five per cent from all new appointees, regardless of salary. It is not unlikely that the 
Act was, in part at least, dictated by a desire to reduce the expenses incidental to 
the two older laws. In 1914, the Canadian Civil Service included some 13,000 per- 
sons. In 1925, it probably numbers at least 15,000. The costs of such a pension law 
as the Civil Service Superannuation Act, 1924, will, however, tend to increase in- 
definitely. 
In view of all these facts, considering the examples of Australia and New South 
Wales, it is to be regretted that Canada did not enact a civil service retirement law 
with more to commend it. The most that can be expected from the new Act is that, 
by increasing the contributions, it will place more of the financial burden upon the 
employees of the Dominion. Even this will mitigate the high cost only temporarily. 
The fundamental defects lie in promising a pension based upon final average salary, 
and in not providing a sound adjustment and apportionment of the costs. A com- 
plete survey by competent actuaries certainly would have pointed the way to a 
sounder law, instead of an Act which runs counter to almost all the principles which 
the study of superannuation and retirement during the past twenty years and more 
has adduced.

South Australia Public Service Superannuation Fund 
The advantages which result from the conservative management of retirement sys- 
tems are nowhere better illustrated than in the development of the South Austra- 
lia Public Service Superannuation Fund. The fund was originally set up in 1902, 
with amendments in 1920 and 1923. A regulation provides for an actuarial investi- 
gation every five years; the results of the fourth investigation were sent to the board 
in September, 1923, and the board commented upon them in its annual report for 
the year ending December 31, 1923, dated March, 1924. 
The accumulations purchasable under the acts and regulations result from deduc- 
tions of eight per cent of members’ salaries. Unlike the South Australian Common- 
wealth Fund and the new Canadian Civil Service Superannuation Fund, no contri- 
butions are received from the government. Two appeals for subsidy from the com- 
monwealth, at least one of which has been sponsored by the South Australian Public 
Service Officers Federation, have been made in the hope that the employees’ contribu- 
tions might be matched, pound for pound, by the government, but thus far financial 
stringency seemingly has not permitted this step. 
The benefits of the system are mainly in keeping with the liberal contributions. 
To withdrawing members all subscriptions are returned, and at the death of a sub- 
scriber the full amount of his contributions is payable to his legal personal representa- 
tive or nominee. Upon the death of a widowed subscriber who has not entered upon 
an annuity and whose children are over eighteen years of age, all subscriptions are paid 
back. Retirement is not compulsory; certain subscribers aged 65 and others aged 
70 may begin the receipt of their annuities even if they remain in the government 
service, although their contributions are discontinued. The rates of annuities for each 
pound of subscription have been much increased for certain widows, from £1 17s. 6d. 
to £3 15s.; male subscribers, from £3 5s. to £3 15s.; female subscribers, newly seg- 
regated in a separate division for accounts, from £3 2s, 6d. to £3 10s. Annual in- 
crements to subscribers’ annuities have been increased from 1s. 6d. and 1s. 9d. to Qs. 
Thus, a civil servant eligible to membership in Division B, as it is called, who joins 
the fund at age 25, with a salary of £250 and pays subscriptions of £20, receives 
at age 70 an annuity of £135 a year under the former regulations, but of £155 under 
the new. His widow and orphans will now receive £75 annually. It is true that the 
rate of subscription, eight per cent of salary, seems rather a heavy burden upon 
individual members, and that contributions are returned upon withdrawal without in- 
terest; yet without capable direction the board would not be able to declare that the 
liabilities involved in all benefits are entirely covered, twenty shillings to the pound, 
by the funds in hand, and that, although the rate of interest for accumulations has 
recently been raised from three and one-half per cent to four per cent, a further in- 
crease may be possible before the next quinquennial valuation. The board goes even 
further in anticipating a possible increase in benefits at the expiration of five years. 
   
-P-A-G-E-170
  160 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
Favorable mortality rates have had much to do with building up the total surplus 
of over £88,900 at three and one-half per cent, or about £120,000 at four per cent, 
in the two divisions of the fund. For the five-year period covered by the valuation, 
the number of deaths expected among all subscribers was 46.3; the actual number 
of deaths was sixty-five. The total number of contributors who entered upon pensions 
during the five years was exceedingly small as compared with expectations, a total 
of thirty-seven out of the 107 expected. “These low rates of retirement,” writes the 
actuary, Mr. D. Carment, F.I.A., of Sydney, “have conduced very largely towards 
the considerable surplus which is now shown to exist, but it must be remembered 
that the Fund has hardly yet survived its infancy, and that its past experience in 
this respect is hardly likely to be continued as the average age of the existing sub- 
scribers increases, and as larger numbers reach the optional age of retirement.” The 
total number of paying subscribers in 1924 was 1552, of whom 96 were women. 
Their annual subscriptions totaled £22,342. During the preceding year withdrawals 
numbered 103, and the membership showed a total net loss of ten. In the five years 
covered by the valuation, the fund had a total of 726 new entrants at a combined 
average age for men of 24.2 years as against 23.7 at the preceding valuation, and for 
women of 23.5 years. In spite of the fact that the cost of increasing the interest rate 
to four per cent will be about £1800 per year, the board believes that the resources 
and the earnings on investments still make the increases of interest rate and bene- 
fits not only possible, but highly desirable. 
Cuurcu RerirEMent Systems 
The Church Pension Fund, Protestant Episcopal Church 
The past fourteen years have seen the development of the Church Pension Fund 
of the Protestant Episcopal Church. After thorough preliminary study, the plan 
upon which the present system is based was presented to the General Convention 
for approval in 1913, and one year later the Fund was chartered by the New York 
State Legislature to be operated under certain provisions of the Insurance Law and 
the supervision of the Superintendent of Insurance. By 1916 all but a few of the 
dioceses had ratified the plan. Accordingly there was then started a campaign to 
raise the five million dollars that had been determined upon as necessary to inaugu- 
rate the system. So successful were the efforts of Bishop William Lawrence of Massa- 
chusetts, President of the Board of Trustees, and Mr. Monell Sayre, later Executive 
Vice-President, that in fourteen months not only was the initial provision of five 
million dollars raised, but much more as well. Eventually the sum reached eight and 
a half millions. 
The Church Pension Fund isorganized upon principles different from those adopted 
by such denominations as the Congregational, Methodist, and Presbyterian. The 
Fund holds that the support of the clergyman in old age and the support of his
-P-A-G-E-171
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 161 
widow are “as much the duty of the laity as it is their duty to support him when 
he is ministering to them.” The plan is therefore contributory, but contributions are 
received only from the parishes. This fact has in some instances resulted in difficul- 
ties in the collecting of contributions, but it appears that, generally speaking, these 
difficulties have been only temporary, and that during seven years of operation every 
parish in the country has entered, and no parish has withdrawn from, the system. The 
plan thus had the effect of raising the salaries of all clergymen of the denomination by 
the amount of the parish’s annual contribution, seven and one-half per cent, although 
the accumulations thus resulting are not the absolute property of the clergymen on 
whose salaries they are calculated. The whole system is contractual in so far as the 
certificates issued are yearly receipts for assessments paid. Contributions are credited 
individually. 
In the main, the aim of the Fund is to give pensions in proportion to salaries, 
except that a poorly paid clergyman receives a larger amount than would result act- 
uarially from the receipts from his successive parishes. Up to the spring of 1925, the 
minimum age allowance available at age 68 for a man ordained before age 36 had 
been $600 a year in all cases. “The technical calculation is one and one-quarter of 
the total average salary multiplied by the number of years of service after March 1, 
1917. If this is greater than $600, the clergyman gets the greater pension.” No pen- 
sion had, however, been paid upon the higher calculation. In April, 1925, having 
received the report of the complete actuarial valuation of the Fund, which takes place 
every seven years, and being assured that a very substantial surplus existed, the Ex- 
ecutive Committee of the Church Pension Fund authorized the officers to devote the 
income from that surplus to crediting the accounts of members with the pension assess- 
ments which would have been paid if the Church Pension Fund had been in operation 
before March 1, 1917, and thus to reduce further the accrued liabilities. To receive 
these credits the members are divided into groups of one hundred, according to dates 
of ordination, and the increased accumulations are to be accorded to the groups in suc- 
cession until the capital sum on which the age allowance is based will produce in each 
instance an annuity of $1200 per year for the clergyman and an annual pension of $600 
per year for the widow. The allowances and pensions may be increased even beyond this. 
Clergymen totally and permanently disabled, who were ordained or received before 
the Fund started, have an annual allowance of $600. Thus far disability pensioners 
number practically one per cent of the canonical roll. When a clergyman pensioned 
for disability reaches age 68, he is transferred to the age allowance. The widow of a 
clergyman who married before retirement receives $300 a year, one-half of what the 
husband would have been entitled to, up to remarriage. Altogether, 471 widows had 
received allowances up to November 1, 1925. Grants are also made for minor orphans. 
In addition, the Fund now pays a death benefit of $1000 to the widow of a clergy- 
man dying in active service, which, placed immediately in her hands, relieves her for 
a time at least of financial anxiety and expedients. This grant, however, is reduced 
   
-P-A-G-E-172
    162 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
proportionately if in the diocese to which the deceased clergyman belonged any parish 
was delinquent in paying its pension assessment during the preceding fiscal year. Here 
as elsewhere in the plan is emphasized the necessity of the absolute codperation that 
alone assures the success of such a pension system, which “can only stand if supported 
practically unanimously by the parishes.” 
Such generous provisions would, of course, be impossible without the very large 
resources that the Fund possesses. At the end of 1924 the Fund had disbursed over 
$1,686,000. A combined total of 1187 individual allowances, both age and disability, 
pensions, and grants were in force. Valuations are made annually by the consulting 
actuary. The total resources of the Church Pension Fund on January 1, 1925, were 
$17,894,579.81, which, considered actuarially, is stated to show a surplus. To the 
Church Pension Fund two other organizations have recently been added: the Fund 
for Aged and Infirm Clergymen and the Widows and Orphans of Clergymen of the 
Diocese of Connecticut and the Clergyman’s Retiring Fund, of the Diocese of Con- 
necticut. At the time of the merger the property of these two combined was valued at 
$200,057. The pension reserve of the Church Pension Fund on January 1, 1925, was 
$12,501,110. : 
Two other considerations should be mentioned. First, the Church Pension Fund 
has taken over the payment of a number of grants from the General Clergy Relief 
Fund and from about twenty diocesan relief funds, including grants from these funds 
to clergymen who had retired before March 1, 1917, when the Church Pension Fund 
commenced operations. Secondly, in addition to the general reserve various other re- 
serves have been created for special purposes and accounts, yet even after the inclu- 
sion of all of these charges, some of which are said to represent moral rather than 
actuarial requisites, there is stated to be a very satisfactory margin between the pos- 
sible obligations and the total resources of the Church Pension Fund. 
In 1922 the trustees formed the Church Life Insurance Corporation, with a com- 
bined capital and surplus of $150,000, to offer life insurance at cost to the clergy 
and lay workers of the Episcopal Church. The Corporation is stated to have prac- 
tically no administrative expense, since it uses the facilities of the Fund. Policies, 
which are non-participating, are free from restriction as to residence, travel, occupa- 
tion, and military service, permit change of beneficiary, but contain no disability 
benefits. Rates are stated to be net, based on the American Experience Table and 
three and a half per cent interest. Annuities and deferred annuities are issued. It is 
therefore possible for a clergyman who desires for his old age the i wd offered by 
a deferred annuity contract to contribute voluntarily the amount necessary to build 
up the accumulations and by this means to supplement his prospective allowance from 
the Church Pension Fund. 
One of the valuable phases of the activity of the Fund since its idluptiteidon has 
been the discussion in its annual reports of various pension and retirement prob- 
lems, besides a full and frank exposition of the questions and — which the
-P-A-G-E-173

trustees and executives of this munificent trust successfully meet year by year. The 
Sixth Annual Report presents an excellent résumé of the steps taken by the Church 
of England to develop a pension system, and an account of the transactions of the 
English Church Assembly in July, 1924, which Mr. Sayre, Executive Vice-President 
of the Church Pension Fund, attended as an unofficial member. 
New Service Pension Plan, Presbyterian Church 
April 1, 1926, is the date set for the inauguration of the New Service Pension Plan 
of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, approved and adopted by 
the General Assembly at Grand Rapids, Michigan, on May 24, 1924. The operation 
of the plan is contingent upon a requisite number of ministers, estimated at four thou- 
sand, becoming members, and upon the raising of a large endowment to care for the 
accrued. liabilities. Ratification of the plan by the bodies constituting the General 
Assembly has proceeded rapidly. Hitherto the retirement of ministers of the Pres- 
byterian Church, as effected under the Board of Ministerial Relief and Sustentation, 
has in a great many cases smacked of charity, and like a majority of similar plans 
has been open to most of the objections commonly raised to such enterprises.’ For- 
tunately, the Board has been aware of these defects— probably, indeed, more aware 
than any one else; and the new system as proposed is designed to eliminate them. 
So widespread has been the attention attracted by the new plan that its provisions 
demand only the briefest summary. It provides. at age 65, after thirty-five years’ ser- 
vice, for pastors, missionaries, teachers in certain theological seminaries, and many 
other ranks and grades of church officers and employees, a pension equal to one and 
a quarter per cent of salary for each year in which contributions to thenew fund have 
been paid, with a minimum pension of $600 and a maximum of $2000. For years in 
which the contributions are not paid the pension is reduced pro rata. The actuarial cal- 
culations imply entry into the system at or before age 30. The contributions required, 
which are sent in quarterly, are ten per cent of current salary, of which seven and a half 
per cent are paid by the employing body and two and a half per cent by the minister 
member. Here the Presbyterian plan differs in principle from the Church Pension Fund 
in dividing the responsibility for provision against superannuation and disability be- 
tween employer and employee, though not in equal proportions. Such a provision is 
in accord with the principles underlying the contracts of the Teachers Retirement 
Plan of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, and the Annuity Fund for 
Congregational Ministers. The amount of pension, which for thirty-five service years 
is thus set at almost forty-five per cent of total salary received, is so conservatively com- 
puted that in most cases it can probably be provided without those “ adjustments” 
which the fallacy of the final average salary almost always implies. 
The scheme of benefits includes ministers pensions at age 65, with a maximum of

teenth Annual Report, pages 164-166.

half the average annual salary or at least $2000, and a minimum of $600, with or 
without retirement ; disability pensions of forty per cent of average annual salary for 
the last five years preceding disability with a minimum of $600, half-pensions to sur- 
viving widows of members with a minimum of $300, and grants of $100 for each minor 
orphan, with widows and orphans allowances so adjusted that their sum shall not 
exceed the pension which the father was receiving or to which he would have been 
entitled. The inclusiveness of the protection and perhaps the use of annual average 
salary as a factor in computing the pensions reduce the ratio of oe retired 
pay to active pay. No contract seems to be contemplated. A member of the new sys- 
tem will probably not receive quite so high a pension as he would if the total con- 
tributions and their accumulations at four per cent compound interest were used to 
purchase at age 65 an annuity with the options of, say, the Teachers Retirement Plan. 
On the other hand, in this plan, as in the Church Pension Fund, there is always the 
possibility of soliciting more money from the churches to make more liberal provision 
for retiring clergymen. The liabilities that have accrued under the former plans are 
to be cared for by the fund of fifteen million dollars which the Presbyterian Church is 
raising for the purpose. 
Three names have been actively associated with the new plan : the Reverend Henry 
B. Master, D.D., General Secretary of the Board of Ministerial Relief and Susten- 
tation; the Honorable Will H. Hays, former Postmaster-General of the Taited States, 
as chairman of the nation-wide Presbyterian Committee on Pensions; and Mr. George 
A. Huggins, actuary, of Philadelphia, consulting actuary to the Annuity Fund for 
Congregational Ministers. The new plan will give the Presbyterian clergy many ad- 
vantages which the old plan failed to afford. 
‘Youne Women’s Curist1an AssoctatioN RETIREMENT Fump 
The results of some four years of study and investigation by a committee represent- 
ing the National Board of the Young Women’s Christian Association of the United 
States are set forth in a pamphlet issued in June, 1925, describing the! Young Wo- 
men’s Christian Association Retirement Fund, incorporated by the New York State 
Legislature on April 12, 1924. The plan as described in the pamphlet embodies some 
of the soundest provisions ever made for retirement in such an organization. Flexible, 
actuarially grounded, simply and clearly stated, it merits the closest study. 
Membership in the plan is optional for all full-time secretaries employed by local 
associations, and each secretary admitted to the privileges of the system is to contrib- 
ute five per cent of her monthly salary, while on her behalf each participating asso- 
ciation contributes six per cent of salary. The total contributions, accumulated at 
four per cent compound interest, are sufficient at present rates to purchase at the age 
of sixty years, when retirement normally takes place, an annuity of approximately 
half the average salary for the entire period of service. But the plan is free from the

fallacy of future salaries or final average salary; the annuity is payable in the amount 
provided by the total accumulated contributions and the secretary’s share in the 
amounts already paid in to care for the accrued liabilities. Although the normal 
period of service is calculated to be thirty years, retirement depends not upon service 
but upon age alone. A retiring secretary may choose one of four modes of settlement: 
she may purchase an annuity from any insurance company, subject to the approval of 
the board of trustees; or she may contract for an annuity payable by the trustees; 
or the joint accumulations may be paid to a trust company under a deed of trust on 
such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon with the board of trustees; or any 
other plan agreed upon jointly by the secretary and the board may be adopted. 
Besides retiring allowances the plan affords benefits in case of disability, with- 
drawal, and death. Retirement for disability, depending upon participation for ten 
years or more in the plan, is made possible by the granting of a retiring allowance 
based upon, first, all contributions and accumulations, and, secondly, an appropriate 
share in the fund donated for accrued liabilities, to which is added, thirdly, if disa- 
bility takes place before twenty-five years of service, a further amount from the gen- 
eral fund contributed by the participating association. Upon withdrawal all contri- 
butions made by the secretary-member are returned with compound interest not to 
exceed four per cent. In addition she receives an annuity, effective at once or in the 
future, “such as can be provided by a sum from the fund established by the contri- 
butions of the association, equal in amount to three per cent of the secretary’s con- 
tributions, with accumulations thereon not to exceed four per cent, compounded an- 
nually, multiplied by the years of her participation in the plan, with a maximum not 
exceeding the amount of her contributions, with accumulations at not to exceed four 
per cent compounded annually.” This provision, designed both to reward long service 
and to conserve the accumulations of the employer, embodies one of the few valid con- 
tributions to the theory and practice of retirement in recent years. Upon the death of 
a participant her beneficiary or estate is to receive all contributions with their accu- 
mulations paid in by the secretary or on her behalf. It may, therefore, be said that 
the benefits of the plan combine liberality and justice. 
The fund has been fortunate in receiving from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller 
Memorial a gift of $1,500,000, a sum that is sufficient to provide for the payment 
of all accrued liabilities, estimated as of January 1, 1920, and that date has therefore 
been set as the terminus of accrual. At the end of the first year of the fund’s opera- 
tion the trustees will allot the credits that this gift affords on the basis of the number 
of secretaries who elect to participate and their records of previous service. Eligibil- 
ity to share in the distribution of the Rockefeller gift is contingent upon having filed 
at the offices of the fund information blanks, which form the basis for the actuarial 
calculations previously to June 15, 1924. 
Because the principles underlying the plan are sound the whole system of allow- 
ances can, and doubtless will, be made contractual. The interests of participants are

safeguarded further by certain administrative provisions. The constitution of the fund 
requires that three of the nine members of the board of trustees shall be partici- 
pating secretaries. Moreover, contributors are to receive an annual statement of 
the condition of their accounts in the fund. Although the Sata value of the 
advantages to be secured at retirement under the four optional modes of settlement 
depends in part upon what table of mortality is employed as a basis for the allow- 
ances issued by the fund, as contrasted with those issued by insurance companies, the 
latitude in provision for old age permitted retiring members is unusually liberal. 
Useful as the services of local associations to their communities have been in the 
past, these services in the future cannot but gain in value from the odhantages that 
this central retirement fund will offer to participating secretaries. So generous and 
so sound a plan of retiring annuities will render unselfish women even more willing 
to devote the best energies of their active lives to a social agency that affords them 
the assurance of a modest competency in their later years. 
Pensions in Inpustry 
Developments of the year in the field of industrial pensions seem to reveal two 
welcome tendencies in the direction of soundness: the first, toward funding pension 
obligations in advance, the second, toward contractual security. The second tendency 
is possible only when the first has been fulfilled. Perhaps the action ot the United. 
States Circuit Court in dismissing for lack of equity the suit filed by the pensioners 
of Morris and Company has served as a warning to both employers and employees, 
although an appeal was taken. More probably the efforts of some of the great in- 
surance companies and of certain organizations of employers have begun to bear 
fruit. Whatever the cause, it is possible to commend at least three newly inaugu- 
rated employees retirement plans as essentially sound — those of the Metropolitan 
Life Insurance Company, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Western Clock Com- 
pany, of La Salle, Illinois, which was framed by the joint action of employees and offi- 
cials of the company. These three plans differ from one another in certain details, but 
all are based upon the annuity contracts of the Metropolitan Life InsuranceCompany. 
It will perhaps suffice to describe the plan of the New York Stock Exchange 
New York Stock Exchange Employees Retirement Plan 
When one of the greatest existing financial agencies, after due consideration and 
study, adopts a retirement plan for its 551 employees, it is to be expected that the 
system will embody soundness, definiteness, contractual security, and simplicity. These 
are precisely the qualities that distinguish the retirement plan of the New York Stock 
Exchange and affiliated companies. These companies are the New York Stock Ex-
-P-A-G-E-177
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 167 
change Building Company, the Stock Clearing Corporation, the New York Quotation 
Company, and the New York Stock Exchange Safe Deposit Company. 
Briefly, the plan, effective July 1, 1925, provides retiring annuities available to all 
employees of these five organizations who have completed one year of service. These 
annuities are entirely independent of the fallacy of the final average salary; they are 
contractually provided, and all accounts are individually kept. The employees affected 
may be considered as belonging to two main groups, those who elect to contribute 
three per cent of their salaries toward annuities, and those who do not. 
Even if an employee with one year’s service does not elect to contribute to the plan, 
the Stock Exchange provides for each year of service during which his salary falls into 
one of certain salary groups, a service annuity beginning at age 65, according to the 
following classification: 
TABLE A 
Weekly Salary Monthly Annuity for 
Each Year of Service 
Class A: $40.00 and under $1.00 
Class B: $40.01 to $60 $1.50 
Class C}: $60.01 to $80 $2.00 
Class D: $80.01 and over $3.00 
For service rendered before the inauguration of the plan, an employee is considered 
as belonging to the salary group in which he stood on July 1, 1925. The liberality of 
such provisions need scarcely be pointed out. To receive the advantages indicated in 
Table A,an employee need not contribute one cent toward his own retiring allowance. 
Thus ata stroke the accrued liability is met by the generosity of the Stock Exchange. 
On the other hand, for an employee who elects to contribute three per cent of his 
salary to the plan, his service annuity from age 65, as purchased by his service in the 
future, will be doubled as follows: 
TABLE B 
Weekly Salary Monthly Annuity as to Monthly Annuity as to 
Service before Service after beginning Deposits beginning Deposits 
Class A: $40.00 and under $1.00 $2.00 
Class B : $40.01 to $60.00 $1.50 $3.00 
Class C: $60.01 to $80.00 $2.00 $4.00 
Class D: $80.01 and over $3.00 $6.00 
On retirement, then, an employee who has contributed to the plan from the time at 
which he became eligible to participate will receive (1) an annuity for life from age 
65, based upon the amount of his own deposits, their accumulations, his sex, and his 
age at entering the system; (2) an annuity purchased by the Exchange based upon 
his salary on July 1, 1925, and years of service rendered before that date; and (3) an 
annuity, also purchased by the Exchange, based upon his salary and years of service 
after July 1, 1925. All of these retirement benefits are secured by individual con- 
tracts between the employee and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company under 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
168 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
the terms of which individual certificates are issued to each employee. Once the Stock 
Exchange has made its annual contribution, its control ceases over the funds cred- 
ited to employees who remain in service. The scales of allowances indicated in the two 
tables are to be realized by the retirement bonds of the Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Company. Thus, Table A represents the purchase by the Stock Taalgh of Group 
Annuity Bonds, while Table B is based upon a combination of Group Annuity Bonds 
and Group Refunding Retirement Bonds. A participating employee of the Exchange 
who approaches the time of retirement will be contractually assured of an annuity of 
the fixed value that his own contributions and those of the company toward Group 
Refunding Retirement Bonds will purchase, in addition to that provided by the 
Group Annuity Bonds, and the resulting annuities will be paid according to indi- 
vidual contracts without inconvenience to the Exchange, once retirement has taken 
place. il 
The plan provides other benefits as well. An employee who resigns from the service 
or withdraws from the plan may continue his regular deposits and thus may receive 
at retirement the full annuity purchasable by his own accumulations; or he may take 
a paid-up policy for an annuity to begin at age 65; or he may draw his own contri- 
butions in one sum without interest. The return of contributions without interest in 
case of withdrawal is one step toward sound emphasis upon the fact that the plan 
is a retirement plan and not a savings plan. In the event of total and permanent dis- 
bility after twenty years service, the employee will enter at once into his service 
annuity as secured by contracts already issued year by year, and his own contribu- 
tions will be waived, the contract under which they were made being continued to 
provide an income at the age of sixty-five years over and above the disability benefit. 
If an employee dies before retirement, his beneficiary receives the total sum of the 
employee’s deposits. When death occurs after income payments have begun, the bene- 
ficiary receives whatever balance may remain from the retired employee’sown accumu- 
lations in the plan. I 
Certain additional privileges may be mentioned. Although the normal age of re- 
tirement is sixty-five, upon agreement between the Stock Exchange and lhe employee, 
retirement may take place either earlier or later, with corresponding changes of value 
in the annuities. Furthermore, additional contributions from the employee are re- 
ceivable at any time. Finally, and perhaps most important of all, “This plan may be 
amended at any time; but no future change shall in any way affect the superannuation 
benefits payable under Service Annuities offered under the plan as to service rendered; 
or the disability benefit as to disability occurring prior to such change.” This assurance 
represents complete contractual security. When it is considered tin emlyes of 
the Stock Exchange now on retiring allowances and all those who had attained age 
60 at the inauguration of the system, will be provided for independently of the plan, 
its full liberality and inclusiveness become apparent. 
With two provisions issue may be justifiably taken. First, the fact that membership
-P-A-G-E-179
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 169 
is voluntary, even to the extent that a member may withdraw from the plan and still 
remain in the employ of the Stock Exchange. This provision may invalidate in some 
cases the very purpose that the plan is intended to serve, and perhaps even more often 
in cases in which provision for old age is most essential. Secondly, the cash surrender 
value under the third option for withdrawal may in certain instances be found to make 
resignation relatively profitable, especially in times of financial stress. Herein, how- 
ever, lies a strong appeal to an employee; no one can lose any of the money that 
he puts in. Such matters are of relatively minor importance when viewed in the light 
of the very sound progress which this plan, and those for the employees of the Metro- 
politan Life Insurance Company and the Western Clock Company, represent in the 
field of old age annuities for those in industry. 
Other New Industrial Pension Plans 
Some of the other industrial retirement plans inaugurated during the year reflect 
the effort to fund pension obligations in advance. For example, the Associated Press, 
in December, 1924, announced a pension, disability, and death benefit plan for which 
an initial appropriation of $100,000 was set aside, and which contemplates annual 
contributions, by the association only, up to five per cent of payroll. No contractual 
rights are assured. The Du Pont-Boomer Properties Corporation, operators of hotels, 
in concluding a group life insurance, disability, and pension plan has associated it- 
self with the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company. Similarly, the Southern 
California Gas Company entered into an agreement with the Pacific Mutual Life 
Insurance Company, of San Francisco, to establish for its employees a system of 
pensions and insurance beginning October 1, 1924. The Pacific Mutual, as carrier, 
issues a group contract in units, each yielding life insurance to the amount of $500, 
a disability benefit if begun below age 60 of $10 a month, and a pension of $10 a 
month after age 65. The plan has no relation to current operating cost through pay- 
roll; employees contribute about twenty-four per cent of the total annual premium 
by deductions from wages. The new Barker Foundation, with an endowment of some 
$750,000 as a trust fund held by a bank, includes among its functions the payment 
of non-contractual annuities to former employees of the Haskell and Barker Car 
Company, of Chicago. 
Certain other recently inaugurated retirement plans present striking contrasts one 
with another. The Union Oil Company of California made effective on July 1, 1924, 
a joint contributory provident fund with loan, withdrawal, disability, and retirement 
benefits, a reserve fund, and conservative actuarial tables, which offers a number of 
sound and liberal provisions that would be the stronger if the loan privilege were 
discarded. On the other hand, the Laclede (Indiana) Gas Light Company on January 
1, 1925, began a service annuity system with benefits based upon maximum average 
salary, retirement at various ages from fifty-five to sixty-five according to service, and
-P-A-G-E-180

annuities ranging from $300 to $6000. If, however, in any period of twelve consecu- 
tive months the company’s disbursement for service annuities exceeds one per cent 
of gross income, or a fixed limit, all annuities will be prorated. An old-fashioned, 
non-funded, non-contributory pension system was inaugurated April 1, 1925, by the 
Texas and Pacific Railway Company. | 
With the example of contractual and financial security set by the retirement plans 
for employees of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the New York Stock Ex- 
change, and the Western Clock Company, it is to be hoped that more business and 
industrial concerns may be led to appreciate and to adopt the principle of funding 
in advance the sums necessary to meet future pension obligations. Only by this means 
can the security of a contract be afforded. 
Otp-AcE Pensions IN THE Unirep States 
As a result of a more or less organized movement throughout the country, bills to 
establish old-age pension systems were considered in the legislatures of the following 
states: California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, where the movement was 
opposed by the Grange, Massachusetts, where the proposal is under consideration by 
the state pension commission, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, 
and the State of Washington. The subject has been agitated in Colorado, and in 
Wisconsin an old-age pension law was passed to permit counties to inaugurate sys- 
tems under the supervision of county judges. Pennsylvania has instituted a commis- 
sion to study the whole question. 
Press reports indicate that in all of these states the proposals were similar in tenor 
to those sponsored by the Fraternal Order of Eagles and the National League for 
Old-Age Pensions. The practical reasons urged for the establishment of old-age pen- 
sion systems include the contention that they will abolish almshouses and will cost 
no more than the present methods of caring for aged- and indigent persons; that 
old-age doles make for righteous living and better social and economic conditions; 
that many prefer to starve rather than go to the poorhouse; that a working man who 
has contributed health and strength, vigor and skill to the creation of wealth by 
which taxation is borne has made his contribution to the fund which is to give him 
a pension ; and that a pension is a fulfilment of an acknowledged obligation, a de- 
ferred payment for services rendered. The fallaciousness of such arguments has been 
repeatedly exposed. European enquiries show clearly that old-age pensions do not 
abolish almshouses, and that doles can scarcely be said to make for righteous living. 
It is interesting to find the theory that pensions are deferred pay twisted from its 
original bearing and used to motivate a movement that distorts the entire operation 
of the principles of retirement. 
One influential organization has refused to be stampeded into riaciialinese of a pro- 
gram that has come to grief in at least one state. Press reports of the recommen-    
-P-A-G-E-181
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 171 
dations of the Executive Council to the convention of the American Federation of 
Labor, held in November, 1924, at El Paso, Texas, contain the following proposal : 
“Further study of the problem of old-age pensions with the suggestion that some life 
insurance methods be evolved rather than to depend upon legislation.” 
In Pennsylvania an opinion written by Justice Kephart of the Supreme Court, 
Middle District (Busser et al. v. State Treasurer e¢ al., appellants, No. 7, May term, 
1925, appealed from the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County), 
sustains a previous decision of a lower court, that the Old-Age Assistance Act of 
1923 is in violation of the state constitution. A sentence or two from the opinion 
of Justice Kephart might well be read by all those interested in old-age pensions: 
“ As industrial evolution has worked a marked change in economic life, bringing about 
to a large extent the conditions complained of by the proponents of the Act, the 
moral duty rests on those industrial organizations and other employers of labor to 
provide the system and means to take care of old age, and those dependent thereon; 
this is a primary rule of the present economic period.” With reference to the Mothers’ 
Assistance Act, and State Employees, Teachers, and Judicial Retirement Acts, “The 
basis on which these Acts are founded is neither charitable nor benevolent; they are 
founded on faithful, valuable service actually rendered to the commonwealth over a 
long period of years, under a system of classification which the legislature has con- 
sidered reasonable. These appropriations are for delayed compensation for these years 
of continued service actually given in the performance of public duties, in their re- 
spective capacities, with the quality of right and obligation in its concept. It is com- 
pensation for the hazard of long continued public employment.” 
“The conclusion is therefore irresistible that a direct appropriation from the state 
treasury to any person or class of persons cannot be sustained on the theory that it is 
a discharge of the inherent obligation of the State to take care of its paupers.” 
With the decision that the Pennsylvania old-age pension was unconstitutional, the 
repeal of the Nevada old-age pension law of 1923, and the adoption of the Wisconsin 
act, the only states in which old-age pensions are in force are Montana and Wis- 
consin.

OE ae Burron Apams was born in Fairfield, Vermont, June 3, 1851, and was 
graduated from Beloit College in 1873 and several years later from the Yale 
Divinity School. He began his teaching career as professor of history at Drury Col- 
lege, leaving there in 1888 to become Larned professor of American History at Yale 
University. In 1890 he was transferred to his particular field of European history, in 
which he continued until his retirement in 1917. 
Professor Adams was an outstanding member of the older group of great Yale 
teachers, and was largely responsible for the organization and development of the de- 
partment of history at Yale both in the College and the Graduate School. Many 
of the younger historical scholars and teachers of the country passed through his 
classes in the Graduate School. He was considered the foremost American authority 
on the British Constitution, and his books on that subject and on mediaeval history 
gained for him an international reputation. 
The Carnegie Foundation granted Professor Adams a; retiring allowance in July,

ment of Superintendent of Education of the island. He retired from active service 
in 1912 after having been at the head of educational affairs in the province for half 
a century. 
Dr. Anderson was called the Arnold of Prince Edward Island, and the introduc-

he was asked to assemble a loan collection of paintings for exhibition on that occa- 
sion. The following year he was elected a life member of the board of trustees and 
director of Fine Arts of the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh. During his long term 
of office Mr. Beatty was instrumental not only in establishing a valuable permanent 
collection of paintings in the Museum of Fine Arts, but instituted the only yearly 
international exhibition of paintings shown in America. These exhibits assumed an 
added importance from the fact that a selected group of paintings was sent on tour 
to other museums throughout the country before being returned to Europe. Mr. 
Beatty was active also in educational work, coéperating with the public schools in 
offering instruction in fine arts to the children of Pittsburgh. He retired in 1922,

boy living in Minneapolis he was faced with the need of earning a livelihood, 
but used his spare time for study and was determined to secure college training. 
He was aided by friends in this desire, and in 1900 was graduated from Carleton Col-

the Yale Divinity School, and on graduation was ordained in the Congregational 
ministry. His first charge was at Brookfield, Connecticut, and at the same time he 
was assistant professor of theology at Yale University. In 1908 he was called to the 
Church of the Pilgrims in Brooklyn, but after two years he again entered the field 
of education as president of Smith College, and until his untimely death at the age 
of fifty rose to positions of increasingly great responsibility, first as president of the 
University of Minnesota in 1917, and in 1920 as president of the University of Michi-

Vertebrate Zodlogy, and in this office he remained for forty-two years. He foresaw 
from the beginning of his career that the study of human anatomy was a subject which 
would form one of the most important factors in the biological training of the future, 
and he established a four years course in natural history which was the precursor of 
the movement for the better education of physicians, and the consequent improve- 
ment of medical schools throughout the country. In 1893, on the twenty-fifth anniver- 
sary of the opening of Cornell University, distinguished men from all over the country 
collaborated in presenting Professor Wilder a volume of scientific monographs. He 
retired from active service in 1910. 
The Carnegie Foundation granted Professor Wilder a retiring allowance in June, 
1910. He died in Newton Centre, Massachusetts, January 21, 1925.

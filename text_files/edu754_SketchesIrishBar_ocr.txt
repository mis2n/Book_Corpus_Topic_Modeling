MEMOIR OF MR. SHEIL. 
Ricnarv Lator Suen, author of “Sketches of the Irish 
Bar,” was born at. Waterford, in. Ireland, in the year 1793. 
He died at Florence, where he was British Minister, on April 
25, 1851, aged fifty-eight. 
His father, who had been a merchant at Cadiz, retired on a 
competence, which enabled him to purchase an estate in the 
county of Waterford. . Returning to mercantile pursuits, he 
was unfortunate, and died, leaving his sons little more than 
the means of perfecting a liberal education. One of these sons 
was Colonel Justin Sheil, yet surviving, who, for several years, 
was British Ambassador to Persia. 
Like O’Connell, who was nearly twenty years his senior, 
Sheil was originally intended for the Catholic Church. At an 
early age, he was sent to a Jesuit school at Kensington, near 
London. He was subsequently removed to Stonyhurst, in 
Lancashire, whence he went to Trinity College, Dublin, with 
a competent knowledge of the classics, some acquaintance with 
Italiari and Spanish, and the power of speaking and writing 
French, as if it were his mother-tongue. His taste for litera- 
ture and his facility for rhetorical composition were early 
developed. In the University he won several classical prizes, 
and was acknowledged to surpass most of his fellow-students 
in general acquirements. He was a constant and favorite 
speaker in the celebrated Historical Society (the cradle of 
Trish eloquence at the time), where the brilliancy and force of 
his rhetoric always commanded admiration and applause.
-P-A-G-E-7
6 MEMOIR OF MR. SHEIL. 
Then, as ever after, his oratory consisted of more than flowing 
sentences, for he generalized and applied facts, with rare and 
remarkable felicity. He graduated before he was twenty 
years old, and his college comates prophesied that his career 
would be distinguished. 
At this.time, and for a few years preceding, he floated on 
the surface of Dublin society. Small in stature, slight in 
figure, and eminently ‘vivacious in manner and deportment, he 
came into society, almost a boy—as Moore had done, some 
fifteen years earlier— and, like Moore, he gave rise to sanguine 
anticipations. It was a doubt whether he would subside into 
a poet or an orator, but every one saw and said that he was 
marked for distinction. There were great men in Dublin at 
that time: Plunket, with unequalled powers of eloquence and . 
reasoning; Bushe, silvery-tongued as Belial, but full of capti- 
vating amiability; Goold, inibued with a charming amour 
propre, which made you like, while you smiled at the man; 
O'Connell, in the full strength of youth and power, storming 
_ his way to the head of his profession; North, the college rival 
and friend of Sheil, whose maturity did not fulfil the promise 
' of his youth; Wolfe, afterward Chief-Baron, with the kindest 
and truest heart throbbing in a gnarly case; and others, more 
or less distinguished, then or since. At that time, too, Grattan 
and Curran were the ornaments of intellectual life in Dublin; | 
full of reminiscences of the Volunteers in 1782, and the Reign 
of Terror in 1798. 
It was natural that, amid such men, Sheil, young, ardent, 
and highly-gifted, should set up a high standard of excellence, 
to which to direct his own ambitious strivings; and that “Ex- | 
celsior” should be to him, as to all who worthily aspire, at 
once a motto and @ monitor. . 
He was barely twenty when, in 1813, he made-his first - 
plunge into public and political life. There were divisions 
among the_Irish Catholics then. One section, aristocratic and 
moderate—who, rather than the clanking should offend the 
“ears polite” of their rulers, would willingly have wrapped 
. their fetters in velvet —desired to give the British government.

that, Emancipation were conceded. The other, democratic 
and bold, denounced all compromise. Sheil attached himself 
to the first, while O’Connell headed the latter. Both Tribunes 
of the People were able and eloquent— but the man, O’Con- 
nell, prevailed over the boy, Sheil, and the latter quitted the 
field, for a time. 
In.1814, at the age of twenty-one, Sheil was called to the 
' Irish Bar. His youth was against him, of course. His predi- 
lections were in favor of literature, and, for several years, his 
contributions to the London magazines afforded him the 
_ chief means of subsistence. He wrote for the stage, also— 
~ excited by the brilliant genius of Miss O’Neil, the Irish trage- 
dietne—and his play of “Evadne” still retains a place in 
the acted drama, by reason of its declamatory poetry and 
effective situations. . 
On the Leinster Cireuit, Mr. Sheil had to contend (strange as 
it may appear), with his previous reputation as an orator— for 
a good point. at law is considered better, on account of its 
weight with the judge, than a brilliant speech, intended to 
win the verdict of a jury. At the bar, it must be confessed, 
Mr. Sheil never attained the highest distinction. His legal 
knowledge was limited, as respects depth and extent. In 
criminal cases, his eloquence often prevailed with juries, and, 
as he gradually reached seniority, he also obtained leading 
briefs at Nisi-Prius. In the Four-Courts, where the metropol- 
itan practice takes place, Sheil eventually came to be consid- 
ered a passable general lawyer. 
In 1823 (as related by himself in the article on Catholic 
Leaders), he joined with O’Connell, in establishing the Catho- 
lic Association, which literally became a sort of imperium in 
imperio in Ireland. In this body, both leaders spoke earnestly 
and well. O’Connell’s réle was to insist on “Justice for Ire- 
land,” Sheil’s to cast contempt and ridicule upon what was 
called Protestant. Aseendency. 
In 1825, both leaders (“ Magné comitante catervé’*}, went to 
London, as part of a deputation, at the time when, the sup- 
pression of the Catholic Association becoming a government 
preliminary, Emancipation—clogged.with “the wings,” viz,
-P-A-G-E-9

disfranchisement of the forty shilling freeholders, and state- 
payment of the Catholic clergy—would have been granted, 
but for-a speech from the Duke of York, heir-presumptive to 
the throne, in which he made a solemn vow to Heaven, that he 
would never accede to the’ concession. 
At the- general election of 1826, when Lord George Beres- 
ford’s almost hereditary claims to represent Waterford county 
in Parliament, were unexpectedly contested by Mr. Villiers 
Stuart, a retainer to act as counsel for Lord George, was ac- 
cepted by Mr. Sheil. There was some dissatisfaction, at. the 
time, among the Catholics, at one of their ablest and most 
trusted leaders acting for a candidate of opposite politics; but 
O'Connell frankly and publicly did him the justice of saying, 
that, as a lawyer, Mr. Sheil was, in a manner, bound to act for 
whoever employed him. As there never was a question of the 
ability with which he performed his duty on that occasion, so 
was there never a belief that, in such performance, Mr. Sheil 
compromised his own principles, or those of his party. The 
election—thanks to the very forty-shilling freeholders, to 
whose disfranchisement (as part of the price of Emancipation), 
O'Connell would bave consented, in 1825—ended in the 
defeat of Mr. Sheil’s noble and anti-Catholic client. 
The death of the Duke of York, the sworn opponent of the 
Catholics, took place in 1827, and Mr. Sheil took occasion, 
during and after his illness, to make some speeches, by no 
means in good taste, upon the Royal sufferer. - About that 
time, too, he was prosecuted for too much freedom of speech 
on Wolfe Tone’s autobiography, on the Catholic Association 
(which had risen, more powerful than ever, on the ruins of 
that which was suppressed in 1825), but never tried. 
' In the following year (1828), the Catholic Association, in. 
possession of ample funds from “ the Rent” which O’Connell 
had established, determined to resist the re-election of Mr. 
Vesey Fitzgerald, member for the. County of Clare, because, 
though he had always voted for Emancipation, he had taken 
office in the Duke of Wellington’s Anti-Catholic Government. 
O'Connell was the opposing candidate, and, after a fierce and 
exciting contest, he was elected by an overpowering majority.
-P-A-G-E-10
MEMOIR OF MR. SHEIL. 9 
- My. Sheil warmly and efficiently assisted in this contest (of 
which his own narrative appears in the second volume); and 
his speech at its close, eminently practical as well as eloquent, 
is entitled to rank among his happiest efforts. 
In the October following, being in London, it was‘suggested 
that Mr. Sheil should speak in advocacy of the Catholic claims, 
at a great Anti-Catholic meeting of the freeholders of Kent. 
He was unable, from the opposition presented to himself and 
- other liberals, to utter more than a single sentence. Having 
taken the precaution, however, to give a copy of his (intended) 
harangue to the editor of “the Sun” newspaper, it was pub- 
lished, the same day, as part of the proceedings, and made a. 
great impression on the public mind. Mr. Sheil’s own account 
of the Penenden Heath Meeting, as it was called from the 
locality where it was held, appears in the second volume. 
The Roman Catholic Relief Bill, passed in 1829, was the 
natural consequence of the Clare Election. It opened a new 
and enlarged sphere of action to Mr. Sheil, who was now eli- 
gible to sit in Parliament. At this time he was only thirty-six 
years old, with a high reputation, great. powers, and immense 
‘popularity. Through the influence of Lord Anglesey, he 
was elected for the borough of Milbourne Port, but he had 
previously been an unsuccessful candidate for the County of 
Louth in 1830, for which he was elected in 1831. He was 
returned for the County of Tipperary in 1832 and in 1835, 
without a contest, and; against a strong opposition, in 1837. 
Accepting office in 1838, he was again unsuccessfully opposed. 
From 1841 to 1850, he represented the small Irish borough of 
Dungarvan. 
In Parliament, the position occupied by Ms. Sheil was im- 
mediate, unquestioned, and exalted. In fact, he took rank, 
at once, as, one of the best orators in the House of Commons. 
He was far from being a ready debater—though some of his 
‘ extempore replies were quick, reasoning, and acute— but’ his 
prepared speeches enchained attention, and won the applause 
even of his antagonists. He had the disadvantage of. a-small 
person, negligent attire, shrill voice, and vehement gesticula- 
_ tion; but these were all forgotten when he spoke, and his sin- 
1*
-P-A-G-E-11

" gularly peculiar manner gave the appearance of impulse even 
to his most elaborated compositions... Words can not briefly 
describe the character of Sheil’s rhetoric: it was aptly said, in 
the style of his own ‘metaphors, “he thinks lightning.” : 
Mr. Sheil was personally mich. liked by all parties in the 
Legislature. © In 1834, when he was charged with having 
secretly and treacherously urged. the Minister to carry an 
Irish Coercion Bill, which the liberal members were publicly 
opposing, it is doubtful whether his own party, or his oppo- 
nents, were most rejoiced at his full acquittal. 
After his entrance into parliamentary life, his bar-practice 
in Ireland was almost wholly neglected. In 1844, however, 
although he had himself avoided participation in the Repeal 
- .excitement, he reappeared in the Four Courts, at-Dublin, at the - 
‘State Trials, as advocate for John O’Connell, and delivered 
a most eloquent speech in his defence, the delivery of which 
occupied six hours.. This closed, his professional career. 
From his entrance into Parliament, he rather sided with the 
Whig than the Irish party. In time he had his reward — 
having been successively a Commissioner of Greenwich Hospi- 
tal, Vice-President of the Board of’ Trade, Judge-Advocate 
General, and Master of the’ Mint, besides being a Queen’s 
Counsel and Privy Counsellor. Of late years, his voice was 
seldom heard in the House. He seemed to think that his 
work was ended with Emancipation and the .abolition of, 
Tithes. He had declined into-a mere placeman—réalizing 
Moore’s sarcasm:—- . 5 
“ As bees on flowers alighting, cease their hum, 
So, settling upon places, Whigs grow dumb.” 
Curiously enough, Mr. Sheil’s appointment under the Whigs, 
in 1846, to the office of Master of the. Mint, broke up the Ivish 
party which O’Connell long had led. On acceptance of office, 
it was requisite that he should go back to his constituents 
of Dungarvan, as a candidate for re-election. “A strong and 
rising: section of the Repealers urged that, as in 1828 with 
Vesey Fitzgerald, Mr. Sheil should be-opposed, as. member of 
a Government who would not grant “justice to Ireland,” save 
on the strongest pressure from without.. O’Connell would
-P-A-G-E-12

not. consent thus to oppose Sheil, having better hopes of the 
Whigs than his more youthful and eager associates. O’Con- 
nell allowed Sheil to be re-elected, without opposition, on the 
ground of his own reluctance to embarrass the Government. 
Certain resolutions, affirming this temporizing policy, were | 
proposed by John O’Oonnell, and carried by a large majority 
in the Repeal Association. But the minority—more power- 
_ ful in virtues, boldness, and talent, than in numbers—seceded 
from the Association, and formed what was called the “ Young 
Ireland” party, resolved to achieve the independence of their 
country, even if it were to be battled for with arms as well 
as words. Most distinguished in this party were O’Brien, 
Mitchel, Meagher, and Martin, who soon after founded “The 
Trish Confederation,” one principle of which was opposition 
to office-seeking on the part of persons professing nationality. 
Soon after, O'Connell died. The Revolutions of 1848 came 
next, and that which was attempted in Ireland, with an unsur- 
passed purity and intensity of purpose, failed like all the rest. 
In November, 1850, when Lord John Russell was attacking 
the Catholic religion, as consisting of “the mummeries of 
superstition,” and was preparing to bring in his Ecclesiastical 
Titles Bill, the Embassy to Florence was offered to, and ac- 
cepted by, Mr. Sheil, whose health was declining, and whose 
religious feelings must have been opposed, had he remained in 
England, to Lord John Russell's anti-Catholic measures. 
To Florence, therefore, he proceeded, full of hope that the 
fine climate would renew his failing health, and looking on his 
appointment as a dignified close to his public career. The 
suicide of Mr. Power, son of Mr. Sheil’s second wife (his first 
had been Miss O’Hallaran, niece of Sir William Mahon,’ 
Master of the Rolls in Ireland), gave him such a shock as to 
induce an attack of gout in the stomach, of which he died. 
His remains. were conveyed to Ireland in a British ship-of- 
war, and were interred at Long Orchard, four miles from 
‘Templemore, in the County of Tipperary. 
Fain would I here have done more than thus briefly and? Fap- — 
idly record the leading events in‘Mr. Sheil’s public lifer but my

tunity of doiig him fuller justice in a future volume, in which 
I may attempt to give pen-portraits of politicians and authors, 
artists and polemics, lawyers and orators, whom I have known 
in Europe. 
The publication of “Sketches of the Irish Bar” was com- 
menced in 1822, in The New Monthly Magazine, a London 
periodical then conducted by Thomas Campbell, the poet. 
The idea originated with William Henry Curran, son and 
biographer of the great Irish orator and patriot, but the 
’ execution was Sheil’s. 
The first sketch, which appeared in August, 1822 (and per- 
_ haps one of the ablest, being analytic as well as rhetorical), 
was that of Plunket. The far-famed paper on O’Connell, 
which is the best known of the series (having been repeatedly 
reprinted in Europe and America, and translated into French, 
German, Italian, and Spanish), did not appear until July, 1823., 
It immediately attracted attention and applause; and, from 
that time, the “Sketches of the Irish Bar” were eagerly 
looked for in The New Monthly, the reputation of which they 
mainly contributed to sustain. The last sketch was that: of 
Leslie Foster, published in February and March, 1829. 
A schoolboy, when the “ Sketches” were commenced, (and, 
albeit a Protestant, entertaining a strong general impression 
that my countrymen, the Irish Catholics, were very harshly 
treated,) I eagerly perused such of them as were copied into 
an excellent journal, now no more, called The Cork Mercantile 
Chronicle. As I grew older, I could better appreciate their 
keen satire, their sharp antithesis, their close observation, their 
personal gossip, their liberal spirit, and their generous senti- 
ment. At last, it was my own hap to become a member of the 
press, at an age when (I now feel) I should rather have been 
improving my own mind, than presumptuously attempting to 
instruct others. . 
In 1826, an enterprising bookseller in Cork resolved to 
make the experiment of trying whether Ireland, which eagerly 
received her literature from London and Edinburgh, could. 
support a periodical of her own. He engaged the services of
-P-A-G-E-14
MEMOIR OF MR. SHEIL. 13 
some distinguished Literati in the South of Ireland, and had no 
lack of, younger’ contributors willing to write for “the honor 
and glory” of being-in print. Among these were several who 
have since been distinguished. There was Callanan, author 
of the exquisite lyric called “ Gougane Barra,” whose rhythm 
flows along like the melodious rippling of a gently-murmuring 
rivulet; there was O’Meagher, author of a poem called “ Zed- 
* echias,” and now the efficient and able Paris correspondent of 
the London Times; there was O’Leary, who wrote the chanson 
@ boire “ Whiskey, drink divine!” so redolent of Innishowen ; 
there was John Windele, now a zealous and-rational antiqua- 
rian; there was the late John Augustus Shea, already distin- 
guished among his fellows for poetic genius, flashing wit, 
classic: eloquence, and social companionship; and, lingering 
far behind, as became the youngest and humblest, the writer 
of this notice completed the array of volunteer contributors. 
lt struck all of us that the periodical would at once achieve 
snecess, if My. Sheil could be induced to become a contributor. 
Mr. Bolster, the. publisher, obtained -an interview, and asked 
whether Mr. Sheil could write for him, and was gratified with 
an affirmative reply. As the conversation went.on, Mr. Sheil 
mentioned several subjects on which he was willing to write. 
The publisher was charmed with the interest which the future 
contributor appeared to take in the periodical. At last came 
the business question: “ How much per sheet do you mean to 
pay?” The somewhat hesitating reply was, that no payment 
“was contemplated at first, but that, whenever any profits ac- 
crued, he might depend on’ being remunerated. Mr. Sheil 
shook his head and said, “I am afraid your terms will not suit 
me. However, as you have done me the compliment of wish- 
ing me to write for you, I must give you something. Instead 
of calling your periodical ‘Bolster’s Magazine of Ireland, 
accept a more appropriate name for it, from me. Considering 
the place whence it is to issue, and the terms which you Offer, 
let-me suggest that you call it ‘The Corn-screw.’” 
My own personal acquaintance with Mr. Sheil was made in 
October, 1828, in London,*on the evening of the Penenden 
Heath Meeting. His conversation—full of wit and humor,
-P-A-G-E-15
14 MEMOIR OF MR. SHBIL. 
with graver alternations of serious talk— was the charm of 
that gay and delightful night. 
Ti: 1844, I applied to Mr: Sheil for permission to republish 
_ some of the “ Sketches,” and his prompt reply (of which a fac 
simile is given in the second volume) gave the promise of as- 
sisting me in making the selection.. I was then at Oxford, and 
was unable to call upon him in London until the next year. He 
had forgotten my name, in the lapse between 1828 and 1845, 
but instantly recollected my person and’ my voice. - Entering 
heartily into my views, he gave me whatever permission was 
“in his power, as writer, to republish the “ Sketches,” wholHy-or _ 
in part, but doubted whether the copyright did not belong to _ 
Mr. Colburn, the proprietor of The New Monthly. Magazine, 
for which he had written them.- He gave me a-list. of the 
‘whole series, and further drew my attention to two’ other 
“Sketches,” which had appeared in the first volume of Camp- 
bell’s Metropolitan’ Magazine in 1831. These (on Lord-Chan- 
cellor Brougham and the State of Parties in Dublin), conclude 
the second volume, and, in their personal details, are ‘not in- 
ferior in interest to any which precede them. 
Encouraged by the frank kindness with which T-was met, r 
suggested the republication of all the “ Sketches,” and stated 
my idea of the manner in which they should be edited. Mr. 
Sheil stated his inability —from pressure of other occupations, 
and a.distaste of the literary labor it would impose-—to anno- 
tate, or. even to revise the articles; but strongly urged me to 
act as Editor——a. duty for which, he was pleased .to say, I 
was qualified by my knowledge of politics and parties in Ive- 
land, and my acquaintance with most of the persons of whom 
he had made mention. Thus encouraged, I accepted the 
charge; and had repeated conferences on the subject, during the 
following twelve months; but, in the summer of 1846, Mr. Sheil 
resumed office as Master of. the Mint, which greatly engrossed 
his time, and my own was so much occupied, to the exclusion 
of litefary labor, that I was unable then to proceed with my 
task, which I did not resume until recently. 
A generation has passed away since the first of these 
“ Sketches” appeared, and, had I edited this work in England’

I must have freely annotated it, to make. its allusions to per-

be carried. out: yet more fully. Therefore, in the copious notes

I have: been laborious I know, that I am accurate in state- 
ments and dates.I believe. My own political opinions béing 
liberal, their tone has -breathed itself, no doubt, into what I 
have written, but. I trust that its general impartiality will be 
acknowledged. Wherever my own personal knowledge could 
avail, I have freely used it. All of the subjects of. the 
“Sketches” I have seen and heard in public; with many of 
them I was more or less acquainted. 
The “Sketches” are of a three-fold character. -Some are 
individual, as relating to public men.. Some show the practice 
of the Irish Bar, as exhibited in reports of interesting criminal 
cases. The third class consists of narratives of public events 
connected with the cause of civil and religious liberty in 
Treland. Thus, there are graphie descriptions of O’Comnell, 
Plunket, and their contemporaries. There are the thrilling 
narratives’ of Scanlan’s trial at Limerick (on which Gerald © 
Griffin founded his tragic story of “The Collegians”) and the 
‘trials of Father Carrol, at Wexford; of the murderers of Dan- 
iel Mara, at Clonmel; and of Gorman, for “the burning of the 
Sheas.” There are also Mr. Sheil’s own recollections of the 
formation of the Catholic Association in 1823; ‘of the visit of 
‘the Catholic Deputation to London in 1825; of the great Clare 
Election, and the Penenden Heath Meeting in 1828; and of 
Lord Brougham’s reception, as Chancellor, in 1831. Nor,

~are lighter scenes deficient, such as the account of the Tabinet

an imaginary Testimonial to Lord Mamers, and the Sketch 
of the judicial mime, Lord Norbury. In reality, this work, 
with its strong contrasts of light and shade, is a sort of personal 
history of Irish polities and politicians (for the Bar did not 
affect neutrality), during the half century following the parch- 
ment Union between Ireland and Great Britain. 
The portrait of Mr. Sheil in this volume, is a fac-simile 
of an original sketch in my possession, made in_ London, in - 
1825, by Mr. S. Catterson Smith, then a young Irish artist of 
considerable promise, and now of such leading eminence that 
he was selected to paint the portrait of Lord Clarendon, late. 
Viceroy of Ireland, to be placed in Dublin Castle. The like- 
ness of Mr. Slieil, it must be noted, represents him as hf was 
at the age of thirty-two. 
Here, dismissing these volumes from my hand, I conclude 
my labors. Here are rescued from the perishable periodicals in 
which they mouldered, the admirable productions of a man, 
who, while our language lasts, will be spoken of ag one of the 
most brilliant orators that Ireland, affluent in eloquence, ever 
had cause to be proud of—productions emanating from the 
freshness of his purpurea juventus, before his patriotism had 
been rendered cold or doubtful, by his acceptance of place. 
They stand— , 
“A deathless part of him who died too soon.’ 
My own part, humble as it is, claims to be honest in pur- 
pose, and laboriously faithful in execution. I believe that the 
“ Sketehes of the Irish Bar,” now first collected, will be found 
to possess abiding interest, because they emanate from a mas- 
. ter-mind, and are written with fidelity and spirit. -I have 
arranged them in an order different from that in which they 
originally appeared (on Mr. Sheil’s own suggestion, that there 
should be contrast in the grouping), but I present them, with- 
out mutilation or. change, as they were first given to the public.

. AUTHOR’S INTRODUCTION. 
Wuen I first visited Dublin (it was about three years ago), 
I was a frequent attendant at the Coutts of Justice, or, as they 
are more familiarly styled, the “Four Courts.” The printed 
speeches of Curran had just fallen into my hands; and, not- 
withstanding their numerous and manifest defects, whether of 
the reporter or the speaker, the general effect of the perusal 
was to impréss me with a very favorable opinion of Irish foren- 
sie eloquence. Although, as an Englishman,* I might not 
participate in the political fervor which forms one of their chief 
recommendations to his admirers in Ireland, or, in my severer 
judgment, approve’ of a general style that differed so essen- 
_tially from the models of. British taste, still there was a fresh- 
ness and vitality pervading the whole—glowing imagery — 
abounding phraseology—trains of argument and illustration 
at once vigorous and original—and incessant home pushes at 
the human heart, of which the attractions were entirely inde- 
pendent of loeal or party associations. 
Under these impressions, and the opportunity being now 
afforded me, I made it a kind of literary object to ascertain 
how far the peculiarities that struck me belonged to the man 
* Mr. Seri commenced these Sketches in 1822, with the idea of their being © 
taken us the production of an impartial Englishman, and he continued to wear 
the mask long after common report had assigned his writings to their true pa- 
ternity. In his account of the Clare Election, which took place in 1828, and 
rendered Catholic Emancipation inevitable, Mr, Sheil frankly admitted the au- 
thorship.— M. .

or the country, With this view, I resorted almost daily for 
the space of two terms to the Four Courts, where I studied 
with some industry the manner and intellectual character of ~ 
~ gome of the most eminent pleaders. The result was, a little 
collection of forensic sketches, accurate enough, it struck me, 
as far as they went; but on the whole so incomplete, that I 
had no design of offering them to the public: they remained 
almost forgotten in my commonplace-book, until his Majesty’s 
late visit to Ireland,” when I was persuaded by a friend to 
follow in the royal train. All that I saw and thought upon 
that occasion is beside my present purpose. 
I return to my sketches: My friend and I remained in Ire- 
land till the month of December. We made an excursion to 
‘the lakes of Killarney and to the Giants’ Causeway ; and, 
during our tour, the Cireuits being fortunately out, I was thus 
furnished with the means of correcting or confirming many ob- 
-servations upon some of the most prominent subjects of my 
sketches. The same. opportunity was afforded me on my re- 
turn to Dublin, where the Courts were sitting during the last 
month of our stay. I now, for the first time, and principally 
from deference to my, companion’s opinion that the subject 
would be interesting, resolved at a leisure hour to arrange my 
‘scattered memoranda into a form that might meet the public 
eye. I may not be enabled to execute my plan to its entire 
extent. In the event of my fulfilling my purpose, I must 
premise, that I do not profess to include every member of the 
Trish bar who has risen to eminence in his profession: I pro- 
pose to speak only of those whom I heard sufficiently qften to 
catch the peculiarities of their mind and manner; and, with 
regard to these, I beg to disclaim all pretensions to adjust their 
comparative merits and professional importance. Were it pos- 
sible, I should introduce their names in the form of a Round 
Robin, where none could be said to enjoy precedence. 
* George IV. visited Ireland in August, 1821, and had no cause te complain 
of his reception, The Irish appeared drunk with joy, and rattled their chaing 
as if they were proud of them. M.

  _. SKETCHES OF THE IRISH BAR. 
  AN IRISH CIRCUIT. 
ir any one, tired with the monotonous regularity of a more 
civilized existence, should desire to plunge at once into another 
scene, and take refuge from ennui in that stirring complexity 
of feeling produced by a series of images, solemn, pathetic, lu- 
dicrous, and loathsome, each crossing each in rapid and endless 
succession, I would recommend to him to attend one of the 
periodical progresses of Irish law through the interior of that 
anomalous country ; and more ‘particularly through one of the 
southern districts, which, out of deference to Captain Rock, I 
have selected as the scene of the present sketch. 
Going circuit in Ireland, though of great importance to the 
health of the bar—they would die of stagnation else—is at 
the outset but a dreary piece of business.* When the time ap-

the trial of criminal cases and of civil or Nisi Prius suits. Hach circuit con- - 
sists of a certain number of counties, and. most of the barristers derive a consid 
erable portion of their incomes from their labors, as advocates, on the circuit. 
A barrister may change his circuit once—but even. this is rare—and the ordi- 
nary practice is, having once.commenced in one district (usually including the 
Jocality of his own relatives and friends), always to continue in it, When a 
lawyer is called out of his own to plead for plaintiff or defendant in another 
circuit, it is said that he is “ engaged specially,” and. receives a large fee or 
. honorarium accordingly. The largest “ special” fee ever received in England 
was by one of the present ex-Chancellors, Lord Truro (then Sir Thomas Wilde),

proaches, one can generally perceive, by the faces in the Hall,* 
that it is felt as such. There are, of course, exceptions. A 
prosperous man, certain of a rich harvest of record-briefs, a 
crown prosecutor with the prospect of a “bumper” in every 
Jail, a sanguine junior confiding in the promise of the defence 
in a heavy murder case or two to bring him forward—the 
spirits of these may be as brisk, and their eyes shine as bright, 
as ever; but, for the most part, the presentiment of useless ex- 
pense, and discomfort in a thousand forms, predominates. The 
travelling arrangements are made with a heavy heart; the 
accustomed number of law-books, each carefully lapped up in” 
its cireuit-binding, and never perhaps to be opened till its re- 
turn, are transferred with a sigh from the ‘shelf to the portman- 
teau; and the morning of departure from the metropolis, no: 
matter how gay the sunshine or refreshing the breeze, is to 
many—to more than will dare confess it—the most melancholy 
of the year. 
It certainly requires some stoutness of sensibility to face the 
south of Ireland. I have often heard the metropolis described 
as an effort of Irish ostentation. The truth of this bursts upon 
you at every step as you advance into the interior. With’ the 
exception of the roads, the best perhaps in- Europe, the gen- 
eral aspect of the country proclaims that civilization and hap- 
piness are sadly in arrear. Here and there the eye may find 
a momentary relief in the commodious mansion and tasteful 
demesne of some opulent proprictor; but the rest of the scene 
is dismal and ‘dispiriting. To those accustomed to English 
objects, the most fertile tracts look bare and barren. It is the 
country, but it has nothing rural about it: no luxuriant hedge- 
‘rows, no shaded pathways, no cottages announcing by the 
who hed nine thousand guinens, or $46,800, for going out of his circuit to 
plead in some great property cause. His brief (so called, like lugus a non lu- 
cendo, because of the prolixity of such documents) extended to over two thou- 
sand pages. From one to five hundréd pounds sterling is the usual amount of 
a special” fee.— A record-brief means ‘a brief in a civil suit, and takes its 
name from the action being entered or placed on record in the minutes of the 
Court, before it can be tried. —M.

neatness without, that cleanliness and comfort are to be found 
within; but one undiversified continuity: of cheerless stone- 
fences’ and roadside hovels, with their typhus-beds piled up in 
front, and volumes of murky smoke forth issuing from the inte- 
rior, where men and women, pigs* and children, are enjoying 
the blessings of our glorious constitution. 
T travelled in a public conveyance. We were four inside— 
myself, a barrister, an.attornéy,t and a middle-aged, low-spir- 
ited Connaught gentleman, whom at first, from his despondency, 
I took to be a recent insvlvent, but he turned out to be only 
the defendant in an impending ejectment-case, which had al- 
ready been three times decided in his favor. The roof of the 
coach was covered (besides other luggage) with- attorneys’ 
clerks, policemen, witnesses, reporters, &c., -&c., all more or 
less put in motion by the periodical transfer of litigation from 
town to country. Before our first breakfast was concluded, I 
had known the names and- destination of almost all of them, 
and from themselves; for it is a trait of Irish character to be 
on singularly confidential terms with the public. This is some- 
times troublesome, for they expect a return in kind; but it is 
often amusing, and anything is better than the deadly tacitur- 
nity of an English traveller. How often have I been whisked

+ In England, during the seventy or eighty years immediately antecedent to 
railwayism, and formerly in Ireland, the etiquette of the bar prohibited a bar-* 
rister from sharing @ post-chaise with an attomey. The principle involved was 
that he who had briefs to receive should not be on familiar terms with him who 
had them to give— such being the relative positions of the respective “ limbs 
of the law” in question. When a barrister was intimate with an attorney, he 
became liable to the imputation of playing at hugger-mugger, or cherishing him 
for interested purposes. At one time it was considered scarcely correct for a 
barrister to dine with an attomey—altogether a practitioner of a lower but 
very money-making class. All'this has passed away. As for travelling, the 
rule which allowed barrister and attorney to go together in a mail or stage 
coach, because thet was not necessarily ¢é¢e-d-téte, as necessarily would be in a 
“post-chaise which carried only two persons, extends to railway-carriages, in 
which all members of the profession, including the Judges themselves, are un- 
avoidebly mingled.—M.

way, with no return to any overture of sociality but defensive

There is no stout-gentleman-like mystery upon the Trish 
roads. The well-dressed young man, for example, who sits 
beside you at the public. breakfast-table, after troubling you 
for the sugar-bowl, and observing that the eggs are musty, will 
proceed, without further introduction, to tell you, “how his’ 
father, a magistrate of the county, lives within three miles and 
ahalf of the Cove of Cork,* and what fine shooting there is upon 
his father’s estate, and what a fine double-barrelled gun he (the 
son) has, and how he has been up to Dublin to attend his col- 
lege examinations, and how he is now on his way down again 
to be ready for the grouse’—to the dapper, pimpled- faced

tion. Among the outside passengers there were two that sat 
and breakfasted apart (though there was no want of space at 
the public table) in a recess, or rather a kind’ of inner room. 
One of them, a robust, decent-looking man, if alone, would 
shave excited no particular observation; but the appearance 
and deportment of his companion, and a strange sort of impres-_ 
sion which I could perceive that his presence occasioned, ar- 
rested my‘attention. He was about thirty years of age; hada 
long, sunken, sallow visage, with vulgar features; coarse, 
bushy, neglected black hair; shaggy, overhanging brows; and 
a dark, deep-seated, sulky, ferocious eye. But though his as-

blue coat and trowsers, 4 showy. waistcoat, Wellington boots,” 
and a gaudy-colored silk neckcloth.t Little or no conversation 
passed between him and his companion, who never separated 
from him, and seemed -assiduous in his care that the best fare 
the inn afforded should: be placed before him. He, however, 
seemed untouched by the attentions bestowed upon him, either 
rejecting them grufily, or accepting them with a hardened, 
thankless air. His manner was altogether so extraordinary, 
and the contrast between his haggard, forbidding countenance 
and his respectable attire so striking, that my curiosity was 
not a little raised, more especially. as I dould see that seyeral 
of the compahy eyed him with suspicion and dislike, while the 
waiters approached him with signs of aversion which they took 
no trouble to conceal, Their meal being concluded, his com- 
panion, after paying the bill for both, motioned to him, with a 
certain air. of command, to rise and follow him. He obeyed, 
and retired’ in the same sullen, apathetic manner that had 
marked the rest of his demeanor. From these appearances, 
my first conjecture was that this must be some unfortunate per- 
son of imperfect understanding, who was travelling under the 
care of a keeper. 
- Upon resuming my place in the coach, I inquired who he 
was from one of my fellow-passengers (the barrister), and was 
undeceived. He was an informer, or, more technically speak- 
ing, an approver, one of a party who a year before had perpe-

trated the murder of an entire family in the south. He had 
lately been taken, had turned king’s evidence, made confes- 
sions which led to the apprehension of his. accomplices, and 
: was now proceeding, under charge of a policeman, to be a wit- 
~ ness for the crown upon their trial.” This information explained 
only a part of what I had seen. I observed that I still could 
not comprehend why such a miscreant should appear in ‘so 
respectable a dress, and be treated in other respects with a 
degree of indulgence, to which another.in his condition of life 
(for he was of the lowest class), though unstained by any 
‘erime, could have no pretension. The barrister made answer: 
« This is often indispensable for the purposes of justice, for it 
is difficult to imagine how unmanageable these riffians some- 
times are. They know the importance of the testimony they 
have to give, and which they alone can give, and in_conse- 
quence become capricious and exacting in the extreme. Though 
in the hands of government, and with the evidence of their 
own admissions to convict them, they take a perverted pleas- 
ure in exercising a kind of petty tyranny over the civil authori- 
ties. They insist on having clothes, food, lodging, modes of 
conveyance according to their particular whims; and, if their 
impertinent demands be resisted, threaten to withhold their 
evidence and submit to be hanged. One starts at the singu- 
larity of a man’s saying, ‘Let me have a smart uew blue coat, 
with double-gilt buttons, or a halter—a pair of Wellington 
boots, or the hangman!’ but our desperate villains do these 
things, dnd. the person in question T can perceive is one of 
them.” 
The subject thus started led to a conversation upon Irish 
courts of justice. Iwas in luck; for my fellow-traveller teemed 
with anecdotes, which he related with native fluency and 
point, touching judges, juries, counsel, witnesses, criminals, 
hangmen, and aught else that appertained to Irish law. He

Lord Yelverton, Baron Avonmore. In December, 1800, he was created Vis- 
cougt Avonmore, gaining this step in the peerage by voting for the Union—a 
vote which he regretted only once, and that was to his dying day. Witty him- 
self, he was the cause of wit in others; He was sometimes very absent in 
mind. On one of these occasions, at dinner, when the common toast of Our 
absent friends was given, while Avonmore was in @ reverie, Curran informed 
him that hie Hpelth had just been drank. ‘The-unsuspecting judge started up, 
and, after a ey eloquent speech in acknowledgment, learned how he had been 
hoaxed. Of all his forensic speeches, said to have been very good, only a brief 
fragment exists—the two sentences in which he happily described what Black- 
stone hed done for the laws of England by his Commentaries. “He it was,” 
said he, “who first gave to the law the air of science. He found it a skeleton, 
and he clothed it with life, color, and éomplexion; he embraced the cold 
statue, and by his touch it grew into youth, and health, and beauty.” Almost 
as brief is what has been left to us of his parliamentary eloquence, which was 
great. Fitzgibbon, afterward Lord Clare, had attacked the illustrious Grattan 
in his absence. Barry Yelverton defendad his friend, and concluded by saying, 
{The learned gentleman has stated what Mr. Grattan is: I will state what _ 
he is not. He is not styed in his prejudices; he does not tramiple on the resus- 
citation of his country, or live, like a caterpillar, on the decline of her prosper- 
ity; he doesnot stickle for the letter of the Constitution with the affectation of a 
prude, and abandon its principles with the effrontery of @ prostitute.” Sir 
Jonah Barrington has given the best sketch of Barry Yelverton. There are 
many stories afloat as. to his suffering great poverty in his early manhood, 
and, as a proof, his “pathetically saying to his mother, “Oh, I wish I

of each -cireuit travelled on horseback, and for safety and 
pleasure kept together on the road. The holsters in front of 
the saddles—the outside-coat strapped in a roll behind ——the 
dragoon-like regularity of pace at which they advanced, gave 
the party a certdin militant appearance. An equal number of 
servants followed, mounted like their masters, and watchful 
of the saddle-bags, coutaining the circuit wardrobe, and cirenit 
library that dangled from their horses’ flanks. A posse of 
pedestrian suttlers bearing wine and groceries, and such other 
luxuries as might not be found upon the road, brought up the 
rear. Thus the legal caravan pushed along; and a survivor 
of that period assures me that it was a goodly sight; and great 
was the deference and admiration with which they were 
honored at every stage; and when they approached the assize 
town, the gentlemen of the grand-jury were wont to come out 
in a body to bid them welcome. And ‘when they met, the 
greetings, and congratulations, and friendly reciprocities, were 
conducted on both sides in a tone of cordial vociferation that

laughed in a hearty roar, and loved to feel good claret dis- 
porting through his veins, and would any day prefer a fox- 
chase to a special retainer; and all this in no way detracted 
from his professional repute, seeing that all his competitors 
were even as he was, and that juries in these times were more 
gullible than now, and judges less learned and inflexible, and 
technicalities less regarded or understood; and motions in

cuit mess was honored with the company of Lord Brougham, long one of their 
most distinguished members, who had become Lord Chancellor of England,

‘pisiness was @ recreation to him; and each day through the

asked, he would discourse gravely and pithily of public affairs, 
being deeply versed in state-concerns, and, peradventure, a 
member of the Commons’ house of parliament; and when he.

* It may be necessary to state that, “across the water,” the barrister or 
counsellor is of a rank superior to the attorney (without whom he could ‘not 
earn e shilling), and has a different line of business. To become a barrister it 
is only necessary for a gentleman to enter his name on the books of one of the 
Inns of Court; to pay entrance-money-and fees, amounting to about one hundred 
and twenty pounds sterling; to eat twelve law-dinuers in the year, during four 
’ years; to appear before the Benchers (eminent barristers of long standing). and 
read a few lines of a thesis on some point of law, which document can be pur- 
chased for a few shillings; and, having passed through this ordeal, facetionsly 
termed “an examination,” then to be admitted to the rank of an utter or outer 
-borrister (because none but Queen’s Counsel, Sergeants-at-Law, or bacristers ~~ 
with patents of precedency, can’ sit within the bar in the Law Courts), and. be 
“called to the bar,” by having his name shouted out, at dinner, calling him 
from the students’ to the upper or barristers’ table, It will be seen, from this, 
that as the barrister receives no instruction during his four years of pupilage, it 
extirely rests with himself whether and in what manner he shall obtain a knowl- 
edge of the law. ‘This is to be done by study, by attendance at the chambers 
of some eminent pleader(to whom he usually pays one hundred pounds sterling), 
* and by noticing the practice of the law during his attendance in the courts. 
On the other hand, you must be regularly apprenticed to an attorney for five 
years, and, when your time is served, pass through a very strict examination 
—in law and its practice before you are admitted as an attorney. In no case can 
a client do business, directly, with the barrister, who can only be approached, 
professionally, by the attorney, It is precisgly as if a man being ill, the physi-

Dublin mail, with the pomp and cixcumstance that marked the

going barrister of the present day, though no longer so promi- 
nent an object of popular observance, is by’no means considered 
as an ordinary person. ‘The very title of Counsellor continues 
to- maintain its major influence over the imaginations of the 
populace. When he comes to be known among them, land- 
lords, waiters, guards, and coachmen, bow to him as low, and 
are as alert in service, as if he weré a permanent grand-jury-

still in his juniority) the country-belles receive him with their 
choicest smirks, while the most- influential country-gentlemen

jackal to the barrister; but an attorney in good practice, who has many law- 
suits to carry on, has it in his power to help a clever young barrister, by em- 
ploying him as junior counsel in such suits— there ordinarily being at least two 
barristers-on each side in every civil or Nisi Prius trial. The attorney “ geta 
up the case” —prepares the brief or statement of facts and evidence, with refer- 
enées to points of law, and previous decisions of the Courts also—fixes the 
amount of fees to courtsel, and pays the money on delivery of the brief; there 
being the anomaly that, while the barrister's fee ig not recoverable by law, the 
attorney’s bilis of costs are, and their amount is fixed by rules of Court, and

four years’ delay, as above mentioned, he may be called to the bar. Should it 
be discovered that a barrister has professionally acted without being “‘in- 
‘structed” by an attorney, or that he hasan understanding to the effect of shar- 
. fag profits with an attorney, he would be disbarred— that is, turned out of the

-, 80 . : AN IRISH CIRCUIT. 
<The most: striking scenes upon an Irish circuit are to be 
found in the-criminal courts. The general aspect of the in- 
terior;-and the forms of proceeding, have nothing peculiar; 
but scarcely @ case occurs that does not elicit some vivid 
exhibition of national character, or afford matter of serious 
-. reflection upon the moral and political condition of the country. 
I would add, that the very absence of such reflection on the 
part of the spectators, is itself an observable phenomenon: for 
instance, the first morning that I entered the Crown Court at 
» I perceived the witness- table covered by a group of” 
mountain-peasantry, who turned out to. be three generations. 
of one family, grandfather, father, and three or four athletic 
sons. Their appearance, though decent, was wild and pictur-— 
esque.. They were all habited in a complete suite of coarse 
blue frieze. The eldest of the party sustained himself upon a 
Jong oaken staff, which gave to him a certain pastoral air, 
while each of the others, down to the youngest, a fine, fierce, 
black-haired, savage-eyed lad of seventeen, was armed with a   
‘ _ formidable club of the same favorite timber. The old man 
resting upon his staff, and addressing the interpreter, was . 
meekly and deliberately explaining, in the Ivish language, for : 
the informatio of the court, the ohject of his application. It 
needed no interpreter to tell me that he was recounting a tale 
of violence and wrong. The general purport, as he proceeded, 
" was intelligibly translated in the kindling looks, the vehement 
gesticulation—and, where any circumstance was omitted or 
understated—the impassioned and simultaneous corrections 
of the group behind him. Though he more than once turned 
round to rebuke their impetuosity, it was easy to perceive that. 
his own-tranquillity of manner was the result of effort; bat the 
others, and least of all the younger portion of the party, could 
not submit to restrain their emotions. The present expeyi- 
ment of appealing to the laws was evidently new to them, and 
unpalatable. As they east their quick suspicious glances. 
round them, and angrily gave their cudgels a spasmodic clench, 
they looked less like suitors in a court of justice, than as an 
armed deputation from a barbarous tribe, reluctantly appearing 
in a civilized enemy’s camp with proposals for a cessation of
-P-A-G-E-32
OOCUPANTS OF THE DOCK. 31 
hostilities; And there was some such sacrifice of warlike ‘in- 
stinets.in the present instance. The party, for once listening 
to pacific counsel, had come down from their hills to seek com- 
' pensation from the county for the loss of their house and stock, 
which. had been maliciously burned down—they suspected, 
but had no proof—by “their dld enemies the O’Sullivans.” 
Yet the details of their case, embracing midnight conflagration, 
imminent risk of life, destruction of property, produced, so 
familiar are such outrages, not the slightest. sensation in a 
crowded court. Some necessary forms being gone through, — 
they were dismissed, with directions to appear before the grand 
jury; and I. do not forget that, as they were retiring, the 
youngest of the party uttered a vehement exclamation, in his 
native tongue, importing—“That if the grand-jury refused 
them justice, every farthing of their loss should (come of it 
what would) be punctually paid down to them in the blood of 
the O’Sullivans.” 
The dock of an Irigh county-court is quite a study. From 
the character of the crimes to be tried, as appearing on the 
calendar, I expected to find there a collection of the most 
villanous faces in the: community: it was the very reverse. 
I would even say that, as a general ‘rule, the weightier the 
charge, the better the physiognomy, and more prepossessing 
the appearance of the accused. An ignoble misdemeanant, or 
sneaking petty-larcenist, may look his offence pretty accu- 
rately; but let the charge amount to a good transportable or ° 
capital felony, and ten to one but-the prisoner will exhibit a 
set of features from which a committee of craniologists would 
-never infer a propensity to crime. In fact, an Irish dock, 
especially after a brisk insmrrectionary winter, affords some of 
the choicest samples of the peasantry of the country—fine, 
hardy, healthy, muscular looking beings, with rather a dash of 
riot about the eye, perhaps, but with honest, open, manly coun- 
tenances, and sustaining themselves with native courage amid 
the dangers that beset them; and many of them are in fact 
either as guiltless as they appear, or their crimes have been 
committed under circumstances of excitation, which, in their 
own eyes at least, excuse the enormity. With’ regard to the
-P-A-G-E-33

former, there are one or two national peculiarities, and not of — 
a very creditable kind, which account for their numbers. 
’ The lower orders of the Irish, when their passions are once 
up on the right side, are proverbially brave, disinterested, and 
faithfal; but reverse the object, give them a personal enemy 
to circumvent, or an animosity of their faction to gratify, 
and all the romantic generosity of their character vanishes. 
As partisans, they have no more idea of “fair play,” than . 
a belligerent Indian of North America. In the prosecution 
of their interminable feds, if. they undertake to redress 
“themselves, armed members will beset a single defenceless 
foe, and crush him without reniorse; and in the same spirit 
“of reckless vengeance, when they appeal to the law, they do - 
not hesitate to include in one sweeping accusation, every friend 
or relative of the alleged offender, whose evidence might ‘be 
of -any avail upon his defence; and hence, for the real ‘or 
imputed crime of one, whole families, men and women, and 
sometimes even children, are committed to prison, and made 
to-pass through the ordeal of a public trial. Another prolific 
-source of these wanton committals is a practice, pretty ancient 
in its origin,-but latterly very much on the increase, of at- 
tempting to succeed on a guestion of civil right by the aid of a 
criminal prosecution. T'lus the legality of a distress for rent 
will-come on to be tried for the first time under the form of ‘a 
charge for cow-stealing, dr the regularity of a “ notice to quit,” 
upon an indictment for a forcible and felonious dispossession.*

the immediate and consequential evils are so great—for revenge in some law- 
less form.or other is sure to follow—that the government of the country ought 
to interfere. The judges, when such cases come before them, never fail to ex~ 
press their indignation, and to warn the magistracy to be more cautious in 
granting committals without thoroughly sifting the truth of the depositions upon | 
which they are grounded; but the guilty party, the malicious prosecutor, és- 
capes unpunished. His crime is wilful perjury—but this is an offence against 
which, by a kind, of general consent ir Ireland, the laws are seldom or never

But even. omitting these exceptions, I should say from my own 
; observations that an Irish jail is, for the most, part, delivered* 
of remarkably. fine children, particularly “thé boys,” though 
from the numbers at a single birth, it would be too much to 
expect that they all should be found « doing. well.” In many 
the vital question is quickly decided, while in others, and it is 
for these that one’s interest is most raised, the chances of life 
and death: appear so nicely balanced, that the most. experi- 
enced observer can only. watch the-symptoms, without ventur- 
ing to prognosticate the issue. Such, to give an apposite ex- 
ample, was.the memorable instance of Larry Cronan. 
Larry .Cronan: was a.stout, hardy, Trish lad, of five-and- 
twenty. Like Saint Patrick, “he came of dacent people.”t 
He was-afive-pound freeholder—paid his rent punctually — 
voted for shis landlord, and against his conscience — seldom 
missed a mass,.a fair, a wake, or,a.row—hatéd, and occasion- 
ally cudgelled the ,tithe-proctor —loved his neighbor —had a 
vigorous prosecution, some check might be givem to what is now 9 monstrous 
and increasing mischief. The experiment, 1 understand, was made some time 
ago at Cork, and, though only in a single instance, with a very salutary effect. 
On the first day of the assizea, a by-stander, seeing a dock friend in danger, 
jumped upon the table to give him “ the loan of an oath.” His testimony turn- 
ing out to be a tissue of the grossest perjury, the judge ordered a bill of indict- 
ment for the offence to be forthwith prepared and sent up to the grand jury. 
‘The bill was found, and in the course of the same day, the offender was tried, . 
_ convicted, sentenced to transportation, put on board a‘convict-ship then ready 
to gail, and, by day-break next morning. found himself bearing away before a 
steady breeze for Botany bay. The example had such an effect, that scarcely 
an alibi-witness was to be had for love or money during thé remainder of the 
assizes. . . . 
* The word “ delivered,” is used here in reference to the fact that, in Great 
Britain and Ireland, the judges of assize, who go on circuit, from county to 
county, are bound to make “a general jail delivery,” that is, to try every prison- 
er, in cach place, uniless the inquiry before the grand jury should ignore the bills 
of indictment, or, “a true bill”. being found, the trial, is deferred from some 
logal cause. Sometimes, of course, when the crown prosecutor declines trying 
the accused, the “ nollé prosequé” opens the prison-door, and sometimes, when 
the offehce is not very heavy the prisoner is liberated pro tem., on giving bail 
for his appearance, to be tried at the next assizes.—M: .

ite and five children, and, on thé whole, passed for one of the 
host prosperous. and well- conducted boys in his barony. All 
‘this, however, did not prevent his being “ given to understand , 
by the Clerk of the Crown,” at the summer assizes for his native 
eounty, that he stood Tadieted in No. 15, for that he, on a-cer- 
“tain night, and at a certain place, feloniously and burglariously 
entered a certain dwelling-house, and then and there commit- 
ted. the. usual misdeeds against his majesty’s peace and the 
statute; and in No. 16, that he stood capitally indicted under 
the Ellenborough act ;*-and-in No. 18, for a common assault. 
I was present at his trial, and still retain a vivid recollection 
. of the fortitude and address with which he made his stand 
against the law; and yet there were objects around him quite 
‘sufficient to -unnerve. the boldest heart —a wife, a sister, and 
an aged mother, for such I found to be the three females that 
~elung to the side -bars of the dock, and awaited in silent 
agony-the issue of his fate. But the prisoner, unsoftened and 
undismayed, appeared unconscious of their -presence. Every 
faculty of his soul wag on the alert to prove to his friends and _ 
the county at large, that he was not a man to be hanged with- 
out a struggle. He had used the precaution to come down to” 
the dock that morning in his best attire, for he knew that with . 
an Irish jury, the next best thing to a general good character 
is a respectable suit of clothes. It struck me that his new 
silk ‘neckkerchief, so bright and glossy, - almost betokened. 
innocence; for who would have gone to the unnecessary ex- 
‘pense, if he apprehended that its place was so son to be sup- 
plied by the rope? His countenance bore no marks of his 
previous imprisonment.’ He was as fresh and healthy, and 
his eye as bright, as if he had all the time been out on bail. . 
‘When his case was-called on, instead of shrinking under the 
general buzz that his appearance “excited, or turning pale at 
the plurality of crimes of which he was: arraigned, he man- 
fully looked the danger in the face, and put in action every

-, off one country-gentleman from his own barony, a friend of his 
in other respects, but who owed him a halance of three pounds 
for illicit whiskey. Two or three sets of alibi witnesses, to 
watch the evidence for the crowh, and lay the venue of his 
absence from. the felony according to circumstances, were in 
waiting; and, what-was*equally material, all tolefably. sober. 
The most: formidable witness for the prosecution had been ~ - 
that morning bought off. The consideration was, a first cousin 
of Larry’s in-marriage, a forty-shilling freehold upon Larry's 
farm, with a pig and a plough to set the young couple going. 
Thus prepared, and his, coungel now arrived, and the bustle 
of his final instructions to his attorney and circumstanding 
friends being over, the prisoner calmly committed the rest to 
fortune; resembling in this particular the intrepid mariner, 
who, perceiving a storm at hand, is all energy and alertness 
to provide against its fury, until, having done all that skill and 
forethought can effect, and made his vessel as “snug and 
tight” as the, occasion will permit, he looks tranquilly on as 
she drifts before the gale, assured that her final safety is now 
in other hands than his. 
* Mr. O’Connell’s success, with j juries, whether in criminal or nisi prius cases, 
was very great. He went the Munster circuit (which included the southern 
counties of lreland—Clare, Limerick, Kerry, Cork, and Waterford), and almost 
invariably held a brief for the defence in all criminal prosecutions. His busi- 
ness on circuit was so great,that, except in very important cases, he could not 
read the prisoners’ briefs. But the attorney for the defence used. to condense 
the leading facts and set them down on a single sheet of foolscap, and O’Con- 
nell usually found time to peruse and master them, during the apeech of the: 
crown counsel for the prosecution, relying on his own skill in the cross-exami- 
‘nation of witnesses and his pewer with the jury. Like Belial, he “ could make

From some of the witnesses he extracted that they were 
unworthy of all credit, being notorious knaves or process- 
servers. - Others he inveigled into a metaphysical puzzle 
touching ‘the prisoner’s identity ; others he stunned by re-. 
peated blows with tlie butt-end of an Irish joke. For minutes 
together; the court, and jury, and galleries, and dock, were in 
aroar. However the law or the facts of the case might turn 
” out; it was clear that the laugh, at least, was all on Larry’s 
. side. In this perilous conjuncture, amid all the rapid alter= 
nations of his case —now the prospect of a triumphant return 
to his home and friends, now the sweet vision abruptly dis-- 
pelled, and the gibbet and:executioner staring him in the face 
-—Larry’s countenance exhibited a picture of heroical immo-.- 
bility. Once, and once only, when the evidence was rushing 
in a full tide against him, some signs of mortal trepidation 
overcast his visage. ‘The blood in his cheeks took fright and 
fled—a cold. perspiration burst from his brow. His lips be- 
came glued together. His sister, whose eyes were riveted 
upon him, as she hung from the dock-side, extended her arm, 
and applied a piece of orange to his mouth. He accepted. the 
relief, but, like an exhausted patient, without turning aside 
to see by whose hand it was administered. At this crisis 
of his courage, a home-thrust from O’Connell floored the wit- 
ness who had so discomposed his client; the public buzzed 
their admiration, and Larry was himself again. The casé for 
the crown having closed, the prisoner’s counsel announced 
that he would call no witnesses. -Larry’s friends pressed hard 
to have one, at least, of the’alibis proved. The counsel was 
inflexible, and they reluctantly Submitted.

and hurried away in triumph to the precincts of the court. I 
saw him a féw minutes after, as he was paraded through the 
main street of the ,town‘on his return to his barony. The 
sight was enough to make one almost long to have been on 
the point of being hanged. The principal figure was- Larry 
himself, advancing with a firm and buoyant step, and occa- 
sionally giving a responsive flourish of his cudgel, which he 
had already resumed, to the cheerings and congratulations 
amid whicli he moved along. At his sides weré his wife and 
sister, each of whom held the collar of his coat firmly grasped, 
and, dragging him. to and fro, interrupted his progress every 
moment, as . they threw, themselves upon him, and gave vent to 
their joy in another and another convulsive hug. A few 
yards in front, his old mother bustled along in‘a strange sort 
of a pace, between a trot and a canter, and every now and 
then, discovering that she had shot too far ahead, pirouetted 
round, and stood in the centre of the street, clapping her 
withered hands and shouting out her ecstasy in native Irish, 
_ until the group came up, and again propelled her forward. A 
cavalcade of neighbors, and among them the intended alibi 
witnesses, talking as loud and looking as important as if their 
perjury had been. put to the test, brought up the rear. And 
such was the manner and form in which Larry Cronan was 
reconducted to hig household gods, who saw him that night 
celebrating, in the best of whiskey and bacon, the splendid 
issue of his morning’s pitched battle with the law.*

jurisdiction of the Court, the offence, committed “on the high seas,” . being 
cognizable only before an Admiralty Court. When the man saw his successful 
counsel turn round to the dock, in which he stood, he stretched over to him,

mand of these leaders were generally called ‘* Whiteboys,” from their common 
practice of wearing white shirts over their usual garments during their noctur- 
nal excursions. Thomas Moore, who has apostrophized him as “the genius of 
Riot,” wrote the Memoirs of Captain Rock, in which, with more truth than 
poetry, he thus briefly stated the causes of Irish discontent :-— .

‘peremptory toward the object of his adoration. And yet among, 
all the various cases that are tried at an Irish assizes; those in 
which “ladies.are recommended to leave the court” are.per- 
haps the most perplexing to a judge and jury.* If, on the one 
hand, the Hibernian lover be often hasty and irregular in his 
style of courtship; on the other, the beauties of the bogs (let 
Mr. O'Connell. deny it as he will) are sometimes frail: and, 
_ besides, the charge is in itself so easily made, and so difficult 
to refute—still it may in any given case be true; and the wit- 
nesses depose to their wrongs in such heart-rending accents, 
and weep, and sigh, and faint away, 80 naturally —but then 
so many instances occur in which all’this turns out to be im- 
posture ; and the complainant has always so many motives to 
swear to her own purity through thick and thin, and the bound- 
ary between importunacy and felony is so undefinable, and she 
is in general so ready to consent, that, after all, the affair shall . 
terminate, like a modern comedy, in a marriage, for in nine 
cases out of tén it is almost impossible to divine whether the 
réal object of the prosecutrix is the prisoner's life, or his band

for words in which to wrap up the necessary grossness of the details, “ Broth-

somewhat awaggering air of a man determined not to be bullied 
by a capital prosecution into a match against his taste. It is 
in vain that the proseentrix apprizes him, by her softened and 
half-forgiving glances, and her tender reluctance to swear too 
hard at first, that if he says but the word she is ready “to 
drop the business,” and fly into his arms., In vain his friends 
and hers endeavor to impress upon him the vast difference in 
point of comfort and respectability between life with a wife 
and home, and the premature abridgment of his days upon a 
gibbet. “No; his mind is made up, and he’ll run all chances; 
and if she only tells the whole matter just as it happened, and 
might happeri to anybody, not a hair of his head has cause to 
be afear’d.” This lasts for a time; but as the case in its prog- 
ress begins to wear a serious aspect, and the countenance of 
his attorney to assume along with it a disastrous gravity, won- 
drous is the revolution of sentiment that is gradually but rap- 
idly produced, She, upon whom a little while ago he frowned 
in scorn, on a sudden begins to find favor in his sight. With 
every step that her gentle hand conducts him toward his doom, 
he becomes more conjugally inclined. The more the thicken- 
ing danger compels him to reconsider his. determination, the 
more clearly he sees that after all it will be better to receive 
his “death from her eyes” than from her tongue; until at 
length, being fairly led to the foot of the gallows, with the rope, 
in such cases the most potent of love-chains, fast about his neck, 
he announces himself the repentant lover, tenders the amende 
honorable, and ig transferred with all convenient speed from the 
impending gripe of the hangman to the nuptial clasp of a young 
‘and blooming bride. Such matches can hardly be:said to be 
“made in heaven ;” yet I have never heard that they tum out 
Jess prosperously than others. The wife is all gratitude and 
pride for having been “made an honest woman ;” the husband 
is usually bound over at the time of the marriage’to keep the 
peace toward the mistress of his soul; and, with these collat- 
eral securities for domestic bliss, they generally contrive to 
live on, and defy Mr. Malthus, with as much harmony as if-

'_.,{Ehese are things to smile at} but exhibitions of a far diffe. 
aracter occasionally occur—not, as already stated, moré 
ently than elsewhere, but when they do. appear, presenit- 
g instances of deep aboriginal depravity, for whicli no politi- 
cal or social palliation can be found. Nor is it exclusively - 
from among the refuse-of the community that’ such examples 
“may be taken. Of this I have before me a remarkable illus- 
tration in the details of a case that happened a few years ago, ~ 
and which,.in-addition to the singularity of the incidents, has 
thet novelty | of being now. for the .first time presented in a 
_printed form to the public.* - 
The .xiver Shannon, in its passage westward toward ‘the : 
‘Ktlantie, expands, about forty miles below the city of Lim- -. 
erick, into a capacious sheet of water resembling an estiary; 
and making a distance of ten or twelve miles from bank ‘to 
bank. At the northern, or county of Clare side, is the town 
of Kilrush. Upon the opposite shore, adjoining the borders’ 
of the counties of Limerick and Kerry, is the town ‘of Tarbert; 
‘and a few miles higher up the stream the now inconsiderable 
village of Glyn—the same from which a branch of the Fitz- 
geralds originally took their ancient and still-honored title of 
_ “Knights of Glyn.” None of these places make any kind of 
show upon the banks, which besides are pretty thickly planted 
almost down to the water’s. edge. The river itself in this part    
   
  question is full of difficulty; but all things considered, it would probably be 
more salutary, to let the law in every instance take its course. If an indul- 
gence, which originated in humanity, often saves a court and jury from a dis- 
tressing duty, it, on the other hand, has a tendency to encourage interested 
prosecutions and also to render the actual commission of the'crime more fre- 
quent, by holding out to offenders the possibility of such a means of escape in 
the-last resort. [At present, and for many years past, a prosecution for abduc- 
tion once brought before a. jury is not allowed to be stopped—except for want 
of evidence... The-result is that the offence-has scarcely been heard of latter- 
ly.—M.]

touching in their naked simplicity, the late Gerald Griffin, himself a “ Limer-

* presents few signs of human intereourse. In the finest summer 
weather the eye may often look round and search in vain for 
a single bank or boat to break the solitude of the scene. The 
‘general desolation is in fact at times so complete, that were 
an adept in crime to be in quest of a place where a deed 
of violence might be perpetrated underthe eye of God alone, 
he could not select a fitter scene than the channel of the river 
Shannon, midway between the points Lhave just described. 
One morning, a little after sunrise, about the latter end of 
July, in the year 1819, two poor fishermen, named Patrick - 
Connell and .... Driscol, who lived at Money-Point, a small 
hamlet near Kilrush, went.down to the river-side, according to 
their custoni, to attend: to their occupation. -As they walked 
along the strand in the direction of their boat, they came upon 
a human body which had been washed ashore by the last tide. 
It was the remains of a young female, and had no clothing or 
covering of any kind excepting a small bodice. Who or what 
she had been they could not.conjecture, but how she came by 
her death was manifest. They found a rope tied at one end 
as tightly as possible round the neck, and at the other present- 
ing a large loop, to which they supposed that a stone or some 
other weight had been attached, until the working of’ the 
stream had caused it to separate. From the general state of 
the body, and more particularly from the teeth having almost 
all dropped out, they concluded that it must have been under 
the water for several weeks. After a-short consultation, the 
- two fishermen resolved upon proceeding without delay to Kil- 
rush, to apprize the civil authorities of the circumstance; but 
in the meantime they could not bear to think of leaving the - 
vemains exposed as they had found them on the shore, and 
liable to be borne away again by the tide before they could 
‘yeturn. They accordingly removed the body to a little dis- 
tance beyond high-water mark, and gave it a temporary inter- 
ment. ‘The feelings with which they performed this office were 
marked by that tender and reverential regard toward the dead 
which distinguishes the Irish peasantry. Upon the subsequent 
investigations, it became of importance to ascertain whether 
the burial had been conducted in such a manner as not to have

occasioned any additional injury or disfigurement to the: “Os 
mains; and Patrick Connell being asked the question, replied 
in a tone of voice so pathetic as to bring a tear into every éye: 
“No,” said the poor fellow, raising both his hands, and attempt- 
ing to convey by their movements the gentleness that had ‘been 
used, “it was impossible for anything we did to injure or dis- 
figure her, for we laid her up neatly in sea-weeds,” and then - 
covered her all round softly with the sand, so that’ nothing 
could harm her.” 
- The magistrates of the neighborhood having ascertained 
from the report of the fishermen that a dreadful erime had béen 
committed, set immediate inquiries on foot for the diseovery of 
the offender. The task could not have devolved upon-a more 
competent class of men, Whatever other failings may have 
been imputed to the Irish country-gentlemen, indifference or’ 
inexpertness in the detection of criminals has not been anidng 
them. Time out of mind, the political and social anomalies 
of Ireland have kept that body continually on the alert for the 
protection of their lives and properties. To the abstract prin- 
ciple of public duty and general love of justice, has-been super- 
added the more pressing stimulus of self-preservation., The 
consequence is, that their local information in all that ‘can re: 
late to the discovery of a public offender is singularly aceurate 
and extensive; and equally remarkable are their skill and ‘zeal 
in putting every resource in play for the attainment of their 
object.* The exertions of the magistrates in the’ present in- 
stance were 80 successful, that a considerable mass of circum- 
* Liberal pecuniary rewards for prosecuting to conviction, are among the 
namber; but experience has shown that in such a country as Treland, this may 
be a very dangerous expedient. A striking instance occurred a few years ago. 
A young gentleman, the son of an unpopular English agent, was barbarously 
murdered. The reward offered, amounted to some hundreds of pounds. For 
some time no evidence was tendered; at length a boy, about thirteen years of 
age, and «whose parents were in the most indigent circumstances, presented _ 
himeelf and stated that he had witnessed the murder from a concealed position . 
bebind a hedge, and that he could identify one of the persons, engaged in ‘it 
by a particular mark on one of his cheeks. “From the description, suspicion 
lighted upon a particular man, who was accordingly apprehended, and being 
shown to the boy, was pronounced by him to be the very person. Qn the trial,

stantial evidence was-in readiness for the coroner’s jury, that 
was. siimmoned to inquire into the identity of the deceased and 
the cause of her death.- The details were voluminous, and I 
shall therefore select only the. most striking and material. . 
‘The: most important and ample information was communi- 
cated by a young woman named Eller Walsh. A few weeks 
before the finding of the remains, this person’being at. Kilrush, 
went down: to. the river-side in search of a passage: across to 
Glyn, where she resided.in service with a lady. ‘It was then 
approaching ‘sunset. Upon arriving at the share, she found a 
small pleasure-boat on the point of putting off for Tarbert. 
Six persons were in the boat, a Mr. S——, a young. woman 
who was: addressed as Mrs. S—--, Stephen Sullivan, Mr. 
8. ’g servant, and three boatmen of the town of Kilrush. 
There was also on board a. trunk belonging to Mrs. S. 
‘The only one of the party of whom Ellen Walsh had any pre- 
vious knowledge was Sullivan, whose native place was Glyn; 
and, upon addressing herself to him for a passage across, she 
Was permitted to enter the boat. They immediately. got under 
weigh, expecting to reach Tarbert before dark ;. but before 
they had proceeded any distance on their way across, they 
discovered that this was impracticable. In addition to an ad- 
verse tide, it came on to blow so hard ‘against them that the 
boat made little or no way, so that they were kept: out upon 
the water, the whole of the night. .Toward morning a heavy 
shower of rain fell, but, the wind having moderated, the rowers 
sticceeded in reaching a small place. below Tarbert, called 
Carrickafoyle. Here the party landed.as the day began to 
dawn, and, taking the trunk along with them, proceeded to a 
small public-house in the village, to dry themselves and ob- 
tain refreshment. After breakfast, the boatmen, who had 
been hired for the single occasion of rowing the boat -across 
the river, were dismissed and returned toward their homes.   
  
and sustained the erdeal of a cross-examination so successfully, that the most 
incredulous could scarcely question his veracity. The prisoner, however, waa 
fortunately able to prove an alibi, and escaped. A few months after, the real 
criminal, who had a mark on one of his cheeks, was apprehended, tried, and 
convicted upon evidence:beyond all imputation.

The boat, which (it afterward appeared) had been paren’. . 
- wfew days before by Mr. s—, remained. Shortly ‘after: thé 
and Sullivan went dt: 
‘(they said to search for change of a note), and were ‘abseut 
about an hour, leaving Mrs. S—— and Ellen Walsh togei 
in the public-house. And here it was that some particu 
observed by the latter, when subsequently recalled to her '¥ 
ollection and disclosed, became of vital moment as maton 
circumstantial evidence. : 
It has been already stated, that the body found by’ re 
fishermen, was without any covering save a small bodice 
that no direct evidence of identity could be established 
ascertaining what particular dress Mrs. S. wore; bit indi: 
rectly, a knowledge of this fact (as will appear in the sequelft 
became of the first importance. Upon this subject ‘Elle 
Walsh was able-to give some minute and: accurate ‘info c 
mation. She had forgotten the color of the gown Mrs. se 
wore when they landed at Carrickafoyle, but she well renietti- 
bered that she hadon a gray cloth mantle lined with light bi 
silk, and with welts of a particular fashion in the skirts. “She 
also wore a pink-eolored silk handkerchief round her neck, . 
and had on her finger two gold rings—one plain, the. other 
carved. These Ellen Walsh had observed and noted before 
Mr. S——t and his servant left the public-house; but during. . 
their absence, Mrs. 8 opened the trunk, and, with the ° 
natural vanity of a young female, exhibited for her admiration 
séveral new articles of dress whieh it contained. Among 
other things, there were two trimmed spencers—one of greén, 
the other of yellow silk; two thin muslin frocks —one plain, 
the other worked ;. and a green velvet reticule trimmed with 
gold lace. : 
Upon ‘the return of Mr. S—— and Sullivan to the public- 
house, the weather having now cleared, they proposed to Mts. 
8 to go on board the boat. Ellen Walsh, understanding 
that Tarbert was their destination, desired to accompany 
them; but Sullivan, taking her aside, recommended to her to 
remain where she was until the following morning, adding (and 
this last observation was in the hearing of his master), that in

the meanfime:“ they would get rid of that girl (Mis. Bes),” 
and then return and convey her to Glyn. This Ellen ‘Wulsh 
declined, and followed the party tothe beach, entreating to be 
at least pdt across to the other side of a certain creek there, 
which would save her.a round of several miles on her way 
homeward. At first they would not consent, and put off with- 
out her; but seeing her begin to cry, Mr. S—~ and Sullivan, 
after a short consultation, put back the boat, and taking her in, 
conveyed her across the creek, and landed her about three 
miles below the town of Glyn. They then sailed away in the 
direction of the opposite shore, and ‘she proceeded home- 
ward. ’ “ ~ 
Early next morning Ellen Walsh, havitig occasion to go out: 
upon, some errand, was surprised to see Sullivan standing at 
the door of his mother's house in Glyn. She entered the house, 
and the first thing she perceived was Mrs. S——’s trank upon 
the floor. She asked if Mrs. 8 was in Glyn. Sullivan. 
replied that “she was not; that they had shipped. her off with 
the captain of an American vesse' 2 "Pwo: or three days after, 
Ellen Walsh saw upon one of Sullivan’s sisters a gray man- 
tle, which she instantly recognised as the one Mrs. S—- had 
worn at Carrickafoyle. -There was a woman at Glyn, hamed 
Grace Scanlon, with whom Mr. S$. ,-when he went there, 
was in the habit of lodging. In this person’s house Ellen 
Walsh some time after saw the silk handkerchief,-one of the 
spencers, and the two muslin frocks which Mrs, 8 had 
shown her at Carrickafoyle. (These, it appeared from other 
evidence, had been sold to Grace Scanlon by Sullivan, who. 
accounted to her for their coming into his possession, by stating 
that Mrs. S—— had run away from Kilrush with an officer, and 
left her trunk of clothes behind her.).. Finally, about a fort- 
night after the disappearance of Mrs. S. » Ellen ‘Walsh, 
going one evening into Grace Scanlon’s house, found Mr. 
8 ‘and Sullivan sitting there. The former had on one 
of his fingers a gold carved ring, precisely resembling that 
worn by Mrs. §. They both were under the influence of 
liquor, and talked much-and loud. Among other things, Sul- 
livan aéked his master for some money ; and on being’ efused,

-ebsexyed .emphatically, “« Mr. John, you know I have as good 
right to that money as you have.” 
oe Such were, in substance, the. most material facts (excepting 
one. particular, hereafter meytioned), that had fallen under 
Billen Walsh’s observation; and, upon the magtstrates being 
apprized that she had such evideuce to give, she was summon- 
ed. as a witness upon the inquest. She accordingly attended, - 
and, accompanied the coroner’s jury to the place where the 
remains had been deposited by the fishermen. The cireum- 
stances she detailed were pregnant with suspicion against Mr, 
-S—— and his servant. A young and defenceless female had - 
disappeared. Upon the last occasion of her having been 
seen, she was in their company, in an open boat on.the river 
Shannon. A declavation had been made by the servant, 
“that she was to be got rid of.” On the very next: day, her 
- trunk of clothes is seen in their possession, and, soon after, a. 
part of the dress she _wore in the boat on the ‘servant's: sister, 
and one of her rings on the master’s finger ; add to this the 
mysterious allusion to the money“ Mr. John, you know I 
have as good a right to that money as you have.” A few 
weeks. after, a body is washed ashore, near to the place. where 
this young woman had been last seen—the body of a young . 
female, who had manifestly been stripped, and murdered, and 
flung into the river, and exhibiting symptoms of decay (ac- 
cording to the report of the fishermen), that exactly tallied 
with the time of her suspected death. 
On the other hand, there were some circumstances in the case, 
as detailed by Ellen Walsh, which justified the magistrates in 
considering that a jury should pause before they pronounced 
her evidence to be conclusive. Of Sullivan they had no knowl- 
edge; but his master they knew to be a young gentleman.of 
some territorial property, of respectable parentage, and nearly 
allied by blood with more than one of the noble families of 
Treland. This naturally compelled them to entertain some 
doubts. 'Then upon the, supposition that he and his servant 
had concerted the murder of the young woman Ellen Walsh 
had seen with them, what could have been more clumsy and 
incautious than their previous and subsequent conduct? The

inferenée from her story of the transaction was; thatthe time 
and manner of executing their deadly purpose. were finklly:de- 
termined upon during their absence from the public-house at 
Oarrickafoyle. Yet the first thing they do upon their return is 
to‘inform her, without any kind of necessity fot: the commusi- 
cation, “ that they. want to get rid of that’ girl” —a-declaration 
‘consistent enough with their subsequent account of ‘her disap- 
pearance, but almost incredible if considered 48.2: bratuitous 
disclosure by persons meditating the perpetration of an atro- 
cious crime. ‘They next permit the same person (as if. deter- 
mined that she should be a future witness against: them) to see 
them bearing away their victim. to the very scene of execution; 
and, finally, they appear tlie’ next day in the town of Glyn, 
and publicly exhibit themselves: and the evidences ‘of their 
crime to the very person from whose scrutiny and observation, 
upon the supposition of their guilt, they must ‘have known they 
had’so much’ to apprehend ! - 
These conflicting views did not -escape the attention of the 
magistrates who had undertaken the investigation of this affair. 
They saw that the case would continue involved in mystery, 
unless it could be unequivocally made to appear that the young 
woman seen by Ellen Walsh and the murdered person were 
the same. -For this purpose; before they allowed the body to 
be disinterred for the inspection of the jury; they used the pre- 
caution of re-interrogating Ellen Walsh, as to every the minu- 
test particular she could recall respecting the personal appear- 
ance of. Mrs. S. -The witness stated she was extremely 
young, not more, she imagined, than fifteen or sixteen, and 
' that her figure was short ‘and slight. ‘So: far her description 
corresponded with that of the. fishermen, who were also in at- 
tendance; but this would have been too feeble and general - 
evidence of identity for a court of criminal inquiry: to act upon 
with safety. The witness farther stated that Mrs. 8. was 
remarkably handsome, and gave. the coroner’s jury a minute 
description of her face; but. no comparison of feature could 
tiow be:availing: In the remains over which the investigation °

gqually disfiguring operation of the element to which they had 
“heew exposed. At length, however, the witness distinctly re-. 
«galled to her recollection one peculiarity about Mrs. S——’s 
face, which, if she and the deceased were the same, might still 
he visible. The teeth were not perfectly regular. Two of the 
upper vow (one at each side) projected considerably. This im- 
portant clew having been obtained, the remains were disinter- 
red, and-found in the condition which the fishermen had de-. 
scribed.” The mouth was of course the first and chief object 
of minute inspection. “The teeth of the upper jaw had all . 
dropped out ; but upon a careful examination of the sockets, two. 
of the side ones were found to be of such a particular formationias 
satisfied. the jury that the teeth belonging te them must of ne- 
eessity have projected as the witness represented. Upon this 
fact, coupled with the other particulars of her testimony, they 
returned a verdict, finding that the deceased had been wilfully 
murdered by John §. and Stephen Sullivan. Warrants 
_ were immediately issued for the appreherision of the parties ac- 
. cused, neither of whom (and this was not an immaterial cireum- 
stance) had been seen in public since the finding of the remains

'The master was traced to a particular farmhouse in the coun| 
of Limerick, and followed thither by the officers of justice, 
accompanied by a party of dragoons. They searched the _ 
place ineffectually, and were retiring as from a fruitless pur- 
suit, when one of the dragoons, as he was riding away, stuck 
hig sabre, more in sport than otherwise, into. a heap of straw 
that lay near-the house. The sword met with no resistance, 
and the dragoon had already passed on, when a figure burst from 
beneath the straw and called out for mercy. It was Mr. §: . 
From some passages in the statement of Ellen Walsh, it-was 
sufficiently obvious that the deceased could not have been the 
wife of Mx. 8, and who she had been, remained to be-dis- 
covered. Before the lapse of many days, this point was ascer- 
tained. ‘There was av humble man named John Conroy; who 
had followed the trade of a shoemaker in one of the small 
' towns of the county of Limerick. This person had humanely 
protected an orphan niece (named Ellen Hanlon), and brought

hex up, from. her infancy in his house as one of his own chil- 
dren, till, she attained her. sixteenth year. She was uncom- 
monly handsome, and, as he imagined, equally modest and 
trustworthy. Her uncle, who it appeared was an honest, in- 
dustrious man, was in the habit of obtaining credit to a con- 
siderable amount for articles in the way of his trade from the 
wholesale dealers in Cork, which he regularly visited once a 
year for the purpose of discharging his engagements for the 
preceding, and obtaining a fresh supply for the ensuing year. 
A few weeks. before the cireumstances above detailed, Conroy 
was about to proceed to Cork according to his annual custom. 
‘He had then in his house one hundred pounds in notes, and 
twelve guineas in gold. On the Sunday preceding his intend- 
ed departure, while he was at mags, Ellen Hanlon disappeared, 
and along with her the whole of his money. He never heard 
of her after, neither had he any knowledge of Mr.«S——, but, 
from. the description given of the young woman who had been 
with him on the Shannon, and more particularly from the coinci- 
dence of the peculiarity about the teeth, he was assured that 
his niece must have been the person, and was accordingly 
produced as a witness for the crown upon Mr. 8 ’s trial. 
The disclosure of these new facts, though it might have dimin- 
ished in some degree the public sympathy for the fate of the 
victim, had a proportionate effect in aggravating every senti- 
ment of horror against the prisoner, by superadding the crimes 
of seduction and robbery to murder. 
. The trial came on at the ensuing agsizes for the county of 
Limerick. A clear ease of circumstantial evidence, consisting 
mainly of the foregoing facts, was made out against the pris- 
 oner, who had nothing, save the ingenuity of his counsel, to 
offer in his defence. When the issue was handed up to the 
jury, it was supposed that they would return a verdict of con- 
viction without leaving the box; but, contrary to expectation, 
they retired, and continued long engaged in consultation.. The 
populace, who watched the proccedings with extraordinary 
interest, murmured at the delay. .This was by no means a 
usual or characteristic sentiment; but at this particular period,

d-a gentleman, and they naturally contrasted the present 
isitation to convict with the promptitude that, as they con- 
‘adduced’ against any one of them. At length, late in the 
evening, a verdict of guilty was found. Sentence of death was 
pronounced, and the prisoner ordered for execution o on the next. 
_ day but one succeeding his conviction. 
Some very unusual incidents followed. Before the judge 
left the bench, he received an application, sanctioned by some 
‘names of consideration in the county, and praying that he

favor. The judge, feeling the case to be one where the law 
should sternly take its course, refused to interfere. He was 
then solicited to permit the sentence to be at least respited to 
such a time as would enable those interested in the prisoner's 
behalf to ascertain the result of such an application from them- 
éelves. To this request the same answer was, for the same 
reasons, returned. There being, however, still time, if expedi- 
tion were used, to make the experiment, a memorial, the’ pre- 
cise terms of which did not publicly transpire, was that even- 
ing despatched by a special messenger to the seat of govern-

commentary. By some it was attributed to the prisoner’s prot- 
estations of innocence—for he vehemently protested his inno- 
cence; by others to particular views and feelings, in which 
politics. predominated ; by the majority (and this conjecture 
appears to have been the true one), to an anxiety 'to avert, if 
possible, from the families of rank and influence with which 
the culprit was allied, the stigma of an ignominious execution. 
The hour beyond which the law had said that this guilty 
young man should not he permitted to exist, was now at hand, 
and the special messenger had not-returned. Yet, so confident

possible. procrastination of the dreadful ceremony. He had 
already lived for more than two hours beyond his appointed 
time, when an answer from the castle of Dublin arrived. Its 
purport was, to bid him prepare for instant death. I have 
heard from.a. gentleman who visited his cell a few minutes 
after this final intimation, that his composure was astonishing. 
‘His sole anxiety seemed to be, to show-that he could die with 
firmness. An empty vial was lying in the cell You have 
been taking laudanum, I perceive, sir,” said the gentleman. 
“TI have,” he replied, “but not with the object that you sus- 
pect. The dose was.not strong enough for that—I merely 
took as much as would steady my nerves.” He asserted his 
innocence of all participation in the murder of Ellen Hanlon, 
and declared that, if ever Sullivan should be brought to trial, 
the injustice ofthe present sentence would appear. 
The friends of the prisoner were, for many and obvious 
reasons, desirous that he should be conveyed in a close car- 
riage to the place of execution. Expecting a reprieve, they 
had neglected to provide one, and they now found it impossible 
to hire such a conveyance. Large sums were offered at the 
different places where chaises and horses were to be let; but 
the popular prejudice prevailed.* At last-an old carriage was 
found exposed to sale, and purchased. Horses were still to be

gallows in a cart, sitting on his coffin—unless it were part of his punishment 
that “his body be handed over to the surgeons for dissection.” The finisher 
of the law, having adjusted the fatal rope on ‘‘ the horse that was foaled of an 
acorn” (see Ainsworth’s Jack Sheppard), and round the neck of the doomed 
man, whom he placed standing in the cart, used to descend on ¢erra firma, take 
hold of the horse’s head, draw away the cart, and thus give the death-fall to 
his victim. If any other person led the horse away, the disgrace of having 
virtually acted as executioner would cling to him through life. As I am on 
the subject, I may add that “Jack Ketch” is a nom-decorde used only in 
England. The Irish nick-name, no matter what the true appellation, is 
“Qanty the hangman,” and the miserable wretch is compelled, out of regard 
for his personal safety, to reside in prison. If recognised out of doors, his life 
would not be worth half-an-hour’s purchase, so great is the popular detestation 
of his trade of legal murder.—M. .

act of the animal had a-superstitious import. It evinced a 
preternatural abhorrence of the crime of murder—a miraculous 
instinct in detecting guilt, which a jury of Irish gentlemen had 
, taken hours to pronounce upon. Set 
Every effort to get the carriage forward having failed, the 
prisoner was removed from it, and conducted on foot to the 
place of execution. It was a solemn and melancholy sight as 
he slowly moved along the main street of a crowded city; én 
vironed by military, unpitied by the populace, and gazed at 
with shuddering curiosity from every window. For a while 
the operation of the laudanum he had drunk was manifest. 
Theré was a drowsy stupor in his eye as he cast it insensibly 
around him. Instead of moving continuously forward, every 
step he made in advance seemed a distinct and laborious effort. 
Without the assistance of the jailer and clergyman who sup- 
ported him between them, he must, to all appearance, have’ 
dropped on the pavement. These effects, however, gradually

     suggests. ‘few remarks, and furnishes a striking 
upon:a subject of some interest as connected with the 
tration of justice in Ireland. - 
In that-country an extraordinary importance is, attached to 
dying declarations. In cases exciting any unusual interest, no 
sooner is a convicted person handed over to the executioner, ' 
than he is. beset on all sides with eritreaties to make what is 
zalled a last. satisfaction to justice and: to the public mind, by 
an open confession of his guilt. As between the convict and 
the law, sueh a proceeding i is utterly nugatory. If he denies 
his guilt, he is not believed; if he admits it, he only admits 
a fact so conclusively established, as to every practical ‘pur- 
pose;. that any’ supplemental corroboration is superfluous, Tf” 
the verdict of a jury required the sanction of a confession, no 
sentence could be justifiably executed’ in any case where that 
sanction was withheld. But this could not be. In submitting 
the question of guilt or innocence to the process of a public 
trial, we apply the most efficacious method that our laws have 
been able to devise for the discovery of the truth. The result,. 
like that’ of all other questions depending upon human testi- ; 
mony, may be erroneous. The condemned may be a martyr; 
for juries are fallible: but, for the purposes of society, their 
verdict must be final, except upon those rare occasions where 
its propriety is subsequently brought into doubt by new evi- 
dence, emanating from a less questionable source than that of 
_ the party most interested in arraigning- it. 
. Then, as far as regards the satisfaction of the public mind 
with the justice of the conviction (for upon this great stress is 
also laid), the public should nevér be encouraged. to require a 
higher degree of certainty than the law requires. But the’ 
practice of harassing convicts for a confession before the 
crowds, assembled to witness their execution, produces this 
effect. Te teaches them to divert their attention from the best 
-and only practical test of a question that should no longer be 
at'issue, and to set a value upon a test the most deceptive 
that can be imagined. A voluntary admission of guilt may, 
" to besure, bé depended on; but, after conviction, no kind,of 
ean be-placed upon the most solemn asseverations to

_the contrary. Death and eternity are dreadful things; and.it 
igdreadfal to think of wretches determined to brave them with 
a deliberate falsehood upon their lips; yet there are men— 
many—that have the nerve to do this. In Ireland it is of 
frequent occurrence; particularly in cases of conviction for 
political offences, and, more or less, in all others. A regard 
for posthumous reputation—the false glory of being remem- 
-bered as a martyr-—a stubborn determination to make no 
concession to a system of laws that he never respected —con- 
cern for the feelings and character of relatives, by whom a 
dying. protestation of innocence is cherished, and appealed 
to as a bequest to the honor of a family-name: thesé and 
similar motives attend the departing culprit to the final scene, 
and prevail to the last over every suggestion of truth and 
religion. It was so.in the case I am now narrating. At the 
place of execution, the prisoner was solemnly adjured by the 
clergyman in attendance to admit the justice of his sentence >. 
he as solemnly re-asserted his innocence. The cap was drawn 
over his eyes, and he was about to be thrown off. An acei- 
dental interruption occurred. The clergyman raised the:cap, 
and once more appealed to him as to a person upon whom the 
world had already closed. The answer was: “I am suffer- 
ing for a crime in which I never Participated. If Sullivan is 
ever found, my innocence will appear.” 
Sullivan was found before the next assizes, when he was tried 
and convicted upon the same evidence adduced against his 
‘master. Sullivan was a catholic; and after his conviction 
made .a voluntary and ‘full confession. It put the master’s 
guilt beyond all question. The wretched girl, according t6 
his statement, had insisted upon retaining in her own hands 
one half of the sum of which she had robbed her uncle. To 
obtain this, and also to disembarrass himself of an incum- 
brance, her seducer planned her death. Sullivan undertook . 
to be the executioner. After setting Ellen Walsh on shore, 
they returned to an unfrequented point near Carrickafoyle, 
where the instrument of murder, a musket, and a rope, lay 
concealed. With these and the unsuspecting victim, Sullivan 
put’ out in the boat. The master remained upon the strand.   
-P-A-G-E-58
A POPULAR BELIEF. : BT 
After the interval of an hour, the boat returned, bearing back 
Ellen Hanlon unharmed. .“TI thought I had made up my 
mind,” said the ruffian in his penitential declaration; “1 
was just lifting the musket to dash her brains out— ut when 
I looked in her innocent face, I had not the heart to doit.” ‘This 
excuse made no’ impression upon the merciless. master. Sul-

murderous mission; the musket was once more raised, and —~

* Jt may be mentioned as a striking instance of the belief in the declaration 
(made by no Jess a person than Lord Redesdule, who had been Irish lord- 
chancellor), “in Ireland there is one law for the rich, and another for the 
poor,” that there are yet hundreds in the county of Limerick, who were present 
at this execution, and seriously believed that it was not Mr. Scanlan who was 
hanged, but some other prisoner who was rendered unconscious by means of 
strong narcotics. “It was currently reported that, because he was a gentleman,

roy, the London banker, for forgery, a motion for delay, in some case where 
u large amount of property was involved, was actually made in one of the law- 
courts at Westminster, grounded in an affidavit that Fauntleroy was alive in 
America, and that a commission should be sent over to take his examination 
as a witness. The motion was refused, as the fact of his continued existence 
was not positively sworn to, but it is surprising that the lawyer who made, and 
the judge who heard the motion, should have forgotten the plain end undoubted 
fact, that having been capitally condemned, Fauntleroy was dead in law, and 
his evidence, therefore, quite valueleas.—M. ° : 3*

Tue law, and the practice of the courts, in Treland, are, with 
some trivial exceptions, precisely the same as in England ,;*.. 
but the system of professional life in Iveland is in some respects - 
different. I allude to the custom, which the Irish bar -have- 
long since adopted, of assembling daily for the transaction of 
business, or in search of it, if they have it not, in the “Hall; 
of the Four Courts,” Dublin. The building itself is a splendid 
one. Like the other public edifices of Dublin (and I might: 
- add, the private ones), it is an effort of Irish pride, exceeding 
far in magnificence the substantial wealth and civilization of 
the country. In the centre of the interior, and overcanopied., 
by a lofty-dome, is spacious circular hall, into, which the .sev- 
eral courts of justice open. : : 
I was fond of lounging in this place. . From the hours of 
twelve to three it is a busy and a motley scene. When I 
speak of it as the place of daily resort for the members of the 
legal profession and their clients, I may be understood to mean 
that it is the general rendezyous of the whole community ; for 
in Ireland almost every man of any pretensions that you meet, 
is either a plaintiff or. defendant, or on the point of becoming - : 
so, and, when in Dublin, seldom fails to repair at least once a 
day to “the Hall,” in order to look after his cause,.arid, by 
conferences with his lawyers, to keep up his mind to the true

of the town resort, to drop or pick up the rumors of the day. 
There is also a plentifal adinixturé of the lower orders, among 
whom it is not difficult to distinguish the country-litigant. 
You know him by his mantle of frieze, his two boots and one 
spur; by the tattered lease, fit emblem of his tenement, which 
he unfolds as cautiously as Sir Humphrey Davy would a man- 
useript of. Herculaneum ; and, best of all, by his rueful visage, 
in which you can clearly read that some. clause in the last 
ejectment-act lies heavy on his heart. 
These form thé principal materials of the scene ; but it is not 
so easy to enumerate the manifold and -ever-shifting combina- 
tions iito-which they are diversified. The rapid succession 
of so many objects, passing and repassing eternally before you, 
perplexes and quickly exhausts the eye. It fares still worse 
with the ear. The din is teemendous. Besides the tumult of 
some thousand voices in ardent discussion, and the most of 
them raised to the declamatory pitch, you have ever and anon 
‘the stentorian cries of the tipstaffs, bawling out, “The gentle- 
. men. of the special jury to the box!” or the still more thrilling 
vociferations of attorneys or attorneys’ clerks, hallooing to a 
particular counsel that -“ their case is called on, and all is lost if 
he delays an instant!” Whereupon the counsel, catching up 
- the sound of his name, wafted through the hubbub, breaks pre- 
cipitately from the cirele that engages him, and bustles through 
the throng, escorted, if-he be of any eminence, by a posse of 
applicants, each claiming to monopolize him, until he reaches 
the entrance of the court, and, plunging in, escapes for that 
time from their importunate solicitations.

is amusing to witness the contest between the respective attor- 
neys to secure their champion. : 
Mr. O'Connell, for instance, who is high i in every branch of > 
his profession, and peculiarly. in request for what is.termed- 
“battling a motion,” is perpetually to be seen, 'a conspicnoun 
figure in.this scene of clamor and commotion, balancing be-~ 
tween two équally pressing calls upon him, and deploring his. 
waut of ubiquity, The first time he was pointed out tome, 
he was in one of these predicaments, suspended like Garrick: 
in the picture between conflicting solicitations. On the-ona: 
side an able-bodied, boisterous catholic attorney, from the 
county of Kerry, had laid his athletic gripe upon “the coun- 
sellor,” and swearing by some favorite saint, was fairly hauling. 
him along in the direction of the Exchequer; on the other side 
a more polished town-practitioner, of the established faith,. 
pointed with pathetic look and gesture to the Common Pleas, 
and in tones of agony implored the learned gentleman to re- 
member that “their case was actually on, and that if he were 
not at his post, the court would grant the motion, costs and all, . 
against their client.” On such occasions a counsel has a deli- 
cate task; but long habit enables him to assume a neutrality, 
if he has it not. In the instance alluded to, I could not sufi-- 
ciently admire the intense impartiality manifested by the sub- 
ject of contention toward each of the competitors for his learned ~ 
carcass; but the physical force of the man from Kerry, aided 
perhaps by some local associations—for the counsellor is a 
“ Kerry-man” himself—~ prevailed over all the moral wooing 
of his-rival, and he carried off the prize. 
The preceding are a few of the constant and ever-acting 
elements of noise and motion in this busy scene; but an extra 
sensation is often given to the congregated mass. The detee-

tion:of a pickpocket (I am not speaking figuratively) causes a 
sudden and impetuous rush of heads, with wigs and without 
_them, to the spot where the culprit has been caught in fagrante. 
At other times the scene is diversified by a group of fine girls 
from ‘the-country, coming, as they all make a point of doing, to 
see the courts, and show themselves to the junior bar. A 
crowd of young and learned gallants instantaneously collects, 
and: follows in their wake: even the arid veteran will start 
from his legal revery as they pass along, or, discontinuing the 
perusal-of his deeds and counterparts, betray by a faint leer 
that, with all his love of parchment, a fine skin, glowing with 
the tints that life and nature gave it, has yet a more pre- 
vailing:charm. Lastly, I must not omit that the Hall is not 
unfrequently thrown into “confusion worse confounded” by that 
particular breach of his majesty’s Irish peace,. improperly 
called a “horsewhipping.” When an insult is to be avenged, 
this place is often chosen for its publicity as the fittest scene 
of castigation. 
But this scene, though at first view the emblem of inextrica- 
ble confusion, will yet, when frequently contemplated, assume 
certain forms approaching to regular combination: thus, after 
an attendance of a few days, if you perambulate the arena, or 
“stand upon some elevated point from which you can take in 
the whole, you will recognise, especially among the members 
of the bar, the same individuals, or classes, occupied or grouped 
in something like an habitual manner. On the steps outside 
the entrance to the Court of Chancery, your eye will probably 
be caught by the imposing figure and the courteous and manly 
features of Bushe,* waiting there till his turn comes to refute some 
long winded argument going on within, and to which, as a piece 
of forensic finesse, he affects a disdain to listen: or, near the 
same spot, you will light upon the less social but more pregnant 
and meditative countenance of Plunket,t as he paces to and 
fro alone, resolving some matter of imperial moment, until he 
is roused from these more congenial musings, and hurries on to

a group of quite another stamp— pallid, keen-eyed, anxions: 
aspirants for professional employment, and generally’ to-de 
found in vehement debate over some dark and dreary point of © 
statute or common law, in the hope that, by violently rubbing 
their opinions together, a light may be struck at last. -Adittle

men (many of them, I was assured, possessed. of fine talents, 
which, if differently applied, must have forced their way) who 
from term to term, and year to year, submit to “trudge the 
Hall,” waiting till their turn shall come at last, and too often 
havassed by forebodings that it may never come. It was not 
difficult to read their history in their looks: their countenances 
wore a sickly, pallid, and jaded expression ;* the symbols of 
hope deferred,-if not extinguished ; there was even something, 
as they sauntered to and fro, in their languid gait and unde-

sensations were melancholy and irksome. I was for some time 
at a loss to account for this extreme disproportion between the 
supply and-the demand—so much greater than any ever 
known to exist.in England. . : 
During my stay in’ Dublin, I accidentally fell into conver- 
sation with ‘an intelligent Irish gentleman, who in the early

* I have heard sevéral medical men of Dublin speak of the air of the courts 
and hall, as particularly unwholesome. Besides the impurity communicated 
to the atmosphere by the crowds that collect there, the situation is low and - 
marshy. The building is so close to the river Liffey, that fears have been en- 
tertained for the safety of the foundation. Formerly. before the present quay 
was constructed, the water in high tides sometimes made its way into the hall. 
The mention of this reminds me of one or two of Curran’s jokes :—upon one 
occasion, not only the hall, but the subterraneous cellars in which the bar-dresses 
are kept, were inundated. When the counsel went-dowa to robe, they found 
their wigs and gown affoat; Curran, for whom a cause was waiting seized the 
first that drifted within reach, and appeared in court, dripping like.a river-gud. 
“Well, Mr. Curran,” asked one of the judges, “ how did you leave your friends 
coming on below ?”—“ Swimmingly, my lord.” In the course of the moriing, 
‘one of these learned friends (who, from missing his footing, had come in for a 
thorough sousing) repeatedly protested to their lordships, that he should feel” 
ashamed to offer such and such arguments to the court. “Curran, in reply, com- 
plimented him upon his delicacy of feeling, which he represented as “truly a 
high and rare strain of modesty, in one who had just been dipped in the Ligey.” 
[As an Irishman who has that facility of speech and compliment called “ the. 
gift of the gab," is usually mentioned as having hissed the Blarney-stone; so if

profession of the law. I mentioned what I had observed, and 
asked for an explanation. He gave it pretty nearly as fol- 
lows; I am inclined to confide in what he stated as substan- 
tially correct. —‘“ Your remark is just, that our bar is griev- 
ously overstocked ; and crowds of fresh members are flocking 
to it every term, as if for the sole purpose, and certainly. with 
the effect, of starving one another. If the annual emoluments 
of the profession were collected into a common fund,’and 
equally distributed among the body, the portion of eagh, would 
not exceed a miserable pittance. The inordinate preference 
for the profession of the bar in Ireland arises from many 
causes. As one of the chief, I shall mention the preposterous © 
ambition of our gentry, and their fantastic sensitiveness on the 
article of ‘family pride.” An Irish father’s first anxiety,isto 
give his son a calling in every way befitting the: ancient 
dignity of his name; and in this point of view, the bar. has 
peculiar attractions. It is not merely that it may, by poasi- 
bility, lead to wealth, or perhaps, to a peerage or a seat in the 
privy council — though these are never left out of the aceount . 
— but, independently of all this, an adventitious dignity. has 
been conferred upon it, as a profession, by the political ciream- 
stances of the country. Until the act of 1792, no Catholic 
could become a barrister: all the emoluments and dignities 
of the law were the exclusive property of the privileged few; 
and they were so considerable, that the highest families in the 
kingdom rushed in to share them. ‘This stamped an aristo- 
cratic character and importance upon the profession. To be 
a ‘counsellor’ in those days, was to be no ordinary. personage. 
Many of them belonged to noble houses; many were men of 
_ name and authority in the state; all of them, even the least 
distinguished, caught a certain ray of glory from the mere act 
of association with a favored class, contending for the most 
dazzling objects of competition. Much of this has passed 
away; but a popular charm, I should rather say a delusion, 
still attaches to the name; and parents, duped. by certain 
vague and obsolete associations, continue to precipitate their 
sons into this now most precarious career, without the least ad- 
vertence to their substantial prospects of success, and in utter

deserves to succeed: at our bar, will fail.’ ‘This may be very 
true; but what a complication of qualities, what a course of 
privation, what trials of taste, and temper, and pride, are in- 
volved in that familiar and ill-understood assertion.

sheer unaided merits, must have a mind and frame prepared 
by nature for the endurance of unremitting toil. He must

his competitors in the art of reasoning right from right prin-

adept in ‘reasoning right from wrong principles, and wrong 
from right ones. He must learn to glory in a perplexing 
sophistry, as in the discovery of an immortal truth, He must 
make up his mind and his face to demonstrate, in open court, 
with all imaginable gravity, that nonsense is replete with 
meaning, and that the clearest meaning is manifestly non- 
sense by.construction. This is what is meant by ‘legal habits 
of thinking ;’ and to acquire them, he must not only prepare 
his faculties by a course of assiduous and direct cultivation, 
but he must absolutely forswear all other studies and specula- 
tions that may interfere with their perfection. There must be 
no dallying with literature; no hankering after comprehensive 
theories for the good of men; away must be wiped all such 
‘trivial fond records.’ He must keep to his digests and in- 
dexes. He must see nothing in mankind but a great collec- 
tion of plaintiffs and defendants, and consider no revolution in 
their affairs as comparable, in interest, to the last term reports 
of points of practice decided in Banco regis. As he walks the 
streets, he must give way to no sentimental musings.. There 
must be no ‘commercing with the skies;’ no idle dreams of 
love, and rainbows, and poetic forms, and all the bright illu- 
sions ‘upon which the ‘fancy free’ can feast. If a thought of

that our bar‘was uninfluential, and likely, on occasions, to be 
a troublesome body in the state, than the most decisive meas- 
ures were taken to break its spirit. Places were multiplied 
beyond all necessity: and all precedent in England. By a 
single act of Parliament, two and: thirty judicial offices were 
created, to be’ held by barristers of six years’ standing, and 
averaging each from five to eight hundred pounds a year. 
This was one of the political measures of the late Lord Clare,t

and died in 1817), memorable alike for genius and geniality—eJoquence and

¢ John Fitzgibbon, Earl of Clare, who is described by Barrington as a “‘des- | 
pot and the greatest enemy Ireland ever had,” was the son of a gentleman 
in the county of Limerick, who had been a Roman catholic, and intended for 
a priest, but changing his tenets, became an eminent barrister and member of 
Parliament. It is untrue, as reported, that Fitzgibbon was originally poor and 
of low birth; one of his sisters married Mr. Jeffreys, the rich owner of Blarney

“tiany ‘other sound lawyers and worthy gentlemen, a most 
mischievous statesman. He had felt in his own experience 
how far the receipt of the public money may extinguish a_sen-

day. The profession teems with places of emolument; and 
the consequence is, that every subdivision of the ‘ parliam

ordinary way, as talents or chance may favor him, byt at, all 
events to receive, in due time, his distributive portion of the- 
general patronage.

dred and two pounds sterling. In 1784, he was appointed Attorney-General, 
owing his elevation as much to his political support of the Government, as 
member of Parliament, as to his legal merit. On the death of Lord Chancel~ 
lor Lifford, in 1789, Mr. Fitzgibbon was appointed his successor (not without vio- 
lent opposition from Thurlow, Chancellor of England, who contended that his 
Irish birth should prevent his holding the highest law-office in Ireland), and 
from that time until hie death, in January, 1802, was virtually ruler’ of Tre- 
land— intolerant, harsh, and unforgiving. In the earlier part of his career, 
having fought a duel with Mr. Curran (at whom he took deliberaté aim), 
he continued his resentment after he became Judge, and let it be seen, by 
contemptuous treatment and hostile decisions, thet the great advocate had. ~ 
not “the ear of the Court.” In 1789, he was created Baron Fitzgibbon, in 
the peerage of Ireland. In 1793, he was advanced to the rank of Viscount. . 
In 1795, he was made Earl of Clare, and was created an English Baron in 
1799, in reward for his severity during the Rebellion of ’98. He was appoint-

the entire body, There may be exceptions that escaped my 
observation} but I could perceive no symptoms of subserviency 
—no surrender of the slightest tittle of their clients’ rights to 
the frowns or impatience of the bench. I was rather struck by 
the peculiarly bold and decisive tone, with which, when occa- 
sions arosé, they asserted the privileges of the advocate. 
“While I am upon this subject, I can not omit a passing 
remark upon another quality, by which I consider the gentle- 
men of this bar to be pre-eminently distinguished —the invari- 
able courtesy of manners which they preserve amid all the 
hurry and excitement of litigation. The present Chancellor 
of Ireland,* himself a finished gentleman, was struck upon his 
arrival ‘by the peculiarly gentlemanlike manner in which he 
observed business transacted in his court.’ Mr. Bushe is the 
great model of this quality. He hands up a point of law to 
the bench with as much grace and pliancy of gesture, as if.he 
were presenting a court-lady with a fan. This excessive 
finish is peculiar to himself; but the spirit which dictates it is 
common to the entire profession. Scenes of turbulent alterca- 
tion are inevitably frequent, and every weapon of disputation 
—wit and sneers, and deadly brain-blows— must be employed 
and encountered; but the contest is purely intellectual: it is 
extremely raze, indeed, that anything approaching to an 
offensive personality escapes. No ultra-forensic warmth oceurs 
in the Ivish courts. It is avoided on common principles of 
good taste: it is also prévented, if I am rightly informed, by 
the understood feeling that anything bordering upon personal 
rudeness must infallibly lead to a settlement out of Court.”t 
When I first frequented the courts in Dublin, I went entirely 
with the view of witnessing the specimens of forensic talent 
displayed there. I found more than I had expected; and one 
circumstance that very forcibly struck me demands a few 
words apart. I would recommend to any stranger wishing to

process of the law; and. the facts that daily come out, offer a 
frightful, and. most: disgraceful picture of the lawless habits of 
the lower, and also, I regret to add, of the higher orders of the 
community. One of our judges in Westminster. Hall would 
start from his seat in wonder and indignation at the details-of

almost unmoved, as to mere ordinary outrages of course. “The

blood of the defendant swells up to the boiling point, and“he

in his face. Resistance, remonstrance, and entreaties, are all 
unavailing ; nothing remains for him but to effect: his retreat, 
if the power of moving be left him, to the nearest magistrate, 
not in the interest of the defeudant, where with the help of 
some. attorney that will venture to take a fee against “his 
honor,’ he draws up a bulletin of his kicks and bruises in the 
form of an affidavit, to ground a motion that “another writ do 
issue;” ox, as it might. be more correctly worded, “that 
another process-server do expose himself to as sound a thrash- 
ing as the last.” This is not an exaggerated picture; and in 
order to complete it, it should not be omitted that the instiga- 
tor of the outrage, as soon as he can with safety appear abroad, 
will, to a certainty, be found among the most clamorous for 
proclamations and. insurrection-acts, to keep down the lawless 
propensities of his district.* 
I have offered a specimen of Irish society, as I could collect 
it from affidavits daily produced in court; yet, shocking and 
disgusting as the details are, I confess it is not easy to repress 
a smile at the style in which those adventurous scenes are 
described. The affidavits are generally the composition of 
country attorneys. The maltreated process-server puts the 
‘story of his injured feelings and beaten carcase into the hands 
* Considerable ingenuity used to be exercised in the treatment of process- 
servers in Ireland, It was said, as a sort of boast, that “the King’s writ would 
not run in Connaught." This meant that nobody could serve it. To say of 
any stranger, in that district, that he looked like a process-server, was to con- 
demn him, at the least, to an utter impossibility of obtaining fvod, fire, and 
lodging, whether for love or money. If a man were found with a copy of a 
writ in his pocket, waiting the opportunity to serve it on a popular defendant, 
he was simply condemned, in the first instance, to make a meal, scrap by scrap, 
until they were consumed, of the parchment original and the paper copy. If 
detected a second time, the common penalty was to have his ears cut off. A 
third attempt was rarely made, thé punishment being to take off the cul- 
prit's shirt, hold him‘on the ground, and draw a thorny furze-bush over his 
back, to and fro, until it was shockingly lacerated. This agreeable and humane 
practice, which was called carding, chiefly prevailed in Tipperary. At present,

Ir any one, being a stranger in Dublin, should chance, as 
you return upon a winter’s morning from one of the “small 
and early” parties of that raking metropolis—that is to say, 
between the hours-of five and six o’clock—to pass along the 
south side of Merrion Square," you will not fail to observe that 
among those splendid mansions there is one evidently tenanted 
by a person whose habits differ materially from those of his 
fashionable neighbors. The -half-opened parlor-shutter, and 
the light within, announce that some. one dwells there whose 
time is tov precious to permit him to regulate his rising with 
the sun’s. Should your curiosity tempt you to ascend the 
steps, and, under cover of the dark, to reconnoitre the interior, 
you will see a tall, able-bodied man standing at a desk, and 
immersed in solitary occupation. Upon the wall in front of 
him there hangs a crucifix. From this, and from-the calm at- 
titude of the person within, and from a certain monastic rotun- 
dity about his neck and shoulders, your first impression will 
be, that he must. be some pious dignitary of the Church of 
Rome absorbed in his matin devotions. 
But this conjecture will be rejected almost a soon as formed.

drop in to any of the public meetings that are almost daily 
held for some purpose, or to no purpose, in Dublin, to a cer- 
tainty you will find the counsellor there before you, the presi- 
ding spirit of the scene, riding in the whirlwind, and directing 
the storm of popilar debate, with a strength of lungs, and re- 
dundancy of animation, as if he had that moment started fresh 
for the labors of the day. There he remains until, by dint-of 
strength or dexterity, he has carried every point; and thence, 
if you would see him to the close of the day’s “ eventful his- 
tory,” you will, in all likelihood, have to follow him to a pub- 
lic dinner, from which, after having acted a conspicuous part 
in the turbulent festivity of the evening, and thrown off half a 
dozen speeches in praise of Ireland, he retires at a late hour 
to repair the wear and tear of the day by a short interval of 
repose, and is sure to be found before dawn-break next morn: 
ing at his solitary post, recommencing the routine of his rest- 
less existence. Now, any one who has once seen, in the pre-, 
eeding situations, the able-bodied; able-minded, acting, talking, 
multifarious person Ihave been just describing, has no occa- 
sion to inquire his name: he may be assured that he is, and 
can be, no other than “Kerry’s pride and Munster’s glory,” 
the far-famed and indefatigable Danrex, O'Conner.

French service, and grand-cross of the order of St. Louis, died in 1834, aged 
91, He was then not only a general in the French, but oldest colonel in the 
‘English service, and the present military tactics of Europe emanated, in 1787, 
from a military board in which he was the lowest in rank, but highest in abil- 
ity. In Easter Term, 1798 (a few months before the “ Rebellion”), O’Connell 
was called to the Irish bar, and his ability and industry soon obtained him 
business," In 1802, he married his cousin. He opposed the Union, and in 
1869, commenced his public agitation for Catholic emancipation. He became 
a leader of the Catholic Board, and: when that body was put down by the Irish: 
- government, while others silently submitted, O’Connell assumed the leadership 
and published the first of his annual letters to the people of Ireland, headed 
      
with the motto, from Childe Harold, . 
~ & Hereditary bondsmen, know ye not, * 
Who would be free, thernselves must strike the blow.”* 
‘At aggregate and other public meetings of the Catholics, he was the chief speak- 
er and doer, for years. In 1815, he was forced into a duel with Mr. D’Esterre, 
one of the city of Dublin corporation, and the assailant fell. A subsequent mis- 
understanding with Mr. (the late Sir Robert) Peel, then Secretary for Ireland, 
led ‘to a challenge, but the duel was prevented by the arrest of O'Connell, on 
his way to Calais, whither Peel had gone, as beyond the jurisdiction of British 
law. At that time, O’Connell determined never again to become a combatant, 
From 1815, until 1831, when he left the bar, his professional income averaged 
from six thousand to eight thousand pounds sterling a year, and on his uncle’s 
death in 1825, he succeeded to landed property estimated at four thousand 
pounds sterling per annum. He was, beyond all doubt, the best general law- 
yer in Ireland, In 1821, on the visit of George IV. to Ireland, he played the 
courtier—more genially than gracefully. In 1823, he founded the Catholic 
Association, in conjunction with Mr. Sheil—organized the catholic “rent, by 
which the battle of the people was fought at the election hustings—formed 
one of a deputation to England, to adjust the catholic claims committed the 
error of consenting to accept emancipation, clogged with ‘“ the wings” (i. s. 
state payment of the catholic clergy, and confiscation of the forty shillings sterl-

bold expedient of contesting the Clare election, against a popular member

of ‘regal descent to prop their pride. His present ex-Majesty 
of Ivera, Mr. Daniel O’Connell’s uncle, has a territorial reve- 
nue of ‘four or five thousand a year to support the dignity of 
his traditional throne; while the numerous princes of the 
blood, dispersed through the, dominions of their fathers, in the 
characters of. tenants in fee-simple, opulent leaseholders, or 
sturdy mortgagees in possession, form a compact and powerful 
squirearchy, before wliose influence the. proud “descendants 
of the stranger” are often made to bow their necks, in the 
angry collisions of county politics. The subject of the present 
notice is understood to be the heir-apparent to his uncle’s pos- 
sessions. ‘These he must soon enjoy, for his royal kinsman has 
passed his ninetieth year.* In the meantime. he rules in his 
own person an extensive tract among the Kerry hills— of little 
value, it is said, in point of revenue, but dear to the possessor 
as the residence of the idol of his heart, and in truth almost 
“the only tenant on three fourths. of the estate— 
“The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty.” 
Mr. O’Connell was originally intended for the Church, or, 
more strictly speaking, for the Chapel. He was sent, accord- 
ing to the necessities of the time, to be educated at St. Omer; 
for in those days the wise government of Ireland would not 
allow the land of Protestant ascendency to be contaminated 
by a public school of Catholic theology. Dr. Duigenan was 
~ compelled to permit the detested doctrines to be freely preached ; 
but to make the professors of them good subjects, he shrewdly 
insisted that they should still, as of old, be forced to cross the 
seas, and lay in’a preliminary stock of Irish loyalty at a for- 
eign university. But the dread of indigenous theology was 
during all this time—was prosecuted for presumed overt-acts, in 1843, and con- 
demned, with others, after a trial which lested twenty-five days—was convict- 
ed—had the judgment reversed, by the House of Lords, after he and his friends 
-had been three months in prison, and, soon after, saw his own moderate “policy 
opposed by the bolder leaders of the ‘‘ Young Ireland” party, whereby his own 
popularity declined — suffered from declining health—went to Italy, and died at Genoa, before he coald reach Rome, “ the City of the Soul” to so earnest a 
Catholic as he was.— M:

accordingly left St. Omer, with its casuistry, and fasting, and” 
vesper-hymns, to less earthly temperaments; and having swal- 
lowed the regular number of legs of mutton at the Middle 
Temple, was duly admitted to the Irish Bar in Easter term; 
1798. The event has justified his choice. With all the im

rapid. He is now, and has been for many years, as high. in’. 
his profession as it is possible for a Catholic to ascend.

deepest shade of patriotic anguish, now illuminated, no one 
can tell why, as for the celebration of a national triumph. A 
little while back I caught him in his character of a sturdy re- 
former, proclaiming the constitution, and denouncing the vices 
of courts and kings, and he promised me that he would keep 
to that; but, before I had time to look about me, there he was,

of Gdipus, acted in 1718, with marked success, Henceforth his career was 
wholly literary, but his political and philosophical opinions constantly set him at 
issue with “ the powers that be,’’ and much of his time was passed in exile. In 
1743, his play of ““Merope” was so well received at Paris, that he was ap-

In 1750, he went to Berlin, on a visit to Frederic of Prussia, with whom he 
speedily quarrelled. Finally he retired to the village of Ferney, in Switzerland, 
where he lived during the rest of his life, with Madame Denis, his niece. His 
works, in seventy octavo volumes, include nearly all departments of polite lit-

nal carriage and deportment—or, perhaps, I should ‘vather 
say, that the same hand which has moulded the exterior has 
-supersaturated the inner man with a fund of restless propen~ 
sity, which it is quite beyond his power, as it is certainly be- 
. side his inclination, to control. A large portion of this is ne- 
cessarily expended upon his legal avocations; but the labors 
of the most laborious of professions can not tame him into re- 
pose: after deducting the daily drains of the study, and. the 
courts, there remains an ample residuum of animal spirits and 
ardor for oceupation, which go to form a distinct, and, I might

* See bim in the streets, and you perceive at once that he is a 
man who has sworn that his country’s wrongs shall be avenged. 
A Dublin jury (if judiciously selected) would find his very gait 
and gestures to be high treason by construction, so explicitly 
do they enforce the’ national sentiment, -of “Ireland her own, 
or the world in ablaze.” As he marches to court, he shoulders 
his-ambrélla as if it were a pike, He flings out one factious 
foot before the other, as if he had already burst his bonds, and 
was kicking the Protestant ascendency before him; while- 
ever and anon a democratic, broad-shouldered roll of the upper 
man, is manifestly an indignant effort to shuffle off “ the op- 
pression of seven hundred years.” This intensely national 
sensibility is the prevailing peculiarity in O’Connell’s chat- 
acter; foritis not only when abroad, and in the popular gaze, 
that Irish affairs seem to press on his heart:. the same Erin- 
go-bragh feeling follows him into the most technical details of 
his forensic occupations. Give him the most dry and abstract 
position of law to support—the most remofe that imagination 
can conceive froin the violation of the Articles of Limerick, or 
the rape of the Irish parliament, and, ten to one, but he will 
contrive to interweave a patriotic episode upon those examples 
of British domination. The people are never absent from his 
thoughts. He tosses up a bill of exceptions to a judge’s charge 
jn the name of Ireland, and pockets a special retainer with the 
air of a man that dotes upon his country. There is, perhaps, 
some share of exaggeration in all this;.but much less, I do 
believe, than is generally suspected, and I apprehend that he 
would scarcely pass for a patriot without it; for, im fact, he has _ 
been so successful, and looks so contented, and his elastic, 
unbroken spirits, are so disposed to bound and frisk for very 
joy—— in a word, he has naturally so bad a face fora grievance, 
that his political sincerity might appear equivocal, were there 
not some clouds of patriotic grief or indignation to temper the

ite for a barrister of all-work is combined in him; some 
erfection —all in sufficiency. He is not understood to be 
 gdeep scientific lawyer. He is, what is far better for himself 
- and his clients, an admirably practical one. He is a thorough 
adept in all the complicated and fantastic forms with which 
Justice, like a Chinese monarch, insists that her votaries shall 
approach her. A suitor advancing toward her throne, can not 
go.through the evolutions of the indispensable Ko-tow under a 
more. skilful master of the ceremonies. In this department 
of hia profession, the knowledge of the practice of the courts, 
and ‘in a perfect familiarity with the general principles of law 
that are applicable to questions discussed in open court, O’Con-" 
nell is on a level with the most experienced of his competitors; 
and with few exceptions, perhaps with the single oné of Mr. 
Plunket, he surpasses them all in the vehement and perti- 
nacious talent with which he contends to the last for victory, 
or, where victory is impossible, for. an honorable retreat. If 
his mind had been duly disciplined, he would have been @° 
first-rate reasoner and a most formidable sophist. He has all 
the requisites from nature —singular clearness, promptitude, 
and.acuteness. When occasion requires, he evinces a meta- 
physical subtlety of perception which nothing can .¢lude. 
The most slippery distinction that glides across him, he ¢ar 
grasp and hold “ pressis manubus,” until he pleases to set it 
free. But his argumentative powers lose much of their effect 
from want of arrangement. His thoughts have too much’ of 
the impatience of conscious strength to submit to an orderly 
disposition. Instead of moving to the conflict in compact 
axfay, they rush forward like a tumultuary insurgent mass, 
jostling and overturning one another in the confusion of the 
charge ; and, though finally beating down all opposition by 
sheer strength and numbers, still reminding us of the far 
greater things they might have achieved had they been better

within; “there are no trances of abstraction, as if the though‘s’ 
bad -left their home on a distant voyage of discovery ; no

‘prow ;— there is nothing of this about O'Connell. On the 
contrary,.his countenance and manner impress you with the 
notion, that he looks forward to the coming effort as a.pastime 
in which he takes delight. Instead of assuming the “Sir 
Oracle,” he is all gayety and good-humor, and seldom fails 
to disturb the gravity of the proceedings by a series of disor- 
derly jokes, for which he is duly rebuked by his antagonists 
with a solemnity of indignation that provokes a repetition 
of the offenee; but his insubordinate levity is, for the most 
part, so redeemed by his imperturbable good-temper, that even 
the judges, when compelled to interfere and pronounce him 
out of order, are generally shaking their sides as heartily as the 
most enraptured of his admirers in the galleries. In the

Irish jery is the instrument on which he delights to play ; and 
no-one better understinds its qualities and compass. I have 
already glanced at his versatility. It is here that it is dis- 
played. His powers as a Nisi-Prius advocate, consist not so 
much in the perfection of any of the qualities necessary to the 
axt of persuasion, as in the number of them that he has at 
command, and the skill with which he selects,and adapts them 
to the exigency of each particular case. He has a thorough 
knowledge of human nature, as it prevails in the class of men 
whom he has to mould to his purposes. I know of no one that 
exhibits, a more quick and accurate perception of the essential 
peculiarities of the Trish character. It is not merely with ref- 
erence to their passions that he understands them, though here . 
he is pre-eminently adroit. He can cajole a dozen of miser- 
able corporation-hacks into the persuasion that the honor of 
their country is concentrated in their persons. His mere acting 
on such occasions is admirable: no matter how base and 
stupid, and how poisoned by political antipathy to himself, he 
may believe them to be, he affects the most complimentary 
ignorance of their real characters. He hides his scorn and 
coutempt under a look of unbounded reliance. He addresses 
them with all the deference due to upright and high-minded 
jurors. He talks to them of “the eyes of all Europe,” and 
the present gratitude of Ireland, and the residuary blessings 
of posterity, with the most perfidious command of counte- 
nance. In short, by dint of unmerited commendations, he — 
belabors them into the belief that, after all, they have some 
reputation to sustain, and sets them chuckling with anticipated 
exultation, at the honors with which a verdict according to the 
evidence ig to conseerate their names, 
-But, in addition to the art of heating the passions of his 
hearers to the malleable point, O’Connell manifests powers of

peculiarities. . Throw him upon any particular class of men,

instead of attempting to drag them. along with him, whether 
they; will or no, by a chain of unbroken demonstration, he has 
the address to.make them imagine that their movements are 
solely. by themselves. He pays their capacities the 
npliment of not making things too clear. Familiar with the 
Pabitual tendencies of their minds, he contents himself with 
ib g off rather materials for reasoning than elaborate rea- 
sonings-— mere fragments, or seeds of thought, which, from his 
knowledge of the soil in which they drop, he confidently pre- 
dicts will shoot up and expand into precisely the conclusions 
that he wants. This method has the disadvantage, as far as 
personally regards the speaker, of giving the character of more 
~~ than his usual looseness and irregularity to O’Connell’s jury- 
speeches; but his client, for whom alone he labors, is a gainer 
by. it—directly in the way I have been stating, and indirectly 
for this reason, that it keeps the jury in the dark as to the 
points of the case in which he feels he is weak. By abstain- 
ing from a show of rigorous demonstration, where all the argu- 
ment is evidently upon his side, he excites no suspicion by 
keeping at an equal distance from topics which he could not 
venture to approach. This, of course, is not to be taken as 
O’Connell’s‘invariable manner, for he has no invariable man- 
ner, but as a specimen of that dexterous accommodation of par- 
ticular means to a particular end, from which his general 
powers as a Nisi- -Prius advocate may be inferred. And so, too, 
of the tone in which he labors to extort a verdict; for though 
when compelled by circumstances, he-can be soft and soothing,

which O'Connell is without a rival at the Irish Bar—T allude 
to his skill in conducting defences in the Crown court. His 
ability in this branch of his profession illustrates one of those 
‘inconsistencies in his character to which I have already ad+ 
verted. Though habitually so bold and sanguine, he is here 
a model of forethought and undeviating caution. In his most 
rapid cross-examinations, he never puts a dangerous question. 
He presses a witness upon collateral facts, and beats him 
down by arguments and jokes and vociferation; but wisely ~ 
presuming his client to-be guilty until he has the good luck-to . 
escape conviction, he never affords the witness an opportunity: - 
of repeating his original narrative, and perhaps by supplying ~ 
an omitted item, of sealing the doom of the accused. 
O’Connell’s ordinary style is vigorous and copious, but in- © 
correct. The want of compactness in his periods, however, I 
attribute chiefly to inattention. He has phrase in abundance 
at command, is sensible of melody. Every now and then ‘he’ 
throws off sentences not only free from all defect, but ex- 
tremely felicitous specimens of diction, As to his general 
‘powers of eloquence, he rarely fails in a case admitting of emo- 
tion, to make a deep impression upon a jury; and in a popular | 
assembly -he igs supreme. Still there is much more of elo- 
quence in his manner and topics than-in his conceptions. He 
unquestionably proves, by occasional bursts, that the elements 
of oratory, and perhaps of the highest order, are about ‘him ; 
but he has had too many pressing demands of another kind to 
distract him from the cultivation of this the rarest of all attain- 
ments, and accordingly I am not aware that any of his efforts, 
however able and successful, have deserved, as-examples of 
public spéaking, to survive the oceasion. His manner, though 
far from graceful, is earnest and impressive. It has a steady 
and natural warmth, without any of that snappish animation 
in which gentlemen of the-long robe are prone to indulge. 
His voice is powerful, and the intonations full and graduated. 
I understand that when he first appeared at the Bar, his accent 
at once betrayed his foreign education. T'o this day there is a

O'Connell hag been now [1823] for three and twenty years 
a busy actor upon an-agitated scene. During that period no. 
public charaeter has been more zealously extolled, or more 
cordially reviled. “Has the praise or blame been excessive, or 
has either been undesérved? Has he been a patriot, or an 
“incendiary ? for, such are the extreme points of view in which 
the question of his merits has been discussed by persons too 
impassioned and too interested in the result to pronounce a 
sound opinion upen it. To one, however, who has never been 
provoked to admire or hate him to excess, the solution may 
not be difficult. -After reviewing the whole of O’Connell’s 
. career as a politician, an impartial observer will be disposed 
to say of him, that he-was aman of a strong. understanding 
and of stronger feelings, occupied incessantly, and almost 
always without due preparation, upon questions where it would 
have perplexed the wisest to discern the exact medium be- 
tween disgraceful submission and. factious importunity — that 
by necessity a partisan, he has been steady to his cause, and

O’Connell’s either is, or. was ever-caleutated to advance the 
interests of his body. : 
Leaving his political incentives aside, and referring solely . 
to the personal -provocations to which he is daily. exposed, I. 
should say, that it would be utterly unnatural in such a man. 
to be other than violent. ‘To O’Connell, as a barrister, his 
disqualification is a grievous injustice. It is not in theory. 
alone that it operates. It visits him in the practical. detajis: 
of his professional life,.and in forms the most likely to gall. a: 
man of: conscious powers and an ambitious temperameut.: 
He has the mortification of being incessantly reminded that,- 
for years past, his fortunes have been absolutely at .a. dead: 
stop, while he was constantly condemned to see men who. 
started with him and after him, none of them his superiors, : 
many of:them far beneath him, partially thrast before ‘him, 
and lifted into stations of honor and emolument to which he-is: 
forbidden to aspire. The stoutest adversary of papal en~ 
croachments must admit, that there is something irritating in’ 
this; for my part, instead of judging harshly of the spivit in - 
which he retaliates, I rather honor the man for the energy 
’ with which he wrestles to the last with the system that would 
keep him down; and if now and then his resistance assumes. © 
such a form as to be in itself an evil, I am not sorry, forthe 
sake of freedom and humanity, to see it proved that intolerant 
laws can not be enforced without inconvenience, But.in gen-:: 
eral (to speak the truth) O’Connell’s vengeance is not of a very 
deadly description. He is, after all, a man of a kindly. and 
forgiving nature : and where the general interests of his country: 
are not concerned, is disposed to resent his personal wrongs 
with great command of temper. His forbearance in this re- 
spect is really creditable to him, and the more so as it meets 
with no-retarn. . 
The.admirers of King William have no mercy for a man, 
who, in his seditious moods, is so provoking as to tell the world 
that their idol was “a Dutch adventurer.” Then his intolera- -

> steeds, prancing over a Protestant pavement to the terror of 
Protestant passengers—a nuisance that in the good old times 
would. haye been put down by Act of Parliament —these and. 
other provocations of equal publicity, have exposed this learned 
culprit to the deep and irrevocable detestation of a numerous 
class-of his Majesty’s hating subjects in Ireland. And the 
feeling is duly communicated to the public. The loyal press 
of. Dublin teems with the most astounding imputations upon his 
character and motives. As a dish for the periodical libellers 
of:the day, O'Connell is quite a cut-and-come-again, from the 
crazy Churchman; foaming over the apprehended fall of tithes, 
down to the political striplings of the College, who, instead of 
trying their youthful genius upon the cardinal virtues, or “the 
Jawfulness. of killing Ceesar,” devote their hours of classic 
igisare to the more laudable task ‘of demonstrating, for the 
comfort of the Orange lodges, that “Counsellor O’Connell 
carries on a treasonable correspondence with Captain Rock.” 
But the Counseller, who happens to know a little more of the 
law of high treason than his accusers, has the good sense to 
laugh at them and their threats of the hangman. Now that 
all practical attempts upon life have been abandoned,* he 
bears the rest with true Christian patience and contempt; and 
whenever any of his defamers recant “in extremis” and die 
good Catholics, as the most bigoted among them are said to

been defined to be “a thing having neither a body to be kicked nor a soul to 
‘be damned.” With this definition before him, Mr. O’Connell.did not imagine 
that he exceeded the limits of public debate in calling the Dublin Corporation 
a “beggarly Corporation.” One of its most needy members [Mr. d’Esterre], 
however, either volunteered or was incited to think otherwise, and called upon 
the speaker to apologize or fight. To Mr. O'Connell, a life of vital importance 
to a numerous family, and of great importance to the best part of the Irish pub- 
lic, the alternative was dreadful. He saw the ferocity of the transaction in its 
full light, but he.committed his conduct to the decision of his friends, and a 
duel ensued. The aggressor was killed. Had the result been different, his 
‘claims would probably not have been overlooked by the patrons of the time

Ir was on a calm autumn evening that I had returned from _ 
awalk to the splendid seat of Lord Powerscourt, in the county. 
of Wicklow. I had sat down at the inn of the little vil 
where I was sojourning, and had placed myself in the window, 
to while away an hour in observing the “ passing events’ of 
the place. The market was over; the people had gradually : 
passed to their homes; the busy hum of the day was fast dying 
away; and a few straggling groups scattered here and there 
through the long, wide street of the town—the only one ‘it 
boasted — were almost the only persons who artestéd my eye. 
The sun was sinking, and threw his lingering beams into the 
neat but ill-furnished apartment where I was sitting. To avoid 
the glare of his beams, I changed my position, and-this gave 
me a more uninterrupted view of the long street abové referred 
to, which threw its termination into the green fields of the 
country. 
Casting my eyes in this direction, I beheld a chariot-and- 
four coming toward me, enveloped in a complete cloud of dust, 
and the panting horses of which were urged on with tremen-

vehicle-in that place, I leaned out of the window to observe 
’ ity destination, and beheld it still rolling hurriedly along, and 
sweeping round the angle of the street toward the inn with an 
increased violence. If my reader has been much used to trav- 
. elling, he will be aware that the moment a postillion comes in 
sight of an inn, he is sure to call forth the mettle of his horses 
=«perhaps to show off the blood of his cattle.* ‘This was the 
ease at present, and a quick gallop brought the vehicle in thun- 
’ dering noise to the door, where, Shenstone says, is to be found 
“the warmest welcome.” The animals were sharply checked, 
the door was flung open, and the occupier threw himself hur- 
riedly out. 
“Bring out four horses instantly,” was the command he ut- 
tered in the loud voice of haste and authority. 
The inmate of the carriage was about five feet eleven and a 
balf inches high, and wore a portly, stout, hale, and agreeable 
appearance. His shoulders were broad, and his legs stoutly 
built, and, as he at that moment stood, one arm in his side- 
pocket, the other thrust into a waistcoat, which was almost 
completely unbuttoned from the heat of the day, he would 
have made a.good figure for the rapid but fine-finishing pencil

which, partly thrown back, displayed that breadth of forehead

+ George Henry Harlowe, born in London in 1787, was first the pupil and 
afterward the rival of Sir Thomas Lawrence, the eminent portrait-painter. He 
painted some clever historical pictures, of which the best known is “ The Trial 
of Queen Catherine,” in which there are portraits of Mrs. Siddons, with her 
brothers, John and Charles Kemble, and other theatrical celebrities. Of this 
even an engraving is rare and valuable. The original hangs, neglected and 
uncareéd for, in a store-loft, in Soho Square, at London, belonging to a piano- 
forte maker. After visiting Italy, where his accuracy as a copyist, and his re- 
markable facility in original works, excited much admiration, and obtained him,

which I have never yet seen absent from real talent. His eyes 
appeared to.me, at that instant, to be between a light-blue and 
a gray color. “His face was pale and sallow, as if the turmoil 
of business, the shade of care, or the study of midnight, had 
chased away the glow of health and youth. Around his mouth 
played a cast of sarcasm, which, to a quick eye, at oncé be- 
trayed satire; and it appeared as if the lips could be éasily 
resolved into the risws sardonicus. His head was somewhat 
larger than that which a modern doctrine denominates the 
“medium size ;” and it was well supported by a stout and well- 
foundationed- pedestal, which was based ona breast, full, round, 
prominent, and capacious. The eye was shaded by a brow 
which I thought would be more congenial to sunshine than 
storm; and the nose was neither Grecian nor Roman, but was 
large enough to readily admit him into the chosen band of that 
“immortal rebel” (as Lord Byron called Cromwell) who chose 
his body-guard with capacious lungs and noses, as affording | 
greater capability of undergoing toil and hardship. Altogether 
he appeared to possess strong physical powers. . 
He was dressed in an olive-brown surtout, black trowsers, 
and black waistcoat. His cravat was carelessly tied, and the 
knot almost undone, from the heat of the day; and as he stood 
-with “his hand across his bosom, and his eyes bent on the 
ground, he was the very picture of a “public character,” hur- 
rying away on some important matter which required all of 
personal exertion and mental energy. Often as I have seen ~ 
him since, I have never beheld him in so striking or Pictorial 
an attitude. 
“ Quick with the horses ! Y was his hurried ejaculation as he 
recovered himself from his revery, and flung himself into his 
carriage. The whip was cracked, and away went the chariot 
with the same cloud of dust, and the same tremendous pace. 
-Idid not see him pay any money. He did not enter the 
inn. He called for no refreshment, nor did he utter a word to

and while I marked the chariot thundering along the street, 
which had all its then spectators turned on the cloud-enveloped 
vehicle, my curiosity was intensely excited, and I instantly

Most.maal-apropos, however, were my inquiries. Unfortunately, 
the Jandlord was out; the waiter could not tell me his name;

the, same grayish, eye, broad forehead, portly figure, and strong 
tone-of voice, arrested my attention. He was just on the mo-

the speech of a man who had already so strongly interested ~ 
me. After looking at the judge steadily for a nioment, he be- 
gan his speech exactly in the following Pronunciation “My 
Lurrd — Gentlemen of the jury.” 
“Who speaks?” instantly demanded 1. 
“ Counsellor O’Connell,” was the reply. 
“Why, he only arrived last night ?” 
“Late last night, and has had searcely a moment to con 
over his brief. But listen.” 
Jat once fixed my attention, As I do not write short-hand, 
I can. not give the detail of his speech; but his delivery I can 
criticise, and can here write down. 
_. Were O’Connell addressing a mixed assembly where the 
lower orders predominated, I scarcely know any one who 
would have.such a power of wielding the passions. He has a 
knack of speaking to a mob which I have never heard exceed- 
ed. His manner has at times the rhodomontade of Hunt;* 
but.he is infinitely superior, of course, to this well-known dem- 
cerat in choice of language and power of expression. The

“Were he opposed to these two persons in any assembly of the 
people, he would infallibly prove himself the victor. A balcony 
outside a high window, and a large mob beneath him, is the 
very spot for O’Connell. There he would be best seen, and 
his powers and person best observed ; but were he in the House 
of Commong, I do not think I am incorrect when I say that 
he would make little impression on the House, supposing he 
were heard.with every prepossession in his favor.* His action 
wants grace and suavity—dqualities so eminently fascmating 
in an elegant and classical speaker, but which perliaps are 
overlooked in an “orator of the people.” The motions-of his 
body are often sharp and angular. His arms swing about un- 
gracefully; and at times the right hand plays slovenly: with 
his watch-chain. 
Though I shall not, perhaps, find many to agree with me, 
yet I am free to confess that he does not appear to me to pos- 
sess that very rare gift—genwine satire. He wants the culti- 
vated grace of language which his compeer, Sheil, possesses, 
and the brillianey of metaphor. None is there else, however, 
. peer or commoner, who can compete with him in the Catholic 
Association. His language is often coarse, and seldom elegant. 
Strong, fierce, and perhaps bold, it often is; but vituperation 
and personality make up too much of the maferiel. His voice 
is gometimes harsh and dissonant; and I could wish more of 
that round, full, ‘mellow tone, which is. essential to a good 
delivery, and which so captivates the ear. “The voice is the 
key which unlocks the heart,” says Madam Roland. I believe 
it. Let the reader listen to the fine round voice of Lord Chief 
Justice Bushe, and then Ict him hear the sometimes grating 
tones of O'Connell, and he will soon perceive the difference. 
The voice of the latter much reminds me of the harsh thinness

astuteness which the latter gentleman possesses in an 
iment, would be no bad substitute for the headlong impet- 
. iesity and violent sarcasm in which O’Connell. sometimes

mell, however, can attempt humor with effect, and he has a 
peculiar tact in suiting this humor to the Irish people. Ihave 
not often seen a good exordium from O’Conncll—an integral 
- portion, of a discourse which it is extremely difficult to make; 
and I think his perorations want grace, point, and force, and 
that which the Italians would denominate “ epressivo.” 
T shall follow him still farther. 
The next place at which I heard the areb- leader of Cathol- 
icism, was at the council-chamber in Dublin castle, where he 
was employed to argue a case before the then Viceroy, Marquis 
Wellesley.* His speech, voice, action, eye (for nothing in 
oratory-escapes me), are as clearly before me at présent as 
they were on that day; and if this should catch his eye, I

sat next the Chief-Secretary, was Lord (then Mr.) Plunket; ~ 
but he merely kept his eyes fixed on the broad green cloth 
which spread amply before him, and, with his arms folded, 
scarcely moved from that position the entire time. Lord 
Wellesley was at the top of the table, dressed in his orders; 
and, as he was of the same opinion in politics with the person 
who was speaking, he seemed tp listen to him with much 
pleasure. His words, tone of voice, and action, seemed more 
strictly attended to than when I heard him at Wicklow; and 
even his step in the anite-rooms, on passing to the chamber, was 
also guarded. Into that chamber he could not come in the 
same hurried careless manner, in which I have sometimes seen 
him fling himself {nto court. One day, while lounging in the 
latter place, I saw him rapidly fling aside the green curtain at 
“the doorway; and as he dashed down the benches to the front 
of the bar metliought he would have almost strode over -the : 
thick files of lawyers, attorneys, clerks, witnesses, &c., who 
chanced to be in his way. | 
In walking through the streets, he “pushes along i in the 
same careless, democratic manner; and his stout, tall figure, 
enables him to shoulder aside the crowds that might oppose 
his hurried march. He seems not to recollect that the slow 
- pace is the pace of the gentleman; on he goes, business and 
emancipation borne mightily on his broad shoulders; and 
stops not, nor stays, till he gets to the Four Courts; from the 
Four Courts he is then off to the Association rooms—from 
the Association to the Four Courts back again —from.the 
Courts to attend some popular assembly, or keep an appoint- 
“ment—from the assembly to-his house to dine—then a hearty 
dinner and a temperate glass— business, parchments, briefs, 
attorneys’ clerks, and “unfledged lawyers” afterward —retir- 
ing early to bed—and then, next day, behold him going

business again.

the late’ Lord Avonmore. I have conversed with one or two 
persons who recollect to have seen him # constant inmate at 
his Lordship’s house, and their report of him is, that “he was 
a clever, hard-headed boy, very attentive to his ‘studies, and 
very negligent of his person.” “He passed in due course through 
Trinity College, Dublin; and was called to the Irish bar in 
1787. His professional advancement was rapid and steady. 
The first public notice that I can find of his name is upon the 
trial of the Sheareses, in 1798 :t he was associated with Cur--

who was a simple-minded lass from Wales. Her reply commonly was, “Well, -

Bastille; and John was seen, on his return, to flourish, with exultation, a hand-

could devise to avert their doom. I am not aware that Mr.

ment in 1797.* On the quéstion of the Union, he took the side 
of his country: his speeches on that occasion contain many fine 
specimens of reasoning, invective, and deliberate enthusiasm. 
A single sentence will convey an idea of their general spirit : 
“For me, I do not hesitate-to declare, that if the madness of 
cause, which was soon suspected, was ascertained by a militia-captain, named 
Armstrong,'who wormed himself into their confidence, to, betray them’to the 
Government. | On the evidence of Armstrong, who had been on visiting terms at 
their house, and an accessory in their councils, the case against the brothers 
was proved —though it condemned himself to an immortality of infamy. The 
trial came off, on July 12, 1798, before Lord Chief Justice Carleton and four 
other Judges. Curran, Phimket, and Ponsonby, were the chief counsel for the 
prisoners, After the trial had lasted sizteen hours, Curran, exhausted in mind 
and body, requested its postponement until the next morning. Attorney-Gen- 
eral Toler (afterward Lord Norbury), on the part of the Crown, refused to consent 
to any adjournment. At midnight, therefore, Curran had to speak; and, wea- 
ried as he was, made an eloquent defence. The next morning, ut eight o’clock, 
a verdict of “Guilty” was returned. The brothers rushed into each other's 
2 . When called up for judgment, at three o’clock the samo day, Henry, 
overcome by emotion, was unable to speak. John, more firm, made only one 
request, that “the husband, the father, the brother, the son, all comprised in 
one person,” should receive, ngt a pardon, which it was not in the power of 
the Court to grant, buta brief respite.’ The request availed not. Toler moved 
that the sentence of death should be carried into execution the next day—and 
so it was, in.front of the prison in Green street. By the common law of Eng‘ 
lend, too witnesses were necessary to convict in cases of treason; and so Coke 
and Blackstone have held; but the Irish Court decided that only one was requi- 
site in Ireland, and that one was Armstrong the informer. So, as Curran stated, 
“that which in Ireland might be legally done, in England it would be murder 
todo.” At present, the law is the same in Ireland as in England. — Event. 
ally, the remains of these unfortunate men were deposited in the vaults beneath 
the Church of. St. Michan’s, Dublin, where the soil and the atmosphere resist 
decomposition, and might there be seen, for over forty years, by eny one who 
paid the sexton. . In January, 1842, the bodies were saved from further pub- 
licity by being placed in coffins of dak and lead. —M:

1728, died 1799), whose name will live, in history, as the Popular leader of the

the revolutionist should tell me, ‘You must sacrifice British 
connection,’ I would adhere to that connection in preference. to 
the independence of my eountry; but Ihave as little hesita- 
tion in saying, that, if the wanton. ambition of a minister should 
- assault the freedom of Ireland and compel me to the alterna- 
tive, I would fling the connection to the winds, and I would 
clasp the independence of my country to my heart.” But in 
those days, as was remarked, “the voice of the patriot in the 
senate was answered by no echo from without.” The nation 
was panic-struck ; gold and promises were profusely scattered ; 
the majority of the “ Honorable House” were impatient to be 
sold, though the wages of their sin was death. The people 
had nothing to offer but gratitude and fame—the minister had 
titles, offices, and pensions; and the Irish Parliament’ was 
knocked down to the highest bidder. ” 
In 1803, Mr. Plunket appeared as one of the counsel for the 
prosecution on the trial of Mr. Robert Emmett.* One particu- 
* There were three Emmetts, sons of Dr. Emmett, who had been state-physi- 
. cian at Dublin, and was an extreme liberal in-his political opinions. Temple, 
the eldest, who distinguished himself in the University and at the bar, died at 
the age of thirty. Thomas Addis, born in 1764, also became a barrister, got 
involved in the revolt of 1798, was allowed to expatriate himself, arrived ‘at 
New York in 1804, where he was at once admitted to practice (by special dis- 
pensation, although opposed, Phillips says, by Chancellor Kent), became Attor- 
ney-General of New York in 1812, and died in 1827, greatly respected and 
lamented. Robert, who was only twenty-three years old, joined in the insur- 
rection of June 23, 1803; was tried, condemned, and executed —lamented even 
by multitudes who disliked his politics, Robert Emmett’s defence, as it is 
called, though actually spoken after condemnation, when called on to receive 
judgment, is one of the most touching and pathetic specimens of  éloquence 
ever uttered. In that, he alluded to his father’s early political instructions, 
when he exclaimed, “If the spirits of the illustrious dead participate in the 
~ conterng of those who were dear to them in’ this transitory scene, dear shade 
of my venerated father! look down on your suffering son, and see has he for a 
moment deviated. from,those moral and patriotic principles which you so early 
inculcated into his youthful mind, and for which he has now to offer up his 
life?’ And who can forget the pathetic earnestness of his request that no man 
would write his epitaph, and the hope that his tomb would remain uninscribed 
until other men and other times could do justice to his character! ‘* When my 
country takes her place,” said he, “among the nations of the earth, then, and 
not till then, let my epitaph be written,” —M,

lar of hiseénduct on that occasion exposed him to great, and, 
as’ it appedi's to -me; most unmerited reproach. The unforti- 
nate prisoner thade no defence—in trath, he had none ‘to. 
make: he produced no evidence, and his counsel announced 
that they would state no case tothe jury. On this ground, 
they contended that the counsel for the Crown should not be 
allowed to address the jury a second time. Mr. Plunket in- 
sisted upon his right: the Court. decided the question in his 
favor, and he proceeded to: comment at length upon the con- 
duct of the prisoner, and upon the wildness and guilt of the 
conspiracy ‘of which ‘he had-been the projector. Emmett’s 
youth and talents, and his deportment on his trial, excited uni- 
versal sympathy :, almost’ all, even those who would: not con- 
sent to spare him, pitied him as a victim——-many admired and 
deplored him as a martyr... ‘The ‘latter exclaimed against Mr. 
Plunket’s exercise of his privilege to speak to the evidence, as 
an act of gratuitous inhumanity. I confess I see the matter in 
quite another light: Mr. Plunket was. a public man, whose 
opinions had great weight with the community ; and I conceive 
it to have been both natural and laudable that he should have 
seized the opportunity of reprobating, in the most emphatic 
terms, the visionary projects of revolution that still prevailed. 
- Curran, from a similar impulse of public duty, had done the 
same thing, a few days before, on the defence. of Owen Kir- 
wan; where we find him digressing from the immediate case 
before the jury, into an elaborate and glowing exposition of 
the guilt and hopelessness of attempting to better thé condition 
of Ireland by force. But the enemies of Mr. Plunket were not: 
- satisfied with a general assertion that his conduct had. been 
unnecessarily harsh. To affix a deep stignia upon his charac- 
ter, it was industriously circulated that he had been a constant 
guest of Emmett’s father; at whose table he had inculeated po- 
litical principles upon the son which now brought him to the 
grave; and,to give credit to the calumny, a passage was inter- 
polated in the report of Emmett’s address to the Qourt,* in. which 
“No allusion to Phmket was made by Robert Emmett—and Phillips, who 
examited thé charge very closely, declares ‘ Emmett never did so with truth, 
nor could “his Have done so with truth.” So far from beiig on intimate terms,

the dying enthusiast was made to pronounce a bitter invec- 
tive against “the viper that his father had nurtured in his 
bosom.” 
Mr. Plunket was compelled to resort to a public vindication 
. of his character. He instituted legal proceedings against a 
Gondon journal in which the libel was inserted, and obtained 
a verdict :* he also. published an affidavit, positively denying 
every material fact in the accusation. He might have gone 
farther, and have truly sworn that the accusation was never 
made until after the supposed accuser was in his grave.’ I 
have conversed with several who were present at the trial, one 
or two of them friends and admirers of Emmett: they -all 
solemnly assured me, that not a syllable escaped his lips bear- 
ing the remotest allusion to the charge; and the omission in 
Mr. Plunket’s affidavit of this conclusive circumstance, was 
" pointed out to me as a singular absence of sagacity, in a man 
so notoriously sharp-sighted where the concerns of others. are 
confided to his eare. I should not have dwelt thus long upon 
this transaction, were it not that “Mr. Plunket’s conduct to- 
Robert Emmett” is, to this day, frequently adverted to by per- 
sons unacquainted with the particulars, as an indelible blemish 
upon his reputation.t 
with the Emmett family, it is stated (in the Memoir of Plunket in the Dublin 
University Magazine for March, 1840) that he did not know them personally, 
and had only once met any of them, Thomas Addis Emmett, at a public din- 
ner.— M, 
* It was against William Cobbett that Plunket brought the action, and ob- 
tained smart damages. This may account for Cobbett’s constant and bitter 
attacks’on him, in later years. In the Union debate, in 1800, Plunket, who 
was an Anti-Unionist, made a very striking speech, which contained the follow 
ing sirong sentence, among others: “ For my part, I will resiet it [the Union] 
to the last gasp of my existence, and with the last drop of my blood; and when 
I feel the-hour of my dissolution ‘approaching, I will, like the father of Hanni- 
bal, take my children t6 thé altar, and sivear them to eternal hostility against 
the invaders of their country's freedom.” Thirty years later, when Plunket had 
accepted a peerage ‘and office from the Saxons whom he had thus denouri¢ed, 
Cobbett had fair game in him, and did not spare the lash. Enumerating the 
variety of public offices, ia Church and State, to which the Plunkets had been 
appointed, Cobbett constantly spoke of’ the Hannibals and their father Hamil- 
car Plunket !— M.

Mr. Plunket was made solicitor-general in 1803, and attor- 
ney-general and @ privy counsellor in 1805. He retained his 
place when the whigs came into office, in 1806. I believe that 
this-was the commencement of his connection with Lord Gren- 
ville, to whose party he has since adhered. After the death 
of. Mr. Fox, it was intimated to him that the new administra- 
tion had:no intention of superseding him, but he preferred to 
follow the fortunes - cof Lord Grenville, and resigned. Since 
1812, he has sat in the Imperial Parliament, as a member for 
the university of Dublin. 
Mr. Plunket has for some years past confined himself to the 
Court of Chancery, where he holds the same pre-eminence 
that Romilly} did in England. Of all the eminent lawyers I 
unnecessary speech, as Emmett acarcely denied his guilt,’ but Plunket’s own 
excuse was that he thought himself culled upon not so much to address the 
Jury, as the country through the Jury. In 1819, he repeated that “the times 
rendered it necessary.” Phillips, again referring to the case in 1851, declares 
that if a speech were necessary it should have been made, not by Plunket but 
by Mr. M‘Cleland, who as solicitor-general was next in rotation. It was also 
said that Plunket had volunteered his exertions: on the contrary, they were 
specially solicited by the first law officer of the crown. Dr, Sandes, atter- 
ward Bishop of Cashel, who from his well-deserved popularity, had the repre- 
sentation of Dublin University in his hands, was canvassed by Plunket, during 
his contest with: John Wilson Croker, and frankly said he would oppose him, 
unless he could clear up his conduct on Emmett’s trial. The explanation was 
satisfactory, and Sandes supported Plunket, who was elected by @ majority of 
five. On the other hand, the eulogistic biographer in the Dublin University 
Magazine, while he acquits Plunket of the main charge of ingratitude, con- 
demns his“ eager zeal,” and adds that after the two officers of the Crown did not 
think it necessary to make a single remark, after the prisoner’s case had closed, 
Plunket “assailed the ead enthusiast, in that hour of his deepest suffering, in 
. a theme of invective which might have been well spared.” . The fact seems to 
be, Plunket, who had’ begun to look office-ward, seized the opportunity of 
showing that his own strong and hostile opinions had softened down into re- 
spect for the ruling authorities, and for good order, as sustained by the law.—M.

have heard, he seemed to me to be the most admirably qualified- 
for the department. of his profession in which he shines. His 
mind is at once subtile and comprehensive : his language clear, 
-copious, and condensed : his powers of reasoning are altogether 
wonderful. Give him the most complicated and doubtful 
case to support — with an array of apparently hostile decisions 
to oppose him at every step— the previous discussion of the 
question has probably satisfied you that the arguments of his 
antagonists are neither to be answered nor evaded—they 
have fenced round the rights of their clients with all the great 
names in equity—Hardwicke, Camden, Thurlow, Eldon :* Mr. 
* Edward Thurlow, born in 1735, and called to the bar in 1758, was mode 
Solicitor-General in 1770, and Attorney-General in 1771. In Parliament, he 
supported the ministers in their anti-American measures., In June, 1778, he 
was elevated to the office of Lord-Chancellor, and was created Lord Thurlow. 
In 1783, he quitted office, when the Coalition Ministry came in, but was reap- 
pointed on Pitt’s becoming Premier. In 1793, on a quarrel with Pitt, he again 
resigned, went into private life, and died in September, 1806. He was a good 
lawyer, but brusque in bis manners, —Charles Pratt (afterward Harl of Cam- 
den) was the son of Sir John Pratt, Chief-Justice of the King’s Bench in the 
time of George I., and was born in 1714. He slowly but gradually-got into 
business at the bar. In 1757, he was appointed Attorney-General, at the :in- 
stance of the elder Pitt, and entered Parliament. In 1761, he was made Chief 
Justice of the Common Pleas, and sgon showed his independence by deciding, 
in the case of Wilkes, that general warrants were illegal. In 1765, the Rock- 
ingham Ministry called him to the Upper House, as Lord Camden. As 2 peer, 
his course was independent, and he denied the right of Great Britain, as claimed 
by the Government, “‘to impose laws upon the American colonies in all cases 
whatsoever.” In July, 1766, Lord Camden was made Lord-Chancellor. In 
1770, opposing’ his colleagues in the Ministry, who were hurrying the crisis 
with America, Lord Camden quitied office. Here ceased his judicial career, 
but he was a political combatant for twenty-four years longer —always con- 
demning the war with America, always defending the liberty of the subject. 
In 1782, ho entered the Rockingham Ministry as President of the Council, 
which, with a slight interval under the Coalition Ministry, he continvied to hold 
until his death. He was created Earl and Viscount in 1786, and died in April, 
1794, aged eighty. He was one. of the grentest constitutional lawyers England 
ever possessed. —John Scott, afterward Earl of Eldon, was born in 1751. His 
elder brother, afterward Lord Stowell, was born six years earlier. John Scott 
was educated at Oxford, where he obtained a fellowship in 1767, which he for- 
feited in 1772 (celibacy being imposed upon the fellows of English colleges), ©

Plunket rises. You are deeply attentive, rather from curios: 
ity to witness a display of hopeless dexterity, than from ‘any 
uncertainty about the event: He commences by some general 
undisputed ‘principle of law, that seems perhaps, at the first 
view, not to bear the remotest relation tothe matter in contro- 
versy; but to this he appends another and another, until by a 
regular series of connected propositions, he brings it down to 
the very point before the court; and insists, nay demonstrates, 
that the court can not decide against- him without violating 
one of its own most venerated maxims. Nothing ean be more 
masterly than the manner in which all this is done. There is 
for the Vinerian professor; and, ludicrously enough, the first lecture was on the 
statute 4 and 5 Philip and Mary, ch. 8: “ Of young men running away with maid- 
ens.” He had one hundred and forty students as auditors, all of whom giggled, 
as well they might, at the differenco*between the professor's theory and ‘prac: 
tice. Called to: the bar in 1776, Scott joined the Northern Circuit, for some 
years with ill-success, In 1780, the reversal of one of the Master of the Rolls’ 
judgments, by Lord-Chancellor Thurlow, upon Scott’s argument, drew him into 
notice. Further success, before a committee of the Commons, on an election 
case, which lasted fifteen days (with a retainer of fity guineas, a daily fee 
of ten guinéas, and an evening-consultation fee of five guineas), gave him repu- 
tation, as well as money~and hope. In 1783, he was made King’s Counsel, 
with Erskine. At this time he entered Parliament, where he and Erskine. 
made their maiden speeches in the same debate, but on opposite sides— Scott 
- opposing and Erskine defending Fox’s India Bill, In 1788, he was made So- 
licitor-General, and knighted —and Attorney-General in 1793, which office he 
retained to the year 1799, conducting the state trials of Horne Tooke, Hardy, 
“and Thelwall, for high-treason. Ju July, 1799, he became Chief-Justice of the 
Common Pleas; and was created Baron Eldon, He was then making between 
ten and twelve thousand pounds sterling a year by his practice ;. but if the salary 
of a Judge was much less, so was the labor. In this new capacity, he proved 
himself in every respect equal to the duties. In 1801, he became Lord-Chan- 
cellor, by the King’s owi request, and, abandoned the Common Pleas with re- 
gret. In February, 1806, when the Grenville and Fox Cabinet came in, Lord 
Eldon quitted office, was succeeded by Lord Erskine, and returned in April, 
1807; to continue until 1827, when Canning became Premier, and Sir John 
Copley, then created Lord Lyndhurst, received the Great Seal. In 1821, Lord 
Eldon was made Earl and Viscount. Asa Judge, he néver had a superior, if 
he bad an equal, in Westminster Hall. His fault was delay, caused ‘by his

#éhtation of ingenuity and research. Everything i is clear; 
fe, and familiar : you assent without a struggle to each 
séparate-conclusion. It is only when you are brought to the 
ultimate result, that you startle at discovering the consummate 
skill of the logician, who, by wily and imperceptible ap- 
proaches; has gained.a vantage- -point from which he can 
descend ‘upon his adversaries, and compel them to abandon a 
position that was deemed impregnable. 
“But Lords Hardwicke, Thurlow, Camden, Eldon, &c., are 
said to be against him. The advocate accordingly proceeds 
to examine each of these authorities in detail; he analyses 
their language; by distinctions that seem natural and obvious, 
but which in reality are most subtile, he shows how capable it 
is of various interpretations; he confronts the construction 
contended for by conflicting decisions of the same judges on 
other and similar occasions; he points out unsuspected anom- 
alies that would arise from adopting the interpretation of his — 
adversaries, and equally unsuspected accordances with general 
principles, that would follow his own. He thus goes on until, 
~ by reiterated processes of matchless sagacity, he has either 
neutralized ‘or brought over to-support himself, all the author 
ities upon which his opponents most firmly relied ; and he:sits 
down, leaving the court, if not a convert to his opinion, at 
least grievously perplexed to detect and explain the fallacies 
upon which it rests. 
Mr. Plunket is not said to be a » profound lawyer ; he cites 
fewer cases than any other counsel at the Irish bar; and on 
common occasions, frequently contents himself with merely 
commenting upon those adduced against him. His supremacy 
is altogether intellectual. He. leaves to others the technical 
drudgery of wading through tomes and indexes in search of 
legal saws and “ modern. instances.” The moment a question 
is submitted to him, his mind intuitively applies all the great 
principles that are favorable or hostile: these he has firmly 
fixed, and scientifically arranged in his memory, and so far 
may be said to benever unprepared. For the rest he-depends 
upon the resources of a talent that never fails him— upon his 
registless vigor, where he is right and sincere — upon his formi-

dable ingenuity and sophistry, where he can not venture to. be 
candid —upon his extemporaneous power of going through the 
most intricate processes of thought with all the ease and famil- 
iarity of ordinary discourse; and most of all, upon a rapid 
apprehension, which grasps and secures the entire of any prop- 
osition of which a single particle may chance to flit across 
his mind—a perfection of faculty that enables him to draw 
the most unexpected conclusions from the topics adduced 
against him, and thus. to render all the.industry of his antag- 
onists subservient to his own occasions. 
This, though an imperfect sketch, will convey-some general 
ideas of this eminent advocate; but there is one peculiarity 
in his powers, which to be adequately comprehended must be 
actually witnessed. I allude to his capacity (in which he ex- 
ceeds every public speaker I ever heard) of pouring out, I would 
almost say indefinitely, a continuous, unintermitted volume 
of thought-and language. In this respect, I look upon Mr. 
Plunket’s going through a long and important argument in the 
Court of Chancery to be a most extraordinary exhibition of 
human intellect. For hours he will go on and on, with un- 
wearied rapidity, arguing, defining, illustrating, separating in- 
tricate facts, laying down subtile distinctions, prostrating an 
objection here-pouncing upon a fallacy there, then retracing 
his steps, and restating in some original point of view his gen- 
eral proposition; then flying off again to the outskirts of the 
question, and dealing his desultory blows with merciless reit- 
eration wherever an inch of ground remains to be cleared ; and 
during the whole of this, not only does not his vigor flag for a 
single instant, but his mind does not even. pause for a second 
for a topic, an idea, or an expression. This velocity of- crea- 
tion, arrangement, and delivery, is quite astonishing; and what 
adds to your wonder is, that it appears'to be achieved without 
an effort, Mass after mass of argument is thrown off, convey- 
ed in phraseology vigorous, appropriate, and succinct, while 
the speaker, as if the mere minister and organ of some hidden 
power, that saves him the cost of laborious exertion, appears 
solely anxious to impress upon others his own reliance upon 
the force of what seems to come unsought.
-P-A-G-E-109
108 WILLIAM OONYNGHAM PLUNKET. 
This singular command over his great powers, coupled with 
his imposing exterior and masculine intonations, gives extra- 
ordinary weight to all he says.- From his unsuspected eatnest- 
ness of tone and manner, you would often imagine that his 
zeal for his client was only secondary to a deeper anxiety 
that the court should not violate the uniformity of its decisions 
. by establishing a precedent fraught with anomaly and danger, 
while the authoritative ease and perspicuity with which he 
states and illustrates his opinions gives him the air, as it were, 
of some high legal functionary appearing on behalf of the pub- 
lic, not so much to debate the question before the court as to 
testify to the law that should decide it. So that in respect to 
this quality of apparent conviction and good faith, we may 
_ well apply to Mr. Plunket the words of Cicero in commenda: 
tion of one of the ancient orators of Rome; nor will the illns- 
tration be found to fail from any want of coincidence in the 
personal characters of the two men: “ Jn Scauri oratione, sar 
“ pientis hominis: et recti, gravitas summa et naturalis quedam 
anerat auctoritas, non et causam, sed ut testimonium dicere~pu- 
tares.* 
‘But although My. Plunket is thus skilful in giving plausibil- 
ity to” yeasonings that do not: satisfy himself, I think it just 
to add (what I have heard asserted) that even his own fine 
understanding is often the dupe of his other faculties, and that, 
in the hurry and fervor of. argumentation, his judgment, with 
all its vigilance, can not escape the snares his ingenuity has 
weaved for others. I have even fancied at times (when in the 
course of a cause some unexpected point of law is started) that 
T have observed his argumentative devices in the very act of 
imposing themselves upon his mind as irrefutable conclusions. 
He rises to make, perhaps, a single observation, and is about 
to resume his place, when a new topic in support of his argu- 
ment flasheg across his mind. As he proceeds to state it; fresh . 
principles and illustrations crowd in to defend him in his posi- 
* “The speeches of Scaurus, who was a wise and virtuous man, were distin- 
guished by the utmost dignity, and by a certain natural imposing authority 
which led his audience to suppose that he appenred less in the character of ¢ an

tion:: an. incidental remark is thus expanded into an elaborate 
piece of reasoning, during the progress of whieh he gradually 
becomes more confident and earnest, until, from the intense 
ardor with which he follows up each successive advantage, he 
finally works himself into a conviction that all the merits of 
the question are on his side. * 
. But it is only when he is the retained advocate of a particu- 
lar party, wlfose claims he hag to sustain in open court, that 
Mr. Plunket is subject to this species of mental deception. In 
the cold and cautious meditation of the closet, when he has to 
pronounce upon a disputable case submitted for his opinion, 
the predominance of his argumentative powers operates upon ~ 
his judgment in quite another way. Instead of rushing to 
hasty conclusions, he finds a difficulty in coming to any con- 
clusion at all. The very perfection of some of his faculties, his 
sagacity, his subtilty, and his intuitive perception of the re- 
motest consequences of any given premise, which render him 
80 powerful as an advocate, have in this case only the effect 
of encumbering him with equal arguments and ‘equal difficul- 
ties‘on either side, and thus of keeping his mind in a state of 
logical suspense. This fact is well known, and the conse- 
quence (I speak ‘from general report) is, that in this department 
of his profession his practice is utterly disproportioned to his 
. great experience and his unrivalled estimation. 
The effect of Mr. Plunket’s powers is greatly aided by his 
external appearance.* His frame is tall, robust, and compact. 
* Charles Phillips has thus sketched Plunket in his prime: “Who is that 
square-built, solitary, ascetic-looking person, pacing to and fro, his hands crossed 
behind his back, so apparently absorbed in self— the observer of all, yet the 
companion of none? It is easy to designate the man, but difficult adequately 
to delineate the character. Perhaps never was a person to be estimated less by 
appearances ;. he is precisely the reverse of what he feels; externally cold, yet 
ardent in his nature; in manner repulsive, yet warm, sincere, and steadfast in his 
friendships; severe in aspect, yet in reality social and companionable — that is 
. Plunket —a man of the foremost rank, a wit, a jurist, a statesman, an orator, a 
Jogician—the Irish Gysippus! as Curran called him! in whom are concentrated 
all the energies and all the talents of the country. Eminent at the bar, it is in 
Parlioment we sce his faculties in their fullest development. Yet, in the Irish 
House-of Commons, his chief displays were on a single quostion—that of the 
Union; and in the British Parliament—that of the Roman Catholie question.”—M.

His-face is one of the most. striking: T ever saw; and yet the 
peculiarity lies so much more in the expression than the out- 
line, that I find it not easy: to describe it. The features on © 
the whole are blunt and harsh. There is extraordinary breadth - 
and capacity of forehead; and when. the brows are raised in 
~ the act of thought, it becomes intersected’ with an infinite series. 
of parallel lines and folds, Neither the eyes nor brows dre 
particularly expressive; nor indeed can I say that any of the 
other features would. singly indicate the character of the man, 
if I except a peculiar muscular largeness and rigidity about. 
the mouth and lips, from which you may collect, that smiling” 
has “ never been their occupation.” * 
The general character of Mr. Plunket’s countenance is deep 
seriousness—an expression that becomes more strongly mark 
ed from. the unvarying pallor that overspreads his features. 
It-is literally “the pale cast of thought.” Some have aceused 
his physiognomy as being unsocial and austere. To me it ap- 
peared that the signs of those qualities have been confounded 
with the nattyral and now indelible traces of a grave and vig- 
orous intellect, habitually absorbed in masculine investigations; - - 
and preferring to dwell in the midst of its own thoughts. Nor 
do.I find anything repelling in the circumstance that his fea- 
tures seldom descend for a moment from their dignity. -Know- 
ing what his mind and his history have been, I am prepared 
for what I meet. I find no flashes of sensibility, no play of 
shifting or conflicting emotions, but a calm constitutional sever- 
ity of aspect, importing a mind conscious of its powers; and 
vigilantly keeping them in unremitted discipline against the 
daily task that awaits them.* 
_* Phillips truly says, that Plunket’s “ style. was peculiar, and almiost quite 
divested of the characteristics generally to be found in that of his countrymen. 
. Strong, cogent reasoning — plain but deep sense — earnest feeling and imagery, 
seldom intygduced except to press the reasoning or to illustrate it, were the 
distinguishing features of his eloquence: he by no means rejected ornajnent, 
bat he used it severely and spariigly; and though it produced the effect, it was 
not directly, but rather collaterally and incidentally. He always. seemed to 
speak for a purpose, never for mere display; and his wit, like his splendor, aps . 
peared to be struck out by the collision of.the moment. In this, indeed, his 
art was superlative. There were passages which could not have been flung off -

HIS MANNER. 111 
1 : 
T expected to have found a tinge of melancholy in Mr. Plun- 
ket’s features——such ag I had observed in Grattan and some 
other eminent Irishmen, who had attended the Parliament of 
their country. in its last moments, and who could find nothing 
in after-life to console them for the loss. -I often heard Mr. 
Grattan speak upon that-event.- I- never found him more 
eloquent or interesting than when, in a circle of his private 
friends, he poured, out his-indignation against a measure that 
had baffled all his hopes, and his unavailing regret that he 
had been too confiding at a conjuncture when it was possible 
to have averted. the disaster. But I could discern no traces 
of similar sentiments in Mr. Plunket’s looks. He was, how- 
ever, a much younger man, and could form new views and 
attachments, nor is.it, perhaps, surprising, that at this distance 
of time he should not revert with sadness to an event, which 
in its consequences has opened to him so much larger a field 
for the exhibition of his powers. - 
Mr. Plunket’s manner is not rhetorical —it i is (what I con- 
sider much better) vigorous, natural, and earnest. He has no 
variety of gesture, and what he uses seems perfectly unstudied. 
He is evidently so thoroughly‘absorbed in his subject, as to be 
quite unconscious that he has hands and arms to manage. He 
-has-a habit, when he warms, as he always and quickly does, 
of firmly closing both hands, raising them slowly and simul- 
taneously above his head, and then suddenly striking them 
down-with extraordinary force. The action is altogether pn- 
extempore, and must have heen the result of very elaborate preparation.’ — 
Many of his isolated passages are beautiful. In a parliamentary speech on the 
Catholic Claims, in 1821, speaking of the great departed who had joined in 
discussions, hé said, “ Walking before the sacred images of the illustrious dead, 
as in a public and solemn procession, shall we not dismiss all party feeling, all 
angry passions, all unworthy prejudices? I will not talk of past disputes; I 
will not mingle in this act of national justice anything that can awaken per- 
sonal animosity.” It was the speech of which this is an atom whigh actually 
converted nine hostile votes on the Catholic Question, in the British House of 
Commons. The late Sir James Macintosh, who had heard all the great ora- 
tors—from Pitt, Sheridan, Burke, and Fox, to Brougham, Canning, Sheil, and 
Macaulay—repeatedly said, that if Plunket had been regularly trained toa 
British House of Commons, he would have been the grentest speaker there 
that he ever remembered.— M. :

graceful; but its strength, and I would even add, its appro- 
priateness to the man and to his stern simplicity of character 
and style, atone for itsinelegance. Besides, this very disdain 
of the externals of oratory has something imposing in it: you - 
are,made to feel that you are in the presence of a powerful 
mind that looks to itself alone, and you surrender yourself 
more completely to its guidance from the conviction that no 
hackneyed artifice has been employed to allure your confi- 
dence. 
Mr. Plunket’s delivery, as already mentioned, is uncommonly 
rapid, but his articulation is at the same time so distinct that I 
seldom lose a word. In calm discussion his intonations are 
deep, sonorous, and dignified: when he becomes animated, his 
voice assumes a higher pitch, and the tones, though always 
natural and impressive, are occasionally shrill. His extem- 
poraneous powers of expression are not to be described by the 
common term, fluency. It is not merely over words: and 
phrases, but over every possible variety of construction, that 
he. appears to hold an absolute command —the consciousness 
. of this .power‘often involves him in grammatical difficulties. 
He allows a thought to drift along into the midst of obstruc- 
tions, from which no outlet can be descried, as if for the mere 
purpose of surprising you by his adroitness when he discovers 
the danger, steering it in safety throngh all the straits and 
intricacies of speech—or by the boldness with which he forces 
a passage if he can not find one. But it is only over argumen- 
tative diction that he has acquired this mastery: when_he 
calls in the aid of sentiment and passion to enforce his logic, 
his phraseology labors, and, if the passage be unpremeditated, 
“frequently falls short of the strength and dignity of the con- 
ception. . But his deficiency in this respect evidently procecds 
from want of practice, not of capacity; nor does the exertion 
that it gosts him to supply appropriate language ever restrain 
him from illustrating a legal argument by any bold Practical 
figure that may cross his mind.*

ness to imagery that prevails in the Irish courts. The question turned upon

HIS PARLIAMENTARY CAREER. " 113 
Mr. Plunket is a memorable, and I believe, a, solitary in- 
stance of an,eminent barrister whose general reputation has 
- been increased by his parliamentary efforts.* His speeches 
had been in undisturbed enjoyment of the right for two centuries; the opposite 
party called upon them to show their original title. Mr. P. insisted upon the 
legal presumption, arising from this long possession, that the title had been 
originally a good one, though the deeds that had created it had been lost, and 
consequently could not be produced. In commenting upon the necessity and 
wisdom of such a rule of law, without which few properties of ancient standing 
could be secure, he observed —“ Tine is the great destroyer of evidence, but 
he is also the great protector of titles. If he comes with a scythe in one hand 
to mow down the muniments of our possessions, he holds an hour-glass, in the 
other, from which he incessantly metes out the portions of duration that are to 
render those muniments no longer necessary.”’ [Lord Brougham, who intro- 
duced this extract into his sketch of Grattan, eulogized ithighly.” In the equity 
case, which drew forth the speech in which it sparkled, Plunket was. retained 
by Trinity College, which sought to recover the right of presentation to the 
living of Clonee. Mr Johnston, called ‘‘ Bitter Bob,” was his opponent, with 
a bad case and large fee. After Johnston had been voluble for some time, 
Plunket, assuming a ludicrous expression of surprise, questioned the relevancy 
of whut he said, and asked ‘“‘ Does the learned gentleman mean to rely upon 
prescription or upon law?” Taken by surprise and conscious that he could not 
rest upon prescription, Johnston hastily answered “Oh! most certainly upon 
law.” Plunket immediately asked, with mock gravity, “ Well, then, where is 
your law?” Utterly confounded by the directness and suddenness of the ques- 
tion, Johnston faltered out “I don’t know,” and sat down, half crying. It was 
confession at once true and candid. — M.] 
* There were many predictions of Plunket’s failure in the Imperial Parlia- 
ment. What Grattan had said of Flood, that an oak of the forest was too old 
to be transplanted at fifty, was quoted against him—though he was no more 
than six-and-thirty when the Union took place. Plunket, in the British, was 
not the fervid orator he had been in the Irish Parliament. He knew that he 
had a different audience, and accommodated himself to it. He imitated no 
speaker there—he could not be compared with any. His first speech in 1807, 
on the Catholic question, was a fine specimen of solid reasoning and rich elo- 
quence, and of logical argument and historical facts. It placed Plunket in the 
foremost rank of modern orators. From that time until he returned to Parlia- 
‘ment six years after, he confined himself to his profession. His own Univer: 
sity, justly proud of him, sent him back to Patliament; and in 1813, 2s 
well as again in 1814, Plunket spoke on the Catholic question, and only on that 
subject. ° One of his incidental sarcasms, in 1814, was polished and keen? Ad- 
dressing the Speaker (Abbott), who had, ex-officio, to return the thanks of the 
House, to’ Wellington, he said, “ But you, sir, while you were binding the 
wreath round the brow of the conqueror, assured him that his victorious follow- 
ers must, never expect. to participate in the fruits of their valor, but that at they

on the Union, in the Irish House of Commous, raised him at 
once to the first class of parliamentary orators. When he was 
returned by the University of Dublin (in 1812) to the imperial 
_ senate, Curran publicly predicted that his talents would create 
_ a similar sensation here: I need not add how completely the 
prophecy has been fulfilled. It would lead me too far to enter 
into a minute examination of Mr. Plunket’s parliamentary style 
and manner; in many points I should have to repeat some of 
the foregoing remarks, I can not, however, forbear to observe, 
that his language and views in the House of Commons discover 
amind that has thoroughly escaped the noxious influence of 
his. professional habits. He has shown that it is possible for 
the same person to be a most subtle and dexterous disputant 
upon a technical subject, and a statesman-like reasoner ‘upon 
a comprehensive one. __ 
“With regard to his political tenets—his opposition to the 
Union, his connection with the Whig administration of 1806, 
and his subsequent exertions in favor of Catholic Emancipa-. 
tion, seem to have placed him on the list of Irish patriots ;- but ~ 
. his support of popular privileges, where he has supported them, 
appears to be entirely unconnected with popular sympathies— 
his patriotism is a conclusion, not-a passion. In all questions 
between the people and the state, it is easy to perceive that he 
identifies himself with the latter;. he never, like Fox and 
Grattan,” flings himself in imagination, into the popular ranks, 
who had shed their blood in achieving the conquest were the only Persons who. 
were never to share the profits of success in the rights of citizens.” This ap- 
pears to be the germ of Sheil’s striking and brilliant address to Lord Hardinge, 
with reference to the aid given in the field by Irish Catholics. —M. 
* Henry Grattan, the most eminent Irishman of his time, was born in-1746, ~ 
in-Dublin. Educated in Dublin University, he became. a law-student.of the 
Middle Temple in 1767, was called to the bar in 1772, and became member 
for Charlemont in 1775, for which town he dst until 1790, when he was elected 
by the citizens of Dublin. In 1797, he did not again become a candidate. In 
1800, he was returned for Wicklow, to oppose the Union, From 1805 he was 
a member of the Imperial Parliament, and.was the earnest and able champion 
of the Catholics, to his dying day. He found his ‘country a province—he i made 
ita nation; he found it the prey of a rapacious oligarchy —he raised it to. ‘inde- 
pendence ; to use his own striking words, ‘‘he sat by its cradle, he followed its 
hearse.” Grattan was the life and soul of the struggle for Irish independence,

to march at their head, and in their name, and as one of them, 
to demand 4 recognition of their rights. Mr. Pluiket has not 
1782. His eloquence was great, in a country where every man can freely and 
suitably express himself in public, His courage was indomitable, and, in truth, 
his sarcasm needed such support, The people, grateful, gladly confirmed the 
grant of fifty thousand pounds sterling made to him by the Parliament: he had 
refused the proposed sum of one hundred thousand pounds. With this he 
bought Tinnahinch, in the county of Wicklow, where he lived, as Moore said— 
“Mid the trees which a nation had given, and which bowed 
As if each brought a new civic crown for his head.” 
His last efforts in the Irish Parliament were against the Union. In the British 
House of Commons, in 1804, Fox placed him on the seat next his own; and his 
first speech, in favor of Fox’s motion on the Catholic question, and in reply to 
Dr.. Duigenan, who had imported his intolerance to London, was answered by 
Spencer Percival, the Minister, who greatly complimented its brilliancy. In 
England, Grattan was more subdued than in his own land in former years, and 
Curran smartly said that “indeed he had brought his club into the English 
House of Commons, but took care, beforehand, to pare off its knobs.” He 
advocated the Catholic claims, by appointment, until 1815, when Sit Henry 
Parnell was intrusted with the conduct of the measure. His popularity had so 
much faded, that he was assailed, at the general election in 1818, by a mob in 
Dublin, and narrowly escaped with life. In 1819, his motion for a committee 
on the Catholic claims was lost by a majority of only two. In June, 1820, he 
hurried over, weak in health, and worn by seventy-four years, to present the 
Catholic petition once more—but died before he could do it. His remains 
found interment in Westminster Abbey, next to those of Mr. Fox. His person 
was short and clumsy, with disproportionably long arms; his voice shrill and 
badly managed; his manner artificial, his action vehement and uonatural—but 
his diction, or wardrobe of words, was rich in the extreme; his language full 
of epigram and antithesis; his sentences harmonious and forcible; his powers 
of attack and defence never equalled. The brilliant character of Grattan’s ora- 
tory was thus indicated by Moore, in one of his Irish Melodies: — 
““ Who, that ever hath heard him—hath drunk at the source 
Of that wonderful eloquence, all Erin’s own, 
In whose high-thoughted daring, the fire and the force, 
And the yet untamed spring of her spirit, are shown? 
* An eloquence rich, wheresoever its wave 
Wandered free and triumphant, with thoughts that shone through, 
As clear as the brook’s ‘stone of lustre,’ and gave, 
With the flash of the gem, its solidity too.” 
Grattan was a politician, but not a statesman. Yet, from 1775 until 1800, 
the history of Grattan is the history of Ireland. His son has published an ex- 
cellent Memoir of him, and had previously edited his speeches. Undoubtedly 
Grattan’ ‘was a remarkable man—one of the master-spirits of his age. —M.

témperament for this. He studiously keeps aloof froin the 
multitude, and even when their strenuous advocate, lets it be 
séen that he thinks for them, not with them—he never warms 
into “the man of the people.” His most animated appeals in 
their behalf retain the tone of a just and enlightened aristocrat, 
gravely and earnestly remonstrating with the members of his 
own body, upon the danger and inexpediency of holding out 
against the immutable and unconquerable instincts of human 
nature. . 
- The only exception that I recollect.to these remarks, occurs 
in his speeches against the Union. There hé boldly plunged 
into first principles ; ; as, among other instances, when he ex- 
claimed, “I, in the most express terms, deny the competency 
of Parliament to do this act—I warn you, do net dare to lay 
your hand on the Constitution. I tell you that if, cireum- 
stanced as you are, you pass this act, if will be a nullity, and 
that no man in Ireland will be bound to obey it. I make the | 
assertion deliberately —I repeat it—and I call on any man 
who hears me to take down my words: you have not been 
elected for this purpose — you are appointed to make laws, and 
not legislatures. You are: appointed to act under the consti- 
tution, not to alter it; to exercise the functions of legislators, _ 
and not to transfer them: and if you do so, your act’ is a 
dissolution of the government; you resolve society into its. 
original elements, and no man in the land is bound to obey. 
you.” . Yet even here, and in some bolder declarations on the 
same occasion, I am inclined to suspect that Mr. Plunket’ 
assumed this indignant tone, rather as a member of the assem- 
bly whose independence was assailed, than from any impas- 
sioned sympathy with the general rights of the body that he 
represented.. Had the question been-a popular reform, in- 
stead of the extinction of the Trish parliament, he would, in 
all likelihood, have been equally vehement in resisting the 
innovation. 
-Mr. Plunket’s general reading is said to be limited; and 
if we may judge from the rareness of his allusions to the great 
~ writers of ancient and modein times, the opinion is not un: 
founded. When he was about to appear in the British parlia-
-P-A-G-E-118

ment in 1812, it was whispered among his friends, that he 
prepared. himself with information on the general state of 
European politics from the most ordinary sources: he wanted 
facts, and he took the shortest and easiest method of collecting 
them. LEhave understood that, up to a recent period, he fre- 
quently employed his leisure hours upon some elementary 
treatise of pure mathematics. If the fact be so, it affords a 
striking proof of the vigor of a mind which could find a relax- 
ation in such a pursuit.* 
- Ihave already glanced at a resemblance between Mr. ‘Plun- 
ket and the late Sir Samuel Romilly. If I were to pursue the 
comparison into the private characters of the two men, the 
points of. similarity would multiply, and in no particular more 
strikingly than in the softness and intensity of their domestic 
affections. But this is sacred ground: yet I can not forbear 
to mention that it fell to my lot (when last in Ireland), sitting 
as a public auditor in the gallery of the Court of Chancery, 
to witness a burst of sensibility, which, coming from such a 
man as Mr. Plunket, and in such a place, sent an electric thrill 
of sympathy and respect through the breasts of the audience. 
An aged lady, on the day after her husband’s death, had 
signed a paper, resigning her right to a portion of property 
* Although Plunket, as his aspect showed, was of a saturnine temperament, 
he was not above enjoying and even making a joke. Once, at a dinner with 
Dr Magee, Archbishop of Dublin, otfe of the company was a pedantic collegian, 
who asked his host whether he had heard of the difference between Brinkley 
(afterward Bishop of Cloyne) and Pond, respectively Astronomers Royal of 
Ireland and England. “ Brinkley,” said the bore, “‘ contends that the parallax 
of a Lyre is three seconds; Pond says it is only two,—and the dispute is vio- 
Jent.” Plunket, who was one of the party, quietly remarked “ Ah, sir, it must 
be a very bad quarrel, when the seconds can not agree.” —When the Grenyille 
Ministry was formed, in 1806, Charles Kendal Bushe, suspected of being a wa- 
verer, absented himself from Court, on the ground that he was cabinet-making. 
The excuse transpired, and Plunket said ‘“‘ Bushe will beat me at that—I am 
neither a joiner nor a turner."—After quitting the Common Pleas, in 1827, to 
take the Great Seal, he was told that his successors had little or nothing to do. 
“ Well,” said he, “they're equal to it.” He could even joke at his own ex- 
pense, On his enforced retirement, in 1841, to make way for Lord Campbell, 
a great storm arose on the day of bis successor’s expected urrival, a friend said, 
how sick of his promotion the voyage must have made him. “ Yes,” said 
Plunket, with a sardonic smile, “but it won't make him throw up the Seals.— M.

to which she became entitled by his decease; and the ques- 
tion was, whether her mind at the.time was perfectly calm and. 
collected. Mr. Plunket insisted that it was not in human na- 
ture that she could be so at such a crisis. — “ She had received 
a blow such as stuns the strongest.minds: after a union of half 
a century, of uninterrupted affection, to find the husband, the 
friend, the daily companion, suddenly called away for ever |” 
He was proceeding to describe the first anguish and pertur- 
bation of spirit that must befall the survivor of such a relation, 
when he-suddenly recognised in the picture all that he had 
himself a little while, before endured. The recollection quite 
subdued him-—he faltered, and became inarticulate even to 
sobbing. I can not describe the effect produced throughout 
the court. 
I have thus attempted to present a sketch of this eminent 
Trishman*—in matters of intellect, unquestionably the most 
* Lord Plunket, who was born in 1764, is now (1854) in his ninetieth year. 
Brought into the Irish Parliament by the Earl of Charlemont he bitterly de- 
nounced the contemplated Union, and was violently personal on the Irish Sec: 
retary, Lord Castlereagh, who managed the ministerial details. His Lordship,. 
a handsome mari (who, Sir Walter Scott thought, was the most distinguished- 
looking personage at the Coronation in 1821, as he walked, unaccompanied, ia 
the full:dress of a Knight of the Garter), had been married for some years to the: 
young and lovely daughter of the Earl of Buckinghamshire, and it was: their. 
misfortune to be childless. During a debate, when Lady Castlereagh was pres- 
ent, Plunket concluded a personal attack on her husband by saying, “I cain not+- 
believe that that constitution, the foundations of which were laid by the wisdom 
of ages, and cemented by the blood of patriotic heroes, is to be smitten to its: 
centre by such @ green and sapless twig as this!” The venom of the stroke,: 
imputing political and insinuating personal imbecility, was deeply felt. After 
the Union, Plunket fought side by side with Curran, on the popular side ;: but,. 
in 1803, he appeared against Robert Emmett, as already mentioned. After the 
Union, also, he had unsticcessfully been a parliamentary candidate for the Univer- 
sity of Dublin. In 1806, the death of Pitt admittgd the Whigs to office. Self= 
boasting as they bad been, the soubriquet of ‘All the Talents” was given to 
their official capacity. In 1807, they quitted place, and Plunket, who would 
have been retained by their successors if he pleased, went out with them} nor 
did he again assume office unti! 1822, when (at the instance of the same Lord 
Castlereagh whom he had formerly attacked, but who desired parliamentary ~ 
assistance. against the hollow friendship. of Canning and the open hostility of Brougham) he succeeded Mr. Saurin .as Attorney-General. He had previ-.

a hasty sketch, I should feel that I have been unjust. to him. 
Some of his powers —his wit and irony, for example, in both | 
of which he excels, and his cutting and relentless sarcasm, 
where vice and folly are to be exposed — have been altogether 
unnoticed ; but his is the “ versatile ingenium,” and, in offering 
the result of my observations upon it, I have been compelled 
to select rather what I could best describe, than what I most 
the Manchester riots of 1819. As first Irish law-officer of the Crown, Plunket 
did not appear to advantage. When a bottle was flung at the Viceroy, in the 
theatre, Plunket hastily indicted the rioters for high-treason, and as hastily 
withdrew the indictment before trial. His bills of indictment were ignored, 
bis ex-offeio prosecutions defeated, and. his Otange antagonists cheaply obtained 
the honor of political martyrdom. In 1827, when a new Premier was necessary, 
on the illness of Lord Liverpool, Canning was appointed, and thought so highly. 
of Plunket as to offer him a peerage, a seat in the Cabinet, and the high office 
of Master of the Rolls-in England. Plunket was actually appointed, but the 
English bar, declaring that Westminster Hall must supply the new Judge, inti- 
mated that they would not plead before Plunket. The end was that he became 
Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas in Ireland, instead of Master of the Rolls 
in England—and became a peer ss ‘‘ Baron Plunket, of Newton, County of 
Cork.” By his speeches and his vote, he assisted in the Emancipation Bill of 
1829; and when the Whigs took office, in 1830, Earl Grey made him Lord- 
Chancellor of Ireland, a position which he retained until December, 1834, when 
Sir Robert Peel, on the change of Ministry, appointed Sir Edward Sugden (now 
Lord St. Leonards, and late Lord-Chancellor of England), an English barrister 
of great ability. In April, 1835, Plunket resumed the Irish Chancellorship, 
and retained it until June, 1841. The Melbourne Ministry, then within three 
months of its dissolution, wished to provide for Sir John Campbell, who had 
been in office nine years. His wife had already been appointed a peeress in 
her own right (Baroness Stratheden), but he desired for himself the retiring 
pension of four thousand. pounds sterling always given to an ex-Chancellor. 
Accordingly, Lord Plunket, whose judicial career had been highly satisfactory, 
received a hint that he must retire! Plunket, recollecting how the English 
bar had refused him, was reluctant to see an English lawyer, who knew nothing 
of equity, named as his successgr. He refused to retire, was informed that he 
would be dismissed if he did not, and finally resigned, stating the whole case in 
open Court, in his farewell address to the bar. He said he had no share in 
what had taken place, directly or indirectly, and entirely repudiated the change. 
Campbell, created a peer, heard a few motions as Chancellor, and went out, 
shortly after, on the large pension he had coveted. He is now Chief-Justice_ 
of England.—Lord Plunket retired into private life in 1841, and enjoys the 
four thousand pounds pension, and a large private fortune, earned by his pro- 
fessional labors. — M.

him in the situation most favorable to their perfect develop-- 
ment? If, instead of wasting them upon questions of tran- 
sitory interest, he had dedicated them solely to the purposes of 
general science —to metaphysics, mathematics, legislation, 
morals, or (what is but spoken science) to that best and rarest 
kind of eloquence, which awakes the passions only that they 
may listen to the voice of truth—to what a height and perma- 
nence of fame might they not have raised him?’ . 
These reflections perpetually force’ themselves upon Mr. 
Planket’s admirers : we lament to see the vigor of such a 
mind squandered upon a profession and a province. We are 
incessantly reminded that, high and successful as his career has 
deen, his opportunities have been far beneath his resources.

CHARLES KENDAL BUSHE. 
Tue name of Caartes Kenpat Busnz is not so extensively 
known as that of Plunket beyond the immediate field in which 
his talents (which are of the first order) have been displayed. 
But in Ireland it is almost uniformly associated with that of 
Plunket, by those who descant upon the comparative merits 
of their most distinguished advocates. The latter is better 
fitted to the transactions of ordinary business, and, in a pro- 
fession which is generally conversant with the details of com- 
mon life, exhibits a dexterity and astuteness which render him 
the most practical, and, therefore, the ablest man at the Bar. 
He is always upon a level with his subject, and puts forth his 
faculties, as if they were as subservient as his limbs to the do- 
minion of his will, in the most precise and minute adaptation 
to the purposes for which they may happen to be required. 
The self-control which his’ mind possesses in so high and rare 
a degree (and it is more difficult, perhaps, to men of true 
genius to descend from their native elevation than to persons 
of inferior endowments to raise their faculties to the height of 
a‘ great argument”) has given him an almost undisputed mas- 
tery in the discussion of* those topies which constitute the ha- 
bitual business of the Bar. His hearers are not conscious that 
he is in reality exercising his great powers while he addresses 
them in the plainest speech and apparently in-the most homely 
way. moa 
An acute observer would discover that his reasonings upon 
the most vulgar topic were the perfection of art, and that un- 
der. the: guise of simplicity he concealed the most insidious

sophistry, and subtleties the most acute. This seeming ingen- 
nousness is the consummation of forensic ability; and however 
“it is to be estimated in.a moral point of view, there can be no . 
doubt that at the Bar it is of incalculable use. Mr. Phinket 
is the chief sophist, and for that reason the most useful dis- 
putant in his profession; ‘and it must be confessed that the 
deliberations of a court of justice do not call so much for. the 
display of eloquence as for the ingenious exercise of the pow- 
ers of disputation. I am far from thinking Mr. Bushe deficient 
in refinement and dexterity; on the contrary, he would be 
conspicuous for those qualities unless when he is placed in 
comparison with the great arch-hypocrite of the Bar. But who 
could be his rival in that innocent simulation which constitutes 
the highest merit of a modern lawyer? The ingenuity of 
Bushe is too apparent. His angling is light and delicate ;+but 
the fly is too highly colored, and the hook glitters in the sun. 
In the higher departments of oratory he is, perhaps, equal: and . 
occasionally superior to Mr. Plunket, from the power and en- 
ergy of his incomparable manner; but in the discharge of com- 
mon business in a common way, he holds a second, though not 
exceedingly distant place. 
_ Mr. Bushe is the son of a clergyman of the established’ 
church, who resided at Kilmurry, in the county of Kilkenny, 
in the midst of the most elegant and most accomplished soci- 
ety in Ireland. He was in the enjoyment of a lucrative living, 
and being of an ancient family, which had established itself 
in Ireland in the reign of Charles the Second, he thought it 
incumbent upon him to live upon a scale of expenditure more 
consistent with Irish notions of dignity than with English 
maxims of economy and good sense. He was a man of refined: 
manners, and of polished if not of prudential habits, His son 
_ Charles imbibed from him an ardent love of literature, and had 
an opportunity from his familiar intercourse with the best com- 
pany in the kingdom, to acquire those graces of manner which 
render-him a model of elegance in private life, and which, in. 
the discharge of professional business, impart such a dignified 
suavity to his demeanor as to charm the senses before the un- 
derstanding is addressed. His mother was the sister of Major _

General Sir Johm Doyle,* and is said to have been a highly- 
cultivated woman. 
Mr. Bushe received his education in the University of Dub- 
lin, and, I may add, in the Historical Society which was estab- 
lished by the students for the cultivation of eloquence and of 
the arts which are connected with it. Although it derived ‘its 
appellation from the study of history, to which it was nomi- 
nally dedicated, the political situation of the country speedily 
directed its pursuits to the acquisition of the faculty of public 
speech; through which every man of talent expected to rise 
into eminence, at a period when oratory was the great staple 
commodity in the intellectual market. This institution rose 
of its. own accord out of the spontaneous ambition of the stu- 
dents of the University. So far from assisting its growth, the 
fellows of the college employed every expedient to repress it. 
In the true spirit of monks (and however they may differ in 
the forms of their faith, in their habits, and in the practical. 
results in which their principles are illustrated and embodied, 
the monks of all religions are inveterately the same), the sti- 
periors of the University took the society under their banefal 
protection. They attempted to hug it to death in their rugged 
and hirsute embrace. The students, however, soon became 
*The late General Sir John Doyle was private Secretary to the Prince of 
‘Wales for many years, when that profligate was taking a leading part in the 
“ Road to Ruin.” Doyle, who was then only a Major in the army, was an Irish- 
man and had distinguished himself by some clever opposition speeches in the 
Irish House of Commons.~-The Prince met him accidentally at a large party, 
was struck with his intelligence and vivacity, invited him to the Pavilion, at 
Brighton, and speedily offered him the most confidential post in his household. 
To his latest day, Doyle used to say that George, Prince of Wales, merited the 
title of “the first gentleman in Europe,” and it should be noted that he who 
“gave this opinion had spent all his life in the best society, at home and abroad. 
Doyle was awit. The Prince had gone to the opening of Parliament, wearing 
diamond epaulettes on his military uniform, At dinner, Doyle said he had 
been among the crowd, who much admired the Prince’s equipage, and that one 
of them, looking at the diamond epaulettes, said, “Tom, what amazing fine 
things the Prince has got upon his shoulders?” and the other had answered, 
“ Ay, fine enough, and they will soon be on our shoulders.” There was a 
smile all around the royal table, for freedom of speech was fully allowed there, 
and the Prince laughingly retorted, “ You rogue, that shaft could come from no 
bow but.your own,” M.

aware of the real objects of their interference, and were com- 
pelled, in order to preserve the institution from the conse- 
quences of so impure a connection, to recede from the Univer- 
sity, and hold their meetings beyond its walls. : 
Mr. Bushe had been,recently called to the Bar, but had not 
yet devoted himself to its severer studies with the strenuous © 
assiduity which is necessary for success in so laborious a pro- 
fession. But the fame which he had acquired in the society 
itself, induced its rebellious members to apply to him to pro- 
nounce a speech at the close of the first session which was 
held beyond the precincts of the college, for the purpose of 
giving the dignity and importance to their proceedings which 
they expected to derive from the sanetion of his distinguished 
name. Mr. Bushe acceded to the request, and pronounced a 
very eloquent oration, which Mr. Phillips has, I observe, inserted 
in his collections of “ Specimens of Irish Oratory." It is re- 
* This work, which, published in Dublin in 1819, was republished in Phila- 
delphia in 1820, is called “Specimens of Irish Oratory,” and contains, with 
very brief memoirs, examples of the oratory of Burke, Curran; Grattan, Sheri- 
dan, Burrowes, Bushe, Plunket, and Flood. Charles Phillips, born at Sligo, 
in 1788, graduated at Dublin University, and was called to the Irish bar in 
1812, where his florid oratory obtained him considerable practice in adultery, 
seduction, and breach-of-promise-of-marriage cases. He collected his speeches 
in oné volume in 1817, and they obtained a large sale. He also edited “‘Spe- 
cimens of Irish Eloquence,” wrote a poem called “The Emerald Isle,” and 
wrote ‘Recollections of Curran;” which speedily ran through two large edi- 
tions, and was reproduced in 1850, entirely recast, enlarged, and improved, as 
“ Qurran ‘and his Contemporaries,” which has gone into several editions, and 
was republished in New York, in 1851, Phillips went to the English bar, in 
1819, where his peculiar style of eloquence did not please. He obtained ex- 
tensive criminal practice, and adhered steadily to the liberal principles of his 
youth, In 1842, on the establishment of District Courts of Bankruptcy in Eng- 
land, the influence of his stanch friend Lord Brougham obtained him a com- 
missionership at Liverpool, with a salary of eighteen hundred pounds sterliag a 
year. He subsequently resigned this, and became one of the London ‘Com. . 
missioners of the Insolventa’ Court. It is matter for reproach, as well as regret, 
that, during the last ten or twelve years of comparative leisure, Phillips has done 
so little as a literary man—a calling in which he has so well acquitted: him- 
self, Curran, who much loved him, was fully sensible of the faults of Phillips’s' 
early oratory, and said: “There is much more of flower than figure or art;. more 
of fancy than design. It js like (as I suspect the mind of “the author to be) a tree 
in fall blossom: shake it and you have them on the ground in a minute, and it 
would take a season to reproduce them.” —M.

CHARACTER OF HIS ELOQUENCE. 125 
markable for purity and simplicity of style, and for an argu- 
mentative tone, which, in so young a man, who had hitherto 
exercised himself upon topics which invited a puerile declama- 
tion, and the discussion of which was a mere mockery of de- 
bate, afforded grounds for anticipating that peculiar excellence 
which he afterward attained. A few metaphors are inter- 
spersed, but they are not of the ordinary class of Irish illus- 
tration; and what was unavoidable in an assembly composed 
of insurgent students, an hyperbole is occasionally to be found 
in the course of this very judicious speech. But, taken as a 
whole, it bears the character of the mature production of a 
vigorous mind, rather than of the prolusion of a juvenile rhet- 
orician.* ° . 
This circumstance ‘is a little remarkable. ‘The passion for 
figurative decoration was at this time at its height in Ireland. 
The walls of the parliament house resounded with dithyram- 
bics, in which, at the same time, truth and nature were too 
frequently sacrificed to effect. The intellect of the country 
was in its infancy, and although it exhibited signs of athletic 
vigor, it was pleased with the gorgeous baubles which were 
held out for its entertainment. It is, therefore, somewhat sin- 
gular, that while a taste of this kind enjoyed so wide and 
almost universal a prevalence, My. Bushe should, at so early a 
period of his professional life, have manifested a sense of its 
imperfections, and have traced out for himself a course so dif- 
ferent from that which had been pursued by men whose genius 
had invested their vices with so much alluring splendor. 
This circumstance is partly, perhaps, to be attributed to the 
strong: instinet of propriety which was born with his mind, 
and, in some degree, to his having passed a considerable time 
out of Ireland, where he became conversant with models of a 
purer, if not of a nobler eloquence, than that which was culti- 
vated in the sister kingdom. He lived in France for some 
* The beautiful spgech which Bushe delivered from the chair of the Histor- 
ical Society, in closing its twenty-fourth session, in June, 1794, was published 
by Phillips in his “Specimens.” Bushe’s own copy of this book was annotated 
by himself in: 1827,and he has marked this speech as ‘‘ mostly puerile.” Some 
passages he noted as “ bad,” some “not good,” and only one as “ good."—Tn 
fact, he was very fastidious as to his own productions. — M.

years, among men of letters; and although the revolution had: 
subverted, in a gréat degree, the principles of literature as. 
~ well as of government, yet enough of relish for classical beauty” 
and simplicity had survived, among men who had received 
the advantages of education, to furnish him with the opportu- . 
nity, of which he so advantageously availed himself, of éulti=: 
vating a better style of expression than he would, in all 
probability, have adopted had he permanently resided in 
Treland. 
It may appear strange that I should partly attribute the 
eminencé in oratory to which Mr. Bushe has attained, to the 
Historical Society, after having stated that he deviated: so 
“widely from the tone of elocution which prevailed in that’ 
establishment, and in which, if there was little of childishness, ' 
there was much of boyhood. But, with all its imperfections, 
it must be recollected that such an institution afforded an oeca- 
sion for the practice of the art of public speaking, which is-as 
much, perhaps, the result of practical acquisition, as it is of 
natural endowment. A false ambition of ornament might pre- 
vail in its assemblies, and admiration might be won by verbose 
extravagance and boisterous inanity; but a man of genius 
must still have turned such an institution to account. He 
must have thrown out a vast quantity of ore, which time and 
civcumstance would afterward separate and refine. His fac- 
ulties must have been put into action, and he must have learned 
the art, as well as tasted the delight, of stirring the hearts 
and exalting the minds of a large concourse of men. The 
physique of oratory too, if I may use the expression, must 
" have been acquired. . A just sense of the value of gesture and 
intonation results from the practice of public speaking; and 
the appreciation of their importance is necessary to their 
attainment. It is for these reasons that I am inclined to refer 
a portion of the prosperity which has accompanied Mr. Bushe - 
through his profession, to an institution, the supprecsion of 
which has been a source of great regret to every person who 
had the interests of literature at heart. 
The reputation which Mr: Bushe had acquired among his 
fellow-students, attended him to his profession; and in avery _

short period, he rose into the public notice as an advocate of 
distinguished abilities. It was, indeed, impossible that he 
should remain in obscurity. His genius was not of such a 
character as to stand in need of a great subject for its display. 
The most trivial business furnished him with an océasion to 
produce a striking effect. There are some men who require a 
lofty theme for the manifestation of their powers. Their 
minds demand the stimulus of high passion, and are slow and 
sluggish unless awakened by the excitement which great inter- 
ests afford. 
This is peculiarly the case with Mr. Burrowes,* ‘who, upon 
a noble topic, is one of the ablest advocates at the Ivish bar, 
but who seems oppressed by the very levity of a petty subject, 
and sinks under its inanity. 
He is in every respect the opposite of Mr. Bushe, who could 
not open his lips, or raise his hand, without immediately exci- 
ting and almost captivating the attention of every man around 
him. There is a peculiar mellowness and deep sweetness in 
his voice, the lower tones of which might, almost without haz- 
ard of exaggeration, be compared: to the most delicate notes 
of an organ, when touched with a fine but solemn hand. It is 
a voice full of manly melody. There is no touch of effeminacy 
about it. It possesses abundance as well as harmony, and is 
not more remarkable for its sweetness than in its sonorous 
depth. His attitude and gesture are the perfection of “easy 
art” —every movement of his body appears to be swayed and 
informed by a dignified and natural grace. His countenance 
is of the finest order of fine faces, and contains an expression 
of magnanimous frankness, that, in the enforcement of any 
cause which he undertakes to advocate, invests him with such 
a semblance of sincerity, as to lend to his assertion of fact, 
* Burrowes was one of the most absent of men. He it was who was found at 
breakfast-time, standing by the fire with an egg in his hand and his watch in 
the saucepan. But, as a barrister, he had great influence with a Jury—some- 
times reaching the purest eloquence. “ Devoid of every grace and every art,” 
says Phillips,“ ungainly in figure, awkward in action, discordant in voice, no 
man more riveted the attention of an audience and more repaid it, His mind 
was of the very highest order; his manner forced the conviction of his sincerity, 
and his arguments were clothed in language chaste-and vigorous."-—M.

or to his vindication of good principle, an irresistible force.*. It 
was not wonderful that he should have.advanced with extreme 
rapidity in his profession, seconded as he was by such high 
advantages. It was speedily perceived that he possessed an 
almost commanding influence with the jury; and he was in 
consequence employed in every case of magnitude, which 
called for the exertion of such eminent faculties as he mani- 
fested upon every occasion in which his powers were iat into 
requisition. 
Talents of so distinguished a kind could not fail to raise him 
into political consequence, as well as to.insure his professional 
success. The chief object of every young man of abilities at the 
bar was to obtain a seat in Parliament. It secured him the 
applause of his country if he devoted himself to her interest; 
or, if he enlisted himself under,the gilded banners of the, min- 
ister, place, pension, and authority, were the certain remu: 
nerations of the profligate services which his talents enabled 
him to bestow upon a government, which had reduced corrup- 
tion into system, and was well aware that it was only by the 
debasement of her legislature that Ireland could be kept under 
its control, The mind of Mr. Bushe was of too noble a cast to 
lend itself to purposes so uncongenial to a free and lofty spirit; 
and he preferred the freedom of his country, and the retributive 
consciousness of the approbation of his own heart, to the igno- 
minious distinctions with which the administration would have 
been glad-to reward the dereliction of what he owed to Ireland 
and to himself. Accordingly we find, that Mr. Bushe threw 
all the energy of his-youth into opposition to a measure which 
he considered fatal to that greatness which Nature appeared 
to. have intended that his country should attain; and tothe - 
last he stood among the band of patriots who offered a gen- 
erous but unavailing resistance to a legislative Union with 
Great’ Britain. |

RESULTS OF THE UNION. 129 
However, as an Englishman, I may rejoice in an event, 
which, if followed by Roman Catholic Emancipation, will 
ultimately abolish all national antipathy, and give a permanent 
consolidation to the empire; it ean not be fairly questioned that 
every native of Ireland ought to have felt that her existence 
was at stake, and that, in place of making those advances in 
power, wealth, and civilization, to which her natural advan- 
tages would have inevitably led, she must of necessity sustain 
a declension as rapid as her progress toward improvement had 
previously been, and sink into the provincial inferiority to 
which she is now reduced. This conviction, the justice of 
which has been so well exemplified by the event, prevailed 
through Ireland; and it required all the seductions which the 
minister could employ, to produce the sentence of self-annihi- 
lation, which he at last succeeded in persuading a servile 
legislature to pronounce. To the honor of the Ivish Bar, the 
great ‘majority of its members were faithful to the national 
cause; and Curran, Plunket, Ponsonby,* Saurin, Burrowes, 
and Buashe, accomplished all that eloquence and patriotism 
could effect, in opposition to the mercenaries, who had sold the 
dignity of their profession, as well as the independence of 
their country, in exchange for that ignoble station, to which, 
by their slimy profligacies, they were enabled to crawl up. 
Bushe was the youngest of these able and honest men; but he 
was among the most conspicuous of them all. 
In this strenuous resistance which was offered by the re- 
spectable portions of the Irish Bar to the measure which de- 
prived Ireland of the advantages of a local legislature, a con-,

sciousness of deep personal interest must have been mingled 
with their public virtue; for, it was not difficult-to foresee that 
the profession from which the government was compelled te 
make the selection of its parliamentary advocates, and::to 
which the country looked for its ablest.support, must sustain a 
fatal injury, from the deprivation of the opportunities of verial- 
ity upon one hand, and of profitable patriotism upon--the 
other. The House of Commons was the field to. which almost. . 
every lawyer of abilities directed his hopes of eminence rather 
than to the courts of law; and it must be acknowledged, that, 
with that field the career to high fame is closed upon ‘the 
proféssion. Money may now be made in equal abundance by 
laborious ability (and, indeed, the quantity of talent and of 
industry at the Irish Bar demand in every individual «who 
aims at important success a combination of both); but no very 
valuable reputation can be obtained. 
. Perhaps in the estimate of black-letter erudition the ‘chauge 
is not to be deplored: and unquestionably the knowledge of 
law (for a few years ago the majority of barristers in full prac- 
tice were ignorant of its elementary principles) has consider- 
ably increased, and English habits of business and of diligeneé 
are gradually beginning to appear. But the elevated objects 
of ambition, worthy of great faculties and of great minds, weré 
withdrawn for ever. Mr. Bushe must have repined at the 
prospect. He would naturally: have sought for mines of gold 
amid the heights of fame, and ho was now reduced to the 
necessity of digging for it in an obscure and ‘dreary level. - It 
is well-known that Mr. Plunket had at the time entertained 
the intention of going to the English Bar, in consequence of 
the exportation of the legislature ;* but the cautious timidity 
of his advisers induced him to abandon the idea. I am not 
aware whether Mr. Bushe had ever proposed to himself an 
abandonment of a country, from which true genius must have 
been tempted to become an absentee. But it is likely that his 
* Curran was so dispirited with what pasged in the Irish “ Reign of Terror;” 
in 1798, that though then. forty-eight years old, he also had serious thoughts 
of abandoning the Irish for the English bar. He stated: this fact in one of his _ 
speeches in defence of the state prisoners. —M,

pecuniary circumstances, which, in consequence of his spon- 
taneous generosity in paying off his father’s debts (his own 
sense of duty had rendered them debts of honor in his mind) 
were at this period extremely contracted, must have prevented 
him from engaging in so adventurous an enterprise. : 
To him, individually, however, if the Union was accom- 
panied with many evils, it was also attended with counter- 
vailing benefits. Had the Irish Parliament been permitted to 
exist, Mr. Bushe would, in all ‘probability, have continued in 
opposition to the government, upon questions to which much 
importance would have been annexed. Catholic Emancipa- 
tion, which is now not only innocent, but in the mind of almost 
every enlightened man has become indispensable, would have 
been. regarded as pregnant with danger to the state. Mr. 
Bushe, I am satisfied, could never have brought himself to 
resist what his own instincts must have taught him to be due 
to that justice which he would have considered as paramount 
to expediency. Many obstacles would have stood in the way 
of a sincere reconciliation with the government, and he could 
not afford to play the part of Fabricius. Whether the argu- 
taents which Lord Castlereagh* knew so well how to apply, 
*Tt was Robert Stewart, Lord Castlereagh (who succeeded his father in 
1821, as Marquis of Londonderry), who chiefly brought about the Union, Born 
in 1769, he entered the Irish parliament in early manhood, when Mr. Stewart, 
after a contest which cost thirty thousand pounds sterling, joined the opposi- 
tion, and advocated Parliamentary Reform, which Pitt then favored. When 
he became a member of the British Parliament, he became ministerial. In 
1797, after he had become Lord Castlereagh, he returned to the Irish Parlia- 
ment and was made Keeper of the Privy Seal in Ireland, and, soon after, one 
of the Lords of the Treasury. In 1798, he became Irish Secretary, and 
wielded immense power. In 1803, still sitting in the Imperial Parliament for 
the county of Down, he was admitted into the British Cabinet, retired on the 
death of Mr. Pitt, but resumed office in 1807, when the Grenville Ministry 
broke up. In 1809, quarrelling with Mr. Canning, whom he wounded in a 
duel, he quitted office, but succeeded the Marquis Wellesley, in 1812, as For- 
eign Secretary, which office he retained until his suicide, in August, 1822. 
He took part in the negotiations at the Congress of Vienna, after the fall of 
Napoleon. From that time until the close of his life, he was leader of the 
ministerial party, and governed the “British empire with a strong band. Con-

and before which, in the estimate of the House of Commons, 
all the eloquence of Grattan was reduced into a magnificent 
evaporation, would have prevailed upon Mr. Bushe, as’ they: 
did with the majority of the Irish members, it is unnecessary 
to conjecture; but unquestionably: had not the Union passed, 
he must have abandoned his political opinions before he could 
have been raised to office. When, however, that measure was 
carried, a compromise became easy, and was not, in my. 
opinion, dishonorable. 
Accordingly, although he had opposed the government on 
the measure which they had most at heart, their just sense of. 
his talents induced them to offer him the place of Solicitor” 
General, to which he was promoted in thirteen years after he: 
had been called to the Bar. That office he has since held;: 
and rendered the most important services to the minister, 
without, perhaps, at the same time, ever having been guilty of 
any direct dereliction of his former opinions. He was placed; 
indeed, in rather an embarrassing condition; for his associate; 
or rather, his superintendent in office, Mr. Saurin,* was coms” 
spicuous for his hatred to the Roman Catholic cause, of which 
Mr. Bushe had been, and still professed himself, the earnest 
friend. ‘This antipathy to the Roman Catholics formed. the 
leading, I may say, the only feature, in the political character 
of Saurin, who had simplified the theory of government: ix 
Ireland, by almost making its perfection consist in the oppres* 
sion of a majority of its people. Bushe, on the other’ 
had often declared, that he considered the general degradation’: 
of so large a class of the community as incompatible’ with : nar: 
tional felicity. .

itely more use to the government than Saurin could possibly 
have been, when the suppression of the Roman Catholic board* 
was resolved upon. The latter, upon the trial of the delegates, 
exhibited a sombre virulence, which was calculated to excite - 
wonder rather than conviction. Its gloomy animosity was 
without a ray of eloquence. 
Bushe produced a very different effect. He stood before the 
jury as the advocate of the Catholic cause, to suppress the 
Roman Catholic board... The members ‘of that body had been 
designated as miscreants by Mr. Saurin (that learned gentle- 
man appears to be averse to any cireumlocutory form of phrase) ; 
Solicitor-General Bushe called them his friends. With a con- 
summate wile he professed himself the champion of the people, 
and put forth all his ardor in insisting upon the necessity of 
concession to six millions of men. To the utterance of these 
sentiments, which astonished Mr. Saurin, he annexed the full 
power of his wonderful delivery.t His countenance became 
inflamed ; his voice assumed all the varieties of its most im- 
passioned intonation; and his person was informed and almost 
elevated by the consciousness of the noble thoughts which he 
was enforcing, for the purpose of investing the very fallacies

+ Bushe’s manner must have been very good. Phillips, writing in 1818, thus 
described it: “‘To be properly appreciated, Bushe must be seen and heard. 
He is the living justification of Demosthenes’ dictum — emphatically the orator 
of manner, Hie eye—-his face—his gesture—his very hand, speaks; alt 
grace, all. sweetness, all expression-—his tongue, dropping manna, is, perhaps, 
the most silent organ of his oratory.” In 1850, Phillips again said: “ By na- 
ture enriched with the rare gift of genius, he engrafts on it every grace that art 
can furnish. The sweet-toned tongue, lavishing profusely the treasures of lan- 
guage, intellect, and learning, speaks not more expressively to heart or head, 
than the glance, the action, the attitude, which wait upon his words, as it were, 
with an embodied eloquence.” He subsequently praised the consummate act- 
ing, where “not one trace of art betrays the toil by which it has been fashioned 
into Nature's image,” and eulogizes “the might ofthis reasoning, the music of 
his diction, and the absolute ‘enchantment of his exquisite delivery.” This is 
high praise, but most of his contemporaries have said as much. —M.

which he intended to inculcate with the splendid semblances.: _ 
of truth. Bra 
After having wrought his hearers to a species of enthusiasm, 
and alarmed Attorney-General Saurin by declaring, with an 
attitude almost as noble as the sentiment which it was intended 
to set off, that he would throw the constitution to his Catholic 
countrymen as widely open as his own breast, he suddenly’. 
tured back, and, after one of those pauses, the effect of which 
can be felt by those only who have been present upon stich 
occasions, in the name of those very principles of justice which. 
he had so powerfully laid down, he implored the jury to sup- 
press an institution in the country, which he asserted to be the 
greatest obstacle to the success of that measure, for the attain-- 
ment of which it had been ostensibly established. 
The eloquence of Mr. Bushe, assisted by certain contrivances 
behind the scenes, to which government is, in Dublin, ocea- 
sionally obliged to resort, produced the intended effect. I 
doubt not that a jury so properly compounded (the panel “of 
which, if not suggested, was at least revised) would have given 
a verdict for the crown, although Mr. Bushe had never -ad= 
dressed them. But the government stood in need of something 
more than a mere verdict. It was necessary to give plausi- 
bility to their proceedings, and they found it in the oratory of 
this distinguished advocate. Is it not a little surprising that 
Mr. Bushe should, in despite of the vigor of his exertions against 
the Catholic board, and theiv success, have still retained his 
popularity ? It would be natural that such services as he con-- 
ferred upon the ministry, which appeared so much at variance _ 
with the interests, and in which he acted a part so diametri- 
cally in opposition to the passions of the people, should have 
generated a feeling of ‘antipathy against him. But the event 
was otherwise. He had previously ingratiated himself so much 
in the general liking, and so liberal an allowance was made . 
for the urgency of the circumstances in which he was placed, 
that he retained fhe favor not only of the better classes among 
the Roman Catholics, but did not lose the partialities of the 
populace itself. At all events, the benefits he rendered to the

government were most material, and gave him the strongest 
claims upon their gratitude.* . 
Another remarkable instance occurred not very long ago, of 
the value of such a man to the Trish administration, and it is 
the more deserving of mention, as it is connected with circum- 
stances which have excited no inconsiderable interest in thé 
House of Commons, and brought Mr. Plunket and his rival into 
an immediate and honorable competition. JI allude to the case 
of the Chief Baron O’Grady,f when he set up a claim to nomi- 
nate to the office of clerk of the pleas in the Court of Exche- 
quer in Ireland. The prize for which the learned Judge was 
adventuring was a great,one, and well worth the daring experi- 
ment for which he exposed himself to the permanent indigna- 
tion of the government. The salary of the office was to be 
counted by thousands, and the Chief Baron. thought it would 
be as conducive to the public interests, and as consistent with 
the pure administration of justice, that he should appoint one 
of his own family to fill the vacancy which had occurred, as 
that the local ministry of Ireland should make the appoint- 
ment. The matter was brought before Parliament; and much

* At Kilkenny private theatricals, when pressed for an opinion, he said that 
he preferred the prompter, for he heard the most and saw the least of him. At 
a dinner given by a Dublin Orangeman, when politics ran high, and Bushe was 
suspected of holding pro-Cutholic opinions, the host indulged so freely that he 
fell under the-table. The Duke of Richmond, who then was Viccroy, picked 
him up and replaced him in the chair. ‘“ My Lord Duke,” said Bushe, “ though 
you say Lam attached to the Catholics, at all events I never assisted dt the 
elevation of the Host.” Sir Robert Peel, who was present, related this bon-mat. 
One of Bushe’s relations, who rarely indulged in any ablutions, complained of a 
sore throat. “‘ Filla pail with hot water, until it reach your knees; then take 
a pint of oatmeal, and scrub your legs with it for quarter of an hour,”’ was what 
Bushe recommended as a remedy. “ Why, hang it! man,” said the other, 
“that’s washing one’s feet.?—‘“I admit, my dear fellow,” replied Bushe, 
gravely, “it is liable to that objection.” —M.

upon terms of the most familiar intercourse. It was stated — 
but I can not answer for the truth of the general report—that, 
he sent him a fee of three hundred pounds, which Mr. Plunket” 
returned, but which the Chief Baron’s knowledge of human” 
nature (and no man-is more deeply read in it) insisted upon.

_must be stimulated by that sense-of duty which is imposed b: 
the actual perception of gold.* I am sure that Mr. Plunk 
would have strained his mind to the utmost pitch, without. 
additional incentive, upon behalf of his learned friend; but.

frequently arise. Mr. Sautin stated the case for the Crown 
with his usual solemnity. and deliberation, and with that aceu- 
yacy and simplicity which render him so valuable an advocate 
in a court of equity. He was followed by Mr. Plunket, who 
entered warmly into the feelings of his client, and thought that 
an unfair mode of proceeding had been adopted in his regard. 
He exhibited in his reply that fierce spirit of sarcasm which 
he has not yet fully displayed in the House of Commons, 
though it is one of the principal ingredients in his eloquence. 
His metaphors are generally sneers, and his flowers of speech 
are the aconite m full blow. He did not omit the opportunity 
of falling upon his political antagonist, in whom he left many 
‘a sear, which, though half-healed, are visible to the present 
day. His oration was as much a satire as an argument, and 
exhibited in their perfection the various attributes of his mind. 
As for Bushe, who had to reply, his oratorical ambition was 
in all probability powerfully excited by the sentiment of emu- 
lation, and he exerted all the resources of his intellect in the 
contest. His speech was a masterpiece; and in the general 
opinion, in those parts of it which principally consisted of de- 
clamatory vituperation, he won the palm from his competitor. 
He was pure, lofty, dignified, and generously impassioned. If 
his reasoning was not so subtile and condensed, it was more 
guileless and persuasive, and his delivery far more impressive 
and of a higher and more commanding tone. A very accurate 
and cold-blooded observer would have perceived, perhaps, in 
the speech of Mr. Plunket, a deeper current of thought and a 
more vigorous and comprehensive intellect: but the great pro- . 
portion of a large assembly would have preferred the eloquence 
of Bushe. The true value of it can not be justly estimated by 
any particular quotations, as the chief merit of all his speeches 
consists in the unity and proportion of the whole, rather than 
the beauty and perfection of the details.*

have often excited in the mind of Mr. Bushe, as well as in his. 
admirers, a feeling of regret that he did not offer himself as a. 
candidate for aseat inthe Imperial Parliament. Itis the opin- 
ion of all those who have had the opportunity of hearing Mr. 
Bushe, that he would have made a very great figure in -the~ 
English House of Commons; and for the purpose of enabling 
those who have not heard him to form an estimate of the like- 
lihood of his success in that assembly, and of the frame and 
character of his eloquence, a general delineation of this accom- 
plished advocate may not be inappropriate. “s 
The first cireumstance which offers itself to the mind of any 
man, who recalls the recollection of Bushe, in order to furnish 
a description of his rhetorical attributes, is his delivery. .“Iu~ 
bringing the remembrance of other speakers of eminence to 
my contemplation, their several faculties and endowments 
present themselves in a different order, according to the pro- - 
portions. of excellence to each other which they respectively 
bear. In thinking, for example, of Mr. Fox, the torrent of his 
vehement and overwhelming logic is first before me. . . . If ’- 
I should pass to his celebrated antagonist, I repose upon the 
majesty of his amplification, The wit of Sheridan,* the bla-~ 
~ ® Richard Brinsley Sheridan, born at Dublin in 1751, died in London, July: 
7, 1816, -He was -eminently distinguished, as a wit, boon-companion, orator, ~ 
politician, and dramatist, at a time when eminent men were abundant. He~ 
was the friend of Fox; and long the intimate of the Prince of Wales. Habits’- 
of improvidence’and extravagance made him constantly in difficulties. Intem- - 
perate habits ruined his health, and he died, broken in spirit, and -in great’ 
want, His wit and eloquence were remarkable. Having stated that he never 
spoke well until after he had drank a couple of bottles of port, Father O'Leary. 
said “this was like a porter; he could not get on without a load on his head.’"” 
When he wrote, he always drank. “A glass of wine,” he used to say, “would. 
encourage the bright thought to come: and then it was right to take another-to ~ 
reward it for coming.” —Moore’s Life of Sheridan, although naturally apologetic 
for its subject, is a, brilliant record of a brilliant career. Byron’s opinion of 
Sheridan, hastily thrown off in conversation, was this: ‘“ Whatever Sheridan 
has done or chosen to do has been par excellence, always the best of its kind.” 
He has written the best comedy (School for Scandal), the dest opera (the 
Duenna— in my mind far better than that St. Giles’s lampoon, The Beggar’s 
Opera), the dest farce (The Critic—it is only too good for an after-piece), and

zing imagination and the fantastic drollery .of Curran, the 
forensic and simple vigor of Erskine,* and the rapid, versatile, 
best oration {the famous Reform Speech), ever conceived or heard in this 
country,” When Sheridan heard this compliment, shortly before his death, 
he burst into tears.— Moore’s own tribute of the same date was less compli- 
mentary. In his “ Two-Penny Post-Bag,” describing a fashionable dinner in - 
London, he said :— 
“The brains were near Sherry, and once had been fine, 
But, of late, they had lain so long soaking in wine, 
That, though we, from courtesy, still choose to call 
‘These brains very fine, they were no brains at all.” 
Compare this, also, with Byron’s Monody in which he says that— 
“ Nature formed but one such man, , 
, And broke the die, in moulding Sheridan,” 
and Moore’s own later mention of him as— 
“The pride of the palace, the bower, and the hall, 
The orator — dramatist minstrel —who ran 
Through each mode of the lyre, and was master of all.” —M. 
* Thomas Erskine, third son of the Earl of Buchan, a Scottish peer, was 
porn in 1750. After serving in the navy and the army he went to the bur in 
1778. Five years after (which was unusually rapid) he was made King’s 
Counsel—a rank which advances the status of him who receives it. In the 
same year he entered Parliament. As an advocate (for he never was much of 
a lawyer) he obtained great practice and much eminence. In polities he sided 
with Fox, and thus became intimate with the Prince of Wales, who made him 
his Attorney-General—a post which he lost on undertaking the defence of 
Thomas Paine, in 1792, when prosecuted for publishing “ The Rights of Man.” 
His subequent defence of Hardy, Horne Tooke, and others, charged with high 
treason, and his vindication of the rights of the subject and the liberty of the 
press, made him extremely popular. His pamphlet on the War with France, * 
ran thropgh forty-eight editions, owing to his name alone, for it was not well 
written. In 1802, he resumed his official connection with the Prince of Wales, 
and, in 1806, on Pitt’s death, was created Lord Erskine and made Lord Chan- 
cellor, but had to resign in 1807, when the ministry broke up. He obtained the 
usual retiring pension of four thousand pounds sterling a year (now five thou- 
sand pounds sterling), which is considered a right in England, where a lawyer 
can not go back to practice at the bar after having filled the office of judge. 
He soon sank into obscurity, and became involved in debt. . Lord Erskine died 
in 1823. He had no success in Parliament, where, for the most part, barristers 
accustomed to speak to the array of judge, jury, and counsel, resemble the man 
spoken of by Locke, in his chapter on the association of ideas, who having 
learned to dance in a room where his trunk lay, could never dance afterward 
where that. trunk was not present to witness his agility, Erskine was so fond

which connect themselves with their respective names. But 
there is no one peculiar faculty of mind which suggests itself 
_ in the first instance as the-characteristic of Mr. Bushe, and 
which presses into the van of his qualifications as a publié 
speaker. The corporeal image of the man himself is brought 
at once into the memory. I do not think of. any one distin ~ 
guishing attribute in the shape of a single intellectual abstrae- 
tion —it is a picture that I have before me. : 
There is a certain rhetorical heroism in the expression 1 of 
his countenance, when enlightened and inflamed, which I have 
not witnessed in the faces of other men. The phrase may, - 
perhaps, appear too extravagant and Irish; but those who 
have his physiognomy in their recollection, will not think that 
the word is inapplicable. The complexion is too sanguineous. -- 
and ruddy, but has no murkiness or impurity in its flush: itis 
indicative of great fullness, but, at the same time, of great 
vigor ‘of temperament. The forehead is more lofty_than ex- 
_Pansive, and suggests itself to be the residence of an elevated: 
“rather than of a comprehensive mind. It is not so mueli 
“the dome of thought,” as “the palace of the soul.” It has- 
none of the deep furrows and intellectual indentures which are: 
observable in the forehead of Plunket, but is smooth, polished, 
and marble. The eyes are large, globular, and blue; ex- 
tremely animated with idea, but without any of that diffusive ® 
irradiation which belongs to the expression of genius. They. 
are filled with a serene light, but have not much brilliancy or 
fire. The mind within them seems, however, to be all activity: 
and life, and to combine a singular mixture of intensity:and:- 
deliberation. The nose is lightly arched, and with sufficient 
breadth of the nostrils (which physiognomists consider as a 
type of eloquence) fo furnish the associations of daring and_ 
Ego.”’— Once, on a trial of a patent for shoe-buckle, he exclaimed, “How © 
would my ancestors have looked at this specimen of modern dexterity?” and. 
went on to laud his ancestors. Mingay, on the other side contemptuously re- 
marked that if Erskine’s sans-culotte ancestors would have wondered at hig:

stockings; the Scotch Highlanders wore neither. — M. . -

- of power, and terminates with a delicacy and chiseled elegance 
of proportion, in which it is easy to discover the polished irony 
and refined satire in which he is accustomed to indulge. But 
the mouth is the most remarkable feature in his countenance : 
it is endowed with the greatest variety of sentiment, and con- 
tains a rare assemblago of oratorical qualities. It is charac- 
teristic of force, firmness, and precision, and is at once affable 
and commanding, proud and kind, tender and impassioned; 
accurate and vehement, generous and sarcastic, and is capable 
of the most. conciliating softness and the most impetuous ire._ 
Yet there is something artificial about it, from a lurking 
consciousness of its own expression. Its smile is the great 
instrument of its effects, but appears to be too systematic: 
yet it is susceptible of the nicest gradations. It merely flashes 
and disappears, or, in practised obedience to the will, streams 
over the whole countenance in a broad and permanent illumin- 
ation: at one moment it just passes over the lips, and dies at 
the instant of its birth; and at another, bursts out into an 
exuberant and overflowing joyousness, and seems caught, in 
the fullness of its hilarity, from the face of Comus himself. 
But it is to satire that it is principally and most effectually ap- 
plied. "It is the glitter of the poisoned sneer that is leveled at 
the heart. ; . 
The man who is gifted with these powers of physiognomy 
is, naturally enough, almost too prodigal of their use: and a 
person who watched Mr. Bushe would perceive, that he fre- 
quently employed the abundant resources of his countenance 
instead of ‘the riches of his mind. With him, indeed, a look 
is often sufficient for all purposes. It :

jury eye;” and, indeed, from his frequent application of its 
ludicrous qualifications, which the learned gentleman often 
substitutes in the place of argument, even where argument 
might be obviously employed, has acquired a sort of profes- 
sional distortion, of which he appears to be somewhat singu- 
larly proud. Mr. Bushe does not, it is true, rely so much upon 
this species of ocular logic; but even he, with all his good 
taste, carries it to an extreme. It never amounts to the buf- 
foonery of the old school of Irish barristers, who were addicted 
to .a strange compound of tragedy and farce; but still it is 
vicious from its excess. 
The port and attitude of Mr. Bushe are as well suited to the 
purposes of impressiveness as his countenance and its expres- 
sion. His form, indeed, is rather too corpulent and heavy, and 
if it were not concealed in a great degree by his gown, would 
be! considered ungainly and inélegant. - His stature is not 
‘above the middle size; but his chest is wide and expansive, 
and lends to his figure an aspect of sedateness and strength. 
In describing the ablest of bis infernal senate, Milton has 
particularly mentioned the breadth of his “Atlantean shoul- 
ders.” The same circumstance is specified by Homer in his 
picture of Ulysses; and however many speakers of eminence 
have overcome the disadvantages of a weak and slender con- 
figuration, it can not be doubted that we associate with dignity 
and wisdom an accompaniment of massiveness and power.

the exclusive constituent, of excellence in his miraculous art. 
There is unquestionably much of that native elegance about 
it, which is to the body what fancy and imagination are to the: 
mind, and which no efforts of the most laborious diligence can 
acquire. But the heightening and additions of deep study are 
apparent. The most minute particulars are attended to. So.

the voice of this fine speaker which contains the master-spell 
of his.perfections. Ihave already mentioned its extraordinary 
attributes, and, indeed, it must be actually heard in order to 
form any appreciation of its effects. 
‘It must be acknowledged by the admirers of Mr. Bushe, that 
his delivery constitutes his chief merit as an advocate, for his 
other. powers, however considerable, do not keep pace with it. 
His style and diction are remarkably conspicuous and clear, 
but are deficient in depth. He has a remarkable facility in 
the use of simple and unelaborated expression, and every word 
drops of its own accord into that part of the sentence to which 
it most properly belongs. The most accurate ear could not 
easily detect a single harshness, or one inharmonious coneur- 
rence of sounds, in the course of his longest and least pre- 
meditated speech. But, at the same time, there is some want 
of power in his phraseology, which is not either very original 
or picturesque. He indulges little in his imagination, from a 
dread, perhaps, of falling into those errors to which his coun- 
trymen are so prone, by adventuring upon the heights which 
overhang them. But I am, at the same time, inclined to 
suspect that nature has not conferred that faculty in great 
excellence upon him. An occasional flush gleams for a mo- 
ment over his thoughts, but it is less the lightning of the 
imagination, than the warm exhalation of a serene and mete- 
oric fancy.*

materials into symmetry and order. In what is called “the 
narration” in discourses upon rhetoric, his talent is of the first 
rank. He clarifies and methodises every topic upon which he 
dwells, and makes the obscurest subject perspicuous and trans- 
parent to the dullest mind. - 
- His wit is perfectly gentlemanlike and pure.* It is not 80 
vehement and sarcastie as that of Plunket, nor does it grope 
for pearls, like the imagination of Curran, in the midst of foul- ' 
ness and ordure. — It is full of smooth mockery and playfalness, 
and dallies with its victim with a sort of feline elegance and 
grace. But its gripe is not the less deadly for its procrasti- 
‘nation. His wit has more of the qualities of raillery than of* 
imagination. He does not accumulate grotesque images to- 
gether, or surprise by the distance of the objects between which 
he discovers an analogy. He has nothing of that spirit of 
whim which pervaded the oratory of Curran, and made his 
mind appear at thoments like a transmigration of Hogarth: 
Were a grossly ludicrous similitude to offer itself to him, he 
would at once discard: it as incompatible with that chastised

that, in choosing the officers of the Ecclesiastical Board, they must vote for the’

and subjugated ridicule in which alone he permits himself to 
indulge. - 
But from this circumstance he draws ¢ a considerable advan- 
‘tage. The mirth of Curran was so broad, and the convulsion 
of laughter, which by his personations (for his delivery often 
bordered upon a theatrical audacity) he never failed, when- 
ever he thought proper, to produce, disqualified his auditors 
and himself for the more sober investigations of truth. His 
transitions, therefore, were frequently. too abrupt; and with 
all his mastery over his art, and that Protean quality by which 
he passed with an astonishing and almost divine facility into 
every different modification of style and thought, a just gra- 
dation from the extravagance of merriment to the depth of 
pathetic emotion could not always be preserved. Bushe, on 
the other hand, never finds it difficult to recover himself. 
Whenever he deviates from that sobriety which becomes the 
discussions of a court of justice, he retraces his steps and re- 
turns to seriousness again, not only with perfect ease, but with- 
out even leaving a perception of the change. His manner is 
admirably chequered, and the various topics which he employs, 
enter into each other by such gentle and elegant degrees, that 
all the parts of his speech bear a just relation, and are as well 
proportioned as the several limbs of a fine statue to the gene- 
ral composition of the whole. This unity, which in all the arts 
rests upon the same sound principles, is one of the chief merits 
of Mr. Bushe as a public speaker. . 
There is a fine natural vein of generous sentiment running 
through hig oratory. It has often been said that true elo- 
quence could not exist in the absence of good moral qualities. 
In opposition to this maxim of ethical criticism, the example 
of some highly-gifted but vicious men has been appealed to; 
but it must be remembered, in the first place, that most of 
those whose deviations from good conduct are considered to 
afford a practical refutation of this tenet (which was laid down 
by. the greatest orator of antiquity) were not engaged in the 
discussion of private concerns, in which, generally speaking, 
an appeal to moral feeling is of most frequent occurrence ; and 
in the ‘next place, ‘there can be little doubt, that although a

series of vicious indulgences may have adulterated their na- — 
tures, they must have been endowed with a large portion of 
generous instinct. However their moral vision might: have 
been gradually obscured, they could not have been born blind 
to that sacred light which they knew how to describe so-well. 
Nay, more: I will venture to affirm, that, i in their moments of 
oratorical enthusiasm, they must have been virtuous men.. 
As the best amongst us fall into occasional error, so in the 
spirit of lenity to that human nature fo which we ourselves 
belong, we should cherish the hope that there are few indeed 
so bad, as not in imagination at least to relapse at intervals to 
better sentiment and a nobler cast of thought. However the 
fountains of the heart. may haye been dried and parched up, 
enough must at least remain to show that there had been a 
living spring within them. At all events there can be no elo- 
quence without such an imitation of virtue, as to look as’ beau- 
tiful as the original from which the copy is made. Mr. Bushe, 
I confidently believe, bears the image stamped upon his breast, 
and has only to feel there, in order to give utterance to those 
sentiments. which give a moral dignity and elevation to his 
speeches. His whole life, at least, is in keeping with his ora- 
tory ;* and.any one who heard him would be justly satisfied that 
* Charles Kendal Bushe, born in January, 1767, at Kilmury (the ancient 
seat of his family, which he eventually repurchased after the extravagance of 
his relatives had lost it), entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1782 —the } year 
of Ireland’sindependence. He soon became one of the most eloquent aeba- 
ters in the Historical Society, where he had Plunket as a rival. At that time, 
the gallery of the Irish House of Commons was open to the University students, 
provided they wore their academic attire. Bushe was a constant attendant in 
thet great school for orators. In 1793, he was called to the bar, and speedily 
succeeded there. In 1799, he entered Parliament, where he was second only 
to Plunket in opposing the Union. In 1805, he had reached such a station at 
the bar, as to justify his being made one of the King’s Sergeants, and inthe 
same year, Lord Hardwicke being Viceroy, was appointed Solicitor-General. 
This was a concession to the liberal cause, for Bushe was known to be friendly 
to Catholic Emancipation, though, after the Union, he had. taken no ‘part in 
politics. He continued in his office under “All the Talents’* Ministry of 1806-"7, 
and was retained in that office, under successive administrations, until early in ~ 
1822, when Saurin, put over his head in 1807, as Attorney-General, waived 
his claims to the Chief Justiceship, on Downes’ retirement, and Bushe was ap-: 
. pointed. Asa judge, Bushe gave general satisfaction, for more than twenty.

he had been listening to a high-minded, amiable, and honora- 
ble man. 
The following extract from one of his best speeches will 
illustrate the quality to which I have alluded, as well-as fur- 
nish a favorable example of the general tone of his eloquence.* 
He is describing the forgiveness of a husband; and; as’ this 
article has already exceeded the bounds which I had prescrib- 
ed to myself, I shalt conclude with it: “It requires obdurate 
and habitual vice and practised depravity to overbear the nat- 
ural workings of the human heart: this unfortunate woman 
had not strength farther to resist. She had been seduced, she 
had been depraved, her soul was burdened with a guilty se- 
cret; but she was young in crime and true to nature. She 
could no longer bear the load of her own conscience—she was 
years while he held that office. As an advocate at Nisi Prius, few men won 
“ more verdicts, He had tact for which Scarlett was eminent, at the English 
bar, but he also had genius, eloquence, and wit, which Scarlett had not. His 
manner has already been noticed ; John Kemble called‘him “ the most. perfect 
actor off the stage.” Asa forensic speaker, clearness of statement was his - 
great_mérit.—Bushe martied the sister of Sir Philip Crampton, the Surgeon- 
General of Ireland and father of the present British Minister at Washington. 
He was offered a peerage and declined it. —In 1842, he retiréd frem the bench, 
on a pension of three thousand pounds sterling a year. He died, at his son’s 
seat near Dublin, on July 7, 1843.—M. 
* The nobleman was Lord Cloncurry, and his guilty wife, from whom he 
was divorced, was daughter of General Morgan. Lord Cloncurry was bom 
in August, 1773, and died ‘at Blackrock, near Dublin, October, 1853. He 
entered early into -public affuirs, and was mixed up with them for more than 
half a century. He was educated at Oxford, and joined the United Irishmen. 
on his return. The Emmetts, Sampson, and O’Connor, were his close friends. 
He established a branch of the united bedy in London, was suspected by the 
Government, arrested, and examined before the Privy. Council, when he ad- 
mitted that he was a meniber of the society. He was cautioned and discharged, 
but was again apprebended, committed to the Tower, and detained there for 
two years, From that time he was.a staunch Liberal, and, though a Protes- 
tant, the earnest advocate of the Catholic Claims. He was O’Connell’s per- 
sonal friend and admirer—though he did not go quite to the same extent in 
politics. The Whig Ministry gave him an English Peerage. A few years 
ago, he published his Recollections—~ full of anecdotes, and written with great 
clearness. He bequeathed a- handsome legacy to the Dublin Library—provi- 
ded, it assurne the more national name of the Hibernian Athenwum. Cecil

keon than any reproaches—she was incapacitated from any

unworthy,’ she exclaimed, * of: such tenderness and such good- 
ness — it is too late—the villain has ruined me and dishonored 
you: I am guilty.’—Gentlemen, I told you I should confine 
myself to facts; I have scarcely ma&e an observation. IT will

no advocate can ;—as I told you, your hearts must be the ad-

life, surrounded with every comfort, exalted with high honors 
and distinctions, enjoying great property, the proud proprietor, 
a few hours before, of what he thought an innocent and an

and loved the more as the children of a wife whom he adored 
precipitated in one hour into an abyss of misery which no 
Yanguage can represent, loathing his rank, despising hts wealth, 
cursing the youth and health that promised nothing but the 
protraction of a wretched existence, looking round upon every 
worldly object with disgust and despair, and finding in this 
complicated wo no principle of consolation, except the con- 
sciousness of not having deserved it. Smote to the earth this 
unhappy man forgot not his character ;—he ‘raised the guilty 
and lost penitent from his feet; he left her punishment to her 
conscience and to Heaven; her pardon he reserved to himself. 
The tenderness and generosity of his nature prompted him to 
instant mercy —he forgave her—he prayed to God to forgive 
her; he told her that she should be restored to the protection 
of her father; that until then her secret should be preserved 
and her feelings respected, and that her fall from honor should 
be as easy as it might; but there was a forgiveness for which 
she supplicated, and which he sternly refused; he refused 
that forgiveness which implies the meanness of the person who 
dispenses it, and which renders the clemency valueless because 
it makes the man despicable; he refused to take back to his

  WILLIAM SAURIN. ms 
Mr. Savrin is the son of a Presbyterian clergyman, who fol- 
lowed the duties of his pious but humble calling in the north 
of Ireland.’ His grandfather was a French Protestant, who, 
after the revocation of the edict of Nantz, sought an asylum in 
Ireland. -He is said to have belonged to the family of the cel- 
ebrated preacher of. his name.* Mr. Saurin was educated in 
- the University of Dublin. It does not appear that he was dis- 
tinguished by any signal proficiency, either in literature or in 
science. A collegiate reputation is not a necessary precursor 
to professional success. He was called to the bar in the year 
1780. His progress was slow, and for thirteen years he re- 
mained almost unknown. Conscious of his secret merits, he 
was not disheartened, and employed that interval in aceumu- 
lating the stores of legal knowledge. He had few qualities, 
indeed, which were calculated to bring him into instantaneous 
notice. He wrought his way with an obscure diligence, and, 
indeed, it was necessary that he should attain the light bya a 
long process of exfodation. 
To this day, there is too frequent an exhibition of boister- 
ous ability at the Irish bar; but in the olden time, the qualiii-

Solicitor General) in July, 1798, was made Attorney-General in May, 1807, and 
retained that office until January, 1822, when. Mr. Plunket succeeded him. It 
was expected, from his high attainments, and the return of his party to office, 
that he would have succeeded Sir Anthony Hart, as Chancellor, in 1830, Mr.

cations of a lawyer were measured in a great degree by his 
powers of vociferation. Mr. Saurin was imperfectly versed in 
the stentorian logic which prevailed in the roar of Irish nist 
prius; neither had he the matchless imperturbability of front, 
to which the late Lord Clonmel* was indebted for his brazen 
* John Scott, who eventually became Earl of Clonmel, Chief-Justice of Ire- 
land, was bom in June, 1739. His parents were in a very humble rank of life. 
While at school, he rendered some small service to young (afterward Lord) 
Garleton, whose father went to the expense of sending him to college, and 
of bis call to the Irish bar. Ho speedily rose to eminence, and entered the 
Irish Parliament on the recommendation of Lord Lifford, then Chancellor, In 
1774 he was made Solicitor, and in 1777 Attorney-General, which he remained 
until 1782. He was made ChiefJustice of the King’s Bench in 1784—with 
which office he also held the rich sinecure of Clerk of the Pleas in the Court 
of Exchequer-—and was created an Irish peer, as Baron Erlsfort. In 1789, he 
was made Viscount Clonmel, and was further advanced to an Earldom in 1793. 
He died in May, 1798, leaving a fortune of twenty-two thousand pounds ster- 
ling a year. — This man, whose talents were great, may be said to have got on 
by sheer impudence and bullying. He knew the world well, and how to play 
his cards in it. Where argument would not succeed, he endeavored to defeat 
his opponent by duelling, Among others, he fought with Curran. He was 
master of sarcasm and ridicule, and unscrupulous in their use, In private life, 
he was amiable, witty, and agreeable; full of anecdote, indelicate and coarse, 
but amusing. On the bench he was overbearing, particularly to Curran, his old 
opponent. -Having publicly insulted Mr. Hackett, one of their body, the bar 
held a meeting, at which they resolved, with only one dissentient voice, “ that 
until his Lordship publicly apologized/ no barrister would either take a brief, 
appear in the King’s Bench, or sign any pleadings for that Court.”’ Accord- 
ingly, when the Judges sat, neither counsel nor attorneys were to be seen. The 
result was, that the Chief-Justice, Lord Clonmel, published an apology in the 
newspapers, which was adroitly dated as if written on the evening of the offence, 
and before the meeting of the bar, therefore voluntary. Some time before he 
died, a report of his illmess got out. “ Do you believe it?” said some one to 
Curran. The reply was, “ I believe that he is scoundrel enough to live or die, 
just as it suits his own convenience.” His personal appearance was remarkable. 
He had an immense hanging pair of cheeks—~vulgarly called jowls—and a 
huge treble chin, to correspond. Looking back, toward the close of his politi- 
eal career, as behooves all men to do as they pass into the shadows of the valo 
of life, Lord Clonmel is said to have remarked, “As to myself, if I were to 
* begin life again, I would rather be a chimney-sweeper than connected with the 
Trish Government.” Two of Lord Clonmel’s maxims are worthy of being re- 
membered. ‘One, was, ‘ Whatever may be done in the course of the week, 
always do on Monday ‘morning.” The other, which he gave as applicable to 
married life, was—‘ Never do anything for peace-sake: if you do, you buy all

coronet; but, his substantial deserts were sure to appear at last. 
If he could not fly, he had the strength and the tenacity requi- 
-site toclimb. His rivals were engaged in the pursuit of politi- 
cal distinction and oratorical renown; all his labors, as well 
as his predilections, were confined to his profession. While 
others were indulging in legislative meditations, he was buried 
in the common Jaw. An acute observer would have seen-in 
his unostentatious assiduity the-omen of a tardy but secure 
success. A splendid intellect will, in all likelihood, ascend to 
permanent eminence, but the odds of good fortune are in favor 
of the less conspicuous faculties. 
Plunket and Saurin have risen to an equality in professional? 
distinction ; but, when they both commenced their career, upon 
a sober-calculation, the chances would have been found, I think, 
upon the side of the latter. Like the slow camel and the Ara- 
bian courser, both may be fitted to the desert; and, althoagh : 
the more aspiring and flecter spirit may traverse in a shorter 
period the waste of hardships and discouragement which liés 
between it-and success, while, with all its swiftness and alac- 
rity, it requires an occasional relief from some external. source 
of refreshment and of hope: yet, bearing its restoratives in it- 
’ self, the more slow and persevering mind pursues its progress’ 
with an unabated constancy, and often leaves its more rapid” 
- but less enduring competitor drooping far behind, and exhausted 
by the labors of its desolate and arid course. 
After many years of disappointment, perhaps, but not: ‘of. 
despondency, Mr. Saurin’s name began to be whispered in tlie: 
Hail. The little business with which he had been intrusted’ 
was discharged with such efficiency, that he gradually acquired: 
areputation for practical utility among the attorneys of the: 
north. , Many traits of the Scotch character are observable in 
the Presbyterian colony which was established in that part-of 
Ireland ; and their mutuality of support is among the honora- 
ble peculiarities which mark their origin from that patriotic. 
and self-sustaining people. They may be said to advance un- 
future tranquillity only by concession.” When asked if this last were hie own 
rule of practice, he confessed that it was not, as a ‘philosopher had an easier 
life of it than a soldier !-—M.

HIS BUSINESS HABITS, 158 
dex a-testudo. It.is remarked at the Irish bar that.a northern 
attorney seldom employs a southern. advocate. Myr. Saurin, 
though descended from a Gallic progenitor, had, I believe, some 
auspicious mixture of Caledonian blood (with a French face, 
he has a good deal of the Scotchman in his character) ; and 
that circumstance, together with the locality of his birth, gave 
him claims to the patronage of the attorneys of his circuit. 
Those arbiters of fortune recognised his merits. It was soon: 
perceived by these sagacious persons that a good argument is _ 
more valuable than a flower of speech, and that the lawyer who. 
nonsuits the plaintiff is as efficacious as the advocate who draws 
tears from the jury. 
Mr. Saurin’s habits of despatch were also a signal recom- 
mendation. To this day, under a pressure of various occu- 
pancy, he is distinguished for a regularity and promptitude, 
which are not often to be found among the attributes of the 
leading members of the Irish Bar. . Most, indeed, of their more 
eminent advocates are “illustrious diners-out.” It is provo- 
king to see the fortunes of men hanging in miserable suspense 
upon their convivial procrastinations, Mr. Saurin still presents 
an exemplary contrast to these dilatory habits; and it is 
greatly creditable to him that he should persevere, from a 
sense of duty in a practice which was originally adopted as a 
means of success. 
The first occasion on which he appears to have grown into 
general notice, was afforded at a contested election. At that 
period, which was about sixteen years after he had been called 
to the bar, a lawyer at an Irish election was almost a gladiator 
by profession ; his pistols were the chief implements of reason- 
ing to which he thought it necessary to resort. “Ratio 
ultima,” the motto which the great Frederick caused to be 
engraven upon his cannon,* would not have been an inappro-

  : al a designation of the conclusive arguments which ‘were, 
¢hén’so much in use in Hibernian dialectics. I am not aware, 
‘that Mr. Saurin was ever accounted an eminent professor in 
this school of logic: ‘upon this occasion, however, he distin~ 
' guished himself by qualifications very distinct from the ‘bar: 
barous accomplishments which bring intellect and dullness-to 
‘such a disastrous level. His extensive and applicable knowl- 
edge, his dispassionate perspicuity, and minute precision, won, 
him a concurrence.of applause. He became known upon’ hig 
cirenit, and his fame soon after extended itself to the metropo- 
lis. His progress was as swiftly accelerated as it had pre- 
viously been slow: every occasion on which he was employed. 
furnished a new vent to his accumulated information. He-was 
at length fairly launched; and when once detached: from the 
heavy incumbrances in which he had been involved, he made 
a rapid and conspicuous way; and. it was soon perceived that 
he could carry more sail than gilded galliots which had started. 
upon the full flood of popularity before him. He soon passed, 
them by, and rode at last in that security which most of them 
were neyer destined to attain. 
In the year 1798, Mr. Saurin was at the head of his profen 
sion, and -was not only eminent for his talents, but added: to 
their influence the weight of a high moral estimation, The 
political disasters of the country furnished evidence of ‘the 
high respect in which he was held_-by the members of his own 
body. The Rebellion broke out, and the genius of loyalty. 
martialized the various classes ofthe community. The good 
citizens of Dublin were submitted to a somewhat fantastic 
metamorphosis; the Gilpins of the metropolis, to the delighted... 
wonder of their wives and daughters, were travestied into 
scarlet, and strutted, in grim importance and ferocious security; 
in the uneasy. accoutrements of a bloodless warfare. 
The love of glory became contagious, and the attorneys, 
solicitors, and six-clerks, felt the intense novelty of its charms, 
The Bar could not fail to participate in the ecstasy of patriot- 
ism: the boast of Cicero became inverted in this access of 
forensic soldiership, and every Drances, “loud in debate and 
‘bold in peaceful council,” was suddenly transformed into a

warrior. The “toged counsel” exhibited a spectacle at once 
ludicrous and lamentable; Justice was stripped of her august 
ceremony and her reverend forms, and joining in this grand 
political masquerade, attired herself in the garb, and feebly 
imitated the aspect of Bellona. The ordinary business of the 
courts of law was discharged by barristers in regimentals; the 
plume nodded over the green spectacle——the bag was trans- 
muted in the cartridge-pouch—the flowing and full-bottomed 
wig was exchanged for the casque; the chest, which years of 
study had bent into a professional stoop, was straightened in 
a stiff imprisonment of red; the flexible neck, which had been 
stretched in the distension of vituperative harangue, was en- 
closed in a high and rigid collar. The disputatious and dingy 
features of every minuté and withered sophist were swollen 
into an unnatural bigness and burliness of look; the strut of 
the mercenary Hessian,* who realized the beau ideal of martial 
ferocity, was mimicked in the slouching gait which had been 
acquired by years of unoceupied perambulation in the Hall; 
limbs, habituated to yielding silk, were locked in buff; the 
reveillé superseded the shrill voice of the crier—the disquisi- 
tions of pleaders were “horribly stuffed with epithets of war ;” 
the bayonet lay beside the pen, and the musket was collateral 
to the brief. 
Yet, with all this innovation upon their ordinary habits, the 
Bar could not pass all at once into a total desuetude of their 
more natural tendencies, and. exhibited a relapse into their 
professional: predilections in the choice of their leader. ‘The

couple of Hessians, and was putting the contents of their pockets iato his own.

stance, is conspicuous, did not obtain their suffrages: a grena+ 
dier proportion of fame, and a physical pre-eminence of height; 
were not the merits which decided their preference; they ehose 
Mr. Saurin for his intellectual stature; and in selecting. a 
gentleman, in whom I am at a loss to discover one glance of 
the “coup d’ail militaire,” and whose aspect is among the most 
unsoldierlike I have ever witnessed, they offered him an honor- 
able testimony of the’ great esteem in which he was held “by: 
his profession. He wag thus, in some degree, recognised “ad

His conduct, as chief of the lawyer's, corps, was patriotic 
and discreet. He manifested none of those religious.antipa- , 
thies by which he has been since unhappily distinguished ; he 
had no share, either in the infliction of, or the equivalent: cons”

whosesoever head the guilt ought to lie, did unquestionably: 
exist.* His hands do not smell of blood; and though a series: 
of unhappy incidents has since thrown him into the arms of the’ 
Orange faction, to which he has been rather driven by the’ 
rash rancor of his antagonists, than allured through the genuine’ 
tendencies of his nature, in that period of civil commotion he 
discountenanced the excesses of the party who now claim him 
as their own. With all his present Toryism, he appears. to 
have been a Whig; and the republican tinge of his opinions - 
was brought out in the great event which succeeded the Rebel- 
Vion, and to which the government was aware that it would’ *

necesgary that it. should, be thrown down*—but the name of 
country (and there ‘is a charma even in a name) has been buried 
in the fall. . 
The Union was proposed, and Mr. Saurin threw himself into 
én indignant opposition to the measure, which he considered 
. fatal to Ireland. He called the Bar together; and upon his 
motion, a resolution was passed by a great majofity, protesting 
against the merging of the country in the Imperial amalgama- 
tion. . He was elected a member of the Irish House of Com- 
“mons, and his appearance in that profligate convention was 
hailed by Mr. Grattan, who set, the highest value upon his . 
accession to the national cause. 
Of eloquence there was already a redundant supply. Genius 
abounded in the ranks of the patriots—they were ardent, 
devoted, and inspired. Mr. Sautin reinforced them with his 
more Spartan. qualities. Grave and sincere, regarded as a 
great constitutional lawyer—the peculiar representative of his 
own profession —a true, but unimpassioned lover of his country, 
and as likely to consult her permanent interests as to cherish 
a romantic attachment to her dignity—he rose in the House 
of Commons, attended with a great concurrence of impressive . 
circumstance. He addressed himself to great principles, and 
took his ground upon the broad foundations of legislative right, 
His more splendid allies rushed among the ranks of their 
adversaries and dealt theix sweeping invective about them; 
while Saurin, in an iron and somewhat rusty armor, and wielding 
more massive and ponderous weapons, stood like a sturdy sen- 
tinel before the gates of the constitution. Simple and elemen- 
tary positions were enforced by him with a strenuous convie-* 
tion of their truth. He denied the right of the legislature to 
alienate its sacred trust. He insisted that it would amount to 
a forfeiture of that estate which was derived from, and held 
under the people in whom the reversion must perpetually 
yemain; that they were bound to consult the will of the ma- 
jority of the nation, and that the will of that majority was the 
foundation of all law. .

  Generous sentiments, uttered with honest fervency; : 
important constituents of eloquence; and Mr. Saurin acquired 
the fame of a distinguished speaker. His language was not- 
flowing or abundant—tbere was no soaring in his thouglit, nor- 
majesty in his elocution; but he was clear and manly: there 
was a plain vigor about him. Thought started through‘ bis 
diction; it wanted roundness and color, but it was muscular: 
and strong. It was not “ pinguitudine nitescens.” If it werd: 
deficient in* bloom and fullness, it had not a greasy and* ple 
thoric gloss; it derived advantages from the absence of decora=; 
tion, for. its nakedness became the simplicity of primitive truth. 
Mr. Saurin obtained a well-merited popularity. His efforts 
were strenuous’ and unremitted; but what éould they avail? 
The minister had an easy task to perform: there was, at first, 
a show of coyness in the prostitute venality of the majority of 
the House; it only required an increased ardor of solicitation, 
and a more fervent pressure of the “itching palm.” No man 
understood the arts of parliamentary seduction better than- 
Lord Castlereagh. He succeeded to the full extent of his. 
undertaking, and raised himself to the highest point of ambition 
to which a subject can aspire. . 
But those who had listened to his blandishments, found, in 
the emptiness of title, and in the baseness of pecuniary rew; 
an inadequate compensation for the loss of personal ‘conse: 
quence which they eventually sustained. In place of the 
reciprocal advantages which they might have imparted 
received, by spending their fortunes in the metropolis of th 
own country, such among them as are now exported in the 
capacity of representatives from Ireland are lost in utter insig-: 
nificance. Instead of oceupying the magnificent mansion:

almost @ badge, as it is a product, of his disgrace. He bears

His family are scarcely admitted among the aristocracy, and, 
when admitted, it is only to be scorned. It requires the nicest 
exercise of subtle stratagem, and the suppression of every 
feeling of pride, on the part of an Irish lady, to effect her way 
into the great patrician coteries. The scene which Miss Edge- 
worth has so admirably described at the saloon of the opera- 
house, in which the Irish countess solicits the haughty gecog- 
nition of the English duchess, is of nightly recurrence. Even 
great talents are not exempted from this spirit. of national 
depreciation. Myr. Grattan himself never enjoyed the full 
dignity which ought, in every country, to have been an ap- 
panage to his genius. As to Lord Clare, he died of a broken 
heart. The Duke of Bedford crushed the plebeian peer with a 
single tread.| What, then, must be the case with the inferior

as. possessors of English titles. Thus the Irish Marquis of Downshire’ has his 
seat in the Imperial Parlfifment by virtue of his English earldom of Hillsbor- 
ough, and the Earl of Bessborough sits for his English barony. No Irish Peer 
can represent an Irish county or borough, but the restriction does not apply out 
of Ireland. Thus Viscount Palmerston, an Irish Peer, sits in the House of

The Attorney-General appoints the judges of the land, and 
nominates to those multitudinous places with which the gov- 
ernment has succeeded in subduing the naturally democratic 
tendencies of the bar. Every measure in any way connected 
with the administration of justice originates with him.. In’ 
England the Attorney-General is consulted upon the law. In 
Ireland he is almost the law itself: he not only approves,’ 
but he directs. The personal character of Mr. Saurin gave: 
him an additional sway, He gained a great individual ascen- 
dency over the mind of the Lord Chancellor. In the Castlet 
Cabinet he was almost supreme; and his authority was the.

HIS POLITICAL INCONSISTENCY. 161 
for they, were envenomed with the most deleterious trath. 
Prosecutions were instituted and conducted, , by Mr. Saurin: an 
ebullition of popular resentment wa» ihe result, and reciprocal 
animosity was engendered out of mutual recrimination. The 
orators were furious upon one hand, and Mr. Saurin became 
enraged upon the other. His real character was disclosed in 
the collision. He was abused, I admit, and vilified. The 
foulest accusations were emptied, from their aerial abodes, by 
pampbleteers, upon his head. The authors of the garret dis- 
charged their vituperations upon him.. It was natural that he 
should get into bad odor; but wedded as he was to the public 
interests, he should have borne these aspersions of the-popular 
anger with a thore Socratic temper. Unhappily, however, 
he was infected by this shréwish spirit, and took to scolding. 
In his public speeches a weak virulence and spite were man: 
ifested, which, in such a man, was deeply to be deplored, © 
Much of the blame ought, perhaps, to attach to those who 
baited him into fury; and it is not greatly to be regretted, 
that many of them were gored and tossed in this ferocious 
contest. The original charges brought against him were un- 
just; but the vehemence with which they were retorted, as 
well as repelled, divested them, in some degree, of their 
calumnious quality, and exemplified their truth. Mr. Saurin 
should have recollected, that he had at one time given utter- 
ance to language nearly as intemperate himself, and had laid 
down the same principles with a view to a distinct application. 
He had harangued upon the will of the majority, and he for- 
got that it was constituted by the Papists. On a sudden he 
was converted, from a previous neutrality, into the most vio- 
Jent opponent of Roman Catholic Emancipation. I entertain 
little doubt that his hostility was. fully as personal as it was 
constitutional. There appears to be a great inconsistency 
between his horror of the Union and of the Catholics. They 
ave as seven to one in the immense population of Ireland; 
and when they are debased by political disqualification, it can 
only be justified upon the ground that it promotes the interests 
of the Empire. . 
“But Mr. Saurin discarded the idea*of making a sacrifice

of Ireland to Imperial considerations, when the benefits of the 
Union were pointed out. I fear, also, that he wants magria-~ 
nimity, and that his antipathies are influenced in part by his 
domestic recollections. His ancestors were persecuted’ in. 
France; but his gratitude to the country in which they found 
a refuge, should have suppressed any inclination to retaliate: 
upon the religion of the majority of its people. I shall not 
expatiate upon the various incidents which distinguished this: 
period of forensic turmoil. Suffice it to say, that Mr. Saurin 
obtained verdicts of condemnation. But his high character: 
and his peace of mind were affected by his ignominious ‘suc~" 
cess. He grew into an object of national distaste. His own- 
personal dispositions, which are naturally kind and good, were 
materially deteriorated. Every man at the bar with liberal 
opinions on the Catholic question, was regarded by him ‘with 
dislike. A single popular sentiment was a disqualification for 
place. 
But let me turn from the less favorable points of his char- 
acter. This censure should be qualified by large commen: 
dation. His patronage was confined to his party, but it was 
honorably exercised. Those whom he advanced were able 
and honest men. The sources of justice were never vitiated 
by any-unworthy preferences upon his part. Neither did he 
lavish emolument on his own family. In the list of pensioners 
the name of Saurin does not often bear attestation to his power. 
I should add to his other merits his unaffected modesty. ‘He 
has always been easy, accessible, and simple. He had none. 
of the “morgue aristocratique,” nor the least touch of official: 
superciliousness on his brow. 
Mr. Saurin, as Attorney-General, may be said to have gov- 
erned Ireland for fifteen years ;* but, at the moment when he 
seemed to have taken the firmest stand upon the beight of his 
authority, he was precipitated to the ground. The Grenvilles 
joined the minister. “It was stipulated that Plunket should 
be restored to his former office. Mr. Saurin was offered the 
place of Chief-Justice of the King’s Bench, which in a fit of. 
splenetic vexation he had the folly to refuse. The new local

government did not give him a moment for repentance, and he 
was thrown at once from the summit of his power. There was 
not a.single intervening circumstance to break his precipitous 
descent, and he was stunned, if not shattered, in the fall. He 
might, however, have expected it; he had no political con- 
nections to sustain him. He is married, indeed, to a sister of 
the Marquis of Thomond ; -but that alliance was a feeble ob- 
stacle to the movement of a great party. . 
His official friends immolated him to exigency, but they 
would have sacrificed him to convenience. The only man in 
power, perhaps, who personally lamented his ill usage, was 
Lord. Manners; and even his Lordship .was ‘aware, for six 
months before, of the intended change, and never disclosed it 
to him in their diurnal walks to the Hall of the Four Courts. 
This suppression Mr. Saurin afterward resented; but, upon @ 
declaration from his friend that he was influenced by a regard 
for his feelings, they were reconciled. He did not choose to 
warn him, at the banquet, of the sword that he saw suspended 
over his head. ‘ 
He is now [1823] plain Mr. Saurin again, and he bears this 
reverse with a great deal of apparent, and some real, fortitude. 
When he was first deprived of his office, I watched him in the 
Hall. The public eye was upon him; and the consciousness 
of general observation in calamity inflicts peculiar pain. The . 
_ joyous alacrity of Plunket was less a matter of comment than 
"the resigned demeanor of his fallen rival. Richard was as 
much gazed at as Bolingbroke* It was said by most of those 
_who saw him, that he looked as cheerful as ever. In fact, 
he looked more cheerful, and that appeared to me to give evi- 
dence of the constraint which he put upon himself. There 
was a forced hilarity about him-——he wore an alertness and 
vivacity, which were not made for his temperament. His 
genuine smile is flexible and easy ; but upon this occasion it 
lingered with a mechanical procrastination upon the lips, 
which showed that it did not take its origin ‘at the heart.

" ‘Phere was also too ready a proffer of the hand to his old friends, .“ 
who gave him a warm but a silent squeeze. 
I thought him a subject for study, and followed him into the 
Court of Chancery. He discharged his business with’ more 
than his accustomed diligence and skill;—~but when his part 
was done, and he bent his head over a huge brief, the pages 
of which he seemed to tun without a consciousness of their 
contents, I have heard him heave at intervals a low. sigh. 
‘When he returned again, to the Hall, I have observed him in 
a moment of professional leisure while he was busied with 
own solitary thoughts, and I could perceive a gradual lang or 
stealing over the melancholy mirth which he had been pergon-' 
ating before. His figure, too, was bent and depressed, as he. 
walked back to the Court of Chancery; and before he passed 
through the green curtains which divide it from the Hall; ¥ 
have seen him pause for an instant and throw a look at the-— 
King’s Bench. It was momentary, but too full of expression’ 
to be casual, and seemed to unite in its Gespondency a deep 
sense of the wrong which he had sustained from his friends, _ 
and the more painful injury which he had inflicted upon him- 
self. 
If Rembrandt were living i in our times, he should paint a- 
portrait of Saurin: his countenance and deportment would 
afford an appropriate subject to the shadowy pencil of that 
     
   
  ,great artist. There should be no gradual melting of colors 
into each other; there should be no softness of touch, and no 
nice variety of hue; there should he no sky-~no flowers—no 
drapery —no marble; but a grave and sober-minded man should 
stand upon the canvass, with the greater proportion of his figure 
in opacity and shadow, and with a strong line of light breaking 
through a monastic window upon his corrugated brow. His 
countenance is less serene than tranquil; it has much deliber- 
ate consideration, but little depth or wisdom; its whole ex- 
pression is peculiarly quiet and subdued. His eye is black 
and wily, and glitters under the mass of a rugged and shaggy 
eyebrow. There is a certain. sweetness in its glance, some. 
what at variance with the general indications of character 
which are conveyed in his look. His forehead is thoughtful,

recent care. : 
_ There is a want of intellectual elevation in his aspect, but 
he has a cautious shrewdness and a discriminating perspica- 
city. With much affability and good nature about the mouth, 
in the play of its minuter expression, a sedate and permanent 
vindictiveness may readily be found. His features are broad 
and deeply founded, but they are not blunt; without being 
destitute of proportion, they are not finished with delicacy or 
point, His dress is like his manners, perfectly plain and re- 
markable for its neat propriety. He is wholly free from vul- 
garity, and quite denuded of accomplishment. He is of the 
middle size, and his frame, like his mind, is compact and well 
knit together. There is an~intimation of slowness and suspi- 
cion in his movements, and the spirit of caution seems to regu- 
late his gait. He has nothing of the Catilinarian walk,* and 
it. might be readily conjectured that he was not destined for a 
conspirator. 
His wholé demeanor bespeaks neither dignity nor meanness, 
There is no fraud about him; but there is a disguise of his 
emotions which borders upon guile. His passions are violent, 
and are rather covered than suppressed: they have little effect 
upon his exterior—the iron stove scarcely glows with the in- 
tensity of its internal fire. He looks altogether a worldly and 
sagacious.man—sly, cunning, and considerate—not ungener- 
ous, but by no means exalted — with some sentiment, and no 
sensibility: kind in his impulses, and warped by involuntary 
prejudice: gifted with the power of dissembling his own feel- 
ings, rather than of assuming the character of other men: more 
acute than comprehensive, and subtle than refined: a man of © 
point and of detail: .no-adventurer either in conduct or specu-

I have mentioned his French origin, and it is legibly ex- 
pressed in his lineaments and hue. In other countries, one 
national physiognomy prevails through the mass of the péo- 
ple. In every district and in every class we meet witha 
single character of face. But in Ireland, the imperfect-graft- 
ing of colonization is easily perceived in the great variety. of. 
countenance which is everywhere to be found: the notches 
are easily discerned upon the original stock. |

. Fo revert to Mr. Saurin (from whom I ought not, perhaps, 
to have deviated so far), there is still greater distinctness, as’ ~ 
should be the case, from their proximity to their source, in the 
descendants from the French Protestants who obtained an asy- 
lum in Ireland. The Huguenot is stamped upon them ;* I can 
read in their faces, not only the relics of their. country, but of 
their religion. They are not only Frenchmen in color, but 
Calvinists in expression. They are serious, grave, and almost 
sombre, and have even a shade of fanaticism diffused over the 
worldliness by which they are practically characterized. Mr. 
Saurin is no fanatic; on the contrary, I believe that his only 
test of the true religion is the law of the land. He does not 
belong to the “saint party,” nor is he known by the sanctimo-~ 
nicks avidity by. which that pious and. rapacious body is dis- 
tinguished at the Irish bar. Still there is a touch of, _Jobn

éncomium. He is not a great case-lawyer. He is not like 
Sergeant Lefroy,* an ambulatory index of discordant names} 
he is stored with knowledge: principle is not merely deposited- 
in his memory, but inlaid and tesselated in his mind: it enters 
into his habitual thinking. No man is better versed in the art 
of putting facts: he brings with a peculiar felicity and skill 
the favorable parts of his client’s case into prominence, and 
shows still greater acuteness in suppressing or glossing over 
whatever may be prejudicial to his interests. He invests the 
most hopeless, and I will even add, the most dishonest cause, with 
a most deceitful plausibility ; and the total absence of all effort, 
and the ease and apparent sincerity of his manner, give him at 
times a superiority even to Plunket himself, who, by the energy 
‘into which he is hurried at moments by his more ardent and 
eloquent temperament, creates a suspicion that it must bea 
bad cause which requires so much display of power. In hedr-- 
ing the latter, you are perpetually thinking of him and his 
faculties; in hearing Saurin, you remember nothing but the 
cause—he disappears in the facts. 
_- Saurin also shows singular tact in the management of the 
Court. Lord-Chancellor Manners is acttally bewildered by 
Plunket: it is from his Lordship’s premises that he argues 
against him: he entangles him in a net of sophistry wrought 
_ out of his own suggestion. This is not very agreeable to hi- 
man vanity, and Chancellors are men. Saurin, on the other 
hand, accommodates himself to every view of the Court. He 
gently and insensibly conducts his Lordship to a conclusion — 
Plunket precipitates him into it at once. But Lord Manners 
struggles hard upon the brink, and often escapes from his 
grasp. . 
~, In this faculty of adaptation to the previous opinions and 
character of the judge whom he addresses, I consider Saurin 
as perhaps the most useful advocate in the Court of Chancery 
—at the same. time, in reach of thought, variety of attribute, 
versatility of resource, and power of diction, he is far inferior 
to his distinguished succesgdr in office. But Plunket is a sena-

tor and a statesman, and Saurin is a lawyer—not a mere one, 
indeed; but the legal faculty is greatly predominant in his 
aind.~ His leisure has never been dedicated to the acquisition 
of scientific knowledge, nor has he sought a relaxation from 
his severer occupations in the softness of the politer arts. His 
earliest tastes and predilections were always in coincidence 
with his profession. Free from all literary addiction, he not 
only did not listen to, but never heard, the solicitations of the 
Muse. Men with the strongest passion for higher and more 
elegant enjoyments have frequently repressed that tendency, 
from a fear that it, might lead them fromthe pursuit of more 
substantial objects. 
It was not necessary that Me. Saurin should stop his ears. 
against the voice of the siren—he was born deaf to her en- 
chantments. I believe that this was a sort of good fortune in 
his nature. Literary accomplishments are often of prejudice, 
and very seldom of any utility, atthe bar. The profession 
itself may occasionally afford a respite from its more rigid avo- 
cations, and invite of its own accord to a temporary deviation 
from its more dreary pursuits. There are moments in which a 
faniiliarity with the great models of eloquence and of high 
thinking may be converted into use. But a lawyer like Mr. 
Saurin will think, and wisely perhaps, that the acquisition of 
the embellishing faculties is seldom attended with a sufficiently 
frequent opportunity for their display, to compensate for the 
dangers of the deviation which they require from the straight- 
forward road to professional eminence, and will pursue his 
progress—like the. American traveller, who, in journeying 
through his vast prairies, passes without regard the fertile 
landscapes which occasionally lie adjacent to his way, and 
never turns from his track for the sake of the rich fruits and 
the refreshing springs of those romantic recesses, which, how- 
ever. delicious they may appear, may bewilder him in a wil- 
derness of sweets, and lead him for ever astray from the final 
object, of his destination. :

  HENRY Joy. nt * 
“Mr. Joy, the présent Solicitor-General for Ireland [1823], 
and the anti-papistical associate in office of the chief-advocate 
of the’ Roman Catholic claims, Mr. Plunket, is the son of a 
literary man, who was the editor of a newspaper in Belfast.* 
To the violent spirit which characterized the democratic. meu- 
brations of the father, I am inclined to attribute a mistake‘into - 
which the public have fallen with respect to the juvenile pro- 
“pensities of the son: Mr. Joy is commonly considered to have 
been addicted to liberal principles in his early life, and has 
been reproached. with having started a patriot. But whiggism 
i8 not a family disorder, nor have I been able to discover any 
‘ grounds for thinking that Mr. Joy was at any time the profes- 
sor of opinions at variance with his pregent political creed. 
* Henry Joy, born in 1767, was called to the Irish bar in 1788. He was 
a good lawyer, as well as an able. advocate. He had a very good-humored, 
insinuating way with witnesses as well as juries, and was happy at retort: In 
1827, when Plunket was made Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas, he was 
succeeded’ as Attorney-General, by Joy. In 1831, on the retirement of Lord, 
Gaillamore! (Standish O’Grady), Mr, Joy became Chief Baron of the Ex- 
chequer, and held that high office until his death, which took place, near Dublin, . 
on June'5, 1838,—Chief Baron Joy was an impartial and humane administra- 
tor of the law. ‘He waa repeatedly pressed to enter Parliament, but always 
declined.—His name presented an obvious subject for Lord Norbury’s wit. 
An attorney, named Hope, prayed his Lordship to wait a few moments for his 
leading Counsel, Mr. Joy, who was unavoidably detained and would pres- | 
ently attend. His Lordship’s very-small stock of patience was soon exhausted 
and he said, “ We can wait no longer-— . 
‘¢ Although Hope told a flattering tale, 
And said the Joy would soon return,’” 
and directed the next case to be called on. —M.

Since he was ealled to the Bar, which was in the year 1788,-1 
can not find’a single deviation in his conduct from the path of 
obvious. prudence, which his instinctive tendencies would 
naturally have led him to adopt, and to which his matured 
experience must have instructed him to adhere. It required 
little sagacity to perceive that by allying himself with the 
religious and aristocratic passions of the prosperous faction, he 
-was much more likely to attain distinction, than by any chival-| 
yous dedication of his abilities to a more noble, but unrequiting 
‘cause. 
Had he had the misfortune to inherit so sterile and unprofit- 
able a patrimony as the love of Ireland, he might still, perhaps, 
have risen to eminence and honor.. But his success- would 
have been achieved in despite of his principles. By choosing 
a different course he has succeeded through them. Instead of 
the difficult and laborious path by which so few have won their 
way, and which is filled not only with obstacles but thorns, lie 
selected the smoother road, the progress in which is as easy as 
it is sure—which is thronged by crowds, who, instead of: 
impeding individual advancement, sustain and bear each other 
on—and which not only leads with more directness to a 
splendid elevation, but is bordered with many fertile and rich 
retreats, in which those who are either unable or unwilling to 
prosecute their journey to the more distant and shining objects _ 
to which it conducts at last, are certain of finding an adjacent 
place of secure and permanent repose. In this inviting path, 
the weak and the incapable may sit down in ease and luxury, 
even in the lowest gradations of ascent; while the more vigor- 
ous and aspiring receive an impulse from the very ground they 
tread, and ‘are hurried rapidly along. Mr. Joy could not fail 
to see the advantages of this accelerating course, nor do I 
impute much blame to him for having yielded to its allure- 
ments. ‘He has, perhaps, acted from.that kind of artificial 
conviction, into which the mind of an honorable man may at 
last succeed. in torturing itself, Conscience, like every other 
judge, may be misled, and there is no advocate so eloquent as 
self-interest before that high, but not infallible tribunal. 
Whatever were his motives in choostng this judicious though

" not very exalted course, My. Joy soon distinguished himself by 
his zeal in his vocation, and became prominent among the 
stanch Tories at the Bar. He displayed in its fullest force 
that sort of sophisticated loyalty, of which vehement Protest- 
ants are in the habit of making a boastful profession in Ireland, 
- and carried the supererogatory sentiment into practice, even at 
the convivial mectings of the Bar. A lawyer, who has singe 
risen to considerable distinction, and whose youth was encom. 
“ passed by calamities, which it required a rare combinati 
talents and of fortitude to surmount, was selected by Mr: Jo; 
for an early manifestation of his devotedness to the cat e, 
which it required no very high spirit of prophecy to forése 
would be ultimately canonized by success. It was upon the 
motion of Mr. Joy, that the barrister to whom I allude, was 
expelled, for his republican tendencies, from the Bar-mess 
of the Northeast Circuit. In recommending so very rigor 
ous a measure, he gave proof of his earnestness and of his 
good taste. The expulsion of an associate, whom an almost 
daily intercourse ought to have invested with at least the sem- - 
plances of friendship, afforded abundant evidence of the 
cerity of the emotion with which he was influenced, while his 
discrimination was approved, by marking a man out for ‘ruin, 
whose endowments were sufficiently conspicuous to direct the 
general attention, not only to the peculiar victim that suffered 
in the sacrifice; but to the priest who presided at the immolation. 
This unequivocal exhibition of enthusiastic loyalty~ was 
followed by other instances of equally devoted and_not more — 
disinterested attachment to the government, and Mr. Toy 
gradually grew into the favor of those who are the distributers 
of honor and of emolument at the Bar. He did not, however, 
abuse the predilections of authority for any mean or inglorious 
purpose. He is, I believe, unsullied by any sordid passion; 
and whatever may-be his faults, avarice is not among them. 
He has never been an oceupant of any one of the paltry offices 
at the Bar, to the invention of which the genius of Irish Secre- 
taries is unremittingly applied. Aiming at loftier objects, be 
preserved a character for. independence, by abstaining from 
solicitation.

HIS SYMPATHY WITH SAURIN. 178 ~ 
- It would be tedious to trace his progress through the various 
stag’ sof professional success which conduct to celebrity at 
‘last; A lawyer advances by. movements almost impercepti- 
ble, from obscurity into note, and from note to fame; and 
would find it difficult to ascribe with certainty the consumma- 
tion of his success to any direct or immediate cause. It is by 
a continued series of meritorious effort and of fortunaté event, 
that eminence is to be attained at the Bar. I pass by the 
many. yeats of labor in which Mr. Joy, in obedience to the 
destinies of his profession, must have expended the flower of 
“hié life, and lead him directly to the administration of Mr. 
‘Saurin. “That gentleman, the Coryphieus of the Orange party, 
formed for Mr. Joy a strong political partiality. He found in 
My. Joy the cardinal virtue, which, in his opinion, is the hinge 
of all integrity and honor, and in the absence of which the 
highest genius and the deepest knowledge are wholly without 
avail. With Mr. Saurin, Orangeism in politics has all the 
efficacy of charity in religion, and in the person of Mr. Joy, 
he found many conspicuous qualities set-off by the full lustre of 
Protestantism. This community of sentiment engendered a 
virulent sympathy between them. 
Mr. Joy was appointed one of the three Sergeants, who take 
precedence after the Attorney and Solicitor General,* and .   
_* Tn Ireland there are only three Sergeants-at-Law, who are appointed by 
the Crown, and take precedence, after the Attorney and Solicitor General, over 
the-rest of the bar. In England, any barrister of a certain stending may “as- 
sume. the. coif”—that is, wear a wig with a black patch on the crown—pro- 
vided he-pay.the usual expenses, amounting to one hundred pounds sterling. 
He is then called “ Mr. Sergeant,” sits within the bar, with the Queen’s Coun- 
sel; and takes precedence with them. There is this disadvantage? as a Ser- 
geant-ut-Law can not hold a brief under any one but a Queen’s Counsel, or 
another Sergeant of seniority to himself, he is precluded, in point of fact, from 
being other than a leader in each case he appears in; and it sometimes happens 
that a barrister in good practice, whose ambition leads him to take the cvif, 
xoon finds himself briefiess—as he can not act as junior, and the attorneys may 
_ hot think so well of him as to employ him aga leader. In England, every law- 
Yer; previous.to taking his seat as a Judge, undergoes the formality and expense 
of being-made.a Sergeant-at-Law. When a barrister is of sufficient standing, 
usual ta make him “‘ one of Her Majesty’s Counsel,” which entitles him to 
sit within. the har, gives ‘him precedence aver the rest of the profession, and

enjoy a sort of customary right to promotion to the Bench. 
Even before they are raised to the judicial station, they ocea- 
stonally act in lieu of any of the judges, who may happen to 
‘be prevented by illness from going the circuit. The malady 
of a judge, to such an extent of incapacity, is not, however, of 
very frequent occurrence. A deduction from his salary, to the 
amount of four hundred pounds, is inflicted as a sort of penalty, 
in every instance in which he declines attending the assizés, 
and the expedient has been found peculiarly sanative. It tiot 
unfrequently happens that one of the twelve sages,* who: has 
entitles him to employment in all cases, civil and criminal, between the Croyn 
and the subject. Out of a bar consisting of about six hundred, in England, 
between forty and fifty are Queen’s Counsel; so that the distinction, which is 
seldom conferred except for merit, is an important one, as it virtually bestows 
professional rank on the recipient. A Queen’s Counsel may be employed 
against-thoe Crown, in the courts of law, on paying a fee of ten guineas, and 
obtaining permission, which is rarely refused, from the Attorney-General, But 
-the Crown has a:prior right to his services, if it require them. What is called 
“a patent of precedency” is sometimes given to Sergeants-at-Law, which places 
them, according to its date, in possession. of all the privileges enjoyed by 
Queen’s Counsel. Mr. Sergeant Wilkins, the ablest- advocate now at the Eng- 
lish har, has such a patent. Mr. O’Connell, who was for many years at the 
_. head of his profession in Ireland, never was made Counsel to the Crown, owing 
‘tohis politics being hostile to those of the Lord-Chancellor (Manners), who 
hhad the disposal of such honors. Eventually, he received a patent of ‘prede- 
* dency. In the Ecclesiastical Courts, no barristers are allowed to plead unless 
they have taken the degree of Doctor of Civil Law, at one of the Universities. 
In England, politics are seldom regarded now-in the disposal of silk-gowns. 
-This may require explanation: a Queen’s Counsel wears a silken and an ordi- 
nary barrister a stuff gown. The former, on solemn occasions, hides his head 
in a fall-bottomed wig, made of horsehair, and whitened with flour or powdered 
staich: the latter wears a plain peruke, of the same quality, with two small 
tails behind. Hence the saying, “ The wisdom’s in the wig!” There are nei- 
ther Queen’s Counsel, nor Sergeants-at-Law, nor patents of precedency, at: tthe 
Scottish bar; but they get on very well without them.~—M. 
* In Ireland, besides two équity Judges (Lord Chancellor and Master of ‘the 
Rolls), there are twelve principal Judges, who dispose of criminal and nist 
prius cases. In Scotland, there are thirteen Judges, of whom, seven are Lords 
of the Justiciary or chief criminal Court. In England, there are seven equity, 
and fifteen principal Judges for criminal cases. In England and Ireland, there 
are also Judges of the Prerogative and Ecclesiastical Courts. There also are 
_ sounty and other local Judges in every county of the United Kingdom, besides 
Commissioners of Bankruptcy and Insolvency. The largest salary is the Lord

trumpet, starts, as it were into a judicial resurrection, and, pre- 
ceded, by the gorgeous procession of bum-bailiffs, bears his 
cadaverous attestation. through the land, to the miraculous 
agency of the King’s commission. “ 
However, it does upon occasion happen that this restorative, 
powerful as it is, loses its preternatural operation, and one of 
-the Sergeants is called upon to take the place of any of the 
ermined dignitaries of the Bench, who does not require the 
certificate.of a physician to satisfy the public of the reality 
of his venerable ailments. This proximity to the Bench gives 
@ Sergeant considerable weight. In xaising Mr. Joy to an 
“office which affords so many honorable anticipations, Mr. 
Saurin must have been sensible that he added to his personal 
influence, by the elevation of so unqualified an adherent to the 
party of which he was the head. Mr. Joy had, besides, a high 
individual rank. Before his promotion his business was con- 
siderable, and it afterward rapidly increased. It was princi- 
Chancellor’s—ten thousand pounds sterling, a year, in England. The average 
salaries of the other principal Judges are about five thousand pounds sterling 
ayear. The County Court Judges receive about one thousand pounds sterling 
per annum in England and Ireland, and about eight hundred pounds sterling 
in Scotland. All the appointments are for life. No Judge is removable by 
the Crown (except the Lord Chancellor, who retires with the Ministry, of 
whom he is one), but his removal can take place on an address from both 
Houses of Parliament, after gross misconduct is proven before them. Every 
Judge, on retiring, after fifteen years’ service, or ill-health, has a lift-pension 
of two’ thirds of his salary, but the Lord Chancellor, however brief his tenure 
of office, bas a pension of five thousand pounds sterling a year, as, having once 
quitted the Bar, for the Bench, he can not resume his practice in the Courts of 
_ Law: But the ex-Chancellors, all of whom are peers, sit in the House of 
Lords, every Session, hearing appeals from the different law-Courts throughout 
the whole Empire (Colonies included) and thus render great service, fully the 
value of their pensions, to the public. The House of Lords is the highest 
court of judicature in the British Empire, and “the Law Lords,” us they are 
ealled, chiefly give the decisions—the lay-lords, who are not lawyers, seldom 
interfering. For the last eighteen years, Lord Brougham, in particular, has 
devoted his time, energies, and vast knowledge, to the adjudication of Appeals

pally augmented in Chancery, where pre-audience is of the 
“utmost moment. Lord Manners is disposed to allow too deep 
‘permanence to the earliest impression, and whoever firat 
‘addresses him has the odds in his favor. The enjoyment ‘of 
priority swelled the bag of Mr. Joy; which was soon distended 
into an equality with that-of Mr. Bushe. : 
That great advocate found-in Mr. Joy a dangerous compet- 
itor. The latter was generally supposed to be more pro- 
foundly read, and. the abstiact principles. of equity were traced 
by sagacious solicitors in the folds and furrows of his brow. 
The eluquénce of Bushe was little appreciated by men who 
thought, that because they had been delighted they ought — 
not to have been convinced. Joy had a more logical aspect 
im the eyes of those who conceive that genius affords prima 
Sacie evidence .against knowledge, and grew into a gradual 
preference at the Chancery bar. It was no light recommen- 
dation.to him that he was the protége of Saurin, who could not - 
_ bring himself to forgive the liberalism of his colleague, and 
was, not unwilling to assist the prosperous competition of his 
- more Protestant éléve. His strenuous protection gave strong 
reasons to Bushe to tremble at Joy’s pretensions to the highest 
seat upon the Bench. Bushe had himself declined the office 
of a puisne judge,* in the just expectation of attaining to 
that, which he at present occupies in a manner so useful to 
the country and so creditable to himself. But he was doomed - 
to the” endurance of a long interval of suspense before his 
present fortunate, and I may even call it accidental, elevation. 
He had already been sufiiciently annoyed by the perverse 
longevity of Lord Norbury,t and the no less vexatious hesi-

of another candidate for the. object of his protracted aspira- 
tions, had well nigh. broken his spirit, and. reduced him to 
despair. 
It was at one time quite notorious, that if a vacancy had 
occurred in the Chief-Justiceship of the King’s Bench, Saurin 
would have exercised his influence in behalf of his favorite ; 
and it was almost equally certain that his influence would have 
‘prevailed. In the general notion, Joy was soon to preside in 
the room of Downes, and his*own demeanor tended not a little 
to confirm it, The auspices of success were assembled in his 
aspect,as Conspicnously as the omens of disaster were collected 
in the bearing of Mr. Bushe. The latter exhibited all the 
most painful symptoms of the malady of prociastinated. hope. 
The natural buoyancy of his spirit sunk under the oppressive 
and accumulated solicitude that weighed upon him. Conscious 
of the power of our emotions, and of the readiness with which 
they break into external results, he was ever on his guard 
against them. He well knew how speedily misfortune is de- 
tected by the vulgar and heartless crowd we call the world, 
and made every effort to rescue himself from their ignominious 
commiseration. To escape from a sentiment which is so closely 
connected with contempt, he wrought himself: at moments into 
a wild and feverish hilarity ; ; but the care that consumes the 
heart manifested itself, in spite of all his efforts to conceal it. 
His bursts of high-wrought joyousness were speedily followed 
by the depression. which usually succeeds to an unnatural ine- 
mob, who mistook him for Lord Carleton, the Judge who presided at the trial and. 
condemnation of Henry and’John Sheares, in 1798. Downes was appointed 
to succeed Lord Kilwarden, as Chief Justice of the King’s Bench. He was 
raised to the peerage, as Baron Downes (with remainder, on default of lawful 
male issue, to his cousin, the gallant Sir Ulysses de Burgh, the present peer), on 
his relinquishing the ermine in March, 1822. He died, at a very advanced age, 
in March, 1825. Lord Downes was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dublin, 
He was a large, unwieldy man, and Curran described him as “a human quag- 
mire,” —-on the bench, he was tremulous as if he were composed of calves’=

. biiation of the mind; his eyes used to be fixed in a heavy 
and abstracted glare; his face was suffused with a murky and 
unwholesome red — melancholy seemed to “bake his blood.” 
He was vacant when disengaged, and impatiént when occu- 
pied, and every external circumstance about him attested the 
workings of solicitude that were going on within. It was 
truly distressing to see this eloquent, high-minded, and gen: 
erous man, dying of the ague of expectation, and: alternately 
shivering with wretched disappointment, and inflamed with. 
miserable hope. 
Joy, on the other hand, displayed all the characteristics of 
prosperity, and would have been set down by the most casual’ 
observer as a peculiarly successful man. An air of: good for-- 
tune was spread around him: it breathed from his face, and 
was diffused over all that he said and did. His eyes twinkled 
with the pride of-authority. His brow assumed by anticipation 
the solemnity of the judicial cast; he seemed to rehearse the 
. part of Chief Justice, and to be already half seated “on the 
highest place upon the Bench. But suddenly it was plucked 
from beneath him. Lord Wellesley arrived* —Saurin was pre- 
cipitated from his office. In a paroxysm of distempered magna- 
nimity he disdained to accept the first judicial station; and 
Bushe, to his own astonishment, grasped in permanence and 
_ security that object of half his life, which had appeared so 
long to fly from his pursuit, and, just before the instant of its 
-attainment, seemed, like a phantasm, to have receded from his 
reach for ever. Bushe is now Chief-Justice of the King’s 
Bench [1823]; and that he may long continue to preside 
* As Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. After the visit of George IV., when thé - 
Catholics showed a superabundance of “ loyalty,” it was resolved to favor them 
with a more liberal ruler than the late Earl Talbot, who was.a decided partisan 
.of “ Protestant Ascendency in Church and State.” The Marquis Wellesley 
was sent over—partly because he was liberal und friendly to the Catholic 
claims, and partly because he was poor, and the twenty thousand pounds ster+ 
ling a year salary was an object to him. At the same time, Mr. Saurin, the 
virtual and intolerant ruler of the country, was dismissed, to be succeeded by 
Plunket, the eloquent advocate of Emancipation.—Lord Wellesley in Sreland

there, is the wish of every man hy whom indiscriminate urban- 
ity to the bar, unremitting attention to the duties of his office, 
and a perfect competence to their discharge —the purest im- 
partiality and a most noble intellect —are held in value. 
. Notwithstanding that the Bench was withdrawn from Mr. 
Joy, while"he was almost in the attitude of seating himself 
upon it, he did not fall to the ground. Bushe’s promotion left 
a.vaeancy in the office of Solicitor- General, and it was ten- 
dered to Mr. Joy. This was considered a little singular, as 
his opinions were well known to be exactly opposite to those 
of the new ‘Attorney-General, Mr. Plunket. That cireum- 
stance, however, so far from being a ground of objection, was, 
‘Tam inclined to think, a principal motive for submitting the’ 
vacant place to his acceptance. It had been resolved to 
compound all parties together. The more repulsive the ingre- 
dients, the better fitted ‘they were for the somewhat empirical 
process of conciliation, with which Lord Wellesley had under- 
taken to mix them up together. The government being itself an 
anomaly —a thing “of shreds and patches’—it_was only 
consistent that the legal department should be equally hete- 
rogeneous, To this sagacious project, the conjunction of two 
persons who differ so widely from each other as Mr. Plunket 
and Mr. Joy, is to be attributed. The latter was blamed by 
many of his friends for the promptitude with which he allied 
himself to the new administration, for he did not affect the 
coyness which is usually illustrated by a proverbial reference , 
to clerical ambition. He was well aware that if he indulged 
in the mockery of a refusal, amid the rapid fluctuations of an 
undecided government, he might endanger the ultimate pos- 
session of so valuable’ an office. He did not put on any 
virgin reluctances, nor seem “fearful of his wishes,’ but em- 
braced the fair opportunity with a genuine and unaffected 
ardor. 
Mr. Joy is justly accounted one of the ablest men at the Irish 
Bar. .In the sense in which eloquence, and especially in Ireland, 
is generally understood, I do not think that it belongs to him 
in’ “a very remarkable degree. At times his.manner is very 
strenuous, but ener By is by no mearis the characteristic of his

speaking. I have seen him, upon occasion, appeal to juries 
with cor8iderable force, and manifest that honest indignation 
in' the reprobation of meanness- and of depravity, which is 
always sure to excite an exalted sentiment in the minds of 
men. The sincere enforcement of good principle is among the 
noblest sources of genuine oratory; and he that awakens a 
more generous love of virtue and lifts us beyond the ordinary’ 
sphere of our moral sensibilities, produces the true results of- 
eloquence. This Mr. Joy has not unfrequently accomplished, 
but his habitual cast of expression and of thought is too much 
subdued and kept under the vigilant control of a ‘timid and 
suspicious taste, to be attended with any very signal and 
shining effects, He deals little in that species of illustration 
which indicates a daring and adventurous mind; that seeks’ . 
to deliver its strong, though not always matured, conceptions 
in bold and lofty phrase. Its products may be frequently im- 
perfect, but a single noble thought that springs full formed 
from the imagination, compensates for all its abortive offspring. 
Mr. Joy does not appear to think so, and studiously abstains ~ 
from the indulgence of that propensity to figurative decoration; 
which in Ireland is carried to some excess. Nature, I suspect, 
has been a little niggard in the endowment of his fancy; and 
if she has not given him wings for a sustained and lofty flight, 
he is wise in not using any waxen pinions. I have never de- - 
tected any exaggeration in his speeches, either in notion or in 
_phrase. His language is precise and pure, but so simple’ as 
seareely to deviate from the plainness of ordinary discourse: * 
Ti was observed of Lysias that he seldom employed a word’ 
~ which was not in the most common use, but that his language’ 
was so measured as to render his style exceedingly melodious 
and sweet. Mr. Joy very rarefy has recourse fo an expression 
which is not perfectly familiar. But he combines the most 
trivial forms of phrase with so much art together, as to give 
thom a peculiarly rhythmical construction. Upon occasion, 
however, he throws into.a speech some ornamental allusion to 
his own favorite pursuits. He takes a flower or two from his

mountain andthe field. He is strongly addicted to the study 
of the méré-graceful sciences, and versed in shrubs, and birds, 
and: butterflies. 
+ In this respect he stands an honorable exception to most of 
the eminent members of the Bar, with whom all scientific and - 
literary acquirement is held in a kind of disrepute. Mr. Joy 
hag not neglected those sources of permanent enjoyment, which 
continue to administer their innocent gratifications, when al- 
most every other is dried up. He has employed his solitary 
leisure (for he is an old bachelor, and appears to be an invet- 
erate Mr. Oldbuck) in the cultivation. of elegant, althongh, in 
some instances, fantastic tastes. He is devoted to the loves 
of the plants, and spends in a well-assorted museum of curiosi= 
ties many-an‘hour of dalliance with an insect or ashell. It is 
not unnatural that his mind should be impregnated with his 
intellectual recreations; and whenever he ventures upon a 
metaphor, it may readily be traced to some association with 
his scientific pursuits. - . : 
With this rare exception, Mr. Joy may be accounted an un- 
adorned speaker. His chief merit consists in his talent for 
elucidation and for sneering. He is, indeed; so sensible of his 
genius for mockery, that he puts it into use wherever the least 
opportunity is afforded for its display. When it is his object 
to cover a man with disgrace, he lavishes encomium with a 
tone and.a look that render his envenomed praises more deadly 
- than the fiercest invective. He deals in incessant irony, and - 
sets off his, virulent panegyric with a smile of such baleful,de- 
vision as to-furnish a model to a painter for Goéthe’s Metemp- 
syphiles.* In. cross-examination he employs this formidable 
faculty with singular effect. 
Here he shows high excellence. He contemplates the wit- 
ness with the suppressed delight of an inquisitor, who calmly 
surveys his victim before he has him on the wheel. He does 
not drag him to the torture with a ferocious precipitation, and 
throw him at once into his torments, but with a slow and bland-- 
ishing suavity tempts and allures him on, and invites him to 
the point at which he knows that the means of infliction lie

in wait. He offers him a soft and downy bed in which the- 
rack is concealed, and when he is laid upon it, even then ‘he. 
does not put out all his resources of agony at once. He affects. 
to caress the victim whom he torments, and it is only after he. 
has brought the whole machinery of torture into action, that 
his purpose is perfectly revealed ; and even then, and when he is, 
in the fullest triumph of excruciation, he retains his seeming. 
and systematic gentleness; he affects to wonder at the pain 
which he applies, and while he is pouring molten lead int 
the wound, pretends to think it balm. 
The habitual irony which Mr. Joy is accustomed to pat. 
such efficient practice, has given an expression to his 
which is peculiarly sardonic. Whatever mutations hig comps. : 
tenance undergoes, are but varied modifications of a sn 
Tt exhibits in every aspect a phasis of disdain. Plunket’s 
face sins a little in this regard, but its expression is less con- 
temptuous than harsh. There is in it more of the acidity: of 
ill humor than of the bitterness of scorn. , His pride appears 
to result rather from the sense of his own endowments than 
from any depreciating reference to those of other men... But 
the mockery of Mr. Joy is connected with all the odium. of 
comparison :— ‘oO

The features upon which this perpetual derision is inlaid, 
are of a peculiar cast; —-they are rough-hewn and unclassical, 
and dispersed over a square and rectangular visage, without 
symmetry or arrangement. His mouth is cut broadly, and 
directly from one jaw to the other, and has neither richness, 
nor curve. There are in his cheeks two deep cavities, whieh: 
in his younger days might have possibly passed for dimples, 
hollowed out in the midst of yellow flesh. Here it is that 
Ridicule seems to have chosen her perpetual residence, for I do 
not remember to have'seen her give way to any more kindly 
or gentle sentiment. His nose is broad at tlie. root; its nostrils 
are distended, and it terminates in an.ascending point: but 
it is too short for profile, and lies in a side view almost com

The eyés ‘até dark, bright, and intellectual, but the lids are 
shiivelled“and pursed up in such a manner, and seemingly by 
an-act of will, as to leave but a small space between their 
contracted rims for the gleams of vision that are permitted to 
estape. They seem to insinuate that it is not worth their 
while to be open, ixf@rder to survey the insignificant object on 
which they may chance to light. The forehead is thoughtful 
and high, but fromthe posture of the head, which is thrown 
back’ and generally aside, it appropriately surmounts this 
singular assemblage of features, and Jends*an important con- 
tiibution to the sardonic effect of the whole. 
” His deportment is in keeping with his physiognomy. Ifthe ©

receiving Lord Amherst* at the palace at Pekin, and with 
* The British Government, always anxious to establish intimate commercial 
and political relations with China, despatched Lord Macartney, at the head of 
a special Embassy, in 1792. He and his suite reached China the following 
year, were received there, with all courtesy as “ tribute-bearers,” and were, 
promised an audience of the Emperor, provided they would perform the usual 
prostrations of the person made in the presence of his Majesty by his own sub- 
jects.. This was declined, but Lord Macartney finally offered to perform the 
Kou-to (as it is called) if some high officer of state would previously do like 
homage before a portrait of George III, Lord Macartney and Sir George 
Staunton actually had the promised audience, each kneeling on one ‘knee as 
they presented the Emperor with a magnificent gold box, richly adomed with 
jewels, which contained the King of England’s letter, which, with other pres- 
ents, was well received, and the return of the embassy requested. In 1816, 
Lord Amherst headed a second embassy, and strongly declined making the 
required nine prostrations to the Emperor, declaring he would pay him the 
same homage as he yielded to his own sovereign, and noe more —unless 2 Tar- 
tar mandarin of rank would perform the Ko-tou before the portrait of the Eng-

Ko-toued on the former occasion,,Lord Amherst agreed to do the same—but 
the Embassy waz literally hurried out of the country, to their ships on the coast, 
before this‘could be done. A reply to the Royal letter from England pompously 
intimated that it would not again be necessary to send “a tribute-bearer’ from 
such a distance. The two embassies cost about three hundred and fifty thou- 
sand pounds sterling. Napoleon (who was visited at St Helena by Lord Am- 
herst, on his. return from China), said he should have complied with the cus- 
toms of. the place, or not have been sent at all, for that what the chief men of

contemptuous courtesy proposing to his lordship the ceremony 
of the Ko-tou, he will form a pretty accurate notion of ‘the 
bearing, the manners, and the hue of Mr. Joy, his Majesty’s — 
Solicitor-General for Ireland.. He is extremely polite, but his. 
politeness is as Chinese as his look, and appears to be. dic. 
tated rather by a sense of what he owelto himself than by 
any deference to the person who. has the misfortune to be its. 
object. 
And yet with all this assumption of dignity, Mr. Joy i 
precisely dignified. He is in a perpetual effort to sustain. his 
consequence, and arms himself against the least invasion upon 
his title to respect. Of its legitimacy, however, he docs.not 
appear to be completely satisfied. He seems a spy upon-his, 
owh importance, and keeps watch over the sacred treasure 
with a most earnest and unremitting vigilance. Accord- 
ingly, he is for ever busy with himself. There is nothing ab- 
stract and meditative in his aspect, nor does his mind ever 
wander beyond the immediate localities that surround, him. 
There is “no speculation in his eye;” an intense conscious- 
ness pervades all that he says and does. I never yet sawhim | 
lost in revery. ‘ 
When disengaged from his professional occupations, he 
stands in the Hall with the same collected manner which he 
pore in the discharge of his duties to his client, and with his 
thoughts fastened to the spot. While others are pacing with 
rapidity along the flags which have worn out so many hopes, 
Joy remains in stationary stateliness, peering with a sidelong. 
look at the peristrephic panorama that revolves around him. 
The whole, however, of what is going on is referred to his own 
individuality ; self is the axis of the little world about him, 
and while he appears scarcely conscious of the presence of a . 
single person in all the crowd by which he is encompassed, he 
‘is in reality. noting down the slightest glance that may be con- 
nected with himself. 
There is something so artificial i in the demeanor of Mr, Joy, 
and especially in the authoritativeness which he assumes with 
the official silk in which he attires his person, that his external 
appearance gives but little indication of his character. His

dispositions are. much more commendable than a disciple of 
Lavater would be inclined to surmise. I suspect that his Aaw- 
teur is worn from a conviction that the vulgar are most inclined 
to reverence the man by whom they are most strenuously de- 
spised. Upon a-view of Mr. Joy, it would be imagined that 
he would not prove either a very humane or patient judge ;* 
but it is quite otherwise, and those who have had an opportu- 
nity of observing him in a judicial capacity upon circuit, con- 
cur in the desire. that he should: be _permanently placed in a 
situation for which he has already displayed in its transitory 
ogeupation so many conspicuous qualities.

OALAMITIES OF THE BAR. 
Nor very long after I had been called to the bar, I one day . 
chanced to observe a person standing beside a pillar in the Hall 
of the Four Courts, the peculiar wretchedness of whose aspect 
attracted my notice. . was upon my way to the subterranean 
chamber where the wigs and gowns of lawyers are kept, and 
was revolving at the moment the dignity and importance of 
the station to which I had been raised by my enrolment among 
the members of the Irish bar. I was interrupted in this inter- 
esting meditation by the miserable object upon which my eyes 
had happened to rest; and, without being a déettante in afflic- 
tion, I could not help pausing to consider the remarkable spe- 
cimen of wretchedness that stood before me. - 
Had the unfortunate man been utterly naked, his condition 
would ‘not have appeared so pitiable. His raiment served to 
set his destitution off. A coat, which had once been black, but 
which appeared to have been steeped in a compound of all rusty 
hues, hung in rags about him, It was closely pinned at his 
throat, to conceal the absence of a neckeloth. He was without 
avest. A shirt of tattered yellow, which from a time beyond 
memory had adhered to his withered body, appeared through 
numerous apertures in hig upper garment, and jutted out round 
that portion of his person where a garb without a name is usu- 
ally attached. The latter part of his attire, which was con- 
spicuous for a prismatig diversity of color, was fastened with a 
piece of twine to the extreme button of his upper habiliment, 
‘and very incompletely supplied the purpose for which the pro- 
genitors of mankind, after their first initiation into knowledge, 
employed a vegetable veil. Through the inferior-regions of

this ‘imperfect integument, there depended a shred or two of 
that inner-garment, which had been long sacred-to nastiness, . 
and which the fingers of the laundress never had profaned. 
His stockings were compounded of ragged worsted and accu- 
mulated mire. They covered a pair of fleshless bones, but did 
not extend to the feet, the squalid nakedness of which was 
visible through the shoes that hung soaked with wet about 
them. 
He was dripping with rain, and shivering with cold. His 
figure was shrunken and diminutive. “A few gray locks were 
wildly scattered upon a small and irregularly-shaped head. 
Despair and famine sat upon his face, which was of the strong 
* Celtic mould, with its features thrown in disorder, and ‘desti- 
tute of all symmetry or proportion, but deriving from the pas- 
sions, by which they were distorted, an expression of ferocious 
haggardness. His beard was like that which grows upon the 
dead. The flesh was of a cadaverous complexion. His gray 
eyes, although laden with rheum, caught a savageness from 
the eyelids, which were bordered with a jagged rim of diseased 
and bloody red. A hideous mouth was lined with a row of 
shattered ebony, and from the instinct of long hunger had ac- 
quired an habitual gape for food. The wretched man was 
speaking vehemently and incoherently to himself. It was a 
-sort of insane jabbering—a mad soliloquy, in which “my 
' Lord” was frequently repeated. 
- I turned away with a mingled sentiment of disgust and hor- 
ror, and, endeavoring to release my recollection from the pain- 
ful image which so frightful an object had left behind, I pro- 
ceéded to invest myself in my professional trappings: tied a 
band with precision about my neck ; complained, as is the wont 
with the junior bar, that my wig had not been duly besprinkled 
with powder, and that its curls were not developed with suffi- . 
cient amplitude; set it rectilinearly upon my head; and, after 
_ casting a look into the glass, and marking the “judicial organ 
in acertain prominence upon my brow, I readjusted the folds 
‘of my: gown, and reascended the Hail of the Four Courts in a 
_ pleasurable state of unqualified contentedness with myself. 
: Fdirected my steps to the Court of Chancery, and, having

certain sagacious aspirants to the office of Commissioner.of 
__Bankrupts, and.to dedicate the day to an experiment in nod- 
ding, which I had seen put into‘ practice with effect. There. _ 
are a set of juvenile gentlemen. who have taken for their motto 
the words of a Scotch ballad, which, upon a recent motion ‘for 
an injunction, Lord-Eldon* affected not. to understand,. but 
which, if he had looked for a moment upon the benches of 
youthful counsellors before him, while in the act of delivering 
a judicial aphorism, he would have found {nterpreted:i 
of. the senses of which they are susceptible, and have discaye 
ered.a meaning in “ We're all a-nodding,” of obvious applica 
tion to the bar, Confident in the flexibility of my neck,,and ° 
acertain plastic facility of expression, I imagined that,I 
not without some talent for assentation; and aceordingly'seated 
myself in suth a place that the eye of my Lord Manners, in 
seeking. refuge from the inquisitorial physiognomy of: Mx 
Plunket, would probably rest upon me. 5 
The Court began to fill, The young aristocracy of the: bar, 
the | sons of Ji udges, and fifth cousins of members of Parliament, 
and the.whole.rising generation of the Kildare-stréet:Club, 
gradually dropped in. Next appeared, at. the inner bar, the 
_more eminent practitioners tottering under their huge. bage, 
upon which many a briefless senior threw a mournful and:re- 
pining glance. First came Mr. Pennefather,t with his: calm

not to understand the Scotch dialect and pronunciation. He was once hi : 
appeals, in the House of Lords, and Mr. Clerk, an eminent Edinburgh lawy:

cent, “In plain English, my Lords,” was interrupted, half-seriously; by 1 Lord

following effect: “It is now, may it please your honorable

and a heavy heart, I followed the remains of your Lordship’s 
illustrious relative, the Duke of Rutland,* to the grave.” The   
    
  * Charles Manners, fourth Duke of Rutland, born in 1754, was appointed 
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1784, and died, while in office, in October, 1787, 
at the early age of thirty-three. He was cousin (three removed) to Lurd-Chan- 
«cellor Manners. He was a bon-vivant, and a man of pleasure. In the former 
capacity he was entertained by the Mayor of Cork, and, happening to praise 
some wine which was making the circuit of the board, was rather astounded 
at the Mayor's cool reply: “ Well, my Lord Duke, it és good claret, but nothing 
to be compared with a better quality in my cellar!” This Viceroy i: was who, 
in-a convivial moment, ‘when the wine was in,” insisted on knighting the 
landlord of the country inn at which he happened to be stopping, The next 
morning, he endeavored to pass it off as a joke, and, giving the landlord a 
handful of guineas, said, ‘Pat, you must not mind what passed last night} 
"twas alla joke.” Carefully pocketing the gold, the beknighted landlord. made 
his best bow, and said, “As to that, your Fixcellency, ’tis all one to me—but 
what will Lady O'Shaughnessy say?" To: his dying day, therefore, he contin- 
ued to be called Sir Patrick O'Shaughnessy. The Duke of Rutland was in the 
habit of visiting certain houses and persons of not quite the purest reputation. 
In his time, there was a handsome profligate, named Peg Plunket, who was 
presumed, and not untruly (as‘all accounts declare), to be very particularly in

evening, this fair and frail one made her appearance, and the wags called out,

moment this-sentence had been pronounced, and it was uttered 
with’ a: barbarous’ impressiveness, the’ Chancellor leaned -for- 
Ward, and assunied an aspect of profound attention. The bar 
immediately composed their features into sympathy with the 
judicial countenance, and a general expression of compassion 
pervaded. the court. 
The extraordinary orator continued: “ Yes, my Lord, the 
unfortunate man who stands before you, did, as a scholar of 
“Trinity College, attend the funeral-procession with which the 
members of the University of Dublin followed the relics of:

loyal part of the Irish nation (for, my Lord, I-am a Protestant); 
I felt for the loss of. your noble and ever-to-be-lamented kins- 
man.” (The bar looked up to Lord Manners, and, perceiving. 
his Lordship’s attention still more strongly riveted, preserved 
their gravity.) Oh, my-Lord, I feel that I am addressing 
myself to a man who carries a true nobleness of sentiment in 
every drop of his honorable blood. God Almighty bless. your

witha sly look at the Duke, exclaimed, “ Manners! you blackguards!” The

stance of calamity whieh Lhad just witnessed was a peculiar 
one, and carried with it more of the outward and visible signs 
of distress than are ordinarily revealed. But.is agony the less 
poignant, because, its groans are hushed? Is it becausé sorrow 
is silent, that it does not “consume the heart”? or did the 
Spartan feel less pain, because the fangs that tore him were 
hidden beneath his robe ? ‘ 
_ There is at the Trish bar a much larger quantity of affliction 
than is generally known. The necessity of concealing calam- 
ity is in itself a great ill, The struggle between poverty and 
gentility, which the ostentatious publicity of the profession in 
Ireland has produced, has, I believe, broken many hearts. If 
the Hall of the Four Courts were the Palace of Truth, and all 
jts inmates carried a transparency in their bosoms, we should 
see a swarm of corroding passions at court in ‘the breasts of 
many whose countenances are now arrayed in an artificial 
hilarity of look; and, even as it is, how many a glimpse’ of 
“misery may be caught by the scrutinizing eye that pierces 
through the faces into the souls of men! The mask ‘by which 
it is sought to conceal the real features of the mind will often 
drop off, and intimations of affliction will, upon a sudden, be 
involuntarily given. This is the case even with those whom 
the world is disposed to account among the prosperous; but 
there is a large class, who, to an attentive and practised ob- 
server, appear habitually under the influence of painful, emo- 
tion. The author of “ Vatliek” (a man conversant in affliction) 
has represented the condemned pacing through the Hall of 
Eblis with the, same: slow and everlasting footfall; and.I con- 
fess thatthe blank and dejocted air, the forlorn and hopeless

   “eye, the measured and heart-broken pace, of many a ad 
“whom I have observed in his revolution through the sanie eternal © 
round in the Hall of the Four Courts, have sometimes recalled . 
to me'the recollection of Mr. Beckford’s melancholy faridies. 
If I were called upon to -assign the principal cause, of ‘tlie 
calamities of which so many examples occur at the Irish ‘Bar, 
I should be disposed to say that their chief source lay in’ 
unnatural elevation to which the members of that bod: 
exalted by the provincial inferiority to which Iveland 
duced. The absence from the metropolis of the chief pr 
tors, and indeed of almost all the leading gentry, has o 
sioned the substitution of a kind of spurious aristocracy. 
Trish barrister is indebted for his importance to the insignifi-. 
+ eanée of his country ; but this artificial station becomes evett- 
ually a misfortune to those who are dependent upon their daily 
exertions for their support; and who, instead of practising those 
habits‘of provident frugality which are imposed by their.com- 
parative obscurity upon the cloistered tenants of the two Tem- — 
ples, become slaves to their transitory consequence ; and, after 
"having wasted the bard earnings of their youth and manhéod 
in preposterous efforts at display, leave their families no better 
“inheritance than the ephemeral sympathy of that public whose 
Worthless ‘respect they had purchased at so large a cost. * Let 
‘any tian look back to the numerous instances in which appeals 
have been made to the general commiseration upon the decease 
of some eminent member of the bar, and he will not be disposed 
to controvert the justice of this censure upon the ostentatious 
tendencies of the profession. . 
Treland is, I believe, the only country where there. exists | 
_ among the bar this preposterous tendency to ostentatious ex- 
 pensé.. - The French ‘bar, for example, live in respectable 
privacy, and are wholly free from’ extravagance. It is, I 
fancy, a mistake to suppose that the profits of the more emi- 
nent among them aré too. inconsiderable to permit of the 
silliness of display. The fees paid to French counsel of rep- 
utation, for their opinions, are large. Those opinions, indeed, 
are elaborate essays upon the law, and ara called “Consul- 
tations.” I had occasion, when in Paris, to consult Trippier,

whois accounted the. best lawyer in Paris. He lives in the: 
“Bue Croix des Petis Champs, in apartments of a small size 
and indifferently, furnished ; and although he has amassed a 
large fortune, and has only two daughters, lives with a pru- 
dence which, if an Irishman were to publish a dictionary of 
_synonymes, would be inserted as another name for avarice. I 
was not a little anxious to see this celebrated advocate, and 
waited impatiently in his study for his arrival. “A French 
lawyer accompanied me, who observed that all his books 
-related exclusively to law. The speeches of Cochin and Patin 
seemed, indeed, to. be the only works connected: with litera- 
ture in his library. I was informed that Trippier valued 
nothing but the profits of his trade, and that he was wholly 
innocent of the sin.of polite reading. At last the great legiste 
appeared. I was instantaneously struck with ‘his strong re- 
semblance to Curran. He is of precisely the same dimen- 
sions, has a countenance. cast in the same mould, the same 
complexion, the same irregularity of feature, and the same 
black and brilliant ¢ eye. It also surprised me to find that there 
was an affinity in the sound of the voice, and a similar ten- 
dency ‘to place the hand to the chin, and to throw up the head 
and eye in the act of speaking. He received us with brief 
courtesy,-and seemed very anxious that we should proceed at 
. once to the point: He placed himself in a huge chair, and 
assumed a most -oracular aspect. Iwas a good deal amused 
by the transition of his manner, in which there was not a little 
of the conjuror, He drew one knee over the other, and ex- . 
tended his foot, which was covered with a tight green. slipper. 
He wrapped himself up in his black silk robe de chambre, 
sustained his head with his left hand, fixed his fore finger on 
his brow, and, placing his right hand to his mouth, protruded 
his nether lip with an air of infallibility. - After hearing an 
oral statement, to which he gave an occasional nod, he put his 
fee into ‘his potket, and saying that the facts should be set 
forth upon paper, and that he should then write his opinion, 
bowed us out of the room.— Nota Bene, A French lawyer 
receives | a double fee on a written statement, and fifteen Napo- 
Jgons are not unusually paid to Trippier.

    “The life of an eminent lawyer may bethus rapidly sketch: 
—He is called without any other property than those tale 
“which have not in general a descendible quality. For some 
years he remains unemployed: at last gets a brief, creeps into - 
the partialities of a solicitor, and sets up a bag and @ wife 
together. Irish morality does not permit the introduction tnto 
the chambers of ‘a barrister of those moveable objects 
unwedded endearment, which Lord Thurlow used to reé 
mend to the juvenile members of the profession; and m 
tiage, that perpetual blister, is prescribed as- the only effect 
sanative for the turbulent passions of the Irish bar. 
In the spirit of imprudence, which is often mistaken ‘for 
_yomance, our young counsellor enters with some dowerles 
beauty into an indissoluble copartnership of the hear

~ with all the airs of fashionable impertinence ; and is the wife: 
“of a counsellor in full practice, though she may have ‘ridden 
double’ at her Aunt Deborah’s, to be unprovided with th: 
ordinary convenience of persons of condition?” After a faint 
show of resistance, the conjugal injunction is oheyed. 
But is it in an obscure street that the coachman is to bring 
his clattering horses to an. instantaneous stand? Is he to 
draw up in an alley, and to wheel round ina cul de sac? And 
then there is: such a bargain to be had of a house in Meixion- 
square. A house in Merrion-square is accordingly purchased, 
“and a bond, with warrant of attorney for confessing judgment 
thereon, is passed for the fine.- ‘The lady discovers a taste 
in furniture, and the profits of four cireuits are made oblations 
to-virtd. The counsellor is raised to the dignity of King’s 
Consul, and his lady is initiated into’ the splendors of’ the 
- Vice-Regal court.. She is now thrown into the éddies of fash- 
ionable life’; and in order to afford evidence of her domestic

while? He sits in a sequestered.chamber, like a hermit in the 
forest of Comns, and pursues his midnight labors by the light 
of a solitary taper, searcely hearing the din of ‘Pleasare that 
rolls above his head. 
The wasteful splendor of the drawing-room, and the patient

* Colles and Cheyne were at the head of the medical profession in Dubli 
for many years. . Abraham Colles, born in-1773, studied at- Dublin University, 
and was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1795. - Im« 
mediately after, he went to Edinburgh, then a great school of medicine; and 
there received the degree of M. D. He thence went to London, where ha’ 
pursued further’ anatomical studies and much assisted in making the disséc- 
tions from which were made the engravings in his friend Astley Cooper's work: 
on Hernia. Returning to Dublin, he was elected resident surgeon of Steven's’ 
Hospitel, which he continued from 1799 to 1833, and thence, as visiting sur- 
geon, to 1842, He became a member of the Irish College of Surgeons, 
many years Censor and thrice President of that body. He published sev: . 
valuable works on Surgery, and one on the “ Use of Mercury.” He died“in, 
December, 1843, aged 71 years. In 1804 he was made Professor of Anatomy. - 
and Surgery, in the College of Surgeons, and continued in that chair until 1836:, 
"The result of his lectures was this—that' there were sixty medical and surgi- 
cal students per annum, when he commenced, and the annual average ‘latterly’ 
was nearly a thousand. Dr. James ‘W. Powell, now of New York (the eminent. 
oculist), who-was one of Colles’ pupils, informs me that his lectures were “ un 
ambitious in language, clear in ‘arrangement, full of facts, sound in theory, 
plain in delivery, and crowded with practical illustrations.” In those essen- 
tials they resembled those of Abernethy, in London. Colles was an excellent 
anatoraist ~but averse to show or display. He was the first surgeon in Ireland. 
who ever tied the subclavial artery: an operation previously performed only 
twice in England. And, in this briefest notice, should be recorded that Colles, 
was the first surgeon in Europe who ever passed a ligature round the arteria 
jnnominata, the first and largest branch derived from the great trunk of the 
aorta. Colles was: somewhat of a humorist. In his fee-book, which he care~ 
fully kept from the commencement of his practice, he had many curious entries, 
suchas “ For giving ineffectual advice for deafness; one guinea; —for attempt: 
ing to draw out the stump of a tooth, one guinea;—for telling him that he 
was no more ill than I was, oné guinea ;—for nothing that I know, except that 
he probably thought he did not pay me enough last time, one guinea. + — Colles 
- wag offered: a baronetcy, which he. declined, sensibly saying that the distriby~ 
tion he: intended making of his landed property (worth two thousand pouds 
sterling a year) would not leave his eldest son sufficient to support an heredi- 
tary title. —Dr. John Cheyne, for many years at the head of the physicians 
-in Ireland, was a native of Scotland, and born in 1777. He served in the 
Artillery as surgeon, was on duty in Ireland, during the revolt of 1798, and 
on his return to Scotland, became acquainted with Mr. (afterward Sir Charles) 
Bell, with whom he studied pathology and anatomy. At the age of thirty-five, 
Dr. Cheyne settledin Dublin. The leading men in the profession, who speedily 
- pw that he understood acute diseases, as well as being acquainted with mor

are given, amid heart-broken sobs; and as he raises himeelf, 
and stretches forth his head to receive the final rite, he casts ° 
his eyes. upon the wretches who surround him, and shrinks

It is in the midst of a seene like this, and when the hour of

insolence echoes from. chamber to chamber; and, after a brief 
interval, the dreadful certainty, of which the unhappy man

officers have got in; his majesty’s writ of fiert facias is in the 
progress of execution; the sanctuaries of death are violated 
by the peremptory ministers of the law, and the blanket and

of a life of opulence and of distinction, and, let me add, of folly

made Professor of the practice of physic, to the College of Surgeons. This 
being during the Peninsular war, when there was a great demand for army-sur- 
geons, his lectures entered fully into military medicine, and were crowded du- 
ring five courses. He was appointed Physician to the House of Industry in 
1815; resigning his College Professorship and, in 1820, was appointed Phy- 
sician-General to the Army, the highest medical rank in Ireland. His annual 
income during the next ten years averaged five thousand pounds sterling, from 
private practice alone. In 1831, he was compelled, by the formation of the cli- 
macteric disease, which finally killed him, to retire from practice, amid the regret 
of all branches of. the profession, and took up his abode at Sherington, a small 
villoge in England, where (to use his own words) “ thinking it better to wear 
out than to rust out,’* he practised gratuitously among the poor, wrote some ar- 
ticles for “ The Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine,” and died on the last day 
of January, 1836. His family published a -posthumus work, written after his 
retirement, called, “ Essays on Partial Derangement‘of the Mind, in supposed 
connection with Religion,” in which his theory is that derangement of the mind 
invariably is connected with bodily disorder —that religious madness in the first 
instance, is perversion. of only one power of the mind-—that clergymen ecr in 
placing Divine truth before those laboring under mental delusion until the bod- 
ily disease with which it is connected is cured or relieved —~and that many of 
the doubts and fears of some religious persona depend either upon ignorance 
of the‘cutiritution and operations of the mind, or upon diseases of the body. —M,

.. The calamities of whicly I have drawn this sombre picteres 
are the result of weakness and ostentation. Their victims are; 
upon that account, less deserving of commiseration than the 
amhappy persons whose misfortunes: have not_been their fault. 
This obvious reflection recalls the image of Henry MacDougalh 
T hear his honest laugh, which it was good for a splenetie heart’ 
to hear; I see the triumph of sagacious humor in his eye; 
those feats of fine drollery,in which pleasantry and usefulness 
were 50 felicitously combined, rise’ again to my recollections 
the roar of merriment into which the bar, the jury, and the 
bench used to be thrown by this master of forensic mirth, xe= 
turns upon my-ear; but, alas! a disastrous token, with the 
types of death upon it, mingles itself with these associations: 
Poor MacDougall! he was prized by the wise and beloved by 
the good; and, with a ready wit and a cheerful and sonoreus 
laugh, he had a manly and independent spirit and a generous 
and feeling heart. vag 
Mr. MacDougall was at the head of the Leinster cireuit, and 
was, if not the best, among the. very first class of er oss-examis 
ners at the Bar. No man better knew how to assail an Irish 
witness. ‘There was, at first, nothing of the brow-beating or 
dictatorial tone about this good. -humored inquisitor, who en- 
tered into an easy familiarity with his victim, and addressed. 
him’in that spirit of fantastic gibe, which is among the charae- 
teristics of the country. The witness thought himself ona 
level with the counsellor, who invited him to a wrestling- 
match in wit, and, holding it a great victory to trip a lawyer 
up, promptly accepted the challenge. “A hard struggle used 
often to ensue, and many a time I have seen the counsellor get 
a severe fall. However, he contrived to be always uppermost: 
at last. The whole of “the fancy,” who are very numerous in 
Dublin, used to assemble to witness these intellectual gym- ' 
nastics. A kind 6f xing was formed round the combatants, and. 
my Lord Norbury sat as arbiter of the contest, and insisted. 
upon fair play. The peals of laughter which were produced 
by his achievements in pleasantry procured for MacDougall: 
the title of “ MacDougall of the Roar.” 
I shall. not readily forget his Tast display. An action for,

slander was' brought by ah apothecary against a rival pharma- 
copolist-. One of the apprentices of the plaintiff was his lead- 
ing witnéss, and it fell to Mr. MacDougall to cross-examine | 
him.. The wily lawyer induced. the youthful Podalirius to 
make a display of his acquirements in detailing the whole 
process of his art. ‘The farce of the “ Mock Doctor”-has never 
produced more mirth. All the faculty attended, and the crowd 
-ef doctors, surgeons, and man-midwives, reached the roof. 
They were, however, reluctaiitly compelled to join in the 
tumult of laughter created by this formidable jester at their 
expense. The chorus of. apothecaries i in Moliere’s “ Bourgeois 
Gentilhomme,” in which the various mysteries of the profession 
are detailed, does not disclose more matter for merriment than 
was revealed in the course of this ludicrous investigation. 
It is recorded of the “ satirical knave,” that he was assailed 
by the illness of which he died during the personation of a 
character intended as a ridicule upon the faculty. I sat close 
to Mr, MacDougall, and while I participated in all its mirth, 
my attention was attracted by a handkerchief which the 
author of all this merriment was frequently applying to his 
mouth, and which was clotted with blood. I thought, at first, 
_ that it proceeded from some ordinary effusion, and turned 
again toward the witness, when a loud laugh from the counsel 
at the success of a question which he had administered to the 
young apothecary, touching his performance of Romeo in the 
private theatre in Fishamble-street [Dublin], directed .my 
notice a second time to Mr. MacDougall, and I perceived that, 
while the whole auditory. was shaken with mirth, he was taking ‘ 
a favorable opportunity of thrusting the bloody handkerchief 
into his bag, without attracting the general attention, and 
immediately after applied another to his lips. Again he set 
upon the Romeo of Fishamble street, and produced new bursts 
of ridicule, of which he took advantage to steal his bloody 
napkins away, and to supply himself, without notice, with the 
means of concealing the malady which was hurrying him to 
the grave. 
A day or two after this trial his illness and his rnin were 
amnouneed. His high reputation in’ his profession, his private

worth, his large family, and the opinion which had been enter 
tained of his great professional prosperity, fixed the public 
attention upon him. It was at last discovered that all the 
earnings of a laborious life had been laid out in speculations 
upon lands belonging to the corporation of Waterford, to the 
representation of which, it is supposed, he aspired. He-bad 
borrowed large sums of money, and had subjected himself-to 
enormous rents. He-was induced, in the hope of ultimately 
retrieving his circumstances, to involve himself more deeply in 
debt; and the rank of King’s counsel, to which he was raised 
by Mr. Plunket, in a manner equally honorable‘ to both, offered 
a new career to his talents, and led him to expect that all-his 
difficulties might be at last surmounted. But the hope was'a 
vain one. ‘The pressure was too great for-him to bear, and. ‘he 
“gunk at last beneath it. 
For a long time he struggled hard to conceal the state-of his 
circumstances and of his mind, and assumed a forced hilarity 
of manners. He was conspicuous for an obstreperous gayety” 
at the bar-mess on his circuit, and no man laughed so loudly 
or so Jong as he did; but when his apparently exuberant 
spirits Were spoken of, those who imew him well shook-their 
heads, and hinted that all was not right within, And soit 
proved to be. His mind had for years been corroded with 
anxieties. His constitution, although naturally vigorous; was 
slowly shaken by the sapping of continual care. A mortal 
disease at length declared itself, in the increasing gush of blood 
from the gums, which he had employed the expedients that I 
have mentioned to conceal. Yet even in the hours of advan- 
cing dissolution, he could not be induced to absent himself 
from court; and the scene which I have been describing ‘was 
one of those in which, if I may so say, Momus and Death were 
brought into fellowship. He died a short time after the trial 
in which I had noted this painful incident. ~ . 
To the last, his love of Indicrous association did not desert 
him. A little while before his departure, one of -his oldest 
friends was standing at his bed-side and bidding him farewell. 
During this melancholy parting, a collapse of the jaws took 
place, which rendered it necessary to tie a bandage under the

ehin.; and: inthe: performance of the operation, with the blood 
‘still. oozing from his mouth, and trickling down the sheets, he 
turned his.eyes. languidly to his friends, and muttered, with a 
faint smile, “I never thought to have.died chapfallen.” . This 
observation was not the result of insensibility; quite the re- 
-verse. . “You should have seen him when he spoke it,” said 
‘the gentleman who mentioned the circumstance; “I felt like 
the companion of Yorick’s death-bed, who perceived, by a jest, 
~ that the heart of his friend was broken.” It is consolatory to 
know, that since bis death his property has been turned to 
_ good account, and that his family are placed in independence. 
- Never to attain to station at the Bar; to carry the conscious- 
ness of high talent; to think that there is a portable treasure 
in one’s mind, which the attorneys do not condescend to ex- 
plore; to live for years in hope, and to feel the proverbial 
sickness of the heart arising from its procrastination—these 
are. serious ills, But the loss of. business, at an advanced 
period of life, is a far greater calamity than never to have 
attained its possession. Yet a distinction is to be taken. 
Those who have been deserted by their business are divisible 
into two classes, who are esséntially different: the prudent, 
who, with the forecast which is so rare.a virtue in Ireland, 
have taken advantage of the shining-of their fortunes, and, by 
a sagacious accumulation, are enabled to encounter the caprices 
of public favor; and they who, after a life of profuseness, find 
themselves at last abandoned by their clients, without having 
preserved the means of respectable support. 
The former class suggest'a ludicrous, rather than a melan- 
choly train of images. The contemplation of a rich man out 
of employment affords more matter for merriment than for con- 
dolence, To this body of opulent veterans my friend Pomposo 
belongs. . His success at the Bar was eminent. He possessed, 
in a high degree, a facility of fluent and sonorous speech, and 
had an imposing and well-rounded elocution, a deep and musi- 
cal. voice, a fine and commanding figure, and a solemn and 
didactic. countenance. He flourished at a period when a 
knowledge of the minute technicalities of the law was not 
_ essential at the Irish Bar. There was a time.when an Irish.

- counsellor was winged to heaven by. a- bill of exchange, and 
drew tears from the jury in an ejectment for non-payment of. 
rent. In those days Pomposo | was in the highest repute; and 
such was the demand for him, that the attorneys upon opposite: 
sides galloped from the assize towns to meet him, and some-~ 
times arriving at the same moment at the open windows of his 
carriage, thrust in their brief, and with a shower of bank-notes, 
and simultaneously exclaimed that the counsellor-belonged to 
them. Upon these occasions Pomposo used to throw himself 
back in his post-chaise with an air of imperious non-chalancé,” 
' and, pocketing the money of both parties, protest that it was 
among the calamities of genius to be stopped in the king’s: 
highway, and, drawing up the windows of his carriage, cow © 
manded the postillion to drive on. This half-yearly triumph’ 
of eloquence through the Munster circuit lasted for a consider- 
able time, and Pomposo found himself a rich man. ‘When; . 
after the enactment of the Union, English habits began ‘te’ 
appear, and the iron age of demurrers and of nonsuits sue- 
ceeded to the glorious days of apostrophes and harangues, it - 
was all over with Pomposo. Still he loved the Four Courts, 
and haunted them. 
Becoming at last weary of walking the Hall, he took refuge 
in the Library attached to the Courts. It was pleasant to~ 
hear him ask, with. an air of earnestness, for the oldest and 
most unintelligible repertories of black letter, in which he 
‘affected to seek a pastime. Bracton seemed to be his manual, 
and Fleta his vade-mecum. | I have heard his deep and solemn 
voice, which still retained its old rhetorical tones, breaking in 
upon the laborious’ meditations of the young gentlemen who 
had recently returned from Butler’s or Sugden’s* offices, brist- 
ling with. cases and with points, and who just raised up their 
heads and invested their features with a Lincoln’s-Inn expres- _ 
sion at any intrusion of. a lawyer of the ald school into this

taste for music; he beguiles the time with humming some of 
those airs for which he was famous in his youth, and goes 
through the best portion of the “Beggar’s Opera,” when six 
o’clock strikes. “I protest it is six o’clock, and the junior is 
not yet come—‘ When the heart of a man,’ &c.;” and so 
Pomposo continues until seven o’clock, alternately inveighing

There was a set of men at.the Irish Bar who, I think, may be 
designated as the “ Yelverton school of lawyers.” Lord Avon- 
more, the Chief Baron of the Exchequer, whose name was 
Barry Yelverton, originally belonged to that grade in society 
which is within the reach of education, but below that of re- 
finement. He never lost the indigenons roughness and asper- 
ity of character, which it has been said to be the office of

literature to soften and subdue;. but he.had a noble intellect, 
and in the deep rush of his eloquence the ‘imperfections, of his 
manner were forgotten. . : Sn gs 
_ His familiarity with the models of antiquity was great, and 
his mind had imbibed much of the spirit of the orators .of 
Greece and Rome, which he infused into his own powerful. dis- 
courses, So great was his solicitude to imbue himself ‘with the, 
style of the eminent writers whom he admired, that. he trans- 
lated: several of their works, without a view to publication. ... 
His talents raised him to the highest place at the Bar, aud 
his political complaisance lifted him to the Bench. In private 
life he possessed ‘many excellent qualities, ofwhich the most 
conspicuous was his-fidelity in friendship. In his ascent he 
raised up the companions of his youth along with him... The 
business of the Court of Exchequer was, under his auspices, 
divided among a set of choice spicits who had been the. hoon 
companions of his youth, and belonged, as well as himself, to 
a jovial fraternity, who designated themselves by the very 
characteristic title of “Monks of the Screw.”* “ 
* Curran, who like all wits, was an eminently social man, collected around. 
hin, while struggling at the bar, an assemblage of choice spirits, chiefly-of his ” 
own profession. Among the members were Henry Flood, Grattan, Father 
O'Leary, Lord Charlemont, Judge Day and others who were destined to wear ~ 
tho ermine, Bowes Daly, Jerry Keller, Lord Avonmore, and others. They 
formed a jovial society, meeting during term on every Saturday night (the law- © 
yer’s holyday), under the presidency of Curran, who was Grand Prior of the 
Order, and wrote the charter song, of which only the following stanzas have 
come down to us:— : : . 
“When St. Patrick our Order created, ‘ 
‘And called us the Monks of the Screw, :

. Thése-merry gentlemenencountered a nonsuit with.a joke, 
and baffled authority with a repartee. A system of avowed 
and convivial favoritism prevailed in the court; and the 
« facundi calices,” which had been quaffed with his lordship, 
were not unnaturally presumed to administer to the inspiration 
of Counsel on’ the succeeding day. The matins performed in 
cotirt ‘were but’‘a ‘prolongation of the vespers which had been 
celebrated at the abbot’s house; and as long as the head of 
. the order continued on the Bench, the “Monks of the Screw” 
were in vogue; but when the Chief Baron died, their bags 
were immediately assailed with atrophy. - They lost their busi- 
ness, and many of them died in extreme indigence. It may 
be readily imagined that their habits were inconsistent with 
the spirit of saving. They w were first pitied, then forgotten, 
and soon after buried. . 
Most of these gentlemen flourished and withered before my 
time. One of them, however, I do remember, who survived 
his companions, and whose natural vitality of spizit, and Dio- 
genes turn of philosophy, sustained his energy to the last. 
This was Mr. Jeremiah Keller, who was universally known — 
by the more familiar appellation of Jerry Keller in the Courts.*

Some five or six years ago, I met an aged clergyman in London, whom 1 rec-

played at whist, by whom played, and in what order; he had voted; in ‘1780, 
being then twenty-two years old, at the election for Bristol, when one of the 
candidates, following Burke, whe had made a long speech, briefly and effectively 
exclaimed, ‘I say ditto to Mr. Burke ;” and he had been one of the “‘ Monks of 
“the Screw.” The club, for it was such, was established (he said) when Curran, 
a poor man, could not afford the expense of entertaining his boon-companions, 
It originally was’a sort of pic nic, each man sending in what he pleased, to make 
up the feast, the supply being usually so abundant as to supply Curran’s 
domestic wants for the ensuing week. Eventually, the monks had roome of 
their own.-—M. ° . 
* Jerry Keller, as he was always called, was an Irish barrister of immerise 
talent, whose life was a failure. He used no mean arts (and such were com- 
mou. in his day) to obtain briefs. He neither flattered seniors nor entertained 
_ attorneys, nor flirted with their wives, nor coquetted with their daughters. Ho

The attorneys could deprive him of his briefs, but could not: 
rob him of his wit. He was aman . : 
  “replete with mocks, 
Fall of comparisons and wounding flouts.””- 
The loss of business served to whet his satire and give.more 
poignancy to his biting mirth. He used to attend the Hall 
of the Courts with punctuality, ‘and was generally surrounded. 
by a circle of laughers, whom the love of malicious pleasantry. 
attracted about him. His figure and demeanor were remark-- 
able. He never put on his wig and gown, as he scorned. the 
affectation of employment, but appeared in an old frieze great= 
coat of rusty red, which reached to his heels, and enveloped , 
the whole of his gaunt and meagre person. A small-.and 
pointed hat stood upon his head, with a narrow and short- 
curled brim. His arms were generally thrust into the sleeves 
of-his coat, which gave him a peculiarity of attitude. 
Looking at him from a distance, you would have taken him : 
for some malevolent litigant fromm the country, upon whose 
passions a group of mockers were endeavoring to —play.; but, 
upon a more attentive perusal of his countenance, you per- 
eeived a habit of thought, of a superior order, and the expres- 
did not succeed at the bar, as a man so gifted should have succeeded. At last , 
he limited his ambition to shining at the social board, and theré few eclipsed 
him. A dull rival, named Mayne, was made a judge; “ There,” he was heard 
to mutter, like the under-growl of a tempest, “ Mayne sits, risen by his grav- 
ity, and Keller sunk by his levity: what would Newton say to that !” == He was 
witty. He dined, in 1780, at the house of one Garrett Moore, grocer and whis- 
key-vender, in Aungier strect, Dublin, When the mirth grew “ fost and fari- 
ous,” an intimation was made that the lady of the house had just been cenfined. 
“Let us adjourn,” said his friend. “ Certainly,” replied Jerry, “ pro ve nata:”” 
The young stranger, was Thomas Moore, the poet.— An attorney, with a pecu- 
Har malformation of hands, explaining an act of parliament, sprawled his de~

Jerry answered, “ you are right, for once—they’re more like claws than hands.” 
When, in 1800, Barry Yelverton was raised from the rank of -Baron, to that of *

sion of:no-erdinary mind. His features were sharp, and 
pointed to the finest edge. ‘Fhere was that acuteness of the 
nose which denotes the lover of a gibe. His eyes were pier- 
cing, clear, and brassy ; they were filled with a deadly irony, 
which never left them. <A flash of malignant exultation play- 
ed over his features. when he saw. how deeply the shaft had 
struck, and with'what a tenacity it stuck to his victim. The 
quiver of his lip, in giving utterance to some mortal sneer, was 
peculiarly -comical: he seemed as if he were chewing the 
poison before he spat it forth. His teeth gave a short chatter 
of ridicule ;-you heard a dry laugh, a cachinnus which wrinkled 
all his features, and after a sardonic chuckle, he darted forth 
‘the fatal jest, amidst those plaudits for its bitterness which had 
become his only consolation. 
Jerry Keller, as the senior, presided at the mess of the Mun- ~ 
ster bar, and ruled in all the autocracy of unrivalled wit. It 
was agreed upon all hands that Jerry should have a carte- 
blanche with every man’s character, and that none of his sar- 
casms, however formidable, should provoke resentment. This 
was a necessary stipulation; for when he had been roused by. 
those potations, in which, according to a custom which he did 
not. consider as “honored by the breach,” he liberally in- 
dulged, there was a Malagrowther savageness in: his sarcasm 
which made even the most: callous shrink. He who laughed 
loudest at the thrust which his neighbor had received, was the 
next to feel the weapons of this immitigable satirist. To enter 
- into’a struggle with him, was.a tempting of God’s providence. 
You were sure to be pierced in an instant by this accomplished 
gladiator, who could never be taken off his guard. Jerry had 
been a Catholic, and still retained a lurking reverence for a 
herring upon Good Friday. A gentleman of no ordinary pre- 
tension,* observing that Jerry abstained from meat on; that 
sacred day, ventured to observe, “I think, Jerry, you have 
still 2 damned deal of the Pope in your belly.” —“ If I have,” 
said Jerry, “you have a damned deal of the Pretender in your 
head.” .

I was one day (let not the reader allow himself t to be startled: . 
-by too sudden a transition from Dublin to Constantinople)—~F : 
was, I recollect, one day, repeating this sarcasm to a gentle- 
man who had recently returned from the East, and mentioned 
the name of the barrister, Mr. N- , to whom it. had been 
applied; and I was a good deal surprised, that, instead’ of 
joining in a laugh at the bitterness of the retort, his face: as- 
sumed a melancholy expression. .I asked him the cause of-it, 
when he told me, that the name which I had just uttered, had. 
recalled to him a very remarkable and very painful ineident.— 
which had happened to him at Constantinople. “I-begged shim 
to relate it. “I was one evening,” he said, “ walking inthe 
cemeteries of Constantinople. But I have,-I believe, written 
an account of this adventure in my journal, and had better. 
read it to you.” 
He accordingly took a huge book from a drawer, and. read 
as follows: —“It is not unusual for the inhabitants..of the 
Asiatic portion of the great capital of Islamism, to walk in the: 
evening amid the vast repositories of the dead, which -are 
adjacent to Seutari. Death is little dreaded in the East, while 
the ‘remains of the deceased are objects of tenderness and 
respect among their surviving kindred. This pious sentiment 
being unaccompanied by that dismay with which we are apt.to. 
look upon the grave, attracts the Turks to the vast fields where 
their friends and kindred are deposited. : 
“I proceeded upon a summer evening from. Constantinople; 
properly so called, to the Asiatic side, and entered -the: vast= 
groves of cypresses which mark the residence of the dead.- ‘The 
evening was brilliant. There was not a breath of wind’ ta.   
_stir the leaves of those dismal trees, which spread on every 
side as far as the sight can reach, and, being planted in. long’ 
and uniform. lines, open vistas of death, and conduct the eye: 
through long sweeps of sepulchres to the horizon. ‘The dwel-* 
lings of the dead were filled-with the living. ‘Fhe ranges of" _ 
cy-presses were crowded with Turks, who moved with that slow 
and solemn gait which is peculiar-to the country. The flowing:

their tioble détheanor; and ‘their silence and collectedness, by 
the uniow of life dnd déath together, gave an additional solem-* 
nity to this imposing’spectacle. The setting of the sun threw? 
a mournfat splendor upon the foliage of the trees, and lighted 
up this forest of death with a funereal glory. 
*#T-leaned against: a cypress which. grew over a grave on 
which ‘roses had. been planted. From this spot, full of those 
| ‘ flower-beds of graves,’ as Mr. ‘Hope* has called them, and 
which mothers or sisters had in. ali likelihood so adorned (it 
is the usage in the East to apparel a tomb with these domestic 
tokens of. endearment), E looked around me. While I was 
contemplating ‘this patrimony of the heirs to decay,’ my 
attention was attracted by aman dressed in tattered white, and. 
with a ragged turban on his head, who ‘stood ata small dis- 
tance from me, and, although attired in the dress of the eoun- 
try, had something of the Frank in his aspect. There was- 
an air of extreme loneliness and desolation about him. He 
leaned with his back to a marble sepulchre, which was-raised - 
by the side of the public road that for miles traverses the 
cemeteries. “His arms were folded, his head was sunk on his 
chest, and his eyes fixed upon the earth. The evening was‘ 
far, advanced, and, as it grew dark, the crowds who had pre- 
viously filled the cemeteries began to disperse. 
_ . “As the brightness of the evening passed away, I perceived 
that dense and motionless cloud of stagnant vapors, which had 
disappeared in ‘the setting sun, but which, Mr. Hope tells us, 
for ever hangs over these dreary-realms, and is. exhaled from 
the swelling soil ready to burst with its festering contents. A 
chilly sengation stole upon me, and I felt that I was ‘set down 
in the midst of the valley which was full of bones” I was~ 
about to depart from this dismal spot, when; looking toward the 
sepulchre where I had observed the solitary figure Ihave been 
describing, I perceived that he was approaching... I was at 
first a little startled, and, although my apprebénsions passed 
away when he addressed me in the English language, my 
surprise, when I looked at him, was not alittle increased. He 
‘said, that he conjectured-from my appearance that I was an

of shame, for the means of sustenance, when FE could not avoid . 
exclaiming, ‘Gracious God! can it be?—‘ Alas!” said the 
unfortunate man, covering his face with his hands, | “it is too 
true. Iam Mr. N. , of the Irish bar.’”* 
The gentleman who read this singular incident from ‘his 
journal, was at the time employed in writing a Tour in-the: 
East, and may have tinged his description of the cemeteries 
of Stamboul with some mental colors. But, of the fact of ‘this

* John Wilson Croker, well known as a politician and author, was born in 
1780, educated at Dublin University, and called to the bar in 1802. Accident’ 
threw him into Parliament —for, having been professionally. engaged at Down- 
patrick election, in 1807, he was returned as member for that borough. Thence, 
until the passing of the Reform Bill, in 1832, he continuously held a seat in _ 
Parliament —five years of that period, for the University of Dublin. In 1809, 
when Colonel Wardle brought his charges against the Duke of: York (second 
son of George JII., and Commander-in-Chief of the army), of having permitted 
Mary Ann Clarke, his mistress, to dispose of military and other appointments, 
under his patronage, Croker so ably and zealously defended the Duke, as a vol- 
unteer, that (though his convicted client Had to resign the command of the 
army) the post of Secretary of the Adiniralty was given him, in gratitude for 
the service, and he retained this lucrative office, then.worth nearly three thou- 
sand pounds sterling # year, until 1830, when he retired, on the break-up of the 
Wellington Ministry, on a pension of fifteen hundred pounds a year. Two 
years earlier he had been made a Privy Councillor. When the Grey Adminis- 
tration brought in and carried their Reform Bill, they were met on every detail 
by Croker, who showed a tact, readiness, and even eloquence, joined with 
ready wit and sarcasm, for which few had previously given him credit. To use 
the language in which Mr. Thackeray described the glorious conduct of the 
great Washington, he “ fought with a courage worthy of a better cause !”— 
Here ended Croker’s political life, for he kept his-vow that he would not sit in 
a reformed House of Commons. His earlier literary productions, sarcastic and 
shrewd, wore on local subjects, and had their chief celebrity in Dublin, where 
their allusions were understood and relished. - His first prose work of perma- 
nent interest was called “ Stories from the History of England,” which Scott 
took as the model of his own familiar “Tales of a Grandfather.” He has 
edited the Suffolk Papers, the Letters of Lady Hervey and her husband, and 
Boswell’s Life of Johnson. ~ This last, which was crowded with errors amid a 
great mass of new and. illustrative annotation, drew down a severe critique, in 
the “Edinburgh Review,” from the pen of Macaolay ; a favor which Croker re- 
turned, with interest, én Macaulay’s “History of England.” This critique 
appeared in the “Quarterly Review,” established, in 1809, through the combi- 
nation of Scott, Canning, Croker, and their friends. Croker, who was admit- 
ted to much familiarity with George IV., both as Regent and King, was in’ 
habits of intimacy with the nobility as well as the leading men of letters and 
artists on the Tory side, One of his Jatest criticisms was published in the Quan 
terly Revicw for July, 1853, on Lord John Russell's ‘‘ Life, Journals, and Let- 
ters, of Thomas Moore,” in which the noble editor and the peer-loving “ poet 
of all circles’* were ruthlessly tormented, tomabawked, and scalped. It is an

which he represented himself as in want of the common’means

‘emblem of apostacy and of want. It hung in ‘rags about a 
person which, from arobust magnitude of frame, had shrunk 
into miserable diminution. He carried starvation in his — 
cheeks; ghastliness and misery overspread his features, and 
despair stared in his glazed and sunken eye. He did not long 
survive his calamities. 
The conclusion of his story may be briefly told. For a 
- little while he continued ‘to walk through the streets of Con- 
stantinople in search of nourishment, and haunted its ceme- 
teries like the dogs. to which Christians are compared: He 
had neither food, roof, nor raiment. . At length he ‘took: the 
desperate resolution of relapsing into Christianity; for he 
-indulged in the hope; that, if he could. return to his former 
faith, and effect his escape from Constantinople, although he 
could not appear in these countries again, yet, ow the conti- 
nent, he might obtain at least’ the means of ‘life from the 
friends, who, although they could not forgive his errors, might 
take compassion upon his distress. He accordingly endeav- 
ored to fly from Constantinople; and induced some Englishmen 
who happened to be there, to furnish money enough to effect 
his escape. But the plot was discovered. He was pursued, 
_and taken at a small distance from Oonstantinople; his head 
was: struck off upon the beach of the Bosphorus, and his body

Turrr is something apparently irreconcilable between'the 
ambition and avidity which are almost inseparable from:the 
propensities of -a successful lawyer, and any very genuine-én- 
thusiasm in religion. The intense worldliness of his profession 
must produce upon his character and faculties equally tangi- 
ble. results ; and if it has the effect of.communicating a minuté 
astuteness to the one, it is not very likely to impart a spirit-of 
lofty abstraction to the other. I can not readily eonceive any- 
thing more sublunary than the bar. Its occupations allow ao - 
respite to the mind, and refuse it all leave to indulge inthe 
aspirations which a high tendency to religion not only gener- 
erates, but requires. They will not even. permit any native 
disposition to enthusiasm to branch aloft, but fetter. it tothe 
earth, and constrain it to grow down. How can the mind:-of a 
lawyer, eddying as it is with such fluctuating interests,xeceive 
upon its shifting and troubled surface those noble images which 
can never be reflected except in the sequestered calm of deep 
and unruffled thought? He whose spirit carries on a continued 
commerce with the skies, is not only ill adapted to the ordinary 
business of society, but is scarcely conscious of it. -He ean 
with difficulty perceive what is going on at such a distance 
below him; and if he should ever divert his eyes from the

pear to be utterly preposterous and inane. The reputation which 
Romilly has left behind must sound as idle in his ears as the 
wind that shakes the thistle upon his grave. An: ardent reli- 
gionist must shrink from those offices which. a lawyer would 
designate as the duties, and which are among the necessary 
incidents, of his profession. ‘To play for a little of that worth-

—to make prostitutes of his faculties, and surrender them in

How fallacious is all speculation when unillustrated by ex- 
ample, and how rapidly these misty conjectures disappear, 
before the warm and conspicuous piety of the learned gentle- 
man whose name is prefixed to this number of the “ Sketches 
of the Irish Bar.’ This eminent practitioner, who has rivals 
in capacity, but is without a competitor in religion, refutes all 
this injurious surmise; and in answer to. mere inference and 
theory, the sainted fraternity among whom he plays.so remark-

uniting in his person the good things of the Old Testament, 
with the less earthly benedictions of the New, may triumph- 
antly appeal to the virtues and to the opulence of Mr. Sergeant 
Lrrroy. 
The person who has accomplished this exemplary reconcili- 
ation between characters so opposite in appearance as a de- 
voted follower of the gospel and a wily disputant at the bar, 
stands in great prominence in the Four. Courts, but is still 
more-noted among “the saints” in Dublin, and I think may be

accounted their leader. These are an influential and rapidly= - 
_ increasing body, which is not wholly separated from the éhurch, 
but is appended to it by a very loose and: slender tie. They 
. may be designated as the Jansenists of the establishment ; for 
in their doctrines of grace and of election they border very 
closely upon the professors of the Port-Royal. For men who 
hold in such indifference the pleasures of the world, :they are. 
singularly surrounded with its fugacious enjoyments: “Exieom 
passed with innocuous luxuries and innocent voluptuotsness, 
they felicitously contrast their external wealth with that mor- 
tification of the spirit of which they make so lavish a:profes- 
sion, and of which none but an inveclaimable: skeptic ‘could 
entertain a doubt. 
At the bar they are to be:found in considerable strength, 
and are distinguished among their brethren for their-zeal in 
the advancement of the interests of religion and thein own. 
They are, in general, sedulous and well-informed — competent 
to the discharge of ordinary business, and free of all ambition 
of display —a little uncandid in their practice, and careless of 
the means by which success is to be attained — pursuivants of 
authority and followers of the great—gentlemanlike in their 
demeanor, but not without that touch of arrogance toward ‘their 
inferiors which is an almost uniform attendant upon ati over- 
anxious deference to power—strong adherents to abstract 
principles of propriety, and vehement inculcators of the eternal 
rules of right, but at the same time not prodigally prone to any — 
Samaritan sensibilities—amiable in their homes, and some- 
what selfish out of them—fluent reciters of the Scriptures-—— 
conspicuously decent in-their manners, and entirely regardless 
of the apple-wenches in the Hall. 
The great, prototype of this meritorious fraternity is Mr. Ser- 
@eant Lefroy. It would do good to the heart of the learned 
member for Galway to visit his stables on a Sunday. The 
generous animals who inhabit these exemplary tenements, par- 
ticipate in his relaxations, and falfil with scriptural exactness 
the sacred injunction of repose. Smooth as their benevolent 
master, they stand in their stalls amid all the luxury of grain,

nised.ag the:steeds, of a prosperous and pious man.’ It is one 
of the Sergeant's favorite canons that the lower orders of the 
animal creation should join in the celebration of the seventh 
day,.and contribute the offering of their involuntary homage. 
Loosened himself from the rich wain of his profession, he ex- | 
tends a similar indulgence‘to the gentle quadrupeds, wko are 
zelieved on that. day from the easy obligation of drawing one 
of the handsomest equipages in. Dublin, to which, in all proba- 
pility, the. chariots of the primitive Christians did not bear a 
very exact resemblance. 
If. you should chance on Sunday. to walk near the Asylum 
- (a chapel in Leeson street, which, from the number of sancti- 
monious lawyers who inhabit it, is called “ Swaddling bar”), 
" you will see. the learned Sergeant proceeding to this favored 
‘domicil of worship, near which he resides without any verifi- 
cation of the proverb, with a huge bible bound in red morocco 
under his arm. It is a truly edifying spectacle. A halo of 
piety is diffused about him. Wis cheeks, so far from being * 
worn out by the vigils of his profession, or suffused-with the 
evaporations of the midnight lamp, are bright, shining, and 
vermilioned. There is a gloss of sanctity upon them, which is 
happily contrasted with the care-colored visages of the profane. 
A serious contentedness is observable in his aspect, which in- 
dicates a mind on the best footing with Heaven and with itself. 
.. There is an evangelical neatness in his attire. His neck- 
cloth is closely tied, and knotted with a-simple. precision. His 
suit. of sables, in the formality of its outline, beurs attestation — 
to the stitches of some inspired tailor who alternately cuts out 
a religion and a coat; his hose are of gray silk; his shoes are 
burnished with @ mysterious polish, black as the lustre of. his 
favorite Tertullian. As he passes to the house of worship, he 
attracts the pious notice of the devouter fair who flock-to the 
_windows to behold him; but, heedless of their ‘perilous admi- 
ration, he advances without any indulgence of human vanity, 
and joins the convocation of the elect. There his devotion ex. 
hales itself in enraptured evaporations, which nothing but the 
recognition of some.eminent solicitor in the adjoining pew can 
interrupt. : The service being over, he proceeds to: fill up the

sresidug. of the day with acts of religious merit, and, as- Tare 
beard, with deeds of genuine humanity and worth. r 
With him, I really believe that upon a day which he gets 
apart from worldly occupation, with perhaps too much Puritan 
exactness, “works of mercy are a part of rest.” While I-ven- 
tore to indulge in a little-ridicule of his sabbatarian precision, 
which is not wholly free from that sort of pedantry which is 
observable in religion as well as in learning, I should regret to 
withhold from him the encomium which he really deserves, 
It has been whispered, it is true, that his compassion is, ina 
great degree, instigated by his theological predilections,. and 
that it has as much of sectarianism as of philanthropy. But 
humanity, however modified, is still humanity. If, in leaving 
the chamber of suffering and of sorrow, be marks with a bank- 
note the leaf of the Bible which he has been reading at the 
bedside of some poorer saint, let there be given to his beneyo- 
lence, restricted as it may be by his peculiar propensities. in 
~ belief, a cordial praise. The sphere of charity must neeas be 
limited; and of his own money, it is a clear truism to say, he 
is entitled to dispose as he thinks proper. With respect to:the .. 
public money, the case is different; and upon the distribution 
of a fand of which he and certain other gentlemen of his-pro- 
~ fession are the trustees (so at least they have made themselves), 
there appears less right to exercise a summary discretion. I 
allude to the Kildare-street Association, of which he is one of 
the principal members. ~ 
The street from which this association has derived its, name 
has brought the extremes in morals into a close conjunction. 
The Pharisees of Dublin have posted themselves in a most 
Sadducean vicinage, for their meetings are held beside the 
most fashionnble gaming- -club* in Ireland. Loud indeed and 
long are the oratorical ejaculations.which issue from the as-. 
semblies held under the peculiar auspices of the illuminated 
associates of the long robe. Here they hold out a usefal exam- 
ple of prudence as well as of zeal, and indulge their generous 
propensities at little cost. 
They receive, by parliamentary grant, an annual sum of six

are added: through a private subscription among the elect. In 
the allocation of this fund, they have established rules which - 
are entirely at variance with the ends for which the grant has. 
been madé by Parliament. They réquire that the Bible should 
be read in every school to which assistance is given. With 
this condition-the Roman Catholic clergy (and the chief among 
the Protestant hierarchy concur in their opposition) have re- 
fused tocomply. The indiscriminate perusal of the Scriptures, 
unaccompanied by any comment illustrative of the peculiar 
sense in-which they are explained by the Roman Catholic 
church, seems to be inconsistent with the principles in which 
that chureh is founded. .Thé divines of Kildare street have; 
however, undertaken the difficult task of demonstrating to this - 
obstinate and refractory priesthood that they understood the 
tenets and.spirit of their religion much better than any doctor 
at Maynooth.f A consequent acrimony has arisen between 
the parties, and the result has been that the few channels of 
education which exist in the country are denied all supply 
from a source which has been thus arbitrarily shut up. 
“It is lamentable that, in the enforcement of these fanatical 
enactments, so much petty vindictiveness and theological acer- 
bity should be displayed. The assembliés held at Kildare 
street, with the ostensible view of advancing the ‘progress of 
intelligence among the lower classes, exhibit many of the qual- - 
ities of sectarian virulence in their most ludicrous shape. A.

speculation. 0” Connell, too, who “like a French falcon ‘# 8 
at everything he sees,” comes panting from the Four Courts, 
and gives them a speech straight. The effects produced upon 
the auditory, which is compounded of very different materials 
from the meetings which the counsellor is in the habit of, ad- 
dressing with so much success, are not a little singular. : 
Of the ingredients of this assembly it may not be amiss to 
say a few words. Aware of his purpose, the Saints employ 
themselves for some days before in congregating all those ho 
hold his politics and his creed in their most special abhorrence, 
They accordingly collect a very motley convocation. In the 
background are posted a strong phalanx of the ragged-and 
ferocious votaries of Mr. Cooper.* ‘These persons belong to 
the lower classes of Protestants, of whose religion it would not 
be easy to give any more definite description than that they 
regard the Plunket-street orator as on a very close footing with 
the Divinity, and entertain shrewd doubts whether he be not 
the prophet Enoch himself. Adjoining to this detachment, 
which is posted as a kind of corps de réserve, whose aid is to be 
resorted to upon a. case of special emergency, the Evangelicals 
of York street are drawn up. Next come a chosen band of 
Quakers and Quakeresses; and lastly are arrayed the Saints, 
more properly so called, with the learned Sergeant and divers 
oily-tongued barristers at their head. The latter “are judi- 
ciously dispersed among the pretty enthusiasts who occupy the 
front benches, and whisper a compliment in the ear of. some 
sofl-eyed votary, who bears the seal of grace upon her smooth 
and ivory brow. 
It may not be inappropriate to observe, that among the 
softer sex the Saints have made very considerable-way. The 
cold worship of the establishment is readily abandoned for the 
more impassioned adoration which corrects the tameness and 
frigidity of the constituted creed. The latter is, indeed, a kind 
of Catholicism cut down; it is popery without enthusiasm; 
and to remedy its want-of stimulus, an exciting system has | 
been devised, the practices and tenets of which are endowed

with a peculiar, pungency. The Kildare street meetings are. 
attended” iby, some of the prettiest women in Dublin; and. I 
should say, in justice to these tender devotees, that they ap- 
pear there with a peculiar interest. There is a studied mod- 
esty in their attire that only excites the imaginations which it 
purposes, to repress. 
_ In this scene, thus strangely compounded, it is pleasant to 
see the Popish agitator engaged in a wrestle with the passions 
and antipathies of his hearers. ‘The moment he rises, an ob- 
scure murmur, or rather growl, is heard in the more distant 
parts of the room. This discourteous sound proceeds from the- 
Cooperites, who find it difficult to restrain themselves from any 
stronger expression of abhorrence toward: this poisoned scion 
of St. Omer’s.* The politer portion of the audience interfere, 
and the learned Sergeant entreats that he may be heard. ~ 
O’Connell ‘proceeds, and . professes as strong and unaffected 
a veneration for the Holy. Writings as any of them can enter- 
tain; but at the same time begs to insinuate, that the Bible is 
not only the repository of Divine truths, but the record of 
human depravity, and that, as a narrative, it comprehends 
examples of atrocity, with the detail of which it is, perhaps, 
injudicious that youth and innocence should become familiar. 
Are crimes which rebel against nature, the fit theme of domes- 
tie contemplation? and are not facts set forth in the Old 
Testament, from the very knowledge of which every father 
should desire to secure his child? If he were desperate enough 
to open the Holy Writings in that very assembly, and to read 
aloud the examples of guilt which they commemorate, the face 
of every woman would turn to scarlet, and the hand of every 
man would be lifted up in wrath: and are the pages which 
reveal the darkest depths of depravity fitted for the specula- 
tions of boyhood and the virgin’s meditations? Will not the 
question be asked, What does all this mean? and is it right 
that-sucl a question should he put, to which such an answer 
may.be given? The field of conjecture ought not to be opened

to: thase whose innocence and whose ignorance are so elogely

although it grow beside that of life, its fruits are full of bitter-

Mr. O’Connell then insists that the Scriptures ought. not te 
be forced into circulation, and that a bounty should not be put | 
upon their dispersion among the shoeless, hoseless, shirtless, 
and houseless peasantry of Ireland: Give them work and-food 
instead of theology. Are they capable of comprehending the 
dark and mysterious intimations of St. Paul, or St. John’s 
Revelation? Would not the Apocalypse bother the learned 
Sergeant himself? and have not his poor countrymen enough 
to endure, and. are they not‘ sufficiently disposed to quarrel, 
without the additional incentive of polemics? Is it in a ditch © 
school that his learned friond conceives that the mysteries of 
the Trinity, of the Incarnation, and not more embarrassing 
Sacrament, are to be discussed? | 
Kindling as he advances, the great demagogue throws him- 
self into other topics, and charges his pious friends -with a 
violation of their duty to the public, in the arbitrary imposition 
of conditions against which ev ery Roman Catholic exclaims. 
He disputes their right to exercise a compulsion founded: on 
their own fantasies in the execution of a solemn trust, and at 
last roundly insinuates that proselytism must be their object. - 
At this a mighty uproar ensues. he holy-rabble in. the

~mind, and communicate their effervescence. His phrase is 
struck with the stamp of passion. His eye becomes ennobled 
with better thought; he shuffles off for a moment the coil of 
his forensic habitudes. The universal diffusion of Christian 
truth fills him with enthusiasm. He beholds the downfall of

of Chancery. Here an utter transformation takes place in the 
person of the learned Sergeant, which almost brings his iden- 
tity into doubt. Instead of eyes alternately veiled in the 
humility of their long and downeast lashes, or lifted up in 
visionary devotion, you behold them fixed upon the Chan- 
eellor, and watching with a subtle intensity all the shiftings 
of expression with which the judicial countenance intimates 
its approval or dissent. The whole face of the vigilant and 
wily pleader is overspread with craft. There is a lurking of 
design in every feature of his sharp and elongated visage. 
You will not perceive any nice play of the muscles, or shad- 
owings of sentiment in his. physiognomy; it is fixed, hard, 
and imperturbable. His deportment is in keeping with his 
countenance. ' He scarcely ever stands perfectly erect, and 
there is nothing upright or open in his bearing. His shoulders 
are contracted, and drawn in; and the body is bent, while the 
neck is protruded. No rapidity of gesfure, or suddenness of 
"movement, indicates the unanticipated startings-up of thought. 
The arm is never braced in the strenuous confidence of vigor- 
ous enforcement, with which Plunket hurls the truth-at the 
‘Bench ; but the long and taper fingers just tip the green table 
on which they are laid with a peculiar lightness. In this atti- 
tude, in which he looks a sophism personified, he applies: his 
talents and erudition to the sustainment of the most question- 
able case, with as much alacrity as if weeping Innocence and 
virtuous Misfortune clung to him for support. . 
The doubtful merits of his client seem to give a new stim- 
ulus to. his abilities; and if some obsolete form can be raised 
from oblivion, if some preposterous precedent can be found in 
the. mass of antiquated decisions under which all reason and 
justice are entombed ; or if some petty flaw can be found in 
the pleadings of his adversary, which is sure to be detected 
by his minute and microscopic eye, wo to the widow and the 
orphan! ‘The Chancellor [Manners] is called upon to decide 
in conformity with some old monastic doctrine. The pious 
Sergeant presses him upon every side, He surrounds him 
with a horde of barbarous authorities; and giving no quarter

the malicious, ‘plea in trophy upon their ruins. Every expe- 
dient is-called into aid: facts are perverted, precedents -are 
tortured, positions unheard béfore are laid down as sacred 
canons; and, in order to effect the utter wreck of the opposite 
party, deceitful lights are held up as the great beacons of 
Jegal, truth. In short, one who had previously seen the 
learned Sergeant for the first time in a Bible Society, would 
hardly believe him to be the same, but would almost be in- 
elined to suspect that it-was the genius of Chicane, which had 
invested itself with an:angelic aspect, and, for the. purpose of 
‘ more effectually accomplishing its pernicious ends, had. as- 
sumed the celestial guise of Mr. Sergeant Lefroy. . 
Let me not be considered as casting an imputation upon this 
able, and, I believe, amiable man. In the exhibition of -so 
‘much professional dexterity and zeal, he does no more than 
what every advocate will regard as his duty. I am only 
indulging in some surprise’ at the promptness and facility of 
his transition from the religious. to the forensic. mood ; and at 
the success with which he divests himself of that moral squeam- 
ishness, which one would suppose to be incidental to his: intel- 
lectual habits. Looking at him as an advocate, he deserves 
great encomium. In industry he is not surpassed by any mem- 
ber of his profession. 
It was his good fortune that, soon after he had been called 
to the bar, Lord Redesdale should have been Lord Chancellor.* 
-* Lord Redesdale, born in August; 1748, was an excellent Chancellor—~c]ear 
minded, straight-forward, learned, and patient. His name was John Freeman 
Mitford, and he was English py birth. He was educated at Oxford, studied 
the law, and became an eminent chancery pleader, after he was -called to the 
bar. He wrote a book on Chancery Pleadings, which went through several 
editions. In 1790, he was made a Welsh judge (an office now abolished) and 
was knighted ih 1798, when he was- appointed Soljcitor-General.. He had to 
appear against Mr. Hardy, tried on a‘charge of high treason, and his opening 
speech was distinguished by moderation, good taste, and acuteness. In 1799. 
he succeeded Scott (Lord’ Eldon) as Attorney-General. He had been in Par- 
liament since 1785, and, in 1801, was elected Speaker, the first and highest of- 
_ fice a Commoner can hold in England. In 1802, on being appointed Lord 
Chatvellor of Treland, he was raised to the peerage, as Lord Redesdale. When 
‘Grénville‘ond Fox formed their'Coslition Ministry, in 1806, he was compelled.te-

That great lawyer introduced a reformation’in Ivish practice, 
He substituted great learning, unwearied diligence, and.a 
spirit of scientific discussion, for the flippant apothegms and 
irritable self-sufficiency of the late Lord Clare. He enter- 
tained an honorable passion for the study, as well as for the 
profits of his profession; and, not satisfied with pronouncing 
judgments which adjusted the rights of the immediate parties, 
he disclosed the foundations of his decisions, and, opening the 
deep ground-work of equity, revealed the principles upon which 
the whole edifice is established. 
The value of these essays delivered from the Bench was 
' well appreciated by Mr. Lefroy, who, in conjunction with Mr. 
Schoales, engaged in the reports which bear their names, and 
which are justly held-in so much esteem. Soon after their 
-publication, Mr. Lefroy rose into ‘business, for which he was in 
every way qualified. He was much favored by Lord Redes-: 
dale, and now enjoys the warm friendship of Lord Manners 
[1823], for whom he acts as confidential counsel.* His great 
familiarity with cases, and a spirit of peculiar deference to his 
Lordship, combined with eminent capacity, have secured for 
him a large portion of the judicial partialities. He is in 
the fullest practice, and, taking. his private and professional 
income into account, may be well regarded as the wealthiest 
resign, for, on taking Icave of the bar, he snid that “ he had hoped to have ended 
his days in Ireland, but was not permitted. His consent to depart from Eng- 
land was yielded at the wish of some who now concurred in his removal: this 
he owned, he did not expect.” On his return to England, he strongly opposed 
the ministry, particularly on Lord Grenville’s motion for Catholic Emanéipa- 
tion. His fature political course was anti-liberal. In Committees of Appeal, 
in, the Lords, his opinion had great weight. He originated the humane meag 
ure for the relief of insolvent debtors. His death took place, on the 16th Jan 
uary, 1830. His only son, the present Lord Redesdale, is Chairman of Com- 
mittees in the House of Lords, with a salary of four thousand pounds. sterling 
a year, and also Deputy-Speaker of that house. His previous qualifications 
appear to have been—that he kept a pack of hounds !—M.

Such was the situation of the county of Limerick, when the 
learned Sergeant arrived to administer a remedy for, these 
frightful evils. ‘The calendar presented almost all the ‘possi- 
ple varieties which guilt could assume, and might be desig- 
nated as a hideous miscellany of crime. The court-house 
exhibited an appalling spectacle. A deep and awful silence 
hung heavily upon it, and the consciousness that lay upon 
every man’s heart, of the frightful crisis to which the county 
seemed rapidly advancing, bound up the very breath-of the 
assembly in a fearful hush. The wretched men in the dock 
stood before the judicial novice in @ heedless certainty of their 
fate. A desperate independence of their destiny seemed to 
dilate their broad and expanded chests, and their powerful 
faces gave a gloomy token of their sullen indifference to death. 
Their confederates in guilt stood around them with mach 
stronger intimations of anxiety in their looks, and, as they 
eyed their fellow-conspirators in.the dock, seemed to mutter a 
-vow of vengeance for every hair that should be touched upon 
their heads. The gentry of ‘the county stood in the galleries 
with a kind of confession in their aspect, that they had them- 
selves been participant in the production of the crimes which 
they’ were collected to punish, but which they knew that they 
could not repress. . 
In this assembly, so silent that the unsheathing of a stiletto 
might have been heard amidst its hush, the learned Sergeant 
rose, and called for the piece of parchment in which an indict- 
ment had been written. It was duly presented to him by the 
clerk of the crown. Lifting up the legal scroll, he paused for 
a moment, and said : “ Behold! in this parchment writing, the 
causes of all the misery with which the Lord has afflicted this - 
unhappy island are expressed. Here is the whole mystery 
of. guilt manifestly revealed. ~All, all is intimated in the in- 
dictment. Unhappy men, you have not the fear of God be- 
fore your eyes, and you are moved by the instigations of the 
Devil.” This address went beyond all expectation — the 
wretches in the dock gazed upon their sacred monitor with a 
scowling stare—the Bar tipped each other the wink—the 
. parsong thought that this was a palpable interference with my

Tur French Revolution had seareely burst upon the o world 
and its portentous incidents were still the daily subject of 
universal astonishment or dismay, when there arose in the 
metropolis of Ireland a young gentleman, who, feeling jealous 
of the unrivalled importance which the Continental phenome- 
non was enjoying, resolved to start in his own person as an op- 
position-wonder. Hé had some of the qualifications and all thé 
ambitious self-dependence befitting so arduous a project. Na- 
ture and fortune had been extremely kind to him. He was 
of a respectable and wealthy family. His face was handsome; 
his person small, but symmetrical and elastic, and peculiarly” 
adapted to the performance of certain bodily feats which he 
subsequently achieved. 
As to his general endowments, he was, upon his own show- 
ing, a fac-simile of the admirable Crichton. He announced: 
himself as an adept in every known department of human* 
learning, from the prophetic revelations of judicial astrology, 
and the more obsolete mysteries of magic lore, up to the light-" 
est productions of the amatory muse of France. He professed 
to speak every language (except the Irish) as fluently and’ 
correctly as if he had been a native born, He played, sung, 
danced, fenced, and rode, with more skill and spirit than the . 
masters of those respective arts who had presumed to teach 
lim. He had a deep sense of the value of so many combined 
perfections, and acted under the persuasion that he was called. 
upon to amaze the world. ne,

hensible aspirations there lurked the elements of a cléver man, *

recommended. the Bar as a profession in which, with indus- 
try, and his £10,000, for he inherited about as much, and a 
rising religion, for he was a Protestant, he might fairly hope- 
to gratify their ambition, if not- his own. He assented; and 
submitted to pass through the preliminary forms—rather, 
however, under the idea, that at some future period it might . 
suit his views to accept the chancellorship of Ireland, than 
with any immediate intention of squandering his youthful en- 
-ergies upon so inglorious-a vocation. He felt that he was des- 
tined for higher things, and proceeded: to assert bis claims. 
He never appeared abroad but in a costly suit of the most per- 
suasive cut, and. glowing with bright and various tints. He 
set up an imposing phaeton, in which with Kitty Cut-a-dash, 
of fascinating memory, apd then the reigning illegitimate belle 
of Dublin, by his side, he scoured through streets and squares 
with the brilliancy and rapidity of an optical illusion.” He en- 
tertained his friends, the choicest spirits about town, with din- 
ners, such as bachelor never gave before—dishes so satisfy- 
ing and scientific, as to fill not only the stomach, but the mind 
—claret, such as few even of the Irish bishops could procure; 
and champaigne of vivacity exampled only by his own. He 
farnished-his stable with a stud of racers; and, if I am rightly 
informed, he still, balf-laughing, half-wondering at his former 
self, recalls the times when-mounted upon a favorite thorough- 
bred, and flaming in a pink-satin jockey-dress, he distanced 
évery competitor, and bore away the Curragh cup.*

costume of a Savoy peasant, and throw off a pas seud in a style 
of original dextérity and grace, which, to use an Irish deserip-

ecstatic ebullitions of admiration from the ladies.” He was

standing abreast. He was paramount at foot-ball; and.aston- 
ished and won wagers from the Bishop of Derry himself (the 
- noted Lord Bristol),* who was supposed to be the keenest judge 
in Ireland of what the toe of man could achieve. ~ 
Before assuming the forensic robe, our aspirant for renown 
set out upon a Continental tour; and according to his subse> 
quent report, although he travelled in strict incognito, gathered 
fresh glory at every post-town through which he was ‘whirled. 
along. After a considerable stay at Paris, where, however, 
he arrived too late to stop the revolutionary torrent, -he 
passed on and visited several of the German courts—gave 
“travelling opinions” upon the course of policy to be respec- 
tively pursued by them at that critical juncture, and .after- 
ward satisfied himself that the most important events that 
followed were mainly influenced by his timely interposition. 
He left Germany with some precipitation. The rumor ran 
that there were state-reasons for his departure. The subject 
was too delicate to be revealed in all its circumstances, but 
upon his return to Ireland his friends heard in broken senten-. 
ces of a certain Palatine princess—the dogged jealousy of 
* The Barl of Bristol, who was also Bishop of Derry (the income of which’ 
was twenty thousand pounds sterling 2 year, at that time), was a very strange 
character. He was born in 1730, and died in 1803—having ‘spent the last . 
years of his life in Italy, quite unmindful of his episcopal duties to his diocese 
—but sacredly receiving its immense revenue. He bitterly opposed the 
Union, and went down to the House of Lords, in a coach drawn by eight 
horses, to vote against it. He was son of the Lord Hervey (Keeper of the 
Privy Seal, in 1740), to whom, thinking highly of his intellect and learning, 
Bishop Middleton dedicated his “‘ History of the Life of Cicero,” while on the 
other hand, he comes down to us, as the Sporus of Pope’s severe Satire, in 
which his character is thus limned:— 
“Eternal smiles his emptiness betray, 
As shallow streams run dimpling all the way; 
Whether.in florid impotence he speaks,. 
And, as the Prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks. 
Eve’s tempter, thus the Rabbins have exprest — 
A cherub’s face, a reptile all the rest,

the Aulic council, respecting the confusion that might here- 
after ensue, should it come to be suspected that the stream of 
reputed: legitimacy had been reinforced by a tributary rill of 
Munster blood. 
Upon his reappearance in Ireland, our prodigy, exulting in 
the fame of his‘Continental. exploits, ‘was about-to commence 
a new course of wonders in his native land, when an unfore- 
seen occurrence in the form a dishonored check upon his 
banker came to. 
  
«repress his noble rage 
And freeze the genial current of his soul.” 
He discovered that he was a ruined man. The patrimonial 
ten thousand pounds which had giyen an eclat to all he did, 
had vanished. The road to glory still lay before him, but he 
was without a guinea in his pocket to pay the travelling ex- 
penses, 
In this emergency there were three courses open to him — 
to cut his throat—to sell his soul to the Protestant ascendency 
~—or to be honest and industrious, and ply at his profession. 
He chose the last—and (the most wondrous thing in his won- 
derful career) it came to pass, that notwithstanding the many 
apparent disqualifications under which he started, he rose, and 
not slowly, to an eminence which no one put himself would 
have ventured to predict. ‘He is now “ quantum mutatus ab 
illo,” a very able and. distinguished person at the Irish Bar, 
Mr. Sergeant. Goold. 
If I have ushered in my notice of this gentleman with an 
allusion to the freaks of his youth, of which, after all, I may 
have received an exaggerated account, it is because I consider 
it to be infinitely to his praise that he should have so manfully 
-surmounited his early pretensions and disappointments, as the 
progress of his professional history has evinced. The study 
of « four-day rules,” and “notices to quit,” demands no extra- 
ordinary reach of intéllect ; but- the transition from the airy

speculations of a sanguine and ambitious disposition to these 
unimaginative details is one the most abrupt and mortify- 
ing that ever tried the elasticity and patience of the mental 
powers. 
Mr. Goold, notwithstanding the friskiness and levity of his 
external deportment, had the inward energy to face and sur- 
mount the repelling ‘task. He plunged with a hardy and 
exploring spirit into the wilderness of law— burst through its 
perplexities, drank freely, and made no wry faces, from its 
bitter springs; and by a perseverance in patient and solitary 
labor, entitled himself to more substantial returns than that 
applause which he had once prized above every earthly com- 
pensation. 
Some time after Mr. Goold had formed this meritorious reso- 
lution, an’ incident befell. him, of which it is difficult to say 
whether it was most calculated to quicken or to damp his new- 
born ardor for laborious occupation. When Burke’s celebrated. 
“Reflections on the French Revolution” appeared, the author 
and the book, as all my readers know, were vigorously assailed. | 
My. Goold, considering the subject not unworthy of his powers, 
had thrown himself into ‘the controversy. He was at the time 
in a frame of mind befitting a sturdy partisan. He had re- 
cently returned from Paris, where, during a residence of some 
time, he had been an eyewitness of the disgusting clamor and 
excesses of the period. He was also still smarting from the 
recollection of certain rude accolades that- had been foreibly: 
imposed upon himself by sundry haggard Naiads of the Halle 
—a perversion of the authentic rights of men and of women, 
against which, when he came to record the fact, he did-not fail 
to protest with genuine antigallic indignation. His paniphlet. 
was entitled, characteristically enough, a “Defence of Mr. 
Burke’s work ‘against ail his opponents.’” The number that 
had ‘already declared themselves in print amounted to ten—~ 
two anonymous ladies, and eight gentlemen—among whom 
were Doctors Towers, Price, and Priestley.* 
  * Eminent dissenters, ultra-liberal in 1 polities. Dr. John Towers, was a Unita- 
rian preacher, and wrote several biographical and political works. He died 
in 1799, aged sixty-two. Dr. Richard Price, celebrated for his ability in: arith.

DEFENCE OF BURKE. 237 
-. Whe defender-ef Burke took each of them in detail. . The 
gentlewomen he despatched with a good deal of gallant for 
pearance; but for the doctors and their male auxiliaries he 
had no mercy.. He belabored them with unsparing logic and 
more relentless rhetorie, until every sign of sense and argu- 
ment was beaten out of them, and proclaimed his victory by a 
final: flourish of trumpets to the renown of Burke. “I never, 
‘says he, saw Mr. Burke but once. I saw him from the gallery 
of the House of Commons. I know no man that knows him. 
I probably shall know no man that knows him. In a few 
weeks I leave this country, perhaps never to return. I expect 
but little from any man. I shall never ask any thing. . In 
whatever country I may live, i in whatever situation I may be 
placéd, I shall look down on grandeur, I shall look up to 
greatness. Nor wealth, nor rank, nor power, nor influence, - 
shall bend my stubborn neck. I am prostrate before talents ; 
I am prostrate before worth; my admiration of Mr. Butke 
amounts almost to enthusiasm,” &c. . 
This was pretty strong ‘incense, and there was more of the 
same kind; but I am quite certain that it was offered without 
the remotest expectation of any return in either praise or 
profit; and as to the writer's professions of independence, 
though very hazardous in so young an Irishman, they have 
been. amply justified by his subsequent life. The pamphlet, 
metical: calculations, was consulted by William Pitt, as to the best mode of 
Paying off the national debt, and . suggested the Sinking Fund, which Alison 
‘thinks would have affected its purpose, if strictly adhered to and persevered 
in. When the French revolution- broke out, Dr. Price, who had charge of an 
Arian congregation, near London, preached a sermon “ On the Love of Coun- 
try,” in which he hailed the French revolution as the comniencement of- 
a glorious era. Burke, in his celebrated Reflections on that event, severely 
animadverted on Price and his opinions. Dr. Price died in 1791, aged sixty- 
eight.— Dr. Joseph. Priestley, a dissenting minister, well known as a political 
writer and experimental philosopher, also was an ardent admirer of the French _ 
revolution, and a mob at Birmingham, where he resided, burned his house, 
library, manuscripts, and scientific apparatus and instruments, his life being in 
imminent danger also. He retired to the United States in 1794, and died at 
Northumberland, in Pennsylvania, in 1804, aged seventy-one. His published 
works extend to neurly eighty voluvies—M. . oa

however, taken altogether, attracted the notice and. excited 
the gratitude of Burke.* : 
The fact is rather curious, as illustrating the predicament of 
* By the common consent of competent Judges, of all shades of politics, 
Burke was one of the greatest men at a period in British history, -when émi- 
nence was less frequent than at present. Dr. Jehnson, who knew him well, , 
said, Edmund Burke in discourse, calls forth ail the powers of my mind; were 
I to argue with him on my present state, it would be the death of me.” Some- 
body asked him whether he did not think that Burke resembled Cicero, and 
Johnson answered, “No, sir: Cicero resembles Burke.” At another time he 
‘gaid that no person of sense ever met Burke under a gateway to avoid a show- 
er, who did not go away convinced. that he was the first man in England.— 
Fox, after their quarrel, publicly confessed that all he had ever read if books, 
all that his fancy had imagined, all that his reasoning faculties had suggested, 
or his experience had taught him, fell far short of the exalted knowledge which 
he had acquired from Burke. Grattan, when studying law in London, often 
heard Burke speak (in 1772, ere he had reached middle life), and said he was 
ingenious, oratorical, imdaunted ; boundless in knowledge, instantaneous in his 
apprehensions, abundant in his language, speaking with profound attention 
and acknowledged superiority.—Pitt characterized his remarks as the over- 
flowing of a mind, the richness of whose wit was unchecked for the time by 
its wisdom.—Cazales declared that Burke possessed the sublimest talents, the 
greatest and rarest virtues, that ever were enshrined in a single character. 
Gerard Hamilton, when at variance with him, protested that he understeod 
” everything except gaming and music— Windham said that it was not among 
the least calamities of the times that the world had lost him.— (Crabbe spenks .

until the subject-matter was hidden beneath the illustrations. His eloquence 
was too rich. for the bulk of his auditors, consisting of plain country-gentlemen

rather than convinced. His published must not be tuken as his spoken speech- 
cs—for when they came to be printed he rewrote and corrected them so much 
that the compositors usually found it easier to distribute the type and reset the 
whole matter than to attempt to alter it on the stone or in the galley! Lat-

« Who, born for the. universe, narrowed his mind, 
~ And: to party gave up what was meant for mankind: 
Who, too deep for his hearers, still went on refining, 
And thought of convincing when they thought of dining.” 
General Fiupatrick, speaking of Burke, said, “ Ask any well-informed public 
character, who is the best-informed man in Parliament, and the answer will 
‘certainly be, Burke; inquire who is the most eloquent or the most witty, and 
the reply will be, Burke ; then ask who is the most tiresome, and the responsé 
still will-bé, Burke—most certainly, Burke.” ' Born in Ireland, on the: first 
day of 1730, Burke went to England, at the age of twenty-three, to study law. 
His family chiefly supported him in London, but he also earned money by his 
pen. His “ Vindication of Natural Society,” and his “Treatise on the Sub- 
lime and Beautiful, published in £756, introduced him into literary society. 
Nine years after, he became private secretary to the Premier (the Marquis of 
Rockingham), who brought him into Parliament. Then commenced that long 
and brilliant career which is part of English history. His first effort, as‘a pol- 
itician, was in favor of the American colonies, and, for several years, he op- 
posed the obnoxious measures of the Government. He joined Fox in opposing 
Lord North’s administration, which they broke up— Burke taking office under 
the new Ministry, retiring on the sudden death of Lord Rockingham, and re- | 
turning under the Coalition of Fox and North. At the age of five-and-twenty, 
Pitt became Premier, and thenceforth Burke was exiled from office. This 
was in 1783, and Burke continued a mere oppositien-member until 1786, when 
he became principal.on the impeachment of Warren Hastings. During the 
insanity of George III. in 1788, Burke joined Fox in asserting the claims of 
the Prince of Wales to a regency without restrictions. In 1789, when the 
French Revolution broke out, and his friends hailed it as the dawn of freedom 
for the nations, Burke threw himself headlong into violent opposition, renounced 
all connection with Fox, published his “ Reflections on the French Revolution,” 
which the European despots had translated into many languages, while George 
IIL presented copies of it to his particular friends, ¢s “a book which every 
gentleman ought to study.” The work was so elaborated that no fewer than 
ten or twelve proofs were destroyed before he could please his own fastidious 
taste. He continued possessed with an anti-Gallican feeling during the remain- 
ing few years of -his life. In 1795, he obtained a State-pension of twelve hun- 
dred. pounds sterling a year, afterward raised to three thousand seven hundred 
. pounds sterling, with the remainder to his widow, who survived him very many 
-years.'-It is impossible to say whether an understanding that-he was to be ao 
‘rewarded ‘made Burke write down (as far as he could) the principles of lib- 
ery which he'had: dvowed and defended for thirty years, but Sir Philip Francis

_ principles he himself had taught them. Still professing: the 
tenets of “an exalted freedom,” he was pouring forth curses 
and derision upon one of the most provoked and necessary acts 
of freedom which the world had ever witnessed; and such is: 
the sophistry with which a favorite passion can practise upon 
the strongest intellect, he would fain persuade himself. that he 
was consistent to the last, and that doctrines which were hailed 
with Joy in every despotic coterie of Europe, were the only 
genuine and unadulterated maxims of a British Whig. 
But though bold even to overbearing in his public assertions 
of his personal consistency, it is not unreasonable to surmise 
that, in his private hours, his heart was ill at ease. He must 
have felt that his fame, if not his conscience, was in want of 
external support. Certain, however, it is, that he grasped at- 
the voluntary offer with something like the sign of a sinking 
spirit. The tributes of ardent admiration and respect.so pro- 
fusely seattered through his young countryman’s pamphlet 
touched the veteran’s feelings, and lived in his memory upon. 
the first occasion that offered of marking his sense of the obli, 
gation. - 
The opportunity seemed to present itself upon the appoint 
ment of Lord Fitzwilliam* in 1795 to the government of: Tres 
  (the reputed author of “The Letters of Junius”) used to say that if the friends 
of peace and liberty had subscribed thirty thousand pounds sterling to-relieve 
‘Burke’s pecuniary embarrassments, there would have been no war against ‘ths ~ 
French Revolution. Burke's writings vindicated Pitt's policy of war. 
France, to restore “legitimacy,” and this war added six hundred million 
pound’ sterling to tho National Debt of England! Burke died on July 8 
1797, aged sixty-seven.— M.

BURKE'S GRATITUDE. . 241 
land... One evening Mr. Goold was sitting alone in his lodging, 
and indulging (if it can be called an indulgence) in those 
épressing refléctions-upon his future prospects with which the 
stoutest-hearted: junior barrister is occasionally visited, when 
an English letter was put into his hand. It was from Edmund 
Barke. It imported that “he had not forgotten Mr. G.’s ad- 
mirable pamphlet, and that. he was most desirous to advance, 
as far as it in his power lay, the author’ s fortunes. An occa- 
sion appeared to offer. The new viceroy. of Ireland was com- 
ing; preparatory to his departure for that country, to pass some 
days at Beaconsfield ; and: if the demolisher of. the ten oppo- 
nents could contrive, without loss of time, to cross the Channel, 
and meet his lordship at Mr. Burke’s, the happiest. results 
might be anticipated.” None but those who know the brisk- 
ness of Mr. Goold’s temperature, even at the present day, can. 
well conceive the delicious perturbation of spirit that must 
have ensued.. The lustre. of the invitation itself—the ex- 
pected, glory of being present at conferences where the ap- 
proaching redress of Irish wrongs was to be freely canvassed 
—the elevating prospect of. being himself officially selected to 
contribute the aid of his attainments to the labors of a patriotic 
administration — these and many other bright concomitants had 
just arranged themselves into a picture almost too dazzling for 
mortal eye, when one miserable reality intervened like an 
angry cloud, and the gorgeous imagery faded away into mel- 
ancholy dimness. 
He was under a financial incapacity of complying with the

mortifying obstacle, when one of -his friends, the late Sir 
Charles Ormsby, entered the room. 
“Was there ever such an unlucky fellow?” said he, handing 
the letter to Sir Charlés. “See there, what an opportunity 
of making my fortune presents itself; and yet, for want of 
about a hundred pounds to go over and make a proper appear

water ;* their fatal counsels prevailed; the patriotic Viceroy 
was recalled; the doom of Ireland was sealed, and the subject 
of the present sketch reconsigned to the hard destiny of a lezal 
‘drudge. Fortunately, however, and honorably for himself, his 
spirit was too buoyant to sink beneath the disappointment. 
He betook himself with unabated ardor to his former pursuits.

clients poured in upon him; in a few years he was investéd

His face; though he sometimes gives a desponding hint that it

nised gladiators “of the Irish Court of Common Pleas, over which presided the 
punning Lord Norbury, with thé glow of Bacchus and the cheeks of Kolus’ 
his Lordship, it should be noted, always puffed, like an asthmatic locomotive, 
before uttering a joke. “ Goold was a little man, well formed, and of. consid- 
eralle accomplishments, “Sensitive and fastidious, he acknowledged but one 
earthly model of perfection, which, however, he viewed with Eastern idolatry, 
and that was—himself! With the versatility of a Crichton and the politeness ~ 
of a Chesterfield, all airs and graces, master of everything, and neglecting noth- 
ing, he was “himself alone” unapproached and inimitable, judice Tom.. He 
not only argued, declaimed and philosophized, better than any one else, but 
he sang, he danced, he rode, he even brushed his hair so as to set rivalry at 
defiance. Guileless and harmless vanity! counterpoised by a thousand sterling 
qualities, He was an excellent Nisi-Prius fencer, and even ros¢ at times to a 
high order of eloquence. _Had Goold been contented with the world’s éstimate - 
.of him as he really was, all would have admitted him to be an eminent man. 
But he sharpened censure and excited ridicule by aspiring to be what. no man 
ever was—in every art, trade, science, profession, accomplishment, and pursuit 
under the sun, a.ne plus ultra, The pitch’ to which he carried tis foible was in- 
_credible.. Expatiating one, day-on the risk he ran from a sudden rise of the 
tide when riding on. the North Strand, near Dublin, he assured his hearer, that 
“had he not. been the very best horseman in existence, he must have been 
drowned; in short never was human being in such danger.” His friend re 
plied, “My dear Tom, there was one undoubtedly in still greater, for a poor 
man was drowned there this morning.”’, “ By heaven! sir,” bellowed Goold, 
“T might have beeri drowned if I chose.” There is a portrait of Goold in Bar 
rington’s Secret Memoirs of the Union (taken about the year 1810), which 
shows him with handsome and well-cut features, and a very intellectual ex 
pression. My own recollection of Goold dates as far back .as 1827, when he 
went the Munster Circwit. I saw him at the Cork assizes. He was then a 
whitehaired man, small in person, neat in attire, with that certain elegance of 
manner rarely acquired without familiar iningling in good society, clear com- 
plexion, and very keen eyes. His voice was feeble, and his energy appeared 
‘He was then one of the King’s Sergeants, which gave him prece- 
dence it the bar, and the lead in all the Crown cases. His income continued, 
therefore, long ‘after his actual ability to earn it had declined and faded.—M,

timé. He darts into court to argue a question of costs with the 
‘ precipitation of a man rushing to save a beloved child from the 
flames. This is not trick in him, for among the collateral arts - 
- of attracting notice at the Irish bar is that of scouring with 
breathless speed from court to court, upsetting attorneys’ clerks, 
making panting apologies, with similar manifestations of the 
counsel’s inability to keep pace with the importunate calls 6f 
his multitudinous clients. 
Sergeant Goold stands too high, and is, I am certain, too 
proud to think of resorting to these locomotive devices. His - 
impetuosity is pure temperament. In the despatch of business, 
more especially in the chorus-scenes, where half-a-dozen learnéa 
- throats are at once clamoring for precedence, he a¢quits him- 
“self with a physical energy that puts him almost upon a par 
in this’ respect with that great “lord of misrule” O’Connell 
himself. ~ 
. He is to the full as restless, confident, and vociferative, but 
he is not equally indomitable ; and I have some doubts whether 
- with all his bustle and vehemence, he ever ascends to the true 
sublime of tumult which inspires his learned and unemanci- 
pated friend. ‘The latter, who is in himself an ambulatory 
riot, dashes into a legal affray with the spirit of a bludgeoned 
“hero of a fair, determined to knock down every friend or.foe 
he meets, “ for the honor of .old Ireland.” He. has thé secret 
glory too of displaying his athletic capabilities before an audi- 
ence, by many of whom he knows that he is feared and hated. 
~ Sergeant Goold, who has not the same personal incentive, is 
more measured and courtly in his uproar, and will often, long 
before his lungs are spent, as if his dignity had taken a sudden 
fright, declare off abruptly, and invoke the talismanic interces- 
sion of the Bench. 
_ Let not. the unleained reader imagine that I am affecting a 
tone of idle levity. ‘These forensic rants are of daily recur- 
rence; and to have nerves to withstand them is a matter of no 
little moment to barristers and clients. It is within the sanc-. 
tuaries of justice that much of the rough work of human con- 
cerns is. transacted ; and the subjects, to be handled well, must 
be roughly handled. The knaye must be vehemently ar-

raigned ; the injured clamorously vindicated ; the factious and 
dishonest witness tortured and stunned until his soul surrenders 
the hidden truth. The man who can do this is of value in his 
calling; but should his taste recoil from the rude collision, he 
~may.still attain to legal distinction by other and less rugged 
paths— but .as he values his interest and fame, let him resign 
all hope of making a figure in a nisi-privs Court. 
Sergeant Goold passes in the Irish Courts for an eloquent 
advocate. In one sense of the word he is so; for though, far 
from being a pleasant speaker, and having manifold defects of 
delivery and action, he still contrives to make a very strong 
impression upon:a jury, where feeling is to be excited, or the 
understanding forcibly impelled in a particular direction. His 
faults of manner are angularity, abruptness, and violence. His 
articulation is rapid and unmusical. His diction has no equa- 
bility of low—it bursts out in irregular spirts. But he has a 
clear head, much experience of human character and passion, 
and infinite reliance upon himself. His tones, however faulty, 
are fervid and sincere. His sentiments, though often extrava- 
gantly delivered, are bold and natural, and reach the, heart. 
I would describe his ordinary style of addressing a jury by 
saying, not that it deeply moves them, for that wonld imply 
a more regular and finished order of speaking, but that it « stirs 
them up.” In a word, he bustles through an appeal to the 
intellect or passions with great ability. He commits many 
faults of taste, but no essential breach of skill. 
The jury are often startled by his detonations, and often 
join in the general smile that follows those little, personal epi- 
sodes-into which the learned Sergeant occasionally diverges; 
put, after all, they see that they have before them a man who 
knows well what he is about. ‘They listen to him with atten- 
tion and respect; never suspect that he has the slightest design 
__to puzzle them; and, when they retire to cool their fancies in” 
the jury-room, feel extremely disposed to agree that the views 
he had thrown up to them were founded in the. justice and 
~ good sense of the case.- :

It-is sufficient to state that he had already earned a character

person to co-operate in defending the last pass of the Irish 
Constitution against the meditated surrender by its: perfidious 
guardians. - 
The secret. history of the Union has not yet transpired in 
all its ignominious details. A work professing to perform such 
an act of historical vengeance, and emanating from an eye- 
witness, was undertaken about eighteen years ago. A-kind of. 
_ prefatory volume, taking up the subject at an ominous distance,” 
was published as a specimen. The continuation, or, more’ 
strictly speaking, the commencement, was anxiously expected. 
I have no authority for asserting that there was any tampering 
with the writer’s indignation; but it may be. mentioned as a 
curious coincidence, that the suspension of his design was co-| 
eval with his appointment to be Judge of the Court of Admi-- 
ralty in Dublin, over which, if there be any truth in the old, 
maxim, “Major é longinquo reverentia,” he wust be allowed to 
have presided in a style of the most imposing dfgnity. He 
has for many years been a resident of France; sometimes, no: 
doubt, sojourning in the Isle of Oleron, where our sea-laws were 
originally compiled and promulgated by Richard I., and lat- 
terly in the town of Boulogne-sur-Mer, where his marine medi- 
tations must be greatly assisted by the visible aspect of “things 
flotsam, jetsam, and ligan,” to say nothing of the cheering 
influence of an occasional wreck, in reminding him’ of the ; 
convenience of judicial functions that can be performed by 
deputy.* « : 
* Mr. Sheil appears to have literally stated this “‘ without the beok.” The: 
publication to which he alludes, was in quarto form, with several fine portraits 
well engraved, and as many as six parts or livraisons were published, making ~ 
three hundred end two pages in all. The first part appeared in June, 1809 
(with a proface signed by the author, who dated from Merrion Square, Dublin), . 
and the sixth part was published in March, 1815. The actual title of the book 
ig as follows: “‘ The Historic Memoirs of the Legislative Union between Great’ 
Britein and Ireland; by Sir Jonah Barrington, one of his Majesty’s Council at 
Law, Judge of the High Court of Admiralty in Ireland, and Member of the: - 
lato Irish Parliament for the Cities of Tuam and Clogher.” In point of fact:

would.-have had. some strange things to tell of the honorable 
he was made Judge two years before the appearance of the first number of his 
book. There was an interval of seventeen years between Part VI. and the 
conclusion. - He stated that this delay was caused, not by himself, as the book 
had long ‘been completed, but by three several booksellers, who undertook to 
publish it, having become bankrupt. As the republication, in New York, of 
the clever and popular “ Personal Sketches of his Own Times,” has recently 
drawn attention to Sir Jonah Barrington, I shall give his memoir, which is 
not to be found in any Biographical Dictionary. The Gentlewan’s Magazine 
(of London) when it announced his death, promised a biography, but never 
gave one.~—Sir Jonah Barrington, born in Ireland, in 1767, was called to the 
Irish Bar in 1788, entered Parliament as member for Tuam, in 1790, and 
directly opposed Grattan and Curran—a proceeding which, in riper years, he 
described as “true arrogance.” In 1793, as a reward for his subservience’ to 
the Government, he was appointed to a sinecure in the Dublin Custom-House, 
worth one thousand pounds sterling a year. He was also made King's Coun- 
sel, though only five years at the bar. He says that, in 1799, Lord Castlereagh 
promised to make him Solicitor-General, but afterward refuséd to do so, on 
finding that he was resolved to oppose the Union. He stood candidate for — 
Dublin, in 1803, where he was popular because he had latterly opposed the 
jhated Lord Clare; and the first four persons who voted for him were Grattan, 
Curran, Ponsonby, and Plunket; after a prolonged contest of fifteen days (the 
time of polling is now limited to one) he lost his election. He was made Judge 
of the High Court of Admiralty in Ireland, and knighted in 1807. He published 
a portion of his “ Historic Memoir of the Union,” between 1809 and 1815, and 
went to France in the latter year, being in Paris during Napoleon's “ Hundred 
Days.” From.that time, owing to pecuniary difficulties, he continued to re= _ 
side in France, discharging the duties of his judgeship by deputy. In 1827, 
he published the “ Personal Sketches of his Own Times,” which has had great 
popularity wherever English books are read. In the House of Commons, in 
1890, a serious charge of malversation (applying to his own use funds belong- 
ing to private parties, under the Admiralty laws), and it was reported to the 
- House by a committee of: inquiry that the charge was proven. On thia, both 
Houses of Parliament joined in un address to the Crown to remove him from 
his high office—he had failed in an attempt to disprove‘the charge in person 
before the House of Lords—and he was removed accordingly. Shortly after 
this, he published the remainder of his suspended Memoirs and Anecdotes of 
the Union, and its details are the fullest and most exact yet made public. He 
died at Versailles, April 8, 1834, Barrington was a witty, shrewd, and com- 
panionable man. His persona] sketches are full of: lively incident. OF his ~ 
oral faceti@ the following is a specimen: Once, amid the ruins of a cathedral, 
somebody asked what the nave of the church was? ‘The incumbent, to be 
sure,” said. Bartitigton. When. the clergyman heard of it he observed that 
“ Sir Jonah,had given a key (k) to the question.” —M.

. gentlemen who sold their country. There was much, however, 
that could not be concealed. The measure, smoothed and var- 
nished as it might be to meet the public eye, retained all the 
coarse and disgusting outlines of an Irish job. It was Proposed 
in 1799, and rejected. 
The following year, the proposition was renewed and car- 
ried: In the interval, wonders had been done in the way of 
an amicable arrangement. The predatory rights of an Irish 
representative were duly considered and admitted. A vote 
and its concomitant privileges were not now to be estimated at 
the old market-price of seven years’ purchase, but, being to be 
bought up in perpetuity, a just and commensurate equivalent 
was allowed to meet the increased cost of a majority, all kinds 
of compensation in possession and reversion were forthcoming.* 
Peerages were given down. The Bench was mortgaged. The. 
earnest of a pension was advanced to soothe the impatience of : 
the reversionary placeman. Boroughs were declared to be 
private property, and so excellent and certain a provision for 
the patron’s younger children, that it would be a violation of 
all justice to exact their gratuitous surrender. Their pecuniary 
value was. ascertained, and the public faith solemnly pledged 
to treat a customary breach of the constitution (a title to prop- 
erty of which Blackstone never dreamed) as one that by “the 
courtesy of Ireland” gave the prescriptive offender an equita- 
ble interest in its continuance.t ; so 
* Numerous anecdotes of the legislative higgling on this occasion are current 
in Ireland—some of them sufficiently dramatic. One member, for example; * 
tendered his terms. They were accepted, and a verbal promise given that the 
:eontract should be fuithfully observed. He insisted upon a written guaranty, 
This was refused, and the treaty broken off. The member went downto the: 
house, and vented a virtuous harangue against the proposed measure. As soon . 
as he sat down, the written sectirity was handed to him. He put it in his” 
pocket, voted against his speech, and was in due season appointed to a lucra- , 
tive office which he still enjoys, defying the historian and laughing at the. noe; : 
tion of posthumous fame. . 
+ By the Act of Union, eighty-four boroughs were disfranchised. Remuner-; 
ation, to the amount of fifteen. thousand pounds sterling each, was voted to the. 
patrons, In the debate.on the latter point, one of Lord Castlereagh’s argu...

“These ‘are bit-a few specimens of the means resorted to in 
order to precipitate a measure that was announced in all the 
pomp of prophetic assértion, as-the sure and only means of 
conferring prosperity and repose upon the Irish nation: and 
were it not for certain counteracting circumstances, such as— 
‘the nightly incursions of Captain Rock ; the periodical eclipses 
of the Constitution by the intervention of the Insurrection Act ; 
a pretty general insecurity of life and property; the decay of 
public spirit; the growth of faction ;, a weekly list of insolven- 
cies, murders, conflagrations, and letters from Sir Harcourt 
Lees, unprecedented. in the annals of a happy country — but for 
these, and similar visitations, all originating in the comprehen- 
sive and inscrutable efforts of the prophets themselves to falsify 
their. prediction, the Union, notwithstanding the demerits of 
its supporters, might long since have ceased to be a standing 
topic of popular execration. 
The disasters that, in point of fact, have followed, were 
pretty accurately foreseen by the men who opposed this mueh- 
vaunted measure. They-failed, but they did their duty fearlessly. 
and well, and not one of them, it is but just to say, in a spirit 
of more entire self-oblivion, and more earnest sensibility to his 
public: duties, than the person whose name is prefixed to the 
present article. His manly and upright conduct, as usual in 
Ireland, excited deep and lasting resentment. He was stig- 
matized as an honest Irishman, and, disdaining to atone by 
after-compliances for his original offence, had to encounter all 
those impediments to professional advancement which syste- 
matically followed so obnoxious a disqualification. 
Here I had intended to close my observations upon Sergeant 
Goold; but it occurs to me that there remains one topic, not, 
indeed, connected with his professional life, but of so much 
terests been set-at rest by a certainty of compensation. The injustice of anni- 
hilating provisions in family settlements resting upon the security of boroughs 
was also insisted on. I like better the stern logic of Mr. Saurin; . There can 
_ bono injustice in denying property to be acquired by acta which the law de- 
clares tebe a crime. As well might the highwayman, upon a public road being 
stopt-up, exclaim against. the disturbance of his right to plunder the passen, gers.”

notoriety, and to this day so often canvassed, that a total 
silence upon it might be misconstrued. I allude to the evidence 
which he gave in the year 1818, at the bar of the House of 
Commons, upon the inquiry into the conduct of Mr. Wyndham 
Quin* An imputation was cast upon his character at the 
time; and though stifled, as far as it could be, by the vote of 
-an immense majority of the House, it has not wanted external 
support in that uncharitable spirit, which is ever ready to pro- 
mounce a summary verdict of conviction, upon no other founda- 
tion than the fact of a charge having been made. 
I have now before me the report of the debates, and the 
minutes of the evidence in question. The latter are so 
voluminous, that it would be altogether unjust to the party 
concerned, to propose repelling the accusation by any. analysis 
and comments that could be condensed into my present-limits. 
1 can merely state the general conclusion, to which I have” 
comé upon a minute examination and comparison of the sev- 
eral parts of the evidence ; and that is my full and unhesi- 
tating conviction, that My. Goold was as incapable as the most 
high-minded of his accusers, of intentionally withholding or 
misrepresenting a single fact which he was called upon to dis- 
close.’ He was, I admit, what is technically called “a bad 
witness ;” barristers are proverbially so (instead of an answer 
_ they give a speech). Mr. Goold, from his habits and temper- 
ament, is peculiarly so. Upon every matter, great and small, 
‘he is hot and hasty ; and announces his views with the tone 
and tempér of.a partisan. It is a part of the constitution of 
his mind, to have an undue confidence in the infallibility of his 
faculties and the importance of his personal concerns. All 
this broke out, as it does everywhere else, at the bar of the 
House of Commons: he could no more repress it than he

vesult was that he was thenceforth passed over in all law appointments. Pre~ 
viously, hie elevation to the bench was considered certain. Goold eventually 
became Master in Chancery (a sort of legal sinecure in his case), and died at 
a very advanced age.— M. :

minds of strangers to his peculiarities may naturally enough 
have been unfavorable: but when the question arisen is a 
-denial ofa collateral and unessential matter of fact, a lapse of - 
memory, or a meditated suppression, surely every one, who 
“would not wantonly shake the stability of. character, should 
feel bound to put the tenor of a long and honorable life against 
a most. improbable supposition. 
This was the view taken by those who knew him best : 
among the. rest, by the late Mr. Grattan; whose friendship 
alone formed: high evidence of a-spotless reputation. For 
thirty years Mr. Grattan had been his intimate friend, and 
- had-seen him pass through the ordeal of times which tried, 
as far as any earthly process can try, the worth and honor of 
a man: and what was his impassioned exclamation? “Mr. 
Goold is thoroughly known to me. I would stake my exist- 
ence upon his integrity, as I would upon my own. If he is 
not to be trusted, I know not who is to be trusted!” To this

I .oox upon Mr. Norru to be in several respects a very. 
interesting person. “He is immediately so by the great respec-.

a subject that less directly invites the attention and speculation 
of an observer, i in consequence of certain predicaments of sit- 
uation and feeling, upon which his lot has cast him, and in 
discussing which the mind must, of necessity, ascend from the 
qualities and the fortunes of the individual to considerations of * 
a higher and more lasting concern. If I were to treat of him 
solely as a practising barrister, possessed of certain legal attri- 
putes, and having reached a determined station, the task would. 
be short and simple. But this would be unjust. Mr. Novth’s 
mind and acquirements, and, it may be added, his personal 
history, entitle him to a more extended notice, and, in some. 
points of view, to greater commendation, not unmingled, how-

Sheil himself was schooled in rhetoric. Among the later orators in this Soci- 
ety were Charles Wolfe, author of the noble lyric, “‘ Not a drum was heard,” * 
in which he described the burial of Sir John Moore, who fell, in January, 1809, 
“during the retreat at Corunna. The liberal principles professed and vindicated 
in the Historical Society, induced the University authorities first to.discounte- 
nance it, next to restrict its license, then to drive it out of connection with the 
Gollege, and finally to suppress it. The Speculative Society of Edinburgh, of 
which an account is given in Lockhart’s “ Life of Scott'’—the place where 
Jeffrey, Brougham, and their compeers, learned to be eloquent—appears to 
have much resembled the Historical Society of Dublin. So, also, to this hour, 
are the Debating Clubs (called “The Union”), at the Universities of Oxford 
and Cambridge, where Heber and-Gladstone, as well as Macaulay and Bulwer, -

-elosed by a parting address from the chair, reviewing ‘tnd 
commending the objects of the institution. The task; asa 
mark of honor, was assigned to Mr. North. It was the last of 
his. academic efforts, and is still referred to by those who heard 
him, as a rare and felicitous example of youthful enthusiasm 
for eloquence and letters, soaring above the commonplaces of 
panegyric, and dignifying its raptures by the most luminous 
views, and by illustrations drawn from the resourees of a pure 
and lofty imagination. It was pronounced to be a masterpiece, 
and the author urged to extend the circle of his admirers by 
consenting to its publication. But he had the modesty or the 
_ diseretion to refusé ; and the public were deprived of a compo- . 
sition which, whatever might be its other merits, would at least 
have told as a glowing satire upon the miserable, monastic 
spirit, that soon after abolished the Historical Society as a> 
perilous innovation upon the primitive objects" of the royal 
foundress of Trinity College. It is edifying to add, that John’ 
Locke’s Treatise on Government was also pronounced to in- 
spire doctrines that would have met no countenance “in the 
golden days of good Queen Bess ;” and as such, was expelled 
from the college course. : 
Mr. North’s talents for public speaking were further exer- 
cised, and with increasing reputation, in the Academical So- 
ciety of London. The impression that he made there attracted 
numerous visiters. He had now to stand the brunt of an-au- 
dience little predisposed to be fascinated by provincial decla- 
mation. But the severest judges of Irish oratory admitted 
that his was copious, brilliant, and, best of all, correct: He 
‘was pronounced by some to be fitted for the highest purposes 
ofthe senate. It was even whispered that a ministerial mem- 
ber (a, fortunate emigrant from Ireland, who had lately proved 
his capacity for less delicate commissions), had been secretly 
deputed from Downing street* to “look in” at the academies, - :

and report upon the expediency of tendering a borough and a 
place to the youthful orator.» But whether it was that the 
honorable and learned missionary had no taste for a style of 
eloquence above his own;, or that he missed that native auda- 
city which he. could so well appreciate; or that he had the 
shrewdness to infer, from certain popular tendencies in the 
-speaker’s cast of thought, that he might turn out not to be a 
marketable man—the experiment upon Mr. North’s virgin 
ambition, if ever meditated, was not exposed to the risk of 
failure. The murmur, however, ran that such a proposal had 
been in agitation.. Mr. North’s growing celebrity had all the 
benefit of the rumor ; and when he shortly after appeared in 
the Irish Hall, he was considered to have perched upon that - 
bleak and arid waste as upon amere place of passage, whence, 
at the expected season of transmigration, he was to wing his 
flight to’a brighter and more congenial clime. This latter 
event, however, contrary to the calculations and wishes of all 
who knew him, was for years delayed. It is only the other 
day that Mr. North -has at length been summoned to the 
Senate.* 
In the interval, his progress at the bar, however flattering it 
might be to a person of ordinary pretensions, has not realized 
the auspicious anticipations under which his coming was an- 
nounced. ‘Wherever he has been tried, he has proved his 
legal competency. In some of the qualifications for profes- 
sional eminence, and, among them, those in which a proud but 
unambitious man would most desire to excel —in a, sound and 
comprehensive knowledge of general principles, and a facility 
of developing them in lucid and imposing language, he need 
not shrink from a comparison with a. single contemporary rival.

under the influence of the Marquis of Anglesey, who was then in friendly rela-

In others, and especially in the rarer and higher art: of ‘kind= 
ling and controlling the passions of an auditory, he has not’ 
hitherto answered to the prophetic hopes by which he was - 
“set like a man divine above them,all;” while, in respect of 
that extra-forensic and general importance which a person so: 
gifted might, it was imagined, so rapidly attain, he has been © 
altogether stationary.. When he first appeared to public view, 
he lighted upon a pedestal, and the pedestal and the statue, 
remain where they were. The question is often asked-by 
others (and I doubt not by himself), “How has this come to 
pass?” It is one involving matters of general interest’to all - 
who embark in public life ;.and I shall endeavor, as I proceed, 
to offer a few such incidental hints, as, when collected, may. 
. supply a satisfactory answer. 
The early admirers of this accomplished young man were 
fully warranted at the time in their praises and. predictions. - 
His mind was one of rapid growth, and put forth in its first- 
fruits the same qualities, in both kind and degree, which are 
the subject of just admiration at the present day. His intellect 
is singularly sound and clear. For the acquirement of knowl- 
“edge, it: may be said to be nearly perfect. It is vigorous, 
cautious, and comprehensive. The power of attention, that 
~ ‘master-key to science, is under his absolute control. Whatever 
is. capable of demonstration is within his grasp. Give him any. 
system to explore, and no matter how intricate the paths, 
. wherever a discoverer has gone before, he will be sure to fol- 
low in his track. His understanding, in a word, is eminently~ 
docile; at least so I would infer from the early extent and 
rapidity of his scientific attainments, and from the habits of. 
order and -perspicacity with which he has mastered the less 
manageable dogmas of our national jurisprudence. 
In tlie power of imparting what he has thus acquired, Mr. 
North has also much that is uncommon. One qualification of 
a speaker he possesses in an extraordinary degree. For ex+. 
temporaneous correctness and copiousness of phrase, I would , 
place him in the very highest rank. All that he utters,” 
wherever the occasion justifies the excitement of his faculties,” 
might be safely printed without revision. Period after period *

solicitude—perhaps a slight tinge of aristocratic pride, in his 
determination that the. children of his. fancy ‘should appear 
abroad in no Vulgar garb. He is not like O’Connell, who, 
with the:improvidence of his country, has no compunction in 
flinging a brood of robust young thoughts upon the world 
without a rag to cover them.* Mr. North’s are all tastefully 
* O'Connell had wonderful versatility as a speaker. He literally acted on 
the advice of St. Paul, and was “all things to all men.” In a Court of Law, he 
occasionally joked with a jury, dragged them into his view of the case, by sub- 
tile argument, strong declamation, and an ‘irresistibly natural manner. At a 
political meeting; where he spoke to the multitude, he alternately made them 
smile or get enraged, as he jested or moved their feelings. In Parliament, 
which he did not enter until he was fifty-four years old, he was calm, more 
subdued, more careful, more solicitous in bis choice of words, and his man- 
ner of delivering them. ‘He made some lucky hits, too, which amused the 
members. Such was his allusion to Mr. Walter, of the Times newspaper, who 
retained his seat on the Government side of the House, in 1835, after his Tory 
friends had crossed back to the opposition benches. O’Connell turning to him, 
apostrophized him as . 
“The Jast rose of Summer 
Left blooming alone, 
All its lovely companions 
Ave faded or gone!” - 
So, also, when sneering at the few adherents who sided with Lord Stanley (now 
Earl of Derby), in 1834, when he seceded from the Grey Ministry, he quoted 
two lines from Darwin 
“Thus down thy hill, romantic Asbourne, glides 
The Derby dilly, carrying six insides.” .

and comfortably clad. But-this extraordinary care is uwmark- 
ed'by any laborious effort. In the article of stores of diction,. 
his mind is evidently in affluent circumstances, and betrays no 
lurking apprehension that the demands upon it may,exceed 
his resources. There are no ostentatious bursts of unwonted 
expenditure to keep up the reputation of his solvency. Sen+ 
tence after sentence is disbursed with the familiar air of un- 
concern which marks the possessor of the amplest funds. 
* With qualifications such as these, unequivocally manifested 
at a very early age, and aided by a graceful and imposing 
manner and a personal character which stamped a. credit upon 
all he uttered, and these natural excellences stimulated by a 
generous ambition to answer the general call that was made, 
upon him to be a foremost man in his day, it was naturally to, 
‘be anticipated that Mr. North would do great things; but his 
endowments, however rare; have been greatly marred, as to - 
all the purposes of his fame, by a radical defect of tempera- 
ment, to the chilling influence of which I can trace the failure’ 
of the splendid hopes that attended his entrance upon public 
life. Mr. North has abundant strength of intellect, but he-has . 
not equal energy of will. His mind wants boldness and deter- 
mination of character. It wants that hardihood of purpose 
and contempt of comsequences, without which nothing great in 
thought or action can be accomplished. He is trammelled by 
a fastidious taste, and by a disastrous deference to every petty. 
opinion that may be pronounced upon him. He sacrifices his 
fame to his dignity. Fame, he should have remembered, is: 
like other fair ladies, and faint heart never won her. Like the 
rest, she must be warmly and importunately wooed. He 
shrinks, however, from the notion of committing himself as her 
suitor, except upon a classical occasion. 
TL have been often asked “if I considered Mr. North to be a a 
man of genius?’ My answer has been, “He would be, if he 
dared.” If it were possible to transfuse into his system a few: 
quarts of that impetuous Irish blood which revels in O’Conm ‘ 
nell’s veins—if he could be brought to bestir himself and. 
burst asunder the conventional fetters that enchain his spirit; 
he has many of the other qualities that would entitle him to: 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
HIS FASTIDIOUS TASTES. 259 
that envied appellation. But as it is, his powers are enthralled 
in a state of magnetic suspension between the conflicting in- 
fluences of his.ambition and his apprehensions. “With all the 
.. desire in the world to be an eminent man, and conscious that 
the elements of greatness are within him, one of its. most neces- 
sary attributes he still is without—a sentiment of masculine 
self-reliance, and along with it a calm and settled disdain for 
the approbation of little friends, and the censure of little ene- 
mies, and. the murmurs of the tea-table, and the mock-heroic 
gravity with which mediocrity is ever sure to frown upon a 
style of language or conduct above its comprehension. Hence 
it is, that he has never yet redeemed the pledges of his youth. - 
In his public displays, which, from the same scrupulous taste, 
have been far moré unfrequent than they ought, he has been 
copious, graceful, instructive, and, in genéral, almost faultless 
to a fault. But the lofty spirit of heroic oratory was wanting 
—*“there was no pride nor passion there.” He is so afraid 
of “tearing a passion to tatters,” he'll scarcely venture to touch 
it: He distrusts even light-from heaven for fear it should lead 
astray. oe : 
I am far from attributing these deficiencies to any inherent 
incapacity of lofty emotions in Mr. North; I should rather say 
that he has been in some sort the spoiled child of premature 
renown.. The applause that followed his first attempts taught 
him too soon to propose himself as a model to himself, and to 
shudder at the danger of degenerating from that ideal standard. 
He speculated. “too curiously” upon how. much character -he 
might lose, without considering how much more might yet be - 
gained. In this respect he arrived too soon at his years of 
discretion. His mind seems also to have early imbibed an 
undue predilection for the mere elegancies of life, and. for 
external circumstances as connected with them. In spite of 
his better opinions on the subject of human rights, I am not 
sure that his heart would not beat as high and quick at the 
pageantry of a Coronation, as at the demolition of a Bastille. 
In matters of literature; too, I would almost venture. to say 
that what-in.secret delights him most, is not.the bold, impas- 
sioned, and agitating, but the gentle and diffuse: that he likes

not the: shock of those tempests of. thought that purify the 
mental atmosphere, chasing away the collected clouds, and 
tearing up our sturdiest prejudices by the roots, but rather 
prefers to repose his spirit in the midst of those quiet reveries . 
' where no favorite opinion is in danger of being shaken. In- 
stead of ascending to the mountain-tops with the hardy specu- 
lator, he would rather linger among the charms of the culti- 
vated plain with the meek essayist — where, sauntering. along 
througl scenes of security and repose, with all harsher objects 
excluded from the view, and nothing around but sweet sights, 
sweet-smells, and pleasant noises, becalming every sense, the 
pensive soul, forgetting, for the moment, the world: and its 
ways, is lulled to rest, and dreams that all is right. , 
Mr. North would have written the most beautiful letters in ~ 
the world from the Lake of Geneva, and not the less so from 
the inspiring influence of an clegant residence on its banks. 
His speeches savor of the particular tastes I have been déseri- | 
bing. There is too much of the equanimity of literature about _ 
them—too little of the ardor and impetuosity of passion ~ 
speaking viva voce. They rather resemble high-wrought aea- - 
demic effusions, stately, orderly, and chaste, and having also 
the coldness of chastity, than the glowing eruptions of a mind 
on fire, warming and illuminating whatever comes within its 
range. To conclude, Mr. North is,a proficient in. the formal 
parts of the higher order of oratory—in diction—arrange- 
ment—the selection and. command of topies— delivery — ac- 
tion— but (to adopt some hackneyed illustrations) in the same 
- .degree as moonlight differs from the splendor of the sun, pearl 
from diamond, silver from gold, the scented and Well-trimmed 
shrubbery from the majestic forest, the placid waters of the 
lake from the impetuous heavings of “old ocean,” so may ~ 
he be said to fall short of first-rate excellence in the: art of . 
speaking. + 
From my observations upon Mr. North’ s mind, neutralized 
as he has permitted it to become, I should say that now his 
chief strength lies ii sarcasm, and in that species of humor. 
which consists of felicitous combinations of mock-heroie_im-~ 
agery and gorgeous diction, descriptive of the feelings: and

situation of the object ridiculed ;— and yet he has employed 
his: powers in. this’ respect so sparingly, that I have some 
doubts whether he be fally aware of their extent. I have not 
heard that he gave any early indications of this talent; and 
though at first view itmay appear-to be at variance with the 
leading propeusities of his mind, J do not conceive it difficult 
‘to account for its existence. On the contrary, it seems natural 
- enough that a-person gifted with pewers of language and ima- 
gination, but of too timid a taste to risk them upon sincere and 
serious trains of sentiment, should resort to ridicule, and to 
that particular kind, to which I have just adverted.. Such a 
person feels what an awful thing it is to be accountable.te 
sneering public, for the appropriateness of every generous 
thought and glowing illustration into which a well-meaning 
but too fervid enthusiasm may betray him. . The incessant 
‘recollection of the proximity of the ludicrous to the sublime, 
appals and paralyzqs him; but give him an adversary whose 
motives and reasonings and language are to be travestied, and 
the spell that bound his faculties is dissolved.. Here, where 
every exaggeration has a charm, he ventures to give full scope 
to his fancy. The very temper of mind that renders him sen- 
sitive and wary when he speaks in his own person, suggests 
the boldest images, and the more grotesque they are thé het- 
_ter, when by a rhetorical contrivance the whole responsibility 
of them is, as it were, shifted upon the shoulders of another.” 
I would almost venture to predict, that it is this way Mr. North: 
“ will make himself most: felt in the House of Commons.* He 
has the classic authority of Mr. Canning; for proposing as a 
subject the Duigenan redivivus of the House; but I have my 
fears that he will select a nobler mark than Master Ellis. I

therefore caution my Opposition friends, and especially Mr - 
Hume, to be on their guard. 
Mr. North’s exterior has nothing very striking; his frame 
is of the middle size and slender, his features small and pallid, 
and unmarked by any prominent expression, save those ha- 
hitual signs of exhaustion, from which so few of the occupied 
members of his profession are exempt. If he were a stranger 
to me, I should pass him by without observation, but, knowing 
who he is, and. feeling what he might be, I find his face to be 
fay from’ a blank. Upon examination, it presents an aspect 
of. still and steady thoughtfulness, with that peculiar curve 
about the lips when he smiles (as he often does} which, itnports 
arefined but too fastidious taste. When the countenance is 
in repose, I fancy that I can also catch there a trace of lan- 
guor, such as succeeds a course of struggles where high and 
early hopes had been embarked, while a tinge of melancholy, 
‘so-slight as to be dispersed by the feeblegt gleam, but still re- 
turning and settling there, tells me that some and the most. 
cherished of them have been disappointed. I confess that: I 
respect: Mr. North too much to regret those indications of 
secret dissatisfaction with his condition; and more especially, 
because in-him they are entirely free from the ordinary fret- 
fulness and acrimony of mortified ambition. He is too consid- 
erate and just to wage a splenetic warfare with the world be- 
-eause all the bright visions of his youth have not been realized; 
and hé is still too young and too cautious of his capacity-to be 
irretrievably depressed when reminded by others or by himself, 
that hitherto Fame has only. spoken of him in’ whispers, and 
that much must be done in both intellect and action; before 
the glorious clang of her trumpet shall rejoice his ear. uN? 
These allusions te Mr.-North’s omissions as a public man,

fulfilled the task assigned him. He has won his way to a re- 
spectable station in a most precarious profession; enjoys con- 
siderable estimation for general talent, and is cordially honor- 
ed by all who know him, for the undeviating dignity and purity 
of his private life. But from those to whom much is given 
tiuch is: exacted:. My quarrel with Mr. North is, that living 
under a-system teeming with abuses, and loudly calling upon 
aman of his character and abilities to interpose their influence, 
he:should have consented to keep aloof.a neutral and acquies- 
eent-spectator, For fifteen long years, a liberal and enlight- 
ened- Irishman, seeing with his own eyes’ what an English 
barber could not read of without. contempt. for the nation that 
endured, and not to have left a single document of his indig- 
nation!—-not'a speech, not a pamphlet, not an article in a 
periodical publication—not even that forlorn hope of a mal- 
treated cause, a well-penned protesting resolution! What 
availed it to his country that he was known to be a friend of 
toleration, if his co-operation was withheld upon every occa- 
sion where his presence would have inspired confidence, and 
his example have acted as a salutary incitement to others? 
What, that his theories upon the question of free discussion 
were understood to be manly and just, if, after having witness- 
ed the irruption of an armed soldiery into 4 legal meeting, and 
being himself among the dispersed at the point of the bayonet, 
lie had the morbid patience to be silent under the affront to 
the Jaws, paying such homage to the times ag soareoly to 
“ Hint his abhorrence i in a lenguid sneer.” 
His learning, too, his literary and philosophic stores, things ‘g0 
much wanted in Ireland— where has he left a vestige of their 
existence, so as to justify the most flattering of his friends in 
saying to him, “You have not lived in vain, and should you 
unfortunately be removed, before your time, your country will 
miss you?”

respect, in him, he is of so meek a carriage, and has about him 
so much of the gentleman and the scholar, that-I can not divest 
myself of a certain feeling of almost individual regard. Nor, 
- in putting the matter thus, am I aware that I make any unrea- 
sonable exactions. At particular seasons, his profession, no _ 
doubt, must demand his undivided eare: but there are intervals ~ 
which, with a mind full as Mr. North’s is, might have been, and 
may still be, dedicated to honorable uses. ‘There are not want- 
ing contemporary precedents to show what the incidental la- 
hors of a lawyer may accomplish, in science, in letters, in public 
spirit. Let him look'to Mr. Brougham, to the versatility of his 
pursuits, and the varieties of his fame—the Courts, the House:

midable to all by whom a high-spirited man would desire to 
be feared. 
T see but one plausible excuse for the course of political qui- 
etude to which Mr. North so perseveringly adhered, and in 
fairness I should not suppress it. It was his fate to have com- 
. menced his career under the Saurin dynasty. Things are 
something better now; but, some twelve or fifteen years ago, 
wo’ betided the patriotic wight of the dominant creed who 
should ventnre to whisper to the public that all was not un- 
questionable wisdom and justice in'the ways of ‘that potent and 
inscrutable gentleman ! The opposition of a Catholic was far 
less resented. The latter was a condemned spirit, shorn of all 
effective strength, and was suffered to flounder away impotent 
and unheeded in the penal abyss; but for a Protestant, and, 
-more than all, a Protestant barrister, to question the infinite 
perfection of the Attorney-General’s dispensations, was mon- 
strous, blasphemous, and punishable—and punished the cul- 
prit was. All the loyal powers of the land sprang with in- 
atinctive co-operation to avenge the outrage upon their chief 
and themselves. The loyal gates of the Castle were slapped 
in his face. The loyal club to which he claimed admission, 
buried his pretensions under a shower of black- beans. The 
loyal attorney suspected his competency, and withheld his con- 
fidénce. The loyal discounter declined to respect his name 
upon a bill. . The loyal friend, as he-passed him in the streets, 
exchanged the old, familiar, cordial greeting, for a penal nod.

enough to common men. Mr. North was strong enough to have 
faced and vanquished it. Instead of fearing to provoke the 
persecuting spirit of the times, he might have securely wel- ° 
comed it as the most unerring evidence of hig importance. - 
Having said.so much, I am bound to add that the foregoing 
observations have not the remotest reference to Mr. North’s 
conduct at the bar. There he is entitled to the highest praise, 
and I give it heartily, for his erect and honorable depor tment 
‘in the public and (an equal test of an elevated spirit) in the 
private details of his profession. The most conspicuous occa- 
sion upon which he has yet appeared was on the trial of the 
political-rioters at the Dublin theatre.* It was altogether a 
singular scene— presenting a fantastic medley of combinations 
and contradictions, such as nothing but the. shuffling of Irish 
events could bring together: a band of inveterate loyalists 
brought to the bar of justice for a public outrage upon the per- 
“son of the King’s representative; an Attorney-General prose- 
cuting on behalf of one part of the state, and the other exulting 
with all their souls at the prospect of his failure; a popular 
Trish bench; an acquitting Irish jury ; and, finally, the profes- 
sional confidant of the Orange Lodges—the chosen defender _ 
of their acts and doctrines, Mr. North. It would be difficult 
fo conceive a more perplexing office. He discharged it, how- 
ever, with great talent and (what I apprehend was less ex- 
pected) consummate boldness. As a production of eloquence, 
his address to the jury contained no specimens of first-rate ex-

party threw a bottle at Lord Wellesley, in Dublin theatre, and bills of indict- 
ment were preferred against certain persons apprehended on a charge of com- 
plicity in this affair. ‘The Grand Jury (also Orange) ignored the bills. ‘The ~

signs of” a. spirit and power from which I would infer, that, 
should State Trials unfortunately become frequent in Iveland 
during his’ continuance at the baz, he is destined to make no 
inconsiderable ffgure as a leading counsel for the defences. 
The Williamites were grateful for the effort, and greeted their 
suecessful advocate with enthusiastic cheers on his exit from 
the Court. This was, I believe, the only public homage of the. 
kidd that Mr. North had ever received; and, however welcome 
at the moment, could scarcely fail to be followed by a senti- 
ment of sadness, when he reflected upon the untowardness of 
the fate which doomed his name to be for the first time exalted 
to the skies on the yell of a malignant faction that he must 
have detested and despised. 
‘The preceding views of Mr. North’s intellectual characteris- 
tics were formed, and in substance committed to paper, before 
his recent appearance in the House of Commons.* Since that 
event I have seen nothing calling on me to retract or qualify 
my first impressions. If the effect which he produced then 
was not all that had been expected, I attribute it far less to 
_any deficiency of general power, than to that want of energy 
and directness of purpose, which is the besetting infirmity of - 
his mind. Let him but emancipate himself (and he Aas shown 
that he can do so) from the petty drags that have heretofore 
impeded his course, and he may yet become distinguished to 
his heart’s content, and, what is better, eminently useful to his 
country. He has the means, and nothing can be more propi- 
tious than the period. Ivish questions press upon the Parlia- 
ment; upon the most vital of them (the Catholic) he thinks 
with the just, and will not fail to make a stand. . Upon the oth- 
ers he can be, what is most wanting in that House, a fearless 
witness, Wherever he interposes, the purity of his personal 
character—his position with the Government—even the neu- 
trality of his former course, will give him weight and credit. 
Nor (as far as his ambition is concerned) will services thus

Mr. Wattace is in several respects aremarkable man. He 
has for many years held an eminent station in his profession, 
and is pre-eminently entitled to the self-gratulation of reflect- 
ing, that his success has been of that honorable kind in which 
neither accident nor patronage had any share. Of his early 
life and original prospects I have heard little, beside the fact 
that, in his youth, he found himself alone in the world, without 
competence or connections, and with merely the rudiments of 
general knowledge; and that-under these disheartening cir- 
cumstances, instead of acquiescing in the obscurity to which 
he was apparently doomed, he formed, and for years persevered 
in a solitary plan of self-instruction, until, feeling his courage 
and ambition increased by the result of the experiments he 
had made upon himself,.and measuring his strength with the 
difficulties to be encountered, he rejected the temporary 
allurements of any more ignoble calling ; and, with a boldness 
and self-reliance which the event has justified, decided upon 
the Bar as the most suited to his pretensions. 
With this view, and with a patient determination of purpose, 
which is among the most trying exercises of practical philos-— 
ophy, he qualified himself for Trinity College, and entering 
there, gave himself (what wag probably his chief motive in 
submitting to the delay) the reputation of having received a 
regular and learned education. He was called to the Bar in

vanced at a gradual and steady pace to competence, then on to 
affluence, and finally to the conspicuous place which he now

as developed by his early life, we find none of the peculiarities 
of his country —no mercurial vivacity —no movements of an 
impatient and irregular ambition—but rather the composed 
and dogged ardor of a Scotchman, intent upon his distant ob- 
ject of fame and profit, and submitting, without a murmur, to 
the fatigues and delays through which it must be approached.

t Gratton was, par excellence, the most liberal man in Ireland—devoting 
over forty years of his public life to the cause of national independence and the 
advancement of civil and religious berty. He was not always popular, though 
‘Ireland gave him fifty thousand pounds sterling for his services in 1782. -. Flood 
insinuated tkeat he had betrayed his country for gold, and was “a mendicant 
patriot. who, for prompt payment, had sold himself to the Minister.” Lord 
Claré denounced him as “an infernal democrat.” The Corporation of Cork 
voted that the street, which had been named Grattan street, should in future, 
be called Duncan street. The Dublin Corporation, who had graced’ their halt 
with his portrait, tore it down from the wall, and received a motion that he be 
expelled from their body. Out of this an incident arose: There was a parlia- 
mentary contest for Dublin, in 1803, and Sir Jonah Barrington was a popular 
candidate. “Grattan went up to vote for him, and was objected to.as one who 
bad been expelled the corporation. <A violent Ascendency man, named John 
Gifford (whose son, Doctor Gifford, is the able Editor of the London Standard), 
made the objection. When silence was restored, Grattan thus denounced him: 
“Mr. Sheriff, when I observe the quarter whence the objection comes, I am 
not surprised at its being made. It proceeds from the hired traducer of his 
country—-the excommunicated of his fellow-citizens—the regal rebel—the 
unpunished ruffian—the bigoted agitator! In the city, a firebrand—~in the 
court, a liar—in the streets, a billy—in the field, a coward! So obnoxious 
is he to the very party he wishes to espouse, that he is only supportable by 
doing those dirty acts the less vile refuse to execute.”—This was a pretty 
’ strong use of the vernacular. When the roll of voters was examined, it showed 
that Grattan’s name was never erased, so he voted for his friend.— M.

‘from a native of any other country. It is as an advocate (as 
contradistinguished from a mere lawyer), that he has been 
most successful; and here the characteristic quality of his style 
and manner, oy rather, the compound result of all the qualities 
_ that belong to him professionally and individually, is masculine 
energy. He is emphatically “the strong man.” There is 
at all times, and on all occasions, an innate, constitutional, 
imposing vigor, in his topics, language, tones, and gestures ; 
all co-operating to a common end, and keeping for ever alive 
in his auditory the conviction that they are listening to a 
singularly able-minded man. , 
This impression is aided by his general aspect. His face, 
without a particle of pedantic solemnity, is full of seriousness 
and determination. Whatever of lofty or refined emotion 
may belong to the individual, never settles upon his counte- 
nance, and equally absent is every trace of sentimental dis- 
content: but you find there a rigid, statue-like stability of 
expression, importing consciousness of strength and immobility 
of purpose, ahd suggesting to those who know his history and 
character an early-and deliberate preparation for the world’s 
frown, and a determination to retort it. His features, though 
_ remarkably in unison with the intellectual and moral charac- 
ters impressed upon them, have few physical peculiarities that 
can be conveyed by description? They are of the hardy 
Celtic outline, are evidently composed of the most durable 
materials, and still retain all the compactness and rotundity 
of early youth. His frame, though little above the middle 
size, presents the same character of vigor and durability, and 
contributes its due proportion toward completing that general 
idea of strength, which I have selected as most descriptive of 
the entire man. The more stern attributes, however, that I 
“have ascribed to him, refer exclusively to the individual, as 1 
haye seen him in the discharge of his public duties. In the 
intercourse of private life he is, according’ to universal report, 
“of the most frank and familiar maniiers, an extremely attractive 
companion, and, what is better still, a warm and constant friend.

_Considering,.as I do, Mr. Wallace’s mind to be in its original 
‘eoustitution what may be denominated one of all-work, I 
should say of it, that among the multiform and. dissimilar 
departments of intellectual exercise involved in the profession 
of the law, there was searcely any for which he could not have 
sprovided a corresponding aptitude of faculty. His } powers 
have, however, been very much confined to those classes of 
. eases in which facts, rather than legal doctrines, are the 
subject-matter of investigation. . This may have been ‘partly 
accidental; for, at the Irish bar, it is not only a matter of 
chance whether the individual is to succeed at all, but, chance, 
in the majority of instances, determines the particular facul- 
ties that must be developed ard permanently cultivated for 
the purpose. There the aspirant for professional eminence 
can not, as in England, select a particular department, and 
make it the subject of his exclusive study.* One comes to 
the scene of exertion, relying upon his stores of learned re- 
search and his capacity for the solitary labors of the desk—- 
but the necessity of taking whatever business is offered, throws 
him into a totally dissimilar line. He becomes a nisi-prius 
or motion lawyer, upon compulsion ; strains his lungs in open 
court, to a pitch that neither nature nor himself had ever de- 
signed; and ascertaining by. experience that this is to be his 
way of “getting on,” resigns his original studies as unpro- 
ductive toil, and concludes a prosperous career, without having 
ever given an opinion upon a title, or settled the draft of a-deed _ 
of assignment. .

Full of. confidence and ardor, and fired with admiration of 
-preceding models, he is all for eloquence— and eloquence of the 
highest order. He studies black-lettér, and technicalities ag a 
painful effort, but his cordial meditations are over the defence 
of Milo, and the immortal productions of the Athenian school. 
* At the Irish as at the American bar, the lawyer takes all business that 
comes to him—whether Nisi Prius, criminal, equity, mercantile, ecelesids- 
tical, or civil, not declining special pleading and conveyancing. In England, 
the ‘lawyer usually limits himself to one line, on which he concentrates his 
- attention and abilities. ‘The natural result fa that one practice makes good gen-

spective of popular occasions, with the usual accompaniments 
of crowded galleries, spell-bound juries, an admiring bench, an 
applauding bar—but let him take ‘heed. It is at all times in 
the power of two or three friendly attorneys, who are in any 
‘business, to get him into Chancery, and keep him there, and

which he was originally, and still continues more peouliarly 
fitted to excel. 
Judging of him from his professional attributes and his col- 
lateral pursuits, I am led to infer that the early and strongest 
propensity of his mind was for the discovery of truth ; or in other

jection to habits of an opposite tendency. It was that of an Englishman, the

- native achool, and forced his way at the Irish bar, entirely by his legal superi- 
ority.: ‘It was only, when in the regular course of seniority he came to address 
juries, that it was first discovered by others, and probably by himself, that there 
lay in the depths of his mind a mine of rich materials that had never been ex- 
plored. To the last he had to dig for them. For the first half hour he was noth- 
ing; it took him that time to reconnoitre his subject, and get thoroughly heated: 
after that he was—not an accomplished speaker—for he never affected the 
externals of oratory~but in its great essentials —unity of purpose, and bold, 
rapid, and impassioned reasoning, enforced by the vigorous practical tones and 
gestures of real life —posscssor of an energy, that at times, and often for a long

enlighten or perplex him on that point. If questions on the 
Currency rage around him, he must take no part, except in’ 
hoping that the decision will not diminish the exchangeable 
value of the counsel’s fee. If he chances to hear that a bog 
has burst from its moorings, or that a blazing comet threatens 
to pounce upon our planet, he must leave them to be treated - 
of by the curious in such matters, and go on with his medita-

educing an orderly, lucid, and consistent statement out of a 
chaotic assemblage of intricate and, conflicting facts; for his 
knowledge of human, nature, both practical and metaphysical, 
aud, along with these, for the sustained and authoritative force 
of his language and delivery, which operate as a kind of per-

I should say that the most fitting place for the exhibition of 
such powers would be before such a tribunal as the admirers 
of Malone would have assigned him; but a tribunal, so consti-

frequently called upon to serve as jurors in that description of 
cases in which Mr. Wallace’s professional superiority is most

“heavy motions”) are more numerous: in the Court of King’s

It is accordingly in this court that Mr. Wallace, in his ordi- 
. mary every-day manner, as an advocate, may be heard to most - 
advantage. His skill in dissecting a knavish affidavit is ad- 
mirable, and renders him the terror of all knavish deponents 
upon whom ‘he may have to operate. The exhibition is often- 
amusing enough to a disinterested spectator. ‘The party whose 
conscience is to undergo the ordeal of a public serutiny, may 
be seen seated by his attorney ; his countenance at first glow- 
ing with a defensive smirk of self- “complacent defiance, but 
manifesting, as the investigation into his candor and veracity 
proceeds, the most marvellous varieties of hue and expression. 
An inconsistency or two are pointed out, and his smile of. an- 
ticipated triamph gradually degenerates into a sib-acid sneer. 
A fraudulent suppression is next put up, and then he begins to 
look at his attorney; and, finding no refuge there, -to look 
very grave. The counsel proceeds, inexorably accurate in his 
detections, and caustic in his comments. Our worthy deponent 
. begins now to tremble for his reputation, and not. without - 
_ reason; for down come upon it a succession of mortal blows, 
. every one of which the listening crowd, who desire no better 
sport, pronounce, by a malignant buzz, to have been “a palpa- 
ble hit.” This quickly brings on the final stage. Our hero, 
“according to the very best of his knowledge, information, 
and belief,” is mortified and wrathful in the extreme. Ho 
starts and frowns and shifts his posture, and compresses his 
lips, and clenches his fists: he would give worlds (so at least 
says his eye; and I would believe it as soon as. his affidavit) 
to have just one blow at the head of his merciless torturer, or. 
to tell him in open court that he is a calumniator and an assas- 
sin. He is on the point of committing some extravagance, 
when his attorney throws in a word.or two of cool advice, to. *- 
prevent. his rage from boiling over, and the paroxysm gradu-

or in sotto-voce muimurings of impotent vituperation. +

order, murmurs have arisen, and questions been started as to 
what are or ought to be the privileges of a barrister, in arraign- 
ing the conduct and motives of the: parties to whom he is 
opposed. The irritated suitor of course exclaims against a 
license under which he has smarted, as an intolerable griev- 
ance, and in general finds many sutliciently disposed to join 
-in his indignation; but no disinterested person, acquainted 
with human nature as developed in the course of our legal 
proceedings, and cozsidering alone the ends of justice, can 
easily bring himself to desire that the privileges complained 
of should be in any way abridged. The law makes a counsel: 
personally responsible for any injurious observations upon the 
characters of individuals not warranted by his instructions ; 
and that those limits are seldom exceeded may be collected 
from the fact, that actions for slander of this description are 
unheard-of in practice. But if his instructions are manifestly 
libellous, is he not under a paramount moral obligation to 
suppress the obnoxious matter ? or is every just and honorable 
feeling of the gentleman to be merged in the conventional 
haracter of the barrister? The answer is:— A counsel can 
not tell whether his instructions be true or false; and though 
they should lean heavily upon an individual of previously 
unblemished reputation, he is not on that account to take it 
for granted that they are calumnious. 
It is a matter of daily experience, that litigation makes 
strange. discoveries “in the characters of men. Persons of un- 
suspected integrity no sooner become plaintiffs or defendants 
_ in a cause, than, blinded by self-interest, or inflamed with the 
silly desire of obtaining™a victory, they are found resorting to 
every knavish artifice to establish an unjust or resist an equi- 
table demand. - How, then, in any given case alleged to be of 
this description, can the counsel assure himself beforehand 
that the result will falsify his instructions? Is he, in defiance 
of them, to be incredulous and forbearing; and from his 
conjectural doubts and misgivings, to put forward a statement 
so tame and wary as to deprive his client of the benefit of that 
honest indignation in the court or jury, which the real facts 
of the case might justify ?

278 THOMAS WALLACE. 
“The present Chief- Justice Best* once said, in conversation, 
of a barrister: “That man is unfit to conduct a case at the 
Quarter Sessions: he believes what his client tells him.” 
There is equal. truth in the converse of the proposition. A 
sbarrister, who should make it a rule to act upon the disbelief 
of what his client télls him, would prove equally incompetent. 
Bat still, it is constantly urged, the privilege thus contended. 
for produces much unwarrantable vituperation: To this it may 
be replied, that custom has given to language a péculiar, qual- 
ified forensic sense, just as it has a Parliamentary one; and © 
that, thus understood, the invectives of counsel are purely- 
hypothetical, and go for. nothing, unless corroborated in proof. 
and sanctioned by averdict. If cleverly thrown off, they may 
. for the moment gratify the bystanders, or ruffle the temper of 
the party against whom they are directed— but they leave 
no stain upon his reputation, if twelve men upon their oaths - 
pronounce him to be an honest man. The “daggers” that a 
counsel “talks,” are merely weapons handed up to the jury- 
box: if any of them draw blood, the jury must strike the blow. 
And it may be further observed, that this latitude of ‘speech 
is indirectly of no small service to the ends of justice, by the 
terrors it holds out to persons who would have no compunction 
in speculating upon the ehances of fraudulent litigation, but 
are. sufficiently worldly and gensitive to shrink from a publi¢ 
and unrestrained exposure of their iniquity. 
In judging of an Irish barrister’s capacity for the higher 
orders of forensic eloquence, it is but just to remember, that

no doubt, a habit that prevails there of speéulating upon the 
effects that particular individuals would produce, were they 
-only supplied with opportunities commensurate with their 
powers. It was thus when the Queen’s case was raging, that 
thenational pride’ of the Irish bar broke out in vain regrets that 
one of their Crown officers, a man of ‘surpassing qualifications 
forthe conduct of such a cause, should not have been afforded 
such an opportunity of rising to the highést summit of what I 
may call the conjectural fame that he enjoyed in his profession. 
They pictured to themselves Charles Kendal Bushe, appearing 
at the bar of the House of Peers, as the presiding counsel for 
the Crown upon the trial of that imperial issue, and uniting 
to every solid requisite for the discharge of such a duty, a 
collection of peculiar attributes, that seemed as if expressly 
~ designed for swaying the decision of such a tribunal on such 
an occasion. They saw him there with his matured: profes- 
sional skill and chastened eloquence —his fine imposing pres- 
ence —his rich, sonorous voice — his masterly powers of coun- 
tenance, whether he spoke or listened —his profound, unre- 
mitting by-play, now refuting by an indignant start, now 
enforcing by a moral shitdder—his elevated courage, and nat- 
ural grace of gesture, tone, sentiment, and diction, in not one 
of which the most finished courtier of them all could have 
detected a provincialism. Considering all these, and the sub- 
‘ject, and the auditory, the admirers of this eminent and ac- 
complished person completed (and perhaps not unjustifiably) 
the ideal -pictute, by representing to themselves as the final 
issue, the torrent of popular indignation successfully stemmed, 
and the imperial diadem wrested from the brow of the royal 
defendant. 
‘A similar feeling prevailed among many with respéct to Mr. 
Wallace, upon the occasion of the only political case of any 
moment that has in latter years occurred in Ireland —the 
trial of the rioters at the Dublin theatre. It was one of the 
Singularities of that case, that the popular feeling was all on 
the: side of the prosecution, and that, with the exception of 
the-Attorney-General [Plunket], none of the counsel for the 
Crown were animated bya a warmer centiment than a determi-~

nation to perform an unwelcome duty. That duty the Solicitor- 
General [Joy], who spoke to the evidence, performed with 
legal ability and unquestioned integrity.. Noone could accuse 
him of the insidious suppression of any doctrine or argument 
that bore upon the case; but it was impossible for him to be 
eloquent. All his passions and prejudices were against his 
cause, and he had not the flexibility of temper to-assume a 
tone of indignant energy of which he was unconscious. Tt is, 
therefore, easy to account for the general wish that such 3 man 
as Mr. Wallace had supplied his place. He would not have 
allowed himself to have been’ entrammelled by any personal 
or official restraints, but, giving the fullest scope to all his : 
powers, and superadding his authoritative denunciations as 
an individual to his invectives as an advocate, would have 
the jury feel (and this was what was wanted) that they were 
themselves upon their trial, and must be held by the public to 
be aceomplices in the factious proceeding against which they- 
should hesitate to pronounce a verdict of conviction. 
The personal determination of character and practical effi- 
ciency of talent for which Mr. Wallace is so distinguished, 
have been confined ‘almost exclusively to his professional exer-- 
tions ; but the mention of those qualities brings to my recol- 
lection one rather memorable occasion upon which they were 
‘ealled into action, and with a suddenness of result that can ~ 
not be duly appreciated by any who were not actual witnesses 
of the scene. In the beginning of the year 1819, the friends 
of the Catholic cause, considering that the time had arrived 
when the sense of the Protestant inhabitants of the Trish 
metropolis might be safely taken upon their question, deter-_ 
mined, after much anxious deliberation, that a public meeting 
of that portion of the community should be convened for the 
purpose of recording their sentiments in the form of a petition 
to Parliament for Emancipation. Though pretty confident of 
success, they foresaw that the Orange faction would rise en 
masse, to interpose every kind of obstruction to so new and 
obnoxious an experiment. To prevent this, or, at the worst, 
to be -prepared for it, preliminary measures were taken for 
giving the proposed, assemblage every possible degree of
-P-A-G-E-282

popular, and even n of aristocratic eclat. The attendance of the 
Duke of Leinster and several other peers was secured. The 
naine of Grattan stood at’ the head of a list of patriotic com- 
moners. To these were added some leading men from the Bar, 
and many persons of opulence and weight from the commercial 
classes. 
Such a mass of respectability, it was hoped, would protect 
the meeting from any factious obstruction; but among the 
precautionary arrangements, there was one conspicuous noy- 
elty that inevitably provoked it. The Lord-Mayor of Dublin 
(Alderman M‘Kenny*), with a courage that did him infinite 
honor, consented to call the meeting, and take the chair, . "The 
Rotunda was fixed upon’ as the most convenient place for 
assembling; and it had the farther attraction of being, from 
its associations with the memory of the old volunteers of Ire- 
land, a kind of consecrated ground for civil purposes: But 
the offence was commensurate. That achief magistrate of the 
city of Dublin, the corporation’s “own anointed,” should be 
so lost to all sense of monopoly and intolerance, as to give 
the sanction of his presence at such a place, on such an occa- 
sion, was an innovation of too perilous example to pass 
unpunished. The aldermanic body quivered with indigna- 
” tion; the Common Council foamed with no common rage; the 
corporate sensibilities of the minor guilds burst forth in vows 
and projects of active vengeance. Before the appointed day 
arrived, it was matter of notoriety in Dublin, that a formidable 
plan of counteraction had been matured, and was to be put 
into execution. 
- On the morning of the meeting, some of the principal requi- 
sitionists assembled at Charlemont house to.make thenecessary 
arrangements for the business of the day. They continued 
there until it was announced that the Lord-Mayor had arrived, 
and was ready to take the chair, when they proceeded through 
the adjoining gardens of Rutland square, toward one of the 
back-entrances of the Rotunda. There was something pecu- 
Hiarly dispiriting in their appearance, as they slowly and

silently wound along the narrow walks, more like a funeral 
‘procession than a body of.men proceeding to bear 4 part in 
a patriotic ceremony; but every sentiment of popular ardor 
was chilled by the apprehension that an effort, from which the 
most beneficial results had been anticipated, might terminate 
ina scene of disgraceful tumult. 
Even the presence of Grattan, who was in the midst of them, 
had. lost its old inspiring influence. His name, his figure, his 
venerable historic features, his very dress—a threadbare blue 
_ surtout, of the old Whig-elub uniform, buttoned closely ‘up to 
the chin,.and giving him something of the air of a veteran 
warrior: all these recalled the great national scenes with 
which his genius and fame were identified. But the more 
vivid the recollection, the more powerful the present contrast. 
The despondency of age and of declining health had rested 
upon his countenance. Instead of the rapid and impatient 
movements with which, in the days of his pride and strength, 
he had been wont to advance to the contest, launching de- 
fiance from his eye, and unconsciously muttering to himself, 
ashe paced along, some fragments of his impending. har- 
angue, all was now tardiness, and silence, and quietude, even 
to collapse. . 
As they approached the building, the cheerings of the multi- 
tude within burst forth through the open windows. The well- 
known sound for a moment roused the veteran orator; but 
the impression was evanescent. There was no want of excite- - 
ment in the spectacle within. Upon entering the grand room 
of the Rotunda, they found about four thousand persons, the 
majority of them red-hot Ivish politicians, congregated within 
its walls. The group I have described made their way to the 
taised platform, upon which the Lord-Mayor had just taken 
the chair, and where a vacant space upon his right had been 
reserved for them. The left was occupied by a detacliment 
from the: Corporation, headed by a formidable Alderman. 
The Lord-Mayor opened the business of the day by reading 
the requisition, and explaining his reasons for having called 
the meeting. ‘Murmurs on the left,” in the midst of which 
up rose the leader of the civic host to commence the precon--

certed plan ‘of operations. Without preface or apology, he 
called upoi the chairman to dissolve the meeting. He cau- 
tioned him, as the preserver of the public peace, not to perse- 
vere in a proceeding so pregnant with dangers to the tranquil- 
lity of the city. Let him only look.at the assemblage before 
him, which had been most unadvisedly brought together under 
the sanction of his name, and reflect, before it was too late, 
upon the frightful consequences that must ensue, when their 
passions should come to be heated by the discussions of topics 
of the most irtitating nature. Was it for this that the loyal 
citizens of Dublin had raised him to his present high trust? Was 
it to preside over scenes of riot, perhaps of: ”* Here the 
worthy alderman was interrupted, according to his expecta- 
tions, by tumultuous cries “to order.” A friend from the left 
rushed forward to sustain him; a member of the opposite 
party jumped upon the platform to call im to order, and was 
in his turn called to order by a corporator. 
Thus it continued until half a.dozen questions of order were 
at once before the chair, and as many persons simultaneously 
bellowing forth their respective rights to an exclusive hearing. 
To put an end to the confusion, the chairman consented to 
take the sense of the meeting on a motion for an adjournment, 
and having put the question, declared (as was the fact) that 
an immense. majority of voices was against it. This was de- 
nied by the left side, who insisted that regular tellers should 
be appointed. A proposition, at once so unnecessary and im- 
practicable, revealed their real object, and was received with 
bursts of indignation; but they persevered, and a scene of ter- 
rific uproar ensued. It continued so loud and long, that those 
who surrounded the chair became seriously alarmed for the 
result. They saw before them four thousand persons, inflamed 
by passion, and immured within a space from which a speedy - 
exit was impossible. In ‘addition to the general excitation, 
violent altercations between individuals were already commen- 
cing in remoter. quarters of the meeting, and if a single blow 
should be struck, the day must. inevitably terminate in blood- 
shed. : 
At this moment, when the tumult was at its height, two fig-

ures. particularly attracted attention;—the first. from its in- 
trinsic singularity—it was that of a noted city brawler (his 
name I now forget) who had contrived ‘to perch himseif aloft 
upon a kind of elevated scaffolding that projected from the 
loyal corner of the platform. He was a short, sturdy, half- 
dwarfish, ominous-looking caitiff, with those peculiar propor- 
tions, as to both person and features, which, without being 
actually deformed, seem barely to have escaped deformity: 
There was a certain extra-natural lumpish confirmation about 
his neck and shoulders, which gave the idea that the materials . 
composing them must have been originally intended for a 
hump; while his face was of that specific, yet non-deseript 
" kind, which is vulgarly called a phiz— broad, flat, and sal- 
low, with. glaring eyes, pug-nose, thickish lips, and around 
them a circle of jet-black (marking the region of the beard) 
which neither razor nor soap could efface. 
The demeanor of this phenomenon, who brandished a crab- 
stick as notorious in Dublin as himself, and-wore his hat with 
its narrow upturned brim inclined to one side (the Irish sym- 
bol of being ready for a row) was so impudent and grotesque 
as to procure for him at intervals the undivided notize of the 
assembly. His corporation friends let fly a jest. at him, and 
were answered by a grin from ear to ear. This wag sure to 
be followed by a compact full-bodied hiss from another quar- 
ter of the meeting, and instantaneous was the transition in his - 
countenance, from an expression of buffoonish archness to one 
of almost maniacal ferocity. This “ comical miscreant,”* con- 
temptible as he would have been for any other purpose, proved 
a most effective contributor to the scene’ of general: disturb-' 
ance. Apart, at the opposite extremity of the platform; in 
view of this portent, and exposed to his grimaces and.ribald 
vociferations, sat Henry Grattan, a silent and dejected. spec- 
tator of the turmoil that raged around him. The contrast was 
at once striking and afflicting, presenting, as it were, a visible

type of the condition of his country, in the triumpli of vulgar 
. and fanatical.clamoy over all the efforts of a long life, exelu: ‘ sively devoted to her redemption. 
But to resume: —The confusion continued, and the symp: 
toms of impending riot were becoming momentatily more 
alarming, when Mr. Wallace (to whom it is full time to return) 
had the merit of averting such a crisis. In a short interval 
of diminished uproar, one of the most prominent of the dis- 
turbers was again on his legs, and recommencing, for the tenth 
or twentieth time, a disorderly address to the chair; when Mr. 
Wallace, who had not previously interfered, started ‘up from. 
his seat beside the chairman, advanced toward the speaker, 
and called Aim to order. The act itself was nothing —the 
tone and manner everything. There was in the latter a stern, 
determined, almost terrific energy, which commanded imme- 
diate and universal silence. In a few brief sentences, he de- 
nounced the palpable design that had been formed to obstruct 
the proceedings, exposed the illegal and indecent artifices that 
had been resorted to, and insisted that the parties who were 
dissatisfied with the decision of the chair on the question of 
adjournment, should forthwith conform to the established usage 
-in such cases, and leave the room. The voice of authority, 
and something more, in which this was said, produced the de- 
sired effect. The multitude shouted forth their approbation. 
The civic chieftain, after performing astonishing feats of 
aldermanship, judged’ it prudent to retire without a’ further 
struggle. He was followed by his corps of discontents, about 
fifty in number, and the business of the day, after a suspen- 
sion of two hours, proceeded without interruption. 
Mr. Wallace is one among the few of the present leading 
men at the Irish Bar, who have dedicated much time to liter- 
ary pursuits. His general reading is understood to be various 
and extensive. In the year 1796, two years before he was 
called to the Bar, he composed an essay on the variations, in 
the prose style of the English language, from the period of the. 
Revolution, which obtained the gold medal prize of the Royal 
Irish Academy: It is written with much elegance, is entirely 
free from juvenile or national finery, and bears evident marks
-P-A-G-E-287
286 ‘ THOMAS WALLAOE. 
of those powers of discrimination which were afterward to pro-- 
cure for the possessor more substantial results than academic . 
honors. In the same year he published a treatise of consider- 
able length upon the manufactures of Ireland. The latter I~ 
have never seen, but I have heard an anecdote regarding it 
which may be mentioned as illustrative of the purity with 
which Irish academic justice was in those days administered. 
It was originally composed, like the former, as a prize-essay. 
The academy hesitated between it and the rival production 
of one of their members, a Mr. Preston, and referred the decis- 
ion to a committee. The committee deputed the task to a. 
sub-committee, and the Jatter to three persons, of whom: Mr. 
Preston was one. The prize was accordingly adjudged to ~ 
that gentleman's production, and Mr. Wallace revenged him: 
self of the academy by publishing his work, and prefixing to 
it a detailed account of the transaction. 
In concluding my notice of this able person, I have only 
to add, that if he should ever enter Parliament, it may 
be. safely predicted that’ his career there will be neither 
“mute” nor “inglorious.” His manliness, integrity, and de- 
termination, as well as his general talents, would be soon found 
out in that assembly, and insure him upon all occasions:a re- 
spectful hearing. The enlightened portion ofthe Irish admin- 
istration would find in him a strenuous supporter of no ordinary 
value; and the country at large (independently of the benefit 
of his other exertions) would have a security that no hackney- 
ed and scandalous misrepresentations of its condition, no matter 
from whose lips they might come, would be allowed to pass 
in his presence without peremptory contradiction and rebuke.

exhibited a perfect keeping between the understanding of the 
writer and his heart: they smelt of a lamp which was fed with. 
rancid oil. The present Archbishop of Dublint had been the 
competitor of Elrington for the first station of the University. 
' His eminent abilities gave him in his own opinion, and I . 
should add, in the judgment of the University, a paramount 
claim, ~ But at that time he had the plague-spot of ‘liberality 
in his character. The stain has been since effaced, but it was 
still apparent when he presented himself to the Minister. 
Doctor Magee used to give a somewhat amusing account 
of his reception by the flippaht personage who was then at the 
head of the State. He threw out some broad hints as to the

of Dublin in 1822. His chief literary work, published in 1801, was on the 
subject of The Atonement—on this, which obtained great popularity, he at- - 
tacked Unitarianism with Orthodox zeal, acuteness, and learning. He became .

origin. How much such men are wanted in these’ dangerous 
times !”* The mistake made by the Minister in’ pronouncing — 
the naing of his successful rival (which he hardly knew), pro-

eal Society, and issued a proclamation against witcheraft. 
Special orders were given by the Doctor against the raising 
of the Devil. The library of Trinity College is filled with 
hooks of necromancy; and, apprehending that the students 
might be reduced into a commerce with the-Fiend, the Doctor 
gaye peremptory directions, that the ponderous and worm- 
eaten repertories of the Black art should not be unclasped. A 
scholar of the house, who appears to’have had a peculiar predi- 
lection for the occult sciences, complained of the restraint which 
the Doctor had taken upon himself to put upon his intercourse 
_ with the “ Prince of the Air,” and called the former to account 
. in a visitation, at which Lord Chief-Justice Downes (not very 
appropriately) presided, as the representative of His Royal 
Highness the Duke of Cumberland.* I do not recollect the 
decision of his Lordship | upon this important question, but, if I 
may be allowed to conjecture from his intellectual habits, I 
can not help suspecting that any appeal to the statutes of 
James J. must have been conclusive, in his mind, in favor of 
the injunction against sorcery. Shortly after this exploit 
against the Devil, the Doctor was raised to the see of Limerick, 
and upon the detection of his sanctimonious and detestable 
predecessor,t he was promoted to the bishopric of Clogher. He 
resides in a noble palace, which arrests the attention of the 
traveller in his way to Wexford, and affords an illustration of 
that apostolic poverty, in which the teachers of the reformed 
religion embody its holy precepts.

THE OLD MONASTERY. 291 
- By a recent order of vestry (at which Catholics are not per- 
mitted to vote), a tax was laid on’ the inhabitants for the 
erection of a new church upon the site of the monastic ruin. 
Upon entering Wexford I missed a portion of the old build- 
ing. I walked. into its ‘precincts, and found that some of 
the venerable arches of the ancient edifice had been thrown 
down, to.make way for the modern structure. .The work of 
devastation had been going on. among the residences of the 
dead: A churchyard encompasses these remains of Christian 
antiquity ; and I observed that many a grave had been torn 
up, in order to make a foundation for the new Protestant 
church. The masons who had been at work the preceding ~ 
day, had left some of their implements behind them. To 
behold the line and the trowe] in the grave, would be at any 
time a painful spectacle; but this violation of the departed — 
becomes exasperating to our passions, as well as offensive to 
our religious sentiments, when it is occasioned by an invasion 
of the ancient and proper demesne of the almost universal 
faith of the people. Fragments of white bones had been 
thrown up, and lay mingled with black mould upon the green 
hillocks of the adjoining dead. “Why should not that be 
the skull of an Abbot?” I exclaimed, as I observed the frag- - 
ments of a huge head which had been recently cast up: “little 
did he think, that, in the very sanctuary of his monastic splen- 
dor, he should ever be ‘twitched about the sconce’ by a rude 
heretical knave, and that a Protestant shovel should deal such 
profanation upon a head so deeply stored with the | subtilties. of 
Scotus, and. the mysteries of Aquinas! lad 
After passing some minutes in “chewing the cud of these 
bitter fancies,” I became weary of my meditations among the 
dead, and strolled toward the Quay of Wexford, upon which 
both church and chapel had poured out all their promiscuous 
contents. Here was a large gathering of young damsels, who, _ 
after having gone through their spiritual duties, came to per- 
form the temporal exercises of an Irish Sabbath. There was 
a great display of Wexfordian finery. The women of Wexford 
of the better class have, in general a passion for dress, to which 
I have heard that they sacrifice many of their domestic com-

forts. This little town is remarkable for a strange effort at 
: saving and display. It is not uncommon to see ladies, who 
reside in small and indifferently furnished lodgings, issuing 
from dark and contracted Ianes in all the splendor which mil- 
linery can supply. This tendency to extravagance in dress is 
the less excusable, because .Nature has done,so much for their 
~ faces and persons, as to render superfluous the efforts of Art. 
The lower, as well as higher classes, are conspicuous for beauty. 
Theré are two baronies in this county, in one.of-which the 
town is situate, the inhabitants of. which are descended from a 
colony planted by the first English settlers, who never having 
intermingled their blood with the coarser material of the coun- 
try, have retained a perfectly characteristic physiognomy, and 
may be. distinguished at a glance from the population of the 
adjoining districts. The Trish face, although full of shrewd- 
ness and vivacity, is deficient in proportion and grace.. Before 
you arrive in Wexford, in traversing the craggy hills which 
overhang it, you meet with countenances at every step, which 
are marked by a rade’ energy atid a barbarous strength. 
Through the clouds of smoke that roll from the doors of a 
hovel of mud, you may observe the face of many an Hibernian 
damsel, glowing with a ruddy and. almost too’ vigorous health, 
made up of features whose rudeness is redeemed by their flex- 
ibility and animation, with eyes full of mockery and of will, and 
lips that seem ‘to provoke to an.encounter in pleasantry, for 
which they are always prepared. The dress of the genuine 
Irish fair is just sufficient to.conceal the more sacred of their 
symmetries, but leaves the greater portion of their persons in a 
state of brawny and formidable nudity. But when you de- 
scend from the hills to- the eastern coast, you are immediately 
_struck with a total dissimilarity of look, and can not, fail to 
notice’a peculiarly English aspect. 
Tam disposed to think the young women of the lower class 
in the baronies of Forth and Bargy, even more graceful and 
feminine than the most lively of the English peasantry, whom 
I have ever had occasion to notice. Their eyes are of deep 
and tender blue, their foreheads are high and smooth, their 
cheeks have a clear transparent color, and a sweetness of

expression sits: on n their” fall fresh lips, which is united with 
perfedt niodesty, and réndets them objects of pure and respect- 
ful’ interest. They take a special eare of their persons, and 
exhibit that tidiness “and vieatness in their attire, for which 
their English kindied are remarkable. I have often stopped 
t6 obséive a gitl from the barony of Forth, in the market of 
‘ Wexford,-with her basket of eggs or chickens for sale, and 
wished that I-were'an artist, in order that I might preserve 
her fate and figure: ‘Her, bonnet of bright-and_well- -plaited 
straw just permitted. a. few bright ringlets to escape upon her 
oval cheek? o¥er her head’ was thrown a kerchief of muslin to 
protect hi complexion from thé stin.. Her cloak of blue | cloth, 
trimmed with gray ‘silk, hug gracefully from’ her shoulders, 
Her boddice was tiglitly laced round a graceful and symmetri- 
cal person. Her‘feet were compressed in smart and well- 
polished shoes; and as she held out her basket to allure you 
into a purchase of her commodities, her smile, with all its win- 
ningness, was still so pure, that you did not dare to wish that 
- she should herself be thrown into the bargain. | 
It is clear that the peasantry of these districts are a superior 
and better-ordered tribe. Industry and morality prevail among 
them. Orime is almost unknown in the baronies of Forth and 
Bargy. The English reader will probably imagine that they 
must be Protestants. On the contrary, the Roman Catholic 
religion is their only creed, and all efforts at proselytism have 
wholly failed. It has often been considered as singular that 
the Irish rebellion should have raged with such fiercene’s 
among this moral’ and pacifie peasantry. Some are disposed 
to refer the intensity of their political feelings to their attach- 
-ment to the Catholic religion; but I believe that the main 
cause of the temporary ferocity into which they were excited, 
and in the indulgence of which, they for a while threw off all 
their former habits, had its origin from the excesses of which a 
lige mtious soldiery were guilty, and that the dishonor of their

matters which are in themselves somewhat unlinked together. 
While I was wandering up and down the quay of Wexford, 
and,after having fed my eyes to satiety, was beginning to yield 
to the spirit of oscitation which is apt to creep upon a lawyer 
on the sabbath, a gentleman had the goodness to invite me to 
accompany him up the river Slaney, to a fine wood upon the 
banks of ‘the stream, where he proposed that his party should - 
dine upon the refreshtnents with which his barge was copiously 
stored: I gladly took advantag’ of this very polite invitation ; 
the wind was favorable, and wafted us along the smooth and 
glassy stream with a rapid and delightful motion. The banks 
are remarkable for their beauty. On the righthand, as you 
proceed up the river, the seat of the La Hunt family offers a 
series of acclivities covered with thick and venerable wood. 
The temperature of the air is so soft, and the aspect so much 
open to the mid-day sun, that shrubs which are proper to south- 
ern latitudes grow in abundance in these noble plantations. 
: At every turn of the stream, which winds in a sheet of silver 
‘ through @ cultivated valley, landscapes worthy of the pencil 
of Gainsborough or of Wilson are disclosed. Castles, old 
Danish forts, the ruins of monasteries, and, I should add, the 
falling halls of absentees, appear in a long succession upon both 
sides of the stream. 
I was a good deal struck with a little nook, in which a beau- 
tiful cottage rose out of green trees, and asked who was the 
proprietor. It had been built, it seems, by Sir H. Bate Dud- _ 
ley, the former proprietor of the “Morning Herald,” who re- 
sided for some time upon a living given to him in this diocese. 
Iwas informed that he was respected by all classes, and be- 
loved by the poor.* His departure was greatly regretted. 
Not far from Sir H. Bate Dudley’s cottage is the residence of 
Mr. Devereux, of Carrick Nana. He is said to be descended

to one of the most ancient families in Ireland. The political 
race of this gentleman is so honorably ardent, that he has gone 
_to the expense of. collecting: portraits of all the parliamentary 
friends of Emancipation, and devoted a gallery to the purpose. 
After, passing his seat, we saw Mount Leinster, towering in. 
all its. glory before us,,with the sun descending upon its peak. 
Having reached the point of our destination, we landed in a 
deep and tangled. wood, and _Sat down to dinner in a cave 
which overhangs the stream. While we were sitting in this 
spot, which’ I may justly call a romantic one, a sweet voice 
rose from the banks beneath, in the music of a melancholy air. 
It was what I once heard a poor harper call “a lonesome air.” ” 
I do not know whether certain potations compounded of a liquor 
which, in our love of the figurative, we have called “ mountain. 
dew,” might not have added to the inspiration of the melody. 
When it ceased; we proceeded to discover the fair vocalist who 
had uttered such dulcet notes, and whom one of us compared. 
to the lady in “ Comus.” What was our disappoimtment, when, 
upon approaching the spot from which the music had procéed- 
ed, we found an ‘assembly of sabbatarian wassailers, who gave 
vent to a loud and honest laugh as we arrived! The echoes 
took up their boisterous merriment, which reverberated through 
the woods and-hills. ‘The songstress who had so enchanted us 
wasgjttle better than a peasant-girl. 
These good people, who were sitting in-a circle round a huge 
jug of punch, had resolved to participate in the beauty of Na- 
ture, of which we are all tenants in common, and, like ourselves, 
had royed out from the town to dine in the wood. They en- 
tered their boat at the same’ time that we pushed off from the © 
bank, and accompanied us. It-was now evening. The broad 
water was without a ripple. The sun had gone down ‘behind 
Mount Leinster, and a rich vermilion was spread over the vast 
range of Jofty and. precipitous hills that bound the western, 
horizon. The night was advancing from the east, toward which 
our boats‘were rapidly gliding. The woods which hang upon 
the banks, had thrown their broad shadows across the stream. 
We reached: the narrow pass where the remains of a palace of’ -

King John, which is still called “ Shaun’s Court,” stand upon

. bank, This was the first hold raised by the English -upon 
their landing. It is built on a rock, and ‘commands the. gorge 
in which the Slaney is at this. point narrowly compressed. 
While our barge was carried along the dark water,.the fair 
vocalist, who was in the other boat, was prevailed upon to sing 
an Irish melody: our oars were suspended. Without any 
knowledge of music, she. possested a fine voice, and was not 
destitute of feeling. She selected an old Irish air, to which 
Moore has appropriately allied the misfortunes of Ireland. 
Wexford is the birthplace of the poet;* and as his beautiful 
words passed over the waters, I could not avoid thinking that 
'- in his boyhood he must often have lingered amidst the hills 
which surrounded us, in which-the liveliness of Nature is asso- 
ciated with so many national recollections. Jt is not impossi- 
‘ble that his mind may have taken its first tinge from these. 
. scenes, which it is difficult for even an ordinary person.to com 
template without a mournful emotion. The enchanting melan- 
choly, of the air, which is commonly called “ The Coulin,” and 
which was sweetly and inartificially sung, went deeply into 
dur: hearts.t ‘The impression left by the poetry and the music, - 
which were so well. assisted by a beautiful locality, did not 
soon pass away. . . 
While our spirits were still under the influence of the fggl- 
ings which had been called forth by these simple means, the 
lights of the town of. Wexford were descried. As wé ap- 
proached, I perceived the arches of the bridge, which stretches 
its crazy length from the town to the opposite side of the river. 
It was upon that bridge that the infuriated insurgents, upon 
becoming masters of Wexford, collected their prisoners, and 
murdered them in what I was. going to call cold blood: but the

phrase would: be an inappropriate one. The passions of the 
"people, which had been heated to the utmost intensity in the 
course of that frightfnl contest, had not lost their rage at the 
time that. they were guilty of that terrific slaughter. - — 
A'gentleman who sat by my side had attested most of the 
events to which Iam ‘alluding. As we neared the memorial 
of that horrible event (for the bridge of Wexford has almost 
become impassable, and scarcely serves any other purpose than 
that of preserving the recollection of the sanguinary misdeeds 
enacted upon it), I inquired the details of the massacre... He 
told.me that.somé ninety persons, of both sexes, were ‘placed 
by the rebels upon the bridge; that their fate was intimated 
to them; and that they were desired to prepare for death. 
The Catholic clergy interposed, without effect. The insurgents 
were bent upon revenge for the wrongs which most of them had 
individually sustained, and ferociously appealed to the blood 
upon their own doors in vindication of what they had resolved 
to perpetrate. - Their unfortunate victims fell upon their knees, 
and cried out for mercy. “ You showed it not to our children,” 
‘was the answer; and.to such an answer no replication can be - 
given in a civil war. At the appointed moment, the gates of 
the bridge were thrown open, and the work of death was al- 
moat instantaneously completed. 
‘We had now approached sufficiently near the bridge to per- 
ceive. its mouldering timbers.with distinctness, and to hear-the 
plash of the waters against its rotten planks. I am not guilty 
of any affectation when I say that the sound was peculiarly 
dismal. The continuous dash of the wave at all times (what- 
ever be the cause, and I leave it to metaphysicians to assign 
it) disposes the mind to a mournful mood. Perhaps it is that 
the rush of water, of which we are warned by its momentary 
interruption, suggests the ideas of transitoriness, and presents 
“an image of the ficeting quality of our existence. But there 
was something in the sound of the river, as it broke upon the 
piles of-decayed and bending timber that ‘sustain the bridge 
of. Wexford, of a peculiarly melancholy and more than -com-' 
monplace kind. I could not help thinking, as I surveyed — 
” decayed but still enduring fabric (why does not the tide

it into the sea), that upon those shattered boards, and weed- 
mantled planks, there had been many a wretch who clung with 
a desperate tenacity for a little longer life, until a thrust of 
the insurgent’s pike loosened the grasp of agony, and the 
corpse, after whirling for a moment in the eddies beneath, was 
wafted into the ocean, and became the sea-bird’s ‘perch. 
Such were the feelings with which I could not help looking 
upon this memorial of the shame and disasters of my country. 
A few days after, there occurred in this very spot a scene 
which tended rather to rivet than to weaken the political inter- 
est with which the bridge of Wexford ought to be surveyed. | 
Mr. O’Connell was brought as special counsel to. Wexford :. 
the people determined to pay him all the honors which it was 
in their power to bestow. , 
It was decided that an aquatic procession, if I ‘may use the 
phrase, should meet him at Fitzstephen’s Tower, and that he 
should be attended by the citizens from the ground where the 
English ‘had fixed the foundations of their dominion. The 
Counsellor was accordingly met, at the pass which I have de- 
scribed, by a fleet of boats, and-was forced to step into a trium’ 
phal barge, manned by the choicest rowers that could be procured. 
They were dressed in green jackets lined with gold. <A large 
flag of the same emblematical color, with a harp without a 
crown, floated from the stern. An immense multitude were 
assembled upon thé banks, and a vast number of boats crowd- 
ed the river. The Counsellor entered the patriotic barge with 
a show of reluctance, and took his seat. Three cheers were 
given. 
" 4 Considunt rastris ; intentaque brachia remis : 
Intenti expectant signum, exsultantiaque haurit 
Corda pavor pulsang, loudumque onesta cupido. 
Inde, ubi clara dedit sonitum tuba, finibus omnes 
Haud mord, prosiluére suis: ferit ethera clamor 
Nauticus: adductis spumant freta versa lacertis.” 
The spectacle exhibited in Wexford upon this occasion was 
a striking one. The whole Catholic population poured forth 
*- —seet Mr. O’Connell, and thousands gathered upon the quay 
bridge of Wexford to hail his arrival. The Protestants,-

who find in every incident of this kind an association with the - 
“events of 1798, stood with an expression of deep and angry ’ 
gloom in the. midst of all the turbulent exultation of their 
Popish fellow-citizens. I observed groups of silent and scowl- 
ing men, whose physiognomies did not permit me to doubt 
their religion. They muttered a few words to each other, and 
seémed to gripe their hands as if they felt the yeoman’s sabre 
already in their grasp. The Catholics were either heedless 
of théir anger, or derided its impotence. They were assem- 
bled in vast numbers-upon the bridge, which tottered beneath 
their weight. At length the Uounsellor’s barge came in sight. 
A chéer followed every stroke of the oar, and at length he 
reached the point selected for his reception in the city, and 
stepped from his barge upon the bridge, which, I suppose, in 
the eyes of the Protestant portion of the spectators, grew red 
beneath his footsteps. In their disturbed imaginations every 
footprint was marked with blood. . ‘ 
The assizes opened upon Tuesday, the 19th'July, 1825. 
The judges were the Chief-Justice of the King’s Bench, and 
' Mr. Justice Johnson, judge of the Court of Common Pleas. The 
former regularly goes the Leinster circuit; some of his imme- 
diate friends and kindred are upon it. Charles is the name 
of the Chief-Justice, and the constellated lights, by which he 
~ is surrounded, have been called his “wain.” It is natural 
that a feeling of disrelish for this undeviatirg adherence to 
Leinster should exist at the Bar, and it is equally natural that 
Chief-Justice Bushe should disregard it. ‘The ancient resi- 
dence of his family (which settled in Ireland in the reign of 
Charles the Second) is situate in the county of Kilkenny.- It 
is for many reasons most dear to him. His attachment to his 
domestic spot does not arise from a mere idle pride of honora- 
ble birth, but takes its origin in a most noble action. Although 
not bound to do so, he sold his paternal property to pay his 
~ father’s debts, repurchased it with the profits of his industry 
-and. hia genius, and now holds the estate of his forefathers by 
a better title than descent.

One of his best pictures hangs over the chimney of the prin- 
cipal room at Kilmurry (the seat of the Chief-Justice) and 
appropriately yepresents Sterne’s story of “The Sword.” The 
subject was felicitously chosen.* ‘It is impossible that the 
Chief-Justice should not feel a strong attachment to a mansion 
which affords an evidence at once of his genius and of his vi 
tues; and it would be strange if he did not exercise the. priv- 
ilege of selection which belongs to, his judicial rank in favor 
of a circuit upon which his own Property is situate, in almost 
"immediate contiguity to every town in which it is his office to 
preside. It is also to be obseryed, that in Kilkenny he is en- 
compassed by his own near associates and friends; and it-is 
but a just indulgence in a sentiment of virtuous pride, that he 
should desire to exercise his high functions among those who 
experience an unaffected pleasure at witnessing the elevation , 
which he has attained. ; 
With respect to the imputed charge of favoritism, the per- 
sons who are most disposed to find fault with this eminent in- 
dividual, can not point out any specific instance in which, 
from a partiality to.the advocate he has manifested the least 
bias foward the client; and if suitors, upon a calculation of the 
. genéral frailty. of our nature, should indulge in the hope.that 
the leaning of the judge is to be secured. by employing the 
supposed object of his predilection, it were too much to expect 
that he should offer a homage, to guspicion, and, by giving 
way~to it, yield to a certain extent an acquiescence in its jus- 
tice. For my own part, I am not at all disposed to. attach. 
blame to him for persevering in his uniform adoption of their 
same circuit, as long as judges are permitted by the Jaw to do 
80. Why should a peculiar exception be made against him? 
Other judges’ ¢ ate equally constant. in their local Hkings, and 
yet no complaints are Taade against them.

In England, too, judges are in the habit of going the same 
circuit without incurring the popular displeasure. While the 
law-stands as it does,'no complaint can justly be made of any. 
individual for consulting his own convenience in these regards. 
It. might, however, be matter for consideration, whether the: 
statute which prevented judges from presiding in their own 
counties, ought not to.be re-enactéd. ‘That statute which was 
repealed in Ireland, at:the instance, it is said, of the ex-Judge 
Day,* who-was fond of, the picturesque, and wishing: to visit 
the Lakes of. Killarney twice, a-year,, expressed’ a. solicitude to 
preside at the.assizes of Kerry Such a wish, when the Union 
was in concoction, was not to be disregarded... How far itis 
contrary to public policy to allow of this perpetual return. of 
the same judge to the same circuit, admits of doubt... It is 
hard for a man.of the purest mind to divest himself of precon- 
ceptions, formed. by intimate and reiterated observation. .-A 
judge is apt to take local views where he contracts topical 
connections, and may consider it necessary to administer jus- 
‘tice with more rigor in districts with the habits of criminality 
of which he may have -acquired a peculiar intimacy, A 
stronger anxiety for the suppression of atrocities in his own 
immediate vicinage is almost. inevitable. Offences committed 
at.our own door appear not only more formidable, but, enor- 
mous. The blood’ spattered at our yery threshold, leaves be- 
hind it a deeper die. ., 
It is, however, but just to ‘add, that if there be: any judge, 
from whose constant attendance of the- Leinster circuit, not 
only no positive evil, but an actual benefit: arises, it is Charles 
Kendal Bushe. As far as my observation extends, he is per- 
feetly impartial. The rank or the religion of parties has no | 
sort of weight with him; and to every case, whatever may be 
the circumstances attending it, he gives an equal and un- 
biased hearing. His attention to the interests of the lower - 
orders, evinced by the extraordinary solicitude with which he 
investigates their rights in the trial of civil bill appeals, is 
above.all praise... It was formerly usual to, hear civil bills at 
the close of the assizes of Clonmel ; and the persons interested,

who, are almost always of the ‘humbler class, were kept in 
anxious and expensive attendance for a whole week upon the 
court. Poor creatures; whose very being was involved in the 
sesult of their appeals, were assembled in a dismal gathering 
in the town, and, before their causes were heard, had expended 
nearly the whole amount of the sum decreed against them, in 
awaiting the capricious pleasure of the judge to reverse the 
sentence of the inferior tribunal. When this branch of busi- 
‘ness was called on, the judge was generally impatient to leave 
the town, and: hurried with a careless precipitation through 
-matters which, however insignificant in the mind of the weal- 
_ ‘thiest suitor, were of permanent moment to the wretched peas- 
ants who flocked to the assizes for redress. The Chief-Justice 
has reformed those crying abuses, and devotes as much consid- 
eration to the trial of minor cases as to causes of the greatest 
magnitude. He has, by introducing this practice, which 
eould not have been’ established by him without a continued 
: selection of the circuit, conferred signal advantages upon the 
public. 
With respect to the interests of the Bar, although some of. 
his more immediate friends are supposed to derive a benefit 
from his countenance, it should be remembered, in the first 
place, that they are persons of high merit; and it should not 
be forgotten, that to every member of the Bar the Chief-Justice 
is go undeviatingly polite, that no individual can justly tax 
him with having done him any immediate wrong. I am much 
inclined to think, that there is great exaggeration in the esti- 
mate of those’ advantages supposed to arise from the favor of 
any judge; and even if I were disposed to accord in the opin- 
ion, that individuals can be indebted for any essential portion 
of their success to the influence of the judicial smile, the ac- 
complished manners, the ‘liberal and enlightened spirit, the 
‘ great endowments, and the. patient industry, of the Chief- 
Justice, would outweigh, in my mind, every inferior and per- 
sonal consideration.

is justly accounted one of the ablest men. in Ireland* The 
‘two brothers ate men of eminent talents, but wholly dissimilar 
in character.. The political writer is calm, ironical, biting, and

and vigorous; and while the one ‘shoots his finely- feathered 
arrows, the other whjrls about a massive and roughly-knotted 
club. He is warm and excitable, and effervesces in an instant. 
This suddenness has’ its origin in the goodness of his nature. 
If he suspects collusion or fraud, or gets the least hint of 
baseness. in any transaction, he immediately takes fire. In 
these moods of explosive honesty, there is something formida- 
ple to a person who does not know that the ebullitions of integ- 
rity subside as rapidly as they break out; and that, with all 
these indications of angry temperament, he is in reality a kind 
and tractable man. At the same time we must beware of wan- 
tonly provoking him. “Noli irritare leonem,” is a precept 
-which the contemplation of his countenance has sometimes 
recalled to me.* His deep voice that issues upon a hunter of

As a criminal judge, he is truly merciful and compassionate ;

No trial of any-very considerable i interest, except that of the 
action of Nusin against Wyse, which has been detailed in the 
English papers; occurred during the last assizes: but, in look- 
ing: over my diary, I find a sketch which I made at the time — 
iof.a.very important case, which was tried by Judge Johnson 
’ during .a preceding circuit, and-which it may gratify the. curi- 
osity of the English reader to have transcribed. I allude to 
the prosecution of Father Carroll, the Wexford. priest; who 
killed a child in a fit. of insanity, under circumstances which 
greatly excited the public attention.‘ - 
This unfortunate man, for'he deserves no harsher appella- 
tion, had from his childhood a strong predisposition to insanity. 
-Ttwas with great difficulty that he succeeded in obtaining ordi- 
mation... His aberrations from reason, before they amounted to 
actual madness, were connected with the subject of exorcism ; 
and. although: évery''person to whom he addressed his argu- 
ments in favor of the expulsion ‘of devils, smiled -at his extrav- 
agance, they still could not help-acknowledging that he ar gued

applications of various, passages in: the holy writings: were 
ingenious, however mistaken. It was in vain that Father Car- 
roll was told that the power of Satain ‘to’possess himself of 
human bodies ceased with the revelation of Christian. truth. 
He appealed to the Acts of the Apostles, and to incidents sub-

sequent to the death: of our Savior, to establish his favorite 
speculation. A. medical man,’ with whom he was intimate, 
perceived that the subject had-laid such a hold upon his natu- 
rally. excitable imagmation, that he resorted to.sedative med- 
icines, to avert the progress of an incipient malady to which 
he had an organic predisposition. As long as he followed his 
physician’s: advice, he abstained from any acts of a very ex- 
travagant nature; but unhappily, before the events took place 
which formed ‘the ground of a capital prosecution, he neg- 
lected ‘to take. his usual Preventives, and became utterly de- 
ranged. 
He. suddenly ‘fancied: himself endowed -with supernatural 
- authority. This fantastic notion-seized upon him in the midst 
of divine service; after the wild performance of which, he 
rushed into the public road that led from the chapel to his 
house, in search of an object for the manifestation of his mira- 
culous powers. He was‘informed that a laborer by the name 
of Neill was confined by illness to his bed; and being con- 
vineed that he was possessed by an evil spirit, proceeded to 
_ effect the removal of the enemy. His singular demeanor at- 
tracted the attention of the passengers, who followed him to 
Neill’s cottage; which he had no sooner entered than he pre- 
cipitated himself upon the sick man, and began his miraculous 
. operations with marvellous vigor. A severe pommelling was 
the process of exoreism which he regarded as most effectual. 
This he put into immediate and effectual practice. Neill did 
not atsempt to resist this athletic antagonist of the devil. The 
unbappy gentleman had determined to take Beelzebub by 
storm. After a long assault, he succeeded in this strange 
achievement, and having informed the astonished bystanders 
that he had taken the enemy prisoner, announced that he 
should give him no quarter, but plunge him into the Red Sea. 
The manner of this‘aquatic ceremony was described by one 
of the witnesses, who endeavored to illustrate it by his gesture. 
After-uttering various cabalistic words, he whirled himself in 
arapid rotation, with his.arms outstretched, and then, suddenly 
pausing, and raising ‘himself into an attitude of importance 
befitting his. new authority, advanced with one arm a-kimbo,

and with the other extended, looking, as the witness expressed 
- it, “as if he held the devil by the tail,” and marched with a 
measured pace and a mysterious aspect, to a bridge upon the 
river Slaney, where he buried the captive demon in what he 
took for the Red Sea. 
Not contented with this exploit, he exclaimed that Neill had 
seven more devils, which he was determined to expel from this 
peculiar object of diabolical predilection. The operation was 
accordingly repeated with such success, that Neill, after much _ 
strenuous expostulation, leaped out of his bed, and exclaimed 
that he was quite well. This circumstance produced. a deep 
impression upon the crowd, among whom there were some 
Protestants; and two of the latter, a Mrs. Winter and her 
. daugliter, knelt down, and called upon the Lord to assist. 
Father Carroll in the perpetration of the next miracle,.which, 
encouraged by their pious’sympathies, he almost immediately 
proceeded to commit. -A poor woman happened to pass along: 
the road, whom be had -no sooner observed than he knocked 
her down, and pursued a mode of exorcism similar to that 
which I have described, with such effect, that one of the spec- 
tators cried ont for the people to make way, “as he saw the 
devil coming out.” 
This achievément only” sérved to excite the wretched maniac, 
and impel him to another undertaking of the same kind. He 
insisted “that the devil had taken possession of Sinot’s child.” 
The cireumstances which I have detailed, and by no means 
endeavored to exaggerate, would be merely ridiculous if they 
were not the result of a malady which humbles human nature 3, 
the incident by which they were succeeded, ought to make 
Democritus shed tears. Sinot had a child who had been af: 
- fected by fits, and over whom the priest had been requested ° 
by its mother to Say prayers. This was not only a natural, 
but, I will add, a reasonable application. It is not supposed . 
by Roman: Catholics that the prayers of a clergyman are 
endowed with any preternatural efficacy ; but it is considered ~ 
that praying over the sick is a pious and religious act. The 
recollection of this fatal request passed across the distempered _ 
mind of the madman, who burried with an insane alacrity to

Sinot’s cabin. - It was composed of two rooms upon the ground 
floor; in the smaller of which lay the little victim. It was 
indeed so contracted, that it could not contain more than two 
or. three persons. The crowd who followed the priest remained 
outside, and were utterly unconscious of what he was about to 
do. The father of the child was notin the house when Father 
Carroll entered it, and was prevented by the pressure in the 
_ exterior room from approaching him; and for some time after 
the death of the child was wholly unconscious of what had 
taken place. 
No efforts whatever were made to prevent his interference. 
He was produced as a witness upon the trial, and swor8 that 
it did not enter into his thoughts that Father Carroll intended 
to do the child the least harm. He could not, he said, even 
see the priest. It is not necessary to describe the manner of 
the infant’s death. It is enough to say that, after uttering a few 
feeble cries, and calling upon its ““mammy,” every sound be- 
came extinct. The madman had placed the child under a 
tub, and life was extinguished. It may well be imagined that 
the trial of this case excited a strong sensation in the county 
where the rebellion had raged with its most dangerous fury, 
and from which it will be long before its recollections will have 
entirely passed away. The Protestant party, forgetting that 
many of their own sect had taken a partial share in the pro- 
“ceedings, of which they had. been, at all events, the passive 
witnesses, exhibited a proud and disdainful exultation, and 
affected a deep scorn for the intellectual debasement of which 
they alleged this event to be a manifest proof; while. the 
Catholics disclosed a festered soreness upon an incident which, 
they could not fail to feel, was likely to expose them to much 
plausible imputation. 
The Court-house was crowded to the roof by persons of all 
classes and opinions, among whom the clergy of both churches 
were conspicuous. It was filled with parsons and with priests. 
Although there is a certain clerical affinity between ecclesias- _ 
ties of all sorts, it was not difficult, under a cloth of the same © 
coler, to distinguish between the ministers of the two religions,

countenances of the Catholic clergy betrayed, in the rude play 
of their marked and impassioned features, the bitter conscious: 
ness of unmerited humiliation. - : 
The dress of the two clerical parties presented a singular 
contrast. The priests were cased in huge top-boots-of dubious 
and murky yellow and of bespattered black: the parsons’ 
taper limbs were enclosed in tight and sable silk, which, by 
compressing, disclosed their plump proportions, The nameless 
integuments of the Popish ministers of the gospel were framed 
of substantial thickset, and bore evidence to the high trot‘of 
the rough-coated nags with which they had descended: from 
the mountains ; while the immaculate kerseymere ofthe’ par- 
sons’ inexpressibles indicated with what nicety they had 
picked their steps through all the mire of the Catholic mul- 
titude round the court. The priests’ dingy waistcoats were 
close fastened to their neckcloths, and looked like an armor’ 
of eeonomy; while the parsons’ exhibited the finest cambiic, 
wrought into minute and snow-white folds. A ponderous 
mantle of smoking frieze hung from the shoulders -of. the 
priest; while a well-shaped jerkin brought the parson’s syin- 
metries into relief. The parson held a pinch of Prince’s: Mix 
ture between his lilied fingers, while the priest impelled a 
reiterated and ample mass of Lundifoot into his -olfactory 
organ.* “he priest’s cheek was ruddy with the keen air of -

Besides the clergy of the two religions, I. observed another 
class, whom, from their plain apparel and primitive aspect, T 
_ took for the friars of Wexford, but upon looking more closely 
I discovered my mistake. 'There-was a grimness in their ex- 
pression, quite foreign from the natural and easy cheerfuliess 
of an Trish Franciscan ; and in their disastrous and Calvinistic 
visages, their long, lank hair, and the gloomy leer of mingled 
hatred and. derision with which they surveyed the Catholics 
around them, I beheld the ghostly “teachers of the- Word.” 
A pause took place before the trial was called on, which 
rendered expectation more intense: at length Mr. Justice 
Johnson directed that the prisoner should be brought forward. 
Every eye was turned to the dock, and the prisoner stood at 
the bar. “His figure was tall and dignified. A large black 
cloak with a scarlet collar was fastened with a clasp round 
his neck, but not so closely. as to conceal the ample chest, 
across which his arms were loosely and resignedly folded. 
His strong black hair was bound with a velvet band, to con- 
ceal the recent incisions made by the Surgeon in his head. 
His countenance was smooth and finely chiseled; and it was 
observed by many that his features, which, though small, were 
~ marked, bore a miniature resemblance to Napoleon. His color 
was dead and chalky, and it was impossible to perceive the 
least play or variety of emotion, about the mouth, which con- 
tinued open, and of the color of ashes. On being called on to 
plead, he remained silent. 
‘The Court was about to direct ati inquiry whether he was 
“mute of malice,” when it was seen by a glance of his eye, 
that lie was conscious of the purport of the question; and. by 
the directions of his counsel he pleaded not guilty. During 
the trial, which was conducted with the most exemplary mod- 
eration by the counsel for tle crown, he retained his petrified’ 
and statue-like demeanor; and although the heat was most 
intense, the hue of his face and lips did not undergo the 
slightest change. The jury found that he had committed the 
direful act under the influence of insanity. Judge Johnson 
addressed him in a very striking and pathetic manner. He 
seemed to me to have blood in his ‘eye for Prince Hohenloe,

"whose miracles were then in'vogue,* and were supposed, how- 
ever erroneously, to have contributed to the prisoner’s infatua- 
tion. This was a mistake: he was organically insane, and 
was in reality as innocent as the poor child who had perished 
in his hands. The learned judge opened a masqued battery 
upon Bamberg,t and some of the shots reached to Rome: but- 
he should not have forgotten that there is a form for exorcism 
in the Protestant as well as in the Roman Catholic ritual. 
The religion of England requires a further cleansing, and a 
new Reformation might be a judicious project.

of Rome, and was a man of such singular piety that it was believed, in Ireland,

Mr. Donerry, whom his personal claims, assisted I presume 
by his political connections, and backed by the opposition of 
Lord Manvers, have recommended as the new Solicitor-General 
of Ireland [1827], is six feet two inches high, and “ every inch” a 
-very estimable person. Tall ashe is, there is nothing contempt- 
uous or haughty in his carriage. He never proudly tosses up 
his chin, as if to let briefer specimens of humanity pass under. 
He delights not, like his learned and pious competitor for office, 
in soaring among the skies for the inward satisfaction of look- 
ing down upon other men; neither can he pass with the dexter- 
ous versatility of that holy Sergeant [Lefroy] from knotty ques- 
tions of Chancery practice to the latest authorities for “nonsuit- 
ing the devil.”* He is, on the contrary, as terrestrial as can be 
in his habits and intercourse. His manners are friendly and 
forbearing, and his conversation enlivened by a temperate love 
of frolic, which endears his society to all those hardened sin- 
ners who have. not yet been sainted into a due sense of the 
awful regponsibility of joining in a hearty laugh. 
As to more important points, he is admitted on all hands to

of the learned saints of Ireland, ‘In a word, while he lives, he is the delight 
of the courts, the ornament of the bar, the glory of his profession, the patron 
of innocency, the upholder of right, the scourge of oppression; the terror of 
deceit, and the oracle of his country; and when death calls him to the bar of 
Heaven by a habeas corpus cum causis, he finds his judge his advocate, nonsuits -

- years, the leader upon his circuit; and since he became so, has 
given unequivocal proofs that he possesses powers of no ordi- 
nary kind in swaying the decisions of a jury, while he has 
more recently, in the discussion of graver matters in the courts 
* of Dublin, established a character for legal efficiency, which 
has been erroneously assumed to be incompatible with the more 
popular attributes of wit and eloquence. Resting upon a con- 
fidence in his qualifications, and sustained by a just ambition, 
Mr. Doherty long since announced by his conduct that he as- 
pired to something more than the partial success which is — 
founded upon the mete emoluments of place. Five years ago 
~ he resigned a lucrative office,* of which he found the duties 
to interfere with his final objects, and, dedicating himself more 
exclusively to his profession, has prepared himself for thosp 
higher honoys which he then ‘predicted to lie within his reach. 
As an advocate, his general style of treating serious topics 
has nothing so peculiarly his own as prominently to distinguish 
him fram others. In his addresses to juries he is prompt, or- ° 
derly, correct; and fluent—rarely attempting to inflame the 
passions to their highest pitch, but always warmly and foreibly- 
inculeating the principles of common sense and practical good 
feeling; but when a case requires (in technical parlance) “to 
be Jaughed out of court” (and one half of the cases that enter 
there deserve to be so dismissed), Mr. Doherty exhibits powers 
of very striking and effective originality. I know of no one 
that more eminently possesses the difficult talent of enlisting a 
jury on his side by a continued strain of good-humored, gen- 
tlemanlike irony consisting of mock-heroic encomiums, gar- 
castic deference, and appropriate parodies upon arguments and 
illustrations, delivered (as long as gravity is possible) with a 
most meritorious solemnity of countenance, and a certain artful _ 
* kindliness of tone, that heightens the absurdity it exposes, by 
affecting to eommiserate it.. He is also distinguished for his 
ability in cross-examination—a quality which has rendered 
him, in his capacity of crown-prosecutor upon his circuit, a. for- 
midable co-operator in the enforcement of the laws. ©

CANDIDATES FOR PROMOTION. 313 
Recent events have brought this gentleman into prominent 
view before the Irish public, and have arrayed in his interest 
a degree of. popular favor which is rarely tendered to a future 
adviser of state-prosecutions. Upon the late vacancy of the 
Solicitor-Generalship for Ireland (an office upon which its long 
tenure by the present Lord ChiefJustice Bushe has-conferred 
a kind of classic dignity), a variety of concwring circumstances 
—the respectability of his personal character —his professional 
competency —the known liberality of his political opinions — 
and his parliamentary and private relations with the prime 
minister of England— pointed out Mr. Doherty as one of the 
fittest persons to be raised to the situation. 
I should be unjust to others if I were to assert that he was in 
every possible respect the very fittest. I can not overlook, the 
Tvish public did not overlook, the claims of such a man as Mr. 
Wallace, founded as they are upon eminent professional sta- 
tion, tried public character, and (the penalty of the latter) a 
long and systematic exclusion from office. Mr. Holmes is an- 
other.* He was spoken of, and well deserved it. His profes- 
sional life has been one continued manly appeal to the public; 
and the public, doing all they could for him, have placed him 
at the head of his profession. In his political principles he has 
been honest and immutable, careless of patronage, and prizing 
above all things his self-respect. Another of the same school 
and stamp is Mr. Perrin, a younger man by many years—too 
young, perhaps, to be raised to professional honors by merit 
alone.t His name was not mentioned upon the occasion re- 
* Robert Holmes, for many years Father of the trish Bar, made his last’ pub- 
lic: appearance (of any consequence) in the State Trials arising out of the 
O'Connell Monster meetings of 1843, holding a brief for the Crown. He was 
then seventy-three years old. He was a lawyer of much ability, a man of great 
private worth. "He was married to Emmett’s sister-in-law, and, on suspicion 
of holding the same political opinions, was arrested, in 1803, and imprisoned 
for some months. He repeatedly refused a silk gown, preferring his station os

ferred to, but where a fitness for the public service is in ques- 
tion, I can not in faimess pass it by. He commenced his career 
at # period (the most dismal in the annals of the Irish bar) 
-when publie spirit led to martyrdom; but he was one of the 
few that were too strong to be suppressed. He prospered in 
despite of his inflexible adherence to the opinions of his youth, 
and (a rare event in the life of a liberal Irishman) has lived to 
seo the day when such opinions are no longer to disqualify. I 
- could mention others. Myr. North, for example, was in every 
way suited by character, acquirements, and enlightened views, 
to bear a part in a reformed government of Ireland. So was 
Mr. Crampton,* who, though more absorbed in his profession, 
“guished, and had e calm, earnest manner (the result of his somewhat satur- 
‘nine. temperament), which had much weight with juries. -Strongly supported 
on the liberal interest, by Lord Anglesey’s Government, Mr. Perrin contested 
the representation of Dublin city, at the general election, in 1831, and was re- 
turned with Mr. (afterward Sir Thomas) Harty. Both were soon unseated on 
petition. At the election in 1832, following the passing of the Reform Bill, 
Mr. Perrin successfully contested Monaghan County. The whigs made him 
Solicitor-General, under Attorney-General O’Loghlin. In Parliament, he was 
an industrious man who carefully attended to the contents and revision of Irish 
Bills. The Whigs placed him on the Bench, and he has there given general 
satisfaction. Inthe O’Connell trials of 1844, he was one of the Judges—the 
others being Pennefather, Burton, and Crampton. During these State Trial, 
he did not conceal nor cloak his opinion that many of the objections, as to the 
legality of some of the proceedings, made by the defendants (O’Corinell. and 
his friends) were well founded — but he was overruled by the majority, . Judge 
Perrin has always been a consistent liberal in politics. Between O'Connell 
and himself there was a warm friendship of long standing. He is now [1854] 
seventy years of age.-~ M. 
* Charles Cecil Crampton, born in 1783, was called to the bar in 1810. After 
a very distinguished University career, he-first became Fellow of, and subse- 
quently Law-Professor to, Trinity College. He entered Parliament for the 
borough of Dungarvan, and became Solicitor-General to the Whig Government 
of 1830. He was raised to the Bench earlier than usual, owing to his being 
disliked by Mr. O’Connell, who, on that account, could not work pleasantly 
with him. The Whigs, who then ruled Ireland through O’Connell, made Mr. 
Crampton a Judge, on the earliest vacancy—to get him out of the way. Judge 
Crampton never was an. eloquent man, but it is supposed that he had as much 
Nisi-Prius practice as any Irish lawyer, in his time. Long before the Temper- 
ance Movement had been commenced by Father Matthew, it was well known 
that Judge Crampton was a water-driaker. When he became so, on principle;-

and more circumspect in his avowals, has always had the spirit 
to keep aloof from the base expedients that led to advance- 
ment at the Irish bar. 
Thave introduced those names without any invidious design 
toward the immediate subject of the present sketch. On the 
. contrary, I could not easily produce a more complimentary 
_ test of his personal and professional, estimation than the fact 
“that the postponement of such men to him was acquiesced in 
without a murmur from the bar or the public. - His individual 
qualifications were fully admitted ; and it was further borne in 
’ mind that the circumstance of his having a seat in the House of 
Commons, where one at the least of the law-officers of the Crown 
should be present to answer for their acts, afforded in his favor 
an obvious and powerful ground of preference. The Lord- 
Chancellor of Ireland, however, decided otherwise; and, with- 
out presuming to usurp the jurisdiction of the House of Peers, 
or to emulate its frequent severity toward his Lordship’s judi- 
cial errors, I may perhaps be permitted to investigate the rea-~ 
sons and the value of his decision in the present instance. 
Lord Manners is a nobleman of high English blood, and in 
his individual capacity, and when left to himself, is marked 
by all the thoroughbred attributes that belong to his raco. As 
a private man, and apart from politics, he is dignified, cour- 
teous, just, and generous. His moral instincts are all aided 
‘and enforced by the honorable pride of the peer and the gen- 
tleman; he recoils from what is base, not only because it is so, 
but because to act otherwise would be unworthy of the blood 
of the Rutlands. Though of a_temperament rather irritable 
than warm, he is fervid and steadfast in his friendships. In 
his private intercourse there is an easy simplicity of+ manner, 
and a condescending familiarity of tone, that not only fascinates 
his immediate adherents, but even charms down the resentment 
” of the Catholic Squire, to whom he explains the political im- 
possibility of granting him the commission of the peace. Many 
of these qualities follow Lord Manners to the judgment-seat, 
but in company with others which greatly detract from their

influence. It is not so easy a matter to be a great: judge as a 
perfect-gentleman. ‘That he is the latter, his Lordship’s ene- 
mies must admit; that he ever could be the former, even Ser- 
géant Lefroy has scrupulously abstained from insinuating — 
the contrary, and the cause of it, were too palpable. 
In the decisions of Lord Manners, even’ in those now pros- 
trate-ones at which the Chancellor of England shook his sides 
as samples of -provincial equity, there were no symptoms: of 
impatient or perverted strength of intellect rushing vigorously 
to a wrong conelusion.. The judicial defects of Lord Manners 
have another origin —a natural delicacy of mental constitution, 
which incapacitates him for the labors of legal dialectics. As 
far as a mere passive operation of the mind is required for. col- 
lecting a series of naked-facts, he shows no deficiency of per- 
ception or retention. The settlements, marriages, deaths, and 
incumbrances, that form the ordinary staple of a chancery suit, 
he can master.with sufficient expertness; and, probably, not 
the less so from having his attention unmolested during ‘the 
process by any logical speculations upon their bearings on the 
issue ; but whenever an active effort of thought is wanting for 
the comprehending and elucidating a complicated question, the 
organic failing of his mind breaks out. Submit two proposi- 
tions to him, and, if they be in immediate juxtaposition, he can 
perceive as quickly as another whether they correspond or dif. ~ 
fer; but if (as in the case of most legal problems) their relation 
is diseoverable only by a process of intermediate comparisons, . 
no sooner has the advocate advanced a step in the operation, 
than he is left to proceed alone, the Chancellor remaining stock 
still at the starting-point, and looking on with a polite, fastidi- 
ous smile, as if he were rather determined not to be misled than 
unable to follow. The ‘consequence of this habitual inertness 
of intellect is, that the fate of every case of difficulty that comes 
before him must be more or less an affair of chance, depending 
‘not so much upon its various aspects, as upon the precise point 
of elevation to which his mind can be possibly uplifted for the 
purpose of inspection. ‘

the unrelenting dexterity of a hardened logician. It was at 
once interesting and amusing to see that consummate advocate, 
when nothing else remained, resorting to a series of subtle 
stratagems, of which none but himself could discern the object, 
until the last movement being completed, presented the victim 
of his craft pent up in an equitable defile from which there was 
no escaping: If he attempted it on one side, there stood Vesey 
Junior guarding the pass; if on the other, his own Stackpoole 
and Stackpoole (as just reversed in the Lords’) stopped the 
way; Hardwicke* and Camden overawed his rear; common 
sense and the Attorney-General kept annoying his front, until 
the keeper of the Irish seals, exhausted though unconvinced, 
would frankly admit that he was “ perplexed in the extreme,” 
and, casting a wistful eye at Mr. Saurin, demand four-and- 
twenty hours to clear his thoughts. It required, however, all 
the authoritative ability of such a man as-the late Attorney- 
General to extract such an admission from his Lordship. To 
others, whom there was less risk of provoking by impatience,

the bar in 1714, he entered. Parliament m 1718, and (though the youngest 
counsel on the Western Circuit) was appointed Solicitor-General, in 1720, on 
the recommendation of Lord Chancellor Macclesfield. In 1723, when he was 
made Attorney-General, he refused to act on the impeachment of Lord Maccles- 
field, his first patron, and defended him, in the House of Commons from the 
attacks of Mr. Sergeant Pengelly. In 1733, was made ‘Lord ChiefJustice of 
England, and raised to the peerage, as Baron Hardwicke, He was appointed 
Lord Chancellor in 1737, and during the twenty years he held that office, only 
three of his judgments were even questioned, and these were confirmed, on 
appeal, by the House of Lords: In 1754 he was raised to an Earldom, and 
resigned office-in 1756, He died in 1764, leaving a reputation very high in- 
deed. His knowledge of law and equity was great. So were his learning and 
his ready application of it. Lord Mansfield, Burke, and the noted: John Wilkes, 
each characterized him in the same words—‘ When Hardwicke pronounced 
hia decrees, Wisdom herself might be supposed to speak.” He trifled with 
literature, which he liked. He wrote “The Legal Judicature in Chancery

he has always given it to be clearly understood that, when once 
he had succeeded in forming an opinion, he did not expect to 
be pressed by arguments against it. In doing this he did not 
~ intend to be unjust; he merely shrunk from the mental labor 
of reinvestigating the grounds of a conclusion, at which, whether 
right or wrong, he had found it no easy task to arrive: but the 
consequence of his known irritability upon such occasions has 
inevitably been to place a counsel in the embarrassing predica- 
ment of either surrendering his case before it is thoroughly dis- 
cussed, or of exposing himself by his perseverance to the im- 
putation of being wanting in respect to the Court. 
A Chancellor of Ireland is necessarily a politician, and I 
confidently believe that Lord Manners had as anxious a wish 
to be a beneficent statesman as to be a just judge, but it could 
not be. He came to Ireland with the prejudices of the cradle 
upon the questions that agitate her; and in a mind like his, 
such prejudices are fondly cherished as easy of comprehension, 
.and saving the necessity of more laborious investigation. Tell 
this amiable nobleman that the dread of Popery is no more 
“the foundation of British freedom than the fear of goblins is 
.the basis of religion, and he starts as if you proposed an im- 
mediate dissolution of society. Insinuate that the only known 
method of consolidating an empire is by communicating equal 
rights and benefits to all its parts, and his prophetic eye be- 
holds a picture inconceivably appalling—the Pope on the 
throne of Ireland ; Doctor Doyle, Archbishop of Dublin ;* Mr. 
O'Connell, Lord High-Chancellor; Mr. Purcel O’Gorman, prin- 
cipal Secretary for Papal affairs; and, worse than all, “Mr.

all Lord Manuers’s political acts: his government of the magis- 
tracy, his recommendations to office, and (what in Ireland may 
be called a political act) the selection of his personal favorites. 
Even the speculators in a preposterous theology, which Lord 
Manners never liked, found favor in his sight, in consideration” 
‘of theiy rapturous concurrence. in his worldly misconceptions. 
He was at all times willing to meet a senior or junior saint 
anywhere but at the Bethesda, and to hear anything from their 
lips except an extemporary exhortation. It was quite impossible 
that a person so single-hearted and unsuspecting should fail 
to be the frequent dupe of those intelligent devotees. It is 
recorded of that ingenious personage, immortalized as Mr. Dex- 
ter in the novel of “O’Donnell,” that he was in the habit, for 
his own shrewd purposes, of keeping close to the Irish Chan- 
cellor (who. is a keen sportsman, though an indifferent shot), 
upon his shooting excursions through Lord Abercorn’s grounds. 
Every bird that rose was missed by the peer, and contempora- 
neously brought down by his unerring companion, who, with 
pretended mortification, and an effrontery of adulation known 
only to Ivish parasites, would bluster. about the unfaimess of 
being anticipated in every shot; and, after a day thus turned 
to good account, would bring back the illustrious sportsman 
loaded with imaginary spoils, and exulting in his undiminished 
accuracy of aim. It was not only in the fields of Barons Court 
that his Lordship has been attended by men as dexterous as 
Mr. Dexter. He was too obvious an instrument not to be sur- 
rounded by practised political marksmen, who were ever ready, 
for their own substantial objects, to give him all the use and 
- glory of their skill. Having no taste for general reading or 
solitary meditation, he has dedicated his extrajudicial hours 
to social ease, and naturally fell into a companionship with 
those who were least disposed to shake his faith in his preju- 
dices. It was not in the Huguenot recollections of Mr. Sau- 
rin, nor in the colloquial revelations of Mr. Sergeant Lefroy, 
that a public functionary in Treland could be expected to be 
weaned of his-political antipathies. The extent of those an- 
' tipathies, and their undeviating influence upon his Lordship’s | 
public acts, may be collected from a single fact. Among the
-P-A-G-E-321

_ legal appointments in the gift of the Irish Chancellor, there are 
about thirty commissionerships of bankrupts; and, during the 
twenty years that Lord Manners has held the seals, not one 
Catholic barrister bas been named to a place. 
An important branch of the Trish Chancellor’s patronage, 
and one that he has exercised with more profusion than any. 
of his predecessors, is “the nomination of King’s Counsel. The 
_ subject demands a short notice of the nature and incidents of 
this appointment. The legal fiction is (as the term imports), 
that a certain number of barristers are selected to conduct the 
necessary business of the Crown. In point of fact they are 
utterly. unnecessary, and, as such, unemployed for that pur- 
pose. The business of the Crown can be, and is, fully dis- 
charged by the Attorney and Solicitor General and the three 
Sergeants upon important occasions; and, in ordinary matters, 
by the several Crown-proseeutors, who are chosen indiscrimi- 
nately from the bar. The Attorney-General is bound to pro- 
vide for the proper conduct of Crown-prosecutions, and, as he 
can not be present in his own person, he substitutes in his place 
certain individuals, for whose efficiency he is responsible; of 
these a considerable portion, upon some of the circuits one half, 
are at this moment stuf-gowns. But however rarely the King 
may in point of fact have occasion for the services of his nomi-- 
nal counsel, they are by a similar fiction of law presumed to be 
at all times occupied with the business of the Crown, and there- 
fore entitled to precedence in the Courts. This; to a barrister 
of ordinary efficiency, is an important personal advantage. It 
enables him to bring on his motions to a speedy decision, and 
thus establishes, for those who enjoy the privilege, a profitable 
monopoly of an extensive branch of general business. The 
only exception is in the Rolls Court; where, by a regulation 
of the present Master of the Rolls, the several motions for the 
day are entered in a list according to the date of the notice, 
and called on in regular rotation. There is, consequently, no 
precedency among the counsel; and the result (which can 
be scarcely accidéntal) is, that in that Court the great mass of 
the very important business transacted there is distributed 
among the members of the outer bar. In all the other Courts
-P-A-G-E-322
OBJECTIONS TO HIS. PROMOTION, 821 
a large portion of the general business is withdrawn from the 
outer bar, and distributed among the privileged few. In com- 
mon fairness, therefore, to the profession at large, and also to 
the suitor, who ought to be left as uncontrolled as possible in 
the selection of his counsel, personal privileges of this kind, 
which ‘thus work a detriment to others, should be very spar- 
ingly conferred. In former times, a silk-gown was given as an 
honorary distinction to an already eminent barrister, and not 
as a recommendation to business. ‘Thirty years ago there were 
only sixteen King’s Counsel, and since then the general busi- 
ness of the bar has materially decreased. There are now 
forty-three — all, with a few exceptions, of Lord Manners’s 
creation. The number has, in fact, become so excessive, that 
it has been found necessary to alter the old arrangement of the 
Courts, in order to supply them all with seats. At the English 
bar, where public opinion has some influence, there were, at the 
commencement of the present year [1827], only twenty-eight 
King’s Counsel. 
Wher Mr. Doherty was lately nominated to the vacant So- 
licitor-Generalship for Ireland, Lord Manners. interposed, and 
for some weeks refused to swear him in. The measure was as 
unprecedented as the reason assigned; namely, that the gen- 
tleman in question, who is’ of twenty years’ standing, was too 
youthful a barrister to be lifted over the heads of certain meri- 
torious seniors. ‘The principle sounded fairly enough in ‘the 
ears of the one or two who hoped to profit by it, but it had not 
the slightest foundation in established usage. There has been 
no such thing at the Irish bar as even a vague expectation that 
promotion was to be regulated by length of standing, and least 
of all, promotion to the office in question, which may be said 
to partake more of a political than a legal character. It is only 
necessary to refer to the appointments since the Union; they 
_are aa follows:— , 
Sir John Stewart, eighteen years at the bar. 
Mr. O'Grady (now Chief Baron of the Exchequer), fifteen 
years at the bar. 
Mr-M'Cleland (now Baron of the Exchequer), thirteen years 
at the bar.

-P-A-G-E-323
322 : JOHN DOHERTY. 
Mr. Plunket (now Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas), sev- 
enteen years at‘the bar. , 
“Mr. Bushe (now Chief-Justice of the King’s Bench), thirteen 
years at the bar. 
The list closes with the present Attorney-General, Mr. Joy 
[1827]. He had certainly obtained the maturity of standing, 
which has at length been discovered to be so indispensable a 
’ qualification ; but who, that ever gave a thought to the reasons 
for his appointment, does not know that he was made Solicitor- 
General in 1822, not because he happened to be a Sergeant, 
not because he was well stricken in legal years, but because there 
was in his person a coincidence of professional and political 
requisites which accorded with the project of a balanced Ad- 
ministration. So far as the question of seniority is concerned, 
he formed an exception to the general practice. 
Overlooking, however, the objection that My. Doherty is not 
old enough in his profession to be a “promising young man” 
—a grave legal maxim, for which Lord Manners has the high 
authority of Mr, Sergeant Flower—I would say that the po- 
litical circumstances of Ireland afford some very serious reasons 
for the selection of this gentleman, and the rejection of the 
class of competitors that- Lord Manners would have preferred. 
The late purification of the British Cabinet* has opened new 
* George Canning was appointed Governor-General of India in 1822, had 
prepared for his departure, and publicly taken leave of his constituents at Liv- 
erpool, when the Marquis of Londonderry (Castlereagh) committed suicide. 
The foreign secretaryship thus became vacant. George IV. (who had not for 
given him for going to the Continent, and offering to resign his office of Presi- 
dent of the Board of Control, rather than assist in the prosecution and persecu- 
tion of Queen Caroline, whom he had spoken of in Parliament as “‘the 
grace, life, and ornament of society’’) hesitated to appoint Canning. He did 
so, however, and Canning thereby became the virtual head of the Administration, 
the nominal head being Lord Liverpool, who was “obliged to take large ‘and 
daily doses of ether to strengthen his nerves, and who confessed that, for years, 
he had never received his letters in the morning without dreading to open 
them, for fear that they should give him nétice of an insurrection in some part 
of the country. Croly (a Tory) says of him that his system was to glide on from 
year to year, and think that his business was amply done, if the twelye months 
passed without a rebellion, a war, or a national bankruptcy; to shrink from 
every improvement in his terror of change; and to tolerate every old abuse, 
through dread of giving the nation a habit of inquiry. Yet this man had ruled

prospects to’ the Catholies of Ireland, and (what a wise and 
considerate government should never overlook) has inspired 
their leaders with a sanguine and determined forbearance sel- 
England, with a mind thus enfeebled, for fifteen years! From 1822 until Feb- 
ruary, 1827, when Lord Liverpool was attacked by paralysis, Canning may be 
eaid to have ruled the country. Some weeks elapsed before Lord Liverpool’s 
place was filled up—in the interval (early in March), Canning made a power- 
fal speech in Parliament, in support of Catholic Emancipation, which was lost 
by a majority of four only. At last, on April 12, 1827, it was announced that 
Canning had been appointed Prime Minister. Suddenly and simultaneously, 
Wellington, Peel, Eldon, and three others of Canning's colleagues in the Cab- 
inet, resigned. He formed a ministry consisting of Hberals— but the Tories 
formed a compact opposition, aided by “the old whigs,” headed by Earl Grey. 
This latter party, not very numerous then, consisted of those who thought that 
certain noble families, on either side, had a sort of hereditary right to govern 
the country. Perhaps, also, Lord Grey recollected that, in a keen satire on 
“ AN the Talents,” written by Canning, twenty years before, Temple’s wit and 
Sidmouth’s firmness, had been slily contrasted with 
  
“the temper of Grey, 
And Treasurer Sheridan’s promise to pay.” 
At all events, Lord Grey strongly and haughtily opposed Canning’s ministry. 
The Irish Catholics, who saw in the new Premier one of their most eloquent ad- 
vocates, and who speedily felt the advantages accruing from the charges he 
made personnalité of the Irish Government, naturally entertained the highest 
hopes from the promotion of their friend. He had to contend, in ill health, with 
avery strong and ruthless opposition in Parliament which “ hounded him on to 
death” (to use the words of Lord George Bentinck’s accusation of Peel, at a 
later day), and a Premier who would have carried out the most liberal meas- 
ures, had he lived, died in the Duke of Devonshire’s house, at Chiswick, near 
London, on August 8, 1827, aged 57, in the very same room where, twenty-one 
years’ earlier, Charles James Fox had breathed his last—much about the same 
age; each being liberal in politics, each crowning the labors of a life of active 
ambition, by finally obtaining the highest office—to hold it for a few months 
and “die in harness.” Canning was succeeded, as Premier, by Lord Gode- 
rich, who had not talent or influence to govern. In January, 1828, the reins 
of empire passed from his weak hands to those of Wellington~-the avowed 
opponent of the Catholic claims. Then, in despair and defiance, came the Clare 
Election, which led, in the Duke’s opinion, to one of two things—~a civil war 
‘or Catholic Emancipation. The soldier, segacious by reason of his long expe- 
rience in war, preferred to yield—on the plea of necegsity, This he did in 
1829... Next year, he waa too proud ta grant Parliamentary Reform, on the same 
grounds; and waa defeated, The Whigs came into power, headed by Lord 
Grey, and after the severest Parliamentary struggle ever known —stretching 
through two Parliaments and twe years’ excitement— was passed that reform

dom manifested by the directors of a popular body. The skill 
and prudence with which Mr. O’Comell and his colleagues, at 
the risk of their popularity, have prevailed upon their ardent 
countrymen to accommodate their temper to the exigencies of 
the occasion, justly merited every practical acknowledgment 
that could be tendered by the now Administration. Next to 
the final consummation of their hopes, the Irish Catholics an- 
nex the utmost importance to the official appointments of per- 
sons in whom they ean confide; and most of all in the case of 
the legal advisers of the Crown, ypon whose individual charac- 
ters and political tenets they know by: experience that the 
- decision of many questions affecting their interests depends. 
But, however sensitive upon this point, they evinced no dis- 
position, at the recent crisis, to embarrass the Government, by 
exacting more than could be conveniently accorded. Though 
well aware of Mr. J oy’s hostility to their cause, they allowed 
his-personal claims to outweigh their wishes, and acquiesced, 
asa matter of state necessity, in his elevation to the vaeant 
Attorney-Generalship; but farther than this they eould not be 
expected to go. They saw that the Government was free to 
choose his colleague, and very reasonably considered that their 
feelings and interests should be consulted in the selection. 
Had this expectation been baffled-—had a political favorite of 
Lord Manners been raised to a condition of suggesting subtle 
reasons for disturbing the public tranquillity by the prosecation 
of the Catholic leaders, the most disastrous results would have. 
ensued ; all confidence in the professions of the new Minister 
would have been at anend. The Catholic Association would 
have instantly exploded, and have been quickly involved in 
angry éollisions with the Government, fatal alike to their own 
interests and to the stability of the Administration from which 
they have so much to hope. These lamentable consequences 
have, however, been prevented. The spirit of a better and 
juster policy prevailed. Mr. Doherty was preferred; and the 
measure was no sooner announced, than its propriety was sane-

tioned by the public and uncquivocal satisfaction of that body 
which it was of such vital moment to conciliate.* 
The mere legal duties of the office to which Mr. Doherty 
has been called might be easily discharged by a person of pro- 
fessional qualifications much inferior to his; but it embraces 
‘other duties, demanding requisites of another and less common 
kind. It is now notorious that the Catholic question (however 
opinions may vary upon its relative importance) is the one 
upon which the fate of administrations depends, and most pe- 
culiarly the fate of the present administration. The Catholics 
of Ireland, though not yet arrived ‘at the maturity of strength 
and influence in the empire which, when attained, must insure 
an adjustment of their claims, have it at all times in their power 
to resort to proceedings incompatible with the continuance of 
their friends in office. Hence the relation of that body with 
the Government of the country, at the present juncture, is one 
* John Doherty, who was ChiefJustice of the Common Pleas in Ireland, for 
twenty years, was called to the bar in 1808, made King’s Counsel in 1823, 
Solicitor-General in 1827, and was ChiefJustice from 1830 until September, 
1850, when he died. Doherty, related on the maternal side.to Colonel Verner, 
M. P. for Armagh, and by his father’s family to Canning, came into Parlia- 
ment in 1826, as Member for Kilkenny. When Canning became Premier, he 
_taised Doherty to the position of Irish Solicitor. His knowledge of the science of 
Taw was by no means extensive, but his sagacity was great, his industry exem+ 
plary, and his sense of Justice pre-eminently powerful. It is said that of all 
the opponents who measured weapons with O’Connell in Parliament, the most 
successful, and certainly one of the most undaunted, was Mr. Doherty. Their _ 
chief encounter took place in May, 1830, shortly before Doherty was made a 
Judge, and O'Connell fiercely attacked him for his conduct as Crown lawyer, 
in what was called The Doneraile Conspiracy. He was met and answered, at 
all points, by Doherty, who (in the opinion of the Anti-O'Connellites, at least), 
silenced, if he did not convince, his assailant. Peel had such a favorable rec- 
* ollection of this word-duel that, in 1834, when he formed his first ministry. 
he solicited Doherty to resign his judicial office, and to return to the House of 
Commons, as one of the Cabinet. This was declined, whereupon Peel repeat- 
_ed his entreaty, offering to raise him to the House of Lords. Chief-Justice 
Doherty again declined, and Peel struggled on without his aid during the four 
months of his bold experiment of governing against the popular will. In 1846, 
before finally quitting office, it is said that Peel again offered a peerage to 
Doherty, who was compelled to decline it, from want of means to provide for 
the support of the dignity, having entered largely into railway epeculatioas, 
during the pteceding joint-stock-bubble year, and ‘thereby lost the bulk of his 
fortune. M.

of unexampled delicacy; and as.such requires the nicest man- 
agement in sustaining them under the fatigues of protracted 
hope, and in preventing them from confounding inevitable de- 
lays with an abandonment of their cause by their. professed sup- 
porters. It would be too much to expect that indications of 
this latter feeling will not occasionally break out, and in forms 
that may render it doubtful whether the due limits of popular 
discussion have been observed. Upon such questions, when 
they arise, the law-officers of the Crown will have to advise ; 
and, to advise with discretion, they must have something more 
than a knowledge of the law.. There must be good temper, 
good sense, good will toward the parties concerned, and a 
strong public interest in preserving the state from the embar- 
_Yassments that would follow a hasty prosecution.. These -im- 
portant. moral qualifications (if he be true to the tenor of his 
past life) will be found in Mr. Doherty’s official character; and 
along with them a great practical skill in winning over the- 
tempers of others to a given object, which eminently fits him 
for the task of mediating between the occasional effervescence 
of his Catholic countrymen and the literal rigor of the law. 
He will also—but I have pursued the subject far enough, and 
in dwelling so long upon it I feel it to be only an act of com- 
mon justice to an estimable individual to record the opinion of 
the Irish public upon the cruel but unavailing attempt that has 
been made to may his prospects, and to bring discredit upon 
the Government that thought him worthy of their trust. 
The voice of the country in which Mr. Doherty is best known 
has sustained him through this important crisis of his life. The 
zeal with which his ease was taken up by the Ivish community, 
though a merited, was a most: essential service, and claims at 
his hands every possible public return that he can make. He 
may personally forgive the Irish Chancellor for the wrong in- 
_ flicted on him; but for the sake of others, if not for his own, he 
must bear it keenly in his memory, and, stimulated by the ree 
ollection, make his future conduct a practical refutation of the 
pretexts for crushing him, and thereby afford an unanswerable 
justification of the Government that placed him where he is, 
and of the public that so warmly approved of the choice.

IN PARLIAMENT. 327 
What is expected from him as an officer of the Crown I have 
already intimated; but he will have other and more compre- 
hensive opportunities of retorting upon Lord Manners his pub- 
lic services. He will shortly resume his seat in the House of 
Commons, under circumstances that will secure for him an 
effective co-operation in every salutary measure that he pro- 
poses; and he must not allow the indolence of success, or a 
, groundless diffidence, to restrain him from turning his facilities 
to auseful account. Hitherto he has prudently abstained from 
trusting his reputation to the precarious effect of sample- 
speeches; and his continued abstinence will be justly applaud- 
ed, if he aspires to the better fame of making the statute-book 
speak for him. 
T have heard that he has for some time past been meditating 
a simplifigation of the Irish bankrupt-law. This is a favorable 
omen; but his ambition, to be of service, must not be limited’ 
_to matters of subordinate moment. It would be neither easy 
nor in place to enumerate here the various legislative wants of 
Treland ; but-I.can not avoid suggesting that there is one sub- 
ject of the highest national interest as yet unappropriated by 
any Irish member, and holding out an asssurance of the lasting 
importance that follows public services to any competent indi- 
- vidual who shall make it his peculiar care: I allude to the 
civilization ofthe Ivish criminal code. Such a project would 
be immediately within the scope of Mr. Doherty's studies and 
experience; much of the first and most deterring labor of the 
task would be saved by the adoption of Mr. Peel’s general 
plan,* while enough would remain in the modifications required 
by the particular state of Irish society, to give the undertaking 
a higher character than that of a servile imitation. 
* The late Sir Robert Peel was an eminently practical man of business. In 
1817, when he was Irish Secretary, he introduced the excellent police system 
now in operation in Ireland —from him the policemen are called Peelers. Thir- 
teen years later, he modified that system and adapted it to London, whére it 
continues to be very efficient. In 1826, hc commenced his admirable attempts 
. to soften the rigor of our criminal code, and succeeded in mitigating the sever 
ity of laws, which, in consequence of their harshness, had become nearly inop- 
erative, Nor, when he quitted office, in 1827 (on Canning’s becoming Pre- 
mier), did he relinquish this course of humanity and reason.— M.

THE DUBLIN TABINET BALL. 
A warer district of Dublin, commonly called «The Lib- 
erty,” is occupied by the manufacturers of tabinet. This part 
" of the city exhibits at all times a disagreeable aspect. It is 
a labyrinth of narrow lanes, composed of old and crazy 
houses, and is choked with nastiness of every kind. Even 
when its enormous population is in active employment, the 
senses are shocked with much odious circumstance ; but when 
labor is suspended, as is often the case, and the inhabitants are 
thrown out of employment, a spectacle of wretchedness is pre- 
sented in this quarter of the Irish metropolis, of which it would 
yequire the genius of My. Crabbe for the delineation of misery 
to convey any adequate picture. 
In the last month the manufacturing class have been with: 
‘out occupation’ or food. I passed, not very many days ago, 
through the district in which they chiefly reside, and do not 
recollect to have ever witnessed a more distressing scene. The 
streets may be said to have swarmed with want. With star- 
vation and despair in their countenances, and with their arms 
hanging in listlessness at their sides, hundreds of emaciated 
men stood in groups at every corner. They gaped on every 
personof the better class who chanced to pass them, with the 
vacant earnestness of famine; and when the equipage of some 
pampered and vain-glorious citizen rolled by, it was painful 
to observe in the expression of their faces the dumb compari- 
son with their own condition, which was passing through # their 
minds, 
The doors of the houses lay wide open, and, lighted up as 
they were with the new and brilliant sunshine of May, afforded

an insight into the recesses of internal wretchedness. ‘Their 
wives and children were scen huddled up together, with 
scarcely a shred of raiment upon their discolored and ema- 
ciated limbs. Their beds and blankets had been transferred 
to the pawnbrokers; and of their furniture, nothing but the 
. mere fixtures remained. The ashes round the hearth seemed 
to be of a week’s standing; and it was easy to perceive that the 
few potato-skins, scattered about the floor, were the relies of a 
repast of no very recent date. Silence in general prevailed 
through these receptacles of calamity, except that now and 
then I heard the wailing of a child, who called with -a feeble 
ery for bread. Most of these houses of affliction were deserted 
by the men, who stood in frightful gatherings in the public 
way. But here and there I observed the wan but athletic 
fathet of a family, sitting in the interior of his hovel, with his 
hands locked upon his knee, surrounded by his children, of 
whose presence he appeared to be scarcely conscious, and with 
his wild and matted hair, his fixed and maddening eye, his 
hard and stony lip, exhibiting a personification of despair; 
and, if I may so say, looking like the Ugolino of «The 
Liberty.” 
Whatever may bo the faults of the Irish character, insensi- 
bility to distress is not among them. Much substantial arid . 
practical commiseration was exhibited among th® higher 
orders for the’ sufferings of. the unfortunate manufacturers, 
and various expedients were addpted for their relief. It 
was, among other devices of benevolence, suggested to the 
Marchioness of Wellesley, that a public ball at the Rotunda 
would be of use, and accordingly a “ Tabinet Bail,” under the 
auspices of that fair and newly-ennobled lady, was announced. 
The notice was given in order to afford the young ladies in 
the country an opportunity of coming to town, and the 11th 
of May [1826] was fixed for the metropolitan féte. Peremptory 
orders were issued at the Castle, that no person should appear 
in any other than Irish manufacture. A great sensation was 
produced by what in such a provincial town as Dublin may 
be considered as an event. Crowds of families flocked, from 
all parts of the ‘country ; ; and if any prudential grazier remon-

eyes of. the young ladies having duly filled with tears, and 
mamma having protested that Mr. O’Flaherty might as well 
send the girls to a convent, and doom them to old-maidenhood 
for life, the old carriage was ordered to the hall-door, and 
came creaking into town, laden with the rural belles, who 
were to make a conquest at the “Tabinet Ball.’ The arrival 
of the important day was looked for with impatience, and 
many a young héart was kept beating under its virgin zone 
at the pleasurable anticipation. In the interval much good 
was accomplished, and Terpsichore set the loom at work. 
Every milliner’s shop gave notes of profuse and prodigal prep- 
aration. 
At last the 11th of May arrived, and at about ten o'clock 
the city shook with the roll of carriages hurrying frdm all 
quarters to the Rotunda. Not very long ago, Doctor Brinkley, 
the astronomer,* took the noise of a newly-established manu- 
factory for the indication of an approaching earthquake; and 
if he had not been removed since then from the contemplation 
of the stars, he would, in al] likelihood, have taken the con- 
cussion of the Tabinet Ball night, for the earthquake itself. 
- The love of dancing is not among my addictions, and it is the 
_ tendency of most persons of my profession to set up as a kind 
of spurious Childe-Harolds upon occasions of this kind; but 
as the object of the ball was national, and I was solicitous to 
take a close survey of Lord Wellesley and his Transatlantic 
bride, I'resolved to join the festive gathering, which charity 
and its amiable patroness had assembled. 
The Rotunda, where the ball was given, is a very beautiful 
building, erected, I believe, by Sir William Chambers, and

at Oxford, and was appointed, on the repute he had gained for his scientific

is one of those models of pure architecture with which Dublin 
abounds. Upon entering it, how different was the scene from 
that with which it was associated, aid hw strong a contrast 
was presented between the gorgeous and glittering spectacle 
. before me, and that which I have endeavored to describe. 
My. mind still retained some of those mournful reflections 
which the contemplation of misery had produced; and when 
I found myself surrounded with a blaze of intense and brilliant 
illumination, and encompassed by a crowd glittering with 
splendor, youth, and beauty, and moving in measure to exhil: 
arating music, the naked and half-famished wretches, whom 
T had seen so recently, rose like phantoms in my memory, and 
my imagination went back to the abode of starvation, and to 
“the house of wo.’ I did not, however, permit these melan- 
choly reflections to lay any permanent hold upon me; and in- 
deed the recollection that pleasure was made in this instance to 
minister to the relief of sorrow, should have reconciled a per- 
.80n of a much more ascetic quality of mind than I am, to a 
participation of the enjoy ments of so brilliant a scene. 
I question whether in London itself, however it may surpass 
our metropolis in wealth and grandeur, more splendor in alli- 
ance with good taste could readily be displayed.- There was 
an immense assemblage of young and beautiful women, dressed 
in an attire which, instead of impairing, tended to set off the 
loveliness of their aspects, and the symmetry of their fine 
forms—that sweetness and innocency of expression which 
characterizes an Irish lady, sat upon. their faces; modesty, 
Sweden. — Under the present regulations, no British subject can receive or as-

* Francis Chantrey, one of the most celebrated of modern. English: sculp- 
tors, and certainly without a superior as a bust-maker, was born in 1781, and 
died in 1841, aged sixty. From childhood he had a taste for drawing and 
modelling, and after serving his time to a carver and gilder at Sheffield, there 
cominenced painting portraits, which he soon gave up for making busts. ‘One 
of these, in the exhibition of the Royal Academy in London, brought bim into 
notice. He removed to London and speedily obtained numerous orders. _ His 
busts were portraits in marble, full of character and individuality. In 1817, he executed the monumental group of “The Sleeping Children” now in Lich- 
field. Cathedral, ovér whose simple beauty z and touching repose many tears have 
been shed. This poetic group was'made, it is said, from a drawing by Stoth- 
ard. Chantrey, who was elected a Royal Academician, and knighted, executed 
the busts of nearly all the leading personages of his time, and “several colossal

which was also the last (and not erected until after he had died), was the Wel-

Caton, Esq., of Maryland, and widow of Robert Patterson. The marriage’ took 
place in February, 1825, when Lord Wellesley was in his sixty-fifth, and the 
bride in her thirty-first year. Her sister, Louisa Catherine Caton was iar-

~The Marchioness’s name is Caton: she is the widow of 
“Mr. Patterson, and is thus allied, in some degree, with the 
Bonaparte family. She came to Ireland, accompanied by her 
sister, with no other object than to see the country. Having 
been introduced to the most fashionable circles, she did not at 
first disclose her religion, which might have been an obstacle

learned gentleman, whose spleen to the religion of the coun- 
try, considering his Huguenot descent and his fall from office, 
ought to be forgiven, had indulged in violent tirades against 
Lord Wellesley ; upon which the amiable widow did not hint 
a comment; and he came to an‘attack upon Popery, although 
some symptoms of uneasiness were displayed, yet for a long 
time no remonstrance was made: Mr. Saurin was not inter- 
rupted in his fleers at transubstantiation; he was permitted to 
indulge in some pleasantries at the expense of auricular con- 
fession: certain interesting anecdotes touching the Borgia 
family were allowed ‘to pass; but when he came to Prince 
Hohenloe, and opened a battery upon Bamberg, the widow 
could hold no longer; and,.turning upon Mr. Ex-Attorney- 
General, proclaimed herself a Papist. The dismay produced 
by this intimation may be more readily: conjectured than 
described. Whether-a slight flush came over the calm and

Not very long after this convivial incident, Mrs. Patterson 
was introduced at court, and Lord Wellesley was almost 
instantaneously struck with admiration of charms, of which 
one hundred and fifty thousand pounds were said to constitute 
a part.* Her wealth was, howover, greatly exaggerated by 
vulgar report; and the Marquis is, I believe, the very last 
man who would be disposed to take it into a matrimonial cal- 
culation. Though Hymen is sometimes addicted to the study 
of arithmetic, yet Lord Wellesley would never set him this 
inglorious task. He offered Mrs. Patterson his hand, and was 
accepted. In such a town as Dublin, so provincial in every- 
thing, and more especially in religion, the marriage of a lord- 
lieutenant to a Roman Catholic lady excited no ordinary 
sensation. The Catholics conceived that their creed would 
receive a sanction from a pair of beautiful eyes at the Castle; 
the priests expected that she would drive in state to chapel; 
and ‘Messrs. O’Connell and Sheil did not despair that her love © 
of legitimate rhetoric might induce her to go in disguise ta the 
gallery of the Catholic. House of Commons. The hopes of 
the Popish party were not a little confirmed by the nomina- 
tion of her private chaplain, in the person of the good-humored 
and cheerful-spirited Mr. Glynn. The Orange faction, and_ 
especially the saints, looked on the approaching event with a 
sentiment of corresponding alarm. It was idle, they said, to 
expect, on the part of Lord Wellesley, any very rigid adhe- 
rence to the principles of the Protestant religion. How pow- 
erful must be the influence of a young and a beautiful wife 
upon a man of careless-or vacillating opinions. 
These apprehensions were not a little augmented by the 
announcement that the Catholic archbishop was to celebrate 
* There are many reasons for believing that the “lady” though rich in personal 
charms, and moderately independent in circumstances, was by no means so 
wealthy as was reported. Her present ‘pecuniary resources are understood to 
be inconsiderable. I am in doubt whether she does not receive a pension from 
the British Government or the East India Company (both of whom Marquis 
Wellesley had served faithfully and with distinction), but I know that Queen 
Victoria has granted her a residence in Hampton Court Palace, a “ refuge for” 
the destitute” among the aristocracy, ia which many pauperized people of rank 
are rent-free, —M. -

. the marriage. Lord Wellesley was anxious -to indulge his 
bride in this selection; but Dr. Magee and his partisans pre- 
yailed. It was settled that the Doctor should have prece- 
. dence; and that, after he had “incorporated two in- one,” the 
rival hierarch should be introduced by a postern gate, and 
.allay the Marchioness’s religious scruples by a sacramental 
‘confirmation of the nugatory formalities, which should have 
been previously gone through by.the Protestant divine. By 
. this arrangement, politics and theology were felicitously recon- 
ciled. Dr. Magee went through the ceremony with his usual 
briskness and alacrity; and so sweet and winning was the 
smile with which the lady responded to the matrimonial pre- 
cept—to love, honor, and obey—that the doctor is said to 
have protested that Gospel truth shone through her eyes. 
Such is the fascination of beauty, even upon a mind so highly 
Spiritualized as the doctor’s, that, since this heterodox mar- 
riage, a considerable and even suspicious mitigation of his 
opinions has been observed. The influence of the Marchioness 
is matter of universal comment; and, upon a recent occasion, 
it was remarked that the Right Reverend Father in God had 
acted as cicisbeo to this “dangerous Papist,” and had accom- 
panied her to the principal mart for the sale of baby-linen in 
Dublin. - 
- These circumstances had surrounded the Marchioness with 
much interest, and will account for the curiosity which I 
felt to sce her. I stood in no little suspense, when it was 
announced that the noble pair were making their triumphant ~ 
entry into the Rotunda. Followed by a gorgeous retinue of 
_ richly-decorated attendants, the. Viceroy and his consort ad- 
vanced toward the immense assembly, who received them with 
acclamation. She was leaning upon his arm. He seemed 
justly proud of so fair a burden. The consciousness of so 
noble a possession had the effect upon him which the inspira- 
tions of Genius were said to have produced upon a eelebrated 
actor, and he looked “six feet high,” compact and well knit 
together, with great alertness in his movements, and with no 
further stoop than sixty winters have left upon him, with a 
searching and finely-irradiated eye, and with cheeks which,

a slight touch of melo-dramatic importance in his air and man- 
* In 1821, when George IV, visited Ireland—the first sovereign who had 
ever landed on her shore, in friendly mood—all parties united in giving him 
an enthusiastic reception. This unanimity of “loyalty” (as the lip-service is 
called, across the Atlantic), was in strong contrast with the hooting and hisses 
with which, at that'time, the “ illustrious" Sybarite was greeted in London, on 
account.of his ill-conduct toward his wife.- He was as grateful for this kindness 
(as unmerited as it was unexpected), and assented to the politic proposition 
of his Ministers that Ireland should be treated more kindly than of yore. When 
he left Dublin, he earnestly recommended the Irish (in a farewell epistle com- 
municated through Lord Sidmouth, the Home Secretary), no Ionger to allow 
their religious distinctions to be the cause of public animosity, or personal bit- 
terness.—Soon after, the Tory Viceroy, Earl Talbot, was recalled, and Marquis Wellesley, a distinguished Irishman, elder brother of the Duke of Wellington, 
and a proved advocate of the Catholic claims, was sent to Dublin as his succes- 
sor, in December, 1821. The Catholics rejoiced at his appointment as muchi — 
as the political-Protestants grieved. He endeavored to govern with impartial- 
ity, but could not picase all parties. In 1828, when the Duke of Wellington 
became Premier, and was avowedly hostile to Catholic Emancipation, Lord Wel 
-lesley resigned his post, but resumed it, in 1833, under the liberal Government 
of Earl Grey. He finally quitted Ireland, at the end of 1834, on the forma- 
ton of Sir Robert Peel's first administration. The chief fault of Lord Welles- 
ley, as Viceroy, was an overweening opinion of his own importance. What the Bourbon said (L’état c’est mot) was Lord Wellesley’s entire conviction. He 
was born in 1760; educated at Bton; succeeded his father, as Earl of Morning- 
ton, in 1781; sat in the Trish House of Lords, and in the English House of 
Commons (first as’ member for Beeralston aud then for New Windsor); was 
made one of the Lords of the Treasury, and Privy Councillor in 1793, and ere- 
ated an English peer in 1797, when he suoceeded Earl Cornwallis in the Gov- 
ernment of India; triumphed over Tippoo Saib and conquered the kingdom of 
Mysore, with the aid of his brother Colonel Wellesley (afterward The Duke); 
was rewarded by an Irish Marquisate in 1799; was recalled, at his own request, — in 1805; was sent as Ambassador to the Supreme Junta of Spain in 1809; 
became Foreign Secretary on the formation of the Perceval Ministry in the 
same year ; -retired early in 1812, chiefly because he differed from his colleagues 
on the Catholic question ;.and continued in opposition until his appointment to 
Ireland in, 1821. In 1835, he was Lord Chamberlain, under the Melbourne 
Ministry, for a short time. He died in September, 1842, in his eighty-third 
year. His mother, who died in 1831, lived to see four of her sons attain seats

me that there was something artificial and theatrical in his 
_ entranee upon a stage, in which epbemeral majesty was to be 
performed. It was said by Voltaire of, a real monarch, that 
no man could so well perform the part of aking. “Le-Réle 
de Roi,” is a phrase which, amounting to a truism, loses its 
. force, perhaps, when applied to a lord-lieutenant. 
Lord Wellesley seemed to me to personate his sovereign 
‘with too elaborate a fidelity to the part, and to forget that he 
‘was not in permanent possession of the character upon a'stage 
which was under the direction of such capricious managers, 
and that he must speedily relinquish it to some other actor 
upon our provincial boards. He is, unquestionably, a man of 
very great abilities; a speaker of the first order; a statesman 
with wide and philosophic views, who does not bound his pros- 
pects by any artificial horizon. He has great fame as a poli-

executed her first courtesy, atid the ease with which, in “recov-

portioned. Her arms and shoulders, though less suited to Hebe

justly say that it is— t 
“Fine by degrees, and beautifully less.” °

than the English heroine of Don Juan—

° The Marquis and the copartner of his honors, and sole ten- 
* ant of hig heart, having made their obeisance to the company, 
seated themselves upon the throne; and I can not help saying 
that, when I saw them surrounded with all the superfluous cir- 
cumstance of sovereignty, 4nd going through the mock-regal 
. farce, as if the whole business were not an idle and most un- 
substantial pageant, I felt pain at this voluntary exposure to 
the ridicule of their political opponents, who‘seemed to gather 
round for no other purpose than to pay their derisive and sar- 
donic homage. Upon what pretence these airs of royalty were 
*- assumed I could not even guess. The gentry of Dublin were 
assembled, at the instance of Lady Wellesley, to contribute to 
the promotion of Irish manufacture. This was assuredly no fit 
occasion for the “unreal mockery” of evanescent pomp. I 
question whether, under such circumstances, it would be proper 
in a genuine king to indulge in regal parade. But it appears 
to me to be out of all keeping, and to amount to no venial sin 
‘against good taste on the part of the mere shadowy representa- 
tive of a sovereign, to invest himself in monarchical state, and- 
- all “ the attributes to awe and majesty.” 
The deportment of his Excellency tended to “enhance the 
burlesque of the whole business. He affected all the noncha- 
lance of a person accustomed to royalty. His attitude was stu- 
diously careless, while that vivid physiognomy, of which, with 
all his practice in courts, he is not the absolute master, betrayed 
his anxiety for the production of effect. One of his legs was 
thrown heedlessly over the other, to indicate that he was per- 
. fectly at his ease; but, at the same time, his piercing and sa- 
gacious eye seemed to search amidst the crowd for that rever- 
ence. both to his person and to his office, to which he surmised, 
perhaps, that he. possessed: 4 somewhat disputable claim.

War, and Secretary to the Irish Postoffice with a patent, continuing the.lat- 
ter office in his family. Under this patent, Edward 8. Lees, the second. son, 
succeeded, and held the office, in Dublin, for many years, until he was induced to 
surrender the document, and was appointed to the postoffice in Edinburgh, where 
he died, after forty-six years public service. The founder of the fumily, who 
was thus solicitous to provide for his offspring, :was further honored with a bar- 
onetoy. His eldest son, Harcourt, succeeded to the title in-1811, on the death - 
of Sir John Lees, received valuable church-preferment, which, with his patri- 
* monial property, enabled him to live in good style, at Black Rock, near Dub- 
lin. One’ of the mildest and most good-natured men in private, he was ‘bold, 
abusive, and tructlent.in public. He was an Orangeman, and violent, beyond. 
all precedent, i in his abuse of “O'Connell, the Pope, and the Devil’’—for he 
always named the three in one breath. He started a weekly newspaper called 
“The Antidote,” ia which he was wont to empty the vials of his wrath. upon 
the Catholics in general, and Mr. O’Connell in particular. He was accustomed. 
to predict, once every three months or so, that there would be a general rising 
of the disaffected throughout Ireland, and he was perpetually sending petitions 
‘to the King, the Lords, aud the Commons, ‘praying them to “ put down 
Popery’ and, above all, to send O'Connell to the Tower.. When “ The Anti- 
dote” went the way of. many violent party journals—i e. “ to the wall,”—Sir 
Harcourt transferred his lucubrations to “The Warder,” another weak and. 
weekly organ of the Orange faction, -His haridwriting was the most illegible 
scrawl——just as if an intoxicated spider'had fallen into an inkstand, and then’ 
crawled and scrawled over a. sheet of paper. It-is to Sir Harcourt’s credit that 
in his charities, which were great, he made no distinction on account of reli-- 
gign; to want was sufficient claim on the benevolence of this most eccentric 
man. He was much liked by the Catholics whom he employed, and was on 
terms almost friendly with O’Connell, against whom he was always writing. —M. :

SIR HARCOURT LEES, 341 
~ Pabinet Ball, it may not be inapposite to say a word or two 
     
   
    
     For many years he was unknown to the public, and among 
his own immediate friends was regarded as-a harmless and 
newhat simple man, who could discuss a bottle of claret 
in ch better than a homily, a daring fox-hunter, and a good- 
mored divine, who would have passed without any sort of 
_ hote, but for certain flashes of singularity which occasionally 
' broke out, and exhibited points of character at variance with 
his general habits. What was the astonishment of all Dublin, 
- when it was announced that this plain and unobtrusive lover 
of the field was the author of a pamphlet filled with the most 
virulent and acrimonious matter against the religion of the 
_ eountry, and which almost amounted to a call on the Protest- 
* ant population to rise up in arms and extirpate Popery from 
the land! The incongruous images, the grotesque associations, 
and the mixture of drollery and absurdity, indicated some dis- 
temper in the writer’s mind; but the political passions which 
raged at the time prevented the Protestants from perceiving 
the symptoms of delirium in what they took for inspiration. 
Sir Harcourt became a public man. I had never‘seen him 
before the publication of his book, and was a good deal sur- 
prised to find that all this uproar had been produced by a little 
Jumpish man, who rather looked like a superannuated jockey 
than a divine, with an equestrian slouch in his walk, and the 
manger in his face, and with 4 mouth the graceful configuration 
of which appeared to have been formed by the humming of 
that stable-melody with which the application of the curry- 
comb is genérally accompanied.*   
* Sir Harcourt Lees dressed very much unlike a clergyman—or even a gen- 
tleman, A rusty and broad-brimmed hat covered his head. He shaved some- 
times, and the unfrequency did not improve his face. Round his neck was 
twisted a sort of rope of cambric, which probably had been white. ~ On his back 
was a shabby black coat, much too large for him, which appeared guiltless, since 
it was built, of the slightest coquetry with a clothes-brush, |The rest of his body 
was contained within a capacious pair of drab inexpressibles, his legs were en- 
cased i in riding-boots with light brown tops, and his hands were never “ pent 
ap” on.any occasion, in the “ Utica” of a pair of gloves. “He always carried a 
huge. horsewhip, and, whether he walked or rode, perpetually whistled “The 
Fox-hunter’s Jig,” —M.

“After looking at this ‘singular figure which the tutelary ge- 
nius of the Church had chosen for its residence, I gave up all 
my belief in physiognomy, and renounced Lavater for ever, 
T have since heard that the doctrines of Gall are by no means 
§0 much contradicted by the head of this celebrated person as 
the theory of the Swiss philosopher is refuted -by his face; and 
that divers protuberances are observable upon Sir Harcourt’s 
pericranium, in which vanity, ferocity, and ambition, together 
with certain other of the polemical faculties, may be easily 
discerned. Tt is even whispered that a disciple of Gall, who 
- recently: came over from Editiburgh, discovered some burhps 
upon the head of Doctor Magee, between which and the skull 
of Sir Harcourt there was a remarkable affinity. In the for-- 
“mer there was a much larger quantity of brain, but the theo- 
logical passions of Sir Harcourt are not less prominently -pro- 
‘nounced. It has been added, but I can not take upon myself 
to say with what truth, that a curious speculator in that fantas-- 
tic science has caused the skull of the last Sir Thomas Osborne 
to be dug up, and that the resemblance between Sir Harcourt 
_ and that eminent author is truly surprising. 
But I feel that I am digréssing. Enough to say that Sir 
Hareourt’s success in his first essay against Popery led to other 
achievements in controversy, and that hg was at length recog- 
nised beyond all dispute as the most appropriate champion of. 
the Irish Church. His whole character. may be summed ap in 
a single sentence of Swift: “He hath been poring so long upon 
Fox’s ‘ Book of Martyrs,’ that he imagines himself living in the 
reign of Queen Mary, and is resolved to set up as.a knight- ' 
errant against Popery.” 
The meeting between the Marquis Wellesley and this cele- 
brated person at the Tabinet Ball excited all my attention, I 
- did not perceive the latter, until a certain expression of :defi- 
ance, which suddenly came into the. Marquis’s face, directed | 
my notice to the quarter toward which he was looking, when I 
beheld, exactly opposite his Excellency, the chief though not 
very majestic pillar of the Establishment, The worthy Baro- 
* net had thrown an expression of derision into his countenance, . ”

-~ ton’s.snuff-box.* The Marquis might readily have conjectured 
‘that he was laughing at him, and that the recollection of his 
“Excellency’s exploits was not a little amusing. Seated upon 
-the throne, with his clinched hand resting upon his thigh, and 
. his marked and diplomatic visage protruded in all the intensity 
of expression for which it is remarkable, the most noble and 
-puissant Marquis shot his fine and indignant eyes into the soul 
’ of his antagonist; while Sir Harcourt, with a half-waggish and . 
half-malevolent aspect, blending the grin of an ostler with the 
acrimony of a divine, encountered: the lofty look of the chief 
governor of Ireland with a jocular disdain, and ‘gave him to 
understand that a man of his, theological mettle was not to be 
subjugated by afrown. This physiognomical encounter lasted 
for a few minutes; and but that Master Ellis, touching Sir Har- 
court upon the shoulder, relieved the Marquis from his glance, 
the result would in all probability rave been, that, indignant 
at the spirit of mockery that pervaded the features of the Bar- 
onet, his Excellency would have yielded to his emotions, and, 
starting up in a paroxysm of imaginary royalty, have exclaimed, 
“ Ay, every inch a king!” . .

the Duke of Leinster.} With the highest rank, and a magnifi-

or action, were remarkably mirth-exciting. The moment an audience saw’ his 
face, they felt compelled to laugh. He hed the merit, rare. in actors, of not 
playing to his audience; what he said and.did was apparently irrespective of 
any spectators. He was of a very melancholy temperament, though he caused 
wit and mirth in others. He realized a large fortune, at the London theatres. 
In 1831, he had one hundred pounds sterling a week from Madame Vestris, 
at the Olympic (a small theatre, in an inconvenient by-street), and remained 
on this engagement for the last six years of his professional life.. Ten years 
elapsed between his-retirement and his death, which took place in 1846, in his 
sixty-ninth year— M.

  cent estate, and with a name to which so mavy national recol- 
lections are painfully but endearingly allied, it must be con- 
fessed that the first peer in Ireland, notwithstanding so many 
‘claims upon the public ‘respect, is less sensibly felt, and pro- 
duces an impression. less distinct and palpable, than the re- 
_nowned champion of the Church. The one is at the head of 
the nobles and the other of the Protestanis of Ireland; and 
however insane the alacrity of Sir Harcourt may appear, there 
is something in enthusiasm, be it genuine or affected, which is 
preferable to the inactive honesty and the inoperative integrity 
of the Duke. The latter is descended from the first Norman set- 
tlers in Ireland. The Fitzgeralds gradually became attached 
to thé country, and were designated as the ultra-Irish, from the. 
* barbarous nationality, of which, in the course of that series of 
rebellions ‘dignified by the name of Irish history, they gave 
repeated proof. They were of that class of insurgents who 
earned the ignominious appellation of “Hilernis ipsis Hibernio- 
res:” Trecollect to have seen their pedigree upon a piece of mould- 
ering parchment, which was produced at a trial in Waterford, 
connected with the royalties of Dromona, and had been brought 
by a messenger from the Tower in London. It was a very - 
remarkable document. The words “ attainted” or “ beheaded” 
were annexed, to the names of more than half the members of 
this ‘illustrious house. : 
The love of Ireland appears to have been a family disease, 
representative of this house was created Harl of Kildare, in 1316, and the hel- der of this Earldom was made Viscount, Leinster, in the English ‘peerage, in 
1745-'6. The Irish Marquisate of Kildare was conferred, in 1761, and the 
Dukedom in 1766. The present Duke of Leinster, who lives mostly in England, 
has always professed Whig principles, which are usually anti-Irish, Born -in 
1791, the Duke was only in his seventh year, when ‘his gallant and unfortunate 
uncle, Lord Edward Fitygerald, perished, in 1798. So ‘much undistinguished 
has the Duke’s life been (the Irish significantly call him “a chip in porridge’) 
that the only noticeable thing connected with him, recorded on the tablets of 
my memory, is the anecdote of his visiting Beau Brummell, at his retreat in 
Caen. The Duke, who was fresh from Paris, where he had availed himself of 
the adorning aid of a Fronch tailor, asked the Beau what he thought of his coat? Brammell, taking hold of the collar of it delicately, betwoen his finger and thumb, smiled contemptuously and drawied out, “ My dear fellow, do you 
call this thing —a coat 1”— M. :

‘and to have descended to the unfortunate Lord Edward as a 
malady of the heart, although the sanguinary record of the 
virtues of his house did not include his name; but it was — 
impossible to look upon that memorial of the scaffold, without 
recalling the memory of the celebrated person whose failure

.* Lord Edward Fitzgerald, whose tragic fate has excited much sympathy, 
“was only thirty-five years old, in 1798, when the Irish insurrection broke out. 
He served in America as nide-de-camp to Lord Rawdon, and om his return 
home, in 1783, obtained a seat in the Irish House of Commons, which he did 
not long retain, finding legislation insipid. He returned to America, where 
he imbibed republican principles. William Cobbett, who was Serjeant-Major in 
his regiment, was discharged through his influence, and described him as “a 
most humane and excellent man, and the only real honest officér he ever knew 
in the army.” On-Lord Edward’s return, in 1790, he re-entered Parliament: vis- 
ited Paris, during the Revolution, got acquainted with Paine; desired his 
mother to address him as “ Le Citoyen Edward Fitzgerald,” assisted at a pub- 
Ve dinner in celebration of the successes of the French armies; publicly re- 
nounced his title; declared himself a republican; and, in consequence, was 
dismissed the British army. He married Pamela, supposed to be Madame de 
Genlis’ daughter by the Duke of Orleans (Egalité) ; returned to Dublin ;-became

Viceroy issued a proclamation; made a Parliamentary attack on the Viceroy

by the Crown, and one of Curran’s best speeches was against the injustice of 
, their assuming the guilt of a man neither tried nor conviéted, and of debarring

which elicited a sonnet of thanks from Lord Byron. The widow of Lord Ed-

of his estates, he was an object of great national interest. 
The associations connected with his name had already secured 
him the partialities of the country. -His frank and open air, 
the unaffected urbanity of his manners, the kindness and cor- 
diality which distinguished his address, and an. expression of 
dignified good nature in his physiognomy, brought back the 
recdllection of Lord Edward, and gave to his young kinsman 
a share in the affectionate respect with which the guilty patri- 
otism of that chivalrous nobleman is regarded in Ireland. 
-Few were sufficiently rash to desire that the Duke of Leinster 
should engage in an enterprise so little likely to be successful, 
ag that which cost Lord Edward his life. Almost all men had 
become sensible of the hopelessness of such an undertaking : 
but it was expected that, while the chief of the house of 
Fitzgerald would abstain from any criminally adventurous’ 
speculation, he would, notwithstanding, place himself -at the 
head’ of the popular party; that he would rally round ‘him 
the friends of the. country; that he would extend to good 
principles the authority of his rank, and rescue the spirit of | 
Trish whiggism from the scoff with which it had been. the 
fashion in the higher circles to deride it. 
A scope of political usefulness was unquestionably given to 
the Duke. It would have been easy for him to raise up a 
‘legitimate and salutary opposition to the abuses of the local 
"government, which were at that time excessive, and to have 
awed the viceregal despotism of the Duke of Richmond into 
moderation. There was enough of public virtue. left among 
the aristocracy, to turn it to good practical account, if there 
had been any man capable of giving it a direction; and of all -~ 
others, the young Duke of Leinster, from his paramount rank 
and hereditary station, seemed to be calculated to take the ° 
- honorable lead. What might not a Duke of Leinstex, with 
even ordinary abilities, and with an active, steadfast, and 
: energetic mind, accomplish'in this country? He might place 
“himself at once in the front of a vast and ardent population, 
and become not only the protector of the Catholics, but the 
divector of the whole body of liberal Protestants in Ireland. 
The distinctions of sect would, under his influence, be merged

4n'the community of country, and all religious animosities give 
“Gway to a comprehensive and philosophical sentiment of nation- 
_ ality. He would be the point of contact, at which the con- 
‘tending factions might meet and cohere together. - His rank 
and. property. would attract the men who profess illiberal 
° “opinions as much out of fashion as out of prejudice; while the 
“democratic parts would find in his name and blood a sufficient 
_ guaranty for his fidelity to Ireland. Having been once asso- 
“elated in a stiicter intimacy, it is likely that the enthusiasts on 
“both sides would lay down a large portion of their antipathies, 
Sand acquire a feeling of forbearance toward each other. Pa _ 
tisanship ‘would in a little time subside, and “Catholics and 
Orangemen would: enter into a pacific confederacy for the 
public good. 
Such a junction, formed under the auspices of a Duke of 
Leinster, would secure to him the respect of a wise, and the 
fears of a corrupt administration. His opinions among the 
hereditary counsellors of the crown would carry a paramount 
authority. His voice in the senate would be that of seven mil- 
lions of his fellow-countrymen ; Ireland would speak through 
him. The consciousness of the minister that, in times of 
difficulty and.of danger, the Irish people could readily find a 
man who would insist upon justice—who, sustained by a 
‘united population, could. insure whatever he required — would | 
_ instruct the most, arbitrary statesman in the anticipating wis- 
- dom of concession. It is difficult to conceive :a more lofty or a 
more useful part, than that which it. would be easy for a Duke 
of Leinster to perform; and the facility with which this ideal 
picture would be realized, induces the more regret that a per- 
son surrounded with such numerous opportunities ‘of doing 
good should have omitted the splendid occasions thrown by 
' birth and fortune in his way. He has voluntarily consigned 
himself to oblivion. 
It required, indeed, that he should make a sort of éffort to- 
be forgotten. He has at last succeeded in sinking out of the 
‘recollection of the public. He has, if I may so say, dived into 
Lethe, from which -he hardly ever lifts bis “head. The first 
injudicious step which he adopted was the sale of his magnifi-

cent mansion in Merrion Square.. It surpasses any private 
residence in London, and father resembles the palace of a 
Venetian senator than the house of a British subject. That 
vast structure, upon which enormous sums had been expended 
by his father, was a perpetual intimation of the importance of 
the Duke, as long as it was called Leinster House; but after 
he had sold it to the Dublin Socioty, and its original designa- 
tion was laid aside, a memorial of the family was wanting, 
which the Duke’s political conduct was not calculated to sup- 
ply. He was not contented with this disposal of his family 
mansion, but took a small house in Dominick street, which he 
dignified with the appellation of the Duke of Leinster’s Office. 
Many ascribed the sale of his palace (for such it might be 
called) to a penurious tendency; but, although the Duke is a 
prudent man, he is not, I believe, addicted to that most ignoble’ 
of all vices, and avarice forms no part of his character. ‘The 
trath is, that the Duke of Leinster is wholly insensible’ to 
fame; and such is his aversion to publicity, that I could never 
bring myself to give any credit to the statement in Harriet 
‘Wilson’s Memoirs, that his Grace was in the habit of standing 
behind her carriage. Hé has such a horror of the general 
eye, that I hold it to be impossible that he could ever haye 
achieved a piece of ‘such open and undisguised gallantry as 
the modern Aspasia has been pleased to ascribe to him. 
After having sold his house, the Duke retired to the woods 
and solitudes of Carton.t There he buried-himself from the

- eountry. Having a turn for mechanics, he provided himself 
-with a large assortment of carpenters’ tools, and beguiled the 
"*= tedium of existence with occupations by which his arms were 
~ put into requisition, There is not a better sawyer in the. 
eounty of Kildare. As you wander through the forests on his 
. demesne, you ‘occasionally meet a vigorous young. woodman, 
. with his shixt tucked up to his shoulders, while he lays the axe 
‘to the trunk of some lofty tree that totters beneath his stroke. 
On approaching, you perceive a handsome face, flushed with, 
exercise and health, and covered with perspiration. Should_ 
you enter into conversation with him, he will throw off a few 
jovial words between every descent of the axe; and, if he 
should pause in his task for breath; will hail you in the tone 
of good-humored fellowship. He sets to his work again; ’ 
while you pursue your path through the woodlands, and hear 
' from the ranger of the forest that you have just seen no less 
-, a person than his Grace himself. 
In the midst of these innocent employments, the Duke of 
Leinster passes away a life which ought to be devoted to 
higher purposes. It is with the utmost difficulty that he is 
occasionally dragged out of his retreat, and consents, some 
once a-year, to fill the chair at a public meeting. But he 
takes no part in the deliberations or the measures of popular 
- assemblies, for which he entertains an wiaffected distaste, and 
hurries back to his domestic occipations again. The result 
‘has been, that he not only holds no place in the public estima- 
tion beyond that which his private virtues confer upon him, 
but he is without any influence at the Castle. Shortly after 
- Lord Wellesley came to Ireland, the Duke called ‘to pay his 
respects to his Excellency, who sent him an intimation that he 
was at the moment too busily engaged to see him, but that, in 
ease he called again, he should be happy to receive his Grace. 
At the Tabinet Ball (from which I have made a wide 
digression, into somewhat too serious, if not extraneous mat- 
ter), it was easy to observe. that the Duke of Leinster, sur- 
rounded ‘as: he, was by all the provincial rank and wealth of 
Dablin, ‘was not ai object of much public concern. As he

sningled among the various cireles in the saloon, some person, 
who chanced to know him, just mentioned, “There is the Duke 
of Leinster ;” while his Grace, neither attracting nor caring ~ 
“for any further notice, passed on without heed to’ some other 
\ part of the room. How different an impression would he liave 
produced, had he taken the more active and intrepid part, 
to'which his fortunes appeared. to invite him! .The mock 
regality of a lord-lieutenant would fade at once before him. 
The representative of a nation would stand superior to. the 
delegate of the king.. But, in drawing this contrast, it would _ 
be an injustice not to add, that, after all, the Duke of Leinster 
has a right to make a selection of happiness for himself. He 
has no ambition. Nature has-not mixed that mounting quality 
in“his blood which teaches men to aspire to greatness, and 
_ makes them impatient of subordination. If he is deficient in 
energy, and is without: the temperament necessary for high 
enterprise, he is adorned. by many gentle and perhaps redeem- 
ing virtues. His life is blameless in every domestic relation ;. 
and if he is not admired, he is prized, at least by all those 
who are acquainted. with him. He looks, and I am convinced. 
he is, an exceedingly happy man; and has at all events one 
of the chief means of felicity, in the amiable and accomplished 
woman to whom he is united.

of her.* Few persons are more esteemed and loved than she 
is, There is a charm in her kind and good-hearted manners, 
- which engages the partiality of those about her, and converts 
that respect which is due to her station into regard. I have 
never seen any lady of her distinction in society so wholly. 
free from assumption. There is the enchantment of sincerity 
in her sweet demeanor, which, in the manners of the great, is. 
above every other charm. She is not beautiful ; but there is 
about her— . . 
“ Something than beauty dearer, . 
That for a face not beautiful does more ; 
Than beauty for the fairest face can do.” 
A look of benignity, united with a pleasant and vivacious 
smile, makes you forget a certain want of regularity in her 
features. I do not quite like her deportment and gait. There 
seems to be a weakness in her limbs, which prevents a steadi- 
ness and measure of movement, necessary for a perfect grace- 
fulness of head. But it is only after a minute observation, 
made in the spirit which is “nothing if not critical,” that any 
such imperfections are discerned, and they are speedily forgot- 
ten in the feeling of kindness which her noble gentleness can 
not fail to produce. 
It was amusing to observe the contrast between the unosten- 
tatious affability of her Grace, and the factitious loftiness of - 
the other titled patronesses of the ball. Lady Wellesley had 
* nominated a certain number of vice-presidents of the dance, 
who were directed to appear with a head-dress of ostrich-

influence of the civic authorities, and was determined to con- 
ciliate the leading members of the powerfal body by which he

. His father took, from the earliest period, the most anxious care 
‘of his mind, upon which he set a high value. I have been 
‘assured by a gentleman, whose authority I could not for a 
moment question, that the late Mr. Grattan, in presenting his 
‘son to his tutor at Trinity College, expressed his conviction of 
‘his ‘superior qualifications, and said that he hoped to. leave 
“his Henry” as a noble bequest to his country. The great 
- patriot saw in the mind of his son what Doctor.Johnson calls 
“the latent possibilities of excellence ;” and he was anxious, 
‘as well from a national as from a parental feeling,-to bring 
them forth. Mr. Henry Grattan, while in college, enjoyed the 
double advantage of an excellent system of public education, 
"and of having a domestic pattern of the admirable in eloquence 
and in patriotism perpetually before his eyes. His ‘career in 
the University was highly honorable; and in the Histoxical 
Society, which, if it were not a school of genuine oratory, was 
at all events a useful nursery of declamation, obtained univer- 
sal plaudits. Having taken his degrees with credit, he entered 
the Temple, and went through the usual masticating process, 
by which the British youth are initiated into the mysteries of 
the law. -He became, while in’ London, a member of the 
society called “ The Academic,” which holds debates upon all 
the entities, and distinguished himself by a force and strenu- 
, ousness of eloeution to which that debating assocation was little 
accustomed. Upon his return to Dublin, after having gone 
_ through his two years’ novitiate, and eaten his way to the Bar, 
he dedicated himself to political rather than to forensic pur- 
suits. His illustrious father had been unkindly, and, in my 
,judgment, ungratefully treated by the Trish Catholics. Mr. 
‘Henry Grattan resented these injuries with more asperity than 
it -was, perhaps, judicious to have expressed, and ,involved 
‘himself in some personal altercations, which are now happily 
_ forgotten. Having a turn for composition, but not-being suf.

a prosecution.* He had a narrow escape from the fangs of 
” Mr. Saurin, and was, I believe, obliged to remunerate the pro- 
‘prietor of the newspaper at no little cost. The great aggrava- 
‘tiot of his satire was its truth.. His celebrated father was, it 
“ig understood, a good deal annoyed by the results of these first _ 
essays iti invective, which obliged him to pay to the King: a 
portion of what he had received from the people. 
Until his death, his son did not come directly forward upon. 
the political stage; but when that great man had been depos- 
ited in Westminster Abbey (neither Grattan nor Curran is 
buried in Irish earth);1 his son offered -himself as a candidate ~ 
for the representation of the city of Dublin. It ought to have 
descended to him as an inheritance. He appeared on the 
hustings with the incomparable services of his illustrious father | 
as his adyocate. He combined with the legitimate. claims 
: derived from go illustrious a name great personal merit. . Yet 
so high ran the prejudices of party, that Master Ellis, whose 
only title arose from his hostility to the Catholics, was- pre-_ 
ferred to him, and the services of the best and. most lofty- 
minded Irishman that ever lived were shamefully forgotten.

Yeminiscences from “Joe Miller,” which Alderman was 
pouring, as original anecdotes, into his ear. The new and 
graceful pleasantry of the worthy corporator appeared to throw 
Mr. Grattan into convulsions of merriment, though now and

+ sion of weariness coming over his face, and that effort over the 
-. oscitating organs, with which an incipient yawn is smothered

“My attention was suddenly diverted from this political 
téte-a-téte, by an ejaculation of ennui, which was uttered by a 
young English officer,* who was lounging, with two of his. 
* Yn 1823-24, a cavalry regiment called the Tenth Hussars, formed part of the 
_garrison of Dublin. Its officers were chiefly, if not wholly members of aristocrat- 
ic families in England, and looked down with unconcealed contempt upon every 
grade of society in the Irish Metropolis. They condescended, sometimes, merely 
pour passer le temps— to partake of dinners and appear at balls given by the 
“natives” in Dublin. Here they usually conducted themselves on the ‘ Nil 
admirari” principle, and showed what magnificpnt ideas of their own impor- 
tance were entertained—by themselves, On one occasion, the lady of the 
house at which there was a rout, good-naturedly asked one of these officers 
whether she should introduce him to a charming portner for a quadrille? The 
reply, delivered with a pause between each word, was, “Thank you, but, the 
Tenth don’t daunce!” Another time, an Irish pecress told one of these carpet- 
Anights that a lovely young woman near him was heiress to an immense for- 
“tne, and asked if he would not like to make her acquaintance, and try. to win 
the prize? “I’m not a marrying man, myself,” was the reply, “but, I shall 
mention her at mess !”’-—The ex¢ellent comedy (by Croly, the poet and divine), .

military compatriots, through the room. This triumvirate of 
coxcombs trailed themselves, with an .affected listlessness, 
along, and vented their depreciation of Ireland in elaborately 
English intonations. They were apparently anxious to give 
‘intimation of their superior country 5 for they put more. of 
"their national accent into their voices than well-bred English- 
men are accustomed to do, and seemed vain of: the anti-Irish 
drawl, in which the spirit of mingled tedium and of derision 
was expressed. 
One of them was a handsome aud well-formed fellow, the 
manliness .of whose . person made a singular contrast with the 
. artificial effeminacy with which his countenance was invested. 
. He lisped in a deep guttural voice, and played with his whiskers 
as if they were the bow-strings of Cupid. I was not a little 
amused by the languid complacency with which this athletic 
Narcissus seemed to contemplate himself, His compaionon 
the right, was the exact reverse of the captain in manner and~- 
in aspect; for, with a feeble and fragile form, and the cheek 
‘of a woman, he put on an air of warlike defiance, and looked 
“ as Madame Vestris would in the part of Pistol. The other 
“was a huge booby in gold and searlet, with great meanlegs 
eyes falling out of their sockets, and with features thrown i ina 
chaos together. ~ 
. | His business appeared to be to-grin at the captain’s- wit, and 
turn up a pair of dilated nostrils, through which he snorted his 
disdain of Ireland. hese gentlemen were joined by an old 
officer, who was evidently a man of rank, before whom they 
immediately assumed an aspect of deference: like themselves 
he was an Englishman; but of a very different sort. He had 
the marks of long service on his face, which was of a strongly 
martial cast. There was no exhibition of haughty fiercetess 
in his air; -but his-fine intelligent eye k had that calm intensity 
of observation which’ denotes the “ coup-d’ail militaire.” . His 
features were aquiline, his color was tinged by the Spanish 
sun, and his physiognomy united great ‘natural sweetness of 
expression with the familiar habits of command. He said that 
the had been greatly delighted with all that he had seen, and 
had no notion that Dublin could produce such a display of

Epo ‘thie loss of their hearts, and the likelihood of their carry- 
ing ‘back Ivish wives to England. Against the possibilities of 
auch‘a misadventure in matrimony they veherently protested, 
and: enlarged upon the huge feet and monstrosities of ankle 
exhibited by the Irish fair. 
‘eM ponderous lady, the wife of an honest burgher, was 
bouncing at the moment through the mazes of the third set, 
and geemed to be in that interesting condition which a lady 
of fashion, in “The Vicar of Wakefield,” describes as ‘being 
#gll over in’a muck of sweat.” To make the matter worse, 
shé took it into her head that the officers had selected her as 
_ ah object of admiration; and throwing a look of gréasy ama-— 
: tiveness into her face, renewed her efforts at the graceful with 
a desperate agility. I felt some mortification ‘at the oppor- 
tunity for ridicule, which was afforded to the young English- 
men by this piece of animated corpulency ; but I was relieved 
by the elder officer, who pointed to a young lady in an adjoin- 
ing circle of dancers, whom it was'only nécessary to look at 
for an instant, in order to feel the influence which perfect 
beauty will create in the rudest mind. With all their disposi- 
tion to find fault, the party of military critics at once admitted 
~ that the taste of the old colonel could not be impeached, and ' 
that such a face and figure would almost justify the violation 
of the regimental rule, “not to marry in Ireland.” : 
The impression produced by the girl whom the venerable: 
veteran had selected, diverted my attention from the com- 
mentaries of the English officers. Though “not tall, her figure 
had the porfection of youthful symmetry. Her limbs were of 
the finest mould, and with the round plumpness of health, 
united an aérial lightness ‘and grace. The beautiful epithet 
which Prospero applies to the sweet minister of his spells, 
seemed to belong to this fascinating person, who looked as 
“delicate” as Ariel. Her dress was simple: it consisted 
_metely of a pink tabinet, without decoration. A wreath of 
flowers bound the black hair, the ringlets of which just shaded 
the marble of ‘her forehead, but fell in  ambrosial plenty” 
behind. _ Her features,, although somewhat minute, had the

Siddonian character. Thought and sensibility were mingled 
like the white and red roses in her cheek. Her eyes were of 
the finest black; hut, although they were both sweet and bril- 
liant, there was an expression about them which Iwas at first 
at some loss to define. I afterward perceived that it arose 
merely from a shortness of sight. I could have remained, as 
Oroonoko says, gazing “ whole nights” upon her, when happily, 
perhaps, for as much heart as yet abides within me, her chape- 
ron warned her, at the conclusion of the dance, that it was 
time to retire. The morning, indeed, had just begun to show 
a face scarcely more beautifal, and, as if jealous of such a rival 
as Miss O’C. , admonished her to depart.* She drew. her 
shawl round her bosom,.with a: grace which Canova should 
- have turned to marble, and disappeared amidst the erowd who 
were pouring out of the room. I remained for some moments 
- in that state of revery, which, in my younger days, I mistook 
for romance, with the image of the lady before-me. ~I was 
yoused from my dream, however, by the recollection: that I was 
past thirty, and that it was five o'clock. The company were 
gone. I stood alone, where hundreds had recently met ina 
joyous and brilliant concourse; and I felt how justly, as well 
as beautifully, Moore has compared the. Tecollections: of our 
youth to the sensations of one .

  THOLIC LEADERS AND ASSOCIATIONS. 
  ¢ I now propose to give some account of the various bodies 
which have successively managed the coricerns of the Catho-~ 
lies, and of the individuals who have.taken the most active 
part in their affairs.* - 
Catholic Associations have been of very long existence. ‘The 
Confederates of 1642 were thé precursors of the Association of 
1828. . The Catholics- entered into a league for the assertion 
of their civil rights. They opened their proceedings in the 
city of Kilkenny, where the house is shown in which their as- 
_ semblies were held. They established two different, bodies to 
. represent the Catholic people—namely, a general assembly, 
and. a supreme council. The first included all the lords, pre- 
lates, and gentry, of the Catholic body; and the latter con- 
sisted of a few select members, chosen by the general assembly 
out of the different provinces, who acted as a kind of executive, 
and were recognised as their supreme magistrates. These 
were “the Confederates.” Carte, in his “Life of Ormonde,” 
calls them “an Association.” He adds that the first result of 
their union was’ an ‘address to the King [Charles I.], in which 
_ they demanded justice, and besought him “ timely to assign a 
place where they might with. safety express their grievances.” 
On receiving this address, the King issued a commission under 
the great seal, empowering the commissioners to treat with the .

1828, and was marked “To be continued’—an, unfulfilled promise, probably 
caused by Mr. Sheil’s “ invasion of Kent” Gramediately after it was written),

Confederates, to receive in writing what they had to say or 
‘propound, and to transmit it to his Majesty. 
This commission was dated the 1ith of January, 1642. Or- 
monde says, in oné of his letters, that “the Lords Justices 
used every endeavor to prevent the success of the commission, 
and to impede the pacification of the country.” The supreme 
_ council of “the Confederates” was sitting at Ross, and a de- 
spatch was transmitted by the Lords Justices to them, in which 
the phrase “ odious rebellion” was .applied to their proceedings. 
At this’ insult they took fire—they had arms im their hands, 
. and returned an answer, in which they stated that “it would 
be 4 meanness ‘beyond expression in them who fought in the 
condition of loyal subjects, to come in the repute of rebels to 
‘set down their grievances. We take God to witness,” added 
. they, “ that there are no limits set to the scorn and infamy that 
are cast ‘apon ‘us, and we will be in the esteem of loyal sub- 
jects, or die to’ a man!” — A terrible civil war ensued. On the 
. 28th of July, 1646, Lord Digby: published a proclamation of 
-peace with the Confederates. ‘The Pope's Nuncio, Renuceini, 
induced the former to reject the terms. .The war raged on. ~

Lord Carteret, intimates his apprehension at- this first act since .

- ‘the Revolution, of the Catholies as a community ; and imme- 
diately after they were deprived of the elective franchise by 
the Ist George IL, ch. 9, sec. 7. The next year came a bill 
which was devised by Primate Boulter, to prevent Roman 
"Catholics from acting as solicitors. : 
“Here we find, perhaps, the origin of the Catholic rent. . Sev- 
eral Catholics in Cork and Dublin raised ‘a subscription to ‘de- 
fray the expense of opposing the bill, and an apostate priest 
“gave information of this conspiracy (for so it was called) to 
bring in the Pope and the Pretender. The transaction was 
referred to a committee of the House of Commons, who actn- 
ally reported that five pounds had been collected, and resolved 
‘that “it appeared to them that, under pretence of opposing 
heads of bills, sums of money had been collected, and a fund. 
established by the Popish inhabitants of this kingdom, highly 
detrimental to the Protestant interest.” 
These were.the first efforts of the Roman Catholics to obtain 
relief, or rather to prevent the imposition of additional burdens, 
They did not, however, act through the medium of a commit- 
tee or association.. It was in the year 1757, upon the appoint- 
ment of the Duke of Bedford to the viceroyalty of Ireland, 
~ that a Committee was for the first time formed, of which the 
. great model, perhaps, was to be discovered in “the Confeder- 
ates” of 1642; and ever since that period the affairs of the 
body have been more or less conducted through the medium 
, of assemblies of a similar character. The Committee of 1757 
may be justly accounted the parent of the great Convention” 
which has since brought its enormous seven millions into ac- 
tion, The members of the Committee formed in that year were 
delegated and actually chosen by the people. They were a 
Parliament invested with all the authority of representation. 
Their first assembly was held in a tavern called “'The Globe,” 
in Essex street, Dublin. After some sittings, Mr. Wyse, of 
Waterford, the ancestor of the gentleman who has lately made . 
80 conspicuous a figure in Catholic politics, proposed a plan of 
- more extended delegation, which was.at_onee adopted. In 
1759, this body was brought into recognition by the state; for, 
upon the alarm of the invasion of Conflans, the Roman Catho-

ic: Corhmittee prepared a loyal address, which was presented 
to Jobn Ponsonby, the then Speaker, by Messrs. Crump and 
‘M'Dermot, two delegates, to be transmitted by him to the 
Lord-Lieutenant. A-gracious answer -to this address was re- 
turned, and published in the “Gazette.” The Speaker sum- 
moned the two delegates.to the House: of Commons, and the 
-address was then read. Mr. M‘Dermot, in the name of his 
body, thanked the Speaker for his condescension. 
This was the first instance in which the political existence 
of the Irish Catholics was acknowledged, through the medium 
* of their Comimittee. This recognition, however, was not fol- 
lowed by any immediate relaxation of the penal code. Twelve 
years clapsed before any legislative measure was introduced . 
-which indicated. a more favorable disposition toward the Cath- 
‘lic community, if, indeed, the 11th and 12th of George III. 
caf he considered as having conferred any boon upon that de- 
_ graded people. The: statute was entitled, “An act for. the . 
reclaiming of unprofitable bogs ;” and it enabled Papists to 
take fifty acres of unprofitable bog for sixty-one years, with 
half an acre of arable land adjoining, provided that it should 
jhot-be within one ‘mile of atown. The provisions of this act 
“of, Parliament indicate to what a low condition the great mass 
of. the population had been. reduced, and illustrate the justice 
‘of Swift’s remark, that the Papists had become mere hewers 
of wood aid drawers of water. However, the first step was” 
taken in the progress of concession; and every day the might 
of numbers, even destitute of all territorial possession, pressed 
more and more upon the Government. 
‘The Catholic Committee pursued its course, and in 1777 ex- 
torted ‘the ‘first: important relaxation ; for they acquired the 
right of: taking leases for nine hundred and nincty-nine years, 
and their landed property was made descendible and devisa- 
ble, in the same manuer as Protestant -estates. In 1782, the . 
difficulties of the Government augmented, ‘and ‘the Catholic 
Committee pressed the consideration of their claims upon the 
Ministry. By the 21st and 22d of George III, Papists were 
- enabled to purchase and dispose of landed property, and were 
placed, in that respect, upon ‘an equality with Protestants.

-Thus they were rashly left beyond the state, but were furtfished 
: : with that point from which the evgine of their power has been 
‘since wielded against it. 
From 1782 until 1793, no further concessions-were emade; but 
the Catholics increased in power, until, in 1792, their Com. 
. mittee assumed a formidable aspect. Theobald Wolfe Tone, 
in his Memoirs, gives the following account of what. may be 
_called the Association of that period: “The General Commit- 
tee of the Catholics, which, since the year 1792, has:made a 
~ distinguished figure in the politics of Ireland, was a body com- - 
posed of their bishops, their.country gentlemen, and of a cer- 
tain number of merchants and traders, all resident in Dublin, 
“but named by the Catholics in the different towns corporate to 
represent them. The original object of this institution was to 
obtain the repeal of a partial and oppressive tax called Quar- 
terage, which was levied -on the Catholics only; and the 
Government, which found the Committee at first a convenient 
instrument on some occasions, connived at their existence. So 
degraded was the Catholic mind at the period of the forma- 
tion of their Committee, and long after, that they were happy 
to be allowed to go up to the Castle with an abominable slavish 
address to each successive Viceroy ; of. which, moreover, until 
“the accession of the Duke of Portland in 1782, so little notice 
-was taken, that his Grace was the first who condescended to 
give them an answer [N. B. this is a mistake]; and, indeed, 
for above twenty years, the sole business of. the genera] Com- 
mittee was to prepare and. deliver in those records of’ their 
depression’ ‘The effort which an honest indignation had called 
forth at the time of the Volunteer Convention of 1783, seemed 
to have exhausted. their strength, and they sunk back into 
their primitive nullity. Under this appearance of apathy, how- 
ever a new spitit was gradually arising in the body, owing 
principally to the exertions and the example of one man, John 
Keogh, to whose services his country, and more especially. the 
Catholics, are singularly indebted. In fact, the downfall of. 
feudal tyranny was acted in little on the theatre ofthe General

mercial interest, rising in wealth and power, was preparing, by 
| degrees, to throw off the yoke, in the imposing, or at least 
continuing of which, the leaders of the body, I mean the pre- 
lates and the aristocracy, to their disgrace be it spoken, were 
ready to concur. Already had those leaders, acting in obedi- 
ence to the orders of the Government, which held them in 
fetters, suffered one or two signal defeats in the Committee, 
owing principally to the talents and address of John Keogh: 
the parties began to be defined, and a sturdy democracy of 
‘-new men, with bolder views and stronger talents, soon super- 
seded the timid counsels and slavish measures of the ancidnt 
aristocracy.” 
Until John ‘Keogh appeared among them, and asserted that 
_ Superiority in public assemblies which genius and enterprise 
will always obtain over the sluggish pride of inert and apathe- 
tic rank, the proceedings of the Committee had been, as Tone 
here intimates, under the control of the Catholic aristocracy. 
‘hey were the sons of men who had lived in the period of 
utter Catholic degradation; and many of them remembered 
the time when. the privileges of a gentleman were denied to a. 
Catholic nobleman, and a Popish peer was not allowed to wear 
asword! They had contrived to retain their properties by 
' expedients which were calculated to debase their political — 
spirit ; and it is not very wonderful that even when the period 
had arrived when they might hold themselves erect, they did 
‘not immediately divest themselves of that stoop, which the 
long habit of bearing burthens had of necessity given. 
Accordingly, they opposed the measures of a bold and ad- 
venturous character; which the plebeian members of the Com- 
mittee had. suggested; and at last adopted. the preposterous 
expedient of seceding fromthe body. Wolfe Tone, who was 
secretary to the Committee, and-“whose evidence is of great 
value, gives the following account of this incident :—* The 
Catholics,” he says, ‘ were rapidly advancing i in political spirit 
and ivformation.. Every month, every day, as the Revolution 
in France went prosperously forward, added to their courage 
and their force, and the hour séemed at last arrived when, after 
‘a dreary oppression of above one hundred years, they were

nce more to appear in the political theatre of their country. 
They saw the brilliant prospect of success, which events in 
France open to their view, and they determined to avail them- 
selves with promptitude of that opportunity which never 
> seturng, to those who omit it. For this, the active members of 
the General Committee resolved to sct on foot an immediate 
application to Parliament, praying for a repeal of the penal 
_Taws, . The fitst difficulty they had to surmount arose in their own 
body; their peers, their gentry, as they affected to call them- 
selves, and their prelates, either reduced or intimidated by 
“ Government, gave the measure all possible opposition ; and, at" 
length, after a long contest, in which both parties strained 
every nerve, and produced the whole of their strength, the 
question was decided on a division in the Committee, by a 
" majority of at least six to one, in favor of the intended appli- 
cation. The triumph of the young democracy was complete; 
but, though thé aristocracy was defeated, they were not yet 
entirely broken down. By the instigation of Government, 
they had the meanness to secede from the General Committee, 
to disown their acts, and even to publish in the papers, that 
they did not wish to embarrass the Government, by advancing 
their claims of emancipation. 
“Tt is difficult to conceive such a degree of political degrada- 
tion. But what will not the tyranny of an execrable system 
produce in time? Sixty-eight gentlemen, individually of high 
spirit, were found, who publicly; and in a body, deserted their 
party, and their own just claims, and even sanctioned this 
pitiful desertion by the authority of their signatures. Such an 
effect had the operation of the penal laws on the Catholics of 
Ireland, as proud a race as any in all Europe!” 
The secession of the aristocracy did not materially enfeeble 
the people. New exertions were made by the democracy. A 
plan of more general and faithful representation was devised 
by Mz. M’Keon, which converted the Committee into a com- 
plete Catholic parliament. Members were elected for every 
county in Iveland, and regularly came to Dublin to attend the 
meetings of this extraordinary convention. At the head of

366 CATHOLIC LEADERS. 
~this assembly was the individual of whom Wolfe Tone makes 
such honorable mention, John Keogh. 
He was, in the years 1792 and 1793, the unrivalled leader 
of the Catholic body. He belonged to the middle class of life, 
and kept a silk-mercer’s shop in Parliament street, where he 
had accumulated considerable wealth. His education had 
corresponded with his originat rank, and he was without the 
graces and refinements of literature; but .le had a vigorous 
and energetic mind, a great command of pure diction, a striking 
and simple earnestness of manner, great powers of elucidation, 
singular dexterity, and an ardent, intrepid, and untameable 
energy of character. His figure was rather upon a small scale; 
but he had great force of countenance, an eye of peculiar bril- . 
liancy, and an expression in which vehement feelings and the 
deliberative faculties were combined. He was without a-com- 
petitor in the arts of debate; occasionally more eloquent 
speeches were delivered in the Catholie convention, but John 
Keogh was sure to carry. the measure which he had proposed, 
however encountered with apparently superior powers of decla- 
mation. . 
Wolfe Tone has-greatly praised him in several passages of 
his work; but there are occasional remarks in the diary which 
* was kept by that singular person, when secretary to the Oatho- 
lic Committee, in which statements unfavorable to John Keogh 
are expressed. This diary was never intended for publication, 
and is written in a very easy and familiar style. He calls ~ 
John Keogh by the name of “Gog,” and represents him as 
exceedingly subtle, dexterous, and cunning, and anxious to 
such an extent to do everything himself, as to oppose good 
Measures when they were suggested by others. He might 
have had this fault, but as Wolfe T'one wrote down -the 
ephemeral impressions which were made upon him by ecea- 
sional incidents in his journal, it is more reasonable to look at- 
the general result of the observations on this able man, which 
are to be found in his autobiography, than to the remarks 
which were committed every, day to his tablets. As secretary” 
to the Catholics, he was himself liable to be sometimes thwarted. 
by My. Keogh 3 and it is likely that, under the influence of -
-P-A-G-E-368
JOHN KEOGH. 367 
some small annoyances, he has set down in his journal some 
© strictures upon his friend. 
- Afterward, however, when Wolfe Tone was in’ France, he 
: reverts, in the diary subsequently kept by him, to John Keogh, 
and, when far away, voluntarily writes a high encomium upon © 
the leader of the Irish Catholics. It is to be collected from 
his work, thet John Keogh had a deep hostility to England, 
and” that he was disposed to favor the enterprise of Wolfe 
Tone. However, he did not, in Ireland, escape the usual 
charges of corruption. In the year 1793, he negotiated with 
thé Minister the terms upon which the partial emancipation, 
which was then.granted to the Catholics, was to be conceded. 
Whenever a leader of the people is brought into contact 
with authority, he will incur injurious surmises, should the 
_Tesult not correspond with popular expectation. It was said, 
that had John Keogh insisted upon complete emancipation, 
everything would, in that moment of emergency, have been 
“obtained. It wag. insinuated, and for a long time believed, 
that he received a large sum of money as a remuneration for 
his complaisance; but there is no sort of proof that he sold his 
country, and his opulence should, by generous men, who are” 
slow to believe in the degradation of human nature, be rather 
referred to his honorable industry in his trade, than to any 
barter of the liberties of Ireland. It is difficult to determine 
whether, if the Catholics had been peremptory in their requi- 
sition for equality, they could have forced the Minister to 
yield. Iam inclined to think that they would’ have encoun- 
‘tered obstacles in the mind of tlie late King,* which could not

To the Irish Catholics, he held out hopes, nearly as strong us promises, that the 
abolition of their political disabilities would follow. George III., who was cog- 
nizant, all through, of this understanding with the Catholics, was decidedly 
averse to concession, when the measure was named ta him; whereupon Pitt _ 
quitted office in disgust. Three years after, he returned to power, and died in 
January, 1806. “All The Talents,” comprising Lord Grenville’s Ministry, in 
1807, vainly essayed to chango the King’s Anti-Catholic views (he thought that 
concession to the Catholics would be a breach of his coronation oath to defend 
the Protestant Church) and very soon after they were cavalierly dismissed, and 
the Perceval Ministry formed.—M. ,

have been overcome; and it must be acknowledged, that for 
~what was obtained (and that was much), his country is princi- 
: pally indebted to Mr. Keogh, and to the Committee of which 
he was the head. 
In 1793 the elective franchise was obtained. The seed was 
then cast, of which we'have seen the fruits in the elections of 
Waterford, and Louth, and Clare. Great joy prevailed through 
the Catholic body, who felt that they had now gained, for the 
first time, a footing in the state, and were armed with the 
power, if not of bursting open, of’ at least knocking loudly 
“at the gates of the constitution. For some time the question 
lay at rest. The rebellion then broke out—the Union suc- 
ceeded—and the Catholic cause was forgotten. It was not 
even debated in the British House of Commons until the year 
1805, when the measure was lost by an immense majority. - 
Jolin Keogh, being advanced in life, had retired, in a great 
degree, from public proceedings, and confined himself to his 
residence at Mount Jerom, in the vicinity of Dublin. He had 
been previously defeated in a public assembly by a young bar- 
rister, who had begun to make a figure at the bar, to which he 
“was called in the year 1798, and who, the moment he took a 
part in politics, made a commanding impression. This barris- 
ter was Daniel O’Connell, who, in overthrowing the previous 
leader of the body upon a question connected with the pro- 
priety of persevering to petition the legislature, gave pidof of - 
the extraordinary abilities which have been since so success- 
fully developed. Mr. Keogh was mortified, but his infirmities, 
without reference to any pain which he might have suffered, 
were a sufficient inducement to retire from the stage where he 
had long performed the ptincipal character with such just 
applause. Myr. O’Connell .was, however, too deeply engaged 
in-his professional pursuits to dedicate as much of his atten- 
tion and of his time as he has since bestowed to political con- 
cerns; and, indeed, the writer of this article remembers the 
time when his power of public speaking, and of influencing 
popular assemblies, was by no means so great as it has since 
become. The fortune with which he came to the bar (for his 
father and uncle were then alive) was not considerable, and it

* wad of more importance to him to accumulate legal knowledge 
and pecuniary resources than to obtain a very shining political 
“naime.* So much has been already written with respect to 
_ this eminent individual, and the public are so well acquainted 
e With the character of his mind and talents, that it is not 
-hecessary to expatiate upon them. 
Another person appeared after the secession of John Keogh, 
“of very great abilities, with whose name the English public 
“have been less familiar. Mr. Denis Scully, the eldest son of a 
  > gentleman of large property in the County of Tipperary, and 
“who had been called to the bar, obtained, by his admirable 
writings, an iffluence almost equal to that of Mr. O’Connell in 
the Catholic Committee, which was revived in all its vigor, 
and became the object of Mr. Saurin’s prosecutions in 1811. 
Mr, Scully had, upon his entrance into public life, written some 
pamphlets in support of Government, and it was believed that 
his marriage to a lady who was related to Lady Hardwicke 
had given a determination to his opinions. When Lord Hard- 
" * O'Connell did not join the United Irishmen in 1798, when he was aged 
twenty-three. He disapproved of their “ argument of force,” relying rather on 
the “ force of argument.” It is said that he even became member of a yeo- 
manry corps. Two principles he started with, and retained to the end: —that 
he who committed an outrage supplied the enemy with a weapon to be used 
against the country, and that Ireland could not be prosperous until the Legisla- 
tive Union with England was repenléd. The “ Young Ireland” schism, which 
so much annoyed him at the close of his career, was Gaused by his continued 
resistance to the doctrine of “ physical force” held by Meagher, Mitchel, and 
others of the young and gallant patriots, As for the Union, O’Connell’s first 
public effort was against it. His maiden speech, on January 13, 1800, was at 
a Catholic meeting in Ireland, and in unequivocal condemnation of that meas- 
ure. The resolutions of this meeting, drawn up by O’Connell, declared the 
Union, then proposed, to be “in fact, an extinction of the liberty of Ireland, 
which would be reduced to the abject condition of a province, surrendered to 
the mercy of the Minister and Legislature of another country, to be bound by 
their absolute will, and taxed at their pleasure by laws, in the making of which 
Ireland would have no efficient representation whatever.” All through the 
struggle for Catholic Emancipation, and to the last, O’Contiell was constant in 
declaring that ‘the Repeal” must be the end of all. In other words, from 
1800 to1847, O'Connell declared that there must be a Repeal ‘of the. Union, to 
make Ireland

wicke.was in Ireland, Mr. Scully was a good deal sought for 
at the Castle.* 
His first writings, however, were merely juvenile effusions; 
and he afterward felt that the only means of obtaiming justice 
for Ireland was by awakening a deep sense of their injuries 
among the great mass of the people. Accordingly the char- 
acter of. his compositions was materially changed; and from 
his study in Merrion-square there issued a succession of pow- 
erful and inflammatory writings. A newspaper, of which Mr. 
ZEneas Mac Donnel was named the editor, was established by 
My. O’Connell and Mr. Seulty; and both those gentlemen, but 
- especially the-latter, contributed their money and their talents 
to its support. The wrongs of the country were presented in 
the most striking view; and while the Government looked 
with alarm on these eloquent and virulent expositions of the 
condition of the people, the people were excited to a point of 
discontent, to which they had never before been raised. - 
Mr. Scully gained great influence over the public mind by 
these services. His work upon the penal code, which is an 
- admirable digest of the laws and of their results, set a crown 
upon his reputation. No book so able, so convincing, and 
uniting so much philosophy with so much eloquence, had yet 
appeared. It brought the whole extent of Catholic suffering 
at once under view, and condensed and concentrated the evils 
of the country. This work created an unprecedented impres- 
sion, and gave to its author an ascendency in the councils of 
the Catholic Committee. He was greatly inferior to Mr. 
O’Connell as a speaker, but was considered fully as able in 
preliminary deliberation. The measures of the body were 
generally believed to be of his suggestion, and it was said that 
he had gained a paramount influence over Mr. O’Connell him- 
self. “The witchery resolutions,” as they are generally des« 
ignated —for they related to. the influence of an enchantress 
of ‘fifty over the Kingf—were supposed to be his composi- -

“ tion, and it was alleged that he omitted no efforts, in conjunc- 
tion with the late Lord Donoughmore,* to cause them to be 
Emancipation. In 1810, when George IL. was again afflicted with insanity 
(from which Ke never recovered), his eldest son was made Prince Regent, to 
govern in his father’s name, but, after the first twelve months, with all but the 
name of King. He retained the illiberul ministry, headed by | Mr. Perceval, and 
at the year’s end, declared that he would retain that Minister, though he should 
be glad; if some of his early friends would join the government. Lord Grey 
and Grenville, whom he named, declined. Immediately after, when the Assas- 
_ ,sination of Perceval rendered anew ministry necessary, Grey and Grenville-were 
again applied to, but insisted on being allowed, at starting, to change the en- 
tire household of the Regent. Sheridan, who supported’ the Regent and was 
wnuch in his confidence then, had previously written in their name,as an ‘ Ad- 
dress to the , Prince,” the following imitation of Rochester's lines t to Charles IL: 
“Tn all humility we crave, 
Our Regent may become out slave} 
And, being so, we trust that he 
Will thank us for our loyalty. = 
Then, if he'll help us to pull down 
Bis fathel’s dignity and crown, . 
We'll make him, in some time to come, 
The greatest prince in Christendom.” 
Lord Liverpool, a strong anti-Catholic, was made Premier. The Irish lead- 
ers then passed several resolutions, one of which denounced “the fatal witch- 
ery” which had led the Regent to form a ministry hostile to Irish liberty of con 
-science. This alluded to the then Marchioness of Hertford, a stout, middle- 
aged woman (the Regent's first wifo was “ fat, fuir, and forty”), and was a 
strong Tory. “It was believed that she was the Regent's mistress, while his 
most constant male friends were her husband and son—the latter. being then 
nearly forty years of age! These “witchery” resolutions so much annoyed 
the Regent that, seventeen years elapsed beforé, under strong pressure, he 
could be brought to consent to Catholic Emancipation.—M. : 
* Richard Hely Hutchinson, born 1756, was son of that Mr. Hutchinson 
(provost of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1761, and Irish Secretary of State in 
1777), whose thirst of acquisition was so great that the British Minister de- 
scribed him as one who, if'he obtained Ireland as an estate, would ask for the 
adjacent Isle of Man, as a kitchen garden. The-son. was created Baron, 
Viscount, and Earl, and was made a British Viscount in 1821. Dying in 1825, 
he was succeeded by his brother, who had succeeded Apercrombie in military 
command in Egypt, and had been created Lord Hutchingon, in 1801, with a 
pension of two thdusand pounds sterling. On his death, in 1832, his nephew - 
became Har] of Donoughmore, but had won a loftier fame, in 1815, by assisting 
in the escape of Lavalette from the prison in Paris, where certain death awaited 
lim from the vengeance of the Bourbons. During the present century, all the

‘earried. The résolutions passed at the “Black Abbey” at 
Kilkenny were also framed by Mr. Scully, who narrowly 
escaped incarceration for his elucubrations. 
Mr. John Magee, the proprietor of the Evening Post, and 
“Mr. Fitzpatrick, were imprisoned for his sins; but I have 
always understood that Mr. Scully made them a compensation 
for their sufferings on his account. He became an object of 
great detestation with the Protestant party, and of correspond- 
ing partiality with his own. But, in the height of his political 
influence, the death of his father, and a domestic lawsuit, 
which engrossed all his mind, induced him to retive in a great 
measure from public life; and afterward the decay of health 
prevented him from taking any part in the proceedings of his 
body.. 
‘Phe Catholies have sustained ‘a great loss in him. His 
large property, his indefatigable industry, his profound sense 
of the injustics which his country had suffered, and the elo- 
quent simplicity with which he gave it expression, rendéred 
him adequate to the part which had devolved upon him, His 
chief fault lay in the intemperate character of the measures 
which he recommended. His manner and aspect were in sin- 
gular contrast and opposition to his political tendencies. In 
utterance he was remarkably slow and deliberate, and wanted 
energy and fire. His cadences were singularly monotonous, 
. every sentence ending with a sort-of see-saw of the voice, 
which was by no means natural or agreeable. His gesture 
was plain and unaffected, and it was easier to discover his 
emotions by the trembling of his fingers than by his counte- 
nance; for his hand would, under the influence of strong feel- 
ing or passion, shake and quiver like an aspen-leaf, while his 
countenance looked like marble. It was impossible to detect 
his sensations in bis features. A deep smile played over his 
mouth, whether he was indulging in mirthful, in pleasurable, 
or sarcastic observation. He had some resemblance to Bona- 
* parte in figure, when the latter grew round. and corpulent, but 
was more unwieldy. I have often thought, too, that in his 
massive’ and meditative features I could trace an imperial 
- Tikeness. ‘ ~

     LORDS FRENCH ‘AND FINGAL. 373 
Jt was about sixteen or seventeen years ago that this. gon- 7 
tleman made so distinguished a figure in the Catholic Com- 
mittee., There were many others who at that time took an 
active share in Catholic politics, and who are since either 
> dead; orhave retreated from publicity. The late Lord French 
wasamong the most remarkable. He was a very tall, brawny, - 
pallid, and ghastly-looking man, with a peculiarly revolution- 
jay aspect, and realised the ideal notions which one forms of 
-- the-men who are most likely to become formidable and con- 
" © Spienous in the midst of a political convulsion, He had a ~ 
Jong and oval visage, of which the eyebrows were thick and 
~ shaggy, and whose aquiline nose stood out in peculiar prom- 
iaence, while a fierce smile sat upon cheeks as white as parch- 
ment, and his eyes glared with the spirit that sat within them. 
His manners were characterized by a sort of drawling urbanity, 
which is observable among the ancient Catholic gentry of 
Connaught; and be was studiously and sometimes painfully 
polite. He was not a scholar, and must have received an 
imperfect education. But his mind was originally a-powerful 
‘one, and his deep voice, which rolled out in a peculiarly mel- 
ancholy modification of the Irish brogue, had a dismal. and 
appalling sound. He spoke with fluency a diction which be- 
longed exclusively to him. It was pregnant with vigorous but 
strange expression, which was illustrated by gesture as bold, 
but as wild. He was an ostentatious duellist, and had fre- 
quent recourse to gladiatorial intimations. Pride- was his 
- Jéading trait of character, and he fell a victim to it. He had 
connected himself with a bank in Dublin, and having become 
bankrupt, rather than brook the examination of the commis- 
sioners at the Exchange, he put himbelf, ina paroxysm of 
-insanity, to death, I thought him, with all his defects, a lover 
_ of his country. 
It would be difficult to imagine two persons more istrongly 
opposite in character and in manner than Lord French and - 
the Premier Catholic nobleman the Earl of Fingal. He has 
~ since left to his able and intelligent son the office which he so 
long and so usefully filled, as head of the Catholic body ;- but, 
about the period of which I am speaking, he was the chief, in

point of rank, of the Ivish Catholics, and presided at their 
meetings. Lord Fingal is-one of the most amiable and kind 
men whom it has been my good fortune to have been ever ac- 
quainted with. Without the least shadow of arrogance, and 
although incapable of hurting the feelings of any man, he still 
preserves his patrician dignity unimpaired, and commands the 
respect as well as the impartiality of every one who approaches 
him. Alihough not equal to his son in intellectual power, he 
has excellent sense and admirable discretion. He has made 
few or no mistakes in public life, and very often, by his cool- 
yess and discretion, has prevented the adoption of rash-and 
injudicious measures. His manners are disarming: and I haye 
understood, upon good authority, that when in London, where 
he used almost annually to go, as head of the Catholic body, 
he has mitigated, by the charm of his converse, the hostility 
- of some of his most rancorous political opponents. Asa speaker, 
he is without much ability; but there is a gentleness and a 
grace about him which supply the place of eloquence, and ren- 
der his. audience so favorable to him, that he has often suc- 
ceeded in persuading, where others of greater faculty might 
-have employed the resources of oratory in vain. 
An individual, who is now dead, about this time -made-a 
great: sensation, not only. in the Catholic Association, but 
through the empire. _This was the once-famous Doctor Drum- 
goole, whom Lord Kenyon seems determined not to allow to 
remain in peace. He was the grand anti-vetoist, and was, I 
believe, a most sincere and unaffected sentinel of religion. He 
kept watch over the Catholic hierarchy, and took the whole 
body of the clergy under his vigilant protection. It was, how- 
ever, a speech which he delivered at the Shakspere Gallery, 
in Exchequer street [Dublin], at a Catholic meeting, that tended 
chiefly to give him notoriety. He assailed the tenets of the ~ 
established religion: with a good deal of that sort of candor 
which Protestants at that period regarded as the height of pre- 
sumption, but which is now surpassed every day by’ the ha- 
iangues of the orators of the Catholic Association. The Doc- 
tor’s speecli may be considered as a kind of epoch in Catholic 
politics ; for he was ‘the first who ventured to employ against ~

the opponents-of Emancipation the weapons which are habitu- 
ally used against the professors of the Roman Catholic religion. 
‘Men who swear that the ereed of the great majority of Chris- 
tians is idolatrous and -superstitious, showld not be very sénsi- 
tive when their controversial virulence is turned upon them> 
*-The moment Doctor Drumgoole’s philippic on the Reforma-. 
tion appeared, a great outcry took place, and Roman Catholics 
were not wanting to modify and explain away the Doctor's 
scholastic vituperation. He himself, however, was fixed and 
stubborn ag the rock on which he. believed that his doctrines 
were built. No kind of apology could be extorted from him. 
He was, indeed, a man of a peculiarly stubborn and inflexible’ 
cast’ of mind. It must, however, be admitted that, for every 
position which he advariced, he was able to adduce very strong 
and cogent reasoning. He was a physician by profession, but 
in practice and in predilection he was a theologian of the most 
uncompromising sort. He had a small fortune, which rendered 
him independent of patients, and he addicted himself, strenu- 
sously and exclusively, to the study of the scholastic arts. He 
was beyond doubt a very well-informed andacleverman. He 
had a-great command of speech, and yet was not a pleasing 
* speaker. He was slow, monotonous, and invariable. His 
countenance was full of medical and theological solemnity, 
and he was wont to carry a huge stick with a golden lread, on 
which. he used to press both his hands in speaking; and in- 
deed, from the manner in which he swayed his body, ‘and 
knocked liis stick at the end of every period to the ground, 
which he accompanied with a strange and guttural “hem!” 
he seemed to me a kind of rhetorical pavior, who was busily 
engaged in making the great road of: Liberty, and paving the 
way to Emancipation.

had not seen him for a considerable time, but I had scareely 
asked him how he was, when he reverted to the Veto. A de- 
bate (it was in the year’ 1819) was immediately opened on the 
subject. Some Irish gentlemen dropped casually in; they all 
took their share in the argument. The eloquence of the dif. 
ferent disputants became inflamed: the windows toward the 
street had been left unhappily open; a crowd of Frenchmen 
collected outside, and the other inhabitants of the house gath- 
ered at the doors to hear the diseussion. It was only after the 
Doctor, who was still under the influence of Vetophobia, had 
taken his leave, that I perceived the absurdity of the incident. 
A volume of “ Gil Blas” was on the table where we happened 
to have been assembled, and by accident I lighted on the pas- 
sage in. which he describes the Irish disputants at Salamanca: 
“Je rencontrois quelque fois des figures Hibernoises. Il falloit 
nous voir disputer,” &c. We ave a strange people, and deserve 
‘ our designation at the foreign universities, where it was proyer- 
bially said of the Irish that they were “radione furentes.” 
There were others besides the persons whom I have de-- 
scribed, who at this juncture took a part in the Catholic poli- 
ties; and who are deserving of mention; but as they have 
recently made a figure even more conspicuous than-at the 
Catholic Committee, I reserve them for subsequent delineation. 
“The only other person whom I remember as worthy of muéh 
note, and who has retired from Catholic assemblies, was Peter 
Bodkin Hussey. Peter was a very droll, sarcastic, and amu- 
_ sing debater. He dealt almost exclusively in irony, and em- 
ployed a good deal of grotesque imagery in his action, which, 
if it did not instruct, served at least the purposes of entertain- 
ment. He had a very rubieund and caustic countenance, that 
was surmounted with a profusion of” red hair; and, from: his 
manner and aspect, he was not unhappily designated as “ Red 
Precipitate.? I don’t know from what motive he has retired 
from political life; but, though he is still young, he has not 
recently appeared at any Roman Catholic assembly. 
These were the individuals who, besides the performers who 
still continue on the boards, chiefly figured at the Catholic 
Committee, which, in the year 1811, was made the object of-a

flected to sit in the Catholic Parliament. The Government 
“xgtrained every nerve to procure a conviction, Mr. Saurin com-

--gentlemen of the jury, I can not but congratulate you and the 
public that the day of justice has at length arrived ;” and the

oration thus: “Compare such a constitution with the estab- 
‘- Jished authorities of the land, all controlled, confined to their 
*zespective spheres, balancing and gravitating to each other— 
all symmetry, ‘all order, all harmony. Behold, on the other 
hand, this prodigy in the political hemisphere, with eccentric 
course and portentous glare, bound by no attraction, disdain- 
ing any orbit, disturbing the system, and affrighting the world.”

"4 by the people, and consisting of a certain number of members 
' delegated from each town and county, ceased to exist. A 
great blow had been struck at the cause, and a considerable 
time elapsed before Ireland recovered from it. The Russian 
war ensued, and Bonaparte fell. ‘I'he hopes of the Oatholics 
fell with the peace. A long interval elapsed, in which nothing 
very important or deserving of record took place. A political 
lethargy spread itself over the great body of the people, and 
~ the assemblies of the Catholics became more unfrequent, and 
their language more despondent and hopeless than it had ever 
before been. The unfortunate differences which had taken 
_place between the aristocracy and the great body of the people 
respecting the Veto, had left many traces ‘of discord behind, : 
and divided them from each other; they no longer exhibited 
any very formidable object to their antagonists. -

this intelligence; and it was believed by the Catholics, and 
stirmised by the Protestants, that their sovereign could scarcely 
mean to visit this portion of his dominions from any. idle 
curiosity, or from an anxiety to play the principal part in a 
melodramatic procession through the Irish metropolis. It was 
reasonably concluded that he must have intended to come as 
the herald of national tranquillity, and as the great pacificator _ 
of his people. Before his arrival, the two parties formed a 
temporary amnesty; and Mr.O’Connell, who had gained the 
first eminence in his profession, and had become the undisputed 
leader of the Catholic body, used his best endeavors to effect 
a reconciliation between the Orangemen of the Corporation 
and the Ivish Catholics. 
Sir: Benjamin Bloomfield* arrived in Dublin before his mas- 
ter, and intimated the Royal anxieties that all differences and 
animosities should be laid aside. Accordingly, it was agreed 
-that.a publie dinner should be held at Morrison’s tavern, 
where the leaders of both factions should pledge each other in 
Hbations of everlasting amity. This national festivity took 
place; and from the vehement protestations on both sides, it 
.was bélieved by many that a lasting reconciliation had been 
effected. Master Ellis and Mr. O’Connell almost embraced 
each other. ‘The King arrived; the Catholics determined not 
to intrude their grievances upon him. Accordingly our -gra- 
cious Sovereign passed rather an agreeable time in Dublin.

hile the Catholics continued under the miserable deception 
ider which they had labored during the Royal sojourn, but 
“when they found that no intention existed to introduce a 
- change of system into Iveland—that the King’s visit seemed 
_ aif artifice, and Lord Sidmouth’s epistle meant nothing— and 
"that while men were changed, measures continued substantially 
unaltered, they hegan to perceive that some course more effect- 
‘yal than a loyal solicitude not to disturb the repose of Majesty, 
should be adopted. 
‘Phe present Catholic Association rose out of the disappoint- 
_ment-of the people. Its foundations were laid by Mr. O’Con- 
~ nell, in conjunction with Mr. Sheil.” They both happened to 
meet at the house of a common friend in the mountains of 
Wicklow, and after exchanging their opinions on the deplor- 
able state to which the Catholic mind had been reduced, and 
the utter want of system and organization in the body, it was 
agreed*by those gentlemen that they should both sign an 
address to the Irish Catholics, and enélose it to the principal 
niembers of the body. This proceeding was considered pre- 
sumptuous by many of the individuals to whom their manifesto 
was directed; and under other circumstances, perhaps, it might 
 be-regarded as an instance of extreme self-reliance; but it 
was absolutely necessary that some endeavor should be made 
.to:rouse the national mind from the torpor into which it had 
fallen. 
A _very thin meeting, which did not consist ‘of more than 
power is permitted to the fair sex—O’Connell yiclded a great deal when 
George the Fourth came to Ireland, in 1821, whereof Byron wrote,

Like a goodly Leviathan rolled from the waves.”

about twenty individuals, was held at +a tavern set up by a 
man of the name of Dempsey, in Sackville street; and it was 
there determined that something should be done.» The founda- 
tions of the Association were then laid, and it must be owned 
that its first meetings afforded few indications of the import- 
ance and the magnitude to which it was destined to be raised. 
The attendance was so thin, and the public appeared so insen- 
sible to the proceedings which took place in those small_con-' 
vocations, that it is almost surprising that the enterprise was 
‘not relinquished in despair. The Association in its origin was 
treated with contempt, not only by its open adversaries, but 
Catholics themselves spoke of it with derision, and spurned at 
the walls of mud, which their brethren had rapidly thrown up, 
and which'were afterward to become alte menia Rome. At 
length, however, the men who had formerly been active in 
Catholic affairs were got together, and the great body of the 
people were awakened from their insensibility. The powerful 
appeals of Daniel O’Connell, who now. began to develop even 
greater abilities than he had before exhibited, and whosé 
ambition was excited by the progress which he had made in 
his profession, stirred the mind of Ireland. 
The aristocracy, who had been: previously alienated, had 
forgotten many affronts which had been put upon them, and 
began to teunite themselves with the people. Lord Killeen, 
the son of the Earl of Fingal, came forward as the representa- 
tive of his father and of the Catholic nobility. He was free 
from the habits of submission which the Catholic aristocracy 
had contracted at the period of their extreme depression, and 
was animated by an ardent consciousness of the rights which 
were withheld from him. This young nobleman threw him- 
‘self into a zealous co-operation with Mr. O’Connell, and by his © 
abilities aided the impression which his rank and station were 
calculated to produce. His example was followed by other 
noblemen; and Lord Gormanstown, a Catholic peer of great 
fortune, and of very ancient descent, although hitherto unused 
to public life, appeared at the Catholic Association. . This 
good man had labored for many years under the impression 
that the Catholics were frustrating their own objects by the

violence with which they were pursued, and had, in conse- 
“quence, absented himself from their assemblies; but at length 
> the delusion passed away. His example was followed by the 
Ear) of Kenmare, who, though he did not actually attend the 
‘Association (for he abhors popular exhibition), sent in the 
authority of his name, and his pecuniary contribution. 
_ Thus the aristocracy was consolidated with the Catholic 
democracy, and Mr. O’Connell began to wield them both with 
‘the power of which new manifestations were every day given. 
In a little time a general movement was produced through the _ 
country; the national attention was fixed upon the delibera- 
tiohs of the body which had thus started up from the ruins of 
. tie-old Catholic Committee; its meetings becamecrowded to 
-excess. The newspapers teemed with vehement harangues; 
‘and the public mind, heated and excited by these impassioned 
‘and constantly-repeated appeals,* began to exhibit an entirely 
different character. 
~The: junction of the aristocracy and of the democracy was 
a most important achievement. But this confederacy was 
gréatly strengthened by the alliance of another and still more 
powerful body, the Catholic priesthood of Iveland.. The sym- 
" patliy. which the clergy have manifested in the efforts of the 
"Association, and the political part which they have lately 
. played, axe to be referred, in a great measure, to the influence 
‘of a very greatly gifted man. Doctor Doyle, the Catholic 
‘Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, is certainly among the most 
fetiarkable men who have appeared in this strange state of

* The ‘Reverend James Doyle, D. D., was an Irishman, who, being intended 
for the Catholic priesthood, received his education at Coimbra, in Portugal, 
whence he removed on being uppointed Professor of Theology to the College 
of Carlow. ‘In 1819, and before he was forty years old, he was made Catholic 
Bishop of Kildare and -Leighlin —being the youngest man ever raised to the 
vprelacy in Ireland. His erudition was great. and his controversial skill soon 
became emineit. In 1823, Dr. Magee, Protestant Archbishop of Dublin, pub- 
lished a charge to his clergy, in which he warned them of the assaults on Prot- 
estantism from Catholics and Dissenters—or, as he chose to express it, from 
“a charch without religion, and a religion without a church.” This antithesis 
provoked: Dr. Deylé, who replied to Dr. Magee in a cutting and learned work, 
showing that the Protestant Church was itself a usurpation, that its Bishops 
were usurpers, and that the-Apostolical Succession could not properly be traced 
_ by or for them through the Catholic Church. Dr. Doyle signed this “J. K. L.” 
the initials of his prelatic signature, “James Kildare and Leighlin,” and 
his future publications, which were numerous, bore the same distinguishing 
letters.— He was much in favor of Poor Laws for Ireland, and succeeded in con- 
verting Mr. O?Connell to bis opinion. When that gentleman retumed to his 
original opposition to Poor Laws, Dr. Doyle publicly declared that a man so 
unstable in opinion was. unsuited for a great popular leader, _ It was in noticing 
this that O'Connell declared that ‘ Consistency was a rascally doctrine.” “Dr. 
Déyle was a firm believer in the miracles said fo have been wrought by or 
through the instrumentality of Prince Hohenloe.— Dr. Doyle’s evidence, before 
a Committee of the House of Lords, in 1825, on the state of Ireland, attracted 
great attention then, and for years after, and tended much to extend his repu- 
tation asa close observer and philosophical reasoner. He died, June 15, 1834,

finest Cathedrals in Ireland, obtaining the necessary funds by much self-priva~

The: Minister of England can not look to the exertions of

y yield*for a moment to the influence of nature, though it 
opposed to grace. This clergy, with a few exceptions, are

“Jf: a.rebellion were raging from Carrickfergus to Cape Clear, 
' axo.sentence of excommunication would ever be fulminated by 
a Qatholi¢ prelate.” 
This announcement of what is now obviously the truth cre- 
cated a sort of consternation. Lord Wellesley, it is said, in 
order to neutralize the effects of this fierce episcopal warning, 
appealed, to Maynooth; and from Maynooth there issued a 
document in which it is well understood that the students and °

of. the Catholic Clergy, we the undersigned, Professors of tlie | 
Roman Catholic College of Maynooth, deem it a duty which 
“we owe to Religion and to the country, solemnly and publicly 
to state, that, in our respective situations, we have uniformly 
‘inculeated allegiance to our gracious Sovereign, respect for the - 
constituted authorities, and obedience to the Laws. 
“In discharging this solemn duty, we have been guided by 
the unchangeable principles of the Catholic Religion, plainly 
and forcibly contained in the following precepts of St, Peter 
and St. Paul: 
“*Be ye subject, therefore, to every human creature for 
God’s sake; whether it be to the King, as excelling, or to 
governors sent by him, for the punishment of -evil-doers, and 
for the praise of the good: for so is the will of God, that by 
doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish 
men, as free and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but 
as the servants of God. Honor all men. Love the brother- 
hood. Fear God. Honor the King For this is thanks- 
worthy, if for conscience toward God aman endures sorrows, . 
suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if committing sin, 
" and being suffering for it, you endure? But if doing well you 
suffer patiently, this is thanks-worthy before God.’ Ist Ep. 
of St. Peter, ¢. ii. | 
«Let, every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is’ 
no power but from God; and those that are, are ordained of 
God. Therefore, he that resisteth the power, resisteth the 
ordinance of God. And ‘they that resist, purchase to them- | 
selves damnation. For Princes are not a terror to the good 
work, but to the evil. Wilt thou, then, not be afraid of the 
“Power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise for 
the same.—— Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for 
wrath, but also for conscience sake.’ Ep. to the Rom. c.-xiii. 
“Our commentaries on these texts can not be better con- 
veyed than in the language of Tertullian: ‘Christians are 
- aware who has conferred their power on the Emperors: they 
know it is God, after whom they are first in rank, and second-to

‘ferive their power. We Christians invoke on all the Emperors 
ithe blessings of long life, a prosperous reign, é domestic security, 
a@ brave army, a devoted senate, and a moral people.’ — 
Apology, chap. 30. 
“Into the sincerity of these professions we challenge the 
“vhost ‘rigid inquiry; and we appeal with confidence to the - 
peaceable and loyal conduct of the Clergy educated in this 
Establishment, and to their exertions to preserve the public 
order, as‘evidence of the soundness of the principles inculeated 
-in‘this College. These principles are the same which have 
been ever taught by the Catholic Church; and if any change 
has been wrought in the minds of the Clergy of Ireland, it is, 
that religious obligation is here strengthened by motives of 
gratitude, and confirmed by sworn allegiance, from which no 
power on earth can absolve.” 
Such was the Sorbonne manifesto, which, notwithstanding 
the awful names of La Hogue and d’Anglade, was laughed at 
- by the Irish priesthood. The reputation of Doctor Doyle was 
more widely extended by this effort of antiquated divinity to 
suppress him; and the Government found additional proofs in 
the result of bis publication of the unfortunate truths which it 
“eontained. 
J. K.L., the name by which Dr. Doyle is generally known, 
and which is composed of the initials of his titular designation, 
threw into the Catholic Association all the influence of his 
sacred authority; and, having openly joined that body, in- 
' @reased the reverence with which the people had previously 
considered its proceedings, and imparted to it something of a 
religious character. The example which was given by Doctor 
Doyle was followed by other dignitaries of the Church, of 
whom the most remarkable are Doctor Murray, the Archbishop 
of Dublin, and Doctor Kelly, the Bishop of Waterford.

That excellent ecclesiastic had for many years presided over 's the see of Dublin, rather with the prudence and caution which 
had been acquired in times of ‘political oppression, than with 
the energy and. determination which became the augmenting 
power of the Catholic body. He had acquired his habits at 
‘an epoch; if not of servility, of oppression, and had been ac- 
customed to accomplish, by dexterous acquiescence, what would 
now be insisted upon as a right. During the Irish rebellion 
he is.said to have shown great skill; and, by his influence at 
the Castle, prevented the Roman Catholic chapels from being 
closed up.. He was accounted a good. divine, but had neither 
the faculty of composition nor of speech. He had received 
his.education at Rome, and was a member of the order of St. 
Dominic. | Hé had. the look, too, of a holy bon-vivant, for. he 
was squat and car] ‘pulent, had a considerable abdominal pleni- 
tude, and a ruddy countenance, with a strong determination 
. of blood to the nose, Yet his aspect belied him, for he was 
conspicuous for the simplicity and abstemiousness of his life; - 
and although Lord Norbury, observing Mr. Auneas M‘Donnel - 
descending the steps of his house, exclaimed, “ There is pious 
#Gneas coming from the sack of Troy,” and by the celebrity 
of the pun extended to the Doctor a renown for hospitality, 
. the latter had scarcely the means of supporting himself ina 
manner éonsistent with his ‘clerical station. He died in ex- 
ceeding poverty, for one guinea only was found in his posses- 
sion. ‘This arose partly from the narrowness of ‘his income, 
and partly from lis generous disposition. He had about eight 
hundred pounds a-year, and expended it on the poor. 
This good man was succeeded by the present Archbishop of 
Dublin, Doctor Murray.* He was educated i in the University

income of the Bishopric of: Derry which is now only four’thousand five “hun-

Bishop of Derry, had the offer of the arch-diocese of Tuam, his significant reply,

flie Marquis of Anglesea, who took it as involving a sort of promise to do

AN INTRODUCTORY WORD TO YOUNG 
TEACHERS 
By Wi1am Goovett Frost, Pu. D, 
President, Berea College 
To many who study American history it appears that its 
most heroic figure is that of the Country School-Teacher. 
Certainly he stands close beside the pioneer preacher. 
America is superior to other lands in that the common 
people here have more virtue and intelligence. And this 
virtue and intelligence is spread among the masses by the 
minister of the gospel and by the teacher of the public 
school. 
Ambition, the resolution of youth to be worthy and use- 
ful, has three birthplaces—the home, the church and the 
school. Of these the school is by no means the least im- 
portant. It comes in where the home has partly failed and 
where the church has hardly reached. 
The country schoolmaster is heroic because of the diffi- 
cult tasks which he undertakes, Thousands who succeed 
fairly well in city schools, with ideal conditions of building, 
furniture and books, and the backing of superintendent, 
truant officer and a great “system,” would fail completely 
in a board schoolhouse in which one is called upon to teach 
every grade and to contend single-handed with all the stu- 
pidity and friskiness of a country district. 
It cheers my heart to know that this little book is to go 
forth as a helper to the country school-teachers of our

land. Each one will feel his solitude and his need of a 
friend. In this book Professor Dinsmore comes to your 
side as the friend you need. You will not read many pages 
without seeing that he “has been there himself.” He has 
been in a thousand schoolhouses like yours. He knows 
hundreds of trustees, parents, pupils exactly like those in 
your district. 
Of course Professor Dinsmore has been to other places 
than the country school. He has been to the great uni- 
versities and the great libraries, and is expert in all the fine- 
spun theories of education. But I have particularly urged 
him in this book to keep all these things in the background, 
and to stick to plain language and practical topics. He 
has succeeded in a remarkable degree. 
You will not be troubled by big words and abstract ideas. 
He does not insist upon giving you a stagecoach when you 
need a baby-carriage or a wheelbarrow! Yet it is good to 
have a friend who understands the stagecoaches and the 
palace cars of education. 
This book, while simple, is thoroughly sound. Many a 
sentence which seems so self-evident as hardly to need stat- 
ing at all represents long résearch and patient investiga- 
tion. He gives you the results both of his studies and his 
experience, without dragging you through too long a process 
yourself. He gives you what you need for your school this 
term and starts you on the road of steady progress. 
I should not undertake to write a single additional chap- 
ter or paragraph for the book. It is for me simply to in- 
troduce it and to advise you, my young friends, to read it 
and to re-read it many times. 
Let me add one parting word. Many of you do not ex- 
pect to follow teaching all your lives (it would be better
-P-A-G-E-5

if more of our schools were taught by those who expect 
to make teaching their life work), but while you do teach, 
try to act and feel as though you were certain to be a 
teacher all your life. Do not debase yourself by doing any 
half-hearted work. Have the courage and audacity to un- 
dertake to improve on even the best teachers you have 
known. James A. Garfield was once a country school- 
teacher. The coming president gave his great powers to 
the work of leading the children toward manhood and 
womanhood. God and your country call upon you to be 
as good a teacher as Garfield.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
In respect to professional information and guidance there 
is no more needy person than the country school-teacher. 
He is usually so remote from the greater sources of infor- 
mation and inspiration that it is not to be wondered at if he 
is slow in acquiring proficiency. All things considered, the 
wonder is that he has attained to his present standard of 
excellency. 
The writer, himself one of the class in the beginning of 
his career, has visited hundreds of country schools and is 
well aware of their deficiencies. Nevertheless, he is glad to 
testify to the earnestness of country teachers as a whole, 
and to their eagerness to serve faithfully their patrons in 
the schoolroom and out of it. They have been, and still 
are, the greatest single power for good in the nation, and 
the country owes them a debt of gratitude it can never 
repay. 
The teacher of the district school is compelled to rely 
almost entirely upon his own judgment. Usually there 
is no one in the neighborhood to whom he can turn for pro- 
fessional advice or counsel. The visits of the County 
Superintendent are too far apart and too brief to be of much 
help. The County Institute and Teachers’ Association are 
valuable, but fall far short of his needs. His salary will 
scarcely permit him to attend the State or National Asso- 
ciations ; he may possess a few educational books and jour- 
nals, but they do not seem to apply to his work. As a 
z

tule these books and journals are prepared by city super- 
intendents or college professors and apply, or appear to 
apply, to city schools. 
Moreover, it is difficult for any one to study the prob- 
lems of teaching by himself. Those who teach in the city 
have the advantage of the weekly teachers’ meetings and 
the leadership of the principal or superintendent. The 
country teacher has no such advantage. Is it to be won-. 
dered at, then, if his spirit languish ? 
This little book. is designed to meet the many and pecul- 
iar needs of the country teacher. The author expresses the 
hope that it will be valuable to all, but particularly to begin- © 
ners. He has kept in mind the sore straits in which he 
was often placed in the outset of his own career, how he 
groped for even the common principles of instruction and 
government, and how slowly those principles dawned upon 
him. His early experience and later work have made him 
familiar with every phase of district teaching. 
In preparing this book he has never in a single sentence 
lost sight of the one great object he had in mind, namely, 
to help the district teacher in solving his problems and dis- 
charging his duties. It seems to him in recalling his early 
career that such a work as this would have been of inesti- 
mable value. It would have helped him to avoid many 
youthful errors. That it may serve such a purpose to all 
who read it is his earnest hope.

CHAPTER I 
GETTING READY TO TEACH 
1. SELF-EXAMINATION 
Questions One Should Ask Himself.—It is a serious 
thing to choose the profession of teaching. The young 
man or woman who does so should consider very care- 
. fully his or her fitness. The most rigid examination 
that one should be called upon to pass is self-examination. 
The questions one should ask himself might be some- 
what like the following: 
(1) Is my character such as to justify me in choos- 
ing the profession of teaching? Are my habits of life 
fit to be an example for those who would be my pupils? 
Do I intend to keep myself free from all vices that 
contaminate? Do I love righteousness and prefer to 
associate with righteous people? 
(2) What is my motive in desiring to teach? Is it 
money, or personal preferment, or any other selfish 
end? Have I a strong desire to do good and a reason- 
able belief that I shall be able to excel in the profession ? 
il
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Am I willing to sacrifice something in the way of money 
for a work which is infinitely more important ? 
(3) Am I apt to teach? Have I the qualities of an 
instructor? Does it come natural to me to demonstrate, 
to explain difficulties, to disseminate knowledge? Do 
I delight in directing the minds and energies of chil- 
dren? Am Ia born teacher? Shall I be happier in 
the schoolroom giving instruction than in any other 
work I could choose? Remembering the saying that 
every one should be able to find his happiness in his 
work, shall I be able to do this in teaching? 
(4) Do I love children, not theoretically, but actually 
and practically? Not nice ones only, but children of 
all sorts? Do I love them with a desire to make them 
better, with a love that sees something interesting in 
every child, good even in the worst and the need of 
culture and development in the best? Do I see in 
the child the materials for my life work? Is the pres- 
ence of children distasteful in any way? Should I feel 
relieved when school closes and dread the time of its 
re-opening as some teachers certainly do? 
(5) Do I understand that teaching is not a “soft 
snap,” ‘but means toil and self-sacrifice? Am I willing 
to devote my life to helping my pupils, to live for them? 
Am I willing to unite with other teachers in doing 
everything possible to raise the standards of the pro- 
fession and to make the schools better ? 
If any young aspirant can answer to his own satis- 
faction such self-imposed questions as the above, he
-P-A-G-E-13
    
GETTING READY TO TEACH 13 
may be justified in choosing the profession of teaching: 
otherwise, he would better select some other vocation. 
2. STEPS IN PREPARATION 
Having decided to teach, the next step is the all 
important one of preparation. ‘The fatal mistake made 
by most people is entering the profession before they, 
have sufficient training. If one is to be a lawyer or 
physician, he must have a fair general education and 
then several years of special preparation. Yet the 
training of young minds and the building of character 
is much more difficult and of far greater importance 
than the prescribing for our physical ailments, or the 
adjusting of our business matters; and besides, it is 
economy on the teacher’s part to prepare himself 
thoroughly for his life work. The steps in preparation 
may be as follows: 
General Education.—Any one who is to teach gram- 
mar grade pupils should have at the least a complete 
course in a high school or academy. If he expects to 
teach in a high school or academy, he should have a 
college diploma; if in a college, nothing short of a 
post-graduate degree should be considered. 
Special Training.—After this general education, there 
should be a special training such as is given in the best 
normal schools. This should consist of professional 
studies, such as School Management, Methods of 
Teaching, History of Education, Practice Teaching. 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
    14 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
The Reading Habit.—A teacher should have a large 
fund of general knowledge apart from that gained from 
text-books. This is acquired by reading, travel and by 
keeping one’s eyes open everywhere. He should know 
something of the best literature, books, papers and 
magazines; the great movements of the world and who 
are leaders in them. There is nothing of human in- 
terest that does not concern the teacher, and he should 
be ever on the alert to gather knowledge of men and 
things. As a rule, teachers are woefully lacking in this 
respect. If a teacher falls into conversation with a 
traveling man, he is put to shame because of his lack 
of general knowledge.| The traveling man, perforce, 
reads the newspapers and magazines and is continually 
discussing current events; but the country teacher often 
has not been out of his own county, lives far from rail- 
roads, seldom sees a daily paper or magazine and 
frequently has no reading other than some little local 
paper. If the reading habit has not been formed, it 
should be before teaching is undertaken. 
Value of Observation.—In addition to the above, 
the candidate should in every way possible acquaint 
himself with the processes of teaching. He should 
observe carefully those who teach him, should visit 
schools when possible, should attend teachers’ conven- 
tions and read journals of education, and spend time 
in reflecting on these things. In this way he will not 
only be competent, but be full of enthusiasm and eager 
for his chosen work. Many will be called to teach be-
-P-A-G-E-15
  GETTING READY TO TEACH 15 
' fore they have all this preparation, but they should 
never be satisfied until they obtain it. 
Legal Requirements.—The state requires every 
teacher of a district school to hold either a county 
or state certificate. That these may be secured, pe- 
riodical examinations are held by county superintend- 
ents. As they are often dreaded by the inexperienced, 
a few suggestions as to how to take the examination 
will be welcomed. A great deal is said against exam- 
inations, that they are an unmitigated evil, do not fairly 
test the knowledge of the applicant, and are made up 
of catch problems and puzzles; but after all we could 
not wisely dispense with them. 
Examinations are the main bar to inefficiency. They 
cause aspirants to make a thorough study of the 
branches they will be required to teach. They necessi- 
tate considerable preparation, so that no incompetent 
person can suddenly determine to teach and at once 
set about it. They tend to keep lazy people out of the 
profession, and have still other uses. It is not wise for 
teachers to disparage examinations: they should rather 
encourage them. 
In the first place, teachers who are preparing students 
for this ordeal should give plenty of test examinations. 
Many applicants fail at the first public effort because 
it is their first experience. Part of the preparation should 
consist in taking several complete test examinations with 
all the care that will characterize the public one that 
is approaching. Let the teacher grade the papers,
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
pointing out mistakes and omissions. This will give 
confidence that can be gained in no other way. 
Preparation should be made in good time. One 
school year is probably not too much if it be wisely 
used. An examination ahead is a powerful stimulus 
and this year is likely to be as valuable in self-disci- 
pline as any ever experienced by the student. 
Having taken plenty of time for preparation, as the 
ordeal approaches, rest. Take two or three days imme- 
diately preceding the examination for recuperation and 
be at your best. 
Do not worry. You are now as well prepared as 
you can be and you can afford to look the situation 
squarely in the face. Be hopeful; the probability is 
that the questions will surprise you by being “easy.” 
Await them calmly and confidently. 
When the examination is on, make an honest effort. 
Stand or fall upon your own merits. Devote yourself 
entirely and exclusively to the business in hand. Give 
the best answer you can to each question. That your 
papers should be neat and plainly written goes with- 
out saying. If your appearance is good and your papers 
neat and orderly, it will count in your favor in case of 
doubt. 
A good certificate is a valuable thing to have. When 
you have secured it and find that the grades are good, 
the average high, and you have the satisfaction of 
knowing that it was honestly earned, it is a thing to be 
proud of and you will not regret the hard work it cost.
-P-A-G-E-17
  GETTING READY TO TEACH 17 
3. SECURING A SCHOOL 
You may now with confidence apply for a school. 
Do not ask your uncle or your brother-in-law or any 
other relative to secure you one. Go where the chances 
are even. (As a rule, it is better not to begin with the 
home school.) You will give yourself a fairer chance in 
a neighborhood where you were not brought up. 
Personal Application—Where possible, it is always 
best to apply in person. Call upon each member of the 
board, state your qualifications modestly and present 
your testimonials. Your best recommendation should 
be yourself. Answer questions frankly and ask such as 
will elicit the information you desire and will also leave 
a good impression. It will tell in your favor, if you ap- 
pear to “know your business.” Be perfectly natural in 
speech and manner, remembering that ‘‘all affectation 
but creates disgust.’’ 
It may be remarked that every one has the right to 
look well. One’s clothing need not be costly, but should 
be neat, clean and well-fitting. There are people who 
always look well-dressed, no matter what the quality 
of their clothes; it is in the grooming rather than in 
the quality or style. Some have the idea that the ap- 
proval of farmers may best be won by dressing as 
they do. It does not follow. One’s clothes should be 
adapted to his work. Everybody likes to see a teacher 
well-dressed, that is, with good, plain, well-kept cloth- 
ing. Over-plainness is not commendable and slovenli- 
Dist. School—2  
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
  ness is inexcusable. Good manners and affability are 
essential. s 
Application by Letter—If you cannot apply in per- 
son, write a neat business letter asking for the position, 
stating your fitness, inclosing testimonials and giving 
references. Do not fail to inclose a stamp for reply. 
Your own letter will probably count for or against you 
more than the testimonials of your friends. A mis- 
spelled word or an error in grammar will be likely to 
cost you the position, and it ought to. 
Things to Avoid.—Never overstep the bounds of 
professional courtesy by underbidding or disparaging 
other applicants. Even if you know anything against 
a competitor, it is not your place to give such informa- 
tion. 
It seems too bad to have to caution teachers against 
bribery, but according to reports from many sources, 
it is not uncommon. It appears in various forms, such 
as agreeing to board at a certain place at a certain 
price, or to turn over a portion of the money drawn, or 
in some other inducement. One teacher told the writer 
that he had secured a school by furnishing a quart of 
whisky to the ‘‘right”’ man. 
Bribery in any and every form is wholly to be con- 
demned. No school-director who is worthy of his place 
will accept a bribe, and no man is worthy of the high 
calling of teacher who will offer one or submit to any 
dishonest proposal. This practice of bribery is a blot 
upon the profession.
-P-A-G-E-19
  GETTING READY TO TEACH 19 
Contract with Trustees—The trustees have taken 
a solemn oath to the proper discharge of their duties. 
They are usually as honest and conscientious as other 
men, but not very deeply impressed with their official 
responsibilities. When you sign the contract with them, 
you agree to discharge your duties to the best of your 
own knowledge and ability. Your responsibility lies 
in carrying out your end of the contract, and if you are 
wise enough and brave enough, you can help them to 
carry out theirs. 
The law requires the trustees to provide a good, 
comfortable schoolhouse properly equipped. This to 
them means frequently that things may go along about 
as they have gone in the past. In very many cases the 
schoolhouse is neither comfortable nor well-equipped. 
It is the privilege and duty of the teacher to point out 
defects and suggest repairs and furnishings. Before 
you contract, read the law. 
4. BEFORE SCHOOL OPENS 
As soon as the contract is signed, your work should 
begin. If the opening of school is a month or two off, 
so much the better. It will give the trustees time to 
carry out any suggestions you may make in regard to 
repairs and furnishings. 
Inspecting the Schoolhouse.—Make the acquaintance 
of the people in the district, creating as favorable an 
impression as possible. Be enthusiastic about the ap-
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
proaching term and hopeful that all of school age will 
attend. Then visit the schoolhouse and make a thor- 
ough inspection. Make two lists—one of the things 
that the trustees should do, the other of things to be 
done by yourself and pupils. The building needs a new 
roof; there are no desks, no chairs, no blackboards, no 
window curtains; the walls need painting. These things 
should be attended to by the district and you should 
hand the list neatly written to the trustee in charge. 
Perhaps he will object to taxing the district, but if you 
have made him your friend, he will want to oblige you. 
Point out to him the necessity of a comfortable room. 
It is to be the home of the children for the next six 
months. There is where they will spend most of their 
waking hours five days in the week. It is his sworn 
duty to see that a comfortable house is provided. It is 
necessary not only for comfort but for health. It will 
not do to have the children exposed to a leaky roof, to 
draughty walls and broken windows. It is economy to 
use paint on outside walls. Desks are a necessity for 
study. Window curtains save the eyes. 
Codperation of the People——When you have carried 
your point with the director, help him to make it plain 
to others. Win the people by your earnestness and 
they will be ready to respond to your appeal. Do not 
scold, nor ridicule nor threaten, but simply say that 
we are going to have one of the best schools in the 
county and you want everything as nearly right as 
possible to begin with.
-P-A-G-E-21
  GETTING READY TO TEACH 2I 
Getting the Children to Help.—This point carried, you 
next consult your list of things to be done by your- 
self and pupils. You would better begin with the 
playground. That will most easily enlist their atten- 
tion. Make a frolic of it and invite all the children 
large enough to assist. Clear off all the rubbish, re- 
move obstructions, repair the fence (if there is one), 
clean out the well or spring and make everything 
shipshape. When lunch time comes, provide a nice 
place so that all can eat in a group. Direct the con- 
versation into something pleasant and _ profitable. 
After all have eaten, read or tell a story, sing a song, 
play some pleasant game and then go on with the 
work. 
This should be done only a few days before school 
opens. The girls can do their part by washing the 
windows, cleaning the walls and scrubbing the floor. 
A boy should black the stove. 
When all is clean, some touch of adornment may be 
added. Sprigs of spruce, pine, cedar, holly, hung in 
-festoons over the blackboard and about the walls, have 
a pleasing effect. 
The advantages of some such plan as this are many. 
It advertises the opening of school; it enlists the inter- 
est of both parents and pupils; it affords an opportu- 
nity of acquaintance between teacher and people; it 
gives the children a proprietary interest in the school- 
house and grounds; and last, but by no means least, it 
furnishes the teacher an opportunity to study his pupils
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
and arrange a program for the first day of school, which 
should be a red letter day. 
Tue First Day oF SCHOOL 
The Morning Program.—Arrange your program ten 
days ahead if possible. Find out who the speakers of 
the district are and get their consent to take the sub- 
jects you assign them. ‘There are usually a few people 
who can address an audience creditably, an ex- 
teacher, a justice of the peace, a physician, and per- 
haps a minister. Three or four will be sufficient. The 
children should have the first place. The program 
may run something like this: 
First Day or ScHOOL 
9:00 o’clock—Ringing of the bell. 
Song by the school—America. 
Bible reading by the teacher. 
Prayer. 
Calling the roll. 
Remarks by teacher. 
Declamation by pupil. 
Essay, “Geography,” by pupil. 
Declamation by pupil. 
Essay, “My First Day at School,” by pupil. 
Reciting memory gems, Mother Goose rhymes, etc., by school. 
Song by school. 
Address, “The District School,” by justice of the peace. 
Address, “Value of Steady Attendance,” by ex-teacher. 
Address, “‘Some Rules of Health,” by physician. 
Closing remarks by teacher. 
Song by school. 
Dismissal. a
-P-A-G-E-23
GETTING READY TO TEACH 23 
Do not fail to carry out some such program as this. 
If it is carefully arranged beforehand, it is sure to be 
a success. The patrons must be seen in good time and 
asked to make a ten-minute speech on the subject you 
have selected. If one demurs, give a little tactful en- 
couragement. If he asks, “What shall I say?” you 
may briefly outline his address for him. Be sure to 
_ call on every one who is to take part, more than once 
if possible, and see that each one is really in earnest. 
The children should meet two or three times for 
instruction and rehearsal, so that no failure is likely to 
occur on their part. The schoolroom should be just as. 
neat and pretty as itcan be made. The visitors should 
be provided with seats, and they should be cordially 
welcomed. Every parent in the district should be 
invited and an opportunity given for voluntary re- 
marks. 
The most important part of the whole is the address 
by the teacher. He should indorse what has been said 
about regularity of attendance, promptness and obedi- 
ence, and speak of the value of a day in school, the dis- 
advantages of a day lost, and the difference an educa- 
tion makes in earning power in after years. 
Much is gained by such a plan as this. A good im- 
pression is made upon the pupils, and the parents have 
committed themselves to the essential things. The first 
half day has been well spent. 
_ It remains to be said that in calling the roll, you 
should have the name of every pupil in the district.

If any are not present, inquire about them and express 
the hope that they may enter at once. 
Other First Day Duties.—If it is your first term in 
the district, you will have many things to learn. The 
school register left by your predecessor is one of ‘your 
main allies and should be consulted several days be- 
fore school opens. From it you get the names of the 
pupils and their classification. Make a list of the classes 
and names in each. They are probably classed ac- 
cording to the school readers. 
The Afternoon Program.—After opening exercises 
in the afternoon, say something like this: “I find by 
last term’s register that the following pupils are in the 
second reader.”” Proceed with the names and thus on 
through the list. All new pupils who have never been 
in school before are in the chart class until further 
developments. Any that are more advanced may be 
called to the front, asked a few questions and placed 
where they seem to belong. 
Lessons should now be assigned. The first reader 
class will begin on page so and so and be ready to recite 
in ten minutes; the second reader class, on such a page 
and recite immediately after; and so on through all the 
readers. ‘This puts everybody to work. 
You should next hear the chart class. Ask them if 
they can read, if they have any books at home, if they 
would like to be able to read. ‘Here is a book. I will 
read a little for you. Would you like to learn to read ? 
I will teach you.” Write a word upon the board, as
-P-A-G-E-25
    GETTING READY TO TEACH 25 
“hat” or “man,” and tell them what it is. Have a 
little talk about it. Let them repeat it several times as 
you point to it, and tell them that they can now read 
one word. Give them some little slips of paper and 
show them how to write the word at their seats. 
It is now time for the first reader class. Call the class 
in whatever way you have decided upon. Have each 
one read. Make such comments as you think best and 
carefully assign the next lesson, telling them when it 
will be recited. But just now they are to study their 
number lesson. Put on the board such combinations 
as you think they can master, and show them how to 
carry on the work at their seats. 
Proceed with other classes in like manner until all 
have been heard. It is now time for recess. Make 
some pleasant remark about the session that has just 
passed, tell them how many minutes recess they may 
have and ask them to come in promptly at the ringing 
of the bell. 
Ajter recess, hear the number and arithmetic classes. 
This closes the work of the first day. Make a two or 
three minutes’ talk commending the school for its good 
beginning and for its bright outlook, stating what the 
aims of the school are and what each one’s purpose 
should be. Sing a verse or two of some familiar hymn, 
asking all to join, bid them a cordial good evening, and 
the first day is over. 
A Good Beginning—The important thing in the 
above is that you have proved yourself master of the
-P-A-G-E-26
26 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
situation. All pupils were quickly classified and work 
was begun without delay or confusion. You may be 
sure that those who have been in school before, will 
judge of your efficiency, consciously or unconsciously, 
from the first moments and keep on judging until the 
last. They have now made up their minds as to 
whether or not you understand your business and the 
kind of teacher you are going to be. “School” will 
be the subject of conversation on the playground and 
in every homé: hence the importance of a good begin- 
ning. A favorable start presages well, but it will not 
do to rest upon it. We must not lay down our arms or 
relax our vigilance, nor make a single boast until the 
battle is won: then our work will speak for itself. It 
becomes a general, after the first outwork has been won, 
to look well to his forces, to understand conditions and 
thus be prepared for the main conflict. So let us take 
a view of the Situation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  CHAPTER II 
THINGS TO BE KEPT IN MIND 
1. THE SCHOOL FOR THE CHILDREN 
Its Fundamental Purpose.—It must be understood by 
all concerned that the school is not created for the 
benefit of the teacher, to insure him an easy position 
and a comfortable salary; nor for the trustees, to afford 
them an opportunity to exercise authority; nor for the 
County Superintendent, valuable though his advice and 
visits may be. The school is primarily, secondarily 
and finally for the children. For them it was brought 
into existence, for them alone has been provided all 
the paraphernalia of educational government from the 
United States, represented by the Department of Edu- 
cation, down to the district school, represented by the 
Board of Trustees and the teacher. All officials from 
the highest to the lowest are the servants of the 
school. 
Everything belonging or pertaining to the public 
schools is holy, consecrated, set apart for the most di- 
vine purpose in the world, that of educating and train- 
ing the children. Their minds must be developed and 
trained, their morals cultivated, their health cared for, 
27 ‘
-P-A-G-E-28
28 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
their manners improved. The test of every educational 
device should be—is it for the good of the pupils? 
The Teacher’s Function.—This principle does not 
neglect the teacher. His time, thought and strength 
belong to the pupils and for their sake must be con- 
served. It is of vital importance to the school that 
the teacher be strong, cheerful and efficient. If he 
overtax his strength or neglect to prepare his work, 
the school will suffer. This obligation does not im- 
pose any cruelty upon the teacher; neither is his sacrifice 
in vain. The principle laid down by the Saviour, ‘‘He 
that loseth his life for my sake and the gospel’s shall 
find it,” is eminently true of teaching. 
2. THE RIGHTS AND DuTIES OF PARENTS 
  The rights and duties of parents should be made a 
subject of careful study by the teacher. 
Parental Duties.—It is the duty of parents to send their 
children to school; to provide them with food, clothes 
and books; to uphold the teacher in his requirements; 
to pay all necessary taxes levied by the trustees. It 
is necessary frequently for the teacher to remind the 
parents of these duties. This should always be done 
in a spirit of kindness and of service. Parents are 
prone to keep children out of school for light reasons, 
—to run errands, or to take the place of hired help. 
Explain to them the loss that a day means. A class is 
like a line of march; it must keep step. Tf one loses a 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
    THINGS TO BE KEPT IN MIND 29 
day, he is out of step and out of line. He has missed 
the lessons and explanations which his fellow students 
received and which are necessary to further progress. 
If he loses several days, he cannot go on with his class 
and is discouraged. If he perseveres, it is with the 
greatest difficulty and with extra demands upon the 
teacher’s time that are a distinct loss to the school. 
In respect to books, also, parents must be reminded. 
They have so many apparently larger duties that they 
can scarcely be bothered to provide a reader or tablet 
or pencil. But these things are just as important to 
the children as the larger matters are to the parents. 
Books are as necessary to the child as tools to the 
farmer. In other words, as well send a man out to 
cultivate the soil without tools, as to send a child to- 
school without. books. Moreover, the child’s time is 
as valuable as it will ever be. He is laying the foun- 
dation of future usefulness and every day in school 
adds power for many days in the years to come. It 
is, therefore, most important that no time be wasted 
for lack of books. 
In regard to upholding the teacher, there is often 
misunderstanding. Jt is plainly the duty of parents to 
stand by the teacher in everything that is right. Tf in 
their opinion his rules are wrong, they may not come 
to the school and upbraid him publicly, but may speak 
to him privately, giving their view of the case and ask- 
ing for consideration. The wise teacher will be grate- 
ful for such a course and will always consider a matter
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
from the parents’ point of view and then act according 
to his own best judgment. If the adjustment is still 
unsatisfactory, the matter may be laid before the trus- 
tees. The teacher is responsible to the trustees and 
they in turn are responsible to the people. 
Parental Rights.—Having considered the duties of 
parents, let us now look at their rights. rst, they 
have the right that their children be provided with 
comfortable quarters; that their health be not en- 
dangered by sitting in the cold, or in a draughty room, 
or in an unventilated atmosphere; that their forms be 
not distorted by backless benches, or by desks that are 
too high for the arms or otherwise unsuitable: sec- 
ond, that the children be treated with consideration; 
that more shall not be required of them than their 
years and experience will justify; that they be spoken 
to with kindness and gentleness, such as a dairyman 
would require for his cow; that they shall not be need- 
lessly exposed to contaminating influences; that they 
shall be taught to treat others kindly and shall receive 
right treatment in return: third, that they shall be well 
taught in books, in morals, and in behavior; that their 
instruction shall be suited to their understanding and 
fitted to their usefulness in life; that the example of 
the teacher shall be worthy for the pupils to follow: 
fourth, they have a right to be informed of the needs 
of the children in whatsoever pertains to their effective 
school work, if they are falling behind in any of their 
classes, are negligent of their duties, or if they are
-P-A-G-E-31
  THINGS TO BE KEPT IN MIND ik 
habitually tardy or loitering on the way to or from 
school: jijth, they have a right to codperate with the 
teacher in every way possible and to be shown how 
they may do this to the best advantage. , 
All these rights are inviolable and must be respected. 
Sometimes parents overstep them, but it is usually 
from lack of knowledge and because of their solicitude 
for the children. They should be treated considerately, 
though the teacher must maintain his own rights and 
not yield weakly to unreasonable demands. It is not 
wise to inform parents, no matter how great the provo- 
cation, that you are running this school and it is none 
of their business how you do it. Have your own rights 
and duties clearly defined, keep well within their limits, 
and firmly, but with courtesy and dignity, stand your 
ground. 
3. Recocnition or HicHER AUTHORITY | 
Consultation with the Trustees——-The wisest men 
need counsel. The President has his Cabinet, the 
Governor his Staff, and the teacher is fortunate in 
having his Board of ‘Trustees, whose duty it is to ren- 
der him assistance in time of need. He will often have 
occasion to use their wisdom. They know the neigh- 
borhood better than he does. They are more likely to 
have the outside view point than he. They should be 
consulted in respect to general regulations before they 
are put into operation. If they can neither add to
-P-A-G-E-32
32 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
  nor subtract from them, they can indorse them and 
once having indorsed them, they are bound to stand 
by them. They should be consulted about individ- 
ual cases that are difficult of adjustment. Their 
practical everyday wisdom will be very helpful. Their 
wide experience in outside matters will often enable 
them to suggest measures and expedients that would 
not occur to the teacher. And finally they should be 
advised of many things, not so much for any assistance 
they can render, as for their own enlightenment. The 
more they know about your plans and about the school, 
the more will they be interested. By revealing to them 
your methods and the reasons for them, you will your- 
self see more clearly the strong and weak points of 
these methods and reasons. 
Keeping in Touch with the County Superintendent.— 
There is no one individual who is so deeply inter- 
ested in all the schools of the county as the County 
Superintendent. He is keenly alert to the welfare of 
every school and of every teacher. You may be sure 
he is ever on the lookout for excellency and quick to 
discover its signs. He has three ways of judging 
teachers. First, at the County Institute: There he has 
a week to watch the interest and activity of each one. 
If a teacher is always present, is wide-awake, takes 
part intelligently when called upon and never flags in 
attention, he makes a mental note of it and determines 
to keep an eye on him as his school progresses. If, on 
the other hand, a teacher attends unwillingly, chooses 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  THINGS TO BE KEPT IN MIND 33 
a back seat, offers excuses when called upon and is 
listless in attention, he notes that also and determines 
something very different. 
The second way is by reports sent in. If the monthly 
report is carefully filled out, neatly written and shows 
a good record of attendance and is mailed promptly, 
it is much to the teacher’s credit. Any negligence will 
be counted against him. 
A short letter with each monthly report telling some- 
thing of plans and the progress the school is making, 
will be appreciated. The superintendent will be glad 
also to advise on any difficult matter in connection 
with the work, to tell what books to read, or what 
educational journals will be most helpful. 
The third is by his annual visit. No matter whether 
the time of this visit is announced or not, the school 
should be prepared for it. The pupils should realize 
that the County Superintendent is interested in them 
and should be instructed to look forward to his coming 
with pleasant anticipations. Pains should be taken 
that every one may be seen at his best. Specimens of 
work in each branch should be laid aside for the 
superintendent’s inspection. Every pupil should. have 
some part in welcoming and entertaining him and 
should be instructed to that end. 
When he comes, whether by appointment or by 
surprise, he should be introduced to the school. All 
should rise and extend a pleasant greeting by saying 
“Good morning,” or ‘‘Good evening, Mr. A.” Then 
Dist. School—3
-P-A-G-E-34
  34 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
the work should go on for a time just as usual, until 
two or three classes have been heard. After that an 
invitation to speak to the school may be extended. 
At the close, the teacher should make an appropriate 
remark or two and call for a school song. 
At recess the superintendent may be shown the work 
that has been laid aside or put upon the walls, and be 
told of any special efforts that are being made toward 
the improvement of the school. 
If he can stay overnight and give an educational 
address to the people of the district in the evening, it 
will be an excellent thing. He should be urged to do 
this, and if he consents, word should be sent to every 
- family in the district, the school seeing that the house 
is comfortable and well-lighted. Most county super- 
intendents know what matters to emphasize in such a 
meeting and it is certain to result in much good. 
4. THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE SCHOOL 
Each Pupil in the Right Place.—It is an important 
condition of success that every pupil should be in the 
place best suited to his advancement. Every one likes 
to do the things he can do well, while but few enjoy 
tasks that are beyond them. Let a pupil remain for a 
time in an arithmetic class that is too difficult for him, 
and the chances are he will come to despise the study. 
It is humiliating to be dull and plodding and lacking 
in grasp, while others are making headway and en-
-P-A-G-E-35
  THINGS TO BE KEPT IN MIND 35 
joying it. Time and tact should be spent in convinc- 
ing such a student that he is outclassed, and that it is 
more creditable to be first in a lower class than last in 
a higher. Constant vigilance on the teacher’s part is 
necessary to clean-cut work. 
The Basis for Classification——This is usually the 
reading classes. It is a convenient basis, as the num- 
ber of readers corresponds to the number of grades 
in the district schools. The first care should be to 
see that each pupil is in the reading class where he 
will get the most good. Readiness in reading is not 
the only basis on which to classify. If a student has 
been through one reader two or three times, he ought 
not to go over it again. If he cannot read well enough 
for the one next above, he should be given supple- 
mentary reading until he catches up. He will not 
learn anything worth while in the old reader; he prob- 
ably knows it by heart; at least there is nothing new or 
fresh in it. What he needs is practice in new material. 
There is nothing more important in school than help- 
ing up those that are falling behind. 
Grading the Arithmetic Classes.—These are usually 
the most difficult to keep graded. Some are quick, 
others slow; some delight in it, others dislike it; some 
make rapid strides, others drag behind. In such cases 
it requires the utmost tact and diligence to keep the 
class together. Keep the ready ones busy by giving 
them outside problems; give most of the class time 
to the slow ones. Tax yourself to make it interesting. 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Think up everyday problems to illustrate principles; 
take one step at a time, explaining each until it is 
grasped. Patience, perseverence and kindness will win 
the battle. By and by the light will dawn, the frowns 
disappear and the student go on his way rejoicing. 
This is far better than telling the student that the work 
is too hard for him and that he must go back into a 
lower grade. The process oj “going back” is most dis- 
heartening and seldom results in good. It often causes 
pupils to leave school and give up their education, when 
a supreme effort on the part of the teacher would save 
them. It may be necessary occasionally to put a student 
back, the occasion being that he missed important parts 
that cannot be acquired in any other way. Wherever it 
is possible to help the pupil forward, it is better than 
going over old ground a second or third time. If any 
one criticises you for giving too much attention to such 
cases, you may answer that the good shepherd is chiefly 
concerned for the weak ones, to keep them from falling 
by the wayside and from being devoured by the wolves. 
But this special help must be only temporary. 
5. RULES AND REGULATIONS 
No institution can be run without rules. They 
mean regularity and system. Every family has its 
rules and regulations. They may not be announced, 
but they are lived. Getting up in the morning, dress- 
ing, cooking, eating, sleeping are all done with the
-P-A-G-E-37
THINGS TO BE KEPT IN MIND BYE 
regularity that makes the rule. The less left to chance 
and haphazard the better. Wise regulations and rea- 
sonably strict rules are good everywhere. 
Promptness and Regularity—In school particularly 
very little should be left to guess. The morning session 
should open at a set time, not a minute earlier nor a 
minute later, so that the pupils may know just what to 
depend upon. The same should be true of closing, of 
intermissions, of recitations and of everything. The 
mechanism of the school should run like a well-regu- 
lated machine. The work should be so well organ- 
ized and its regulations followed so precisely, that the 
pupils will fall into their places easily and naturally. 
Many of the regulations do not need to be published; 
they need only to be carried out. Some should be an- 
nounced, so that from the start there may be no incon- 
venience. Parents have a right to be informed of the 
hour of opening in the morning and closing in the even- 
ing, so that they will know when to start the children to 
school and when to expect them home. Regularity is 
an excellent training in itself, and if learned and lived 
in the schoolroom will be a valuable acquirement 
through life. 
Changes and Modifications——You cannot wisely for- 
mulate all your rules and regulations at the begin- 
ning. A good deal of cutting and fitting will be nec- 
essary. Previous regulations may modify those you 
intended to follow. Emergencies that could not be 
foreseen will arise, and these will necessitate changes.
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
When a thing happens for the first time, consider it 
carefully and render a wise decision. It will form a 
precedent for future occasions. Correct precedents are 
of great value and often should grow into customs. 
Even our mistakes are valuable, as they teach us what 
to avoid, but they must not become precedents for 
future actions. 
Rules for Conduct.—Rules for conduct, that is, pub- 
lished rules, should be few. In fact none need be an- 
nounced at the beginning. Let it be taken for granted 
that the pupils are familiar with right rules of conduct 
and mean to follow them. When it becomes necessary 
to make a rule, formulate it explicitly and state it 
clearly, so that there can be no misunderstanding. 
Then see that it is observed in letter and spirit. 
When possible, rules should be directive rather than 
prohibitive. It is better to tell children what they may - 
do than what they may not do. For example, if you 
tell them when they may get drinks, or leave the room, 
you are granting a privilege. If you tell them they 
must not do these things at certain times, you are de- 
priving them of a privilege. The one usually involves 
the other, but the granting should precede the de- 
priving. 
All rules should be for the good of the greatest number. 
It may be for the good of the individual to be able to 
run to the teacher for assistance whenever he needs it, 
but it is not for the good of the school. A whole class 
is disturbed while one pupil is waited upon. In par-
-P-A-G-E-39
  THINGS TO BE KEPT IN MIND 39 
liamentary usage, a speaker’s time is his own while he 
is on the floor and the chairman may not permit any 
one to interrupt him. It is no less true in a recitation. 
The time belongs to the class and is short enough, and 
the class has a right to the undivided attention of the 
teacher until it is dismissed. 
The Teacher’s Own Standard—And finally, the most 
of the rules and the strictest should be for the teacher 
alone. He should set a high standard for himself 
and if he is new to the work, he will have the battle 
of his life in compelling himself to live up to it. There 
is no one to make him do this or that, and when the 
monotony of the daily grind of toil settles down upon 
him, he will need all his resisting power. Then it is 
that a strict set. of rules previously adopted with a 
determination to follow or die, will stand him in good 
‘stead. He should make it a rule never to appear be- 
fore his school in any but a cheerful frame of mind; 
always to be neat in person and appearance; to have 
his schoolroom in the best possible condition every 
day; to be on time in the morning and all through the 
day; never to permit his interest to flag nor his patience 
to be exhausted; never to do anything that he would 
not approve in others under like circumstances. If he 
can control himself in such rules as these, he will have 
little trouble in controlling his pupils. A good watch- 
word is Paul’s advice to Timothy, II Tim. 2:15: 
“Study to show thyself approved unto God, a work- 
man that needeth not to be ashamed.”
-P-A-G-E-40
40 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
6. OPENING EXERCISES 
It is well worth while to spend some time in plan- 
ning and preparing interesting exercises for the daily 
opening of school. 
The First Five Minutes.—At the ringing of the bell, 
all pupils, quietly and orderly, take their seats. Books 
and pencils are in the desks and remain undisturbed 
until called for. The roll is taken by merely noting the 
absentees. All join insong. A verse or two of Scripture 
is read and the Lord’s Prayer offered in concert with 
heads bowed. One or two verses of another song or 
hymn follow. 
A Regular Set of Exercises —The next five minutes 
should be devoted to a specially planned set of exer- 
cises running regularly through the entire term. The 
following is a suggested set: 
      
  Every Monday morning ........ Memory Gems. 
«Tuesday an .-Current Events. 
“Wednesday “ . .--Story for Reproduction. , 
coe UrSay Sa .-- Biography. 
«Friday So, asennee Nature Study. 
One new memory gem may be taught each week and 
as many others recited by volunteers as are known or 
as time permits. The list given by the teacher should 
be diversified, some patriotic, some religious, some 
didactic and some simple rhymes for the little ones. 
Current events may be given first by pupils and, when 
their knowledge is exhausted, by the teacher. All sen-
-P-A-G-E-41
  THINGS TO BE KEPT IN MIND 41 
sational items such as murders, trials, divorces and 
accusations should be strictly avoided. Sporting news 
likewise should be shunned. There are plenty of hap- 
penings that are safe, instructive and interesting. The 
great interests of the world may be kept track of 
from week to week, such as the government at Wash- 
ington, the Panama Canal, the doings of public men. 
Maps are useful to show locations. If they are not at 
hand, the teacher may sketch outlines on the board 
to answer the purpose. There are weekly papers pub- 
lished expressly for the purpose of supplying teachers 
with the leading events as they happen, stated briefly 
and accompanied with maps. Some one of these the 
teacher should take. ‘‘The Little Chronicle” is per- 
haps as good as any. The weekly issue of any lead- 
ing daily, containing a summary of the week’s news, 
can be obtained for a small sum. This exercise once 
a week through the term will direct the minds of the 
pupils in news gathering and will be invaluable. 
The story for reproduction should be read or told by 
the teacher; if well told, it is better than read. These 
stories should teach lessons in obedience, industry, 
faithfulness or the like. 
They may be obtained from a variety of sources, 
from readers not in use by the school, from educa- 
tional journals, histories and so forth. They should 
be short, not longer than a page of the third reader, 
and expressed in plain, easy words. When the story 
has been told, ask questions about it and let it be dis-  
-P-A-G-E-42
42 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
cussed until it is clearly understood and the main point 
grasped. Then tell the children you will expect them 
to repeat it to you next Wednesday morning, after 
which you will tell them another story. It may not be 
best for a while to ask for the reproduction in writing, 
lest it detract from the pleasure of the exercise. After 
the interest is established, it can be done with profit. 
The biographical sketches, since in a six-months term 
there is room for but twenty-four of them, should be 
chosen with a view to diversity. The list should in- 
clude the lives of statesmen, poets, inventors and phi- 
lanthropists; it should be chosen before school begins, 
in order to give time for gathering necessary material. 
The nature-study lessons necessarily must be ar- 
ranged with reference to the months. Crops, trees, 
flowers, rocks, animals, birds and insects will furnish 
abundant material for the term. The conditions in 
country schools are particularly favorable for this 
kind of work. For example, varieties of trees may 
be studied at any time of year. Each variety has its 
several means of identification, as, first, general con- 
figuration; second, leaves, their shape, size and con- 
formation; third, bark, its color, form and thickness; 
fourth, wood, its quality, texture and grain. Also 
the uses of each variety, as for shade, beauty, fruit, 
fuel and lumber, may be considered. Such knowl- 
edge has a practical and marketable value and has 
the added interest of being gained at first hand from 
nature herself,
-P-A-G-E-43
    PRACTICAL TEACHING 47 
best qualified. On the other hand, the manager who 
knows just what each man is capable of doing and can 
get him to do it, can command almost any salary he 
chooses to ask. Where the success of an institution de- 
pends upon the amount of money earned by labor, 
every minute lost counts toward failure; every man in 
the wrong place means diminished profits. 
Now the aim of the school is not to earn money, but 
to promote the mental and moral growth of all the 
pupils. Every minute lost and every stroke misapplied 
count for failure in this great aim. Hence the impor- 
tance of assigning work. 
Things the Teacher Must Know.—Before a teacher 
can assign lessons rightly, there are some things he 
must, if not absolutely, at least approximately know: 
first, what the whole work of the school is; second, what 
each grade should accomplish in a term; third, how 
much of this entire work should be assigned each day. 
Here is where a great deal of wisdom is needed. Chil- 
dren cannot do as much the first days of the term as 
they can later. Lessons should be assigned accordingly. 
The teacher must know also whether his pupils are 
bright or dull, whether there is any physical or mental 
deficiency and if so, take it into account. It is not 
necessary that all these matters be worked out each 
day, but yesterday’s judgment should be revised to 
suit to-day’s knowledge. 
Assigning a Reading Lesson.—Now actually to as- 
sign the lesson, it is not sufficient to say, “Take the
-P-A-G-E-44
  
  48 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
next lesson” or ‘Take to the bottom of page so-and-so.” 
Pupils should be told exactly what to do with the lesson 
assigned. Suppose, for example, you are assigning a 
reading lesson. Your instructions may be something 
as follows: ‘Take all of lesson twenty. Read it over 
carefully until you are sure you can tell it readily 
without the book. If there are any words whose mean- 
ings you do not know, write them down on your slate 
or notebook. Be able to spell every word in the lesson. ~ 
Practice until you are pretty sure that you can read 
it without stumbling or halting.” 
Assigning a Geography Lesson.—‘‘The lesson for to- 
morrow begins at page twenty-two and extends to 
the bottom of page twenty-four. Read the descriptive 
parts until, with proper questioning, you can recite 
them; study the picture on page twenty-four until 
you can tell everything in it, what it means and 
why it should be placed where it is; write down in a 
list the most difficult words and bring them to the 
class with you; there is no map to draw in this 
lesson.” ne 
Assigning a Number Lesson.—(1) To a class ‘some- 
what advanced: ‘Solve all problems to the 21st, be- 
ginning with the 15th; bring a written solution of the 
15th and 18th to the class; be able to tell exactly how 
these problems are solved. Observe the constant use 
of principles already learned. In the examples of busi- 
ness transactions, notice if the prices are about as we 
usually find them.”
-P-A-G-E-45
  
  PRACTICAL TEACHING 49 
(2) To a beginning class: Place on the board such 
combinations as they can master, somewhat like the 
following: 
Iti = Bethe 4+1= 
rea = 3-1= 4-1 
Ber 32 4+2= 
2 ‘Gia ean 4-25 
2 a2 Soo 4+3= 
ee S83 = Ass Oo 
Instruct the class to copy these tables at their seats, 
completing each equation with the proper number. 
In the recitations, the children may be taught to make 
the combinations concrete, as follows: ‘If John has 
one apple, and his mother gives him one more, he will 
have two apples, because one plus one are two.” 
“Tf Mary has three pennies and spends one for 
candy, she will have two pennies left, because three 
minus one are two, etc.” When they can do this readily, 
they may be asked to make similar stories for the com- 
binations on the board, using familiar objects such as 
apples, pennies, balls, tops and the like. This will 
teach them to think and to apply their knowledge as 
they acquire it. 
It is not convenient in a work like this to do more 
than make a few suggestions of a general nature, such 
as the above, but the subject is none the less important 
and should receive the most careful and constant at- 
tention of the teacher. No lesson should ever be as- 
signed carelessly.

2. OCCUPATION FOR YOUNGEST PUPILS 
One of the difficult problems is to know how to 
keep the little ones pleasantly and profitably occupied 
while the numerous classes above them are being heard. 
In the daily program suggested in Chapter IT, such 
general terms as ‘‘ busy work” and ‘‘copying” are used. 
Lest young teachers should find them more puzzling 
than helpful, the following directions are offered: 
Busy Work.—Let the teacher be supplied with some 
simple materials, such as grains of corn, wooden tooth- 
picks, circular bits of paper of different colors, spools, 
etc. Give each child a few toothpicks and grains of 
corn. Ask them to build two pens, so many rails 
high, and put two “‘pigs” in each; then find how many 
“pigs” in both pens; build three pens and put three 
“pigs” in each, driving some from one pen to another. 
The children by their own ingenuity will very soon 
find plenty of variations. 
The circular bits of paper may be strung into fes- 
toons with a needle and thread, putting so many red, so 
many white and so many blue ones together. What- 
ever the colors and whatever the order, it should be 
done exactly as prescribed, so that in addition to count- 
ing, accuracy will be learned. 
The spools in a similar way may be used for counting, 
adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing; thus, 
“Tf you have twelve spools and divide them among 
four boys, how many will each get? How many times  
-P-A-G-E-47
PRACTICAL TEACHING SI 
four in twelve? How many times three in twelve?” 
and so on. Black and white buttons, or melon seeds, 
will answer for ‘‘sheep,” while smaller buttons or 
seeds may be used for “‘chickens.” If the teacher will 
suggest a few things, the children will think of many 
others. A half minute’s instructions will keep them 
going while a class is being heard. Let it be remem- 
bered that every great teacher of primary pupils uses 
such simple material as the above, and keeps thinking 
constantly of new ways as occasion demands. 
Copying.—This is a general term meant to include all 
work taken from the blackboard, chart or readers. 
The children may write words and sentences, or draw 
simple forms either from chart or blackboard, or from 
the objects themselves. 
The teacher should study to provide work that will 
be profitable as well as entertaining. 
3. Usr or Lrsson-PERIOD 
It is feared that many teachers, especially those who 
are young in experience, do not fully realize the im- 
portance of the lesson-period, the recitation of the 
lesson after it is supposed to be learned. Too often it 
is a mere reciting of what has been committed for the 
purpose, without any adequate idea of the real mean- 
ing or of its connection with their lives. Jt should not 
be so much a reciting as an analyzing, comparing, 
weighing, collecting, adapting, stating and assimilating. 
  
e
-P-A-G-E-48
    52 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
When the lesson is completed, the knowledge it con- 
tains should be the pupil’s knowledge, ready for use 
at any time, and the sooner he has an opportunity to 
use it the better. 
Accumulating Knowledge.—To illustrate the use of the 
study-period and the recitation, let us imagine a group 
of children gathering flowers in an open field. ‘They 
are attracted by the bright and gaudy. They have not 
the judgment to discriminate between the good and the 
best. If they come to a beautiful rose and prick their 
fingers on its thorns, they turn away in disgust. Finally 
they return, arms laden with the good, the bad and the 
indifferent, and pile them down in a miscellaneous heap 
at the teacher’s feet. 
Analysis and Selection.—Now comes the time of real 
value. ‘The instructor first separates the mass; then 
he selects the different varieties, putting each kind 
by itself; the worthless ones are thrown aside. The 
children keep up a running fire of comment and 
questioning, telling where they got this and asking 
about that. ‘The teacher replies to their questioning, 
hears their comments and gives them bits of informa- 
tion that they could not have discovered alone. An 
unusually fine specimen appears, and a bright boy 
cries out, “I found that one. It was away up on a 
sharp ledge and there were thorns and briers in the 
way. The others said they wouldn’t climb up there 
for it, but I did and got it.” The teacher commends 
his efforts and shares in his enthusiasm. ‘The boy feels  
-P-A-G-E-49
  PRACTICAL TEACHING 53 
well repaid and disregards bruises and_ scratches. 
Others are silently vowing that they will not hesitate 
when opportunity offers again. 
Now the separated bunches are examined more 
closely. The teacher explains why certain ones were 
discarded. Some would wither quickly, some were 
poison, some gave out an unpleasant odor. The good 
kinds next receive attention. After they have been 
sufficiently examined and discussed, the teacher tells 
the pupils they may select specimens from the several 
varieties and each make a bouquet for himself. They 
set about it, eagerly questioning and exclaiming. The 
faculties of attention, discrimination and judgment are 
allengaged. Memory also comes in to give aid. Pres- 
ently the bouquets are finished and each one bears 
away his trophy, pleased in proportion to the amount 
of care and energy he has put into it. The teacher turns 
to other duties, but the children will not soon forget 
their morning’s' task. They will live over and over 
again the details of both the gathering and the classify- 
ing, and particularly will they remember the interesting 
things the teacher told them. Matter thus learned can 
never be lost. 
Every lesson whose aim is knowledge is something 
like this, and the searching teacher may read in the 
story the part he should play in the lesson-period. 
But for those who must have the conventional, a 
systematic outline of the various things to be accom- 
plished, is appended. 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  54 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Important Features of the Lesson-Period.—(r) It is 
the time when the minds of pupils and teacher meet 
upon a common subject; the one to receive, the other 
to impart knowledge, or, rather, the one to search and 
the other to direct the searching. 
(2) It gives the pupils occasion to tell what they have 
learned, and thus give expression to their new-found 
knowledge, for we are never sure of knowledge or power 
until we have in some way given expression to it. 
(3) The pupils may ask questions upon knotty 
points and should be not only allowed but encouraged 
to do so quite freely. Moreover, the kind of questions 
they ask will show how well or how poorly they have 
used the study-period and how much their interest has 
been aroused. 
(4) It affords an opportunity to correct wrong ideas, 
which they will be sure to have gathered because of their 
limited experiences in the fields they are exploring. 
(5) It gives them a chance to show to the teacher 
how well they have improved their time and to receive 
their due reward of commendation. If the children 
have really put forth effort and accomplished some- 
thing, they look forward eagerly to the class time. 
The teacher is the only one who can fully appreciate 
their efforts and measure for them the amount and 
value of what they have acquired. If there is no 
one to do this measuring of results, the zeal of the 
pupil soon languishes. Even adults cannot get along 
wholly without it.
-P-A-G-E-51
  PRACTICAL TEACHING 55 
(6) It is a test of their ability to master the subject. 
This is one of the most important features of the lesson- 
period and one that will tax the ingenuity of the teacher 
to the utmost. The greatest care and skill is needed 
in probing into the minds of young children without 
causing them to shrink or to be frightened into silence. 
It requires a kind of painless mental surgery that 
every teacher should strive to master. 
(7) The pupils must have the teacher’s assistance 
in determining the important parts and in getting each 
into its proper relations with the rest. Often it re- 
quires considerable wisdom to do this. As a rule, the 
teacher should not tell which of two ideas is the more 
important, but rather should point out the qualities 
that measure the value of each and let the pupil judge 
for himself in the light of these qualities. 
(8) The lesson-period serves to keep the connection 
between present knowledge and that which has been 
previously learned. All new knowledge is gained by 
means of what we have in store, and as fast as the 
new is gathered, it must be properly classified, named 
and placed where it belongs. 
(9) It permits the teacher to fire the minds of the 
pupils with new zeal for what is yet to be learned. 
This is one of the delights of teaching, to keep pointing 
to larger fields, greater achievements and vaster possi- 
bilities. This may be done with perfect safety and 
assurance, because the farther we climb, the broader 
the view and the more enchanting the vision.
-P-A-G-E-52
56 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
(10) It gives time for the assignment of the next 
lesson and the measure of its amount. This has al- 
ready been noted and need not be discussed further. 
These are perhaps the principal items to be observed 
in the lesson-period, where the main object is the ac- 
quisition of knowledge or of mental culture. If the 
aim of the lesson should be the gaining of skill, as in 
a writing or drawing exercise, or in the committing of 
forms such as tables or declensions, other features may 
come in, but the above items are general enough to 
suit all cases and should always be kept in mind. 
4. EXPLAINING AND IMPRESSING 
An Essential of Teaching—When in any lesson a 
difficulty that is beyond the comprehension of the pu- 
pils arises, it is the duty of the teacher to make it plain 
to their understanding. In reading there are frequent 
allusions that the children cannot possibly understand 
until the thing alluded to is explained. Such expres- 
sions as “he was being used as a cat’s paw,” “he 
threw down the gauntlet,” ‘‘he has an ax to grind,” 
all refer to stories or customs that are supposed to be 
well known to everybody. If the teacher has been 
properly trained, he will know the origin and be able 
to give the explanation of all such allusions. They 
are a part of the wisdom of the race and children should 
learn them as early as they can grasp their meaning. 
Geography, arithmetic, history and grammar teem
-P-A-G-E-53
PRACTICAL TEACHING 57 
with matter that must be explained before it can be 
understood, and every good teacher is a good ex- 
plainer. It is one of the essentials of teaching. 
Simple Language a Necessity—The first thing to 
observe is that the explanation must be within the 
comprehension of the child. The language should be 
plain and simple. It should be expressed in short sen- 
tences, each containing but one statement, and this 
should be grasped before the next is given. One point 
at a time is the rule and let it be made so clear that the 
dullest can’ understand it. 
When a difficult matter has been explained until it 
is supposed to be understood, ask one of the pupils to 
give it in his own words. If there is any hitch, it will 
appear and assistance can be rendered at just the right 
place. As early as possible children should be taught 
to locate and state the difficult things they encounter. 
When they can do this readily, explanations become 
easy. They should be taught also to use every possi- 
ble means to solve the difficulties themselves. Gradu- 
ally the teacher will cease to give information directly, 
but will tell them how or where to find it. 
The Value of Illustrations.—Again, in explaining a 
difficult point, the teacher should be ready with illustra- 
tions. He must be able to tell the pupils that it is like 
this or that with which they are familiar. The greatest 
teachers in the world have been those who were readiest 
with illustrations. Thinking of apt illustrations may 
be an art, but it is one not so very difficult to acquire.
-P-A-G-E-54
  58 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
The things that are “like” abound everywhere, if we 
will but learn to see and use them. 
Clinching the Impression.—Not only should we make 
difficult matters plain to the understanding, but we 
should impress them upon the mind in such a way that 
they will not be forgotten. This is true of many of the 
easy things as well as of the difficult ones. The chil- 
dren cannot judge of the importance of what they 
learn. Little things and great things are put in the 
same kind of type without any emphasis or marking 
that indicates their relative importance. The teacher 
must furnish the emphasis. 
A point may be emphasized by repeating it, by stat- 
ing why it is important, or by relating some incident 
in connection with it that shows its importance. What- 
ever the way, the one thing needful is the attention of 
the class. When this is secured and there is some- 
thing worth while to hold it, then see that the impres- 
sion is made and clinched. It is like a blacksmith 
fashioning a horseshoe out of a bar of heated iron. 
There is much in knowing just when to strike. 
5. QUESTIONING 
The teacher, like the lawyer, should be an expert 
questioner. A sharp question has the same effect upon 
the mind that a spur has upon a lagging horse. It 
stimulates to activity; and the teacher should know 
how and when to use it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
    PRACTICAL TEACHING 59 
Four Classes of Questions.—For convenience of dis- 
cussion, we may divide our subject into four classes as 
follows: . 
(1) Questions that may be answered by yes or no; as, 
Have you prepared your lesson? Did you see Mr. 
Smith yesterday ? 
(2) Questions that may be answered by facts or by 
information that has been set as a task; as, How far 
does your lesson extend? How many pecks in a 
bushel ? 
(3) Questions that will bring out difficulties or that 
will involve contradictions; as, Use a personal pronoun 
in the common gender, third person and singular num- 
ber. Can you draw a right-angled triangle with the 
three sides equal ? 
(4) Questions involving other questions that can be 
determined only by discovering all the facts underlying 
the main question. Such are called leading questions. 
Examples: Why is the verb the most important of all 
the parts of speech? Why is the robin so great a 
favorite ? 
Each of these classes has its proper use, but trouble 
arises when one class is used for another. There are 
raany questions that can and should be answered by 
yes or no, but when the teacher asks an information 
question by furnishing the information (as, How many 
quarts in a peck? Eight, are there not?), the whole 
thing is wrong. 
Questions Should Be Intelligent.—In questioning pupils
-P-A-G-E-56
  60 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
upon their lessons to test their knowledge, it is best 
to drive straight to the point, but the question should 
never indicate the answer. It should go without 
saying that the teacher who would ask intelligent 
questions must be familiar with the contents of the 
lesson and know also the correct answers. ‘There is no 
incentive to the pupils to learn, when the teacher him- 
self is obliged to look in the book for the answer. The 
pupils will very properly conclude that if the teacher 
does not need to know this, there is no necessity for 
their learning it. On the other hand, if the teacher 
is thoroughly familiar with the knowledge of the lesson 
and knows much besides, it is a great incentive to the 
pupils. 
Every teacher should practice the art of questioning 
until he can bore through a subject and leave nothing 
more to be asked. 
Pupils Should Formulate Questions.—Pupils also should 
be taught to make questions upon their lessons. Let 
them see how many they can ask upon a given topic, 
and then let these be criticised kindly by the teacher. 
In many cases there is no better way to attack a lesson 
than by formulating as many questions as possible 
from it, and then proceeding to find the answers. 
6. REVIEWING 
Why It Is Necessary.—Since all knowledge in order 
to be useful must be properly classified, tagged and
-P-A-G-E-57
  PRACTICAL TEACHING 61 
put where it belongs, that is, with other knowledge of 
like kind, it follows that every lesson must be linked 
with those that have gone before. The principles and 
facts previously learned must be brought before the 
mind so that the new may be seen in its relation to the 
old. For this, if for no other reason, there should be 
in every lesson some review of yesterday’s work and 
frequently of. the whole subject so far as it has pro- 
gressed; but there are other reasons for reviewing. 
Whether the subject be arithmetic, grammar, geog- 
raphy, history or what not, the assignment of daily 
lessons tends to chop it up into separate bits. When 
it is completed, it should be in the mind as one connected 
whole and this cannot be accomplished unless we attend 
to the daily reviews. Some member of the class should 
be called upon to state in a few words the principal 
features of the last lesson. If the lesson is upon a topic 
that has been running for some time, as the verb in 
grammar, or an epoch in history, or a continent in 
geography, let some one give the principal heads from 
the beginning up to the present. This will preserve the 
unity of the subject, which is important. 
Again, review is necessary in order to ascertain the 
degree of proficiency attained by the class. Each member 
should have his turn for individual testing. If this is 
done as it should be, there will be no occasion for going 
again over this particular book or subject. As a rule, 
it is poor economy to spend days, or as often happens, 
weeks, in going over a series of lessons a second time.
-P-A-G-E-58
  62 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
All the freshness, which is the main stimulus to effort, 
is gone. Besides, if the pupils know that they are to 
have a second trial, they are likely to slight their work, 
thinking that they will get it in review. Thus they fall 
into slovenly habits. Often it is wise to study a given 
subject a second or even a third time, but it should 
always be a different treatment, introducing new and 
more difficult features. 
Advantages of the Written Review.—From the fourth 
reader class upward, a written test should be given for 
every ten lessons. By this plan a leading or test ques- 
tion may be asked on each lesson. 
The advantages to be gained by this will amply re- 
pay the time and trouble. It will enable the teacher to 
measure more accurately than he otherwise could, the 
distinctness and thoroughness of the pupils’ knowledge; 
it will cause him to look for the most searching ques- 
tions and to state them clearly and concisely; knowing 
that these questions are coming, his instruction will be 
sharper in seeing that difficult points are made clear; 
the questions will serve as nails to fasten thoughts and 
principles in the pupils’ minds, and will aid in forming 
right judgments as to the chief points in the lessons. 
On the part of the pupils, the knowledge that an 
examination is coming will cause them to take a deeper 
interest in their work, and to make sure of their grasp 
of every subject; also an examination is a relief from 
the monotony of the daily routine; it furnishes a key 
for the pupils to their own standing in the light of the
-P-A-G-E-59
  PRACTICAL TEACHING 63 
teacher’s questions, the things that he considers im- 
portant; it shows the amount gained in the last ten 
lessons, whether much or little, and is a spur to greater 
effort if the amount seems small; almost invariably 
pupils look up the questions they have failed to answer 
and thereby make important gains. 
In addition to all these advantages, the custom of 
having written tests gives strength to both teacher and 
pupils; it puts them on an understanding and furnishes 
a basis for going over again in the light of their failures 
the difficult parts of the lessons. Lastly, for the clear, 
accurate ang concise expression of thoughts, there is 
nothing that will take the place of writing. Too little 
of it is done in the schools. Unless pupils have suffi- 
cient practice, they dread written examinations and 
from fright and nervousness often fail to do themselves 
justice, but when the tests are given frequently and 
regularly they are looked forward to with pleasure and 
eagerness. Such has been the writer’s experience. 
7. INCREASING ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
The Key to Attention—Every experienced teacher 
knows that attention is absolutely necessary to learn- 
ing. No new thing can be comprehended or remem- 
bered without it. Not a listless, half-hearted, but an 
eager, all-absorbing attention must be given, and it 
should be given voluntarily. When it is secured by the 
constant calling back of wandering minds, it is of little
-P-A-G-E-60
  64 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
value. How to secure and hold the attention is one of 
the greatest problems of the teacher. 
Now the key to attention is interest. So long as in- 
terest holds, attention is freely given; but as the one 
diminishes, the other lags. When the teacher finds it 
necessary to call jor attention, he may know that interest 
is on the wane. ‘Then is the time to change tactics, to 
reorganize one’s forces, to bring up the reserves. Un- 
less interest is regained, defeat is inevitable. Let us 
then consider this important matter. 
_ Why Children Lose Interest—When a teacher first 
enters a school, he is not responsible for the interest, 
or lack of it, that the pupils may have in acquiring 
knowledge. But he is responsible for it in the subjects 
he teaches. It is not a very difficult matter to arouse 
the interest of children. The difficulty lies in holding 
it. Knowledge itself, if rightly presented, will awaken 
and develop interest. Therefore, if the lesson drags, 
the teacher should take himself vigorously to task to 
discover the cause. Jt may be accounted for in one of 
two ways; either the subject-matter is not adapted to the 
understanding of the children, or it is not presented to 
them in a right manner. Our constant care should be 
that the lessons should not be too deep for their under- 
standing; that they should be connected with their ex- 
periences and expressed in language that they can 
understand. : 
It is equally essential that the teacher should be in- 
terested and in full sympathy with his pupils. Remem- 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
PRACTICAL TEACHING 6 5 
ber that a live teacher makes a live school. If the in- 
terest dulls, never blame the children, but take it all upon 
yourself. 
Knowledge Should Be Usable——The above points 
should be strictly observed and great care taken to 
present all lessons in an interesting manner. They 
must be made to touch the lives of the children in their 
everyday experiences. Knowledge to be interesting 
must be usable, and it falls upon the teacher to show 
his pupils how to use it. Every child is interested in 
something and is anxious to learn more about that 
something. The teacher should find out his interests 
and make his beginnings from them. If horses or dogs 
attract the pupil, he must tell him new things about 
them and show him how he can find out much more by 
learning to read. If, for example, his interest lies in 
horses, the teacher may read to him the story of Alexan- 
der the Great at fourteen years of age, riding a fiery 
young horse that no one else could master. This will 
arouse his interest in Alexander, so that he will want to 
know all about him and he will go from interest to in- 
terest until he is safely on the highway to knowledge. 
If dogs appeal to him more, he may be told of the 
dogs of St. Bernard rescuing travelers from the snow in 
the Alps mountains, and a like result will follow. 
Reading and spelling lessons made about the objects 
with which pupils are familiar, such as the chickens, 
the pigs, the baby, are just as good and often far more 
interesting than the lessons in the books, even though 
Dist. School—s, 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  66 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
the latter treat of the same things.. Number and lan- 
guage lessons may be prepared in a similar way. 
Keep the pupils on the search for the things about 
which they are studying, test and tax their knowledge 
constantly and encourage them to greater achievements. 
Stimulus in Variety—One of the things that kills 
interest is monotony. The daily routine becomes a 
grind. It is a good idea to change frequently the 
method of hearing the class. Children, and grown 
people, too, for that matter, like to be surprised with 
new things or at least with variations. New features 
should be introduced in the reading, the geography and 
the number lessons. Encourage the children to talk 
freely about their work, not only in the recitation but 
at the intermissions, on the way to and from school, 
anywhere and everywhere, lest they fall into the habit 
of supposing the knowledge of the school pertains only 
to the classroom. 
8. Goop MANNERS AND Goop Morats 
Character-Building of First Importance.—In our zeal 
in pursuing the various branches of study and in our 
haste to complete the books or to cover certain amounts, 
there is danger of neglecting the greater things of life. 
It will be admitted readily by all that the development 
of a strong and upright character is of infinitely more 
importance than efficiency in special knowledge. To 
illustrate, it is more important that a boy should be
-P-A-G-E-63
PRACTICAL TEACHING 67 
trained in strict honesty than that he become an expert 
in arithmetic; that he be instructed in purity of life 
rather than accomplished in grammar; that he be 
taught politeness and filial duty, rather than history 
and geography. Not that these minor duties should 
be neglected, but that they should not be followed to 
the exclusion of the others, lest we be condemned by 
the Great Teacher’s injunction, “These things ought 
ye to have done and not have left the others undone.” 
Moral Lessons in Everyday Text-Books.—Some one may 
say that if the teaching of morals be of so great 
importance, why is there not a text-book so that the 
lessons may be assigned and heard? It is true that 
there is no special text-book in morals, but fortunately 
many of the text-books in the common branches are 
well supplied with moral lessons. Most of the public 
school readers abound in healthful examples of conduct, 
with many opportunities for an alert teacher to make 
lasting impressions. History is rich in heroism and 
patriotism and if rightly taught cannot fail to make its 
imprint upon character. Like Scripture, history is for 
edification and should be studied more for its wisdom 
than for abstract knowledge. Even arithmetic has its 
moral value. Neatness, accuracy and honest work are 
virtues well worth cultivating. The singing of patriotic 
songs is a power for righteousness and should have a 
regular place in the daily program of every school. 
Common Forms of Politeness.—These likewise should 
receive as much attention as is necessary to secure their
-P-A-G-E-64
68 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
ready and constant observance on the part of every 
pupil. These forms are not inherited; they must be 
learned and practiced. Every child has as much right 
to be taught how to act in good society as he has to be 
taught to read. Little courtesies like “please” and 
“thank you” should be insisted upon, whether pupils 
are speaking to the teacher or to each other. In many 
homes the niceties of life are neither practiced nor 
taught, and if children do not learn them at school 
they will grow up uncultured and rude. Nothing pays 
better than politeness and no opportunity to inculcate 
it should be overlooked. 
The Force of Example.—In both manners and morals 
the best instruction is the example of the teacher. 
Precept is valuable when it is backed up by example; 
but precept without example is practically worthless. 
The teacher stands in the eyes of the pupils as the 
embodiment of all that is wise and good. His every 
act will be imitated. Even his mannerisms will be 
copied. If he permits himself to do wrong or doubt- 
ful things, the pupils will do them and quote him as 
their example. In conduct and manners the teacher 
should never do anything he would disapprove in his 
pupils. 
g. GooD ORDER 
Quiet in the Schoolroom.—The school is a study room. 
Quietness is conducive to study. It follows that the 
schoolroom should have quietness. But it is also a
-P-A-G-E-65
PRACTICAL TEACHING 69 
workshop where certain activities are constantly going 
forward. These necessitate noise. How shall we make 
the two ideas compatible? In this way: During most 
of the day the majority of the pupils are in their seats 
studying; they can and should be quiet. Those who 
are reciting should be drawn to the front, nearest the 
teacher’s desk, and thus removed from the immediate 
presence of those who are engaged in study. The 
noise of the recitation being a regular thing and a part 
of the school, is but little disturbing. The calling and 
dismissing of classes should be done as quietly and as 
expeditiously as possible. 
Common Sources of Disorder.—Order means every- 
thing done in the time and in the way it should be or as 
agreed upon. Any irregularity that is unnecessary or 
not done for the good of the school is disorder. Any 
disturbance that is necessary must be endured, such 
as attending to the fire or adjusting the windows. All 
unnecessary disturbances must be avoided. That is the 
tule. 
The most common sources of disorder are whisper- 
ing, running to the teacher for information, getting 
drinks and leaving the room. Scores of other annoy- 
ances are liable to happen, but the above constitute 
three fourths of the disorder in the average school. 
So a few words about each, with some general princi- 
ples, must suffice for all. 
Whispering——Many teachers prefer not to forbid 
whispering entirely. ‘The trouble of carrying out such
-P-A-G-E-66
  7° TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
a rule and the inconvenience it entails upon the pupils 
seem to be sufficient reasons for this. But it must be 
curtailed by some means. ‘There is nothing more an- 
noying than constant whispering. Conversation should 
be absolutely prohibited, and if two or more pupils 
engage in any considerable amount of whispering, 
they should be made to understand, gently but firmly, 
that it cannot be. Separation may be sufficient, but if 
it is not, something more drastic should be used. The 
main thing is that the teacher should be determined, 
but should not use any harsher means than are neces- 
sary to keep down the evil. 
Running to the Teacher.—In years of visiting in coun- 
try districts, the writer has observed a prevailing habit 
that almost ruins many otherwise good schools. It is 
that of running to the teacher to have a word pro- 
nounced. While he is hearing a class, a string of chil- 
dren extending from the seats to his elbow keeps up 
a constant interruption. A child comes up with his 
finger pointing to a word that he perhaps knows very 
well, or could easily find out, and while he looks out 
the window and gazes about, thrusts the book at the 
teacher, who without a question or a suggestion tells 
him the word. He goes. back to his seat often not 
knowing what the teacher said. The next child with 
finger pointed extends his book and so the procession 
continues. When the last one has had his turn, the first 
is ready to begin the next round. The pupils reciting 
must either wait or go on as best they may. 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
ee a a Ry Sa en ee Me eee 
"PRACTICAL TEACHING 7 
The remedy for this evil need not be difficult. The 
shortest way is simply to say it must not be done. The 
pupils reciting have a right to the undivided attention 
of the teacher during the short space allowed them. 
Let the children write down the words they cannot 
pronounce and bring them to the class. If the parents 
insist that the children be told the words, as it is said 
they frequently do, then put every child who comes up 
through a process of effort. Ask the child to pronounce 
the word himself; if he cannot, have him spell it. If 
he still fails, ask some other member of the class to 
pronounce it for him. Then let him write the word 
upon the blackboard several times. Such a method 
persisted in for a few days will practically cure the 
trouble without forbidding it. His attention having 
been called to it, no self-respecting teacher will suffer 
it to go on to the detriment of his school. 
Other Interruptions.—For such interruptions as going 
for drinks and leaving the room, no stringent rules 
need be laid down. They are often caused by restless- 
ness. Children grow tired sitting on hard benches 
through long sessions. A recess of five minutes at the 
end of each hour is better than interruption and gives 
all an opportunity for exercise. Calisthenic drills, sing- 
ing and marching, or running around the room (always 
with windows open) will prove a relief to the tedium 
of long hours in the forenoon or of dull ones in the after- 
noon. If one or two pupils persist in having many 
wants, a little private conversation will usually mend
-P-A-G-E-68
  72 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
the matter. If it does not, some small penalty sufficient 
to offset the pleasure derived should be resorted to. 
to. RECESSES AND INTERMISSIONS 
Educational Value of Rest-Periods.—It seems not to 
have occurred to many teachers to consider the rest- 
periods as having any educational value. ‘They are 
looked upon as being merely a cessation from the labor 
of the schoolroom. Yet those who study the lives of 
children attach great importance to play. It is one of 
the main features of childhood and youth, and the 
delight and usefulness of it.extend well into age. The 
well-equipped gymnasiums, extensive athletic fields, 
high-salaried physical directors, and costly parapher- 
nalia of the large colleges are proof that much atten- 
tion is given it in higher education. But if grown 
boys and girls need all these, how very much more 
necessary is it that growing children should have some 
provisions made for them and be given directions in 
their play and games. 
No work devised by man can take the place of play 
for recreation, for physical and mental exercise and 
for pure enjoyment. A child wholly deprived of play 
is one of the saddest spectacles in the world, as he not 
only loses the greatest pleasure of childhood, but his 
physical and mental development is out of the ques- 
tion. Those who play but little are usually lacking 
in strength, agility, courage and in social qualities.
-P-A-G-E-69
PRACTICAL TEACHING 73 
Children expand their lungs, train their voices and 
develop their muscles on the playground. It is truly 
democratic; every one stands upon his own merits. 
Each desirable place must be won over all competitors 
with no favors or political ‘pulls.’ The champion 
runner, jumper, wrestler, though’the poorest boy in the 
district, is accorded his meed of praise and admiration 
as honestly and certainly as though he were the rich- 
est. Here, too, leadership is developed and in the 
friendly strivings each boy learns pretty accurately the 
measure of his own powers. 
Rules Regulating Intermissions.—It will be well to 
observe the’ following rules in regard to the intermis- 
sions: First,'they should come as regularly and as cer- 
tainly as ‘the lessons. Children are extremely jealous 
of their intermissions and it is best to observe them 
sacredly. Second, the recesses should not be less than 
fifteen minutes each and the noon intermission a full 
hour. Third, it is the teacher’s province and duty 
to see that the entire intermission is employed to 
some good purpose by all the pupils. As a rule, in 
country schools it is wise to allow boys and girls to 
play together. However, if this is done, the teacher 
should always be on the ground and would better join 
in the games. The little ones should have a space to 
themselves and their proper share of supervision. 
So long as the children know what they want to 
play and all take part with zest, the teacher need offer 
no suggestions; but the list of games in country schools
-P-A-G-E-70
714 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
is often quite limited and they weary of them. In such 
a case, the pupils will be delighted if the teacher pro- 
poses some new game or a new way to play an old 
one. All games should be played earnestly and vigor- 
ously, the teacher setting the example. If he shows 
little interest, his mood will be caught quickly by others 
and all usefulness destroyed. When the interest lags, 
it is time to stop. 
Just here a word of caution may be uttered. Boss- 
ing and scolding on the playground should be strictly 
avoided. The teacher should take note of any mis- 
conduct, should see that no one is slighted or imposed 
upon and that all proper relations are observed; but 
any unwarranted instruction will be resented. Play to 
be enjoyed must be free and untrammeled, yet free- 
dom is not license to wrongdoing. The tactful teacher 
will know when to interfere and when to refrain. If 
his motives are right, he is not likely to commit any 
serious error. 
The Noon Hour.—This is valuable in that its length 
gives an opportunity for a variety of exercises. It is 
delightful when the luncheon is eaten in'a group with 
the teacher. Plenty of time should be taken and con- 
versation should flow easily and pleasantly. The 
teacher may quietly take the lead, encouraging others 
to follow and using tact in bringing out the timid ones. 
No difficult or embarrassing questions should be pro- 
posed, nor anything unpleasant allowed to mar the 
happiness of the occasion. With a little forethought 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  PRACTICAL TEACHING 75 
and planning it can be made the most cheerful part of 
the day. No one should leave the group without ask- 
ing to be excused. When the teacher rises, the cere- 
mony is over. Thus conducted, the art of conversation 
is cultivated, valuable information imparted and social 
courtesies inculcated. Interesting items of current 
news, clever stories and friendly discussions will form 
a sufficient program to make the time pass quickly 
and pleasantly. A song or short reading at the close 
will often be fitting. The time occupied need not be 
more than twenty minutes. 
Proper Physical Exercise——A good half-hour is left 
for play. If croquet, tennis and basket-ball could be 
provided in country schools, it would be an excellent 
thing and there seems no good reason why they should 
not be. The cost would be but slight and far out- 
weighed by the results. These games cultivate skill 
and mental alertness, and furnish enough physical 
exercise without the severity and roughness of baseball 
and football. If the large boys prefer baseball to all 
other games, there is no serious objection, provided 
those who do not care for it have something else as 
good. 
The recesses being short may be occupied with 
sharp physical exercise games such as running, jump- 
ing, or leapfrog for the boys, and pull-away or drop- 
the-handkerchief for the girls. 
Purely mental games such as checkers, chess, inno- 
cent card games, as Authors or History, should be
-P-A-G-E-72
  76 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
indulged in sparely, not because they are harmful, but 
because they do not furnish physical exercise. If 
used at all, they should be reserved for bad weather. 
Riddles, conundrums and other guessing contests are 
suitable at any time when the school is gathered in a 
quiet circle. Games of chance, of marbles for keeps 
and all that lead to gambling, if they show any signs of 
appearing, must be kindly but firmly forbidden. When 
playtime is over, the call to work should be short and 
sharp. All should stop at the first tap of the bell and 
no loitering should be permitted. 
Longer intermissions for the little ones have been 
provided for in a previous chapter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
CHAPTER IV 
THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 
1. THos— WHO Do Nor Come 
In almost every country district there are pupils, 
sometimes few, but too often many, who do not attend. 
They are of school age, their names are on the census 
roll, their apportionment is paid by the state, but they 
do not present themselves, their names are not on the 
teacher’s roll and all the advantages of the school 
might as well not exist so far as they are concerned. 
When one visits an average district school and notes 
the bright faces of the pupils, their eagerness to learn 
and the progress they are evidently making, and then 
considers the large percentage who ought to be there, 
but are not, his heart goes out in pity for the absentees. 
The Necessity of Investigation—The question arises, 
what is the teacher’s duty in such cases and what 
should be his method of procedure ? 
There may be a few who are properly exempt. Some 
may have finished the common-school course and 
-should not attend to take the teacher’s time with higher 
studies. , Such should be encouraged to go to a more 
advanced school. Some may be married and have 
77  
-P-A-G-E-74
  78 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
home duties that preclude the possibility of further 
schooling. The remainder ought to be in attendance 
and each individual case should be thoroughly inves- 
tigated. 
Causes of Chronic Absence.—As a rule, the causes for 
chronic absence may be classed under a few heads. 
The first and most prevailing is the indifference of 
parents. None are so blind to the need of education 
as the ignorant. People who are devoid of learning 
usually do not appreciate its advantages for either 
themselves or their children. These should be awak- 
ened, aroused and interested by any and every reason- 
able means. They should be shown that they are de- 
priving their children of their most precious heritage, 
and of that which rightly belongs to them. Appeals 
should be made also to the children. If they can be so 
aroused that they will clamor to come, the parents are 
not likely to hold out against them. 
Factional strife is another cause almost as prevalent 
as the first and more difficult to overcome. Neighbor- 
hood quarrels arising from jealousy, desire to rule, 
fancied slights or what not, are often waged bitterly 
for years, and where they exist, it needs but a slight 
excuse to keep the children out. ‘“A” will not send 
his children, because in his opinion a mistake was made 
in the selection of the teacher. His daughter, son or 
nephew would have been much better. “B” keeps 
his children out, because ‘‘C’s”’ are better dressed and 
put on airs. ‘“D” imagines the teacher is partial, and
-P-A-G-E-75
THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 79 
has a “pick” at his little ones and will not give them 
a fair chance to learn, and so on. 
It requires patience, tact and love to adjust these 
fancied wrongs, for such they usually are, but with 
perseverance the wise teacher may hope to succeed. 
He must be extremely careful not to appear to take 
either side, nor to show favor to one more than, to 
another. He must not praise “A’s” children in the: , 
presence of ‘‘B.”’ He must be equally send to ‘All 
with malice toward none. se 
A third cause lies in the children themselves. _Sur- 
rounded by unlearned people, they have no way of 
knowing the value of an education. The parents would 
like to have their children taught, but do not know 
how to inspire them. The atmosphere in cultured 
homes is a constant inducement to the children to get 
knowledge, but where ignorance abounds there is no 
such incentive, and as the stream cannot rise above 
its source, these children will not have an ambition 
to rise, unless some outside pressure be brought to bear 
upon them. Here is the teacher’s opportunity. 
The Best Remedy.—But whatever the causes, let it 
be borne in mind that the best remedy, the greatest 
inducement, is an excellent-school; one wherein is a 
live teacher, efficient, eager to grasp every opportunity, 
and in love with his work; where the pupils delight in 
their tasks and are happy and contented. Such a 
school has a positive ring about it that commands re- 
spect. It has an attraction that will draw like a magnet. e
-P-A-G-E-76
  80 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
School Attendance an Obligation.—Yet the live teacher 
will not be content to work simply within the walls 
of his schoolroom. Before the term begins, he will 
do all he can to advertise it, to awaken interest, to 
inspire his patrons’ confidence in his own efficiency. 
He will impress it upon the district that the school is 
not for a few but for all; that provisions have been 
made at great pains and expense for the education of 
every child, and that the county, the state and the 
nation expect him to make good use of it. It is like 
a precious legacy left by a loving friend in his last will 
and testament, which to refuse is to insult the giver. 
It is the highest loyalty to do what is expected of us. 
If parents, therefore, would be strictly loyal, they must 
send their children to school. The law requires it and 
it is the nation’s greatest safeguard. 
Ways of Winning Parents and Children.—After the 
school is organized and well under way, the teacher 
will look over the census roll to see if any have not 
entered. He will make a list of the absent ones and 
inquire about them. He will ask the other children 
to urge them to come. He will visit the families, talk 
with the parents, make friends of the children and 
cause them to feel easy in his presence. He will carry 
brightness into cheerless homes and thus by showing 
a real interest in their welfare will win both the parents 
and the children. 
Lastly, he will have public exercises at not tooggreat 
intervals. The parents need instruction as well as the
-P-A-G-E-77
THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 81 
children, and they are not too old to learn. The school 
should be the center of attraction for the whole neigh- 
borhood and any patron or friend should be wel- 
come at any time, but lest the privilege should be 
neglected, these special occasions are made. Sugges- 
tions as to plan and method are found in another 
chapter. 
2. TARDINESS 
This is a sore spot in many a teacher’s life. Pupils 
come straggling in all the way from nine o’clock till 
noon. No satisfactory results can be achieved under 
such conditions. Causes must’ be discovered and 
remedies applied. aS 
Causes of Tardiness—These are laziness, thought- 
lessness and bad judgment. ‘The first is the worst be- 
cause the hardest to cure. Fortunately it is not very 
prevalent, and the writer, at least, believes it is not in- 
herited, but may be acquired. Like everything else 
good or bad, it is catching. If parerits are afflicted with 
it, the children will catch it from them. 
How Laziness Should Be Treated—When laziness is 
plainly evident, as occasionally happens, it may be 
made the subject of a general talk in which the evil 
results and the sin of it are clearly pointed out. The 
writer recalls, when a boy, reading a sentence like this: 
“A lazy boy makes a lazy man just as surely as a 
crooked sapling makes a crooked tree.” It made a 
ep impression upon him and he has since used it to 
Dist. School—6 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
82 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
good effect upon school-children. It leaves so little 
room for doubt that it is really alarming. Still a 
crooked tree, if taken young enough, can be straight- 
ened; and likewise the lazy boy, if taken in time, can 
be cured. 
The general talk will make public sentiment and 
form a basis for personal application, kindly made in 
private, just where it is needed. The children may be 
told to coax their parents to call them earlier and let 
them have their breakfast in order to be at school on 
time. If all such means fail, severer measures may be 
resorted to. The writer once visited a.school of second- 
grade pupils in the early morning. While the opening 
exercises were in progress, two children entered and 
stopped just inside the door. Instantly the whole 
school broke into a song on the evils of tardiness, 
directing their words to the two culprits who stood 
looking very much embarrassed and ashamed. The 
teacher told us she was compelled to resort to this 
method and that it was working most effectively. 
The Evil of Thoughtlessness.—Some parents, although 
not lazy, are easy and indulgent and give but little 
attention as to whether or not the children meet their 
obligations. These are the thoughtless ones. While 
in a general way believing in an education, they do 
not appreciate the value of discipline nor realize how 
fatal to success is the habit of tardiness. Such people 
need to have their attention called to the fact that 
the most valuable part of an education is not the knowl-
-P-A-G-E-79
THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 83 
edge derived from books, but the forming of correct habits. 
Knowledge, although essential, is not sufficient. A 
man may have all the knowledge that a human being 
can acquire and yet be a failure. A well-ordered life 
is as essential as learning. 
The Consequences of Bad Judgment.—The third class 
are those who are afflicted with bad judgment, who 
imagine that an hour more or less off the school day 
is of trifling importance. They make the children do 
chores and run errands and keep them going “hot 
foot” until, when they reach school, their energy is 
spent and the best part of the day lost. They have no 
conception of the value of a child’s time other than 
for physical labor. ‘They do not stop to reflect that the 
foundation-laying period is the most precious part of 
life, because upon it the child’s future usefulness de- 
pends. Herein lies their error. The sad part of it is 
that the bulk of the loss falls upon the children, who 
can never recover lost time and lost opportunity, and 
upon the country, which can never receive the trained 
service it had provided for. 
The First Tardiness—The best time to cure an evil 
is at its beginning. When the first tardiness occurs, 
make much of it. It is an important matter and de- 
serves particular attention. With kindly solicitude in- 
quire very carefully into the cause. Express deep 
regret that it should have happened and pass righteous 
judgment on the cause, if in your opinion it was not 
sufficient. Make the offender feel that it is not a mat-
-P-A-G-E-80
84 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
ter of little or no importance, but that it is a serious 
thing. The schools of the country are of as great im- 
portance as the army and a greater safeguard to the 
nation. A soldier must report for duty unless unable 
to do so. A pupil is under as great obligation to the 
school. It is his duty to be there regularly and on time. 
If the first case is thus treated, it will make a deep 
impression upon the whole school and if followed up 
persistently for a few weeks the evil will be stamped 
out. 
3. IRREGULARITY OF ATTENDANCE 
The causes of tardiness are equally applicable to 
much of the irregularity of attendance, although at 
times there are good and sufficient reasons for deten- 
tion at home. Sickness, bad roads, inclement weather 
are some of them. No blame attaches to any one when 
such is the case, but still it must be remembered that 
the loss is just as great as when the reason is a trivial 
one. The difference is that the one deserves pity and 
the other blame. 
Those Unavoidably Detained.—The treatment of these 
unfortunates should be very different from that of the 
others who willfully remain away. All that is possible 
should be done to enable them to keep up their studies. 
The teacher should see to it that they have their books 
so they may study at home. The lessons of each day, 
with such instructions as are necessary, should be sent 
them. If he can call in the evening and render per-
-P-A-G-E-81
THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 85 
sonal aid, he will be doing a righteous act and his 
sacrifice is almost certain to be repaid with abundant 
gratitude. 
The First Absence.—This should be dealt with in sim- 
ilar fashion as the first tardiness. If, upon careful in- 
vestigation, the teacher finds it unavoidable, then he 
can only express his regret and assist the pupil in 
every way possible to recover the lost ground. But the 
school must be made to feel that the mark of his dis- 
approval is set upon any willful or unnecessary absence 
or tardiness. 
The Teacher’s Obligation.—There is one further sug- 
gestion. Teachers sometimes lay all blame for such 
delinquencies upon the parents and give themselves 
but little concern in regard to it. This is entirely 
wrong. ‘The teacher furnishes the only opportun- 
ity tnese children can have to correct deficiencies 
in the home government. If he fails to do his part, 
they may never have a chance to form right habits. 
On the other hand, if, without saying anything derog- 
atory to the parents, he will hold every one to a strict 
observance of his obligations, he will have a clear 
conscience and his pupils will “rise up and call him 
blessed.” 
4. THE SCHOOLHOUSE AND ITS SURROUNDINGS 
The Need of Daily Attention.—Part of our “previous 
preparations,” set forth in an early chapter, consisted 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
86 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
in putting the house and grounds in as good order 
and making everything look as shipshape as possible. 
Granting that this has been done, it must not be sup- 
posed that such a condition will remain long without 
attention. Something will need to be done every day 
to preserve order that has once been brought about. 
Bits of paper strewn about the grounds should be picked 
up; pupils will soon learn to do this if the teacher sets 
the example. All litter of every sort should be kept 
out of the way so that the playground may always be 
clean and neat. ; 
The Matter of Repairs.—If there is a broken window- 
pane, a door working badly, or a crippled desk, it ought 
to receive attention at once. If such a thing is allowed 
to go unnoticed, it teaches a powerful lesson in care- 
lessness that will be hard to eradicate. If, on the other 
hand, all repairs are attended to promptly, it will be 
an equally great lesson in the right direction. If a 
thing is needed that is beyond the teacher and pupils, 
the proper member of the board should be notified and 
urged to give it his immediate attention. 
Making Improvements.—In some cases the teacher 
may find it necessary to buy window curtains and 
perhaps even sash and glass, for there are districts 
so negligent that such articles can be obtained in no 
other way. If he must do this, it should be after he 
has asked the board to furnish them and been refused, 
and with the distinct understanding that the furnish- 
ings so purchased are his property and may be re-
-P-A-G-E-83
THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 87 
moved at the end of the term. Then, unless the dis- 
trict pay for them, they should be removed. They 
would be neither appreciated nor protected if be- 
stowed outright. An object lesson like this will do 
much toward bringing the people of the district to a 
sense of their duty. 
Some schoolhouses have no place except the floor 
for the dinner pails. Teacher and pupils should con- 
struct neat shelves for their accommodation. Hooks 
also should be provided for the hats and cloaks. Every 
such thing directed by the teacher and done by the 
pupils will furnish a better lesson and make a more 
lasting impression than almost any that can be found 
in the books. Every part of the room, walls as well 
as floor, should be kept clean. Decorations should be 
taken down as they grow old and dingy or as soon as 
they have served their purpose, and other designs put 
in their places. Bright touches of flowers and leaves 
from time to time add to the cheer of the school. 
Sanitary Conditions.—The surroundings of the school- 
house must be looked after. The well may need clean- 
ing. Impure water is a common source of sickness. 
Does surface water get into the well? If so, it must 
be prevented. The wall must be built up about the 
mouth of the well and all surface water drained away. 
The casing should be tight so that no frog or rat or 
rabbit can get in. It should be kept covered to prevent 
leaves or other floating matter from dropping in. 
Are there any stagnant pools near? If so, they are
-P-A-G-E-84
  88 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
a menace to health. They should be drained or filled 
up. Is there any decaying vegetation about? It is 
probably more dangerous than the stagnant pools; 
every bit of it should be gathered up and burned. 
The closets should be as far from the well as possi- 
ble, should have deep vaults and should be disinfected 
with ashes every day if convenient, but certainly once a 
week. Lime is the ideal disinfectant, but it is not 
always obtainable. Chloride of lime may be bought 
cheaply at drug stores. 
5. Goop-Witt Amonc PuPIts 
The successful disciplinarian is not content with obe- 
dience unless it is cheerfully and willingly rendered. 
A sullen and forced obedience is better than none, 
but it is far from satisfactory. Not only must good 
order be maintained, but the pupils must be kept in 
good humor. A happy frame of mind is essential 
to the best results. Pupils must be in good mind 
toward each other as well as toward the teacher. 
Strife, envy, jealousy, bitterness will almost if not quite 
ruin a school. Such feelings are not uncommon in 
country schools and always work to the detriment of 
all concerned. 
Equality of Treatment.—The best remedy is to treat 
all with the same unfailing respect and courtesy. 
The poor and the ill-clad may be as sensitive to kind- 
ness and to courtesy as any, but whether they are or
-P-A-G-E-85
THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 89 
not, they should receive only the best possible treat- 
ment. 
Exercises in Unison.—The next best way to produce 
harmony is to have all pupils engage in the same ex- 
ercise. At least twice a day they should join in a song. 
A few verses of Scripture may be read responsively with 
the teacher, followed by the Lord’s Prayer in concert. 
Some of the regular exercises of the school are better 
done in unison. Writing and drawing are examples. 
A story read or told by the teacher, one that appeals to 
all alike, of patriotism, brotherly kindness or sacrifice 
for others will do much toward uniting the school in 
good fellowship. A free and open discussion is often 
conducive to the general good feeling, but the teacher 
must guard against personal or acrimonious remarks. 
Adjusting Ill-feeling.—If there is any deep-seated ani- 
mosity that cannot be reached by such means as the 
above, then the teacher must take hold of it with the 
persons concerned and try to effect a reconciliation. 
Point out the folly of holding enmity and spite, and 
urge them to forget all past differences and be friends. 
Tt will not do for the teacher to form the habit of 
listening to tales of mistreatment told by either side; 
if he must listen, let it be without comment, and par- 
ticularly let him not be led into committing himself as 
to whether the alleged actions of any one were good or 
bad. He must stick to the point that no matter how 
disagreeable matters were in the past, they should now 
be forgotten and a new start made. Emphasize the
-P-A-G-E-86
go TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
fact that it is noble to forgive and that he who forgives 
most acts the noblest. 
If any teacher finds a feud or quarrel too deep and 
bitter for present reconciliation, that there are two 
such families or sets of families in his district and 
that the enmity of the parents has been handed down 
to the children on either side, then his best plan will 
be to ignore it so long as peace reigns. If strife shows 
signs of breaking out, he will have to take the matter 
firmly in hand. He should determine who are the 
leaders and without in the least taking sides, tell them 
that peace must be maintained. If they cannot be 
friends, they must treat each other with the respect 
due enemies in a place where fighting is out of the 
question. Let each side give half. the road and let 
there be no communication nor cause of offense. In 
this way strife may be avoided until the flame of hatred 
has a chance to die down. 
The extremes of happiness and misery are bound 
in this one matter of good or ill will. Where harmony 
reigns, there is delight; where discord prevails, there 
can be no pleasure. A happy, cheerful, forgiving dis- 
position on the part of the teacher will almost insure 
a pleasant school. His spirit of good will will be 
caught by all and its enjoyment once realized will be 
easily retained. If clouds appear, a funny story or a 
few jokes may dispel them. When the barometer of 
one’s feelings is low, there is nothing like laughter to 
shake it up.

6. THE CARE OF THE CHILDREN’S HEALTH—Gym- 
NASTICS 
The Teacher’s Responsibility—So important a matter 
as the health of the children must not be overlooked. 
A teacher is not expected to know as much, or to have 
as much skill as a physician, but he should know a 
few simple things about the care of the body and have 
skill enough to bind up a cut or treat a burn. Coughs’ 
and colds are common, but should not be neglected. 
They are usually caused by foul air, wet feet, or sitting 
in an exposed place after vigorous exercise. Children 
have but little judgment in avoiding colds. The 
teacher must shoulder the responsibility and use his 
wits and his authority for their protection. A wise 
teacher is as careful of his school as a mother hen 
of her brood. He must see that they are not unduly 
exposed to wet and cold on the playground, not al- 
lowed to sit in draughts or with wet stockings in the 
schoolroom, that they are well wrapped and have coats 
buttoned and shawls pinned before leaving the school- 
house when the weather is inclement. 
Contagious Diseases.—These also are to be guarded 
against. Ifa child shows signs of any of the common 
diseases, such as measles, whooping cough or mumps, 
he should be kept at home. If it is a false alarm, he 
may return as soon as it is so discovered. If it is a 
real case, all care should be taken to keep it from 
spreading and he should not return until a physician
-P-A-G-E-88
  g2 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
has passed upon it and has seen that needful precau- 
tions in the way of fumigating have been attended 
to. 
Of all the diseases inthis climate, typhoid fever is 
perhaps the most to be dreaded. Physicians are 
practically agreed that it comes from infected wells, 
or pools, or streams, and unless care is exercised, one 
person may take it from another. The teacher, be- 
cause of his position as instructor, may warn the pupils 
and through them the parents, to exercise the greatest 
care in regard to the drinking water. They should 
be instructed to keep surface water out of their wells, 
to see that cisterns are filtered and kept clean and not 
to use any stagnant water for drinking or cooking. If 
any one takes the disease, the best physician available 
should be employed and the persons in charge should 
know that the main thing in a typhoid fever case is 
careful nursing under the direction of the physician. 
How to Keep Well.—The best safeguard against mal- 
adies of every sort is to be in a good state of health 
continually. We can keep ourselves well and strong 
if we will only obey the laws of health. Here is where 
the teacher’s duty comes in. Health is of the first 
importance and whatever can be done to promote the 
health of the children in particular, and the neighbor- 
hood in general, is clearly his work. Whatever power 
the teacher has to better the conditions for healthful- 
ness, just to that extent is he responsible for the neigh- 
borhood. That this duty may be discharged, he should
-P-A-G-E-89
THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 93 
among other things drill the pupils thoroughly in the 
following simple rules of health: 
The First Rule’ of Health—The first rule is Krrp 
Crean. This means far more than keeping the body 
clean, though it certainly includes that. J¢ means clean 
surroundings, and that means clean rooms, clean beds, 
clean food, clean utensils of every sort, clean drinking 
water, clean yards and clean fields. It means that no 
vegetable or animal matter must be left to decay in 
heaps to poison the. air. Piles of weeds rotting, old 
boards decaying, old shoes or old clothes thrown out, 
all these and similar things are filth and should be 
burned. Dirt is ‘matter out of place,” and according 
to that definition everything that has not use or beauty, 
or that is not growing into use or beauty, is dirt. Clean- 
liness means that all vermin must be kept away. Rats, 
mice and every other kind of vermin create filth and 
carry contagion and are a menace to health. If we 
would be clean, we must be free from them. Manure 
heaps must not be allowed to gather near the house nor 
be left unprotected anywhere. Boards of health com- 
pel city-dwellers to keep their premises clean, but 
people living in the country are often careless and 
disease and death result. 
‘Filthy cellars are a common source of disease. 
Potatoes and other vegetables are allowed to rot in 
heaps, mold grows riotously in dark, damp corners 
and the air is polluted. Such places are the natural 
breeding grounds of disease germs. The only safe thing 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
94 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
is to keep out every vestige of dirt, to see that the cel- 
lar is thoroughly aired and as dry as any other part 
of the house. Unless it can be so, it is better not to 
have any cellar. 
Personal cleanliness is an art that is acquired by in- 
struction and practice, until it becomes a habit of life 
as necessary to comfort and happiness as food and air. 
It is not inherited. Children must be taught to keep 
clean hands and faces, to bathe regularly, to keep 
foreign substances from the finger nails, to remove 
particles of food from between the teeth, lest by de- 
caying there they rot the teeth, cause bad breath and 
endanger the health. The wise and tactful teacher 
will find plenty to do in inculcating this rule of cleanli- 
ness and seeing that it is observed by himself and 
pupils. 
The Second Rule of Health.—The second rule is, Eat 
Goop Foop at RecuLaR InTERVALS. Everybody 
knows the importance of this, that it is absolutely es- 
sential to life, but in respect to kinds and value of foods, 
and right and wrong ways of eating, few people give 
the subject the attention it deserves. Some of the ad- 
vanced schools of our country are devoting much time 
and thought to it, but the district teacher cannot and 
need not undertake anything very difficult. He can 
and should, however, call attention to some of the com- 
mon faults and give useful instruction in regard to 
eating. 
First, the teacher may have some discussion on the
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 95 
kinds of food. Let the main divisions be brought out. 
It will be seen that there are four: grains, meats, fruits 
and vegetables. Each one of these main divisions may 
be discussed separately. ‘The principal grains are 
wheat, corn, rye, oats, barley and rice. Much inter- 
esting information may be brought out concerning 
these, as to where they grow most abundantly, where 
each is the chief food, their desirability, cost and so 
on. The form in which these grains should be eaten 
may furnish a topic for a lesson. This will lead to the 
ways of cooking, such as boiling, baking and frying. 
At the close of the discussion, sum up and emphasize 
the principal thoughts that have been brought out 
something as follows: 
(a) All the grains above named are excellent food 
because they contain in large quantities the properties 
required for the nourishment of the body. 
(2) Some grow best in certain parts of the world, 
others in other parts. Where any one grows in great 
abundance, it forms the chief grain food of the people 
in that section. The liking for one or another depends 
upon one’s bringing up, that is, upon usage. 
(3) Before any of these grains are eaten, they should 
be properly prepared and cooked, so as to retain their 
nourishing qualities. 
(4) They should not form one’s sole diet, because 
they do not contain all the kinds of food that the body 
requires. 
Meats, fruits and vegetables may each be treated 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
96 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
in the same manner. -To these four principal kinds of 
food there may be added the condiments, such as salt, 
pepper and spices; also drinks, such as coffee and tea. 
Second, having given useful instruction in regard to 
the kinds of food, i# will now be in order to consider its 
preparation and the manner of serving it. It will be 
wisest to have this instruction take the form of dis- 
cussion, and by encouragement and skillful questioning 
have the important things said by the pupils rather 
than by the teacher. Then, if some things touch the 
home life, it will not be resented to the injury of the 
teacher’s influence. 
Third, we may take up the times and ways oj eating 
and the amount required jor different people at different 
times. As to times of eating, Nature says eat when 
you are hungry, but here we cannot always obey 
Nature. Civilization demands that meals be served 
at regular times and our appetites must accommodate 
themselves to the custom. Still some consideration 
must be given to Nature, especially in the case of 
growing children. They may need food oftener than 
grown people and so may eat some light lunch at proper 
intervals between meals. 
As to the ways of eating, we must conform to the 
customs of society. If we do not, we shall be ac- 
counted queer or perhaps worse. If the custom of 
society is to eat with a fork, and drink from a spoon 
or from a cup rather than from a saucer, it is better 
to yield to these demands than to be the occasion of
-P-A-G-E-93
THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 97 
notice and remark and the embarrassment of our 
friends. Real politeness, however, does not depend 
upon forms of etiquette. Politeness is of the heart and 
mind and may have the true ring and yet be ignorant 
of outward forms. Real politeness is to be considerate 
of others. Hence we must avoid giving offense by 
eating noisily with our lips, or reaching across the table 
or talking more than our share. Careful observation of 
polite people will soon teach us the proper forms. 
The Third Rule of Health.—Let the third rule be, 
BREATHE Pure Arr. Almost enough was said on this 
subject under the topic of cleanliness, where instruc- 
tion was given concerning the wisdom of keeping our 
surroundings free from impure and noxious gases that 
arise from stagnant pools or decaying matter. There 
remain two things worthy of notice, namely, school- 
rooms, churches, etc., and sleeping rooms. 
Teachers should see to it that their. schoolrooms are 
well ventilated. The air in a schoolroom is never pure 
enough, unless it is as pure as the air outdoors. That 
is the last measure of purity and is the only one we 
should accept. 
Sleeping rooms are often poorly ventilated and from 
this cause arise coughs, colds, catarrh, weak lungs, 
impure blood, pale faces, consumption and death. 
Here again the only test is the outdoor air. If, upon 
going out of a sleeping room in the morning and re- 
entering it, there is a stifling sensation or unpleasant 
odor, it is the signal of danger. 
Dist. School—7
-P-A-G-E-94
  98 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Some of our large cities now have consumption 
hospitals where the patients are made to live in the 
open air day and night, whether hot or cold. By this 
treatment victims who are well along with the disease 
recover. It is known as the fresh air cure, medicines 
having nothing to do with it. Physicians say it is im- 
possible to take consumption in pure air. 
It is agreed also that tuberculosis (consumption) is 
not inherited, but is catching. A weak body, and low 
vitality may be inherited. Weak and sickly parents 
produce weak and sickly children. Such have feeble 
powers of resistance and so contract the first disease 
to which they are exposed. This happens to be con- 
sumption as often as any other, and thus it was sup- 
posed that the disease was inherited. A vigorous, out- 
door life with an abundance of good food and sunshine 
is the only safeguard. 
One consumptive patient poorly cared for may infect 
a whole family or even a whole neighborhood. The 
person afflicted perhaps expectorates anywhere, the ex- 
pectoration dries up and leaves the germs of the disease 
to float in the air or to be washed into the streams to 
pollute wells and cisterns. The expectoration of a 
sick person should be upon cloths or other matter that 
may be burned up as fast as it accumulates. All ex- 
cretions that come from the body of a diseased person 
should be either burned or buried. By so doing the air 
is kept pure and life is protected. 
Churches that are kept tightly closed from week to  
-P-A-G-E-95
THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 99 
week are dangerous. Darkness and foul air afford the 
best breeding places for diseases. Sunshine and pure 
air are the foes of disease. A church should be opened 
and thoroughly ventilated immediately after each serv- 
ice. It should have some means of ventilation during 
service. 
Spitting on church or schoolhouse floors is an abomi- 
nable practice and ought to be vigorously condemned 
at every opportunity. Many courthouses also aie 
hideous examples of this vicious practice. Matting is 
put upon the floor and allowed to remain there for 
years without being cleaned. It is spit upon and 
trampled upon until it becomes one mass of filth, an 
insult to decency and a menace to health. It may not 
be wise for the teacher to take a leading part outside 
of his own domain even in a matter so vital to the 
community, but he can bring it to the attention of some 
leading person who will make it a business to see that 
something is done. 
The Fourth Rule of Health_—The fourth rule is Take 
Prienty or Exercise. This leads to the second part 
of our general topic—gymmnastics. There is a prevail- 
ing belief that country boys do not need calisthenic 
drills, for the reason that they get plenty of exercise 
in doing chores and farm work and in walking to and 
from school. It is true that they are likely to get 
plenty of that kind of exercise, perhaps too much. 
Nevertheless they need the calisthenics. Farmers’ boys 
are often stiff and ungainly from too much toil and not 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  100 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
enough play. They are stoop-shouldered and rheu- 
matic and have the form of age rather than the spring 
and sprightliness of youth. They need a@ series of 
exercises that will bring unused muscles into play, that 
will straighten their shoulders, round out their bodies 
and make them free and easy in their movements. 
Teachers in city schools have their calisthenic ex- 
ercises as regularly as they have their classes in read- 
ing and numbers, but country teachers, from lack of 
knowledge or training, or because they consider it un- 
necessary, usually neglect such exercises. There is no 
doubt but that they are just as valuable in country as 
in city schools. If country boys and girls get too much 
work, their city cousins get too much play. The 
gymnastics come in as an evener in either case. It is. 
work to city children and play to country children. 
General Directions for Calisthenic Drills.—Extended 
directions cannot be given in a work like this. Only a 
few simple exercises are suggested as a beginning. 
Any teacher who is interested may for a few cents buy 
a book of calisthenics giving explicit directions for a 
great number and variety of exercises. Instructions 
are frequently found also in teacher’s journals. 
After pupils have been studying for an hour or more, 
give the signal for attention. Books in order; every- 
body in position, sitting straight, heads érect, shoulders 
back. The teacher counts one, all turn into the aisles; 
two, they stand; three, they face the front, arm’s 
length apart, heels together, toes apart, shoulders
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 103 
Breathing Exercises.—These should always accompany 
the calisthenic drills. At the beginning, when all 
are in position, give the signal to inhale, raising the 
arms outward slowly until on a level with the shoulders; 
take just as much air as possible into the lungs; then, 
exhaling, lower the arms slowly until the lungs are as 
empty as possible. Repeat the process several times. 
There is no danger of any child hurting himself by 
inhaling or exhaling to his full capacity. 
The Use of Apparatus.—Many schools are provided 
with costly apparatus, such as Indian clubs, dumb- 
bells, wands and the like. These things are desirable 
because they add interest, but they are not at all nec- 
essary. About as good results can be obtained without 
as with them. It all depends upon the enthusiasm and 
determination of the teacher. 
7. RHETORICAL EXERCISES 
Reader, does the idea of rhetoricals dampen your 
ardor? Does it present to yout mental vision the 
picture of a teacher with a scowling and determined 
face and pupils in various stages of distress from tears 
to open rebellion? In many cases where rhetoricals- 
are undertaken, such a picture would not be over- 
drawn. A large percentage of teachers make no effort 
to have such exercises, considering the trouble greater 
than the value received. Others relieve their con- 
sciences by having little pieces recited on Friday after- 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  104. TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
noons and calling them rhetoricals. A few there are 
who take the plan up with enthusiasm and carry it 
through to the pleasure and profit of all concerned. 
What is the trouble on the one hand and the secret of 
success on the other? 
How to Begin.—The trouble lies frequently in a wrong 
beginning. Pupils without a particle of preparation 
or training are told to write a composition. The very 
word is like a thunderstroke to them. They have no 
idea what is wanted and are helplessly at sea. They 
cannot think of anything to write about and can see 
no sense in it anyway. 
The fact is, the teacher who starts in such a way 
is making a bad beginning. He is trying to drive the 
wedge from the wrong end. Children will take great 
delight in writing compositions if they are started prop- 
erly. ‘They must begin at the beginning, as they would 
with arithmetic or grammar, and make progress by 
easy stages. Little ones should be taught to make 
single sentences about familiar objects and then to 
write these sentences. This is composition work. It 
should be a daily exercise through the first years of 
school life, until enough skill has been acquired so 
that the child can express his thoughts as easily in 
writing as in speaking. When this stage has been 
reached, he may have it less frequently though not 
less regularly nor less certainly. 
Teaching More Advanced Pupils How to Write.—If 
children well along in other matters have not been
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 105 
taught to express their thoughts in writing, no time 
should be lost until they have learned it. No part of 
their education will be more valuable. Like the little 
ones they must begin at the beginning. Suppose a 
boy ten or twelve years old is bright enough in read- 
ing, spelling and arithmetic, but knows nothing about 
writing his own thoughts. His first lesson may be 
something like this: You say to him, “ Jack, what do 
you know about pocket-knives?” Jack replies, ‘O, 
I know they are a mighty good thing to have. If you 
have a pocket-knife, you can peel a turnip or cut a 
watermelon or make things.” ‘Now write it out, 
please.”” Perhaps, with some demurring, Jack writes 
it out. You read it over and say, ‘That is a very 
good composition.” Jack says, ‘“‘Why, teacher, that’s 
no composition, that’s nothing!” You say, “Well, 
write some more to it.”” 
“But I do not know any more to write.” 
‘Are all knives alike ?” you ask. 
“No, some are large and some are small. Some 
have only one blade while others have three or four. 
Some are cheap and of poor quality, while others cost 
considerable and are better.” 
“Well, Jack, you appear to be well posted about 
knives. Please add that to what you have written.” 
With less reluctance than before, he proceeds to 
write it out. When it is done, you again approve it 
and tell him if he will practice a little while every day, 
he will by and by be able to write anything he wishes.
-P-A-G-E-100
106 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Jack feels proud to think he has done something 
new that meets the approval of his teacher, and will 
be glad to exercise his newly-discovered powers again. 
Henceforth all he needs is intelligent direction with 
the occasional stimulus of praise or blame for good or 
bad efforts. 
Beginners must always be told what to write about 
with enough directions to keep them from being 
discouraged. 
The older pupils, from the fourth reader up, may 
have rhetoricals once a fortnight, reading their com- 
positions before the school. Each production should 
be read by the teacher, the mistakes marked and the 
whole copied neatly, with the mistakes corrected, before 
it is allowed to be read in public. The efforts of be- 
ginners should not be criticised at all. A child may 
stagger all he pleases while he is learning to walk. 
Selection of Subjects.—The teacher should be ready 
to suggest subjects, avoiding such abstract themes as 
“Honesty is the Best Policy,’ ‘‘The Importance of 
Habit,” and ‘Virtue is its Own Reward.” The object 
zs not to bring forth mature wisdom on deep subjects, 
but to teach children to think about the things around 
them and to express their thoughts in writing. ‘They 
should be allowed to write about the things that are 
interesting to them, that touch their everyday life, 
such as, ‘““How Mother Gets Dinner,” or, ‘How 
Father Shears the Sheep,” and similar topics, includ- 
ing all the common occupations about the house and
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE SCHOOL IN PROGRESS 107 
farm. They may write about their own doings and the 
things that interest them. 
At an early stage they may write imaginary com- 
positions about animals, travels, or what they will do 
when they are grown. They must be made to under- 
stand clearly the difference between imagination and 
reality. Such work as the above they will thoroughly 
enjoy and it will result greatly to their advantage.

  CHAPTER V 
KEEPING UP THE INTEREST 
1. HELPFUL PROPS AND SPURS 
The Main Prop.—It ought to be engraved somewhere, 
above his desk, over his door, on the ceiling over his bed, 
anywhere, everywhere, so he could not fail to see it, 
As THE TEACHER Is, so Witt THE ScHoot Br. So 
long as the zeal of the teacher does not flag, the pupils 
are not likely to lose interest. But let the spirit of the 
teacher droop for an instant, and the whole school 
catches it. If he stretches, the school yawns. It is not 
so much how to keep the school interested, as how to 
keep one’s own interest from waning. 
We all need spurring up occasionally. No matter 
how mettlesome our steed is, if we keep him going 
at a good strong gait for many days, he will finally be- 
gin to lag and will have to be touched up. Who shall 
spur the district teacher when he begins to lag? There 
is no principal to keep an eye on him, as in the case of 
the city teacher. The County Superintendent with his 
one visit a year is too remote; we can take many a nap 
without his catching us. The school directors pay little 
if any attention, and would hardly dare prod us if they 
108
-P-A-G-E-103
  KEEPING UP THE INTEREST 10g 
knew we needed it. Our patrons will not spur us. Evi- 
dently we must urge ourselves on. Whatever spurring 
we get must be self-inflicted. The attention is called to 
a list of spurs. 
Spur One.—Count the days. The Psalmist said, ‘So 
teach us to number our days that we may apply our 
hearts unto wisdom.’ At the beginning of the term, 
we make our plans as large as possible and as the days 
go by we shall find the time all too short to accom- 
plish what we desire. Also, as we become acquainted 
with our pupils, we discover their needs and add to 
our original plans. We need now every single day, used 
to the utmost, in order to do the work that is pressing 
to be done. If our term is six months, we have one 
hundred and twenty days. As one after another slips 
away, we should count jealously those that remain and 
part with each one as reluctantly as a miser parts from 
his dollars. 
Spur Two.—Measure what remains by what has been 
done. In reviewing the past, we can see how many 
difficulties were encountered that had not been foreseen. 
Various unexpected hindrances impeded our progress. 
We may count upon it that such will be-the case to the 
end. A certain man was adjudged insane because he 
supposed he could build a house for what the contrac- 
tors told him it would cost. So we must measure the 
future, not by what we can see, but by the experiences 
of the past. Doing this, we shall readily conclude that 
we have no time to waste.
-P-A-G-E-104
  IIo TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Spur Three.—For the sake of my pupils I must not 
relax my vigilance. They must take me as their pat- 
tern. Iam their example. I cannot expect them to do 
more than they see me doing. If I urge them to be 
diligent, I must be diligent. If I would have them in- 
crease their interest, I must not lose mine. This should 
be a very keen and effective spur. 
Spur Four.—Duty to others. I owe it to my parents 
who love me, to my teachers who instructed me, to 
those who recommended me, to the directors who em- 
ployed me, tomy patrons who have intrusted their 
children to my care, to my country and to my Maker to 
put forth my best efforts, to discharge my duties faith- 
fully from the first day to the last. Nothing less than 
whole-hearted service will relieve me of my obligations 
to all these. 
Spur Five——Duty to self. Lastly, I cannot afford to 
fall into loose ways for the sake of ease, or relief from 
daily burdens. If I allow myself to become careless, 
I will greatly injure my chances of success. Work 
slighted one day will be more easily slighted the next, 
and soon the habit will be formed and my usefulness 
will be practically ruined. Neither is it sufficient that 
I should keep from slipping back, or that I should 
merely hold my own. I must provide opportunities 
for self growth and not fail to use them. 
By such spurs as these, the teacher must keep himself 
up to his best efforts; without them, he will never reach 
the goal of his ambitions.

2. KEEPING A BRAVE FRONT 
It is never wise to reveal discouragement or disap- 
pointment. Many a general has saved himself from a 
crushing defeat by a good showing in front. Disap- 
pointments and discouragements are certain to come, 
but we need not brood over them nor talk about them. 
Some teachers lie awake nights worrying over their 
difficulties. It does no good whatever, but much harm, 
because it robs us of greatly needed rest and so unfits 
us for the next day’s duties. . 
Reviewing the Day’s Work.—A better plan than wor- 
rying, is, after the work of the day is over, to review 
it carefully, passing honest judgment upon every act 
and taking the full share of blame where things went 
wrong. We should not hesitate to acknowledge to our- 
selves our mistakes and shoulder whatever blame at- 
taches to them. If we do not thus reflect upon our 
experiences and deal honestly with ourselves, we shall 
not profit by them. If there are any difficult matters 
pending, we should think them over carefully and de- 
cide upon a course of action. Having done this, we 
may dismiss the whole matter and sleep soundly. This 
will give us new courage and new strength to go for- 
ward next day. 
Avoid Complaint and Gossip.—Ordinarily, when some 
one asks us how we are getting on, he does not expect 
us to pour a tale of woe into his ears. His question was 
a mere common-place greeting, like “How-do-you-do? ”
-P-A-G-E-106
  Ii2 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
and requires only such an answer as “Very well,” or 
“‘So-so.”? People are always ready to listen to some- 
thing bright and cheering, but they do not care to hear 
wails and complaints. As the old saying is, they have 
troubles enough of their own. Particularly must we not 
complain of any of our patrons to some gossipy lis- 
tener, even though we may think the former have 
treated us badly. If there is any such difference, we 
should go to the offenders themselves and if possible 
straighten it out. 
If we should not reveal our troubles to the world, it 
is equally important that we should not reveal them 
to the school. Instead of arousing sympathy, as for 
one in distress, it is likely to bring contempt for sup- 
posed weakness. Clear grit is much more effective than 
tears. 
Extreme Cases of Discipline.—Neither will it pay, if we 
have rebellious or unruly pupils, to discuss them with 
the neighbors. If we need advice, we should not hesi- 
tate to ask it of some wise person who has had more 
experience than we, and who will not take advantage 
of our confidence to do us hurt. Or if matters are un- 
endurable, we may go to the directors and lay our trou- 
bles before them. It is their duty to take such action 
as may be necessary for the protection of the teacher 
and of the school. 
While extreme cases of discipline that require the 
assistance of the Board are not common, they do some- 
times happen and are most likely to occur to young
-P-A-G-E-107
  KEEPING UP THE INTEREST II3 
teachers. To them the above advice will be valu- 
able. 
Let Your Work Speak.—Finally, a teacher’s own esti- 
mate of his work will be taken largely by others. If he 
counts himself a failure, he will be so considered. If 
he looks upon his work as a success, most people are 
willing to let it go at that. Two things he should avoid, 
boasting of his achievements or deprecating his feeble ef- 
forts. Do your best, keep a brave heart and let your 
work speak for itself. 
3. ENcouracinc THosE WuHo NeEep It 
The Word That Inspires.—It is well to keep an eye out 
for any depression of spirits among the pupils. Every 
one has his trials and difficulties. Some are much more 
easily discouraged than others. They should have just 
the word that they need, whether it be praise or blame 
or sympathy. Some have to struggle very hard to keep 
pace with their classmates. A smile, a nod, or a word 
now and then will keep their courage to the sticking 
-spoint. Notice every good effort and reward it with 
some kind of recognition. The best teachers are those 
who inspire their pupils to heroic efforts. Since they 
cannot measure their own success, the teacher must 
point it out to them. Show them some of the difficult 
things they have mastered, knotty problems in arith- 
metic, knowledge acquired in geography, encouraging 
lessons in reading. The troubles ahead are no more

  {14 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
formidable than those that have been met and con- 
quered. Let the motto be: Do one thing at a time and 
do it well. : 
Individual Attention.—There are students who have 
a dread of certain branches, as grammar, arithmetic or 
spelling. These are often bright in most of their 
studies, keeping well to the head of the class, and it 
frets and chafes them to be worsted in some one branch. 
For such, the greatest care is necessary. They must 
have special attention in the difficult study. The de- 
fection is due either to a bad start or to a lack of men- 
tal development in this one particular. In either case 
a special effort is needed to overcome the difficulty. It 
is not wise to leave any part uncultivated. 
Again, there are gentle, timid souls who quail before 
their more rough-and-ready classmates. They would 
almost die of fright were it not for the sympathy and 
support of the teacher. A brusque or scolding remark 
does no good, but tends to put them back. They need 
to be encouraged to speak, and commended for every 
effort until they gain confidence in themselves. If they 
can be made to feel that they are really succeeding, they 
will gain in assurance and strength and be much happier. 
For each class and for every individual the teacher 
should appoint himself a lookout commitiee. He should 
study the minds and dispositions of all. There is al- 
ways some one requiring special attention. Like a 
skillful physician, he should know how to diagnose 
each case and be able to render such aid as is needed.

4. Improvinc Your TEACHING 
Keep Out of Ruts.—It is a large part of every teach- 
er’s duty to look to his own growth. This is particu- 
larly true of beginners. It is very easy to get into ruts 
and go on about the same day after day, but the habit 
is a deadly one and must be fought with vigor. Without 
discouragement or self-abasement, the young teacher 
should sharply criticise his every act. He should keep 
constantly in mind that his teaching could be and ought 
to be improved. He should study new ways of pre- 
senting knowledge so as to make it more attractive, new 
ways of arousing interest and keeping the pupils in 
good heart. 
A new way is better than the old if it takes the teacher 
out of arut. It is well to try new methods occasion- 
ally for the sake of being able to do so. Many teachers 
have followed so long the paths their fathers trod, that 
it is almost impossible for them to venture upon un- 
tried ways. Every one should blaze some new path, 
should venture into fields that, so far as he knows, 
have never been explored. He should feel the exhila- 
ration of discovery, the satisfaction of having done 
something that his predecessors never did. It will add 
strength to his character and interest to his work. 
Caution and Enthusiasm.—This does not mean that 
we should be running after every new fad that comes 
along. There are many enthusiasts, who, for the sake 
of notoriety or gain, are urging upon others their latest  
-P-A-G-E-110
  116 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
device or method. It is not wise to bite too quickly at 
these baits. If a new thing commends itself and is 
indorsed by trustworthy people, and is not too costly, 
we need not hesitate to give it a trial. But too many so 
called time-savers are merely money-making devices of 
little real value, and it is usually better to wait and let 
time determine their true standing. A rule long ago 
laid down by a famous rhetorician will apply in such 
cases: 
“Be not the first by which the new is tried, 
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.” 
Necessity of Daily Study.—In striving to improve our — 
teaching, we must not forget that daily study is a ne- 
cessity to growth. No brilliancy of mind, nor device, 
nor even experience can take the place of it. Knowl- 
edge to be interesting, must be fresh. No matter how 
often we have taught a subject, unless we study it 
anew each time, we shall fail of the best results. The 
mind, like the body, cannot feed upon itself and grow. 
It must have new material daily. Realizing this, we 
should set apart some hours every day to the study 
of our lessons, both as to the matter of them and the 
way in which they should be presented. The young 
teacher who does this conscientiously, will find it the 
most delightful period of the day. It is the time for 
adding to and enriching his stores of learning, and he 
will have more to give and will give it better, if he will 
keep this study period sacred. 
Acquiring Pedagogical Helps. —It will not be aulticten
-P-A-G-E-111
  KEEPING UP THE INTEREST 117 
to study the text-books and ways of presenting the 
lessons. ‘The teacher must be provided with the best 
literature the profession affords. On his study table 
should be the latest numbers of two or three of the 
leading educational journals, and these should be care- 
fully read and digested as soon as possible after they 
arrive. He should also have a few good works on 
pedagogy. To acquire these, he may write to school- 
book publishing companies, asking them for their best 
work on teaching. Nearly every publishing company 
has at least one excellent work of this class. Such 
helps should be carefully read, with special attention 
given to the parts that seem particularly applicable. 
In this way will be gleaned many ideas that will make 
the work of teaching more interesting and far more 
helpful to the pupils, and will keep the teacher growing. 
Visiting Other Schools.—After teaching a month or six 
weeks, it is a good plan to take a day off and visit some 
other school. In doing this, select the best teacher of 
your acquaintance within reach. Spend the entire day 
in the schoolroom, taking note of everything that hap- 
pens. Observe very carefully ways or methods that 
differ from your own and their results. At inter- 
missions, talk frankly with the teacher concerning his 
methods, being careful to commend the best things and 
to offer no unfavorable criticism of anything. If asked, 
give your own methods without any show of pride or 
boasting. 
A general plan for visiting would be greatly produc-
-P-A-G-E-112
  118 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
tive of good. If every teacher were allowed two or 
three days in the school year for that purpose, it would. 
stimulate to greater effort, unify the work and afford 
each one a means for measuring his success with his 
coworkers. But until such provision is made by the 
state legislature, it will pay every teacher to take the 
time at his own expense. 
Attending Teachers’ Associations—In many places pro- 
vision has been made for attending teachers’ associa- 
tions. The progressive teacher will lay much store by 
this and not permit anything to keep him away. Here 
he comes in contact with his fellows, and hears the 
best thoughts of the foremost teachers on vital topics. 
If he goes in the right spirit, he cannot fail to gain 
much that will be helpful. To obtain the best re- 
sults, he should give as well as receive. By enter- 
ing into the discussions, he will add his part to the in- 
terest of the meeting and discover the strength or 
weakness of his ideas. Not only should a teacher at- 
tend every association in his county, but he should by 
all means attend the state association. Here he sees 
and hears the ablest educators of the state, and may 
enrich his mind with the best and freshest thoughts of 
the times. 
Keeping a Scrapbook.—Finally, the teacher should 
keep a scrapbook, one for each year. Here, under 
proper headings, should be gathered clippings from the 
educational journals on reading, drawing, history, etc., 
items of interest from newspapers and magazines, dec-
-P-A-G-E-113
KEEPING UP THE INTEREST I19Q 
lamations, gems of poetry, stories and the like. It may 
contain also pen-notes of schools visited, associations 
‘attended or lectures heard. Such a scrapbook becomes 
a rich storehouse for Friday afternoons and for special 
days and occasions. 
A Final Word on Self-Improvement.—The above are 
the common and ordinary means for self-improvement. 
If used diligently, they are certain to produce satisfac- 
tory results. If omitted, the opposite is just as certain,— 
professional stagnation, decay and death. Some teach- 
ers will say that they cannot afford all these things,— 
journals, magazines, books and teachers’ associations. 
The truth is, no one can afford to go without them. 
Money invested in self-improvement will be returned 
many fold. The teacher who will not invest in any of 
these things, will grow rusty and careless, be looked 
upon as a back number and instead of being sought for 
and promoted, will be seeking for the poorest positions 
and will finally lose out altogether. Self-improvement 
is necessary for self-protection. 
5. RESERVE FORCES 
The wise general does not keep all his forces actively 
engaged. He has some in reserve against the time 
of need. In some desperate situation, this strong re- 
serve force, which the enemy knows nothing about, 
will save him from defeat. Likewise, the teacher who 
is looking out against the day of trouble has his reserve
-P-A-G-E-114
  120 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
forces. When the school has been going on for some 
weeks and the dull grind of monotony begins to settle 
down, when the little faces grow long and sighs of dis- 
couragement appear, a part of the extra forces may be 
brought into play. The following list is offered as hav- 
ing done valiant duty on many a hard fought field. 
A New Song.—On a dull afternoon, when the energy 
is at a low ebb, have a new song ready, a school song; 
if possible, one with action in it. Write the verses on 
the blackboard one at a time until all are learned. See 
that it is sung with vim and good will. If it is a march- 
ing song, all the better. Get some boy who is skillful 
with the mouth organ to play an accompaniment, and 
have all the school march around the room. Five or 
six minutes of this will take away the dullness, and 
work may be resumed to much greater profit. 
New Ways of Hearing the Lessons.—There are a dozen 
ways of hearing a spelling class recite. Hold back your 
latest invention until the interest lags, then spring it. 
Drawing offers a fine field for interesting novelties. A 
new object to draw, with interesting details of shading 
and measurements, cannot fail to charm away lethargy. 
The geography is a storehouse of good things. Make 
a map, showing the various products of the United 
States with pictures or objects. In grazing countries 
cut out small pictures of cattle, horses and sheep and 
pin on to the map. To show the corn belt, grains of 
corn may be pasted on, white in the south, yellow in the 
north; wheat grains to show the wheat states, bits of
-P-A-G-E-115
  KEEPING UP THE INTEREST [21 
cotton to show where that is raised, wood for timber and 
soon. This plan is an excellent thing in itself, but may 
well be kept until it is needed to revive interest. 
A Ciphering Match.—This has often helped to revive 
flagging energies. The pupils choose sides as in a spell- 
ing match. The one last chosen goes to the board and 
selects an opponent from the opposite side. The latter 
chooses the kind of work, as adding, subtracting or 
multiplying. When both are ready, the teacher gives 
a problem and they go at it with might and main. The 
figures fairly fly. The first one through reads his an- 
swer. If it is right, he has won. ‘The loser goes to his 
seat; the winner selects his successor, who again chooses 
the kind of work, and so the game goes on until one side 
or the other is vanquished. There is plenty of excite- 
ment in it and it stimulates to rapidity and accuracy. 
Bird Day.—In some parts of the country, a day has 
been set apart for the study of birds and is called “Bird 
Day.” It is rather the culmination of a series of studies 
on birds. Country children have a fine opportunity 
for this study and ought to know much more about it 
than they ordinarily do. They may first roughly clas- 
sify all as song birds, useful birds and harmful birds. 
These branches may be studied separately, comparing 
different kinds of one class, as the robin and the. wren. 
“Bird Day” gathers together the knowledge acquired 
in several weeks or months and makes as great a show- 
ing as possible. The children have learned to draw 
pictures of the various kinds of birds they have studied, 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  122 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
to describe their appearance and habits, to imitate or 
describe their note or song, to tell where and how they 
build their nests, number of eggs, appearance of young 
ones and so on. A collection of nests may be made, 
being careful to take only those that have been aban- 
doned. The literary part of the program may con- 
sist of songs, poems, stories and written descriptions of 
birds. Bird games may be played and the small chil- 
dren may be taught to act birds in such ways as hop- 
ping and flying. Both the preparation and the day it- 
self will bring out much that is interesting and useful. 
History Day.—This is another equally profitable and 
perhaps more entertaining occasion. It has an advan- 
tage over ‘“‘Bird Day” in that all the people of the dis- 
trict may take part. Like the other, it requires con- 
siderable preparation on the part of teacher and pupils. 
It need not be confined to the history class—all may have 
some part. The children should be made familiar with 
a considerable number of historical events, so that they 
can tell about them readily in their own words. They 
should collect pictures of important people, places and 
things. They should make drawings of such objects 
as Lincoln’s birthplace, the cabin where Betsy Ross 
made the flag, the Bunker Hill Monument, the Liberty 
Bell, etc. All the relics of the neighborhood may be 
borrowed for the occasion and be so placed as to make 
the best display. 
New Games—Field Day.—The playground must not 
be despised nor neglected. It may be made a power-
-P-A-G-E-117
  KEEPING UP THE INTEREST 123 
ful factor in keeping up the interest in the school. High 
schools and colleges all over the land make a great deal 
of athletics, keeping in school by means of their in- 
terest in games, hundreds of young men who could not 
otherwise be induced to remain. Some condemn the 
match games of football, baseball and rowing, because 
of the loss of time and other attendant evils, but all are 
in favor of good, healthy, clean athletics. All children 
and most grown people like to play, and it is right that 
they should indulge their liking. It is a part of their de- 
velopment. If properly directed, it may be an impor- 
tant factor in their education. 
When the interest in play is on the wane and the old 
gamés become tiresome, have a new one ready to pro- 
pose. Enter into it with zest yourself, and see if it will 
not bring new life into the school. Outdoor games are 
the best, but there should be a few indoor ones for 
‘ bad weather. Conundrums, riddles, charades are all 
good if rightly conducted. Much depends upon the 
way the teacher does his part. He should never play 
in a half-hearted manner. All look to the teacher as 
the leading spirit, and any signs of being bored will be 
catching and the game will be spoiled. 
Some of the larger district schools might well have a 
“Field Day.” This would give every boy a chance to 
take part and to choose the particular sport in which 
he excels. Each class should have its events, such as 
running, jumping, throwing the hammer and putting 
the shot. Running may consist of sixty and one hun- 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  124 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
dred yard dashes. Young boys should not attempt long 
runs. Jumping may consist of several varieties, as 
running hop-step-and-jump, standing hop-step-and- 
jump, running broad jump, standing broad jump, and 
running and standing high jump. ‘The only prizes 
that need be given are ribbons that indicate first and 
second place; a record should be kept from year to 
year. Where this could be worked successfully, it 
would be a powerful incentive to keep the larger boys 
in school, and it is a perfectly justifiable method to 
use. 
Mental Exercise—It must not be forgotten that men- 
tal exercise when rightly adapted to the pupils, is as 
fascinating as physical. When mind and body are in 
good condition, there is nothing more exhilarating than 
study, provided it is fresh and suited to the pupils’ 
development and needs. ‘They should be constantly 
moving into new work, using the old in acquiring it. 
If it is done vigorously and thoroughly, but little re- 
view, that is, going over the same ground again, will be 
needed. 
When, in pursuit of the new, it is discovered that 
certain points have not been thoroughly learned, take 
up those particular parts and dwell upon them until 
they are understood. It does not pay to go over old 
straw so long as there is more wheat in front of you 
than you can ever get threshed, but it does pay to do 
it thoroughly as you go. Study hard until the mind is 
weary, then play or rest.

6. ScHOOL VISITORS 
Give Special Invitations.—There is no doubt but that 
the presence of a visitor, who is a friend of the school, 
is a stimulus to good work. It is not necessary to wait 
until some one happens to come; neither will it answer 
to extend a general invitation, such as, ‘‘Come and see 
us some time.’’? Think over your patrons and friends 
and make a list of those who would be an advantage to 
the school. Call on number one and ask him or her 
to come at an appointed time. The date having been 
agreed to, send a reminder the day before. It is 
proper to suggest to the visitor the particular points 
you would like to have noticed in which the pupils 
need encouragement, and to ask for private suggestions 
to yourself. 
Profit by Experience.—When the visit is over, reflect 
. upon its success or failure. If it was not what you 
hoped, discover the cause and try again. Decide what 
course to follow with number two and have him call 
a week or so later, and thus continue through the list. 
You will find it will materially benefit the school. All 
patrons should be cordially invited to drop in at any 
time and should be made welcome and receive attention 
when they come. Those who cannot do the school any 
good, will receive benefit to themselves. They will be 
more in touch and in sympathy with the teacher and 
pupils, and have a greater interest in what is being 
done for their children.
-P-A-G-E-120
*, 126 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Summarizing, we observe that in this chapter six 
things have been suggested for keeping up the interest, 
each going sufficiently into details to be a guide to the 
teacher. Upon him or her everything depends. A lazy 
or indifferent teacher may read it over and decide that 
these things are too difficult, or require too much ex- 
ertion and drift along as before. But one who is alive 
to his own growth and to the advancement of his school, 
will welcome suggestions from whatever source and 
will seek to put into execution every plan that com- 
mends itself to his judgment.

  CHAPTER VI 
LOVE AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Love, according to the New Testament, is the ful- 
filling of the law. The “law” has reference to the 
commandments of the Old Testament, but considered 
from a modern standpoint it means everything that 
can rightfully be required of us. If it were possible to 
perform every act that pertains to successful teaching 
without love in our hearts, we should still be indebted 
to the law. On the other hand, if we have love in full 
measure, we shall fulfill the law, because love will 
stimulate us to perform all necessary outward acts. 
Love is within, but is manifested from without. We 
can judge of a person’s love only by his words, his 
deeds, his manner toward us. We cannot see the heart. 
Love manifests itself by respect, by thoughtfulness and 
by consideration for our welfare. It is not mercenary, 
asks for no reward except to be loved in return, and 
this is certain to follow as “‘love begets love.’ The best 
description of it is that of Paul in his First Letter to the 
Corinthians, the thirteenth chapter. There it is trans- 
lated “‘charity.” It is the same feeling expressed in 
the song of the Angels at the Savior’s birth, ‘Peace on 
earth, good will to men.”

i. Ir Must BE WitTHouT PARTIALITY 
The Unlovable Children——Many teachers find it diffi- 
cult to love all their pupils. Some children are so 
happy in disposition that it is as easy to love them as 
to love beautiful flowers. A wealth of affection is show- 
ered upon them and they flourish in its atmosphere. 
But with an unlovely child, the case is different; there 
is nothing, or very little, that inspires affection. Yet it 
is possible to love the worst specimens of mankind, 
otherwise we should not have been commanded to love 
everybody, even our enemies. 
Love should be most bountifully bestowed where it 
is most needed, and obviously the disagreeable, ‘hate- 
ful” child stands first in this respect. His ugly dispo- 
sition is due to the lack of proper affection. Neglected 
children are unloved children. Love never neglects. 
Such need the affection of the teacher and can be 
reached and benefited by no other power. The boy 
who is rude and rough may have no conception of 
what love is, but he will none the less be susceptible to 
its influences. 
Interest and Pity Akin to Love.—If the teacher finds it 
difficult to love certain ones, he may at least take an 
interest in them. Every child is interesting. If one 
seems especially disagreeable, make a study of him. 
Find out the circumstances and conditions of his bring- 
ing up. A revelation of the truth is almost certain to 
arouse pity, and pity is akin to love. An impulse will
-P-A-G-E-123
LOVE AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 129 
at once arise to show kindness, where nothing but neg- 
lect and perhaps cruelty has been shown. Follow up 
the impulse and persevere until the heart has been 
reached. There is in every boy’s heart a soft spot that 
love will sooner or later find, and once having gained 
an entrance, the way is easy. Many of the most in- 
corrigible are unconsciously heart hungry for affection, 
but cruelty and deceit have made them suspicious of 
advances. The confidence of such must be won com- 
pletely, before they will make known their real thoughts. 
An “ Incorrigible ” Boy.—A story is told of a teacher 
in one of the Chicago schools who tried faithfully to 
reach the heart of an incorrigible boy, but without 
success. Despairing at length, she decided he must be 
reported to the principal and expelled. Wishing to 
make one more effort before resorting to this extremity, 
she asked the boy to stay after the others were dis- 
missed at noon. He remained in his seat with a coun- 
tenance hard and sullen. The teacher sat down beside 
him and spoke pleasantly, telling him she would be glad 
to do something for him and asking why he had re- 
pulsed all her efforts at kindness. The boy looked up 
with tears in his eyes and said, ‘‘Teacher, it’s ’cause 
I’m so durned hungry.” It was a revelation. The 
teacher would never have thought of attributing his 
hardness to such a cause. He was provided with a 
good dinner that day and every day thereafter, and 
gave no further trouble. Love was the fulfilling of the 
law in his case.

2. THE RELATION OF LovE To PUNISHMENT 
Natural Consequences.—In bestowing love, the teacher 
does not surrender the reins of government, nor 
the right to punish when necessary. Love must be 
neither weak nor cowardly. But it never punishes for 
the sake of seeking an outlet to angry feelings, nor to 
avenge misdeeds. In fact, love seldom resorts to arbi- 
trary punishment, that is, punishment that has no re- 
lation to the wrong committed. It seeks to let wrong- 
doing meet with its natural consequence. Thus, if a 
pupil wastes his study period, he cannot recite; he is 
humiliated before the teacher and the class; he receives 
a low mark, and loses a certain amount of his standing 
in scholarship. All this is the natural consequence of 
wasting time and to avoid a repetition, he need only to 
be reminded kindly of it. 
Likewise, if a pupil indulges in falsehood, the pun- 
ishment is not a whipping, nor standing in a corner, nor 
getting a double lesson. The natural result of lying is 
loss of character and reputation. It is to have one’s 
word doubted when he wants to have it trusted. It is 
to be under suspicion in other ways, because if one will 
stoop to lie, he will not hesitate to commit other sins. 
These natural results are a thousand times more serious 
than some little bodily discomfort. Love points out all 
these, and if corporal punishment is ever resorted to, 
it is only for the sake of bringing some heedless one to 
his senses.

The Needs of the Little Ones.—Again, the manifesta- 
tions of love must differ in the various grades. It may 
be shown to the six-year-olds in a hundred ways that 
will not apply to the older pupils. When children first 
enter school, they must be shown many little atten- 
tions to make them feel at home. The teacher must 
be all in all to them in this strange new place. He may 
be just as strict as he likes, providing he administers 
his requirements with gentleness and love. 
The wants of the little ones are numerous and should 
have attention. Judgment must be exercised as to 
which of these desires shall be granted, and which re- 
fused. At playtime, they should have watchful care. 
Their feelings will be hurt, and must be soothed by a 
kind word and a pat on the head. Physical bumps and 
bruises occur frequently, and the teacher’s sympathy is 
craved and should be extended. In short, their utter 
dependence should make a strong appeal to the teach- 
er’s heart, calling for all that is kind and helpful in his 
nature. 
The greatest demand upon the teacher's love, however, 
will come in the giving of instruction to these little people. 
It is a great thing to start a child on 3 way to learn- 
ing. No bungler should be trusted with so important a 
task. Much of the child’s success in life, possibly his 
destiny, depends upon the impetus given to his mind 
and heart in the first months of his school life. A
-P-A-G-E-126
  132 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
warm-hearted, loving teacher will make every lesson 
a delight, and cause learning to appear, as it is, the 
one thing in the world most to be desired; while a cold 
and indifferent teacher will afford no inspiration, will 
make study seem a profitless task and knowledge a 
dead and unattractive thing. There can be but little 
growth in such an atmosphere. Children expect love 
and thrive in it. Their hearts open to it as naturally 
as the flower opens to the rays of the sun. 
The Second and Third Grades.—These children are not 
so dependent upon the teacher’s care. They have be- 
come accustomed to the routine of the school, know 
how to get their lessons and in a large measure how to 
look out for themselves both in the schoolroom and on 
the playground. But still they have their rights and 
demands upon the teacher’s affection. They have 
learned to trust in him, to bask in his smiles, to look 
for his approval. If he were to withdraw his attention, 
life would be cheerless indeed. His every act is no- 
ticed, his moods watched, his words eet He is 
their authority on all school matters. 
That everybody recognizes this disposition is s shown 
in the oft-repeated question, ‘‘How do you like the 
teacher?” If the children “‘like” the teacher and are 
enthusiastic in their praise, it is all the evidence most 
people need. ‘They are willing to take the pupils’ 
judgment. This shows that so far as his standing in 
the community goes, it is wise for the teacher to be on 
good terms with the pupils.
-P-A-G-E-127
LOVE AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 133 
By the time children have reached the second and 
third grades, their individual dispositions are somewhat 
developed and traits of character begin to be more pro- 
nounced. Some will yield readily to the teacher’s 
wishes, others will “‘try his patience.” The greatest 
care is needed that no impartiality be shown. It is not 
necessary to treat all alike,—their dispositions require 
different treatment, but it is necessary to extend to all 
the same courtesy and the same degree of good will. 
No matter what unlovely traits develop, they must not 
be permitted to bias the mind of the teacher. 
Don’t “lay up” against a child a great mistake, or 
even a great misdeed. Expect him to repent of it and 
outgrow it, and help him to do so. Cultivate all that is 
noble, and eradicate if possible all that is evil. Love is 
the most potent factor in the world for this. 
The Backward Pupils.—In nearly every country school 
there are some pupils who are woefully behind in their 
education, boys and girls nearly grown, who have 
scarcely learned to read. Circumstances over which 
they perhaps have had no control have kept them out 
of school, while class after class has gone on until now 
they are years behind. At the beginning of each term, 
their unquenched longing for knowledge lures them, 
into the schoolroom to find their former classmates far 
in advance, making rapid and cheerful progress, and 
themselves classed with children whom they knew as 
babies. What shall be done with these belated ones? 
The common way is to class them with little ones and 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  134 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
let them sink or swim. They usually flounder a while 
and sink. They are self-conscious and ashamed, can- 
not share in the enthusiasm of their classmates and feel 
strange and out of place. .They are likely to be re- 
garded with pity or contempt, either of which is hard 
to bear, and so they grow discouraged and give it up, 
hoping to find some more favorable opportunity. 
There is no doubt but that, for a time at least, an ex- 
tra amount of attention should be shown them. Spare 
no pains to have them learn something each day and 
point out their progress to them. Give some special 
word of encouragement every evening and predict still 
greater success for the future. Watch for the slightest 
sign of discouragement and drive it away with assur- 
ances that they are doing excellently and if only they 
will persevere, they will win. 
If time will possibly permit, it is better not to put 
these grown-ups in classes with the little ones. They 
will be more comfortable and advance more rapidly by 
themselves. Much of the work given the smaller ones, 
they do not need and are embarrassed by it. The 
teacher’s manner to the children is not suited to them; 
they need to be addressed according to their age rather 
than to their advancement in learning. Besides, it is ab- 
surd to have them going over little sentences about dogs 
and cats, tops and dolls, and the hundred other trifles 
that are perfectly suited to the children. Paul’s state- 
ment expresses it admirably, ‘‘When I was a child, I 
thought as a child, I spake as a child; but when I be-
-P-A-G-E-129
  LOVE AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 135 
came a man, I put away childish things.” Give them 
something suited to their age and manner of thinking, 
and let them work it out, extending such help as they 
need. By all means let them recite by themselves. 
Also, they should be constantly reminded that they 
re “catching up.” In fact, the whole process of their 
learning is ‘catching up” knowledge that should have 
been acquired long ago. If a belated one is strong in 
some one branch, let him devote as much time as he 
likes to it for a while. It will be a great day when it can 
be said, ‘‘ John is as good in arithmetic, or in reading, 
as any one of his age.” This gives him a sure footing, 
and all that is necessary now is to tell him he must bring 
up other studies. A little reflection will show that this 
is not only good common sense, but that it is sound 
pedagogy. A little knowledge of what has been done by some of 
these cases of arrested education should be a great 
stimulus to any teacher, and he ought to be glad of an 
opportunity to extend a helping hand to any within his 
reach. 
A Helpful Story —One of the best county superintend- 
ents the writer has ever known, is fond of encouraging 
backward ones by telling his own experience. His 
schooling began when he was sixteen years of age, as a 
result of an accident that left him a cripple for several 
months. 
The father was not in favor of education; he would 
teach his boy to work. But when work was out of the
-P-A-G-E-130
  136 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
question and the boy begged to go to school, his wish 
was granted. What a revelation it was! He looked 
with wonder and envy at boys of his own age who 
could read like a ‘‘house afire,” could work hard 
“sums,” and who “‘rattled off big words, such as ‘can- 
cellation,’ ‘longitude and time,’ ‘allegation medial’ and 
‘duodecimals.’’’ How ashamed he was of his ig- 
norance! Could he ever acquire such knowledge? 
However, he applied himself with all his might and 
made such strides, that when he was recovered of his 
injury there was no keeping him out of school. He was 
willing to work hard in vacation, but when school 
opened, his father was practically compelled to yield. 
The result was that in four years he took the county 
examination and came out triumphant with a third 
class certificate. Could it be possible that he was now 
equipped to teach a district school? He could scarcely 
believe it, yet there was the proof, signed by the county 
superintendent and the other examiners. He secured 
a school, taught it to the satisfaction of the district, and 
with the money earned went away to school. This he 
did repeatedly until he was the leading teacher in the 
county. His speciality was encouraging boys and girls 
who had never had a “chance.” While still under 
thirty, he was elected to the county superintendency, 
and by all accounts did the most efficient work ever 
known in that community. Had he been put with the 
little ones to keep pace with them, no such record could 
have been made.
-P-A-G-E-131
  LOVE AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 137 
Other Cases in Point.—T wo other county superintend- 
ents, known to the writer, learned to read after they 
were eighteen and earned certificates before they were 
twenty-two. One of the brightest young lawyers of to- 
day went to ‘College’ when he was seventeen and 
was put in a primary grade. Four years served to com- 
plete the “common branches” and three more, inter- 
spersed with teaching, to graduate from a higher course. 
Many other like cases could be given, but these are 
sufficient to show what can be done and to point the 
way toward its accomplishment. All will not do equally 
well, but every one should be given a chance to make 
the most of his time and talents. 
The Very Poor.—Another class needing a large amount 
of sympathy consists of those who are very poor and 
who in consequence lack the necessities of school life, 
namely, books and clothing. The only thing such 
children can have in abundance is love, and they ought 
not to be deprived of that, though it is often denied 
them. 
The district school is and should be the most demo- 
cratic institution in our country. Here the rich and the 
poor meet on equal terms. They sit side by side, study _ 
the same lessons and receive the same instruction. 
Each one stands upon his own merits without regard 
to the kind of clothes he wears, or the wealth or social 
standing of his parents. ‘The talent of the poor boy, 
whether in the class or on the playground, is respected 
equally with that of the rich. Real success has no fa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  138 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
vors to bestow upon either poverty or wealth. It de- 
pends upon industry, perseverance and nobility of 
character. These cannot be bought with money, nor 
can the poor be deprived of them because of their 
poverty. 
If certain very poor children lack books, it is the 
teacher’s duty to see that they are supplied. This re- 
quires tact. The poor are often extremely sensitive, 
and will quickly repel any proposition that appears to 
reflect upon their poverty. The children may be told 
to ask their parents to supply them with certain books. 
If, after a reasonable time, the books are not forth- 
coming, it will be best to call upon the parents and 
kindly request that the children should have them. If 
the parents frankly admit that they are too poor to buy 
them and if their surroundings bear out the statement, 
some offer of assistance may be made. It may not be 
necessary or wise to use the district funds for the 
whole amount. It is better for people to help them- 
selves as far as possible. There are not many in the 
country so reduced that they cannot afford the small 
sum necessary for schoolbooks. 
If the children are kept at home for want of cloth- 
ing, it is a still more delicate matter. If the teacher is 
_ friendly and appears to take a real interest in the little 
ones, the mother will admit that they lack suitable 
clothing. The matter may then be fully discussed and 
the wisest course chosen. The one great point should 
be adhered to, the children must be in school,
-P-A-G-E-133

The Bright Pupils.—While we are caring for the little 
ones and for those who have advanced to the second 
and third grades, for the ones who are behind and the 
pupils who lack books and clothing, we must not for- 
get the bright and fortunate pupils. Some one may say 
they can take care of themselves. But that would not 
be right. They are entitled to their share of attention 
and affection no less than the others. It is sometimes 
urged that they will keep up anyway, whether they 
have the teacher’s assistance or not. Very likely they 
would, but the fact that they do keep up does not re- 
lieve the teacher from the discharge of his duty to them. 
If they do well without assistance, they will do much 
better with it. What farmer would neglect his best 
stock to give all his time and care to that which is less 
promising ? 
On the other hand, some teachers give too much to 
the bright ones, because they are companionable and 
respond readily to instruction. This also is wrong. 
Every child should have his full share of the teacher’s 
heart and mind and no more. His love must be be- 
stowed impartially. It is not possible for a teacher to 
love his pupils too much, provided his affection is dis- 
tributed properly. 
If certain ones learn more readily than others, they 
should be given more work; otherwise they are liable 
to fall into loose habits. They will learn their task and 
waste the remainder of the period, and this happening 
continually will result in a greater disadvantage than
-P-A-G-E-134
  140 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
being slow to learn. One of the best habits any child 
can learn is that of industry. No amount of bright- 
ness can make up for the lack of it. Bright children 
often end in disappointment to parents and teachers, 
and people wonder why they have not fulfilled their 
early promise. If by their brightness they have learned 
to avoid the drudgery of toil, no further explanation 
need be sought. The old saying, “There is no excel- 
lence without great labor,” needs to be drilled into the 
minds of the bright students no less than into the minds 
of the slower ones. 
From the above it is readily seen that bright pupils 
must be kept at work. This is one of the duties that 
Severely taxes the teacher. He is often at his wits’ end 
to know how to provide work that is suitable. It is 
out of the question to have separate recitations for all, 
permitting each one to go as fast as he can. They 
must be kept in classes. 
Though it is difficult, the ingenious teacher will find 
some way of keeping the ready ones at work. He may 
“make up” problems in arithmetic, set them to draw- 
ing a special map in geography, to hunting up events 
in history, or he may supply them with extra reading 
matter, requiring a brief account of all that is done. 
In this way each one has an opportunity to cultivate 
his talents to the extent of his ability, and no pupil 
should be debarred from that privilege. 
The Most Advanced Pupils.—Lastly, we have to con- 
_ sider the pupils that are most advanced, those that
-P-A-G-E-135
  LOVE AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING I4t 
are within a year or two of completing the common 
school course. ‘They need wise and loving counsel in 
their plans for 4he future. Usually they do not know 
just what occupation or profession they wish to follow, 
and it is not necessary that they should. Their minds 
are not sufficiently developed to make certain any par- 
ticular bent. What they need is a general education 
that will develop all the faculties and give them a 
broader outlook. 
They should be encouraged to talk about the future 
in connection with their own lives. It is the teacher’s 
opportunity to tell them of the possibilities in store for 
them. Country children living far from the centers of 
industry, if left to themselves, have but few ideals 
from which to choose. They must form their ideals 
from the life they see about them, and this consists of 
farmers and a few each of teachers, doctors, lawyers, 
preachers and country merchants. Some of these are 
not the best representatives of their class, and if none 
of them appeal to a youth, he is left to drift. 
The teacher should tell his pupils of the great indus- 
tries and enterprises of the world, of the opportunities to 
do good and to make a name among men. He should 
point out clearly the qualifications necessary to suc- 
cess—faithfulness, honesty, industry. He should dwell 
upon the advantages that a good education and thor- 
ough preparation give. He should lead his pupils to 
think carefully about the advisability of going on with 
their education. In their lessons, he should be sug- 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  142 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
gesting continually things they will learn when they 
come to the study of algebra, geometry and Latin. 
Their ambitions will thus be aroused and their minds 
turned into proper channels of thought. Many a suc- 
cessful man bears grateful testimony to the fact that 
some wise teacher of his youth first placed before his 
mind the ideals that led to his usefulness, first aroused 
in his heart an ambition to do something that would 
make the world better. 
The Bad Boy.—It would not do to close this chapter 
without a word concerning the ‘‘bad boy” and the 
“dull boy.” They are not mentioned together here be- 
cause they are usually found in the same class. More 
often than otherwise the worst boy has a bright mind. 
Frequently he is the best material in the school. - The 
reason he is “bad” is because his restless energies have 
not been directed into right channels. Not having any- 
thing good as an outlet to his energy, he has taken up 
with whatever came to hand, frequently falling into mis- 
chief. He has acquired the name of being a bad boy 
and has accepted it, thinking this course the only way 
to have a good time. 
The best chance for such a boy is a loving teacher 
who can see his good points, who will not scold and 
who will see that his energies are directed to things 
worth doing. It is well worth while to expend a large 
amount of heart power on the ‘“‘bad boy.” If you suc- 
ceed, you will “save one soul from death and hide a 
multitude of sins.” If he is hardened in his ways,
-P-A-G-E-137
  
LOVE AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 143 
there is all the more demand upon the power of the 
heart. It is the only force that can reach him. It must 
be the kind of love that shows no weakness, no flinch- 
ing, sticks to him through thick and thin and calls him 
firmly to task when guilty of willful wrong. 
The experience of the writer has led him to believe 
that the difference between a good boy and a bad one fre- 
quently lies in the teacher. A boy soon learns whether 
or not a teacher has the power to enforce his own re- 
quirements. If he has that power, his authority will be 
respected; if he lacks it, his wishes will be disregarded 
and the boy will take his own course. It often happens 
in graded schools that boys who are bad under a teacher 
weak in government, reform at once when promoted 
to a grade taught by one who is a master of discipline. 
Boys have a great respect for one who is master of the 
situation. 
The Dull Child.—The dull child presents, perhaps, the 
most difficult problem of all. To succeed with him, 
three qualities are necessary in almost infinite amount, 
love, patience and perseverance. No one need despair 
of a dull child, for no one can tell his possibilities. 
John Wesley as a man was an intellectual giant, tower- 
ing above the common world like a colossus; but as a 
child, he was considered a blockhead by his own father. 
The story is told of his mother’s trying to teach him. 
With infinite patience and love she repeated the lesson 
over and over again. The father, vexed with this ap- 
parently endless and fruitless effort, exclaimed, “Why
-P-A-G-E-138
144 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
do you tell that boy the same thing twenty times over ?” 
“Because,” replied the mother, ‘if I stop at nineteen 
John will not understand it.” In after life Mr. Wes- 
ley attributed his attainments to the love and faithful- 
ness of his mother. 
The great Dr. Chalmers of Scotland was so dull as 
a boy that he was actually expelled from the school of 
St. Andrews because of his stupidity. As a man, he 
attained to great distinction as a scholar, preacher and 
reformer, and was elected to a professorship in the very 
school from which he was expelled. What a comment _ 
on the wisdom of his teachers, yet they were doubtless 
as wise as their fellows, or as teachers are now. Scores 
of such examples could be given. 
What often passes for dullness is not a lack of men- — 
tal endowment, but comes rather from a slow develop- 
ment of the faculties. Minds do not always develop | 
alike. Many of the master minds of the world were 
long in maturing, as, for example, Sir Walter Scott, who 
was called a dunce at school; Lord Byron, who was — 
  seldom anywhere but at the foot of his class, and Lord — 
Robert Clive, who excelled all his classmates in the 
time he spent wearing the dunce-cap, but who at thirty- 
two was the most brilliant general in the British army. 
Physical Deficiencies.—A gain, apparent mental stupid- 
ity is frequently caused by partial deafness or some de- 
ficiency of eyesight. Children seldom know how well 
others can see or hear and hence are not aware of any 
weakness in themselves. Such children miss much of
-P-A-G-E-139
  
LOVE AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 145 
the instruction given the class and are likely to be inat- 
tentive. They are consequently considered stupid or 
lacking in interest, and little intelligent effort is made 
to arouse them. 
If a child appears dull, the teacher should go to some 
pains to ascertain the cause. Some very simple tests 
for eyes and ears may be given. Questions asked in 
low tones will show whether the hearing is acute. Test- 
ing different ones as to how far they can hear the tick- 
ing of a watch is an excellent way to discover any lack 
of hearing in any of the pupils. For the eyesight, ob- 
serve how far letters an inch high can be seen distinctly. 
If they cannot be read at ten or twelve feet, there is 
something wrong. 
When any lack in these senses is discovered, the par- 
ents should be informed and the skill of a physician 
recommended. In the meantime the teacher should do 
his utmost by kindness, sympathy and attention to make 
up for the deficiency. The dull of hearing should have 
a seat near the front, and the instruction of the class 
should be given in his direction so that he may not miss 
it. The child whose eyesight is poor should be allowed 
to sit in the best lighted spot and to approach the black- 
board at any time he desires to read from it. In these 
and other ways love conquers all difficulties. 
This is but a brief outline of what love demands and 
of what it can accomplish. The teacher who is really 
great in heart will strive to learn the disposition and 
character and all that pertains to the growth and cul- 
Dist. School—1o
-P-A-G-E-140
  146 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
ture of each pupil, and he will find it the most interest- 
ing study in the world. His increasing knowledge of 
their good and bad traits, their frailties and follies as 
well as their sterling qualities, will appeal more strongly 
to his heart and cause him to strive earnestly to meet 
every requirement. If he does this, he cannot fail.
-P-A-G-E-141
CHAPTER VII 
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 
Frequently parents complain that the work of the 
school is not practical. Business men also make the 
same criticism. They claim that when they employ a 
student from the public schools, they find him lacking 
in the knowledge of the common things of life. He 
may be well enough versed in text-book matters, rules 
and definitions and theoretical ideas, but his knowl- 
edge is not practical. He has not grasped his subjects 
in such a way as to make use of them in his work. 
Such criticism is frequently unfair. Young people 
cannot be expected to have a complete stock of practi- 
cal wisdom until they have had an opportunity to ac- 
quire it by experience. Yet there is no doubt reason 
for the complaint. We, as teachers, are not always as 
careful as we should be to keep our instruction in line 
with everyday duties. It is wise to consider all well- 
meant criticisms and profit by them. Removed as we 
are, with our professional duties, from the great busi- 
ness world, there is doubtless danger of our becoming 
too theoretical. 
The purpose of this chapter is to show how to make 
the work of the school of practical use to the pupils in 
147
-P-A-G-E-142
  
  148 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
their present and future daily life. We will consider 
the branches separately. 
1. READING 
We learn to read in order that we may read. If we 
learn to read and make no use of our accomplishment, 
it will profit us little. We live in a reading age. By 
means of the newspapers we keep in touch with the 
principal happenings of the world, and learn something _ 
of the people who are in the public eye. By means of | 
magazines and books we get the best thoughts of the — 
leading thinkers and writers. Without these means we 
should be extremely limited in knowledge of events and 
ideas. Those who cannot or do not read, lose a very 
great part of what is essential to a happy and useful 
life. 
A School Library.—It is important that the reading 
habit be acquired early. The longer it is put off after 
school age is reached, the more difficult it will be. As 
soon as children have learned to read readily, they 
should be supplied with reading matter suitable to their 
understanding. ‘To this end there should be in every 
district school a small library of juvenile books. These — 
should be chosen with a view to their charm, as well | 
as to their knowledge and moral teaching, otherwise the 
end sought will be frustrated in the beginning. If the — 
thought is heavy or the matter dull, the children will 
give it up in disgust. The safest course is to seek the
-P-A-G-E-143
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 149 
advice of an experienced librarian or teacher. When 
the books are obtained, the teacher should sce that they 
are distributed wisely and a record kept of the name 
of each student and of the book he has drawn. 
Discussion and Application.—The teacher should keep 
track of the reading by asking questions each day or at 
appointed times. It will be much better if the teacher 
has read the books before they are given out, as he will 
be able to discuss them with so much greater intelli- 
gence. Discussion of books or articles adds very much 
to the delight as well as to the profit of the reader, and 
others hearing it and seeing the interest taken, will 
want to read also in order to join in the discussion. 
It is an excellent thing for the teacher to read aloud 
some good and appropriate book, using ten minutes or 
so each day for the purpose. In some districts certain 
of the patrons may object to this, but if the purpose is 
kindly explained and the value shown, such objection 
is not likely to prove serious. Before the -reading let 
some pupil give a brief account of what was read the 
previous day, the teacher making such additional ob- 
servations as he may think best. Many a pupil has been 
helped on the road to usefulness by this means. 
The school readers are always well supplied with good 
literature which should have attention. No lesson 
should be read without discussion and without having 
the practical parts applied to the lives of the pupils,— 
with this one caution, that they should as far as possible 
make the application themselves. To get the most out 
.
-P-A-G-E-144
  150 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
of this work, it is essential that the school be supplied 
with new reading matter frequently, as often as once a 
year if possible. Here is where supplementary readers 
are of great value. 
Owning Books.—The children should be encouraged 
to own a few books. Some of the world’s best read- 
ing matter may be bought in books that cost from five 
to ten cents. Almost any child can raise that much. 
If the teacher has one or two copies to show what they 
are like and a catalogue to select from, it ought not to 
be a difficult thing to induce a few of the pupils to in- 
vest their pennies in this way. Those that purchase 
may, after reading, exchange with each other, thus get- 
ting the use of several books for the price of one. This 
process will spread until all will have some good litera- 
ture. 
All this is some trouble, but is it not worth a great 
deal to be able to direct the minds of the children of a 
district into right channels; to introduce them to the 
best works of the great writers that their minds may be 
molded better than they could otherwise be? Let no 
teacher think he has discharged his duty when he has 
taught the children how to read. They must be taught 
also the habit of reading. 
It is important that trashy literature should not get 
into their hands to poison their minds and create a 
taste that will prove harmful. It is one of the roads to 
ruin and should be guarded against the same as any 
other vice. The teacher should keep a sharp lookout

for it and if it appears destroy it, but he should always 
put something good in its place. 
Reading at Home.—Reading should be encouraged also 
in the homes. The teacher may frequently give himself 
the pleasure of sending a paper by one of the pupils, 
with a marked article for the father to read, at the same 
time requesting his opinion concerning it. If this is 
done tactfully a few times, it may be the means of get- 
ting the paper permanently into the home. If the 
father is not a reader, ask the son or daughter to read . 
the article aloud to the parents.and find out what they 
think about it. If they are pleased, repeat the experi- 
ment until a taste is formed. They will come to look 
upon it as a pleasure and by and by as a necessity, and 
it will prove a great blessing to both parents and chil- 
dren. 
2. GRAMMAR 
The Value of Correct English.—This branch is so thor- 
oughly practical, so necessary in the daily life of every 
person, that it needs no other excuse for occupying a 
large space in the curriculum. We study grammar 
that we may speak and write the English language 
correctly. Every grown American ought to be able to 
do that. Everybody must talk, hence everybody must 
use the English tongue, since it is the language of our 
country. It is a blessed thing to be brought up by 
educated people and to be associated with them, but 
even then one cannot understand a language without 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  152 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
making a study of it, therefore it is taught in all 
schools. 
To speak correctly is the first mark of an educated per- 
son. He may know little of mathematics and the world 
be none the wiser. He may be ignorant of any one or 
of many of the so-called higher branches and still be a+ 
cultured person. But let him open his mouth to speak 
and commit a single blunder, and his doom is sealed, 
he is classed with the uneducated. The world cannot 
take the time to look into every man’s record to dis- 
cover what he has studied and what he has not. The 
one great test is ever at hand,—does he speak correct 
English? We have only to ask a question or wait for 
a passing remark, and. very often the matter is set- 
tled. 
A private, seeking promotion, was brought before 
an army officer for examination. The officer asked 
the private if he knew where a certain man was. The 
latter answered, ‘‘I seen him yesterday, but I haven’t 
saw him to-day.” He was dismissed at once, the offi- 
cer remarking that a man who murdered the “King’s 
English” like that was not fit to give orders. 
Another illustration is that of a young lady who for 
several years had been teaching in the country, but who, 
wishing a position in the city schools, applied to. the 
superintendent. He at once inquired pleasantly if she 
had seen any of the members of the Board. She re- 
plied, “‘No, I haven’t saw any of them.” Her exami- 
nation went no farther and her excellent “testimonials”
-P-A-G-E-147
  MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 153 
availed nothing. She had failed to recommend her- 
self by avoiding common errors of speech. 
Let it be understood that grammar is no test of the 
character of an individual. A man may be a good citi- 
zen, thoroughly honest and upright and worthy of re- 
spect, and know nothing of the rules of grammar. It 
is only a test of education and culture. The private 
may have been and no doubt was a brave and faithful 
soldier, and the young lady teacher was doubtless kind 
to the children and above reproach in conduct, but both 
lacked one of the first essentials for the positions sought, 
namely, the ability to speak correct English. 
The Difficulties of the Study.—It is often asserted that 
grammar is the poorest taught of any of the branches 
in the district schools. Pupils come out fairly profi- 
cient in geography and arithmetic, but extremely lame 
in the essentials of grammar. There are two reasons 
for this: first, the teachers themselves were poorly 
taught; and second, grammar is a difficult study, par- 
ticularly in its applications. This is accounted for by . 
the many peculiarities of our language, such as the dif- 
ferent ways of forming the singular and plural number, 
the use of regular and irregular verbs, and of the nom- 
inative and objective cases in pronouns. Pupils are 
plunged into grammar and confronted with a mass of 
definitions, rules and statements which to them has no 
connection with everyday speech, and which so con- 
fuses them that they are helplessly lost, like the boy 
who declared “I can’t see no sense in grammar.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  154 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Correcting Simple Errors.—Much can be done by be- 
ginning early and keeping the work simple enough for 
the understanding of the children. First reader pupils 
may learn the correct use of “is” and “are,” “has” 
and “have,” “was” and “‘were,’” and the like, holding 
to a few until they are learned. The second reader class 
may learn the forms of a few irregular verbs, such as 
“see” and “do.”? One of the commonest errors is that 
of using the perfect participle for the past tense, as “T 
seen” and ‘‘I done,” for “‘I saw” and ‘‘I did.” These 
should be corrected continually and the forms for the dif- 
ferent persons and numbers of the past tense repeated 
until they are firmly fixed in the minds of all, and until 
they have learned to use them without stopping to think. 
For example, when a pupil says he, or she, or we, 
“done” this or that, the teacher should call attention 
to the wrong form and have it corrected. Let some one 
inflect the past tense as follows: I did, you did, he did, 
we did, you did, they did. In ordinary spéech there is 
never any change in the past tense of a verb for person 
and number, except in the verb ‘‘to be.’ Let it be ob- 
served that the perfect participle of a verb is never 
used except in a perfect tense with “have” or “has,” 
or in the passive voice with some form of the verb ’*‘to 
be.” Constant attention to these common errors for a 
few months will work wonders. 
Pronunciation and Meaning of Words.—Pronunciation 
likewise is a part of grammar and must not be neg- 
lected. It is perhaps more difficult to change one’s
-P-A-G-E-149
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 155 
habit of pronouncing some common word than it is to 
correct grammatical errors. If one has always said 
“crap” for “crop,” or ‘‘thar” for “there,” it is no easy 
matter to make the change. However, it is easiest in 
early life and for that reason it is best to be diligent in 
drilling correct pronunciation into the minds of the 
younger pupils. 
All from the fourth reader up should be taught the 
use of the dictionary. Every school in the land should 
be provided with an unabridged dictionary, but if one 
is not obtainable, an academic can be made to answer. 
Encourage the children to look up the meaning and pro- 
nunciation of words. This will aid them materially in 
learning the diacritical markings. It will assist them 
also in the study of words, their derivation, relation, etc. 
3. GEOGRAPHY 
A Practical Beginning.—Many teachers find it most 
practical in teaching geography to begin with the im- 
mediate surroundings. The first thing to observe is 
the configuration of the land,—plains, hills, mountains, 
valleys, slopes. The next thing’ is to learn directions. 
After the points of the compass are understood, the 
various directions may be acquired more readily if the 
children are asked to point them out, or to walk a few 
steps toward a certain point as north, northeast, south, 
southeast, southwest. Objects also may be pointed out 
and their direction from the school house determined.
-P-A-G-E-150
  156 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
When direction is sufficiently understood, distance 
should be taught. ‘The units for short measurements of 
land should be shown accurately. The “foot” and 
“yard” .are easily obtained by lines on the blackboard 
and by sticks. Many measurements of nearby objects 
should be made by the ‘children. For the “rod” a 
light pole, of exact length, may be used. With this, 
many distances from one to twenty rods should be 
ascertained, allowing the children to guess and writing 
down each guess before measuring. 
In the United States the ordinary unit for geographi- 
cal measurements is the mile. It will pay to take some 
time and pains to have the pupils acquire a pretty ac- 
curate idea of this unit. If there is no known mile 
within reach, let them measure one along the best road 
available from the schoolhouse, setting up a mark at 
the end. Thus the foundation will be laid for further 
study and comparison. The children will be very much 
interested in the length of time it will take to go a mile,— 
walking, running, riding horseback, on a bicycle, in an 
automobile and on the train. This cultivates the judg- 
ment both in respect to time and distance. 
We may next proceed to study the surface of the land, 
beginning with its irregularities of hills, valleys and 
plains. This will lead naturally to the action of water 
upon the slopes and in the valleys. The work of ero- 
sion can be seen everywhere, even in the schoolyard. 
Its progress can be watched during a shower, when 
tiny rills make their way into larger streams, uniting
-P-A-G-E-151
  
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 157 
as they go and carrying with them particles of soil over 
which they pass. This will lead to the fact that all 
streams, large and small, are made in this way, and 
to many other interesting discoveries. 
The World as a Whole-—When once the children are 
thoroughly started, it will not be possible to confine 
them to their own neighborhood. - They will want to 
know about mountains and plains, rivers, lakes and 
oceans, and we shall need to take the whole world as a 
basis, proceeding carefully and tactfully. Imagine the 
surprise it must be to a child to learn that the earth is 
a great round ball and that by far the greater part of 
its surface is covered with water, that the earth turns 
on its axis every twenty-four hours and goes around 
the sun once a year. It requires not only a great stretch 
of the imagination to see it, but a violent strain upon 
his credulity to believe it. Is it to be wondered at if 
he hesitates and doubts? 
It took wise men thousands of years to learn these 
facts, and generations to convince the people generally 
of their truth. There are even yet uneducated men of 
fair intelligence who are not convinced. 
It is well to keep children some weeks, or even 
months, studying local geography before bringing them 
to the difficult task of considering the earth as a whole. 
Let them wonder where the end of the earth is, what 
is beyond and what it rests upon, until their own in- 
vestigations bring them to the necessity of an explana- 
tion. Permit them to exhaust their own ingenuity in
-P-A-G-E-152
  158 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
accounting for things, before telling them the facts. 
It will teach them to think. 
The Use of the Globe-—When the time comes to 
teach them the shape of the earth, it is better not to 
use a globe at the first. Let them use their imagina- 
tions. It will require time and stretch upon stretch to 
take it in, with constant changes and additions to the 
picture. The questions they will ask, while groping for 
an understanding, will be many and varied and will 
require patience and knowledge to answer. To guide 
their young minds through these searchings for truth 
is a privilege any teacher may well covet. 
When their minds are satisfied with the main facts 
concerning the shape of the earth, its position and 
movements, it will be time to use the globe. By it they 
will get the forms, the relative sizes and positions of 
the principal bodies of land and water. The names of 
the oceans, of the hemispheres and the grand divisions 
may be pointed out, though it is not necessary to spend 
time in committing them to memory, as in gaining 
other knowledge they will gradually learn their names 
by referring constantly to them. 
That three fourths of the surface of the earth is 
covered with water is always a matter for surprise to 
children and appears to them a waste. The way the 
water gets back to land in the form of mist and rain, 
how it moistens the earth and returns again to the sea, 
will make a number of most interesting lessons. How 
the ocean has become a safe and easy highway for
-P-A-G-E-153
  
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 159 
commerce and travel between nations, bearing upon its 
bosom the stately ships that can now by means of wire- 
less telegraphy keep in touch through entire voyages, 
with each other and with the land, is also a fascinating 
topic. With the little ones, these great subjects should 
only be touched upon, giving the main facts and re- 
serving the details for more advanced work. 
The globe is necessary likewise in teaching the 
“circles” of the earth. We may begin with zones, 
being careful not to overtax young minds by burdening 
them with matters too deep for their comprehension. 
There will be plenty of time to learn the more difficult 
parts when their minds are further developed, and when 
they have acquired more information. ‘The equatorial 
line, the lines that bound the zones, with statements of 
the heat and cold of these belts, will be sufficient for 
beginners, particularly if the questions that occur to 
them are answered to their satisfaction. 
When to Use a Text-Book.—We are now ready to 
study the earth as the home of man and of the other 
animals that contribute to his comfort or pain. Up to 
this point, a book in the hands of the children would 
be a hindrance rather than a help. They have been a 
long time gathering the information outlined in the 
foregoing paragraphs, by means of talks with the 
teacher. But now they are far enough along to gather 
knowledge by reading. The modern geography with its 
pictures of people, places, industries and animals is a 
most delightful book. It should not be put into the 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
160° TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
hands of the children without a number of talks, or 
rather hints, concerning the delightful things it con- 
tains, so that they will look forward to it with eager- 
ness. . 
When a child comes into possession of a new book, 
it should be an important event in his life and the 
teacher should not fail to take notice of it and comment 
upon it. He may tell of the first book he ever had, how 
proud he was of it, what he learned from it and how 
carefully he preserved it. A little forethought of this 
nature may save reproofs and punishments later and 
be fruitful of good besides. 
A text-book in geography, even if it is the most ad- 
mirable of its kind, is not sufficient in itself. Its knowl- 
edge must be adapted to these particular children in 
this particular place, and supplemented by much that 
the teacher can supply or develop by class discussion. 
Every paragraph, every picture and map should be 
subjected to careful study and questioning, to see that 
the meaning is grasped and that the knowledge therein 
contained is added to what they have previously ac- 
quired. Everything in the book in some way touches 
their lives and the connection should be made clear. 
It takes a live teacher to do this, but it pays and any- 
thing less is not real teaching. 
Application of Knowledge Acquired.—This idea of mak- 
ing the work of the schoolroom practical by con- 
necting it with everyday life, should continue through 
all the classes and for this purpose there is no better 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 161 
study than geography. Ask the more advanced pupils 
what state they would choose, if they wished to engage 
in the occupation of wheat raising, of corn, of cotton, 
of sugar cane, and so on with the various products of 
fruit raising, grazing and mining. Where are the prin- 
cipal sources of lumber, and since the supply of tim- 
ber is being exhausted much more rapidly than new 
crops can be grown, how is the future demand to be 
met ? 
Call attention to the difference in value between. raw 
material and the same when it is manufactured into 
necessary articles. The cost of enough wood and iron 
in the raw state to make a wagon would be but a few 
dollars. When manufactured, that is, when skill has 
been added, it is worth ten or twenty times as much. 
Let us suppose the owner of the timber and of the iron 
ore lives in the Appalachian mountains. He hauls the 
raw materials to market and sells them for a small sum. 
It is shipped to a distant city in some other state and 
in a few months he may buy it again in the manufac- 
tured form at a large price, paying in addition to the 
skill, the freight both ways. In actual labor, it cost 
more to get out the raw material than to manufacture 
it into the finished article. ‘What makes the difference 
and what is the remedy? 
Geography is a fine study to induce thought. Why 
are the great cities located where they are? Why does 
one town rapidly grow into a city and another, with 
apparently as good surroundings, remain neglected? 
Dist. School—11 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  162 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Why should some sections develop their resources more 
rapidly than others? What effect does a productive 
soil have upon the civilization of a section? Why 
should ‘The Star of Empire” take its course toward 
the west? These and a thousand other questions al- 
most suggest themselves, making the study intensely 
practical and extremely useful in developing the reason- 
ing powers. 
Combining Geography and History.—In teaching the 
geography of a country, it is a great help to connect 
with it some of its principal historical events, and also ” 
its present doings with its rulers and leading charac- 
ters. Every civilized country teems with interest both 
in its past and present, if only we know the one and 
through the columns of some leading paper keep in 
touch with the other. Germany, Russia, Italy, China 
and Japan and all the others are before the world. 
The problems of one are the problems of all,—each 
can learn from the others and be helpful to the others. 
The whole world is closely akin and acquaintance 
makes more real the brotherhood of man. 
4. History 
The Way to Begin.—The study of history, like that of 
other studies, should not begin in a book. History is 
not made in books, though much of it is recorded there. 
It is written so that it may not be left to the uncertain 
memory of man; that future generations may have a 
«
-P-A-G-E-157
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 163 
truthful account of the lives of their ancestors, and 
that all the world may have the story of the rise, growth 
and life of a nation. The civilization of the world is 
built upon the doings of the past, and each individual 
character is moulded almost as much by what has been 
as by what is now. © 
For ages very little of the history of the world was 
written. It was handed down from generation to gen- 
eration by tradition. It was told around the fireside by 
parents, visitors and travelers, listened to and talked 
over by the children, who in turn gave it to others. 
This was a delightful way to learn and we can imagine 
with what breathless interest the young people lis- 
tened, when some bright traveler visited the home and 
regaled them with choice tales of the long ago. There 
was a great temptation on the part of the narrator to 
color up the stories, to make the listeners’ eyes widen 
with wonder and to inspire them with awe of one who 
knew of such marvelous happenings. 
The truth of these tales could not be trusted and 
even when history began to be written, so much of it 
was tradition that it has taken a long time to sift the 
true from the false and in many cases the real truth can 
never be known. But whether true or false, the tales 
are valuable because they are themselves a part of his- 
tory, showing how our ancestors lived and learned. 
But modern history can be relied upon, since its first 
essential is accuracy and no pains are spared to get at 
the truth. ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  164 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
But we are not ready yet, and never shall be, to dis- 
card the old way of teaching by word of mouth. No one 
knows so well as the teacher how matter should be pre- 
sented to children. Frequently the words of the book 
are not adapted to their understanding, and there is not 
enough of detail to give it life and meaning. Then the 
kindly voice, with its proper emphasis and inflection, 
and the loving smile add to the charm of the narrative. 
The teacher gets his information from books, but he 
is not confined to them for his words or his manner 
of telling. If he is describing the discoveries and early 
settlements of America, he may add a hundred details 
not given in the books that will make the mental pic- 
tures more vivid and lasting. He must be careful not 
to give any wrong impressions or false colorings. The 
actual happenings are sufficient, if told in an interesting 
manner and with the proper amount of real coloring. 
History thus taught may begin with the youngest pu- 
pils and be kept up for several years before a text-book 
is put into their hands. Their little minds should not 
be crammed with history, but they may have a story 
for their especial benefit once a week. This will give 
them time to talk about it, think about it, digest it 
and be ready for the next. ach story should have one 
main point and only one, so that the mind will not be 
overtaxed in grasping and remembering it. Every item 
told should contribute to this main point, so that even 
if the details are forgotten, the principal thought will 
remain.
-P-A-G-E-159
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 165 
The First Story.—Suppose, for example, we wish to 
begin with Columbus and the discovery of America,— 
it may run something like this: “To-day I will tell you 
a story of ‘A Very Active Boy.’ His parents named 
him Christopher. He was born in a city by the sea, 
where there were many ships and boats. When just 
a little fellow, he played on the beach watching the 
waves come and go and gathering shells as they were 
washed up. He loved to watch the great ships come to 
the landing, like graceful birds with white wings, and 
see the passengers land and greet their friends. But 
better he liked to hear the shouts of the sailors and 
watch them at the work of lading and unlading the big 
vessels. He thought it was a jolly life and when he was 
a man he would be a sailor. 
“He enjoyed seeing the fishing boats come in, their 
sides well down in the water with the weight of shining 
fish. Sometimes huge war vessels came and went. He 
would see the officers with their glittering swords, and 
the soldiers in their bright uniforms drilling and march- 
ing to the strains of music, and then he would want to 
be a soldier. Or he would see a merchant ship unload- 
ing its cargo of teas and spices and fabrics from other 
lands. He loved to listen to the sailors spinning yarns 
of adventure by sea and land, and telling strange tales 
of other peoples and other countries. All these things 
made him love the sea and filled him with a desire to 
- be a great man and do wonderful things. 
“ He early learned to swim, to row and to sail a boat. 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  106 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
His active life made him strong and healthy and fear- 
less. Sometimes he would teach younger boys how to 
swim, and if one ventured too far and was in danger 
of drowning, he would plunge into the waves and bring 
him to the shore. From all that he did and heard and 
saw, he learned many valuable lessons that proved of 
great help to him in after years. 
“His schooling was not neglected. He learned to 
read and write and solve hard problems in arithmetic. 
But best he liked geography and history. The geogra- 
phy told of other lands and seas, and the history de- 
scribed the deeds of great men. In these ways he grew 
to be a strong and well-informed young man. Next 
week I will tell you more about him.” 
The Second Story.—The subject of the next story may 
be ‘Christopher as a Sailor.’’ If by this time the chil- 
dren want to know the name of the city where he was 
born, it may be given them with a map or picture, 
showing that it was the ‘Gateway to Italy.” Proceed- 
ing with the story, tell how young Columbus (they will 
have his full name by this time), at the age of fourteen 
became a sailor, and kept up his studies of astronomy, 
geometry and philosophy, everything that could im- 
prove his mind and help in his chosen profession; how 
between voyages he made maps and charts and sold 
them to help defray his expenses, for he was poor. 
Tell them how his studies led him to believe he could 
go to Asia by sailing to the westward, more quickly 
and easily than by the caravan route that was so long
-P-A-G-E-161
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 1607 
and wearisome; how people laughed at him for his pe- 
culiar notions in believing the world was round and 
that he could find Asia by sailing to the westward and 
how the Atlantic ocean was considered a boiling flood 
dangerous to navigate. 
The Third Story—The third subject may be ‘Co- 
lumbus tells his Story to the King and Queen of Portu- 
gal.”’ Dwell upon his struggles and perseverance and 
picture the scene when the Queen pledged her jewels 
to pay the expenses of the voyages, and the difficulties 
of getting men and ships for so perilous an undertak- 
ing. Let this lesson close with all preparation com- 
plete, the crowds on the shore, the farewells, and the 
partings. 
The above is sufficient to indicate the method of 
starting the little ones in the great subject of History. 
If it is followed faithfully, it will be a delight to both 
teacher and pupils and will never lose its fascination. 
The reason the study is disliked by so many is because 
they are given nothing but the dry bones of history, 
memorizing facts, names and dates until they are men- 
tally choked. No wonder they rebel. Let it be put in 
appetizing form and given in proper portions, and it is 
certain to be relished. 
Use of a Primary History——When children are ready 
for the fourth reader, they may be supplied with a 
primary history. From this they should both read 
and recite in the class. Questioning may precede the 
reading, in order to ascertain how well the lesson has
-P-A-G-E-162
    168 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
been studied and whether difficult parts are understood. 
As each paragraph is read, the main thought should 
be called for and emphasized. Pictures and maps 
should never be overlooked, each contains something 
helpful to the understanding of the narrative. Side 
lights from books and pictures should be brought to 
class by both teacher and pupils. In these ways the 
danger of flagging interest will be avoided. 
Influence of the Study Upon Character.—The most prac- 
tical thing about history is its influence upon the char- 
acters and lives of those who study it. By becoming 
familiar with the lives of the men who have been 
chiefly instrumental in making our country what it is, 
we learn to emulate their virtues and avoid their mis- 
takes. Much depends upon the teacher as to how the 
children will look upon men and deeds. If he lauds 
military heroes above others, they will look upon them 
as the really great ones, while the achievements of the 
peaceful will be less regarded. It is easy to fire the 
imaginations of children, especially of boys, with tales of 
war and to lead them to overestimate its importance. 
Fortunately, most of our wars have been for princi- 
ple and not for conquest; consequently there is less 
danger in their recital. Our military heroes, likewise, 
have been for the most part not soldiers by profession, 
but, chosen from the ranks of peace, they became war- 
riors by necessity. Washington was a lover of peace, 
greater as a citizen than as a soldier, more zealous for 
his country’s welfare than for his own aggrandizement.
-P-A-G-E-163
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 169 
Grant, though educated at a military academy, was a 
peaceful citizen at Galena, Illinois, when called to take 
part in the great conflict of the Civil war. He became 
the greatest general in that war,. but when it was over 
and he was elected to the presidency, his motto was 
“Let us have peace.” 
Until recently too much space was given in the text- 
books to wars and battles, and they received undue at- 
tention in the schools. The present tendency to give 
them less prominence is to be commended. 
Results to Be Accomplished.—The study of history 
through the course should accomplish practical results 
in at least four important particulars. 
(2) Pupils should learn that the really great men of 
a nation are those who sacrifice personal interest for 
the good of the country; that those who secure office 
for gain or for self-aggrandizement are not great, but 
the reverse; that a patriot is one who seeks to pro- 
mote righteousness, peace and prosperity; that the of- 
fice-seeker, the grafter and the demagogue are not to 
be trusted nor honored; that many of our greatest 
benefactors never sought preferment nor held office; 
that every peaceful, law-abiding, industrious citizen is 
an honor and a blessing to his country. 
(2) They should acquire a knowledge of our institu- 
tions, how they came into being, their cost and means of 
support and the benefits they render. All the ma- 
chinery of government from the presidency down to the 
smallest country post office is for the comfort and con-

  170 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
venience of the people, to promote the onward march 
of civilization. All our public institutions, the army 
and navy, penitentiaries, asylums, hospitals, schools, 
highways and parks, are for the physical, mental and 
moral well-being of the entire population. 
These institutions did not come by chance and are 
not to be taken for granted. They represent the wis- 
dom and labor and sacrifice of many generations. 
Those who established them did it not for their own 
nor for our good alone, but for all future generations, 
and it is our duty to hand them down to our succes- 
sors in better condition than we found them. To this 
end it is the duty of every citizen to uphold, support 
and defend them. It has been well said that public 
office is a public trust; that those whom we elect to of- 
fice are our servants, and of them we have a right to ex- 
pect faithfulness, industry and economy. 
(3) Students of history should be thoroughly im- 
pressed with the idea that it is the patriotic duty of 
every man to make the best possible use of the means 
provided by the government for the upbuilding of the 
national character. ‘To this end schools have been 
provided that every child may have an education that 
will fit him for citizenship. It is the nation’s choicest 
safeguard, and to neglect this sacred duty is unpatri- 
otic and wrong. Education is the country’s gift to the 
child and to deprive him of it is to sin against the na- 
tion and against the child. ‘They should be taught fur- 
ther that it is the duty of every citizen to be obedient to

the laws, to contribute to the roads and other public 
improvements, to pay his rightful proportion of the 
public taxes, and to render cheerfully every service his 
country may require. 
(4) It should be shown that true patriotism consists 
in being as well as in doing. If one truly loves his 
country, he will try to be the kind of person the nation 
delights in. The silent influence of a righteous life is 
infinitely greater than any amount of empty boasting. 
Character is as essential to the nation as service, and 
each individual must contribute his share.

MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL—Continued 
5. ARITHMETIC 
From the days of our fathers till the present, arith- 
metic has been the great study of the district school. 
More time, thought and attention has been given to 
it than to any other branch. It has been considered 
the most practical and the most important branch, be- 
cause business cannot be carried on without it. It is 
necessary to all computations. 
Why It Is a “ Bugbear.””—Yet despite the attention it 
has received, it is responsible for the majority of fail- 
ures in examinations and is the bugbear of a multi- 
tude of young people who aspire to teach, and who 
wouldn’t mind the examination if it were not for arith- 
metic. So many have been the heart-breakings, that a 
great question has arisen for the consideration of teach- 
ers’ associations and institutes, viz., ‘‘ What is the mat- 
ter with arithmetic?” It is not difficult to find enough 
that’ is the matter, but the remedy is not so easily dis- 
covered. The trouble originated, in part, from the 
love of the old-time schoolmaster for solving difficult 
problems and thus proving the superiority of his at- 
172 ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 173 
tainments; from the early text-books that were made 
for mature minds and were filled with hard problems 
and puzzles to show the ingenuity of the authors; from 
putting these books into the hands of children whose 
minds were not sufficiently developed to grasp their 
intricacies, thus subjecting them to discouragement in 
the beginning; from cramming their minds with a mass 
of rules and definitions before inducting them into the 
processes that would make principles, rules and defi- 
nitions plain and easy; from expecting ripe scholars in 
arithmetic, when other branches just as important have 
scarcely been touched. 
What to Teach and How to Teach It.—It is not the in- 
tention of this work to argue against arithmetic. It is 
agreed that it is important and deserves its full meed 
of time and attention. It is rather a question of what 
to teach and how to teach it,—whether to confine our 
efforts to the practical, for the sake of business later 
in life, or to use such exercises as will cultivate the 
mental powers without much reference to their prac- 
ticability. Will not a mind that is trained to proceed 
from the known to the unknown, to reason from cause 
to effect, to go from step to step in logical order be 
able to grasp the details of the practical problems of 
life, even if it has not met them all in its training? 
No reasonable person can doubt it. 
Moreover, the great majority of problems in the busi- 
ness world are not arithmetical. They are not such as 
are found in books with the answers set down. The  
-P-A-G-E-168
  174 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
practical problems in arithmetic will not teach the 
farmer anything about rotation of crops, or when to 
plant corn, or what breed of sheep will yield the most 
profit. They will not show the merchant where to 
buy his goods, how to be polite to his customers, nor 
inform him as to the best selling articles. ‘These are 
samples of the “practical problems” met with in life 
and which require a trained mind for their solution. 
Is it not evident, then, that practical arithmetic 
should have for its object the cultivation of the mental 
powers rather than skill in computing the cost of so 
many bushels, yards or pounds at so much per item? 
If the problems in computation are as good as any 
for training the mind, by all means use them—but 
let that be the test. 
Two Objects to Be Obtained.—Among the objects to 
be attained in the study of arithmetic are two that 
need attention. The first in point of time is skill in 
handling numbers and in setting down figures. For 
the sake of economizing time all through life, every 
child should be taught to compute rapidly and accu- 
rately. This, together with neatness, should be taught 
in the early years of school life, the secret of success 
being intelligent and enthusiastic practice. Hard prob- 
lems are not only not necessary, they are a positive 
detriment to progress. When rapidity, accuracy and 
neatness are the objects sought, no other stimulus is 
necessary. To make good progress is success, and 
success is a sufficient reward for hard labor.
-P-A-G-E-169
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 175 
But it must be remembered that skill, while first in 
point of time, is not the main object. The second and 
main object is the cultivation of the mental powers. 
Skill is only a means to this end and to the economy 
of time and effort through life. 
The Faculty of Observation.—One of the most valu- 
able powers of the mind is that of observation, and 
this faculty should receive attention from the outset. 
Much of the work in arithmetic does not require rea- 
soning, but observation. Addition, subtraction, multi- 
plication, division, tables and computations are evi- 
dence of this. That two and two make four is not 
the result of thought nor reason, but is merely to be 
observed. You observe that if you have three apples 
and eat one, you have two left; if you divide ten pears 
among five boys, each one gets two, etc. 
The Reasoning Process.—A considerable amount of 
work should call for thought, but not too complicated 
for young minds. Abundance and variety of material, 
rather than mental strain, should be the watchword. 
Show pupils how to go from the known to the un- 
known. For example,—One pound of nails costs three 
cents; that is the known. What will three pounds cost? 
That is the unknown. Starting with the known, we 
say, if one pound costs three cents, three pounds will 
cost three times as much, which is nine cents. The 
reasoning in this consists in seeing that the relation 
that exists between the price and the amount in the 
known must be the same in the unknown, and of fol- 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  176 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
lowing this relationship through the arithmetical proc- 
ess to the conclusion. 
A great number of such simple problems should be 
given beginners, until the process of reasoning is fixed; 
then make the work more complicated by adding some 
new factor as,—if three cakes of soap cost fifteen cents, 
what will five cakes cost? Here we go from the known 
to the unknown, but we cannot go directly to the con- 
clusion; we must make an intermediate step. From 
knowing what three cakes cost, we first find what one 
costs,—then we may proceed along the well-known path 
of reasoning from one to any number. If the first is 
well understood before undertaking the second and 
each one thereafter thoroughly learned, there will never 
be any trouble. A student can readily learn to go 
through the most difficult mazes of reasoning if he is 
required to learn only one new step at a time, and is 
given a sufficient number of problems for illustration 
and practice. 
Impractical Problems.—A considerable number of the 
subjects in the old arithmetics are neither practical 
nor cultural. Such topics as Duodecimals, Alligation 
Medial, True and Bank Discount, Cube Root, and 
miscellaneous problems that are too difficult for most 
mature minds are, to say the least, of doubtful use in 
the district school. If they have a place, it is in the 
higher schools. Pupils would much better employ 
their time in literature, rhetoric, composition, letter 
writing and business forms, all of which will be useful
-P-A-G-E-171
        
   
                                
      
       MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 177 
every day of their lives. Many teachers know this, 
but are afraid to adopt it in their teaching. When one 
is satisfied that a certain course is right, he should 
stand for it and follow it, but be tactful in so doing. 
The city schools all over the land have done much 
in the past few years toward abolishing the errors of 
teaching arithmetic by omitting such subjects as those 
indicated above, or by relegating them to the high 
school. The wrong and frequently cruel practice of 
subjecting young minds to problems far beyond their 
years is no longer tolerated. 
If the country teacher cannot abolish the evils that 
are obvious, he can at least advocate reform wherever 
opportunity offers and be ready to join forces with any 
movement whose object is for the betterment of the 
schools.

        As a Study of Ourselves——There is a great fund of 
useful information in this subject that is suitable for 
children. They should begin with the body as a whole. 
It may be studied as the home of the mind and soul. 
My body is not myself, it is my home and my servant. 
By it I live in this world and through it I carry out the 
wishes of my mind. If I care for it properly, it will 
give me comfort and happiness and long life. If I 
neglect or abuse it, sickness, pain and death will re- 
sult. The body is a most complicated and delicate 
Dist. School—12
-P-A-G-E-172
  178 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
structure that requires knowledge, wisdom and skill 
for its proper care. Many, if not most, of the acci- 
dents, diseases and deaths are the results of ignorance 
and carelessness. A study of ourselves is therefore the 
most essential of all studies. 
The Structure of the Body.—We may next notice that 
the body, though one connected whole, consists of 
parts, as head, trunk and limbs. Each part is com- 
posed somewhat differently from the others and has its 
particular uses. In general, the body is made of flesh 
and bones. It is covered with skin, hair and nails, 
which are for protection, comfort and beauty. The 
bony structure is called the skeleton. It has many parts 
joined together so that we may move easily in many 
different ways. All of the bones have names, a few of 
which may be given. Afterward the names may be 
supplied as they are needed. The flesh is composed of 
muscle and many other kinds of material, all of which 
are called tissue. Each kind has its use and a name 
to distinguish it from the rest. 
How the Body Is Kept Alive-—The body is kept alive 
by the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we 
breathe. Just as a tree, in addition to soil, requires air, 
rain and sunshine to cause it to grow and to keep it 
alive, so do we and so do all other animals and plants. 
In this respect we are closely related to all living things. 
We differ from the plants in many ways; one is, we 
can move about from place to place and need much 
exercise to keep us healthy. The plant cannot move
-P-A-G-E-173
MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 179 
from place to place, but gets its exercise from the winds 
which make it strong. 
Not everything that can be eaten is good for food. 
Some things are poisonous and would kill us if we ate 
them. Others are injurious and when taken into the 
stomach make us sick. By this means, we learn to 
avoid injurious and dangerous things. Neither is one 
kind of food sufficient for our use. Different parts of 
the body need different kinds of food. Nature sup- 
plies us bountifully with a great variety, so that we 
need never lack, provided we will do our part in as- 
sisting nature to produce it. 
Digestion and Circulation.—We are now face to face 
with the subject of digestion and the organs concerned 
therein. This will lead us to the blood and its circula- 
tion. While studying the circulation of the blood, we 
shall observe its use of oxygen and this will bring us 
to the lungs and the process of breathing. We shall 
in the most natural way be called upon to consider the 
necessity of pure air, pure water and pure food; of care, 
of exercise and of temperance in all things. 
Advantages of this Method.—By this method of pro- 
cedure, there is no overtaxing the memory, no cram- 
ming the mind with meaningless names and defini- 
tions. Every item of information is furnished with 
its immediate need. The whole subject is so full of 
interest, so closely connected with the lives of the 
children, that each new bit of knowledge calls for more. 
Learning under such conditions is not a task, but a 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  180 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
  pleasure. The mind once started so happily will take 
added delight with each increase of knowledge, and 
will of itself seek and discover new fields for pleasure 
and profit. 
Comparative Physiology.—The children should be en- 
couraged in the study of comparative physiology. 
They, as well as the teacher, will find it a fascinating 
subject. Let them bring in specimens of plants and 
animals and observe their structure. How admirably 
each is adapted to its mode of life! Animals that climb, 
have clavicles; those that use their front limbs for walk- 
ing or running only, as the horse or cow, have no clavi- 
cles; birds, because of the constant use of their wings, 
have a double clavicle and strong breast muscles; the 
rabbit’s eyes are so situated that it can see on every 
side and upward, without moving, and thus.escape men 
and owls, for the slightest movement might discover its 
whereabouts. ‘These are single examples out of hun- 
dreds that might be mentioned. 
Teachers should not be afraid to go outside the 
leaves of the text-book and meet their subject in its 
natural state. Nature is a greater book than any that 
has yet been printed. It can be read by any one that 
is willing to commence at the beginning and inquire 
patiently and lovingly into its meaning. ‘That it is 
interesting and profit-yielding is beyond question. The 
essential thing is not to undertake tasks that are too 
difficult. There is plenty that is within our grasp, if 
we will but look for it.
-P-A-G-E-175
  MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 181 
Notice, for example, how much like ourselves are the 
animals about us. They must eat and drink and 
breathe; they have their sleeping and waking time; 
they are sensitive to heat and cold, to comfort and dis- 
comfort; they are subject to disease and pain and 
accidents; they have their family ties, affections, friend- 
ships, acquaintances; they have joys and fears, friends 
and enemies; they must suffer, endure and sacrifice; 
they seem to know that death awaits them and seek 
to avoid it as long as possible. When we observe 
these and many other resemblances, we are forced to 
admit that man is ‘‘brother to the ox.” 
This knowledge cannot fail to awaken kindly feel- 
ing toward all living creatures. Instead of torturing 
them, the children will become the protectors of birds 
and animals. They will find that they can derive more 
pleasure from studying a bird or beast than by taking 
its life. Moreover, when they have formed the ac- 
quaintance of the real things, the descriptions and 
pictures in books will have a charm never before 
dreamed of. They will have a basis for comparing 
the information in the book with their own observa- 
tions and experiences, and will gradually learn that 
what they see and know is as valuable as what others 
see and know, even though the others may be the 
writers of books. 
Bad Habits, Causes of Disease——When interest has 
thus been aroused, it will be an easy matter at any 
time to turn the attention of the pupils upon them-
-P-A-G-E-176
  182 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
selves. Let them study the causes of diseases and 
how to avoid them; how to care for their bodies in 
health and in sickness; the importance of cleanliness of 
person and of surroundings. They should find out by 
their own investigations that the use of tobacco is in- 
jurious to the body; that it is a filthy habit and a profit- 
less expense. That tobacco is particularly injurious 
to boys can be proven from the records of the United 
States Army. These show that from fifty to ninety 
per cent of the applicants who are victims of the cigar- 
ette habit, fail to pass the physical examination. They 
have been robbed of their vigor. Weak hearts, low 
vitality, shattered nerves is the pronouncement of their 
country as reasons for rejecting their services. What a 
comment upon the young manhood of our land! What 
may we expect if these physical wrecks are to be the 
fathers of the next generation ? 
Many of the large schools of the cities have kept 
tab on the progress made by the users and non-users 
of tobacco, with the results always in favor of the 
Jatter. With a little pains these records can be ob- 
tained and placed in the hands of the students. This 
information should come before the tobacco habit is 
acquired, as it is much easier to refrain than to break 
off. 
In a similar manner pupils should be led to consider 
the physical, mental and moral effects of the drinking 
habit. There is an abundance of material on every 
hand. The only thing necessary is to induce the
-P-A-G-E-177
  MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 183 
pupils to give it a fair and impartial study. Teachers 
too often approach the subject with railings and con- 
demnations that are more likely than not to arouse 
opposition. It is better to place the evidence before 
them and allow them to draw their own conclusions. 
If they wish to know the teacher’s opinion, it should 
be given without prejudice or rancor. It is always 
better to have a person arrive at a right conclusion by 
his own thinking, than to have it thrust upon him by 
another. 
One of the greatest influences in favor of temper- 
ance to-day is the attitude of the business world. 
Hundreds of firms, and the number is constantly in- 
creasing, will not employ a man who drinks. It has 
been demonstrated over and over again that a person 
who drinks is not as reliable as one who does not. The 
railroads are growing more and more strict as to the 
habits of their employees. A conductor who is bloated 
and blear-eyed and whose breath suggests the dram 
shop, will not be endured by the traveling public. 
The engineer or brakeman whose brains are befuddled 
with whisky cannot be intrusted with the lives of pas- 
sengers. Even freight train crews must be sober to 
avoid the danger: of wrecks with loss of life and 
property and damage suits. 
The Men that Succeed.—There is a great and in- 
creasing demand everywhere for sober and industrious 
young men who are trained for service. It is true that 
employers when greatly in need of help do sometimes 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  184, TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
engage persons of doubtful character, but such are 
seldom promoted or placed in positions of trust and 
are the first to be dropped when the rush is over. The 
steady, upright, honest men occupy the best paying 
and most desirable positions, while the drinking, smok- 
ing, gambling fellows go from place to place, doing 
odd jobs in rush times when employers must take 
what they can get. 
It is well known that the teachers of the land are the 
trainers of the young. The business world has its eye 
upon the schools: Choice young men’ and young 
women are spoken for before they are through with 
their education. It has been discovered that the school 
is the best place in the world not only for training the 
mind, but for acquiring habits of industry and ideas 
of right. 
These matters should be placed before the pupils 
and form a large part of their entire training, so that 
they will see the necessity of industry and right living. 
7. SPELLING AND WRITING 
These branches, while not contributing largely to 
one’s education, are nevertheless important. It is no 
praise to spell well and write neatly and legibly, but 
it is a serious condemnation not to be able to do so. 
The reason is that skill in these branches is essential 
to further education and to the transaction of business, 
and it is expected that they will be undertaken early
-P-A-G-E-179
  MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 185 
and persevered in until proficiency is attained. A few 
words about each will suffice. 
Avoiding Unnecessary Labor—To spell badly, we fre- 
quently hear it said, is a disgrace. Yet that many bad 
spellers come from the schools must be admitted. As 
a rule, the fault is not that too little time is devoted to 
it, but that too much is wasted in unnecessary labor. 
In assigning a lesson, the teacher takes no pains to 
ascertain how many of the words the pupils can spell 
and how many they cannot. ‘They are told simply to 
take the next lesson or to take so many words. It 
usually happens that some of the pupils can spell 
every word in the lesson when it is assigned, others 
can spell all but a few. Now, to con over words that 
they are already familiar with, is time wasted. Evi- 
dently they should give attention only to those that 
they cannot spell. 
A better way is to pronounce all the doubtful words, 
letting the class write them. Then glance over the lists 
and assign to each one the words he has missed. At 
the next recitation pronounce these words, each pupil 
writing them in his spelling tablet. Look over them 
again and mark out any that are wrong. Have these 
written correctly in a separate place under the title, 
“Unlearned Words.” ‘These constitute a part of each 
succeeding lesson until they are thoroughly learned, 
when they may be crossed out. 
A teacher should know in a few weeks about what 
words each pupil can spell and excuse him from put- 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  186 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
ting time upon those words. This will be an encour- 
agement to industry and thoroughness. 
Sharpness of Vision.—Every person wants to be a 
good speller, but some find it very difficult to learn. 
The reason is, they are not quick to detect differences 
in form. A person who cannot learn to spell would 
not likely recognize faces readily, nor be able to detect 
the difference in quality between good and bad cloth. 
He will scarcely know one shade of color from another 
and will be liable to many inaccuracies. 
Such a person should be drilled in noticing minute 
particulars. A study of flowers and plants, with refer- 
ence to the shape, size and color of leaves, petals and 
roots would be exceedingly helpful. When he has 
attained some proficiency in sharpness of vision, turn 
his attention to words. Select fifty pairs of words that 
differ only in a single letter, as rain and rein, seize and 
seige; or such words as receive and believe, receipt and 
deceit, etc. Let him take but a single glance at these 
words and then tell the difference. As soon as his 
interest is aroused, he will take pleasure in making 
headway and his new found power will be beneficial 
in many ways besides spelling. 
The Meaning and Use of Words should go hand in 
hand with the spelling. It is of little benefit to know 
the spelling of a word, if we do not know how to use 
it. Some argue that children should learn to spell 
words against the time when they shall have learned 
their meaning and need to use them. The idea is of 
1
-P-A-G-E-181
   MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 187 
doubtful utility. Many people of middle age do not 
know how to spell words because they learned them in 
childhood. A few may be remembered because of 
some special association, but not many. We know 
how to spell.a word because we are familiar with its 
form, its appearance, just as we know the faces of our 
friends. 
Indeed, the best way to learn to spell is by picturing 
the words in the mind, visualizing them, as it is called. 
We must be able to do this before we can read easily. 
We must know a word as a wheelwright knows a 
wagon, not by its parts, but as a whole. If any part is 
missing or wrongly placed, we should notice the defect 
and be able to remedy it. 
The Card System.—This is a great help in teaching 
children to recognize words quickly. A large number 
of pasteboard cards, about four by six inches, is pro- 
vided. A single word is written in large letters on each 
one. The teacher, holding a bunch of these in his 
hand, turns one in view of the class and immediately 
replaces it. The children call the word, or, failing to 
do so, must have another glance. The next card is 
exposed in a similar way and so on. If one child is 
slower than the others, he must have particular atten- 
tion until he learns to recognize the words quickly. 
This is not only an effective but a very interesting 
way to the children. Many reading lessons should be 
made of the words on the cards. 
Intelligent Practice in Penmanship—tIn penmanship 
‘
-P-A-G-E-182
188 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
every one should acquire legibility, rapidity and a pleas- 
ing style. The one necessity is intelligent practice. 
Every pupil from the third reader class up should be 
provided with a copybook, pens and ink. There are 
some schoolhouses not yet supplied with desks, and the 
teacher is at a loss to know how to teach writing in 
such a case. A wide board with a smooth surface, 
placed on trestles, will answer very well. ‘Two or three 
of these at different heights will accommodate both 
large and small pupils. 
It is better to have two lessons a aveek of forty-five 
or fifty minutes each, than to have twenty minutes 
each day; at least, the author has found it so in his 
own experience. ‘The first twenty minutes may be 
given to general practice from models on the board. 
These should consist of circles and easy combinations 
with flowing lines. This enables the pupils to acquire 
a free and easy motion. A separate sheet of paper 
should be used. 
Before beginning, the teacher should see that all are 
seated properly, feet on the floor, shoulders straight, 
right arm on the desk, paper and pen in position. The 
models should be put on the board one at a time as they 
are used, and each one erased when the next is written, 
the class working in unison. The teacher gives direc- 
tions and keeps constant watch to see that they are 
followed. 
At the end of the practice, copy books are taken and 
each one proceeds at the proper place in his own book.
-P-A-G-E-183
  MAKING THE WORK PRACTICAL 189 
The teacher keeps watch as before, giving general and 
individual guidance as needed. When the time is up, 
let the pens be cleaned and all materials put away 
carefully, to remain until the next lesson. 
The Three Essentials——It will be an encouragement 
to effort, if the teacher will call attention to the progress 
made from day to day and from week to week. Re- 
mind them that progress should consist in the three 
essentials, accuracy, rapidity and style, that is, neat- 
ness and beauty. If any are very slow to advance, 
ascertain the cause, if possible, and remove it, but con- 
tinue to give encouragement. Scolding or fault-finding 
is small inducement to effort. If it should happen that 
laziness or rebellion exists, a little sternness may avail 
to overcome it, but as a rule a kindly interest is better 
than severity. 
If any prizes or rewards are offered, they should go 
not to the best writers, but to those who have made 
the greatest progress. This gives every one an oppor- 
tunity to strive with an equal show of winning.
-P-A-G-E-184
  CHAPTER IX 
TALKS ON THE INDUSTRIES 
Children in remote country districts have very little 
idea of the great workaday world. What they see 
around them is all they really know. What they hear 
is usually scrappy and one-sided. The information 
gathered from the geography, from the descriptions 
and the pictures, is vague and far away. Unless some 
kind friend like the teacher takes them into confidence 
and explains many things, they will have but little 
upon which to form ideals. If they could have a fairly 
accurate idea of a considerable number of the occupa- 
tions, they would be the richer when it comes to choos- 
ing for themselves. Even in the towns and cities 
children have an inadequate idea of the various call- 
ings and occupations of mankind. 
A series of carefully prepared talks by the teacher 
on the chief industries could not fail to be valuable. 
They could perhaps be arranged most fittingly in the 
geography lessons, or they could be made general, 
occupying ten or twenty minutes once a week. Such 
instructions could be adapted to the undertanding of 
the students and be made eminently practical, more 
so than much of the knowledge in the books. It is 
190 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
          TALKS ON THE INDUSTRIES 191 
the purpose of this chapter to outline briefly such a 
series of talks. 
I. FARMING 
What It Means to Be a Farmer.—Since we are to start 
with the known and proceed to the unknown, we may 
ask the children what occupation they would choose to 
follow. They will name various ones, farming, car- 
pentry, blacksmithing, teaching, while a few may want 
to be lawyers, physicians, preachers. The teacher may 
remark that these are all excellent occupations, worthy 
of the best talents in the world. Suppose we talk about 
each one in turn. “ John, why do you choose the life 
of a farmer?” John replies, “ Because it is an inde- 
pendent life, is healthful, and keeps a person in the 
open air.” The next question may be, “ How would 
you learn farming? What preparation would you 
need?” Most boys will say, “Why, you don’t need 
any preparation, you just get some land and go to farm- 
ing.” 
This is the teacher’s opportunity to give instruction. 
He may explain that the notion that farming requires 
no preparation is very common, but that it is wrong. 
There is no occupation in the world that offers a finer 
field for scholarly minds. There is something to be 
learned at every turn, and it is interesting. The farmer 
deals with life, and life is always interesting. He must 
have a knowledge not only of plants and domestic 
animals, but of bugs and worms and weeds.
-P-A-G-E-186
  192 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Education an Aid to Agriculture—Some years ago in 
Kansas there was a small bug, called the “‘chinch bug,” 
that destroyed vast fields of growing wheat. The stalks 
of wheat would be covered with these little dark bugs. 
They were in such quantities that there was no known 
way of destroying them. It meant a loss of millions of 
bushels of wheat to the farmers of Kansas in a single 
year. 
A great scholar in the state university undertook to 
discover a remedy. He worked for ten years at it, and 
. finally succeeded. The remedy was a very simple one, 
though it took a long time to discover it. The bugs 
could be infected with a disease that spread rapidly 
and was extremely fatal. When this became known, 
the farmers sent in boxes of healthy bugs, had them 
exposed to the disease and returned. They were put 
back in the field and in a few days all the bugs con- 
tracted the disease and died. Thus millions of dollars 
were saved to the farmers and millions of bushels of 
wheat to the world, because of the patient efforts of a 
scholar. This is but a single instance of what educa- 
tion is doing for the farm. 
State Agricultural Colleges.—Most of the states have 
established great schools called Agricultural Colleges’ 
for the purpose of training young men and young 
women for farm life, and also to furnish better ad- 
vantages for the study of farm problems. 
These colleges require a fair knowledge of the com- 
mon branches of learning and carry on regular courses 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  TALKS ON THE INDUSTRIES 193 
of study. They teach stock-raising, fruit-raising, but- 
ter- and cheese-making, and study soils, grains, vege- 
tables and many other things pertaining to the cultiva- 
tion of the ground. 
School Gardens.—In some states many of the dis- 
tricts have a plot of ground in connection with the 
schoolyard, where the children are taught interesting 
and useful lessons in agriculture. Each pupil has a 
space to himself where he may raise such grains, roots, 
berries or melons as he likes. An exhibition is given 
at the end of the term and the children show what they 
have produced and what they have learned. All this 
adds greatly to the interest of the school, the advance- 
ment of the pupils and to the knowledge of the world. 
The legislatures of the states are taking up the sub- 
ject, and we may look for the rapid spread of this kind 
of work in the schools. 
Every Farmer Must Be a Student.—A farmer can no 
longer afford to be ignorant. Ignorance is costly in any 
line of industry, but particularly so in farming. There 
are constant improvements in tools and in ways of 
planting, cultivating and reaping. The intelligent 
farmer must have his own journals to know what is 
going on in the world and to keep abreast of the times. 
He must read the papers:to learn of wars and famines, 
of devastation by fire and flood, of ‘‘bumper” crops 
in other parts, so that he may judge ahead of demands 
and prices. He must know of diseases of cattle, horses, 
sheep and hogs and the most successful way of treat- 
Dist. School—13
-P-A-G-E-188
  194 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
ing or avoiding them; of scourges of grasshoppers, 
locusts, worms and noxious weeds and the best means 
of destroying them. He uses the telephone and the 
telegraph and the mails for buying and selling and for 
keeping himself informed as to prices. 
In return for his study and work, the farmer leads 
a delightful life, full of variety and interest. His extra 
intelligence gives him a fine bank account for the 
education of his children and for his own comfort in 
old age. There is much true science in farming, and 
the schools are sending out an ever increasing number 
of trained men and women who know how to make 
it both pleasant and profitable. I a young man chooses 
to be a farmer, he cannot afford to miss an education. 
The cheapest and shortest road to success is through 
the schools. If he remains ignorant, he will be left far 
behind in the race. 
2. TRADES 
It is a good thing to have a trade, whether we follow 
it through life or not. A wise man said, “He that 
hath a trade hath a fortune.” Many of the greatest 
men of the world have céme from the shop, the bench, 
or the farm. David was a shepherd, Benjamin Frank- 
lin was a candle-maker, Ben Johnson was a brick- 
layer, Elihu Burritt was a shoemaker, Grant was a 
tanner, Burns was a plow boy, Jesus was a carpenter. 
The man who has learned a trade has acquired two 
great essentials to success, industry and skill.
-P-A-G-E-189
  
TALKS ON THE INDUSTRIES 195 
Preparing to Be a Carpenter.—In choosing occupa- 
tions, Charles selected carpentry. Why? He wants 
to be a builder, to construct houses and bridges and 
business blocks. It is a noble ambition. Solomon’s 
greatest achievement was the building of the Temple; 
Julius Cesar constructed a bridge across the Rhine 
that was the wonder of the age; a young man, nineteen 
years of age, undertook the completion of the Brooklyn 
Bridge, and succeeded. 
What preparation will Charles need before he can be 
a carpenter? ‘That depends upon how high his am- 
bition soars. If he cares to be only an ordinary work- 
man, employed by some one else and earning two or 
three dollars a day, he will not need so much educa- 
tion. He may put himself under a carpenter doing the 
roughest and heaviest work, and gradually increase in 
skill until at the end of six or seven years he has at- 
tained to the height of his ambition,—he is a carpenter. 
But if he wishes to be a master mechanic, to take 
contracts, to plan, outline and erect great buildings; 
to see and to draw so that others may see all the details 
before a stroke has been made, he will need the educa- 
tion and discipline that can be most easily and quickly 
acquired in the schools. 
Trade Schools.—As there are agricultural colleges, so 
there are schools where trades are taught. In the olden 
days, if a boy wanted to be a carpenter or a black- 
smith, he was entered as an apprentice to some work- 
man who could profit by his services while teaching him
-P-A-G-E-190
  196 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
the trade. It was a long and tedious process and 
usually resulted in an imperfect, one-sided training. 
Law and medicine were studied in the same way, in 
the office of an attorney or physician. But now there 
are schools for all these things, law, medicine, car- 
pentry and even blacksmithing. Some still prefer the 
old way, but it is very expensive, requiring more time 
and furnishing less skill. 
To enter a course in carpentry, about the same 
preparation is required as for the course in farming. 
The applicant should be well versed in the common 
branches, with some extra knowledge in arithmetic. 
Algebra and geometry also will be very helpful. In 
fact, the better his education, the more rapidly he will 
advance and the higher he will be able to climb. 
The student is taught to sharpen tools, to use them, 
to draw plans and work them out, and a hundred de- 
tails that the apprentice never dreamed of. Three 
years under skilled teachers will furnish a better equip- 
ment than seven years of the old way. 
Blacksmithing is much the same. A man may shoe 
horses, sharpen plows and mend tires without much 
schooling. But work in iron and steel is becoming 
more and more important and now fills a large place 
in mechanical industry. There is but little chance for 
excellency or promotion for the young man who is 
ignorant. The trained mind is wanted everywhere, 
while ignorance goes a begging and takes the poorest 
jobs.

3. THE PROFESSIONS 
The leading professions are Theology, Law, Medi- 
cine and Teaching. Theology is the science of God, . 
of religion. It is so great and deep that no man can 
fathom it, but much may be learned by study. The 
Bible is the greatest revelation of God to man and is 
the principal book in the study of theology. But Nature 
and Humanity both show God’s works and his ways of 
dealing with created things, and must therefore be 
studied by those who would be our leaders and teachers 
in heavenly things. 
Theology.—If any young man desires to be a min- 
ister of the gospel, he needs the very best education 
that can be secured. Theology is too profound a sub- 
ject for an ignorant person to undertake. The funda- 
mental principles of the gospel are so simple that any 
one may understand and follow them. They are be- 
lief in God and obedience to His will. But there are 
so many things we would like to know, which we have 
not time nor opportunity to study out, that we want 
our preachers to be learned men so they can enlighten 
us. All will concede that a minister ought to know 
more about religion and the things that pertain to a 
Christian life than any one else. 
It is a blessed thing to be a preacher of the gospel; 
the best talent in the world should be devoted to it. 
There is no nobler calling that a young man may 
aspire to, unless it is teaching. It is the mission of
-P-A-G-E-192
  198 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
the preacher to proclaim the gospel of Christ to the 
world; to save mankind from sin; to be their example 
in righteous living, and to prepare them for Heaven 
and the life to come. Could any calling be more 
exalted than that? And should not a person be thor- 
oughly trained who is to devote his life to so important 
a work? The Savior of the world spent thirty years 
of his life in preparation for his three years’ ministry. 
His example should discourage young men from neg- 
lecting their education in their haste to begin preach- 
ing. 
The Legal Profession.— Law has so many attractions 
that there is seldom any scarcity of talented men in 
the profession. Still there is always room for an able 
and righteous lawyer, and young men will go on choos- 
ing the calling. It is well, therefore, that some instruc- 
tion be given the young so that they may have a right 
conception of the lawyer’s duty to his country. 
It is the duty of the lawyer to see that the laws of the 
land are obeyed; to interpret the law and transgres- 
sions thereof so that justice may be meted out to crimi- 
nals. It appears to be the business of some lawyers 
to assist criminals in avoiding justice, rather than 
otherwise. ‘There is a great temptation to criminal 
lawyers to do everything in their power to clear their 
clients, whether right or wrong, in order to build up a 
reputation of always winning their cases. This is of 
course wholly wrong. 
When an attorney takes the case of an indicted per-
-P-A-G-E-193
  TALKS ON THE INDUSTRIES 199 
son, it is his business to see that his client has all the 
rights allowed by the law and the constitution. These 
include the right to a speedy trial, to call witnesses in 
his own defense, to plead guilty or not guilty, to testify 
in his own behalf or decline to do so if he prefers, to 
see that an impartial jury is secured. 
He has no right to browbeat witnesses, to prejudice 
or bribe jurors, to secure false testimony or to go 
beyond the bounds of law. In short, it is his duty to 
see that his client has a fair and impartial trial before 
a jury of his peers and to give wise counsel in the con- 
duct of the case, so that the accused may have every 
chance that is possible and right to prove his inno- 
cence. Many lawyers have earned world-wide repu- 
tations by thus dealing honestly with their clients. 
But defending or prosecuting criminals is not the 
main part of law practice. There is much more to be 
done in adjusting claims, making collections and set- 
tling estates. Business men and firms do not want 
lawsuits. They employ an attorney to avoid that 
trouble. It is being discovered more and more that 
the Savior’s advice to his disciples is the soundest and 
best in the world: “Agree with thine adversary quickly, 
while thou art in the way with him, lest he deliver thee 
to the officer and thou be cast into prison. Verily thou 
shalt not come out thence till thou hast paid the utter- 
most farthing.” 
If a youth has an ambition to become a lawyer, give 
him high ideals. Set before him examples of men who 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  200 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
have won distinction at the bar by their strict integrity. 
A lawyer is never called upon to stultify his conscience 
by advocating anything that is wrong. The best 
chance of success lies in the path of honesty. 
Medicine is likewise an attractive and worthy profes- 
sion whose ranks are rather crowded. A first-class 
physician in a neighborhood is a power for good, 
standing next to the preacher and the teacher. There 
are many fine examples of physicians who have de- 
voted their lives to the service of the people, rather 
than to the amassing of wealth; who care for the sick, 
console the dying, and scatter health and sunshine 
everywhere. 
A wise physician knows that his business is to keep 
the neighborhood in as healthy a condition as possible; 
to give good advice about eating and drinking, sleep- 
ing and working; to see that there are no stagnant 
pools, infected wells or moldy cellars. His highest suc- 
cess is in keeping people well, rather than in curing them 
when they are sick. 
The preparation for either law or medicine is ex- 
tremely important. The teacher should always advise 
any young aspirant to take a college course before be- 
ginning to specialize. There is no danger of over 
preparing. The danger lies wholly in the opposite 
direction. Young men rush into the professions with 
little education and find to their cost that they made a 
dreadful mistake. Such errors are seldom mended. 
Men struggle on, crippled and hampered in a hundred
-P-A-G-E-195
        TALKS ON THE INDUSTRIES 201 
ways, and are always haunted by the thought of what 
might have been. In building for life, the first essen- 
tial is to lay a firm foundation. 
The Profession of Teaching.—This has been discussed, 
though not exhaustively, in the beginning of this book. 
More people are needed in this than in any of the other 
professions. The ranks are filled by two classes, those 
who adopt teaching for a life work and those who make 
it a stepping-stone to something else. It would be 
much better for the profession if everybody who entered 
it did so with the idea of permanency. That desirable 
state of things, however, does not appear to be near at 
hand. So long as teaching offers an easy and profit- 
able stepping-stone to more profitable occupations, just 
so long will it be used as such. But as President Frost 
says in his introduction, if any one takes it up in this 
way, he should try to do as good work as though he 
never expected to do anything else. 
There is no crowding in the ranks of efficient teachers. 
Every great school in the country is on the lookout 
for them. A really fine teacher may take his choice 
of many schools. There are so many more schools 
than there are well-qualified teachers, that boards can- 
not be very particular. The standard of qualifications 
is being raised as rapidly as the supply will permit. 
The schools must all be taught by somebody, and when 
the best teachers are taken, the remaining places must 
be filled by those who are not so well prepared. As a 
rule, however, the best teachers secure the most de-    
-P-A-G-E-196
  202 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
sirable schools. This is as it should be, and is an in- 
centive to every one to be thoroughly prepared. 
Some contend that the low salaries keep the more 
talented young people from entering the profession. 
There may be some truth in this, but on the other hand 
many believe that the salaries are ample, considerin® 
the ability of those engaged in the work; that the 
teachers with their present lack of education and 
training could not earn any more in other employ- 
ment. , 
However this may be, it is certainly true that the 
profession furnishes a good living for those who will 
properly prepare themselves. Salaries range all the 
way from $150 to $10,000 per year. The highest-paid 
teachers usually render better service in proportion to 
what they receive than the low-salaried ones. All 
admit that first-class service is inestimable, while a 
bungler is costly at any price. 
But aside from any salary consideration, teaching is 
a great and noble profession, worthy of the highest 
talents; and while the standard is not as high as it 
should be, it is nevertheless true that there is no finer 
body of equal numbers in the world than the great 
army of teachers that fill the ranks of our country. 
No ambitious young man or woman of scholarly tastes 
need hesitate to choose the profession for a life work. 
All such should be encouraged to go on and fit them- 
selves as thoroughly as possible with such a training 
as that suggested in the beginning of this book.
-P-A-G-E-197
  TALKS ON THE INDUSTRIES 203 
4. OTHER EMPLOYMENTS 
How to Win Promotion in Them.—There are always 
a large number who will not choose any of the above 
occupations, who must work for a living and are anx- 
‘ious to succeed. Their possibilities should be faithfully 
pointed out. They may find employment as clerks, 
bookkeepers, factory hands or as common laborers in 
public works. There is no dishonor or discredit in any 
of these: There is opportunity for promotion, useful- 
ness and happiness in all. Every one should seek that 
for which he is best fitted, and so prepare himself that 
he may attain to the highest possible success. 
The most common fault of young people is that they 
are in too great a hurry to reach high places. Success 
is often rendered impossible by overhaste. Every one 
should be conteni to begin at the foot and master the 
details as he climbs. If a boy has an ambition to be a 
merchant, his first position should be to open the 
store, to sweep and to dust. There are some things 
to learn here. He must open exactly on time and have 
everything spotlessly clean. When faithfulness and 
thoroughness in these lines have become a fixed habit, 
when he knows how a store should be kept clean and 
what it is worth to-keep it so, he has learned the first 
great lesson towards being a merchant. If it has taken 
six months or a year, it is worth it. He is now ready 
for the next step. 
His first promotion may be to that of ‘delivery boy.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  204 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
This is a responsible position. He must be quick, 
accurate and polite. The art of being pleasant and 
agreeable to customers is the next great lesson. He 
must make his employer’s interests his own and not 
stop to consider the amount of service he is rendering 
for his small pay. What he learns is more important 
than the money he receives. Sometimes he will be called 
upon to work over hours and must do so cheerfully. 
He will be a merchant himself in due time, employing 
other boys to do what he is now doing and must know 
by experience what it means to deliver goods. 
His next step is to become clerk, where he may 
acquire all the knowledge the place affords. He must 
learn not only to sell goods, but to take care of them 
and keep them in order; to be affable to purchasers 
without being officious; to know what is wanted, to 
keep account of sales, to see that new orders are made 
out in time, to unbale and mark goods, to put them in 
their proper places and scores of other details. 
In this way he takes a complete course in the mer- 
cantile business, and after several years is far enough 
advanced to become a partner or to start in business 
for himself. If he has done his duty at every point, he 
will have no trouble in securing a position or in find- 
ing customers if he sets up for himself. If he has 
shirked his work, neglected his opportunities or been 
dishonest, he is on the high road to failure. ‘ 
A similar course of procedure will insure success in 
other lines. In railroad, in shop, in factory, on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
  TALKS ON THE INDUSTRIES 205 
farm, a young man may win his way if he will start 
right and persevere. But he must not despise the day 
of small things. If he has to earn his way, so much 
the better; it is a glorious privilege. Many rich men 
require their sons to begin at the bottom and go through 
a rigid course of training, and no one can deny the 
wisdom of it. 
How One Man Made His Way.—The son of a rail- 
road president disregarded his father’s wealth and posi- 
tion and started to work on the section. He learned 
there how a roadbed is made and kept in order; the 
best material for ballast and ties, and how to put down 
rails. He found out something of the expense and 
labor of maintaining the road, what a gang of men 
ought to accomplish and many other things he would 
be expected to know when he himself became presi- 
dent. 
Passing from the section into the shops, he learned 
the art of directing and controlling men. He became 
a fireman and made himself familiar with the ways of 
the road. By diligence he mastered the details of the 
engine and the duties of an engineer, and finally at- 
tained to that responsible position. Mastering this, 
in a similar way he passed through the offices, always 
learning by doing, until at last he succeeded to the 
presidency. He had acquired a knowledge of the busi- 
ness in the best way, by experience coupled with in- 
telligent observation. It took him years to do it, but 
they were happy years, far more so than if he had 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  206 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
dawdled about, spending money that some one else had 
earned. Instead of dissipated habits, he had acquired 
industry, knew the joy of honest labor and the delight 
of living on his own earnings. 
Such a course is worth more than millions left by a 
rich relative and is open to any young man. Hundreds 
who have been obliged to make their own way have 
done the same thing and are now enjoying the rewards 
of their efforts. 
Qualifications for a Politician—It may happen that 
some member of the school will decide to be a politician. 
If his motives are right, there is no need to discourage 
him. It is an honor to serve one’s country in any 
capacity, and office-holding offers many opportunities 
for usefulness. ‘To attain to eminence as a statesman 
is to hold an enviable position among men. To reach 
the highest places insures a record in history. It is, 
therefore, a laudable ambition. 
There is no school for the special study of politics 
or the training of statesmen, except the school of ex- 
perience. Still there are opportunities to equip one’s 
self with useful knowledge that should not be neg- 
lected. The colleges and universities furnish courses 
in political economy, political science, and sociology; 
and even the district school has or should have a course 
in civil government. We want educated men to make 
our laws and to conduct our public affairs. If a young 
man really desires to serve his country, he should spare 
no pains in his preparation. Otherwise he will be
-P-A-G-E-201
TALKS ON THE INDUSTRIES 207 
limited in the amount he may accomplish and ham- 
pered at every turn. 
The first essential in politics is honesty. Above all 
things we need in our public men purity of life, right- 
eousness of conduct. Only men of strong character 
should think of taking up politics as a life work. There 
are so many temptations to trickery that it requires 
strength to resist. 
5. OCCUPATIONS FOR WOMEN 
Domestic Duties.—Since only a part of the foregoing 
will apply directly to girls, a word for their special 
benefit will not be out of place. They are not expected 
to choose trades or professions for life. Every normal 
girl should look forward to home-making and be fitted 
for domestic duties. This need not interfere with her 
general education, but should be a part of it. In these 
days it is very generally admitted that girls have as 
much right to the possession and enjoyment of an 
education as have boys; but as their duties are not the 
same, their training should differ in some particulars. 
Many schools teach domestic arts, chief of which 
are cooking and sewing. These are accomplishments 
any woman may be proud of. ‘They will not hinder her 
from presiding with grace at the piano, or from being 
an ornament in society. They will not only be useful, 
but will add to the happiness of herself and others. 
Women as Teachers.—The one profession that is by
-P-A-G-E-202
  208 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
general consent open to women is that of teaching. 
In city schools the grades from kindergarten to high 
school have practically been given over to them, and 
they are well represented also in secondary schools and 
colleges. ‘This furnishes a wide field for women and 
they are filling it admirably. Faithful and efficient, 
their influence for good can hardly be overestimated. 
If a girl desires to become a teacher, her first duty 
is to prepare herself for the work. A knowledge of the 
branches she expects to teach is not sufficient. She 
should by all means attend a training school and study 
method as well as matter. She should have the culture 
that comes with education, and a fund of general 
knowledge that will enrich her teaching. Even if she 
should teach but a few terms, her preparation should 
be none the less thorough; the kind and amount has 
been suggested elsewhere in this book. 
Other Activities—But there are some girls who have 
need to support themselves who are not “‘ born teachers” 
and who have no desire to enter the profession; they 
must be told of the avenues open to them. They may 
become clerks, bookkeepers, stenographers. But aside 
from a few glittering attractions, to follow any of these 
is to lead a hard life. To sit at a desk or typewriter 
many hours a day and work at high speed; to do the 
same thing over and over again in the same way is mo- 
notonous and tiresome. The only way to enjoy it is to 
take a pride in doing it well. Skill and efficiency give 
pleasure in almost any kind of employment.
-P-A-G-E-203
TALKS ON THE INDUSTRIES 209 
  The outline in this chapter is intended to be sug- 
gestive rather than exhaustive. In its consideration 
many other interesting matters will arise to claim 
attention. It will not do for the teacher to plead lack 
of time. The school is the only training place for life 
for a large majority of the pupils, and such work as 
this will be just as developing and more directly ap- 
plicable to their wants than much of the knowledge of 
the books, which is farther away from their lives. The 
teacher must not only be an instructor in knowledge, 
but a leader in thought and a molder of character. 
What can be more interesting or more practical than 
the consideration of one’s life work? It is exceedingly 
important, and young people need the wisdom of older 
heads in considering it. The teacher cannot choose for 
the pupils, but he may lay down certain broad prin- 
ciples and explain many things that will aid them in 
avoiding errors. 
The main points in choosing a life work are first 
usefulness, second happiness and third remuneration. 
Availability, natural fitness and inclination also must 
be taken into account. People often take these in the 
wrong order and consider remuneration before use- 
fulness and happiness. It is a mistake. True success 
consists in assisting in the world’s work and adding 
to the world’s enjoyment, rather than in the acquiring 
of wealth.

    CHAPTER X 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL 
If the suggestions of this book up to the present 
point were followed, there would be little need to dis- 
cuss government. Teacher and pupils would be kept 
so busy carrying on the work of the school that there 
would be no time for mischief. But after all there 
is some reason for a separate consideration of the 
subject. In the best laid plans there are breaks and 
interruptions that cannot be foreseen. Besides, the 
government of a considerable body of people is an im- 
portant matter and difficult under any circumstances, 
at least until the art is learned. By a vast number it 
is considered the one disagreeable feature of teaching 
and is particularly dreaded by beginners. 
1. THE TEACHER HIMSELF 
It is safe to say that the most essential part of school 
management is the self-government oj the teacher. Prac- 
tically, it all depends upon the teacher’s ability to live 
up to his own ideals. If he can do this, if he can make 
plans and carry them out, with such changes only as 
are necessary to the good of the school, he will have no 
210
-P-A-G-E-205
  
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL 211 
trouble. But here is where the difficulty lies. It is 
easier to make plans than to follow them; to think or 
say we will do a thing, than to do it. The one person 
in the school hardest to control will be the teacher 
himself. 
The Cultivation of Will Power.—First, then, a few 
words directly to the teacher. It is necessary in the 
beginning and at all times to cultivate will power. 
Set yourself some daily task that you have not been 
accustomed to, and compel yourself to perform it. If 
it is disagreeable, so much the better, providing it is 
not injurious. When you have triumphed over it, ap- 
point yourself another and so keep on until you have 
gained such mastery over self that you can perform 
any duty no matter how disagreeable. 
The first task may be reading the Bible through in 
course, taking so many chapters or so many minutes a 
day, and doing it at exactly the time appointed. Or 
it may be that you will choose the history of England, 
or Prescott’s ‘‘ History of Mexico,” or Stanley’s “Travels 
in Africa,” or some other work. This ought not to be 
an unpleasant task, but to do it regularly and unfail- 
ingly requires the exercise of will power. 
An additional task may be going through a set of 
physical exercises at regular times, say upon rising in 
the morning. This, followed by a sponge bath, will be 
conducive to health and vigor. 
A Set of Conduct Rules.—It was suggested in a previ- 
ous chapter that the teacher should have a set of rules  
-P-A-G-E-206
  212 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
relating to his own conduct, should keep them in a 
place where he can see them every day, and should 
make a strenuous effort to live up to them. It may be 
well just here to formulate sucha set. Every one should 
make his own, but the following are general enough to 
apply to all: 
(1) I will arrange a daily program for myself from 
the time of rising until retiring. 
(2) I will make a strong effort to live by ‘this pro- 
gram. 
(3) I will be neat and clean in my person and in my 
personal appearance. 
(4) I will see that my schoolhouse is kept in order 
and tastefully adorned. 
(5) I will greet my pupils pleasantly in the morning 
and be cheerful throughout the day. 
(6) I will treat all my pupils with unvarying respect 
and kindness. 
(7) If some do not now seem worthy, I will think 
of what they may become under proper training, and 
respect them accordingly. 
(8) I will perform every duty with the spirit and 
energy I would use if I were on trial. 
(9) In word and deed I will try to be a fit example 
for my pupils. 
Every one has his standard of life and makes a 
greater or less effort to live up to it; why not have it 
expressed in writing like the above, and placed where 
it can be seen and used frequently? In arranging our
-P-A-G-E-207
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL 213 
daily program we must have a time for self-examina- 
tion. We must review the work of the day and see if 
our actions measure up to the standard. 
2. ORDER IN SCHOOL 
The government of the school may be considered 
under five heads, as follows: Order, Rules, Punishment, 
Management, Training. We will discuss them in the 
sequence named. 
What Order Means.—The term “‘order,” as applied 
to schools, has two meanings; first and best, it means 
system, proper arrangement of work and plans, every- 
thing carried on harmoniously at the time appointed. 
All this depends entirely upon the teacher and has 
been sufficiently discussed in other places. Second, it 
means the behavior of the students, their observance 
of the regulations, and attention to their several duties. 
Disorder consists in neglect of duty, doing things at 
the wrong time and doing wrong things at any time. 
Everybody likes order in the abstract and would 
like to be orderly in life, but acquiring the habit is 
difficult and irksome and children will not do it with- 
out assistance. ‘True, it seems to come more naturally 
to some than to others, but all will do things in a more 
or less haphazard way unless directed and supervised. 
Orderliness in Person and Surroundings.—Each pupil 
should be taught to be orderly in person, in desk and 
surroundings and in work. The matter of personal 
   
-P-A-G-E-208
  214 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
appearance—hands and face clean, hair and clothing 
in order—should be noticed daily, morning and after- 
noon. The arrangement of books, papers, pens and 
pencils must likewise be looked after. His seat is the 
pupil’s home and must be put in order whenever it is 
in disorder, no matter how it became so. These ap- 
pear to be little things, but their observance con- 
tributes much to the good of the school and to the 
after life of the pupils. 
System in Work.—To learn to work systematically 
and economically requires years of training, and there 
is no better place for its acquirement than the school- 
room. It should begin with the youngest students 
and continue through the entire course. If the teacher 
is himself systematic, it will make the training of the 
pupils a simple matter. He will see that the pupils are 
seated to the best advantage, that everything is in order 
and that conditions are as favorable for work as he can 
make them. 
Every pupil should have his own daily program 
made out, and the teacher would do well to see that 
this is done. He may take a class at a time for the 
arrangement. Thus provided, pupils will be much 
more likely to be on time in the morning and attentive 
to business throughout the day. 
Such a program will give them also a better idea of 
the value of time and the necessity of economizing it. 
If they fail to do the work of an hour, it will appear 
in the recitation where the loss may be pointed out,
-P-A-G-E-209
  
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL 215 
so that they may be conscious of it. There will be no 
time to make it up in school, because every moment 
is provided for. The making up must be done either 
at playtime or at home. 
It must not be expected that children will fall into 
such a habit at once. Young and older occasionally 
will lapse into play when they should work. It will 
take “Line upon line, precept upon precept, here a 
little and there a little” of instruction, patience, kind- 
ness and will power on the part of the teacher, but 
progress will be made and gradually the school will 
become a busy workshop, everything moving forward 
quietly and harmoniously with the order and precision 
of machinery. Such a school presents one of the most 
beautiful sights in the world and the pupils will be as 
much delighted with it as the teacher. 
3. RULES AND REGULATIONS 
Sufficient instruction on this subject has been given 
under the same topic in Chapter Two. It should be 
re-read at this point. 
4. PUNISHMENT 
The Law of Natural Penalty.—Every wrong act has a 
natural penalty that is certain to follow. The penalty 
is involved in the act itself. A burn or a blow injures 
the tissue concerned and we suffer pain. We may
-P-A-G-E-210
er ee ee ee 
216 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
alleviate the pain, but we cannot remove the injury. 
If we eat something injurious, we impair the body. In 
short, if we disobey the laws of health, we must suffer 
the consequences. We may be sorry and may be for- 
given the offense, but we cannot avoid the penalty. © 
The same is true of our moral natures. If we break 
a moral law, we injure our character and must abide 
the consequences. If we tell an untruth, we likewise 
injure our character and impair our reputation. Our 
reliability has been tested and has failed. We may 
be forgiven, but our weak spot has been discovered and 
we shall not be trusted to the same extent soon again. 
This is the natural penalty. 
Now a wise and merciful Providence has so ar- 
ranged it that the results of ordinary infractions of the 
law are not everlasting. The flesh of a child is soft and 
delicate and must of necessity meet with a multitude 
of injuries. Nature kindly heals the bumps and bruises 
and toughens the flesh so that no harm remains. The 
pain attendant upon the injury was, however, a warn- 
ing to be more careful in future, lest greater evils 
befall. If the child should lose an eye or a limb, 
Nature cannot restore it. 
The moral nature of childhood is likewise tender 
and delicate and subject to many bumps and bruises 
that bring pain and tears. These are not held against 
the child to his permanent injury, but are lost sight 
of and forgotten. Like the bodily injuries, the suffer- 
ing entailed is a warning against future and greater 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL 217 
offenses that might result in permanent harm, like loss 
of character or reputation. If the conscience be seared 
or destroyed, there is no recovery. 
Corporal Punishment.—This is not a natural penalty 
for a wrong act. It is an artificial means of prevention 
that may be used when the natural penalty is not ap- 
parent to the child, or does not act as a deterrent. 
Disobedience is wrong because it injures the moral 
character (the unfailing penalty), and may lead to 
serious consequences, as the loss of life or limb or 
reputation. But the child is not conscious of the 
moral loss and cannot understand the danger imminent 
or remote. 
For example, a child may be told not to play out- 
side the yard, the reason being the remote danger of 
passing teams, or a pond some distance away,—rea- 
sons which he cannot understand, having no knowl- 
edge of such dangers. The child, left alone in the 
yard, wanders outside, has a good time and no harm 
results. Mother or teacher said, ‘‘I am afraid you will 
get hurt,” but he did not get hurt, is not afraid and 
determines to do the same thing again if opportunity 
offers. The child cannot be made to see the danger 
nor realize the sin of disobedience, and so must be 
punished for his own good. 
The question now arises, what kind of punishment 
will be most suitable to the offense and most effective 
in preventing a repetition? Whipping is a quick and 
easy kind to administer, and if severe is likely to be 
   
-P-A-G-E-212
   
    218 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
effective. The objection to it is that it carries with it 
no moral restraint. If the child obeys hereafter, it will 
be because he fears another whipping and not because 
it is wrong. 
Other Methods of Punishment.—A better way might 
be to tell him he cannot play in the yard when there 
is no one to watch him, lest he wander away again 
and get hurt. He finds in a day or two that his dis- 
obedience is costing him dearly and promises not to 
do so again, and the privilege is restored. 
Let us suppose that for a few days he remembers 
his promise; then, when no one is looking, he slips 
out and by and by returns unhurt with no one the 
wiser. When playtime is up, the mother inquires if 
he has remained in the yard all the time. Knowing 
he will be punished if he tells the truth, he denies his 
disobedience and goes free. He now decides that 
lying pays and repeats the offense until he is caught. 
Will she not have to adopt whipping now as a last 
resort? He has not only disobeyed, but has added 
two other and worse offenses, breaking his promise 
and lying about it. 
Here is indeed a difficult situation. Many mothers 
will be driven to the rod, perhaps accompanying it 
with a moral lecture on the triple sin. Let it be said 
that whipping, righteously administered, is far better 
than neglect or scolding. A better plan would be to 
have a serious talk with the child concerning his faults, 
and explain to him that he must obey and put him on 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL 219 
a longer probation than before. If he repents, he may 
be forgiven but cannot yet be trusted. Even if he 
promises, he should be told that he broke his promise 
once and may do it again. ‘This will show him the real 
penalty of lying, namely, that his word is not trusted 
and will not serve him as it did before he broke it. 
When he fully realizes this and determines hereafter 
to be faithful, he should be trusted in some small mat- 
ter and then in something more important and so con- 
tinued until he has been fully restored to his former 
position. 
In every case if the child can be made to feel the 
natural penalty of wrongdoing, it is much better than 
artificial punishment. Many of the rules of the school, 
however, are simply for the comfort and convenience 
of pupils and teacher and carry with their infraction 
no moral injury except that which is incurred by dis- 
obeying. For example, if a child should persist in 
getting out of step in marching or in doing little things 
that are annoying, it may not be possible to punish 
him by depriving him of the exercise, whatever it is, 
as that might be just to his liking. In such a case he 
must be told kindly but firmly that he must do his 
part. If this does not suffice, vigorous treatment must 
be administered. Let him be deprived of some privi- 
lege that he will value, or better still just make him do 
the thing that he is shirking or slighting as he ought 
to do it. If the teacher is kind and firm in all his re- 
quirements, he is not likely to meet with serious op-
-P-A-G-E-214
220 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
position. It is the weak and vacillating teacher that 
meets with continual annoyance. 
Punishments to be Avoided——No punishment that is 
cruel or torturing should ever be thought of, much less 
resorted to. It puts the teacher in the light of a tyrant 
and proves to the pupils that he is out of harmony 
with them. Harsh treatment may cow the school and 
produce a sullen obedience, but it will bring unhappi- 
ness and cultivate bad dispositions. It is wholly to be 
condemned. 
Punishments that are excessively humiliating are 
likewise to be avoided. The dunce cap may convince 
a boy that he is a dunce, but that is the very thing he 
ought not to think. Convince him that he is a dunce 
or that he is the worst boy in school and he is likely to 
accept the situation and act on it. Better tell him he 
is not any of these things and you cannot be convinced 
that he is, and he will not make any further effort in 
the wrong direction. Let it be borne in mind that all 
wrong punishments injure the teacher more than the 
pupils, and render his future government more diffi- 
cult. 
Fairness and Justice——Again, punishments should al- 
ways be fair, that is, they should be in proportion to the 
offense. Children have a wonderfully strong sense of 
fairness. This is their main dependence on the play- 
ground. If one does not play fair, the others will not 
play with him. “That is not fair” is their severest 
condemnation. It is the innate sense of justice that
-P-A-G-E-215
       THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL 221 
is one of the strong points in our national character. 
It will not do to ignore it nor override it. It should be 
cultivated. 
In every case requiring punishment, the teacher 
should ask himself what course will be fair and just, 
not only from his standpoint but from that of the 
pupils. If there is a doubt, let the error be on the side 
of fairness. To go beyond justice is looked upon as 
an outrage and arouses indignation that is expensive 
to the teacher. On the other hand, if he establishes a 
record of fairness, he will have the school on his side, 
an essential state of affairs in easy government. 
It is a favorite method with some teachers, when an 
offense has been committed, to hold court over it and 
reserve the sentence, leaving the offender in a state of 
dread and uncertainty. This is not right. It is not 
in accordance with the Golden Rule, ‘‘Whatsoever ye 
would that men should do to you, do ye even so to 
them.” As much time should be taken for delibera- 
tion as is required for a wise decision and no more. 
The two greatest essentials to effectiveness are swift- 
ness and certainty. If punishment were certain to fall 
immediately, offenses would seldom be committed. 
The Value of Inspiration.—Lastly, inspiration is in- 
finitely better than threats or punishments. The 
teacher who is whole-souled and enthusiastic, who is 
constantly setting high ideals of attainment before his 
pupils, will have but little need to resort to punish- 
ment. There is something seriously the matter with the    
-P-A-G-E-216
       222 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
teacher who is always punishing. Such a one, if he 
cannot bring about a different state of affairs, would 
better seek some other vocation. He should admit 
that the trouble is in himself or in his methods, search 
out the cause and apply a remedy. Teaching is too 
sacred a matter to trifle with. 
5. SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
The Aim of the Public School.—There are two things 
essential to the success of every workman, namely, a 
knowledge of the end to be attained, and a plan by 
which that end can be reached in the time allotted. 
A teacher should have an accurate conception of the 
aim of the public school. Speaking in general terms, 
it consists in three things: First, the acquirement of 
knowledge; second, the development of the mind, and 
third, the formation of character. Each of these should 
be considered separately. The acquirement of knowl- 
edge should extend to the completion of the branches 
taught in the district school and to obtaining the 
diploma offered by the state for such work. 
The development of mind must be measured largely 
by the scholarly attainments of the pupils in the branches 
taught, and by the instruction of the teacher on all 
related subjects. The studies pursued and the in- 
struction are supposed to be the best material for mind 
growth that can be furnished. 
The foundation for a good moral character can be
-P-A-G-E-217
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL 223 
laid in these years. It is the character-forming period. 
The test of its effectiveness will come in the lives of 
the pupils after their schooling is over. 
All this cannot be done in one term of school. Some 
will be beginning, others completing the course. Each 
class should have a certain definite amount of work 
laid out for it so that it may look forward to that end, 
and finally each individual should be judged as to his 
capacity and planned for accordingly. It is much more 
satisfactory to all concerned to work to a plan, than 
to go forward blindly without any special end in view. 
A Plan for Each Detail.—T he government of the school 
likewise should be well planned. The teacher should 
determine in what ways he can best handle his school 
and then proceed in those ways. Some prefer to have 
their pupils march in and out with order and precision; 
also, to come to class and return according to pre- 
scribed order. It is a good thing if well done, but 
sometimes the teacher becomes careless and permits 
the pupils to fall into slipshod habits, in which case it 
were better omitted entirely. The only thing insisted 
upon here is that there should be some plan for each 
detail and that i should be followed to the letter. 
It often happens that plans need to be changed from 
time to time. Probably no method is so good but that 
it might be improved upon. To be constantly chang- 
ing shows weakness, but not to change at all indicates 
lack of growth. Any rule or regulation should be 
subject to change, to be modified or dispensed with
-P-A-G-E-218
  224 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
altogether, but there should be a good reason for 
changing and it should be done with the idea of im- 
provement. 
Quick Decisions a Test of Fitness.—In the manage- 
ment of the school, the teacher is called upon to render 
a multitude of decisions. Many of them must be given 
at a moment’s notice. These decisions are one of the 
strongest tests of fitness. If they are wisely rendered, 
the teacher gains in strength: otherwise he fails to a 
greater or less extent. 
Many questions can be foreseen and some provision 
made in advance. Others will be sprung suddenly and 
require a prompt decision. At such a time the teacher 
should keep a cool head and not speak until he is 
reasonably sure of his ground. He should take into 
consideration the circumstances surrounding the ques- 
tion and decide according to his best judgment, not 
permitting his mind to be biased by pleadings or argu- 
ments that have no weight. If he makes a mistake, he 
should not hesitate to acknowledge it and should avoid 
a like error in the future. 
In this way, each decision forms a precedent for future 
action so that in time almost every important matter 
will have received consideration, and questions may be 
decided in the light of previous ones whose conse- 
quences are known. Thus experience gives us wis- 
dom. 
Arrangement of the Schoolroom.—Such matters as the 
arrangement of desks, seating of the pupils, adjust-
-P-A-G-E-219
        
   
                       
   
                                                      THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL     225 
ment of light and heat are all worthy of careful atten- 
tion. It is entirely in the teacher’s province to decide 
where each pupil shall sit, but it is not wise to shift 
any one’s seat except for good reason. If a pupil per- 
sists in whispering or teasing those nearest him, it is 
a natural penalty for him to forfeit his seat for a less 
desirable place. But it should be understood, after 
the school has once been permanently seated accord- 
ing to the teacher’s idea, that each one’s seat is his own 
and so long as he conducts himself as he should, he 
will not be disturbed. 
Doors, windows and blinds or shades have been 
mentioned elsewhere. ‘They should all be in good 
order and kept so throughout the term, so that the 
school will not be needlessly annoyed. If the room is 
pleasant and comfortable, there will be less friction and 
better progress will result. 
Do not wait for things to get out of order, but keep 
them in order. A teamster does not put off oiling his 
wagon until the screeching of the wheels reminds him 
of it, but examines ahead and applies the oil in time 
to avoid trouble, thus saving his wagon, his team and 
perhaps his temper. This principle applied in the 
schoolroom will work equally well. Oil the bearings 
before the machinery begins to screech. 
When all is in thorough order and the teacher knows 
just what he wants to do and how he means to do it, 
he can go about every duty coolly and calmly, as one 
who is master of the situation. This will win respect, 
Dist. School—15
-P-A-G-E-220
       226 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
whereas doubt, hesitation or excitement proclaims 
weakness and invites contempt. 
6. TRAINING 
Pupils not only admire a well-trained teacher, one 
who knows his business and attends to it, who is not 
flustered at little things nor taken by surprise by larger 
ones, and who is self-possessed under all circumstances, 
but they are also anxious for such a training themselves 
and moreover have a right to it. Selj-discipline is the 
principal part of an education. Knowledge without it 
is well-nigh useless. If a pupil is trained to think, to 
plan, to work steadily in spite of difficulties and ob- 
stacles, there is little he may not achieve. This, to- 
gether with right convictions, abiding principles and 
firmness of character, makes the desirable citizen. 
Right Habits of Thought and Action—Hence it is 
plain that the teacher’s main duty is thus to train his 
pupils into right habits of thought and action. All 
the books, recitations and regulations are but means 
to this end. Each lesson is thoroughly learned and 
assimilated not so much for its own intrinsic value, as 
for the habit of doing well whatever is to be done. If 
by means of the lessons of the schoolroom, the habit of 
thoroughness is established for life, the value of those 
lessons cannot be overestimated. Promptness, regu- 
larity of attendance and attention to duty are all of 
great advantage in carrying on the work of the school,  
-P-A-G-E-221
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL 227 
but if they become fixed habits that will remain through 
life, they are vastly more valuable. 
The Force of Example.—If a teacher will stop to con- 
sider what his pupils will think of him and his teach- 
ing in after years, he will not permit any laxity in his 
own life. Almost without exception, young people are 
grateful to those who have helped them to overcome 
bad or careless habits and have set them on the road 
to usefulness, and to receive their love and appreciation 
is one of the chief delights of teaching. On the other 
‘hand, they look back with regret, as well they may, 
upon years spent under some poor instructor, who, 
either from ignorance or indolence, failed to give them 
the training they have since needed. ‘They very justly 
hold such a one responsible for their failures and heap 
blame, not to use a stronger term, upon his head. 
Let it be engraved upon his’ heart that the test of a 
teacher is his pupils. They will exemplify his teachings. 
The Savior of the world is the ideal teacher. He had 
no schoolhouse, no text-books, no board of education 
and received no salary. His pupils were picked up 
from the common walks of life and were apparently no 
better than the thousands of others around them. But 
after a few short years under his instruction, and man- 
ifestly because of it, they became men of unusual 
courage and power and left an impress upon the world 
that will never be forgotten. Critics may find fault 
with his methods, but the lives of his disciples and of 
all who have taken his teaching as their rule of con-  
-P-A-G-E-222
228 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
duct are unanswerable. They are his epistles, teach- 
ings, or text-books, known and read of all men. 
Socrates and Plato were the great teachers of ancient 
Greece. The names of many of their pupils are as 
household words to every student of history. Through 
association with their teachers the pupils themselves 
became great. 
So it has ever been and will always be. The teacher 
is more important than the schoolhouse, the desks or 
the text-books. If he is great-souled, the pupils will 
catch his spirit and become like him. If he is little 
and despicable, we may expect to find the same traits 
in those whom he teaches. The only person who is 
fit to stand before the school is the one whose instruc- 
tion is right and whose life measures up to his teach- 
ings. 
The teacher’s life being correct, he may freely lay | 
down rules of conduct for his pupils. His example is 
their rule. He is not addicted to tobacco, uses no bad 
language, does not display rudeness; he may therefore 
require the same standard for his pupils, making allow- 
ance, to be sure, for their youthfulness and inexperi- 
ence, but being satisfied with nothing less than earnest 
and honest efforts. They are not to act because he 
does, but as he does, striving to reach his attainments 
and even to go beyond them because they are right 
and desirable. 
The young artist tries to copy his master’s works. 
He makes many blunders, has to erase and begin over

      THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL     229 
again and with his best efforts falls far short of the 
model. The master is patient, points out the causes 
of failure and offers suggestions for improvement. 
He never chides for imperfections, unless they are the 
result of carelessness or lack of effort. The pupil 
gradually gains in skill and assurance and after years 
of patient practice, equals or perhaps excels his master. 
Every true teacher rejoices to see his pupils gain higher 
ground than he has reached, while they in turn are ever 
ready to share their honors with him.
-P-A-G-E-224
      CHAPTER XI 
HARVESTING THE RESULTS 
In every enterprise man labors for results. The 
success of any undertaking is measured by what it 
produces. If the results are unsatisfactory, the under- 
taking is a whole or partial failure. 
It has been pointed out in the preceding chapter that 
the schools have an object in view, namely, to produce 
the highest grade of citizenship. This is done most 
effectively by affording each individual the opportunity 
to make the best man or woman he or she is capable 
of becoming. It was stated further that this is brought 
about by three things, the acquirement of knowledge, 
the development of the mental powers and the forma- 
tion of character. 
The patrons and the public generally have a right 
to know and ought to know how the school is succeed- 
ing in its mission. They cannot stand by and watch 
the process of citizen-making. They must judge by 
such indications as make themselves apparent from 
time to time. The object of this chapter is to point 
out certain ways by which the efficiency of the school 
may become manifest to the community, to the en- 
richment of both patrons and pupils.

  HARVESTING THE RESULTS 231 
i. THE SCHOOL EXHIBITION 
What It Is and What It Does.—The School Exhibition 
shows to the patrons the mental and moral tone of 
the school, the interest of the pupils, their good be- 
havior, their ability to comport themselves commend- 
ably before an audience and the teacher’s skill as a 
leader. It is a public showing of what is being ac- 
complished in school. 
As commonly given, it consists of declamations, es- 
says, orations, debates, dialogues, calisthenic drills, 
current events, items of local interest, songs, and 
speeches by teacher and visitors. 
It has a number of objects in view. It is expected 
to increase public interest and secure greater co- 
operation; to be an incentive to effort on the part of 
the pupils; to quicken a lagging interest at the middle 
or toward the close of the term; to promote diligence 
and good fellowship; to bring to light any latent genius 
that might otherwise remain undiscovered. 
How It Should Be Planned.—An exhibition should be 
planned a considerable time before it is to be given. 
It may be in the teacher’s mind for several weeks 
before being mentioned to the pupils. He must take 
account of the material at hand, of the talent to be 
used. This one principle should be laid down as 
irrefragable, that every pupil in the school must have 
some part. If one cannot sing, he can take part in a 
motion song; if he cannot recite alone, he can in con-
-P-A-G-E-226
  232 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
cert with his class. To plan something for the small- 
est, the dullest and the timidest requires tact and wis-" 
dom, but it must be done. 
When the plan is sufficiently matured to insure its 
feasibility, it may be made known to the school. It 
will be more enjoyed if the initiative appears to come 
from the pupils. It will be strange if they will not 
have made some inquiries as to whether there is to 
be an exhibition this term. The teacher has evaded 
the question, or promised to consider it. In this case, 
he may say that he has been asked to consider the 
advisability of giving an exhibition, has done so and 
sees no objection if the school as a whole desires it. 
This being ascertained to his satisfaction, he may out- 
line his plan, laying down such simple conditions as 
seem best. It will be wise to let the pupils have as 
much share in the planning as they are capable of. 
They may elect committees with the understanding 
that. the teacher is by virtue of his responsibility a 
member of each. These committees may be on pro- 
gram, advertising, decoration, arrangement of plat- 
form, cleaning up the grounds, etc. No student should 
serve on more than one or two committees. Each 
committee may call on others for assistance. In this 
way all will be enlisted. 
Suggestion for a Program.—It will be the duty of 
the committee on program to see that each pupil is 
assigned to some suitable part. Requests may be con- 
sidered, but the decision of the committee is final un-
-P-A-G-E-227
  HARVESTING THE RESULTS 233 
less it sees fit to reconsider. The program should 
be instructive, practical and entertaining. Patriotic 
selections should always form a part. The following 
is offered as suggestive only: 
Call to order. 
School Hymn. 
Prayer by clergyman or other visitor. 
School Song. 
Essay, ‘A Day in School.” 
Declamation. 
Memory Gems by First Reader Class. 
Motion Song by Primary Grades. 
Essay, “Springtime on the Farm.” 
Declamation, “The Power of Habit”? (John B. Gough). 
‘Temperance Song. 
Flag Drill. 
Declamation, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. 
Song, National Anthem. 
Oration, “What Our Country Needs,” by largest boy. 
History Drill by advanced students. 
Current Events. 
School Paper. 
Declamation, Humorous Selection. 
Original Story by Fifth Grade pupil. 
Short Speeches by visitors. 
Address by Teacher, “What Our School Is and Should Be.” 
Closing Song, National Hymn. 
The commonest fault of programs is that they are 
too long. If the exhibition is held in the daytime 
(as it should be), it may consume the afternoon ses- 
sion; if at night, not over two hours. 
Preliminary Preparations.—Having thus arranged the 
program, the next thing is the preparation. The time 
for giving it publicly should be set not more than three 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  234 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
or four weeks in advance. Sufficient time must be pro- 
vided for each one to prepare his part so that school 
duties will not be seriously interfered with. When this 
has elapsed, drills and rehearsals are in order. These 
should receive the very best effort of the teacher. His 
enthusiasm will inspire the pupils. Parents and friends 
will expect something worth while and they must nof: 
be disappointed. 
The advertising committee has its duties. No cost 
of printing need be incurred. Neat handbills may be 
made with pen or pencil, utilizing the best talent in 
the school in the lettering. A bright picture of a boy 
speaking his piece, or a little girl reading her com- 
position, will make it more interesting. But the best 
advertising is by word of mouth. No fear but pupils 
will give glowing accounts of what is coming, when 
their enthusiasm has been properly aroused. 
The decorating conumiitee should do a. lot of planning 
before operations are begun. It is an opportunity to 
cultivate taste. When the plans are complete, the 
whole school or a special committee may be appointed 
to secure supplies. Neatness and taste are prime 
essentials in decorating. Here is where the teacher’s 
superior skill will be needed in giving directions. 
At the proper time a meeting of all committees 
should be called and reports heard. If the appointed 
work of any is completed, it may be discharged. As 
the time approaches, every one should be impressed 
with a feeling of personal responsibility for the success
-P-A-G-E-229
HARVESTING THE RESULTS 235 
of the exhibition. Parents also have been enlisted. 
The teacher has had the forethought to ask Mr. “A” 
to be prepared for a short talk on “The District School 
When I Was a Boy ”; Mr. “B,” on “The Pressing 
Need of an Education in These Times”; Mr. “C,” 
who was formerly a teacher, on “High Ideals Neces- 
sary to the Greatest Success.” This completes the 
preparations. 
When planned thus carefully, there is little doubt 
of the success of such an undertaking or of its value 
to the community. The measure of the teacher will be 
taken by the character of the exercises, by the order 
preserved and by the dispatch with which the pro- 
gram is carried out. When it is over, let everything 
that would hinder in the work of the school be re- 
moved and the house put in order. The next morn- 
ing, at the opening of school, a brief review of what 
has been accomplished may be given, praise bestowed 
upon all who made honest efforts, and suggestions for 
improvements offered for future occasions. 
2. THE ScHOOL EXPOSITION 
What It Is and What It Shows.—An exposition is a pub- 
lic display of the actual work done in every branch of 
study. It should consist of samples of the different 
kinds of work done by each pupil in the school. It 
should set forth as graphically as possible, reading, 
writing, spelling, arithmetic, geography (including map-
-P-A-G-E-230
  236 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
drawing), physiology, language, composition, drawing, 
nature study, in short all branches taught and any 
special work that is being attempted, such as manual 
training, cooking, sewing, gardening and the like. 
It shows the skill, advancement and thoroughness of 
the school. It is the complement of the exhibition, 
which shows how the pupils can speak, read and sing. — 
The exhibition and the exposition taken together fully 
represent what the school is accomplishing. 
It is the right and should be the privilege of every 
one, when on inspection, to be seen at his best. This 
does not mean that shoddy work may be the rule in 
the daily routine with occasional furbishing up to de- 
ceive the public. It means that in all work there are 
chips and rubbish; there are earnest attempts and 
honest failures; there are repeated trials and final 
_ triumphs. All work should be the best possible at the 
time. But there comes a time when the tears of failure 
are past and the crown of success is won. Then it is 
ready for the public eye. As a great building is not 
ready for exhibition until it is completed, and until all 
the odds and ends, misfits and rubbish and all signs 
of toil and sweat have been removed, so it is with the 
work of the school,—the public wants to see the fin- 
ished product. 
How to Make It Successful.—There are three elements 
necessary to a successful exposition, namely, a teacher 
who can plan and execute, the cobperation of, pupils and 
patrons, and sufficient time for preparation. Like the
-P-A-G-E-231
  HARVESTING THE RESULTS 237 
exhibition, it is for every member of the school. Ordi- 
narily, the best time for it is at the close of the term. 
If pupils know in good time that specimens of their 
work are to be exhibited, it will be a strong incentive 
for each one to do his best. If specimens of penman- 
ship, drawing and the like are taken near the close, it 
will add to the inducement to effort. Specimens should 
always be taken from time to time, say at the end of 
each month. A good quality of paper should be used 
and great pains taken in the matter of neatness and 
accuracy. 
In such studies as penmanship, spelling, drawing 
and numbers, methods of procedure will readily sug- 
gest themselves; others may be more difficult. Mak- 
ing reading lessons is an excellent practice and not 
very difficult when once understood. Familiar objects 
should be chosen such as Nut Gathering, Sorghum 
Making, Berrying, Making a Bouquet, etc. Let the 
pupils tell their experiences or give their ideas on 
these, writing them out in proper order for a reading 
lesson. A nice drawing on the margin of the page, 
suggestive of the subject, as a stalk of cane, a bunch 
of berries, or a flower, adds an effective touch. Neat 
little pictures cut from advertisements will serve a like 
purpose. 
This, you will say, is not reading, but composition. 
It is composition truly enough, but why not reading? 
Pupils will read their own compositions better and 
enjoy them more than those found in books. 
   
-P-A-G-E-232
  2 38 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
Physiology is a good subject for written work. 
Even if the teaching is oral, valuable lessons may be 
given with simple illustrations, the pupils writing out 
at their seats the substance of what was developed in 
the class, accompanying it with the blackboard draw- 
ing used by the teacher. Nature study also furnishes 
an inexhaustible supply of interesting material. Each 
month in the year has its products, and the study of 
birds, insects, weeds, flowers and crops affords a de- 
lightful variety for the cultivation of the mind, and 
the specimens and written descriptions will make an 
interesting and instructive display. In fact, when the 
work of preparing for an exposition is once started, 
there is no trouble in finding material. The greatest 
danger will be in having too much, so that it will be 
confusing. 
Arranging the Display.—Considerable care is neces- 
sary in arranging the display so that it may be seen 
readily and understood. As much of it as possible 
should be put on the walls so that it may be seen with- 
out handling. A blank wall is much to be preferred. 
The work of the several grades should, be arranged 
in order, beginning with the first. Each grade should 
be ticketed and further distinguished by some kind 
of boundary line. When the available wall-space is 
exhausted, boards about three feet high may be placed 
around the sides of the room and the same order of 
arrangement observed. This will give sufficient space. 
The Results Accomplished.—A whole afternoon is not
-P-A-G-E-233
  HARVESTING THE RESULTS 239 
too much to devote to an exposition in a district school. 
The advanced pupils should be shown how to conduct 
visitors around the room and explain the work. They 
and the teacher will find plenty to do. Every parent 
will want to see the work of his or her children and 
compare it with that of others. It often happens that 
a boy who has been absent a considerable portion of 
the time, will have a poor showing. The parents will 
ask the reason for this, and the answer should be forth- 
coming, “‘Eddie was absent so:many days or weeks 
and fell behind his class.” No better object lesson can 
be furnished, and it will be strange if the parents do 
not determine that Eddie shall not be kept out of school 
on any frivolous pretext hereafter. 
Many exclamations also will be made about the ex- 
cellence of the work, as most of the visitors never saw 
anything to equal it. No such thing was thought of in 
their day. Interest and pride in the skill and pro- 
ficiency of their children will be aroused, and they 
will carry away a greater realization of the value of a 
day in school than they ever had before. The children 
likewise will feel that their efforts have been appre- 
ciated. Their taste of triumph will cause them to , 
strive for still greater achievements in the future. 
When all is over, each pupil may carry away with 
him such of his own work as he desires to preserve. 
It will serve for future comparisons. The author has 
given many such expositions and always with the most 
gratifying results.

3. OTHER TESTS OF THE SCHOOL’s SUCCESS 
Character Made in School.—However much the work 
just described may please the patrons of the school, 
- they will be still more delighted if they can see marked 
signs of improvement in the pupils themselves. If 
their faces are brighter and more animated, if they are 
more manly and womanly, if their manners are im- 
proved so that they are becoming real gentlemen and 
ladies, it will be a proud day for their parents. They 
may not say much nor be able to express their thoughts, 
but their faces will show their happiness and satis- 
faction. 
If they can see that Willie is more painstaking, 
Mary is more thoughtful and studious, Richard always 
says “‘thank you” and ‘excuse me,” John is “getting 
to be quite a man,” it will not matter about words. 
Their shining eyes and warm handclasp will be suffi- 
cient. The teacher will go home and give thanks that 
he has had the privilege of guiding the footsteps of those 
young people. He will watch their future develop- 
ment with a fatherly interest and never cease to re- 
gard them as his pupils. 
Looking Forward.—Another fair way to judge the 
efficiency of a school is to observe the signs of purpose 
in the minds of the pupils, particularly the older ones. 
Have they some definite, worthy aim in life, or are 
they merely drifting hither and thither like a leaf on 
a pond? How many are planning to seek further
-P-A-G-E-235
HARVESTING THE RESULTS 241 
education than the district school affords? How 
many have their minds set to improve on the condi- 
tions about them? Are these young people planning 
to take high places in the world around them as teach- 
ers, preachers, farmers, merchants and mechanics? 
If they cannot now decide what their future vocation 
shall be, are they nevertheless laying a firm founda- 
tion for whatever opens up before them? ‘These are 
pointers that show what is being done. 
The teacher who fires the minds of his pupils with 
noble aspirations, is doing much if he does nothing 
else. But fortunately he must be doing his whole duty 
in order to do that. We cannot conceive of a lazy 
and shirking teacher creating enthusiasm in his pupils. 
It takes fire to kindle fire, and fuel to keep it burning. 
It is a common saying in these days that every boy 
or girl that really desires it may have a thorough edu- 
cation. Schools abound on every side, offering the 
means of education to the humblest and the poorest. 
It remains for the teacher to kindle the desire and 
show the way. If we cannot discover these signs, 
there is something wrong with the teaching. 
Habits of Reading and Self-Improvement.—If such work 
as that which has been outlined in this book has 
been faithfully performed, even one term of school 
will show gratifying results. ‘The pupils will be in 
possession of some good books and will have acquired 
the taste and habit of reading. They should be en- 
couraged to keep on adding to their stock of books and 
Dist. School—16  
-P-A-G-E-236
  242 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
to continue their reading. If they do this, they are 
certain to go on gathering knowledge and improving 
their minds. Otherwise, at the end of the term, their 
education comes to a standstill and their minds begin 
to grow rusty. 
The teacher should have the community and the 
school so organized and codperating that a reading or 
literary society will go on through the vacation. When 
the mental power of the district has been brought into 
fine working order through six months of effort, it is 
poor economy to let it lie idle for the next half year. 
There is not only the loss of what might be accom- 
plished, but the machinery is certain to rust and get 
out of order from disuse. Much time and effort will be 
required to put it in shape‘again. 
It cannot but be a’ source of satisfaction to the 
teacher to know that his work is going forward after 
his term of service is over; that his plans for the better- 
ment of the neighborhood are being carried out. The 
leaders and workers owe their training to him; and the 
greater their success, the more joy and credit to him. 
A course of reading may be laid out for the pupils 
that will last through the vacation, taking so much a 
day or week. Each one may write the teacher a letter 
at the end of a month, telling him what he has ac- 
complished and receive in return suggestions for 
further work. This will be something definite and the 
letters will be a source of pleasure to all concerned. 
Subjects for discussion for the literary society may 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
    
          HARVESTING THE RESULTS 243 
be furnished as they are asked for, which they are 
likely to be. In this way the teacher, no matter where 
he may be, may keep in touch with his pupils and 
patrons until the next term begins. 
Life Friendships Formed in School_—A true friend is 
ever a valuable possession. Friendship forms a large 
part of the joy of living and should be encouraged in 
the school, not so much between the sexes, but among 
the boys and among the girls. Every one should be 
friendly to all, but if two boys or two girls find them- 
selves particularly congenial, there is no objection to 
their being special friends. They should be cautioned 
not to withdraw themselves from the others to the 
detriment of games and general sports. Such would be 
selfish and would prove a hindrance to the general 
friendliness of the school. There will be many op- 
portunities to cultivate their liking for each other with- 
out interfering with the pleasure of their schoolmates. 
Among the mottoes that adorn the walls, one should 
be the Biblical proverb, ‘““He that would have friends 
must show himself friendly.” The story of David and 
Jonathan may be read, as there is perhaps no finer 
example of friendship between two men in all litera: 
ture, a friendship that lasted through two generations. 
Let the pupils discuss the respective situations of 
David and Jonathan. How did their friendship ap- 
pear to originate? What was it that won the admira- 
tion of Jonathan? Is admiration a basis for friend- 
ship? What did Jonathan sacrifice to David? Would
-P-A-G-E-238
   
        244 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
  a selfish or little-minded man in his position have shown 
enmity rather than friendship? Did he do it cheer- 
fully and willingly? Which one showed the deeper 
affection? Why? Read David’s lament over the 
death of Saul and Jonathan. By what does he meas- 
ure the love of Jonathan for him? 
Another famous example is that of Damon and 
Pythias, whose story may be found in any encyclo- 
pedia. Many such friendships have been considered 
important enough to be recorded in history. They 
are given to teach us the value of friendship, to show 
us what a true friend will do for another. 
If we desire the friendship of worthy people (and 
that is the kind we should always seek), the first ne- 
cessity is that we should be true and noble, unselfish 
and thoughtful of others. Then we shall not lack for 
esteem, which is the first step toward friendship. 
When we have made a friend, we should be at pains 
to retain his liking. It is often easier to make friends 
than to keep them. Friendship, like any other virtue, 
must be cultivated. It is not wise to count too much 
or draw too heavily upon a new-made friend; neither 
is it well to make capital out of our friends. That is 
not true friendship. Rather we should strive to add 
to the happiness and rejoice in the prosperity of those 
whom we love and whose esteem we covet. And finally 
we must be just as willing and as anxious to be a true 
friend to others as to win them for ourselves. This is 
the real secret of it all. The man who complains of
-P-A-G-E-239
HARVESTING THE RESULTS 245 
having no friends is too self-centered to win the affec- 
tion of others. He himself is not a friend to any one. 
4. A Fina WorpD To THE TEACHER 
On “ Changing Places.’—It is not wise nor, in the 
long run, profitable to be always changing places. A 
teacher can do more the second term than the first, and 
still more the third. His main thought should be how 
much good he can do, rather than how much salary he 
can draw. Yet neither is it well for a young teacher to 
remain forever in the place where he begins his work. 
The author frequently has recommended young teach- 
ers to remain three years in a place, then, when they 
have mastered its difficulties and expanded their own 
powers, they may, for the sake of increasing their own 
usefulness, seek a larger and more difficult field where 
they will be obliged to put forth new efforts to meet 
the requirements. It is every one’s duty to look to his 
own growth, and new conditions and more difficult 
problems are often the best means for advancement in 
skill and power. 
It must not be forgotten that the surest road to ad- 
vancement is thorough work in whatever situation we 
are placed, and that one school is about as good as 
another in which to show strength. Some teachers 
make the mistake of supposing their pupils the dullest, 
and their patrons the most indifferent and unappre- 
ciative in the country. The idea is utterly wrong.
-P-A-G-E-240
    
246 TEACHING A DISTRICT SCHOOL 
t 
There are no pupils so stupid and no patrons so apa- 
thetic that they cannot be reached if the right means 
are employed, and it is the greater glory to succeed 
under unfavorable conditions. 
Merited Advancement.—If a teacher spe merits the 
esteem of his patrons, there is little danger that his 
light will be hidden, even in the most obscure neigh- 
borhood. If he goes from strength to strength, as he 
may, gaining here and building firmer there, it will not 
be long until his name will be in every mouth, his praises 
will be sung and his fame will go abroad. People never 
show any wisdom by keeping quiet, when they have a 
good thing. They are always boasting of it to others, 
thereby endangering their own peaceful possession. 
Presently there is a bid from some other neighbor- 
hood and the Board are obliged to raise the salary or 
lose their prize. Finally some larger and more desir- 
able field appeals so strongly that no inducement can 
be offered to hold him, and he takes his leave amid 
the regrets and protests of all. 
He leaves behind him true friends, faithful hearts 
and an enviable record and goes to his new work as 
me who has been sought for and secured as a prize, 
and not as one who seeks a position with many ex- 
planations of why his last school was not satisfactory. 
That every one who reads this book may win the 
highest possible success, not by chicanery nor schem- 
ing, but by earnest, honest efforts is the wish of the 
author.

   OARK’S PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION pre- 
sents such a clear exposition of the elementary princi- 
ples of psychology and their practical applications in 
methods of education as to furnish a logical and scientific 
basis for the daily work in the class room. Intended for the 
average teacher, it gives a full and logical outline by which 
the teacher may guide his study and lays constant emphasis 
upon the necessity and the means of carrying psychology into 
the schoolroom. 
4] In METHOD IN EDUCATION the author develops 
in detail the applications of psychology in the work of 
teaching. He discusses the principles upon which good 
teaching must be based, and also the means of making the 
subjects in the curriculum produce the best educational results. 
Each branch of study usually taught in elementary schools is 
taken up and considered separately, and much hopeful advice 
is given, supplemented by suggestive outlines, lesson plans, 
and topics. 
4| ECONOMY IN EDUCATION deals with the prob- 
lems confronting the individual. teacher in the successful ad- 
ministration of his school, and also the larger problems of the 
school as a part of the institutional life and growth of modern 
society. It discusses the problems of the administration of 
school systems and such matters as taxation, boards of 
education, courses of study, and the distinctive work of 
the different schools. ‘The latest movements in the econom- 
ical correlation of the home, libraries, museums, and art

EELEY’S History of Education is a working book, clear, 
comprehensive, and accurate, and sufficient in itself to 
furnish all the material on the subject that is required by 
any examining board, or that may be demanded in a normal 
or college course. 
4 Each educational system that has influenced the world is 
taken up and summarized in turn, its development shown, 
and its important lesson pointed out. The fullest information 
obtainable is presented in simple form and expressed in con- 
cise language. ‘The topics are arranged on a well defined 
plan, everything being practical, useful, and directly to the 
point. 
@ In addition, the book includes biographical sketches of the 
great educators with an illuminating account of their systems — 
of pedagogy. It also provides a general outline of the 
educational history of ancient countries, and affords com- 
parisons of the educational systems of the leading countries 
down to the present time. In short, the volume gives the 
student an accurate view in perspective of the educational 
progress of the world. Extensive bibliographies of works for 
reference are provided. 
4| The work presents for study many of the great pedagogical 
problems that have interested thoughtful men in every age. 
It shows how some of these have been solved in the past and 
points out the way to the solution of others of no less 
importance in the near future. 
4] It should form an indispensable volume in every teacher’s 
library, for it not only is inspiring, but furnishes valuable 
information. Every well informed teacher must know how 
the past has taught in order to cope intelligently with the 
educational problems of today.

    Y the safe path of experience and in the light of modern 
psychology the ELEMENTS OF PEDAGOGY 
points out the limitations of the ordinary systems of 
school education and shows how their methods may be har- 
monized and coérdinated. The fundamental principles of 
teaching are expounded in a manner which is both logical 
and convincing, and such a variety and wealth of pedagogical 
principles are presented as are seldom to be found in a single 
text-book. 
4] SCHOOL MANAGEMENT discusses school govern- 
ment and moral training from the standpoint of experience, 
observation, and study. Avoiding dogmatism, the author 
carefully states the grounds of his views and suggestions, and 
freely uses the fundamental facts of mental and moral science. 
So practical are the applications of principles, and so apt are 
the concrete illustrations that the book can not fail to be of 
interest and profit to all teachers, whether experienced or 
inexperienced. 
4 In the ART OF TEACHING the fundamental princi- 
ples are presented in a clear and helpful manner, and after- 
wards applied in methods of teaching that are generic and 
comprehensive. Great pains has been taken to show the 
true functions of special methods and to point out their limita- 
tions, with_a view to prevent teachers from accepting them 
as general methods and making them hobbies. The book 
throws a clear light, not only on fundamental methods and 
processes, but also on oral illustrations, book study, class 
instruction and management, written examinations and pro- 
motions of pupils, and other problems of great importance.

     HESE readers form a good all-round basal series, suit- 
able for use in. any school; but they will appeal to 
teachers particularly, because of their very easy gradation. 
Both in thought and ‘expression, the books are so carefully 
graded that each selection is but slightly more difficult than 
the preceding one, and there is no real gap anywhere. 
4] Although a wide variety of reading matter is provided, 
good literature, embodying child interests, has been considered 
of fundamental importance. Lessons of a similar nature are 
grouped together, and topics relating to kindred subjects recur 
somewhat regularly. All are designed to quicken the child’s 
observation, and increase his appreciation. 
4] By the use of this series, the child will be taught to read in 
such amanner as will appeal to his interests, and at the same time 
he will be made acquainted with the masterpieces of many fa- 
mous writers. He will gain a knowledge of many subjects, and 
acquire pure and attractive ideals of life and conduct. His imagi- 
nation will be cultivated by pleasing tales of fancy, and he will 
also be taught a love of country, and given glimpses into the 
life of other lands. 
4] The books are very attractive in mechanical appearance, 
and contain a large number of original illustrations, besides 
reproductions of many celebrated paintings.

N the new series of these sterling geographies emphasis is laid 
on industrial, commercial, and political geography, with just 
enough physiography to bring out the causal relations. 
4 The text is clear, simple, interesting, and explicit. The 
pictures are distinguished for their aptness and perfect illus- 
trative character. Two sets of maps are provided, one for 
reference, and the other for study, the latter having corre- 
sponding maps drawn to the same scale. 
4] The INTRODUCTORY GEOGRAPHY develops the 
subject in accordance with the child’s comprehension, each 
lesson paving the way for the next. In the treatment of the 
United States the physiographic, historical, political, industrial, 
and commercial conditions are taken up in their respective 
order, the chief industries and the localities deyoted largely to 
each receiving more than usual consideration. ‘The country 
is regarded as being divided into five industrial sections. 
4 In the SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY a special feature is 
the presentation of the basal principles of physical and general 
geography in simple, untechnical language, arranged in num- 
bered paragraphs. In subsequent pages constant reference is 
made to these principles, but in each ‘case accompanied by 
the paragraph number. ‘This greatly simplifies the work, 
and makes it possible to take up the formal study of these 
introductory lessons after the remainder of the book has been 
completed. With a view to enriching the course, numerous 
specific references are given to selected geographical reading.

Book Two. For sixth, seventh, and cighth years . 
   HIS series presents a new method of teaching language 
which is in marked contrast with the antiquated systems 
in vogue a generation ago. The books meet modern 
conditions in every respect, and teach the child how to ex- 
press his thoughts in language rather than furnish an undue 
amount of grammar and rules, 
4] From the start the attempt has been made to base the work 
on subjects in which the child is genuinely interested. Lessons 
in writing language are employed simultaneously with those in 
conversation, while picture-study, the study of literary selec- 
tions, and letter-writing are presented at frequent intervals. 
The lessons are of a proper length, well arranged, and well 
graded. The books mark out the daily work for the teacher 
in a clearly defined manner by telling him what to do, and 
when to do it. Many unique mechanical devices, ¢. g., a 
labor-saving method of correcting papers, a graphic system of 
diagramming, etc., form a valuable feature of the work. 
{| These books are unlike any other series now on the 
market. They do not shoot over the heads of the pupils, 
nor do they show a marked effort in writing down to 
the supposed level of young minds. They do not contain 
too much technical grammar, nor are they filled with what 
is sentimental and meaningless. No exaggerated attention is - 
given to analyzing by diagramming, and to exceptions to ordi- 
nary rules, which have proved so unsatisfactory.

N these series the best modern methods of instruction have 
been combined with those older features which gave the 
author’s previous arithmetics such marvelous popularity. 
{ Built upon a definite pedagogical plan, these books teach 
the processes of arithmetic in such a way as to develop the 
reasoning faculties, and to train the power of rapid, accurate, 
and skillful manipulation of numbers. The inductive method 
is applied, leading the pupils to discover truths for them- 
selves ; but it is supplemented by model solutions and careful 
explanations of each step. 
q Each new topic is first carefully developed, and then en- 
forced by sufficient practice to fix it thoroughly in the mind. 
The problems, which have been framed with the greatest care, 
relate to a wide range of subjects drawn from modern life and 
industries. Reviews in various forms are a marked feature. 
Usefulness is the keynote. 
qj In the First and Second Books the amount of work that 
may be accomplished in a half year is taken as the unit of 
classification, and the various subjects are treated topically, 
each being preceded by a brief résumé of the concepts 
already acquired. In the Third Book the purely topical 
method is used in order to give the pupil a coherent 
knowledge of each subject. The Complete Book covers 
the work usually given to pupils during the last four years 
of school.

PENCERS’ PRACTICAL WRITING has been devised 
because of the distinct and wide-spread reaction from the 
use of vertical writing in schools. It is thoroughly up- 
to-date, embodying all the advantages of the old and of the 
new. Each word can be written by one continuous move- 
ment of the pen. 
| The books teach a plain, practical hand, moderate in slant, 
and free from ornamental curves, shades, and meaningless 
lines. ‘The stem letters are long enough to be clear and un- 
mistakable. The capitals are about two spaces in height. 
| The copies begin with words and gradually develop into 
sentences. The letters, both large and small, are taught 
systematically. In the first two books the writing is some- 
what larger than is customary because it is more easily learned 
by young children. These books also contain many illustra- 
tions in outline. The ruling is very simple. 
4 Instruction is afforded showing how the pupil should sit at 
the desk, and hold the pen and paper. A series of drill move- 
ment exercises, thirty-three in number, with directions for 
their use, accompanies each book.

COURSE IN SPELLING 
Complete Ghee «eeia pets atat sed Isls 
Part One. For Third, Fourth, and Fifth Grades . 
Part Two. For Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Grades 
HE purpose of this book is to assist the pupil in using 
words correctly in any one of three relations, viz.: in 
speech, in oral reading, and in written composition. 
Its exercises recognize the laws of association, and provide a 
systematic drill in orthography, orthoepy, word-building, word- 
analysis, and other phases of word-study. 
4|.The vocabulary of the book is made up of words used 
by the pupil in his other studies, and in his every-day 
experience. The work is clearly laid out and graded; 
reviews are amply provided, both by duplication and by 
dictation work. 
{| PART ONE contains a vocabulary of some 4,000 word- 
forms in common use, selected and graded with great care. 
The arrangement is such that there is afforded a variety of 
exercises, each containing an average of 20 words. The 
phonetic, the topical, the grammatical, and the antithetic and 
synonymic methods have received special treatment. Dicta- 
tion exercises, including memory gems, illustrative sentences, 
and reviews, are also given. 
4] PART TWO includes a vocabulary of about 5,000 word- 
forms, the exercises being devoted to topical lessons, phonetic 
“drills, pronouncing drill, grammatical forms, synonyms and 
antonyms, applications of rules of spelling, drill on homo- 
phones, word-building and word-analysis, words the deriva- 
tion of which is indicated, and derivatives from Latin and 
Greek roots. Great emphasis is laid on prefixes and suffixes, 
the origin of words, and pronunciation.

are more widely used in the home, the office, and the 
schoolroom than all others combined. ‘They constitute a com- 
plete and progressive series, carefully graded, and adapted for 
all classes. ‘The spelling and punctuation in all leading school- 
books are based on these dictionaries, which are, therefore, a 
necessity to every teacher. 
{| There have been issued cheap photographic reprints of the 
old editions of Webster’s Dictionaries, and other cheaply made 
up books fraudulently using the Webster name. «These reprints | 
are of editions over fifty years old, and not only are badly 
printed, but do not contain the words in common use to-day.

tinguished by the circular trade mark which appears on the 
cover of each, and by the name of the American Book

    INTRODUCTION. 
Iv has long been recognised that the methods of teaching 
Latin grammar in vogue in England are marked by an 
absence of scientific accuracy and by a neglect of philo- 
logical principles. The conditions that Professor Meillet 
in his foreword to this book describes as existing in France 
obtain in this country as well : ‘Separated from all modern 
conceptions, and still scholastic in its essence and formation, 
grammatical instruction has become a dead element; it 
is confined to facts unconnected by any ideas or connected 
only by ideas which are now obsolete and conflicting with 
everything else learnt by the pupil. Thus every day 
opinion becomes more hostile to grammar, and every year 
fewer hours are assigned to a subject the barren nature 
of which is felt by every one. Yet,’ as the same critic 
continues, ‘it might be thought that a science the essen- 
tial object of which is to study the principal means of 
expression of human thought might deserve the attention 
of schoolboys, and be capable, if properly taught, of 
awakening their lively interest.’ 
In the hope, then, of filling to some extent an admitted 
blank in the public school curriculum, the editors have 
translated this little Book, which has met with a large 
measure of favour on the Continent. It may prove use- 
ful in University courses as well as in schools. It was 7     3969

intended, however, not for students, but for schoolboys 
between the ages of fifteen and eighteen with a sufficient 
grounding in the elements of Latin. The author has 
omitted references to Greek, believing that a large 
majority of such boys know nothing, or next to nothing, 
of that language; and, as Professor Meillet remarks with 
justice, this has also definite advantages from a purely 
scientific point of view: Latin has closer connections 
with Oscan and Umbrian and the Celtic dialects than 
with Greek. 
The translators have compiled an index, but have 
refrained, except in a few instances, from inserting notes, 
not only from reluctance to burden the outline with 
additional matter, but chiefly in the conviction that 
further elucidation and comment should be left to the 
teacher.

Since Latin presents numerous grammatical coincidences 
with Greek, Celtic, Slavonic and several other languages, 
we must conclude that all these languages develop from a

  INTRODUCTION vii 
a common source, that they continue a prehistoric common 
language just as French, Italian, Spanish, etc., continue 
Latin. This prehistoric language is known as the Indo- 
European ; its various transformations, represented by the 
languages to which we have just referred, are called Indo- 
European languages. 
The stem of a word is that part of it which remains 
after the termination is cut off. The termination is the 
variable element which serves to indicate the part played 
by the word in the sentence. Thus diic- is the stem of 
dux, manu- of manus, ama- of amare, and so on. The 
division into stem and termination in Latin is often 
difficult, and in several cases quite impossible without 
the help of its cognate languages. Sometimes the stem 
cannot be reduced further, as, for example, dic in dua, 
but generally it can be split up into two quite distinct 
factors, each of which is found in other combinations. 
Consider, for example, cantu-, the stem of cantus, -iis. 
The element can- is seen also in cano, canor, cantor, etc., 
and the element -tu- in gustus, -iis ; partus, -iis ; sumptus, 
-as, etc. Similarly the analysis of riubé-, the stem of 
riibére shows a factor ru%b- which is contained also in 
ruber, rubor, ribia (‘madder,’ a plant from whose roots 
is made a red dye), and a factor -é- found in calére, 
latére, nitére, etc. Of these two constituent elements of 
the stem the first is called the root, the second the suffix. 
Thus a word consists normally of three parts—root, suffix, 
and termination.!

LATIN PHONETICS. 
PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. 
§ 1. Puonerics is the science dealing with the sounds 
which constitute language. By sounds are meant all the 
impressions that are made on our organs of hearing, 
determined by the modifications which the organs of 
speech produce on the current of breath issuing from the 
lungs. These impressions may be investigated from two 
points of view: (1) from that of their physiological pro- 
duction, and (2) from that of their historical development. 
Indeed, sounds depend for their development on space 
and time. The transformations which they undergo occur 
unconsciously, 7.¢., independently of the will or reflection 
of the speaker. They are brought about by imperceptible 
gradations, and according to unchangeable laws. That is to 
say, all sounds, or groups of sounds, if exposed to identical 
conditions, develop with absolute regularity. Exceptions 
to this rule, which is the fundamental principle of the 
linguistic method, are merely apparent. ‘They are mostly 
to be explained as being the result of disturbances 
in the normal course of phonetic laws brought about 
by a psychological cause, which we call analogy. For 
example, in Latin, in an open medial syllable (7.e., where 
the vowel is followed by a single consonant only), a 
short @ appears unchanged in such words as comédo,
-P-A-G-E-10
2 LATIN PHONETICS 
appéto, obtégo, disséco, subvénio ; while it becomes ? in such 
words as praesédeo ()(sédeo), constiti ()(stéti), colligo 
() (lego), auspicis (genitive of auspéx), susténeo ( )( téneo). 
But we must be careful not to regard this difference of 
treatment as a capricious trick of language. As a matter 
of fact, the transition of ¢ into % took place in all the 
words mentioned ; but analogy has restored the original 
& in comédo, appéto, obtégo, disstéco, subvénio, in order to 
accentuate their affinity with édo, péto, etc. Thus analogy 
acts with a levelling tendency on words related by gram- 
matical function or signification.

GENERAL THEORY OF SOUNDS 3 
GENERAL THEORY OF SOUNDS. 
§ 2. Spoken language is produced by the current of air 
issuing from the mouth in the shape of breath. The 
breath, expelled from the lungs, passes first through the 
windpipe and then into the larynx. The larynx is formed 
of several cartilages, between which are stretched two 
membranes—the vocal chords. Between these again lies a 
slit called the glottis. If the current of breath finds the 
glottis closed, it forces its way out by a series of jerks 
which set the vocal chords in vibration. On the other 
hand, if it finds the glottis open, it passes freely through, 
and sets up no movement of the vocal chords. In the 
former case the sound produced is said to be voiced; in 
the latter case, breathed. A simple method of testing to 
which of these two categories any given -sound belongs is 
to close the ears while uttering the sound. If you hear 
a buzzing noise in the head, the sound produced is voiced ; 
if no buzzing sound is heard, it is breathed. After passing 
through the glottis the breath enters the pharynx, from 
which it escapes through the mouth or the nose, or 
through both exits simultaneously, according as the soft 
palate, a membraneous partition between the cavity of 
the mouth and that of the nose, is raised, depressed, or 
held in balance in an intermediate position by its muscles. 
The mouth plays a double part in sound production. 
Sometimes it serves merely as a sounding-board to the 
sound produced in the larynx; at other times, by a series 
of stoppages, or narrowing processes, it puts various 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  4 LATIN PHONETICS 
obstacles in the way of the breath. Consequently sounds 
are divided into (a) those in the utterance of which 
the mouth cavity maintains unchanged the position it 
has once adopted, and (b) those which depend entirely 
or mainly on a closing or opening movement. The 
former are called vowels; the latter consonants. It is 
important, however, to notice carefully that one cannot 
draw an absolute line between these two classes of 
sounds [eg., the sonant use of consonants J, m, n (also 
ng, 1.¢., %), 7, 2, represented as J, m, etc., spelt, eg., 
rattle, Birmingham, written, can give, as; fr is not 
represented in English, but is common in German, ¢g., 
‘butter.”] On the other hand 7, ou, w are true vowels in 
the French words je lie, je tue, je loue; but as they 
admit of a distinct raising of the tongue, they can act 
also as movements of closing and opening, that is to 
say as consonants; compare nous lions, nous tuons, nous 
louons, where, in modern French, each word is pronounced 
as a monosyllable. With this reservation we may for 
convenience maintain the accepted terms vowel and 
consonant. 
§ 3. Starting with the neutral vowel a, which is pro- 
nounced with the tongue lying loosely on the base of the 
mouth cavity, we may divide the vowels into front and 
back vowels. This distinction is based upon whether the 
tongue lies bunched in the front or the back part of 
the mouth. Another possible division may be drawn 
dependent on the vertical distance between the top of 
the arched part of the tongue and the roof of the hard 
palate. In this way we distinguish between low and high 
yowels, more commonly known as open and close vowels.1

§ 4. Consonants fall into two main categories: close 
or stops, and narrow. The first are characterised by a 
complete stoppage, the latter by a mere narrowing of 
the air passage. The stops are instantaneous explosive 
sounds; the narrow, on the other hand, can be maintained 
for a more or less long time. Hence the stops are some- 
times called ‘momentary’ and the narrow ‘continuous’ 
sounds. The narrow are divided into four categories, 
which are named after the manner in which the air
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 LATIN PHONETICS 
escapes in the process of their production: Fricatives or 
Spirants, Trilled Consonants, Lateral or Divided Con- 
sonants (these last two are often spoken of by the common 
name of Liquids), and Nasals. 
In the production of spirants the current of air finds 
the breath passage of the mouth narrowed, and produces 
a rubbing sound. 
The trilled consonants are determined by the rapid 
vibration against the teeth roots of an elastic organ (the 
uvula or tip of the tongue), which is displaced by the 
breath, and then returns to its former position [or by 
vibration of the flexible parts of the mouth between 
themselves, ¢.g., the lips]. 
Divided consonants are formed when the tip or back of 
the tongue is pressed against the central line of the hard 
palate, from the teeth to the soft palate, and blocks the 
path for the breath, which escapes sideways. 
Finally, the nasals are produced when the mouth is 
closed, but the soft palate lowered, so that the air can 
pass freely through the nose. 
Another division of the consonants may be made accord- 
ing to the place in the mouth where the obstacle arises, 
which conditions the sound characteristic of each. 
[Divided thus there are seven main classes :— 
(1) Velar, back or guttural, formed by the root of the 
tongue and the soft palate (velum), ¢g., ch as in Scotch 
loch (spirant); ng or 2a as in being (nasal). 
(2) Palatal or front, formed by the middle of the tongue 
and the hard palate, ¢.g.,& before ¢ or 7 in such words as 
Kent, kindred (stop). 
(8) Cerebral, formed by the blade of the tongue and the 
front of the hard palate, ¢9g., s=sh, y=2h, as in daze 
(spirant). 
(4) Dental (alveolar), formed by the tip of the tongue
-P-A-G-E-15
GENERAL THEORY OF SOUNDS a 
and the roots of the upper teeth, ¢.g., t as in temper (stop) ; 
sas in swmmer (spirant); as in nowhere (nasal). 
(5) Interdental, formed by the tip of the tongue and the 
tips of the front teeth, ¢.g., th as in then, thin (spirants). 
(6) Labiodental, formed by the lower lip and upper 
teeth, ¢.g., f and v as in fall, veal (spirants). 
(7) Labial, formed by the upper and lower lips, ¢.g., p, 6, 
w, m (and sometimes 7 when used alone as an ejaculation), 
as in pile, beer (stops); woman, man (nasals).]

NoTEs. 
(i.) The place of articulation of the guttural stops is not 
fixed. The tongue touches the palate more or less back 
according to the acoustic quality of the following vowel. 
Before ¢ and ¢ the position is at the hard palate; before a 
at the middle of the palate, i.¢, half-way between the 
hard and soft palates ; before o and wu at the back part of 
palate, i.¢., the soft palate or velum. It is probable that 
in O.L, the use of the three symbols ¢, &, g, corresponded 
to these three positions. Indeed, it seems that originally 
c was as a rule written before i and e¢ (civis, céna), k before 
a (kipitit, kirus), q before o and wu (gimés, gira). Gradually, 
however, the use of ¢ became general; & disappeared and 
left but a few traces in certain abbreviations, e.g., K=Kaeso 
(proper name), K or KAL=ciilendae, KA =ctipitalis, KK =cast- 
rorum, ete. ; while g was retained only in the combination qu, 
which denoted the breathed labialised guttural in words 
like qui, quae, quod (§ 39). Latin recognised also two kinds 
of the narrow divided J, which was articulated sometimes 
at the root of the upper front teeth (palatal 7) ; sometimes 
at the soft or velar palate (velar 2). The 7 was palatal, 
(a) when initial; (}) when medial before 7; (c) in cases 
of doubled 77. It was velar (a) when final; (5) when 
medial before ¢, a, 0, u, and before a consonant. 
(ii.) The sound represented by Latin f was originally 
formed by pressing the lips together. But ata relatively 
early period this bilabial! changed into a labiodental f, 
which, as in English, French, and German was produced 
by the pressure exercised by the upper front teeth on the 
lower lip. 
(iii.) 22 denotes the guttural nasal, for which the Latin 
alphabet like English, French, and German possessed no 
special symbol. Before a guttural stop this sound was 
written n, as in angulus and anceps; before a nasal, g as 
in dignus (§ 69). The poet Accius (170-94 B.c.), proposed to 
employ g before gutturals as well, as was done in Greek. 
Thus instead of angulus, anceps, ancora, etc., he would

Latin by fh, ¢.g., FHEFHAKED, the old form of fecit.]

have written aggulus, agceps, agcora. His suggestion, how- 
ever, was not adopted. 
(iv.) In the scheme given above the following letters are 
omitted :— 
(1) kh, which was mute in classical times as in modern 
French (§ 44). 
(2) j and v, which were semi-vowels, at least as late as 
the first century A.D., ¢.e., consonantal forms of the vowels 
zandu. Their sounds were equivalent to those heard in 
zand wu respectively in the French pierre (pronounced pyér 
and échouer (pronounced échwé). The use of the letters j 
and » dates from modern times. Their introduction is due 
to the scholars of the Renaissance. In this book these 
convenient symbols will be employed to represent initial 
consonantaliandw. The Latin alphabet, however, knew 
only ¢ and w. 
(3) The voiced dental spirant z, which was unknown in 
genuine Latin words, ¢f. Quintilian, Instit. Orat., xii. 10, 
28; namque est ipsis statim sonis durior (i.e., Latina 
facundia) quando et jucundissimas ex Graecis litteras non 
habemus, vocalem alteram, alteram consonantem, quibus 
nullae apud eos dulcius spirant, quas mutuari solemus 
quotiens illorum nominibus utimur—quod cum contingit, 
nescio quomodo velut hilarior protinus renidet oratio, ut in 
zephyris et zophoris: quae si nostris litteris scribantur, 
surdum quiddam et barbarum efficient. 
(4) The breathed aspirate stops ch, ph, th, originally 
restricted to Greek loanwords borrowed at a compara- 
tively late period, such as chdrus, machina, philirum (a 
love charm), romphaea (a broad-sword), thésawrus, cithira. 
Under the influence of these aspiration was introduced, 
it is true, from the end of the second century B.C., in a 
certain number of words of genuine Latin origin, as in 
pulcher (the pronunciation pulcer was obsolete in Cicero’s 
time, as he himself informs us, cf. Orator, 48, § 160); s%pul- 
chrum (a pronunciation which in Cicero’s time was not 
common, and one which Cicero personally rejects (cf. 
Orator, loc. cit.), limpha (spring water), sulphur, ete. 
(§ 35).

the names given to the letters denoting the consonants (f,

l,m, n, 7, 8, being called ef, ell, emm, enn, ar, ess, while on 
the other hand, }, c, d, g, k, p, q, t are called bee, cee, dee, 
gee, kay, pee, kew, tee) goes back to ancient times with the 
reservation that until the second half of the fourth century 
A.D. the letters of the first group named /, J, m, etc., were 
pronounced without any supporting vowel. Thus up to 
this time they were ‘litterae per se nominativae sive quae 
per se prolatae nomen suum ostendunt’ (Charisius, i. p. 9, 
4 K and Priscian, ii. p. 8, 10 K) just like a, e, 7, 0, wu 
Hence the Roman grammarians called them semivocales 
in opposition to }, ¢, d, g, ete., which were called mutae ; 
‘quod per se sine adminiculo vocalium non possunt enun- 
tiari’ (Diomedes, i. p. 428, 24 K). 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
LATIN ACCENTUATION 13 
LATIN ACCENTUATION. 
§ 7. In the sound groups which we call words, one of 
the syllables in each word may be brought into promin- 
ence either by strong muscular effort or by a more or less 
marked elevation of the voice. 
The degree of prominence obtained by special energy 
in articulation forms the stress accent, or, shortly, ‘the 
accent’; that which is due to the change from a lower to 
a higher musical note makes the pitch accent or tone. 
Now, accent and tone may exist simultaneously in one 
and the same language. This was the case in pre-literary 
Latin. Independently of the alternations, inherited from 
the Indo-European language, of high and low syllables, a 
sharply-marked stress accent had begun to mark the first 
syllable of words. But at the beginning of the literary 
period this stress accent disappeared, as it was ill-suited 
to the genius of the Latin language, in which the quan- 
tity of the syllables was strictly marked. From the 
second century B.c. down to the fourth century a.p., 
Latin possessed merely a pitch accent or tone, the place 
of which was regulated by the quantity of the penultimate 
syllable. 
There are no traces left to show that before the Romance 
period the pitch accent exercised any influence whatever 
on the sound system of Latin. On the other hand, the 
initial stress accent has profoundly altered the original 
vowels of medial syllables by strengthening ‘the initial 
syllable at their expense. Still, it is remarkable that this 
influence is manifest only in the short vowels. Not only
-P-A-G-E-22
  14 LATIN PHONETICS 
did the long vowels, in spite of the influence of the stress 
accent, maintain both their acoustic quality and length, 
but it was nothing else than the struggle between the 
long and the stressed syllables—which gave rise to two 
opposed rhythms—that caused the initial stress accent to 
disappear. 
[Wote.—The views above given are those traditionally 
held by French scholars. The Germans maintain, almost 
without exception, that even in historical times the stress 
accent was far stronger than the musical one, and they 
explain the evidence of the Roman grammarians, which 
is suitable only to a musical accent, as mere thoughtless 
application of the terms used by Greek scholars when 
discussing Greek piteh accent.]

DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATIN VOWELS 15 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATIN VOWELS. 
Changes due to Initial Stress Accent. 
§ 8. The results of initial stress accentuation may be 
referred to two main phenomena :— 
(1) Change of the timbre or acoustic quality of short 
medial vowels: umlaut, or Vowel-weakening, 
(2) The disappearance or Syncope of short medial 
vowels. 
It has not yet been possible to draw a definite line of 
demarcation between these two classes : 7.¢., to explain why 
in one word the vowel has disappeared, instead of being 
merely weakened, and vice versd. All that we can safely 
say is that vowel-weakening invariably comes into opera- 
tion where syncope has not taken place. 
Vowel-weakening (umlaut). 
§ 9. The weakening of short medial vowels under the 
influence of the initial stress accent varied, according as 
these vowels occurred in an open or close syllable, ¢.e., 
according as whether only one or more consonants followed 
them. We have therefore to examine their treatment 
separately in either of these two positions. 
A. Vowel-weakening in an Open Medial Syllable. 
§ 10. In an open medial syllable, except before r and 
after 7, all short vowels, without regard to their original 
acoustic quality, passed into one of the two closest short 
   
-P-A-G-E-24
  LATIN PHONETICS 
vowels i or i. The appearance of % or % depended on the 
nature of the neighbouring sounds. Thus we have :— 
(1) i before d, ¢, n, g, ¢; 
(2) i before 7 followed by 7, but % before Z followed 
by any other vowel; 
(3) { or & respectively before the labial sounds 6, p, 
J, m; it has not as yet been possible to formulate 
definitely the laws which decided on the choice 
of the one rather than the other.

ferimus, legimus, but posstimus, voliimus. 
specimen, but doci#mentum. 
In the case of the superlatives in -émus and -d#mus, as 
optimus and optimus, Quintilian tells us that the medial 
vowel which was weakened represented a sound half-way 
between 7 and % (Insti. Orat., i. 4, 8: medius est quidam 
w et @ litterae sonus: non enim opt#mum dicimus aut 
optimum). He states also that w was the archaic and ¢ 
the classical spelling (ib., i. 7, 21): jam optimus, maximus, 
ut mediam litteram quae veteribus w fuerat acciperent, 
Gai primum Caesaris inscriptione traditur factum. This 
remark is generally confirmed by the orthography of the 
inscriptions and the best manuscripts, which permits us 
to apply it further to a certain number of other words 
belonging to this third group (¢f eg., the genitive man- 
cupis, mancipis ; manvfestus, manvfestus mentioned above). 
At the same time it is to be noticed that as regards 
mintmus no form min#mus appears to be proved, and 
this fact, together with the contrast of ferémus, legimus, 
with poss#mus, vol#mus, and of specimen with doc#men- 
tum, seems to suggest a certain influence exercised by 
the vowel of the first syllable on the acoustic quality of 
the vowel of the second syllable. In other cases, as in 
that of acc%pio )( occ%po, it seems more probable that 
the vowel of the syllable which followed determined the 
acoustic quality of that which was weakened.

value of é.

§ 13. In a closed medial syllable & became ¢ irrespective 
of its neighbouring sounds; 0 became % from the end of 
the third century B.c., except after «w, whether vocal or 
consonantal, when it was retained in writing until the 
commencement of the Augustan Era.!' The other vowels

Effect of Analogy and Particular Cases. 
§ 14. The regular action of these laws that effected 
the vowel weakenings was frequently crossed by analogy. 
Thus, for instance, the compounds comédo, dedécus, 
posthdbeo, perfdcilis, convdco, bifdris, dispito, impédicus, 
illécrimor, subréncidus, addpto, etc., were remodelled 
on the simple words édo, décus, habeo, facilis, vdco, foris 
(generally in the plural fdres) puto, pddicus, ldcrimo, 
rdncidus, dpto. The form which followed the natural 
law of sound change is found sometimes retained in 
1 [Properly a neuter noun.)
-P-A-G-E-29
  DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATIN VOWELS 21 
popular speech. Thus, to take one example, the written 
language recognised only the form sepdro (from séd, a 
prefix denoting separation, and paro, ‘I put on an equal 
footing’! (§ 57)), which was due to analogy. Certain vulgar 
texts, however, exhibit sepéro, and their testimony finds 
confirmation in the Romance languages, ¢.g., Fr. sevrer, 
‘to wean,’ ‘to deprive’; sepdrare would have produced 
*severer [thus the Romance languages seem to postulate 
alécrem beside aldcrem; of. Grandgent, Introduction to 
Vulgar Latin, § 194]. 
In corpéris, gen. of corpus, decdris of decus, tempéris 
of tempus, which stand for * corpéris, * decéris, * tempéris, 
where the ¢ should, according to rule, have been main- 
tained, 0 comes from the old nominatives * corpds, * decds, 
*tempds: the regular vowel has maintained itself in the 
adverb tempéri (‘at the right time,’ ‘punctually’). This 
word was exempted from the influence of analogy by the 
fact that it did not fall under the regular paradigm. 
In other cases the result of the laws of vowel-weakening 
is obscured by later changes independent of the initial 
stress accent. In this way we must explain, ¢g., attingo 
instead of *atténgo )( tdéngo (§ 16); ins#lsus instead of 
*insélsus )( sdélsus (§ 17); secli#do instead of * secléudo 
)(cldéudo (§ 22). With regard to the last example, it 
should be noted that of the two factors in the diphthong 
au in claudo, the former was the more emphasised ; hence, 
the second, uw, instead of being prolonged was dropped 
immediately, or, in other words, this w« became con- 
sonantal (§ 6, iv. 2). Thus the & of cldéudo stood before 
two consonants (vd), and the compounds of this verb 
consequently take, according to rule, the form *-cléudo, 
1 [For paro in this sense cf. Pl, Curc., 4, 2, 20: eodem hercle vos pono 
et paro: parissumi estis iibus.]
-P-A-G-E-30

which, as already mentioned, passed, at a later period, 
into -clédo. Compare also :— 
caus(s)a ; accis(s)o. 
caedo (O.L. caido (§ 20)); cectdi: intermediate stage 
*ceceidi (§ 19). 
laedo (O.L. laido); illido: intermediate stage *illeido. 
Syncope. 
§ 15. In contrast with vowel-weakening syncope does 
not seem to have been brought about merely by initial 
stress accent, though it is certain that this was the 
principal factor in the process. ‘The examples to be cited 
immediately show indeed that the complete loss of the 
short medial vowel was often connected with the length 
of the following syllable. But it is not sufficient to hold 
quantity as responsible for all the phenomena of syncope. 
There must have been other factors as well, but in the 
present state of our knowledge, we can say nothing 
decisive concerning their character. 
Syncope has not always entailed the loss of a syllable. 
In fact, in those words where syncope took place in 
immediate proximity to a j or a », these last sounds 
became vowel sounds, and, unless following a vowel, 
maintained in the word the original number of syllables. 
EXAMPLES. 
(a) Syncope is caused by the combined action of the 
stress accent, and the length of the following syllable :— 
ardére )( aridus. 
disciplina )( disciptlus. 
infra ) ( inftrus, ‘lower’ (¢.g., mare inferum, ‘the lower,’ 
ae, ‘the Tyrrhenian Sea’), 
supra )(supérus, ‘upper’ (¢.g. mare superum, ‘the 
upper,’ i.e, ‘the Adriatic Sea’). 
valdé )( validus.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATIN VOWELS) 23 
Thus the paradigm of a word like calédus was originally :— 
Nom. calidus. 
Ace. calidum, 
Gen. caldi, 
Dat. and Abl. caldo, 
But this original condition did not remain unchanged. 
On the one hand analogy extended the syncopated form 
to the nominative and accusative, and thus produced the 
duplicate form caldus ; a form used, according to Quintilian 
CInstit. Orat., i. 6, 19), by the Emperor Augustus in 
preference to calidus which he considered pedantic and 
affected: ‘sed Augustus quoque in epistulis ad C. Caesarem 1 
scriptis emendat quod is calédum dicere quam caldum malit, 
non quia id non sit Latinum, sed quia sit otiosum.’ On 
the other hand analogy restored the syncopated vowel 
in the genitive, dative, and ablative. The explanation 
given above of caldus holds equally good for soldus, 
‘solid,’ ‘complete,’ ‘the whole sum’ (cf eg., Horace, 
Sat. i. 2, 113: 
Quaerere plus prodest et inane abscindere soldo ? 
and ii. 5, 65: 
Filia Nasicae metuentis reddere soldum). 
as against solidus; raucus, ‘hoarse,’ from *r&v(Z)cus, 
derived from rivis, ‘hoarseness,’ etc. 
(6) Syncope is caused by the combined action of the 
stress accent, and of a second factor other than the 
length of the following syllable, but which cannot be 
defined more precisely.

auceps from *av(i)ceps.

from *rec(2)cidi, *rep(2)puli, *ret(2)tuli (tetuli as perfect

In the compounds of jacio, the regular form according 
to the law of sound change, -icio, was replaced from the 
classical period onwards by the form -jicio, if not written, 
at least pronounced in this way, as the metrical scansion 
of abicio, adicio, conicio, obicio, subicio proves; the 
prefix of these words is always long by position in lyrical 
poetry and in the classical period. Vergil, for instance, 
begins a hexameter with obicit, Aen., vi. 421, and vii. 
480, and Aulus Gellius expressly remarks of subicit that 
the 7 of the root syllable ‘vim consonantis capit et idcirco 
ea syllaba productius latiusque paulo pronuntiata priorem 
syllabam brevem esse non patitur, sed reddit eam positu 
longam,’ Noct. Att., 4, 17, 8. This innovation was due 
to analogy: conjicio for conicio, for example, was formed 
on a model like conficio according to the formula facio:

L. Cornelius Scipio, consul 259 B.c.; while the S. C. de 
Bacchanalibus (186 B.c.) exhibits already aedem). 
quaero from quairo: quairatis appears as an archaic 
form beside aetatem on the burial inscription of a Scipio, 
dating probably from 180 B.c. 
In the low country round Rome ae ceased at an early 
period to be a diphthong. Indeed Varro informs us 
that the peasants in his time said Mesius and edus for 
Maesius and haedus: (de lingua Latina vii. 96: rustici 
pappum Mesium non Maesium; ¢f. also vy. 97). [An 
attempt to change the name Caecilius to the popular 
form Cecilius (like Claudius to Clodius), was successfully 
laughed down by Lucilius: ‘Cecilius pretor ne rusticu’ 
fiat,’ Lindsay, S. H. Gr., § 2 note]. Under the Empire 
this pronunciation gradually gained ground, and finally 
became general. The 4, arising from an older ae, was 
open (@), in contrast with the original @ which was 
close (2). Thus, when towards the end of the Empire 
Latin ceased to distinguish the quantity of the vowels 
and retained merely the differences of acoustic quality, 
ae became completely assimilated to ¢ (i.e. ¢), while on 
the other hand original 2 (i.¢., ¢) remained always sharply 
distinguished from it. This is proved by the Romance 
languages in which ae and @ led to the same result, 
whereas @ was treated differently: of Lat. quaerit > 
Fr. quiert; Lat, héri > Fr. hier, as against Lat. céra > 
Fr, cire,
-P-A-G-E-35
  
DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATIN VOWELS 27 
§ 21. o¢ from the beginning of the second century B.c. 
passed first into ve and then into @. 
EXAMPLES. 
anus from oinos (oino = wnum in the burial inscription 
of L. Cornelius Scipio, mentioned above); oenus in 
Plautus, 7ruculentus, 104, 
communis from commoinis (comoinem in S., C, de 
Bacchanalibus, 186 B.¢.). 
asus from oisos; of. Martianus Capella,! iii. 236: oisus 
etiam dicitur; sic enim veteres usum dixere. 
In a certain number of words the spelling o¢ was 
maintained even long after the pronunciation was w. 
Thus mwrus is often written moerus as late as the 
manuscripts of Vergil. Finally, by a reaction of the 
written language on the pronunciation, oe was restored 
in pronunciation in cases like poena ()(pwnire), mocnia 
() (murus), ete. 
In the case of coepi the ve does not represent the Indo- 
European diphthong 07, but is a later contraction of 6 + @: 
coepi from cd—épi (for the trisyllabic scansion ~-~ ef. 
Lucretius, iv. 619, si quis forte manu premere ac siccare 
coepit, ¢f Monro ad loc.), contains the perfect of a verb 
apio, ‘to join,’ which seems to have become obsolete at an 
early date [hence apiscor and aptus]. 
§ 22. ew passed into ow and later into @ (see § 23). As 
the transition from eu to ow took place before the commence- 
ment of written tradition, Latin itself shows us no example 
of the original diphthong ew. But on the one hand, com- 
parison with the related languages compels the conclusion 
that the % of déco, for example, goes back to a primitive 
ew (the intervening grade ow is guaranteed by the form 
1 [(Flor. circ. 410-427 a.D.). The African scholar who wrote the Ency- 
clopedia of the Seven Liberal Arts.]

abdoucit found in a sepulchral inscription belonging to the 
beginning of the second century B.c. Secondly, the laws 
of vowel-weakening entitle us to trace back accés(s)o, for 
example, to *adcews(s)o ; which in its turn arose regularly 
from *adcaus(s)o, derived from caus(s)a, ‘a lawsuit’ 
(§ 14). 
For the apparent exceptions cew, new, duplicate form of 
neve, sew of sive, and neuter, the remarks made on coepi 
apply. In all these words ew arises from a later contraction 
ofe+wu. As to neuter it is not even certain that this word 
was ever pronounced in prose in any other way than as a 
trisyllable, ne-uter. 
§ 28. ow passed into # towards the end of the third 
century B.C. 
EXAMPLES. 
lucus, ‘grove,’ properly, ‘clearing in a wood’ [¢f. 
collicare, ‘to make a clearing,’ connected with liceo], 
from lowcos, which is found in an old inscription from 
Spoletium. 
Natrix, ‘nurse,’ from nowtrix, found in an old dedicatory 
inscription, from Nemi [¢/., however, Lindsay, S. H. L. G., 
p. 153). 
§ 24. aw was maintained in the written Latin of 
Rome. But in the dialects of the adjacent districts, 
and in the popular language of the capital itself, aw 
passed into 6 at an early period. This double treatment 
of aw sometimes caused confusion, as in instances 
containing @ it naturally remained doubtful if the & 
represented a primitive 0, or an au which had become 
o in popular speech. Suetonius in his biography of the 
Emperor Vespasian, § 22, tells the following anecdote on 
this point: (Vespasianus) Mestrium Fldrum consularem, 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATIN VOWELS 29 
admonitus ab eo plaustra potius quam pldstra dicenda, 
postero die Flawrum salutavit. In doubtful cases those 
who prided themselves on correct pronunciation, preferred 
au, even at the risk of introducing it into words where 
properly it did not belong. 
In this way plaudo replaced plddo, although the latter 
word contained an original 4, as is shown by the com- 
pounds complddo, displédo, explédo. In fact, if plaudo 
contained an original aw, we should have the forms 
*complido, * displédo, * explido (§ 14). [aw- of aufugio, 
aufero represents an Indo-European preposition dwé, 
which was used in these compounds before an initial 
to avoid confusion with the compounds of ad, e.g., affero, 
Lindsay, S. H. L. G., p. 129.—Umbrian and Faliscan had 
o in place of Latin aw: so, in general, the dialects of 
Northern and Central Italy. Grandgent, § 211.] 
B. Changes of Quantity in Syllables not Final. 
(a) Lengthening of Short Vowels. 
§ 25. A short vowel received compensatory lengthening— 
(1) In cases of the loss of an s before voiced consonants 
(§ 86). 
EXAMPLES, 
dinosco from *disnosco. 
éduco from *éxduco (#=¢s). 
idem from *is-dem (is+dem), 
pono from *pis(ijno; ¢f. the participle positus = pd 
(prefix) +situs, perf. part. pass. of sino, 
sédecim from *séxdecim. 
(2) Before -nf- and -ns-, because in this combination 
the nasal lost its character as stop, and the vibrations
-P-A-G-E-38
  30 LATIN PHONETICS 
of the ligaments of the glottis that caused the sound 
were added to the preceding vowel (§ 87). 
Cicero, Orator, 48, 159: quid vero hoc elegantius, quod 
non fit natura, sed quodam instituto, indoctus dicimus 
brevi prima littera, 7nsanus producta, tmhumanus brevi, 
tnfelix longa et, ne multis, quibus in verbis eae primae 
litterae sunt quae in ‘sapiente’ atque ‘felice,’ producte 
dicitur in, in ceteris omnibus breviter: itemque cdnposuit, 
consuevit, cdncrepuit, cdnfecit: consule veritatem, repre- 
hendet; refer ad aures, probabunt. These remarks of 
Cicero are confirmed by the inscriptions which show at 
the same time that the lengthening process in question 
was not confined to the 7 of the prefix %m- and the 6 of 
the prefix cdn-. In fact, in the Latin epigraphic records, 
every kind of vowel occurring before one of the two com- 
binations -n/- and -ns- is frequently marked as long by a 
special sign, the so-called apex. Further, as the Greek 
alphabet possessed two different letters for é and @ and 
also for 6 and 0d, the Greek transcription of Latin words 
in inscriptions and in authors may also to some extent 
give us information as to the quantity of vowels before 
-nf- or -ns-, and this evidence is absolutely i in favour of 
their having been long. 
Amongst other instances which might be cited, a passage 
in Quintilian (Jnstit. Orat., i. 7,29) proves that the fore- 
going are really cases of compensatory lengthening. He 
remarks that in the word cénsiiles the nasal n was not 
pronounced (. . . consules exempta n littera legimus) [just 
as it disappeared in O. Eng. fif (Germ. finf), gos, ‘goose’ 
(Germ. gans), Lindsay, p. 11]. 
§ 26. Irrespective of the lengthening by compensation, 
a short vowel was lengthened in perfect participles passive,
-P-A-G-E-39
DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATIN VOWELS 31 
in the case of verbs whose root ended with a voiced 
consonant, and again in the verbal and noun forms derived 
from these participles (§ 62, 1). 
EXAMPLES. 
actus, léctus, part. from dgo, légo. 
(The length of the root syllables in these two participles 
is proved by the testimony of Aulus Gellius, Noctes 
Atticae, ix. 6, and xii. 3, and also by the apex in numerous 
inscriptions). 
cdsus, visus, participles from cddo, video (§ 83), but 
factus (participle of facio). 
(If the a of factus had been long, the compounds would 
have been *confactus,xeffactus, etc., instead of confectus 
effectus, as is the case, cf. idactus.) 
méssus, part. of méto (§ 83). 
(That the % in messus was short may be shown as 
follows: towards the end of the first century B.C., -ss- 
following a long vowel was simplified into -s-; conse- 
quently had messus contained a long ¢, it would have at 
that period appeared in the form *mesus, which is not 
the case (§ 58).) 
In the same way we have dctito, frequentative of ago 
[¢f. ambéges], protéctor, as against féctito, séctio. 
Exceptions like séssus, part. of sédeo, fssus, part. of 
foédio, arose probably under the influence of analogy. 
(b.) Shortening of Long Vowels. 
§ 27. In the classical period every long vowel that was 
followed, but not preceded by another vowel, was shortened. 
EXAMPLES. 
finio )( the infinitive finire. 
pius (in O.L. pius: a hexameter of Ennius begins with 
the words pectora pia tenet desiderium). 
ra gen. of rés (but didi gen. of dizs, glacizi gen. of glaciés, 
because in these words the é was not only followed but also 
preceded by a vowel).  
-P-A-G-E-40
  32 LATIN PHONETICS 
figo )( the imperfect flzbam. 
griis, gen. of gras, ‘a crane.’ 
stio )( sitor, ‘a cobbler’ [sabula, ‘an awl’), 
The classical poets scan as a rule illzus, ipstus, unzus ; 
but in prose the accepted pronunciation, at least in 
Quintilian’s time, was illzus, ips?us, un?us (Instit. Orat., 
i. 5, 18, unvus extra carmen non deprendas). The 
reasons for the restoration of the long quantity in 
these genitives have not been sufficiently elucidated. 
[It has been suggested that they may be due to the 
long vowel 7 in the datives ill?, ips?, unz.] On the other 
hand when Servius, the commentator on Vergil, informs 
us that in the perfect of audire and lenire prose writers 
insisted on audzit, lenzit, in opposition to the scansion 
audvit, lenvit of the poets, the influence of analogy is 
obvious: audzit and lenzit are formed after their dupli- 
cate forms aud?vit, lenzvit, in which cases the 7 was not 
followed by a vowel, and hence could not be shortened. 
In the same way fio is a case of substitution for *fio, 
following fts, fémus. 
(For a difficult case of the shortening of a long vowel in 
a syllable not concluding a word see below, § 55). 
C. Changes of Acoustic Quality in Final Syllables. 
§ 28. In cases where & absolutely terminates a word it 
remains unchanged ; compare generd, frigord, nom. and ace. 
plur. of genus and frigus; ité; where the short quantity 
of final @ is proved by the evidence of the other Indo- 
European languages to be original. In other cases final & 
is secondary, 7.¢., it comes from the shortening of an a 
(see pita below, §31, 3). 
With regard to the other original short vowels when 
absolutely final, they seem one and all to have taken on

the acoustic quality of e. Linguistic testimony, however, 
is too scanty to provide positive proof except in the case 
of 7, of. maré, nom. and acc. sing. )( marza nom. and ace. 
plur. ; lené, neuter )( len%s, masc. and fem. 
§ 29. When not absolutely final, the short vowels were 
treated quite differently. In the case of words of one 
syllable they underwent no change. In words of two or 
more syllables. 7 and % remained, and likewise ¢, except 
before s, when it became 7; & before two consonants 
developed in the same way as in a medial syllable, 
ae, it passed into &; as to its treatment before a single 
consonant, nothing certain can be said in the absence of 
decisive examples. Finally, 6 became % in the nom. and 
ace. sing. of the 2nd declension, in the nom. and acc. 
sing. of neuter substantives of the 8rd declension, and in 
the 3rd pers. plur. indic. of the present and perfect of 
verbs. This change of 5 goes back to the end of the 
third century B.c., in words where ¢ was not preceded by 
wu or v. After w and v, 6 changed to % only after the 
beginning of the Empire.

    34 LATIN PHONETICS 
Cases like dés%, -sidis, dives, -itis are merely 
apparent exceptions. In fact désts goes back to 
a form *deséd-s, and divés to a form *divét-s (§ 68). 
Thus the 2 of words of this type did not, as in the 
examples just given, stand originally before s; and 
this fact explains its retention. 
(c) aucéps from *iv(i) -c&p-s (avis + capio). 
réméx from *rem-dg-s (remus + ago). 
auriféx from *auri-fic-s (aurum + facio).

Spits from dps, nom. and ace, sing. 
consentitint from consentiint, 8rd pers. plur., present 
indic. consentio. 
dederiint from dedervnt, 3rd pers. plur., perf. indice. of do. 
The forms filits, vir’m, dondm, opds, co(n)sentidnt, 
dederént, are testified to partly by inscriptions, partly by 
quotations in Latin authors, ¢/., for example, Quintilian, 
Instit. Orat., i. 4, 16. With regard to words like bidusm, 
equés, vivint, modern editions of Caesar, for example, 
ought not to give the forms biduwm, equus, vivunt. In- 
scriptions prove unmistakably that these forms with u 
were later than the Republican era; thus their introduc- 
tion into a text like the Beli. Gall. is an anachronism. 
§ 30. Long vowels, whether absolutely final or in the last 
syllable, suffered no qualitative changes. On the other 
hand, the diphthongs which occurred in either of these 
positions became long vowels. Of these it is especially 
important to note (i.) that e, ai, ot became 7; and (ii.) 
that ow became #.

Sometimes the original diphthong is attested by inscrip- 
tions (e.g. sibei appears in the S. C. de Bacch.), or by 
quotations made by grammarians (as by Paulus Diaconus,? 
p. 14,17 Th.: ab oloes dicebant pro ab illis), but generally 
speaking its existence is revealed only by a comparison 
with the other Indo-European languages, 
As then ai was represented by 7, the termination ae in 
the gen. and dat. sing. and in the nom. and voc. plur. 
of words of the 1st declension cannot have arisen from ad. 
As a matter of fact it represented rather an older dz; ¢f.

affected, xi., 90, 5; attonitusque legis ‘terrai frugiferai,’ 
see S. H. L. G., p. 44]. 
D. Changes of Quantity in Final Syllables. 
§ 31. The vowel element of a final syllable tended to 
undergo abbreviation of length. This is shown in the 
following cases :— 
1. Every short vowel standing absolutely last was 
reduced to a fraction of the unity of length, and accord- 
ingly showed a tendency to disappear entirely. 
EXAMPLES. 
The imperatives dic, dit, fac, fér )( c&pé, mitté, tundé, ete. 
The duplicate forms ic (§ 82) and atqué; néc (§ 82) and 
néqué (it should be noted that ac and nec were generally

used before a word that began with a consonant, and that 
hence the disappearance of terminal 2 cannot be due to 
elision); neu and nevé. 
tot from * tot; of. totidem. 
2. Every long vowel was shortened before any consonant 
other than s.

lictdr, gen. lictéris. 
cantabim, but cantabdés; punit, but punis; sp%m, ace, of 
spés. 
3. In cases of absolute finals of iambic dissyllables 
Old Latin poetry could count every long vowel as short ; 
and there is no doubt that this rule of scansion reflected 
the ordinary pronunciation of the age. On the other 
hand, the classical usage admitted the scansion v» only 
in the case of certain words used to help out a phrase, 
and so constantly employed that they were actually 
pronounced less completely than the other words in the 
phrase. 
EXAMPLES.

cits, mods )( ed, ‘thither,’ retré. 
putdé, ‘for instance,’ properly ‘bring into a line of 
reckoning,’ imp. of putare; hav’, ‘hail!’, properly 
‘rejoice,’ imp. from (h)avére (the pronunciation avé was 
characterised by Quintilian as pedantic, Instit. Orat., 
i, 6, 21), but ama, docé.

several inscriptions of the second century B.C.; e > %

as voluptatem, égéstatem, fer’ntarium, where the syllable

the law of the Brevis Brevians. An example is found 
in Catullus (1xi. '77)— 
virgo adest, vidén ut faces 
splendidas quatiunt comas.] 
£. Contraction of Vowels. 
§ 32, When two adjacent vowels made a hiatus, that 
is to say, when the change from the first to the second 
was brought about by a sharp interrupted movement in 
the utterance, they were as a rule contracted, ¢.¢., they 
coalesced into a single vowel or a diphthong. That was 
the case in combinations of the type i+7, e+e, a+a, 0+0, 
u+u, O+i%, o+e, etc. When, on the other hand, the 
transition was effected by a light gliding movement with- 
out break of continuity—in other words, when there was 
no hiatus—the two vowels remained uncontracted. This 
was the treatment of the combinations i+any other vowel 
except 7, and u-+any other vowel except u. However, the 
combinations é+@ and &+46, although belonging to the 
former of the two categories just mentioned, seem never 
to have undergone contraction. 
The most obvious and common examples of this process 
are the following :— 
t+i=0 
nil from ni(h)il; mi from mi(h)z. 
é+é=6 
némo from * né-(h)%mo (hemo =homois attested by Paulus 
Diaconus, p. 71, 18 Th.). 
dzmo from * dz-¢mo ; dégi, perfect of dégo (contracted from 
* dé-igo (see below) from * dé-2gi), 
a+a=4, 
latrina from 1é(v)atrina. 
+6=0, 
cdpia from * e3-dpia (¢f. in-dpia). 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
    
38 LATIN PHONETICS 
coram, adv. and from Cicero’s time preposition, from * c3- 
6ram (the second part of the compound is connected 
with 6s, Gris; for the termination ¢f, clam and palam), 
[These terminations are adverbial acc. sing. fem. forms.] 
G+u=%. 
junior, comparative from juvenis, from * jtinior (§ 15d). 
é+a=6 
dégo from * dé-digo. 
O+%t=08. 
coctus, a gathering, from c¥-itus. 
O+é=0, 
cémo from * c3-2mo; contio from * cd(v)éntio (§ 50). 
o+é=08, 
coepi from o%-2pi (§ 21). 
o+a=0, 
cégo from * cd-ago. 
copula, from * cd-dpula (&pére in O,.L. meant ‘to fasten’ 
(§ 21). 
In a number of cases analogy restored the uncontracted 
form. Thus mh? was contracted according to rule to mz, 
but restored later on the analogy of tibi and sibi which 
always remained disyllabic. 
The same remark applies to déésse beside désse, dédémo 
)( dago, cddlesco )( cdgo, etc. The contrast between the 
present cago and the perfect cdégi, the latter of which 
was restored by analogy, while the former escaped this 
influence, may be due to the fact that in cdgo the con- 
traction goes back to a very old date, while the coalescence 
of 5+ into oe seems, on the contrary, to be comparatively 
recent; thus the perfect was more accessible to the influ- 
ence of analogy than the present. It should be added, 
however, that generally speaking the chronology of the 
laws of Latin contraction is an exceedingly obscure subject, 
and it seems improbable that it will ever be satisfactorily 
elucidated. 
Synizesis must not be confused with contraction. By
-P-A-G-E-47
  DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATIN VOWELS 39 
synizesis is meant the liberty taken in prosody, according 
to which two vowels in juxtaposition, although both pro- 
nounced, count in scansion as a single syllable: cf, Vergil, 
Georgies, iv. 34: 
Seu lento fuerint alvéaria vimine texta. 
Aen. vii. 190 : 
Auré’ percussum virga versumque venenis. 
Ovid, Met., ix, 143.

but compare, eg , 
Vergil, Georg., iii, 167. 
cervici subnecte ; dehine, ubi libera colla, 
Ablaut or Vowel Gradation. 
§ 33. Besides the vowel weakening apparent in conficio ) ( 
facio ; exsulto ) ( salto ; volo ) ( velim ; infra ) ( inférus ; rém 
)(rés, etc., which, as we have already seen, have their 
origin in the separate development of Latin, and conse- 
quently are peculiar to this language, there are other 
vowel changes which are found also in the allied languages, 
and presumably go back to the Indo-European. As a 
matter of fact, from the period when the Indo-European 
stock was still undivided, each of the three component 
parts of a word, 2.¢., root, suffix, and termination (pp. v, vii) 
could assume different types of vowel system to indicate 
different types of formation. This morphological process, 
originally closely adhered to, is known under the name of 
ablaut or vowel gradation. 
Ablaut is strongly marked in Greek;? in Latin its 
influence has been largely obscured. As a consequence of 
1 [As also in German and, to a less extent, in English,] 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 LATIN PHONETICS 
circumstances which we cannot examine here, the original 
conditions obtaining in this particular branch of the Indo- 
European family of languages have been so greatly changed 
that the system of its vowel gradations has become un- 
recognisable. We must therefore content ourselves with 
the mere enumeration of a few of the most characteristic 
instances.

HISTORY OF THE LATIN CONSONANTS. 
Single Consonants. 
Stops. 
§ 34. When between two vowels, the Latin stops, more 
especially the breathed stops, underwent but few changes. 
The following are worthy of remark :— 
Breathed Stops. 
§ 35. From the end of the second century 8.c. the fashion 
became prevalent of introducing into a number of genuine 
Latin words the aspiration of the three kinds of breathed 
stops. Before that date this peculiarity was confined to loan- 
words from Greek (§ 6, note iv. 4). When Greek civilisation 
was transplanted to Rome, and attracted a constantly- 
increasing number of adherents, certain Roman families 
thought it elegant to give their names a Greek stamp by 
adorning them with aspiration. Thus Sempronius altered his 
cognomen Graccus, ‘a jay,’ into Gracchus, to rhyme with 
Bacchus: we find on coins of the year 103 B.c. Pulcher ; 
and again the names Ce¢egus, Oto, Torius became Cethegus, 
Otho, Thorius. From proper names this habit spread to 
common nouns. Thus instead of ancora, lacrima, pulcer, 
sepulcrum, sulpur, etc., it became the fashion to say 
anchora, lachrima, pulcher, sepulckrum, sulphur, etc. We 
possess a body of instructive evidence on this practice in 
passages from ancient authors, of which we may cite the 
two most important: Cicero, Orator, 48, 160; quin ego 
ipse, cum scirem ita majores locutos, ut nusquam nisi in
-P-A-G-E-51
  HISTORY OF THE LATIN CONSONANTS 43 
vocali aspiratione uterentur, loquebar sic, ut pulcros, 
Cetegos, triumpos, Karfaginem dicerem ; aliquando, idque 
sero, convicio aurium cum extorta mihi veritas esset, usum 
loquendi populo concessi, scientiam mihi reservavi. 
Orcivios tamen et Matones, Ofones, Caepiones, sepulcra, 
coronas, lacrimas dicimus quia per aurium judicium licet : 
Quintilian, Jnstit. Orat., i. 5, 20; diu deinde servatum, 
ne consonantibus [veteres] adspirarent, ut in Graccis et in 
triumpis, erupit brevi tempore nimius usus, ut choronae, 
chenturiones, praechones adhuc quibusdam in inscrip- 
tionibus maneant, qua de re Catulli nobile epigramma 
est. The epigram of Catullus referred to by Quintilian is 
No. 84, which begins with the words :— 
Chommoda dicebat si quando commoda vellet 
dicere, et insidias Arrius /insidias, 
[¢f. also Quintilian, xii. 10, 27, and Lindsay, S. H. L. G., 
p. 16: ‘Nigidius, a grammarian of Cicero’s time, empha- 
sised the importance of accuracy in the use of the letter h: 
rusticus fit sermo si adspires perperam ; St Augustine says 
the dropping of 4 was a sign of vulgarity; Gellius says 
ahenum, vekemens, incohare are archaic, see Grandgent, 
Introduction to Vulgar Latin, p. 106.} 
No trace of this affectation remains in the Romance 
languages; thus we may probably conclude that the 
fashion, after degenerating into a mania, eventually fell 
into complete disuse. 
It is important to note that the sound of Latin ch, ph, 
and th was the same as that of German f, p, ¢ before 
vowels; [#.e., the aspiration was similar to, but not so 
strong as, that heard in park-head, top-hat, foot-hold.] 
We must therefore reject the pronounciations /iltrum, 
limfa, sul far.

  44 LATIN PHONETICS 
Voiced Stops. 
b. 
§ 36. b became a spirant from the second half of the 
first century a.D., and was pronounced like the N. German 
w in words like Wein, or the French v in words like vin. 
This change first set in when 4 was in the middle of a 
word between two vowels, but afterwards also when b was 
initial, though only in one part of the Roman Empire. 
Hence on inscriptions we find constant interchanges of b 
and v (i.e. consonantal w), which also about the same period 
had become a spirant (§ 52). Thus we find, for instance, 
incomparavilis for incomparabilis ; libertavus for libertabus 
—from liberta; vene for bene, and, on the other hand, beni 
for veni, bixi for vixi, lebare for levare. This confusion 
increased as time went on, so that in the fifth century a.p. 
a grammarian found it necessary to write a special treatise 
entitled ‘De b vocali et v vocali.’ This change is reflected, 
too, in the Romance languages, ¢f. Fr. Besancon, from Lat. 
Vesuntionem ; devoir from debere ; féve from fiba.2

p. 9, 17k, says : nos nunc... dinguam per/ potius quam per 
d [scribamus]). In some of these cases it is supposed that 
analogy has been operative, as in the case of dingua, possibly 
influenced by lingo, ‘I lick’; Jautia by Jautus, ‘dainty’; 
it has also been thought that the substitution of J for d 
was due to Sabine influence. 
Sometimes d and J change in forms which belong to the 
same root; ¢.g., odor, olere [perhaps influenced by o/eum], 
sedeo, solium (for the vowel gradation, see § 33). 
§ 38. Final d remained after a short vowel; but after a 
long vowel it disappeared from the beginning of the second 
century B.C. 
EXAMPLES.

séd, conjunction.

aeri (replaced at an early date by aeré, which, like

have no evidence. (Cf., too, Naevius, Bellum

the abl. sing. of the demonstrative pronoun -to- 
‘from that,’ ‘thereon,’ and hence abito will 
mean ‘go away at once,’ or ‘be sure you go 
away,’ a stronger form of command than abi 
(see Lindsay, S.H.G., p. 103; Giles, § 519).] 
dat6d and suntdd are attested by inscriptions. 
The negative haud maintained its d, although the 
preceding diphthong aw was in the duration of its pronun- 
ciation equivalent to a long vowel, because the word was 
proclitic ; 7.¢., attracted into the following word, so that its 
d was not final. 
% 9. 
§ 39. The pure voiced guttural g suffered no changes. 
On the other hand, the labialised voiced guttural which 
we represent by g’, and which the Latin orthography 
represented by gu, was replaced by » whenever it occurred 
between two vowels. 
EXAMPLES. 
nivis, from nix, which goes back to an original form, 
*nig’s (§ 82), )( ninguit, ‘it snows.’ 
struvo, written struo (§ 47), )( structum, the supine, 
which developed from *strug’ tum (§ 82). 
It is important to note that g” and gq’, written in 
ordinary spelling gw and qu, must not be regarded as 
consonantal combinations. They were not groups formed 
of a guttural stop and the semi-vowel v, but guttural 
stops with a labial aftersound ; the latter receiving a very 
much weaker articulation than the semi-vowel v. 
Thus gw standing alone is not sufficient to make a 
syllable long by ‘position’ (§ 95), as would be the case 
if the combination were regarded as one of two independent

found in this position, of. e.g., fefelli, defero, reficio, rufus, 
scrofa, vafer. 
The explanation of these exceptions is simple. Cases 
like those of fefelli, defero, reficio are to be explained by 
analogical restoration, and rufus, scrofa, vafer are loan- 
words from neighbouring dialects adopted into the language 
of Rome. We find such loanwords frequently in the 
language of the people, where the literary language main- 
tained the genuine Latin form. Thus we gather from a 
passage in Nonius Marcellus,! (p. 531, 2 m.), that the 
educated Romans pronounced sibilare, while the people 
said sifilare: sifilare quod nos, vilitatem verbi vitantes, 
sibilare dicimus. From the form sifilare came the 
French word ‘siffer. In the same way the Latin writers 
call the truffle tuber, while the Romance languages, as 
the French word truffe proves, imply the existence of a 
duplicate vulgar form *tu/er.

first became voiced, and then passed into 7. Instances of 
this process, commonly known as rhotacism, are very 
numerous. Cf. aeris, gen. of aes; juris, gen. of jus; operis,

We may compare Varro, de lingua Latina vii. 26: in 
multis verbis, in quo antiqui dicebant s, postea dicunt 7... 
foedesum, foederum; plusima, plurima; meliosem, meliorem ; 
asenam, arenam ; Quintilian, Jnstit. Orat. i. 4, 13: nam ut 
Valesii Fusii in Valerios Furiosque venerunt, ita . . lases 
et asa fuerunt; and again Paulus Diaconus, p. 359, 1 
Th.:—s pro r littera saepe antiqui posuerunt, ut majosibus, 
meliosibus, lasibus, fesiis. [Livy expressly remarks that 
the name Furius was by certain old writers written Fusius 
(ii. 4, 1).] 
We are enabled to fix the approximate date when 
rhotacism set in by means of two special passages. 
Cicero, ad Familiares, ix. 21, 2, states that L. Papirius 
Cursor, dictator B.c. 339, was the first person to bear the 
name of Papirius instead of the former Papisius: and the 
Digests (1, 2, 2, 36) mention that Appius Claudius Caecus 
(Censor in 312 B.c., and Consul in 307 B.c. and 296 B.c.) 
changed the spelling Valesii and Fusii to Valerii and 
Furii. Now, as we know that of all the words in any 
language proper names are the least accessible to change, 
we cannot go far wrong in assuming that rhotacism in 
common nouns had finally set in somewhere about the year 
350 B.o. 
The apparent exceptions to the universal application of 
thotacism admit of several explanations. Such compounds 
as desuper, nisi, resédo are evidently restored forms after
-P-A-G-E-57
  HISTORY OF THE LATIN CONSONANTS 49 
the model of super, si, sedo. In other cases where s 
between two vowels appears unchanged, we have to deal 
with an old -ss-, which, after a long vowel or diphthong, 
was simplified into -s- (§ 58). Thus causa, casus, divisio 
were written and pronounced till Cicero’s time, and even 
later, caussa, cassus, divissio ; cf. Quintilian, Instit. Orat., i., 
7,20: quid? quod Ciceronis temporibus paulumque infra 
fere quoties s littera media vocalium longarum vel subjecta 
longis esset, geminabatur? ut causse, cassus, divissiones : 
quomodo et ipsum et Vergilium quoque scripsisse manus 
eorum docent. Finally we meet s between two vowels in 
a number of loanwords which found their way into Latin 
after 350 B.c., and so escaped the influence of rhotacism ; 
of, eg., cisium, ‘a light, two-wheeled carriage,’ gaesum, 
‘a heavy iron javelin,’ both Celtic words; basis, ‘founda- 
tion,’ nausea, ‘sea sickness,’ pausa, ‘stoppage,’ which are 
of Greek origin; and asinus which seems to have come 
from Asia Minor through some Thracian dialect.1 
§ 42. If we disregard words of the type of milés, 5s a 
bone, etc. (for which see § 56, 4), the law holds good that 
final s in Old Latin was dropped when standing after a 
short vowel, and when the following word began with a 
consonant; ¢f. Cicero, Orator, 48, 161: quin etiam quod 
jam subrusticum videtur, olim autem politius, eorum 
verborum quorum eaedem erant postremae duae litterae 
quae sunt in optimus, postremam literam detrahebant, nisi 
vocalis insequebatur. And in fact the dental spirant under 
these conditions is seldom written in the oldest inscriptions. 
The Old Latin poets also generally treated it in this 
position as not affecting the scansion ; thus, for instance, 
1 [Hehn, Kulturpflanzen und Hausthiere, p. 475, assumes the derivation 
of asinus to be from the Hebrew athén.] 
D  
-P-A-G-E-58
    
50 LATIN PHONETICS 
Eunius writes ‘Ancu’ reliquit,’ and Lucilius, ‘ Aeserninu’ 
fuit.’ When, however, the following word began with a 
vowel, a process of liaison, as in French, set in; ¢.¢., final 
s was separated from the previous word and connected 
with the initial vowel of the following word; this pre- 
vented its being dropped (¢f. optimos~~omnium like French 
mauvais’ esprit). Analogy, however, gradually introduced 
regularity into the treatment of final s by restoring its 
value in all cases alike. In Lucretius it is proved by 
statistics that the cases in which the presence of a final 
s before a word beginning with a consonant makes a 
preceding short vowel long by position, are more numerous 
than those in which it is neglected. Catullus shows but 
one instance of final s which has not caused a lengthening 
by position before a word beginning with a consonant. 
This example is in Carmen, 116, 8: at fixus nostris tu 
dabi(s) supplicium. 
The disappearance of final s in Old Latin, of which 
we have just spoken, explains the presence of duplicate 
forms like magis and mage, amaris and amare (thou art 
loved). The old pronunciation was really, eg., magis 
elegans, but magi’ saepe. Since, as we have seen 
(§ 28), every absolutely final 7 became ¢, * magi became 
magé. Once this change had taken place there was 
naturally no restoration of final s possible; hence the 
two parallel forms magis and mage survived side by side ; 
similarly with amaris and amare. Analogy, however, 
interfered with the original conditions; the use of magis 
and amaris soon ceased to be connected with position 
before a vowel, and in like manner the use of mage 
and amare was no longer connected with position before 
a consonant; the initial letter of the following word 
ceased to play any part in the choice of one or the other
-P-A-G-E-59
  HISTORY OF THE LATIN CONSONANTS 51 
of the two forms [¢/. also potis, pote; sive=*sivis; neve 
=* nevis]? 
§ 43. Sometimes final s was replaced by r. Thus the 
word labér, as it is written in Classical Latin, took the 
place of the archaic form labds (for the shortening of 
the d in labér see § 31, 2); and similarly vapdr replaces 
vapos (of. Quintilian, Jnstit. Orat., i. 4, 13: nam ut 
Valesii Fusii in Valerios Furiosque venerunt, ita arbos, 
labos, vapos, etiam . . . fuerunt). 
This change must not be considered as the result of a 
regular sound-development ; the final 7 of the nominative 
case labor, vapor, etc., is simply the r of the oblique cases, 
which has extended its influence beyond its original limits 
owing to the analogy of nomina agentis such as dator, 
. tonsor, whose r was Indo-European. It is worth noting, 
too, that although the nominative honér is found on an 
inscription as early as 130 B.c., honds is unquestionably 
the prevailing form in the best MSS. of Cicero, Livy and 
Horace, and that Vergil employs exclusively the form arbés, 
and never arbir. 
h. 
§ 44. From the beginning of the literary period, the 
breathed guttural spirant 2 (the sound in Scotch ‘loch’) 
was still merely a breathed sound in the larynx, produced 
by the friction of the breath against the borders of the 
vocal chords. Thus the Latin grammarians never speak of 
the symbol # as a littera, but only as a nota aspirationis. 
Lightly pronounced when initial, and almost inaudible 
when medial, this breathed sound fell into complete 
1 [In the greater part of Italy, and probably in Dacia, final s disappeared 
once for all from the common pronunciation in the second and third 
centuries A.D., except in monosyllables; see Grandgent, Introduction to Vulgar Latin, § 29.]  
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 LATIN PHONETICS 
disuse in both positions at an early date. We know that 
words beginning with / were treated in prosody in precisely 
the same way as words commencing with a vowel; and 
that medial 4 had no power to prevent the rhotacism of 
s in *dishibeo, ‘I separate,’ which became diribeo (§ 41), 
nor the contraction of nihil and nehemo to nil and nemo 
respectively (§ 32). In spite of this, educated society re- 
introduced the aspiration of this symbol under the influence 
of orthography, and in classical times neglect to aspirate 
the # was regarded as a sign of bad education or low origin. 
But as this was a purely artificial pronunciation, many 
people introduced 4 wrongly even into words where it did 
not belong, ¢f the well-known epigram of Catullus, in 
which the poet derides a certain Arrius who instead of 
insidias said hinsidias (§ 35). Under these circumstances 
an uncomfortable uncertainty crept in even into the 
orthography, as in many cases no sure criterion was at 
hand for distinguishing the words which rightly took the 
aspiration from those where it was incorrect. ‘Thus it 
became customary to write, instead of the correct form 
hanser, ‘a goose,’ the rural and plebeian form anser.! 
On the other hand the customary orthography spelt 
umerus as Aumerus adding an / which had no right to be 
there. This explains, too, the inconsistencies in the old 
texts, and consequently also in the modern editions, which 
hesitate between irpex and Airpex, ‘harrow’; erus and 
herus, ‘master’; arundo and harundo, ‘reed’; olus and 
holus, ‘vegetable,’ etc. 
It is therefore not strange that the Roman grammarians 
from the earliest times made it one of their principal 
occupations to lay down clearly the correct facts as to 
aspiration. These efforts, for the most part futile, may

be compared with those of French teachers who give 
themselves much unnecessary trouble in impressing on 
their pupils the difference between / aspirate and / mute, 
although / aspirate has been unknown in France for at 
least two centuries, except in some local dialects such as 
those of Normandy and Lorraine. 
Trills and Divided Consonants. 
§ 45. When two 7’s or two 7s are in close proximity 
their tendency is to suffer differentiation ; ¢.e., the articula- 
tion of one of the two sounds is modified, or actually 
suppressed under the influence of the other. This character- 
istic, known under the name of Dissimilation, follows certain 
principles which are analogous to the other phonetic laws, 
but much more difficult to formulate. It seems, therefore, 
best to confine ourselves here to an enumeration of the 
actual changes attested by historical evidence. 
(1) l-1>1-r: 
The suffix -alis was replaced by-aris, whenever the word, 
to which it was attached, already contained an 4 ¢f. 
auxiliaris, consuliris, luniris, militaris as against 
mortiilis, navalis, rega/is, venalis, and similarly pulvinar 
(a cushion on which the effigies of the gods reclined during 
a lectisternium) as against cervicitd (pillow), cubiti/ (elbow- 
cushion). These substantives are neuters from adjectives 
in -alis, used as substantives; for the loss of final ¢ see 
§ 31, 1; for the shortening of @ see § 31, 2. 
For the same reason the suffix -crwm has taken the place 
of -clum in the words fulerum, lucrum, sepulcrum as 
against periclum, poclum, vinclum. [@/, too, lavacrum, 
simulacrum. ] 
(2) 1-I>r-1: 
Caeruleus, ‘ blue,’ from *caeZuleus from caelum ; Parilia, 
-ium (the festival of Pales) from Padilia. 
(3) r-r>l-r: 
Lemuria, -iorum (Roman festival held on 9th May to

propitiate the dead and the evil spirits) from *Remuria 
according to Ovid, Fasti, v. 479 sqq.

English pi/grim, and French pé/erin), 
Flagrare, to cause a smell of burning, from fragrare, ¢f. 
French flairer [which means at present ‘to scent,’ but 
which formerly signified ‘to spread a smell’). 
(4) r-r>r-nil: 
erebesco, crebui from crebresco, crebrui. 
praestigiae, ‘juggler’s tricks,’ connected with praestringo, 
‘I dazzle.’

proprietas (¢f. Fr, propiétaire, a common mispronunciation 
for propriétaire).

Oscan f see § 40, 
Nasals. 
§ 46. The treatment of final m is the only point which 
calls for remark. 
We have four different authorities on which to base our 
conclusions as to the value of final m in Latin : 
(1) The statements made by the Latin grammarians ; 
(2) the orthography of the inscriptions; (3) metre; 
(4) comparison with the Romance languages. 
(1) Of the passages in grammarians in which the 
definition of the nature of final m is attempted, the 
following three seem of the greatest importance for our 
purpose :— 
(a) Quintilian, Instit. Orat., ix, 4, 40: atqui eadem illa 
littera (ie., m) quotiens ultima est et vocalem verbi 
sequentis ita contingit, ut in eam transire possit, etiam
-P-A-G-E-63
  HISTORY OF THE LATIN CONSONANTS 55 
si scribitur, tamen parum exprimitur, ut multum ile et 
quantum erat, adeo ut paene cuiusdam novae litterae 
sonum reddat; neque enim eximitur, sed obscuratur et 
tantum in hoc aliqua inter duas vocales velut nota est, 
ne ipsae coeant. 
(6) Velius Longus, vii. p. 78, 19 k [a grammarian who 
lived in Trajan’s time]: cum dico etiam nunc, quamvis 
per m scribam, nescio quomodo tamen exprimere non 
possum. 
(c) Priscian [about the beginning of the fifth century 
A.D.], ii. p, 29, 15 k: m obscurum in extremitate dictionum 
sonat, ut templum; apertum in principio, ut magnus; 
mediocre in mediis, ut wmbra. 
(2) In the Old Latin inscriptions final m is very often 
dropped. Thus we read in the sepulchral inscription in 
saturnine verses of L. Cornelius L. F. Scipio, consul 259 
B.c., oino for oimom (=unum); dvonoro for dvonorom 
(=bonorum); viro for virom (=virum); aide for aidem 
(=aedem); but also Luciom=Lucium. This habit of 
dropping final m was continued during the following 
centuries on plebeian inscriptions, and indeed became more 
and more frequent, whilst in the orthography of the official 
inscriptions the insertion of final m was practically never 
neglected from the second half of the second century B.c. 
In rare cases we find a final -m replaced by -n (¢.g., salvon 
for salvom, tan for tam). 
(3) In poetry if a word ends in -im, -em, -wm, -om, -um, 
and the followiig word begins with a vowel, there is 
always elision just as if no m were there; on the other 
hand, these syllables are scanned as long if the following 
word begins with a consonant; ¢f. Vergil, Aen., ii. 101: 
Sed quid ego haec autem nequiqu™ ingrata revolvo? 
4. The Romance languages show no trace of final -m, 
except in a small number of stressed monosyllables like
-P-A-G-E-64
  56 LATIN PHONETICS 
the French rien from rem. [The Romance languages 
point to a loss of -m in all words but monosyllables ; 
see Grandgent, Introduction to Vulgar Latin, § 309.] 
These different statements can be reconciled only by 
assuming that as early as the pre-literary period of 
Latin, final m was reduced to a mere nasalisation of the 
vowel preceding it. As the Latin alphabet, like the 
English, possessed no special symbol for the representation 
of nasal vowels, spellings like viro, equom, and salvon 
represented three different phases in the attempts at 
denoting nasalisation in writing. This enables us to 
understand why Velius Longus called the sound in 
question ‘undefined,’ and also why Quintilian spoke of 
it as ‘paene cuiusdam novae litterae sonus.’ As nasal 
vowels preceding a consonant were always long, it is 
natural that scansions like 
Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Meliboee, putavi 
represent the normal treatment in scansion of the groups 
-em, -am, etc., before a word beginning with a consonant. 
And, finally, this explains the elision of these same groups 
before a following vowel; for, since the nasalisation was 
produced during the utterance of the vowel, and not after- 
wards, the poets could not do otherwise than put these 
groups on the same footing, as regards liability to elision, 
with the pure mouth-vowels. 
Semi-vowels. 
§ 47. In the sound combinations forming two syllables 
a+ any other vowel than ¢, and w+any other vowel than 
u,) after ¢ and w respectively the semi-vowels j and v 
developed as transition sounds. These parasitical sounds 
1 [t-+¢ was contracted to % and ww to a (§ 82).] 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
HISTORY OF THE LATIN CONSONANTS 57 
were not commonly denoted in writing at all. Thus the 
written form was pius, via, duo, pluit, but the pronuncia- 
tion was pi-j-us, vi,j-a, du-v-o, plu-v-it. The suppression 
of v after w in the written language was actually extended 
to v when organically correct, as in words like fluvere, ‘to 
flow’ (which comes from *flug’ere (§ 39); conflovont ap- 
pears on an old inscription); fruvor, ‘I enjoy’ (from *frug’or 
(§ 39); these were written fluere, fruor. But since the 
Latin alphabet did not distinguish between ¢ and J, and 
between w and » (§ 6, note iv, 2) the ambiguity of 
spellings like IVENTA, ‘youth,’ which might be read 
either as juventa or as *iventa, or of PLVIA, ‘rain,’ 
which could stand for either pluvia or *pluja, caused 
toward the end of the Republic the restoration or intro- 
duction of the symbol v, in the form V, of course, in 
these words and in some others of the same kind as for 
example fluvius. 
Note. —The appearance of the parasitic semi-vowels j 
and v after i and w followed by vowels is found also 
in modern French, ¢f. plier, pronounced pli-y-er and 
bouvard. 
§ 48. 7 between two vowels was pronounced 7+j. For 
this reason Cicero, in order to reconcile the spelling with 
the pronunciation, wrote acéo, Aiiax, Mazza, instead of aco, 
Aiax, Maa, the way in which these words were ordinarily 
written, ¢f Quintilian, Instit. Orat., i. 4, 11: sciat etiam 
Ciceroni placuisse aiéo Matiamque geminata 7 scribere, and 
Velius Longus, vii. p. 54, 16 k, in plerisque Cicero videtur 
auditu emensus scriptionem, qui et Azdacem et Maziam per 
duo @ scribenda existimavit. Forms like adiunt, ezus, 
maiiorem, are found also in inscriptions and in a number 
of our oldest MSS.
-P-A-G-E-66
  58 LATIN PHONETICS 
§ 49. » occurring between two vowels whose acoustic 
quality was essentially identical was regularly lost, and 
the two vowels were contracted (§ 32). 
EXAMPLES. 
ditis, genitive of dives, from divitis; in the same way 
we have ditior, comparative, and ditissimus, superlative, 
from divitior and divitissimus. 
sis, ‘pray,’ from si vis. 
latrina, from lavatrina. 
introrsum, retrorsum, dextrorsum, from *introvorsum, 
*retrovorsum, *dextrovorsum (vorsum is an archaic form 
from versum). [Qf our ‘Hawarden’ pronounced with 
loss of w, Lindsay, S.H.L.@., p. 14.] 
The duplicate forms divitis, divitior, divitissimus, and 
lavatrina are due to analogy. Thus the genitive divitis is 
clearly a new formation after the analogy of the nominative 
dives, where the v had to be maintained. On the other 
hand, the oblique cases ditis, diti, ditem, dite have called 
into existence a nominative dis along with dives. 
§ 50. In the same way v was lost in the combinations 
-dvé- and -&vd- before a consonant, but with this restric- 
tion, that the second of the two vowels did not stand 
in the final syllable. 6+¢ were then contracted into 0, 
while +0 did not undergo contraction (¢f. § 32). 
cdntio from cdvéntio (coventio is attested in S. C. de 
Bacch.). 
nonus from *novénos; novem for *noven owes its -m 
to decem. 
déorsum, séorsum from *dévorsom, *sévorsum (for the 
shortening of the @ after the loss of v, see § 27). 
but 
fovea (ditch) and novem, retain the », since in the former 
the combination -ove- stands not before a consonant but 
before a vowel, and in the latter the second of the two 
vowels belongs to the final syllable. 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  HISTORY OF THE LATIN CONSONANTS 59 
§51. In Vulgar Latin the disappearance of v between 
two vowels seems to have set in on a much larger scale 
than in the literary language. The ancient grammarians 
state that the people said failla for favilla, paor for 
pavor, probai for probavi. The inscriptions preserve 
forms like paimentum for pavimentum, dedicait for dedi- 
cavit. The Romance languages seem also to testify to 
the loss of v in this position; ¢f. Fr. paon from * paonem ; 
peur from * paorem ; and the so-called past definite tenses 
like chantai, prouvai, which presuppose a Latin * cantai, 
* probai. 
§ 52. The semi-vowel v became a spirant from the end 
of the second half of the first century a.p. Thus after 
this date we find the inscriptions hesitating between it 
and 6, which also became a spirant (§ 36) [further instances 
from inscriptions are biginti, bixit, botum, vene; Baleria, 
bictor, bos; bivere for vivere is very common. See 
Grandgent, § 316]. 
§ 58. Some four centuries later j in its turn became a 
spirant, with the sound dz which it had in Old French 
and still has in modern Italian. As the Latin alphabet 
had no special sign to represent this new sound, we find 
no less than four different symbols on the inscriptions, 
i.t., % 8, gi, di; of. forms like Zulia=Julia; Zanuarius and 
Gianuarius = Januarius; Sustus = Justus; Giove = Jove; 
eodiux=co(n\jux, found in Low Latin inscriptions belong- 
ing to the beginning of the Middle Ages. 
Double Consonants. 
§ 54. When in articulating a consonant special muscular 
energy is called into play, and the interval which normally 
passes between the time when the organs assume the 
necessary position and when they abandon it, is prolonged, 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 LATIN PHONETICS 
the ear in such a case fancies that it catches separately 
the noise made by the closing and opening movements. 
In this case we speak of a double consonant. In writing, 
double consonants were represented in Latin from the 
second century B.0. by a repetition of the symbol employed 
for a single consonant. It is, however, specially to be 
remarked that from a physiological point of view they 
do not denote two separate sounds, but only the doubled 
time of articulation. The double consonants consist 
merely of one single articulation, strengthened and pro- 
longed. Thus when the Roman grammarians lay it down 
that in words like assiduos, siccus, currit, fadlit, two 
successive movements of the organs of speech were 
necessary to the production of the consonants s, ¢, 7, J, 
they were misled by their imperfect auditory impressions 
and by the customary spelling. This explanation will enable 
us without any fear of misunderstanding to continue to 
employ the inexact but convenient and generally used 
term double consonant. 
A. Doubling of Simple Consonants. 
§ 55. In a certain number of Latin words a breathed 
stop between two vowels, when it terminated the initial 
syllable and followed a long vowel, was doubled with a 
. shortening of this long vowel. We may regard it as 
certain that this doubling was due in the first place to 
the initial stress accent of pre-literary Latin (§ 7), but at 
the same time the process is obscure, firstly because it 
seems to be absolutely sporadic, and secondly because 
nearly always the original form with the single consonant 
after a long vowel remained in use side by side with 
the later form which had the double consonant after a 
short vowel. This extremely delicate and complex question
-P-A-G-E-69
  HISTORY OF THE LATIN CONSONANTS 61 
will no doubt have to wait some considerable time for 
its solution. 
EXAMPLES. 
ctippa, ‘tub,’ ‘cask,’ beside ciipa (the two variants are 
represented in French where coupe came from ciippa and 
cuve from cipa. 
Jippiter beside Japiter. 
littera asi: puOLa, 
littus 3) cleus: 
bicca >»  baica. 
maticcus | mucus. 
B. Simplification of Double Consonants. 
§ 56. Every double consonant was reduced to a single 
consonant :— 
(1) After a short vowel of the initial syllable in poly- 
syllabic words in which the second syllable was long 
either naturally or by position. 
EXAMPLES. 
cinalis, derived from canna, ‘ reed.’ 
etirilis, derived from cirrus. 
disertus, perf. part. pass. of dissero. 
fella, ‘a small cake,’ dim, of Sfa. 
sicellus, dim. of siiccus. 
As we might naturally expect, analogy re-introduced 
double consonants into a large number of words, ¢f., ¢.9.: 
gillina for *gi/ina, on the model of gii/lus. 
innoxius for *inoxius, on the model of innécuos. 
sérratus for *sératus, on the model of sérra ‘a saw.’ 
(2) Before a consonant.

New formations due to analogy: accresco, opprimo, atéraho,

current pronunciation as on considerations of etymology ; 
cf. on this point Cassiodorus,! vii. p. 205, 18 k. sqq.:

from *sentsi (§ 68). 
but 
siccus, summus, pessimus. 
The double consonant was restored to gain etymological 
clearness in cases where the prefix ew- was connected with 
a word beginning with s. Thus the forms exsatio, exsolvo, 
exsomnis became, according to rule, *exatio, *exolvo, 
*exomnis; but since the simplification of the double 
consonant seemed likely to obscure the etymological con- 
struction of these words, exsatio, exsolvo, exsomnis were 
restored, in spelling at least. For the same reason the 
words exculpo, expolio, extruo, which represent the cor- 
rect forms (¢f 2 and 3 above), are commonly replaced 
by exsculpo, exspolio, exstruo. 
(4) When final. 
EXAMPLES. 
és, ‘thou art,’ from *ess (*es-s, 2nd pers. sing. pres, indic. 
of es-se, like ama-s, 2nd pers. sing. pres. indic. of ama-re). 
£67, ‘gall,’ from *fedd, ¢f. gen. felis. 
hoc, nom. ace. sing. neuter, from *hoce (original form 
*hodce>*hocce) (§ 31, 1; § 76). 
milés, from *miless, which itself came from *milets 
(§ 68). 
6s, ‘bone,’ from *oss, ¢f. gen. ossis. 
It is, however, to be remarked that even though the 
spelling no longer exhibits any traces of final ‘double 
consonants,’ we find a certain number indicated by the 
usages of prosody.. Thus Plautus scans es as long, and 
miles as a spondee (milés), and Vergil quite commonly 
begins hexameters with words like hoc erat (Aen., ii. 664) 
hoc illud (2b. iv. 675), hoc opus (7b. vi. 129): these scan- 
sions testify to the pronunciation ess, miless, hoce. On
-P-A-G-E-72
64 | LATIN PHONETICS 
the other hand, it must be observed that miles forms a 
trochee as early as the time of Ennius, and Terence never 
scans the last syllable of words like ades and potes as long 
except when the following word begins with a consonant. 
These apparently contradictory pieces of evidence may 
perhaps be explained in the following way. Originally, final 
double consonants were, as a rule, simplified only before a 
pause (7.¢., at the end of a sentence), and before a word which 
began with a consonant; while before words commencing 
with a vowel they remained, as a rule, unchanged. Scan- 
sions like ess, miless, hocc, are the last traces of this 
original condition. Analogy effaced it by gradually bring- 
ing about, in all cases, the simplification of the final double 
consonants. Hence came the scansion milés, adés, potés 
with the last syllable short. 
It is important to note that the final s of words like és, 
milés, 6s is in Old Latin never silent like the same letter in 
amicus, civis, manus, spes, etc. (§ 42); te. when followed 
by a consonant it always made a preceding short vowel 
long by position. 
§ 57. The double stops were simplified after a long 
vowel. 
EXAMPLES. 
secubo, from *seccubo, which itself goes back to *setcubo, 
*sedcubo (§ 76). 
separo, from *sepparo, older *setparo, *sedparo (§§ 14 and 
76). 
§ 58. -ss- remained intact in every case till the end of 
the first century B.c., but after that time was reduced to -s- 
when following a long vowel or diphthong; see Quintilian, 
Instit. Orat., i. 7, 20 (the passage already quoted in § 41). 
Thus the pronunciation of Cicero, and of Vergil also, was as

given below ; we may infer this not merely from the testi- 
mony of Quintilian, but also from contemporary inscrip- 
tions and the best manuscripts of these authors. 
classis; esse; gessi, perf. of gero (from *geso, § 41); 
missus, perf. part, pass. of mitto (§ 83); cassus -as, from 
*cadtus (§§ 26 and 83) ; divissio, from *dividtio (§§ 26 and 838), 
caussa, 
On the other hand, in Quintilian’s time the pronuncia- 
tion was : 
classis, esse, gessi, missus ; but casus, divisio, causa. 
As regards this last example, caussa seems to have 
remained in use, together with causa, during the whole 
of the first century a.p. This seeming anomaly is to be 
explained by the fact that we are dealing with a term 
belonging especially to legal phraseology which affected 
archaisms. 
In view of the linguistic facts thus stated it were to be 
wished that modern editors would make up their minds to 
avoid such spellings as casus, divisio, causa in texts of 
Cicero, Caesar, Vergil, etc. Cassus, divissio, caussa are the 
only forms that correspond to the pronunciation of the 
republican era. 
§ 59. -d/- was simplified to -/- : 
(1) After a long vowel, when the following syllable 
contained an ¢. 
(2) After a diphthong. 
EXAMPLES. 
(1) mivia, nom, and ace. plur, of mille. 
stilicidium, ‘dripping,’ )( sti//a, ‘a drop,’ from * stir-la

belonging to the root ‘of caedo, )( rad/um, ‘instrument

COMBINATIONS OF CONSONANTS 67 
COMBINATIONS OF CONSONANTS. 
A. Groups of Two Consonants. 
1.—-Assimilation. 
§ 61. In any language when two consonants of different 
acoustic quality come into contact, there is a tendency to 
suppress, or at least modify, the transition from the first to 
the second by an entire or partial levelling of their 
respective natures. This linguistic phenomenon is known 
under the name of assimilation. Assimilation can affect 
breath and voice (c.¢., if two consonants, one breathed, the 
other voiced, are in combination, they are likely to become 
both either breathed or voiced). It affects also the manner 
and the place of articulation. It is progressive or 
regressive, according as to whether it is the first or second 
consonant from which the process of levelling proceeds, or, 
in other words, whether the assimilating consonant is the 
first or the second. In Latin, regressive assimilation was 
much more common than progressive. 
(a). Breath and Voice Assimilation. 
Regressive Assimilation. 
§ 62. Every stop or spirant becomes breathed before a 
breathed stop or spirant, and voiced before a voiced stop 
or spirant. 
EXAMPLES. 
(1) actus (for the lengthening of the a, see § 26), perf. 
part. pass. of igo. 
scriptus, perf. part. pass. of scribo.
-P-A-G-E-76
68 LATIN PHONETICS 
rexi (i.e. recsi), perf. of régo. 
nipsi, perf. of nubo, 
(2) abduco, )( aperio. 
obdo, )( operio. 
segmentum, belonging to the root of seco. 
§ 63. In other cases the results of this law are latent, 
ery obscured by further changes. Compare :— 
*clautsi, perf. of claudo, which became claussi (§ 68), 
and from the Augustan period, clausi (§ 58). 
*submos superlative, ‘the highest,’ from *supmos (cf. the 
comparative suyerior), which became summus (§ 70). 
*izdem, ‘the same,’ from *isdem, which became idem 
(§ 25, 1 and § 86). 
For further examples see §§ 66 sqq. and § 86. 
§ 64. If in ordinary spelling a voiced consonant precedes 
a breathed, as in words like obtineo, subtilis, plebs, urbs, the 
violation of the rule is only apparent. A considerable 
mass of evidence from the Roman grammarians establishes 
the fact that these words were always pronounced optineo, 
suptilis, pleps, urps; ¢/. for example, Quintilian, Jnstit. 
Orat., i. 7, 7: quaeri solet in scribendo praepositiones 
sonum quem junctae efficiunt, an quem separatae observare 
conveniat, ut cum dico obtinuwit (secundam enim 0 litteram 
ratio poscit, aures magis audiunt p). By ratio, of course, 
we must understand analogy: obtineo, subtilis were 
written after the analogy of obduro, subdolus, and pleds, 
urs after the analogy of their oblique cases plebis, pledi, 
urbis, urbi, etc. 
Progressive Assimilation. 
§ 65. Its operations are always latent. 
Under the influence of a preceding trilled or divided 
consonant, a voiced spirant was substituted for a breathed 
spirant.
-P-A-G-E-77
  
COMBINATIONS OF CONSONANTS 69 
EXAMPLES. 
*ferze (‘to carry’), from *ferse (compare esse, ‘to be’), 
which became ferre (§ 74). 
*velze (‘to wish’), from *velse, which became velle 
(§ 74). 
*ferze and *velze are not attested forms, but the physio- 
logical analysis of pronunciation proves that the combina- 
tions -rs- and -Js- could not become -rr- and -iJ- without a 
previous change of the breathed s into the voiced z. 
(b) Assimilation of the Manner of Articulation. 
§ 66. Assimilation of the manner of articulation was 
very common in Latin. Hence we can give only a 
selection of the most characteristic examples, leaving the 
student to multiply the number in the course of his read- 
ing. It should be noted also that it is often impossible 
to determine the constituent elements of a combination 
assimilated from this point of view without the help of 
the other Indo-European languages. Thus -//- arises from 
-dl-, -nl-, -rl-, -ld-, -in-, -Is-, and so it is only the com- 
parison of the German Hals that enables us to recognise 
that the Latin collwm (‘a neck’) is developed from *colsom.! 
If one of the two consonants in combination was voiced 
and the other breathed, or vice versa, the assimilation of 
the manner of articulation was preceded by that of their 
acoustic quality, according to the laws formulated in § 62. 
The double consonant that resulted from the assimilation 
of the manner of articulation was reduced to a single 
consonant in all the cases provided for by the formulae in 
§ 56 sgg. It should be added, however, that apart from 
a few rare exceptions the double consonant, which was 
simplified after a short vowel in polysyllabic words with 
a long second syllable (§ 56, i.), was re-established by 
analogy. By 1 See Giles, § 184,

Regressive Assimilation. 
Stop + Spirant. 
§ 67. In combinations formed of a labial, dental or 
guttural stop followed by f, the stop is changed to f. 
Thus here the assimilation of the manner is combined 
with that of the place of articulation; the three kinds 
of stops not being replaced by corresponding spirants but 
changing all to f.

effero from ecfero (ecferet is found in Plautus Aulularia, 
664, ecfari in a quotation from Ennius in Cicero, De 
Legibus, iii. 9; the triple form of the preposition 6-, éc-, 
ex- corresponds exactly with a-, ib-, abs-), 
Restorations due to analogy: obfero, adfero, obfundo, 
adfigo, which are duplicate forms of offero, a/fero, 
offundo, affigo. Offundo and affigo in their turn are 
re-established by analogy of offero, affero, and other 
words of the same type. ‘The only regular forms are 
* ofundo, * afigo (§ 56, i.). The pronunciation of obfero, 
adfero, obfundo, adfigo was, of course, opfero, atfero, 
opfundo, atfigo; the spellings obfero, adfero, obfundo, 
adfigo correspond precisely with obtineo, subtilis, etc.

Double -ss- was reduced to single -s- :— 
(1) After a short vowel in the first syllable of poly- 
syllabic words where the second syllable was long naturally 
or by position (§ 56 (1)). 
There are no examples; analogy everywhere introduced 
the double -ss- and effaced the results of this law (see 
below). 
(2) In a final position (§ 56 (1)). 
EXAMPLES. 
miles from * milefs (compare gen. militis from * miletis 
(§ 10, i., b)), miless.

Stop + Nasal. 
§ 69. Under the action of a following », each kind of 
stop was changed into the nasal produced by the same 
organ. ‘Thus :— 
-bn- > -mn- 
-pn- > -mn- passing through -bn- 
-dn- > -nn- 
-tn- > -nn- passing through -dn- 
-gn- > -nn- 
-n- > -an- passing through -gn- 
EXAMPLES. 
scamnum (‘a stool,’ ‘a bench’) from *scabnom (compare 
the diminutive scabellum). 
Samnium (the district in Central Italy whose inhabitants 
were descended from the Sabines) from *Sadniom (which 
belongs to the same root as Sabini, Savelli, ‘the Sabines’). 
somnus from *sopnos (¢f. sopor, ‘deep sleep’), by an 
intermediate stage *sobnos. 
annoto from adnoto. 
penna from *petna (which belongs to the root of peto, 
‘I direct myself towards,’ the oldest meaning of which 
was ‘I fly’), through an intermediate stage *pedna. 
As for the group -gn-, representing partly an older -cn- 
(of. § 62), writing has not been able to reproduce its 
development into -nn-, because, as we have seen (§ 6, 
note 3), the Romans did not possess a special letter to 
denote the nasal guttural. Thus they continued to write 
-gn- while pronouncing -2n-. 
Compare :— 
linnum, written lignum, ‘firewood’; primitive form 
*legnum (§ 16). 
dinnus, written dignus; primitive form *decnos (§§ 16, 
62) ; intermediate stage *degnos,
-P-A-G-E-81
COMBINATIONS OF CONSONANTS 13 
The proof that in lignum and dignus -gn- was pro- 
nounced -nn- is provided by the radical % of these words, 
which comes from an original @, the change of @ to 7 in 
a closed syllable being the rule before a nasal guttural 
(§ 16). Restorations due to analogy: abnuo, abnego, which 
have almost entirely ousted the regular forms amnuo, 
amnego; adnoto, a duplicate form of annoto; annecto, 
annitor for *anecto, *anitor (§ 56 (1)). 
§ 70. Omitting the combination guttural stop+m, the 
treatment of which has not yet been established, all 
the stops followed by m became m. This development 
presupposes the earlier change of d and ¢ tob and p in 
consequence of an assimilation of the place of articulation. 
(§ 78). Hence :— 
-bm- 
Sime > Fon } peas 
cee } > -mn- passing through -bm-. -tm- > -pm- 
For -tm-, it is true, we have no examples, but it is 
beyond doubt that this combination developed in the 
way indicated wherever it presented itself. 
EXAMPLES. 
ammoveo from admoveo. 
summus from *submos from *supmos (§§ 62, 63). 
Double -mm- was simplified later to -m- (S§ 56 (1), 60) 
after a short vowel in the initial syllable in polysyllabic 
words whose second syllable was long by nature or

omitto from *opmitto (op being the original form of the 
preposition ob ; § 62 (2)), *obmitto, *ommitto. 
glama (‘husk’) from *glubma, *glumma (glibo, ‘peel’). 
caementum (‘hewn stone’) from *caedmentom, *caem- 
mentom (caedo, ‘ break’). 
Restorations due to analogy: admoveo, duplicate form 
of ammoveo (see above); submitto, duplicate form of 
summitto, which is itself of analogical origin, the correct 
form being *sumitto (compare omitto above). 
Stop + Divided Consonant.

duplicate forms of irrevocabilis, colloquium (see above) ; 
corrumpo, illatus (perf. part. pass. of infero), which have 
replaced the regular forms corumpo and *ilatus (§ 56 (1)). 
Of corumpo there remains a last trace in Lucretius, vi.,

Progressive Assimilation. 
Trilled or Divided Consonant + Spirant. 
§ 74. A trilled or divided consonant assimilates a follow-

-rs- > -rr-

EXAMPLES. 
ferre from *ferze, from *ferse (compare esse). 
velle from *velze from *velse. 
To the same category belong words like col/um, torreo, 
verres which come from *colsum, *torseo, *verses. These 
original forms, however, are proved only by a comparison 
with the other Indo-European languages (§ 66). 
To this rule there are exceptions, z.¢., words which show 
the combinations -7s- and -/s- without assimilation. Com- 
pare for example arsi, farsi, mulsi, the perfects of ardeo, 
farcio, mulceo ; pulsus, perf. part. pass. of pello. Of course 
this different treatment of the same combinations of 
consonants only apparently violates the principle of the 
constancy of phonetic laws. The formulae of these laws, 
in fact, apply only to sounds or combinations of sounds of 
perfectly identical nature. Now in arsi, the combination 
-rs- comes from -rss- (§ 89); farsi and mulsi stand for 
*farcsi, *mulcsi (§ 90), and the simplification of the com- 
binations -rcs and -Jes- to -rs- and -Js- came only after the 
assimilation of original -rs- and -/s- to -rr- and -Il-. Finally, 
pulsus is an analogical creation that has replaced the 
regular form *pultus. Of this there remains a last trace 
in the verb pultare (‘strike’) used by Plautus, Captivi, 832, 
of. also Quintilian, Instit. Orat., i. 4, 14: nam mertare et 
pultare dicebant. Pulsus was substituted for *pultus at a

time when the assimilation of original -rs- and -/s- was 
equally an accomplished fact. None of these forms thus 
corresponds exactly with *ferse or *velse. 
(c.) Assimilation of the Place of Articulation. 
§ 75. Assimilation of the place of articulation was always 
regressive. All the remarks made above (§ 66) with regard 
to the assimilation of the manner of articulation are true of 
this process also. The student must therefore refer to them 
before beginning to study the following laws. 
Assimilation between Stops.

Some of the instances of assimilation shown in this 
table rest, it is true, only on analogical induction, as 
there are no examples. The following are attested his- 
torically :— 
aggero, from adgero, 
oggero, from *opgero, obgero. 
siccus, from *sit(i)cos (which belongs to the same root as 
sitis). 
succido, from *supcado (with umlaut, § 10, i. ¢.). 
quicquam, from quidquam, *quifquam. 
ocquinisco (‘stoop’), from *opquinisco (compare con- 
quinisco ; the simple verb is not used). 
quippe, from *quidpe (quid, neuter of quis + pe, a particle 
found also in nempe), *quitpe. 
A double guttural (¢.e., -cc-, -pp-, etc.) was simplified 
in a final position (§ 56 (4)), and in a medial syllable after 
a long vowel (§ 57). 
EXAMPLES. 
hoc, from *hodce (*hod, neuter, like id, + ce, # demon- 
strative particle; old inscriptions have honce = hunc, 
hance = hane, etc.), *hotce *hocce, and with the loss of the

Restorations due to analogy: adgero, obgero, quid- 
quam, duplicate forms of aggero, oggero, quicquam ; 
adbibo, which has ousted *abbibo doubtless owing to the 
latter’s ambiguity ; iccirco for *icirco (§ 56 (1)), arising 
from idcirco, which was re-established and existed as a 
duplicate form along with iccirco.

Assimilation between a Stop and a Spirant produced 
by Different Organs. 
§ 77. Before the labial spirant / every dental or guttural 
stop was changed into a labial stop. 
This assimilation is latent because the labial stop was later 
changed into a spirant owing to assimilation of the manner 
of articulation (§ 67). 
Assimilation between a Stop and a Nasal produced by 
Different Organs. 
§ 78. Before the labial nasal m, every dental stop was 
changed into a labial stop. 
As in § 77, this assimilation is latent, and its results 
altered by a secondary assimilation of the manner of articu- 
lation (§ 70). 
Note.—In this instance the reconstruction of the latent 
assimilation of the dental stops to labial stops before m is 
based partly on the physiological difficulty of a direct change 
from -dm- and -tm- to -mn-, and partly on the very pro- 
nounced tendency to labialise a dental stop followed by m, 
which is seen in other languages as well as Latin. Thus 
in the Swiss pronunciation of modern German, written 
words like Badmeister (‘ bath-attendant’), Mitmensch (‘fel- 
low-creature’), we seem to hear Bapmeister, Mipmensch. 
Assimilation of Dental Spirant s to Labial Spirant f. 
§ 79. The dental spirant s of the prefix dis- is assimilated 
to a following /: 
-sf- > ff- 
Compare : différo, from *disféro. 
difficilis, from “*disficilis (with umlaut) 
(§ 10, i. c).
-P-A-G-E-88
80 LATIN PHONETICS 
Restorations due to analogy: diffido, diffundo, which 
have replaced *difido, *difundo, the only regular forms 
(§ 56 (1)). 
Assimilation between Nasals and Stops, 
§ 80. Only the corresponding nasal, i.¢., formed by the 
same organ as the stop, can precede a stop. 
EXAMPLES, 
The prefixes cim- (comes), in- (ineo) and the negative 
particle in- (in-iitilis) end in m before a labial stop, in n 
before a dental stop, and in 2 (written owing to the lack 
of a special letter to denote the nasal guttural (§ 6, note 3)) 
before a guttural stop ; compare :— 
  Moreover, the change from m to x before a dental stop 
and to % before a guttural stop is seen in the following 
cases :— 
eundem, eandem (eum, eam + dem). 
eorundem, earundem (eorum, earum + dem). 
quandiu (quam + diu). 
septendecim (septem + decem). 
clanculum (adv, ‘secretly’ and prep. ‘without the 
knowledge of,’ found in Plautus and Terence) pronounced 
clanculum ; ¢f. clam, which has the same meanings. 
tune, pronounced tune (tum + enclitic ce (§ 31 (1)). 
tanquam, pronounced tazquam (tam + quam), 
Restorations due to analogy: eumdem, eamdem, 
eorumdem, earumdem, quamdin, septemdecim, tamquam, 
duplicate forms of eundem, etc.; sumptus (with develop- 
ment of a parasitic p (§ 85)), perf. part. pass. of sumo 
for suntus. The latter form, however, existed in Vulgar 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  COMBINATIONS OF CONSONANTS 81 
Latin and survives in certain Romance forms. It 
is, moreover, probable that the restoration of the 
etymological forms eumdem, etc., was at first purely 
literary, that is to say, the same people who wrote with 
the m none the less continued to pronounce the words 
eundem, etc. 
Assimilation of the Nasal Dental to the Nasal Labial. 
§ 81. The nasal dental 2 is assimilated to the nasal 
labial m wherever the preposition or negative particle in- 
precedes a word beginning with m. 
am > mm. 
EXAMPLES. 
immolo from inmolo (properly, ‘I sprinkle the head of 
the victim with the sacred flour called mola). 
immerito from inmerito. 
Restorations due to analogy: inmolo, inmerito, 
duplicate forms of immolo, immerito; immuto, immitis, 
the phonetic forms being *imuto, * imitis (§ 56 (1)). 
II. Treatment of g’ and gq’ before a Consonant. 
§ 82. Before a consonant the labialised guttural stops 
g* and q” (written gu and gu (§ 39)) lost their labial 
appendix and were changed into pure gutturals g and c. 
Moreover, if the following consonant was breathed—and 
that is true of all the examples that can be adduced of 
the combination g” + consonant—the voiced g became 
a breathed ¢ (§ 62). Hence :— 
g, Y + consonant > ¢ + consonant. 
F 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
82 LATIN PHONETICS 
EXAMPLES. 
extincsi, written extinxi, perfect of extinguo. 
nics, written nix, )( the genitive nivis that goes back to 
*nigvis (§ 39). 
unctio, )( ungventum. 
assecla (‘a hanger-on’), )( assegéor. 
coctus, perf. part. pass. of coguo. 
delictum, )( delinguo. 
This law explains also ac and nec, duplicate forms of 
atgue and neque, and used when the following word begins 
with a consonant. After the loss of the final e of atque 
and neque (§ 31 (1)) the labialisation of gu disappeared 
under the influence of the following consonant. Hence 
*atc and nec; *atc was then assimilated into *acc (§ 76), 
and finally the double cc was reduced to a single ¢ 
(§ 56 (4)). 
III. Treatment of the Combination Dental Stop + t 
§ 83. From the Indo-European epoch the combination 
of a dental stop and ¢ gave rise to the development of 
a medial parasitic s. Hence the combination ¢st, which 
in Latin became ss by a double assimilation. 
d,t+t> tst > ss. 
EXAMPLES. 
eassus from *cidtus (cido; for the lengthening of the 
radical vowel in this word and the two following, see 
§ 26). 
divissio from *dividtio (divido), 
éssus, perf. part. pass. of édo (‘I eat’) from *édtos. 
plaussus, perf. part. pass. of plaudo, from *plaudéos. 
sessus, perf. part. pass. of sedeo, from *sedtos (on the 
probable reason why the radical vowel in sessus is not 
lengthened, see § 26). 
messis from *meétis (meto). 
passus sum, perfect of patior, from *pattos sum. 
quassus, adj. old perf. part. pass. of quatio, from *quattos.
-P-A-G-E-91
COMBINATIONS OF CONSONANTS 83 
After a long vowel and diphthong the double ss was 
reduced to a single s from the end of the first century 
Bo. Cicero still pronounced and wrote cassus, etc., but in 
Quintilian’s time these words were spelt casus, ete. 
(§ 58). 
§ 84. In a certain number of cases the combination 
dental stop + t was formed afresh after the development 
traced above which ended well before the historical period. 
The result of this second evolution was not now -ss- but 
-tt-. This happened especially when the prefix ad- was 
combined with a verb that began with ¢; ¢f. :— 
atfenuo from adfenuo. 
attuli, perfect of affero (assimilated from adfero, § 67) 
from adtuli. 
The prefixes attached to verbs were in fact originally 
independent words, and this character had not yet been 
lost completely in Plautus’ time ; cf. Trinwmmus, v. 833 : 
dixtraxissent disque tulissent .. . 
Thus the combination -dé¢- in adtenuo, adtuli, was too 
recent to be affected by the law that caused for example 
the change of *sedtos to sessus (see above). Hence we 
get attenuo, attuli. It should be added that by the side 
of attenuo, attuli, restored duplicate forms, adtenuo, adtuli 
are also found in inscriptions and manuscripts. 
IV.—Development of a parasitic sound in certain 
combinations of two consonants. 
§ 85. Between the two elements of the combinations sr 
(as far as it represents an earlier dtr, see §§ 56 (2), 83), 
ml, ms, mt, a parasitic transitional sound developed, which 
in the case of sr was a ¢, and in that of ml, ms, mt a p.

Gi.) sr > sér. 
Gi) ml > mol. 
ms > mps. 
mt > mpt. 
EXAMPLES. 
(1) claustrum, from *clausrom, *claudtrom (claudo), 
rasirum, from *rasrom, *radtrom (rado). 
tonsirix, from *tonsrix, *tondtrix (tondeo). 
(2) exemplum, from *exemlom (properly ‘that which is 
taken out as a sample, from *exemo, which became 
eximo (§ 10, i. 6)). 
compsi, dempsi, prompsi, sumpsi, perfects of como, 
demo, promo, sumo, from *comsi, *demsi, *promsi, *sumsi 
(¢f., for example, dixi, i.¢., dicsi, perfect of dico). 
comptus, demptus, promptus, sumptus, from *comtus, 
*demtus, *promtus, *sumtus. 
In popular speech a parasitic » developed also in the 
combination -mn-, os is shown by the spellings, such as 
autumpnus, contempno, sompnus, which are found fre- 
quently in vulgar texts. Educated people absolutely 
eschewed this pronunciation. 
NorTE.—(i.) *comtus, *demtus, *promtus, *sumtus ought 
to have become *contus, *dentus, *prontus *suntus (§ 80) ; 
but the m was restored by analogy. 
(ii.) If the parasitic consonants were relatively few in 
Latin, French, on the other hand, is rich in them, ¢f. 
O.F. ancesére, esire from Latin antecess(5)r, *ess(é)re ; 
mod. Fr. combler from Latin cum(i)lare, nombre from 
num(é)rum, pondre from pon(é)re, ete. 
V.—Loss of the first element of a combination of 
two consonants. 
§ 86. Before a voiced consonant, s changed to z (§ 63), 
and then was lost with a compensatory lengthening of 
the preceding vowel if the latter was short (§ 25 (1)).
-P-A-G-E-93
COMBINATIONS OF CONSONANTS 85 
EXAMPLES. 
idem, from *isdem (is+dem), which became first *izdem, 
jadex, from *jiisdex (‘ quod jis dicat’); -dex for -dix by 
analogy of the second element of compounds like auspex, 
opifex, ete., according to the proportional formula, aus- 
picis, opificis: auspex, opifex=judicis : x), *jizdex. 
trédecim, from *trésdecim, *trézdecim. 
prélum (‘ wine-press’), from *préslom (¢f. prés-si, perfect 
of prémo), *prézlom. 
primus, from *prismos (cf. priscus), *prizmos. 
égénus, from *égésnos (of. égéstas), *égéznos. 
pono, from *pés(i)no (§ 25 (1)), *pdzno. 
Gf. also diduco, digero, dilanio (‘I tear in pieces’), 
dimitto, dinosco, as against distorqueo, discedo, dispono, 
dissocio. 
Restorations due to analogy : ejusdem, quibusdam, after 
ejus and quibus. 
§ 87. Before f and s the nasal dental » lost its stop 
character at an early date; the vibrations set up in the 
glottis during this sound were then attracted to the pre- 
ceding vowel, lengthening it by way of compensation when 
it was short (§ 25 (2)). 
The loss of m in this position is proved (i.) by spellings 
like iferos, cesor, cosol, found frequently on archaic in- 
scriptions; (ii.) by the abbreviation cos. for consul; 
(ii.) by the testimony of Quintilian (§ 25 (2)); (iv.) by 
‘inverse spellings’ in vulgar texts, ¢.g., occansio, then- 
saurus for occasio, thesaurus; (v.) by the Romance 
languages, ¢f, for example, the French épouse, mois, toise 
‘fathom ’), which go back to spdsa, mésem, tésa. But at 
an early period etymological considerations caused the 
restoration of m, first in the spelling, and then, owing 
to the instinctive popular tendency to harmonise the 
spoken with the written language, partially at any
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 LATIN PHONETICS 
rate in pronunciation. This happened especially in the 
case of compounds with con- and in-. Hence the French 
conseil, enfant, ensemble, that develop from consilium, 
infantem, isimul. 
B. Combinations of Three Consonants. 
§ 88. Combinations of three consonants were reduced 
most frequently to two consonants, but occasionally even 
to one. The simplification to two consonants was due— 
(1) To the assimilation of two consonants of the com- 
bination, after which the double consonant was 
made a single one. 
(2) To the loss pure and simple of a consonant under 
conditions formulated below. 
The simplification to a single consonant was due (a) to 
the combination of the one or other of these two causes 
with the loss of an s, or (6) to the loss of ms before a voiced 
consonant. 
Assimilation and Simplification of a double consonant 
along with a possible loss of an s. 
§ 89.— EXAMPLES. 
(a) aspiro from adspiro, *asspiro (§§ 68, 56 (2)). 
asto from adsto, *assto (§§ 68, 56 (2)). 
corculum, from *cordculom, *coreculom (§§ 76, 56 (8)). 
sarmentum, from *sarymentom, *sarmmentom (§§ 70, 
56 (3)). 
arsi, from *ardsi, *arssi (§§ 68, 56 (3)). 
sensi, from *senési, *senssi (§§ 68, 56 (3)). 
nox (é.¢,, nocs), from *noets (ef. gen. noctis), *noess (§§ 68, 
56 (4). 
testis, from *terstis (‘qui tertius stat’), *tesstis. 
tostus, perf. part. pass, of torreo (originally *torseo (§ 74)), 
from *torstos, *tosstos,
-P-A-G-E-95
  COMBINATIONS OF CONSONANTS 87 
The two last examples might seem to violate the law 
laid down in § 74. But for an 7 to assimilate a following 
s, the latter must first become voiced, which in the case of 
*terstis and *torstus was impossible owing to its position 
before the breathed 7 (§ 62). Hence the assimilation has 
been regressive. 
Superstes is a restoration due to analogy ; the phonetic 
form supestes is found frequently on vulgar inscriptions. 
(2) pone, prep. and adverb, from *postne (cf, superne), 
*posnne, *posne (§§ 69, 56 (3), 86). 
Loss of a consonant together with a possible loss of an s. 
§ 90. A guttural stop is lost between r or / on the one 
hand, and ¢, s, m or” on the other, and also between n and 
a dental stop. 
EXAMPLES, 
farsi and fartus (farcio) from *faresi, *farctos. 
sarsi and sartus (sarcio) from *sarcsi, *sarctos. 
fulsi and fultus (fulcio) from *fulesi, *fulctos. 
ultus (ulciscor) from *ulctos. 
tormentum, from *torg’mentom, *torementom (§ 82; 
derived from the root of torqueo). 
fulmen, from *fulgmen (fulgeo). 
quernus, ‘oaken,’ from *querenos (quercus). 
quindecim, from *quingu(e)decim, *quincdecim, *quing- 
decim (§§ 15, 82, 62). 
quintus, from *quing’tos, quinctos (§ 82). 
The combination -ncet- was restored by analogy in 
junctus, unctus, vinctus: quinctus is also found by the 
side of quintus especially in proper names, Quinctus, 
Quinctius, Quinctilis. 
§ 91. Every labial or guttural stop was lost before s 
followed by another consonant. When the final consonant
-P-A-G-E-96
  88 LATIN PHONETICS 
of the combination was voiced, s was lost in its turn along 
with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel if it 
was short (§ 86). 
EXAMPLES. 
(a) asporto, from *apsporto. 
ostendo, from *opstendo. 
suscipio, from *supscapio (with umlaut (§ 10, i. ¢.)). 
The prefixes ops- and sups- are copied from aps- according 
to the proportional formula ap- (ab-): aps- = op- (0b-), sup- 
(sub-) : 2%. 
sescenti from sexcenti (% = ¢s). 
Restorations due to analogy: abstuli (the phonetic 
form astuli is attested by the grammarian Charisius,! 1, 
p. 237, 2k), dexter, juxta, sextus, etc. These restorations, 
however, belonged exclusively to the literary language ; 
the people generally knew only dester, justa, sestus, etc., 
as is shown (i.) by numerous inscriptions and manuscripts 
written in the common language, and (ii.) by the Romance 
tongues (¢f. Old French, destre, jouste, sistes). 
Note.—It is interesting to find the same simplification of 
the combinations guttural stop + s + breathed consonant into 
s + breathed consonant in modern popular French (gf. the 
common pronunciations esclure, espliguer, estraire). 
(0) amitto, from *apsmitto. 
ebibo, from exbibo. 
sumo, from *sups(é)mo (with syncope (§ 15)). 
jumentum, from jouzmentum (a form attested by the 
most ancient Latin inscription found in 1899 in the Roman 
Forum ; ow > @ (§ 23)).

are almost exclusively furnished by the prefix ¢rans- when 
it precedes a voiced consonant, e.g. :— 
traduco, from transduco. 
trameo, from transmeo. 
trano, from transno. 
The restorations transduco, transmeo, transno, etc.,

  APPENDIX. 
THE SYLLABLE. 
Division of Syllables. 
§ 93. The combinations of sounds that we call words 
are divided into as many sections as they contain vowels 
(or diphthongs). These sections, separated from each 
other by a complete or partial movement of closing, or 
simply by a cessation of the vibrations in the glottis, are 
called syllables. 
In Latin the end of the syllable lay immediately after 
the vowel (or diphthong) when this was followed by 
another vowel or single consonant. When the vowel 
(or diphthong) was followed by two consonants or a 
double consonant, the consonantal element was as a 
tule divided between the preceding and following syllable. 
An exception was made only for the combination stop + 
trilled or divided consonant, both of which were attached 
to the following syllable. Lastly, of three consonants the 
first and the second belonged to the preceding, the third 
to the following syllable unless the combination was 
terminated by a stop followed by a trilled or divided 
consonant. In this case the break came after the first 
of the three consonants. 
EXAMPLES, 
(i.) (w) me-us, qui-es, quo-ad. 
(b) ca-do, pau-per, cae-cus, ro-sa, do-mus, si-nus, 
a-ra, cae-lum. 
(ii.) (a) ag-men, pug-na, prop-ter, tec-tum, ip-se, aes-tas, 
pis-cis, am-bo, om-nis, men-sa, or-do, pul-vis, 
but 
qua-drans, a-trox, fe-bris, su-pra, ae-gre, lu-crum, 
locu-ples. 
We must set aside compounds like abrumpo, sublatus, 
in which the combination between the stop and
-P-A-G-E-99
APPENDIX 91 
the trilled or divided consonant was much less 
strong, because the prefixes formed for a very 
long time distinct words (§ 84). Hence these 
words were divided, ab-rumpo, sub-latus. 
(b) ag-ger, gib-bus (a hunch), sic-cus, pos-sum, an- 
nus, il-le. 
(iii.) abs-temius, cons-picio, ins-tituo, temp-to, sanc-tus, 
but 
spec-trum, plaus-trum, mem-brum, tem-plum. 
Such is, at least, the method followed by the best 
inscriptions and manuscripts, which reflects, no doubt 
faithfully, the phonetic division. ‘he principle laid down 
by the Roman grammarians from the fifth century of our 
era stipulates, it is true, that all the combinations which 
can begin a word must be joined to the second syllable 
(e.g., a-spice, a-mnis, ca-stra). Their remarks, however, are 
merely subleties of the imagination, devoid of any lingu- 
istic interest. 
Duration of Syllables. 
§ 94. A syllable is short when it contains a short vowel 
followed by a single consonant—e.g., the first syllable of 
cido, cdquo (gu being a single sound (§ 39)) : 
A syllable is long :— 
G.) When it contains a long vowel or a diphthong, 
whatever the nature of the consonantal element 
that follows—e.g., the first syllable of paene, 
actus (§ 26), faustus. 
Gi.) When it contains a short vowel, followed by a 
double consonant, or a combination of con- 
sonants —e.g., the first syllable of messis, ¢/. 
méto (§ 83); sella, of stdeo (§ 71); neptis, 
‘grand-daughter’ or ‘niece,’ ¢f népos (§ 33) ; 
tango, ¢f. tetigi from *tetigi (§ 10,1, ¢.). An 
exception is formed by the syllables containing 
a short vowel followed by the combination 
stop + trilled or divided consonant, which with 
the early Latin dramatists are always short,
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 LATIN PHONETICS 
e.g., pitrém, léctiplés. The poets of the classical 
period, it is true, reckon them sometimes short, 
sometimes long ¢.g., Ovid, Met., xiii. 607 :— 
Et primo similis voliicri, mox vera volicris. 
The lengthening in this case, however, is known to be 
due to erudite imitation of Greek prosody. 
[In repeating a word the Roman poets constantly vary 
the quantity in order that the ictus may fall differently on 
it. Of. Vergil, Aen., 2, 663: gnatum ante ora pitris, 
patrem qui obtruncat ad aras; Hor., Od., i. 32, 11: et 
Lycum nigris oculis nigroque. Gf. Monro on Lwer., 4, 
1259: crassane conveniat liquidis et liquida crassis. ] 
§ 95. According to the Roman grammarians, the 
syllables which are long in spite of the short quantity 
of the vowel they contain, are long positione or positu. 
Qf. Quintilian, Jnstit. Orat., 9, 4, 86: certe in dimen- 
sione pedum syllaba quae est brevis insequente vel brevi 
alia, quae tamen duas priores consonantes habeat, fit 
longa, ut: agrestem tenui musam...a brevis, gres 
brevis, faciet tamen longam priorem. dat igitur illi aliquid 
ex suo tempore. Quo modo, nisi habet plus quam quae 
brevissima, qualis ipsa esset detractis consonantibus ? 
nunc unum tempus accommodat priori et unum accipit 
a sequente; ita duae natura breves wpositione sunt 
temporum quattuor; ¢ also Aulus Gellius, oct. 
Attic., iv. 17, 8, who says, in reference to subicit, that 
the i vim consonantis capit et idcirco ea syllaba produc- 
tius latiusque paulo pronuntiata priorem syllabam brevem 
esse non patitur, sed reddit eam positu longam. The 
terms positione or positu, translated from the Greek, like 
the majority of the technical terms of Latin grammar, 
mean properly ‘by convention. The Greek scholars 
of rhythm, in fact, imagined that the syllables which 
enclosed a long vowel were naturally long by them- 
selves; while the syllables which enclosed a short vowel 
followed by a double consonant, or a combination of con- 
sonants, were long through an arbitrary whim—a free and
-P-A-G-E-101
  
APPENDIX 93 
voluntary arrangement. But the Romans, who were indif- 
ferent to the question discussed by the Greek philosophers, 
as to whether names have been attached to things through 
natural inspiration or artificial convention, soon misunder- 
stood the meaning of positione or positu, and used these 
terms in the sense ‘by position,’ é.¢., by the position of the 
vowel before a repeated consonant or a combination of 
consonants. 
The explanation of the lengthening ‘by position’ lies in 
the phonetic division of the syllables. A consonantal ele- 
ment shared between two syllables lengthens the preceding 
syllable, an consonantal element not shared between them 
leaves it short. It is not the consonants which add length, 
but the pause which separates them. Note also that it is 
not the vowel but the syllable which is long by position.

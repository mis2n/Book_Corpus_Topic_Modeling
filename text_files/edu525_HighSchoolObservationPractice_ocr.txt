  HIGH SCHOOL OBSERVATION 
AND PRACTICE 
INTRODUCTION 
In the professional training of teachers three stages may be 
distinguished. The first might be characterized as laissez 
faire. The teacher in training was drilled in the subjects to be 
taught, in the apparent conviction that knowledge of a subject 
carries ability to impart it. Observation and practice teach- 
ing were esteemed by colleges and universities as fit subjects 
for the curricula of normal schools only. A few faculty mem- 
bers of teacher-training institutions have not yet progressed 
beyond this viewpoint, but they no longer represent the policies 
of their institutions. 
Most training schools for teachers now find themselves in a 
second stage, wherein observation and practice are generally 
provided, perhaps one should say generally tolerated, but not 
generously supported or effectively organized. Local public 
schools are likely to be utilized for the purpose. Neither the 
patrons of the public school, its teachers, nor the teacher- 
training institution are satisfied with this arrangement. 
Responsibility is too much divided, cadets are subject to the 
direction of different persons, and confusion results. 
Sometimes the higher institution operates its own training 
school in the second stage, but with so inadequate a force of 
supervisors that much of its practice is done without any 
supervision. The supervisors are assistants working toward 
an advanced degree, paid poorly, and inclined to regard their 
training school work as an incident to their professional 
progress. The pupils of the training school are a selected 
group, and the situation may be rendered still further abnormal

  8 High School Observation and Practice 
by the splitting of classes until the exercise is more nearly 
individual instruction than class teaching. 
In the training school observation usually precedes practice, 
but sometimes only one of the two is found. If both are util- 
ized, the shift from one to the other is sudden and complete. 
After some days of extensive and more or less directed observa- 
tion, the unhappy cadet is given the choice of his place of 
execution, and is dragged to the brink and thrown in, with the 
remark, “Today you begin practice teaching.”” By a process 
of trial and error he may adjust himself; if he fails to do so, he 
is summoned to conference, and in the absence of improvement 
is ultimately dropped from the course. Such a plan of teacher 
training is analogous to teaching a boy to swim by “ducking” 
him; the consequence is quite as often to make him afraid of 
the water as anything else. 
Is it not strange that in teaching the great art of teaching we 
should ignore the valuable tenets advanced and commonly 
practiced in teaching everything else? A student eager to 
master algebra or foreign language is ushered into a class where 
the whole mass of fundamental subject-matter and supple- 
mentary information or skill is presented to him slowly, 
steadily, and with due regard for organization. But if we were 
to pursue the method usually followed in the second stage of 
training teachers, we should let the student watch the teacher 
solve some problems of the kind most often encountered in 
applied algebra, or bid him listen while the teacher translated 
Goethe, Horace, or Moliere in good form; then at a signal we 
should ask the student to solve the advanced problems of 
applied algebra or to translate fluently standard authors of 
the language in question. Or suppose the child wishes to 
take up music, manual arts, or football. He will be intro- 
duced to the study by elementary exercises graded with the 
greatest care, but with the project idea motivating the activi- 
ties toa maximum. Care for technique is jealously exercised 
by the teacher. The music student “vocalizes’’ much of the 
time for months or years. No boy attacks a library table as 
his first project in the shop, because, forsooth, he has watched
-P-A-G-E-9
    Introduction 9 
his teacher make several library tables. A new coach frankly 
admits that he does not expect to have much of a team the first 
year, since he finds a squad of men who do not practice the 
fundamentals of the game according to his theory. So he 
spends weeks on drill in the fundamentals, and small is the 
chance in the final line-up for him who has not mastered those 
elements one at a time. 
Teaching is not only an art demanding the finest of touches, 
but it is an exceedingly complex art. The number of elements 
involved is so great that to succeed largely one must cultivate 
a sort of multiple consciousness; he can not devote his whole 
attention to a single matter. He must be able to watch those 
who study, to detect lagging interest in some who are not 
reciting at the moment, to evaluate the recitations of the 
pupils, to appreciate and correct the hygienic conditions of the 
room, and all the time to keep the class moving on. It is this 
necessity of attending to several things at once which entails 
such a serious nervous strain on the teacher. Many types of 
work can be performed with concentrated attention, but in 
teaching, the attention must be at once concentrated and 
dispersed. Even if outside preparation were not a great daily 
responsibility, the actual teaching day must therefore be so 
short as to seem unreasonably light to the layman. 
If the foregoing statements and analogies are in the main 
correct, the third and next stage in the progress of observation 
and practice teaching depends upon the application of job 
analysis to teaching. When the whole has been resolved into 
components, we must arrange these in a series of gradually 
increasing difficulty and introduce the student to them in 
that order, requiring him to “learn by doing” at every stage. 
All responsibilities must be made cumulative, so that the cadet 
will grow accustomed to attending to some of them in what 
amounts to a subconscious manner. Thus the cadet will be 
gradually inducted into service, and the figure of the novice 
being “ducked” can be exchanged for that of the bather who 
accustoms himself to the temperature of the water by splashing 
it over his extremities and wading slowly into it.

  10 High School Observation and Practice 
The exercises of this manual are an effort to carry out in 
laboratory fashion the theory which has just been defended as 
the proper one. It is not recommended or suggested as a guide 
to observation and practice in the grades, for which distinct 
sets of graded practice exercises are being developed by several 
investigators now at work. The following exercises, however, 
do present the plan which the writer has employed for nearly 
six years in University High School of the University of South 
Dakota. They have been subject to criticism by two or 
three generations of supervising teachers and have undergone 
numerous revisions. 
This manual assumes a training school fully staffed with 
capable supervising teachers, who have no duty to interfere 
with their supervision of the cadets’ work. Best results are 
secured when the supervising teacher has only one cadet for 
practice in any one class, because he can give his undivided 
attention to each cadet for the whole hour of practice if 
necessary. This would mean that a supervising teacher with 
five classes scheduled per day could care for a maximum of five 
cadets simultaneously. Under that plan ten cadets could 
be cared for in a year of two semesters by each supervising 
teacher with conditions little short of ideal. 
The exercises of the manual also assume a training school 
with a student body of normal character, preferably with 
recitation sections somewhat smaller than in public high 
schools. But the charge of tuition, conditions of admission, 
and standards of student attainment should be such that 
normal conditions in public high schools will prevail in the 
training school. There should exist individual differences of 
such a range as to create problems in both presentation and 
discipline. 
The method often followed of permitting two cadets to meet 
the class on alternate days or weeks is seriously defective, 
because it makes each responsible for checking up the assign- 
ments made by the other, when in actual experience one 
learns, or at least should learn, much by checking up his own 
assignments. Hence the following exercises imply daily 
responsibility of the cadet. The purpose throughout is to put
-P-A-G-E-11
  Introduction il 
the cadet over as much as possible of the ground he will later 
traverse as a teacher, and to make his experiences realistic. 
Another assumption of the plan of graded observation and 
practice here offered is that the general supervisor shall meet 
all cadets in group conference and discussion at regular 
intervals while they are engaged on the assignments. The 
examination and return of the written assignments to the 
cadets, with various notations placed upon them in the most 
painstaking way, will not bring the desired results. A cadet 
may not read the criticism written on his report, and if he 
does read it, he may not understand it. Experience repeat- 
edly proves that a cadet may observe and report upon a point 
for three consecutive days, and then fall squarely into the 
practice against which it has been the intention to warn him. 
Union meetings are therefore advised for all cadets, or for all 
interested in the same department, at the completion of every 
two or three assignments. At these union meetings super- 
vising teachers concerned should have the privilege of being 
present, but with the full manual of notes in their hands their 
attendance may be made voluntary. 
The general intent is that assignments shall be completed at 
the rate of one per day, except in those cases where a different 
time factor is indicated. Nevertheless, it is not necessary that 
such a schedule be maintained, if the supervising teacher wishes 
otherwise and the general supervisor consents. Some would 
consult the feeling of the cadet, and introduce him to teaching 
only as rapidly as he is disposed to take charge. But many 
cadets feel a shrinking from the final step of taking complete 
control of the class, and must be urged. The writer doubts 
the advisability of trying to make the course in observation 
and practice so individual a matter. The same arguments 
that can be advanced to sanction a change of pace for different 
cadets in this course advise a change of pace for students in 
any other course. Endless disorganization would ensue, and 
central administration of the course would be impossible. 
The notes for the general supervisor are designed to be 
suggestive for general guidance and to serve as discussion 
outlines in connection with the union meetings of cadets.
-P-A-G-E-12
  GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO CADETS 
(Read these at least three times, and as many more as neces- 
sary to know what they contain) 
. The plan of procedure for the semester will be to work 
gradually from complete observation to complete responsi- 
bility for the conduct of the class in which you are to 
practice. Bear in mind therefore that your duties are 
cumulative and that when you have done anything which 
demands continued doing, you are to go on performing 
that duty, though the instructions say nothing further 
about it. As an aid to your memory and for reference in 
union meetings of cadets, you should keep the full file 
of assignments you complete. 
. Secure at the place indicated by the general supervisor 
your assignment one day in advance. 
. Do not rush blindly ahead to make the daily report on the 
questions of the assignment in some fashion or other. 
Master each detail. Ask the supervising teacher or the 
general supervisor for any necessary assistance in doing 
the things you are directed to do. The teacher will be 
glad to consult with you at any time when not otherwise 
engaged. 
. Do not answer a question by referring to your answer on 
some previous report, which may no longer be in the gen- 
eral supervisor’s possession. 
. Write your answers to all questions in the assignments, 
on paper approximately 814’ x 11”. Place the date and 
the proper assignment number at the top of the sheet. 
Number your answers by the same notation as the ques- 
tion or direction on the assignment sheet. 
. Fold your reports as directed, and place your name, ihe 
date and the number of the assignment on the outside.

13. General Instructions to Cadets 13 
Place all reports in your box, and leave them there until 
they are marked, “Returned’’ by the general supervisor. 
Do not take away your class register or cardboard plat, 
except when you are in class. Leave them in the box. 
. Do not bringin your reports in bunches. File them before 
5 P. M. on the day on which they are supposed to be done 
according to the date assigned them. Make a reputation 
for punctuality. Unless arrangements are made with 
the general supervisor for extra time, deferred reports 
will be given reduced credit at his option. 
When your time in class is not occupied in filling answers to 
assignments or performing duties already assigned, give 
your attention to general observation of the work of the 
class. For this purpose sit with the class, not facing it. 
Do not come tardy to class. If you are being held over- 
time elsewhere on the campus, make arrangements with 
the offending instructor for more prompt dismissal, or 
report the cause to the general supervisor of observation 
and practice. Supervising teachers are directed to report 
your punctuality as well as your attendance. 
If you are to be absent, report it in advance, if possible, to 
the supervising teacher or the general supervisor, so that 
full preparations may be made to proceed in your absence. 
In case of absence, do not omit the assignment for that 
day. Merely fall one day behind, taking all assignments 
in their numerical order. 
Watch your box for communications as to time for union 
meeting of cadets, reports on inspections, or any other 
matters.

. Don’t impress students with the fact that you are a 
transient. Remove hat and wraps while you are in 
charge. 
. Don’t sit with shades down on the shady side of the room 
and electric lights burning. Give proper attention to the 
hygiene of the room at the opening of the period.

3. Don’t be too certain, if you start off poorly the first day, 
that conditions will be better tomorrow; probably they 
will be worse. “Get the jump” on the situation, and 
report all unsolved problems to the office, even though 
they appear minor. 
4. Don’t permit yourself to be swamped with various sorts of 
requests at the very beginning of the period, before you 
have had opportunity to check the attendance. No 
permissions for the first three to five minutes is a good rule 
in study hall management. After waiting that long 
many a student will have forgotten that he “needed to 
speak.” 
5. Don’t allow a student to leave the room chronically at 
your period each day. Most of the unclassified permits 
to leave the study hall are highly unnecessary, an evidence 
of restlessness and an excuse for idleness. 
6. Don’t tolerate coughing or other attempts to produce 
confusion and secure publicity. Summon the offender 
quietly to the desk by a gesture, and ask for an explanation 
of his ailment or attitude. 
7. Don’t send students from the study hall to the office for 
disciplinary reasons, until you have exhausted your own 
resources and utilized the advice of supervising teacher and 
general supervisor. 
8. Don’t vary from the regulations given you for guidance, 
even when someone else in authority seems to have made a 
mistake. His mistakes do not excuse yours. 
9. Don’t bury your face in a book, but form the habit of 
glancing up casually at frequent intervals, to discover 
minor disorders and note the signals of students for 
permission to speak, etc. 
10. Don’t sit idly. ‘Set an example of industry before stu- 
dents. Why?

(Your written report on the questions of this assignment need 
not be filed until you have spent your fifth day in the

1. Report at the study hall for ten days at the hour you have 
arranged to supervise it. 
2. Receive from the supervising teacher the plat for that 
hour, and take the roll as soon as the second bell rings. 
3. Fill in on the daily attendance slip the names of absentees 
from the study hall. 
4. Note also cases of tardiness, and proceed according to the 
regulations handed you herewith. 
5. File this slip daily for the use of the principal. Why does 
he wish this information when roll was taken in study hall 
at the beginning of the half day? 
6. Observe that on the plat of the study hall for your hour 
there appears a subject in the rectangle with the name of 
each student. See that students study the subjects 
indicated. Call any lapses to their attention tactfully 
and modestly, but insist upon compliance. If the student 
feels that the arrangement is wrong, ask him to bring next 
day from the principal a permit authorizing a change. 
7. What are the conditions under which students are permit- 
ted to communicate with each other? Do the regulations 
seem adequate and wise? 
8. What regulations govern students wishing to go to the 
library to study? Are these sufficient? 
9. What regulations govern other requests to leave the room? 
Do they prevent abuse? 
10. When students are granted permission to leave the study 
hall, the time of going and returning should be entered on 
your report. 
11. What station is most advantageous for control of the study 
hall?

5. Begin the practice of preparing each day the lesson assigned 
for the next, so that you can take an intelligent part in the 
class exercise, much as though you were a member of the

A. Count 10 on each question, unless it is designated to 
weigh more than other questions. In such instance, let 
it weigh some multiple of 10, and count it as two or more 
questions accordingly. 
B. Grade one question on all papers before proceeding to 
the next. 
C. Before grading a question, decide as definitely as you 
can what you expect in the way of an answer, and weight 
those parts definitely. 
. Grade rigidly. 
Place the grade for each question of each paper on a 
separate tally sheet instead of on the examination paper, 
but write on the examination paper any correction or 
suggestion you think best, to correct an error or 
oversight. 
F. Total the grades on the tally sheet, and divide the sum 
by the number of questions; to secure the grade for the 
entire paper on a basis of 100, multiply the quotient by 
10. 
G. If the grades on the papers for the class as a whole are 
lower than on general daily work, raise all a flat amount 
until there is no marked difference between daily and 
examination grades in general, provided of course that 
100 is the upper limit for the best paper.

ASSIGNMENT I 
1. Possible distinctions between various terms used,— 
“Assembly,” “Study Hall,” “Auditorium.” It is not so 
essential that the ten days duty be consecutive, and the 
arrangement of a compact schedule may dictate otherwise. 
4. A copy of the “General Regulations” for the training 
school should be placed in the hands of each cadet at the 
outset, and one division of these will naturally deal with 
the study hall. 
5. Prevention of students from “skipping” assembly periods. 
6. Students may well be assigned for study a subject which 
the teacher then in charge of the study hall is most compe- 
tent to supervise. If a student insists that he does not 
need the full time to prepare the lesson he is then supposed 
to study, cadets can secure at the office information as to 
his last reported standing in that subject. 
7. Valid reasons for communication by students: (1) to learn 
an assignment, or (2) to borrow a needed article. Danger 
of students speaking to secure help on their lessons. Does 
a student’s facial expression indicate when he has left 
the subject on which he asked permission to speak? 
Advisability of asking him to stand while speaking. 
8. If the existing library arrangement does not give a check 
on students, a satisfactory system should be explained. 
9. A special pass slip is advised for those leaving the room. 
The principal discovers from these slips or from the 
assembly reports for the whole day whether certain

students abuse the privilege of leaving the room. The 
usual limitation in a small assembly should be only one 
person out at a time. 
11. Some work from the front, others from the rear, and others 
move about. Should the teacher’s desk be in the rear of 
the room? Psychology of dealing with people face to face. 
12. Explain thoroughly the ‘‘Ten Study Hall Command- 
ments,’ and add other useful suggestions, such as 
A. Keep your eyes on the room while students or super- 
visors speak to you. 
B. Ask students when they come to consult you, please to 
stand at your side, and not in front of you.

2. The importance of ink for permanence and legibility. 
Appearance of the register in general as an index of the one 
who keeps it. 
3. B. The class roll not to be entered in the register too soon in 
actual practice. The close of the second week a fairly 
safe time, to allow for late entry, dropped students, 
and transfers from section to section. 
D. General headings at top of the page, giving name of 
class, etc., if not filled, make class register slow to consult 
by any other than the teacher who used it. Function 
of the register in answering questions raised long after- 
ward. Illustrate the previous point. 
ASSIGNMENT III 
1. A. Why have definite seats at all? To facilitate roll call, 
avoid scuffling for seats. 
C. Two general plans of seating,—voluntary choice by 
students, assignment by the teacher. Teacher likely 
to use alphabetical arrangement, to help learn names, 
make possible swifter return of written work.

Considerations back of seating arrangement. 
a. Well distributed for quizzes. 
b. Otherwise grouped toward center and front of over- 
large room. 
c. Deaf and those with defective vision toward front. 
d. Smaller ones in front, to prevent ‘“‘hide-and-seek.” 
e. Low-spoken ones at rear center. 
f. Rascals where they do least harm, sometimes in front, 
sometimes in rear. 
. Absences at first in pencil, lest they turn out to be tardi- 
nesses. If the registration system issues class cards to 
the teacher, roll may be called by cards, and no entry 
made in register until the close of class. 
. Upper space is used, that grade may go below when 
work is made up. 
. Excused absence is marked in pencil, that it may be 
erased when grade of make-up is ready. 
. Endorsement of initials of teacher on excuse makes one 
excuse sufficient for the day or longer absence. At the 
end of his first day after returning to school the student 
turns in his excuse tothe principal, who can tell whether 
it has been properly checked by all teachers. 
ASSIGNMENT IV 
. A thermometer essential. Personal feelings not a safe 
guide. Differences in dress and bodily condition of 
students. 
a. Where should a thermometer be placed? Away from 
drafts, better not on outside wall, surely not near door, 
window, or ventilating duct. Three or four feet above 
floor.

of looking after the temperature at short intervals.

Attention to shades essential twice a day at least. 
Different types of shade, as to mechanical features and

E. Postures become bad when habitual. Idea of erectness a 
sort of military notion, hardly based upon any special 
hygienic needs. Most correction of posture should be 
done by private suggestion, as many students are sensitive 
relative to it. 
F. Note for which phases of cleanliness students and teacher 
are responsible, and which devolve upon the janitor. 
Tendency of students to place the burden entirely on the 
janitor. 
23 A. 
Cc. ASSIGNMENT V 
There should be some regular way. Routine pays in 
the long run. 
A teacher should never dismiss his class to the study hall 
until the bell signals the close of the period. Failure to 
observe this distracts the study hall and exasperates the 
teacher there in charge. Suppose the study hall 
teacher dismissed his session ahead of time, and sent 
students bustling into the classrooms before previous 
classes had dismissed. 
. Suggest two or three different ways in which assembly 
time is provided without discriminating against one 
subject more than another. 
Assignments at beginning of the hour are unhurried, 
but those at the close can be made more intelligently 
in the light of progress made by the class in preparation 
and in the discussion period. 
. Vague assignments demoralize the class, because the 
teacher is left without recourse. 
. By special assignments to individuals at their choice the 
instructor may locate and encourage students of 
special interests. 
. Only by this means can the capable student be kept busy. 
Illustrate from different subjects the possibility of 
three assignments: a minimum assignment, performance 
of which entitles to a passing grade; a supplementary
-P-A-G-E-42
CC _<£_ ee 
42 High School Observation and Practice 
assignment, perhaps twice the minimum, which entitles 
to a good average grade; and a maximum assignment, 
perhaps three times the minimum, performance of 
which entitles to a superior grade. 
4. A. Difficulty of getting teachers to observe the period for 
supervised study. Their failure to do so is the principal 
cause for its decline. 
B. Assistance at the beginning of preparation on the 
advanced lesson saves energy. If supervised study 
came at the beginning of the period, how many and 
which students would try to prepare the whole lesson in 
the supervised period? Granting the possibility of 
preparing the whole lesson just before the recitation 
begins, is it better to prepare a lesson at one sitting or 
at two? 
C. Group direction first, until the better students catch 
the point; then individual direction, to avoid retarding 
the faster students. Illustrate from drill work in 
foreign language and mathematics especially. 
E. An assignment, ‘Take to page—,”’ does not aid prepara- 
tion. The assignment is a definite part of supervised 
study, or may be made such. 
ASSIGNMENT VI 
4. A. b. Roll call, the distribution of material, return of 
corrected work, and other preliminaries should be 
carried through with the utmost dispatch. Delay 
in starting class after the bell encourages tardiness. 
Cadets should be urged to observe the time spent on 
preliminaries by their college instructors. 
c. Ask cadets from their observation to offer illustra- 
tions of digressions that are not unprofitable, and 
repetitions that are not unnecessary. 
B. a. An orderly and respectful class is prerequisite to a 
successful class hour, but of course does not guarantee 
the desired result.

  Notes for General Supervisor 43 
Have an understanding with cadets that all cases of 
discipline are to be dealt with by them if at all 
possible, and that counsel of both supervising teacher 
and general supervisor is to be sought, instead of 
sending a student out of class asa first step. Impress 
the idea that fundamentally discipline must be 
exercised by each teacher for himself, and that 
another can not discipline for the cadet. Bring out 
the idea of a carefully graduated series of penalties 
by illustrations, so that the cadet will be able to 
increase the pressure in a case needing it. Pressure 
should increase with terrific rapidity in the case of an 
unresponsive or stubborn student. If cadets send 
students from the classroom or assembly, such 
students should doubtless go to the general super- 
visor; otherwise the cadet is working under the 
direction of two different persons. 
. Readiness of response. 
. Absence of twisting, whispering, gazing, and distrac- 
tion of others. Intelligent questions. Voluntary 
contributions. 
. Movement of recitation enhanced by alertness and 
speed of recitation, quickness with which work is 
placed on the board, absence of filibustering. 
. Approximately what per cent of the talking is done 
by the teacher? How general was the participation 
of the class? Is most of the work done by a few 
bright students? Are volunteers utilized? 
“Sufficiently”’ not defined in terms of hours and 
minutes, but in that fresh grasp of the lesson that 
sets the mind of the teacher ready for each difficulty 
and prepares her to forestall it. 
. To supplement the text or other assignment should 
be the teacher’s daily endeavor. It makes the 
student feel the subject is growing, and encourages 
him to be on the lookout for supplementary material.

Unless preparation is very complete, for many 
subjects some notes will be necessary. Of which 
subjects would this be most true? No advance list 
of questions or outline can carry one through a whole 
recitation. He must be able to frame fresh questions 
to meet unforeseen answers. 
. All of these adjectives except the last describe desir- 
able qualities in the teacher. By illustration, show 
how such qualities may be so strong in a teacher as to 
weaken him. As to dogmatism, what subjects 
permit it more? what subjects, less? Show how 
different phases of the same subject, as grammar and 
literature, permit different degrees of dogmatism. 
The answer comes quite quickly, though somewhat 
intangibly from what is called the “atmosphere of 
the class.’ Without an affirmative answer to this, 
the teacher can not long maintain his position as 
leader of the class.

The partition of this into semesters. 
The division of a semester’s work into assignments 
for each week, on the assumption that a student can 
progress faster after he has been enrolled longer in 
the subject. 
The division of the week’s assignment into daily 
tasks. 
. Bring out the evil and uncertainty of deferring grading 
for long intervals, and then grading on general impres- 
sions. Last impressions may count too much, and 
distant early impressions may color estimates of work 
recently done. Which plan keeps the student most 
nearly at his maximum performance?

Notes for General Supervisor 45 
If grading is to be done daily, should it be done after 
the close of the day, or of each recitation period? 
Would it be better done during the class immediately 
after the appearance of each student? Should the 
teacher take his register to class? 
C. It is not necessary to grade each student daily. Value 
of keeping register on the desk, though not in use during 
the class. 
D. Use of per cent scale, numerals 0-10 inclusive, numerals 
5-1 inclusive and various systems of letters. The evil 
of any system comes in the endeavor to make too fine 
distinctions. 
F. Develop the theory of an odd rather than an even 
number of steps in a grading scale. Conformity to that 
idea in all our estimates of people, things, and conditions. 
ASSIGNMENT VIII 
2. B. Respects should be paid to the teacher who thinks that 
the aim of studying algebra is ‘‘to know algebra.’ 
Impress the necessity of broad ultimate aims as the only 
sure defense against a curriculum crowded with all 
kinds of material of small value. Each subject should 
have its special point of strength, and justification on 
vague disciplinary grounds should be frowned upon. 
Two or three evident values of weight are enough to 
warrant a subject. 
3. A. One mark of the master teacher is to know the caliber 
of the average member of his class, and to match it 
with his assignment, at the same time providing for the 
superior student, as advised under Assignment V. 
E. Cadets incline to take realization of values and many 
other things on faith. A hard task of the supervisor 
is to instill a properly critical attitude toward the work 
the cadet observes. Few cadets are too critical, and 
if any be found so, they can be quickly cured by requests 
for constructive suggestions for improvement, as called 
for under 3, C.

3. A. a. Teachers may follow a general rule, but probably 
should not always do so. For the student to stand 
and face the class may mean the delay of climbing 
out of an ill-fitting seat, the confusion of moving 
furniture, and a formality disadvantageous to a 
bashful or backward student. Some students will 
refuse to recite rather than come to the front to 
offer what little they have to give. Nevertheless, 
standing lends a dignity that sometimes is desirable, 
especially for sustained recitations, and may inspire 
to greater effort. It is a proper request to make of 
students who speak in too low a tone, despite 
repeated admonitions to the contrary. 
b. Warn the cadet that he may fall into an unconscious 
habit of this kind. 
ce. It is better to call upon only part of the class than to 
call upon all by giving each a brief and unfair test on 
the lesson. Particularly if he fails on the first, 
should the student be given a second question. 
d. Volunteers may be used 
i. To save time on a hard question. 
ii. To push more rapidly, as in reviews. 
iii. To learn more about the knowledge of the class 
as a whole through a frequent show of hands. 
iv. To give the weak student a chance. 
v. To encourage students to bring material from 
outside. 
No volunteers to be used except upon the teacher’s 
call for “Hands.” Waving of hands confuses the 
student reciting. A few must not do all the work. 
e. The first name is used except in large schools. It 
keeps students from growing up too fast, and intro- 
duces a better personal relation. 
f. Can all the members of the class be wisely sent to 
the board at the same time? If not, how many? 
Is it easier to keep students working at the board or

at their seats, if they are inclined to shirk or loaf? 
Is it easier to help a student at his seat or at the 
board, when written work is being done? 
g. There are many ways. 
i. Save the easy questions for him. 
ii. Give him a second chance. 
iii. Give him a little more time, but not to the 
neglect of the brighter ones or the damage of the 
class as a whole. 
iv. Rephrase the question for him. 
v. Give him credit for the little he does correctly, 
instead of carrying the impression that most of 
his work is wrong. 
vi. Let him volunteer most often. 
vii. Speak a private, perhaps a public, word of 
praise. 
viii. Ask him to come to you for outside help. 
B. a. Why can not a laboratory period start as promptly 
as a recitation? 
c. What conditions tempt students to depend on each 
other? 
ASSIGNMENT X 
A. Discussion of the cadets’ reports should bring out clearly 
the fact that lesson types are rarely pure, and that the 
pure types that have been presented in pedagogical 
literature are only illustrations of different methods of 
effective teaching. 
B. b. Lack of clearness may arise from haste, too little 
repetition, reluctance of student to ask a question, 
use of illustrations or terminology not understood 
by the student. 
c. How are unanswered questions in the mind of a 
student to be sensed? Importance of teacher facing 
his class, studying their faces, and constantly asking 
questions on what has just been presented. 
 
-P-A-G-E-48

C. c. It would be well to refer cadets to any treatment of 
the question as a method in teaching, which appears 
good and happens to be available in the library. 
d. The leading question may be employed to speed up 
the recitation sometimes. It may be framed to 
suggest the wrong answer, for the purpose of testing 
the student’s stability in his conclusions. 
g. This is the kind of questioning that constitutes 
masterful teaching. It is as difficult as telling the 
student is easy. 
h. Should a student be interrupted by criticisms in 
the course of his topical recitation? Under what 
circumstances? The class should be criticised for 
not taking notes while a recitation is being made or 
a theme is being read. Usually they sit listening, 
and if the individual sees one thing to mention, its 
retention draws his mind from the entire remainder 
of the appearance. 
ASSIGNMENT XI 
G-H-I. The significance of a survey of the equipment of the 
laboratory by the cadet can hardly be overestimated. He 
frequently finds himself in his first location called on to fit 
out a laboratory in some subject. 
ASSIGNMENT XII 
Explain to the cadet the plan of making up work missed by 
absence, as organized in the training school. Suggestions 
should be made that will enable him to discharge this 
responsibility without undue loss of time. The nature 
of the subject as to interdependence of its parts will have 
a great effect, and the reputation of the student who has to 
make up the work will determine greatly the amount of 
detail for which he must be held.

ASSIGNMENT XII 
2. From among the many score cards for teachers, it will be 
advisable to select criteria that suit the needs of a cadet, 
and make up a form for use in the training school. The self- 
study which results from the use of this device is one of the 
most valuable outcomes of the course. 
Each criticism will be most effective if made orally in 
a human fashion, and then in writing, a copy being kept. 
The latter serves as a valuable reminder to both cadet and 
general supervisor of the ground covered in previous 
criticisms. 
3. The daily reports on Assignment XIII may be filed, if 
desired, with the committee on recommendation of teachers, 
as a sample of the cadet’s standard in written work. 
4. Experience has shown that high-school students should be 
checked before they become too far delinquent. Periodic 
reports may well be made to the office at the close of each 
week for a time following the opening of school in the fall. 
After a month or two these reports need not be filed oftener 
than once in two weeks. Cadets should participate in 
this scheme. 
The final direction will regulate any tendency of supervis- 
ing teachers to leave cadets too much alone. 
ASSIGNMENT XV 
(To be discussed in cadet meeting before the examinations 
occur) 
2. B. It is best to grade the papers in reverse order on each 
successive question. 
C. A standard of grading is easier to maintain if a question 
is graded on all papers at the same sitting. 
D. A group of well-distributed marks can be scaled upward; 
but a group of uniformly high marks can not be scaled 
downward to good purpose, because they would leave 
the class without distinction in excellence.
-P-A-G-E-50

E. Comments must be made to invest the final examination 
with a constructive function. But to place the grade 
of each question on the paper has small advantage, and 
opens the way for endless quibbling over the fairness of 
the grade assigned. 
G. Students must not receive the impression from exces- 
sively low examination grades, that the examination is a 
means of taking away from them that rating which they 
have earned during the semester.

NOTES FOR SUPERVISING TEACHERS 
GENERAL 
1. Be on hand at the beginning of every class throughout the 
term, so that absence or tardiness by the cadet will not stop 
operations. 
2. Report daily to the general supervisor each tardiness or 
absence by a cadet. 
3. The time reserved for supervised study, if any, may be 
utilized partly in answering any questions which the cadet 
needs to ask concerning his assignment for that day. 
Treat him as you would any other student, answering 
entirely such questions as necessary, but throwing him on 
his own resources as far as possible. 
4. The greatest success in training cadets in your special 
subject can be attained only by your constant study of the 
particular problems arising there, and by your planning to 
meet those problems. Distinctions should be made in 
observation of recitation, demonstration, and laboratory 
exercises. Observations in different laboratories must vary 
considerably. The grading plan must be quite different 
for even two subjects in the same department, as cooking 
and sewing. The assignments provided herewith for the 
cadet present a general plan which is not intended to 
hamper you in the arrangement of supplementary exercises 
of such nature and extent as appeal to you. 
ASSIGNMENT II 
3. See that your own classbook is in proper condition and 
legible, or the cadet may copy errors. Names of students 
are frequently copied incorrectly by the cadets, because of 
bad penmanship of supervising teachers.

. File today with the general supervisor an outline of the 
work to be covered week by week for the remainder of the 
semester. It will be the business of the cadet to break 
this outline into daily assignments. 
ASSIGNMENT III 
. If the class is so small or the furniture so arranged that 
regular seating is inadvisable, explain your reasons so 
carefully to the cadet that he will be able to pass them on 
in his report on this assignment. 
. When the principal is known to be out of the office for the 
period, you may judge it wise to admit a tardy student 
without a permit, but you should require him to present one 
the next time the class meets. Whatever policy would be 
agreeable to the principal in such a case, it is your business 
to know, and to explain to the cadet. Emphasize the fact 
that the purpose of the school is the education of the 
student body, and that to this end foolish loss is always to 
be deprecated. But on the other hand, no variation in 
practice should occur which might be construed as failure to 
cooperate with the principal, or which might cause the 
work to become demoralized. 
. You must continue to keep your own register with reference 
to attendance and grading, since the record of the cadet 
does not cover the whole semester. Refer all permits and 
excuses to him at the opening of the class, and let him turn 
them over to you for your record after he has made his 
use of them. 
ASSIGNMENT IV 
. Give attention to the thermometer at proper intervals, 
observe the lighting and ventilation of your room in an 
alert manner, and coach students on points of cleanliness 
and neatness, such as proper use of the waste basket. 
B. Be on guard lest you spoil a well-lighted room by some 
careless habit, such as standing between the students
-P-A-G-E-53

se B: Notes for Supervising Teachers 53 
and the window, or using artificial light while shades 
are unnecessarily drawn. 
A rough test of movement of air is made by placing a 
sheet of paper against the outlet. The cadet may wish 
to employ it. 
If certain students are sensitive as to matters of posture, 
sight, or hearing, communicate that information to the 
cadet. 
It is common practice to have each class leave a clean 
board at the close of the hour, unless the work should be 
left to aid you in grading later on. If your classroom is 
furnished with seats and desks you will set a valuable 
example to the cadet by having the bottoms of the desks 
removed to avoid the collection of rubbish. 
ASSIGNMENT V 
When assignments have to be dictated, use the black- 
board and thus avoid misunderstanding. 
C-D. Educational discussions are filled with talk of indi- 
4, A. vidual differences. Will cadets come from your class 
reporting that you recognize no such thing? 
If you do not observe the supervised study period, tell 
the cadet why, and ask him to report your explanation 
on his assignment. 
. Under no circumstances permit a student to study 
another subject during your period of supervised study. 
ASSIGNMENT VI 
b. Study the mechanics of your class management, and 
attempt to determine a standard time allotment for 
preliminaries, placing of work on the board, etc. 
A standard will be helpful in judging and criticising 
cadets under your direction. 
. g. How many students can you test satisfactorily by 
oral methods in an ordinary class period? Note

how this differs from subject to subject (if you teach 
more than one), or from one class to another in the 
same subject. 
. b. If you bring something from outside the assignment, 
make the fact so obvious that students and cadets 
will recognize it, even if they are not perfectly familiar 
with the content of the assignment. 
c. Show your outline or notes to the cadet, or duplicate 
it by using a carbon sheet, and place a copy in his 
hands. This gives him a definite idea of the lesson 
plan as framed by the experienced teacher. 
d. Teaching tends to engender dogmatism, because 
materials are repeated so often. How can greater 
tolerance be developed in your class? 
ASSIGNMENT VIL 
If the cadet uses poor judgment as to amount assigned, 
ask him to submit his proposed assignment for one day 
when he comes to class the previous day, so that at some 
odd moment you may suggest any revisions that appear 
prudent. Criticise his method of assignment daily, 
beginning now. Make this and all other criticisms on 
small sheets, which are handed to the cadet at the close 
of the class, unless a better time can be found. Keep 
a copy of your criticisms. An oral statement of them 
comes best before the memorandum is given the cadet. 
Most cadets use the blackboard entirely too little in 
assignments as well as in teaching. 
Check up closely on the presence of ‘‘a definite plan.” 
If it is lacking, inform the cadet. 
ASSIGNMENT VIII 
Before answering this question it may be advisable to 
learn something of the training on which the cadet will 
rely for his answer to the one following. His material

will probably be drawn from his courses in educational 
values, principles of education, or high-school education. 
4. If you employ a different plan of grading than advised in 
the assignment to the cadet, see that he has your plan before 
the class begins. If your plan is not generally used through- 
out the training school, inform the general supervisor of its 
character, so that he can examine intelligently the student’s 
report on the assignment. 
ASSIGNMENT Ix 
3. A. a. Vary your practice as occasion advises, that the 
cadet may see the wisdom of adjusting procedure to 
circumstances. 
b. Tell the cadet how you plan in advance to call upon 
the students. 
c. Illustrate a return several times to the individual 
who is “bluffing,” or is totally unprepared but has 
not admitted it. 
e. If you treat different students differently, explain 
why to the cadet. 
B. c. Tell the cadet how student pairs are arranged. 
ASSIGNMENT X 
8. B. d. The cadet will be inclined when he begins to teach, 
merely to reiterate a principle. He must be forced 
to illustrate it. 
ASSIGNMENT XI 
2. G-I. The cadet can be aided to answer this question if he 
takes the laboratory inventory and the laboratory 
manual, and finds out how far the list of experiments 
to be performed has been provided for. Simul- 
taneously he can discover what pieces of apparatus 
have been sufficiently duplicated, and how far the 
demonstration needs of the instructor have been met. 
It will also be possible to see what equipment is 
superfluous.

ASSIGNMENT XIII 
If the step from the cadet’s relation to the class in Assign- 
ment XII to full responsibility seems too wide, graduate it 
by assigning to the cadet one definite part of the lesson, 
and thus by two or three steps bring him to full responsi- 
bility. Leave the cadet by himself at times. He must not 
come to rely on the supervising teacher to help him out of 
all his difficulties. 
Interpose rarely when the cadet is dealing with the class; 
and when it seems best to do so, let the interposition come 
as a sort of random idea that struck you, or as a reminder 
of some personal experience, or as a contribution such as 
might be offered by any member of the class,—as anything 
except a correction. This will require all the tact you 
possess. Identify yourself with the class, but do not think 
that all suggestions can be deferred until the close of the 
class for private conference. 
In your supervision, let unfavorable criticism always be 
preceded by some sort of favorable comment, even though 
the favorable comment be of a conventional nature. Let 
constructive suggestion follow immediately upon negative 
suggestion. A prominent man in education has said that 
almost any supervisor can tell poor teaching when he sees it, 
but that it takes a real supervisor to make a good teacher 
out of a poor one. 
Be concrete. Do not say to a cadet, ‘‘ Your questioning 
could be improved.” Establish such a statement by 
illustrations of bad questions asked by the cadet, and clinch 
your point by indicating, or leading the cadet to indicate, 
how they might be bettered. 
Root out incipient tendencies to mar fine craftsmanship 
in teaching by unnecessary and monotonous repetitions of 
phrases, such as ‘All right.” 
. Here appears the only approach to the lesson plan in the 
entire series. Practical school men constantly criticise 
the product of teacher training institutions as mechanical.
-P-A-G-E-57
a 
Notes for Supervising Teachers 57 
The writer believes that lesson plans have contributed to 
this criticism, and that a lesson plan fully written out 
inhibits the cadet’s efforts to meet unforeseen situations. 
The absence of extended lesson plans in the regular practice 
of experienced teachers denotes an artificiality to the 
method if carried to excess. Cadets may regard the 
compulsory lesson plan as task work. Impress the idea 
that one must be so thoroughly prepared for each lesson 
that he knows in outline what he expects to accomplish 
in the class period. This would probably involve some 
notes. But the whole question is whether the cadet, when 
he comes before his class, reveals uncertainty as to subject- 
matter or procedure, and whether he runs out of something 
to do before the period closes. Lesson plans should be 
required of those whose performance indicates the need. 
They should be just as detailed and continued for just as 
long a time as the case requires. This part of the practice 
is certainly one to be determined by individual considera- 
tions. Each supervising teacher will settle it according to 
his judgment in the case of each cadet.
